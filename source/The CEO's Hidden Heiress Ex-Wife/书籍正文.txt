###Chapter 1

Evelyn Carter stared at the divorce papers on the table, already signed by her husband.

Tears welled in her eyes as she turned toward the window. Nathan Blackwood stood there, bathed in the golden glow of the afternoon sun—cold, perfect, and unyielding, like a statue carved from marble. His presence alone was suffocating.

"I've signed. You should do the same so we can finalize this before Victoria arrives."

Nathan tucked his hands behind his back, not even sparing her a glance. "Since we had a prenup, there won’t be any disputes over assets. But as compensation, I’ll give you an additional $20 million and the villa in the western suburbs. At least that way, I won’t have to explain to Grandpa why you left empty-handed."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Does Grandpa know you’re divorcing me?"

"His opinion doesn’t change my decision."

Her slender frame trembled, forcing her to grip the edge of the table for support. Tears spilled freely as she whispered, "Nathan… can’t we stay married?"

Finally, he turned, his dark eyes narrowing in disbelief.

His sharp jawline, those sculpted lips—even now, her traitorous heart skipped a beat.

"Why?"

"Because I love you."

Her voice cracked. "Nathan, I love you. I don’t care if you don’t love me back. I just want to be your wife—"

"Enough." He cut her off with a dismissive wave. "A loveless marriage is torture. You knew from the start this was temporary. You knew I was only rebelling against Grandpa. You knew I loved Victoria. I couldn’t be with her then, but now she’s coming back from Silvercrest, and I intend to marry her. Our three-year contract is up. It’s time for you to go."

Evelyn lowered her head. Fat teardrops splattered onto the table, but she wiped them away before he could see.

(He noticed. He just didn’t care.)

Then his phone rang. The moment he saw the caller ID, his entire demeanor softened.

"Victoria, have you boarded yet?"

The warmth in his voice made Evelyn flinch. Was this the same man who had just spoken to her like she was nothing?

Victoria Sterling’s cheerful voice floated through the speaker. "Nathan, I’m already at Crestview Airport!"

"What? Weren’t you supposed to arrive tonight?"

"I wanted to surprise you!"

"Wait for me. I’m coming to get you."

And just like that, he was gone.

The slam of the door echoed through the empty room, leaving Evelyn shattered.

She had given everything to the Blackwoods—her devotion, her sacrifices, her love. And in the end, Nathan treated their marriage like a prison sentence he couldn’t wait to escape.

Now that Victoria was back, he was rushing to discard Evelyn like yesterday’s news.

A bitter laugh escaped her. Her fingers trembled as she picked up the pen and signed the papers, smudging Nathan’s perfect signature with her tears.

That evening, Nathan returned to Cliffside Manor with Victoria in his arms, carrying her bridal-style through the grand entrance.

"Nathan, we shouldn’t be like this. You’re not divorced yet. What if Evelyn sees us?" Victoria murmured, pressing a hand to his chest.

"She won’t care."

His voice was ice. "And even if she does, so what? I never loved her. She was just a placeholder. She knows her place."

The Blackwoods flocked around Victoria, showering her with attention while Evelyn quietly set the dining table in the next room.

Nathan caught sight of his wife’s lonely figure and smirked. Pathetic. Did she really think playing the dutiful housewife would make me reconsider?

Then the butler rushed in, breathless. "Young Master Nathan! The young madam—she’s left!"

"Left? When?"

"Just now! She took nothing—just removed her apron and walked out the back door. A black car picked her up."

Nathan stormed into their bedroom. It was spotless, as if she had never existed. The only trace of her was the tear-stained divorce papers on the nightstand.

Frowning, he strode to the window just in time to see a sleek black Rolls-Royce vanishing into the night.

"She couldn’t wait to leave, huh?" he muttered, irritation flaring.

Hadn’t she been begging to stay just hours ago?

Pulling out his phone, he barked at his secretary, "Find out who owns the car with license plate EVA9999."

Five minutes later, the answer came: "Mr. Blackwood, that vehicle belongs to the CEO of Monarch Group."

Sebastian Kingsley.

Evelyn was from a small town. She had no connections, no social circle. For three years, she had been a recluse in his home.

How the hell did she know Sebastian Kingsley?

Nathan’s jaw clenched. So she already had a rebound lined up.

"Sir… did you finalize the divorce today?" his secretary hesitantly asked.

"Obviously. Why would I delay?"

"It’s just… today is the young madam’s birthday."

Nathan froze.

In the back of the Rolls-Royce, Sebastian Kingsley gently squeezed his sister’s hand.

"Dominic arranged fireworks tonight to celebrate your homecoming."

"I don’t feel like celebrating," Evelyn whispered.

No longer Anna Brown, the discarded wife—she was Evelyn Carter again, heiress of Monarch Group. She buried her face in her brother’s shoulder and sobbed.

Her phone buzzed. The last message from Victoria glared up at her:

[You stole Nathan from me. I always said I’d take him back. He’s mine. Stay away.]

Evelyn laughed through her tears.

"What’s wrong?" Sebastian asked, tightening his embrace. "Do you still miss him after everything?"

"Seb… it’s my birthday today."

"I know. And Nathan chose today to destroy you."

"Which is why I have no regrets." She wiped her eyes. "Nathan didn’t just divorce me. He killed Evelyn Carter."

When she opened her eyes again, the grief was gone.

Only cold resolve remained.

"I’m done with him," she said, her voice steady. "I’d rather die than go back."
###Chapter 2

Victoria Sterling was Mrs. Blackwood's niece, so she stayed for a cozy family dinner at Cliffside Manor.

Nathan Blackwood was the only one who seemed displeased. His appetite had vanished the moment Evelyn Carter left with Sebastian Kingsley.

She hadn’t taken a single thing with her—not his $20 million compensation, not even the divorce papers.

"Where’s Evelyn? Why isn’t she joining us for dinner?" Leonard Blackwood, Nathan’s father, asked in surprise.

Nathan lowered his gaze. "We’ve already signed the divorce papers. I’ll finalize it as soon as possible."

Leonard was stunned. "Divorce? Why?!"

"Oh, Leonard, I told you ages ago that Nathan and Evelyn were never a good match," Penelope Whitmore, Nathan’s stepmother, sighed. "Your father forced them into this marriage. That poor girl suffered for three years. Now that she’s letting go, they can both move on. Honestly, it’s for the best. You know Nathan has always loved Victoria."

"Nathan, marriage isn’t a game. Evelyn—"

"Dad, it’s done. She’s already gone," Nathan snapped, frustration tightening his jaw.

Cassandra Blackwood, Nathan’s half-sister, smirked. "Wow, I never thought that country girl had the guts to leave. Is she playing the victim now? Going to tell everyone how badly we treated her?"

Nathan’s temper flared at her words.

"Nathan, you’re being reckless. Your grandfather is still ill. How are you going to explain this to him without upsetting him?" Leonard fretted, worried about his father’s reaction.

"I’ll tell him the truth. And next month, I’ll publicly announce my relationship with Victoria."

Victoria gazed at Nathan’s sharp profile, utterly smitten.

"That’s absurd!" Leonard exclaimed. "Your reputation will be ruined if people find out you abandoned your wife of three years!"

"I never cared about my reputation," Nathan said coldly. "And I never loved Evelyn." There wasn’t a hint of regret in his voice.

"Uncle Leonard, don’t blame Nathan. It’s all my fault," Victoria murmured, resting her head against Nathan’s broad shoulder. "I shouldn’t have come back. I’ll return to Silvercrest tomorrow. Nathan, you should reconcile with Evelyn. I don’t want to be the reason you two split."

"Victoria, none of this is your fault."

Nathan’s grip on her delicate hand tightened, his voice dark. "Evelyn and I are over. You’ve waited for me for three years—I won’t make you suffer another day."

The night breeze was crisp and invigorating.

Sebastian had taken Evelyn out on a yacht along Starlight River to admire the city’s dazzling skyline.

"Seb, are you mocking me?" Evelyn grumbled, eyeing the couples around them. "This is a notorious dating spot! I never come here because of all the PDA."

Sebastian smirked, checking his watch with effortless elegance. "Blame your second brother for that. He said he’d set off fireworks at exactly 8 p.m."

"Five, four, three, two, one—"

Boom!

A spectacular burst of purple and red fireworks exploded across the sky.

The young couples on the deck quickly dispersed toward the riverbank.

"Show-off," Evelyn muttered, shaking her head—but she was touched.

"Considering the bizarre gifts he’s given you over the years, this is a massive improvement," Sebastian teased, pulling her close. "Evelyn, you have so many people who love you. Focus on that instead."

Her nose tingled with emotion.

Just then, a sleek Maybach pulled up by the roadside.

Nathan stepped out with Victoria clinging to his arm. The night air was chilly, and she pressed herself against his chest.

"Wow, those fireworks are gorgeous! Nathan, look!"

Victoria was always so sweet and innocent around him—exactly what he adored. Evelyn, in contrast, had been dull and uninteresting. The only thing she’d ever offered was blind obedience, and to Nathan, that meant nothing.

As they reached the railing, the fireworks formed the words: Happy Birthday!

"Oh, it’s someone’s birthday! Who’s lucky enough to get such a grand gift?" Victoria sighed enviously.

Nathan’s lips thinned.

It was Evelyn’s birthday. Had Sebastian arranged this for her?

Then, a familiar, melodic voice reached his ears.

A yacht glided past, and there, standing on the deck, were Evelyn and Sebastian.

"Huh? Isn’t that Evelyn?" Victoria blinked innocently. "Who’s that man with her? They look… close."

Nathan’s grip on the railing turned white-knuckled.

I knew it. The divorce isn’t even final, and she’s already throwing herself at another man. What was all that crying about earlier?

After circling the bay twice, the yacht docked.

As the crowd thinned, Sebastian guided Evelyn down the steps, his arm around her waist.

"Evelyn Carter!"

Evelyn stiffened at the sound of her name.

She turned slowly to see Nathan striding toward her under the dim streetlights. His striking features still stole her breath—but her thirteen years of foolish devotion were over. He’d shattered her heart completely.

"Who is he?" Nathan’s voice was icy.

"Mr. Blackwood, your memory fails you," Sebastian said smoothly, flashing a charming smile. "We’ve met several times—rivals in the industry, remember?"

"Evelyn, answer me." Nathan ignored Sebastian, stepping closer.

"We’re divorced, Mr. Blackwood. Who this gentleman is has nothing to do with you," Evelyn replied coolly.

Nathan’s eyes widened. He couldn’t believe the meek Evelyn would speak to him like this.

"The divorce isn’t finalized, and you’re already with someone else?"

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. This bastard has the audacity to act righteous when he cheated first?

He moved forward, but Evelyn stopped him.

Nathan’s irritation flared—she was defending another man.

"Mr. Blackwood, the divorce isn’t final, but you couldn’t wait to bring your lover home. I didn’t say a word about that, so what right do you have to question who I’m with?"

Her dark hair swayed in the wind, her red lips curling into a mocking smile. She looked breathtakingly bold—nothing like the submissive wife he’d known.

"Don’t you think that’s a double standard?"

Nathan was speechless.

Victoria, who had lost sight of Nathan earlier, finally caught up. Spotting him with Evelyn, she stomped her high heels in frustration—only to twist her ankle and collapse with a dramatic cry.

"Ah! Nathan! My ankle—it hurts so much!"

Nathan snapped out of his daze and rushed to help her up.

When he turned back, Evelyn and Sebastian were gone.
###Chapter 3

The sleek Rolls-Royce glided through the gilded gates of Willow Creek Estate, the sprawling residence of the Kingsley family in Fairhaven.

The car came to a smooth halt atop the plush red carpet unfurled at the grand entrance. Standing at the center, waiting with an easy grin, was Dominic Kingsley—Evelyn’s second brother. He pulled open the car door with a flourish.

"Welcome home, Princess."

Under the dazzling chandeliers of the mansion, Evelyn looked every inch the regal heiress. She had swapped her sneakers for stilettos during the ride, and now, stepping out, she carried herself with effortless grace.

"Dom, how’ve you been?"

"Better now that you’re back," he said, eyes gleaming. "Did you see the fireworks? My birthday gift for you broke the internet."

Evelyn clapped her hands together, laughing. "Oh, I saw. People are calling you a shameless billionaire with a flair for dramatics. Quite the reputation you’re building."

Dominic ignored her teasing and pulled her into a tight embrace.

"You’re not leaving again, are you?"

She exhaled, patting his back. "Where would I go? I’m officially divorced."

For a moment, the weight of failure pressed down on her. She had poured everything into that marriage, only to walk away empty-handed. The sting of humiliation burned, but she refused to let it show.

Nathan Blackwood wasn’t worth another tear.

"That bastard!" Dominic snarled, his usual charm replaced by cold fury. "Cheating on my sister? I’ll have Blackwood Industries audited by sunrise. And if that doesn’t ruin him, I’ll send Maxwell to handle him personally."

Sebastian, standing nearby, lowered his gaze and murmured, "Amen."

"Dom, you’re a prosecutor!" Evelyn groaned. "Can’t you be more… diplomatic, like Seb?"

"Diplomatic?" Dominic scoffed, yanking at his tie. "Seb only turned into a saint after leaving the mafia! I don’t care—no one humiliates a Kingsley and walks away unscathed."

Evelyn looped her arms through her brothers’ as they escorted her inside.

Meanwhile, Harrison Kingsley—patriarch of Monarch Group—paced his study like an excited schoolboy upon hearing his daughter had returned.

"Dad, I’m home!"

Evelyn strode into the study, shedding the demure facade she’d worn among the Blackwoods. Now, she flopped onto the sofa, kicked off her heels, and propped her feet up.

Sebastian sat beside her, massaging her tired feet without a word.

"Must you sit like a heathen?" Harrison grumbled, though his eyes sparkled with affection. "Did Doctors Without Borders teach you nothing?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Alzheimer’s setting in already? I’ve always sat like this."

Her gaze drifted to the wall, where a framed poem—her teenage handwriting—hung prominently.

Were you trying to outdo Henry VIII with your wives?
Here’s hoping your heart doesn’t give out before you pay the price.

A wedding "gift" she’d given him after his third marriage.

Harrison had four wives—a fact that had once driven Evelyn to flee abroad.

"Three years in war zones, and the first thing you do is insult me?" Harrison huffed.

"Compliments are my love language," Evelyn chirped.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Now that Evelyn’s back, we should discuss succession. I’m stepping down as Monarch Group’s CEO."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

Harrison sputtered. "What?"

"My three-year term is up," Sebastian said serenely. "My calling is the church, not the boardroom."

"Fine! Then Dominic can take over!"

Dominic paled. "Absolutely not! I’m a public servant—I’d be suspended for conflict of interest!"

Harrison groaned. What was the point of having sons if none wanted the empire?

Evelyn smirked. "I’ll do it."

"You?" Harrison scoffed. "CEOs aren’t crowned on whims. Do you even know how to run a company?"

"Dad," Sebastian interjected, "remember the financial crisis four years ago? Evelyn drafted the recovery plan. And the Walter Group acquisition? She negotiated it."

Harrison blinked.

Dominic nodded. "She’s the smartest one here. Why not give her a shot?"

After a long pause, Harrison sighed. "Fine. Prove yourself by turning around the Monarch Grand Hotel in Crestview within six months. Succeed, and the CEO title is yours."

As they left the study, Sebastian and Dominic squeezed Evelyn’s shoulders.

"God tests those He favors," Sebastian said solemnly.

Dominic winced. "That hotel’s a disaster."

Evelyn grinned. "Good thing I thrive under pressure."

Her brothers exchanged glances.

"Perfect," Dominic said. "Now free us from corporate prison."
###Chapter 4

Five days later, Nathan Blackwood summoned his secretary, Oliver Sinclair, to his office after breakfast.

"Did you uncover anything new about Evelyn?"

The man stood facing the floor-to-ceiling window, his imposing silhouette casting a shadow over the glittering skyline of Crestview. His broad shoulders and towering frame radiated an aura of unshakable authority.

Oliver wiped his brow nervously. "I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwood. There's been no progress."

After the young Mrs. Blackwood left that night, she hadn’t returned to the nursing home where she used to work. I personally went to Fairhaven, her supposed hometown, but the address she gave was fabricated. The Carter family doesn’t exist there."

Nathan spun around abruptly, his dark eyes flashing with fury. "The address was fake?"

"Yes. I even checked with the local authorities, but they found no records matching her description."

Oliver had referred to Evelyn as "Mrs. Blackwood" for three years, and breaking the habit wasn’t easy.

Nathan’s mind reeled. Who the hell did I marry? A ghost?

"She left with Sebastian Kingsley that night. Did you find anything through him?"

"If Mr. Kingsley is determined to hide her, we won’t uncover anything easily."

The words hide her made Nathan’s jaw tighten.

"Sebastian Kingsley has always been a man of principle. Why would he steal my wife?"

"Well… technically, it’s not stealing. More like… inheriting the mess you left behind."

Nathan’s glare could have shattered glass. Oliver swallowed hard, instantly regretting his choice of words.

The memory of Sebastian shielding Evelyn that night burned in Nathan’s mind. The way Sebastian looked at her—protective, possessive—was unmistakable.

It shouldn’t have bothered him. But it did.

How had his dull, obedient wife ensnared a man like Sebastian Kingsley? The man was infamous in elite circles for his icy detachment. So why had he stepped in for her?

Nathan recalled Evelyn’s plea the night they signed the divorce papers.

"Nathan, can’t we stay married? Because I love you!"

Lies. All of it. His fingers curled into fists.

The more he dwelled on it, the hotter his anger burned.

Just then, his phone buzzed on the desk.

Nathan glanced at the screen—Victoria Sterling. He answered immediately.

"Victoria, what is it?"

"Nathan, I’m in your lobby. Can you escort me up? I made your favorite pastries, and I want you to try them while they’re still warm."

Her saccharine tone made Oliver suppress a shudder.

"You’re here?" Nathan frowned.

"Yes. Don’t tell me you’re not happy to see me?"

"Of course I am. I’ll send someone down."

After hanging up, Nathan exhaled sharply.

The divorce wasn’t finalized yet, and the news hadn’t gone public. Victoria showing up now could stir unnecessary rumors—even if he could handle the fallout.

His phone buzzed again.

Nathan’s stomach dropped when he saw the caller ID.

"Yes, Grandfather?"

"You insolent brat!" Reginald Blackwood’s roar crackled through the speaker. "Did you forget everything I told you? You swore you’d cut ties with that Sterling girl after marrying Evelyn! And now you’re parading her around your office? I don’t care about your reputation—think about how Evelyn would feel! Get your ass over here NOW!"

The air in the Blackwood estate’s study was thick with tension.

Reginald sat stiffly in his chair, his cane gripped like a weapon. His face was stormy, his breathing uneven. Beside him, Leonard Blackwood—Nathan’s father—shot his son a warning look.

Nathan stood rigidly before them. Victoria had been barred from entering. "That scheming viper isn’t welcome under my roof," Reginald had snarled.

"Explain yourself!" Reginald slammed his cane down.

Leonard intervened quickly. "Father, please, your blood pressure—"

"Grandfather, our three-year contract ended," Nathan said coolly. "You promised me—marry Evelyn for three years, and after that, the choice was mine. I’ve chosen to end it."

Reginald paled as if struck.

Evelyn had been his daily companion for three years. Her absence had left a void he hadn’t realized until now.

Nathan continued, indifferent. "I’m divorcing her to be with the woman I love. Evelyn already signed the papers. It’s done."

"Done?!" Reginald shot up, trembling. "You’re throwing her away like some used toy?"

Leonard steadied him. "Father, they’ve only signed the papers. The divorce isn’t finalized yet. Calm down—your health—"

"Damn it! I already have a worthless daughter-in-law. Must I lose the only granddaughter-in-law I actually liked?"

Nathan flinched. Leonard sighed, caught in the crossfire.

"I want Evelyn back! Find her! I can’t eat, I can’t sleep—I won’t accept anyone else!" Reginald’s voice cracked with uncharacteristic vulnerability.

Leonard shot Nathan a pointed look. "Call her. Bring her here."

Nathan shook his head. "It’s pointless, Grandfather. Even if I drag her back now, our marriage is over."

He needed to sever this cleanly. Time would fade his grandfather’s attachment.

Reginald’s knees buckled.

Nathan and Leonard lunged forward just as the old man collapsed.

Panic surged as they called for the doctor. Nathan, desperate, dialed Evelyn’s number—only to hear the automated reply: "The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

She’d vanished. Erased herself completely.

Nathan’s vision burned red. His fists clenched so tight his knuckles whitened.

Meanwhile, at Monarch Grand Hotel, executives gathered at the entrance, awaiting their new general manager.

"Rumor has it she’s young. A woman."

"Another sacrificial lamb. Four managers couldn’t turn this place around. What makes her think she can?"

"Word is she’s Harrison Kingsley’s daughter."

"Probably some illegitimate child he’s dumping here to fail. Why else send her to this disaster?"

Snickers rippled through the crowd.

"She’s here!"

A sleek Rolls-Royce glided to a stop, followed by a convoy of Maybachs. The license plate—9999—silenced the murmurs instantly.

A stiletto-clad foot stepped out first.

Then, the woman herself.

Tall, poised, with raven hair cascading over her shoulders, she surveyed the crowd with piercing eyes that made them shrink back.

"Good morning," she said, her voice smooth as velvet.

A smile curved her lips—sharp, knowing.

"I’m your new general manager. And no, I’m not illegitimate. Sorry to disappoint."

The gossiping employees froze, sweat beading on their brows.

Minutes earlier, from the car, Evelyn had hacked into the hotel’s surveillance cameras.

She’d heard every word.
###Chapter 5

The senior executives froze, their faces turning crimson as they were caught gossiping about their new boss.

"That's outrageous! Ms. Carter is the only legitimate heir of the Kingsley family! What were they thinking?" Theodore Winslow, Sebastian's secretary, fumed from the passenger seat.

"Legitimacy doesn't matter anymore. We're not living in the Dark Ages! Why are you so worked up, Theo?"

Evelyn narrowed her bright eyes and pinched Theodore's cheek playfully. His face flushed instantly.

"Evelyn, you're about to become the CEO of Monarch Group. Could you at least act the part? Stop harassing Theo." Sebastian sighed, though his expression remained fond.

"What's the big deal? No one bats an eye when a male boss flirts with his female secretary!"

Evelyn clicked her tongue and smirked. "Besides, he should be honored I even bothered."

Sebastian shook his head, watching his sister with amusement.

The Kingsley siblings stepped into the hotel, flanked by nervous executives.

Vincent Prescott, the hotel's vice president, gestured toward the VIP elevator, but Evelyn cut him off. "I want to inspect the restaurant first."

She wasted no time, diving straight into her assessment the moment they entered.

Vincent led them to the restaurant, his hands trembling slightly.

Sebastian remained composed, letting his sister take charge, though his presence was impossible to ignore.

The restaurant was empty before the lunch rush, but staff were already prepping dishes at the counter.

Evelyn's sharp gaze swept over the food before landing on the live seafood display.

Without hesitation, she rolled up her sleeve, plunged her hand into the aquarium, and plucked out a dead shrimp from the swarm.

"Explain."

"It—it's not dead!" Vincent stammered.

"If it's not dead, then eat it." Evelyn's red lips curled into a dangerous smile.

"Ms. Kingsley, with so many shrimp, a few dead ones are inevitable—"

"It's normal for shrimp to die. But is it normal for a guest to eat a dead one and get food poisoning?"

Her smile vanished. "Also, there are exactly 356 shrimp in this tank. I counted five dead and at least thirty half-dead. How would you feel paying $100 per person for this?"

She leaned in, her voice icy. "Check every ingredient in the seafood section immediately and fire the supplier. If I see another dead shrimp tomorrow, you’ll be eating them in front of me."

Vincent paled, his legs wobbling. The other executives exchanged horrified glances.

Only Sebastian and Theodore knew Evelyn had a photographic memory. As a child, she'd even helped solve a major criminal case with it. Counting shrimp was nothing.

Next, they moved to the guest rooms. Evelyn took a white handkerchief from Theodore and wiped the wall and picture frame.

"Redo the cleaning. There's still dust."

The executives exchanged uneasy looks.

"I know what you're thinking—that I'm being unreasonable, nitpicking over nothing."

Evelyn's tone turned deadly serious. "This hotel has stood for a century. It's the overlooked details that ruin reputations. If the star-rating committee inspects us, these 'small' issues will cost us our rating."

She glanced at Theodore, who immediately ordered, "Open this room."

The housekeeping manager hesitated. Previous inspections only involved sample rooms.

But Evelyn didn’t follow rules.

She strode inside, checked the bathroom, then sat on the bed—and her expression darkened.

Without a word, she ended the inspection and headed to the general manager’s office with Sebastian.

"So? What’s the verdict?" Sebastian asked, amused.

"An absolute disaster!"

Evelyn slumped onto the sofa, sighing. "Is Harrison testing me or mocking me? This place is a disgrace! I can’t believe it’s part of Monarch Group!"

"Evelyn, Grandfather built this hotel. It was the foundation of our empire. It’s not a disaster—it’s our family’s legacy. But with Monarch’s expansion and the hotel industry’s decline, we neglected it."

Sebastian sighed. "I’m sorry. You’ll have to clean up this mess."

Then Evelyn spotted the grand piano in the corner and gasped.

"I had it moved here. I remember you used to play when you were upset."

Sebastian smiled. "You’ll be too busy for horseback riding, but maybe the piano will help."

"Thanks, Seb. But I haven’t played in years."

Her throat tightened. An old wound burned in her chest.

"Why not?" Sebastian frowned.

"During my time with Doctors Without Borders, I injured my hand rescuing wounded soldiers. Torn ligament in my pinky. Can’t manage an octave anymore."

She forced a calm tone, but Sebastian’s heart ached. He took her hand.

"Was it because of Nathan?"

"Partly."

Just hearing his name made her chest constrict. But she forced a smile. "I got hurt for world peace. Making the family proud, right?"

Five years ago, on the battlefields of Eldermere, she’d reunited with Nathan—the man she’d loved.

She was a field doctor. He was a peacekeeper.

She’d nearly lost her hand dragging his wounded body to safety.

Back then, she’d called it honor. Now, her numb pinky was just a reminder of heartbreak.

But she wouldn’t cry. She wouldn’t regret loving the wrong man.

Theodore knocked and entered urgently.

"Ms. Evelyn, I checked the bedding suppliers as you asked. It’s Luxe Furnishings—and Mr. Prescott handles them."

"Luxe Furnishings?"

Evelyn crossed her legs, eyes glinting dangerously. "Audit the hotel’s finances for the past two years. Then fire Luxe and find a new supplier."

"That’s drastic," Sebastian remarked.

"Luxe is owned by Nathan’s sweetheart’s brother."

"Ah. Personal vendetta?" Sebastian and Theodore said in unison.

"No! Their bedding is cheap garbage. I’m just upholding standards!"

She scowled, remembering the lumpy mattress. No wonder the reviews were terrible.

"Theodore added, "Mr. Sebastian asked me to monitor the Blackwoods. Reginald Blackwood was hospitalized for a stroke—at Kingsley Medical Center."

"Grandfather’s in the hospital?!" Evelyn shot to her feet.

Then Sebastian’s phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and smirked.

"Evelyn. It’s your ex-husband."
###Chapter 6

Sebastian's phone buzzed with Nathan Blackwood's name flashing across the screen.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Should I answer?" Sebastian asked, arching an eyebrow.

"Go ahead."

He tapped the speaker button.

"Mr. Kingsley, is my wife with you?" Nathan's voice was rough, strained.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. Wife? The audacity.

"Mr. Blackwood," she cut in, voice icy. "Watch your words. I'm your ex-wife now."

"Evelyn Carter!" Nathan's tone darkened. "So you are with him."

"Where else would I be?" She laughed bitterly. "Should I have stayed at Cliffside Manor, waiting for you to throw me out?"

His silence was heavy.

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Stop being dramatic. The divorce isn't finalized yet. Legally, you're still my wife. At least consider Blackwood Industries' reputation—and your own!"

"You carried Victoria Sterling into our home while we were married," Evelyn snapped. "You forced me to sign those papers. Did you ever care about my feelings?"

Sebastian sipped his tea, watching his sister with quiet pride.

This was the real Evelyn—fiery, unapologetic. The meek, obedient wife she'd pretended to be for three years? Gone.

"I don't have time for this," Nathan muttered, exhaustion creeping into his voice. "Grandfather's in the hospital. He won't take his medicine until he sees you."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Reginald Blackwood had been the only light in that house. The only one who treated her like family.

"Kingsley Medical Center?" she asked quietly.

"Yes."

"I'll be there."

The call ended. Sebastian stood. "I'll drive you."

"No." Evelyn shook her head. "This isn't about Nathan. It's about Reginald. If you come, it'll just escalate things."

She grabbed her keys and left.

The hospital corridor was too bright.

Nathan and Oliver Sinclair stood guard outside Reginald's room.

Evelyn barely glanced at Nathan, though she noticed—damn it—how tired he looked. Thinner.

Not my problem.

Oliver gaped. "Young Madam? Is that... you?"

Evelyn blinked. She'd forgotten to swap her power suit for the demure dresses Nathan preferred.

"In the flesh. Do you hate it?"

"No! You look... incredible."

She smirked. "Divorce suits me."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "If my house was so terrible, why stay for three years?"

"Because I made a promise to Reginald." Her smile was razor-sharp. "But congratulations, Nathan. You're free now. No more sneaking around with Victoria."

Before he could retort, heels clicked down the hall.

Victoria and Penelope Whitmore hurried over.

"Nathan!" Victoria flung herself into his arms. "Why didn't you tell me? I was so worried!"

Penelope sighed. "She vomited from stress. You know how her stomach gets."

Nathan's voice softened. "I'll find her a specialist."

Evelyn turned away, remembering the time she'd dragged herself to the hospital with a fever. Nathan hadn't even texted.

He knows how to care. Just not for me.

Victoria shot her a venomous look, then froze.

That brooch—the Celestial Tear—was Alexa's latest masterpiece. Worth millions. How did Evelyn afford it?

The ward door opened. Marcus Underwood stepped out.

"Mr. Blackwood is asking for his granddaughter-in-law."

Victoria stiffened.

Evelyn moved forward.

"Both of you," Marcus added, nodding at Nathan.

Victoria lunged. "Wait—"

Marcus blocked her. "Family only."

The door shut behind Evelyn, sealing Victoria's glare outside.
###Chapter 7

The moment Evelyn stepped into the hospital room, Reginald Blackwood's frail appearance transformed. His dull eyes brightened instantly.

"Evelyn! Come here, my dear!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn switched into her dutiful granddaughter-in-law persona, settling gracefully beside him.

"Grandfather, how are you feeling? Are you in any pain?"

"All my aches vanish when I see you," he murmured, gripping her hand with surprising strength. His expression darkened. "Nathan told me the two of you are divorced. Is it true?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered, her chest hollow. "Yes, Grandfather. We are."

Reginald's frail body trembled with fury as he turned on Nathan. "You fool! How could you let go of such a perfect wife? Evelyn is everything a man could want!"

Nathan remained silent, unwilling to agitate his grandfather further.

Evelyn softened her voice, gently rubbing the old man's back. "Please don't be angry. It was my decision. Nathan simply respected my wishes."

Nathan's brows furrowed. He had expected her to manipulate the situation, to use his grandfather as leverage against him.

Was this another ploy? A twisted way to make me reconsider?

"Evelyn," Reginald rasped, distress lining his face. "Did they mistreat you? Did Penelope make your life unbearable?"

"No, Grandfather. Nathan and I simply grew apart. Love shouldn't be forced."

Her luminous eyes held a quiet sorrow. "Don't blame him. We had three years of beautiful memories. That's enough for me."

Nathan stiffened.

Beautiful memories?

Their marriage had been a cold transaction—no ceremony, no celebration. Just a signature at the courthouse and a silent ride to Cliffside Manor.

Had she truly cherished those years? Or was this another calculated act?

"Evelyn… Did I make a mistake?" Reginald's voice cracked with regret. "I only wanted your happiness. I never imagined this ungrateful boy would—"

"Don't say that," Evelyn interrupted gently. "Some things aren't meant to be."

She had released thirteen years of unrequited love. The pain of letting go was hers alone to bear.

"Marcus!" Reginald called suddenly. "Bring me the gift!"

His assistant produced an exquisite velvet box. Inside lay an antique jade bracelet, its emerald hue glowing under the light.

Evelyn recognized its value instantly—a priceless heirloom, centuries old.

"Grandfather, isn't that Grandmother's?" Nathan's voice was tight.

"Yes. The very one I gave her when we were young." Reginald's fingers traced the jade lovingly. "She always said it was her favorite. She wanted it to go to the woman who captured my grandson's heart."

His gaze settled on Evelyn. "And that woman is you."

Evelyn recoiled. "I can't accept this. Not anymore."

"Then I'll shatter it." Reginald raised his arm dramatically.

"No!" She caught his wrist, pulse racing. "I'll take it. Thank you."

The bracelet slid onto her slender wrist, the jade enhancing her porcelain skin.

Nathan found himself staring. He'd never noticed how delicate her hands were.

"What did you give her for her birthday?" Reginald demanded.

Nathan's jaw clenched.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Nathan gave me an unforgettable gift."

The divorce papers.

Clever, Nathan thought bitterly. Always so sharp with your words.

"Evelyn," Reginald pleaded, "is there truly no hope?"

She cupped his wrinkled hands. "If you love me, let me choose my own path."

Reginald exhaled shakily. "Then grant me one request. Wait until after my birthday to finalize the divorce. Just a few more weeks."

"Grandfather—" Nathan began.

"Is it too much to ask?" Reginald snapped. "Or would you rather parade that Victoria woman in front of me instead?"

Outside the door, Victoria seethed.

"Stop pacing," Penelope hissed. "That old man won't live forever."

Victoria gritted her teeth. "But if he doesn't die soon—"

"Patience. As long as Nathan loves you, nothing else matters."

The door opened.

Victoria's eyes locked onto the jade bracelet—stunning, radiant. That should have been mine.

With a calculated stumble, she lunged at Evelyn.

Evelyn sidestepped gracefully.

Victoria crashed to the floor—and her own bracelet shattered.
###Chapter 8

"Oh my God! Evelyn, are you okay?" Penelope gasped, feigning concern while her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

Nathan immediately stepped forward to help Victoria up from the floor, but she stubbornly refused to move.

Tears welled up in Victoria's eyes as she whimpered, "Nathan, it hurts so much. Will you carry me?"

Her knees throbbed from the impact, but her pride hurt more.

Evelyn crossed her arms, watching the scene unfold with amusement.

Victoria was putting on quite the performance for Nathan's benefit.

"Nathan, Ms. Carter pushed me!" Victoria buried her face in Nathan's chest, then shot Evelyn a venomous glare.

"Victoria, what did you just say?" Nathan frowned, taken aback.

"Are you sure I pushed you?" Evelyn smirked, unfazed. She wasn’t angry—if anything, she was entertained by Victoria’s theatrics.

"Why else would I suddenly fall?" Victoria’s voice rose, her usual sweet tone sharpening with indignation.

"Not impossible," Evelyn mused. "You do look like a strong breeze could knock you over."

"How dare you!" Victoria’s face flushed crimson. "I felt your hand shove me from behind! Why won’t you admit it?"

"Ms. Sterling," Evelyn’s eyes darkened dangerously, "there are surveillance cameras everywhere. Stop trying to frame me. I could sue you for defamation once I pull the footage."

Nathan blinked, startled. This wasn’t the Evelyn he knew—the quiet, obedient wife who waited alone in Cliffside Manor.

Victoria, sensing she was losing, turned to Penelope for help.

"Oh, it’s all just a misunderstanding!" Penelope laughed nervously, glancing at the camera above them. "Victoria must have slipped because she wasn’t standing properly. She probably bumped into Evelyn and thought she was pushed!"

"Victoria," Nathan’s voice turned cold, "did you slip on your own?"

"I—I thought she pushed me..."

Nathan narrowed his eyes.

Flustered, Victoria lashed out. "If she hadn’t been in the way, I wouldn’t have fallen! She did it on purpose! And now my grandmother’s bracelet—a Blackwood heirloom—is broken! If it weren’t for her—"

She dissolved into dramatic sobs again.

Evelyn sighed. This woman had an endless supply of tears.

"First of all," Evelyn cut in, "I’m not upset about the divorce. In fact, I should thank you for freeing me from that prison. No more waiting like a discarded wife."

"Waiting?" Nathan frowned.

"Second," Evelyn picked up the broken bracelet and examined it under the light, "if this is a family heirloom, you should be thanking me."

She tossed it into the trash. "It’s fake. And filled with toxic glue—terrible for your health."

The emerald bracelet on Evelyn’s wrist gleamed mockingly.

"Mr. Blackwood, if you’re marrying Ms. Sterling, at least buy her real jewelry."

"Evelyn!" Nathan snapped.

"There’s a jade toad on my vanity at Cliffside Manor," Evelyn added sweetly. "I think it suits you, Victoria. You can turn it into a bracelet if you like."

A toad?! Victoria seethed. This woman was insulting her!

Before Victoria could retaliate, Evelyn strode away.

Outside the hospital, Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at the memory of Victoria’s furious expression.

"Evelyn!"

Nathan’s deep voice made her pause. She turned, the breeze tousling her dark hair, adding a wild edge to her elegance.

Nathan approached, his gaze intense. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn’s expression was unreadable. "If Ms. Sterling is still upset about her bracelet, tell her I’ll send her a truckload tomorrow."

"Earlier, in the ward, you told Grandfather—"

"Don’t overthink it," Evelyn interrupted. "I just didn’t want to upset Reginald." Her eyes softened slightly at the mention of him.

"We’re even now."

Evelyn blinked. "Excuse me?"

"You faked your identity to marry me. I won’t tell Grandfather or anyone else." Nathan’s voice was low, dangerous. "But you will tell me why."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

"No," Nathan corrected himself. "Not why you married me. Why did you use a false identity to get close to him?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She stepped back—

And forgot about the stairs behind her.

She stumbled, but Nathan’s hand shot out, catching her waist.

Their eyes locked. Evelyn’s cheeks warmed. Nathan’s breathing grew uneven.

Even now, she still found him devastatingly handsome.

She remembered the first time she saw those piercing eyes—thirteen years ago, when she was lost in a storm.

Nathan had saved her life.

Now, he’d shattered her heart.

Nathan released her abruptly.

"Thanks."

"Answer my question."

"I’m not your wife anymore. I don’t owe you anything."

Evelyn turned to leave, but Nathan grabbed her arm.

"The divorce isn’t finalized. Legally, you’re still my wife. You will tell me who you really are."

"No."

Evelyn’s eyes burned. "You want to talk about obligations? You never acted like a husband for three years. What right do you have to demand anything from me?"

"Evelyn," Nathan growled, yanking her close, "don’t test me."

Their breaths mingled.

Nathan rarely lost his temper, but this woman—

She infuriated him.

"Then investigate me yourself." Evelyn wrenched free and walked away.

Nathan watched her go, his chest tight.

Her crimson lips. Those lethal heels.

Who was she dressing like this for? Sebastian Kingsley?

"Mr. Blackwood!" Oliver rushed over. "Ms. Sterling says she’s sprained her ankle. She wants you to accompany her."

A roar of an engine cut through the air.

Nathan turned—

And froze.

Evelyn slid into a sleek black Bugatti La Voiture Noire, the epitome of power and luxury.

She drove past him without a glance.

Oliver gaped. "Damn. The ex-Mrs. Blackwood is loaded."

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

"Follow her."
###Chapter 9

Evelyn gripped the steering wheel with one hand, speeding down the winding road. The speakers blared Survivor by Destiny’s Child, the bass thumping in time with her racing heart.

She wasn’t afraid of Nathan digging into her past. What she couldn’t fathom was why a man who had ignored her for three years suddenly cared—only after their divorce.

Nathan Blackwood was infuriating. When she had loved him, he’d looked at her with disdain. Now that she was indifferent, he wouldn’t leave her alone.

Her frown deepened as she glanced at the rearview mirror.

Nathan’s Lamborghini was tailing her, relentless.

Hah. He thinks he can keep up with me?

A smirk curled her lips as she slammed the gas pedal.

Her Bugatti roared forward like a bullet, vanishing around the next curve in seconds.

"Faster, Oliver!" Nathan barked from the passenger seat.

Oliver Sinclair had never driven like this before. His knuckles whitened on the wheel, heart hammering against his ribs. He barely caught a glimpse of the Bugatti’s taillights before they disappeared again.

Nathan’s expression remained cold, but relief flickered in his eyes.

"Mr. Blackwood, the young madam drives like a pro! No wonder she has that Fujiwara Tofu Shop sticker!" Oliver couldn’t help but admire.

"What tofu shop?" Nathan’s brow furrowed.

"Check her bumper!"

Nathan’s glare turned glacial. Oliver swallowed hard. "I—I meant her car bumper, sir!"

Nathan leaned forward, spotting the white decal on the Bugatti’s rear: Fujiwara Tofu Shop (AE86).

It was almost… amusing.

"You didn’t know? The young madam loves anime, especially Initial D. That show was always playing in the living room whenever I saw her."

Oliver grinned. "Who knew she could drive like that? I always thought she was some delicate flower."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. He’d been fooled too.

What stung worse? His secretary knew more about his wife than he did.

"Shit—she’s pulling away!"

"Don’t lose her, or I’ll deduct your entire bonus," Nathan growled, his sculpted features sharp with frustration.

Oliver sweated, torn between his paycheck and his survival instinct.

Two sharp turns later, Evelyn’s car was gone.

"I lost her," Oliver admitted weakly.

Nathan slammed his fist against the window, veins bulging at his temple.

Evelyn… what are you hiding? Who are you really?

That night, Sebastian and Dominic Kingsley arrived at their sister’s private villa.

The brothers moved around the open kitchen, cooking while Evelyn lounged on the couch, gaming. A lollipop dangled from her lips as she watched them.

"Woohoo! Perfect score!"

She grinned at the screen, clapping her hands triumphantly.

"Still got it, huh?" Dominic flashed his signature charming smile—the one that made women swoon.

"Look at that leaderboard! Untouchable!"

Evelyn knelt on the chair, swinging the lollipop like a wand.

Dominic scoffed. "Oh, please. Let’s play. I’ll wipe that smug look off your face."

"She’s lapped you so many times your name doesn’t even show up anymore," Sebastian deadpanned, feeding her a piece of steak.

"Only because Maxwell bailed last minute! We would’ve crushed you!" Dominic crossed his arms.

"I’ll start cooking. Ev, you should wait in the living room—you’re allergic to smoke." Sebastian’s voice softened.

Evelyn froze.

Her chest ached.

She hadn’t told them. For three years, she’d cooked for the Blackwoods despite her allergy. Three years of inhaling fumes until her body stopped reacting. Three years of calloused hands.

If they knew… Sebastian might restrain himself, but her other brothers? They’d dismantle the Blackwood empire brick by brick.

Evelyn was the Kingsleys’ princess. They’d never let her lift a finger. The thought of her scrubbing floors for Nathan’s family would enrage them.

But she was home now. And she swore—never again would she debase herself for a man who didn’t love her.

Sebastian’s phone rang.

He wiped his hands on his apron and checked the screen. His gaze flicked to Evelyn, unreadable.

"Ev… it’s your ex-husband. Again."

"What the hell? Does he think he owns you?" Evelyn’s face flushed, the lollipop clattering onto the table.

Dominic snatched it up, popping it into his mouth like it was nothing. "Wait—that bastard’s harassing you now?"

Sebastian sighed. "He probably thinks I’m your boyfriend after seeing us by Starlight River."

Dominic choked. "Is he blind?!"

Sebastian smirked. "What? Not handsome enough to be Evelyn’s man?"

"Please. You act more like her dad than her boyfriend."

Their banter warmed her, but the phone kept ringing.

"Answer it?" Sebastian asked.

Dominic snapped, "Hell no!"

Evelyn exhaled. "Do it."

Sebastian put it on speaker.

"I’m looking for my wife." Nathan’s voice was calm, possessive.

Dominic nearly lunged for the phone, but Evelyn shoved his face into the table.

"Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian said coolly, "Evelyn isn’t your wife anymore. The divorce is final." He deliberately used her fake name—Evelyn Carter—to protect her identity.

"She knows she’s still mine." Nathan’s tone dropped, icy enough to frost the room.

Evelyn grabbed the phone, switching off speaker mode. "Nathan, why were you chasing me like a madman earlier?"

"We need to talk. Privately."

She stormed into another room, slamming the door. "I’m busy. Spit it out."

"Why did you change your number?" His voice was sharp.

"Fresh start."

"How will Grandfather reach you? Give me your new number."

Evelyn laughed coldly. "Call Sebastian if you need me."

"Is this your idea of revenge?" Nathan’s voice turned venomous. "Couldn’t wait to move in with him? Or do you have another fake identity now?"

Her fists clenched. "Nathan—"

"You think this bothers me? I don’t care who you sleep with." His bitter laugh scraped her raw. "I just don’t want Grandfather to see the woman he adores is a whore. Keep your legs closed until his birthday. Don’t embarrass him."

The line went dead.

Evelyn slid down the wall, struggling to breathe.

Why did it still hurt so much? She’d promised herself she was done with him.

Tears burned, but she refused to let them fall.

Nathan… was loving you for thirteen years my biggest mistake?
###Chapter 10

At Cliffside Manor, Nathan Blackwood stood frozen for several moments after his ex-wife abruptly ended the call.

Her tone had been so icy, so final. Was this really the same woman who had once wept and pleaded with him not to sign the divorce papers?

Had she truly felt nothing for him in the past three years? Had she merely tolerated his family for some hidden motive?

The more he dwelled on it, the angrier he became.

"Mr. Blackwood, your coffee."

Oliver Sinclair entered the study, taking in his employer's stormy expression. "Did you manage to reach Ms. Carter? Did you get her new number?"

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. In his earlier fury, he had completely forgotten the purpose of his call.

He had expected to feel relief after Evelyn left. Instead, all he felt was irritation—especially knowing she was now with Sebastian Kingsley.

How dare she play with his emotions like this?

"Maybe next time. I don’t have the patience to deal with that woman right now."

He picked up the coffee and took a sip, then frowned.

"What’s wrong? Does it not taste right?"

"I followed the exact instructions Ms. Carter left behind," Oliver said, scratching his head in confusion.

"Instructions?"

"Before she left, she gave me a small notebook. It detailed all your food and drink preferences, even noting every meal you’ve had with dates and times."

As he spoke, Oliver pulled out the notebook and handed it to Nathan.

Nathan hesitated before flipping it open.

Inside, he found meticulous handwriting—just as disciplined as Evelyn had always been before the divorce.

"Add a pinch of salt to his coffee to enhance the flavor. Nathan prefers it that way."

"Nathan had two bowls of seafood chowder today. I should make it more often."

"He dislikes sweets. Next time, I’ll try cheese crackers or butter cake for tea."

"Bought him several ties last year, but he never wears the ones with red accents. Note: avoid red."

Nathan.

Nathan.

Nathan.

Every single line was about him.

His fingers tightened around the notebook as he slowly turned the pages. His breath hitched, as if afraid the words might vanish if he exhaled too harshly.

His expression darkened, his grip crumpling the paper.

"She’s been studying me like some kind of experiment. This just proves she had ulterior motives!"

Despite the strange tightness in his chest, he tossed the notebook into the wastebasket.

"Mr. Blackwood, don’t throw it away! Ms. Carter spent years compiling this. If she didn’t care, why would she bother? This proves how much she loved you!" Oliver quickly retrieved it, his heart aching for Evelyn.

"Stop calling her Ms. Carter. She doesn’t deserve the title."

Just then, a loud crash echoed from outside the study.

It came from the right wing of the corridor—where Evelyn’s old room was.

"Go see what that is," Nathan ordered, rubbing his temples.

Oliver hurried out and returned moments later, looking uneasy.

"Mr. Blackwood, it’s Ms. Sterling. She’s—"

"What’s Victoria doing?"

"She’s… clearing out everything from your ex-wife’s bedroom."

At that moment, Victoria was in the midst of a tantrum, hurling Evelyn’s belongings across the room.

"That peasant! Who does she think she is, acting so high and mighty just because the old man favored her? That stupid bracelet isn’t even worth anything!"

Since Evelyn had left with nothing, Victoria seized the opportunity to destroy what remained—shattering skincare bottles, tearing down decorations, turning the room into chaos.

Nathan walked in just as she flung open the closet.

"Victoria! What the hell are you doing?"

"I can’t stand her traces in this house!"

Victoria burst into tears when she saw him. "If it weren’t for her, we wouldn’t have lost three years together! She stole my place, and now she acts like I’m the villain!"

"You’re not a villain," Nathan said, though his voice lacked conviction.

His gaze fell on a shattered jade figurine on the floor. He bent to pick it up, surprised to find it shaped like a toad—winking and flashing a peace sign.

Against his will, his lips twitched.

Then Victoria yanked open a large box.

"What’s this?"

Inside was a finely tailored men’s suit, crafted from luxurious fabric.

"Ha! Did Evelyn make this for Sebastian? Has she already moved on to her next husband?"

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. He strode forward and snatched the box away.

"Nathan, she’s despicable! I thought she married you out of love, but she was just using you!"

Victoria’s eyes burned with fury. She grabbed a fruit knife from the coffee table and lunged at the suit.

Nathan reacted swiftly, shielding the box with his body.

The blade sliced across his forearm, staining his white shirt crimson.

Victoria gasped, the knife clattering to the floor. "Oh my God! Nathan, I—I didn’t mean to!"

She burst into hysterical sobs as Penelope Whitmore rushed in with several maids.

"What happened?!"

Penelope paled at the sight of blood dripping onto the carpet. "Nathan, how did you get hurt?"

"Oliver, arrange a car to take Ms. Sterling home," Nathan said through gritted teeth.

"Nathan, I don’t want to go! Let me stay and take care of you!" Victoria clung to him desperately.

"She should stay," Penelope insisted. "It’s only right that she tends to your injury."

Her eyes gleamed with calculation—if Victoria stayed the night, she might finally secure their marriage.

"No. She goes home." Nathan’s tone brooked no argument.

"But you’ll marry her eventually!"

"We’ll have plenty of time after the wedding. For now, she should be with her family. Besides, my divorce isn’t finalized. It’s inappropriate for her to stay."

Penelope had no rebuttal.

Once Victoria was gone, Nathan surveyed the wrecked room and sighed. "Clean this up."

"Mr. Blackwood, come look at this!"

Oliver stood by the closet, holding up an exquisite gown.

Nathan approached, studying the delicate pink fabric embroidered with lifelike peonies. The craftsmanship was unmistakably expensive.

Peonies—symbols of true beauty.

His lashes flickered, something unreadable passing through his eyes.

"Does Ms. Carter perform? If so, that’s incredible!" Oliver couldn’t hide his admiration. He’d always held a soft spot for his boss’s ex-wife.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"Haven’t you heard?"

"Heard what?"

"Actors make the best liars."

His lips pressed into a thin line, irritation coiling in his chest for reasons he couldn’t name.
###Chapter 11

Evelyn casually twisted her chestnut hair into an elegant updo, securing it with a sapphire-encrusted hairpin. The sky-blue evening gown she wore shimmered under the chandelier lights as she performed "Think of Me" from Phantom of the Opera, with Sebastian as her sole audience.

Her emerald eyes sparkled with theatrical emotion, every glance telling its own story.

When the final note faded, Sebastian rose from his seat, applauding with genuine admiration. "Brava! Camille's vocal coaching has worked wonders. In another era, you'd have royal suitors lining up at the palace gates!"

"Who needs princes?" Evelyn scoffed, snapping her fingers dramatically. "I'd rather be the queen who rules them all."

Sebastian chuckled, shaking his head. "Our three stepmothers already treat you like royalty, little sister."

Evelyn's expression softened as she settled beside her eldest brother. Guilt prickled her conscience when she thought of her stepmothers' kindness.

"They've missed you terribly these past three years," Sebastian murmured, draping an arm around her shoulders. "Lillian asks about you every week during our family dinners."

"What do you tell them?"

His brow furrowed. "When you joined Doctors Without Borders, we all knew it was because you were running from Father." His grip tightened slightly. "But Evelyn... we can't change who he is. Even Nathan has flaws, and you loved him for years. Didn't marriage reveal them all?"

Evelyn's fingers instinctively found the jade bracelet circling her wrist, its cool surface grounding her.

"The difference is you could leave Nathan," Sebastian continued gently. "But Father's blood runs through your veins. Since you can't change that, perhaps it's time to accept him? He loves you deeply. And the ladies Kingsley... they're good women who've kept our family intact all these years. I'd stake my reputation on that."

Little did Sebastian know, Evelyn had already made peace with her stepmothers two years prior.

Meanwhile at Cliffside Manor, Oliver Sinclair finished bandaging Nathan's wound and discreetly exited the bedroom.

Nathan massaged his temples, Victoria's hysterical sobs still ringing in his ears. The gentle girl from his memories would never have thrown crystal vases or shattered mirrors. People change, he reasoned with a sigh.

Yet Victoria had been his light during his darkest days. That loyalty bound him to her irrevocably. Come hell or high water, he would marry her.

Gritting his teeth against the pain, Nathan signed several documents before his gaze fell upon the suit draped over the sofa. He rose to inspect it.

Though similar in height to Sebastian Kingsley, Nathan's broader shoulders and muscular frame made most off-the-rack suits fit poorly. Yet this one... He held it up critically.

"Hideous," he muttered.

Minutes later, Nathan stood before the full-length mirror, arms outstretched. The suit fit like a second skin, its craftsmanship rivaling Savile Row's finest. How could a simple country girl possess such refined taste?

A knock interrupted his thoughts. Agnes Thornton entered bearing warm milk, her kind eyes lighting up at the sight of him. "Oh! Master Nathan! You're wearing the suit young madam made for you! She'll be—"

"Made for me?" Nathan whirled around.

Agnes nodded eagerly. "The young madam had me collect it from the tailor last month. Made me swear secrecy—said it was your birthday surprise."

"My birthday isn't for months," Nathan countered coldly.

"Agnes, I appreciate your loyalty, but Evelyn's gone. There's no need to fabricate stories on her behalf."

The elderly nanny drew herself up indignantly. "In sixty years of service, I've never lied to a Blackwood! The young madam spent months on that suit—hand-stitched every seam, personally selected the fabric from—"

"Enough!" Nathan tore off the jacket as if burned. "We're divorced. I don't care what she did. Leave me."

"But Master Nathan, why divorce such a devoted wife?"

"Devoted?" Nathan's laugh was razor-sharp. "She jumped into another man's arms the moment she left!"

Agnes gasped. "That's impossible! The young madam adored—"

"Enough!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip. "If she loved me, why the charade? Did she think time would make me forget Victoria? That I'm some fool to be manipulated?"

As Agnes mournfully folded the discarded suit, she whispered, "You'll regret letting her go, Master Nathan."

Dawn found Evelyn awake at 5 AM despite her best efforts to sleep in. Three years of rising early to cook for the Blackwoods had rewired her internal clock.

Now? No more choking on kitchen smoke. No more catering to an ungrateful household. Divorce was glorious!

After a quick shower, she donned form-fitting athletic wear and headed to the estate's private lake. As her paddleboard glided across the glassy surface, birdsong serenaded her from flowering banks. The rising sun painted the water gold as Evelyn's toned figure cut through the calm, leaving ephemeral ripples in her wake.

Post-workout, she breakfasted and dressed with care, descending the grand staircase rejuvenated.

Theodore Winslow's jaw dropped when she appeared.

Today, Evelyn's hair was swept into a sleek high ponytail, her bold makeup accentuating flawless features. The crimson dress beneath her black coat clung to every curve, while mile-long legs made Theodore's mouth go dry.

"Close your mouth before flies get in," Evelyn teased, snapping her fingers before his dazed face.

Theodore flushed crimson. "Ms. Carter, you look... breathtaking."

"You're Sebastian's chief secretary, Theo. Must you gawk like a schoolboy every time?" Evelyn sighed in mock disappointment.

Her Rolls-Royce purred to Monarch Grand Hotel's entrance.

Employees froze like deer in headlights when their stunning CEO materialized unannounced. Though she could have graced any magazine cover, none dared look directly at the woman who'd reduced managers to tears yesterday. The marble floors gleamed; every ingredient was market-fresh—no one risked cutting corners now.

After a thorough inspection, Evelyn retreated to her office. "Theo, I'm settled here. You may return to Sebastian."

"No need," Theodore beamed. "Mr. Kingsley has reassigned me as your permanent secretary."

"What?!" Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Sebastian mentioned a gift today. You're it?!"

Theodore blinked innocently.

Evelyn groaned internally. Only her brother would gift-wrap a human being.

Noting her silence, Theodore panicked. "Ms. Carter, if you'd prefer someone without... prior ownership—"

"Don't be absurd," Evelyn cut him off. "It's called 'seasoned professional experience.'"

"Right! I look forward to learning from you. A modest salary bump would suffice..." he joked.

Evelyn propped her chin on steepled fingers, crimson lips curling dangerously. "Excel, and I'll make you wealthy. Underperform, and I'll demote you to third-hand secretary."

Theodore gulped and launched into his report. "Per yesterday's orders, all Luxe Furnishings bedding has been removed. Monarch Group hotels worldwide will complete replacements within the week."

A frantic knock interrupted them.
###Chapter 12

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Theodore.

Theodore immediately moved to intercept the intruder.

"Ms. Kingsley!"

Vincent Prescott, the disgraced vice president of Monarch Grand Hotels, burst through the door before Theodore could stop him.

Evelyn's lips thinned as she watched the sweating man charge toward her desk.

"Mr. Prescott, why are you still here? Your resignation was approved hours ago." Her voice dripped with ice.

"You can't do this to me! Twenty years of service! I've sacrificed my health for this company!" Vincent's jowls trembled as he slammed his palms on the mahogany surface. "Even Harrison Kingsley wouldn't have treated me this way!"

Evelyn tapped a manicured nail against her tablet. "Medical records show fatty liver and gallbladder polyps. Quite the indulgent lifestyle you've led."

Vincent's face drained of color.

"I had no idea Luxe Furnishings was supplying substandard products! They're a reputable Crestview brand with competitive pricing-"

A manila folder smacked against his chest.

"Three years of financial discrepancies." Evelyn sipped her espresso, watching him over the rim. "Rather obvious for someone heading the finance department."

Vincent's hands shook as he scanned the documents.

"And then there's the anonymous tip." She set down her cup with a decisive click. "Detailing your... arrangement with Luxe Furnishings. Quite the generous kickback scheme."

The vice president's knees buckled. "Ms. Kingsley, please! I was manipulated! Richard Sterling approached me-"

"Save it." Evelyn swiveled her chair toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. "Theodore, escort Mr. Prescott out."

As the door clicked shut, Theodore grinned. "That was satisfying. The man's been skimming profits for years."

Evelyn smirked, booting up her gaming console. "There was no whistleblower."

Theodore's jaw dropped. "You bluffed?"

"Mhm." She decapitated a zombie with practiced ease. "Guilty men always confess."

Theodore shook his head in admiration. "We should sue to recover every cent he stole."

"Not yet." Another zombie fell to her virtual axe. "Father promoted him. We'll monitor his communications with Damian Sterling."

Her phone chimed repeatedly.

"The Kingsley Intelligence Network is active," Theodore reported, handing over the device.

Evelyn nearly dropped her controller. The encrypted group chat - containing Sebastian, Dominic, Donovan, and Maxwell Kingsley - was blowing up.

[Sebastian Kingsley: Nathan Blackwood is dead to me.]

[Donovan Kingsley: I'll have Blackwood Industries audited by week's end.]

[Maxwell Kingsley: Give me 48 hours to arrange an unfortunate accident.]

Evelyn's fingers flew across the screen. [WHAT HAPPENED?]

Dominic shared a news link.

[Dominic Kingsley: That bastard announced his remarriage. The comments section is calling you a homewrecker who forced him into marriage.]

[Maxwell Kingsley: I'll make them regret breathing.]

[Sebastian Kingsley: Psalm 37:8 - Refrain from anger...]

[Dominic Kingsley: Not now, Bible-thumper.]

Evelyn exhaled sharply. [Leave it. Let them talk.]

Confused emojis flooded the chat.

[Evelyn Kingsley: Evelyn Carter is Nathan's ex-wife. I'm Evelyn Kingsley of Monarch Group.]

[Dominic Kingsley: Right! No public appearances together. This doesn't touch you.]

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips. [But someone's about to have a very bad day.]

Across town, chaos erupted at Blackwood Industries. Reporters swarmed the lobby while Oliver Sinclair fielded endless calls.

"Sir, #WhoWasNathanBlackwoodsFirstWife is trending," Oliver reported, scrolling through his tablet. "The comments about Ms. Sterling are... unflattering."

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his pen. "Sue them all."

"Even Crestview Daily? They broke the story after Ms. Sterling personally visited the editor."

"Especially them." Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. "And contain the narrative."

Oliver hesitated. "The young madam must be devastated."

Nathan's phone lit up with Victoria Sterling's caller ID. His thumb hovered over Sebastian Kingsley's contact instead.

With a curse, he answered Victoria's call.

Meanwhile, Evelyn watched her zombie massacre high score climb, humming as scandalous headlines continued to flood every news outlet in Crestview.
###Chapter 13

"Evelyn?" Nathan's tense shoulders relaxed slightly.

"Nathan! Come help me!"

Victoria's panicked voice crackled through the phone. "I'm trapped in your corporate lobby surrounded by reporters! I'm terrified!"

"I'm coming now."

Without a second thought, Nathan grabbed his suit jacket and strode toward the exit.

"Mr. Blackwood! You can't go out there!"

Oliver rushed to intercept him. "Let security handle Ms. Sterling. If you show up personally-"

Nathan's expression darkened as he pushed past his assistant.

"Ms. Sterling! When will you and Mr. Blackwood announce wedding plans?"

"Is it true you've known each other since childhood?"

"What do you think about Mr. Blackwood's ex-wife? Reports claim she came between your relationship!"

Microphones and cameras jostled against Victoria's face. Though bodyguards formed a protective circle, the chaos intensified.

Victoria maintained a carefully crafted facade of vulnerability while secretly reveling in the attention.

She had orchestrated this media circus herself - leaking news of their engagement while painting Evelyn as the villain who'd stolen her rightful place.

"That bitch took my bracelet and humiliated me," she thought viciously. "Now the whole world will see her as the homewrecker she is."

"Thank you for your concern," Victoria demurred, flashing what she considered her most photogenic smile. "As for Ms. Carter... please don't harass her. Their divorce is finalized, and she deserves peace."

Her calculated words only fueled the reporters' frenzy. Just as the mob surged forward, strong arms enveloped her. Nathan shielded her with his body, guiding her swiftly toward the exit.

"Nathan, thank God you're here!" Victoria's eyes shimmered with manufactured tears.

Nathan's jaw tightened as he remained silent.

Suddenly, he froze, scanning the chaotic scene with unsettling intensity.

An inexplicable certainty gripped him - Evelyn was watching this unfold somewhere nearby.

But that was impossible...

The security camera above Blackwood Industries' entrance adjusted its angle minutely.

Seated in her office, Evelyn observed every humiliating moment in crisp high-definition.

Her breath hitched as she watched Nathan protectively embrace Victoria.

The pain cut deeper than she cared to admit.

"You'd never shield me like that," Evelyn whispered, throat tightening. "That stormy night two years ago when I nearly died from pain, I called you. Even knowing you wouldn't come, I still hoped. Three years of devotion meant nothing - I was just a tool to please your grandfather. You're not worth these tears, Nathan. Loving you was my greatest mistake."

Her phone chimed with a message from the Kingsley Intelligence Network.

[Sebastian: Evelyn, the Savrow Daily editor who leaked your marriage details was fired. Your ex-husband ordered it. Apparently his girlfriend released the news without his knowledge.]

Evelyn's long lashes fluttered as she typed her reply.

[Evelyn: Makes no difference. They're two sides of the same coin.]

[Dominic: Damn right! Birds of a feather!]

[Dominic: By the way, I've uncovered something explosive. Private chat.]

[Maxwell: Just say it here.]

[Dominic: No way! I did the legwork - you want the scoop, do your own digging!]

A voice message followed moments later.

"Evelyn, wait till you see what I found on Victoria Sterling."

Though publicly known as a prosecutor, Dominic Kingsley possessed formidable hacking skills. While not as proficient as their brother Donovan, his talents frequently proved invaluable.

The attached photos made Evelyn's eyebrows shoot up.

One showed Victoria in scandalous attire, locked in a passionate embrace with an unidentified man.

"Nice work, Dom!" Evelyn whistled appreciatively. "Where'd you dig these up?"

"Victoria has hundreds of Instagram followers. Took days combing through them all. This guy seemed suspicious - hacked his account and phone gallery. Turns out he's a popular fitness instructor."

"Impressive. Dinner's on me tonight."

"Drinks too?"

"Sure, why not?"

"Don't celebrate yet. The real bombshell's coming." Dominic's tone turned serious as medical records and abdominal photos appeared.

Evelyn gasped. "Is this...?"

"Believe it? Victoria gave birth in Silvercrest. These are her postpartum stretch marks."

Evelyn zoomed in, hands trembling slightly.

"That 'illness' was a cover. She was actually getting cosmetic treatments to remove the evidence. Modern medicine makes deception so convenient." Dominic snorted. "Handled enough paternity fraud cases, but stretch mark removal? First time. Means she and Nathan never slept together - she'd have been exposed otherwise."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "That's... good."

"Good? How? He still cheated! Don't soften now, Evelyn." Dominic feared his sister might reconsider forgiving Nathan. He wanted to shake some sense into her.

"You misunderstand," Evelyn chuckled darkly. "I don't love him anymore. Just relieved he didn't betray me physically during our marriage."

"Karma's a bitch! Serves him right getting played by his precious Victoria!"

Dominic ranted on. "Idiot chose that trash over the Monarch Group heiress!"

"That's Nathan for you. Love can't be bought." Bitterness laced Evelyn's words. Thirteen years of affection wouldn't vanish overnight.

But she'd sworn never to love Nathan Blackwood again.

"That bitch attacked you publicly. Let's destroy her!" Dominic burned for vengeance.

"I've always saved the best delicacies for last." Evelyn's eyes glinted dangerously. "This trump card deserves a dramatic reveal - when it'll hurt her most."
###Chapter 14

Nathan led Victoria into his office under the watchful eyes of the entire floor.

The moment the door clicked shut, Victoria dissolved into tears, throwing herself against Nathan's chest and clutching his waist desperately.

"Nathan, I'm so glad you came for me. I was terrified out there..."

Nathan's expression darkened. He placed his hands on Victoria's shoulders and firmly pushed her away.

"Nathan?" Victoria blinked in confusion.

"Why did you do this?" Nathan's voice was ice cold, his piercing gaze making her shrink back.

"Do what?"

"Why did you leak our engagement to Crestview Daily?"

Victoria exhaled discreetly before embracing him again. "Because I can't wait to be your wife. Don't you want to marry me?"

"I do. But this wasn't the way." His jaw tightened. The tenderness he usually reserved for her was conspicuously absent.

"What's wrong with it? You and Evelyn are already divorced!"

"The papers aren't finalized yet. We promised Grandfather we'd wait until after his birthday."

Nathan instinctively stepped back from Victoria. "Until then, she's still legally my wife. Your announcement affects all three of us. Now Grandfather will oppose you even more."

Nathan was a pragmatic man who weighed every decision carefully. Though he usually indulged Victoria, his words carried unusual sharpness today.

He'd assumed his childhood sweetheart would understand.

But Victoria missed the point entirely. Her eyes flashed with anger. "All three of us? Nathan, are you upset seeing Evelyn criticized as the other woman? Do you actually feel sorry for her?"

"No. But Evelyn isn't the interloper here. This situation shouldn't have happened." Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose, a dull throb building behind his temples.

"How isn't she? She stole my place!"

Victoria's shrill voice pierced his eardrums, worsening his headache. She stamped her foot petulantly. "If not for her, we'd be together! She occupied my position for three whole years!"

"Evelyn was only my wife on paper to appease Grandfather. Without her compliance, we wouldn't be together now."

As the words left his mouth, Nathan's chest constricted strangely.

It was true. Had Evelyn not agreed to their three-year contractual marriage, his grandfather would never have permitted his relationship with Victoria.

That woman had always greeted him with a warm smile. Prepared his clothes. Drawn his baths. Anticipated his every need without being asked.

No drama. No hysterics. Not even when she signed the divorce papers and walked out of Cliffside Manor without looking back.

Even though Evelyn had ultimately chosen Sebastian, she'd fulfilled her wifely duties impeccably. Nathan, meanwhile, had used her from the beginning - counting down the days until he could be with someone else.

The scales of debt between them tipped heavily in Evelyn's favor.

"Nathan, are you defending her now?" Victoria's voice snapped him back to the present. She stared at him as if he'd grown a second head.

"No. I'm stating facts."

His phone buzzed. Seeing Reginald's name, Nathan frowned.

Opening the door, he found Oliver waiting outside.

"Oliver, arrange additional security to escort Ms. Sterling home."

"Right away, Mr. Blackwood." Oliver gestured for Victoria to proceed.

"Nathan! I don't want to go! I'm scared!" Victoria clung to his arm, tears welling in her eyes.

"Don't be. Just avoid commenting to reporters. I'll handle the rest."

With a final stern look, Nathan closed the door behind her and answered the call, bracing against the pounding in his skull.

"Grandfather."

"Nathan! How dare you break your promise to me? Are you that desperate to marry that scheming little—"

"Grandfather, I had nothing to do with today's announcement."

"I know that Sterling girl leaked it! She's forcing your hand because you haven't proposed!"

"Victoria wouldn't do that. Please don't blame her."

Nathan's headache intensified. He loosened his tie, using the wall for support as he staggered to the sofa.

Guilt tightened his throat as he lied to the man who loved him most. But he had no choice.

"I forbid you to marry Victoria! You belong with Evelyn!" Reginald roared, caring only about uniting Nathan with his favorite.

"Grandfather, you promised I could choose after three years."

Cold sweat beaded on Nathan's forehead, his breathing uneven. "Evelyn has moved on. Victoria is my choice."

"Fine! Stay blind! I'll live long enough to watch you regret losing Evelyn!"

The line went dead.

Nathan exhaled shakily, pressing his palms to his temples. He stumbled to his desk for painkillers.

Oliver returned from escorting Victoria just as Nathan swallowed the pills. "Mr. Blackwood, another migraine?"

"I'm fine." Nathan sank into his chair, massaging his throbbing temples with closed eyes.

"You shouldn't rely on those. The young madam's acupuncture always helped. Why did you stop?"

Oliver sighed. "We could use her here. You always slept better after her treatments."

"Don't mention her." Nathan's voice was tight with frustration.

"About your other request..." Oliver hesitated. "The investigation is complete."

"Go on."

"The accounts attacking the young madam...they were traced to Ms. Sterling."

Nathan's head snapped up. "What? That's impossible!"

"I verified it three times."

Oliver lowered his voice. "The timing was too perfect. Your engagement breaks, and immediately Evelyn is smeared? This was calculated."

Nathan froze, then slumped forward as if punched.

Victoria...why?

He knew she loved him. Knew she resented Evelyn. But this? This was beyond petty.

"Handle it. I want every negative story gone by sunset!"

Meanwhile, at the Sterling residence...

Victoria's family erupted in celebration when she arrived.

"Brilliant move, darling!" Damian beamed. "The moment your engagement hit the news, our order cancellations reversed! Hotels are lining up to work with us again!"

Her father clapped her shoulder proudly. "You've saved our family business!"

Previously, Monarch Grand Hotels had returned all Luxe Furnishings products and terminated their contract, causing industry-wide doubts about Sterling Corporation's quality. The domino effect nearly bankrupted them.

Victoria's engagement announcement changed everything overnight. Association with Blackwood Industries was their lifeline.

Yet Victoria scowled. "Do you know what this cost me? Nathan was furious! That old man will hate me even more now!"

"What does it matter?" Damian smirked. "How long can that fossil last? Once he's gone—"

"Damian!" their mother chastised, though her eyes gleamed with matching greed. She stroked Victoria's hair. "As long as Nathan loves you, no one can stop this marriage. Look at your Aunt Penelope."

Victoria's confidence returned. She nodded firmly.

This time, she would become Mrs. Blackwood no matter what. The envy of every socialite in Crestview.
###Chapter 15

The evening sky blazed with streaks of amber and rose as the sun dipped below the horizon.

Nathan Blackwood slumped against the plush leather seats of his Maybach, exhaustion lining his chiseled features as the car glided toward Cliffside Manor.

"Mr. Blackwood," Oliver Sinclair adjusted his glasses, "we've handled the online defamation against Ms. Carter. All offending accounts have been terminated and legal proceedings initiated. However..." He hesitated. "The trending news about your marital status remains beyond our control."

Nathan's obsidian eyes remained fixed on the passing cityscape.

During the ride, his fingers had hovered over his phone multiple times, itching to call Evelyn. But the memory of their last disastrous conversation stopped him each time. Going through Sebastian Kingsley again would be humiliating.

Even if she answered, what would he say?

An apology for today's fiasco?

The words stuck in his throat like shards of glass. Guilt and frustration warred within him.

As the Rolls-Royce approached the manor gates, Nathan suddenly commanded, "Pull over."

The vehicle came to an abrupt halt.

Before Oliver could question him, Nathan had already crossed the street toward a quaint tailor shop with vintage charm.

Handcrafted suits adorned the display window beneath a weathered sign reading "Wisterias."

Recognition flashed through Nathan. This was the name stamped on the gift box containing Evelyn's handmade suit.

The bell chimed as he entered. An elderly tailor emerged from the back.

"Good evening, sir. Are you collecting an order or commissioning new attire?"

Nathan hesitated. "Did a young woman in her twenties create a men's suit here about a month ago?"

The tailor's face lit up. "Ah! The talented young lady! She came daily - such remarkable skill for her age!"

His wrinkled hands gestured animatedly. "Forty years in this trade, and I've never seen such natural talent! Her design instincts were extraordinary."

"Every day?" Nathan's voice thickened.

"Oh yes, from opening till closing. Sometimes I'd find her asleep at the worktable, completely exhausted." The tailor shook his head fondly. "Forgot meals, forgot water - poured her entire being into that suit."

He leaned closer conspiratorially. "When I asked if it was for her father or sweetheart, she blushed scarlet and said 'my husband.' Can you imagine? Married so young! I told her - whoever he is, he's the luckiest man alive."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"Her eyes sparkled when she spoke of him. Every stitch was sewn with love, I could tell." The tailor peered at Nathan curiously. "If I may ask, how do you know about her work?"

Nathan swallowed hard. "I'm... her husband."

The old man's eyebrows shot up. Then he broke into a wide grin. "Well now! No wonder she worked so tirelessly! A perfect match indeed!"

Emerging from the shop, Nathan stood motionless as the fading sunlight painted his face gold. His world tilted on its axis.

Evelyn had done this to him.

Had she truly loved him?

Then how could she walk away so easily? How could she vanish into another man's arms?

An unfamiliar hollowness spread through his chest.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Oliver appeared bewildered. "Since when do you visit tailors? Your wardrobe comes exclusively from—"

"Never mind. Let's go."

His phone buzzed.

After today's events, the sound triggered instant tension. Relief came when he saw Julian Montgomery's name.

"What?"

"Celebration time!" Julian's boisterous voice crackled through. "Your choice - wedding bells or divorce champagne!"

"Fuck off."

"Kidding! My new club Velvet opens tonight. Get your miserable ass over here! It's been ages!"

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Fine."

Meanwhile, at Willow Creek Estate...

Evelyn had prepared an elaborate dinner for Dominic Kingsley.

"Evie," Dominic frowned at the spread, "you know smoke triggers your allergies. Why torture yourself?"

The slip came automatically. "It's fine, I'm used to—" She froze.

Dominic's fork clattered onto the plate. "Three years? You cooked for that bastard daily?" His voice rose dangerously. "I'll skin him alive!"

Evelyn forced a laugh. "Wives cook for husbands. It doesn't matter now. That chapter's closed."

Her smile couldn't mask the sorrow in her eyes.

The usually playful Dominic grew solemn. He enveloped her in a protective embrace. "Consider those three years community service at a dog pound. From now on, you're our princess again."

At 9 PM, Velvet pulsed with energy, packed with Savrow's elite drawn by Julian's reputation.

A limited-edition Bugatti roared up to the entrance.

Dominic emerged first, his casual attire a stark contrast to his usual courtroom formality. The transformation revealed a strikingly handsome aristocrat beneath the prosecutor's stern demeanor.

Then the driver's door opened.

Evelyn placed her hand in Dominic's, unfolding endless legs from the vehicle. Her silver sequined dress clung to every curve, shimmering under the club lights. Diamond tassel earrings framed her face, accentuating the cascade of chestnut waves.

Every male eye in vicinity locked onto her.

"Jesus, Evie!" Dominic yanked her closer. "That dress is practically body paint! Look at these vultures!"

She smirked. "You don't like it?"

"Too much! I'll need riot gear to keep these animals off you!"

"Let them try." Her eyes glinted dangerously. "I'll remove their teeth one by one."

Inside, Dominic secured a VIP booth, erecting a fortress of premium liquor and his most intimidating glare.

"Regretting bringing you already," Evelyn sighed, swirling her wine. "So many prospects, and here I am with my human chastity belt."

"Evelyn Carter!" Dominic hissed. "Divorced doesn't mean desperate! Raise your damn standards!"

He inched closer as predatory gazes tracked her every move.

Above them, Nathan and Julian approached the second-floor balcony overlooking the dance floor.

"Seriously?" Julian eyed Nathan's impeccable suit. "We're at a club, not a board meeting!"

Nathan arched a brow. "Every nightclub in Crestview bleeds money. Yours isn't special."

"True," Julian grinned, "but who cares? Money's meant to burn!"

As Julian scanned the crowd below, his gaze snagged. "Holy hell! Now that's what I call a walking sin!"

He forced Nathan to look.

Nathan's blood turned to ice.

Evelyn Carter.

And the man beside her wasn't Sebastian Kingsley.

It was Dominic.
###Chapter 16

Who's that stunning woman sitting with the gorgeous guy? Wait...isn't that Sebastian Kingsley, the CEO of Monarch Group from Fairhaven?

Julian Montgomery raised an eyebrow, his voice dripping with amusement. "I thought Sebastian was practically a monk who never stepped foot in nightclubs. Well, well...looks like even saints can fall from grace."

Nathan Blackwood and Julian had both mistaken Dominic for Sebastian.

The Kingsley brothers were actually quadruplets. Sebastian and Dominic were identical twins, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to tell them apart.

"Damn! That's unfair. That bombshell should be mine. What a waste on Sebastian!" Julian's eyes gleamed with predatory interest as he spoke.

Downstairs, Evelyn was laughing brightly at something Dominic said.

Nathan's grip tightened around his glass.

That radiant smile used to belong exclusively to him.

What infuriated him more was how unaffected she seemed by the online scandal. Here she was, enjoying herself while he'd spent the entire day damage-controlling and agonizing over explanations.

"I'm making my move tonight. Don't care if she's with Sebastian - even goalkeepers let shots through sometimes." Julian licked his lips, already straightening his tie.

"Don't even think about it. She's my wife."

Julian's jaw dropped. "What?!"

"Ex-wife," Nathan corrected bitterly, the words burning his throat like cheap whiskey.

"You divorced THAT? Are you blind or just plain stupid? Scratch that - you're both! She's a fucking goddess! Makes your precious Victoria look like last season's knockoff!"

Nathan's icy glare could have frozen lava. Julian held up his hands. "Just calling it like I see it. And you refused to introduce us back then - had me thinking she was some bridge troll. Who knew— Hey! Where are you going?"

Nathan was already striding away before Julian finished speaking.

Evelyn and her brother Dominic had been drinking steadily. Her porcelain cheeks were now flushed pink.

"Evie, maybe we should slow down?" Dominic eyed her with concern as she swayed slightly.

"Another round!" Evelyn could handle her liquor, but tonight she wanted to drown her sorrows.

When Dominic's phone rang with his boss's special tone, he grimaced. "Evie, hold that thought. Emergency call - I'll be right back."

She waved him off dramatically. "Dismissed!"

The moment Dominic disappeared, men began circling Evelyn like sharks sensing blood in the water.

Her sharp gaze assessed each would-be suitor with lazy disinterest.

Too short. Too scrawny. Weak jawline. Beady eyes. None hold a candle to my ex-husband...

Pity Nathan's perfect exterior housed such a rotten core. What a waste of good genetics.

A commotion at the neighboring booth caught her attention. Some entitled brat was forcing drinks on a clearly uncomfortable woman.

The ringleader's smarmy grin was unmistakable - Damian Sterling, Victoria's odious brother.

Evelyn's blood boiled when she spotted one of his cronies slipping something into a drink before passing it to Damian.

Without hesitation, she marched over.

"Damn! Check out this masterpiece!" The group leered as Evelyn approached.

Damian's eyes lit up, immediately shoving his current companion aside.

"Mind if I join? You all look like you're having...fun." Evelyn's slightly slurred words only added to her allure.

"Anything you want, gorgeous." Damian licked his lips like a starving man at a banquet.

Evelyn picked up the spiked drink. "Simple. Drink this."

The group fell silent. Damian's greasy smile faltered.

Everyone knew what was in that glass. Only an idiot would—

"Need help?"

Before anyone reacted, Evelyn's almond eyes narrowed dangerously. With one swift motion, she upended the glass onto Damian's stunned face.

Gasps erupted. The woman beside him screamed and scrambled backward.
###Chapter 17

"You filthy whore! How dare you throw wine on me?!" Damian's face twisted in rage as he wiped the crimson liquid from his expensive suit. "Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?"

Evelyn tossed her long chestnut hair over one shoulder, her whiskey-colored eyes glinting with dangerous amusement. "Why should I care? You're just another pathetic creep trying to drug women's drinks."

The crowd around them gasped as Damian's face turned purple with fury.

If they hadn't been surrounded by witnesses, he would have slapped that arrogant smirk off her face.

With a sharp jerk of his chin, Damian signaled his two bodyguards. They moved forward with predatory intent, muscles bulging beneath their black suits.

Evelyn swayed slightly from the champagne, but her combat-trained reflexes kicked in. She dodged the first guard's grab with surprising agility.

"Too slow, boys," she taunted, stifling a yawn.

"Take her down!" Damian bellowed, still scrubbing at his stained shirt.

The larger guard managed to grip Evelyn's shoulders - only to have his arm twisted violently behind his back.

A dark figure moved like lightning, sending the 6'2" bodyguard crashing to the floor in one fluid motion.

"Nice moves!" Evelyn giggled, her vision swimming as she stumbled backward.

Strong arms caught her slender frame. Warm breath tickled her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

"Unhand me!" she slurred, weakly pushing against the stranger's chest.

"Open your eyes, Evelyn," came that deep, velvety voice she'd recognize anywhere.

Her pulse skyrocketed. Blinking up through her lashes, she met Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze - those stormy gray eyes that could freeze hell over.

His grip tightened as he took in her flushed cheeks and wine-stained lips. If not for those wide, innocent doe eyes, he might not have recognized his ex-wife beneath the smudged makeup and reckless demeanor.

"So this is what freedom looks like?" Nathan's voice dripped with disdain. "Getting drunk and picking fights? Does Sebastian Kingsley know his precious sister is behaving like common trash?"

Evelyn jutted her chin defiantly. "I don't need anyone's permission to put Sterling scum in their place." She poked Nathan's chest. "And you can't stop me."

Nathan's fingers dug into her waist painfully.

"Ow! Let go, you brute!" She writhed in his grasp, her drunken protests coming out more like a kitten's mewl.

Something dark flickered in Nathan's expression.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Damian interrupted, confusion warring with outrage. "What's the meaning of this?"

Nathan didn't even glance his way. "Until the wedding, address me properly as Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn's stomach churned at the mention of his impending marriage. Victoria. The name tasted like bile.

Three years of marriage, and Nathan had never once used an endearment for her. Not even "darling" in private. But for Victoria? Of course he had pet names.

The injustice made her reckless. She threw her weight backward, preferring to crash to the floor rather than stay in his arms.

"Apologize to her," Nathan commanded Damian, though his attention remained fixed on Evelyn's swaying form.

"That crazy bitch assaulted me!" Damian spat. "She's the one who should be on her knees begging forgiveness!"

Nathan's expression turned deadly. "Mind your tongue. That's my ex-wife you're speaking about."

The club's pulsing music seemed to fade as the weight of his words hung between them. Even drunk, Evelyn couldn't miss the possessive edge in his voice - nor the way it made her traitorous heart skip a beat.
###Chapter 18

Nathan's jaw nearly hit the floor when realization struck him.

The stunning woman before him was none other than Evelyn Carter - his elusive ex-wife.

He couldn't deny she outshone Victoria Sterling in every possible way.

Had Victoria not been his childhood sweetheart, she wouldn't stand a chance against Evelyn's radiant beauty.

"Mr. Blackwood, even if she's your ex-wife, that doesn't mean I owe her an apology!"

Damian Sterling stubbornly crossed his arms. "Make her apologize first, then we can forget this ever happened."

Nathan's expression darkened. "If I'd arrived any later, your goons would have assaulted her." His voice turned icy. "The fact that nothing happened doesn't absolve you. Apologize. Now."

Though terrified, Damian maintained his composure.

Evelyn's cheeks were flushed from intoxication.

Through her drunken haze, she caught snippets - "ex-wife" and "apologize." Her thoughts slurred, "This bastard wants me to say sorry? I should be twisting his head off!"

"Too much trouble," she mumbled. "Just call the cops or beat him to a pulp."

Julian Montgomery approached with a dangerous smirk, flanked by two rows of intimidating bodyguards that screamed underworld power.

"You can't just assault me! We have laws!" Damian's voice shook as he faced Julian.

With a casual finger gesture, Julian summoned the terrified waitress Damian had harassed earlier.

"First rule," Julian began coolly, "My staff serve drinks and dance - nothing more. You violated club policy by forcing her to drink with you." His smile vanished. "Second, no drugs in my establishment. Break that rule, and you'll wish you were dead." He nodded toward Evelyn. "Thank Ms. Carter. Had she not stopped you from drugging my employee, you'd be leaving in a body bag."

Nathan's eyes widened in shock. So that's what had transpired!

"Bravo!" Evelyn giggled, giving Julian a wobbly thumbs-up with crescent-shaped eyes.

"My pleasure, Evelyn." Julian winked back.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped Nathan's chest watching their exchange.

"Nathan, does this arrangement satisfy you?" Julian inquired.

"Acceptable," Nathan clipped.

Through gritted teeth, Damian forced out, "My apologies, Mr. Blackwood. I didn't know she was your ex-wife. Ms. Carter... I'm sorry."

Nathan remained unsatisfied, but suddenly realized Evelyn had vanished.

"Looking for your ex?" Julian whistled, jerking his chin toward the dance floor.

Nathan's breath caught.

Under the pulsating lights, Evelyn moved with hypnotic grace, her radiant smile outshining the strobes.

Hopelessly drunk, she floated in euphoric freedom.

Then she stumbled backward.

A collective gasp rose as strong arms caught her.

Blinking up at Nathan's furious expression, she slurred, "Gonna be sick..."

Nathan hauled her into the men's restroom.

She retched violently until nearly unconscious, her beauty marred by the ordeal.

Initially keeping his distance, Nathan finally approached when her suffering became unbearable, gently rubbing her back.

Afterward, Evelyn staggered to the sink, rinsing her mouth with trembling hands.

"Ugh... dying..."

"Serves you right," Nathan scowled. "Why overindulge?"

"Because..." Her voice broke. "It hurts..."
###Chapter 19

Evelyn was drunk.

Her vision blurred as she clutched the man beside her, mistaking him for her brother. Tears spilled freely down her cheeks.

"Why doesn’t Nathan love me?" she sobbed. "Why?"

Nathan’s chest tightened. His jaw clenched as he listened to her broken words.

"I tried so hard," she hiccuped. "I gave him everything. But the more I tried, the more he pushed me away."

She turned abruptly, throwing her arms around him. Her face buried into his chest, muffling her cries.

Her tears smeared against his pristine shirt, her makeup staining the fabric.

Nathan stood frozen.

Every tear burned through him, searing into his skin like acid. His throat constricted, his pulse erratic.

After a long silence, he finally spoke, voice low. "Do you really love Nathan?"

Evelyn lifted her face. Her eyes were swollen, lips trembling.

Nathan’s gaze dropped to her mouth. His fingers twitched with the urge to claim them.

He instantly regretted asking.

It didn’t matter anymore.

Their divorce was inevitable. His future was with Victoria.

Then—

The bathroom door slammed open.

"Nathan Blackwood!" Dominic roared, eyes blazing. "What the hell are you doing with my sister?"

Nathan’s brows furrowed.

Dominic Kingsley—ever composed, ever controlled—was unraveling before him.

And it was all because of Evelyn.

The realization was a knife to his ribs.

"Mr. Kingsley," Nathan said coldly, "she was drunk. If you cared about her, you wouldn’t have brought her here."

Dominic’s grip on Evelyn tightened. "She can do whatever she wants. If she wants to drink, I’ll drink with her." His glare sharpened. "You lost the right to interfere when you signed those divorce papers."

He moved to leave, but Nathan blocked him.

"Do you love her?" Nathan demanded.

Dominic scoffed. "What kind of question—"

"Will you marry her?"

Silence.

Dominic’s jaw worked.

Nathan’s voice turned lethal. "Evelyn isn’t someone you play with. If you can’t commit, walk away before you break her."

A harsh laugh escaped Dominic. "You’re unbelievable. You divorced her for Victoria Sterling, and now you’re giving me a lecture?" His knuckles whitened. "You used her. Discarded her. And you dare act like you care?"

Nathan flinched.

Dominic shoved past him. "Get out of my way, you hypocrite."

Nathan didn’t remember returning to his table.

Julian Montgomery smirked at him from across the booth, swirling his drink. "Where’s your ex-wife? Gone already?"

Nathan grabbed his whiskey and downed it in one gulp. The burn did nothing to numb him.

"If it weren’t for you," Julian mused, "I would’ve broken Damian Sterling’s hands for touching my girl."

Nathan’s grip tightened on the glass. "She’s not Victoria."

Julian’s grin widened. "No. She’s mine now."

Nathan’s head snapped up.

"Since you don’t want her," Julian continued, "I’ll take her off your hands." He leaned in. "Wonder how you’ll feel seeing her as Mrs. Montgomery."

Nathan’s glass shattered in his grip.

"The divorce isn’t finalized," he growled.

Julian shrugged. "It’s just a matter of time."

Nathan’s smile was deadly. "What I do know is you’re not far from a hospital bed."
###Chapter 20

Evelyn woke with a pounding headache and immediately rushed to the bathroom to vomit.

"Evelyn, I remember you used to handle alcohol so well," Dominic remarked, watching her with concern. "What happened last night?"

He quickly handed her a glass of water and retrieved the hangover medication from the cabinet.

"I haven't touched alcohol in three years," Evelyn rasped, wiping her mouth. "Of course I'd get wasted drinking that much suddenly."

She remembered how Nathan despised the smell of liquor on women. She'd given up drinking entirely during their marriage.

Dominic smirked. "I know you're hungover, but anyone else would think you have morning sickness."

Evelyn's eyes darkened. "What if I really was pregnant with Nathan's child? What would you all do?"

"We'd raise the kid, obviously!" Dominic declared. "No matter what, the child would be innocent."

Despite his hatred for Nathan, Dominic's prosecutor's ethics wouldn't allow him to condemn an unborn child.

Evelyn scoffed. "Don't worry. I'd never carry his child. He's not worth it!" She gulped more water to clear her throat.

"By the way," Dominic said casually, "do you remember anything from last night?"

"I remember confronting Damian Sterling. Nathan showed up at some point, but everything after is fuzzy."

"You really don't recall?"

"I think there was another handsome guy who helped me?" Evelyn groaned. "Damn, I was too drunk to get his number!"

"That was Julian Montgomery. VELVET is his new club."

Evelyn immediately lost interest at the notorious playboy's name. "Never mind then."

Dominic's eyes twinkled. "Did you know Nathan dragged you into the men's restroom?"

Evelyn's jaw dropped. "What?!"

"I don't know what happened in there. When I found you, you were hugging him and wiping your nose on his shirt." Dominic shook his head at the memory.

Evelyn gasped in horror.

"If I hadn't arrived when I did, that bastard might have—"

"He wouldn't," Evelyn cut in. "Nathan isn't like Julian."

Dominic scowled. "Why are you defending him?"

"I'm not. He's just... decent in that way. Just not to me." The words made her heart ache unexpectedly.

"Oh, but get this—he actually asked if I'd marry you. Told me not to play with your feelings." Dominic snorted. "Said you're a fragile woman who can't take more heartbreak."

"The audacity!" Evelyn's fist connected with Dominic's cheek before she could stop herself.

Theodore had prepared an elaborate breakfast, knowing Evelyn would need it after her binge.

Evelyn descended the stairs in a blush silk chemise, her hair cascading over bare shoulders. Though properly covered, the outfit accentuated every curve.

Theodore flushed scarlet and averted his gaze immediately.

"Hey! There are single men in this house," Dominic complained, rolling a cold egg over his bruised cheek. "Have some consideration!"

"For three years I wore nothing but white dresses and flats," Evelyn retorted, biting into her sandwich. "Now I'll wear what I please. Who's going to stop me?"

"Why did you only wear white for three years?" Theodore asked innocently. "Were you teaching Sunday school? You'd corrupt the children!"

"None of your business!" the Kingsley siblings chorused.

Later, perfectly coiffed in a white Chanel suit and Louboutins, Evelyn transformed back into the elegant CEO of Monarch Grand Hotels—despite her skull pounding like a war drum.

Sitting in her office, she replayed Dominic's words about Nathan's unexpected protectiveness.

Had Nathan actually cared about her?

She laughed bitterly at the thought. Impossible. He probably just couldn't stand seeing his once-obedient wife change masters so abruptly. It was pure possessiveness, nothing more.
###Chapter 21

Evelyn swore to herself she wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

Her phone buzzed with messages from the Kingsley Family Intelligence Network.

[Sebastian: Evelyn, all the defamatory articles about you were removed overnight. The social media accounts spreading rumors were suspended too.]

[Sebastian: Nathan was behind it.]

[Evelyn: How thoughtful of him. I suppose I should send a thank you note.]

[Dominic: He's delusional if he thinks deleting posts fixes anything.]

[Donovan: Blackwood Industries' stock barely dipped at market open today. Disappointing.]

[Maxwell: Evelyn, we're still making the Sterlings pay, even if we have to wait!]

[Evelyn: Naturally. Revenge is best served slowly.]

She summoned her assistant Theodore.

He entered promptly. "You needed me, Ms. Carter?"

"Did you compile all the documents and evidence I requested?" Evelyn swiveled in her leather chair, fingers drumming on the armrests.

"Everything's prepared. We can submit it to authorities immediately."

"Not yet." Evelyn crossed her legs, the sunlight catching the delicate curve of her ankle. "First, leak this to Monarch Group's media connections - Éclat News specifically. Let the public digest it first."

"The media frenzy will complicate things. Wouldn't a direct strike be more effective?" Theodore frowned.

"I prefer ceremony. Never kill your prey quickly." Evelyn traced the emerald bracelet Reginald had given her, her smile chilling. "I want to watch them bleed out drop by drop."

Once exposed, the Sterlings would scramble. Damian and Richard were powerless against her, forcing Victoria to beg Nathan for help.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Nathan, I can't wait to see how passionately you defend your precious fiancée."

By evening rush hour, the story exploded across Fairhaven.

Monarch Group terminates all contracts with Sterling Enterprises over quality concerns!

Substandard materials? Safety violations? Luxe Furnishings' products under investigation.

Caught unprepared, the Sterlings' incompetent PR team couldn't contain the fallout or remove the damning comments.

[Sterling Enterprises? Isn't that Nathan Blackwood's future in-laws? Awkward timing before their wedding!]

[Thought his fiancée came from old money. Turns out her family sells particle board garbage!]

[Returning my Luxe Furnishings order tomorrow. Total scam!]

In his study, Nathan listened to Oliver's report, tension coiling in his shoulders.

The Kingsleys dominated Fairhaven's economy. Their boycott would trigger industry-wide avoidance of Sterling Enterprises.

Oliver smirked, enjoying the spectacle. "Thank heavens they're not publicly traded. Your father-in-law might need hospitalization when he sees tomorrow's-"

Nathan's glacial stare silenced him.

"These allegations lack substantiation. Probably baseless rumors." Nathan's jaw tightened. "How did this quality issue surface?"

"Monarch Grand Hotels' new Crestview manager initiated the cancellation. Within days, every Monarch property removed Luxe Furnishings."

"A hotel manager wields that much influence?"

"Because she's Harrison Kingsley's daughter - Evelyn Kingsley-Carter."

Evelyn Kingsley-Carter.

The name sent an inexplicable jolt through Nathan, though he couldn't place why.
###Chapter 22

Nathan Blackwood rubbed his temples, a frown creasing his forehead. "Evelyn Carter... why does that name sound so familiar?"

His secretary Oliver Sinclair stood nervously before him. "I've conducted extensive research on Ms. Carter, sir."

Finally, Nathan thought, this incompetent assistant might actually be useful for once. "Report your findings."

Oliver's shoulders slumped. "There's... nothing to report. I couldn't find any information about her."

Nathan's icy gaze could have frozen molten lava. "Oliver, perhaps you should visit HR tomorrow to collect your termination papers."

"Mr. Blackwood, please!" Oliver wiped his sweaty palms on his trousers. "It's not for lack of trying. Ms. Carter's records are locked down tighter than Fort Knox. The only thing I discovered is that she's Harrison Kingsley's daughter from his first marriage. No social media presence, no digital footprint - it's like she's a ghost."

"Show me her photo," Nathan demanded.

Oliver fumbled with his phone. "Ah yes! This took considerable effort to obtain."

Nathan's temper flared when he saw the image. "Oliver Sinclair! Are you mocking me?"

The grainy photograph showed a toddler being held by Harrison Kingsley at what appeared to be a funeral. The image quality was so poor it could have been taken with a potato.

"Sir, this is literally the only existing photo of Ms. Carter on the entire internet," Oliver explained hurriedly. "It's from twenty years ago - at the funeral of Harrison's first wife."

Twenty years. That would make Evelyn approximately twenty-four now - around the same age as Victoria Sterling.

Nathan studied the blurry image, his frown deepening with each passing second. There was something unsettlingly familiar about the child's features...

Why did this toddler's face remind him so much of Victoria?

Damn it all. Ever since signing those divorce papers, his ex-wife kept invading his thoughts. What the hell was wrong with him?

A soft knock interrupted his brooding. "Young Master Nathan? The chairman requests your presence in the drawing room."

In the grand salon, Penelope Whitmore leaned dramatically against Leonard Blackwood's shoulder, dabbing at dry eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. Though well into her forties, she still played the delicate flower to perfection.

"Leonard, darling," she sniffled, "my poor sister sacrificed her youth marrying into the Sterling family. She raised Damian and Victoria single-handedly, and now this tragedy? She called me in tears earlier..."

"There, there," Leonard soothed, stroking her shoulder. "We'll handle everything once Nathan arrives."

Penelope had clawed her way to the top of Blackwood Manor by ousting Nathan's mother years ago. Even now, Leonard remained utterly bewitched by her calculated charms.

"You wanted to see me, Father?" Nathan's voice cut through the melodrama like an arctic wind.

"Nathan! You must save the Sterlings!" Penelope's tears flowed anew. "Victoria's taken ill from the stress - she can't keep anything down. If you care for her at all, you'll fix this!"
###Chapter 23

"Nathan, have you uncovered the truth?" Leonard Blackwood demanded, his brow furrowed as he comforted his wife.

"I have. The person behind this leak is the newly appointed CEO of Monarch Grand Hotels - Evelyn Carter."

Nathan lowered his gaze, deliberately avoiding the affectionate display between his father and stepmother.

In all his memories, Leonard had never shown such tenderness to his birth mother or himself. Perhaps the man had already forgotten what his first wife even looked like.

"The Kingsleys from Fairhaven?!"

Penelope Whitmore gasped behind her manicured hand. "That's the wealthiest family in Fairhaven! How could Victoria's family possibly offend them?"

"We've had no dealings with the Kingsleys for generations due to an ancestral feud. Harrison Kingsley's great-grandmother swore an oath forbidding any Kingsley from marrying a Blackwood. Violators would be disinherited."

Nathan remained indifferent - the woman he intended to marry was Victoria Sterling, not Evelyn Carter.

Yet his father's words sent an unexpected chill down his spine.

"Oh my God! They're clearly targeting Sterling Enterprises to get to us, especially with Victoria's upcoming marriage to Nathan. How petty!" Penelope crushed her silk handkerchief in her fist.

"Nathan, you must meet Ms. Kingsley tomorrow and put a stop to this attack on the Sterlings. This isn't just their problem anymore - it affects our family's reputation!" Leonard's tone brooked no argument.

"Leonard darling, don't be so harsh with Nathan. He's always been such an obedient boy." Penelope massaged her husband's shoulders, her voice dripping honey.

"I'm only helping the Sterlings for Victoria's sake. It has nothing to do with anyone else... Aunt Penelope."

Nathan's striking eyes turned glacial. Without another word, he turned on his heel.

Penelope's face paled with rage.

She was the chairman's wife, yet Nathan still addressed her as "Aunt." The insult!

"Stop right there! How dare you still call her 'Aunt'? She's your mother now - where are your manners?" Leonard roared, jumping to his feet.

Nathan paused but didn't turn back. "You may have multiple wives, but I only had one mother. Don't push me."

That evening, Sebastian Kingsley visited Evelyn in Crestview. Over dinner, they discussed Vincent Prescott and the Sterling family.

"Father knows your strategy and doesn't object. He only said we shouldn't let them off if the evidence proves their guilt." Sebastian meticulously cut his sister's steak.

"Harrison may be a womanizer, but he's exceptionally capable otherwise." Evelyn chewed her medium-rare steak thoughtfully, her clear eyes narrowing.

"That explains why our three stepmothers remain devoted to him. Aside from his philandering, Father treats all his wives well."

"True. The dead can't speak their grievances - history belongs to the living." Evelyn lowered her lashes, stabbing her fork into the meat.

Sebastian studied his sister's reddening eyes. Gently stroking her hair, he murmured, "I know you don't hate our stepmothers anymore. You just can't move past the injustice to our mother. But Evelyn... have you considered that perhaps Mother would have forgiven Father long ago?"

"How can I not resent him? I'm certain his wives merely tolerate the arrangement. No woman could willingly share her husband—"

Evelyn's breath caught.

She was no different. Despite knowing about Nathan's childhood sweetheart, she'd foolishly given him her heart, only to be discarded.

Harrison might be a womanizer, but he cared for all his women. Nathan had ignored her for three years before ruthlessly breaking her heart repeatedly.

Thirteen years wasted on that heartless man!

"Nathan's been unusually quiet these past two days. He hasn't contacted me," Sebastian remarked, sipping his wine.

"Oh, he's too busy cleaning up his darling's family mess. When would he have time for me?"

Evelyn swirled her wine leisurely, her bright gaze turning predatory.

"Evelyn Carter is too soft. Now it's time for him to meet Evelyn Kingsley."
###Chapter 24

The morning sun cast golden rays through the windows as Nathan Blackwood adjusted his tie in the mirror. His tailored suit hugged his broad shoulders, the polished leather shoes gleaming under the light. Every detail was impeccable—he was a man who commanded attention.

With a deep breath, he stepped out, heading straight for Monarch Grand Hotel.

The moment he entered the grand lobby, the atmosphere struck him. The last time he had been here, the place had been lackluster, its reputation fading under poor management.

But now?

The transformation was undeniable.

The air smelled of fresh flowers, the staff moved with precision, and the decor exuded luxury. This wasn’t just a hotel—it was an experience.

Evelyn Carter had done this.

His jaw tightened.

She was proving to be far more formidable than he had anticipated.

Oliver Sinclair, his ever-loyal secretary, approached the front desk with authority.

"This is Mr. Nathan Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries. He wishes to speak with Ms. Carter immediately."

The receptionist barely glanced up.

"I'm afraid Ms. Carter doesn’t see anyone without an appointment."

Oliver’s face darkened.

"Do you know who you’re speaking to? Mr. Blackwood doesn’t wait for appointments."

The receptionist remained unfazed.

"Then perhaps he should have scheduled one."

Oliver’s hands clenched into fists. Nathan placed a firm hand on his shoulder, pulling him back before he could escalate the situation.

"Fine. Schedule one for us."

The receptionist tapped at her keyboard, unbothered.

"Ms. Carter’s schedule is full. You may try again tomorrow."

Oliver looked ready to explode.

Nathan’s expression darkened, but he kept his composure.

They left without another word.

Back in the car, Oliver slammed his fist against the dashboard.

"Unbelievable! Who does she think she is? This is Crestview, not Fairhaven! She can’t just—"

"Enough."

Nathan leaned back, loosening his tie. His sharp jawline tensed as he exhaled.

"We’ll try again tomorrow."

But tomorrow yielded the same result.

And the day after that.

Nathan Blackwood—business magnate, one of the nation’s most influential figures, a man who had dined with presidents—was being ignored.

It was infuriating.

Meanwhile, Evelyn strode into the hotel that morning, the click of her stilettos echoing through the marble halls.

She wore a sleek, double-breasted black suit, the fabric hugging her curves perfectly. Gold rose earrings glinted at her ears, completing the look of effortless power.

Gasps followed her.

"She’s stunning."

"Every day, I swear she gets more gorgeous."

Since taking over, Evelyn had turned the hotel around in weeks. The staff adored her. The guests raved.

And no one dared slack off under her watch.

Upstairs, Sebastian Kingsley’s voice crackled through the phone.

"Blackwood just injected another massive sum into Sterling Corporation."

Evelyn smirked, kicking off her heels and massaging her sore feet.

"Of course he did. He’s so blinded by love, he’ll throw money at a sinking ship."

"It won’t save them."

"No," she agreed, popping a piece of chocolate into her mouth. "Reputation isn’t something you can buy back."

Sebastian chuckled.

"You know, if the two of you ever did team up, you’d be unstoppable."

Evelyn’s smile turned icy.

"We’re not teammates, Sebastian. We’re rivals."

And she intended to win.
###Chapter 25

The moment Evelyn ended the call with Sebastian, Theodore rushed in, his expression tight with irritation.

"Ms. Carter, Nathan Blackwood is here again!" His voice dripped with disdain. "The man has no shame. He should’ve gone into sales—he’d be a millionaire by now with this persistence."

Evelyn didn’t even glance up from the documents she was signing.

"His devotion to his precious fiancée is almost touching," she remarked dryly.

Theodore hesitated. Was that bitterness he detected in her tone? Or was he imagining it?

"Shall I have security escort him out?" he offered.

"No." She capped her pen with a decisive click and arched a brow. "Bring him up."

Theodore blinked. "Excuse me?"

"If he’s gone through the trouble of coming three times, the least I can do is grant him an audience."

Evelyn stretched out her legs, wiggling her toes.

Theodore dropped to one knee, sliding her designer heels onto her feet with practiced ease.

"Also," she added, "find me a waitress from the restaurant downstairs—someone with a pretty face and a sweet voice. I have a task for her."

Ten minutes later, Theodore returned with a nervous young woman who fit the description perfectly.

"Ms. Carter!" The waitress bowed deeply, her voice trembling.

"Relax." Evelyn’s lips curved into a faint smile. "I have a small favor to ask. Do well, and you’ll be rewarded."

"I don’t need a reward! Just being here is an honor!" The girl’s cheeks flushed pink. "You’re my idol!"

Evelyn chuckled. She had a fan.

"She has a similar build to me," Evelyn mused. "Theodore, fetch her one of my outfits."

Theodore frowned but obeyed without question.

"Ms. Carter, what would you like me to do?" the waitress asked eagerly.

Evelyn’s smile turned sly. "Nathan Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries, is coming to see me. But I’m not in the mood to deal with him. So, you’ll be meeting him in my place."

The girl paled. "M-Me?"

"Don’t worry." Evelyn tapped her earpiece. "I’ll be listening. Just repeat what I say and act natural."

After three attempts, Nathan finally secured his meeting with Evelyn Carter.

His expression remained stoic, but his pulse betrayed him.

The administrative assistant led him and Oliver toward the elevator. Along the way, Nathan’s striking features drew admiring glances from female staff.

When they reached the elevators, Oliver moved to press the button—only to be stopped.

"This elevator is reserved for Ms. Carter. You’ll need to take the general ones."

Oliver scoffed. "Seriously?"

Nathan didn’t react. He had his own private elevator at Blackwood Industries—this was nothing new.

The elevator ascended smoothly—until it halted at the 30th floor.

"Please exit here," the assistant instructed.

Oliver frowned. "Ms. Carter’s office is on the 40th floor."

"Correct. But this elevator doesn’t go higher."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Explain."

"Only Ms. Carter’s private elevator reaches the top floor. Without her permission, guests must take the stairs."

Oliver’s temper flared. "This is ridiculous!"

The assistant remained impassive. "Your choice."

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Fine. We’ll walk."

Did Evelyn think petty obstacles would deter him?

She had no idea how far he was willing to go.
###Chapter 26

"Mr. Blackwood, I can't go on!" Oliver gasped as they ascended the marble staircase.

The Monarch Grand Hotel boasted extravagant high ceilings, making each flight longer than standard buildings. By the eighth floor, Oliver's breathing had become ragged. His legs shook violently, threatening to collapse beneath him.

"A real man doesn't quit when the finish line's in sight. Just two more floors." Nathan's voice remained steady as he climbed effortlessly.

At thirty-two, Nathan stood two years older than Oliver. His military background with the peacekeeping forces had forged an ironclad physique. Even after leaving service, he maintained rigorous martial arts training that put ordinary men to shame.

He could easily conquer twenty additional floors without breaking sweat. Army night runs had conditioned him for thirty-mile sprints carrying full gear.

When they finally reached the fortieth floor, Oliver collapsed onto the steps, chest heaving. Nathan regarded him with icy disapproval before shaking his head.

"Mr. Blackwood, what a pleasure."

Nathan turned toward the smooth voice. A sharply dressed man approached with practiced politeness. His boyish features - what society called a puppy-dog face - made his age impossible to determine.

"I'm Ms. Carter's executive assistant, Theodore Winslow. She's been expecting you." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "If you'll follow me."

Nathan's jaw tightened. Was that subtle dig about their tardiness? "My apologies. Human legs move slower than elevators. Do convey my regrets to Ms. Carter."

Theodore offered no response, simply pivoting on his polished Oxfords. Oliver, having caught his breath, bristled at the dismissal.

"Who does that pretty boy think he-" Oliver began, but Nathan silenced him with a raised hand.

"Wait here."

Nathan followed Theodore to the imposing double doors of the executive suite. For reasons he couldn't explain, his pulse quickened. Normally unflappable, the prospect of finally confronting the elusive Evelyn Carter unsettled him.

After Theodore's crisp knock, a feminine voice called, "Enter!"

The door swung open, revealing an office that stole Nathan's breath. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating a grand piano in the corner. A rare marble coffee table and vintage leather furnishings spoke of quiet luxury.

But his gaze snagged on the calligraphy hanging behind the desk:

"Hide your strength and bide your time."

"Exquisite craftsmanship," Nathan murmured before he could stop himself.

In the adjacent monitoring room, Evelyn froze mid-bite of her dark chocolate. The compliment, so casually given, sent an unexpected tremor through her. Three years of marriage had yielded zero praise from this man. Now, when it no longer mattered...

She schooled her features, watching through the screens as her proxy greeted him.

The woman at the desk possessed understated elegance - flawless complexion, tasteful designer dress, cascading hair. Everything a proper society woman should be.

Not at all the vindictive heiress Nathan had imagined. This polished version lacked the fire, the razor-sharp edges of the real Evelyn.

"Mr. Blackwood, you must be exhausted. Please, sit." The words came through the proxy's lips, though Evelyn's Bluetooth headset controlled the conversation.

Nathan settled onto the sofa, taking in the office's details. His attention kept returning to that framed calligraphy.

"Do you like it?" Evelyn asked through her proxy, forcing pleasantness into the question.

"It's... refined. Artistic." Nathan's praise came sparingly, as always.

"Then take it as a welcome gift."

"No need. Such art belongs with its owner." His refusal carried the same indifference she remembered so well.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her chocolate. How typical. Even when offering something precious, he'd reject it. Just like he'd rejected her.

The game was just beginning.
###Chapter 27

Evelyn let out a sharp, mocking laugh that echoed through her office. Her assistant, standing nearby, forced an awkward chuckle in response.

Nathan's brows knitted together in frustration.

"Flattered by your admiration, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said, swirling her wine glass. "But there's no need for false modesty. I could produce a hundred such calligraphy pieces before lunch. Consider it a parting gift."

Her lips curled into a smirk as Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. His hands clenched at his sides.

"Let's not pretend this is a social call, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn continued, setting down her glass with deliberate precision. "Why don't we skip the pleasantries and get to why you're really here?"

Nathan exhaled through his nose. "Very well. I'm here regarding your... dispute with Sterling Enterprises. I'm proposing we reach a mutually beneficial arrangement."

His voice carried the weight of authority, his piercing gaze attempting to intimidate. "Surely Monarch Group stands to gain more from an alliance with Blackwood Industries in Crestview."

Evelyn's laughter rang out again, sharp as broken glass. "Dispute? Oh Nathan, you misunderstand. I'm simply exposing fraudulent business practices to protect others from being swindled like we were. Our hotels purchased defective products and were denied justice."

"Perfection is impossible in manufacturing," Nathan countered. "Even luxury car brands issue recalls. Return the defective items - there's no need to publicly smear Sterling's reputation. Bankrupting a mid-sized company through Monarch's influence will damage your own standing in Crestview."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously as she crushed a macaron between her fingers, the crumbs scattering across her desk.

She recognized the veiled threat - if she didn't back down, Blackwood Industries would block Monarch's expansion in Crestview.

The audacity made her blood boil. Did he truly think she'd cower before his empty threats?

"How touching," she purred, "to see you championing your fiancée's family. But business and sentiment make poor bedfellows, Nathan. I won't spare Sterling Enterprises, no matter how romantic your motivations."

Nathan's face darkened, but he had no rebuttal. This wasn't his fight - he was only here for Victoria.

Evelyn watched with satisfaction as discomfort flickered across his usually impassive features.

"Then we have nothing further to discuss," Nathan said stiffly, rising to his feet. Even in defeat, his posture remained rigid with pride. "I'll take my leave."

As he turned, a recorded voice filled the room:

"Ms. Carter, please! I was greedy - Luxe Furnishings approached me first! Damian Sterling proposed the scheme! I thought all mattresses were essentially the same, I didn't realize-"

Nathan whirled around, his face draining of color. The damning confession continued to play as Evelyn crossed her legs, enjoying his visible shock.

"Monarch Group happily supports legitimate small businesses," she said sweetly. "But we root out fraudsters who threaten our interests. Consider your warning noted, Mr. Blackwood. I'll see you across the negotiating table."

Nathan left in stunned silence, every muscle taut with tension.

Outside, Oliver rushed forward. "Sir? What happened? Did she agree?"

Nathan barely registered the questions. His head pounded as Evelyn's words echoed relentlessly.

He'd been so certain the Sterlings were innocent victims of Evelyn's vendetta against him. Instead, he'd been defending their corruption.

Wrenching his tie loose brought no relief. Then - the sharp click of heels behind him.

That distinctive, confident rhythm - was it Evelyn?

His heart lurched as he spun around, but the hallway stood empty.
###Chapter 28

The waitress who had been Evelyn's puppet earlier scrambled to her feet, her legs trembling visibly as she approached.

"I was terrified! Mr. Blackwood is so striking—his presence alone made my face burn. Did I mess up, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn handed her an envelope with a faint smile. "No, you performed perfectly. This is for you."

The waitress gasped as she felt the thick stack of bills inside. "Thank you, Ms. Carter!"

At that moment, Theodore stepped forward, extending a confidentiality agreement.

"I trust your integrity, but for everyone's protection, it's best to sign this."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "If word of today's conversation with Mr. Blackwood reaches anyone, I'll consider it a breach of contract and pursue legal action."

The waitress nodded frantically, scribbled her signature, and swore secrecy before hurrying out.

Theodore chuckled. "Nathan Blackwood, the so-called ruthless tycoon? More like a lovesick fool! Don't you agree, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn snapped out of her daze with a dry laugh. "Indeed. He'd sacrifice his pride for Victoria Sterling without hesitation."

"I heard his ex-wife suffered terribly under him. Now Victoria's reaping the rewards of that poor woman's misery."

Evelyn slammed her palm on the desk, her glare freezing Theodore mid-sentence.

He recoiled, bewildered by her sudden fury.

"Ms. Carter, with tensions high between you and Nathan, what's our next move?" he asked hastily.

"We wait."

"For what?"

Evelyn's lips curled. "When the Sterlings can no longer bear the scandal and send Damian to defend their tainted reputation, we strike. And this time, it'll be fatal."

"Theodore hesitated. "Will Nathan intervene again?"

"Not a chance."

Evelyn's eyes flicked to the calligraphy Nathan had admired earlier. "He was blind to the Sterlings' deceit before. Now that he sees the truth, he'll abandon them. His heart belongs solely to Victoria—he never wastes energy on others. His earlier interference was purely to shield his company from collateral damage. Every move he makes is calculated."

She laughed bitterly, recalling how Nathan had scaled ten flights for Victoria yet couldn't spare a glass of water for Evelyn.

"Nathan, my stomach hurts. Could you bring me water?"

"I'm busy. Ask Agnes."

Her laughter dissolved into red-rimmed eyes.

"You and Victoria deserve each other. Both equally despicable."

Outside, rain hammered the hotel windows, thunder rattling the glass as Nathan departed—his mood as stormy as the weather.

The car's atmosphere was suffocating. Nathan massaged his temples, the beginnings of a migraine prickling behind his eyes.

"Sir, what's Ms. Carter really like?" Oliver ventured. "You've never let anyone unsettle you before."

Nathan's mind flashed to Evelyn's childhood photo—so unlike the sharp, formidable woman they'd just faced. Puberty could explain the transformation, but something gnawed at him.

"Dig deeper into the Kingsley-Sterling feud. I want full reports on Damian and Richard Sterling's recent activities. Immediately."

Back at Blackwood Industries, Nathan plowed through meetings and paperwork until exhaustion forced him back into his chair.

He exhaled heavily, believing his path with Victoria would now be unobstructed—that his restless heart had finally found its anchor.

Yet Evelyn's mocking smile haunted him.

Anchor or noose? The question lingered, unanswered.
###Chapter 29

Nathan Blackwood found no satisfaction in his newfound freedom to pursue love. Instead, he was drowning in guilt over how he'd treated Evelyn Carter during their marriage.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts. Oliver Sinclair burst in clutching a file.

"Mr. Blackwood, I've uncovered something crucial. Monarch Grand Hotels canceled all contracts with Luxe Furnishings over a week ago and severed ties with Sterling Corporation. Yet Monarch Group kept quiet about the furniture defects at the time. The media remained clueless."

Then came Evelyn's shocking marriage announcement and her public smear campaign against Victoria Sterling. That's when Monarch Group exposed Luxe Furnishings' quality issues, creating an industry earthquake.

Nathan's hands trembled as he fumbled for painkillers, swallowing two dry to combat the migraine threatening to split his skull.

"Apparently Vincent Prescott, a VP at the hotel, took massive kickbacks from Sterling Corporation before Ms. Kingsley took charge. When she discovered the substandard mattresses replacing authentic ones, she fired him immediately. The man had worked there twenty years - was personally promoted by Harrison Kingsley! Damn, Ms. Kingsley's got steel in her spine. She's practically your female counterpart, sir."

Despite his annoyance at climbing ten flights (the elevators were down again), Oliver couldn't help admiring Evelyn's ruthlessness.

Nathan massaged his temples. "These events aren't coincidental. They're connected."

Suddenly, he remembered - those sharp staccato heels clicking down the corridor yesterday. He'd know that rhythm anywhere.

"Don't take those pills, Nathan. Let me massage your temples or try acupuncture instead."

"Your pain hurts me too. I want to heal you so neither of us suffers anymore."

Evelyn's tender words haunted him. For a delirious moment, he imagined slender fingers pressing against his throbbing temples.

Goddammit! Not her again. Now he was hallucinating her touch.

Was he actually missing the affection he'd scorned during their marriage? He refused to become that kind of pathetic ex.

As night fell, Nathan's Rolls-Royce glided through rain-slicked streets.

Blackwood Industries headquarters stood just blocks from Monarch Grand Hotel's glittering towers. Nathan had always envied the prime real estate Monarch Group occupied, now valued at nearly $10 billion.

Had poor management not cost them a star rating, it would be Crestview's only six-star hotel.

Evelyn Kingsley's arrival had reversed the hotel's decline, steering it back to glory.

At a red light, Nathan wiped condensation from the window - and froze.

A familiar silhouette stood roadside, umbrella in hand, hailing a cab.

Nathan's pulse skyrocketed. Before rational thought caught up, he was sprinting through the downpour.

"Mr. Blackwood! What the hell?" Oliver scrambled after him, baffled by his boss's erratic behavior since the divorce.

The woman grasped a taxi door handle when an iron grip seized her wrist.

She looked up - and went sheet-white.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

"Ms. Kingsley."

Rain plastered Nathan's hair over his stormy eyes. "Need a ride?"

With a startled cry, she wrenched free and dove into the cab, which sped away.

Oliver caught up, holding an umbrella over his drenched employer. Nathan shoved it aside, chest heaving.

"Evelyn Kingsley...you lying witch!"
###Chapter 30

Nathan Blackwood returned to Cliffside Manor completely soaked, his designer suit clinging to his body like a second skin.

Agnes Thornton rushed forward with a plush towel, but he brushed past her without a word, his jaw clenched tight with barely contained fury.

"What happened? Who dared to upset him?" Agnes whispered urgently to Oliver Sinclair.

"If you've got time, you should comfort Mr. Blackwood. He just got played."

"Impossible! He's the smartest man in Crestview! How could he fall for a scam? Should we call the authorities?" Agnes's hands trembled.

Oliver shook his head grimly. "This is... complicated. The police wouldn't understand. Mr. Blackwood has finally met someone who can outmaneuver him."

"I warned him months ago to install that fraud prevention app! But would he listen? Now look at him!" Agnes wrung her hands.

A bitter smile touched Oliver's lips. His boss had finally encountered someone immune to his usual tactics. Being scammed might actually be less damaging to Nathan's pride.

Nathan ascended the grand staircase with deathly pale skin, his dripping clothes leaving dark trails on the marble steps. In the dim lighting, he resembled a specter risen from the depths.

"Young Master Nathan, Ms. Sterling has arrived. The chairman requests your presence in his study," a maid announced with a curtsy.

Nathan's lips pressed into a bloodless line as he turned toward Leonard Blackwood's private study.

"Nathan! Thank heavens you're here!" Victoria Sterling rushed forward like a drowning woman spotting land, throwing her arms around him.

Nathan remained stiff, his usual warmth conspicuously absent. Seeing Victoria tonight filled him with an inexplicable sense of foreboding.

"Nathan, how did the meeting go? Did you speak with Ms. Kingsley?" Leonard's voice carried the weight of boardroom expectations.

As CEO of Blackwood Industries, Leonard had no business micromanaging such trivial matters. But Lillian Hartwell's nightly complaints had forced his hand.

"Of course Nathan will protect the Sterling family. He adores Victoria! If he personally intervenes, the Kingsleys will have to back down. Monarch Group wouldn't gain anything by making enemies in Crestview!" Lillian clung to her husband's arm, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

It was the same manipulation she'd employed for decades - inflating expectations until any failure would widen the rift between father and son.

"Father, Aunt Lillian, we should cease all assistance to Luxe Furnishings." Nathan's obsidian eyes revealed nothing.

Leonard's brows collided. "Explain yourself."

"Effective immediately, I'm severing all ties with the Sterling family affairs."

Without another word, Nathan turned on his heel and strode out, leaving three stunned figures in his wake.

"Leonard, he can't be serious..." Lillian's smile cracked like drying plaster. A cold dread crept up her spine.

Leonard's expression darkened into a thundercloud, but he remained silent.

Nathan returned to his chambers still dripping, making no move to change or shower. His mind replayed every humiliating moment of his encounter with Evelyn Kingsley.

Why wouldn't she see him face-to-face? Was she intimidated? Or did she consider him beneath her notice?

"Nathan! Why are you doing this?" Victoria's shrill voice shattered his thoughts as she burst in, clutching his arm with desperate strength. "All our orders have been canceled! Our warehouses are overflowing! We can't even pay next week's payroll! Without your help, we're finished!"

In her panic, Victoria abandoned all pretense of demure elegance.

Nathan sighed wearily. "It's late. Oliver will see you home."

"Nathan! What changed? Tell me what happened!"

Exhaustion weighed on Nathan like lead. How could he explain that her brother's greed had sealed their fate?

Then his blood ran cold.

The custom suit box that had sat on his nightstand - Evelyn's parting gift - was gone.

Shaking off Victoria's grasp, Nathan tore through the room in growing panic before bellowing, "Agnes!"

"Yes, Young Master?" The housekeeper appeared instantly.

"Where is the suit that was on my nightstand?" His voice held an edge rarely heard.

"I wouldn't dare touch it, sir. You've always forbidden us from handling anything from the young mistress."
###Chapter 31

Agnes Thornton had warned Ms. Sterling explicitly when she entered Nathan's room. "Don't touch that box on the nightstand," she'd said, casting a meaningful glance at Evelyn Carter, whose face darkened immediately.

The senior housekeeper deliberately addressed Evelyn as "Young Madam" in Victoria Sterling's presence, knowing it would provoke the jealous woman into revealing her actions.

"I threw that damned box away!" Victoria exploded, unable to contain her fury any longer.

Nathan Blackwood's expression turned thunderous. "Where?"

"Why do you care so much about Evelyn's gift?" Victoria's voice cracked with emotion. "We're engaged now! Shouldn't my feelings matter more than some trash from your ex-wife?"

Tears welled up in her eyes - a skill perfected under her mother's tutelage. But Nathan remained unmoved.

"I asked where you threw it." His voice could have frozen hell.

Victoria's fake tears stopped mid-stream. "The... the dumpster in the back."

Without hesitation, Nathan strode into the pouring rain. He rolled up the sleeves of his tailored shirt and began digging through the overflowing trash bin with bare hands.

"Nathan! Stop this madness!" Victoria shrieked from the covered walkway. "It's disgusting!"

Disgusting?

No one in the Blackwood family knew about the five-year-old boy who'd scavenged through garbage to survive. The illegitimate child who'd followed his mother through back alleys, collecting scraps to sell for their next meal.

Filth was his childhood companion. He had no reason to fear it now.

When his fingers finally closed around the sodden box, Nathan exhaled sharply. Agnes arrived with an umbrella just as he pried open the damaged container.

His breath hitched.

The meticulously pressed suit inside had been reduced to ribbons. Someone had taken scissors to every inch of fabric, leaving nothing but shredded memories.

Nathan turned slowly toward Victoria.

She stumbled backward, chilled by the glacial fury in his gaze. For a terrifying moment, she thought he might strike her.

Instead, he walked past without a word.

"Nathan!" Victoria lunged, wrapping her arms around him desperately. "Do you still love her? Is that why you're punishing me?"

"No." The word came out strangled.

"Then why?" She tightened her grip. "It's just some stupid handmade suit! Why does it matter more than my feelings? Every time I see her things, I remember the three years you were married! Doesn't that hurt me too?"

Nathan peeled her arms away with deliberate calm. "What exactly do you want from me?"

He inhaled deeply before continuing. "I divorced her. I'm marrying you against Grandfather's wishes. Yet you destroy her belongings, leak false stories to the press, paint her as the other woman... She's gone, Victoria. When will it be enough?"

Victoria froze as if doused in ice water. He knew everything.

"I did it because I love you!" she cried.

Nathan's expression hardened. "Next time you have a problem, come to me directly. I'll help - so long as it doesn't harm others. But don't disguise your schemes as affection. I particularly dislike being manipulated." His gaze turned piercing. "You announced our engagement to save your father's company. I'll let it slide this once. Don't test me again."

As Nathan walked away, Victoria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood. She'd make Evelyn pay for this humiliation.

Meanwhile, across town...

Evelyn Carter lounged by floor-to-ceiling windows, watching rain patter against the glass. A vintage opera record spun lazily on the turntable.

Theodore Winslow swirled his wine thoughtfully. "Ms. Carter, the waitress just called. Nathan intercepted her after her shift tonight. He knows she's just a lookalike now."

Setting down his glass, Theodore knelt to massage Evelyn's aching feet - a habitual kindness after her long days in heels.

"I expected he'd find out," Evelyn mused, flexing her toes appreciatively. "Just not this soon."

Her eyes gleamed with calculation. "First the Sterlings. Then the Blackwoods. After Grandfather Reginald's little performance today, how could I possibly ignore his challenge?"
###Chapter 32

Victoria left in tears.

The household staff had never liked her. Every time she visited, she would put on a dramatic performance—only to storm out weeping moments later.

Nathan sat rigidly on the sofa, his gaze fixed on the ruined suit in front of him.

"Young Master Nathan, you should rest. Have some warm milk before bed."

Agnes entered with a steaming glass, but when she saw the shredded fabric, she couldn't help but sigh. "What a waste."

Her words carried a deeper meaning.

"Next time Victoria comes, make sure she doesn't enter my room—or Evelyn’s," Nathan ordered in a low voice.

"Of course, Young Master. I won’t let her near either!"

Agnes nodded firmly. "Thankfully, I locked the young madam’s door today. Otherwise, Ms. Sterling might have barged in and destroyed her things too."

"Agnes," Nathan frowned. "Victoria isn’t malicious. I owe her for the past three years."

"And what about the young madam?" Agnes retorted, her voice rising. "What did Evelyn ever do to deserve this? You divorced her. Don’t you feel any guilt?"

"Grandfather forced my hand back then. She didn’t have to marry me if she didn’t want to."

"So you’re saying she brought this upon herself?"

Nathan’s lips thinned into a pale line.

"You should rest. I won’t disturb you further."

Agnes stormed out, taking the milk with her.

Nathan blinked in disbelief.

Was she seriously angry at me? I wanted that milk.

A bitter thought crossed his mind. When did Evelyn bribe Agnes? What a conniving woman.

Victoria returned home humiliated, delivering the devastating news.

Without the Blackwood family’s backing, the Sterling empire would collapse. Recovery would be nearly impossible.

"What the hell is Nathan thinking?" Damian slammed an ashtray onto the table, his eyes burning with fury. "He claims to love you, yet he refuses to lift a finger to help us! Does he think we’re fools?"

"He does love me!" Victoria sobbed. "He divorced Evelyn for me!"

"He’s just weighing his options!" Damian scoffed. "You’re a Sterling—an heiress. Who the hell is Evelyn? Some nobody from the countryside! Any man with half a brain would choose you!"

Victoria flinched. Though her brother meant to defend her, his words stung like an insult.

"Rose," her father pressed urgently. "Why did Nathan suddenly change his mind? What happened?"

"I don’t know!" she cried. "He met with Sebastian Kingsley today. After that, he refused to help us. Father, Damian—did you do something behind his back? He seems to despise us now!"

"Damn it!" Damian’s eyes darkened with realization. "It’s because of Evelyn, isn’t it?"

Victoria froze. "What do you mean?"

"A few nights ago, I was at Julian Montgomery’s new club when that crazy woman started trouble. Nathan showed up out of nowhere to rescue his ex-wife—and forced me to apologize to her!" Damian spat, still seething.

Victoria’s blood boiled. Jealousy twisted her insides.

I knew it. Nathan’s falling for that witch. This is exactly what I feared. I won’t let Evelyn steal him back.

"Enough," her mother interjected coldly. "Once Rose marries Nathan and becomes the lady of Blackwood Industries, none of this will matter. Evelyn is nothing—just a discarded woman. How much trouble can she possibly cause?"

"Our priority," she continued, "is to salvage our company’s reputation. And for that… we need a scapegoat."

"A scapegoat?"

Damian’s lips curled into a sinister smile. "I know just the man."
###Chapter 33

The Sterling family was in complete chaos. Their once prestigious name had become tarnished overnight. The Luxe Furnishings showrooms across Crestview stood deserted.

To compound their misery, Nathan Blackwood had withdrawn all support. Without immediate intervention, they'd face bankruptcy the moment the Blackwood Industries capital ran dry.

The Kingsley family had masterfully turned public opinion against them by exposing Luxe Furnishings' substandard merchandise. After months of silence, Monarch Grand Hotels suddenly dominated headlines again.

Following your orders, I had someone discreetly trail Vincent Prescott after his resignation. He'd met with Damian Sterling multiple times.

Theodore Winslow gently held Evelyn Carter's delicate hand, carefully applying cuticle oil to her freshly manicured burgundy nails. "Your intuition was correct about his intentions."

"He took bribes and conspired with Damian to sabotage our hotels. This proves their collusion."

Evelyn smiled contentedly, enjoying Theodore's attentive care.

"The Sterlings are holding a press conference this weekend. I'll make sure to give them a proper spectacle."

Evelyn was so eager about the new mattress delivery that she personally went to the hotel's service entrance with Theodore to inspect them.

"Ms. Carter, you needn't trouble yourself with such manual labor. The housekeeping manager and I can handle this," Theodore said gently.

"I'm no fragile socialite. I've fired weapons and carried over a dozen wounded soldiers across battlefields. I've saved hundreds of lives. Checking mattresses is nothing."

As she spoke, a shadow of sorrow flickered in Evelyn's bright eyes.

Nathan Blackwood had been among those she rescued on the Eldermere battlefield.

Bullets had rained around them that day. Nathan took hits to his leg and shoulder, lying in a growing pool of blood as he screamed at Evelyn to leave him.

"Go! Save yourself!"

"Get out of here! Now!"

"No! I won't abandon you! We leave together or not at all!"

Back then, Evelyn had been prepared to die with Nathan. The idea of carrying his 6'3" frame across that warzone seemed impossible.

She'd even wondered if dying together counted as being together in the end.

Sharing life's hardships, then resting together in death.

She'd had no regrets!

A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips now as a sharp pang shot through her chest.

Nathan, she thought, I can't believe my shattered heart still aches for you.

Evelyn regretted meeting Nathan when she'd been so young and naive.

At the loading dock, workers were unloading the mattresses when Evelyn and Theodore arrived. The housekeeping manager looked impressed seeing Evelyn personally inspecting the delivery.

With Theodore's assistance, Evelyn climbed into the truck, randomly selected a mattress, tore open its packaging, tested its firmness, and finally sat on it. Satisfied, she nodded.

"Excellent. Proceed with unloading."

Just then, the roaring engine of an electric blue Lamborghini approached the hotel.

Luxury cars frequently passed near the service entrance en route to the underground parking, but this time was different.

Because behind the wheel sat Julian Montgomery, Crestview's so-called "Prince."

One hand on the steering wheel, his other arm draped around a voluptuous, pouting woman.

Sunglasses shielding his eyes, Julian casually glanced sideways.

His gaze landed on Evelyn, radiant even while helping workers maneuver a mattress.

Their bar encounter had left Julian intrigued - her bold sensuality like a rare midnight bloom. Now in professional attire, she exuded a different allure: polished, commanding, effortlessly chic.

Unlike the spoiled socialites Julian usually entertained, Evelyn worked without hesitation, unafraid to get her hands dirty.

A predatory smile curved Julian's lips.

"Country girls really are something else."
###Chapter 34

Julian Montgomery arrived at the Monarch Grand Hotel's restaurant with his latest fling.

The moment their appetizers arrived, his date immediately pulled out her phone to photograph the artfully arranged dishes.

"Put that damn phone away," Julian snapped, his fingers drumming impatiently on the linen tablecloth. "Are you some starving peasant who's never seen truffle risotto before?"

His date's face flushed crimson as she shoved the device back into her designer purse, her appetite clearly ruined.

As dessert was being cleared, the restaurant's maître d' approached with practiced professionalism. "Mr. Montgomery, was everything to your satisfaction this evening?"

"The wagyu was acceptable," Julian remarked, dabbing his lips with a napkin. "Though the sommelier could stand to learn proper decanting techniques."

His companion chose that moment to slam her fork down with unnecessary force. "That filet was like chewing leather! And the wine tasted like vinegar!"

Julian's expression darkened dangerously, his knuckles whitening around his water glass.

The maître d' maintained perfect composure. "Your feedback is invaluable, madam. We'll certainly review our preparation methods. My deepest apologies for the disappointment."

"Don't waste your breath," Julian drawled, eyeing his date with open contempt. "She couldn't distinguish Kobe beef from dog food if her life depended on it."

His date shrank in her seat, too intimidated to respond.

With deliberate theatrics, Julian produced his alligator-skin wallet and tossed a thick stack of hundreds onto the table. The crisp bills fanned out like playing cards.

In Crestview's cashless society, only old-money eccentrics like Julian still carried physical currency.

"Consider this compensation for enduring her theatrics," Julian said, leaning forward with sudden intensity. "Now tell me - does an Evelyn Carter work at this establishment?"

The maître d' didn't so much as glance at the money. "Monarch Grand employees are strictly prohibited from accepting gratuities, sir. As for your inquiry, we have no staff member by that name."

Julian's smirk faltered. "That's impossible." His voice took on an edge. "I saw her unloading supplies at the service entrance not two hours ago. Check your damn records before lying to me."

"With all due respect, Mr. Montgomery," the maître d' replied smoothly, "having managed this restaurant for eighteen years, I'm quite familiar with every employee. The woman you describe doesn't exist in our system."

As the maître d' retreated, Julian's brooding was interrupted by a vision in emerald silk gliding through the restaurant doors.

Evelyn Carter moved with effortless grace, her posture perfect despite the simple hotel uniform. Her eyes briefly widened at spotting Julian, but her expression quickly schooled into professional neutrality.

Though married to Nathan Blackwood for three years, Evelyn might as well have been a ghost for all the recognition she'd received. No social introductions, no public appearances - just gilded isolation in Cliffside Manor.

Julian knew better than most how close Nathan guarded his inner circle. The fact that Julian remained Nathan's closest confidant despite their polar opposite personalities spoke volumes.

Evelyn's relief at the empty restaurant was palpable. One "Mrs. Blackwood" from a passing employee would shatter her carefully constructed anonymity.

Julian's gaze tracked Evelyn like a predator sighting prey. His date noticed the shift immediately, her manicured nails digging into the tablecloth.

There was no mistaking the hunger in Julian's stare - a look he'd never bestowed upon her.

Evelyn ordered an espresso before settling at a corner table, scrolling through her phone with studied indifference.

"Evelyn!" Julian called, already striding toward her. "Fancy meeting you here for lunch."

She glanced up, her eyes cool. "Just my break. I work here now."

Julian's lips quirked. Of course he knew. He'd had her followed since the divorce papers were signed. But her blunt admission intrigued him - most women would've invented some elaborate cover story.

"Tsk tsk," he chided, perching on the edge of her table. "Sebastian should be keeping a treasure like you in penthouse luxury, not slumming it in hotel service. What kind of brother forces his sister to work like some common laborer?"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp enough to draw blood. "Kept woman? Nathan had me under house arrest for three years. I've had my fill of gilded cages, Mr. Montgomery."

Julian actually recoiled at her venom.

"After leaving Nathan," Evelyn continued, voice steely, "I vowed to build my own life. No more depending on Kingsley money or Blackwood influence. Sebastian's giving me this chance to stand on my own two feet - something you spoiled trust fund babies would never understand."

Julian opened his mouth, then closed it with an awkward chuckle.

"Your companion looks ready to stab me with a butter knife," Evelyn observed dryly. "Perhaps you should return to your date before she files harassment charges?"

Julian waved a dismissive hand. "That gold-digger? Please. If I married every woman I've slept with, I'd have more ex-wives than the Sultan of Brunei."
###Chapter 35

Julian Montgomery's mesmerizing gaze darkened as he tilted his head slightly. "Let's have dinner tonight. I'll pick you up from work." His voice was smooth, laced with confidence. "Name the restaurant—anywhere you want."

Evelyn Carter crossed her arms, irritation flashing in her eyes. "I have a boyfriend, Mr. Montgomery."

A smirk played on Julian's lips. "I don't care if you had an ex-husband, let alone a boyfriend."

Julian had never been one to conform to society's expectations. He pursued what—or rather, who—he wanted without hesitation.

"If you're worried about being seen," he continued smoothly, "we can go to my private villa. My personal chef rivals Michelin-starred talent. Consider it an exclusive dining experience."

Evelyn arched a brow, her thoughts sharp. Where the hell is my coffee?

If she had it in her hands right now, she'd throw it straight in his face—maybe that would snap him out of his delusion.

Just then, Julian's phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen—Nathan Blackwood.

"Excuse me," he said smoothly, stepping away.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Good riddance.

The moment Julian disappeared, her coffee finally arrived.

She barely had time to take a sip before Julian's date—some socialite with too much perfume and not enough self-awareness—strutted up to her.

The woman hadn't heard Julian's earlier conversation with Evelyn. All she knew was that Evelyn was the employee Julian had been asking about.

Her lips curled in disdain. How dare this nobody catch Julian Montgomery's attention?

"Listen here," she hissed, leaning in. "If you know what's good for you, stay away from Mr. Montgomery. Unless you want to lose your job."

Evelyn wrinkled her nose, waving a hand in front of her face. The woman's perfume was suffocating.

Does Julian have no sense of smell?

Evelyn didn't even bother looking at her. "And if I don't?"

"I'll file a complaint. You'll be out on the street by tomorrow."

Evelyn finally met her gaze, a slow smirk forming. "Oh? On what grounds? That you're upset he spoke to me?"

The woman's face flushed crimson. "You—!"

"Go ahead," Evelyn said coolly. "Submit it. I'm sure the only response you'll get is a recommendation to see a therapist."

"Bitch!"

The woman's jealousy boiled over. In a flash, she lunged for Evelyn's coffee, intending to humiliate her.

But Evelyn was faster.

Splash.

A sharp gasp echoed through the café as the scalding liquid hit the woman's face.

Her makeup melted, her designer dress ruined. She stood frozen, lips trembling in shock.

Evelyn calmly picked up a napkin, dabbing a stray drop of coffee from her own hand. Then she smiled—bright, lethal.

"I knew one of us was walking away hurt. So I made sure it wasn't me."

Julian answered the call in the hallway. "Nathan. What's up?"

"It's your mother's birthday in two days," Nathan said without preamble. "Come help me pick a gift. I have no idea what to get her."

Julian chuckled. "She adores you. You could hand her a weed from the sidewalk, and she'd frame it. Just grab anything."

"No. Come with me tonight."

"Can't. I have plans."

"Reschedule."

Julian clicked his tongue. "I already told her I'd take her to dinner. Standing her up isn't an option."

He hesitated. Maybe he should be honest. He wasn't the type to sneak around.

Taking a breath, he said firmly, "I won't lie to you. I'm interested in Evelyn."

Silence.

Dead, heavy silence.

Julian frowned, checking his screen to make sure the call hadn't dropped.

Then Nathan's voice came through—icy, dangerous.

"Are you with Evelyn right now?"
###Chapter 36

Julian Montgomery's words were cut short by a piercing scream from the restaurant.

His blood ran cold as realization struck - he'd left his date alone with Evelyn Carter. That was a disaster waiting to happen.

"Man, I gotta go. Can't make it tonight. See you tomorrow!" Julian said hurriedly.

Just as he was about to hang up, Nathan Blackwood's sharp voice stopped him. "Julian Montgomery! Where the hell are you?"

Another scream, even more shrill than before, echoed through the phone.

"Monarch Grand Hotels restaurant!" Julian shouted before sprinting back inside.

The scene that greeted him froze him in his tracks.

Nathan's delicate-looking ex-wife had his date pinned face-first against the table, one arm twisted painfully behind her back. The woman couldn't even twitch.

Julian's lips curled into an impressed smile. This looked straight out of an action movie where the badass female lead takes down the villain.

All his worries about Evelyn being bullied evaporated instantly.

Leaning against the doorframe, he crossed his arms and enjoyed the show with amusement.

"I'll sue you! You'll never work in Crestview again!" his date shrieked, her face contorted against the table surface.

"Better hurry to the hospital then," Evelyn replied coolly. "Those bruises will fade by tomorrow. Won't even qualify as assault."

Evelyn's expression remained impassive throughout. She wouldn't have lifted a finger if this woman hadn't tried to attack her first.

"Mr. Montgomery! Help me!" the woman wailed when she spotted Julian.

"Alright, sweetheart, that's enough." Julian stepped forward to pull Evelyn away, his tone gentle rather than scolding. He'd seen crazier catfights over him before.

His main concern was Evelyn being Nathan's ex. If this got out, it would cause quite the scandal.

"Mr. Montgomery! How can you say that's enough? This bitch assaulted me! She humiliated me!" His date clutched her disheveled hair in outrage.

Evelyn calmly took a seat, crossing her long legs as she regarded the hysterical woman like one would a circus act.

Julian's gaze traveled appreciatively over Evelyn's figure, lingering on her delicate feet in designer stilettos. Damn, she's breathtaking. How is someone this gorgeous even real?

"You must have provoked Ms. Carter first, didn't you?" Julian asked, looking directly at Evelyn.

"Apologize? To her?" His date's face turned crimson with rage.

"You're into me. Ms. Carter isn't. Simple math says you started this," Julian stated matter-of-factly.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, mildly impressed by his logic - a stark contrast to Nathan's usual irrationality.

"How could you do this to me? I'm your girlfriend!" the woman sobbed, lunging for Julian.

He sidestepped with a look of disgust, nearly making her fall. "Girlfriend? When did I ever agree to that?"

Julian's eyes turned icy. His date immediately stifled her sobs, recognizing the danger in his expression.

"Apologize and get out of my sight. Permanently."

Everyone in Crestview knew Julian's temper. Charming when happy, but cross him and he'd burn the world down.

"I-I'm sorry!" The woman gritted her teeth, offering a forced apology before fleeing with her face covered.

Turning to Evelyn, Julian's expression instantly softened. "My apologies, Ms. Carter."

"You made her apologize to me. We're square." Evelyn checked her watch and stood. "I need to return to work. Enjoy your evening, Mr. Montgomery."

Julian, an avid watch collector, immediately recognized the rare Richard Mille on Evelyn's wrist - a global limited edition worth a fortune.

Sebastian Kingsley must really dote on his sister. Even I wouldn't be that generous.

And here she was wearing a fortune while doing menial work. Truly a country girl who didn't appreciate luxury.

"Ms. Carter, what time do you finish work? I'll pick you up tonight," Julian called after her retreating figure.
###Chapter 37

"Don't bother waiting for me."

Evelyn dismissed Julian Montgomery with a careless smile. "I won't be dining with you."

Julian clicked his tongue in disapproval. "Must you be so cruel? Can't you at least share a meal as thanks for helping you deal with Damian Sterling that first time at VELVET?"

A mocking laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "If I recall correctly, it was Nathan Blackwood who came to my rescue. How shameless of you to steal his credit behind his back."

"Ms. Carter, have I somehow offended you?" Julian's gaze burned with intensity. "Why won't you give me a chance? Just because you're with Sebastian? Would Sebastian Kingsley dare publicly claim you as his girlfriend? I would!"

"Mr. Montgomery, love isn't about first come first served," Evelyn countered coolly. "But I have my principles and morals."

Julian's face paled instantly, shame washing over his features.

"I may not come from wealth, but I have standards. When Nathan and I married, he was the only man I loved. Now that Sebastian Kingsley, CEO of Monarch Group, is my partner, he's the only one in my heart. I make my own choices - I won't tolerate being forced into anything. Mr. Montgomery, please respect my boundaries and stop harassing me."

Evelyn's chest ached as she spoke these words.

Even Julian could see the barely contained pain darkening her eyes.

She inhaled sharply, lifted her chin with renewed composure, and turned to leave.

Then she froze mid-step.

"Nathan?!" Julian's eyes widened in shock.

Nathan had arrived impossibly fast. Had he teleported?

At the restaurant entrance, Nathan stood radiating icy fury that seemed to freeze the air-conditioned space into an arctic tundra.

Evelyn met his smoldering gaze.

Those striking eyes - slightly upturned with a reddish tint, irises gleaming like polished gemstones - still held their dangerous allure.

She hated that even now, his beauty could still affect her.

Yet throughout their three-year marriage, Nathan had shown her nothing but indifference. Never a smile, never affection.

Foolishly, she'd believed persistence could change him, that her efforts might one day earn his love. In the end, only she had changed.

Nathan advanced, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

When he'd learned Julian was with Evelyn, Nathan had canceled his afternoon meeting without hesitation and sped over personally.

Hearing Evelyn's words to Julian had hollowed out his chest, leaving an ache he couldn't name.

Then anger surged - an emotion he rarely indulged, yet one Evelyn always seemed to provoke.

"What are you doing here?" Nathan demanded, studying Evelyn's face.

"I'm working." She turned away, unwilling to engage further.

"Have you forgotten what I said?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously. "Until our divorce is finalized, we're still married, which means you're still a Blackwood. You know full well our families are sworn enemies, yet you work at a Kingsley-owned hotel? What were you thinking? Trying to provoke me? Disgust me? Slap me in the face?" Veins bulged at his temples as he struggled for control.

Julian moved to intervene, but Evelyn spoke first.

"Oh, so that's what you think."

She slowly lowered her indifferent gaze back to Nathan's handsome face. "In that case, let's finalize the divorce today. I'm tired of you haunting me like some vengeful spirit, glaring at me with such hatred whenever we meet."

"Evelyn Carter!" Nathan's brow furrowed sharply.

"Did you bring your documents? Have Oliver deliver them. I carry mine everywhere, just in case the opportunity arises."

With a mocking smile, Evelyn brushed past Nathan without a backward glance. She felt no longing for him.

Nathan's eyes reddened instantly.

He suddenly seized her slender arm with frightening force, as if terrified she might vanish forever beyond his reach.

Then - a sickening pop.

Evelyn gasped as white-hot pain shot through her arm, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

Nathan froze, his pulse pounding violently.

He'd just dislocated Evelyn's arm.
###Chapter 38

"Damn it, Nathan! Have you lost your mind?!"

Julian's voice cracked through the air like a whip.

Evelyn's face drained of color. Her slender arms hung limp at her sides, beads of cold sweat glistening on her porcelain forehead.

Julian's heart ached at the sight, but Nathan remained stone-faced.

Nathan's fist unclenched as he stumbled backward, lips parting in shock.

"Ms. Carter, your shoulder's dislocated! We need to get you to Kingsley Medical immediately!"

Julian moved to help, but Evelyn sidestepped him with glacial precision. "I don't need your help."

"How exactly will you fix this yourself?" Julian's voice rose in alarm.

"That's none of your concern!"

Evelyn's glare could have frozen lava. She put every ounce of remaining strength into keeping distance between them.

Julian froze, hands hovering uselessly in the air.

Nathan studied his ex-wife's trembling form with newfound clarity. The woman before him bore no resemblance to the docile wife he'd known.

For three years, she'd been all soft smiles and gentle gestures, bending over backward to please him. Back then, Nathan had resented the arranged marriage, and her efforts only fueled his irritation. Eventually, he'd felt nothing but disgust.

Now separated, that radiant smile had vanished from his life, replaced by this seething hostility. So why did he find this version of her... fascinating?

"Stop deluding yourself, Nathan."

Evelyn's breath came in short gasps, her eyes burning crimson. "I'm here to work. I didn't come to humiliate you or slap you across the face. I just want to rebuild my life after you threw me away. You ended our marriage without a second thought, so why can't you let me move on? Are you still hung up on me?" Her laugh held no mirth. "No, that's not it. You just can't stand seeing me thrive without you."

Nathan's pupils contracted sharply, throat working as if swallowing shards of glass.

Evelyn's smile turned brittle. "Want to see me heartbroken over losing you? That ship has sailed, Nathan. For three years, I drowned in misery every single day. Leaving you was my salvation. Don't approach me again before Grandfather's birthday. I never want to lay eyes on you."

She turned away. The agony in her chest eclipsed the throbbing in her shoulder, leaving her numb.

Truthfully, she could've popped the joint back into place right then. But she needed to feel this pain - needed to remember what Nathan's touch cost her.

Suddenly, strong hands gripped her waist, lifting her effortlessly off the ground.

Nathan had swept her into a bridal carry from behind.

"Put me down!" Evelyn's cheeks flamed as she struggled against his unyielding hold.

The more she fought, the tighter his arms became, pressing her soft curves against the hard planes of his chest. She could feel his heartbeat - rapid but steady - beneath her fingertips. That familiar sandalwood scent she'd once loved clung to his clothes.

Tears pricked her eyes unexpectedly. How many nights had she sprayed that cologne on her pillows, pretending he was there? Back then, it had brought comfort. Now, the memory only brought shame.

"You need medical attention. Dislocations aren't to be taken lightly."

Nathan's expression remained impassive, but his eyes darkened dangerously.

"Let go! You couldn't care less when we were married. You forfeited all rights to touch me the moment those divorce papers were signed!" Humiliation and rage made her voice raw. But Nathan simply adjusted his grip, jaw tightening as he strode forward without another word.
###Chapter 39

Julian Montgomery clicked his tongue in disapproval and rushed after Evelyn. "Ms. Carter is right! It's completely inappropriate for you to touch her now that you're divorced. Ms. Carter, let me carry you instead!"

"Get lost!"

Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn snapped in unison. Nathan's eyes burned with intensity, while Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink.

Julian smirked to himself. Interesting. They still act like a married couple.

At Kingsley Medical Center, Evelyn was wheeled into the emergency room while Nathan and Julian waited in the sterile white corridor.

"Nathan, you're brutal. How could you yank her slender arm like that? Were you trying to dislocate it?" Julian shook his head, his expression full of reproach.

"How did you know she worked there?" Nathan's voice was icy, his piercing gaze sharp with suspicion.

"I stopped by for lunch and saw her doing manual labor near the service entrance. She was working so diligently—you'd never guess she used to be your wife." Julian's lips curved in admiration. "She's humble, resilient, and knows exactly when to stand her ground. Truly the most remarkable woman I've ever met."

Nathan's fists clenched, his knuckles turning white. "Then you clearly haven't met enough women."

"At least I can recognize a treasure when I see one, unlike some people." Julian scoffed, deliberately provoking him.

Nathan's chest tightened painfully.

"Honestly, I have a feeling you two will reconcile."

"Impossible." Nathan's voice was rough, strained.

"It's obvious you still care. Otherwise, why rush over the moment you heard? Look at you—dropping everything to see her, staring at her like she's the only person in the room. How can you deny it?"

Julian leaned against the wall, arms crossed, shaking his head in amusement. "You're unbelievable. You divorced her for your precious Victoria, yet you lose your mind seeing her with someone else. What's the plan? Collecting wives like Harrison Kingsley?"

"She promised Grandfather we wouldn't finalize the divorce until after his birthday. She needs to honor that."

"She only agreed to delay it out of respect for Reginald. Yet here you are, clinging to her like a lifeline. Pathetic."

"Stay out of it." Nathan's breathing grew uneven.

"I would, except I'm interested in Ms. Carter. So let's settle this now—stop interfering with my woman." Julian's tone was uncharacteristically serious.

"Give it up. You're not her type." Nathan's expression darkened.

"She won't know unless she tries."

"Nathan Blackwood!"

Julian ignored Nathan's thunderous glare, tilting his head with a defiant smirk. "But if you've changed your mind—if you want her back before marrying Victoria—I'll back off. You're my only real friend, after all. But if you go through with the wedding and still harass Evelyn? I won't stand by you. I'll help her fight you."

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, his jaw rigid.

"Julian Montgomery!"

A furious roar shattered the tense silence.

Nathan barely turned before a fist collided with his cheekbone.
###Chapter 40

Nathan Blackwood had graduated from West Point and served three years as an elite special forces operative. Even after leaving the military to take over Blackwood Industries, he maintained peak physical condition.

Dominic Kingsley's punch barely made Nathan stagger, leaving only a faint bruise at the corner of his lips.

Damn love rival! Julian Montgomery cursed internally but kept his expression neutral.

He remembered Evelyn's warning - he was the interloper in their relationship and shouldn't overstep.

Dominic swung again, but Nathan dodged effortlessly.

"Nathan Blackwood! I warned you to stay away from Evelyn!" Dominic's voice shook with rage. "You heartless bastard!"

His chest heaved violently, eyes bloodshot. "If anything happens to Evelyn, I'll make you pay! Your company won't survive this!"

"Mr. Kingsley, you're overreacting," Julian interjected nervously. "It's just a minor dislocation-"

"Just a dislocation?!" Dominic's lips twisted in fury.

"You treat women like disposable toys! How could you possibly understand?" His voice cracked. "Evelyn means everything to me. I'll protect her with my life. Stay the hell away from her!"

Every word carried deadly sincerity.

Evelyn was his priority - even above his own wife.

Nathan's eyelashes fluttered. Such raw, unfiltered devotion. He'd never dared express love so boldly.

Since leaving Nathan, Evelyn had blossomed into someone extraordinary. Both Sebastian Kingsley and Julian Montgomery now pursued her relentlessly.

A bitter taste filled Nathan's mouth.

He felt like a fool who'd discarded a priceless gem, only to watch others covet it. And now he wanted it back.

"Mark my words, Blackwood. I'll sue you into oblivion!" Dominic jabbed a finger at Nathan's impassive face, already planning to send Maxwell after him.

"By all means," Nathan replied coolly. "Though I should clarify - our divorce isn't finalized. Legally, Evelyn remains my wife and a Blackwood."

Julian nearly choked. This man knew exactly where to strike.

Dominic trembled with suppressed violence, too refined to actually spit.

"Mr. Kingsley."

A soft, crystalline voice cut through the tension. All three men turned.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, her left arm encased in plaster. Pale but composed, she looked heartbreakingly fragile - a porcelain doll abandoned in the empty hospital corridor.

Nathan's throat tightened.

The fluorescent lights haloed her delicate features, her luminous eyes shining with quiet strength. All three men felt the instinctive urge to shield her.

A fragmented memory surfaced - Evelyn laughing in sunlight, her hair like spun gold. Then it vanished, leaving only a sharp pain behind his temples.

"Evelyn!" Dominic rushed to her side, eyes rimmed red. "Does it hurt?"

"Not anymore." She smiled gently at her brother, the warmth in her expression transforming her entire face. "Let's go home."

The sight inexplicably irritated Nathan.

Dominic slipped a protective arm around Evelyn's slender waist, guiding her away without so much as a backward glance.

Nathan moved to follow when Julian grabbed his arm.

"Enough, Nathan. You caused her injury. Don't you realize she called Sebastian here deliberately? She wants to see him, not you. Don't humiliate yourself further."

Watching Sebastian support Evelyn as they disappeared down the corridor, Nathan's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened.

Dominic summoned Theodore Winslow, who arrived bewildered.

"Ms. Carter! What happened? Who did this to you?"

"That bastard Nathan Blackwood!" Evelyn hissed through gritted teeth.
###Chapter 41

Nathan's jaw clenched with barely contained rage. He wanted to say more, but Evelyn's warning glare silenced him instantly.

"What?! I'm going to make that bastard pay for hurting you!"

Theodore's fists balled in fury, ready to confront Nathan, but Evelyn stopped him with a gentle touch. "Don't. You can't win against him. He served in the peacekeeping forces - you'd just end up as his punching bag."

"Besides," she added, wincing as she adjusted her sling, "he didn't mean to dislocate my shoulder. He's always been careless with his strength. Some things never change."

"Ms. Carter," Theodore frowned, "you speak as if you've known him for years."

Evelyn froze, crimson lips pressing into a thin line. The silence stretched uncomfortably.

Theodore didn't know about her past with Nathan. It wasn't intentional deception - just exhaustion from explaining complicated history. That chapter was closed anyway, with no intention of reopening it.

Back at the villa, Dominic prepared coffee while muttering curses about "that Blackwood jinx."

"I'm sorry, Dom." Evelyn's lashes fluttered guiltily.

"What? Why are you apologizing to me?" Dominic's brows shot up. He reached to feel her forehead. "Are you running a fever? What nonsense is this?"

"It's just... I feel bad for dragging you into my mess." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "With Sebastian away in Valmont, you're the only one I could ask. I don't want you to think I'm using you as... as some prop."

Dominic's expression softened. He pulled her into a careful embrace, mindful of her injury. "Silly girl, that's what brothers are for."

"Mom had us four first precisely so we could protect you." He chuckled. "Next time you get married, we'll all walk you down the aisle!"

Then, realizing his blunder, he quickly amended, "Not that you need to marry at all! We'll always have your back, princess. Consider us your personal knights for life."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Walk me down the aisle? At that rate, I might as well take vows of celibacy."

Meanwhile, Nathan's foul mood darkened the boardroom. The afternoon's meetings passed in a blur - executives' reports falling on deaf ears. His split lip and thunderous expression discouraged any questions.

Though technically Gregory Blackwood's illegitimate son, Nathan commanded absolute respect at Blackwood Industries. Gregory's legitimate heir remained wheelchair-bound in Regarton, his health deteriorating. The two daughters from Gregory's second wife Penelope showed no business acumen.

This left Nathan as undisputed successor - his competence silencing early opposition.

"Mr. Blackwood," a senior manager ventured nervously, "the Walter Group hotel in the western suburbs... it's been acquired."

"By whom?" Nathan's focus snapped back like a whip.

"Monarch Group. Walter transferred it to them. It'll become the second Monarch Grand Hotel in Crestview."

Nathan's body tensed, eyes turning stormy. "Why wasn't I informed sooner?"

"We were finalizing negotiations when Ms. Kingsley from Monarch intercepted the deal. Completely unexpected, sir." The manager paled.

"Finalizing? Sounds like you're ready for retirement." Nathan's voice dropped dangerously. "I explicitly said that location is strategic - six hundred meters from the future Universal Studios site. I wanted it secured at any cost."

"But your team hesitated. Now Monarch reaps the benefits." His glare could freeze lava. "Pack for Fenns branch next week. Another failure, and not even your decade of service will save you."

Nathan stormed out, leaving shell-shocked executives in his wake. Today's temper was exceptional even for him.

During the drive to Cliffside Manor, Oliver kept stealing uneasy glances at the rearview mirror. "Sir, after Ms. Sterling attacked Mrs. Blackwood, we severed all Gold family contracts and exposed their product defects. Was this... part of your plan? Not that they didn't deserve it—"

Nathan's sharp gaze cut him off mid-sentence. Oliver nearly choked.

"Pull over at that tailor shop ahead."
###Chapter 42

Nathan Blackwood shoved the tailor shop door open with such force that the bell above it jangled violently. His broad shoulders nearly filled the entire doorway.

The elderly tailor glanced up from pressing a suit jacket, his eyes widening at the sight of the imposing figure.

"Oh! Mr. Blackwood!"

"I need your help," Nathan said, his deep voice clipped. "Cost isn't an issue."

His jaw tightened as he placed a battered box on the counter. The tailor gasped when he lifted the lid.

"Good heavens! What happened to this masterpiece?" The old man's hands trembled as he examined the ruined suit. "Such exquisite craftsmanship destroyed!"

Nathan swallowed hard. "My fault."

His fingers brushed the torn fabric. "She stitched every seam by hand. Stayed up night after night working on it." His throat constricted. "I watched her pour her soul into this."

The tailor sighed mournfully. "Such dedication... such a waste."

"Can you repair it?" Nathan demanded.

"The lining, perhaps. But the outer fabric?" The tailor shook his head. "The damage is too severe."

Something twisted in Nathan's chest at those words.

"Do what you can," he said roughly. "I don't care about visible mending. Just... make it whole again."

When Nathan returned to Cliffside Manor, tension hung thick in the air.

"Nathan!"

His half-sister Cassandra rushed toward him, her face pale. "Grandfather's here. He and Father are arguing upstairs. It's terrible! You need to calm them down!"

Nathan's brow arched. "What's the fight about?"

He found it ironic. Leonard Blackwood prided himself on being the model filial son.

Reginald Blackwood's recent stroke meant he shouldn't be agitated. Yet Leonard was risking his carefully cultivated reputation by confronting his father head-on.

There could only be one reason—Penelope.

"Victoria's practically family," Cassandra huffed, stomping her foot. "Now that the Sterlings are in trouble, of course Father wants to help!"

She glared up the staircase. "But Grandfather refuses! Doesn't he understand? Helping the Sterlings helps us too!" Her voice turned shrill. "Nathan, you're engaged to Victoria! If we don't intervene, we'll be humiliated!"

Nathan's expression darkened as he ascended the stairs.

The study door stood ajar. Inside, chaos reigned.

Reginald, confined to his wheelchair, hurled a crystal ashtray against the wall. At eighty, his temper had only grown more volatile with age.

Penelope wept dramatically into Leonard's shoulder, clutching a silk handkerchief. Leonard shielded her from flying debris, his face thunderous.

"Father! Control yourself!"

"I'll control myself when you start using your brain!" Reginald roared, pounding his chest. "I warned you not to get involved with Sterling Corp! And what do you do? Buy their defective stock? Hand them our contracts?"

His wheelchair creaked as he leaned forward. "Has this woman addled your mind completely? Do I need to die before you'll listen?"

"How can you say that?" Leonard's face purpled with rage.

"Say what? The truth?" Reginald slammed his fist on the armrest. "Ever since you married her, you've lost all sense!"

"Father-in-law..." Penelope's voice quivered with practiced meekness. "I know you've never approved of me, but twenty years I've devoted to this family..."

Tears streamed down her cheeks. "I've been the perfect wife, the perfect mother. I've never stepped out of line, never brought shame to the Blackwood name..."

She pressed closer to Leonard. "Marrying Leonard was the greatest blessing of my life. I've never asked for anything more..."

Leonard gazed at her with adoration.

Reginald wasn't fooled. His hands shook with fury. "Spare me your theatrics!"

The old man's eyes locked onto Nathan's as he appeared in the doorway. A silent challenge passed between them. The real battle was just beginning.
###Chapter 43

Penelope's voice trembled. "But my sister's family is innocent. They run legitimate businesses. It's completely unjust that they're suffering like this."

She hesitated before adding, "Besides, Victoria is engaged to Nathan now."

"Legitimate businesses?" Reginald scoffed, his lips curling in disdain. "They're nothing but opportunistic vultures!"

Penelope's face paled.

"Do you take me for a fool?" Reginald snapped. "Even in retirement, I know exactly what's happening. The Sterlings brought this upon themselves with their shady dealings."

His glare sharpened. "And don't use Nathan as an excuse. If he marries that woman, I won't recognize him as my grandson! All of you can leave! When I die, I don’t want any of you at my funeral!"

Leonard sighed heavily. "Father..."

Penelope's shoulders shook with silent sobs, but her eyes burned with venom.

I've had enough of this wretched old man. Twenty years of bowing to him—I hope he rots in hell!

"Grandfather!"

Nathan strode into the room, reaching out to steady Reginald, but the old man shoved him away.

"Don't pretend to care! You're just like your father—brainwashed by that conniving family!"

"I won't interfere with the Sterlings," Nathan said, his voice eerily calm. "I've made my position clear."

Reginald's eyes flickered with surprise. "Really?"

"Yes. Sterling Corporation is at fault. I won’t intervene."

"And what about you and that woman?"

Nathan's expression remained indifferent. "That has nothing to do with Victoria. Our wedding will proceed as planned."

Reginald snorted. "Fine. At least you're not as foolish as your father." He waved a dismissive hand.

He couldn’t understand his grandson. Why would Nathan divorce Evelyn only to marry her?

"Aunt Penelope."

Nathan turned to her, his tone icy. "I understand you want to help the Sterlings—after all, Margaret is your sister. But if your actions harm Blackwood Industries, then you're betraying the very loyalty you claim to uphold."

Penelope's lips pressed into a thin line, her face flushing with humiliation.

This ruthless bastard! He's always been cold, even as a child!

"Victoria is my fiancée, but I don’t mix personal matters with business." Nathan’s gaze shifted to Leonard. "Father, as chairman, you should prioritize the company’s interests above all else."

Leonard’s expression darkened. He knew he was in the wrong.

"I wasn’t helping the Sterlings for Penelope’s sake," he admitted. "I just returned from a summit in Valmont. I was supposed to meet a key partner for the Westridge project, but he canceled last minute."

His jaw tightened. "Later, I learned Sebastian Kingsley intercepted him. I don’t know what deal he offered, but our partnership collapsed. Everything happening to us—it’s all connected to the Kingsleys. They’re targeting us deliberately, and I won’t let them trample over us!"

Reginald’s eyes darkened.

The Blackwoods of Crestview and the Kingsleys of Fairhaven had been bitter rivals for generations. Old Mrs. Kingsley had even sworn that none of her descendants would ever marry a Blackwood.

Now, Sebastian was striking back—first sabotaging their hotel venture, then this.

"Wait."

Nathan stiffened. "Father, did you say you saw Sebastian in Valmont?"

"Yes."

"Today?"

Leonard nodded.

Nathan’s mind raced.

Sebastian had been at the hospital to pick up Evelyn this afternoon. How could he be in Valmont at the same time?

Had the man he saw not been Sebastian?

If not… then who was he?
###Chapter 44

Nathan Blackwood finally swore before Reginald that he wouldn't interfere with the Sterling family's matters anymore, just to pacify the old man.

Nathan and Penelope left Crestview Manor with heavy hearts while Reginald stared at the wreckage in his study, fury burning in his gaze.

"Ugh! Those cunning women have you and your father completely under their spell!"

Dominic Kingsley knelt to collect the shattered porcelain fragments, his mind racing at lightning speed.

Had someone impersonated Sebastian in Valmont? But Leonard would recognize Sebastian immediately - they'd met numerous times before. Unless... was his father developing dementia?

His fingers brushed against an antique folding fan.

"Grandfather, does this belong to you?"

"Oh heavens! In my rage I nearly destroyed it. Bring it here at once."

Reginald's expression softened as he traced the delicate bamboo ribs. "Evelyn crafted this fan for me. The painting and calligraphy are all her original work."

Dominic had never known Evelyn possessed such artistic talents.

He stood frozen, utterly speechless.

During their marriage, he'd found Evelyn dull and overly compliant.

Compared to Victoria Sterling - who could master Chopin etudes, perform ballet, and sing opera - Evelyn had seemed like a simpleton. Sweet, gentle, and pretty perhaps, but otherwise indistinguishable from the household staff. That had been his unshakable opinion.

Yet after leaving him, she'd transformed into a dazzling gem - polished, multifaceted, radiating confidence. The revelation of her hidden talents struck him like a physical blow.

Had she deliberately hidden her brilliance because she believed Nathan unworthy? Reserved her true self only for Sebastian Kingsley?

What she'd shown Nathan wasn't love at all - just wifely duty, empty gestures to maintain peace.

Her heart had always belonged to Sebastian, hadn't it?

"Evelyn visited me every weekend without fail," Reginald continued wistfully. "Sometimes we'd stroll through the gardens, other times she'd sit with me in the study entire afternoons. Never once did that child show boredom. She'd simply read or practice calligraphy beside me. Her brushwork reveals at least a decade of disciplined training. The elegance in her strokes... the natural flow... it speaks of deep cultivation and noble upbringing."

Reginald sighed deeply. "She's infinitely superior to that pretentious Sterling girl. What a tragedy you were too blind to see it."

Nathan's lips pressed into a taut line as he unfolded the fan.

Two lines of exquisite calligraphy greeted him:

"Regret not the past, for time's river flows but one way."

Lightning seemed to course through Nathan's veins. His piercing gaze devoured the characters, bringing the fan closer for inspection.

This handwriting matched perfectly with the framed calligraphy in Evelyn Carter's office - the piece she'd offered to gift him.

Suddenly he remembered their encounter at Monarch Grand Hotel, where Evelyn served as managing director. The echo of her footsteps in the corridor after he'd left her office that day... Had Evelyn known "Evelyn" all along?

Could such coincidence exist?

Was it possible... that Evelyn Carter and Evelyn were the same person?

The notion seemed absurd.

His gentle, obedient ex-wife couldn't possibly be the shrewd, formidable Evelyn Carter... could she?

Meanwhile at Willow Creek Estate in Fairhaven, Sebastian Kingsley had just returned from his Valmont business trip. He and Dominic were dining with Harrison Kingsley.

Over roasted duck and vintage Bordeaux, Sebastian detailed his successful acquisition in Valmont. Harrison nodded approvingly, his aristocratic features betraying rare satisfaction.

My eldest son excels in every conceivable way, Harrison thought bitterly. Yet he insists on this ridiculous pastoral calling. No amount of power, prestige, or wealth can deter him from that clerical path. What madness drives him?

"Sebastian," Harrison remarked, swirling his wine, "it's unlike you to seize a project from Blackwood Industries so aggressively. Aren't you always preaching peace and reconciliation?"

"Peace remains fragile," Sebastian deflected smoothly, raising his water glass with elegant restraint.

Dominic suppressed a smirk. He knew perfectly well this was Sebastian's retaliation against Blackwood Industries on Evelyn's behalf.

"Business demands decisive action," Harrison declared, clapping Sebastian's shoulder with rare enthusiasm. "Within legal bounds, any tactic is fair game. You've done splendidly! Besides, Leonard Blackwood and I are sworn enemies. His grandfather humiliated my grandmother. Hmph! Revenge delayed is not revenge denied!"

Sebastian could only sigh in resignation.

Dominic chuckled inwardly. So we're not just inheriting a business empire, but generations-old vendettas against the Blackwoods too...
###Chapter 45

"How is Evelyn doing in Crestview these days?" Harrison Kingsley's voice carried a sharp edge as he swirled his wineglass. "She's dead set on taking down Sterling Corporation. But if she's not careful, she'll make enemies. With Donovan and Maxwell away, it's up to you two to watch over her. Understood?" His piercing gaze left no room for argument.

"Of course, Father."

Sebastian nodded, his expression unreadable.

Dominic smirked, cracking his knuckles. "Don't worry. Anyone who dares lay a finger on our little sister will regret being born."

Harrison's lips curled into a cold smile. "No need for bloodshed. Just ensure they suffer enough to wish they were dead." He took another measured sip of wine, the candlelight casting shadows across his sharp features.

After dinner, Harrison and Sebastian departed.

As they prepared to leave, Dominic noticed Sebastian’s phone buzzing on the table.

The caller ID flashed: Nathan Blackwood.

Dominic’s eyes darkened. He snatched up the phone, cleared his throat, and answered with deliberate calm.

"What do you want, Mr. Blackwood?"

"I need to speak with Evelyn Carter." Nathan’s arrogant tone made Dominic’s blood boil.

Dominic scoffed. "You’ve lost your damn mind. Why the hell would Evelyn take your call?"

A beat of silence. Then Nathan’s voice dropped dangerously low. "Sebastian?"

Dominic smirked, knowing Nathan had caught on—but he wasn’t about to admit it. "If you’re drunk and lonely, call your fiancée. I don’t have time for this."

"Sebastian," Nathan growled, "if you want revenge for Evelyn, face me directly. Don’t hide behind underhanded schemes."

Dominic barked a laugh. "Oh, the irony. Who started playing dirty first? Or have you forgotten how you and your precious Victoria ruined Evelyn?" His grip tightened on the phone. "If you want to beg for mercy, do it properly. But let me be clear—even if you grovel at my feet, I won’t stop until every last one of you pays for what you did."

He ended the call before Nathan could respond.

Across town, Nathan sat frozen in his study, knuckles white around his phone. The screen had gone dark, but the fury in his chest burned hotter than ever.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Oliver Sinclair rushed in, then hesitated at the sight of his boss’s thunderous expression.

"What?" Nathan snapped.

Oliver swallowed hard. "I—I followed your orders. Harrison Kingsley’s first wife had five children. Aside from Sebastian, the others’ records are heavily encrypted. We couldn’t break through."

Nathan’s eyes turned glacial. "Then try harder."

Oliver paled. "Should I… resign tomorrow?"

Nathan didn’t answer.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just finished a long, luxurious bath. Wrapped in a plush white robe, she padded downstairs, her damp hair curling at the ends.

"Theodore," she called, spotting her secretary by the wine cabinet. "What are you still doing in a full suit? It’s past nine."

Theodore Winslow turned, concern flashing across his handsome face. "Ms. Carter, you’re injured. You should rest. Just tell me what you need."

Evelyn waved him off. "I’m fine. And for heaven’s sake, loosen up. This isn’t the office. Change into something comfortable."

Theodore hesitated.

Evelyn sighed. "Seeing you like this makes me feel like I’m still at work. It’s exhausting."

There was another reason, too—one she’d never admit.

Theodore’s crisp suits reminded her of him.

Nathan Blackwood, her ex-husband, the man who’d barely spared her a glance in three years of marriage. Always immaculate, always distant. Even at home, he’d only ever traded his suit for dark silk pajamas.

Cold. Restrained. Infuriatingly perfect.

Only Evelyn knew the fire hidden beneath that icy exterior.

"Ms. Carter?" Theodore’s voice snapped her back to reality.

She blinked. "Hmm?"

"You’re… blushing."

Evelyn touched her cheeks, startled by the heat.

Damn it.

Not again.
###Chapter 46

Evelyn raised her right hand to her cheek, feeling the warmth radiating from her skin.

She turned away abruptly, hiding her flushed face.

"It must be the wine," she muttered.

Theodore arched an eyebrow. "We haven't even reached the wine cellar yet, Ms. Carter. Your face was already red before we left."

He was brilliant in business matters but painfully oblivious to romantic tension. He completely missed Evelyn's earlier suggestive thoughts.

"Oh, shut it!" Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically before striding ahead.

Theodore looked genuinely confused, like a puppy who'd been scolded without understanding why. He hurried after her with quick steps.

The wine cellar housed nearly a thousand bottles of premium reds, all carefully selected by Sebastian Kingsley for his sister. He knew Evelyn enjoyed unwinding with fine wine after long days.

Each bottle represented a small fortune, many acquired at exclusive auctions. Even Harrison Kingsley didn't possess some of these rare vintages, yet Evelyn had dozens. Selling just a few could buy her an estate in Crestview.

Evelyn's gaze landed on a prized bottle of Romanée-Conti. She stretched on her toes, fingers brushing but not quite reaching the coveted bottle.

Theodore appeared behind her, his tall frame easily retrieving the wine. Their proximity made his pulse quicken - he could smell her delicate perfume, feel the warmth of her body. A faint pink tinged his fair complexion.

"Here you are, Ms. Carter."

"Having a 6'1" secretary certainly has its advantages," Evelyn teased. "No need for step stools!"

Though privately, she thought the ideal male height was 6'2" - Nathan Blackwood's exact stature. Theodore fell just four centimeters short.

Damn it! Why am I thinking about that bastard again? Worse than cheap wine.

"Allow me to open that for you, Ms. Carter. It would be difficult with your cast."

CRACK.

Without hesitation, Evelyn smashed her cast against the table edge, revealing her perfectly healed arm.

"Finally! I've been wanting to get rid of this nuisance for ages."

Theodore gaped in shock.

"On the battlefield, broken bones were child's play," Evelyn said casually. "I once saw a soldier lose his leg to a landmine. That same morning he'd been joking with me - by afternoon they brought him back with a dozen bullet wounds and half his face gone."

She described war's brutality with unsettling calm.

Theodore struggled to reconcile this hardened veteran with the elegant socialite before him. How had this pampered heiress endured years of such horrors?

As Theodore decanted the wine, the Kingsley Intelligence Network group chat exploded with messages.

[Maxwell: Dominic, I get that Sebastian's busy running Monarch Group. But you're just a civil servant in the judicial department. How are you this incompetent?]

[Maxwell: Do you realize Nathan Blackwood had his people trying to decrypt our files?]

[Maxwell: Luckily I implemented our strongest encryption protocol in time. That bastard won't outsmart me!]

Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm.

[Dominic: What the hell? Does he suspect something?!]
[Dominic: Wait - since when do you speak to your elder brother like this?]

[Maxwell: You only beat me into this world by four minutes.]

[Maxwell: If I'd come out first, you'd be calling me 'big brother' right now!]

[Dominic: Even one second makes me older. Show some respect!]

[Maxwell: Make me!]

[Dominic: You stubborn little shit! I'll thrash you!]

[Maxwell: Try it, old man! I'll still wipe the floor with you even if I let you throw the first punch.]
###Chapter 47

[Evelyn: That's quite enough! Both of you are acting like spoiled children.]

The moment Evelyn's message flashed across their private chat, Sebastian and Dominic immediately straightened up like disciplined soldiers.

[Evelyn: Nathan is digging into us because he suspects Dominic's identity. After Dominic defended me twice, Nathan must have realized Sebastian would never behave that way.]

Evelyn's sapphire eyes darkened as she swirled the crimson liquid in her crystal glass.

[Evelyn: If that's the case, there's no point hiding anymore. I'll give him the answers he seeks.]

The weekend arrived with startling swiftness.

Bowing to public pressure, Sterling Enterprises scheduled a press conference at the Grandview Galleria Hotel, inviting every major media outlet in Crestview.

Sterling Enterprises had always been a minor player in the industry, barely registering on the corporate radar.

Yet overnight, the Sterling family became the center of attention when Victoria announced her engagement to Nathan Blackwood.

Across from the hotel entrance, a sleek black Maybach idled at the curb.

Nathan watched the live broadcast through his tablet, his expression unreadable.

"Mr. Blackwood," Oliver murmured from the driver's seat, "the chairman has been dropping hints all week about assisting the Sterlings."

His brow furrowed with concern. "If you continue opposing him, won't it damage your relationship? Madam Whitmore will surely use this against you."

Nathan's voice remained ice-cold. "Let her try. I won't lift a finger for the Sterlings."

He turned his gaze back to the screen. "My father and I were never close to begin with. This changes nothing."

Oliver exhaled quietly in relief.

Nathan had always maintained his distance from the Blackwood family affairs, keeping his emotions locked away.

The press conference began promptly.

Damian Sterling strutted onto the stage in an ill-fitting black suit, his chin tilted arrogantly. His entire demeanor radiated resentment at being forced into this public spectacle.

"As everyone knows," he declared, "Sterling Enterprises operates thirty-two Luxe Furnishings showrooms in Crestview alone, with over four hundred nationwide. Our reputation in this industry is impeccable. These baseless accusations are nothing but malicious slander!"

Oliver snorted at the screen. "The audacity! Standing there lying through his teeth when everyone knows about their shoddy craftsmanship. The man has no shame."

Nathan remained silent, his brows drawing together like storm clouds.

"But Monarch Grand Hotels were the first to expose Luxe Furnishings' quality issues," a sharp-eyed reporter countered. "They've maintained an impeccable reputation for decades. Are you suggesting they'd risk that to smear your company?"

Damian's face darkened instantly. "Luxe Furnishings has operated flawlessly for twelve years! This isolated incident breaks my heart."

"Then you admit there are quality issues?" the reporter pressed. "Because if I recall correctly, there was a serious complaint filed early last year. I believe many colleagues here remember that incident."

Murmurs of recognition spread through the press corps.

Damian's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists.

Deep in the hotel's underground garage, Evelyn lounged in her sports car, watching the live feed with satisfaction curling her crimson lips.

No one would suspect she'd planted that particular reporter with carefully crafted questions.

In the two years since Damian took Sterling Enterprises' helm, he'd squandered the family fortune through reckless decisions and shoddy business practices. Their financial reserves were nearly depleted.

Theodore let out a derisive chuckle. "The man's got nerve, lying so blatantly at a press conference. Does he really think no one has proof?"

"Oh, he's got a trump card," Evelyn purred, plucking a chocolate from Theodore's pocket. She unwrapped it with deliberate slowness before taking a delicate bite. "That's why he's so bold."

Her eyes gleamed with predatory anticipation. "Just wait. Push him hard enough, and he'll play that card. Then our moment will come."
###Chapter 48

Evelyn finished the last bite of chocolate, her lips curling into a satisfied smile. With playful mischief, she tucked the remaining half of the chocolate bar into Theodore's suit pocket and gave his chest an appreciative pat.

"Not bad," she teased, fingers lingering just a second too long. "You've been working out."

Theodore's breath hitched. Heat flooded his cheeks at her boldness, leaving his mouth suddenly dry.

At twenty-six, Theodore was four years older than Evelyn. His father, Gregory Pembroke, had served as head of Monarch Group's legal department for decades, earning Harrison Kingsley's utmost trust. This connection meant Theodore had spent much of his youth visiting Willow Creek Estate.

The memory of their first meeting remained vivid in Theodore's mind. He'd been wandering the estate's gardens when a vision in white came skating toward him - a radiant girl in an angel costume, her laughter ringing like silver bells across the manicured lawns.

For a disorienting moment, he thought he'd stumbled into some celestial dream. Then the angel planted one foot on her skateboard, flipping it up into her hands with effortless grace.

"Got any candy?" she'd demanded, tilting her head.

Theodore had frozen, mentally chastising himself for the inappropriate thoughts about what was clearly a child. Yet he couldn't deny her ethereal beauty - the kind that made poets weep and artists abandon their brushes.

"Never mind," young Evelyn had sighed dramatically when he didn't immediately respond. She'd been about to skate away when Theodore caught her slender wrist - so delicate his fingers nearly encircled it completely.

"Wait."

Digging in his pocket, he produced a chocolate bar. "Will this do?"

Her entire face had lit up. "Perfect!" She'd unwrapped it with reverence, taking a blissful bite that made her eyes crinkle at the corners.

From that day forward, Theodore never visited Willow Creek without pockets full of sweets. Even now, years later, he remained Evelyn's personal confectionery supplier whenever her sweet tooth demanded satisfaction.

The press conference was reaching its boiling point.

Damian Sterling's face flushed crimson as he slammed his fist on the podium. "For the last time! Luxe Furnishings products meet the highest quality standards! I'd stake my life on it!"

"Then why did Monarch Grand Hotels nationwide cancel all orders with your company overnight?" The reporter's sharp question cut through the murmuring crowd. "The public deserves an explanation, Mr. Sterling."

Live stream comments scrolled rapidly:

[Staking his life? Must be telling the truth then.]

[Maybe his life isn't worth much anyway.]

[That smug face makes me want to return everything I've ever bought from them.]

"You want an explanation?" Damian's smile turned venomous. "Very well. This incident has revealed management oversights - with hundreds of stores nationwide, some employees exploited loopholes for personal gain. Those responsible have been dealt with severely."

He paused dramatically. "But it takes two to dance this tango. If not for Monarch Group executives bribing my staff, would we be here today? They're scapegoating my company to cover their own corruption!"

Gasps rippled through the room.

Oliver Sinclair exchanged an incredulous look with Nathan Blackwood. The audacity of this lie was staggering.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his pen, his glacial stare fixed on Damian.

"Exhibit A!" Damian commanded.

Projected onto the screen appeared damning evidence - chat logs between Vincent Prescott, VP of Monarch Grand Hotels, and a Luxe Furnishings manager. Bank statements and clandestine meeting photos completed the picture.

"These prove Vincent Prescott conspired with my employee to purchase substandard products at kickback prices. Monarch Group orchestrated this entire scandal to destroy a smaller competitor! We will pursue legal action against this corporate bullying!"

Damian's triumphant smirk said everything - he'd planned this sacrificial pawn from the beginning, carefully cultivating evidence for this exact moment.

Oliver's stomach dropped. Public sentiment was already shifting, social media erupting with accusations of Monarch Group's market domination tactics.

Nathan's expression darkened to thunderous.

Just as Damian opened his mouth to deliver his killing blow, the speakers in the banquet hall erupted with an earsplitting screech.
###Chapter 49

The banquet hall erupted in chaos as two male voices blared through the speakers.

"Mr. Sterling, if I wasn't lining your pockets, why would I replace premium mattresses with cheap knockoffs?" The voice dripped with venom. "That new manager brat discovered everything and fired me. Now I'm blacklisted across Crestview! You owe me!"

"Don't pretend this was all for my benefit." The second voice, unmistakably Damian Sterling's, held icy contempt. "Your kickbacks could last three lifetimes. Stop whining."

Every reporter's pen froze mid-sentence. The air crackled with scandal. Damian's knuckles whitened against the table edge, sweat beading on his forehead like morning dew.

"Who authorized this?!" His roar cut through the murmurs. "Kill the feed now!"

The audio cut abruptly, only for damning photographs to flood the projector screen. Images of Damian and Vincent Prescott entering luxury nightclubs, exchanging thick envelopes.

"You promised protection!" Vincent's recorded voice cracked with panic.

"I am protecting you," Damian's voice purred. "Deny everything and you'll walk away. But if you talk..." The unspoken threat hung heavier than the chandeliers.

Flashbulbs exploded like fireworks as journalists scrambled. Damian's face turned puce. "Fabrications! Deepfakes! This is character assassination!"

Then - BANG!

The double doors burst open. Two dozen suited officers with gold insignias formed a human corridor. The click of Italian leather heels silenced the room.

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched as Dominic Kingsley strode forward, his prosecutor's badge gleaming like a blade. Every camera lens swiveled toward the arresting officer's sculpted jawline.

"Damian Sterling, CEO of Sterling Holdings." Dominic's baritone carried judicial finality. "You're under arrest for bribery and corporate fraud. Monarch Group has provided irrefutable evidence." He snapped his fingers. "Cuff him."

"Lies!" Damian thrashed against the officers. "I'll ruin whoever orchestrated this!"

The live broadcast captured every humiliating second - the twisted tie, the spittle flying from Damian's lips as they dragged him past flashing cameras.

[BREAKING: Sterling Empire Crumbles During Own Press Conference!]
[Monarch Group Vindicated - The Real Victims All Along!]
[That Prosecutor Though...Hubba Hubba!]

Oliver Sinclair clapped like a seal. "Game over for the Sterlings!"

"Calculated annihilation." Nathan's lips barely moved. His gaze tracked Dominic with laser intensity.

"Wait...you think Monarch staged this whole-"

"Obviously." Nathan's phone was already scanning Dominic's face through facial recognition. "Provoke Damian into throwing Vincent under the bus. Then drop the hammer with irrefutable proof."

The results flashed: DOMINIC KINGSLEY. CHIEF PROSECUTOR, CRESTVIEW DA'S OFFICE.

Nathan's thumb hovered over the screen. This was the man from the hospital. The one who'd stood guard over Evelyn. The spitting image of Sebastian Kingsley.

His stomach twisted. Just how deep did the Kingsley rabbit hole go?
###Chapter 50

Dominic's photo was discovered on the Supreme Court's official website three years prior.

In the image, he stood tall in his ceremonial robes, delivering a passionate argument in court. His piercing gaze and commanding presence made him impossible to ignore.

Nathan had developed a sophisticated facial recognition software that could retrieve someone's full profile within minutes—far more efficient than conventional search engines.

Yet, when he uploaded Dominic's picture, the search took an unusually long ten minutes.

This suggested one thing: Dominic Kingsley rarely appeared in public and kept his personal life strictly off social media.

If he was just a prosecutor, why the secrecy?

Sebastian Kingsley. Dominic Kingsley.

Nathan's mind raced. Then, realization struck like lightning. His breath hitched.

Could it be...?

No.

His jaw clenched, knuckles whitening as his grip tightened. A storm brewed behind his darkening expression.

Evelyn Carter. How could you?

First, you run straight to Sebastian after our divorce. Now, you're entangled with his brother? Who do you think you are?

The roar of an engine shattered his thoughts.

He turned sharply toward the window.

A sleek black sports car blurred past him.

Evelyn's car.

Why was she here?

Something wasn't right.

His pulse spiked. He slammed a fist against the window.

"Oliver! Follow that car!"

Meanwhile, reporters swarmed the hotel entrance as investigators struggled to escort the disgraced Damian Sterling into a waiting vehicle.

The press conference had ended in chaos.

Dominic didn't follow the investigators. Instead, he slipped out the back, waiting for his sister.

Minutes later, a Bugatti La Voiture Noire pulled up.

Theodore lowered the window with a polite smile. "Mr. Dominic."

"Hey, Theo!"

Dominic leaned in, his gaze softening as he took in Evelyn in the passenger seat. He reached out, pinching her cheek affectionately.

"Theo's been feeding you well, huh? You're getting chubby."

Evelyn swatted his hand away, pouting. "I am not!"

"You are. And it's adorable." He grinned.

Dominic had zero tact. No wonder he was still single at thirty.

From the shadows, Nathan watched, misinterpreting their playful banter as something far more intimate.

His expression darkened. His fists trembled.

Oliver glanced nervously at the rearview mirror, swallowing hard.

Of course the young madam has admirers. She's brilliant and stunning. Only my boss was blind enough to let her go.

"So?" Dominic preened. "How cool was I today?"

"Very," Evelyn teased, resting her arms on the window. "You're trending online. Half the women in the country are searching for you."

Her eyes sparkled with admiration, her smile radiant.

Nathan's chest tightened.

He wanted to be the one she looked at like that.

He had never seen her smile at him that way.

Dominic scoffed. "I don't care about them. I just want my little sister's approval."

Evelyn laughed. "Ugh, stop. You're better at playing the cool brother, not the sappy one."

Their laughter faded as the conversation turned serious.

"Dominic, I'll need your help with the next steps."

Evelyn's expression hardened. "Make sure Damian doesn't get off easy."

"Don't worry. He's looking at three years minimum. No bail. No reduced sentence."

Dominic gave her an approving nod. "You did well, Evie. You predicted his every move. If all criminals were this predictable, my job would be easier."

Damian had walked right into her trap.

The reason Monarch Group's lawsuit succeeded was because Vincent Prescott had finally come forward as a witness, exposing Damian's embezzlement scheme.

Nathan's lips curled into a bitter sneer.

Evelyn Carter, you're playing a dangerous game.
###Chapter 51

The night before, Evelyn had secretly arranged to meet Vincent Prescott at a dimly lit whiskey bar downtown. He was already three drinks deep when she slid into the booth across from him.

"I have information you need to hear," she said, swirling the ice in her untouched bourbon. "Damian plans to sacrifice you at tomorrow's press conference to save himself."

Vincent's glass slammed onto the table. "Bullshit! I'm not some pawn in your little game. I won't testify!"

Evelyn's crimson nails tapped against crystal. "Your stubbornness will be your downfall."

After hours of tense negotiation, they reached an agreement.

"Let me be clear," Evelyn leaned forward, her emerald eyes sharp. "I have proof of your collusion with Damian. The only reason it hasn't reached the prosecutors yet is out of respect for my father - the man who promoted you from banquet supervisor to VP."

Vincent's hands trembled as he remembered his twenty-year climb up Monarch Group's corporate ladder. Without Harrison Kingsley's mentorship, he'd still be arranging centerpieces.

Now, drowning in regret, he stared at the damning files Evelyn produced.

"Here's the deal," she continued. "If Damian doesn't throw you under the bus tomorrow as I predict, I'll personally deliver this evidence. But if he does... you'll testify against him. Cooperate, and I'll ensure you get Monarch's top legal team."

The trap was set.

As Evelyn left the bar, she recalled her father's wisdom: "Always leave your enemies an escape route." Even with victory in sight, she wouldn't deliver the final blow herself.

Meanwhile, Dominic Kingsley returned to the District Attorney's office to prepare the case, while Evelyn headed back to her hotel.

In the car, Theodore suddenly gripped the wheel tighter. "Ms. Carter, we've got company - a Maybach tailing us since we left the courthouse. Should I call security?"

Evelyn glanced at the rearview mirror, her pulse quickening when she recognized Nathan Blackwood's distinctive car. So he'd been watching the press conference from the shadows. How very... protective of his precious fiancée's family.

"Change of plans," she smirked. "Take me to Starlight River."

"But the tail—"

"Relax, Teddy. I'll keep you safe." Her wink made the bodyguard blush.

As the Bugatti cruised along the riverbank, Oliver Sinclair white-knuckled the Maybach's steering wheel, more nervous than during his Harvard finals or Nathan's brutal CEO interviews.

Nathan's icy gaze never left Evelyn's silhouette. Who was this man driving her? An amateur - any competent driver would've lost them by now.

Through the window, he watched strands of Evelyn's raven hair dance in the wind. Something primal stirred in his chest.

The cars eventually stopped at a scenic overlook.

Evelyn stepped out alone, leaning against the railing as the sunset painted the river gold. When Nathan emerged from his car, adjusting his suit with that effortless aristocratic grace, the fading light sculpted his broad shoulders like a Renaissance masterpiece.

He approached silently until Evelyn spoke without turning. "Following me all the way from the courthouse, Mr. Blackwood? Should I expect another broken arm?"

"Nathan," he corrected coldly, though his eyes betrayed concern as they flickered to her left arm.

"Did you bring the divorce papers this time?" She finally faced him, scarlet lips curling. "It's getting late, but I'm sure Sebastian could pull strings at City Hall for us."

"You must be enjoying this," Nathan growled, closing the distance between them.

"Enjoying what?"

"Using the Kingsley brothers to destroy the Sterlings. I never imagined you could be this ruthless."

The river breeze carried Evelyn's mocking laughter. "Oh darling, you haven't seen ruthless yet."
###Chapter 52

Evelyn's hands trembled, her chest tightening with suppressed fury.

She locked eyes with Nathan, her gaze burning with an intensity that made him flinch. The fire in her clear, striking eyes was so fierce that he had to look away.

He had never seen this side of her before—this unyielding, defiant woman.

After a long silence, Evelyn scoffed. She regarded him as if he were a stranger.

"Oh, so you're here to defend your precious fiancée's honor?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Tell me, how long have you been holding this in? Were you afraid you'd explode if you didn't confront me today?"

Her thoughts raged. Nathan, you're unbelievable. Three years of marriage, and I never asked for anything. Even if you never appreciated me, you had no right to humiliate me like this. And now? I don’t belong to you. I never really did. I was just a stray waiting at your door, hoping you'd let me in. But you never did. So why should I let you trample over me now?

She tilted her chin up, her smile sharp. "Too bad even someone as powerful as you can't save the Sterling family from their downfall. Damian Sterling sabotaged Monarch Group, bribed employees, falsified evidence—it's all undeniable. No amount of influence can change that."

Nathan's jaw clenched. The veins on his hands stood out as his fists tightened.

Look at her, he thought bitterly. Now that she has the Kingsleys backing her, she’s fearless.

But he couldn’t voice the real reason for his anger.

It wasn’t about the Sterlings.

It was the way she had smiled at Dominic.

"You're shameless," he spat, his breathing ragged.

Evelyn laughed, the sound cold and mocking. "Shameless? At least you didn’t call me a discarded wife this time." She forced a smirk, though it stung. "But even if I am, what does it matter to you? Who are you to judge me? I’ll do as I please. You lost the right to dictate my life the moment you walked away."

She turned to leave, but Nathan seized her arm—the left one, still healing from her injury. His grip was punishing.

"Let go!" she hissed, pain shooting through her. She didn’t dare struggle, fearing another dislocation.

"Evelyn," Nathan growled, his voice rough. "You know exactly who I am."

His gaze was a challenge, daring her to acknowledge the past between them.

She met his eyes, unflinching. "Oh, I know. You're just my worthless ex-husband."

Nathan's eyes darkened, fury flashing in their depths.

"Evelyn Carter!"

Before he could react, a tall figure stepped between them, shoving Nathan back forcefully.

"Theodore, I'm fine," Evelyn said quickly, though her voice wavered. "Mr. Blackwood was just... talking."

"If it was just talking, why was he grabbing your injured arm?" Theodore snapped, glaring at Nathan. "You were complaining about the pain just last night. He knew exactly what he was doing."

Nathan stiffened, his fingers curling at his sides.

Evelyn shot Theodore a warning look. She didn’t want Nathan thinking she was playing the victim.

Nathan’s expression darkened further as recognition flickered in his eyes. "You’re Sebastian Kingsley’s assistant?"

Theodore didn’t back down. "And you’re the man who hurt her."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. This wasn’t a battle she wanted to fight—not here, not now.

But Nathan wasn’t done.

His voice was dangerously low. "Stay out of this."

Theodore squared his shoulders. "Not when it comes to her."

Evelyn placed a hand on Theodore’s arm, silently urging him to stand down.

Nathan’s gaze flickered between them, something unreadable flashing in his eyes before he turned and walked away.

But the storm between them was far from over.
###Chapter 53

Theodore responded, "Yes, but now I'm Ms. Carter's—"

Evelyn tugged sharply on Theodore's sleeve, shooting him a warning glance that silenced him immediately.

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "How amusing. Sebastian actually assigned his most trusted executive assistant to you. The Kingsleys must be treating their long-lost princess exceptionally well."

His expression darkened as he forcibly suppressed the turmoil within. "Congratulations on securing another wealthy husband. First you deceived me, now you're fooling Sebastian Kingsley. I hope he never discovers your true nature."

Each syllable struck Evelyn like a dagger twisting in her chest.

Theodore felt her tremble against him, her slender frame shaking with barely contained emotion.

His confusion deepened at Nathan's accusations. What the hell is this bastard talking about? Has he lost his mind?

"Teddy," Evelyn inhaled sharply, composing herself with visible effort. "Allow me to introduce Mr. Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries. My ex-husband. We were married for three years."

Theodore's face drained of color as if struck by lightning.

Three years. Evelyn had vanished for three years to become Nathan Blackwood's wife.

She'd abandoned her family, her identity—all for this man?

Why would she ever—?

"But we're divorced now," Evelyn continued icily. "I left without taking a single cent. We're complete strangers."

"We're not legally divorced yet!" Nathan snapped. "Grandfather's birthday—"

"Enough!" Evelyn's voice cracked like a whip. Her crimson-rimmed eyes blazed with fury. "Stop using your grandfather as an excuse to prolong this farce! You just want to keep me trapped so you can continue humiliating me, isn't that right? Because you know how much I respect Reginald!"

Nathan flinched as if physically struck.

This fiery anger was foreign on Evelyn. In his memory, she'd been docile—a silent punching bag who absorbed every cruelty without complaint.

But now her gaze burned with pure hatred.

Far more intense than when she'd confronted him at the hospital.

"There's nothing left between us!" Evelyn's voice shook with rage. "You destroyed our marriage the moment you slept with Victoria while we were still wed. Did I ever demand compensation? Did I ever seek revenge? Yet you dare judge me? Expect me to remain chaste while you paraded your mistress? How dare you be this selfish!"

Selfish?

The word pierced Nathan's chest like a bullet.

He didn't recognize his own increasingly erratic behavior. Couldn't comprehend why he couldn't let go of this woman who'd walked away.

"Unlike you, I keep my promises," Evelyn spat. "I would have honored our agreement to keep the divorce secret until Reginald's birthday. But you couldn't even control Victoria from exposing everything!"

Her bitter laugh extinguished the last light in her eyes. "Now I understand. You're blaming me because you can't bear to blame your precious Victoria, can you?"

Nathan froze, his body turning to stone.

He watched helplessly as Theodore protectively embraced his ex-wife. His face burned as if slapped repeatedly.

"I will never look back."

Nathan's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.

He'd been the one to discard her first—so why did he feel like the abandoned one?

Bitter acid rose in his throat. His heart bled from invisible wounds.
###Chapter 54

Evelyn wasn't in the mood to return to the hotel. With a heavy sigh, she turned the car around and headed home instead.

Theodore remained silent for a long while before finally speaking. "Ms. Carter," he began cautiously, "does Nathan not know... that you're the heiress of Monarch Group?"

Evelyn exhaled softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "No, he doesn't." She leaned back against the seat, exhaustion evident in her posture.

Theodore finally understood. That explained why Evelyn had arranged for a stand-in when Nathan unexpectedly showed up at her office that day.

"Teddy, I didn’t mean to keep it from you—"

"I understand."

Evelyn looked up, startled by his response.

"Painful memories aren’t something anyone wants to revisit," Theodore said gently. "It’s only natural to bury them deep. I’m just worried about how your father will react when he finds out. It’ll break his heart." His grip on the steering wheel tightened, knuckles turning white, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.

The Kingsley family adored Evelyn. And Nathan had destroyed her.

If Harrison ever discovered the truth, he’d likely tear Nathan apart.

"I’ll keep it hidden as long as I can," Evelyn murmured. "After this failed marriage, I think I’m done with love forever."

She closed her eyes, Nathan’s cruel words replaying in her mind. A bitter smile touched her lips. "Marriage is such a farce."

"If you don’t marry, then neither will I," Theodore vowed.

Evelyn’s eyes flew open. "No! Absolutely not! You’re my secretary, not a monk! If word gets out, people will think I only hire celibates. You’ll ruin my reputation!" She waved her hands frantically, horrified by the idea.

Theodore chuckled awkwardly, though his heart ached.

He knew he wasn’t worthy of her, but he’d stay by her side—always.

"Ms. Carter," he ventured carefully, "why did you marry Nathan in the first place?"

Evelyn’s gaze grew distant, a storm of emotions swirling in her eyes.

"I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked—"

"When I was eleven," she began softly, "my class went on a hiking trip. That’s when I lost the sapphire pendant my mother left me. I didn’t care about the teacher’s warnings—I went back alone to search for it in the dark. I retraced every step, but I couldn’t find it. Then I got lost."

Her voice grew quieter. "That night, a hurricane hit. I was trapped in the mountains with no phone signal. I was sure I was going to die there."

She swallowed hard. "Nathan happened to be working as a ranger in Mount Evercrest National Park that summer. Despite the storm, he led a search team to find me. He found me behind a boulder, nearly frozen to death."

Evelyn’s voice was barely a whisper now, lost in the memory.

"I opened my eyes and saw him in his climbing gear, soaked to the bone. Even drenched, he was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. His eyes—they were brighter than the stars."

She smiled faintly. "He carried me down the mountain, telling me terrible jokes the whole way to keep me awake. He was awful at it."

Theodore listened, stunned.

"What’s your name, little girl?"

"If you don’t tell me, I’ll just keep calling you ‘little girl.’"

"I’m not little! I’m growing faster than the other girls!"

"Well, you shouldn’t go telling boys that."

"Why not?"

"Because some of them might take advantage of you, silly."

Evelyn’s breath hitched, her heart pounding as if she were eleven again.

Nathan had been seventeen then—not as tall or as strong as he was now—but she’d felt safe in his arms.

Later, they nearly fell off a cliff. But Nathan held her tight and saved her life.

Then he vanished for three years. The next time she saw him, he was on TV, attending a charity gala with the Blackwoods.

From that moment, Evelyn chased him everywhere.

When she heard he was going to war, she joined Doctors Without Borders just to be near him.

She had loved him against all odds.

Now, that love was gone.

Evelyn smiled bitterly. Thirteen years of devotion, ending like this.

Theodore was silent, regret twisting inside him.

"But Teddy," she murmured, "I can’t bring myself to hate him."

She stretched her hand out the window, feeling the wind slip through her fingers—just like the love she could never hold onto.

"I loved Nathan willingly. I don’t regret it. I’ve repaid my debt to him."

Meanwhile, Nathan stood in the grand halls of Cliffside Manor, his mind a chaotic storm.

He felt like a boulder was crushing his chest.

Suffocating.
###Chapter 55

Nathan couldn't shake the image of Evelyn's gaze from his mind. The disappointment in her eyes had been sharp, cutting deeper than any words could.

There had been resentment there too—as if they were no longer just exes, but adversaries.

Why did that thought hollow him out?

It felt like something vital had slipped through his fingers, something he hadn’t realized he still held onto.

The moment he stepped into his study, Agnes followed, her expression tight with disapproval.

"Young Master, Ms. Sterling's car is waiting downstairs. You should greet her."

"I'm not going."

Agnes nearly gasped. Nathan had never ignored Victoria before.

A flicker of satisfaction curled in her chest—so strong she could have wept with joy.

"I know why she's here."

Nathan sank onto the sofa, his gaze distant. "Tell her if she’s here for Damian, she’s wasting her time. The Sterlings must be in chaos right now—she should be with her family. Once the media frenzy dies down in a couple of days, I’ll visit her."

"And if she refuses to leave?"

"Then let her stay." He exhaled heavily, kneading his temples.

All he could think of was Evelyn’s voice calling him a "useless ex-husband."

Useless? He nearly scoffed. She has no idea what I’m capable of.

Agnes barely hid her grin as she gave him a discreet thumbs-up before hurrying out.

Nathan frowned. It seemed Agnes despised Victoria more than he’d realized. The woman looked like she’d just won the lottery at the thought of turning Victoria away.

Agnes stepped outside Cliffside Manor, standing tall on the stone steps as she faced the frantic Victoria.

"The young master won’t interfere in your family affairs. Go home."

"Let me see him!"

Victoria tried to push past her, but Agnes barely had to brace herself. Without lifting a finger, Victoria stumbled back, landing hard on the ground.

"How dare you!" She pointed a shaking finger, her voice shrill. "I’m Nathan’s fiancée—your future mistress! You’ll regret this!"

Agnes laughed. "Future mistress? Keep dreaming. Even if you marry him, you’ll never be my lady. The only one I’ll ever acknowledge is Ms. Carter. Women like you? Step aside."

Victoria’s face twisted with fury.

"Go ahead. Complain to the young master. If you can actually get him to fire me, I’ll thank you. Retirement sounds lovely—no more dealing with schemers."

She wished Nathan would come down and see Victoria like this—no longer the delicate, fragile flower she pretended to be.

"Nathan! You have to help Damian!" Abandoning Agnes, Victoria dropped to her knees, sobbing.

The scene was straight out of a melodrama—the fallen mistress begging for mercy.

When Nathan didn’t respond, she turned desperate. "Aunt Penelope! Uncle Leonard! Please!"

"Stop shouting," Agnes snapped. "The chairman and Madam Penelope are dining with the Old Master. They won’t be back for hours."

"Then I’ll wait here until Nathan sees me!"

Agnes glanced at the storm clouds gathering overhead. "It’s about to rain. I have laundry to collect. Scream all you want."

With that, she left Victoria outside, instructing the staff to keep the doors locked no matter what.

Victoria screamed until her voice cracked, but Nathan never appeared.

Her hands trembled. Something had changed—Nathan was slipping from her grasp.

Before, he would drop everything the moment she called. He’d shower her with gifts, soothe her tears. Now? He wouldn’t even look at her.

Soon, the skies opened.

Victoria played her final card. Instead of seeking shelter, she knelt in the downpour, shivering violently, her dress soaked through.

"Nathan… please…"

"Pathetic," Agnes muttered, watching from the window. "Only an idiot would fall for this act."

Then—heavy footsteps behind her.

She turned.

Nathan was striding toward the entrance, his expression dark.
###Chapter 56

Agnes gasped when she spotted Nathan approaching. Her mind raced. Could the young master really be blind to this scheming woman's manipulations? If so, he was being utterly foolish.

Nathan grabbed a black umbrella and stormed out the front door. His expression mirrored the storm clouds gathering overhead.

"Young Master!" Agnes called after him desperately.

But he marched into the rain without hesitation. Agnes clenched her fists in frustration.

Outside Cliffside Manor, Victoria sat drenched on the pavement. This pathetic charade was testing her limits, and she nearly abandoned it.

Then she saw him.

That striking silhouette striding toward her through the downpour. Her pulse quickened. Immediately, she unleashed a torrent of theatrical sobs.

Nathan's eyes narrowed as he approached. With one swift motion, he hoisted the umbrella over her head while pulling her upright. His grip was unyielding.

"Nathan..." Victoria whimpered, collapsing against his chest.

Moments ago she'd appeared near death, but now she clung to him with viper-like intensity. Her damp face nuzzled against his shirt as her arms coiled around his waist.

"You're already frail," Nathan growled. "Do you want to catch pneumonia?"

Her tear-streaked face tilted upward. "Would you see me otherwise? I just needed to look at you. Why are you pushing me away?" Her voice cracked. "Don't you love me anymore? You've been so distant lately... Is this about that dress incident? I'll apologize to Evelyn! I'll beg her forgiveness!"

"That's not it." Nathan's tone remained icy. "You've seen me now. Go home, Victoria. When the storm passes, I'll visit."

"Nathan, please!" Panic flashed across her features as she tightened her grip. "My brother's being sentenced! No lawyer in Crestview will touch his case because of the Kingsleys! They're crushing our family! We're nearly bankrupt and Damian's going to prison!" Her manicured nails dug into his arms. "I'm begging you!"

Nathan's expression didn't waver. He'd built his empire on ruthless principles, yet remained inexplicably devoted to Victoria. A teenage vow had shackled him for fifteen years, making him betray his wife and defy his grandfather without hesitation.

But business was sacred. The Sterlings' crimes repulsed him, and he'd made that clear.

Memories surfaced of how he'd weaponized their downfall against Evelyn during their divorce. Regret twisted in his gut, hardening his resolve.

"The Kingsleys aren't at fault here. Your brother made his choices. He should confess and seek leniency." Nathan's voice turned glacial. "Sterling Corporation needs complete restructuring. Another billion won't save it without systemic changes."

Victoria's mouth fell open in shock.

She'd expected tears would melt his resistance like always.

This time, she'd miscalculated. Nathan's previous leniency existed because she'd never crossed this line.

Now, even love wouldn't make him compromise.

Eventually, Nathan bundled the sobbing woman into his car, ordered the doors locked, and watched her disappear down the drive. Only then did his shoulders relax.

He stood motionless in the rain, umbrella forgotten. The memory of Evelyn's devastated gaze haunted him, sending sharp pangs through his chest.

The Sterlings' mansion felt hollow after Damian's arrest.

When Victoria stumbled inside, soaked and disheveled, her parents didn't ask about her condition. Their first words were demands about whether Nathan would intervene for Damian.

Victoria could only shake her head silently, her face a mask of defeat.
###Chapter 57

"Worthless girl!" Richard Sterling, Victoria's father, winced in pain as he coughed violently before lashing out at his daughter. "After all these years clinging to Nathan, what have you actually done for this family? Not a single asset secured, no marriage contract signed - it's clear he doesn't care about you at all! Giving birth to a daughter like you was nothing but a financial burden!"

Victoria's eyes burned with unshed tears. Her father had always favored sons over daughters. When Margaret was pregnant with Victoria, Richard had demanded an abortion upon learning the baby was female. Only the doctor's warning that termination would leave Margaret permanently infertile - combined with her mother's desperate pleas - had allowed Victoria to be born.

The consequence? After Victoria's birth, Margaret never conceived again. This sealed Richard's resentment toward his only daughter.

From childhood, Victoria lived in her brother Damian's shadow. Starved for attention, she'd attached herself to her aunt Penelope Whitmore. The young girl quickly shed her innocence, mastering manipulation as a survival skill. Her ambition? To earn her father's respect and become Crestview's most powerful woman.

Nathan Blackwood had been her first test subject at age eight.

Initially, Victoria had scorned Nathan's status as an illegitimate heir, setting her sights on his elder brother instead.

But Penelope advised using Nathan as practice. "Even if he's not your ultimate target," her aunt had purred, "having a wealthy boy as your devoted follower never hurts."

Thus, Penelope orchestrated Victoria's role as Nathan's savior - the radiant light in his darkest hour. This carefully crafted illusion became the foundation of Nathan's obsession.

Though Victoria's connection to Nathan brought the Sterling family countless benefits, Richard still treated her as a disposable pawn. One misstep, and she became "useless" in his eyes.

Bitter hatred twisted Victoria's features. Let Damian rot in prison, she thought viciously. Then Sterling Corporation will be mine - even if it's just an empty shell by then!

"Enough, Richard!" Margaret rushed to embrace her daughter while glaring at her husband. "How can you blame Victoria when Nathan refuses to help? This is your fault for spoiling Damian into thinking rules don't apply to him! Typical - men always take their failures out on women!"

Richard clenched his fists, barely restraining his temper. He couldn't forget that Margaret's sister was married to Leonard Blackwood - a connection too valuable to jeopardize.

"Our immediate priorities," he ground out, "are restoring the company's reputation and finalizing Victoria's wedding date with Nathan."

Margaret's expression darkened at the mention of Nathan's refusal. "If persuasion fails," she said coldly, "get pregnant. Once you're carrying a Blackwood heir, they'll have no choice but to accept you."

"Mother!" Victoria panicked, pressing a hand to her abdomen.

Margaret sighed, remembering the stubborn stretch marks marring her daughter's stomach. "If the treatments don't work, cover them with tattoos. It's the quickest solution."

Victoria recoiled at the idea. Maintaining her pristine image was crucial - random tattoos didn't fit her carefully cultivated persona.

Yet after multiple laser treatments, the marks remained visible. If they didn't fade before the wedding, she might have no other choice.

Just then, servants descended the stairs carrying Victoria's belongings.

"Madam, we've packed everything."

"Mother! Those are my jewelry cases! Where are you taking them?"

"To be sold."

"What?! No! Those are my prized collections!"

Victoria lunged for the most valuable box - the one containing "Crimson Promise," a ruby pendant Nathan had commissioned as a love token. He'd flown to Belvaux three times, staying over two weeks to personally oversee its creation by a master jeweler.

Though Victoria didn't know its exact worth, such a flawless ruby was priceless - easily valued in seven figures. Nathan had always been extravagantly generous.

"The company needs liquidity," Margaret said firmly. "Selling our jewelry can keep us afloat. There's a charity auction in two weeks - our attendance will help rehabilitate our image. Plus, it's Reginald Blackwood's birthday soon. We'll purchase his gift there - two objectives achieved at once!"

Her gaze softened slightly as she added, "Once you marry Nathan, he'll shower you with jewels. Don't sacrifice the greater prize for temporary losses. You'll be the future Lady Blackwood - our only hope now that Damian's useless to us!"

Victoria hesitated painfully before finally, reluctantly, surrendering the jewelry box.
###Chapter 58

The Monarch Group was facing an unprecedented crisis of public trust and product quality.

Social media erupted with calls to boycott the Sterling family's businesses. Out of the 500 luxury boutiques that Damian Sterling had proudly expanded nationwide, 400 shuttered their doors within days. The remaining stores barely clung to survival, liquidating inventory at devastating losses.

Richard Sterling, already weakened by illness, collapsed under the financial strain.

Margaret Sterling rushed to her sister's mansion, desperate for assistance. But Penelope Whitmore could only offer empty condolences. "Reginald has made his position clear," she whispered, clutching her sister's trembling hands. "Anyone who aids the Sterlings will be cut off from the Blackwood fortune."

Though unable to rescue the failing business, Penelope revealed her consolation prize. "Leonard has finalized the wedding date for Victoria and Nathan. The ceremony will take place the weekend after Reginald's birthday celebration."

"Must we wait that long?" Margaret snapped, her manicured nails digging into the sofa's silk upholstery. Every passing day brought her family closer to ruin.

Penelope leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Did you hear about Evelyn Carter's scandal? The Kingsley heir personally collected her after the divorce. My maids saw everything."

Margaret's face twisted with envy. While her daughter struggled to secure Nathan's commitment, that gold-digging ex-wife had somehow landed Sebastian Kingsley - a man whose influence rivaled the Blackwoods.

"Do you suppose..." Penelope's eyes gleamed maliciously, "...Evelyn convinced Sebastian to target your family?"

Margaret shot upright, her designer dress wrinkling. "That scheming witch! First she ruins Victoria's engagement, now she interferes after the divorce?" Her voice turned venomous. "Does she think the Kingsley name makes her untouchable?"

Penelope sipped her Darjeeling tea with calculated nonchalance. "Sebastian's current favorite enjoys certain... protections. But imagine the scandal if her true nature were revealed at Reginald's birthday gala."

A cruel smile spread across Margaret's face. "Perfect. Let's see how high she climbs before we cut her strings."

Meanwhile, in the executive suite of Monarch Grand Hotels, Evelyn Carter dominated her gaming console with ruthless precision.

Between managing the corporate crisis, she'd cleared her afternoon schedule for this violent virtual battlefield. Blood splattered across the monitor as she executed another flawless combo.

Theodore Winslow entered just as a digital decapitation filled the screen. He recoiled, shielding his eyes. "Must you play that grotesque game at work?"

Evelyn didn't pause her slaughter. "Speak quickly or leave. I'm on a winning streak."

"Theodore produced a file while carefully avoiding the carnage onscreen. "Two developments you'll find... intriguing."

"You're hopeless." Evelyn rolled her eyes as her character bisected another enemy. "We're visiting haunted houses until you grow a spine."

After annihilating the final boss, she examined the documents. "Why are you showing me Kingsley Pawn receipts?"

Theodore's lips curled. "Because Margaret Sterling didn't pawn her jewelry. She sold it outright."
###Chapter 59

Nathan's lips curled into an amused smirk. "Ms. Carter, you asked me to monitor the Sterling family's activities, and I've uncovered something quite intriguing."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with sly satisfaction. "I expected as much. Without Blackwood Industries' support, the Sterlings would be desperate for funds. Though I assumed they'd sell their estate—not just pawn off jewelry. Tsk. Seems they're holding onto more wealth than they let on."

"They're clinging to their last scraps of fortune," Nathan remarked coldly. "Watching them crumble slowly is almost more satisfying than seeing them fall all at once."

Evelyn didn't respond. Instead, she leisurely flipped through the files of the pawned items.

Few knew the Kingsley family operated high-end pawn shops in Crestview and Fairhaven.

Harrison Kingsley had a passion for rare antiques—paintings, sculptures, and priceless artifacts. To feed this obsession, he discreetly established two pawn shops, ensuring a steady stream of unexpected treasures.

Over the years, he'd acquired countless valuables this way. After all, most clients never reclaimed their items in time.

Then Evelyn froze.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she stared at Crimson Promise. A rush of fury and bitter amusement surged through her.

This pendant had been Nathan's love token to Victoria—a gift he'd gone to great lengths to obtain two years ago. The first time Evelyn saw it shimmering under the light, she had coveted it desperately.

Back then, she'd foolishly dreamed it was meant for her. She would have cherished even the smallest trinket from him.

But dreams were just that—dreams.

Nathan only bestowed gifts on those he loved. And since he didn’t love her, she received nothing.

Now, Victoria had sold the very symbol of his devotion. The irony was almost laughable.

"I wonder how Nathan would react if he knew," she murmured.

"What was that?" Theodore asked, catching only fragments of her words.

"The Sterlings clearly don’t know the value of what they’ve pawned. This piece is worth eight figures, yet they settled for seven million? We’ve made quite the profit." Her smile turned razor-sharp.

Just then, her phone buzzed—Sebastian was calling.

"Ash!" Her voice softened instantly, honey-sweet.

"Evelyn, how are you? Need anything?" His tone was warm, protective.

"I'm fine. But you should rest. Don’t overwork yourself."

After a brief exchange, Sebastian said, "There’s a charity auction this weekend. Would you attend in my place? Father wants that antique rosewood chair—budget’s a hundred million. I’ll be at church, so I can’t go. Think you could handle it?"

"Me? Should I introduce myself as the Monarch Group CEO’s girlfriend?" She teased, unwrapping a chocolate bar and taking a bite.

"Sure."

Evelyn nearly choked.

"Go as whoever you like," he chuckled. "Or just tell them you’re the Kingsleys’ most prized treasure."

She chewed thoughtfully. "Not a bad idea."

Sebastian’s voice softened. "You’ve never appeared in public before. No one in Crestview’s elite circles would recognize you. Consider it a chance to enjoy yourself."

"Fine. But a hundred million seems low. What if I spot something I want?"

"Bid. I’ll cover it. Just remember our family rule—if you want something, take it. Leave no room for competition."

"I know. Harrison’s motto—always stay three steps ahead." She snapped her fingers, grinning.

"Good luck, Evelyn. And don’t forget the chair."

After hanging up, Theodore frowned. "Ms. Carter, since we’re attending in Mr. Kingsley’s stead, we should bring an auction item. But it’s short notice—"

"Oh, I already have the perfect piece in mind."

Evelyn’s smile was pure mischief.
###Chapter 60

The weekend had finally arrived.

Dozens of journalists clustered outside Crestview Auction House's gilded gates, barred from entering the exclusive venue.

Wealthy patrons valued their anonymity above all else.

Inside, only serious collectors and investment bankers roamed the halls, their minds focused solely on potential profits. Unlike celebrities craving publicity, these elite attendees had no interest in media attention. Their eyes remained fixed on the priceless treasures displayed under glass.

Except for Victoria Sterling, Margaret Sterling, and Penelope Whitmore.

For years, Penelope would arrive draped in her most extravagant gowns and jewels for this annual charity gala. She'd pose dramatically at the entrance like a fading starlet, basking in camera flashes until auction staff gently ushered her aside. It was as if she feared the world might forget she'd clawed her way into high society as a homewrecker two decades prior. Leonard Blackwood hadn't attended these events recently - likely too embarrassed by his wife's antics.

This year proved different. After Victoria's persistent pleading, Penelope reluctantly agreed to let her daughter take center stage. No matter how much she craved the spotlight, she couldn't refuse Victoria's request.

Now Victoria and Margaret stood at the entrance, playing hostesses.

"We're honored to attend tonight's auction," Margaret announced to reporters, her voice dripping with practiced elegance. "Not only to acquire exceptional pieces, but to support such worthy causes."

"Mrs. Sterling," a reporter called out sharply, "is it true Sterling Corporation faces imminent bankruptcy?"

Another shouted, "Has Mr. Sterling's investigation concluded? Will he serve prison time?"

Then came the question that made Victoria's blood run cold: "Rumor has it your daughter's engagement to Blackwood Industries' CEO is in trouble. Any comment?"

"Trouble?" Victoria's grip tightened on her couture gown's hem as she turned on the reporter. "What exactly are you implying?"

The journalist smirked. "No need for defensiveness, Ms. Sterling. It's a fair question. As your fiancé, Mr. Blackwood hasn't lifted a finger during your family's crisis. His silence speaks volumes."

"Nathan and I are perfectly fine!" Victoria's voice rose an octave, betraying her anxiety over Nathan's recent distance.

Margaret smoothly stepped between them. "My daughter's relationship with Mr. Blackwood remains strong. As for business matters between our companies, those are confidential."

Another reporter called out, "Mr. Blackwood arrived thirty minutes ago. Why didn't you attend together?"

Margaret opened her mouth to protest, but the truth left them both speechless.

Meanwhile, inside the glittering auction hall, Nathan Blackwood stood with his assistant Oliver Sinclair when Julian Montgomery approached.

"Nathan!" Julian grinned, wrapping an arm around Nathan's waist. "Someone's been hitting the gym."

He playfully poked Nathan's toned abdomen.

"Hands off," Nathan warned, his icy glare making Julian withdraw.

"So touchy," Julian teased, instead slinging an arm over Nathan's broad shoulders. "Your fiancée and future mother-in-law are making quite the scene outside. Not going to rescue them?"

"Best not to draw attention."

Julian snorted. "At least you're not completely blinded by love to bail out the Sterlings. Their shoddy business practices are legendary."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Watch your tongue."

"Just looking out for you, brother," Julian said, lowering his voice. "Grandfather nearly barred them from tonight's event. Only allowed it to avoid offending you. You know they don't belong here."

"For now," Nathan said quietly. "But Victoria will be my wife. When that happens, I expect your attitude toward her to change. She's not like her family."

Julian sighed. "Fine. But you won't like what I'm about to say."

"Then don't say it."

Ignoring the warning, Julian continued, "Between us? Your stunning, resilient ex-wife was better suited to you. A man made of ice needs fire to warm him up."
###Chapter 61

Oliver Sinclair pressed both hands over his mouth, his shoulders shaking violently as he struggled to contain his laughter. His face turned crimson from the effort.

Nathan Blackwood felt a sharp pang of irritation in his chest. His voice was ice when he spoke. "Evelyn Carter and I have no future together. I would never stoop so low as to retract the divorce papers."

Julian Montgomery merely shrugged, deciding not to call out his friend's obvious lie. He smoothly changed the subject.

"Any particular items catching your eye at tonight's auction?"

"That antique mahogany armchair."

Nathan needed it for his grandfather Reginald's upcoming birthday celebration.

"Excellent choice!" Julian grinned. "Shall I discourage other bidders from competing?"

"Unnecessary."

Nathan shook his head slightly. "This is a charity event. If fate intends the chair for me, no one can take it. Forcing the outcome would ruin the sport of it."

The two imposing figures strode into the grand ballroom, making their way to the coveted front row seats reserved for Crestview's most elite. Their arrival immediately drew every eye in the room.

Society ladies fanned themselves, cheeks flushing pink.

"Mr. Blackwood is absolutely divine! He's everything I've ever dreamed of!"

"Dream elsewhere, darling. Haven't you heard? He's engaged to marry Victoria Sterling."

"That tacky furniture heiress? Good heavens! The Sterlings aren't fit to polish his shoes! Has the man gone blind?"

"Victoria's been his childhood sweetheart. He divorced his wife specifically to marry her. Do you really think you stand a chance against that?"

"Poor ex-wife... And have you seen how that Sterling girl flaunts herself? I give the marriage two years at most!"

Nathan sat with effortless elegance, his cold demeanor creating an invisible barrier. His gaze drifted sideways, landing on the name card across the aisle: Sebastian Kingsley.

His lips pressed into a thin line.

"Don't blame me," Julian whispered. "My grandfather personally arranged these seating charts weeks ago. This row represents Crestview's power hierarchy - even your stepmother Penelope and those airhead half-sisters are seated in the back. Sebastian Kingsley is Monarch Group's CEO - the Hoffman family can't afford to take sides between titans like you two."

Outside in the lobby, Penelope Whitmore and Margaret Sterling were holding court with several society matrons. Cassandra Blackwood and Victoria Sterling stood arm-in-arm, their fake camaraderie almost convincing. Notably absent was Eleanor Blackwood.

"Where's Eleanor gone off to?" Victoria inquired sweetly.

"Who cares? As long as she doesn't embarrass us by dying somewhere." Cassandra's face twisted with disgust at the mention of her autistic sister.

"Oh darling, you mustn't say such things! She's your blood!" Victoria's voice dripped with false concern, secretly delighting in the growing rift between the sisters.

Just then, confident footsteps echoed through the marble hall.

All heads turned as Evelyn Carter made her entrance in a sleek black tuxedo that hugged her curves, paired with lethal stilettos. Her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile.

Beside her, Theodore Winslow looked every inch the dashing prince in his tailored suit.

The striking pair would have swept past the gathered women unnoticed, but Penelope couldn't resist a jab.

"My! What a surprise to see you here! How... democratic of these charity events to welcome everyone." Her tone implied Evelyn had no place among Crestview's elite.

Evelyn paused mid-stride, one hand sliding into her pocket as she turned with a razor-sharp smile.

"How provincial you sound, Penelope. But then again, limited exposure does tend to make everything seem surprising, doesn't it?"
###Chapter 62

The elite socialites surrounding Penelope Whitmore gasped in unison, their perfectly manicured hands flying to their mouths as they turned to stare at Evelyn Carter.

Their designer-clad bodies stiffened with shock. None had imagined this breathtaking woman before them was Nathan Blackwood's former wife. The sheer audacity of her presence suggested she must hail from formidable lineage to dare challenge Penelope so openly.

Penelope's face contorted with rage. "How amusing!" she spat through clenched teeth. "Little Evelyn has grown claws since finding new benefactors. Who knew you possessed such sharp wit?"

Evelyn arched one sculpted eyebrow, unfazed by the venom. "I merely reflect the tone set by my company. What does courtesy have to do with social climbing?" Her voice dripped with icy amusement.

A scarlet flush crept up Penelope's neck as fury clouded her vision.

"Evelyn!" Cassandra Blackwood shoved forward, her designer heels clicking furiously against the marble. "How dare you speak to my mother like that? Show some respect!"

Evelyn's lips curled in a derisive smile.

The younger Blackwood had inherited her mother's cunning but none of her subtlety. Evelyn found such transparent hostility almost refreshing in its predictability.

"Does the entire room require spectacles?"

Theodore Winslow materialized at Evelyn's side, his protective stance unmistakable. "The witnesses here can attest who initiated hostilities," he stated coldly, his gaze sweeping the assembled crowd.

"Oh my," Victoria Sterling purred, seizing the moment. "Ms. Carter certainly commands masculine protection. First Mr. Blackwood, now this dashing guardian. How... resourceful."

Evelyn's emerald eyes flashed like honed blades. "Speak carelessly if you wish, Victoria. But consider the consequences when your words return to haunt you."

A visible tremor ran through Victoria's slender frame.

She'd always dismissed Evelyn as some provincial simpleton - easily intimidated and quicker to retreat than fight.

This glacial-eyed woman unsettled her profoundly.

"Ms. Carter," Margaret Sterling interjected with saccharine concern, "we only mention your presence here as... well-meaning advice." Her smile didn't reach her calculating eyes. "That youthful indisposition where you... inserted yourself between Victoria and Nathan was understandable - you were so very young. But now?" She spread her hands in mock sympathy. "With their reconciliation and impending nuptials, your appearance as the ex-wife creates such awkwardness. We wouldn't mention it except for concern over your reputation."

Victoria smirked at her mother's masterful performance.

The assembled elite murmured their disapproval, gazes turning judgmental.

So this stunning creature was the infamous ex-wife who'd allegedly stolen Nathan from Victoria!

How utterly scandalous!

"Inserted myself?" Evelyn's musical laughter rang out, devoid of anger. "Margaret darling, your imagination rivals the shoddy craftsmanship of Luxe Furnishings' cheapest line."

Margaret's face purpled with rage.

"Your precious daughter crumbled under the Blackwood family's scrutiny and ended things with Nathan. He was unattached when we married." Evelyn's voice turned razor-sharp. "Shall I recount every pathetic attempt Victoria made to sabotage our marriage during those three years? Every midnight call? Every threatening message?"

Victoria blanched, her carefully constructed composure cracking.

Margaret stiffened - they both knew Evelyn possessed damning evidence of Victoria's relentless harassment.

"Theodore," Evelyn commanded softly, "show them."

With deliberate slowness, Theodore produced the document that silenced the room - Evelyn and Nathan's still-valid marriage certificate.

The crowd gasped.

Victoria looked as though she'd been slapped.

"Observe," Evelyn purred, "our divorce remains unconsummated, yet someone's already measuring for wedding drapes." Her triumphant smile could have frozen the Mediterranean.

Victoria's nails bit into her palms. What sort of deranged woman carried her marriage license to social events?!

Evelyn Carter was proving far more formidable than anyone had anticipated.
###Chapter 63

Evelyn always kept her marriage certificate in her purse, prepared at any moment to finalize her divorce from Nathan.

This time, the document served as undeniable proof that she and Nathan were still legally married, leaving the entire crowd stunned into silence.

Victoria and Margaret stood frozen, their mouths agape. With the marriage certificate right before their eyes, what argument could they possibly make? Any further protest would only humiliate them further.

"Now the world can judge for themselves who the real homewrecker is in this situation."

With those cutting words, Evelyn tucked the certificate away and strode off, leaving everyone gaping in her wake.

Victoria remained rooted to the spot, her face burning with shame and fury.

The charity auction was about to begin in five minutes. Nearly all the elite guests had taken their seats.

Penelope and Cassandra occupied seats in the third row. From the moment they entered, Cassandra hadn't been able to tear her gaze away from Julian.

"He's absolutely breathtaking."

"This Hoffman Foundation event is too exclusive. I couldn't even secure us front row seats," Penelope complained bitterly.

"Don't worry, darling. I'll arrange for you to meet Mr. Montgomery properly soon. You're far more accomplished and beautiful than any of these socialites. He'll be smitten in no time."

Though Julian had quite the reputation in Crestview as a playboy, Penelope was determined to matchmake her daughter with him.

Besides, Cassandra was clearly infatuated. It would be a perfect arrangement.

"Mother, Nathan and Julian are best friends. Couldn't you ask Nathan to introduce us?" Cassandra pleaded.

Penelope's expression darkened. She'd already approached Nathan about it, only to be flatly refused.

"Where's Eleanor?"

"She probably wandered off again. Mother, why must you always bring her along? She either sulks or disappears during events. She's an embarrassment!"

Cassandra had never hidden her disdain for her younger sister.

"You know your sister's... special condition. She's twenty now. I want her to socialize more. If any respectable family shows interest, I'll marry her off immediately. One less burden to worry about." Penelope sighed wearily.

She spoke as though discussing livestock at auction rather than her own daughter.

Meanwhile, Victoria and Margaret fumed in their seats.

Despite their lavish attire, they'd been relegated to the very last row among dozens of seating sections.

"Mother! Nathan's sitting in the front! I want to go to him!"

Victoria lifted her gown impatiently, but a security guard immediately blocked her path.

"My apologies, Ms. Sterling. Seating assignments are fixed. No exceptions."

"How dare you stop me? Do you know who I am?" Victoria sneered arrogantly.

"Indeed I do. You're Mr. Blackwood's girlfriend." The guard remained impassive.

Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

"Chairman Montgomery personally arranged all seating. Not even Mrs. Blackwood would be permitted to change seats."

Fury made Victoria's eyes bulge. She wanted to argue further, but Margaret yanked her back down.

"Enough! It's just a seat. Don't make a scene!"

Even as she said this, Margaret noted bitterly how Penelope and her daughter sat comfortably in the third row, chatting and laughing without a care, having completely forgotten about them.

Some things never changed. Even as children, Penelope had always outshone her in everything. All her promises about helping Victoria gain attention tonight had been empty words.

The venue had nearly filled, with only Sebastian's seat remaining conspicuously empty.

Nathan glanced sideways briefly before looking away.

"Strange. Where's Mr. Kingsley? Running late?" Julian murmured curiously.

Just then, the grand doors at the rear swung open.

Every head turned. Even the typically aloof Nathan found himself glancing back.

His breath caught. Blood pounded in his ears.

There stood his ex-wife, radiating confidence in her sleek black suit and stiletto heels. She moved toward the front row with effortless grace, ignoring the stares. A goddess descending among mortals.
###Chapter 64

Evelyn didn't choose an elaborate gown for the occasion. She wore a sleek pantsuit of her own design, tailored to perfection.

Pinned to her lapel was Aurora's Tear, a breathtaking yellow diamond brooch crafted by the legendary jewelry house Celestial Atelier.

Her confident stride turned heads as she moved through the elite crowd, her presence commanding attention where others merely existed.

While the society ladies resembled pampered dolls, Evelyn carried herself with the regal bearing of a queen.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as she watched her rival become the center of attention.

The whispers started immediately among Victoria's circle of friends.

"Good heavens! Who is that stunning woman?"

"She can't be more than twenty-five, yet she carries herself like a Fortune 500 CEO!"

"That brooch...is that really Aurora's Tear? Three years ago, someone offered nine figures for it and was flatly refused!"

The mention of Aurora's Tear sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Every jewelry connoisseur knew about Celestial Atelier's masterpiece that had caused a sensation at its debut exhibition.

Victoria's rage blinded her to Evelyn's accessories until now. The sight of that brooch made her jaw clench painfully.

"Look at Evelyn, already milking Sebastian Kingsley for all he's worth," Margaret sneered, her envy barely concealed.

She turned to her daughter with disdain. "I raised you with every advantage, yet some country bumpkin outshines you! If not for my sister's connections introducing you to Nathan, you'd never have caught his eye!"

"Mother! I've already won him! Why must you undermine me?" Victoria's fists trembled at her sides.

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. "So what if Evelyn's sleeping with Sebastian Kingsley? The Sterling family rivals the Blackwoods! Besides, Evelyn's divorced goods - Nathan would never return to her. He's mine forever!"

"Don't count your chickens before they hatch," Margaret warned darkly. "Nathan's grown distant, even I can see that. And Reginald still refuses to acknowledge you - he's delaying the divorce proceedings at every turn. That means there's still a chance for reconciliation. If you think the battle's won just because Evelyn moved out, you're a fool!"

Victoria knew Nathan's affection had cooled, but his recent absence left her no opportunity to rekindle his interest.

As Evelyn passed the back rows, her subtle perfume wafted over Penelope and Cassandra.

"Mother, where is that peasant sitting?" Cassandra asked nervously.

Penelope's smile faltered. She'd thought Evelyn lucky to get any seat at all, yet here she was striding toward the VIP section where the elite gathered.

Nathan watched Evelyn approach, his pulse quickening unexpectedly.

But Evelyn's gaze swept past him without recognition, as if he were a stranger. She took her seat gracefully beside Sebastian's reserved place.

"Sebastian sent Evelyn as his representative? Since when?" Julian murmured in shock.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his brow furrowing as he studied the woman now sitting mere feet away.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved in a faint smile, her luminous beauty radiating cool detachment.

Her deliberate indifference stung more than any insult.

"Bloody hell! She's had Aurora's Tear all along!" Julian slapped his knee. "Three years ago I offered a fortune for that piece as my mother's birthday gift. Begged Celestial Atelier to sell it! And now Evelyn's wearing it casually? Sebastian must be utterly smitten to gift something so priceless. The man has my respect!"

Nathan's chest tightened at Julian's words.

He knew exactly what it meant to go to extraordinary lengths for jewelry meant to impress a woman.

Nathan had once taken two weeks from his packed schedule to personally travel to Belvaux, enduring countless rejections before securing The Crimson Promise for Victoria's birthday.

In three years of marriage, he'd never given Evelyn a single meaningful gift.

Now Sebastian showered her with treasures beyond imagination.

Nathan's frown deepened as an unfamiliar bitterness settled in his chest.

Seeing another man cherish his ex-wife so extravagantly left him unsettled.

The contrast made him feel painfully inadequate.

With all attendees seated, the auction commenced.

Julian, representing the Montgomery family, took the stage for opening remarks. His YSL couture suit accentuated his natural charm.

Cassandra gaped openly, already fantasizing about their future together and mentally listing baby names.

As applause thundered through the hall, Julian descended from the stage. His dazzling smile included a playful wink directed solely at Evelyn.
###Chapter 65

Evelyn's almond-shaped eyes narrowed slightly before she rolled them in exasperation.

Nathan's chiseled features darkened as he watched Julian flirt shamelessly with his ex-wife.

"Bro, how was my performance just now?" Julian grinned as he returned to his seat beside Nathan, nudging him playfully with his elbow.

"Impressive," Nathan replied through gritted teeth. His knuckles turned white as he added, "Do that again and I'll feed you to the sharks."

Julian pouted dramatically. "What did I do this time? You're more high-maintenance than all my ex-girlfriends combined!"

The first auction item was unveiled - a Renaissance landscape painting with intricate details. Though beautifully executed, the unknown artist meant the starting bid was only $1 million.

Nathan normally had little interest in historical artifacts, but years of exposure to Reginald's collection had given him an expert eye. He recognized this piece immediately - an exact replica of the original hanging in his grandfather's studio.

There was an important distinction between replicas and forgeries. High-quality reproductions could command respectable prices, but no collector would choose one over an authentic masterpiece.

"$1.5 million!"

"$2 million!"

"$3 million!"

Just as the auctioneer raised his gavel, a melodious voice cut through the murmurs.

"$5 million." Evelyn lifted her paddle with effortless grace.

The crowd turned as one to stare at this enigmatic beauty. Nathan studied Evelyn's profile, suspicion gnawing at him.

First, the painting wasn't worth half that amount. Second, having spent years assisting Reginald with his collection, Evelyn would know this was a reproduction. Why bid so extravagantly?

"$6 million!"

All heads swiveled toward the back where Victoria waved her paddle aggressively, determined to steal Evelyn's spotlight.

"$7 million." Evelyn countered calmly.

"$8 million!" Victoria practically shouted, drawing disapproving glances.

Penelope grew nervous. This was escalating beyond reason for an opening lot. "Should we bid too?" Cassandra whispered, jealous of Victoria's attention.

"Let them have their little battle," Penelope advised, knowing the truly valuable items would come later.

"$9 million." Evelyn raised her paddle with finality.

Penelope's stomach clenched. This far exceeded their gift budget for Reginald.

"$10 million!" Victoria crowed triumphantly.

The room erupted in murmurs.

Julian chuckled. "For a reproduction? I should send your ex-wife flowers - or maybe your fiancée deserves the bouquet?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his interlaced fingers turning white at the knuckles.

"Victoria, stop!" Penelope hissed. "This is madness!"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with mischief as she pretended to consider another bid before lowering her paddle.

"Sold to Ms. Sterling for $10 million!"

Victoria preened victoriously while Penelope looked ready to faint.

Outside, Theodore watched the proceedings through his phone with admiration. "Brilliant play, Evelyn. You made that viper pay ten times the value for a copy." He shook his head in awe. "You know exactly how to manipulate that woman's ego."
###Chapter 66

Nathan's expression darkened. His lips pressed into a thin line as he thought, If Evelyn was willing to pay $9 million for that painting, $10 million wouldn’t have been an issue either.

Evelyn had stopped bidding—not because she couldn’t afford it, but because she had deliberately withdrawn. She was playing him.

Yet, Nathan couldn’t say a word about it. After all, no one had forced Victoria to follow Evelyn’s lead and overpay for the piece. She had done it willingly.

He remained composed, refusing to bid on any other items.

Nathan had only been interested in the antique rosewood chair, so he stayed silent.

The next lot was a pair of jadeite stones donated by Penelope on behalf of Blackwood Industries. The starting price was set at $2 million.

Evelyn scoffed under her breath, shaking her head in disdain.

She’d rather spend her money on the replica earlier than waste it on these two worthless rocks. Only fools would fall for this.

As expected, there were hardly any bidders. The auctioneer struggled to drive up the price, and in the end, they sold for a measly $2.6 million.

Penelope’s smile faltered.

Nathan remained indifferent, as if it had nothing to do with him.

Whatever humiliation Penelope faced would only reflect poorly on Leonard. And Nathan had never been close to his father anyway.

The next item was announced. "This generous donation comes from Monarch Group, presented by Ms. Lillian Hartwell—a pair of 18th-century azure porcelain teacups!"

Every collector in the room immediately perked up.

Evelyn stiffened. Her gaze darted across the crowd behind her.

Then she spotted Lillian’s elegant figure seated in the back row.

Panicked, she quickly texted Theodore. [Why is Aunt Lillian here? Why wasn’t I told?!]

Theodore replied instantly. [Ms. Evelyn, I just found out myself! Chairman Harrison must have sent her last minute as backup.]

Evelyn cursed under her breath. Damn it. Harrison never plays by the rules.

Nearly every member of the Blackwood family was present tonight. With Lillian here, Evelyn feared her identity as the Monarch Group heiress might be exposed.

Just then, she noticed Lillian subtly flashing her an okay sign, followed by a conspiratorial wink—like a secret between best friends.

A wave of warmth rushed through Evelyn’s chest. She immediately understood.

Oh, Aunt Lillian. You always know exactly what to do.

The auctioneer continued, "This porcelain is exceptionally rare, yet Madam Hartwell has generously donated a pair! The Kingsley family’s generosity is unmatched—truly befitting a conglomerate of their stature."

Murmurs spread through the crowd.

"Blackwood Industries is also a major conglomerate, yet look what they donated. Those two rocks probably aren’t even worth the garden ornaments at my estate."

"Mr. Blackwood certainly has questionable taste in wives."

Penelope’s face burned with humiliation. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat.

The stark contrast between her donation and Lillian’s made Penelope look embarrassingly cheap.

For the first time that evening, Nathan showed interest in an auction item. He spun his paddle between his fingers, deep in thought.

Evelyn murmured, "That’s imperial-grade porcelain—the color of rain after a storm."

Nathan turned to her, surprised.

Evelyn was completely absorbed in the teacups. Her porcelain-like skin glowed under the lights, her delicate brows slightly furrowed in concentration.

For the first time, Nathan truly saw her.

She was breathtaking.

And he had never noticed before.
###Chapter 67

Nathan's heart belonged to another.

Sometimes he even thought Evelyn was throwing her life away by staying with him.

Her breathtaking beauty deserved better.

His gaze drifted downward, landing on Evelyn's delicate wrist.

She still wore that jade bracelet from Reginald. Though it clashed with her outfit, she refused to remove it. Clearly, she cherished the gift.

Nathan's eyes narrowed as he drew a sharp breath.

The 18th-century porcelain set sparked furious bidding that left the auctioneer breathless.

"Ten million!"

"Twenty-five million!"

"Twenty-seven!"

"Forty million."

Nathan's paddle shot up, his commanding voice silencing the room.

The crowd gasped in unison.

Evelyn whipped her head toward him in surprise.

This man has terrible taste in women but impeccable taste in antiques, she thought.

Nathan caught her stare. He tilted his head, meeting her gaze directly.

Her icy, piercing look stabbed through him. His chest constricted painfully.

Evelyn quickly averted her eyes.

Nathan secured the porcelain teacups, earning envious glances from every attendee.

"You'll serve me tea in these when I visit!" Julian grinned. "Only forty-million-dollar china suits my status!"

"Too small for you." Nathan deadpanned. "I have something more fitting."

"Oh? What's that?"

"The toilet bowl."

Julian's face darkened. "Asshole! You're insufferable!"

Evelyn overheard and stifled a laugh.

Victoria's chest ached. Why waste forty million on teacups when he could buy a luxury villa?

She hadn't even married him yet, but already worried about his spending habits.

"Our next item holds extraordinary significance," the auctioneer announced. "Privately held for fifty years - a 17th-century rosewood chair of exceptional quality."

Four white-gloved attendants carefully unveiled the masterpiece.

"Brother, it's starting!" Julian urgently nudged Nathan.

Both Nathan and Evelyn snapped to attention, spines straight, no longer leaning against their chairs.

Their competitive spirits ignited simultaneously.

"Opening bid: thirty million!"

Wealthy tycoons raised paddles as numbers climbed rapidly. This was tonight's most expensive lot.

Shannon and Cassandra, who craved attention, shrank back at the staggering figures.

Victoria and Margaret became mere spectators, blending into the floral arrangements at the hall's rear.

Then a slender, pale hand lifted gracefully. Ruby lips parted with calm authority.

"Sixty million."

Every head turned toward Evelyn Carter and her raised paddle.
###Chapter 68

The mysterious beauty exuded arrogance as she dramatically escalated the bidding price.

Mom, did I hear that correctly?

Cassandra Blackwood was stunned. Did that country girl just bid sixty million dollars? How dare she raise the price so recklessly? Was she bluffing?

Penelope Whitmore remained silent, her icy gaze locked onto Evelyn Carter’s back.

A sudden realization struck Penelope. She smirked and glanced toward Lillian Hartwell, Harrison Kingsley’s second wife.

Does that little gold-digger Evelyn really think she can marry into the Kingsley family? We’ll see about that.

"Seventy million."

Nathan Blackwood’s deep voice cut through the tension as he lifted his sculpted hand. The light cast a striking silhouette across his sharp features, making several women in the room sigh in admiration.

His bid forced many competitors to withdraw in frustration.

"Seventy-five million."

Evelyn didn’t hesitate, her expression unreadable as she raised her paddle again.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Even Julian Montgomery, a seasoned auction attendee, was speechless.

It felt like witnessing a high-stakes duel—two forces of cold dominance clashing, the air thick with tension.

"Eighty million." Nathan remained composed, though irritation flickered in his eyes.

She’s really determined to help Sebastian win this.

Evelyn pressed her tongue against her cheek, suppressing her frustration.

Even if she exceeded her budget, she’d use her own funds to outbid Nathan.

But she wasn’t reckless.

Antiques held historical value, but she had limits. Eighty million was already pushing it—anything beyond would be pure pettiness.

Nathan, why are you being so insufferable?

Julian leaned in, whispering, "Evelyn clearly wants this chair. Why not let her have it? She’s your ex-wife. Isn’t it ungentlemanly to publicly fight her like this?"

Nathan didn’t even glance at him. "She’s representing Sebastian Kingsley. This isn’t about her—it’s about Monarch Group."

Julian exhaled sharply and gave up.

"Eighty million, going once! Eighty million, going twice—"

"One hundred million!"

A sharp feminine voice rang out from the back. Nathan’s brows twitched, but he didn’t turn.

All eyes landed on the elegant woman holding her paddle high—Lillian Hartwell, Harrison Kingsley’s second wife.

Evelyn’s lips curved in satisfaction. Now she understood why Lillian was here.

Harrison must have sent her as insurance, in case Sebastian hesitated to spend.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. He could afford the bid, but continuing would be undignified.

In the end, Monarch Group secured the antique rosewood chair, earning thunderous applause.

Just as the crowd thought the auction was over, the auctioneer announced with a smile:

"Our final item, generously donated by Monarch Group—a masterpiece from renowned Belvaux jeweler, crafted over a month. Presenting… Crimson Promise!"

Nathan’s breath hitched. His heart stopped.

It felt like a bullet had just pierced his chest.
###Chapter 69

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Her face drained of color as if struck by a bolt of lightning.

Beside her, Margaret froze, her fingers tightening around the armrest.

"Mother! What is happening?"

Evelyn's voice was a whisper, sharp with panic. Cold sweat dotted her forehead. "You sold it—why is it here?"

"I did sell it!" Margaret hissed, her eyes wide with disbelief. "This can't be real!"

Nathan was right there.

He had seen it.

He knew.

Her stomach twisted. What would he think when he saw his precious gift—the symbol of his love—being auctioned off like some cheap trinket?

He would despise her.

Her vision blurred with unshed tears.

"Maybe it's a replica—" Margaret began weakly.

"It's not!" Evelyn snapped. "The auctioneer just confirmed it—Crimson Promise was custom-made for me! There's no other like it!"

Panic coiled between them, thick and suffocating.

Evelyn's mind raced—how could she explain this to Nathan?

Margaret, meanwhile, stared daggers into Evelyn's back.

Her thoughts spiraled.

That pawnshop—had it belonged to the Kingsleys?

Out of all the valuables they received daily, why would they donate this piece?

Unless...

Her lips curled.

That scheming little witch.

Only Evelyn would know the significance of Crimson Promise.

Only Evelyn would be petty enough to humiliate Nathan like this—to drive a wedge between him and Victoria.

At the front, Nathan's expression was glacial.

His chest rose and fell sharply beneath his tailored suit. A bead of sweat trailed down his temple.

"Nathan, are you alright?" Julian frowned at his friend's uncharacteristic reaction.

Nathan didn't answer.

His jaw clenched so tight it ached.

He had poured his soul into that necklace—sketched every curve, handpicked every gem, spent sleepless nights perfecting it.

It was supposed to be sacred.

Now, it was being paraded before a room full of vultures.

Humiliation burned through him like acid.

"The Crimson Promise," the auctioneer announced, "is a symbol of undying devotion. True love is priceless, so we will proceed with silent bidding—no reserve price."

Evelyn slumped, her stomach hollow.

The crowd buzzed with excitement, louder than during any previous lot.

Nathan couldn't take it anymore.

His voice was a blade.

"Stop this."

Julian blinked. "What?"

"Stop the auction. That necklace is mine."

Julian's mouth fell open.

Then Nathan noticed—Sebastian's seat was empty.

Evelyn had slipped away.

His fist slammed against the armrest. The air around him turned arctic.

Evelyn.

You wanted to shame me?

Well, congratulations.

She had orchestrated this spectacle—then left before the curtain fell.

Unseen, Evelyn stood before a bathroom mirror, exhaling slowly.

The show was just beginning.

But she had already lost interest in watching.
###Chapter 70

Evelyn had always been a refined young woman, raised with elegance by the Kingsley family. She never needed to resort to petty schemes to get what she wanted.

But after her divorce from Nathan, something dark awakened within her.

She remembered the exact moment Nathan's eyes shattered when Crimson Promise appeared on the auction stage. A pang of guilt shot through her - perhaps she'd gone too far this time.

She could have ignored the necklace. There was no need to publicly humiliate Nathan to this degree.

Yet Evelyn couldn't help her vindictive streak.

It wasn't the divorce that fueled her anger. She'd accepted that the love she'd chased for thirteen years was gone forever.

What infuriated her was how someone as intelligent as Nathan remained blind to Victoria's true nature.

"I went too far," she whispered to herself, pressing a hand to her aching chest. "This ends now."

This would be the last time she interfered in Nathan and Victoria's twisted relationship.

The bathroom door burst open with a violent kick.

Evelyn didn't flinch. She merely turned with icy composure.

Victoria stormed in, her elaborate dress nearly tripping her as she charged forward like a raging bull.

"Evelyn! You conniving witch!"

"Three years of insults and you still haven't expanded your vocabulary," Evelyn drawled, arching one perfectly shaped brow.

"It was you! You put Nathan's gift up for auction!" Victoria's face contorted with rage. "How could you be so vicious?!"

Her next step caught in her hem, sending her stumbling. The momentary humiliation made her forget her revenge plot.

"I was donating to charity," Evelyn said smoothly, stepping back warily. "Careful now, I'd hate to need rabies shots."

Victoria's eyes burned with hatred. "You're just bitter Nathan chose me! This pathetic attempt to drive us apart won't work! He'll never love you!"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "You sold the necklace yourself. Its fate is no longer your concern."

She turned to leave, unwilling to waste another breath on this woman.

If not for Nathan forcing their paths to cross, Evelyn wouldn't spare a second glance for such a pretentious social climber.

"Come back here, you bitch!"

Victoria lunged, grabbing Evelyn's wrist with bruising force.

Evelyn gasped as pain shot up her arm.

With a vicious yank, Victoria tore the jade bracelet from Evelyn's wrist - Reginald's precious gift - leaving an angry red mark on her delicate skin.

"Give that back!" Evelyn's almond eyes turned deadly sharp.

Victoria clutched the bracelet triumphantly. She'd coveted this piece since first seeing it, furious when the old man gave it to her rival.

"You stole what's rightfully mine!" Victoria spat. "If I can't have it, neither can you!"

With a malicious smile, she raised the bracelet high and smashed it against the marble countertop.

"No!"

The sickening crack of jade breaking echoed through the bathroom.

Evelyn's heart shattered along with Reginald's gift, now lying in three irreparable pieces on the cold floor.
###Chapter 71

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

That bracelet had been a gift from Reginald. Her most treasured piece of jewelry, now shattered by Victoria's cruel hands.

White-hot fury surged through Evelyn's veins. She wanted to snap Victoria's bones just as mercilessly as her bracelet had been destroyed.

"Victoria Sterling!" Evelyn's voice thundered through the bathroom, her eyes burning with rage.

Victoria flinched but quickly regained her composure.

"What does it matter if I broke it, Evelyn? There's no witnesses here. Who do you think Nathan will believe when I tell him you attacked me?"

A sinister smile curled Victoria's lips as she picked up the broken jade fragments from the sink. She extended her wrist dramatically.

Evelyn's blood ran cold as realization struck. She lunged forward - too late.

A sharp cry pierced the air.

Helpless, Evelyn watched as Victoria dragged the jagged edge across her own wrist. The cut wasn't fatal but deep enough to send crimson rivulets cascading onto the marble tiles.

Trembling with fear yet committed to her performance, Victoria bolted from the bathroom, wailing hysterically.

Evelyn stood frozen, cradling the broken pieces in her palms. Her vision blurred with unshed tears.

As Evelyn finally stepped out, the stall door at the far end creaked open unnoticed.

Victoria's dramatic escape through the corridor turned heads as auction guests dispersed. Most recoiled from the bloodied, screaming woman rather than gawk.

"Nathan! Aunt Penelope! Someone help me!" Victoria's voice trembled with calculated hysteria.

This was exactly the spotlight she craved.

Let's see you come between me and Nathan now, Evelyn, Victoria thought viciously. I'll destroy your reputation and show everyone what a jealous monster you really are!

Penelope, Margaret, and Cassandra came running at the commotion, their shrieks adding to the spectacle.

"My precious girl! Who did this to you?" Margaret's horrified reaction was Oscar-worthy.

She knew exactly what her daughter had planned - and played her part flawlessly. Though privately, Margaret marveled at Victoria's uncharacteristic pain tolerance. The girl who used to sob over paper cuts now bore a self-inflicted wound without flinching.

Just like Penelope in her youth, Margaret thought proudly. Her sister-in-law had won Leonard's heart through similar theatrics, displacing Nathan's mother. History would repeat itself tonight.

That Evelyn Carter was becoming too problematic. She needed to be removed permanently.

Victoria intensified her sobs as phones emerged to capture her performance. The perfect victim.

Then Evelyn appeared - a radiant, furious goddess cutting through the chaos.

The crowd held its breath. Evelyn's glacial beauty burned with barely contained fury, promising retribution.

Fate intervened as Nathan and Julian arrived simultaneously.

"Nathan..." Victoria whimpered pathetically, catching sight of her target.

Nathan's expression darkened at the bloody wound. He strode forward urgently.

Margaret seized the moment, giving Victoria a forceful push into Nathan's arms.

"What happened?" Nathan demanded, his voice tight with concern.

"My wrist... it hurts so much... Am I going to die?" Victoria buried her face in his chest, trembling like a wounded dove.

"Don't be ridiculous," Nathan murmured, though his lashes lowered in concern.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold with icy detachment before bursting into bitter laughter.

The stage was set for her grand performance: "Evelyn Carter Exposes the Fraud."

Unnoticed in the crowd, someone discreetly activated their camera.

Julian moved swiftly, dispatching bodyguards to clear the area. "Victoria, Nathan's here now. No one can hurt you anymore," he declared protectively.
###Chapter 72

Penelope Whitmore feigned concern, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "Victoria, darling, what on earth happened to your hand?"

Cassandra Blackwood stepped forward dramatically. "Don't be frightened, Victoria. Just tell us everything. We won't tolerate anyone mistreating you!" Her performance as Victoria's defender was almost convincing.

Victoria trembled in Nathan Blackwood's embrace, casting a venomous glance at Evelyn Carter. "I... I encountered Ms. Carter in the restroom..."

Evelyn leaned casually against the wall, arms crossed, an amused smirk playing on her lips as she watched the theatrics unfold.

Nathan's jaw tightened when he saw Evelyn's indifferent expression.

"I knew Ms. Carter disliked me," Victoria continued with practiced fragility, "so I tried greeting her first, hoping we could move past our differences... But she rejected my olive branch. Things escalated, and before I knew it..."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh aloud at the ridiculous accusation.

Nathan's frustration grew at the sound of her laughter.

"When I tried to leave," Victoria's voice quivered, "Ms. Carter grabbed my wrist violently. In the struggle, her bracelet broke when it hit the floor. She became so angry about the bracelet that she..." Victoria let the implication hang in the air.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with anger. The audacity of this woman to twist the truth so blatantly!

She laughed because the absurdity of the situation was almost comical - Victoria was actually trying to frame her for self-inflicted injuries.

"Are you saying Ms. Carter did this to you?" Penelope gasped theatrically, though she'd been the one coaching Victoria backstage.

Richard Sterling exploded with rage. "You harmed my daughter?" He jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "How dare you! If you have issues, use your words like an adult! Victoria is a concert pianist - her hands are her livelihood! If she can't perform because of this, even your connections to the Kingsley family won't protect you!"

Evelyn flinched as the words struck a nerve.

She inhaled sharply, her own broken little finger - courtesy of Nathan years ago - throbbing with phantom pain. That injury had ended her piano career permanently.

Yet here they were, blaming her for Victoria's schemes.

Who would answer for what had been taken from her?

"Wait! Hold on!" Julian Montgomery interjected urgently, alarmed by Evelyn's uncharacteristic silence under the barrage of accusations. "However tragic Ms. Sterling's story sounds, it's still just one side. Shouldn't we hear Ms. Carter's version? While there are no cameras in restrooms, perhaps other guests were present? We should look for witnesses."

Cassandra's attention immediately shifted to Julian, her mouth hanging open stupidly, momentarily forgetting her role in the drama.

Evelyn blinked in surprise at Julian's unexpected defense. She finally lifted her gaze to meet his.

Julian's heart swelled when Evelyn acknowledged him, a warm sensation spreading through his chest.

Their brief moment of silent understanding was misinterpreted by Nathan, whose hands clenched into fists at his sides.

"There were no witnesses," Evelyn stated flatly. "We were alone."

Julian frowned, realizing the difficulty of disproving Victoria's claims. "Then who else could have—"

"My daughter would never harm herself!" Margaret Sterling shrieked. "Victoria has always been terrified of pain!"

Victoria buried her face in Nathan's chest to hide her smug expression at the lack of counter-evidence.

"Nathan." Evelyn's voice was ice. "Are you seriously asking if I did this?"

Her heart sank as she waited for his response, fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms.

Julian facepalmed internally. Of all times for Nathan to finally speak up...

Nathan felt an unexpected pang seeing the hurt flash in Evelyn's eyes before she masked it.

He'd judged too quickly.

As CEO, he prided himself on impartiality - but Evelyn's public humiliation at the auction still stung, clouding his objectivity.

Evelyn took a deep breath, then smiled brilliantly. "What if I did? Planning to make me pay for it?" The challenge in her voice was unmistakable.
###Chapter 73

Nathan's breath hitched. His pulse roared in his ears like a tempest.

He stared at his ex-wife with widening eyes. How could the docile woman he'd once married transform into this venomous creature capable of such brutality?

"Evelyn... is this true?" The words scraped against his constricted throat. His obsidian gaze burned into her.

Victoria's lips curled in triumph beneath her feigned tears.

Julian Montgomery pressed a hand to his chest, utterly bewitched by Evelyn's sinister smile.

No woman had ever embodied such lethal allure - equal parts temptation and danger.

"What exactly are you implying, Nathan?"

Seeing his hesitation, Victoria unleashed hysterical sobs. "You'd believe her over me? After everything?" Her mind raced. Why did that idiot confess? No matter - my plan's working.

"Look what kind of viper you married!" Margaret Sterling shrieked, clutching her "injured" daughter. "She nearly slit Victoria's throat! This was attempted murder!"

Nathan's lashes lowered, shadowing his conflicted expression.

"You were never violent at Cliffside Manor." His voice turned gravelly. "This isn't you."

Penelope Blackwood's laugh dripped acid. "Now that the divorce is final, the mask comes off, doesn't it? Thank heavens Nathan saw through you before—"

"That's enough." Julian stepped forward, only to be halted by Evelyn's raised hand.

Cassandra Blackwood's nails bit into her palms as she watched Julian defend her former sister-in-law. The betrayal stung like salt in an open wound.

"What exactly do you want?" Evelyn's mocking tone sliced through the tension.

"Apologize. Now." Nathan's icy detachment erased three years of shared history in an instant.

Victoria barely concealed her triumph. See, you fool? Your devotion meant nothing. A single tear from me outweighs your—

CRACK!

Evelyn's palm connected with Victoria's cheek with enough force to snap her head sideways.

Gasps echoed through the room.

Nathan barely registered the movement - just a blur of motion and the whistle of displaced air.

"You— How dare—!" Victoria staggered, stars exploding behind her eyelids.

"That was for shattering Grandfather's bracelet." Evelyn's voice trembled with barely leashed fury. "Come at me next time, not precious heirlooms."

"Evelyn!" Nathan's roar shook the walls. His gaze caught on the angry red marks circling her delicate wrist - then dismissed them in his rage.

Penelope, Margaret, and Cassandra gaped at Evelyn's audacity.

Not one of them noticed the calculating glint in Evelyn's eyes as she flexed her stinging palm. This is only the beginning.
###Chapter 74

Evelyn Carter was not someone to be trifled with.

"Mark my words." Her voice was ice-cold, dripping with venom. "From this moment on, Victoria Sterling and I are sworn enemies. If I ever go back on this oath, may I be shattered—just like this bracelet."

Her fingers trembled as she slowly uncurled her palm.

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched.

Blood smeared her skin, mingling with the jagged shards of the jade bracelet she had crushed in her grip.

He knew how much she treasured that bracelet.

Yet here she was, clutching its broken remains so tightly she hadn’t even noticed the cuts.

A storm of emotions raged in his chest.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s face—twisted with fury, eyes burning with unspoken betrayal. Something inside him splintered.

"Ms. Carter! Your hand—!"

Julian Montgomery gasped, frantically patting his pockets for something—anything—to stem the bleeding.

But he came up empty.

Nathan’s fingers twitched toward the handkerchief tucked in his breast pocket. His jaw clenched.

He couldn’t bring himself to offer it.

Then, a whisper of expensive perfume drifted through the air as a woman in an emerald silk gown glided forward.

Evelyn froze.

Lillian Hartwell—her stepmother—gently pried the broken jade from Evelyn’s palm and slipped the pieces into her blazer pocket. Then, with deliberate care, she wrapped the wounds with a pristine handkerchief.

"Aunt Lillian—"

Evelyn’s voice cracked. She bit her lip hard, forcing back the words.

"Such lovely hands shouldn’t be marred like this," Lillian murmured, her tone deceptively calm.

Inside, she was seething. The Blackwood family would pay for this.

"Mrs. Kingsley! What a pleasure to see you!"

Penelope Whitmore’s syrupy voice cut through the tension as she rushed forward, all false warmth.

Jean Sterling, too, plastered on a simpering smile. "You look radiant as ever, Mrs. Kingsley!"

Most of high society believed Lillian had schemed her way into Harrison Kingsley’s bed after his first wife’s death. Few dared to slight her—especially since she was still a Larson by blood, despite cutting ties with her family.

Compared to her, Jean and Penelope were nothing.

"Mrs. Blackwood."

Lillian barely spared them a glance, offering only the barest nod of acknowledgment to Leonard Blackwood’s wife.

Jean, however, was completely ignored.

Her smile stiffened.

"Mrs. Kingsley," Penelope pressed, eyes glinting with sly curiosity, "do you know Ms. Carter well? She attended tonight’s auction as Mr. Kingsley’s guest. Quite the spender, too."

Lillian’s lips curved, though her eyes remained frosty. "Of course I know her. Sebastian invited her."

A calculated pause.

"Then you must not be too familiar with her, right?"

"Do I need to be?"

Penelope’s smile sharpened. "I’d say so. After all, Ms. Carter is about to become the wife of Monarch Group’s CEO. She’ll practically be family soon."

Lillian’s eyebrow arched. "Oh? Is Evelyn involved with Sebastian?"

"Indeed." Penelope’s gaze flicked to Evelyn, dripping with faux concern. "When she divorced Nathan, she left in Mr. Kingsley’s car. Poor thing—a country girl with no connections in Crestview. Who would’ve thought Mr. Kingsley would take her under his wing?"

The air around Lillian turned glacial.

Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around Evelyn’s wrist.
###Chapter 75

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable.

She knew exactly how venomous and manipulative Penelope could be. The insinuation was clear—Evelyn was nothing more than a gold-digging divorcee from the countryside, preying on wealthy men.

Victoria, Penelope, and Cassandra exchanged smug glances.

The Kingsleys and the Blackwoods had always been at odds. As the eldest son of Harrison Kingsley, Sebastian held immense social standing. He could have any woman he desired. Why would he ever settle for Nathan Blackwood’s discarded ex-wife?

It would only make him a laughingstock.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his striking eyes darkening with barely restrained fury. "Aunt Penelope, this is my personal matter. You have no right to comment."

"Nathan, while this may be personal, it affects the reputations of both our families. I’m merely informing Mrs. Kingsley so she isn’t blindsided later. I’m only looking out for everyone’s best interests!" Penelope’s words dripped with false concern.

"Our families’ reputations?" Lillian arched a brow, her voice icy. "Didn’t Ms. Carter divorce Mr. Blackwood? That means she has no further ties to your family. Mrs. Blackwood, why do you still believe her actions reflect on yours?"

She smirked, her tone cutting. "Or did she sign her life away to the Blackwoods upon marriage? Is she eternally bound to your family? If Ms. Carter and Sebastian are compatible, there’s nothing scandalous about their relationship. Do you truly believe the Kingsleys would reject her simply because she’s divorced? What century are we living in? Mrs. Blackwood, you should broaden your perspective."

Julian couldn’t help but clap, thoroughly enjoying Lillian’s ruthless dismantling of Penelope’s theatrics.

Margaret, Victoria, and Cassandra stood frozen, their faces burning with humiliation.

They had underestimated Lillian’s fierce protectiveness over Evelyn.

"Mrs. Kingsley, as a woman of high society, surely you understand my concerns?" Penelope pressed, desperation creeping into her voice. "Ms. Carter moved on to Mr. Kingsley immediately after her divorce. If word spreads, people will assume she was involved with him while still married to Nathan. That’s disgraceful. As the matriarch of the Kingsley family, shouldn’t you safeguard your children’s futures?"

"Enough."

Lillian raised a slender hand, her elegance effortlessly eclipsing Penelope’s crassness. "This is between the young ones. While I may be an elder, I am not Sebastian’s mother—I have no right to interfere. Mrs. Blackwood, you aren’t Nathan’s birth mother either, are you? Isn’t this conversation beneath you?"

Penelope’s mouth snapped shut, her face draining of color.

"Furthermore," Lillian continued, her voice sharp as steel, "Harrison is my partner, but I am not the matriarch of the Kingsley family. I won’t tolerate such remarks again."

Evelyn bit her lip, her nose stinging with suppressed emotion.

There was only one true matriarch of the Kingsley family—her mother.

Nathan’s lips thinned, his cold gaze flickering with something unreadable.

He had never loved Evelyn. Their marriage had been in name only, fraught with tension and resentment.

Yet, hearing Penelope’s cruel jabs felt like a direct attack on his pride.

"Ms. Carter, were you looking for Sebastian? I’ll take you to him." Lillian’s voice softened as she turned to Evelyn.

"Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley. I appreciate your kindness." Evelyn smiled, every inch the poised lady.

"Such grace and beauty."

Lillian took Evelyn’s hand, her touch warm. Deliberately loud, she added, "Sebastian has impeccable taste in choosing you."
###Chapter 76

"Wait!" Nathan's commanding voice cut through the tension.

Hearing Evelyn's words, an unfamiliar rage surged through Nathan's veins. His voice remained deceptively calm as he spoke. "Ms. Carter, don't you owe me an apology?"

Julian Montgomery sighed heavily, resisting the urge to physically silence his friend.

Evelyn felt a sharp pang in her chest. She turned to face Nathan with icy detachment.

Nathan felt as though her piercing, disappointed gaze had sliced through his very soul.

"It wasn't Evelyn! It wasn't her!"

A gentle, melodic voice suddenly rang out, startling everyone present.

Evelyn's eyes brightened instantly at the familiar sound.

"Eleanor!"

A delicate girl in a simple white dress came rushing toward them, her distinctive cauliflower hairstyle bouncing with each step. The fair-skinned young woman's face was a picture of innocence.

This ridiculous hairstyle was Cassandra's handiwork.

In the Blackwood household, Cassandra had always viewed her younger sister as competition.

Consumed by jealousy over Eleanor's natural beauty, Cassandra took every opportunity to humiliate her. Whenever they appeared together in public, Cassandra would deliberately sabotage Eleanor's appearance, terrified of being overshadowed.

Eleanor, being autistic, had grown increasingly withdrawn over the years. Around strangers, she would typically hunch her shoulders and retreat into silence.

During Evelyn's three-year marriage to Nathan, she and the housekeeper Agnes had been the only ones to show kindness to this neglected sister.

Since leaving the Blackwood family, Evelyn had often thought about Eleanor.

Never did she imagine their reunion would happen under these circumstances.

"Foolish girl! What nonsense are you spouting?" Cassandra snapped at her sister with venom. "Besides Victoria, Evelyn was the only one in that bathroom. If she didn't do it, who did?"

"No! Not Evelyn! Not Evelyn!" Eleanor stammered anxiously, her hands trembling.

"Eleanor, stay out of this. Go play by yourself!" Penelope Whitmore glared at her youngest daughter with disapproval.

Clenching her small fists, Eleanor nervously approached her half-brother. "Nathan! Evelyn didn't do it!"

"Why do you say that, Eleanor?" Nathan's tone softened remarkably when speaking to his fragile sister.

"I saw it! I-I was in the bathroom too! I saw everything!"

Gasps filled the room. Victoria's face drained of color.

Evelyn stood frozen, shocked that Eleanor had witnessed her confrontation with Victoria.

"I saw Ms. Sterling come to argue with Evelyn... Evelyn tried to leave but Ms. Sterling wouldn't let her go..." Eleanor gestured wildly as she spoke, tears forming in her large eyes. "Ms. Sterling grabbed Evelyn's wrist and took her bracelet... Then she broke it herself... Then she ran out screaming... But Evelyn never touched her! I saw everything!"

"Eleanor..." Evelyn's voice caught in her throat, her eyes burning with unshed tears.

She knew how terrified Eleanor was of crowds and confrontation. Yet here she was, bravely standing up for Evelyn's innocence before everyone.
###Chapter 77

Nathan's stormy gaze darkened as it locked onto Victoria's ashen face, his jaw tightening with barely restrained fury.

He released her wrist with deliberate slowness.

Victoria gasped like a shipwreck survivor watching her lifeboat drift away. Ignoring the throbbing pain in her injured wrist, she desperately clung to Nathan's waist. "No, Nathan! Evelyn started it! I swear I didn't provoke her! Eleanor's always been unstable - don't believe her twisted version!"

"Unstable?" Julian Montgomery scoffed, running a hand through his tousled hair. "The only thing unstable here is your story." Though he held back harsher words for Nathan's sake, his disdain was palpable.

Even the usually carefree Julian couldn't hide his contempt for Victoria's manipulations, while Nathan remained blindly devoted to this scheming woman.

"Did Evelyn hurt you?" Nathan's voice came out strained, his chest rising and falling rapidly.

Under Eleanor's watchful gaze, Victoria couldn't maintain her lies. Cold sweat dotted her forehead as she stammered, "So you falsely accused Evelyn?"

Nathan felt like a thousand knives had pierced his heart simultaneously.

"No, that's not what-"

Victoria's entire body trembled violently before her eyes rolled back. The combination of blood loss and overwhelming panic sent her collapsing into unconsciousness.

The dramatic scene ended abruptly with Victoria being stretchered into a waiting ambulance.

When Theodore arrived breathlessly at the scene, Evelyn was already walking toward the underground parking garage with Lillian.

"Ms. Carter! I'm so sorry I wasn't here when this happened." Theodore's eyes widened at the bloodstained handkerchief clutched in Evelyn's hand. "You're hurt? Who did this? I'll skin them alive!"

"It's nothing, Theo," Evelyn reassured him with a tired smile. "I know you were handling Monarch Group affairs. Just a minor incident."

She turned gratefully to Lillian. "Aunt Lillian helped resolve everything."

"I barely did anything," Lillian demurred, though her eyes burned with residual anger. "As family, I should have protected you better."

Remembering how the Blackwoods had ganged up on Evelyn, Lillian's hands clenched into fists. "Evelyn, why didn't you reveal your true identity? Make them regret ever crossing a Kingsley!"

Evelyn shook her head gently. "Aunt Lillian, I've left that life behind. Whatever filth, cruelty, or hatred exists in Evelyn Carter's past, it stays buried. I'm Evelyn Kingsley now - Nathan and his family have no place in my world."

Theodore's jaw dropped as he realized Lillian knew about Evelyn's previous marriage.

"Exactly. There's no point dwelling on the past," Lillian agreed, though her lips pressed into a thin line. "Thank heavens Sophia wasn't here today. That woman would have started World War III over this."

"Aunt Sophia does have rather... explosive reactions," Evelyn conceded with a faint smile.

The two Kingsley women shared a quiet laugh before Lillian suddenly pulled Evelyn into a fierce embrace, her shoulders shaking with suppressed sobs.

"It's not fair," Lillian whispered hoarsely. "After everything you endured..."

"I'm alright," Evelyn murmured, blinking back her own tears as she comforted her stepmother. "With all of you standing beside me, I don't feel wronged at all."
###Chapter 78

Victoria Sterling was moved to a standard hospital room after being discharged from the emergency ward.

The physician confirmed her condition was stable. While the laceration wasn't insignificant, it fortunately didn't require sutures.

Her collapse had been primarily caused by extreme psychological distress.

"Victoria! Thank heavens you're conscious!"

Margaret Sterling sobbed hysterically at the bedside, behaving as though her daughter had narrowly escaped death. "I thought I'd lost you forever!"

"Enough. Cease this melodrama." Penelope Whitmore stood near the window with crossed arms, her expression dripping with disdain. "Nathan isn't present to witness your performance. Must you shatter my eardrums with this nonsense?"

"Have you formulated a strategy to manage this debacle?" Penelope demanded.

"What debacle?" Margaret wiped her tears, confusion etching her features.

Penelope scoffed derisively. "Are you truly this incompetent?"

Her lip curled as she regarded her foolish sister with contempt. "Useless, the lot of you! I've expended considerable effort elevating your status. Without my intervention, would your daughter have ever secured Nathan's attention? Did you imagine your dimwitted family could arrange such an advantageous marriage unaided? Delusional!"

Victoria suppressed her simmering resentment. She too blamed her mother's carelessness.

To supplement the Sterling family finances, Margaret had sold the necklace Nathan gifted Victoria. Had she retained the jewelry, it wouldn't have surfaced at the pawnshop, nor been auctioned by the Kingsleys. This incident had severely damaged Victoria's relationship with Nathan.

"Aunt Penelope, you share responsibility for this!"

Having endured Penelope's condescension since childhood, Margaret finally snapped under the humiliation of being berated before her daughter. "Victoria and I were making excellent progress earlier. We'd nearly crushed that country mouse Evelyn, until your youngest daughter interfered at the critical moment! If Eleanor hadn't intervened, we wouldn't be in this predicament!"

"How was I to anticipate Eleanor's presence in the restroom?" Penelope's eyes flashed dangerously. "I trained you better than this, Victoria. How could you be so reckless? Failing to notice an observer is inexcusable!"

Penelope seethed with anger. Though partially culpable herself, she redirected all blame onto Victoria's carelessness.

Victoria pursed her lips in sullen silence.

"Regardless, it's a matter of conflicting accounts without evidence." Penelope massaged her temples, her voice icy. "Victoria, if Nathan inquires, play ignorant. His affection for you should suffice to dismiss this incident."

She added ominously, "Should that prove insufficient... I possess methods to ensure his forgiveness."

"Thank you, Aunt Penelope."

Victoria's thoughts turned to how Lillian Hartwell had shielded Evelyn earlier. Jealousy contorted her features. "Does Evelyn share a child with Sebastian? Is that why the Kingsleys favor her so? The way Mrs. Kingsley protected her—one would think Evelyn was her biological daughter! If this continues, that peasant will surpass us all!"

Penelope's expression darkened at the mention of Lillian.

"Lillian is merely a concubine. I address her formally out of courtesy, yet she dares disrespect me!"

"Indeed! Aunt Penelope, you're Leonard's lawful wife. How could Lillian compare?" Victoria flattered obsequiously, needing to maintain Penelope's favor to secure her position in the Blackwood family.

Margaret suppressed a sneer. How dare this mistress label others as such? Had Nathan's birth mother not been naive enough to fall for Penelope's schemes, she'd never have married into the Blackwood dynasty!

"I won't permit Evelyn's social climbing through the Kingsleys." Penelope's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Lillian's influence means nothing unless Harrison Kingsley acknowledges it. Leonard mentioned Harrison prioritizes family reputation above all. As his heir, Sebastian would never be permitted to wed some provincial nobody. We have time. Let the wretch enjoy temporary respite before I reduce her to tears."

The ward door burst open as Penelope concluded her venomous declaration.

An arctic chill permeated the room as Nathan's imposing figure filled the doorway.

"Nathan!" Victoria adopted a pitiful expression, her fingers tightening around the bedsheets as she shot Penelope a desperate glance.

"I require clarification on certain matters." Nathan's voice held no quarter.

"Nathan, Victoria just regained consciousness from severe stress. Whatever you wish to discuss can surely wait until—" Penelope began placatingly.

"Some questions demand immediate answers." Nathan remained implacable, his sculpted lips forming a forbidding line.
###Chapter 79

"Mr. Blackwood, it's all my fault! I'm a terrible mother!"

Margaret Sterling rushed forward, her face twisted in remorse. She had decided it was better to take the blame herself rather than let Nathan interrogate them directly. The last thing she wanted was for this scandal to ruin her daughter's chances of marrying into the Blackwood family.

She dropped to her knees before Nathan, her voice trembling. "Our family is in crisis. Investments have dried up, factories are shutting down one after another... When the Kingsleys refused to help, we were desperate. My husband and I sold some valuables to stay afloat. I took Victoria's jewelry—she had no idea! If I'd known that necklace was your token of love for her, I would have starved before selling it!"

Victoria let out a shaky breath, her eyes welling with crocodile tears. "Mother... how could you? That was my favorite piece..."

Nathan's expression remained icy. His voice was low, dangerous. "That's not what I'm asking about."

The necklace meant nothing compared to Victoria framing Evelyn.

Yes, it stung to see his gift discarded so carelessly. But he could understand—if she had done it to save her family.

What he couldn't forgive was her dragging an innocent woman into her schemes.

"Did you cut your own wrist?" His gaze darkened. "Or did Evelyn do it? Did you accidentally break her bracelet—or did you rip it off deliberately?"

"Nathan!" Victoria sobbed dramatically. "Are you calling me a liar? After all these years by your side, am I really worth less than your ex-wife, who deceived you?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Eleanor doesn’t lie. She said she never saw Evelyn touch you."

"Eleanor isn’t well," Penelope interjected quickly. "You know she hides in corners—how could she have seen everything clearly?"

Nathan smirked coldly. "Do mothers usually hurt their own daughters in front of others? I wouldn’t know—I never had one."

Penelope paled.

This bastard just insulted me to my face!

"Victoria," Nathan continued, his voice heavy with disappointment, "why do this? I chose you. I won’t go back to Evelyn. So why keep tormenting her?"

His chest ached. The weight of his disillusionment pressed down like chains.

For twenty years, Victoria had been his light—the one good thing in his wretched childhood.

Now, he feared that light was nothing but an illusion.

"I didn’t do anything!" Victoria shrieked, slamming her fists against the hospital bed. Her usually delicate face twisted with rage. "She stole you from me! Now she’s turning you against me! Cassandra told me Evelyn and Eleanor have been close ever since she stayed at Cliffside Manor. They’re conspiring to ruin me! Nathan, do you believe them over me? Have you fallen for her? Do you even want me anymore?"

"I’ve always been yours," Nathan said through gritted teeth. "Even during my marriage to Evelyn, I never touched her. My heart was always with you."

But his mind flashed to Evelyn—how she had taken the blame without hesitation, the red marks on her wrist, the way she had looked at him with tear-filled eyes full of betrayal.

A sharp pain lanced through his skull, blurring his vision. "But Victoria... I don’t recognize you anymore. Are you trying to push me toward her?"

"No! That’s not—"

Before she could finish, Nathan turned and walked out.

Victoria scrambled out of bed, her face white with panic. She lunged for the door—

SLAM.

The heavy door shut in her face, leaving her trembling in the cold draft.

Her scarlet eyes burned with fury. She kicked the door hard—then yelped in pain, hopping on one foot.

"Evelyn Carter!" she snarled. "You’ll regret crossing me. I’ll make sure you suffer!"
###Chapter 80

VELVET was an exclusive high-end club owned by Julian Montgomery.

That evening, Nathan Blackwood felt unusually melancholic. For the first time in months, he reached out to Julian for drinks.

Julian personally drove to pick him up. Since childhood, Nathan had rarely initiated their hangouts.

"Sometimes I feel like your secret lover," Julian whispered into Nathan's ear. To the world, he was an untouchable business tycoon, but around Nathan, he became a chatty companion.

"I've never been this way with women, yet with you..." Julian sighed dramatically. "I drop everything when you call. What an excellent friend I am! I'm moved by my own devotion!"

Nathan gave him an icy glare. "You're quite clingy with Evelyn too."

"Well, she's exceptional! Any man would be captivated." Julian grinned.

Nathan's eyebrow twitched. He pressed his lips together, resisting the urge to curse.

Just then, two stunning women walked by, one boldly winking at Julian.

Julian licked his teeth appreciatively. "Not as alluring as her though."

"Who? Your ex-wife?" Nathan deadpanned.

Julian's eyes nearly popped out. "Damn! Nathan Blackwood, are you telling me you're no longer a virgin? I thought yours was just a contractual marriage with Evelyn! Typical man - all lies!" He smirked. "Though with a beauty like Evelyn by your side, I'd be surprised if you remained chaste."

Nathan stiffened, gripping his whiskey glass tightly.

For a fleeting moment, it felt like he'd actually seen Evelyn's naked form, touched her intimately.

"I never laid a hand on her," Nathan growled, cheeks warming. He took another gulp of alcohol.

Damn it! Why was he having such inappropriate thoughts about that woman?

After several rounds, Julian grew serious. "Nathan, there's something I've always wondered."

"What?"

"Why Victoria Sterling?"

Julian slung an arm around Nathan's shoulders. "Today proved how vicious those women were toward Evelyn! Had Cassandra not testified, Evelyn would've taken the blame. Doesn't that bother you?"

Nathan's gaze grew distant, lost in memories.

"My mother jumped to her death," he revealed hoarsely. "Depression from my father's neglect and society's cruelty. Those were my darkest days." He unclasped his platinum watch, exposing a long, jagged scar. "I tried following her."

Julian inhaled sharply, heart aching. This was Nathan's most guarded secret, shared for the first time in twenty years.

"Victoria found me in time," Nathan continued. "She became my only light - bringing homemade treats, inviting me over, sharing her toys. I promised to marry her someday. That vow stands."

Julian finally understood Nathan's obsession. "But people change, Nathan. The Victoria you knew might not exist anymore. Must you honor a childhood promise if she's become someone unrecognizable? Gratitude shouldn't blind you to morality."

Nathan fastened his watch, expression darkening.

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes flashed in his mind - so clear, so painfully honest. His chest constricted, but he simply drank deeper.

"You're impossibly stubborn," Julian sighed. "I suppose the only woman who matters more than Victoria is that little sparrow you've been searching for, yes?"

Nathan's entire demeanor shifted at the mention. "Have you found her?"

"Like you, I've had investigators searching. But your clues are too vague - you never even saw her face properly. It's like finding a needle in a haystack." Julian shrugged.

Nathan's hope dimmed. Five years of searching for the slender girl who'd dragged him across the Eldermere battlefield to safety.

"Will I ever see her again?" he murmured.

"If you do, how would you treat her?"

"Repay her, of course. She saved my life."

Julian smirked. "What if she wants your heart too? Would you pledge yourself to this mystery woman like you did Victoria?"

"Gratitude isn't love," Nathan stated firmly. "They shouldn't be confused."

"Ah, so you do understand that distinction." Julian's tone held subtle mockery as he clinked their glasses.

Later, their chauffeurs waited outside VELVET with luxury cars. Just before parting, Nathan voiced the question burning all night.

"Julian... why wouldn't Evelyn defend herself if she's innocent? Why take the blame?"

Julian yawned. "Maybe she just doesn't care anymore."

"About what?"

"You're divorced. Why would she care what you or your family think? After how you treated her, if I were Evelyn, I'd have hired someone to break your legs."

With that, Julian disappeared into his car.

Nathan's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. An invisible noose seemed to tighten around his throat, stealing his breath.
###Chapter 81

The moment Evelyn returned from the charity gala, she locked herself in her bedroom and refused to come out. This was highly unusual behavior for the normally composed heiress.

By nightfall, Sebastian and Dominic had arrived at Cliffside Manor to check on their sister. Though Evelyn eventually descended to greet them, her exhaustion was palpable beneath the dim chandelier light.

"Evelyn, we heard what happened at the auction." Sebastian moved swiftly to take his sister's bandaged hand, his fingers tracing the gauze with visible distress. "How's the injury? Did Nathan ensure you received proper medical attention? Is there any infection? Tell me everything."

"I studied emergency medicine at Oxford, Sebastian. I can handle a simple wound." Evelyn withdrew her hand with a tired sigh. "Nathan has enough responsibilities without worrying about such trivial matters."

Dominic's jaw tightened as he paced before the fireplace. "This is unacceptable! If we hadn't run into Aunt Lillian at the estate, we'd never have known those Blackwood vipers attacked you! I'm filing injunctions against Blackwood Industries first thing tomorrow. Sebastian, alert Monarch Group's legal team - we're suing those harpies for defamation and assault!"

"Please, don't." Evelyn leaned weakly against her eldest brother's shoulder, her voice barely above a whisper. "Do you think Blackwood Industries lacks legal counsel? If this escalates, Father will hear of it... and I can't risk that."

Her greatest fear was Harrison discovering the truth about her and Nathan. While her father would never raise a hand to her, the shock might trigger another heart episode. Despite his formidable exterior, Harrison remained a man in his seventies. Evelyn refused to be the cause of his distress.

Yet she wouldn't let Victoria's transgression go unanswered.

Evelyn's fingers brushed the bandage as she remembered the two painstaking days spent repairing the jade bracelet. Fresh tears threatened to spill.

"Donovan is frantic with worry," Sebastian murmured, stroking his sister's raven hair. "He's petitioning for emergency leave from his deployment. And Maxwell..." He checked his platinum watch. "He should be landing at Crestview Airfield within the hour."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed with alarm. "It's merely a scratch! How could you trouble them with this? They hold critical positions with national security implications!" She snatched her phone from the velvet settee and fired off a furious voice message to the Kingsley Intelligence Network group chat.

"If anyone dares return home now, I won't speak to them for an entire year!"

Donovan's reply appeared instantly: [Evie, my leave's already approved.]

"Then unapprove it!" Evelyn's fingers flew across the screen. "Return to your post or I'll formally disown you as my brother! Test me!"

Maxwell remained ominously silent.

Dominic smirked, pointing upward. "I doubt you can stop our human missile. He's probably mid-air right now."

Evelyn pressed her palms to her temples. Maxwell had always been the silent storm among her brothers - unpredictable, intensely private, yet fiercely protective. If present, he'd smother her with attention more than all the others combined.

"Fine! I'll simply pretend he's invisible!" Evelyn huffed, toying with Sebastian's sapphire cufflinks. "Sebastian, could you take me to Fairhaven tomorrow? I need to visit Celestial Atelier."

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Manor...

Eleanor's courageous testimony in Evelyn's defense had ignited a firestorm. The timid girl now found herself trapped in a gilded cage with three furious vipers.

"You stupid, ungrateful child!" Cassandra Blackwood stormed into Eleanor's pastel-hued bedroom, reeking of gin and malice. "Did that Kingsley witch bribe you? Are you her little spy?"

Eleanor shrank against her canopy bed, clutching the limited-edition Regarton teddy bear Evelyn had queued six hours in the rain to procure. "N-no lies... I told truth... Annie nice... You mean!"

Cassandra's perfectly contoured face twisted. "How dare you speak to me like that!" She seized Eleanor's freshly curled hair with talon-like nails. "Who permitted this perm? You know my rules!"

The real source of Cassandra's rage wasn't Victoria's humiliation - it was Julian Montgomery's unexpected attention toward Eleanor after the auction. Seeing Crestview's most eligible bachelor tousle her sister's hair and smile had ignited a jealousy so violent, Cassandra fantasized about shaving Eleanor bald.

"You scheming little bitch!" Cassandra yanked harder, eliciting whimpers. "This wasn't about helping that peasant! You're trying to seduce Julian, aren't you? Playing the innocent to steal what's mine!"
###Chapter 82

Eleanor's sapphire eyes brimmed with tears, her small frame shaking with suppressed sobs.

"You're just doing this to spite us!" Cassandra's porcelain features twisted in fury. "We all despise Evelyn, yet you insist on defending her. Is this your pathetic attempt to prove you're special?"

Her manicured nails dug into the armrest as she leaned closer. "Stop embarrassing yourself! Julian would never look twice at someone like you!"

"Miss Cassandra!" Agnes rushed forward, wrapping protective arms around the weeping child. "This has gone far enough!"

The staff at Cliffside Manor had become numb to these scenes, none daring to intervene against the Blackwood heiress.

Only Agnes, having served Nathan since childhood, possessed the courage to stand between the sisters.

"Get out, you meddling old woman!" Cassandra's voice cracked with rage. "This doesn't concern you!"

"I suggest you leave immediately." Agnes fixed Cassandra with a steely gaze while comforting the trembling Eleanor. "Walk away now, and I'll forget what happened here. Otherwise, Master Nathan will hear every detail of how you've treated your sister today."

Cassandra's perfectly contoured face paled. Her manicured fingers twitched.

If Nathan discovered her true nature, he'd undoubtedly tell Julian. His interference would ruin everything.

With a frustrated growl, Cassandra snatched the stuffed rabbit from Eleanor's arms and hurled it through the open French windows.

"No! Mr. Flopsy!" Eleanor's wail shattered the tense silence.

"That hideous thing was polluting my airspace." Cassandra flipped her chestnut waves with practiced nonchalance. "Consider it an improvement."

The child didn't hesitate, bolting barefoot across the marble floors toward the gardens just as Nathan's sports car purred up the driveway.

"Eleanor?" Nathan caught the distraught girl by her shoulders, his designer suit wrinkling under her desperate grip. "What's wrong?"

"Mr. Flopsy... he's gone!" Tears and mucus streaked her flushed cheeks. "Cassie threw him away!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Without hesitation, he led the sobbing child toward the rose gardens.

There, nestled among thorny stems and damp soil, lay the mud-caked stuffed animal.

The fastidious billionaire didn't hesitate, ruining his Italian loafers as he retrieved the ruined toy.

Eleanor clutched the filthy rabbit to her chest like lost treasure, her tears creating clean streaks down its matted fur.

Nathan's usually impassive expression softened. "It's ruined, sweetheart. I'll buy you a dozen new ones tomorrow."

"No!" Eleanor's grip tightened. "Evelyn gave me Mr. Flopsy! He's special!"

Nathan's breath hitched. He hadn't realized how deeply his ex-wife had touched the fragile child.

Memories of Evelyn's kindness overwhelmed Eleanor. Without her, each day in the opulent prison of Cliffside Manor grew heavier. Her father's indifference, her mother's neglect, Cassandra's cruelty.

"Nathan!" The child launched herself into his arms, dampening his shirt with tears. "Please bring Evelyn back! I miss her so much! Can't you be together again?"

His throat constricted. The familiar ache returned.

Gently stroking her hair, he remained silent. Some truths were too cruel for her innocent heart.

The buzzing of his phone provided temporary reprieve.

Reginald's name flashed on the screen.

"Grandfather."

"Why isn't Evelyn answering my calls?" The elderly man's voice trembled with barely contained panic. "What have you done now, you foolish boy? If she's avoiding me because of you, I'll strike you from the will!"

Nathan massaged his temples. "She wouldn't abandon you, Grandfather. Don't—"

"Find her immediately!" Reginald's voice cracked. "I need to see my favorite granddaughter! Move your useless backside and bring her to me!"
###Chapter 83

The moon hung low over Fairhaven as Evelyn, Sebastian, and Dominic left Crestview behind. The sleek black car glided smoothly along the highway, its tinted windows reflecting the city lights fading in the distance.

Crestview might be the economic powerhouse of the country, but Fairhaven had its own unique charm. For generations, this city had belonged to one family alone - the Kingsleys.

Harrison Kingsley wasn't just a businessman here; he was the lifeblood of Fairhaven. The Monarch Group provided jobs for nearly forty percent of the city's population. Without the Kingsleys, Fairhaven would be just another provincial town struggling to keep up.

Their destination was the renowned Celestial Atelier, its ancient stone facade glowing softly under antique lanterns.

"Miss Evelyn! When did you return?" Walter Grayson, the atelier's manager in his late sixties, rushed to greet them with visible excitement. His eyes crinkled at the corners as he took in the sight of Evelyn.

Walter was practically family - the youngest son of Harrison's childhood nanny. While others in the Kingsley orbit chased wealth and status, Walter preferred the quiet company of gemstones in this peaceful retreat.

"Uncle Walter, how's your arthritis? Did the special tea blend I sent help with your breathing?" Evelyn linked her arm through his affectionately, her smile warm enough to melt glaciers.

"Everything's perfect now that you're home!" Walter blinked back sudden moisture in his eyes before clearing his throat. "What brings you here at this hour?"

Evelyn's expression turned serious as she withdrew a velvet pouch from her bag. "I need your expertise. A dear friend gave me this, and I... well, I broke it. I'd like to recreate it before they notice."

When the fragments of the jade bracelet tumbled into Walter's palm, his professional eye immediately recognized the quality. "This is imperial jade! Such a rare find... what a tragedy to see it like this."

"I know its value," Evelyn said quietly. "That's why I need your best stones. How many unopened jadeites do you have in stock?"

"About six hundred," Walter answered automatically before his brain caught up. "Wait - you're not thinking of-"

"Let's open them all tonight."

Walter staggered as if physically struck. Behind Evelyn, Sebastian choked on his tea while Dominic fumbled for his phone, ready to call paramedics for the older man.

Only Evelyn remained perfectly composed, as though suggesting they sacrifice half a million dollars worth of stones was as mundane as ordering takeout.

"Have you lost your mind?" Walter clutched his chest. "This isn't some parlor game, Evelyn!"

"You've always said these stones are your passion, not your livelihood," Evelyn countered smoothly. "Name your price. Actually..." A mischievous glint entered her eyes, "Charge it to Maxwell's account. Double the usual rate. Heaven knows he has money to burn."

Walter collapsed into a chair, fanning himself dramatically while the Kingsley brothers rushed to his side.

The Celestial Atelier occupied one of four legendary estates in Fairhaven - Starlight Manor, Cloud Haven, Mistwood, and the crown jewel, Celestial Gardens. The latter had been acquired in a legendary transaction where Harrison outmaneuvered the famous gemologist Edmund Fairchild, nearly costing Walter his apprenticeship in the process.

Only later did everyone learn Harrison had secretly purchased the estate as a birthday surprise for Edmund all along. Now, as Edmund's sole protégé, Walter maintained the atelier with the same devotion his mentor had shown.

While Evelyn followed Walter to inspect the raw stones, her brothers remained in the opulent tearoom.

"She's too invested in the Blackwoods," Dominic grumbled, swirling his tea. "It's unnatural."

Sebastian set down his cup with deliberate calm. "Reginald Blackwood showed Evelyn genuine kindness when she needed it most. You know how she repays loyalty."

"Even if it means cozying up to that bastard Nathan again?" Dominic's knuckles whitened around his cup.

"Fate has a twisted sense of humor," Sebastian murmured. "The more we oppose it, the more determined she becomes to prove us wrong."

Dominic scoffed. "Our sister could have any man in the world - royalty, billionaires, geniuses - and she picks the one who shattered her heart."

"Perhaps that's for the best," Sebastian mused. "After surviving Nathan Blackwood, no ordinary playboy could ever deceive her again."

The vibration of Sebastian's phone against the marble tabletop interrupted their conversation. The screen illuminated with a name that made both brothers tense - Alexander Whitmore.
###Chapter 84

Sebastian glanced down at his phone screen, seeing Nathan Blackwood's name flashing.

"Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian answered in an icy tone that could freeze hell over.

Dominic immediately perked up from his chair, moving closer to eavesdrop on the conversation.

"Mr. Kingsley, I need to speak with Evelyn. It's urgent." Nathan's voice carried an undercurrent of barely restrained desperation.

"Evelyn is otherwise occupied."

"Then when will she be available?"

"For you?" Sebastian's lips curled into a mirthless smile. "Never."

Though usually the epitome of diplomacy, when Sebastian decided to cut someone down, he did it with surgical precision.

Dominic pumped his fist in silent celebration. That's my brother!

On the other end, Nathan felt the verbal blow land like a physical punch. His expression darkened.

"Since Evelyn changed her number, she's made her wishes clear. Even if the divorce isn't finalized, any decent man would respect that boundary." Sebastian's voice turned dangerous. "And I know exactly what happened at the charity gala."

Nathan's breath hitched as if barbed wire had suddenly coiled around his lungs.

Dominic actually shivered at his brother's tone shift.

That was Sebastian Kingsley in a nutshell - angelic one moment, demonic the next. Most things weren't worth his anger. But family? That was his red line.

"About that incident—"

"I don't care about your boundaries, Blackwood, but you've crossed mine." Sebastian's words were razor blades, his gaze burning with protective fury. "Evelyn is my non-negotiable line. This is the first and last time I'll take your call. Consider this your only warning - control your fiancée and your family. If they harass Evelyn again, there will be consequences you can't imagine."

The call ended with finality that echoed through Cliffside Manor's study.

Nathan stood frozen before the floor-to-ceiling windows, staring at the blackened screen. His grip on the phone turned white-knuckled as an invisible hand seemed to squeeze his heart.

Sebastian had been his last tenuous connection to Evelyn. With that severed, a yawning emptiness threatened to swallow him whole. For the first time in his meticulously controlled life, panic clawed at his throat.

This time, Evelyn might vanish from his world completely.

He might never see her again.

The thought sent such acute pain through his chest that Nathan fumbled open his desk drawer with uncharacteristically shaky hands. From its depths, he retrieved a nearly empty cigarette case - only two remained.

It took three attempts before he could light one, the flame trembling between his fingers. The ember glowed like a dying star as he inhaled deeply.

How pathetic, he thought bitterly. Five years of sobriety broken because of the wife he'd convinced himself he never loved.

Meanwhile, in the pre-dawn hours, Evelyn moved like a ghost through Celestial Atelier's cavernous workshop. Dressed in a black apron smeared with stone dust, she moved between piles of raw jade with single-minded focus. Sweat dotted her forehead despite the cool air.

She'd cut open hundreds of stones, painstakingly shaping them into bracelet blanks. Any one could fetch five figures at auction, yet to her they were worthless.

None possessed that elusive quality.

None could compare to the bracelet Reginald had gifted her.

Evelyn's eyes burned from exhaustion and unshed tears as she polished another piece. Her once-pristine fingers were now calloused and raw, the wound on her palm throbbing in protest. She ignored it all.

She had to recreate that perfect bracelet. Otherwise, how could she ever face Reginald again?

A sudden thunderous roar shook the warehouse's steel doors, but Evelyn didn't even glance up. Her entire world had narrowed to the jade beneath her fingers.

Then the doors burst open with enough force to make the hanging lights sway. A helicopter's blinding searchlight cut through the darkness outside, its rotor wash sending papers flying.

The hatch lowered to reveal a pair of long legs in custom Italian boots. A black trench coat billowed dramatically around a frame she'd know anywhere. That impossibly handsome face broke into a radiant smile.

"Evelyn! Did you miss me?"
###Chapter 85

Evelyn Carter lifted her tear-filled almond eyes to gaze at the striking man before her.

The man took long strides forward before dropping to one knee. His chiseled features tilted upward with undisguised adoration.

"Rumor has it you're trying to disown me." His lips curved into that familiar roguish smile that always made her heart flutter.

"Maxwell..." Evelyn's rosebud lips trembled as she whispered his name.

"Thank God you still remember what to call me." His shoulders visibly relaxed with relief.

Maxwell Kingsley, the fourth son of Harrison Kingsley, was known for his brooding intensity. Yet whenever Evelyn was near, his obsidian eyes would sparkle with rare warmth.

In one fluid motion, he wrapped an arm around her slender waist while fishing something from his trench coat pocket. With practiced ease, he tore open a chocolate wrapper with his teeth and offered it to her.

"Ankora's finest - your favorite."

"Max!"

Evelyn buried her face against his broad chest as emotions overwhelmed her. Hot tears soaked through his crisp cotton shirt.

The floodgates opened for countless reasons - the bittersweet reunion with her long-absent brother, guilt over breaking Reginald's bracelet, seething hatred toward Victoria Sterling, and frustration at being unable to recreate the jade bracelet.

But mostly, she wept for the gaping wound Nathan Blackwood had left in her heart.

"Little star, are those tears?" Maxwell's voice held rare concern as he gently massaged the nape of her neck.

"No." She stubbornly shook her head.

"My shirt's drenched and you're still denying it?"

"I said no!"

Her voice cracked despite her defiance. Evelyn had always been fiercely proud - in their entire childhood, Maxwell could count her tears on one hand.

Understanding her pride, he simply held her closer, murmuring soothing words while his own heart ached. Silently he vowed: I'm back now, Evelyn. And that bastard Nathan will pay.

Outside the doorway, Sebastian and Dominic Kingsley stood shoulder-to-shoulder, watching the tender scene.

Dominic ground his teeth in frustration. "That damn rogue always swoops in at the last minute! Why doesn't she ever cry like that for me? Shows up once every blue moon and steals her affection. Who does he think he is?"

The helicopter landing had wreaked havoc on Celestial Atelier's manicured gardens - shattered tiles and uprooted shrubs littered the once-pristine grounds.

Sebastian sighed, adjusting his cufflinks. "I'll inform Maxwell that landscaping repairs will be deducted from his trust fund."

Exhausted from working through the night, Evelyn had finally perfected the bracelet before collapsing atop a pile of gemstones in slumber.

Walter Grayson had prepared a luxurious suite. Under Dominic's watchful glare, Maxwell carefully carried his sister's limp form to bed.

After tucking her in and pressing a kiss to her forehead, he exited with quiet satisfaction, closing the door behind him.

"Real generous of you - globe-trotting secret agent and all you bring our sister is a damn chocolate bar? Cheapskate." Dominic crossed his arms with a derisive snort.

"Stop making assumptions, Dom." Maxwell shot him an unimpressed look.

"You better show some respect!"

"Not happening."

"Asshole!"

Enraged, Dominic aimed a powerful kick at his brother.

But a top-tier operative like Maxwell dodged effortlessly, leaving Dominic stumbling awkwardly, nearly splitting his tailored trousers in the process. The humiliated prosecutor barely caught himself on a console table.
###Chapter 86

"Maxwell, are you attempting ballet now? Careful not to rupture anything important!" Dominic clutched his stomach as laughter erupted from him.

The sound echoed through the high-security corridors of the intelligence agency headquarters - a rare moment of levity in their normally tense environment.

Sebastian observed his younger brothers' antics with paternal amusement, memories of their childhood flashing through his mind.

"Speaking of which," Dominic's eyes lit up with excitement, "let me show you the present I prepared for Evelyn."

He produced a sleek titanium briefcase with military precision. The moment he cracked the biometric lock, Sebastian's jaw dropped while Maxwell gasped audibly.

"This prototype was developed exclusively for our division." Dominic's voice took on the cadence of a proud inventor. "Dual ammunition system - lethal rounds on the right selector, tranquilizer darts on the left. Three days of guaranteed unconsciousness with just one prick."

His fingers danced over the contents. "This cigarette lighter? Actually a micro-explosive capable of leveling small structures. And Evelyn's jewelry hobby gave me inspiration." He held up an elegant ring that caught the light dangerously.

Maxwell reached instinctively, only to have his wrist seized in an iron grip. "Ah-ah. Each thorn contains a neurotoxin that makes cyanide seem like vitamin supplements."

Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose. "Lord have mercy on your soul."

"I'm amazed Evelyn survived childhood with you around," Maxwell muttered, eyeing the arsenal warily.

"You underestimate our sister," Dominic's expression darkened. "These are precautionary gifts for that bastard Nathan. The manner of his demise depends entirely on Evelyn's preference."

A newfound respect flickered in Maxwell's eyes.

"How long is your leave this time?" Sebastian interjected with brotherly concern.

"Two weeks, give or take." Dominic's shoulders slumped slightly. "There's a critical operation in Silvercrest next month requiring advance preparation. Otherwise I'd extend my stay."

"Official duties take precedence," Sebastian reassured him. "Between Maxwell and myself, Evelyn remains well-protected."

A weighted pause followed before Sebastian ventured carefully, "Will you visit Father? He mentioned you recently."

"That old fox will outlive us all whether I appear or not." Dominic's dismissive wave couldn't mask the shadow crossing his features.

The brothers exchanged uneasy glances. While Evelyn had gradually accepted Harrison's... complicated domestic arrangements, Dominic remained the lone holdout, his military career serving as self-imposed exile.

Yet recently, nostalgia had begun eroding his resolve. Memories of simpler times - of sibling camaraderie uncomplicated by adult betrayals.

"Dom," Maxwell felt the shift in mood, "how about we-"

"Let's go hunting," Dominic interrupted, slinging an arm around his brother's neck with sudden enthusiasm, their earlier squabble forgotten.

"Hunting what exactly?" Maxwell's eyes narrowed in suspicion.

"Alone. Evelyn made us swear not to provoke Nathan, and I intend to keep that promise." Maxwell backpedaled as if from radioactive material.

Dominic's lips curled into something between a smirk and a snarl. "Suit yourself." The dangerous glint in his eye suggested the hunt was already underway - with or without participation.
###Chapter 87

Evelyn remained at the Celestial Atelier for three exhausting days.

To recreate the jade bracelet Reginald had given her, she barely slept during this period. When exhaustion overwhelmed her, she would collapse onto the workshop couch for brief naps. Simple meals sustained her as she tirelessly worked the precious stone.

During daylight hours, Evelyn shooed away her protective brothers. Yet each evening, they canceled all engagements to dine with her.

Despite the lavish spread of her favorite dishes they procured, Evelyn merely poked at her food with disinterest, chin resting heavily in her palm.

The Kingsley brothers exchanged worried glances, helpless in their ignorance of jewelry craftsmanship.

"Ms. Carter."

Evelyn blinked slowly at Walter's voice, her gaze dull with fatigue.

Walter produced an exquisite embroidered jewelry box from his jacket, placing it before her with reverence.

"Uncle Walter, what's this?"

"Open it."

Frowning, Evelyn lifted the lid—then gasped, hands flying to cover her parted lips. Inside lay a translucent jade bracelet nearly identical to the one she'd broken!

"My master Edmund left this behind. Among his lifetime creations, this was his proudest work." Walter sighed heavily. "He intended it for his beloved, but fate intervened."

"Master Fairchild had a lover? I thought he was a lifelong bachelor," Dominic mumbled through a mouthful of steak.

Walter shot him a withering look. "Even geniuses experience love, young man."

"I assumed Master Fairchild only cared for gemstones," Maxwell quipped, swirling his wine.

"Then why didn't he give it to her? Cold feet?" Sebastian teased.

Walter's expression darkened. "They attended university together. For twenty years, Edmund teased her mercilessly, never realizing his own feelings until it was too late. When she married another, he planned to gift this bracelet at her wedding. But that morning..." His voice cracked. "A horrific accident took her life."

The Kingsley siblings fell silent, the weight of tragedy pressing upon them.

"After that, Master Edmund swore off romance. He poured his grief into jade carving, slowly mending his shattered heart through artistry."

"His love became immortal," Evelyn whispered, eyes shimmering with emotion.

"Yet all this pain stemmed from his silence," Maxwell observed bluntly. Three pairs of furious eyes turned on him, making him gulp his wine in retreat.

A bitter taste flooded Evelyn's mouth. If even the emotionally reserved Master Fairchild could love so deeply... What did that say about Nathan after three years of marriage?

Had Nathan felt even a flicker of remorse during their divorce?

Impossible.

How could he have spewed such cruel words otherwise? How could he consistently side with those vipers against her?

Now divorced, she no longer held the Blackwood name—not that Nathan had ever shown her basic respect while she did.

Evelyn drained her wine glass in one burning swallow, the alcohol clearing her mind. Comparing that bastard to Master Fairchild was sacrilege enough to make the late artisan spin in his grave.

"Ms. Carter, please accept this bracelet. After careful comparison, it's the closest match to your broken one."

"No! This is Master Fairchild's relic—it's priceless!" Evelyn shoved the box away in panic.

"My master's final wish was to preserve his collection untouched... except for Harrison's descendants. You may take whatever you desire from his legacy."

Evelyn's nose stung, tears welling. "Uncle Walter, I—"

"I've witnessed your tireless efforts these past days. Whoever this bracelet represents must mean everything to you." Walter pressed the box firmly into her hands. "Your grandfather would be proud to know his work brings you comfort."

That night, the Kingsley siblings departed the atelier after emotional farewells.

In the Rolls-Royce returning to Crestview, Evelyn drowsed against Sebastian's shoulder, the jewelry box clutched protectively to her chest.

"Evelyn," Sebastian began hesitantly, voice gravelly with tension. "Nathan contacted me the night you returned to Fairhaven."

Her heart lurched, but she forced calm into her voice. "Oh?"
###Chapter 88

"I told him not to contact you again, and I wasn’t exactly gentle about it."

Sebastian’s lips curved into a smirk. "I’m not sure how he’ll take it."

Evelyn tossed her hair over her shoulder, her chin lifting. "Good. I’m not some ordinary woman he can just waltz back into. I’m the woman of Monarch Group’s president."

Sebastian’s eyes gleamed with amusement. "That’s right. You’re the only woman the Kingsley family spoils rotten."

His fingers brushed her shoulder affectionately before he reached into his pocket.

"Give me your phone," Evelyn demanded.

Sebastian arched a brow but handed it over without question. "Password’s your birthday."

"I know."

Her fingers flew across the screen, navigating straight to the contacts. Without hesitation, she blocked Nathan Blackwood’s number.

Sebastian chuckled. "Well done."

"We have to cut him off completely," Evelyn said coldly. "Otherwise, that bastard will keep pushing his luck."

The mere mention of her ex-husband darkened her expression.

Nathan hadn’t been himself lately.

Sleep eluded him. Food tasted like ash.

All because Evelyn had vanished from his life without a trace.

Worse, Reginald Blackwood had taken to calling him daily, demanding he find her. The old man was relentless—more persistent than a lovesick teenager.

"Mr. Blackwood, why don’t we file a missing persons report?"

Oliver Sinclair, his ever-loyal secretary, was grasping at straws. "You and Ms. Kingsley haven’t finalized the divorce. Legally, she’s still your wife. It’s perfectly reasonable to locate her."

Nathan shot him a withering glare. "That’s the dumbest idea you’ve had all week."

Oliver wilted. "Then what do you suggest? She’s completely off the grid. No phone, no friends. The only person who might know where she is—Sebastian Kingsley—won’t even take your calls."

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

Last night, he’d tried Sebastian’s number again—only to discover he’d been blocked.

The first time in his life anyone had dared.

The rejection had hit like a punch to the gut, leaving him adrift in a haze of disbelief.

Humiliation burned through him.

Abruptly, Nathan stood, snatching his suit jacket from the back of his chair.

"Get the car ready. We’re going to Monarch Grand Hotel."

Evelyn had thrown herself into work since returning from Fairhaven.

Theodore Winslow had handled the high-level meetings in her absence, but the moment she strode back into the office, his face lit up like the sun breaking through storm clouds.

"Occupancy rates are up twenty percent," he reported, sliding a file across her desk. "Not groundbreaking, but progress."

Evelyn skimmed the numbers.

She’d also revamped the hotel’s culinary offerings, launching a highly successful Food Week that drew crowds. The daily revenue from dining alone was staggering.

But Evelyn wasn’t satisfied.

Harrison Kingsley hadn’t raised a daughter who settled for good enough.

She would make Monarch Grand Hotels eclipse Blackwood Industries’ empire.

In love, she’d lost.

In business? She refused to let Nathan Blackwood win.

"Someone booked the presidential suite last night," Evelyn remarked idly, flipping through the financial reports. "The one that’s been vacant for two years."

Theodore moved behind her, fingers working expertly at the tension in her shoulders. "Guess who?"

"Julian Montgomery again?"

Theodore snorted. "Cassandra Blackwood."

Evelyn’s brows lifted. "What on earth does she need that much space for? Practicing acrobatics?"

"According to housekeeping, she threw a party with three friends. Then around midnight, two male models slipped in and stayed till dawn." Theodore’s voice dripped with disdain. "Thankfully, our soundproofing is top-tier. They left at five, probably to avoid being seen."

Evelyn wrinkled her nose. "Cassandra’s always been wild, but two escorts for three women? That’s just greedy."

"Once she checks out, have housekeeping sterilize the entire suite," Evelyn ordered. "Burn the linens. I won’t risk guests catching something."

Theodore’s phone buzzed. A supervisor’s name flashed on the screen.

He listened, expression darkening.

Evelyn straightened. "Problem?"

"Ms. Kingsley, Cassandra’s causing a scene in the lobby. She’s accusing our staff of theft and demanding answers immediately."
###Chapter 89

The Monarch Grand Hotel lobby buzzed with tension as a crowd gathered around the unfolding drama.

"Ms. Blackwood, please compose yourself," the flustered manager pleaded, mopping his brow. "As a distinguished guest, this public display is most unbecoming. Perhaps we could continue this discussion in private?"

Cassandra Blackwood's crimson nails tapped impatiently against the marble counter. "Distinguished? Then why are your staff stealing from me? Or is theft standard practice here for 'ordinary' guests?"

The murmuring crowd recognized the Blackwood heiress, though her current behavior resembled more of a street brawler than a socialite.

"I...I didn't take anything," the trembling housekeeper whispered, eyes downcast.

"Liar!" Cassandra's manicured finger jabbed toward the woman's face, stopping just short of her eye. "My necklace was on the vanity! Do you think it grew legs?"

Amelia Thornton sneered, "We're all women of standing here. Why would we touch your cheap baubles?"

"Unlike some," Beatrice Whitmore added with a pointed look at the housekeeper, "who've probably never seen real jewelry before."

Cassandra crossed her arms with a derisive laugh. "Pathetic. I expected better from a Monarch property. My family's hotels would never tolerate such incompetence!"

The manager's expression darkened. In his twenty years of hospitality, he'd never encountered such blatant disrespect.

The tension shattered when a clear voice cut through the murmurs. "Ms. Blackwood, you're making unsubstantiated accusations and publicly humiliating our staff. Is this really appropriate behavior?"

All heads turned toward the striking woman in an ivory pantsuit striding forward. Evelyn Carter moved with such effortless grace in her towering Louboutins that they might as well have been slippers.

Cassandra's entourage gaped at the vision approaching them.

"You?" Cassandra's lip curled as she took in Evelyn's designer ensemble and the sapphire drops swaying at her ears - each piece worth more than Cassandra's entire outfit.

The contrast between the two women couldn't have been starker - Evelyn radiating quiet sophistication while Cassandra resembled a shrieking harpy.

At that precise moment, Nathan Blackwood and Oliver Sinclair entered the lobby. Nathan's breath caught at the sight of his estranged wife after weeks of radio silence. His pulse quickened as his gaze traced her familiar silhouette.

"Sir, it's Mrs. Blackwood!" Oliver whispered excitedly before noticing Cassandra. His face fell. "What's Miss Cassandra doing here? This looks... problematic."

Nathan's jaw tightened, but he held up a hand. "Let's observe first."

The housekeeper burst into relieved tears upon seeing Evelyn. "Manager Carter, please-"

"Manager?" Cassandra scoffed. "How the mighty have fallen."

Evelyn's lips curved into a dazzling smile. "On the contrary, I've never been happier. At least now I'm treated with basic human decency."

The barb struck Nathan like a physical blow. His throat constricted as bitter realization dawned. Had his family truly made her feel less than human all those years?
###Chapter 90

Nathan Blackwood believed he had given Evelyn Carter the prestige of being a CEO’s wife.

Though he felt nothing for her, she lived in luxury—dressed in designer clothes, dining on gourmet meals, and attended by an army of servants.

She never suffered.

He had even provided her with a supplementary credit card. Money was never an issue for him.

Yet in three years, Evelyn had never spent a cent on that card.

Still, her life now was a thousand times better than when she had worked as a caregiver in a nursing home.

So why did she make it sound like he had mistreated her?

The thought made Nathan’s jaw tighten, his eyes darkening with restrained fury.

Pft.

"You’re just being stubborn," Cassandra Blackwood sneered, flipping her wavy hair. "Since you’re the manager here, I won’t be nice. Your hotel owes me an explanation—and compensation. A replacement necklace. Identical. It’s not that expensive—just two million."

Her lips curled. "Or you can send this thieving maid to prison. And you—" She jabbed a manicured finger at Evelyn. "—will bow and apologize to me in front of everyone. Money isn’t the issue. I refuse to tolerate this humiliation."

Cassandra would never acknowledge Evelyn as her former sister-in-law in public.

That would be mortifying.

Besides, this was her chance to crush the country bumpkin.

At the last charity auction, Evelyn had stolen the spotlight. Now? She was just a lowly part-time worker, no longer under Nathan’s protection.

Cassandra would make her pay.

"Mr. Blackwood, the young madam is being bullied again!" Oliver Sinclair whispered urgently. He despised Cassandra’s arrogance—but his concern for Evelyn ran deeper.

"Wait."

Nathan’s gaze sharpened.

He was… curious.

He had never seen Evelyn in a professional setting. In his memory, she was just a meek housewife.

Hotels were a ruthless business. He wanted to see if she could handle this—if Sebastian Kingsley’s decision to make her manager had been wise.

"Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said calmly, "if your necklace is truly worth two million, I suggest filing a police report. We’ll cooperate fully—surveillance footage, employee searches, whatever they require. But only with a warrant."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"That’s reasonable! Why make a scene if she’s innocent?"

"Maybe she lost it and wants a scapegoat!"

Cassandra’s face flushed crimson. "A warrant? That thief has already hidden it!"

"I’m not a thief!" The maid trembled, her eyes burning with indignation.

Evelyn held up her phone. "Every inch of this hotel is monitored—except private areas like bathrooms and staff rooms. No one could’ve smuggled it out. And I’ve already called the police. They’ll be here in ten minutes."

She met Cassandra’s glare without flinching. "As for your apology demand—I’ll gladly comply if we’re at fault."

Oliver nearly clapped.

The young madam is incredible!

Nathan’s pulse quickened despite himself.

Evelyn had handled this like a seasoned executive—calm, strategic, unshakable.

This wasn’t the timid woman he’d married.

"Fine!" Cassandra spat. "You said it yourself. Don’t blame me when you’re humiliated!"

"Of course. As manager, I take responsibility for our guests’ satisfaction." Evelyn smiled—but her eyes remained ice-cold.

Just then, Theodore Winslow hurried over, clutching an evidence bag.

"We found Ms. Blackwood’s necklace!"
###Chapter 91

Gasps rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

Cassandra Blackwood and her two sycophantic friends stood frozen, their jaws slack with shock.

Theodore Winslow lifted the damaged necklace with gloved hands, presenting it before Cassandra. His glacial stare could have frozen molten lava.

"Ms. Blackwood," his voice cut through the tension, "is this the necklace you claimed was stolen?"

Cassandra's face contorted in disbelief. A shrill scream tore from her throat. "My necklace! What happened to my necklace? Who did this?"

The gathered guests craned their necks, murmuring as they took in the shattered remains of what had once been a dazzling diamond necklace.

"Our general manager dispatched me immediately upon hearing of your loss," Theodore explained icily. "After searching the entire presidential suite, we discovered this beneath your sofa. The damage was already done."

Snickers erupted around them.

"Look at her! Making false accusations to extort the hotel!"

"That diamond's the size of my fist! Who wears something so vulgar in public?"

Cassandra's cheeks burned crimson. "Finding it proves nothing!" she spat. "Your maid probably hid it there when she realized she couldn't smuggle it out!"

"I didn't! I swear!" The trembling housekeeper clutched her chest, struggling to breathe through her panic.

Evelyn Carter's gaze sharpened like honed steel. "If this were theft, why destroy such valuable merchandise?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Unless someone wanted to humiliate you by provoking this exact scene."

Cassandra stiffened. Her companions shrank behind her like frightened mice.

"The hotel has fulfilled its obligation," Evelyn continued. "But if you insist on pressing charges..." Her eyes flicked toward Amelia and Beatrice. "My secretary preserved the evidence meticulously. The police will conduct fingerprint analysis. Such a large diamond surface should yield excellent prints, don't you agree?"

Murmurs of approval spread through the crowd.

"Fingerprints! Brilliant!"

"Finally, some justice!"

The color drained from the two accomplices' faces. They yanked Cassandra's arms. "Enough! You're embarrassing yourself!"

Cassandra hesitated, then snatched the broken necklace with a haughty sniff.

"Ms. Blackwood." Evelyn's voice stopped her mid-stride. "You've publicly slandered my employee. Don't you owe her an apology?"

"Apologize? To staff?" Cassandra's laugh rang hollow. "I'm a paying guest!"

Disgusted whispers followed.

"Is this really a Blackwood? Such appalling manners!"

"That poor girl was practically groveling earlier!"

Tears streamed down the housekeeper's face as her body trembled violently.

"Complain about service all you like," Evelyn said, stepping closer, "but false theft accusations demand accountability."

Cassandra's nostrils flared. "You expect me to—"

A sudden thud cut her off.

The housekeeper collapsed, limbs seizing, foam bubbling at her lips.

While others froze, Evelyn dropped to her knees, expertly loosening the girl's uniform. "Epileptic seizure! Theodore, call an ambulance!"

"The ambulance is already on its way."

That rich baritone could only belong to one man.

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder to find Nathan Blackwood looming behind her, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame. The crowd instinctively parted for him like the Red Sea.

His arrival changed everything.
###Chapter 92

The moment their gazes locked, the world seemed to stop.

As if someone had frozen time itself.

"It's Mr. Blackwood!" someone gasped in recognition.

Nathan Blackwood's sudden appearance sent a jolt of panic through Evelyn Carter.

She feared him. Even though Penelope Whitmore whispered insults about him being illegitimate, no one could deny his iron grip on the Blackwood family.

"Oliver, get Cassandra out of here," Nathan commanded, his voice devoid of emotion.

Someone had already begun recording the scene. If Cassandra stayed any longer, she’d tarnish the Blackwood name beyond repair.

Oliver Sinclair didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Cassandra’s arm and dragged her away before she could protest.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her cold gaze flickering.

Nathan was as ruthless as ever.

He didn’t care about right or wrong—only power and reputation.

"Oh no! She's going to bite her tongue!" Theodore Winslow shouted in alarm.

Evelyn’s heart lurched. Without thinking, she shoved her wrist between the girl’s teeth.

A sharp pain shot through her arm as the girl clamped down hard. Evelyn clenched her jaw, refusing to flinch.

Nathan’s breath hitched. He lunged forward, but it was too late.

He could only watch as Evelyn, small but unyielding, acted with the bravery of a true healer.

The sight sent a tremor through him.

For a moment, he saw her again.

On the battlefields of Eldermere, that little dove had done the same—dragging his wounded body to safety with nothing but a bloodied rope.

"Don’t give up! We’ll make it out alive!"

Later, chaos swallowed the camp. Nathan never found her—only that rope, soaked in crimson. He never knew what became of her hands.

His fists tightened. A suffocating weight pressed against his chest.

The ambulance arrived swiftly, and the housekeeper was rushed away.

Evelyn insisted Theodore accompany her to the hospital.

"Thank you for your quick response, miss. You bought us critical time," one paramedic said gratefully.

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "I just hope she’ll be alright."

Back in the hotel lobby, the manager had already dispersed the crowd.

Evelyn glanced at the deep, bloody bite mark on her wrist. The throbbing pain was relentless. She turned toward the infirmary.

"Evelyn."

Her pulse spiked. Before she could react, Nathan was right behind her, his expression stormy.

They stood so close she could feel his breath on her skin.

One step forward, and they’d be touching.

For a heartbeat, she froze—then immediately tried to retreat.

But Nathan seized her arm and yanked her against him.

Evelyn crashed into his chest, the impact sending her heart into chaos.

Did this man have steel under his shirt?

"Nathan, control yourself," she hissed, struggling to break free.

"Where have you been?" His grip tightened, his dark eyes burning into hers. "Why did you vanish?"

She laughed bitterly. "Since when do I answer to you?"

His jaw tensed. "Evelyn, come with me."

"Let go," she snapped. "Or I’m calling security."

Nathan’s gaze darkened.

She dares to dismiss me? After everything?

Possession and pride ignited something primal in him.

"Call Sebastian if you want," he growled. "It won’t stop me from taking you."
###Chapter 93

Evelyn's gaze was icy and resolute.

"Victoria must have pampered you so much that you've grown shameless."

"This is between us. Don't drag anyone else into it." Nathan's chest burned with fury.

"If you don't want to hear harsh words, then stay away from me. The only thing left between us is finalizing the divorce. Goodbye, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan was accustomed to Evelyn's bright, adoring eyes. The coldness in them now sent a chill down his spine, as if he'd plunged into an icy abyss, the warmth around him vanishing.

"I won't let you leave!"

Evelyn parted her lips slightly, a mocking smirk playing on them. "Who do you think you are to command me? Am I your pet? Why should I obey you?"

"You don’t have to degrade yourself like that. I never thought of you as a pet." Nathan frowned, displeased.

"Degrade myself?" She laughed bitterly. "Nathan, are you truly this dense? Can’t you understand? I despise you. Stop bothering me!"

Evelyn's eyes reddened as she tried to wrench her wrist free.

But Nathan was just as stubborn. The more she struggled, the tighter his grip became, oblivious to the pain he was causing.

"Ah—!" She gasped, wincing.

Clutching her forearm, she doubled over, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

Nathan finally noticed something was wrong and released her immediately.

His breath hitched when he saw the blood staining his palm.

In his desperation to keep her from leaving, he had forgotten about the unhealed wound on her wrist.

He had been reckless.

"I’ll take you to the infirmary." His voice was rough with guilt, his expression heavy.

"Leave. Or I’ll call the police." Evelyn stepped back, her glare sharp.

"Get out!"

She couldn’t take it anymore. Her heart ached just like her wounded hand.

For three years of marriage, Nathan had ignored her, never even touching her.

Now that they were divorced, he wouldn’t stop harassing her.

How ironic.

Nathan stiffened at her outburst, his handsome face frozen in shock.

"You want me gone? Why didn’t you say that when you forced me into marriage?"

"Because I loved you back then." Her eyes burned with unshed tears.

Nathan felt as if a knife had twisted in his chest. His breathing turned ragged.

"When I loved you, you could treat me however you pleased. But now? My patience is gone. Did you think you could still enjoy my devotion after the divorce? No, Nathan. I don’t love you. You mean nothing to me."

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly, turned on her heel, and walked away without hesitation.

"Evelyn, if it weren’t for Grandfather, do you think I’d bother chasing after you? Do you know how much he misses you? He’s been restless, unable to reach you."

Nathan’s voice cracked, his words laced with bitterness. "You claim you care about him. Are you breaking your promise now? Do you think he’s too senile to notice?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, her breath shaky.

Reginald was the one person she couldn’t bear to disappoint. He was the last thread tying her to Nathan.

Evelyn was a woman of her word. She had promised to wait until after Reginald’s birthday to finalize the divorce, and she wouldn’t go back on that—no matter how much it hurt.

"I’m not breaking my promise. I’ll visit him in the next few days."

"Now."

"What?"

"Come with me to see him now. He hasn’t slept properly in five days. Without you, he barely eats."

Nathan’s patience was fraying, his breathing uneven.

"Don’t let him down, Evelyn."

In the end, she relented.

When she first cared for Reginald at the nursing home, her motives hadn’t been pure. Back then, she never imagined marrying Nathan. She only wanted to do something for him, to see him more often.

But over time, she grew genuinely fond of the kind old man.

Despite his age, Reginald remained sharp—wise, strategic, and insightful. Even retired from Blackwood Industries, he still guided the family’s major decisions when needed. He was a mentor to the younger generations.

Evelyn had learned much from him, applying those lessons when managing Monarch Grand Hotels.

To her, Reginald wasn’t just a grandfather—he was her teacher.
###Chapter 94

Nathan escorted Evelyn to the infirmary. The doctor was out, so Evelyn reached for the iodine and gauze, preparing to dress her wound herself.

"Let me." Nathan stepped forward, his expression dark.

Evelyn turned away sharply, glaring at him. "I don't need your help."

They were both stubborn—Nathan especially. He either ignored her completely or forced his way through.

So he seized her wrist firmly, his voice commanding. "Evelyn, stay still."

She froze. A cool sensation spread over her skin as he carefully applied the antiseptic, dabbing gently with a cotton swab.

His lashes lowered as he studied her delicate hand, the smoothness of her skin.

It was strange—even when she wasn’t trying, Evelyn still managed to look effortlessly alluring.

Nathan remained composed as he examined the wound.

Her palms were rougher than he expected, yet still soft.

Slender fingers, but her fingertips bore faint calluses. It felt like she had lived far beyond her years.

A sudden jolt shot through him, an unbidden image flashing in his mind—moonlight spilling through gauzy curtains, an unfamiliar room, yet her presence achingly familiar.

He inhaled sharply, forcing himself to focus. His throat tightened.

He had never felt this way about Victoria. So why did his ex-wife, who constantly tested his patience, stir something so unsettling?

It made no sense.

Evelyn felt the heat of his touch searing her skin. She tried to pull away.

"Done."

"Wrap it."

He ignored her resistance, gripping her hand tighter. "Been mining coal lately? Your fingers are rough."

"No, I was shoveling manure." She smirked, knowing his aversion to filth.

"Evelyn, must you always be so crude?" His brow twitched.

"I speak just fine. You’re the one with the problem."

Her nose lifted, lips curving in a sly, taunting smile.

Nathan felt heat rise in his chest. This woman had grown bold now that she had backing.

And yet—he found it intriguing.

If they hadn’t divorced, he’d never have known how sharp she truly was.

Nathan finished bandaging her wound swiftly. He wasn’t some spoiled heir who only knew how to spend money.

Once, Evelyn had Donovan dig into Nathan’s records. He’d been second in his class at the military academy.

Occasionally, he and Maxwell Kingsley—her fourth brother—would battle for the top spot.

In truth, with Nathan’s strategic mind, he’d have made a better agent than Maxwell. He could’ve even matched Donovan’s position. But as a Blackwood, his only path was taking over the family empire.

Yet after leaving the military, he’d carved his own legacy in business.

A legend in his own right.

Pity he was blind. All his brilliance wasted on Victoria Sterling.

Evelyn’s lips twisted. Whatever. Not my problem anymore.

She vowed to stay far away from him.

They reached the parking lot.

Evelyn moved toward her Bugatti when Nathan blocked her.

"Where are you going?"

"To get my car, obviously."

"Take mine." His tone was inexplicably cold.

"A proper woman doesn’t ride with her ex. Bye."

She waved dismissively, but Nathan yanked the car door open, gripped her waist, and shoved her inside before slamming it shut.

"Hey! Kidnapping now?!" She smacked the window, cheeks flushed with irritation.

"I don’t trust you, Evelyn."

Nathan braced his arm against the roof, leaning down to meet her furious gaze through the glass.

His eyes narrowed, watching her like a caged bird—one he wouldn’t let escape.

"You’re always scheming. I have to be careful."
###Chapter 95

The car ride was uncomfortably silent. Evelyn sat rigidly beside Nathan, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window. Not once did she glance in his direction.

Every fiber of her being radiated disdain for the man beside her.

Nathan stole a glance at her profile. A dozen questions burned on his tongue, but the words stuck in his throat.

Reginald's private villa nestled in the secluded Moonlight Cove of Crestview, surrounded by lush mountains that created a peaceful sanctuary away from the bustling city.

"Grandfather! I'm here!"

The moment Evelyn stepped through the grand entrance, her gloomy expression transformed. Her eyes sparkled like stars, her melodic voice ringing through the halls with genuine warmth.

Beneath her cheerful exterior, Evelyn's stomach churned with anxiety about the bracelet. She'd spent days mentally preparing for this encounter with Reginald.

"Evelyn, my dear! How I've missed you!" Reginald appeared in the foyer, being wheeled in by his secretary Marcus Underwood.

The elderly man's tired eyes lit up instantly at the sight of his granddaughter-in-law. His bushy eyebrows shot up in delight.

"Where have you been hiding, girl? Have you forgotten about this old man? Don't you love me anymore?"

Reginald grasped Evelyn's hands tightly, showering her with affectionate questions while completely ignoring Nathan standing behind them.

Nathan's lips twisted in irritation.

At his grandfather's age, the man still flirted shamelessly. Nathan could only imagine what a terror Reginald must have been in his youth - probably worse than Julian Montgomery at his most outrageous.

"Grandfather, I've been swamped with work and traveling. Please forgive me for not visiting sooner." Evelyn knelt gracefully before the wheelchair, her smile softening the edges of her apology.

"How could I stay angry at you, my dear? I'm just overjoyed to see you."

Then Reginald's gaze shifted to Nathan, his expression darkening. "If not for certain blind and heartless individuals, I could see my precious granddaughter-in-law every day without all this trouble!"

Evelyn's smile became strained, her fingers nervously adjusting the bracelet on her wrist.

Nathan's face darkened like storm clouds. He should have anticipated this - another evening of being the target of his grandfather's displeasure.

"Evelyn, I've acquired a new painting I've been saving just for you to see first!" Reginald's mood shifted instantly as he eagerly led her toward the study.

"You just want me to authenticate it, don't you?" Evelyn teased, her sly smile returning.

Reginald chuckled. "You've caught me!"

Nathan followed silently, his curiosity piqued.

After three years of marriage, he kept discovering new facets of Evelyn's talents - artist, race car driver, calligrapher, designer, and now art authenticator. The breadth of her skills astonished him.

In the study, Marcus had already laid out the painting on a sandalwood table, wearing white gloves as he carefully unrolled the canvas.

"Evelyn, I just acquired this. Would you examine it for me?" Reginald's eyes shone with anticipation.

"Of course, Grandfather."

Evelyn approached the painting, magnifying glass in hand. She bent gracefully, one hand behind her back as she studied the artwork with intense concentration.

Nathan found himself smiling at her scholarly posture - a Renaissance scholar hidden beneath her modern beauty.

Reginald's gaze flickered to the bracelet on Evelyn's wrist, but his affectionate expression never wavered.

"This is Titian's Equestrian Portrait of Charles V from the Renaissance period," Evelyn announced confidently after her examination.

"Exactly right," Reginald nodded approvingly.

Nathan moved closer, intrigued despite himself.

"The brushwork and pigments match Titian's style and techniques," Evelyn continued softly, her appreciation evident. "But I'm afraid this isn't an original sixteenth-century piece. It's a remarkably skilled replica from later generations."

Nathan found himself captivated by her expertise, studying her profile with new interest.

Reginald sighed dramatically like a disappointed child. "Another mistake? Oh dear..."

Evelyn's gaze lifted unexpectedly, meeting Nathan's intense stare across the painting.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn froze, immediately bowing her head. Her delicate features were partially obscured by her raven-black tresses.

Despite her frantic attempts to compose herself, a telltale flush crept across her cheeks.

Nathan's pulse quickened, his breath growing noticeably warmer against his skin.

At that precise moment, his phone buzzed insistently in his pocket.

Stepping into the hallway, Nathan pressed his back against the cool wall as Victoria's name flashed on the screen. He exhaled sharply before answering.

"Are you still angry with me?" Victoria's tearful voice came through before he could speak.

"No." His reply was flat, devoid of inflection.

Yet Victoria sensed the lingering tension between them. "Then come see me tonight? I've missed you terribly, Nathan. I can't sleep thinking about you..." Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness.

"Not tonight. I'm with Grandfather."

"At Cliffside Manor? Perfect! I'll join you there." Her tone brightened instantly. "Remember how you always said I should visit him more? I've baked your favorite walnut cake - just like when we'd sneak treats in the alley as children. I'll bring some for Grandfather too, let him taste my baking skills." She sounded every inch the devoted partner.

"Victoria, tonight really isn't good."

Nathan's resolve wavered at the childhood memory. "Evelyn's here with Grandfather. You running into her would be... complicated. You know how fond he is of her."

"You're with Evelyn now?" Her voice cracked.

"Yes. Grandfather's been asking for her. I simply brought her to see him."

"Is that truly all it is? Or do you want to see her too?" The familiar edge of jealousy sharpened her words.

"Don't be ridiculous." Nathan's throat constricted.

"That shameless woman!" Victoria exploded. "Why does she keep inserting herself between us after the divorce? She's clearly manipulating Grandfather against me! How dare she use him as a weapon!"

Nathan massaged his temples, exhaling wearily.

Back in the study, Evelyn's thoughts swirled chaotically, her skin still tingling from Nathan's intense gaze.

Damn these traitorous reactions! His bedroom eyes mean nothing - he probably looks at his coffee maker the same way!

"Evelyn?" Reginald's voice snapped her back to reality.

"Yes, Grandfather?" She forced a bright smile.

"You truly cherish that bracelet I gave you, don't you? Never seen you without it."

Evelyn's stomach plummeted. Her throat tightened as if filled with wet concrete.

"Grandfather..."

"Wear it always. The jade has healing properties." His kind eyes crinkled. "I had Marcus organize Deborah's jewelry yesterday. Found several exceptional jade pieces for you to take home." His expression softened. "This old man won't be around forever. Once I thought Nathan would care for you... but that fool's blinded by that scheming girl, just like his idiot father." He patted her hand. "These pieces will ensure your security. Promise me you'll be happy, Evelyn? Evelyn? What's wrong?"

The formidable patriarch froze, utterly unprepared for the scene before him.

Evelyn stood rigid, shoulders trembling violently. Fat tears rolled down her cheeks, splashing onto the priceless rug.

"Grandfather... I'm so sorry..."

The dam burst. Years of guilt over deceiving this kind man, failing to protect his treasured gift - it all came crashing down in wrenching sobs.

"My dear girl, what's this?" Reginald fumbled for his monogrammed handkerchief. "There now, don't cry."

Nathan, still in the hallway, heard the commotion. Peering through the doorway, his heart seized at the sight of his ex-wife's breakdown. The phone nearly slipped from his suddenly numb fingers.
###Chapter 97

Evelyn's sobs echoed through the phone line.

Nathan's knuckles turned white around his phone. He knew Reginald had never approved of Victoria, but using the old man against her? How despicable could she be?

The man's dark eyes flickered with barely contained rage. Victoria's frantic words barely registered in his mind.

The woman before him was crying so hard her shoulders shook. Yet he could feel the raw pain behind each tear. Every drop that fell carved another wound in his heart.

"Sweetheart, what's wrong? You're scaring me!" Reginald had witnessed many things, but never his precious Evelyn in such distress.

"I...I broke the bracelet!" Her voice cracked. "I've tried everything to fix it, but nothing worked! So I thought...maybe I could make a new one because I was terrified you'd be disappointed in me. I'm so sorry, Grandpa! I lied to you!"

Her petite frame trembled violently. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks, dripping onto her clenched hands.

She looked utterly shattered.

Nathan stood frozen, listening to her broken confession.

Suddenly, everything made sense - her mysterious disappearances these past days, the faint calluses marring her delicate fingers. She'd been desperately trying to restore his grandfather's gift.

Her tears burned through him like acid, spreading anguish through every vein.

"Evelyn, my dear, it's just a bracelet!" Reginald squeezed her hand, his own eyes moist. "Truth be told, I noticed its absence the moment you arrived. I assumed it had broken or gotten lost. But these trinkets mean nothing compared to your happiness! Your grandmother left crates of jade pieces. She always joked they were too cumbersome - made me promise not to bury them with her!"

Evelyn's tense shoulders relaxed slightly, though tears still clung to her lashes. The tip of her nose remained an adorable shade of pink.

"Nathan! Where is that rascal?" Reginald banged his wheelchair armrest. "Get in here and comfort your wife this instant!"

"Nathan, don't you dare hang up!" Victoria's shrill voice pierced through the phone. "We're not finished!"

"Something requires my attention. We'll talk later."

The line went dead before she could protest.

Victoria stared at the darkened screen, her chest heaving. Rage twisted her beautiful features.

"Evelyn Carter, you scheming whore! I'll make sure you die screaming!"

Her fingers flew across the screen as she dialed Penelope.

"Aunt Penelope! That bitch Evelyn is at Cliffside Manor with Nathan!" Victoria wailed dramatically. "He hung up on me! Do you know what this means? All your years training me will be wasted if I don't become a Blackwood!"

She knew mere pleading wouldn't suffice. Penelope needed to feel personally threatened.

"Victoria, compose yourself," came the measured reply. "Forcing Nathan will only backfire, especially after the...unfortunate incident with Evelyn. Even with childhood bonds, you mustn't test his patience."

"Then what should I do?" Victoria whimpered.

"Play the victim - but ensure Nathan witnesses your suffering." Penelope's voice dripped venom. "With my guidance, that Kingsley trash doesn't stand a chance. She'd need another lifetime to best us!"

Nathan's imposing frame filled the study doorway.

"Grandfather. You summoned me."

"Deaf as well as stupid, are you?" Reginald snapped. "Didn't you hear Evelyn crying? Would you have left her suffering if I hadn't called you?"

For Evelyn's smile, Reginald would gladly sacrifice his grandson.

"Of course not."
###Chapter 98

Nathan responded, stepping closer to Evelyn with deliberate strides. His piercing gaze locked onto her tear-streaked face.

Twin trails of glistening tears adorned her delicate features, resembling dewdrops on rose petals at dawn. The sight was both heartbreaking and breathtaking.

Evelyn felt heat rising to her cheeks. A single tear escaped her long lashes, tracing a path down her flushed skin.

Nathan's breath hitched. His chest tightened as he watched Evelyn struggle to compose herself.

"You idiot! Comfort your wife this instant!" Reginald barked, his cane thumping against the marble floor.

"Why should I? I didn't make her cry." Nathan's brow furrowed in genuine confusion.

Reginald's face turned crimson. "Because Evelyn is your wife! Should an old man like me have to do your job? Are you completely daft?"

"Grandfather, Nathan and I are divorced. I'm not—"

"Nonsense!" Reginald cut her off sharply. "Once married, always connected. That fool hasn't done right by you in three years. The least he owes you is an apology!"

The word 'divorce' made Reginald's heart clench painfully. His voice trembled with emotion. "You ungrateful brat! If you don't make this right today, don't you dare call me Grandfather again!"

Nathan pressed his lips into a thin line. "My apologies," he murmured.

Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes widened. Her pulse quickened at the unexpected words.

In all their years together, this marked Nathan's first apology.

Too bad it lacked any real sincerity.

"Bow properly!" Reginald commanded.

"Must I?" Nathan's eyebrow arched in disbelief.

"Consider yourself lucky I'm not making you kneel on broken glass like I did for your grandmother! Show some damn sincerity! Evelyn is precious to me. I won't tolerate you treating her lightly. Now!"

Cornered by his grandfather's demands, Nathan exhaled sharply. He took a measured step back, placed a hand over his heart, and executed a perfect formal bow.

"My sincerest apologies, Ms. Carter. Please accept my humble contrition."

The theatrical scene brought an unexpected twinkle to Reginald's eyes. Was this what matchmaking felt like?

Evelyn's blush deepened. Her sobs quieted as she observed Nathan's stiff posture. Despite herself, amusement flickered in her chest.

Secretly, she relished seeing the proud Nathan Blackwood bow before her, regardless of his sincerity.

Just as Nathan began to straighten, Reginald snapped, "Hold that position until Evelyn grants you permission to rise! Don't you dare move a muscle!"

Seconds ticked by in silence.

Evelyn remained deliberately quiet.

Nathan's jaw clenched. She's enjoying this far too much.

Only when she noticed the vein throbbing in Nathan's temple did Evelyn finally speak in a gentle tone. "Grandfather, this really isn't Nathan's fault. Please don't make him suffer needlessly."

Nathan seethed with humiliation.

Clever girl, playing the angel while putting me through this charade!

Yet his anger softened slightly when he noticed how swollen her almond-shaped eyes had become from crying.

At dinner, Evelyn wheeled Reginald into the lavish dining hall while Nathan trailed behind. The table groaned under an extravagant spread prepared specially for Evelyn.

They had just taken their seats when Oliver entered with urgent news, whispering in Nathan's ear.

"Speak plainly if you have something to say!" Reginald snapped. "No secrets at my table - we're family here."

Oliver hesitated, looking to Nathan for guidance.

"Out with it," Nathan commanded coolly.

"Yes, sir." Oliver cleared his throat. "Madam Penelope called. She didn't wish to disturb your dinner with Master Reginald, so she asked me to relay a message..."

"That woman at least knows her place," Reginald muttered darkly.

Oliver continued nervously. "Madam Penelope reports that Ms. Sterling has been diagnosed with acute depressive disorder."
###Chapter 99

Nathan's fork clattered onto the marble floor, his eyes widening in shock.

Evelyn's heart turned to ice as she watched Nathan's panicked reaction to Victoria's name.

"Ms. Sterling has been hysterical all evening, constantly calling for you," Oliver reported with urgency. "Her emotional state is deteriorating rapidly."

"Madam Whitmore insists you come immediately. She fears Ms. Sterling might harm herself."

Before Oliver could finish, Nathan was already on his feet, storming out of the dining room.

"You fool! If you go to that woman, you're no grandson of mine!" Reginald Blackwood slammed his fist on the table, his face red with fury.

But it was too late. Nathan had already vanished from sight.

Evelyn blinked back tears as she gently placed a comforting hand on Reginald's trembling shoulder. "Grandfather, please don't blame yourself. You've done more than enough for me. Some things... some relationships just aren't meant to be."

Outside Cliffside Manor, Nathan was about to jump into his car when a voice stopped him cold.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

He turned to see Evelyn standing under the golden porch lights, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Something twisted in his chest at the sight.

Before he could speak, Evelyn continued in a steady voice, "Your sister assaulted one of my hotel employees today. The girl suffered an epileptic seizure because of Cassandra's actions."

Nathan's brows drew together in surprise. This wasn't what he'd expected her to say.

"Tell your sister this isn't over. She will answer for what she's done to my staff."

The faint hope in Nathan's eyes died instantly. "Cassandra makes her own choices. I don't involve myself in her personal affairs."

"So this is just 'personal affairs' to you?" Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "I see."

Without another word, she turned and walked back into the manor, leaving Nathan standing in the cold night air.

An unfamiliar chill ran down his spine.

Was Evelyn... laughing at him?

That night, Nathan stayed at the Sterling residence until dawn, watching over Victoria in her depressive episode. Though part of him remained wary after the incident with Evelyn, seeing Victoria's severe depression diagnosis report stirred something dark and painful in his soul.

Depression was a wound he knew all too well.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Oliver hesitated, phone in hand. "There's... a situation."

Nathan rubbed his tired eyes. "What is it?"

"A video has surfaced online of Ms. Cassandra verbally abusing a hotel housekeeper. PR wants to know how to handle it before it damages Blackwood Industries' reputation."

"Delete it." Nathan's voice was flat. "Make sure nothing remains. Cassandra's personal issues won't affect the company."

"Yes, sir!"

Returning to Cliffside Manor in the early hours, Nathan found Agnes waiting in her nightgown, worry lines creasing her face.

"Agnes, I told you not to wait up for me." Despite his exhaustion, warmth bloomed in his chest. Agnes had been like a second mother to him since childhood.

"Nathan, there's warm food in the kitchen," Agnes fretted. "And please, for once, try to get some proper sleep. These late nights are making your migraines worse."

She sighed heavily. "If only Young Madam were still here. She took such good care of you these past three years. That poor girl worked herself to the bone for you - it breaks my heart to see how much she's suffered."
###Chapter 100

Agnes Thornton stood with her hands clasped, her wise old eyes filled with sorrow. "Master Nathan, some blessings aren't meant to last. The young mistress was never destined to stay by your side."

Nathan Blackwood felt the world tilt beneath his feet. In his mind's eye, Evelyn Carter's luminous gaze haunted him - those clear, innocent eyes shimmering with unspoken hurt.

He would never again experience her tender care. The hollow ache in his chest betrayed his denial.

"Evelyn wasn't my blessing," he rasped, fingers digging into his palms. "She was my reckoning."

Storming into the master bedroom, his gaze fell upon an elegant box resting on the mahogany coffee table. The crest of Celestial Atelier gleamed in gold leaf - the tailor shop where Evelyn had taken his suits.

Heart pounding, he tore open the packaging. The bespoke suit lay perfectly pressed, its lining meticulously restored. Not a single stitch marred the flawless surface.

His lips curled in reluctant admiration.

"I see you still care for the young mistress's gifts," Agnes observed, her wrinkled face lighting with hope.

"It's an expensive suit," Nathan countered stiffly, running fingers over the crisp fabric. "Waste is unacceptable."

Agnes sighed, her shoulders slumping. "That woman poured her soul into everything concerning you, Master Nathan. Not just this suit." She gestured toward the door. "Come."

They entered the now-vacant guest suite - Evelyn's former sanctuary. Agnes opened a discreet closet, revealing shelves stacked with meticulously arranged gift boxes of every size.

Nathan froze. "What—"

"Three years' worth of gifts," Agnes whispered. "Birthdays. Anniversaries. Even the date of your first meeting." Her voice broke. "She marked every occasion, knowing you'd reject them. As if... as if proving her love to herself."

Nathan's vision blurred. His chest constricted painfully.

"Victoria Sterling's devotion pales beside Evelyn's," Agnes continued fiercely. "I'll never accept another mistress in this house."

Her wrinkled hands trembled with outrage. "That auction business—selling the wine you crafted with your own hands! How could Victoria's family treat your gift so callously? Why didn't she stop them?"

"Enough!" Nathan barked.

But Agnes persisted, her whisper shaking. "Do you know how Evelyn coveted that vintage? She wept for nights when she learned you'd gifted it to Victoria."

Nathan's breath hitched. His fists clenched until his knuckles whitened.

Evelyn... cried? The proud heiress reduced to tears over a bottle of wine?

Agnes produced an ornate lacquered box from the cabinet. When she lifted the lid, Nathan's blood turned to ice.

Inside lay a collection of forgotten treasures - a lost cufflink, discarded ties, even an antique lighter he'd abandoned years ago. Each item polished and preserved with reverent care.

"Evelyn would sooner die than sell your gifts," Agnes said bitterly. "She cherished even your castoffs."

"Victoria didn't know about the auction," Nathan defended hoarsely, though the words tasted like ash. "She'd never—"

"There's an old saying," Agnes interrupted with a sad smile. "You can't wake someone pretending to sleep."

With that, she departed, leaving Nathan drowning in the wreckage of his choices.

The revelation struck like thunder - Evelyn's three-year masquerade. Not the perfect, unflappable society wife, but a woman who burned with jealousy, who raged in silence, who loved so fiercely it broke her.

If her devotion ran so deep... how could she walk away without looking back?

Nathan's jaw tightened. His stormy eyes burned with furious denial.
###Chapter 101

The golden morning light spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting warm patterns across the silk sheets.

Evelyn stirred beneath the luxurious duvet, stretching her toned limbs like a contented feline. The soft fabric slid off her shoulder as she arched her back in a lazy morning stretch.

She slipped into a sleek white athleisure set, the tailored fabric hugging her curves perfectly. The private lake behind Cliffside Manor glittered invitingly as she carried her custom carbon fiber kayak toward the water.

Theodore stood waiting at the dock, impeccably dressed as always. His right hand held a chilled bottle of electrolyte water while a plush Egyptian cotton towel draped over his left forearm.

"All digital traces of Cassandra's outburst have been erased from social media," Theodore reported. "Search algorithms have been adjusted to suppress any related keywords."

Evelyn accepted the towel with a nod, droplets of lake water glistening on her sun-kissed skin. She took a long sip from the proffered bottle, her throat moving gracefully with each swallow.

"The Blackwood PR machine never sleeps," she remarked, wiping her damp forehead. "Nathan must have mobilized their entire legal team overnight."

Theodore's eyebrows shot up. "Nathan Blackwood personally ordered the takedowns?"

A wry smile played on Evelyn's lips as she tilted her head back, exposing the elegant column of her neck. Sunlight caught in the droplets clinging to her collarbones.

"Self-preservation is human nature," she mused, dabbing at her lips with the towel. "If only I'd first encountered him across a boardroom instead of a ballroom..." Her voice trailed off, heavy with unspoken regret.

The moment hung between them, filled with the weight of what might have been.

"How do you intend to proceed?" Theodore asked gently.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened, the morning's softness giving way to steely determination. "Our housekeeper at Kingsley Medical Center - she hasn't been discharged yet?"

After concluding their morning meetings at Monarch Grand Hotels, Evelyn changed into a sophisticated navy pantsuit before heading to the hospital.

Skylar Bennett sat up abruptly when Evelyn entered the general ward, her hospital gown rustling with the sudden movement. "Ms. Kingsley! I didn't expect—"

"Please, don't get up." Evelyn pressed a gentle hand on Skylar's shoulder. "Your health comes first."

Tears welled in Skylar's eyes. "I'm so sorry about the incident. I never knew about my condition—"

Evelyn perched on the edge of the bed. "Your medical records show this was your first seizure. There's nothing to apologize for."

"But the hospital bills—"

"Will be covered as a workplace injury," Evelyn said firmly. Then her expression turned serious. "Skylar, I need to ask - what would you like to see happen regarding Cassandra Blackwood?"

Skylar's fingers twisted in the sheets. "What can someone like me do against the Blackwood heiress? The videos disappeared overnight. Money silences everything."

Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Blackwood Industries may have bought your silence, but I won't." She leaned forward. "If you want Cassandra to apologize, we'll need to make waves. But this will put you in the public eye—"

"Just a private apology would be enough," Skylar whispered.

Evelyn shook her head. "She humiliated you publicly. The apology should match the offense." Theodore added quietly, "Public pressure is the only language people like Cassandra understand."

Skylar shrank back. "I don't want to cause trouble for the hotel..."

Evelyn's smile was razor-sharp. "If Cassandra retaliates, she'll only dig her own grave." She took Skylar's hand. "Trust me. I won't let my employees suffer injustice."

As Evelyn strode from the ward, her heels clicked a determined rhythm against the polished floors. Nathan Blackwood wouldn't sweep this under the rug - not if she had anything to say about it.
###Chapter 102

Evelyn didn't care about the divorce, but she would never allow herself to lose in business.

Stepping out of the hospital ward, she slid on her sunglasses, shielding the storm of emotions swirling in her eyes.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen as she dialed her fourth brother.

"Maxwell! Finally remembered your favorite brother exists?" His voice dripped with exaggerated hurt. "Do you know how much Sebastian laughed at me? Said you've been ignoring me. I nearly lost my mind—I can't let that smug bastard win!"

"You're all my brothers. Why are you acting like you need to compete for my attention?"

A brief pause. Then, softer, she added, "Maxwell... can you help me with something?"

"Help? Help?! Oh no, it's worse than I thought." His dramatic gasp crackled through the line. "You're saying please now? We're officially estranged. I'm booking the next flight home. Two more years away and you'll forget what my gorgeous face looks like!"

"Maxwell, cut the act!" Evelyn snapped, loud enough that passing nurses shot her startled glances.

A beautiful woman with a temper like a wildfire—what a sight.

"Ah, there's my little sister." He chuckled, satisfied. "Now, what do you need?"

Her voice dropped, dark and deliberate. "I'm releasing a video tomorrow. I need you to make sure it stays online—no matter who tries to take it down."

"How long?"

"Until it's everywhere."

"Easy. But..." His tone turned teasing, dangerously smooth. "Shouldn't you thank me properly?"

"What do you want?"

"I want to punch Nathan in the face. Just once. For old times' sake."

Evelyn's eye twitched.

"Go to hell."

The next morning at Blackwood Industries, Nathan sat at the head of the conference table, his presence icy and commanding.

Every executive sat straighter under his gaze.

"The Westridge project bids close in forty-eight hours. I want flawless coordination—no mistakes."

Mid-sentence, a muffled gasp cut through the room. A junior executive stared at his phone, paling, then elbowed his neighbor.

Like wildfire, the news spread. Within seconds, the entire room buzzed with hushed shock.

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. "Am I interrupting your social hour?"

Then his own phone vibrated.

He tapped the screen—and his blood turned to ice.

Post-meeting, Nathan stormed into his office, his fury a living thing.

"I thought you deleted that video. Why is Cassandra's name trending again?"

Oliver wiped his brow. "It was reuploaded at dawn. PR didn’t have time to react. We’ve contacted the platform, but..."

"But?"

"It... won’t delete."

Nathan’s knuckles whitened around his pen. "You’re joking."

"I’ve never seen anything like it. The platform says their system is locked—they can’t remove it."

"Then buy the platform. I want Evelyn Carter’s name erased from every social media site in thirty minutes."

Oliver hesitated, then handed over his phone with a shaky hand. "Sir... look at this."

The top trending tag had just been overtaken by a new one:

#AngelSavingStaff

Nathan clicked the link—and his world tilted.

There, in crisp high definition, was Evelyn, kneeling beside a collapsed hotel employee, her face etched with fierce determination as she performed CPR.

The camera had captured every second.

Every. Damn. Second.

His chest tightened inexplicably.

His ex-wife was now the internet’s darling.

And there wasn’t a thing he could do about it.
###Chapter 103

The atmosphere in the executive office of Monarch Grand Hotels was thick with tension.

Evelyn stood motionless before the panoramic windows, her slender silhouette framed against the city skyline. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished marble floor.

"Who authorized the release of that footage?"

Her voice cut through the silence like shards of ice.

"You said we needed public attention," Theodore countered, his jaw clenched.

Theodore Winslow stood rigid behind her, his usually composed features darkened with unease.

"As my personal assistant and childhood friend, you of all people should know my boundaries!" Evelyn spun around, her emerald eyes flashing.

She took a measured step forward. "I recognize your intentions were good, but you let personal bias cloud your judgment. You wanted to manufacture public sympathy by contrasting my actions with Cassandra's scandal."

Theodore's shoulders slumped with each accusation.

Every word struck true, leaving him defenseless.

"I don't need that kind of publicity."

Evelyn's tone dropped dangerously. "Assisting an employee during a medical emergency was basic human decency. I won't manipulate public perception to humiliate Cassandra, no matter how much I dislike her."

She crossed her arms. "True kindness loses its meaning when performed for an audience."

"I apologize, Ms. Carter. I only thought—"

"Your thoughts are irrelevant."

Evelyn reached for her phone with deliberate calm. "I'm calling Sebastian. You're being reassigned immediately. This isn't how we operate."

"No, please!"

Theodore's face drained of color. In two quick strides, he caught her wrist. "Punish me however you see fit—demote me to janitorial staff, dock my salary, anything! Just don't send me away."

Evelyn winced at the pressure on her wrist.

But the desperation in his gaze unsettled her more than the physical contact.

The Winslows were legal aristocracy—his father a Supreme Court justice, mother a celebrated attorney, both brothers prominent prosecutors. Though not obscenely wealthy, the family commanded immense respect in Fairhaven society.

Yet Theodore had chosen to serve as her personal assistant when he could have had any prestigious legal career.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "This is your last warning."

"Thank you! I swear I'll consult you before making any decisions moving forward!" Theodore's entire demeanor brightened, his relief palpable.

"And control your hands." Evelyn arched an eyebrow pointedly.

Only then did Theodore realize he still gripped her wrist. He released her as if burned, his cheeks flushing crimson.

Her warmth lingered on his fingertips.

"So how do we handle the viral video?"

"I'll have Maxwell manage damage control. Now fetch my blazer."

Evelyn gestured to the tailored jacket hanging nearby. Theodore sprang into action, draping it over her shoulders with practiced care.

"Let's go. Cassandra's waiting."

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood penthouse, Cassandra was spiraling into panic.

"Mother! That peasant is sabotaging me again!" she shrieked into her phone, pacing before floor-length mirrors. "I finally got media attention, and now Evelyn's stealing the spotlight with her pathetic charity act!"
###Chapter 104

"Are you out of your mind? Don't you understand why this scandal went viral? Instead of feeling remorse, you're actually proud of yourself?"

Penelope's furious voice crackled through the phone.

Cassandra Blackwood massaged her temples in irritation. Of course she wasn't as foolish as her mother implied. Her distraction stemmed from seeing Evelyn Carter's rescue trending simultaneously.

"What am I supposed to do now? This negative publicity is disastrous." Cassandra paced her boutique's private lounge. "Especially with that country bumpkin stealing my spotlight!"

"I've already informed your father. His instructions are clear - maintain radio silence. No public statements."

Penelope lowered her voice. "Nathan will handle this. Blackwood Industries' reputation is at stake. Stay calm and don't do anything rash. Understood?"

Somewhat reassured, Cassandra ended the call and resumed shopping with the two socialites who'd accompanied her to the hotel incident.

Outside Éclat Boutique, a Phantom Rolls-Royce glided to a silent stop.

Evelyn Carter emerged, her sapphire couture suit shimmering under the afternoon sun. Theodore Winslow followed precisely two steps behind.

Every employee's attention snapped to Evelyn as she entered. Her effortless elegance and commanding presence made even the air seem to still.

"Good afternoon, madam. How may we assist you today?" A sales associate rushed forward, completely overlooking the striking secretary.

"Fetch your owner, Cassandra Blackwood." Evelyn's voice carried glacial precision. "I require her personal attention."

The associate hesitated. "I'm afraid Ms. Blackwood is—"

"I know she's upstairs." Evelyn examined her manicure. "And she'll regret keeping me waiting."

"May I have your name?"

A dangerous smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Tell her Ms. Carter requests her presence."

Upstairs, Cassandra nearly shattered a crystal vase when informed. "That scheming witch dares come here?"

Her friend Amelia Thornton grabbed her arm. "That viral video was definitely her doing! She's probably here to gloat."

"Perfect timing!" chimed Beatrice Whitmore. "Let's put that gold-digger in her place once and for all!"

Flanked by her allies, Cassandra stormed downstairs with theatrical fury.

"Evelyn! You shameless—"

She froze mid-sentence.

Evelyn lounged in a velvet chair, sipping Darjeeling from bone china. Her crossed legs accentuated the razor-sharp crease of her trousers. The legendary "Aurora's Tear" brooch glittered at her collar.

"Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn set down her cup with deliberate calm, "is this how you greet patrons? Such language hardly befits a luxury establishment."

"Patron?" Cassandra's manicured finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "You're just a social climber seducing my brother for our fortune!"

The staff exchanged shocked glances. No one believed this poised goddess could be a gold digger - not with that seven-figure brooch and regal bearing.

"Let's be clear." Evelyn stood, towering over Cassandra in her Louboutins. "I wouldn't buy your third-rate merchandise if you paid me."

Cassandra's retort died when she recognized the brooch's significance.

"My purpose is simple." Evelyn produced a legal document. "You will hold a press conference apologizing to my hotel employee - the one you assaulted and hospitalized."

She leaned closer, her whisper carrying lethal sweetness. "Or I'll release security footage showing exactly how...ungracefully you behaved that night."
###Chapter 105

"Did you actually just ask me to apologize to that maid?" Cassandra's laughter rang through the boutique like shattering glass. "Have you lost your mind completely?"

She clutched her stomach, doubling over with exaggerated mirth. Her two sycophantic friends, Amelia and Beatrice, joined in the cruel chorus, their designer-clad shoulders shaking with performative amusement.

"That lowly employee ruined my shopping experience at your hotel!" Cassandra pointed an accusatory finger, her French manicure flashing under the boutique lights. "She broke my necklace and treated me like some common customer. I had every right to put her in her place!"

"Exactly!" Amelia chimed in, flipping her highlighted hair. "Who do you think you are, demanding an apology? This isn't some backwater village market - this is Éclat Boutique!"

Theodore's lips twitched. If these airheaded socialites knew every Monarch Grand Hotel in the country belonged to the woman they were insulting, they'd probably faint from sheer terror.

"Aren't you concerned about tarnishing Blackwood Industries' reputation?" Evelyn's voice remained deceptively calm. "Your brother worked hard to build that company's prestige. Do you really want to be the one who destroys it?"

Cassandra rolled her eyes so dramatically I feared they might get stuck. "Spare me the lecture. I'm not the CEO - that's Nathan's cross to bear. If Father wanted me to care about corporate image, he would've made me president instead of that bastard."

The boutique staff exchanged shocked glances. Even the mannequins seemed to recoil at the venom in her words.

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. The Blackwood family's facade of unity was just that - a carefully constructed illusion. Behind closed doors, they were vipers in a gilded cage, each waiting for the right moment to strike.

"Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said silkily, "if corporate reputation means nothing to you, perhaps your personal standing in society does? The Montgomery family values discretion in their future daughter-in-law, don't they?"

Cassandra's perfectly contoured face paled. "How dare you threaten me! Just because you've got Sebastian Kingsley wrapped around your finger doesn't mean you can intimidate me!" She whirled toward the security team. "Remove this peasant from my store immediately! She's contaminating the air with her poverty!"

Two guards advanced, but Theodore moved with lethal grace. His black belt in Krav Maga made short work of their pathetic attempts. The takedown was so elegant several salesgirls actually sighed.

"Since reasoning fails," Evelyn said, withdrawing her phone, "perhaps visual aids will succeed." She beckoned Cassandra closer. "Come, let me show you something... enlightening."

Cassandra hesitated, pride warring with curiosity. Finally, she stomped forward - only to recoil as if struck when she saw the screen. "That's impossible! I paid those photographers triple to destroy those photos!"

Evelyn scrolled through the incriminating images with deliberate slowness. "My terms are simple. Public apology to my employee, and these disappear forever. Refuse..." She pocketed the phone with finality. "Well, you're intelligent enough to imagine the consequences."

Cassandra's breathing turned ragged. These photos could destroy her carefully cultivated image, her engagement to Julian Montgomery, everything. With a shriek, she lunged for the phone.

Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly. Cassandra crashed onto a velvet chaise, her designer dress riding up unflatteringly. Humiliation burned through her as she raised a trembling hand to strike.

The resounding slap echoed through the boutique like a gunshot.

Gasps erupted as five crimson fingerprints bloomed across Cassandra's surgically-enhanced cheekbone. The strike had been so fast no one saw Evelyn's hand move.

Theodore bit back a grin. That's my boss.

Cassandra's so-called friends had retreated behind a clothing rack, their loyalty evaporating faster than champagne bubbles.

"You... you hit me?" Cassandra touched her stinging cheek in disbelief. "Do you know who I am?"

"I do," Evelyn said coolly. "You're the woman who's about to apologize to my employee. Unless you'd prefer these photos circulating at Julian's birthday gala next week?"

The blood drained from Cassandra's face. In that moment, she finally understood - she wasn't dealing with some naive upstart. She'd challenged a queen in her own court. And lost.
###Chapter 106

Evelyn tilted her head, her crimson lips curling into a mocking smile. "Or what? Should I wait for a rabid creature like you to sink its teeth into me first?"

She casually brushed her hands together as if wiping away dirt.

Cassandra's face twisted in fury. "How dare you compare me to some wild animal?!"

The boutique door chimed open.

Evelyn lifted her lashes—and froze.

Nathan Blackwood stood framed in the entrance, his towering presence silencing the room. Their eyes locked, an electric current crackling between them.

Neither had expected this collision of worlds.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. She looked through him as if he were a stranger on the street.

Nathan's jaw tightened. The woman who once gazed at him with stars in her eyes now regarded him with empty indifference. It unsettled him more than he cared to admit.

"Nathan!" Cassandra scrambled up, crocodile tears already spilling. "Thank God you're here! Evelyn assaulted me—just look at my face!"

"I did." Evelyn's smirk deepened. "Her cheek still carries the imprint of my hand. Care to inspect it?"

Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Shopping. Or does that require your permission now?"

The Evelyn he once knew would have softened under his scrutiny. This version stared back with the detachment of a marble statue.

Cassandra seized Nathan's arm. "She's blackmailing me! Demanding I publicly apologize to some hotel nobody! When I refused—"

"Let me guess," Nathan cut in coldly. "You've already caused enough damage with that viral video. Now you want a press conference too?" His gaze hardened. "Know your limits."

Theodore bristled but Evelyn stopped him with a subtle hand. She stepped forward, eyes dark as loaded gun barrels.

"Justice has no limits, Nathan. Only cowards think otherwise."

A muscle ticked in Nathan's jaw. "This isn't justice. It's a power play for Sebastian Kingsley."

"Then we're done here." Evelyn pivoted on her stilettos, the dismissal absolute.

"Wait!" Cassandra panicked. Those photos—

"Nathan, she's fabricated compromising pictures! She's trying to ruin me!"

Nathan moved like lightning, snatching Evelyn's phone from her grasp.

Cassandra exhaled in relief. Shannon was right—Nathan remained their most useful pawn.

"Give that back!" Evelyn lunged, her manicured nails grazing his wrist.

In her haste, her heel caught on the carpet. Nathan caught her against his chest, her body molding perfectly against his. The contact sent heat rushing to Evelyn's cheeks.

Through the fine cotton of his shirt, she felt every defined ridge of his torso. Damn him for still being sculpted like a Greek god.

Nathan kept one arm locked around her waist while his thumb flew across her screen. He recalled her old passcode—0923, their anniversary.

The phone unlocked.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Those photos weren't the only secrets in her gallery.
###Chapter 107

"You bastard! Give that back!" Evelyn shrieked, her face flushed crimson as she clung desperately to Nathan's towering frame.

Her left hand gripped his broad shoulder for balance while her legs scrambled against him like a frantic kitten trying to climb a tree.

Nathan's arms tightened around her waist with unexpected possessiveness, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

Through the delicate silk of his dress shirt, Evelyn could feel the scorching heat radiating from his muscular body against her palm.

Yet Nathan remained completely focused on her phone, his chiseled features as impassive as a marble statue in meditation.

The boutique erupted in gasps as witnesses saw Evelyn cursing at the notoriously ruthless Nathan Blackwood - who showed no signs of anger.

Theodore broke into a cold sweat, desperately trying to pull Evelyn back but unable to reach her through the tense standoff.

Cassandra stood frozen, her mouth agape. The couple had never been this physically close during their marriage - why were they practically embracing after divorce?

Cassandra's socialite friends glared daggers at Evelyn, their manicured nails digging into their palms with barely contained jealousy.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly as he swiftly deleted every compromising photo of Cassandra from Evelyn's phone.

"Evelyn, must you resort to such underhanded tactics now that we're divorced?" His deep voice rumbled like distant thunder.

With calculated precision, he slipped the phone back into her pocket and released his grip on her waist.

"Underhanded? That's rich coming from you!" Evelyn scoffed, hastily putting distance between them while brushing imaginary dirt from her clothes.

"I obtained those photos through legitimate means, unlike you, Mr. Blackwood. When you couldn't outmaneuver me, you resorted to petty theft. You're nothing but a common thug in an Armani suit!"

Nearby sales associates stifled giggles, thinking to themselves that he was undoubtedly the most devastatingly handsome "thug" they'd ever seen.

Nathan's expression darkened, his lips pressing into a thin, dangerous line.

Being called a thug in public stung his pride, but what cut deeper was the undisguised revulsion in Evelyn's eyes - she was slipping further away.

Just how much did she despise him now?

Since their divorce papers were signed, she'd become a constant thorn in his side. He'd shown remarkable restraint until now, only for her to publicly humiliate him.

A volatile mix of fury and something dangerously close to hurt surged through Nathan. In one fluid motion, he closed the distance between them, looming over her with predatory intensity.

"Evelyn," he growled, his voice low enough that only she could hear, "the only reason you dare treat me this way is because you were once my wife. Do you truly believe our past marriage gives you license to test my patience indefinitely? Not even Victoria would dare cross me like this. What makes you so bold?"

Evelyn's eyes burned crimson with barely contained rage.

For three long years, Nathan had refused to meet her gaze, systematically crushing her confidence through sheer indifference. Yet even then, she'd never regretted loving him or being his wife.

But standing here now, Evelyn felt the first bitter seeds of regret taking root.

A hollow laugh escaped her lips as she forcibly blinked away the telltale shimmer in her eyes. "Victoria doesn't dare because she cares about you. I dare because you mean absolutely nothing to me anymore."

Nathan's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Before he could react, Evelyn seized his platinum silk tie in a white-knuckled grip, yanking him down to her level.

"Do you expect gratitude for that farce of a marriage? Let me make this perfectly clear - I regret every single second of it."

Their faces were now mere inches apart, close enough to share breath.

As the tie constricted around his neck, Nathan felt an unfamiliar tightness in his chest at the sheer hatred radiating from her gaze.

"To be brutally honest," Evelyn continued through clenched teeth, "I can barely stomach remembering those three wasted years. Did you honestly think being your wife was some grand privilege? That I should proudly announce to the world I was once Mrs. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 108

"No." Evelyn's voice was ice-cold. "You overestimate your importance. If I could, I'd erase every trace of you from my existence."

Her next words struck like daggers. "I wish I'd never loved you at all."

Nathan's pupils contracted violently. The words hit him with physical force, leaving his throat parched and burning.

Each syllable from her lips was sharper than the last.

By the time he regained his composure, Evelyn had already released his tie and strode past without a backward glance.

Theodore shot Nathan a venomous glare as he hurried after Evelyn. Though he hadn't heard their exchange, the tension between them spoke volumes.

"Nathan! Did you delete those photos?" Cassandra's shrill voice cut through the boutique. "That country bumpkin had the audacity to threaten me! Thank goodness you intervened before she could ruin our family's reputation!"

She reached for Nathan's arm, eager to flaunt their closeness, but recoiled at the glacial fury in his eyes.

"Were those photos actually doctored?" Nathan's question hung in the air like a guillotine.

Cassandra froze. "What?"

"Otherwise, why would Evelyn blackmail you?" His piercing gaze demanded truth.

Cassandra's blood ran cold. For the first time, she realized Nathan wasn't unquestioningly on her side.

His loyalty still belonged to Evelyn.

"I witnessed the incident myself," Nathan stated coldly. "You'll hold a press conference tomorrow night to apologize to the hotel staff."

"Apologize?!" Cassandra's face twisted in outrage. "I'm the paying customer! Their incompetent staff broke my necklace! Why should I—"

Her tirade was interrupted as the boutique's second-floor screen flickered to life.

Security footage from Monarch Grand Hotels played in crisp detail, capturing everyone's attention. The video showed Cassandra's two socialite friends preening before the elevator's mirrored doors.

"Ugh, Cassandra's insufferable since buying that tacky necklace," one friend sneered off-camera. "We only tolerate her because she pays for everything."

The other giggled maliciously. "The look on her face when she couldn't find it! Little does she know we hid it in the suite after breaking the clasp!"

The color drained from both women's faces as the footage ended. Cassandra advanced on them like a vengeful fury, her designer heels clicking ominously.

"Cass, it's not what it looks like!" they stammered, backing away. "Someone edited that!"

"You treacherous vipers!" Cassandra shrieked, abandoning all pretense of elegance. "After everything I've done for you!"

With a primal scream, she launched herself at her former friends, manicured nails bared like claws.
###Chapter 109

Evelyn slid into the car seat, her body stiff with tension.

The silence between them was thick enough to cut with a knife.

She felt numb, like a puppet with its strings severed.

Nathan's cruel words echoed in her mind, sending a chill down her spine.

Her hands trembled with barely contained fury.

How had she never seen the true depths of his deceit?

Love truly was blind—blinding her to the monster he'd always been.

"Ms. Carter, the video has been released as you instructed. Look—Cassandra and her friends are tearing each other apart!"

Theodore eagerly shoved his phone in front of her.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, watching the three women claw at each other like feral cats.

The sight was brutal.

"Tsk. Women really don’t hold back when they fight, do they? Ms. Blackwood is holding her own—two against one, and she’s still standing. Shame she never took up wrestling professionally."

Theodore smirked, clearly enjoying the spectacle.

Evelyn scoffed. "They’re just pulling hair and slapping like children. No skill, no finesse. Where’s the entertainment in that?"

Yet her eyes remained glued to the screen.

Admittedly, watching Cassandra unravel was satisfying.

"Ms. Carter… did Nathan really delete all the photos?"

Theodore’s jaw clenched at the memory of Nathan’s hands on Evelyn’s waist.

But then he remembered—they’d been married.

Of course Nathan had touched her before.

The thought made his stomach twist.

"He’ll delete them. Even if he despises Cassandra, he won’t risk the Blackwood name. He always prioritizes reputation over everything else."

Evelyn sighed, unlocking her phone.

She hadn’t expected Nathan to remember her passcode.

Had he been watching her that closely all those years ago?

But it didn’t matter.

He’d never understand the meaning behind those digits—0923.

The day he’d saved her on the mountain thirteen years ago.

The day they’d first met.

To him, it was probably just another number.

"Ms. Carter, what’s our next move? Without those photos, Cassandra won’t back down." Theodore frowned.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Her call history showed Nathan’s number.

That sneaky bastard.

That evening, Nathan returned to Cliffside Manor.

Raindrops streaked the car window like tears.

For a moment, he saw Evelyn’s glistening eyes staring back at him—filled with nothing but resentment.

The memory made his chest tighten.

He rolled his neck, the neon lights outside casting sharp shadows across his jawline.

His fingers absently tugged at his tie, the silk smooth against his skin—

Just like the curve of Evelyn’s waist beneath his hands.

His breath hitched.

He needed to stop thinking about her.

But he couldn’t.

Three years of marriage, and she’d barely dared to touch him.

Now?

She provoked him in public without hesitation.

Disrespectful. Infuriating. Unforgettable.

"Mr. Blackwood…" Oliver’s hesitant voice cut through his thoughts.

"What?" Nathan snapped.

"The incident with Cassandra at Monarch Grand Hotel is trending. The public is outraged—accusing elites of abusing their power. How should we handle this?"

"Let it burn."

"But… Madam Whitmore might involve Chairman Leonard. He’ll make things difficult for you."

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Since when have I ever been afraid of him?"

Oliver’s phone buzzed.

"Sir, the surveillance footage you requested."

Nathan took the device, watching the confrontation between Evelyn and Cassandra unfold.

Cassandra, arrogant and vicious, had raised her hand first—

Only for Evelyn to strike back without hesitation.
###Chapter 110

Nathan's aristocratic features tightened as his dark brows drew together. His chiseled jawline could have been carved from marble, so cold was his expression.

The simmering anger he'd felt earlier paled in comparison to the volcanic rage coursing through him now.

Nathan had barely stepped through the doors of Cliffside Manor and changed into fresh clothes when Leonard summoned him to the study.

"Daddy! You have to make this right!" Cassandra's wails filled the opulent room. "I've been humiliated beyond endurance!"

Tears streamed down Cassandra's face, soaking Leonard's custom-tailored shirt. Angry red scratches marred her porcelain skin from her earlier altercation, and her bottom lip bore a noticeable split.

Leonard sat rigidly on the leather sofa. His daughter, who normally carried herself with impeccable grace, now resembled a disheveled mess. His fingers twitched toward her, smoothing back her tangled blonde locks.

"Your brother will handle this when he arrives."

Penelope wrung her hands, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "This scandal is spreading like wildfire. I've fielded six calls today alone about Cassandra's behavior. What will Crestview's elite think of us now?"

"Leonard, our daughter's reputation is being dragged through the mud!" Penelope's voice cracked. "How can she show her face in society after this?"

"Penelope, calm yourself. I won't let our daughter suffer this injustice."

Leonard's thunderous expression darkened further as the study doors swung open. Nathan entered with measured steps, his face an unreadable mask.

"Nathan! Why wasn't that damning footage contained immediately?" Leonard barked, tightening his grip around Cassandra's shoulders. "As CEO of Blackwood Industries, do you consider this acceptable?"

"Blackwood Industries maintains both PR and legal departments. Each with competent directors."

Nathan's voice remained steady, though his glacial gaze betrayed his irritation. "While I oversee operations, I'm not a babysitter. Certain matters fall outside my purview."

"How can you say that?" Penelope's hand flew to her chest dramatically. "Cassandra is your flesh and blood! Will you stand by while some commoner destroys your sister's good name?"

"Penelope, your constitution is delicate. Don't overexert yourself."

Leonard sprang to his feet, wrapping a protective arm around his wife's slender frame. The tender concern in his eyes made Nathan's stomach churn.

Twenty years. Two decades of enduring these sickening displays of affection while his own mother's memory gathered dust.

Not once had Leonard visited Deborah's grave. Not a single mention of the woman who had loved him unconditionally. The deliberate erasure cut deeper than hatred ever could.

"I'm fine, darling." Penelope leaned into Leonard's embrace with practiced fragility, punctuating her words with delicate coughs. "I spoke out of turn. Nathan has corporate matters weighing on him. I shouldn't burden him further." Her voice dropped to a wounded whisper. "Though I can't help but wonder... if he resents me for not being his real mother..."

Nathan observed the performance with detached amusement. How Leonard failed to see through this decades-long charade baffled him.

"Don't entertain such thoughts." Leonard's face flushed with indignation. "You're my wife, and that makes you his mother whether he acknowledges it or not!"

Having successfully baited her husband, Penelope watched with satisfaction as Leonard rounded on Nathan.

"I want every trace of this scandal erased by dawn!" Leonard jabbed an accusatory finger. "Or you'll answer to me!"

"The solution was proposed hours ago." Nathan's icy gaze dropped to his sister. "Cassandra knows precisely what needs to be done."

"Father!" Cassandra jerked upright, her tear-streaked face twisting in outrage. "Nathan's solution is outrageous! He expects me to grovel before some insignificant maid!" Her manicured nails dug into the sofa cushions. "And that vile Evelyn actually struck me today in front of half of Crestview's elite!"

Penelope gasped. "Evelyn laid hands on you?"

"Look at my face! The evidence speaks for itself!" Cassandra pointed to the faint red mark still visible on her cheek.

"The audacity!" Penelope's carefully cultivated poise shattered. "We'll press charges immediately! She can't assault a Blackwood and walk away unscathed!"

"Cassandra initiated the physical altercation." Nathan's voice cut through the hysteria. "Evelyn acted in self-defense."

Leonard's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Are you telling me that woman actually struck my daughter?"

Nathan's silence confirmed the truth.

"Contact that wretched girl at once!" Leonard's command echoed off the mahogany walls. "I want a public apology delivered to Cassandra by nightfall! And why hasn't your divorce been finalized yet? First thing tomorrow, you're marching down to City Hall to end this farce!" His fist slammed against the desk. "I forbid any further association with that woman!"

Nathan's jaw clenched.

The divorce was inevitable. Yet hearing it demanded so bluntly sent an unexpected ripple of discomfort through him.

"No."

The word left his lips before he could stop it.
###Chapter 111

No?!

Cassandra and Penelope froze at Nathan's refusal, their tearful act forgotten mid-performance.

Nathan Blackwood, you insolent brat! Leonard's blood pressure spiked dangerously.

His illegitimate son—the one he'd never favored—had rarely dared to defy him. Now, as CEO of Blackwood Industries, Nathan had the audacity to refuse him outright.

Nathan himself was startled by how easily the word had slipped out.

What the hell are you thinking?! Leonard roared. You were the one who wanted to divorce Evelyn! You insisted on marrying Victoria! And now, when I demand you finalize the divorce immediately, you say no?! Do you think you can keep multiple women like some kind of playboy? Marriage isn’t a game!

How did I raise such a disgrace?!

Keep multiple women? Nathan's lips curled into a cold smirk. Well, Father, since we’re family, I suppose I should follow your example.

You bastard!

Leonard lunged forward and struck Nathan hard across the face.

The sharp crack of the slap made Cassandra flinch.

A vivid red mark bloomed on Nathan’s pale cheek.

Leonard! Penelope rushed to his side, her voice dripping with false concern. Talk to him, don’t resort to violence! Nathan’s just impulsive—he didn’t mean to offend you! It’s not worth damaging your relationship over this!

Inside, she was gloating. Seeing Nathan humiliated was exactly what she wanted.

Penelope, I know you’ve always treated him like your own, but you’ve spoiled him rotten! Look at him now—arrogant, disrespectful! Leonard’s palm stung from the force of the blow, his face flushed with fury.

He’ll always be my child, Leonard. Besides… She lowered her eyes, feigning vulnerability. I’m not his real mother. If I weren’t kind to him, he’d never accept me. I just wanted to be a good mother.

Every word was a carefully placed dagger, disguised as submission.

Nathan scoffed. He’d seen through Penelope’s act since childhood—but he’d never bothered to expose her.

Because he knew Leonard didn’t care. If his older brother hadn’t been recovering in Silvercrest, Nathan would never have been handed Blackwood Industries.

Leonard had never favored him. Nothing he did mattered.

A child? He’s thirty! Stop making excuses for him!

Leonard jabbed a finger at Nathan’s face. You will do two things for me—now. Finalize the divorce with Evelyn and make her apologize to Cassandra in person. And suppress that scandal online immediately.

Nathan’s smile turned icy. Father, is this how you negotiate business? Slap first, demand later?

What—what did you just say?!

Even if you’re my father, business and personal matters should remain separate—especially when it affects the company. I won’t agree to your terms. Evelyn and I can’t divorce yet. I promised Grandfather we’d wait until his eightieth birthday. I won’t break that promise.

As for the scandal? His gaze flicked to Cassandra. She should issue a public apology. I won’t interfere.

Nathan! You—

Leonard’s face darkened. He raised his hand again—but this time, Nathan caught his wrist mid-swing.

Father, I’m thirty now. Do you really think you can still beat me into submission? Nathan’s voice was glacial.

Leonard’s eyes narrowed. A sharp pain shot through his wrist.
###Chapter 112

"No! I refuse to apologize! Never!" Cassandra's shrill voice echoed through the study as tears streamed down her flushed cheeks.

Nathan watched impassively as his half-sister threw another tantrum.

"Oliver," he called sharply.

The door opened immediately as Oliver Sinclair entered, bowing respectfully. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Show the chairman the documents."

Oliver hesitated for just a fraction of second before handing the prepared files to Leonard Blackwood.

Leonard frowned. "What's this?"

"The financial reports for Éclat Boutique over the past two years," Nathan explained coolly. "Managed jointly by Penelope and Cassandra."

Penelope Whitmore's grip tightened on Leonard's arm, her perfectly manicured nails digging into his sleeve.

"Three years of operation," Nathan continued, "and nearly ten million in losses annually. All funded by Blackwood Industries' public accounts." His icy gaze swept over them. "The original agreement stated Penelope would be responsible for profits and losses. Since the company gains nothing, we shouldn't be covering these deficits."

Cassandra paled, her earlier defiance crumbling.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "If Cassandra refuses to apologize, I'll exercise my authority as CEO and shut down this money pit immediately."

"Shut it down?" Cassandra gasped, her face draining of color.

Penelope's eyes flashed with venom before she turned tearful eyes to Leonard. "Darling, you gifted me that boutique for our anniversary! You can't let him do this!"

Leonard's jaw clenched. The evidence was undeniable, even for him.

Nathan remained unmoved. "I'll overlook this... on two conditions. Cassandra makes a public apology, and Penelope repays all misused funds within forty-eight hours. Otherwise," his voice turned steely, "I'll present this to the board."

Penelope's hatred burned as she calculated her losses. That boutique was crucial to her plans.

Leonard sighed heavily. "Cassandra, hold a press conference tomorrow. Do as your brother says."

Cassandra slumped, defeated. The fight had drained from her.

Penelope recognized the battle was lost. Her glare promised retribution as Nathan and Oliver exited.

The moment the door closed, Leonard's furious roar and the sound of shattering porcelain echoed through the study.

Outside, Oliver scratched his head. "Sir, I thought you intended to pursue this to the end? What changed your mind?"

"That's none of your concern."

Nathan's mind flashed to Evelyn - those luminous eyes filled with hurt, the delicate floral scent that had enveloped him earlier.

He told himself it was Cassandra's cruel words caught on surveillance that changed his mind. But was that truly all?

Why had he reacted so violently when they targeted Evelyn? When Leonard pushed for the divorce? Was there no personal stake in his actions?

"Sir," Oliver ventured, "was it worth using our hard-won evidence just for an apology?"

Nathan shrugged. "Even if we exposed this, Father would cover for Penelope regardless. Love blinds him."

He pushed thoughts of Evelyn away, focusing instead on the cityscape beyond the windows. "I chose a resolution we can both live with. I wrongfully accused her about Victoria at the auction."

A quiet sigh escaped him as he buried the ache in his chest. "This settles my debt to her. I won't owe her anything after this."
###Chapter 113

Sleep eluded Evelyn Carter the entire night.

Every time she shut her eyes, Nathan Blackwood's striking features materialized in her mind. The phantom sensation of his warm hands gripping her waist from their earlier encounter lingered on her skin.

She bolted upright in bed.

They were divorced now. Why did he still haunt her like this?

After two fitful hours of sleep, Evelyn rose before dawn. She spent an hour kayaking across the moonlit lake, trying to cool the restless energy coursing through her veins.

Theodore Winslow had prepared her usual breakfast spread when she returned.

Evelyn picked at her avocado toast and truffle omelet with uncharacteristic lethargy. Even her favorite Ethiopian coffee failed to rouse her usual spark.

"Ms. Carter, are you concerned about Skylar's condition?" Theodore inquired while deftly wiping a crumb from her fingers with a monogrammed linen napkin.

"I despise losing control of situations," Evelyn admitted through clenched teeth, her obsidian eyes narrowing.

She left the second part unspoken: And I absolutely loathe Nathan Blackwood dictating my life again!

"What shall we do about Cassandra then?" Theodore pressed gently.

"Give me time to strategize. We must resolve this before public interest wanes."

Her phone vibrated against the marble breakfast table. The caller ID made her pulse jump.

"Father? Is everything alright?"

"Must something be wrong for me to call my daughter?" Harrison Kingsley's gruff voice held its usual edge. "When are you coming home? Your mothers insist on throwing you a celebration."

"A...celebration?" Evelyn's brow furrowed.

"Don't play coy. That viral footage of you saving that girl at the hotel? The internet's calling you 'Heaven's Angel' now."

Evelyn groaned, massaging her temples. That ridiculous moniker made her headache intensify.

"Your mothers believe you've brought honor to the Kingsley name. We're hosting a family dinner!"

While Evelyn seethed about the unwanted publicity, her father and stepmothers wanted to throw a party. Perfect.

"Cancel it. I'm having the story suppressed. I refuse to become some media spectacle."

"Must you always be so difficult?" Harrison's voice took on that familiar petulant tone. "Your mothers miss you. It's been months. Can't you humor them for one evening?"

"Fine. I'll visit next week," Evelyn conceded through gritted teeth.

"Good." Harrison's tone shifted abruptly. "And is Maxwell home?"

Evelyn stiffened. "Yes."

"Ha! If Sebastian hadn't told me, I'd be planning that ungrateful whelp's memorial by now!" Harrison's temper flared at the mention of his fourth son. "Bring him with you. If he refuses, consider himself disowned. The Kingsley gates will remain closed to him forever!"

After hanging up, Evelyn's delicate fingers plucked a piece of dark chocolate from Theodore's breast pocket. She bit into it with more force than necessary.

"Trouble?" Theodore inquired.

"Father demands I bring Maxwell home for dinner."

Theodore winced. He knew all too well about the Kingsley men's legendary stubbornness.

"Harrison's temper versus Maxwell's obstinacy? That's apocalyptic."

Evelyn's mood lifted slightly as the rich chocolate melted on her tongue. "I know my brother. He'll listen to me about anything except facing Father. I'll need to outmaneuver him, not force him."

After her morning routine, Evelyn headed to Monarch Grand Hotel.

Her Bugatti had barely approached the entrance when she spotted the swarm of reporters camped outside.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to slits. Theodore immediately called hotel security for intel.

"Those journalists are here about the 'angel' incident," he reported. "Somehow they've identified the heroine as one of our employees..."
###Chapter 114

Evelyn's eyes darkened. Since childhood, she had always despised being thrust into the media's relentless spotlight.

Unless absolutely necessary, she avoided public attention like the plague.

Why are they making such a fuss over something so trivial? Don't these reporters have anything better to write about?

She took a slow sip of her coffee, exhaling in frustration. Forget it. The hype will die down soon. She had already instructed Sebastian to suppress the news, and it should take effect any moment now. "Let's take the back entrance," she murmured.

Arriving at the hotel's discreet rear entrance, Evelyn instructed Theodore to park the car while she headed straight for her private elevator. She needed to reach her top-floor office without delay.

As she walked, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through Monarch Grand Hotels' official page.

Thanks to her heroic act, the hotel had been flooded with glowing reviews and praise.

"Next time, I'm definitely staying at a Monarch Group property! Their staff is incredible!"

"That woman is stunning! Can we get a clearer photo of her face?"

"Monarch Group is so much more trustworthy. Unlike the Blackwoods—thinking they can bully hotel staff just because they're wealthy!"

A smug smile curled Evelyn's crimson lips, making her resemble a triumphant little fox.

Though she loathed the personal attention, she couldn't deny the free publicity was a boon for the hotel.

Still, the situation with Skylar wasn't fully resolved, and unease prickled at the back of her mind.

Suddenly, her instincts flared. Someone was approaching too close—violating the unspoken boundary of personal space.

Before she could react, a hand clamped onto her shoulder.

Evelyn's eyes widened. Instinct took over. She spun around and flung her coffee straight into the man's face.

"Ah—!"

In one fluid motion, she seized his muscular arm and flipped him over her shoulder.

Thud.

The tall man hit the ground with a pained groan.

Evelyn blinked. Then gasped.

"Julian Montgomery? Is that you?"

"Ahem... yes."

Julian lay sprawled on the floor, torn between laughter and agony. Beautiful women really are a man's downfall, he mused wryly.

"Why did you sneak up on me like that?" Evelyn huffed, cheeks flushing. "My reflexes kicked in before I realized it was you!"

Mortified, she dropped to her knees beside him, her hands moving with practiced precision as she checked for injuries. Her touch was so skilled that Julian found himself comparing her to the elite masseurs at his family estate—and she surpassed them all.

His gaze lingered on her, admiration gleaming in his eyes as he savored the feel of her hands on him.

Oh, Nathan... You're a fool for letting this treasure slip through your fingers. Don't blame me when I claim her for myself.

"You're fine," Evelyn declared, relief washing over her. "Thankfully, your muscles absorbed most of the impact. No fractures." She patted his leg. "Get up. You can't sue me for this."

"I want to get up," Julian groaned, flashing a pained grin. "But I can't. Everything hurts. Mother Teresa, lend me a hand?"

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn reached down and hauled him up.

The moment their bodies brushed, Julian's breath hitched. Her scent—soft, intoxicating—wrapped around him, sending his pulse racing.

Countless women had thrown themselves at him before, but none had ever made him feel like he was the one being seduced.

"So," he murmured, lips quirking, "how did you enjoy manhandling me just now?"

"Manhandling you?" Evelyn scoffed. "If you're hallucinating, you do have a concussion."

She smirked. "The only way I'd look twice at you is if you were a three-legged toad. As a man, you've got nothing I want."

The words tumbled out before she could stop them. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Julian knew exactly who she was referring to—and jealousy flared hot in his chest.

Driven by sudden possessiveness, he spun her around and pinned her against the wall. His gaze raked over her face, darkening with intent.

Leaning in, he lowered his voice to a husky whisper.

"Who do you think is better than me? Nathan?"

His lips curved into a dangerous smile. "How do you know I don't surpass him in every way?"
###Chapter 115

Julian Montgomery was a master at charming women.

"Ha! Mr. Montgomery, do you really want me to break your bones this time?" Evelyn Carter hissed through clenched teeth. Her sharp gaze burned with fury.

Julian wisely kept his distance, taking two steps back with an exaggerated look of innocence.

"Ms. Carter, I was only teasing. No need to be so vicious. After all, I'm the one who got hurt here—you hit me, scolded me, and ruined my suit. I have a lunch meeting with my mother later, and I can't possibly show up like this. The least you could do is provide me with a change of clothes, don't you think?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, realizing she might have gone too far.

Compared to the insufferable Nathan Blackwood, Julian was at least reasonable. She hadn't forgotten how he had stood up for her when Victoria Sterling and Cassandra Blackwood had tried to humiliate her. Small kindnesses like that stuck with her.

"I'll have my assistant arrange a new suit for you. You can freshen up in one of the hotel suites," she offered, softening slightly.

Julian waved a dismissive hand. "Too much hassle. There's a boutique just around the corner. Come with me—I’d rather pick something myself. Who knows what your assistant might choose?"

His lips curled into a playful smirk. "And if you could be the one to pick my outfit, that would be even better."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but agreed. It wasn't like he could try anything in broad daylight.

She drove him to the mall in her sleek Bugatti La Voiture Noire.

Her driving was nothing short of breathtaking—sharp turns, effortless control, and a seamless slide into the parking spot. What should have been a twenty-minute drive took barely ten.

Julian stared at her, slack-jawed, the entire ride.

"Out. Now."

Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt and stepped out without sparing him a glance. "Unlike you, I don’t have endless free time. Some of us actually work for a living."

"Ms. Carter, you drive like a professional!"

She shrugged. "Before I met Nathan, I was a cab driver."

Julian’s eyes gleamed with intrigue. As someone deeply involved in underground racing, he recognized skill when he saw it.

She was far from ordinary.

And that made her all the more fascinating.

The mall was quiet on a Monday afternoon.

Still, Evelyn and Julian turned heads wherever they went—her in her perfectly tailored pantsuit, him with his effortless charm.

"You know," Julian said casually, "I came to the hotel today because I was worried about you. After that viral incident, I thought some reporters might give you trouble."

Evelyn barely glanced at him. "I recall you prefer YSL."

His eyebrows shot up. "How did you know?"

"The first time we met, you were wearing YSL haute couture. And at the charity gala—same brand."

A slow grin spread across his face. "You’ve been paying attention to me."

She shrugged. "YSL suits you. It’s… sexy."

Julian choked on air.

"Anyway, they don’t carry custom pieces here, so you’ll have to make do with ready-to-wear."

"I’ll love anything you pick," he teased.

Evelyn ignored him and strode into the boutique.

The attendants immediately flocked to them, sensing high-profile clients.

"Money isn’t an issue. Just pick what you like, Mr. Montgomery."

She settled onto the plush sofa, crossing her legs. The sharp lines of her suit accentuated every curve, and Julian couldn’t tear his eyes away.

The store staff exchanged impressed glances. This woman was ice and fire—cool, commanding, and utterly captivating.

Julian bit back a grin. This was new.

He was used to spoiling women, not the other way around.

And he liked it.

Just then, two impeccably dressed women passed by—Victoria Sterling and her mother, Margaret.

"Mother, look! It’s that witch, Evelyn!"

Victoria’s face twisted in fury as she pointed at Evelyn, who was laughing with Julian inside the boutique.

How dare she cozy up to another man so soon?
###Chapter 116

"Victoria, this is your golden chance to reclaim what's yours!" Margaret Sterling squeezed her daughter's arm with manic excitement. "We need to make Nathan come to you immediately. When he sees Evelyn with his best friend, that little tramp will be dead to him!"

"But Nathan's at work now." Victoria bit her lip. "He never went shopping with me even on weekends before. Why would he come now? Besides..."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I just won back his sympathy by playing the depression card. I need to tread carefully these days - reel him in slowly. I can't risk another outburst."

"Don't be naive!" Margaret dug her manicured nails into Victoria's shoulder. "Of course you don't ask him to accompany you shopping like some lovesick puppy. But if there's an emergency... That's how you make a man feel needed. Men crave that hero complex - they want to rescue damsels in distress, not obedient doormats!"

Victoria's eyes flickered with doubt. Her mother's advice rang hollow - hadn't she spent decades clinging to Richard Sterling like some pathetic koala? And where had that gotten her? A cheating husband, dwindling social status, and now playing nursemaid to a sick old man.

"I'll call Nathan myself," Margaret decided, already dialing. "I'll say you wandered off alone and now you're missing. With your 'fragile mental state,' if he cares at all, he'll come running."

Her lips curled into a vicious smile. "And when he arrives... he'll see exactly why that Kingsley bitch doesn't deserve him."

Nathan Blackwood had just stepped out of a board meeting when his phone buzzed. "Mrs. Sterling," he answered coldly.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Margaret's voice was shrill with fake panic. "Have you heard from Victoria? She went out alone hours ago and now her phone's dead! With her depression, I'm terrified something's happened!"

Nathan's grip tightened on his phone. "Where did she go?"

"She mentioned the new Éclat Boutique near Monarch Grand... Oh God, what if she's—"

"I'll find her." He cut her off, already striding toward the elevators. "Ian! The car. Now."

Within twenty minutes, Nathan was scanning the bustling Grandview Galleria, dialing Victoria repeatedly. On the fifth try, she finally picked up.

"Nathan?" Her voice sounded thin, breathless.

"Where are you? I'm at the galleria."

"Second floor... near the east elevators. I felt dizzy... had to sit down."

"Stay there." He took the escalator two steps at a time.

When he spotted Victoria slumped on a velvet bench, she launched herself into his arms. "You came!" Her tearful gaze fluttered up at him. "I'm better now that you're here."

"Your mother's been calling for hours. Why didn't you answer?" Nathan's voice was tight with concern.

Victoria produced a practiced pout. "My battery died. I was looking for a charger when..." She trailed off meaningfully.

"You can't wander off alone like this." He pulled her closer, inhaling her Chanel No. 5. "Not in your condition."

"I only feel safe with you, Nathan." She nuzzled against his Armani suit, hiding her triumphant smirk. Her mother's plan was working perfectly.

Around them, shoppers whispered:

"Is that Victoria Sterling? She's even more stunning in person!"

"Who's the guy? Looks like he stepped off a GQ cover."

Nathan ignored them, but Victoria suddenly gasped. "Nathan, look! What are the odds?"

He turned—and froze. His emerald eyes darkened, then flashed with something dangerous. Across the cosmetics counter, Evelyn Kingsley stood laughing with Ryan Montgomery, his hand resting intimately on the small of her back.

The sight sent white-hot fury coursing through Nathan's veins. His fingers curled into fists as something inside him shattered.
###Chapter 117

A few paces ahead of Nathan and Victoria, Julian and Evelyn strolled side by side. Julian towered with striking features while Evelyn carried herself with effortless grace. Together, they looked like something out of a romantic painting.

Nathan's jaw tightened when he noticed the shopping bag in Julian's hand. Had they been shopping together?

Evelyn remained oblivious to Nathan and Victoria's presence, too engrossed in Julian's animated storytelling. Their shared laughter created an intimate bubble around them.

An inexplicable ache spread through Nathan's chest. His eyes burned watching their easy camaraderie.

Julian suddenly felt an icy chill down his spine. Looking up, his eyes widened at the sight of Nathan and Victoria.

"Nathan? What are you doing here?" Julian's voice held genuine surprise.

Only then did Evelyn notice Nathan's frosty expression. Her gaze flickered to Victoria clinging to him, and a sardonic smile curved her lips.

Seeing her chance, Victoria tightened her grip on Nathan like a possessive vine. She shot Evelyn a triumphant look, marking her territory.

Evelyn couldn't care less.

The jealousy that once consumed her was gone. Her heart remained perfectly calm.

Those two deserve each other, she thought bitterly.

"I should be asking you that, Julian." Nathan's voice was dangerously low, his expression stormy.

"Shopping, obviously! You know how I love retail therapy." Julian grinned, completely unaware of the brewing storm.

Evelyn couldn't argue. She'd never met a man more enthusiastic about shopping than Julian. Throughout their walk, his attention kept drifting to store displays. If not for her urgency to leave, he would've dragged her into every boutique.

Nathan misinterpreted Julian's enthusiasm as deliberate provocation.

"I never realized Ms. Carter was so close with Mr. Montgomery that they'd go shopping together."

Victoria pressed weakly against Nathan's chest. "Nathan, let's go. We shouldn't interrupt their date."

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial while Julian looked genuinely confused at the word "date."

To everyone's surprise, Nathan gently pushed Victoria aside and strode toward Evelyn.

"Nathan!" Victoria called after him, but he didn't look back. Her eyes burned with resentment.

Evelyn tilted her chin up to meet Nathan's piercing gaze. Even in heels, he still towered over her, his presence overwhelming.

"What are you doing?" Nathan demanded coldly.

"Just shopping. Is that a crime?" Evelyn's crimson lips curled in mockery. "How fascinating that the great Mr. Blackwood thinks he owns this sidewalk."

"You went shopping with him?" Nathan emphasized the last word sharply.

"Hey, what's wrong with Evelyn shopping with me? I'm not some creep," Julian interjected, clicking his tongue.

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Who knows what you're really like around women?"

"Excuse me?" Julian's eyebrows shot up in outrage.

"Nathan, I'm free to spend time with whoever I choose. It's absurd that you're still trying to control me after our divorce." Evelyn met Nathan's murderous glare without flinching.

Was Nathan actually angry?

Surely not jealous. That would require him to have actual feelings for her.

Impossible. Nathan didn't love her. Jealousy was out of the question.

"Our divorce isn't finalized, yet you're parading around with my best friend. Do you want to cause a scandal between Blackwood Industries and Montgomery Group?" Nathan's chest felt uncomfortably tight, his eyes bloodshot.

Julian raised an eyebrow, barely suppressing a smirk. Clever bastard, using business as an excuse!

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "Nathan, aside from your family, who even knows I was your wife?"

Nathan's eyes widened, the truth of her words hitting him like a physical blow.

"Three years of marriage, and you never introduced me to your friends. Never took me to public events. We didn't even have a wedding."

Her smile turned dazzlingly bright, deliberately provocative. "Relax. Even if my face appeared on every billboard in this city, no one would connect me to you. So spare me your concern about 'embarrassing' you or Julian. From now on, let's pretend we're strangers. After all, the best ex is a dead one."

With that, Evelyn swept past Nathan without a backward glance.

Julian hesitated only a moment before abandoning his best friend to follow the woman who'd captured his attention.

Nathan watched Julian's retreating back, his breathing ragged. Veins stood out on his hands, his expression thunderous.

An irrational thought took root - Julian had stolen what was his.

Most friends would have each other's backs. But Julian? He'd stab Nathan in the back for a chance with Evelyn.
###Chapter 118

What an absolute savage!

Nathan, my chest feels like it's being crushed.

Victoria Sterling rushed forward, clutching his arm and pressing herself against his shoulder. Her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness.

"Since we're already here, why don't you go shopping with me? You've never taken me shopping before. Look, even Mr. Montgomery is with Ms. Carter."

Nathan's expression darkened, his gaze still fixed on Evelyn's retreating figure.

"Fine."

Evelyn walked ahead, her mood thoroughly soured.

Her ex-husband was like a fly that had landed on her dessert—completely ruining what should have been a perfect moment.

"Hey." Evelyn suddenly called out to Julian.

"Yeah?" Julian responded immediately, his eyes bright with anticipation.

"I'm in a foul mood. Tell me another joke."

Julian smirked. "I could tell you a hundred jokes to cheer you up, but if you really want to have fun, let's grab drinks at Velvet tonight."

"No thanks. I don't drink with men I'm not close to."

Evelyn shot him a frosty glance. "Besides, aren't you worried your little friendship boat with Nathan will capsize if you keep hanging around me?"

"Damn, you two are divorced—or might as well be. It's not like I stole you from him. Why would he cut ties with me? He can't afford to!" Julian scoffed, crossing his arms indignantly.

Just then, Evelyn's attention was caught by a sapphire necklace glinting in the display window of a high-end jewelry boutique. The gemstone shimmered under the spotlight like a fragment of the night sky.

She couldn't resist stepping inside.

Julian followed, his presence like a shadow.

"May I see this one?"

"Miss, you have impeccable taste!" The sales associate beamed. "This piece is from our limited-edition Celestial Depths collection—only five in the entire country."

Evelyn was no stranger to fine jewelry. The sapphire wasn't the rarest Vivid Blue, but the craftsmanship was exquisite, the design breathtaking.

With the brand's markup, the price easily soared into seven figures.

"Do you like it?"

Julian lounged on a plush chair, one leg crossed over the other, chin resting on his hand as he watched her with a playful smirk.

The sales associate couldn't help but stare. The woman was stunning, and the man was equally striking. They looked like they'd stepped out of a fashion editorial.

"Yes," Evelyn murmured, tracing the delicate curves of the necklace.

"Try it on." Julian tilted his head.

"Oh my God! This is gorgeous! I need it!"

A shrill voice shattered the moment.

Evelyn and Julian both grimaced.

She turned to see Victoria clutching Nathan's hand, her eyes wide with exaggerated delight.

The sales associate nearly dropped the necklace. Holy—is that Mr. Blackwood? He's even more striking in person. But the woman beside him… she doesn’t hold a candle to the one in front of me.

"Ugh. They’re everywhere," Julian muttered under his breath.

Nathan's cold gaze locked onto Evelyn for a heartbeat before flickering away.

"Nathan, I love this necklace! It’s perfect! Will you buy it for me?" Victoria pouted, batting her lashes like a child begging for candy.

Julian rubbed his arms, shuddering at the sickly-sweet tone.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

In the past, Victoria never had to ask—if she admired something, he’d buy it without hesitation.

But seeing this necklace only reminded him of Crimson Promise, the piece Evelyn had auctioned off. The memory burned with shame, and he’d locked that necklace away, vowing never to look at it again.

He hesitated.

Victoria’s smile faltered as the silence stretched.

"Miss, here’s my card."

Julian smoothly handed over a sleek black card, grinning at Evelyn. "Wrap it up nicely. It’s for this stunning lady."

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly.

Before the sales associate could react, another black card was thrust forward.

"Swipe this. I want that necklace."

Nathan’s voice was ice, his eyes locked on Evelyn with unreadable intensity.
###Chapter 119

Two exclusive Centurion black cards slid across the counter, held by men who could move Crestview's financial markets with a single word. And these titans were now battling over a necklace!

This moment deserved to be immortalized in oil paint.

The boutique assistant stared at the cards with trembling fingers. "Gentlemen... we only have one piece left..."

"I'm aware."

Nathan Blackwood's icy gaze finally tore away from Evelyn Carter's exquisite features. "That's precisely why I'm purchasing it."

Victoria Sterling nearly squealed with delight, barely containing her excitement as she waited for Nathan to present her with the prize.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, the bitter taste of jealousy rising in her throat. Whenever Victoria wanted something, Nathan moved heaven and earth to obtain it. Yet he'd never once considered her own desires.

"Use my card. Package it immediately!"

Julian Montgomery tapped the glass counter impatiently. "Surely you understand the concept of first come, first served?"

"Julian." Nathan's voice carried warning.

The dark-haired businessman met his childhood friend's stare unflinchingly. "Nathan, you know I don't play these games lightly. There are few women I genuinely wish to gift anything to." His voice dropped. "After twenty years of friendship, grant me this one concession?"

Evelyn's sapphire eyes widened in shock.

Victoria's jaw actually dropped. This tramp! Barely divorced from Nathan and already wrapping Crestview's most eligible bachelors around her finger! What magic did this used-up socialite possess?

Nathan felt the oxygen leave his lungs. Never in two decades had Julian challenged him over a woman. And that woman happened to be the ex-wife he supposedly couldn't care less about.

"Thank you, Mr. Montgomery."

Evelyn's sudden radiant smile could melt glaciers. "I'll accept this necklace as your gift."

Julian blinked, momentarily dazzled. "The pleasure is entirely mine, so long as it brings you joy."

Nathan's vision tinted red. White-hot fury licked through his veins.

How dare she accept gifts from another man? How dare she do so in front of him? The audacity!

Before he could react, Julian had already fastened the necklace around Evelyn's slender neck with reverent care.

Nathan's fists clenched uselessly at his sides.

"Stunning!" The assistant gasped behind her hand. "Absolutely breathtaking!"

"Yes, it's quite lovely." Evelyn touched the jewel lightly.

"No, miss! I mean you're stunning! Others have tried this piece—it wore them. But you? You elevate it! It was made for you!"

Victoria's manicured nails bit into her palms. She glared at Nathan, but the man wasn't even looking her way, making no move to reclaim the necklace.

"Mr. Montgomery, I should return to work. Shall we?"

"Of course."

Evelyn swept past Nathan without a glance, Julian falling into step beside her like the perfect escort.

"Nathan!" Victoria grabbed his arm, eyes shimmering with furious tears. "You promised me that necklace! How could you let that washed-up divorcée take it?"

Nathan shook her off and strode after the retreating pair.

"Evelyn!"

She turned, expression glacial. "Something else, Mr. Blackwood? Come to wrestle your gift back by force?"

Nathan flinched. Reaching into his pocket, he produced a velvet box, thrusting it toward her.

Evelyn recoiled. "What is this?"

"Compensation." His jaw worked. "For grandfather's jade bracelet you broke last time." He couldn't bring himself to call it a gift, though he knew how she'd once longed for his presents. Some petty part of him still refused to give her that satisfaction.

"Unnecessary. Your grandfather already replaced it." Her laugh held no warmth. "Keep it, lest your fiancée accuse me of theft again. I've no desire for another scene."

"You'll accept Julian's gift but refuse mine?" Nathan's voice cracked with something raw.

"Perhaps because I find your presence repulsive."

The words landed like a slap. Evelyn turned on her heel, Julian quickly following.

"Nathan, drinks tonight!" Julian called over his shoulder.

Nathan stood frozen, those six syllables echoing in his skull like a death knell. You're repulsive. You're repulsive. You're repulsive.

Victoria finally caught up, having witnessed the entire humiliating exchange. Her pretty features twisted into something truly ugly as she watched Evelyn's retreating figure. That bitch would pay.
###Chapter 120

Evelyn quickened her pace through the dimly lit underground parking garage, her heels clicking against the concrete.

"Ms. Carter! Evelyn!"

Julian Montgomery's voice echoed through the cavernous space as he caught up to her, his fingers wrapping around her delicate wrist.

She spun around abruptly, her tear-filled eyes meeting his with icy detachment.

"Release me."

"What's wrong? Is this about Nathan?" Julian's voice cracked slightly, laced with remorse. "I'm sorry. I had no idea he'd be here tonight. If I'd known—"

Evelyn's fingers instinctively touched the velvet box in her purse, the one Nathan had forced into her hands earlier. A sharp pang shot through her chest.

Compensation? As if money could erase everything.

"Here. Take it back."

With trembling hands, she removed the diamond necklace Julian had given her, the stones catching the fluorescent lights overhead.

"Thank you for the gift, but I can't keep it."

Julian's entire body stiffened. "Was I just a pawn in your game?"

"I'm sorry." Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper, her sorrow palpable.

Strangely, Julian felt no anger—only profound pity. Beneath his disappointment, he recognized the lingering affection she still harbored for Nathan. She needed time.

And he'd wait. However long it took.

"It's fine. At least you rejected Nathan's gift too." He forced a careless laugh as he pocketed the necklace. "Small victories."

"Mr. Montgomery, you're a good man. Far more perceptive than Nathan. Beneath that playboy exterior, you're thoughtful... considerate." Her voice softened with genuine remorse. "You deserve someone better. Don't waste your time on me."

"I've already found the best." Julian's eyes burned with intensity as he stepped closer. "It's you, Evelyn."

"Flattering."

Her polite smile didn't reach her eyes as she turned on her heel, leaving him standing alone in the parking garage, fists clenched in frustration.

Had she just...?

Yes. Definitely.

That same night at Velvet Lounge, Nathan Blackwood's stormy presence had cleared the VIP section faster than any bouncer could.

Julian had the entire wing emptied, leaving only the two of them and a terrified bartender.

Nathan sat hunched over the bar, his aura so glacial the ice in his glass barely melted. Before him sat an open jewelry box containing a pair of earrings worth more than most cars.

He'd carried them for weeks, waiting for the perfect moment. Instead, Evelyn had rejected them without even looking.

Humiliating.

The whiskey burned his throat as he recalled Julian fastening that damned necklace around Evelyn's neck earlier. That radiant smile she'd once reserved only for him—now freely given to others.

"Another." He slammed his empty glass down.

The bartender hesitated. "Sir, perhaps something—"

Nathan's glare silenced him mid-sentence.

Just as he raised the fresh pour to his lips, Julian's hand intercepted it.

"Slow down. You'll poison your liver."

Nathan's drunken gaze focused with difficulty. "Better my liver than my best friend fucking my wife."

"Ex-wife." Julian slid onto the adjacent stool. "And I didn't touch her."

"Yet." Nathan's knuckles whitened around his glass. "Stay away from Evelyn."

"Why? Because she's with Sebastian now? Or because she was your wife first?" Julian's mocking tone cut deep.

Nathan's chest constricted violently.

"If it's the former, I don't care. If it's the latter..." Julian smirked. "I care even less."

Something in Nathan snapped.

Glass shattered as he overturned his drink and seized Julian's collar in one violent motion, eyes bloodshot with rage.

"Listen carefully, Montgomery. Over my dead body will you lay a finger on her."
###Chapter 121

Nathan's furious glare sent shivers down Julian's spine.

The intensity in those dark eyes surpassed even when Victoria had left for Silvercrest three years ago.

Julian had meant it as half a joke - teasing his childhood friend was second nature to him.

He'd only intended to poke fun at Nathan, never expecting such an explosive reaction.

Clearly, Evelyn still held power over his emotions.

The bartender paled at the confrontation. Few in Crestview would dare lay hands on Julian Montgomery.

"Nathan, are you in love with Evelyn?"

The question hit Nathan like a bucket of ice water. His drunken haze cleared momentarily, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Haven't you noticed? You've been acting completely irrational since the divorce." Julian studied him closely. "We've been friends since diapers. Why won't you be honest with me?"

"I don't love her." Nathan ground out each word through clenched teeth.

"Right. And I'm the Queen of England." Julian rolled his eyes.

"Julian!"

Ignoring Nathan's warning tone, Julian continued, "Listen, if you want Evelyn back, I'll support you. But if this is just some possessive ex-husband nonsense, then step aside. I know what I want - and I intend to pursue her."

Nathan staggered back as if physically struck, releasing Julian's collar.

Straightening his suit, Julian pulled the sapphire necklace from his pocket with a sigh. "She refused it."

Nathan's breath caught.

"Evelyn isn't materialistic. She returned this the moment she left you." Julian's bitter laugh held no humor. "What the hell did you do to her, Nate? She looks at you like you're the devil incarnate. You two are like oil and water."

Nathan's jaw tightened until it ached.

Memories flooded him - three years of ignoring her handmade gifts, the shredded suit, the untouched presents gathering dust in their closet.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had asked Theodore to leave after work, heading alone to the western district cathedral.

The golden dome glittered magnificently against the sunset.

Sebastian stood beneath the massive cross in his crisp clergy robes, delivering his sermon with the Bible in hand.

Evelyn sat quietly in the back, letting her eldest brother's soothing voice wash over her like a healing balm.

As the congregation dispersed, Sebastian approached with a gentle smile, ruffling her hair. "You should have told me you were coming."

"I didn't want to interrupt your work." She smiled up at him.

Sebastian took the seat beside her. "What's troubling you?"

"Is it that obvious?"

Evelyn sighed, shoulders slumping. "I did something awful today, Ash. I used Julian just to get under Nathan's skin. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop myself!"

Her voice cracked. "Seeing Nathan with Victoria...watching him compete with Julian to buy her jewelry...it shattered me. I just wanted him to feel something - anything - even if it's hatred."

Sebastian pulled his trembling sister into a comforting embrace.

"Do you still have feelings for Nathan?"

"I'm not over him," Evelyn admitted against his shoulder, tears dampening his robes. "I loved him for so long. My entire youth revolved around him. Those memories won't fade."

She looked up with wet lashes. "I'm terrified, Sebastian. What if I can never love again? Nathan carved out my heart. How could anyone else compare?"

"That fear is natural after such a long love." Sebastian smoothed her hair. "But Evelyn, as long as your heart beats, it can love again."

He tilted her chin up. "Don't be afraid. The Kingsleys will always be your safety net. Be true to yourself, and chase what your heart desires. Life's too short for regrets."
###Chapter 122

Evelyn sighed, her voice barely above a whisper. "I chased after what my heart desired, only to end up with scars and a shattered soul."

Her lips curled into a bitter smile, her delicate frame trembling slightly. "I loved the wrong person at the wrong time. I was so blinded by it that I didn’t even see who else was standing right beside me."

Sebastian studied her, his sharp gaze softening for just a moment. He found it unsettling how emotionally mature Evelyn was for her age—it spoke of wounds too deep for someone so young.

With a quiet chuckle, he leaned back, crossing his arms. "Don’t be so hard on yourself, Evelyn. The fact that you loved Nathan so fiercely proves he had his merits. He wasn’t entirely worthless, so your youth wasn’t wasted. It just wasn’t meant to be."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, shaking her head. "I used to think my taste was impeccable because the man I loved seemed untouchable. Now, looking back, I realize how foolish I was."

Just then, her phone buzzed violently against the table.

Theodore’s name flashed across the screen.

She swiped to answer. "Theo, what’s going on?"

"Finally! Your signal’s been terrible!" His voice crackled with excitement. "Check your social media—now! Cassandra Blackwood is holding a press conference to publicly apologize to our hotel employee!"

Evelyn shot to her feet, her earlier melancholy vanishing in an instant. Her almond-shaped eyes widened, glinting with disbelief.

Theodore continued breathlessly, "They sprung this on everyone last minute—probably to minimize backlash. The live stream’s already hit five million views and climbing! If they were going to back down, they should’ve done it with dignity. This just makes them look sneaky and spineless. Monarch Group would never pull something like this!"

A realization struck Evelyn like lightning.

The Blackwoods’ sudden change of heart was too abrupt.

Yesterday, Cassandra had been ready to wage war. There was no way she’d surrender so easily unless something—or someone—had forced her hand.

Leonard doted on Cassandra, and Penelope shielded her like a prized jewel. The Blackwoods would never let her humiliate herself like this unless compelled.

Who had intervened?

Nathan?

Evelyn shook her head violently, as if trying to dislodge the thought. But no one else had the power to bend Cassandra to their will.

If it was Nathan… why would he do this?

Taking a steadying breath, she hung up and pulled up the live stream.

The screen was flooded with a relentless tide of comments, obscuring Cassandra’s ashen face.

There she stood, clad in a stark black dress, bowing stiffly before a sea of reporters. Her expression was pinched, her usual arrogance replaced by something brittle.

[Karma’s a bitch! Money can’t buy class!]

[Is she seriously wearing full glam for an apology? How tone-deaf can you be?]

[Pathetic. She’s not even trying to look remorseful.]

[Not just pathetic—ugly too.]

Evelyn’s lips curled into a razor-sharp smile as she watched.

Cassandra, the golden princess of the Blackwoods, was enduring the greatest humiliation of her twenty-five years.

Of course she wasn’t sincere. But Evelyn didn’t care.

If Cassandra surrendered too easily, where was the fun in that?

Then, another call sliced through her thoughts, wrenching her attention away.
###Chapter 123

Evelyn snatched up her phone with trembling fingers. "Hello, Dominic?" Her voice came out softer than she intended.

"Evie! Damn it, I've been trying to reach you for hours!" Dominic's usually composed tone crackled with urgency through the receiver.

Her grip tightened on the device. "What's wrong?"

"Has Maxwell contacted you today?"

"No... why? What's going on?" A cold dread crept up her spine.

Dominic exhaled sharply. "Julian and I got wasted last night. When Maxwell was completely plastered, he... he said something terrifying."

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed.

Her fourth brother had that peculiar trait - while most people's drunken ramblings meant nothing, Maxwell's intoxicated declarations became tomorrow's reality.

Where others would wake with hazy memories, Maxwell's eidetic recall remained razor-sharp even in deepest intoxication. That photographic memory had made him one of the agency's most lethal operatives.

"What did he say?!" Evelyn's voice rose an octave. Her stomach twisted into knots.

"He swore he's going to kill Nathan."

The world tilted. Only Sebastian's quick reflexes kept her from collapsing against the church pew.

"Maxwell flew halfway across the globe just to settle your score! Last night he kept ranting about teaching Nathan a permanent lesson. Said he'd either castrate him or put a bullet between his eyes - claimed it's the only way to cleanse his rage. I thought he'd listen to reason after sobering up, but when I called him all day today..." Dominic's voice broke. "He's not answering. Evie, do you think he actually went after Nathan?"

Evelyn didn't bother explaining to Sebastian. She turned on her heel and sprinted from the chapel, her designer heels clicking frantically against the marble floor.

Meanwhile at the press conference venue, Cassandra Blackwood was drowning in her own disaster.

The public's fury only intensified as Cassandra's half-hearted apology failed to satisfy anyone. Social media erupted with fresh condemnation.

Truth be told, Penelope Whitmore had prepared a carefully crafted statement for Cassandra to memorize. She'd even forbidden any makeup to project contrition.

But Cassandra, ever the rebellious socialite, had other plans. Arrogance blinded her to consequences. She'd envisioned this as her grand redemption - the moment the world would fall in love with Blackwood Industries' most beautiful heiress.

Instead, the internet crowned her its newest meme queen.

[Monarch Grand Hotels just earned my lifelong loyalty! That Angel employee deserves a raise!]

[Never booking Blackwood properties again! Disgusting behavior!]

[Let's make #BoycottBlackwood trend until their stock crashes!]

As Cassandra finished her disastrous speech, reporters swarmed like vultures. Microphones jabbed at her face from every angle, each question more brutal than the last.

The pampered heiress had never faced such hostility. Her legs buckled as security hustled her offstage - only for her stiletto to catch on a step.

The resulting faceplant became an instant viral sensation.

Two hulking bodyguards scooped her up like a ragdoll, her designer dress riding up to reveal lacy lingerie. Within minutes, #CassandraBlackwoodFaceplant dominated global trends.

Meanwhile at Velvet Lounge, Nathan Blackwood and Julian Montgomery staggered out arm in arm - former rivals now bonded by whiskey.

Julian, with his legendary alcohol tolerance, merely swayed. But Nathan, drowning his sorrows in single malts, could barely keep his eyes open.

His usually pristine tie hung loose as flushed skin peeked through unbuttoned collar. That aristocratic jawline now slack with intoxication.

"You good?" Julian tightened his grip as Nathan listed dangerously toward the stairs.

"M'fine." Nathan rubbed his temples with a wince. "Your bartender serving paint thinner? Head's splitting."

"Bastard." Julian chuckled. "No wonder Evelyn left you."

Nathan's throat worked as he panted, the column of his neck glistening. Even through the haze, Julian noted how effortlessly his friend exuded raw sexuality.

With a grunt, Nathan shoved away. "Going home."

"Like hell you are. I'm driving."
###Chapter 124

"I'm perfectly sober. Don't underestimate me," Nathan growled, his voice laced with irritation.

Julian's brow furrowed as he stepped closer. "I'm just worried some opportunistic bastard might take advantage of you."

Nathan scoffed, tilting his head with a mocking smirk. "Unlike you, not every man is a predator in disguise."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode toward his waiting Maybach, leaving Julian standing in the dimly lit parking lot.

The sleek black car glided down the deserted road, the hum of the engine the only sound in the tense silence.

"Mr. Blackwood," Oliver began cautiously from the driver's seat, "the press conference concluded, but the backlash against Ms. Cassandra has intensified. It's damaging the Blackwood family's reputation—and Blackwood Industries."

Nathan's fingers tightened around his phone. "Blackwood Industries?" His voice was low, dangerous.

Oliver swallowed. "Yes, sir. The fallout is worse than anticipated."

A bitter laugh escaped Nathan's lips. "Of course. They only keep me around to clean up their messes."

The Blackwood family had never truly accepted him. Aside from Reginald, no one—not even his own father, Leonard—had ever treated him as anything more than a tool.

If they wanted to play this game, he'd let Cassandra burn.

His jaw clenched. They used me. They hurt Evelyn. Cassandra deserves every bit of this.

Then, a realization struck him like a physical blow.

Evelyn. My wife.

The word sent an unexpected tremor through him.

Had that infuriating, sharp-tongued woman really gone running to Julian just to spite him?

His grip on his tie tightened, a slow-burning fury coiling in his chest.

"Oliver. Pull over."

The car came to a smooth stop beside a quiet park, the trees rustling in the evening breeze.

"Sir, are you feeling unwell? Should I fetch a—"

"You are the sick bag," Nathan snapped, shooting Oliver a glare that made the younger man flinch.

With a huff, Nathan shoved the door open and stepped out, the cool air hitting his face like a slap.

"Wait here."

He stalked toward the park, his polished shoes crunching lightly on the gravel path. The breeze carried the faint scent of damp earth, a stark contrast to the suffocating tension in the car.

For a moment, he just breathed, letting the quiet settle over him.

Then—

His shoulders tensed.

"Who's there?" His voice cut through the stillness like a blade.

A low chuckle echoed from the shadows. "Sharp ears. Almost like a guard dog's."

Nathan turned slowly, his gaze locking onto a towering figure emerging from the darkness.

The man was built like a soldier—broad-shouldered, clad entirely in black, his face obscured by a mask. Only his piercing eyes were visible, glinting with something dangerous.

"Who the hell are you?" Nathan's muscles coiled, ready.

The stranger cracked his knuckles, the sound unnaturally loud in the quiet. "Isn't it obvious? I'm here to teach you a lesson."

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Why?"

"Because you hurt someone important to me." The man tilted his head, a predator sizing up prey. "And I think she'd feel better if you suffered a hundred times worse than she did."

Recognition flickered in Nathan's mind—something about the man's voice, his stance, was familiar. But the memory slipped away like smoke.

The stranger took a step forward, the air around him turning frigid.

"Who is this person I supposedly hurt?" Nathan kept his tone even, though every instinct screamed at him to brace for a fight.

The masked man laughed, dark and humorless. "I thought I'd go easy on you if you showed remorse. But you're just a heartless bastard, aren't you?"

Another step closer.

"If I don't make you bleed, you'll never understand what you've done."
###Chapter 125

The moment Nathan Blackwood saw the shadowy figure charging toward him, his combat instincts flared to life. The attacker moved with eerie silence, like a specter from his past.

Maxwell Kingsley's strikes were brutal and precise, each blow aimed to incapacitate. His movements blurred with lethal intent.

Nathan's pupils contracted. He barely twisted away in time, feeling the whoosh of air where Maxwell's fist had been.

"Not bad for a washed-up soldier," Maxwell taunted, his lips curling in a cruel smirk.

Nathan's chest heaved as he steadied his breathing.

Though years had passed since his military service, Nathan maintained peak physical condition through relentless training.

But actual combat? That was a different beast entirely.

Now he relied solely on muscle memory and raw instinct.

As they exchanged blows, Nathan recognized something unsettlingly familiar in Maxwell's technique.

Those moves...they bore the distinct signature of elite special forces training.

Who the hell was this guy?

CRACK!

A vicious kick to the ribs sent white-hot pain through Nathan's torso. He staggered but refused to fall.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Oliver Sinclair's voice cut through the haze of pain. The young secretary rushed to Nathan's side, his face pale. "You're hurt!"

"It's nothing," Nathan ground out, swallowing the coppery taste in his mouth.

"You bastard!" Oliver's hands balled into fists as he charged at Maxwell.

"Oliver! No!"

Nathan's warning came too late.

Maxwell dispatched the untrained secretary with a single brutal punch, sending Oliver crumpling to the pavement.

Nathan saw red. "We've met before. Who are you?"

Maxwell's smirk widened as he stepped over Oliver's unconscious form. "Let me enlighten you," he purred, closing the distance between them. "The woman I'd die for? She's your ex-wife."

Nathan's entire body went rigid. His hands shook with barely contained rage. "You're dead."

The expensive fabric of Nathan's tailored suit strained as his muscles coiled. He launched himself at Maxwell with a roar.

Their brutal exchange revealed an unsettling truth - despite years away from active duty, Nathan's skills remained razor-sharp. Even constrained by his formal attire, his movements were fluid and precise.

Maxwell's eyes narrowed. He'd underestimated his opponent.

Nathan fought like a man possessed, every strike fueled by white-hot fury.

But alcohol and exhaustion were taking their toll. His movements grew sluggish, his vision blurring at the edges.

Finally, Maxwell landed a crushing blow that sent Nathan sprawling. Pain exploded along his spine.

"Time to finish this," Maxwell sneered, raising his foot for a killing stomp.

A new voice rang out: "Touch my best friend again and I'll put a bullet between your eyes!"

Julian Montgomery came barreling into the fray, his usually charming features twisted in rage. In his hand gleamed the cold steel of a pistol.

Maxwell froze mid-step.

"Back the hell up!" Julian's voice shook slightly as he leveled the gun. "Unless you want your brains decorating the pavement."

"Julian, don't!" Nathan gasped, clutching his injured side.

"Are you insane?" Julian shouted. "This psycho nearly killed you!"

His finger tightened on the trigger. "Last warning - walk away or I swear to God I'll shoot!"

To everyone's shock, Maxwell took another step forward, his eyes locked on Julian's.

"Julian, run!" Nathan bellowed.

BANG!

The gunshot echoed through the night.
###Chapter 126

The metallic projectile whizzed past Maxwell's ear with a deadly whisper.

A sharp gasp escaped Evelyn's lips as pain radiated through her body.

In a blur of motion, Evelyn threw herself at Maxwell, shielding him with her own frame. The steel pellet embedded itself in her delicate shoulder with sickening precision.

Though not a conventional firearm, the compressed air gun packed enough force to shatter bone.

Evelyn's porcelain skin glistened with cold sweat, her entire body convulsing in agony.

Yet her arms remained locked around her brother in an unbreakable embrace.

Nathan's world tilted on its axis. The sight of Evelyn protecting another man hit him like a physical blow to the chest.

Every nerve ending screamed in protest, but nothing compared to the searing betrayal of watching his wife take a bullet for her brother - the same man who'd just tried to kill him.

His mind reeled. How could she choose Maxwell over me? Her hatred shouldn't extend to becoming an accomplice to murder.

"Evelyn!" Maxwell's voice cracked with horror as he grasped her shuddering form. Crimson stains bloomed across his palms.

Rage ignited in his chest, burning hotter than the pain in his own body.

"Julian Montgomery! I'll make you pay for this!"

Julian stood frozen, the weapon slipping from his numb fingers. His breath came in ragged gasps.

He hadn't seen Evelyn move. One moment she wasn't there, the next she'd materialized between them. If only he'd reacted faster...

"Maxwell Kingsley!" Evelyn's voice was steel wrapped in velvet as she pushed against her brother's chest. "If you ever want me to acknowledge you as family again, leave. Now."

The unspoken threat hung between them.

With one last agonized look, Maxwell vanished into the night. He'd contact Sebastian to arrange medical care for his reckless sister.

Evelyn exhaled shakily before turning her attention to Nathan's injuries. "Mr. Montgomery, call an ambulance immediately. They both need medical attention."

"But your shoulder-"

"I'll live," she snapped, already kneeling beside Nathan despite the fire in her joint.

Nathan recoiled as if burned. "Stop this charade! Get away from me!" His chest heaved with labored breaths.

He despised her for aiding Maxwell's escape, but more than that, he feared seeing her beautiful face contorted in pain.

Evelyn ignored him, her delicate fingers probing his legs with professional precision. Bruises mottled his chiseled features, his usually immaculate suit torn and soiled.

Her heart clenched. However much she resented him, seeing Nathan hurt still tore at her soul.

That reckless idiot Maxwell! How could he be so brutal?

"I said leave!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip.

"Not until I'm sure you're not seriously injured!" she fired back, emerald eyes blazing. "Your old injuries-"

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "How do you know about those?" Had Julian betrayed his confidence?

Sirens wailed in the distance, cutting through the tension. Paramedics whisked both men away while Julian remained glued to Evelyn's side.

At the hospital, Julian paced like a caged animal outside the treatment room. When Evelyn emerged, pale but composed, he nearly collapsed with relief.

"Just a few stitches," she assured him with a tired smile.

"Just stitches?" Julian's voice hitched. "Evelyn, this could have permanent consequences! Tell me the truth - will you regain full mobility?"

A weak laugh escaped her lips. "Honestly Julian, you sound almost disappointed. What will you do if I can't lift my arm again?"

"I'll marry you."

Evelyn blinked. "Excuse me?"

Julian's throat worked, his eyes suspiciously bright. "I'll take responsibility. If that wound leaves you impaired, I'll spend the rest of my life making sure you want for nothing."
###Chapter 127

Evelyn's mind screamed. What in the world?! Is Julian alright?!

She forced a dry laugh. "Mr. Montgomery, you're full of jokes today."

"I'm not joking, Evelyn. I'm completely serious!"

Julian's voice trembled with emotion as he reached for her shoulders, but Evelyn swiftly stepped back, avoiding his touch.

"Mr. Montgomery," she said coolly, "if memory serves, I've already made my position clear this afternoon. Must I say something particularly cruel for you to finally understand?"

"I know. You rejected me."

Julian's deep gaze held bitter amusement. "I also know you're with Sebastian now. But I want you to know I'll always be here, right behind you. If you ever look back, I wouldn't mind being your... consolation prize."

Consolation prize?! Evelyn's eyes flashed. Does he think I'm like Harrison?!

Julian's eyes were mesmerizing pools of sorrow and sincerity - the kind that could ensnare any woman's heart. No wonder he was so popular among socialites.

Yet Evelyn remained utterly immune to his charms.

If anything, she preferred Nathan's piercing gaze - those beautiful eyes that held more danger than affection.

"By the way, Evelyn," Julian asked nervously, "who was that man who attacked Nathan? Are you close to him?"

"Young Madam!"

Just as Evelyn struggled for an answer, Oliver approached them in his hospital gown.

"Why are you out of bed?"

Evelyn immediately brushed past Julian to support Oliver. "You may not be seriously injured, but you still have a concussion from hitting your head. You should be resting."

"Young Madam, was it you who saved Mr. Blackwood?" Oliver asked excitedly.

"I... I didn't do anything." Evelyn's voice turned flat, guilt weighing heavily on her.

"I knew you still had feelings for Mr. Blackwood!"

Ignoring Oliver's comment, Evelyn changed the subject. "Mr. Sinclair, has Mr. Blackwood finished his treatment?"

Oliver nodded eagerly. "Young Madam, won't you stay? At least... just see him for a moment."

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn walked toward Nathan's ward with leaden steps.

After all, her brother had assaulted Nathan. This mess was her responsibility - she couldn't just walk away.

In the ward, Nathan leaned against the bedframe gazing out the window. Despite his bruised face, his striking features remained undeniable. That usually proud, stern expression now carried an unexpected vulnerability.

It was the same face Evelyn had loved for thirteen years.

Even now, the sight stirred something in her heart - though the feeling had irrevocably changed.

"Mr. Blackwood."

"I'll find out who did this tonight and make them pay dearly. You'd better disappear before I lose my temper." Nathan's voice was ice, his expression stormy.

Evelyn had always been stubborn, always defiant against orders.

She marched to the bedside, meeting his dark gaze without flinching. "Mr. Blackwood, I came to formally apologize for tonight's incident. If you're angry, direct it at me. Since he only hurt you because of me, I'll take full responsibility. If you prefer settling this privately, I'm willing. I doubt you'd want this becoming public knowledge - taking your ex-wife to court right before marrying Ms. Sterling? You're a respected figure. Such a scandal would only tarnish your reputation. And if this reaches Grandfather... well, neither of us could explain that away, could we?"

Each word struck Nathan like a physical blow.

She's defending that attacker! Taking the blame for him! How could she protect him like this? She'd shield a criminal, but what am I to her? What a fucking joke!

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice cracked, eyes burning red with pain, "who is he to you? You were willing to die for him."

"It wasn't a real gun. I'm not dead. I'm fine." Her tone remained eerily calm.

"Is there a difference? The moment you stepped in front of him, it made no difference!"

Nathan tried to rise, but pain rendered him weak. He slammed his fists against the mattress in frustration. "Three years of marriage! Three years of you claiming to love me! Yet look at your actions! Nothing you've done proves you ever cared! Did you think me a fool?!"
###Chapter 128

The alcohol loosened Nathan's tightly controlled emotions, unleashing years of pent-up resentment.

Nathan Blackwood was a man of iron discipline. Even when a bullet had torn through his flesh on the battlefield, he hadn't so much as flinched. But now, he couldn't hold back any longer.

"Mr. Blackwood, you're not angry because you were beaten or because I nearly died from a gunshot wound." Evelyn's voice trembled, her heart aching as crushing disappointment washed over her. "You're only furious because you think I lied to you."

Nathan stiffened. His lips pressed into a thin, tense line.

"Nathan, we're already divorced. Why does this even matter? It's pointless." Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "You're mad because something that once belonged to you now belongs to someone else. You hate losing control over me. That's all this is." She lifted her chin defiantly. "For the sake of your health, let's just get straight to the point—compensation. If you want to settle this privately, fine."

Nathan's eyes snapped open, bloodshot and burning. "Tell me who that man is and what your relationship is with him. Then we'll settle this privately."

"No," Evelyn answered without hesitation.

"Then leave Sebastian Kingsley and cut all ties with the Monarch Group. Do that, and I'll agree to a private settlement."

Evelyn scoffed. This man has the audacity to push his luck like this?

Her cherry-red lips parted, so enticing that Nathan momentarily lost himself in their allure.

He narrowed his eyes, wondering if the alcohol was still clouding his judgment. Right now, she was irresistible.

Growing up in luxury, Nathan had encountered countless beautiful women. He prided himself on his self-control.

Yet, at this moment, he was struggling.

"Since you're not serious about negotiating compensation, I'll have my secretary handle this with you. I won't disturb your rest any longer. Goodbye."

Before she could turn away, Nathan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. With surprising strength, he yanked her into his arms.

Evelyn collided with his solid chest, her breath hitching.

"Nathan! Let—"

His mouth crashed down on hers.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. She shoved against his shoulders, her fists pounding uselessly against his unyielding frame.

In their three years of marriage, Nathan had never once initiated so much as a handhold, let alone a kiss. Now, he was devouring her like a man possessed.

The realization sent fury blazing through her. Her vision blurred with unshed tears as she bit down hard on his lower lip.

"Fuck!" Nathan jerked back, pain flashing across his face.

"You bastard!" Evelyn's voice shook with rage and humiliation. She raised her hand and slapped him—hard.

The sharp crack echoed through the room. A red handprint bloomed across Nathan's cheek.

His eyes burned with fury, but when he saw the tears glistening in her eyes and her swollen lips, something inside him twisted. His mind went blank.

"Nathan! What do you take me for?" Evelyn's voice trembled. "You trampled on my dignity during our marriage, and now you're harassing me after our divorce? What will it take for you to just let me go?"

She wiped her smeared lipstick with the back of her hand, her glare searing. "Forget about keeping me as your mistress. If you ever pull this again, I swear I'll ruin you."

With that, she shot him one last venomous look, spun on her heel, and stormed out.

Nathan clenched his jaw, the sting of her slap nothing compared to the ache in his chest.

What the hell was I thinking? He dragged a hand down his face. I kissed her. I must be out of my damn mind.

The moment Evelyn left, Julian Montgomery strode into the room.

"Nathan, did you just fight with Evelyn? The whole hallway heard you two."

Then Julian's gaze dropped to Nathan's bruised lips. His eyes widened. "Holy shit—what happened to your mouth? Did you—" He gasped. "You absolute scoundrel! You have a fiancée!"
###Chapter 129

Nathan bit down on his lower lip, tasting the metallic tang of blood. The sharp pain cleared his alcohol-fogged mind momentarily.

He had never initiated a kiss with any woman before.

The only two instances had been when Victoria made the first move. Even then, he'd only permitted her to brush the corner of his mouth.

Never had he imagined craving Evelyn's lips with such intensity that he'd lose all self-control.

Nathan couldn't comprehend his own actions.

"I must still be drunk," he muttered hoarsely.

He slumped back weakly, massaging his temples. "No more drinking like this. It leads to... mistakes."

"Bullshit!" Julian Montgomery's voice cracked like a whip. "You're just a drunken predator! How dare you assault Evelyn like this, you bastard!"

Julian paced like a caged animal, fists clenched. If Nathan weren't already injured, he would've thrown punches.

The alcohol had stripped away Nathan's usual ironclad control.

Yet he couldn't deny the electric sweetness of his ex-wife's lips had been intoxicating beyond measure.

"Leave," Nathan commanded darkly, his Adam's apple bobbing. "I need rest."

"You heartless bastard!" Julian spat. "Evelyn has stitches from her injuries! How could you force yourself on her like that?"

Nathan's chest constricted at the accusation.

Evelyn had fled to the restroom, fixing her disheveled appearance with trembling hands. The cold water did nothing to soothe her burning cheeks as she staggered from the hospital.

Her emerald eyes shimmered with unshed tears, emotions warring within.

We're divorced, she thought bitterly. What gives him the right? The audacity! The sheer disrespect!

"Evelyn!"

Sebastian Kingsley materialized from the shadows, engulfing her in a protective embrace.

"Evelyn, forgive me for being late." Sebastian's voice cracked with emotion, his hold gentle around her injured shoulder.

"I'm alright," she whispered.

Sebastian carefully avoided her wound. "Let's return to Kingsley Medical Center. We'll have the specialists re-examine you."

"It's nothing serious."

Evelyn forcibly schooled her features, the storm in her eyes hardening to ice.

"Where's Maxwell?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Fetch him. Now."

The air around Evelyn crackled with barely restrained fury.

Sebastian maintained a safe distance, sipping tea with forced nonchalance.

Dominic and Theodore stood flanking Evelyn, both towering men seeming small beneath her glacial wrath.

"Ahem, Ms. Carter..." Theodore ventured cautiously. "Maxwell is your blood brother. Perhaps we should all calm—"

"Special agent?" Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "He behaves more like a trained assassin!"
###Chapter 130

Evelyn's piercing gaze locked onto Maxwell with icy intensity.

"Maxwell, when you called me earlier, you were terrified Nathan might harm Theodore. Now, barely hours later, you've completely changed your tune?"

"Oh, so it was you who betrayed me!" Dominic's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously as he turned on Maxwell. His jaw clenched tight enough to crack teeth. "You treacherous snake! Just wait - I'll make sure you regret this!"

"How dare you speak to your elder brother like that?" Dominic's voice dripped with mock outrage. "Little sister, don't hold back - unleash your fury on this lunatic! Toss him straight into the incinerator!" Seeing persuasion was futile, Dominic chose to fan the flames instead.

After all, Maxwell wouldn't survive the night, and Dominic had no intention of going down with him.

"Maxwell Kingsley!" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up in fury. "You still have the audacity to yell at Dominic? Will you still not admit your wrongdoing?"

"What exactly have I done wrong?" Maxwell's face twisted in defiance. "Since ancient times, beauties have toppled empires. I'm merely eliminating that homme fatale for you, little sister!"

"You're utterly ridiculous!"

Evelyn slammed her palm against the sofa armrest with such force that pain shot through her injured shoulder. A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

"Evelyn, what's wrong?"

"Little sister, are you alright? Don't scare me like that!"

"Ms. Carter, should I call the car? We need to get you to the hospital immediately!"

Sebastian, Dominic, Maxwell, and Theodore instantly descended into panic. The four towering men clustered around Evelyn as if she were in labor.

Maxwell dropped to one knee before her, gently cradling her delicate hand against his pounding heart. His face had gone ghostly pale.

"Little sister, is your wound hurting? This is all my fault! Hit me, curse me - do whatever you want!"

"Have you finally realized your mistake?" Evelyn asked through shallow breaths, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead.

Maxwell thought of how Evelyn had taken a bullet for him. The memory made his chest constrict with unbearable guilt. "Evelyn, I'm so sorry... I just couldn't bear watching my beloved sister suffer because of that worthless scum. You're our precious jewel - we've cherished you since birth. Yet that bastard Nathan hurt you, made you cry... He deserves to pay!"

"Maxwell, listen carefully."

Evelyn's eyes burned crimson as she enunciated each word: "I married Nathan of my own free will. No one forced me. I knew he loved another. I knew how cold he could be. Back then, I foolishly believed my passion could melt his frozen heart. I thought I could make him love me. But I failed. These are my mistakes to bear - they have nothing to do with him. And I won't allow you to harass him or cause him harm!"

Maxwell reeled as if struck.

"Maxwell, I can't move past this."

Evelyn sighed, pain flickering in her eyes. "Truthfully, I've loved Nathan for so long that even divorced, he still matters to me. Why can't we let things end quietly? Why must you drag me back into his life when I'm trying to move forward? When you attacked him, did you consider my feelings?"

"Evelyn, please forgive me! I'll do anything! I swear I'll never trouble Nathan again!" Maxwell begged, eyes brimming with tears.

This hardened agent who'd faced death countless times now trembled before the possibility of losing his sister's forgiveness.

"Little sister..."

A sly glint flashed through Evelyn's sorrowful gaze. She pouted delicately, voice softening to a honeyed tone. "Then you'll come home with me for dinner with Harrison in two days."

Sebastian and Dominic exchanged knowing glances.

Though reluctant, Maxwell had no choice but to agree. "Fine! I'll go with you."
###Chapter 131

The press conference shattered the carefully crafted elite image Penelope had built for Cassandra over the years.

That evening, Cassandra collapsed in exhaustion. Servants had to carry her into Cliffside Manor.

"Mother! You must help me get revenge!" Cassandra sobbed uncontrollably, her face streaked with tears. "The entire internet is mocking me! I can't show my face in public anymore!"

Penelope's eyes flashed with fury. "And how exactly should I avenge you? Should I attack Nathan? Or force him to resign and hand his CEO position to an incompetent girl like you?"

She jabbed her finger at Cassandra's tear-stained face. "I specifically told you to memorize the statement I prepared! I ordered you to appear without makeup to show sincerity! But you threw my instructions out the window! Now you must face the consequences! What's the point of crying? Even your father won't intervene!"

Cassandra dropped to her knees, clutching Penelope's legs. "I was wrong, Mother! I should have listened! I'll never disobey you again!"

Her tears suddenly stopped as venom filled her voice. "Though Nathan shares some blame, that bitch Evelyn is the real culprit! If she hadn't forced me to apologize, none of this would have happened!"

Penelope's eyes narrowed dangerously. "We'll handle Evelyn soon enough. Your grandfather's birthday approaches. I've already arranged for Evelyn to humiliate herself while you reclaim your dignity."

"What's your plan, Mother?" Cassandra sniffed, her mood lifting at the prospect of revenge.

Penelope smirked coldly. "You'll see when the time comes."

A sudden notification chimed on Cassandra's phone. Her scream pierced the night, startling Penelope.

"Must you shriek like a banshee?" Penelope snapped.

"I'll kill that whore Evelyn!" Cassandra shrieked, her face contorted with rage.

Simultaneously, Penelope's phone rang. Victoria's worried voice came through. "Aunt Penelope, did you see the photo I sent Cassandra?"

"What photo?" Penelope grabbed Cassandra's phone, her eyes widening at the image.

Victoria continued, "I saw Evelyn with Julian Montgomery at Grandview Galleria today. They looked so intimate everyone assumed they were a couple. Julian even gave her an exquisite sapphire necklace - the same one Nathan wanted to buy for me!"

She sighed dramatically. "To me, it's just jewelry. But Cassandra's future is at stake. If Evelyn comes between her and Julian..."

"That scheming little tramp!" Penelope's grip tightened on the phone. "Can't she survive one day without seducing men? How dare she target my future son-in-law!"

Her lips curled into a vicious smile. "If she enjoys stealing men, I'll make sure she gets exactly what she deserves!"

Penelope thought darkly, Let Evelyn enjoy her brief moment of triumph. Reginald's birthday party will be her downfall!

Meanwhile, Nathan spent three days recovering in Kingsley Medical Center.

He kept his hospitalization secret, dismissing it as unnecessary trouble. When Victoria called, he invented excuses to avoid her visiting.

Each night, memories of forcibly kissing Evelyn haunted him.

The phantom sensation of her soft lips tormented him.

I must be losing my mind! Nathan cursed, Alcohol truly is the root of all evil!

He vowed never to kiss Evelyn again.

When she failed to visit by the fourth day, his anger flared.

What a cold-hearted woman!

Oliver entered with discharge papers and a tailored suit. "Mr. Blackwood, the doctor cleared you for release."

"Has Evelyn contacted you?" Nathan demanded coldly.

"No, sir."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Her people nearly killed me, and she thinks she can ignore this?"

His expression darkened. "Did you retrieve my National Defense Academy graduation album?"

"Yes, sir." Oliver produced a navy-blue album from his briefcase.
###Chapter 132

Nathan Blackwood took the graduation album in his hands, flipping through the pages with deliberate precision.

That masked assailant from that night had moved with military precision—too similar to his own combat style. Though the man's face had been concealed, those piercing eyes had struck a chord of familiarity in Nathan's memory.

Having graduated from West Point, Nathan possessed exceptional investigative instincts. He methodically covered each cadet's face in the album with his palm, focusing solely on their eyes, comparing them to the haunting gaze burned into his mind.

After what felt like an eternity, Nathan suddenly shot to his feet, his expression electrified. Oliver Sinclair startled at the abrupt movement.

"Mr. Blackwood, did you find something?"

"It's him."

The photograph depicted a striking young man in full military dress, his sharp jawline accentuated by the uniform's crisp lines. Thick brows framed intense, knowing eyes—eyes that held secrets.

Beneath the image read the name: Maxwell Kingsley.

Evelyn Carter. Maxwell Kingsley.

Of course he called her 'baby sis.'

Nathan's lips curled faintly. He remembered Maxwell vividly—they had been rivals at the academy, constantly neck-and-neck in every drill, every simulation. Where Nathan excelled in strategy, Maxwell countered with uncanny adaptability.

After graduation, Maxwell had vanished without a trace.

A thrill shot through Nathan—not from uncovering his attacker's identity, but from peeling back the layers of Evelyn's enigmatic past.

Yet, he knew frustratingly little about Maxwell. Military records were sealed tighter than vaults.

But one truth settled in his chest like a weight: Maxwell was her brother. Not a lover.

The relief was instantaneous.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts.

Oliver opened the door, his posture stiffening at the sight of their visitor.

"Mr. Winslow."

Theodore Winslow stood framed in the doorway, an exquisitely wrapped gift basket in hand. His smile was polished, diplomatic. "Ms. Carter sent me to check on Mr. Blackwood's condition. Has he been discharged?"

"Come in," Nathan answered coolly.

Oliver stepped aside reluctantly.

Theodore set the basket on the table with deliberate care. "Ms. Carter predicted you'd recover swiftly. It seems she was correct."

"Just you?" Nathan's gaze flicked past him toward the empty hallway, his jaw tightening.

"Ms. Carter is occupied with Monarch Group affairs. As her personal secretary, I handle such matters on her behalf."

Theodore's tone was smooth, but the unspoken jab lingered—she couldn’t be bothered.

Nathan's expression darkened. "I don’t need hollow gestures. Take it back."

Theodore didn’t flinch. "Ms. Carter’s instructions were clear: if you refuse it, discard it. She doesn’t reclaim gifts."

"Tell Evelyn to come herself." Nathan rose, his broad silhouette cutting against the sunlight streaming through the windows.

Theodore’s smile didn’t waver. "I’m afraid that’s impossible. She’s delegated all matters concerning you to me—including compensation. Name your terms. Within reason, of course."

"I said," Nathan enunciated slowly, "I want to see her."

"No."

"Then get out."

Oliver stepped forward, bristling. "You’re here to provoke him, aren’t you?"

Theodore’s smirk was answer enough.

Nathan’s voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "Relay this to Evelyn: if she doesn’t tell me who that attacker was, this isn’t over."

Theodore’s eyes glinted. "Blackwood Industries’ legal team is formidable, but Monarch Group’s holds its own. If you sue your ex-wife on the eve of your wedding, Sebastian Kingsley won’t stand idle."

A beat of silence.

Then Theodore added, almost gently, "Litigation should be a last resort, Mr. Blackwood. Surely you know that."

With a curt bow, he turned to leave—then paused. "One last thing. Ms. Carter wishes to know: was it you who orchestrated Cassandra’s press conference?"

Nathan’s reply was ice. "That’s none of your concern."

Theodore’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Very well. Good day."

The door clicked shut.

Oliver exhaled sharply. "That man didn’t come to visit. He came to taunt you."

Nathan’s fingers curled into fists. "Have him followed. I want every move he makes reported to me."

Oliver nodded, already reaching for his phone.

Nathan stared at the gift basket, his mind racing.

This wasn’t just about Maxwell anymore.

It was about her.
###Chapter 133

In the executive office of Monarch Grand Hotels, Evelyn Carter was supposed to be buried in paperwork. Instead, she was engrossed in a video game, her fingers flying across the controller.

On the screen, her character—a chainsaw-wielding butcher—chased down terrified survivors.

A half-empty beer bottle and a box of crispy fried chicken sat on her desk. Gaming snacks were her guilty pleasure.

To Evelyn, life’s simplest joys were irreplaceable: summer barbecues, winter cheese fondue, and greasy fried chicken paired with pixelated victories.

Her mind drifted to her marriage with Nathan Blackwood. For three years, she had endured her smoke allergy, masking up to prepare gourmet meals for him.

She had hoped to win his heart the way Camille Kingsley had won Harrison’s—through culinary mastery.

So, she secretly enrolled in Crestview’s most prestigious culinary institute. She was the only woman in her class.

By graduation, her skills surpassed even her instructor’s. He begged her to stay as his protégé, convinced she could become a world-renowned chef.

Yet, Nathan barely noticed.

He rarely dined at home, and when he did, he offered no praise.

How many crushed hopes could one endure? Evelyn had suffered silently for three years.

She viciously bit into another piece of fried chicken, pretending it was Nathan’s throat.

At least now, she was free.

If time travel existed, she’d reclaim every wasted moment spent loving him and instead cherish her family—Harrison, Sebastian, Dominic, and Maxwell.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Theodore Winslow entered.

"Ms. Carter, I delivered the gift and relayed your message."

Evelyn’s expression remained cool. "He refused a private settlement?"

Theodore nodded. "He insists you hand over Maxwell. Otherwise, no deal."

She scoffed. "The audacity. As if he can dictate terms."

Exiting the game, she lounged back, beer in one hand, chicken in the other. "I checked the scene. No surveillance footage. He has no proof Maxwell assaulted him. Even if he sues, he’ll lose."

The Kingsleys were fiercely protective. No one harmed their own without consequences.

Theodore hesitated. "But Nathan suspects something. When I visited, I saw the military academy’s yearbook on his nightstand. He’s digging."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

"It doesn’t matter. The academy encrypted Maxwell’s records. He’s never appeared in Monarch Group’s public events. Nathan can search all he wants—he’ll die of exhaustion before finding anything."

Yara Brown had given birth to quadruplets. Sebastian and Dominic took their father’s surname, while Donovan and Maxwell inherited hers.

Sebastian and Dominic were identical. Donovan and Maxwell, fraternal.

A perfect cover.

"What about the press conference?" Evelyn asked.

Theodore grimaced. "He called it a Blackwood family matter and said we had no right to interfere. Glared at me like I owed him a fortune."

Evelyn smirked. "I know Nathan. He’s a scoundrel in love but rigidly principled otherwise. If he denied it, he’d say so outright. His evasion confirms it."

Theodore gaped. "Why sabotage his own family’s reputation? He’s the CEO of Blackwood Industries!"

A memory flashed—Nathan pulling her into a bruising kiss. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

She tossed the chicken bone into the trash with perfect aim.

"Who knows? Maybe he’s developed a neurodegenerative disorder I missed in our three years of marriage."
###Chapter 134

The sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantom with license plate EVA676 idled outside Monarch Grand Hotel's entrance, its polished chrome gleaming under the golden sunset. Pedestrians slowed their pace, casting admiring glances at the luxury vehicle that screamed wealth and power.

Meanwhile, a matte black Maybach lurked in the shadows of a side alley, its tinted windows revealing nothing.

Nathan Blackwood sat rigid in the backseat, his stormy gray eyes tracking every movement near the hotel entrance. His jaw clenched as he drummed impatient fingers against his knee.

Then she appeared.

Evelyn Carter emerged from the hotel's revolving doors, Theodore Winslow following closely behind. The evening breeze caught the hem of her powder blue chiffon dress, making the delicate fabric dance around her ankles.

Nathan's breath hitched. He'd never seen her like this before.

During their marriage, Evelyn had always dressed modestly - simple cotton dresses, flat shoes, minimal makeup. Now she looked every inch the Kingsley heiress she was born to be. The silk dress clung to her curves before flaring at the waist, the neckline dipping just enough to be elegant rather than provocative. Her hair, usually tied back, cascaded in loose waves over her shoulders.

A bitter taste filled Nathan's mouth. He could have given her designer gowns, diamond jewelry, anything her heart desired. Why had she chosen to play the meek little wife all those years?

"Follow them," Nathan growled as Evelyn slid into the Rolls-Royce.

The Maybach pulled away from the curb just as the Phantom did, maintaining a careful distance.

Inside the Rolls-Royce, Evelyn beamed as she handed Sebastian Kingsley a thick folder. "Look at these numbers, Seb. Two months and I've already exceeded projections. Not bad for someone who's been out of the game for three years, huh?"

Sebastian's proud smile softened his usually sharp features as he flipped through the reports. "You've always been brilliant, little star. Dad will be thrilled." His fingers gently brushed a stray lock of hair from her face. "Though I still think you're pushing yourself too hard."

"Hardly!" Evelyn's eyes sparkled with determination. "This is just the beginning. Monarch Group will dominate not just Fairhaven, but Crestview too. Blackwood Industries' monopoly is about to end."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "You're aiming straight for Nathan's territory then?"

"Business is business," Evelyn said coolly, her manicured nails tapping against the leather seat. "I lost the battle in love, but I'll win the war in the boardroom."

"Spoken like a true Kingsley." Sebastian chuckled. "Though I should warn you, Nathan won't make it easy."

"Good." Evelyn's lips curved into a feline smile. "I wouldn't want it to be easy."

Behind them, the Maybach maintained its pursuit.

"Sir, they're definitely heading to Fairhaven," Oliver Sinclair observed from the driver's seat.

Nathan's grip tightened on his knee. "She wouldn't dare."

"Mr. Blackwood... if Mr. Kingsley is taking her to meet his parents..." Oliver trailed off nervously.

"She's still my wife!" Nathan's voice was dangerously low. "The divorce isn't finalized yet. Is she so eager to replace me that she'd flaunt her new relationship in front of my entire city?"

Oliver hesitated. "But after Old Master Reginald's birthday party..."

Nathan's chest constricted at the unspoken truth. Once the divorce was finalized, he'd have no claim over Evelyn whatsoever. The thought sent an unfamiliar pang through him.

As the Rolls-Royce crossed the bridge into Fairhaven's exclusive district, Nathan's phone buzzed with an incoming call from his grandfather. He ignored it, his gaze fixed on the car ahead carrying the woman who had once been his, but now seemed determined to become his greatest rival.
###Chapter 135

The sleek Rolls-Royce glided through the ornate iron gates of Willow Creek Estate, its tires crunching lightly over the gravel driveway.

From the moment the car entered the grounds, servants scattered like excited birds, their voices carrying the news through the sprawling mansion.

"Ms. Evelyn is back!"

As Evelyn Carter and Sebastian Kingsley stepped out of the car, the head butler, Frederick Hollis, stood at attention with a line of staff flanking the grand entrance. They bowed in perfect unison.

"Welcome home, Ms. Evelyn!"

"May you be blessed with health and happiness, Ms. Evelyn!"

Evelyn pressed a hand to her forehead, amused. If only immortality were that easy.

"Evelyn! Finally!"

She turned to see Lillian Hartwell, her father’s second wife, and another woman sprinting toward her. The second woman—Sophia Kingsley—was dressed in a sleek purple satin blouse with a bow-tied silk scarf, paired with wide-leg trousers. Tall and effortlessly elegant, she moved like a runway model.

"Aunt Lillian, Aunt Sophia."

Evelyn grinned and embraced them both.

Sebastian watched the scene with a quiet smile, though his chest tightened with unspoken emotions.

The Kingsley family was the most powerful dynasty in Fairhaven, but their household dynamics were anything but simple. Every time Harrison Kingsley brought home a new wife, chaos followed—especially with Sophia, who was barely eight years older than Sebastian himself.

It was why Evelyn had followed her brother Maxwell’s lead and left home years ago, joining Doctors Without Borders and wandering the world.

But over time, the genuine warmth of her stepmothers had chipped away at Evelyn’s icy resentment. Sebastian had shared countless stories about them, slowly mending the rift between Evelyn and the women who had, in their own way, tried to love her.

Besides, if Evelyn was going to blame anyone, it should be Harrison.

"Evelyn, you’ve gotten thinner!" Sophia, a former martial artist, never minced words. She shot Sebastian an accusing look. "Sebastian, if you’re too busy to take care of her properly, just send her home. We’ll fatten her up like a prize pig! You promised she’d be well-fed, but she looks like a greyhound now. This is unacceptable!"

Sebastian sighed, torn between laughter and exasperation. "You’re right, Aunt Sophia. My apologies."

Evelyn chuckled. "Aunt Sophia, you know I have a fast metabolism. I eat like a horse but never gain weight."

Once bitter enemies, Evelyn and Sophia now treated each other like sisters. "Sebastian takes good care of me. He even lent me his chief secretary, Theodore. You know how skilled Theo is in the kitchen—he can prepare fish a dozen different ways. I’m hardly neglected."

Sophia scoffed. "I don’t believe it!"

She pinched Evelyn’s cheek lightly. "Can Theodore possibly outdo Camille? Your Aunt Camille started prepping ingredients the moment she heard you were coming home. She’s been in the kitchen all day, not even stopping for water. Harrison says she’s treating this like a state banquet—no, better than a state banquet!"

"I told Aunt Camille to keep it simple. It’s just a family dinner—what matters is being together."

Lillian sighed, shaking her head fondly. "We offered to help, but she refused. Said she couldn’t trust anyone else’s cooking."

"Because she definitely can’t trust Aunt Sophia," Evelyn teased. "Four burnt pots, three fire alarms, and two exploded stoves? No wonder Aunt Camille banned her from the kitchen."

"Hey! I thought we were friends!" Sophia lunged playfully, fingers aiming for Evelyn’s ribs.

"We are!" Evelyn laughed, dodging.

Their banter was effortless, like lifelong friends rather than former rivals.

Thinking of Camille made Evelyn recall her years with Nathan Blackwood.

For three years, she had tiptoed around, terrified of displeasing him, of giving the Blackwoods any reason to reject her.

In just three years, she had become a shadow of herself. How had Camille endured twenty?

Women shouldn’t diminish themselves for men, Evelyn thought. We should be bold, unbreakable, radiant. To cage ourselves in gilded mediocrity is the greatest waste of all.

Her stepmothers looped arms with her, guiding her toward the villa.

The night air was crisp, the estate bathed in quiet elegance.

Outside Willow Creek, hidden in the shadows, Nathan’s Maybach idled silently.

Oliver Sinclair opened the car door, and Nathan stepped out, his gaze fixed on the Kingsley residence.

"I’ve heard rumors about Harrison Kingsley’s obsession with classical architecture—how he’s collected mansions across the country. Seeing it in person, I realize the rumors didn’t do it justice."

Oliver studied the intricate estate, awe coloring his voice. "It’s like a royal palace. Even Cliffside Manor pales in comparison."
###Chapter 136

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened as the lights from Kingsley Manor reflected in his eyes. The distant laughter from Willow Creek Estate made him feel an icy loneliness settle in his chest.

Evelyn Carter, as Sebastian Kingsley's girlfriend, was clearly adored by the Kingsley family.

Nathan had initially assumed the Kingsley family dynamics would be complicated.

Harrison Kingsley had three mistresses in addition to his legal wife. Though they weren't officially married to him, they were treated as his spouses and had already borne his children.

Nathan had thought these women would be a major obstacle for Evelyn if she ever intended to marry Sebastian.

He had hoped the tension would push Evelyn to her limits, forcing her to walk away.

But to his surprise, Evelyn fit seamlessly into the Kingsley household. Even from this distance, he could hear their laughter—bright and unrestrained.

It was obvious how much they cherished her.

Nathan's face paled, bitterness twisting inside him. His chest tightened, making it hard to breathe.

"Got a cigarette?" he muttered.

——

"Harrison! I'm home!" Evelyn's voice rang through the grand living room the moment she stepped inside.

"What took you so long? I'm starving!"

Harrison sighed dramatically as he approached, flanked by Dominic.

"Oh my, look at you, all dressed up!" Evelyn teased, eyeing her father's impeccable attire. "Trying to outshine your own sons?"

Harrison wore a tailored three-piece suit, a crisp white shirt, and a gold pocket watch. Despite his age, he carried himself with the effortless elegance of a silver-screen tycoon.

"Outshine them?" He smirked. "I don't even need to try."

He adjusted his cuffs with a flourish. "I could wear a potato sack and still look like a leading man. Back in my prime, my face was on every calendar in the country. Women worshipped me."

"Ahem." Dominic cleared his throat. "Dad, 'worshipped' is a bit... funereal. People usually reserve that for the deceased."

"You little—!" Harrison shot him a glare. "No one would've noticed if you hadn't pointed it out!"

The unspoken response from everyone else: Oh, we noticed.

"You didn’t call Cassandra, Raymond, and Arabella back, did you?" Evelyn asked, concerned.

"Wouldn’t dare disobey your orders," Lillian Hartwell said with a knowing smile. "Don’t worry, I kept my mouth shut."

"Hmph! So you're the reason those little troublemakers didn’t come home. I was wondering why they were so heartless. Turns out they didn’t even know you were back."

Harrison sighed dramatically. "We should’ve had a proper family reunion tonight."

"Cassandra’s in Serenia—why drag her all the way back for one meal? Raymond’s buried in police work, and Arabella has exams. She can’t just skip school. Stop making a fuss! Isn’t it enough that we’re here?" Evelyn scolded.

"And Maxwell?" Harrison’s temper flared. "That boy does nothing but gallivant around. Crestview is two hours away. Is he dead?!"

"Maxwell is—"

Before Evelyn could finish, a smooth, amused voice cut in from behind her.

"I was waiting for you to yell at me. How else was I supposed to make my grand entrance?"

Everyone turned to see Maxwell Kingsley strolling in, hands tucked into the pockets of his black windbreaker. His smirk was pure mischief as he shook his head.

"Sorry to disappoint, Chairman Kingsley, but I’m alive and kicking."

The moment Maxwell appeared, Lillian and Sophia subtly retreated, their smiles fading. They knew better than to draw his attention—Maxwell despised them, and they weren’t eager to test his patience.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Of course he’d show up at the last possible second. He avoided this house like the plague.

"Where’s the food?" Maxwell asked, scanning the room. "You called me back for dinner, right? Let’s eat fast—I’ve got places to be."

His gaze flicked to Evelyn.

The unspoken message: I kept my end of the deal. Now you keep yours.

Evelyn blinked innocently and looked away, pretending not to understand.

The temperature in the room dropped.

Harrison’s jaw clenched as he stormed toward Maxwell.

"Send me a recent photo of yourself."

"What?"

"In case you drop dead one day, I’ll need something for your memorial. Now."
###Chapter 137

Maxwell smirked. Would you look at that? The old man's already wishing me dead the moment I walk in.

"That's a bit harsh, don't you think?"

His eyelids drooped lazily as he arched a brow. "Oh, I'll make sure to stay alive—just for you. Otherwise, who's gonna pull the plug when the time comes? Face it, you'll still need me in the end."

"You little bastard!" Harrison roared, veins bulging at his temples. "I'll beat the life out of you before you ever get the chance!"

He bellowed for Frederick to fetch his whip while struggling to yank off his custom-made Italian loafers, ready to hurl them at Maxwell's infuriating grin.

Sebastian and Dominic quickly stepped in, wedging themselves between the two before fists could fly. Lillian and Sophia rushed to calm Harrison, but his temper still burned hot.

Then, a soft voice cut through the chaos.

"Um... dinner's ready. Should we eat?"

The room fell silent as all heads turned.

Camille, Harrison's third wife, stood in the doorway, an apron tied around her waist and a wooden spoon in hand, blinking at the scene in mild bewilderment.

Right on cue, Harrison's stomach growled loudly.

"Fine! I'll deal with this brat after I've eaten!"

Relieved, the family trailed after him toward the dining hall.

Sebastian shot Maxwell a stern look. "That was too far. Dad's easygoing, but you shouldn't have said that."

"Who said I was joking?" Maxwell smirked.

"Maxwell Kingsley." Sebastian's voice turned icy.

Maxwell rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on. He cursed me first—I just gave him a taste of his own medicine." He sighed dramatically. "Fine, fine. I'll shut up if it makes you happy. Just stop glaring at me like that. I won't sleep tonight."

Shuddering, he muttered under his breath and stalked off to the dining room.

Sebastian's expression softened, and he followed with a resigned sigh.

Dominic chuckled, nudging him. "Damn. You're the only one who can tame him. One look from you, and he folds like a kicked puppy."

He mimicked Sebastian's signature glare—brows furrowed, eyes narrowed—then burst out laughing. "I should practice that. Maybe then he'll stop disrespecting me!"

Evelyn snorted. "Don't bother. You just look constipated."

Harrison was in unusually high spirits that evening, his cheeks flushed from glass after glass of wine. Lillian tried to stop him, but he waved her off.

Though he and Maxwell sat at opposite ends of the table, exchanging no words, it was obvious Harrison was thrilled his son had come home. His gaze kept flickering toward Maxwell when he thought no one was looking—as if he couldn't bear to look away.

Maxwell noticed but pointedly ignored him.

Harrison's smile dimmed.

Evelyn, ever observant, caught the exchange and tensed.

She knew Maxwell still held a grudge. He'd never forgiven their father for betraying their mother.

The Kingsleys were obscenely wealthy, their empire dwarfing some nations' GDP. Harrison's nine children would inherit more than most could earn in ten lifetimes—and he could afford nine more without breaking a sweat.

As Monarch Group's chairman, Harrison was magnetic, charming, and generous. In his youth, he'd survived multiple assassination attempts. By fifty, he'd rewritten business history.

A near-perfect man—except for his weakness for women.

No one was flawless.

As a child, Evelyn had thrown tantrums over his mistresses, just like Maxwell. But with age came acceptance.

If she couldn't change it, she'd let it go.

She wouldn't ask Maxwell to forgive Harrison or defend their father's actions. She just wanted him to move on—for his own sake. Only then could he heal.

After dinner, Maxwell leaned back with a satisfied sigh.

"Gotta admit, your mistress can cook. Three plates of pasta—I'll need to hit the gym tomorrow."

"Maxwell," Evelyn chided, swirling her wine. "Aunt Camille's been through enough."

"Doesn't change what she is now—Harrison's prized mistress. Most women would kill for that title."

His voice turned cold. "Tell me, Evelyn—who's really the victim here? Our mother. And we're all playing happy family. Does he ever think about her when he's picking which bed to crawl into at night?"
###Chapter 138

Evelyn's heart clenched painfully, her delicate brows furrowing. Of course I miss Mother. I think about her every day, but—

"Mother is gone, Maxwell. As her children, we must learn to face reality with maturity." Her voice trembled slightly. "We're Kingsleys too. We must protect our family and move forward."

"You can move on. I can't." Maxwell's jaw tightened. "I'm the reckless one who drowns in memories, unable to wake up. You'll always be my family, but this place... it's not home anymore."

A heavy silence settled between them.

"Fine." Maxwell sighed, noticing the unshed tears in Evelyn's eyes. He pulled her into a comforting embrace. "Don't be upset, Evie. I'll respect your choice, no matter what."

He softened his tone, eager to distract her. "Let's talk about something else. Guess who's here? Nathan Blackwood."

"What?!" Evelyn shot to her feet, her pulse skyrocketing.

The entire dining room froze.

Harrison Kingsley frowned from the head of the table. "Evelyn, what's gotten into you? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"She hasn't." Maxwell smirked, tugging her back into her seat. "Just told her a scary story. Didn't expect such a dramatic reaction."

"This isn't funny!" Evelyn hissed through gritted teeth. "That's worse than any ghost story!"

"Don't believe me? Go check the gates. Pretty sure he's still lurking there." Maxwell shrugged. "Relax, though. That bastard probably doesn't know your real identity yet. Must've tailed Sebastian's car here."

As if on cue, Evelyn's phone buzzed on the table.

Her breath hitched as she slowly flipped it over, dreading the caller ID.

The familiar number burned into her vision. She rejected the call instantly.

It rang again immediately.

Knowing Nathan's persistence, Evelyn excused herself to a quiet corner.

"Yes?" she whispered coldly.

"Is your injury healed?" Nathan's voice was rough yet velvety, like the sea breeze of Fairhaven brushing against her skin.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Yes."

"I'm outside the Kingsley estate. Come out." His command was as icy as ever.

Evelyn's temper flared. Nathan only reserved warmth for Victoria Sterling—with her, it was always demands. She owed him nothing now.

"Mr. Kingsley invited me for a family dinner. Everyone's here. I can't leave." Her tone turned arctic.

Nathan swayed slightly in the freezing wind, his ears ringing. A family dinner with the Kingsleys?

Laughter and clinking silverware echoed through the phone. A woman's gentle voice called, "Evelyn, dessert's ready! Come try the soufflé."

"I'll be right there," Evelyn responded sweetly.

Nathan's grip on his phone turned white-knuckled. The warmth and acceptance she had here—it was something he'd never experienced.

And because he'd never had it, he refused to let her keep it.

"Mr. Blackwood, I can't talk now. We'll discuss this when I return to Crestview. Goodbye."

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked with desperation.

Her breath quickened. That commanding tone made her skin crawl—she could almost feel his cold fingers wrapping around her wrist again.

"Come out now, or I'm coming in to get you. Your choice."

Nathan's vision blurred with fury. His body was numb, but his blood burned.

At this moment, nothing mattered except dragging her back where she belonged.
###Chapter 139

Evelyn's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Nathan Blackwood, what exactly do you want before you'll finally leave me alone?"

Her palms grew clammy as she clenched the phone. "Do you have any idea how despicable you are, stalking me like this?" she hissed through gritted teeth. "I never refused to take responsibility for your injuries. My secretary Theodore has been trying to reach you. Why are you causing such a scene now?!"

"If you want this settled privately," Nathan's voice dropped to a strained whisper, "I'm giving you that chance right now."

She could hear his uneven breathing through the receiver. "Meet me tonight, and I'll drop all charges against your brothers for assault."

"You—!" Evelyn gasped, outrage stealing her breath.

This couldn't be the same cold, calculating Nathan Blackwood she'd known. The man on the phone sounded like some obsessed stranger. She wanted to scream.

"Fine. I'll meet you," she snapped. "But you'd better keep your word about the settlement."

The phone nearly cracked under the force of her grip when she ended the call.

Meanwhile, inside Cliffside Manor...

"Madam Hartwell," Frederick the butler intercepted Lillian in the hallway, his expression grave. "There's a suspicious Maybach with license plate EVA676 parked outside our gates. Two men in black suits have been standing guard for over an hour, watching the house. Should I activate the security protocols?"

Lillian's perfectly sculpted brows drew together. "Don't alert Harrison yet. I'll handle this."

As Frederick retreated, Lillian swiftly gathered Camille and Sophia into the solarium for an emergency strategy session.

"Girls, we have a situation," Lillian announced, her emerald eyes glinting like polished jade.

Camille blinked her doe-like eyes. "What kind of situation?"

"Spit it out already!" Sophia demanded, cracking her knuckles.

"That bastard Nathan is here," Lillian hissed. "Right outside our gates. Probably harassing Evelyn again."

Sophia's face flushed crimson. "That heartless monster dares show his face here? I'll tear him limb from limb!"

Camille threw her full weight against Sophia to stop her charge. "Think about Evelyn! If you cause a scene, Harrison will find out. Then everything will blow up!"

"But that snake came slithering to our doorstep!" Sophia's voice shook with rage. "After everything he put Evelyn through—the humiliation, the divorce—how dare he? You can stand there, but I won't!"

Lillian seized Sophia's wrist. "None of us want to stand by! But remember—Evelyn begged us to stay out of this. Beating Nathan might feel good, but it'll only make things worse for her. She wants a clean break from the Blackwoods."

"Lillian..." Camille bit her lip. "What if Nathan isn't here to cause trouble? I did some research—he's famously cold, never shown interest in anyone except Victoria Sterling. For him to drive all the way from Crestview to Fairhaven... Do you think he regrets the divorce?"

"Mr. Blackwood?" Sophia scoffed. "That ice sculpture has no heart to regret with! Even if he did, it's too late! Evelyn's love isn't some toy he can discard and reclaim whenever—"

"I just saw Evelyn slip out the back," Lillian interrupted, a calculating smile playing on her lips. "She's probably going to meet him right now."

Camille gasped. "What should we do?"

"Camille, stay here and distract Harrison. Sophia..." Lillian's smile turned predatory. "You wanted to make Nathan pay? Tonight, you'll draw blood."

Outside, the autumn wind howled through Fairhaven's streets.

Oliver Sinclair shivered in his tailored suit, watching his boss stand motionless in the biting wind like some tragic romantic hero. With a resigned sigh, he adjusted his stance beside the Maybach.

An old ballad floated through Oliver's mind—something about fools and unrequited love. Perfect soundtrack for this ridiculous scene.
###Chapter 140

The lyrics that perfectly captured this moment whispered through my mind: Love is a winter gale. When it slips through your fingers,

when you watch it fade, the ache remains.

Nathan stood motionless in the freezing wind. The cold meant nothing to him - he'd endured far worse during his military days, standing guard for twenty-four hour shifts without complaint.

But his heart betrayed his calm exterior.

What if Evelyn changed her mind? What if she refused to come out? The thought clawed at him. Could he force his way into the Kingsley estate? Unthinkable.

What possible excuse did he have to knock on those imposing gates?

None came to mind.

His long lashes trembled as he exhaled sharply, pulling a cigarette from his coat pocket. The flame flickered as he brought it to his lips.

The sharp click of stilettos on pavement made his pulse spike.

"Nathan."

He looked up to see his ex-wife's icy expression. The cigarette between his fingers shook, ashes scattering.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the ground littered with cigarette butts. Her nose wrinkled in distaste. "I thought you quit."

"I was waiting." His voice sounded rough even to his own ears.

He crushed the cigarette underfoot, meeting her gaze directly.

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Planning to threaten me again? Go ahead. You always enjoyed pushing people around without cause."

"Nathan." His fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. The smoke had left his throat raw. "I came to see you. You got what you wanted. Now honor your word, Mr. Blackwood. Leave my brother alone. I'm going back inside. And clean up this mess - Fairhaven doesn't need your pollution."

She turned on her heel, every line of her body radiating dismissal.

Oliver shivered. This cold, formidable woman bore no resemblance to the warm, smiling wife he remembered - the one who used to light up whenever Mr. Blackwood entered the room.

What had his employer done to turn such devotion into such bitterness?

"Evelyn, wait!"

Nathan's command stopped her mid-step. She turned slowly, eyes flashing. "I don't take orders from you anymore. Or have you forgotten our divorce?"

That word struck like a physical blow. Nathan felt the air leave his lungs.

"You couldn't wait to discard me," she continued, voice dripping with scorn. "To make room for your precious Victoria. I gave you what you wanted, yet you still harass me. What more could you possibly demand?"

The accusation hung between them. Nathan's chest constricted.

"I told you from the beginning this was a contractual arrangement," he ground out. "I never promised you forever. The compensation was more than generous - you chose to walk away empty-handed. Don't rewrite history to paint yourself as some martyr, Evelyn. I never mistreated you. We're square. You have no right to keep punishing me!"

His voice broke on the last word. The truth tasted like ashes in his mouth.
###Chapter 141

The atmosphere froze into an icy silence.

Oliver Sinclair's hands trembled as he watched Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Carter standing inches apart, their tension crackling like live wires. He desperately wanted to intervene before another explosive confrontation erupted between them.

Evelyn's laughter rang out, sharp and brittle. Tears glistened in her starry eyes, refracting the garden lights like shattered diamonds.

"Nathan," she said, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion. "I'll admit my mistakes. I overestimated my ability to make you love me. I foolishly believed persistence could melt your heart. All I gained was humiliation and regret. But you're wrong about one thing."

She drew a shuddering breath. "Even when you forced me away, I never hated you. I wanted a peaceful goodbye, but you keep tearing open old wounds. Now I have no choice but to remove you from my life completely - the unwanted ghost haunting my fresh start."

Her words struck Nathan like physical blows. His heart stuttered painfully, as if someone had pressed pause on his very existence.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn continued coolly, "it's getting late. Please escort Mr. Sinclair home."

She turned abruptly, determined to walk away before her composure shattered. A man who couldn't recognize her love didn't deserve her tears.

Nathan's hand shot out, fingers clamping around her wrist with bruising force. When she whirled back in shock, she found herself staring into his bloodshot eyes.

"Let go!" She wrenched her arm free.

Before Nathan could respond, a cutting voice sliced through the tension. "Mr. Blackwood! Surely a man of your standing knows better than to manhandle my future daughter-in-law on my doorstep at this hour!"

Lillian Hartwell and Sophia Kingsley approached like avenging angels. Evelyn quickly put distance between herself and Nathan, her pulse racing.

"Future... daughter-in-law?" Nathan's voice sounded hollow, his mind reeling.

"Do we need to spell it out?" Lillian draped a protective arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "Sebastian brought Evelyn home for dinner tonight to formally introduce her to the family. She's perfect for him - beautiful, principled, utterly devoted. Even the chairman approves. We're just waiting to meet her parents and set the wedding date."

Evelyn nearly choked on her surprise. She appreciated their support, but this performance was beyond dramatic.

Nathan felt like his chest had been carved open, leaving only a howling void.

"If memory serves," Sophia added with lethal sweetness, "you recently announced your engagement through the media. Shouldn't you be with your fiancée instead of harassing Evelyn? We don't care if you ruin your reputation, but we won't tolerate you dragging her down. Cross that line again, and you'll regret it."

Evelyn knew Sophia preferred action over words. The fact she was speaking rather than throwing punches meant Lillian and Camille must have intervened.

Oliver rubbed his temples. For heaven's sake, why had Nathan come here asking for this humiliation?

Nathan's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists, trembling with suppressed emotion. He was losing his grip on her, and it terrified him. Why couldn't he let go when he'd been the one to push her away?

"Aunt Lillian, Aunt Sophia," Evelyn said gently, "it's chilly tonight. You'll catch cold dressed like that. Let's go inside."

Her casual use of "home" struck Nathan like a physical blow, erecting an invisible barrier that excluded him completely.

"Evelyn... is this true?" Nathan's voice was raw with anguish.

She took a steadying breath and committed to the charade. "Yes."

"Good. That's... good."

Nathan's ashen face betrayed his pain as he mechanically repeated the word. With shaking hands, he produced a velvet jewelry box.

"A wedding gift," he forced out, pressing it into her palm before turning away, his broad shoulders hunched against the cold night.
###Chapter 142

Evelyn's sapphire eyes widened in shock, her fingers trembling slightly at her sides. She couldn't bring herself to reach for the velvet box.

The fact that Nathan had been carrying this jewelry case with him all along sent an unexpected pang through her chest.

"Evelyn feels uncomfortable accepting gifts from you now," Sophia interjected sharply. "I'll take it for her."

Before Evelyn could protest, Sophia's manicured fingers snatched the box from Nathan's outstretched hand.

The lid flipped open with a soft click, revealing a breathtaking amethyst bracelet that caught the afternoon light.

The gemstone was exquisite - a rare imperial purple jade of the highest quality, its surface shimmering with inner fire.

Evelyn recognized it immediately as one of those priceless pieces that couldn't be found in ordinary jewelry stores. A year ago, receiving such a gift would have made her heart soar.

Now the icy numbness in her chest remained unbroken.

Love given too late was meaningless. Just like apologies offered after the damage was done.

"Ha!" Sophia's laugh was razor-sharp. "I may not be a certified gemologist, but even I can tell this is worth a fortune." Her fingers tightened around the bracelet. "Thanks for the donation, Mr. Blackwood."

With a sudden violent motion, Sophia hurled the bracelet to the marble floor. The sound of shattering jade echoed through the lobby.

Nathan's face drained of color as the fragments scattered between them like broken promises.

Evelyn's fists clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palms. She couldn't bring herself to meet Nathan's gaze.

"Mrs. Kingsley!" Oliver stepped forward, his face flushed with outrage. "That was Mr. Blackwood's gift for Ms. Carter! Even if you refuse it, you had no right to destroy it!"

Sophia ground the fragments beneath her stiletto with deliberate cruelty. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood - why wait until after the divorce? Now that Evelyn has moved on, you suddenly remember your manners?" Her voice dripped with venom. "Is this your idea of revenge? Trying to make her look like the villain?"

Each word struck Nathan like a physical blow. His throat worked as he stared at Evelyn with shattered eyes.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She grabbed Sophia's arm. "Let's go."

"Young Madam!" Oliver's disappointed gaze burned into Evelyn's back as she walked away.

If even Oliver felt this betrayed, she couldn't imagine Nathan's pain.

"Good riddance," Sophia muttered, linking arms with Evelyn. "Some people just can't take a hint."

Lillian threw Nathan one last contemptuous glance. "You made your bed, Mr. Blackwood. Now lie in it."

Back at the Kingsley estate, Evelyn's carefully constructed composure crumbled. The image of that broken bracelet - and Nathan's equally broken expression - haunted her.

She understood Sophia and Lillian's anger, but their cruelty had crossed a line. Now she looked like the heartless one.

"Evelyn!"

Dominic burst into the room, his face flushed with exertion. "You need to come quick! Maxwell and Father are at it again - Father just struck him!"
###Chapter 143

The backyard was cloaked in shadows as Maxwell Kingsley stormed toward his Lamborghini, his expression colder than the night air.

"Maxwell!"

Evelyn Carter sprinted after him, breathless. She seized his arm. "Where are you going?"

"As far away from this place as possible." His voice was sharp, edged with bitterness. "Better yet, maybe I should never come back."

He turned, revealing the angry red mark on his cheek—a stark reminder of the earlier confrontation.

"You always said Sebastian, Dominic, and I mattered most to you," Evelyn whispered, her grip tightening. "This is your home. How can you just leave?"

Maxwell's dark eyes bore into hers. He lifted a hand, brushing his thumb gently over her cheek. "You'll always be in my heart, no matter where I am. The world is my home." His lips curved into a sardonic smile. "I kept my promise, Evelyn. So you can't be angry with me anymore, right?"

She nodded, her throat tightening.

"If you truly want Harrison to live longer," he added, his tone hardening, "don't ask me to see him again. I have duties to return to. I'll see you when I can."

"Maxwell!"

Lillian Hartwell hurried toward them, clutching a small bag.

Maxwell stiffened slightly before murmuring, "Aunt Lillian."

Her eyes were red-rimmed as she pressed the bag into his hands. "Here. Some of our family's newest medicines—some for external use, some oral. They might help." She forced a smile. "Camille packed snacks too. She worries you'll get hungry on the road."

A flicker of emotion crossed Maxwell's face. "Thank you," he said softly, "but I have everything I need. Don't worry about me."

With that, he pulled Evelyn into a brief embrace and strode to his car.

The Lamborghini roared to life, its taillights vanishing into the night.

Evelyn and Lillian stood in silence, the weight of the moment pressing down on them.

"Let him go, Aunt Lillian," Evelyn murmured, squeezing her shoulder. "He's changed. The old Maxwell would never have been this restrained. Give him time."

Lillian's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "He pities me, Evelyn. He doesn’t need to. I’ve moved on."

Evelyn swallowed hard.

Two years ago, tragedy had struck the Kingsley family.

Lillian's eldest son, Henry Kingsley—Evelyn's fifth brother—had been the chief captain of Crestview Airways. When flight EVA676 malfunctioned, he made the impossible choice to land in the ocean, saving 150 passengers.

Henry never surfaced. He drowned on his 27th birthday.

Opinions varied, but no one could deny Lillian had raised a hero.

Nathan Blackwood's Maybach sped back toward Crestview.

Oliver Sinclair gripped the wheel, stealing nervous glances at his boss through the rearview mirror.

Nathan's face was ashen, his lips bloodless. His knuckles were white where they clenched the armrest.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you—"

"Just drive." Nathan's voice was raw.

He had come to Fairhaven on impulse, convinced he could make Evelyn submit.

Instead, he had been humiliated beyond measure.

What shattered tonight wasn’t just the jade bracelet—it was the last remnants of his pride.

"With all due respect, sir," Oliver muttered, unable to contain his frustration, "if you want Ms. Carter back, just remind the Kingsleys the divorce isn’t finalized. She’s still legally your wife. Those women had no right to—"

"So you think the only way I can reclaim Evelyn is through legal technicalities?" Nathan's voice was dangerously quiet.

Oliver paled. "No! That’s not what I meant!"
###Chapter 144

Oliver wiped the sweat from his brow nervously. "Sir, if you still have feelings for Ms. Evelyn, why don't you just tell her?"

"Tell her?" Nathan let out a bitter laugh, his jaw tightening. "I've made my decision. I will never remarry Evelyn Carter."

"Then why did you go to see her tonight?"

"Just drive!"

Nathan's voice was rough with suppressed fury, startling Oliver into silence.

Slumping back into the leather seat, Nathan suddenly winced as a sharp pain shot through his palm.

Only then did he remember—he had been clutching the shattered fragment of the violet jade bracelet this entire time.

Now, the jagged edge had cut deep, staining his skin with dark crimson.

Nathan didn't understand himself. Tonight, he had wanted to drag Evelyn away, to tear her from Sebastian's side by any means necessary. He just needed them apart.

After saying goodbye to Maxwell, Evelyn returned to finish dinner with Sebastian and Dominic, comforting her father before finally stepping out of the study, utterly drained.

Pausing in the hallway, she pulled out her phone and sent identical messages to Lillian, Camille, and Sophia.

[Meet me in the garden pavilion. We need to talk.]

Fifteen minutes later, the three women arrived, their usual lively chatter replaced by uneasy silence.

Evelyn sat with her arms crossed, her expression stern—like a headmistress about to discipline unruly students.

Lillian and Camille remained quiet.

Sophia, however, broke first. "Evelyn, didn't you call us here? Why are you interrogating us?"

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. Sophia can be so dense sometimes.

"You ambushed Nathan earlier. Don’t you have anything to say for yourselves?"

"Pfft. What’s there to say?" Sophia plopped down inelegantly, one leg swinging over the other.

"If Lillian and Camille hadn’t stopped me, I would’ve skewered that bastard a thousand times and fed him to Bruno!"

"Who’s Bruno?" Evelyn asked.

Lillian sighed. "Sophia’s pet alligator. Harrison gave it to her last birthday."

Evelyn stared.

Camille, sensing Evelyn’s rising anger, tugged at Sophia’s sleeve. "Sophia, stop—"

"Everything I say comes from the heart! We shouldn’t lie to family!"

Sophia’s eyes burned with fury. "Evelyn, Nathan Blackwood is heartless! Even Bruno has more humanity than him! You gave everything to the Blackwoods for three years—a pampered princess reduced to his miserable wife and personal maid! And how did he repay you? He forced a divorce for his own selfish desires and married another woman the second he could! He’s worse than an animal! Even if he never loved you, he had no right to destroy you like this! Why hasn’t lightning struck him dead yet?!"

"He told me from the beginning he didn’t love me. Him marrying his 'true love' was inevitable." Evelyn’s voice was hollow. "I lost. I can walk away. Why do you keep dragging me back into this? It only makes it harder."

She pressed her fingers to her temples, exhaustion etched into every word. "The more I linger, the more it hurts. I just want to let go and move on."

"Move on?!"

Sophia shot up, gripping Evelyn’s shoulders. "How can you say that?! After everything he took from you—after you carried his child—and that monster didn’t even care—!"

Evelyn’s face drained of color. Sophia’s words were a blade, carving open old wounds. The pain radiated through her bones.

"Sophia! We agreed never to bring that up!" Lillian lunged forward, pulling her back.

"Stop it, Sophia! Don’t make her relive that!" Camille pleaded.

"He never knew."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, tears glistening but unshed. "I never told Nathan about the baby."
###Chapter 145

This was the most excruciating memory Evelyn had buried deep within her soul.

After losing her unborn child two years ago, Evelyn couldn't bear to walk past any baby stores.

She avoided all conversations about children. Even seeing infant commercials on television would send her into silent sobs, clutching her head in agony.

That fateful Christmas Eve remained etched in Evelyn's mind. She and Reginald had been driving to Crescent Bay to witness the rare snowfall when the accident happened. Ignoring her own injuries, she carried the unconscious old man to a taxi, buying precious time for his rescue.

At that time, the Blackwood family was vacationing in Valmont, while Nathan was celebrating Christmas with Victoria in Silvercrest.

Evelyn endured unbearable abdominal pain until Marcus Underwood arrived. Then darkness claimed her.

"Young Madam! You're hemorrhaging!"

In her fading consciousness, Evelyn saw the crimson tide staining her clothes. That warm, sticky sensation became her eternal nightmare.

That's how she discovered her two-month pregnancy.

Before she could embrace motherhood's joy, she'd lost Nathan's child forever.

"Young Madam! I'll contact Master Nathan immediately!"

Marcus fumbled with his phone in panic, but Evelyn grabbed his wrist.

"Don't... Please..."

Tears streamed down her face as she begged. "Nathan doesn't know... If he finds out, he'll be devastated... Please keep this secret for me?"

Clutching her empty womb, Evelyn wept until her voice shattered.

Watching Evelyn relive this trauma, Sophia panicked and pulled her into a fierce embrace. Lillian and Camille joined the protective circle, their arms forming an unbreakable shield.

"It's my fault! Forgive me, Evelyn... I won't mention it again..." Sophia, usually sharp-tongued, stumbled over her comforting words.

"Actually... I should be grateful."

Evelyn forced a brittle smile. "Better this way than letting my child grow up witnessing their parents' broken marriage... At least they were spared this cruel world."

Sleep eluded Evelyn that night.

Behind closed eyelids, she kept seeing the blood and that tiny, lifeless form. She curled into a fetal position beneath the blankets, yet no warmth could penetrate her icy grief.

In those dark days following her loss, Evelyn cried until her tears ran dry.

Bullets on the battlefield hadn't made her flinch, but this loss shattered her soul.

"Forgive me, little one," she whispered into the darkness. "Mommy failed you. Will we ever meet again?"

At dawn, Evelyn descended the stairs looking every inch the elegant heiress despite her sleepless night.

"Evelyn, I made your favorite breakfast. Eat before you leave?" Camille adjusted her apron, noting Evelyn's bloodshot eyes with a pang.

"Please pack it, Aunt Camille. I'll eat in the car." Evelyn's radiant smile belied her sorrow. "Morning meeting at the hotel - can't be late."

"Of course. I'll include extra for Theodore too." Camille's maternal smile warmed the kitchen.

"My thanks, Madam Camille." Theodore bowed as he entered.

Evelyn departed Cliffside Manor quietly, not wishing to disturb Harrison's sleep. She'd return to Crestview without farewells.

"Evelyn, remember - if those Blackwoods trouble you at the hotel, tell us immediately!" Lillian's eyes flashed with remembered anger from the charity auction incident. "Next time I'll use a mouth ulcer poison! Silence their venomous tongues!"

"Paralysis would be better!" Sophia cracked her knuckles. "Teach those Blackwoods to mess with our Evelyn!"

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

The Larson medical empire spanned Crestview and Fairhaven's finest hospitals. As heir to this legacy, Lillian's pharmaceutical skills were formidable - making her threats far from empty.
###Chapter 146

"Actually..." Evelyn cleared her throat nervously. "There's something I'd like your help with."

Lillian and Sophia Kingsley leaned forward eagerly. "Tell us!"

"Well..."

She hesitated before continuing. "I want that antique rosewood chair Harrison sent Aunt Lillian to bid on at the charity auction."

Their eyes widened in surprise. "That's quite the request!" Sophia gasped.

Harrison Kingsley was known for his generosity when it came to material possessions - houses, cars, money flowed freely from him. But when it came to antiques, artworks, or rare collectibles? That was an entirely different matter.

Even a simple Victorian silver ring would be difficult to pry from his hands, let alone a $100 million antique rosewood chair!

"The only way he'd willingly give it to me is if he wasn't in his right mind." Lillian sighed, rubbing her temples. "What do you need it for? Maybe I can find a convincing reason."

Evelyn shook her head. "If I tell you the real reason, he'll never agree to part with it."

"Don't worry, Evelyn!" Sophia declared confidently, thumping her chest. "If Harrison refuses, I'll just steal it for you!"

Evelyn burst into laughter at the outrageous suggestion.

Indeed, the most dangerous thieves were always family members.

Meanwhile, back in Crestview, Nathan Blackwood had a restless night. He arrived at his office the next morning looking thoroughly exhausted.

During the morning, Victoria Sterling called twice. Though he answered, his responses were distracted at best.

Victoria prattled on about wedding details - her custom-designed gown, limited edition jewelry collection, and the elaborate fairytale-themed venue she'd chosen. She suggested they could move up their wedding date after Reginald Blackwood's 80th birthday celebration the following weekend.

"Don't you think these ideas are perfect, Nathan? I had the wedding planners work on them for over a month before finalizing everything." Victoria's tone practically begged for compliments about her organizational skills.

"Yeah, whatever you prefer." Nathan's disinterested reply came as he stared at the shattered purple jade bracelet in the jewelry box before him. His mind kept replaying the image of Evelyn standing with the Kingsley family, their collective rejection burning in his memory.

Snap!

He slammed the box shut with unnecessary force, exhaling sharply.

"Nathan, I've selected your wedding suit too. Can you make time to meet with the designer today? I can handle other arrangements myself, but you need to be present for the fitting." Victoria's voice took on a wounded tone. "The internationally renowned designer is only in Crestview temporarily. If we miss this opportunity, we'll have to wait months."

Nathan blinked, a pang of guilt surfacing. "Sorry for being... distracted. Work has kept me too busy to focus on wedding plans."

Victoria's voice sweetened immediately. "It's alright, darling. I'm happy to take care of these things for you."

"I'll pick you up this afternoon."

"I'll be waiting, Nathan."

As soon as he ended the call, Oliver Sinclair hurried in with a document, placing it before him urgently.

"Mr. Blackwood, our PR department has made contact with Isabella Wang's representatives regarding her luxury wedding plans. Here's their proposal for hosting it at Blackwood Hotel. Please review it."

Nathan nodded, flipping through the pages with a serious expression.

The recent scandal involving Cassandra Blackwood had damaged the hotel's reputation significantly. Meanwhile, Monarch Grand Hotels had seen their popularity skyrocket, becoming an overnight sensation in hospitality circles.

Though Nathan had refused to help restore Cassandra's public image, as CEO of Blackwood Industries, he couldn't ignore the business repercussions.

"Let me study this proposal more carefully and arrange a meeting with senior hotel management. Securing this event is crucial for us." Nathan closed the file, his expression grim.

Oliver hesitated before adding, "Sir... there's something else you should know to prepare yourself."

"Out with it."

"We'll be competing against Monarch Grand Hotels' general manager - Evelyn Kingsley - for Isabella Wang's wedding."

At the mention of that name, Nathan's handsome face darkened, his eyebrows twitching in irritation.

Why did it always have to be that impossible woman?
###Chapter 147

"Is that accurate?" Nathan Blackwood's expression turned severe as he leaned forward in his chair.

Oliver Sinclair swallowed hard before responding. "Mr. Blackwood, I spoke with Isabella Laurent's agent yesterday. She mentioned that Evelyn Carter from Monarch Grand Hotels had already reached out before us."

His voice grew quieter as Nathan's face darkened with each word.

"What else did the agent say?" Nathan's tone was dangerously calm.

Oliver hesitated. "She acknowledged our hotel's reputation, but Monarch Grand has been gaining traction recently. Isabella Laurent wants both parties to submit proposals—she'll choose whichever offer is more favorable."

Nathan's fist struck the desk with a sharp thud. His pulse roared in his ears.

Evelyn Carter was already a thorn in his side. Now she had the audacity to compete with him for this deal. These women were determined to be his downfall.

"Call an emergency meeting with senior management first thing tomorrow," Nathan commanded. "We need an unbeatable proposal—fast. If this contract goes to Evelyn Carter, consider everyone involved in this project unemployed."

Oliver nodded frantically, his neck bobbing like a nervous pigeon.

Clearly, Nathan hadn't forgotten how Evelyn had forced him to climb ten flights of stairs to her office that day. This was personal.

Later that afternoon, Nathan's Maybach rolled to a stop outside an elegant six-story European mansion in Crestview's affluent North District.

"You said we were meeting the designer," Nathan remarked, eyeing the rose-adorned wrought-iron gate skeptically.

Victoria Sterling beamed. "We are. This is the private atelier of Rosalind Walker—the legendary couturier behind Rosalind Couture."

Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Though Rosalind's ready-to-wear line sold worldwide, Victoria insisted only custom pieces would suffice for their wedding.

Victoria had transformed herself for the occasion—her dark hair now a honeyed blonde, styled in loose waves. Her crimson backless dress clung to her curves, and her lips matched the bold shade perfectly.

The vibrant red made Nathan's mind flicker to Evelyn. No one wore that color like she did. On anyone else, it looked like a cheap imitation.

"It's just fabric," Nathan muttered, unimpressed. "Have her design your dress. I don't need a custom suit."

Victoria pouted, pressing against him. "I want us to match. From now on, I'll choose all your clothes—no more gifts from other women, understood?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. He remembered the suit Evelyn had tailored for him—how he'd painstakingly tried to restore it after it was ruined. And how she'd watched indifferently as others discarded it like trash.

"Fine," he ground out. "I won't."

At the gate, security stopped them. "Private event today. Invitation only."

Victoria produced two rose-embossed cards with a haughty smirk. "Obviously."

Inside, champagne flutes clinked amidst well-dressed guests. Nathan stiffened—Victoria had sprung this social gathering on him without warning. No wonder she'd dressed to impress.

He hated being used as her accessory.

The moment they entered, whispers erupted.

"Is that Nathan Blackwood?"

"Even more striking in person! Cameras don't do him justice."

"Who's the woman with him? She's stunning."

"Don't you know? That's Victoria Sterling—his fiancée. He divorced his wife for her. Quite the upgrade, wouldn't you say?"

Victoria preened under the attention. Let them gossip. Every envious glance only proved she'd won the ultimate prize.
###Chapter 148

Victoria Sterling had pleaded with Penelope Whitmore for days to secure these coveted invitations. At first, the thought of groveling had chafed at her pride, but now, standing beside Nathan Blackwood, she felt nothing but triumph.

"Why the secrecy? You know I despise these social gatherings." Nathan's jaw tightened, his expression glacial.

"Darling, my connections aren't prestigious enough to commission Ms. Walker for my wedding gown." Victoria's fingers fluttered nervously against his sleeve. "That's why I needed you here. Rosalind would never refuse a direct request from you."

Noticing his darkening mood, she added in a small voice, "Have I... inconvenienced you?"

"Next time, inform me beforehand." Nathan's tone softened marginally. "I'll dispatch someone to handle it. No need for personal appearances."

"Of course—"

Nathan's attention snapped toward the entrance at the sound of familiar footsteps—crisp, assured, resonating with quiet authority.

His body tensed as he turned.

Bathed in golden afternoon light, Evelyn Carter made her entrance in a tailored capri blue ensemble, the structured blazer accentuating her slender frame. A whisper of jasmine trailed in her wake as she stepped into Nathan's line of sight.

Today, her raven hair was swept into an elegant chignon, exposing the graceful column of her neck. Though she'd forgone her signature crimson lips, her natural magnetism still commanded the room.

Some women needed neither cosmetics nor crowns to radiate power.

Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palms.

She'd chosen scarlet specifically to dominate the event, yet Evelyn's understated blue effortlessly stole the spotlight.

Nathan's throat moved as he struggled to look away.

In one fluid motion, Evelyn passed him without acknowledgment, as though he were part of the furniture.

His eyes narrowed to slits, fury simmering beneath his carefully controlled exterior.

"My, my, Ms. Carter." Victoria's saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes. "What Herculean effort it must have taken for you to secure an invitation."

Evelyn's answering smile was all sharp edges. "Indeed. Every guest here shares either a professional or personal bond with Rosalind or her label. We're all either industry leaders, design collaborators, or elite clients." Her gaze swept over Victoria like a blade. "Which category do you occupy, Ms. Sterling?"

Victoria flushed as if struck.

The surrounding guests exchanged pointed glances, their disdain for the couple palpable.

"Neither you nor Mr. Blackwood qualify under any criteria," Evelyn continued sweetly. "Quite the mystery how you gained entry."

"How dare—!"

"Everyone knows Nathan's influence!" Victoria stepped forward, voice rising. "Ms. Walker would never bar the CEO of Blackwood Industries!"

"Ah, of course." Evelyn inclined her head. "Privilege does have its perks."

"You—! What credentials do you possess to be here?" Victoria's laugh was brittle. "Some backwater nurse who got lucky? You don't belong in this world!"

Nathan's hand clamped on Victoria's wrist. "Enough."

All eyes remained fixed on Evelyn, who stood unruffled. The crowd murmured—no country nurse carried herself with such poise or gained access to such exclusive events.

"Nathan, she started it!" Victoria pouted, smug at having exposed Evelyn's humble origins. "I merely stated facts."

"Ms. Walker's arrival!"

The announcement sliced through the tension.

A statuesque woman in rose-hued couture appeared atop the spiral staircase. With her sleek bob and imperious bearing, Rosalind Walker descended with regal detachment—until her gaze landed on Evelyn.

Her entire demeanor transformed.

Rushing forward, the renowned designer clasped Evelyn's hands with unexpected warmth. "Maestro! You should have told me you were coming!"
###Chapter 149

Master?!

Gasps echoed through the room. Victoria Sterling's jaw dropped so wide she nearly choked on her own saliva.

This couldn't be real. Evelyn Carter was only twenty-seven, for heaven's sake! Rosalind Walker was four years older than Victoria and had dominated the fashion world for a decade - Paris Fashion Week regular, international award winner. Meanwhile, Evelyn was just some small-town nobody. How in the world could she be Rosalind's master? This had to be a sick joke!

"Master? You make me sound ancient," Evelyn huffed, crossing her arms with an exaggerated pout. "A lady's age is a state of mind - and mine stopped at eighteen!"

Rosalind clung to Evelyn's waist like a koala. "I only say it because you're everything to me! Why didn't you warn me you were coming? I look like a complete mess!"

Evelyn flicked Rosalind's forehead. "Wasn't planning to come until my afternoon meeting got canceled. Consider yourself lucky I bothered to show up at all."

"Oh, so I'm just your backup plan now? I see how little I mean to you!" Rosalind fake-sobbed into Evelyn's shoulder.

"Cheeky brat! Since when did you learn to talk back to your master?" Evelyn pinched Rosalind's cheeks, their playful banter making the audience's heads spin.

Nathan Blackwood felt the oxygen leave his lungs.

That custom suit Evelyn had tailored for him suddenly made perfect sense. No wonder the craftsmanship had impressed even his veteran tailor. His ex-wife wasn't just skilled with a needle - she was a damn design virtuoso.

He'd severely underestimated her. Again.

To think Evelyn had been the mentor of an internationally acclaimed designer this whole time. This was an honor few in the country could claim.

A bitter taste flooded Nathan's mouth. Three years of marriage, and Evelyn had hidden this entire identity from him. What else had she kept secret? Had their life together meant nothing to her?

"Ms. Walker!" Victoria stepped forward with outstretched hand, flashing her most dazzling pageant smile. "I'm Nathan Blackwood's fiancée, Victoria Sterl-"

Rosalind recoiled as if avoiding radioactive waste, dragging Evelyn back with her. "I certainly didn't invite any 'Victoria Sterling' to my private reception. Wherever you got that invitation, it wasn't from me. Security!"

Victoria turned ghostly pale, fingers clutching Nathan's sleeve like a lifeline.

"Ms. Walker," Nathan interjected smoothly, bowing his head slightly. "Our apologies for the intrusion. My fiancée admires your work tremendously. We meant no disrespect - merely sought the opportunity to appreciate your genius in person."

Evelyn's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Nathan Blackwood - the man who'd never bowed to anyone - was groveling to stay at some fashion event. For Victoria.

How ironic. The only person who could make the mighty Nathan Blackwood humble himself was his precious Victoria. Evelyn had once foolishly believed she could earn that devotion through love and loyalty.

Victoria clung to Nathan's arm, the picture of innocence while internally gloating.

"Mr. Blackwood," Rosalind arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "The fashion world rarely sees titans like you at our little gatherings. But since you've asked so nicely..." She waved a dismissive hand. "Stay if you must."
###Chapter 150

What on earth?!

Evelyn kept shooting daggers at Rosalind Walker, but the renowned designer remained oblivious to her glare. Rosalind's attention was entirely consumed by Nathan Blackwood, staring at him like he was some exquisite piece of art.

Evelyn thought irritably, That girl! She'll strain her eyes gawking at such a despicable man!

"Thank you."

Nathan exhaled quietly in relief. However, Rosalind added sharply, "You may stay, but Ms. Sterling must leave immediately."

Victoria Sterling froze in shock. "Why should I leave?" she spat indignantly. "I'm Mr. Blackwood's fiancée!"

Her shrill voice drew disgusted glances from nearby guests.

Rosalind tsked, shaking her head. "I'd never have guessed that in a million years if you hadn't announced it. You!"

Victoria's face flushed crimson with rage.

"The only reason I'm not ejecting Mr. Blackwood is because his appearance meets my standards for distinguished guests."

Rosalind's critical gaze swept over Victoria's outfit. "Ms. Sterling, your fashion sense offends me. Your taste is clearly incompatible with this event. Kindly remove yourself."

Evelyn massaged her temples in exasperation.

She recalled how her former apprentice had always been shamelessly obsessed with handsome men.

At least she's keeping Nathan here... I should be grateful for that.

"Ms. Walker," Nathan's voice turned dangerously low, "we meant no disrespect by attending your private reception. But you're being unnecessarily harsh."

"Am I?" Rosalind's cheerful demeanor vanished. "Your fiancée publicly humiliated my mentor moments ago. I'm showing remarkable restraint by not having security physically remove her."

A tense silence fell over the gathering.

Evelyn stared at Rosalind in surprise. So she had witnessed the earlier confrontation.

An unexpected warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest.

"I... I..." Victoria stammered, cold sweat beading on her forehead as she clung desperately to Nathan.

Her earlier arrogance had spectacularly backfired.

Nathan's chiseled features hardened into stone.

"Rosalind, let it go."

Concerned about disrupting the event, Evelyn decided to play peacemaker. Rosalind had already made her point. Now was the time to appear magnanimous.

"Since they're already here," Evelyn murmured, "consider them your guests. There's no need for further drama. I wasn't offended by Ms. Sterling's remarks. Everything she said was true—I am indeed nobody special. This matter isn't worth pursuing."

Her words sparked immediate sympathy among the attendees.

"Look how gracious this young woman is!"

"Exactly! Many legendary designers came from humble beginnings. Ms. Sterling's behavior is utterly tasteless!"

"Honestly, how could someone so petty be engaged to Mr. Blackwood? She behaves like some vulgar mistress."

"Mr. Blackwood's choice in women is truly questionable..."

Victoria trembled with humiliation, wishing the floor would swallow her whole.

Though desperate to flee, she noticed Nathan showed no intention of leaving.

His jaw clenched tight, fists balled at his sides.

He would endure any humiliation to stay.

Because he needed to uncover Evelyn's true intentions.
###Chapter 151

Evelyn greeted a few guests before leading Rosalind to her private studio.

Their bond was as close as sisters. Without prying eyes around, they chatted freely, laughter filling the air.

Rosalind brought out her finest tea—a rare blend more precious than gold—served in delicate porcelain cups. Alongside it, she presented pastries crafted by the country's top pastry chefs, treats the guests downstairs wouldn’t even glimpse.

"Master, try this!"

Evelyn took a slow sip, savoring the rich, floral notes. "Exquisite. The aroma lingers beautifully."

Her poise was effortless, every movement radiating an elegance that couldn’t be taught.

Rosalind beamed. "I knew you'd love it!"

Normally reserved and distant, Rosalind transformed in Evelyn’s presence—bright-eyed, almost giddy.

Their friendship spanned six years.

Rosalind had been a prodigy in fashion design, her talent undeniable. But her rapid rise made her a target.

A reality show meant to showcase her skills turned into a nightmare. A famous actress humiliated her on air, while influential judges tore her work apart.

Then, Sharon—the legendary designer—spoke up.

She exposed the show’s manipulations, rallying others who’d suffered under those same critics. Overnight, Rosalind’s name was cleared, her brilliance undeniable.

"The more extraordinary you are, the more they’ll try to break you," Sharon had written. "But you, Ms. Walker, have a gift that leaves me in awe. Don’t stop."

Those words had been Rosalind’s lifeline.

Later, the judges issued hollow apologies. The actress? Her scandals erupted like fireworks, and within a year, she vanished from the industry.

"Master," Rosalind poured more tea, curiosity gleaming. "Why won’t you reveal you’re Sharon?"

Evelyn sighed playfully. "How many times must I answer this?"

"I just love pulling strings behind the scenes. The spotlight? Too noisy. I prefer my peace."

Rosalind huffed. "It’s such a waste! If that woman knew who you really were, she’d choke on her own arrogance."

Her teeth clenched. "How dare she sneer at you just because she’s Nathan Blackwood’s fiancée?"

Evelyn smirked. "She’s irrelevant."

A sip of tea. A moment of calm. That woman wasn’t worthy of knowing Sharon’s identity.

"But why argue with her at all?" Rosalind leaned in. "Do you have history? Need me to handle her?"

Evelyn’s fingers stilled. "No need. She’s Blackwood’s future wife."

"So what?" Rosalind grinned, sharp and sweet. "I’m your guard dog. I’ll bite anyone who messes with you."

The words tugged at Evelyn’s conscience.

Rosalind didn’t know everything—not her real name, not her past as Nathan’s ex-wife.

Sometimes, Evelyn felt like she lived multiple lives, each identity a separate world.

It was… complicated.

"Master," Rosalind held up a heart-shaped pastry, eyes hopeful. "Does your promise still stand?"

"Of course. But if my dance partner isn’t flawless, I’m walking out."

Rosalind’s grin turned wicked. "Oh, he’s perfect. Tall, sculpted, moves like a dream. You’ll devour him."

Meanwhile, downstairs, the gala buzzed.

Nathan stood like a statue, his tailored suit accentuating his powerful frame. Every woman in the room stole glances.

Victoria clung to his arm, glaring at anyone who dared look too long.

She’d only dragged him here for Rosalind’s designs. Otherwise? Never. This place was a den of vultures.

Nathan ignored them all. His gaze swept the crowd, searching—

Then, a murmur.

"Ah! It’s Rosalind!"
###Chapter 152

Victoria Sterling's grip tightened on Nathan Blackwood's sleeve as Rosalind Walker reappeared across the ballroom. "Nathan, let's approach her," she whispered urgently. "As CEO of Blackwood Industries, your influence could persuade her to design my wedding gown."

Nathan's brow furrowed as Victoria dragged him forward.

"Ms. Walker," Victoria began with saccharine sweetness, pressing closer to Nathan. "We'd be honored if you'd design my wedding dress. Our nationwide televised ceremony next month would provide incredible exposure for your brand." Her smirk grew smug. "Name your price - we'll meet any demand to show our sincerity."

"Money's no object?" Rosalind arched an eyebrow, her crimson lips curling. "How generous of you, Ms. Sterling, now that you're marrying into the Blackwood fortune." She extended one perfectly manicured finger. "One hundred million. Then I'll consider it."

Victoria gasped. "That's outrageous!"

"Really?" Rosalind's laugh was glacial. "The future Mrs. Blackwood intimidated by a mere hundred million?"

"Done." Nathan's voice cut through the tension like steel.

"Nathan!" Victoria's eyes shimmered with performative gratitude.

"His agreement means nothing." Rosalind's smile vanished. "My mentor may have forgiven you, but I haven't. You'll never wear a Rosalind Couture creation - not your wedding dress, not even a borrowed gown." With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she turned away.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as she seethed internally. "Nathan," she whimpered, "Do you think Evelyn poisoned her against us? How cruel to manipulate an outsider into attacking me!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I'll speak with Evelyn after the gala. She'll make Rosalind reconsider."

"You're too good to me," Victoria cooed, tilting her face upward.

The moment her lips neared Nathan's, the ballroom erupted in applause. Lights dimmed as a single spotlight illuminated the runway. The sensual strains of a tango filled the air as a muscular dancer in black emerged.

Nathan's breath caught.

Evelyn Carter materialized from the shadows in a scandalous crimson gown that clung to every curve. The transformation from earlier was staggering - where she'd been elegant, now she radiated dangerous allure.

"My God! Is that the same woman?"
"That dress should be illegal!"
"Look at their chemistry - it's art, not provocation!"

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his champagne flute. Since when could Evelyn dance? The woman who'd tripped over their wedding waltz now moved with predatory grace. And that dress - had she no shame, parading herself like this?

His gaze burned trails over the sinful slit revealing endless legs, the neckline that barely contained her. When the dancer's hand slid possessively around Evelyn's waist, something primal snarled in Nathan's chest.

Tango was seduction set to music.

Evelyn arched backward over her partner's arm, her smoldering gaze accidentally locking with Nathan's. For a heartbeat, the ballroom vanished. His pulse hammered against his collar as she deliberately dragged a fingertip down the dancer's chest.

Nathan's vision tunneled. He'd never touched her with such intimacy during their marriage. Now every man in attendance saw what should have been his alone. The glass shattered in his grip.
###Chapter 153

The dance ended with Evelyn and her partner clasping hands, taking a graceful bow.

Though it wasn’t a formal stage, their mesmerizing performance transformed the intimate cocktail party into an elegant ballroom affair.

Victoria’s fingers dug into her clutch as she overheard the murmurs of admiration.

Once, she had been the prodigy—piano, singing, dancing, accolades effortlessly won. But years abroad, lost in frivolous pursuits, had dulled her talents to mere memories.

"Nathan, don’t you think Ms. Carter is… impressive?" Victoria forced a brittle smile. "Though dancing like that in public is rather indecent, don’t you think? That dress barely covers anything. I’d be mortified—"

She turned, only to find Nathan gone.

He strode down the dimly lit backstage corridor, jaw clenched.

No matter how hard he fought it, the image of Evelyn’s sinuous movements haunted him, heat coiling low in his gut.

He told himself it wasn’t desire. It was fury—fury at her defiance, her deception, the way she played him for a fool.

Then, a voice slithered from the shadows.

"That woman I danced with—damn, her waist is tiny. Never felt a body like that before. So damn hot—"

The crude praise should’ve meant nothing. But Nathan saw red.

The dancer barely had time to turn before Nathan’s fist collided with his face.

A sickening crack echoed.

The man crumpled, groaning. "What the hell—?!"

Nathan loomed over him, voice glacial. "You dare lay hands on her?"

The dancer’s eyes widened in terror. "M-Mr. Blackwood?! But you’re engaged to Ms. Sterling! I didn’t know she was yours too—"

At the mention of Victoria, Nathan’s knuckles whitened.

"Nathan!"

He turned. Evelyn and Rosalind stood frozen, shock etched across their faces.

The dancer crawled toward them, blood dripping from his split lip. "Mr. Blackwood attacked me for no reason!"

Rosalind’s glare could’ve melted steel. "Is this how you behave at my event? Unprovoked violence?"

"He insulted her." Nathan’s voice was lethally quiet. "Consider this a lesson in keeping his mouth shut."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The Nathan she knew was ice—controlled, untouchable. Never one to brawl with inferiors. What had gotten into him?

Rosalind rounded on the dancer. "Explain. Now."

"I—I didn’t mean to offend Ms. Carter!" he stammered. "I was just bragging to my friends about dancing with her. I didn’t expect Mr. Blackwood to—"

"Enough." Evelyn cut in coolly. "Rosalind, get him to a doctor."

Her protégé hesitated. "I can’t leave you alone with him! He’s unhinged—attacking people over nothing!"

Evelyn’s lips thinned. "I’ll handle it. He won’t dare touch me."

Their whispers carried. Nathan’s expression darkened.

With a final worried glance, Rosalind helped the limping dancer away.

Silence thickened the air.

Nathan’s gaze raked over Evelyn’s scandalous dress, the dancer’s words echoing in his skull.

He shrugged off his jacket, thrusting it at her. "Put this on."

Evelyn recoiled as if burned. With a sharp flick of her wrist, she sent the garment tumbling to the floor.

"What is wrong with you? First, you assault a man, now you expect me to wear your clothes?" Her laugh was razor-sharp. "Disgusting."

Nathan’s pupils constricted. "Evelyn."

"I know your type—sweet, docile girls like Victoria." Her voice dripped venom. "For three years, I played that role. No more. We’re divorced. What I wear, who I dance with—none of your concern. Especially when you’re engaged!"

His hands fisted. "So this is your rebellion? Debasing yourself to spite me?"

"Debasing?" She arched a brow. "Tell me, Nathan—do you want me?"

His breath stuttered.

Evelyn stepped closer, tilting her face up. "If not, why the possessive act? Or is it that no one else can touch what you never wanted?"

"You think I’m possessive?" he growled.

"Pathetically so." Her smile vanished. "Next time, use your brain before leaving the house. Go back to your fiancée. Chasing your ex-wife only makes you look pathetic."

She turned, the red silk of her dress swirling like liquid fire.

Nathan seized her wrist, fingers biting into her skin. "Vent your anger at me directly. Using others to hurt us? That’s low."

Evelyn froze. "Using who?"

"Victoria came to Rosalind for a dress design and was humiliated. Don’t pretend you didn’t orchestrate this!"

Her eyes flashed. "You think I care enough about her to scheme?"

Nathan’s grip tightened. "Admit it. This was your revenge."

Evelyn wrenched free, rubbing her bruised wrist. "You’re delusional. But then, you always did see what you wanted to see."

With that, she walked away, leaving him standing alone in the shadows.
###Chapter 154

Nathan froze the moment the words left his lips.

He had no proof, yet his mind immediately jumped to Evelyn.

A twisted part of him wished she had orchestrated this - it would mean she still cared.

"You're delusional, Nathan."

Evelyn's chest tightened painfully, but she forced a bitter smile. "Honestly? Revenge never crossed my mind. Marry Victoria, marry four women like Harrison Kingsley did - I couldn't care less." Her voice turned icy. "Hating you would be a waste of my precious energy."

Nathan felt like he'd been gut-punched. "Evelyn—"

"Rosalind Couture has bookings through next year. She treats every client equally - even the Prime Minister's wife waits in line." Evelyn's lips curled in mockery. "Maybe she wanted to vent for me, but I don't need friends fighting my battles. If I wanted to slap Victoria, I'd do it myself. No need for roundabout schemes." She gave a hollow laugh. "You never understood me."

Her eyes were terrifyingly empty - like extinguished stars.

Nathan's heart twisted painfully.

"Evelyn!"

Sebastian's voice shattered the tension.

Evelyn seized the chance to shake off Nathan's grip, practically sprinting toward her brother.

Sebastian enveloped her in a protective embrace. "Sorry I'm late, little star. Work held me up."

"It's fine." Evelyn's voice trembled slightly, eyes stinging.

"Did he upset you?" Sebastian shot a lethal glare at Nathan, who stood frozen like a statue.

Evelyn shook her head. "Let's go home."

As they walked away, Nathan finally snapped out of his daze, chasing after them.

Outside, Theodore waited by the Rolls-Royce.

"Ugh, these heels are murder." Evelyn pouted at Sebastian. "Nothing beats sneakers."

"Theodore, the shoes."

The secretary immediately produced pristine white sneakers, placing them beside Evelyn's aching feet.

Nathan arrived just in time to witness Sebastian kneel, carefully removing her heels and sliding on the sneakers, tying the laces with meticulous care.

The CEO of Monarch Group - a man who commanded boardrooms with a glance - was kneeling to tend to his sister like she was made of glass.

Evelyn reached into Theodore's pocket, retrieving a chocolate with a playful grin, her face lighting up as she took a bite.

"Home."

The luxury car purred to life, carrying them away.

Nathan felt like his chest had been carved out.

His ex-wife - who'd lived like a ghost during their marriage - was now treated like royalty by one of the most powerful men in the country.

Sebastian Kingsley, who bowed to no one, willingly bent the knee for love. The devotion in his eyes was blinding.

True love isn't about making your lover bend to put on your shoes.

Nathan didn't understand why seeing Evelyn cherished by another man made him feel like he was drowning.

That evening, Victoria followed Nathan back to Cliffside Manor under the pretense of visiting Penelope and Leonard.

"Nathan, where did you disappear to earlier?" Victoria clung to his arm in the backseat. "I was terrified being left alone."

"Victoria." Nathan extracted his arm, voice frosty. "Don't provoke Evelyn again. Especially when she's shown you no hostility."

"You think I'm bullying her?" Victoria's eyes welled up instantly. "Is that what you believe?"

"Didn't you?"
###Chapter 155

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Cliffside Manor as Evelyn Carter stood by the window, her fingers tracing the edge of the velvet curtain. She had always been the kind of woman who wouldn’t stir trouble unless provoked—but today, she had held her tongue.

Nathan Blackwood’s icy gaze settled on Victoria Sterling’s ashen face. His voice was low, controlled, but beneath it simmered something darker. "No matter how much you resent her," he said, each word deliberate, "Evelyn and I are already divorced. After Grandfather’s birthday, once the papers are finalized, we’ll have nothing to do with each other. That’s the end of it."

His next words were sharp, cutting through the tension like a blade. "And I expect you to stop harassing her. That’s my only request."

Nathan didn’t speak to Victoria again until the Maybach rolled through the wrought-iron gates of Cliffside Manor.

Evelyn endured the silence, her jaw clenched. She could feel the weight of Nathan’s indifference pressing down on her, but she refused to let it show. Instead, she silently cursed Victoria Sterling under her breath.

"I’m going upstairs to change," Nathan muttered, his expression stormy as he strode away.

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms. She refused to believe she had done anything wrong.

Evelyn stole my marriage. She had Nathan for three years. Three whole years! The thought burned through her like acid. Even if I tore that woman apart, it wouldn’t be enough. So what if I made her life miserable? Why is Nathan defending her now?

Half an hour later, Nathan descended the stairs in dark loungewear, Agnes Thornton trailing behind him.

From the living room, laughter spilled out—bright, mocking, cruel.

Cassandra Blackwood’s voice carried clearly. "We really need to hire a new chef. The food’s been awful since Evelyn left."

Penelope Whitmore chuckled. "That country girl could cook, I’ll give her that. At least she was good for something."

Victoria’s voice was honeyed with false innocence. "Did Evelyn really cook for all of you every day?"

"Of course!" Cassandra scoffed. "What else was she fit for? She should’ve been grateful just to marry into this family. The staff used to joke that she wasn’t the lady of the house—just a glorified maid. A high-end nanny with a fancy title!"

Nathan’s hands curled into fists.

Penelope added with a smirk, "Honestly, I thought she’d give up and file for divorce within a year. With Nathan ignoring her and the whole family making her life hell? I wouldn’t have lasted a week."

Cassandra sneered. "Thank God you came back, Victoria. Otherwise, that gold-digger might’ve clung to us forever."

Nathan’s voice cracked through the room like a whip. "Enough."

Silence.

The air turned frigid.

Victoria shot to her feet. "Nathan, we—"

"You took everything Evelyn gave," he cut in, his voice dangerously quiet, "and then you mocked her for it."

The three women froze.

For three years, Nathan had never defended Evelyn. He had let them treat her like dirt.

Now, suddenly, he was protecting her?

His next words were a warning. "Even if Evelyn and I are divorced, she was still my wife. And I won’t tolerate anyone insulting her—especially in my home."

His glare swept over them. "As the wife and daughter of Blackwood Industries’ chairman, I suggest you both learn some class. You’re embarrassing yourselves."

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed back upstairs.

The women stood there, faces burning with humiliation.

Penelope’s lips curled in fury. "See that, Victoria? The man you’re going to marry is still defending another woman right in front of you!"

Victoria’s chest tightened. She spun to follow Nathan, but Agnes stepped smoothly into her path.

"I’m sorry, Ms. Sterling," the housekeeper said coolly. "The young master isn’t in the mood for company. You’ll be dining alone tonight."
###Chapter 156

Nathan Blackwood slumped onto the leather sofa in his study, fingers pressing against his throbbing temples. His broad shoulders trembled slightly as he leaned forward, elbows digging into his knees. The pain was becoming unbearable.

The headache had started during the car ride home. Hearing Penelope, Cassandra, and Victoria's vicious remarks about Evelyn had intensified the pounding in his skull.

"Even with the title of Mrs. Blackwood, she's doing servant's work," they'd sneered. The memory made Nathan's jaw clench. Whether Evelyn was competent or not, no one had the right to speak about her that way.

"Master! Another migraine?" Agnes rushed to the medicine cabinet, her hands shaking as she retrieved the painkillers. She poured a glass of mineral water and handed it to him. "Here, take these."

The pills brought slight relief, easing the tension in his forehead. Nathan's rigid posture relaxed marginally.

"Sir, these medications aren't good long-term solutions," Agnes fretted. "I recall your headaches improved significantly when Madam Evelyn performed her acupuncture treatments. Perhaps we should ask her to return—"

"Agnes." Nathan's voice came out hoarse, his bloodshot eyes lifting to meet hers. "Did they... did they always speak about Evelyn this way? Is it true she cooked for the family all those years?"

The elderly housekeeper sighed. "Yes, Master. I told you repeatedly how hardworking the young madam was, but you dismissed it as an act." She shook her head. "But who could maintain such a pretense for three years? Even if it were an act, such dedication would deserve recognition!"

Nathan's pale lips pressed into a thin line.

"When Madam first arrived, her culinary skills were quite basic," Agnes continued. "She humbly sought my advice, asking me to teach her. I told her the household staff could handle everything - that as the lady of Cliffside Manor, she needn't lift a finger." A wistful smile touched her lips. "But she insisted. Said she wanted to care for her husband personally. Since she couldn't assist with your business affairs, she'd tend to your daily needs instead."

Nathan's chest constricted. "The coughing... why did she cough?"

"At first, the kitchen fumes made her cough violently. She had to wear a mask while cooking." Agnes's eyes grew misty. "Eventually she adapted. Every morning, she'd be in the kitchen before sunrise, preparing breakfast before I even woke."

Nathan felt like he'd been punched in the gut. Even the painkillers couldn't dull this new ache spreading through him.

Agnes's voice turned indignant. "I've had quite enough of Penelope and Cassandra's behavior! After all Madam Evelyn sacrificed for this family, to be treated with such ingratitude..." She shook her head fiercely. "Master, while I dearly wish for your reconciliation, part of me hopes Madam finds happiness elsewhere - with people who'll cherish her properly."

Words could inflict deeper wounds than blades.

Nathan's head snapped up as if struck, his brows knitting together tightly.

Several uneventful days passed.

Reginald Blackwood's birthday approached.

The impending finalization of her divorce left Evelyn with conflicting emotions.

Her marriage to Nathan had been a quiet, rushed affair - just a quick trip to city hall for paperwork. No ceremony, no celebration, not even a shared meal to mark the occasion.

Their marriage certificate contained their only joint photograph. In it, Evelyn beamed radiantly, leaning toward Nathan.

But the man beside her stood stiffly, his expression so cold he might as well have been photoshopped into the frame.

Back then, Evelyn had believed marriage would change things. That with enough effort, she could make Nathan love her.

Now she knew better.

Love was the one thing in this world that couldn't be earned through merit.

"Nathan," she thought, tracing the photograph with her finger, "it wasn't that I didn't try hard enough. We were simply worlds apart."

"Ms. Carter?" Theodore Winslow placed a thick folder on her desk. "The event team worked through three nights on this. The proposal for Isabella Wang's wedding."

Evelyn's eyes brightened as she flipped through the pages. Her fountain pen danced across the document, making swift corrections like a seasoned executive.

"This, this, and this won't work." She tapped the pages decisively. "Too dated. These concepts are five years old at least. And the color scheme - Isabella detests these bright tones. She prefers Mondrian palettes." She closed the folder with finality. "Have them revise it."

"Yes, ma'am." Theodore winced in sympathy for his colleagues.

"We'll prioritize Isabella's wedding after Grandfather Reginald's birthday." Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "This time, we must outperform Blackwood Industries in every aspect. Rally the team - I want everyone at their best."

"Understood. We won't lose to Nathan Blackwood!" Theodore clenched his fist.

Evelyn smirked. "I simply hate losing. This has nothing to do with Nathan. But since he wants competition, I'll show him exactly how outmatched he is."

Her phone buzzed abruptly. Sophia Kingsley's name flashed on the screen.

"Aunt Sophia? What's wrong?"

"Evelyn! I did it!"

Evelyn blinked. "Did... what?"
###Chapter 157

Sophia's voice bubbled with excitement through the phone. "Evelyn darling, I successfully smuggled that antique rosewood chair you've been eyeing from Harrison's collection!"

"Aunt Sophia, you're absolutely brilliant!" Evelyn clapped her hands in delight. "Next time we meet, I'm taking you to the most extravagant lunch in Fairhaven!"

Sophia chuckled warmly. "Oh pish posh, seeing your smile is reward enough! Though..." Her tone turned playful. "If Harrison discovers this little heist, promise you'll at least bury me in something designer?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes affectionately.

After an exhausting day, Theodore drove Evelyn back to Cliffside Manor.

Kicking off her Louboutins, Evelyn slipped into plush velvet slippers and stretched like a contented cat. "I desperately need that bubble bath now," she sighed, massaging her stiff shoulders.

"Allow me to prepare it for you." Theodore immediately began rolling up his crisp white sleeves.

Evelyn waved him off with a tired smile. "Just whip up something edible. I'm starving."

"What would Madame desire tonight?"

"Hmm..." She tapped her chin dramatically. "Extra spicy ramen with—"

"—enough chili oil to melt steel," Theodore finished dryly.

Evelyn pouted. "And a doner kebab, but alas..." She gestured dramatically at their secluded estate.

"Shower first?"

"Absolutely. If I don't wash off today's grime now, I'll collapse before tasting your culinary masterpiece."

As Evelyn disappeared upstairs, Theodore methodically straightened the living area before donning his apron.

The doorbell chimed just as he finished cooking.

Frowning, Theodore checked the monitor—Sebastian and Dominic had keys, and no one else knew this location.

His breath hitched.

Julian Montgomery's smirking face filled the screen. "Hellooo? Anyone home?" The man actually waved at the camera.

"Theodore Winslow speaking," he said icily. "Ms. Carter is unavailable."

Julian's grin widened. "Followed you from the Monarch Grand, naturally. Honestly Theo, for a Kingsley secretary, your situational awareness is—"

"—When?!" Theodore's grip tightened on the intercom.

"Since you left the hotel parking garage." Julian tsked. "I could've been a serial killer for all you knew."

"Ms. Carter is resting," Theodore ground out. "Kindly leave."

"Lights are on upstairs, my dude." Julian held up a velvet box. "I'm just delivering a gift from Serenia. Be a lamb and open up?"

"Theo, who's—"

Evelyn descended the staircase in a blush silk robe, damp curls piled atop her head. The scent of jasmine bath oils trailed behind her.

Theodore stiffened. "Ms. Carter, I was just—"

Evelyn peered at the screen, then arched a perfectly groomed brow. "Julian. What a... surprise."

"Evelyn!" Julian's entire demeanor brightened. "I brought you something special—a Lillian Archer crystal sculpture from Serenia. Had to pull major strings to acquire it."

"Mr. Montgomery," Evelyn said coolly, "I've declined your gifts repeatedly. The answer remains—"

"—It's from her limited Celestial Tear series." Julian's voice dropped conspiratorially. "The one that sold out in seven minutes last auction?"

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the gate release.

Theodore facepalmed internally. This bastard knew exactly which buttons to push.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn pressed the button. The gates swung open.

Theodore could only watch as Julian strolled in, victory gleaming in his hazel eyes. That damn sculpture box might as well have been a Trojan horse.
###Chapter 158

The door swung open.

Julian Montgomery practically leaped inside, as though terrified Evelyn might suddenly change her mind and slam it shut again.

"Phew," he exhaled dramatically, running a hand through his windswept hair. "Getting past your security is harder than securing a reservation at Pivotage. The entry fee is practically extortionate."

His teasing words trailed off as his gaze landed on Evelyn.

She stood bathed in golden lamplight, wrapped in a silk robe that draped effortlessly over her curves. The delicate fabric clung to her damp skin, tied loosely at her slender waist. The steam from her bath had left her cheeks flushed, her lips slightly parted.

Julian's throat went dry.

His Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

"Theodore," Evelyn said coolly, arching a brow. "Would you mind telling Mr. Montgomery where his eyes should be?"

Theodore Winslow crossed his arms, his expression icy. "Certainly. On the ceiling. Or the floor. Anywhere but where they're currently fixed."

Julian merely grinned, unrepentant. "Beauty is meant to be admired. I'm simply appreciating divine craftsmanship. Purely artistic appreciation, I assure you." His smirk widened.

Theodore rolled his eyes so hard Evelyn half-expected them to get stuck. "Ah yes. First time I've heard someone justify leering with such... eloquence."

Evelyn's attention shifted to the ornate box in Julian's hands. "Is this Lillian Archer's work?"

"Indeed." Julian's entire demeanor brightened. "I managed to acquire two pieces. One for Reginald's birthday, and this—" He extended the box toward her with reverence. "—exclusively for you."

His eyes sparkled with unrestrained enthusiasm. "Evelyn, Lillian only releases ten handcrafted pieces annually. Do you have any idea how impossible these are to obtain?"

Evelyn cleared her throat lightly. "Have you eaten? If not, you're welcome to join us."

"Starving!" Julian pressed a dramatic hand to his stomach. "I've been camped outside your suite since five. Not a single crumb has passed these lips." His voice dropped to a theatrical whisper. "I may perish."

Theodore muttered something unflattering under his breath.

"Teddy," Evelyn said sweetly, carefully accepting the box. "Would you prepare another bowl of ramen for our guest? Extra spicy, please."

Julian blanched. "Extra—?" His voice cracked. "You're joking."

Theodore smirked. "Problem, Montgomery? I thought you had an iron stomach. Or does the Prince of Crestview only dine on gold-leaf truffles?"

Julian squared his shoulders. "Nonsense. I'll eat it." He swallowed hard. "But perhaps... mild? Just a suggestion."

Evelyn turned, catching the way his usually confident expression had morphed into something almost pitiful. She laughed—a soft, melodic sound that made Julian's pulse stutter.

Her cheeks dimpled. "Fine. No spice."

Julian exhaled as if granted a last-minute pardon. Then, watching the way her eyes crinkled at the corners, something warm and unfamiliar flared in his chest.

He'd heard of love at first sight.

This was something far more dangerous.

While Theodore disappeared into the kitchen, Julian and Evelyn settled in the living room. Her slender fingers traced the contours of the crystal sculpture—a breathtaking fan, its delicate folds carved from a single flawless piece of white crystal. It shimmered as if alive under her touch.

"Stunning," she breathed.

Julian wasn't looking at the artwork.

Her hands—elegant, precise—were more mesmerizing than any masterpiece. The way her fingertips glided over the crystal, the faint concentration between her brows...

"Do you like it?" Julian asked softly, propping his chin on his palm.

"Like it?" Evelyn's eyes sparkled. "Lillian Archer is my favorite contemporary artist. This is..." She shook her head, at a loss for words.

"Me too," Julian murmured. What he didn't say: I like you more.

Evelyn suddenly turned serious. "Julian, this is too generous. I can't accept it without reciprocation." She met his gaze squarely. "Name your price. I'll pay whatever it cost."

Julian recoiled as if struck. "Absolutely not." He pressed a hand to his heart. "You wound me, Evelyn. Truly."

"I'm serious. I planned to visit Serenia this year to purchase one of her pieces myself. This saves me the trip, but I insist on compensating you."

"Not a chance."

"Then name a condition." Evelyn leaned forward slightly. "Within reason, I'll agree."

Julian's grin turned wolfish. He closed the distance between them in one smooth motion.

"Perfect." His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Reginald's birthday gala is next week. Accompany me?"
###Chapter 159

"No, think of another condition."

Evelyn's voice was firm as she crossed her arms.

"But you just promised me!" Julian's brows knitted together, his expression turning desperate.

"I really can't go with you."

Her gaze hardened as she met his eyes. "I made a vow to Grandfather Reginald that I'd celebrate his birthday as his granddaughter-in-law. After this, I won't have any ties to the Blackwood family anymore."

"If I show up with another man, it would only upset him. I just want his 80th birthday to be perfect. This might be the last time I see him."

A shadow of sorrow flickered in her striking eyes.

"Evelyn, you're too kind. Nathan is a fool for letting you go." Julian sighed dramatically.

But inwardly, he smirked. If my best friend weren't so blind, I'd never have found this hidden gem. Oh, Nathan… your loss is my greatest fortune!

"Then name another condition." Evelyn traced the delicate curves of the crystal sculpture, unable to hide her admiration.

"Then… stop calling me Mr. Montgomery. Just Julian, from now on." He fluttered his lashes playfully.

"That's it? You know I don't owe favors lightly."

"Having dinner with you is reward enough." His gaze lingered on her, warm and adoring.

"Fine. Julian it is."

His heart leapt. Progress! To him, hearing his name from her lips was as sweet as an endearment.

"Ms. Carter, your pasta is ready."

Theodore strode in, apron tied neatly around his waist. His tone was gentle toward Evelyn but sharp as he added, "I made his extra spicy."

May it burn his tongue off.

"Evelyn, don't you think it's odd living with a male assistant? I have a housekeeper—fifteen years of service. I could transfer her to you. Impeccable skills, divine cooking. I grew up on her meals." Julian shot Theodore a smug glance, like a newly favored concubine flaunting his rise.

Theodore's grip on his apron tightened. The audacity! He’s not even her boyfriend!

"Theo and I grew up together. He’s family."

Evelyn’s eyes darkened, her voice icy. "Mr. Montgomery, aren’t you overstepping?"

Theodore’s chest swelled with warmth. I knew she’d defend me!

Julian nearly choked on his own heartbreak.

She grew up with him? A childhood sweetheart?! How is Sebastian Kingsley so lenient, letting this man live under the same roof as his sister?!

"Go ahead to the table. I’ll take this upstairs."

Evelyn carefully packed the sculpture and floated up the steps, light as a butterfly.

Julian watched, mesmerized, and snapped a photo of her retreating figure. Even candid, she looked like art.

Then, a message flashed on his screen.

[Nathan: Bad mood. Drinks. Now.]

Grinning, Julian sent the photo.

Two seconds later, his phone rang.

"Hello?" Julian turned away, lowering his voice.

Nathan’s tone was lethal. "You’re with Evelyn now?"

"At her place, actually." He couldn’t resist gloating.

"Where does she live?!" Nathan snarled.

"You don’t know? Oh, I can’t tell you. She clearly doesn’t want you showing up uninvited."

"Julian." Nathan’s voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Where. Is. She?"

Julian muffled a laugh. "Not telling~"
###Chapter 160

Twenty minutes later, Nathan Blackwood's luxury car screeched to a halt outside Evelyn Carter's penthouse.

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel, staring at the glowing windows above. The thought of Julian Montgomery being alone with Evelyn at this hour made his blood boil.

Nathan's phone screen illuminated the dark interior of his car. The photo showed Evelyn draped in a scandalous satin robe that clung to every curve.

Before their divorce, she'd always worn those ridiculous oversized pajamas that could double as potato sacks. Now she was parading around like some high-class escort.

He loosened his tie with a sharp tug, suddenly finding the car's air conditioning inadequate.

Inside the penthouse, Julian Montgomery's face turned ashen as he watched Evelyn devour a bowl of nuclear-level spicy instant noodles.

Raised in the lap of luxury with a mother obsessed with organic everything, Julian had never tasted anything more processed than artisanal pasta. The concept of instant food was as foreign to him as poverty.

"Aren't you going to eat? It's getting cold," Evelyn said between slurps, completely oblivious to his distress.

"I'm... overwhelmed by your hospitality," Julian forced a smile while gripping his fork like a lifeline.

Evelyn shrugged. "It's just noodles. I've got a whole box if you want to take some home."

"No! I mean... that's very kind but—"

Julian steeled himself. This was just another trial in his quest to win Evelyn's heart. He took a massive bite.

The fire hit instantly.

Coughing violently, Julian's eyes watered as the spice seared his throat. Across the table, Theodore Winslow smirked behind his innocent expression.

"Can't handle spice? You should've said something." Evelyn pushed a glass of water toward him just as the doorbell chimed.

"Another visitor? I'll get it." Theodore moved to the security screen and froze when Nathan's furious face appeared.

"I need to speak with Evelyn."

"Who is it?" Evelyn called out, leading a still-sputtering Julian toward the entrance.

Both froze when they saw the video feed.

"What's he doing here? Did you tell him?" Evelyn whirled on Julian accusingly.

Julian raised his hands in surrender, tears still streaming from the spice. "He threatened me! Said he'd delay your divorce indefinitely if I didn't give him your address!"

Evelyn's fists clenched. "What else?"

"That he'd make sure neither Sebastian nor I could see you again." Julian rubbed his burning throat. "The man's a demon."

Evelyn stormed to the intercom, shoving Theodore behind her protectively. "You have no right to be here! Leave now or I'm calling security!"

"Evelyn, come outside." Nathan's voice crackled through the speaker, tight with barely restrained anger.

She laughed bitterly. "Since when do I take orders from you?"

"Julian! Get out here now!" Nathan roared, his usually composed voice raw with fury.

Julian paled. "Not a chance!" He knew exactly what Nathan was capable of in this state.

"Julian Montgomery!"

"Julian is my guest," Evelyn cut in coldly. "He brought me a gift, which I accepted. You, Mr. Blackwood, are trespassing. Kindly remove yourself from my property."

Nathan's response was cut off as Evelyn slammed her palm against the intercom's power button, silencing him mid-sentence.
###Chapter 161

The video call ended abruptly, plunging the screen into darkness. Yet Evelyn could still see Nathan's stormy gaze burning in her memory.

"What an absolute bastard!" Evelyn clenched her fists until her nails bit into her palms. "Using divorce papers as emotional blackmail? How low can he sink?"

Beside her, Julian shifted uncomfortably. His usually confident demeanor had crumbled. "Evelyn, I... I shouldn't have told him about our dinner."

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose. "This isn't about you, Julian. Nathan's just being his usual controlling self - he can't stand seeing me move on."

A flash of lightning illuminated the dining room, followed by thunder that rattled the windows. The approaching storm mirrored Evelyn's turbulent emotions.

"Let's finish our meal," Evelyn said through gritted teeth, turning away from the window where rain had begun pelting the glass.

Julian remained frozen by the door, realization dawning on his handsome features. "Christ... did I just betray my best friend?"

The downpour intensified as they relocated to the lounge area. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a dramatic view of the storm while they sipped Earl Grey.

"You know," Evelyn admitted, cradling her teacup, "I misjudged you at first. Beneath that playboy exterior, you're actually quite decent company."

Julian nearly choked on his tea. "Evelyn Carter thinks I'm decent? Should I get that engraved on my tombstone?"

"Don't push your luck," Evelyn warned, though the ghost of a smile touched her lips.

Seizing the moment, Julian leaned forward. "Hypothetically... if we'd met before Nathan, would you have given me a chance?"

"No." The answer came without hesitation.

Julian recoiled as if struck. "That's brutally honest. Why not?"

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the rain-streaked windows. "Even without Nathan in the picture, I wouldn't have loved anyone."

Thirteen years. That's how long Nathan Blackwood had occupied her heart - from their first meeting at university through their tumultuous marriage to this bitter divorce. She'd given him her brightest smiles, her fiercest passion, her youthful devotion. There was nothing left for anyone else.

Julian studied her profile - the way her long lashes cast shadows on cheeks that had lost their youthful roundness. At twenty-four, Evelyn carried the world-weariness of someone twice her age. "Nathan really did a number on you, didn't he?" he murmured.

"Theodore!" Evelyn's secretary appeared in the doorway. "You need to see this."

Evelyn followed Theodore to the east wing corridor. Through the rain-lashed windows, a figure stood motionless in the storm.

Nathan.

His designer suit clung to his frame, his usually impeccable hair plastered to his forehead. Lightning flashed, illuminating his stubborn stance beside his Aston Martin. He might as well have been carved from stone for all the notice he took of the tempest raging around him.

"Is he insane?" Theodore spat. "This is emotional manipulation at its finest!"

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "Let him stand there all night if he wants. It won't change anything."

Her phone vibrated with an incoming call. Nathan's voice, deeper than the thunder, came through clearly: "Come outside. We need to talk."

"I have nothing to say to you!"

A jagged bolt of lightning struck nearby, the accompanying thunderclap shaking the manor to its foundations. In that blinding flash, Evelyn caught Nathan's expression - raw, determined, and utterly desperate.
###Chapter 162

The storm raged with violent intensity.

Fierce winds howled through the trees as torrential rain pounded the earth. Jagged streaks of violet lightning split the sky.

Nathan Blackwood remained motionless beneath the swaying branches, his silhouette barely visible through the downpour.

To make matters worse, his phone kept ringing insistently. Was the man actively trying to get electrocuted?

"Nathan, I'm not coming out! Stop calling and go home!" Evelyn Carter's voice trembled with barely contained fury, her eyes burning crimson.

"I'm not leaving until I see you." Nathan's deep baritone cut through the storm, unwavering in its resolve.

That absolute madman!

Cursing under her breath, Evelyn stormed toward the staircase, ignoring Theodore Winslow's concerned calls.

Nathan tightened his grip on his phone, his brow furrowing as he maintained his vigil.

His piercing gaze remained fixed on Cliffside Manor's grand entrance, unblinking despite the stinging rain.

Then - movement.

The heavy oak doors swung open.

Nathan's dark eyes ignited with sudden intensity, his breathing growing ragged.

Evelyn emerged wearing only a thin jacket, struggling against the gale with a massive black umbrella.

Her raven hair whipped wildly about her face as the wind threatened to knock her off balance. She looked like a delicate flower about to be torn from its roots.

Yet her expression remained glacial, her posture radiating aristocratic defiance despite the tempest.

Something about those brilliant eyes - like twin stars blazing through the darkness - struck Nathan as hauntingly familiar.

Before he could process the thought, Evelyn was upon him, her beautiful face set in lines of cold fury.

As the cherished heiress of Monarch Group, daughter to Fairhaven's wealthiest magnate with four overprotective brothers, Evelyn Carter had always held the reins in every relationship. Yet here she stood, emotionally manipulated by this infuriating man.

"Nathan Blackwood, have you completely lost your mind? Are you actively trying to get struck by lightning?" Her voice dripped with venom, her fingers itching to claw out his throat.

A faint smirk touched Nathan's lips as he rasped, "Do you actually care what happens to me?"

"Care about you?" Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "Don't flatter yourself. I only came out to tell you to go die somewhere else. Don't you dare tarnish my doorstep with your corpse."

Her words were daggers aimed straight for his heart.

Paradoxically, Nathan found this fiery version of Evelyn far more captivating than the obedient puppet she'd once been.

Attraction often begins with intrigue.

"Let's continue this in the car." His gaze dropped to her rain-soaked blouse clinging to her curves.

"No." Evelyn's refusal was absolute. "Say what you came to say and leave. Now!"

"Get in the car." Nathan's stubbornness matched hers as he took a threatening step forward.

At that precise moment, a searing bolt of lightning struck the ancient oak beside them.

With an earsplitting crack, a massive branch came crashing down.

Deafened by the storm and blinded by rage, Evelyn remained oblivious to the danger.

"Nathan--!"

Her protest died as she found herself suddenly engulfed in his powerful embrace.

Nathan moved with preternatural speed, twisting his body to shield hers as the falling timber struck his back with a sickening thud.
###Chapter 163

Nathan Blackwood clenched his jaw, a low groan escaping his lips despite his efforts to suppress it.

Yet, his grip on Evelyn Carter remained firm, refusing to let go.

Evelyn's breath hitched, her pulse racing. "Nathan! Are you hurt?"

"I'm fine. Get in the car." His voice was strained, teeth gritted against the pain as he stubbornly held onto her wrist.

The rain poured relentlessly. Evelyn hesitated, but with no other choice, she followed him into the vehicle.

Inside the dimly lit car, the scent of damp fabric and Nathan's cologne filled the air.

He shrugged off his soaked suit jacket, tossing it onto the passenger seat. His dark hair clung to his forehead, half-obscuring his piercing gaze. Even drenched, he exuded an undeniable magnetism.

Evelyn's chest tightened. The memory of him shielding her from danger replayed in her mind, leaving an ache she couldn't ignore.

For three years of marriage, he had never held her like that.

And yet, in that moment, she had felt safe. Was this the same security Victoria Sterling basked in every day?

The thought made her scoff.

No matter how comforting his embrace was, it wasn’t hers to keep.

"Did Sebastian buy this villa for you?" Nathan’s voice cut through the silence, sharp and cold.

"You already know the answer."

Evelyn crossed her arms, staring out at the rain-streaked window. "A small-town girl like me could never afford a place like this. Of course, Mr. Kingsley was generous enough to gift it."

"If you had nowhere to stay, why refuse the property I offered?" Frustration edged his tone, his back throbbing but ignored.

"Why should I accept it?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Sebastian’s gifts come with no strings—just kindness. But yours? Did you think our marriage was some transaction? You’re quite skilled at humiliation, Nathan. I never took a cent from you during our marriage, and I won’t start now."

"Evelyn, I never meant to humiliate you. You’re twisting my words."

His jaw tightened, emotions flickering in his darkened gaze.

When he’d offered her the money, it had been practicality, not pity. He knew she had little saved, and Crestview was unforgiving without wealth.

But what else could he give her? He had nothing left but material things.

"Enough." She exhaled sharply. "If this is all you came to say, I’m done listening."

Her hand reached for the door handle.

Nathan moved faster, seizing her wrist and yanking her back.

"Ow!"

Evelyn gasped as she collided with his chest, pain flaring through her nose.

Damn it, is his chest made of steel?

"Sorry."

The word was rough, unfamiliar on his tongue.

Evelyn froze, her pulse stuttering. Slowly, she lifted her gaze, meeting his conflicted eyes. Her nose stung from the impact.

"What did you just say?"

Nathan swallowed hard, discomfort flashing across his face. Apologies weren’t in his nature.

"I’m apologizing for Victoria. What she said to you at the gala was unacceptable."

Her heart plummeted.

A cold laugh escaped her. "So you waited in the rain just to play the dutiful fiancé? How touching. Well, I don’t accept it. Consider your trip wasted."
###Chapter 164

Nathan's brows knitted together in frustration.

He had spent countless sleepless nights preparing himself to apologize to Evelyn. The weight of his guilt had kept him awake for seven straight days.

Originally, he planned to wait until his grandfather Reginald's birthday to speak with her in person. But seeing Julian at her residence tonight had shattered his patience. He needed to see her immediately.

This unfamiliar urgency confused him. Never in his life had he experienced such uncontrollable impulses.

Normally, his emotions were perfectly restrained. Yet lately, he'd realized Evelyn somehow held the key to his emotional control.

"Victoria should be the one apologizing to me personally. What right do you have to apologize on her behalf?" Evelyn's voice cut through the night air like ice. "Are you trying to flaunt your devotion to her?"

Her gaze was glacial. "If she commits murder, will you serve her prison sentence too?"

"Evelyn, I'm here to sincerely apologize!" Nathan's voice rose, his eyes burning red. "I think you're deliberately provoking me."

Evelyn laughed bitterly, her clear eyes glinting coldly under the moonlight. "Nathan, if you can't comprehend my words, don't bother apologizing. Your apologies mean nothing to me."

"Evelyn, why must you be so difficult?" Nathan's tone turned harsh.

"You're the one forcing this confrontation. I never asked for your presence here tonight." She struggled against his grip, her wrist aching. "Let go! I'm going inside."

"What more do you want from me? I've humbled myself to this extent—how much further must I debase myself to satisfy you?" Losing control, Nathan seized her shoulders and shook her violently.

"Nathan, I never wanted your humility."

Her heart whispered what she couldn't voice aloud: All I ever wanted was your love. But knowing that was impossible, I accepted reality and let go. Why must you keep reopening these wounds? Do you truly think so little of me?

A bitter laugh escaped her lips as her eyes reddened.

Those mesmerizing eyes burned with intensity, scorching Nathan's trembling heart.

"I want you gone from my life completely. Just leave. Goodbye."

When Evelyn pushed him away, Nathan grabbed her wrist again. "Gone? Impossible! We were married for three years. That divorce will forever be part of your records. You can't erase our past!"

"I can if I choose to." Her contemptuous gaze reduced him to insignificance. "You may see us as divorced, but I consider myself widowed."

Nathan staggered as if struck. A deafening buzz filled his ears, his head throbbing with pain.

Gasping for air, his hands shook violently as he hissed, "Evelyn, unless I release you, my name will always be tied to yours! If I refuse to finalize our divorce, you'll never be free to start anew!"

SMACK!

Evelyn's palm connected sharply with his cheek—the second time she'd struck him, yet the emotions behind this slap were entirely different.

Her heart ached as if pierced by his cruel words. "Nathan, had I known how despicable you could be, I would never have married you!"

She fled the car, slamming the door behind her without bothering with an umbrella as she raced through the rain toward Cliffside Manor.

Nathan stood stunned, his face turned from the impact.

After a long moment, his tall frame bent forward, hands clutching his throbbing head in utter wretchedness.

Upon returning home, Evelyn avoided Theodore and rushed to her room.

Reaching the upstairs hallway, she collapsed against the wall, left hand bracing herself while her right clutched her robe. She gasped for air as if surfacing from drowning, desperately fighting back tears.

"Evelyn?"

Julian's concerned voice came from behind. She clenched her jaw, swallowing her sobs.

"I'm exhausted and need rest. I won't see you out. Thank you for the gift."

"Evelyn, what's wrong?" Julian's voice trembled.

"I'm fine. Goodnight."

"Evelyn!"

In three long strides, Julian caught up, gripping her slender shoulders to turn her toward him.

The sudden motion left her dizzy. Her tear-filled eyes shone with irritation, making her even more breathtaking.

"You've been crying?" Julian stared in shock.

"No," Evelyn replied coldly, though her reddened eyes betrayed her.

"Did Nathan upset you? That stubborn fool isn't worth your tears, Evelyn. He never deserved you."
###Chapter 165

"It's pointless," Evelyn murmured under her breath, her voice barely audible.

Julian inhaled sharply. The devastation in her eyes shattered him completely.

"Evelyn, why don't you give me a chance?" he pleaded.

Her delicate brows knitted together.

"Try accepting me," Julian continued desperately. "I may not be perfect, but I'll become the man you deserve!"

At least he was better than that bastard Nathan, Julian thought bitterly.

"Julian, I'm exhausted. Please don't make this harder." The sorrow in Evelyn's gaze cut deeper than any blade.

"Evelyn—" His breath caught. Pity flooded his heart.

"It's late. I need to rest. You should leave."

She pushed past him, moving toward the bedroom with leaden steps.

"Are you and Sebastian really together?" Julian demanded. "What's between you two? Is this real, or just revenge against Nathan?"

Evelyn froze. Her fists clenched. "That's none of your concern."

"There's no sign of Sebastian living here. If he's your boyfriend, where are his shoes? His belongings? How can there be zero trace of him in your space?"

"I said it's none of your business. Stop worrying about things that don't involve you."

"Evelyn! Don't destroy yourself like this." Julian's voice cracked with desperation, bitterness coating his throat.

Without another word, Evelyn disappeared into the bedroom.

Meanwhile, Nathan drove back to Cliffside Manor in a daze. The normally forty-minute journey took him two hours.

A migraine blurred his vision while torrential rain obscured the road. He nearly crashed twice before reaching home.

Stumbling into the study, he knocked over teacups and documents searching for his medication. Finding the bottle at last, he dry-swallowed double the dosage.

The pain refused to subside.

"Nathan, if I'd known how vile you were, I never would've married you!"

Evelyn's furious words echoed in his skull. The towering man curled into himself as agony ripped through his skull, cold sweat dripping from his brow.

Agnes heard the commotion and rushed in.

"Young Master!" Her face paled at the sight. "Another migraine?"

"Nathan...Evelyn..." he mumbled incoherently.

"Hold on! I'll call the doctor immediately!"

As Agnes turned to leave, her phone rang.

An unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Agnes, it's me." A familiar gentle voice answered.

"Young Madam? Is that really you?" Agnes clapped a hand over her mouth.

"Yes, it's Evelyn."

"Oh thank heavens! You must help! The Young Master's migraine—he's completely delirious! He hasn't had attacks this bad since you left!"

"Listen carefully," Evelyn said calmly. "In my bedroom, there's a silver case in the nightstand drawer with acupuncture needles I used to treat Nathan. Beneath it is a notebook detailing the treatment. You studied acupuncture, yes?"

"Yes! I remember!"

"Nathan injured his back tonight—a tree branch fell on him. There's bruise ointment in that same drawer. Apply it tonight. If it worsens, take him to the hospital."

"Of course, Young Madam." Agnes wiped her tears, heart aching.

How could the Young Master let such a wonderful woman slip away?

"One last thing." Evelyn's voice softened. "Don't tell Nathan about this call."
###Chapter 166

The following afternoon, Nathan Blackwood finally stirred from his deep slumber.

That night, the same haunting dream had tormented him repeatedly.

In his dream, Nathan was deployed on a perilous mission in the war-torn lands of Eldermere. He and fifty fellow soldiers infiltrated the enemy stronghold, eliminating the terrorists and successfully freeing ten hostages.

The enemy was no ordinary foe—they were child soldiers, trained to kill since the age of five, armed with heavy artillery and ruthless instincts.

The desert sands were soaked crimson, transforming the battlefield into a living nightmare.

Nathan hadn’t been assigned to the mission initially. But he volunteered—joining what was known as the Suicide Squad.

"Young man, are you married?"

"No."

"No wife, no children. Why would you take this mission? The rest of us have families—someone to carry on if we fall."

Nathan had only smiled faintly in response. Death didn’t frighten him.

"I have no one depending on me. I have nothing to lose."

At that time, the two most important women in his life had abandoned him, one after another. His heart had turned to stone. Death meant nothing compared to the agony of solitude.

In the end, they fought like demons. Less than ten survived.

Nathan took bullets to his legs, shoulders, and waist. Just as he accepted his fate, a woman in a tattered white coat appeared—like an angel descending through the smoke and blood.

Her mask was thick, her short hair matted with dust. She looked like a battle-worn saint.

But her eyes—sharp, luminous—burned brighter than the sun.

She was his savior. The little dove he had spent years searching for.

Now, after meeting Evelyn Carter, the dream had returned.

Two entirely different women—yet, in Evelyn’s gaze, Nathan swore he saw the same light.

How was that possible?

Rubbing his temples, he realized his headache had vanished.

Agnes Thornton entered, carrying a medical kit.

"Master Nathan, you're awake!" she exclaimed, relief washing over her face. "How are you feeling?"

"Fine."

Nathan sat up with her assistance—then froze.

He was in pajamas.

"When did I change?"

"You don’t remember? You came back last night soaked to the bone. I had to change you myself."

Agnes clucked her tongue as she straightened the room. "Thirty years old and still acting like a reckless boy. What you need is a wife."

Nathan grimaced, dragging a hand through his hair.

The last thing he recalled was the blinding pain in his head. He’d gone to his study for medicine—then nothing.

"Agnes, you undressed me?"

"Who else would?"

Nathan groaned. "I’m thirty, not thirteen. Can you stop stripping me like a child?"

"Oh, please," Agnes scoffed. "As if I’d take advantage. I’ve seen your bare backside since you were in diapers."

Nathan had no retort.

"And whose fault is it that you kicked Young Madam out? Now you’ve got no one to fuss over you. When I’m gone, who’ll care if you sleep in wet clothes or run around naked?"

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose.

"Now, take off your shirt."

"Excuse me?" Nathan recoiled.

"The wound on your back needs tending! This ointment must be applied daily. Hurry up!" Agnes brandished the medicine Evelyn had left behind.

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "How did you know about my injury?"

"Well—"
###Chapter 167

Agnes Thornton recalled Evelyn Carter's instructions and quickly adjusted her tone. "I noticed it when I assisted you with your gown last evening! That enormous bruise frightened me terribly!"

Nathan Blackwood's mind flashed back to that electrifying moment when he'd cradled Evelyn against his chest. Her feverish breath had scorched his skin, her slender waist molding perfectly into his grasp like molten silk.

In that instant, an unfamiliar protective urge had surged through him.

Nathan's throat constricted as raw desire darkened his gaze.

Yet within moments, his expression frosted over again.

The proud Blackwood heir had already humbled himself with an apology, only to be rejected, slapped, and publicly humiliated. This was beyond endurance.

His momentary compassion now seemed utterly misplaced.

A discreet knock interrupted his thoughts.

"Sir," came the butler's voice, "Mr. Julian Montgomery has arrived. He's waiting in the drawing room."

Nathan's lips thinned. "Direct him to my study."

Downstairs, Cassandra Blackwood nearly squealed with excitement upon hearing of Julian's unexpected visit.

She rushed to don her custom-designed blush satin dress, applied meticulous cosmetics, and doused herself in expensive perfume before practically floating toward the grand staircase.

As she flung open her bedroom door, her younger sister Eleanor came into view - the autistic girl clumsily hopping along the hallway tiles while clutching that hideous stuffed bear.

Cassandra's nose wrinkled in disgust. She stalked forward and shoved Eleanor violently.

A startled cry echoed through the corridor as the fragile girl tumbled forward, landing hard on the marble floor. Even in her distress, she protectively cradled the mangled toy.

"Pathetic!" Cassandra sneered, flipping her glossy curls. "I've told you a thousand times not to play in the halls!"

Today's good mood spared Eleanor worse treatment. Cassandra simply stepped around her trembling form and continued downstairs.

Once alone, Eleanor slowly picked herself up, wincing from fresh bruises. Over years of torment, she'd learned this painful lesson - appearing simple-minded often lessened her sister's cruelty.

"Miss Eleanor!" Agnes gasped, rushing to the girl's side. Her kind eyes brimmed with concern. "What happened? Did you trip?"

"I'm fine," Eleanor whispered, biting her lip. "Just clumsy."

Agnes's gaze hardened. "Was it Cassandra again?"

"No! No!" The terrified girl hugged her bear tighter and scurried away, leaving the housekeeper shaking her head at such needless cruelty.

Meanwhile, Julian had been pacing the gardens. Upon reentering the manor, he collided with a heavily perfumed Cassandra.

"Mr. Montgomery!" she cooed, batting her lashes. Her saccharine tone could rot teeth. "What brings you here? Visiting Nathan?"

"Obviously," Julian replied coolly.

Having been Nathan's closest friend since Eton, he knew the Blackwood family dynamics intimately. Penelope Whitmore's scheming nature made him instinctively distrust her daughter.

Yet Cassandra, blinded by vanity, believed her beauty and pedigree made Julian's conquest inevitable. She seized his arm, pressing her surgically enhanced curves against him.

"Let me escort you, darling," she purred, plump lips puckering.

Julian recoiled as if touching poison. "Unhand me," he snarled. "That revolting perfume is contaminating my suit."
###Chapter 168

Cassandra's perfectly contoured face stiffened. A shiver of fear ran down her spine.

"Also, are we really that close? Don't you think this kind of physical contact is inappropriate?" Julian's voice was icy as he roughly extracted his arm from her grasp.

"Mr. Montgomery, I apologize. You're my brother's closest friend, so I consider you family too. I meant nothing by it—" Cassandra rushed to explain, terrified of earning Julian's disdain.

"You're his sister, not mine. Mind your manners next time."

With that cold dismissal, Julian turned on his heel and strode away.

This suit had been a gift from Evelyn. He treasured it too much to even consider dry cleaning, let alone let someone else soil it.

Cassandra's fists clenched so tightly her manicured nails left crescent marks in her palms, nearly drawing blood.

Suddenly, Julian paused mid-stride. Slipping one hand into his trouser pocket, he glanced back at her through narrowed eyes.

Cassandra instantly brightened, her heart pounding with renewed hope.

I knew it! she thought triumphantly. Julian's cold exterior is just an act. He must have feelings for me after all.

"I truly don't understand modern women's fashion choices."

"What?" Cassandra blinked in confusion.

"I've heard of lipstick before, but I always assumed it belonged on lips, not teeth. I suppose I've learned something new today."

Julian chuckled mockingly before sauntering away with effortless grace.

Only then did realization dawn. Cassandra dashed to the nearest restroom and bared her teeth at the mirror.

There it was—a glaring smear of red lipstick across her front teeth.

"Ugh!" she shrieked in humiliation, barely resisting the urge to shatter the reflective glass.

Julian pushed open the study door and found Nathan reviewing documents Oliver had delivered. Stretching his long legs across the sofa, Julian adopted a leisurely pose.

"That stepsister of yours is quite the predator—trying to maul me at first sight. Tsk tsk! Why are women so unrestrained these days? Evelyn would never behave so shamelessly."

Nathan's head snapped up at the comment, his gaze frosty. "What are you doing here?"

"Checking if you caught pneumonia from your dramatic all-night vigil in the rain." Julian extracted a cigarette from his silver case and placed it between his lips.

"Julian, you're enjoying this, aren't you?" Nathan's grip tightened around his pen.

"Hmm, perhaps. Still better than someone who can't even cross his ex-wife's threshold." Julian exhaled a lazy smoke ring.

Nathan's jaw clenched as he glared at his smug friend.

The truth stung. Three years of marriage to Evelyn, yet here he stood—reduced to waiting outside her home like some lovestruck teenager, getting drenched and ultimately rejected.

From that perspective, Julian's position did seem enviable.

The absurdity of it all fueled Nathan's rising anger.

Julian stubbed out his cigarette in the crystal ashtray and approached Nathan's desk. Planting both hands on the polished surface, he leaned forward with narrowed eyes.

Nathan met his challenging stare without flinching.

"Nathan, I'm going to pursue Evelyn. And I intend to win her."

Julian's piercing gaze seemed capable of slicing through Nathan's defenses, desperate to uncover what made this man so special in Evelyn's eyes.

After three years of neglect and ultimately forcing her into divorce, Nathan had proven himself an unworthy husband.

Julian refused to accept this injustice.

Nathan's breath caught. His knuckles whitened around the pen. "Don't forget. She's with Sebastian now."

"I don't care, as long as she's not with you."

Nathan felt blood rush to his temples, his composure fracturing. "They're not married. What does it matter if they're dating?"

Julian cocked an eyebrow, inching closer. "You're the real obstacle here. With Reginald's birthday approaching and your impending marriage to Victoria, yet you're lurking outside Evelyn's home like some tragic romantic hero. What were you hoping to accomplish? Recreate The Notebook?"

A bitter taste filled Nathan's mouth. "I had my reasons for seeing her."

"Reasons?" Julian scoffed. "Nathan, whatever your justifications, you're engaged now. Stay away from Evelyn."

"I won't go there again."

Nathan exhaled sharply, his brow furrowing. "But if you truly care for her, consider this—the entire Kingsley family adores her. They're eagerly anticipating her marriage to Sebastian. Your interference could jeopardize her chance at that prestigious union."

"Bullshit!" Julian's composure shattered. "Since when are the Kingsleys the only elite family around? What about the Montgomerys?" His voice rose in indignation. "And she's never marrying Sebastian!"

Nathan's eyes sharpened with sudden interest. "What did you say?"

Julian caught himself too late. Nathan leaned forward intently. "Explain that remark."

"I have my reasons for saying so." Julian recovered smoothly. "I don't believe their relationship is genuine. Evelyn doesn't love Sebastian—she's using him to spite you. If I were in her position, I'd certainly parade a new lover to prove my desirability post-divorce!"
###Chapter 169

Julian couldn't suppress the heat rising to his cheeks as he muttered, "And more than one man too!"

All night long, Julian's mind replayed Evelyn's devastating words like a broken record.

"Without Nathan, I wouldn't love anyone."

Julian clenched his fists. Why? Why couldn't she open her heart to anyone but that arrogant bastard?

But he'd never tell Nathan. The man's ego was already inflated enough. If he knew Evelyn still carried this torch for him...

Nathan would become absolutely unbearable.

A sharp pain lanced through Nathan's chest, radiating through his entire body like wildfire.

"So that's your game, Evelyn?" he whispered hoarsely. "You'd sacrifice your own happiness just to punish me?"

Monarch Grand Hotels flourished under Evelyn's leadership. Occupancy rates soared 40% higher than previous records, and their restaurants had waiting lists stretching weeks in advance.

The staff worked with renewed vigor. After Evelyn publicly defended them against Cassandra's abuse, they no longer felt like disposable servants. Their general manager would fight for them.

This unity transformed the hotel's performance beyond recognition.

Evelyn lounged in her office, reviewing the latest financial reports with satisfaction. Each success brought her closer to claiming the CEO title at Monarch Group.

Ambition burned brightly in her now. After years trapped in domestic drudgery, she'd rediscovered her purpose - and nothing would stop her.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Kingsley is here," Theodore announced, ushering Sebastian inside with a warm smile.

"Seb!"

Evelyn fluttered toward her brother like an excited sparrow, throwing her arms around him.

"How are you holding up?" Sebastian asked, steadying her with gentle hands at her waist. "Not overworking yourself?"

Evelyn shook her head. "If I can't handle this much, how will I manage as Monarch Group's CEO?"

She clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes widening playfully. "Oops! Seb, I didn't mean to rush your retirement. If you want to stay as CEO, I'm happy to remain your deputy."

"I just worry you'll abandon me again."

Sebastian tweaked her nose affectionately. "I'm more concerned you'll take off traveling and delay my retirement indefinitely."

"Never again."

Evelyn's expression sobered. "I was selfish before, chasing my own happiness without considering our family's needs." She squared her shoulders. "As the Kingsley heiress, I'll fulfill my responsibilities properly this time."

Her phone interrupted with an insistent ring.

"One moment." Evelyn disentangled herself and crossed to her desk. "Hello, Agnes."

"Young Madam!" Agnes's voice brimmed with emotion.

"I divorced Mr. Blackwood. Please call me Evelyn now." Her correction came gently.

"Of course, Ms. Carter. My apologies."

"What is it, Agnes?"

"I used the acupuncture needles you left. It's miraculous - the young master's headaches have vanished! And the bruise cream worked wonders too."

"Really? That's wonderful."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. She had no desire to discuss Nathan. "Agnes, I'm rather busy—"

"Young Madam!" Agnes interrupted urgently. "Is there truly no hope for reconciliation?"

Evelyn's voice turned to ice. "None."

"The household has descended into chaos since you left. No one looks after the young master properly—"

"He never listened to me either." A humorless smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You'll simply have to try harder."

"And poor Ms. Eleanor! No one cares for her either—"

Eleanor.

Evelyn's chest constricted at the thought of the sweet, autistic girl.

"The chairman's always occupied, Penelope ignores her, and Cassandra torments her daily! Those bruises on Eleanor's arms? All Cassandra's doing!"

Agnes sounded near tears. "With the young master constantly working, Eleanor has no protector. I try to intervene, but I'm just a servant—"

Evelyn's vision swam red. Her nails bit into her palms hard enough to draw blood.
###Chapter 170

"Evelyn Carter, you're truly heartless for tormenting your own sister!"

"Agnes, I understand your distress, but I'm no longer married to Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn's voice held quiet resignation. "I'm merely an outsider now with no authority to meddle in his family affairs."

The news of Cassandra's cruelty toward Eleanor had ignited fury in Evelyn's chest. Yet her hands were tied.

"Who else can I turn to? Who else would listen?" Agnes's voice cracked with unshed tears.

"Please don't cry, Agnes."

The sound of muffled sobs through the phone made Evelyn shift uncomfortably. She softened her tone. "You must protect Eleanor. If an opportunity arises, I'll do everything in my power to help."

"Thank you, Mrs. Carter!" Agnes's gratitude was palpable before the reluctant click of the call ending.

Evelyn stared at the darkened screen, exhaling slowly.

"That was the longtime housekeeper from the Blackwood estate you've mentioned before?" Sebastian Kingsley set down his teacup, his sharp gaze assessing.

"Yes. She raised Nathan since childhood." Evelyn traced the edge of her phone. "A genuinely kind soul. She showed me nothing but warmth during my time there."

This was Evelyn's nature - fierce retaliation against those who wronged her, eternal remembrance of kindness shown.

"For Agnes to reach out... the situation must be dire."

"It concerns Eleanor Blackwood, Nathan's youngest sister."

Evelyn's chest constricted at the thought of the guileless girl. The autistic child, withdrawn and vulnerable. Though born to Leonard and Penelope Blackwood, she remained invisible to them. "When I lived there, I could shield her from Cassandra's worst impulses. Now..." Her nails bit into her palms. "Without restraint, Cassandra's cruelty knows no bounds."

"However tragic Eleanor's circumstances, these are Blackwood family matters." Sebastian's sigh carried the weight of fraternal concern. "You're divorced from Nathan. Distance yourself."

"I know my limits." Evelyn circled behind her brother, draping her arms over his broad shoulders. "Now tell me, what brings the Monarch Group CEO here in broad daylight? Miss your baby sister?"

Sebastian's chuckle vibrated beneath her hands. "Always. But this arrived at dawn." From his tailored jacket, he produced an embossed invitation. "It warrants discussion."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Delivered personally by Reginald Blackwood's secretary." Amusement laced Sebastian's words, though skepticism darkened his eyes.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn. "My mess has splashed onto you." She flicked the heavy cardstock. "The Blackwoods and Kingsleys have been sworn business rivals for decades. Why extend an olive branch now? This reeks of Penelope's scheming."

Sebastian stroked his jawline. "If they're laying traps, the birthday gala could become a battlefield."

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." Evelyn tossed her hair defiantly. "I didn't fear Nathan - why should I tremble before some washed-up socialite?"

Her brother's large hand cradled her neck, his thumb brushing her pulse point. "I'm going."

"What?"

"We Kingsleys don't retreat from challenges." Steel underscored Sebastian's gentle tone. "I failed to protect you before. Never again."

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes.

Sebastian pulled her into an embrace. "If you walk into that vipers' nest alone, they'll tear you apart. I won't allow it."

Evelyn buried her face in his shoulder, warmth flooding her chest.

For so long, she'd chased love in all the wrong places. Now she remembered - true devotion had been here all along.
###Chapter 171

Evelyn knew the gamble of making Nathan fall for her was dangerous. She had already cried enough tears over that man. Now was the moment to release those feelings forever.

Time moved swiftly.

Before anyone realized, Reginald Blackwood's birthday celebration arrived.

The entire Blackwood clan considered this the year's most significant event - the patriarch's 80th birthday. Leonard spared no expense, purchasing a sprawling French château worth hundreds of millions as his father's gift. This became the gala's magnificent setting.

Only Crestview's elite received invitations - tycoons rubbing shoulders with renowned artists from the National Arts Council, all Reginald's longtime associates.

Victoria Sterling and Cassandra Blackwood began their preparations a week early - selecting designer gowns, scheduling spa treatments. Their frantic competition resembled brides preparing for weddings rather than guests attending a birthday.

Fate proved ironic when their elaborate ballgowns appeared absurdly overdressed for the château's refined atmosphere.

"Cassandra, what did you get Grandfather Reginald?" Victoria inquired with feigned interest.

"An antique Ming vase. Since he adores porcelain, he'll undoubtedly cherish my gift!" Cassandra twirled her new pink diamond ring smugly.

"Which dynasty?"

"Qing. 19th century."

Victoria batted her false lashes. "Isn't that rather... modern for an antique? Nathan purchased matching 18th century teacups at auction for forty million. Wouldn't his gift overshadow yours?"

Cassandra's face flushed crimson. "As CEO of Blackwood Industries, Nathan represents our entire family. Naturally his gift must reflect that status."

"How fortunate I'll soon marry such an impressive man," Victoria sighed dramatically.

"Besides, I'm Grandfather's favorite. He'll adore anything from me." Cassandra's glare turned icy. "What did you prepare, Victoria?"

"A Renaissance artifact. Ten million at Sotheby's. You'll see soon enough." Victoria's mysterious smile didn't reach her eyes.

Ten million?! Cassandra seethed inwardly. Hadn't Mother said the Sterlings faced bankruptcy? Clearly sleeping with Nathan came with financial perks. The thought made her blood boil.

"Darling, I'm concerned for you today," Cassandra purred. "Grandfather adores your ex-sister-in-law. When Evelyn arrives, won't things become... awkward?"

"Why awkward? I'm Nathan's fiancée. She's the one who should feel ashamed!" Victoria's eyes reddened with rising panic.

"But their divorce isn't finalized. Technically, she remains the legitimate Mrs. Blackwood today." Cassandra hid a smirk seeing Victoria's distress. "If Grandfather introduces her as his granddaughter-in-law, where does that leave you?"

Victoria's face drained of color, resentment coiling in her chest.

"Don't fret, darling." Cassandra turned as Penelope Whitmore approached, crystal wineglass in hand.

"Aunt Penelope!" Victoria clung to the older woman's arm like a lifeline.

The sight of this intimacy inexplicably irritated Cassandra. She's my mother, not yours! Stop stealing what's mine!

Penelope patted Victoria's hand coldly. "Stand tall, dear. Though your mother isn't present, I'll ensure Evelyn causes no trouble tonight."
###Chapter 172

"Aunt Penelope, your presence means everything to me." Victoria's voice trembled with gratitude, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

The grand hall erupted in hushed murmurs as all heads turned simultaneously toward the entrance.

Nathan Blackwood and Julian Montgomery strode in side by side, commanding every gaze in the room.

The striking pair captivated the crowd. Either man could dominate Hollywood overnight with those chiseled features alone.

Both wore tailored suits with polished leather shoes, yet their styles contrasted sharply. Nathan's black ensemble exuded icy authority while Julian's pristine white suit radiated effortless elegance.

"Oh my heavens! Mr. Blackwood and Mr. Montgomery together - this is too much!"

"I could die happy after seeing this! Look at Mr. Blackwood's godlike proportions! He's literally walking perfection!"

"That wicked smirk of Mr. Montgomery's could steal any woman's soul!"

Victoria shot Cassandra a knowing glance as the younger woman stared hungrily at Julian. "Still haven't tamed your white whale, Cassie? After all these years of pining?"

"Patience is a virtue," Cassandra hissed through clenched teeth. "He'll be mine eventually."

Victoria's lips curled. "Look at those vultures circling him. If you wait much longer, someone else might snatch him first."

Cassandra's jaw tightened until her molars ached.

Of course I want to be Mrs. Montgomery! she thought bitterly. But after that humiliating rejection, how can I face him? Still, I can't let Victoria see me fail!

As Nathan and Julian approached, Victoria's attention locked onto Nathan. She was about to rush forward when another wave of whispers made her freeze.

Bathed in golden sunset light streaming through the doors, an ethereal silhouette appeared.

The vision that made Victoria's blood boil - Evelyn Carter.

"Divine," Julian murmured, his gaze riveted on Evelyn.

Nathan's pupils dilated, his breathing growing ragged as his pulse accelerated.

"Who is that goddess? She carries herself like royalty!"

"That's a Master Febb original from Helix Couture! Only true elites can commission his work!"

"The dress is magnificent, but she elevates it to art! Helix should make her their ambassador!"

The admiring whispers swirled through the hall like autumn leaves.

Evelyn had forgone conventional evening wear for a bespoke pale azure gown with a high neckline and delicate landscape embroidery that hugged her curves perfectly.

Her understated elegance effortlessly eclipsed both Victoria and Cassandra.

Damn her! Cassandra seethed. Why didn't I think of that look? Penelope's expression darkened similarly.

Penelope had chosen an expensive high-necked gown to showcase her maintained figure. Now this country mouse had stolen her thunder with superior youth and poise.

No amount of designer clothes could disguise Penelope's fading beauty next to Evelyn's radiant presence. The bitter truth burned in her chest.
###Chapter 173

Evelyn Carter immediately noticed how Nathan Blackwood's intense gaze had been tracking her every movement since she entered the grand ballroom.

Victoria Sterling's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms as bitter jealousy twisted her delicate features.

"Evelyn!" Julian Montgomery's face lit up with genuine delight as he raised his champagne flute in greeting.

She inclined her head gracefully, returning his warm smile with one of her own.

Cassandra Blackwood's cheeks flushed with barely contained rage when she witnessed her brother's obvious affection for Evelyn.

Just as Evelyn attempted to walk past Nathan without acknowledgment, his strong fingers suddenly encircled her wrist.

"Where do you think you're going?" His deep voice vibrated through her.

"Anywhere you're not, Mr. Blackwood." She extracted her arm with practiced elegance, her polite smile never reaching her stormy eyes.

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. Before he could respond, Penelope Whitmore materialized with Victoria clinging to her arm like a designer accessory.

"Evelyn darling, we're so pleased you could join us. We weren't certain you'd attend." Penelope's saccharine tone dripped with false warmth.

All conversation in their immediate vicinity ceased as guests strained to catch every word of this unfolding drama.

"Mrs. Blackwood, you needn't worry. Of course I'd come. Grandfather Reginald specifically requested my presence to celebrate this milestone with Nathan and me." Evelyn's musical laughter carried effortlessly across the silent room.

Nathan's stormy expression darkened further.

Whispers erupted among the assembled elite as speculative glances darted between Evelyn and Victoria.

"Wasn't Ms. Sterling publicly announced as Mr. Blackwood's fiancée last season?"

"Yet he hasn't made any official statement since then..."

"This mysterious beauty carries herself like royalty. Who is she really?"

"Did you see how naturally she mentioned the family patriarch? She must be incredibly close to the Blackwoods."

Victoria's porcelain complexion turned ashen. How dare this nobody steal my spotlight? She's implying she has some special claim to Nathan and the Blackwood legacy!

"Evelyn, we're all aware of your... unique relationship with Grandfather Reginald." Penelope's smile remained fixed as venomous thoughts swirled beneath her polished exterior. "But where is Mr. Kingsley from Monarch Group? Gregory specifically extended an invitation. We expected him to accompany you."

The crowd gasped collectively.

Sebastian Kingsley? Of the legendary Monarch Group?

Everyone knew the Blackwoods and Kingsleys were sworn rivals who hadn't interacted socially in decades. The idea of Sebastian Kingsley attending Reginald Blackwood's birthday was unthinkable.

Nathan recognized Penelope's transparent attempt to humiliate Evelyn, his protective instincts flaring.

Before he could intervene, Evelyn responded with icy composure. "Mrs. Blackwood, why would Mr. Kingsley's attendance concern me?"

Penelope's crimson lips curled triumphantly. "Because he's your current lover, of course."

She turned to address the rapt audience. "Allow me to properly introduce everyone. This is Ms. Evelyn Carter - Nathan's former wife. Though these days, she's better known as the paramour of Monarch Group's CEO, Sebastian Kingsley."
###Chapter 174

The grand ballroom plunged into stunned silence before erupting into shocked murmurs.

Guests who had come expecting a simple birthday celebration found themselves witnessing a scandalous revelation.

Evelyn's captivating eyes turned icy, though her expression remained perfectly composed.

Everything was proceeding exactly as she'd anticipated.

Julian Montgomery, however, broke into a cold sweat and immediately moved to intercept Evelyn.

His towering frame loomed protectively as he called out with concern, "Evelyn..."

She turned, her lips curving into a dazzling crescent moon smile. "I'm perfectly fine."

Julian's pulse quickened.

Who could remain unaffected by such radiant charm?

"Aunt Penelope," Nathan's voice cut through the whispers like frost, "this is Grandfather's birthday celebration. Kindly refrain from airing private family matters." His glare burned with barely contained fury.

Penelope feigned remorse. "Forgive me, Nathan. I spoke without thinking." Her saccharine smile returned. "But since none of our guests know Evelyn, I thought an introduction might help. Even if she's no longer part of our family, she was once my daughter-in-law."

Her words dripped with false concern. "We shouldn't let anyone look down on her just because she comes from humble rural beginnings."

The guests' whispers intensified as their gazes turned pitying toward Evelyn.

Victoria Sterling and Cassandra Blackwood exchanged triumphant smirks.

Not only had Evelyn's divorce been publicly confirmed, but her connection to Sebastian Kingsley had also been exposed.

Victoria thought viciously, That gold-digging harlot will never sink her claws into Nathan again!

"How thoughtful of you, Mrs. Blackwood." Evelyn's voice rang clear as crystal, her posture regal as a crimson rose in full bloom. "But I fail to see why my rural upbringing should invite anyone's disdain. Must one's worth be measured by pedigree alone?"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, his smoldering gaze locked on his ex-wife. Had their marriage truly meant so little to her?

Evelyn's dignified response resonated with several guests.

"Well said! My grandfather started as a farmer - now he owns three vineyards!"

"Mrs. Blackwood's being rather hypocritical, isn't she?"

"Weren't her own parents bankrupt social climbers? At least farmers have honest livelihoods!"

Penelope's face flushed crimson with humiliation. She hadn't anticipated Evelyn deflecting the attack so effortlessly.

"Bravo!" Julian chuckled near Evelyn's ear, his breath warm against her skin. "Country girls have always been my preference - so refreshingly genuine."

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll. Was she supposed to thank him for that?

Nathan's knuckles whitened as he watched their intimate exchange, dark fury coiling in his chest.

"Nathan!" Victoria materialized at his side, her manicured fingers possessively curling around his arm. "Don't be cross with Aunt Penelope. She only meant to spare Ms. Carter future embarrassment by addressing the matter openly."

Nathan's expression remained inscrutable, though his arm tensed beneath her touch.

The guests' murmurs took a new turn:

"How awkward for Ms. Carter to attend after the divorce!"

"Didn't you hear? Reginald Blackwood personally invited her."

"More likely she's here to make trouble - probably regrets losing such a catch!"

"Pay them no mind, Evelyn." Julian's eyes turned dangerous. "Ignorant tongues deserve to be silenced."

Evelyn merely laughed, the picture of grace under fire. "Gossip has never troubled me."

Just as Victoria began preening over her perceived victory, a thunderous voice cut through the chatter:

"Let me see who dares make my beloved Evelyn uncomfortable!"

All heads turned as Reginald Blackwood made his entrance, flanked by his son Leonard and secretary Marcus Underwood.

Gone was the wheelchair - the patriarch stood tall in his white tuxedo, silver hair impeccably groomed, his complexion glowing with health that belied years of illness.

"Grandfather!" Evelyn's face lit with genuine delight at his robust appearance.

Penelope shot Victoria a meaningful look before adopting a syrupy smile. "Father, what a joy to have our entire family together for your special day!"
###Chapter 175

"Victoria, as Nathan's future wife, why don't you come over and assist Grandfather?" Penelope suggested with a tight smile.

"Grandfather, allow me to help you," Victoria said sweetly, stepping forward with practiced grace.

Just as she moved, Reginald's sharp gaze flickered toward Nathan and Evelyn.

"Nathan, Evelyn—I want the two of you by my side."

He then shot Leonard a dismissive glance. "You irritate me. I'd rather have these young ones around—they make me feel alive."

Leonard sighed but released his father's arm without protest.

Victoria froze mid-step, her cheeks burning with humiliation. She forced a brittle smile, though her fingers curled into fists at her sides.

That wretched old man! Why won't he just drop dead already?

Evelyn's lashes lowered slightly, her expression unreadable. She glanced at Nathan.

Their eyes met—his dark and unyielding, hers cool and detached.

Without a word, she turned away, presenting him with nothing but the elegant line of her profile.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening before he moved to stand beside Reginald.

The guests exchanged knowing looks.

It was clear—Reginald Blackwood had no intention of accepting Victoria Sterling as part of the family.

Penelope's face flushed with barely contained fury. Not only had Reginald publicly slighted Victoria, but he’d also dismissed her, the esteemed wife of Blackwood Industries' chairman.

Yet she could do nothing but force a smile. The old man still held shares and influence—his word was law in the Blackwood family.

"Grandfather, your complexion is radiant today," Evelyn said warmly as she took Reginald's arm. "You look stronger than ever."

"Seeing you always lifts my spirits, Evelyn." Reginald patted her hand affectionately. "At this rate, I might just outlive all of you!"

His eyes swept over her dress approvingly. "Perfection. I knew this gown would suit you. Far more tasteful than those who parade around half-dressed."

Nathan stiffened. So this was why Evelyn was wearing that dress—his grandfather had chosen it.

The guests' gazes shifted to Victoria, their judgment unmistakable.

It was obvious—Reginald adored Evelyn and had no regard for Victoria.

Even divorced, Evelyn remained family in his eyes.

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms as whispers swirled around her.

"Since everyone is gathered, let’s take a family portrait first," Penelope interjected smoothly, steering Victoria forward. She turned to Evelyn with a saccharine smile. "Evelyn, would you mind taking the photo for us?"

"Of course not." Evelyn’s smile was serene.

"Evelyn is my guest of honor," Reginald snapped, glaring at Penelope. "She belongs in this portrait—right beside me. Anyone who dares make her feel unwelcome will answer to me."

Penelope’s lips trembled. She shot Leonard a pleading look.

Leonard cleared his throat. "Father, I know you’re fond of Evelyn, but given the divorce, it might be... inappropriate for her to be in our family photos."

"And why should that matter?" Reginald’s voice boomed. "If she’s no longer my granddaughter by marriage, then I’ll claim her as my own. She will always be family!"

Evelyn’s throat tightened. The old man’s unwavering loyalty was the one thing that still tied her to the Blackwoods.

Victoria’s vision darkened with rage.

The guests murmured in astonishment.

What kind of spell had Evelyn Carter cast to earn such devotion?

"Grandfather." Nathan’s voice was strained. "You’re putting Evelyn in an awkward position. She may not wish to be your granddaughter."

Reginald scoffed. "It’s not her reluctance I sense—it’s yours." He jabbed a finger at Nathan. "That scowl says enough. Wipe it off."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh.

Nathan’s expression turned stony. Next to Evelyn, he might as well have been an afterthought in his grandfather’s eyes.

Just as the tension peaked, a smooth, velvety voice cut through the room.

"Your affection for Evelyn is touching, Reginald. But given the circumstances, perhaps it’s best she not be drawn further into family matters."

All heads turned toward the entrance.

Sebastian Kingsley stood there, his presence commanding the room.
###Chapter 176

All heads turned toward the melodious voice that had just spoken.

Gasps echoed through the grand hall as guests recognized the newcomer.

Sebastian Kingsley entered with effortless grace, his tailored navy suit accentuating his aristocratic bearing. Theodore Winslow followed closely behind, carrying a velvet gift box.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. Her lips parted instinctively to call out to her brother before she caught herself.

Nathan Blackwood's jaw tightened. His glacial gaze turned arctic, sending waves of cold through the room.

Evelyn shivered involuntarily, as if standing beside an active glacier.

She stole a glance at Nathan. His chiseled features had darkened dangerously, storm clouds gathering in his piercing eyes.

"Reginald, my sincerest apologies for my tardiness." Sebastian bowed respectfully to the elder Blackwood.

Tonight, Sebastian carried himself differently. His usually rebellious demeanor had been replaced by refined elegance that made several society ladies fan themselves.

The female guests' eyes darted between Nathan, Sebastian, and Julian Montgomery, mentally debating which billionaire would star in their fantasies tonight.

"Not at all, my boy. I'm delighted you could join us." Reginald smiled warmly, showing no prejudice despite Sebastian being Harrison Kingsley's son.

Evelyn exhaled quietly in relief.

She'd worried Reginald might object to Sebastian's presence, but the old gentleman proved more open-minded than she'd anticipated.

"Evelyn, darling." Sebastian extended his hand toward his sister, his smile tender.

Victoria Sterling and Penelope Whitmore exchanged triumphant glances. Their plan was unfolding perfectly.

They'd hoped to witness two wealthy heirs fighting over Evelyn, exposing her as a gold-digger and ruining her reputation with Reginald simultaneously.

"Coming."

Without hesitation, Evelyn moved toward Sebastian, her steps light.

Victoria and Penelope gaped in shock.

Julian Montgomery's heart clenched painfully as he watched the woman he loved return to another man's side. The bitter taste of being the other man burned his throat.

Nathan's entire body tensed. His fingers twitched before curling into white-knuckled fists.

He didn't know what he wanted to grasp - only that an inexplicable ache spread through his chest.

"Evelyn, when did you and Sebastian become so close?" Reginald asked, brows knitting in confusion.

"Father, you don't know yet—" Penelope began gleefully.

Sebastian smoothly interrupted, "Reginald, our family is eternally grateful for your kindness to Evelyn these past three years. She speaks of you often as the grandfather she never had."

His strong arm encircled Evelyn's slender waist possessively, drawing gasps from the crowd.

Together, they looked like a Renaissance painting come to life - the perfect aristocratic couple.

Nathan felt his blood turn to ice in his veins.

"But from today forward," Sebastian continued smoothly, "the Kingsleys will take over Evelyn's care. Though she'll no longer be a Blackwood, she'll always cherish you as family."

His diplomatic words left no room for criticism.

"Oh!" Realization dawned on Reginald's face. He looked between them in astonishment. "Evelyn, are you and Sebastian...?"
###Chapter 177

The tension in Cliffside Manor was palpable.

Leonard Blackwood leaned closer to Reginald, his voice barely above a whisper. "Father, Evelyn is involved with Sebastian Kingsley."

A heavy silence followed his words.

"Since Evelyn has moved on," Leonard continued carefully, "please don't try to push her back toward Nathan. Love can't be forced."

Penelope Whitmore seized the opportunity to add fuel to the fire. "I agree, Father." Her voice dripped with false concern. "Sebastian came for Evelyn the moment Nathan divorced her. That alone proves they've been together for some time."

Reginald's sharp gaze snapped to her. "Is that true?"

"Of course." Penelope's smile was sweet, but her eyes gleamed with malice. "Otherwise, how could their relationship progress so quickly? I've always said we shouldn't interfere with the children's lives. What's the point of a loveless marriage? Let them find happiness on their own."

She paused, letting her words sink in.

"You don’t need to worry about Evelyn anymore. The Kingsleys are just as influential as our family."

Her fingers tightened around her glass.

Evelyn, let’s see how you keep pretending to be innocent in front of Reginald now.

She bit her lip, feigning sadness.

She had anticipated this moment—prepared for Reginald’s disappointment, ready to bear his anger.

But then, Nathan unexpectedly spoke up.

"Grandfather, don’t blame Evelyn." His voice was steady, though his jaw clenched. "She owes me nothing. If she’s happy with Sebastian, then I give them my blessing."

The word blessing came out strained, almost bitter.

Penelope froze.

This wasn’t the reaction she had expected.

Nathan had always been proud, unyielding. In the past, she would have reveled in his defiance.

Now, she only felt irritation.

"Ridiculous!" Reginald snapped, slamming his hand on the table. "What difference does your blessing make? I asked you to reconcile with her, but you failed! Is it Evelyn’s fault for finding someone better? No—it’s yours!"

His voice rose. "You’re not as fortunate as Sebastian to have such a remarkable woman!"

The room fell deadly silent.

Penelope and Victoria Sterling paled, their carefully applied makeup doing little to hide their shock.

They had underestimated one crucial fact.

Reginald adored Evelyn.

No matter what they said, he would never see her as the villain.

Nathan’s chest tightened, but he forced himself to remain composed. "I’m glad you’re not upset with her."

"Upset? Why would I be?" Reginald scoffed. "I only want the best for her!" He turned, gesturing for Evelyn and Sebastian to approach. "Come here, both of you."

The siblings exchanged a glance before obeying.

"Grandfather, I’m sorry for keeping this from you," Evelyn murmured, her eyes downcast.

Reginald’s expression softened. "It doesn’t matter. Your happiness is all I care about."

Then his gaze hardened as it landed on Sebastian. "You’re a man of power, with siblings who rely on you. Promise me you’ll protect Evelyn. If she suffers even a little after marrying you, I won’t care that you’re a Kingsley. I will make you regret it."

Sebastian’s lips twitched.

Memories flashed through his mind—Evelyn as a child, riding on Dominic’s back like a horse, or painting Maxwell’s face with lipstick.

He chuckled. "I promise. She’ll never want for anything."

Reginald studied him, then exhaled in relief. "Good. Then I’ll entrust her to you now. Give her everything my grandson couldn’t. Love her properly."

Nathan flinched as if struck.

Sebastian nodded firmly. "I will."

Nathan’s breath hitched.

His eyes burned as he stared at Evelyn—the woman who had once been his wife.

For a fleeting moment, he felt hollow, as if his soul had been ripped away.

His vision blurred.

And for the first time in years, Nathan Blackwood fought back tears.
###Chapter 178

Nathan Blackwood was drowning in humiliation.

Julian Montgomery observed this with simmering jealousy. How could he possibly compete with such a formidable rival? All he could do was wait.

Wait with bated breath!

Reginald Blackwood's words moved Evelyn Carter deeply. Her long lashes fluttered as she whispered, "Grandfather..."

"Enough now. Leonard, it's your birthday today," Evelyn quickly interjected with a gentle smile. "Let's focus on happier matters. Why don't we see what gifts everyone has brought?"

"Excellent idea! Presents first!" Reginald rubbed his hands together like an excited child, his eyes twinkling with anticipation.

The elderly gentleman's childlike enthusiasm was utterly endearing.

Julian and other distinguished guests presented their offerings one by one. Reginald accepted each with gracious nods and warm smiles.

"Grandfather!"

Julian stepped forward with a perfect gentleman's bow, his charming smile radiant. "Since Nathan is my dearest friend, his grandfather is mine as well. May your health and happiness endure as long as the earth keeps turning!"

"What a fine young man. Thank you, my boy!" Reginald's grin stretched from ear to ear.

"Happy birthday, Grandfather!"

Cassandra Blackwood made her entrance with calculated shyness, strategically positioning herself beside Julian. "I know how much you adore antiques," she purred, deliberately leaning closer to Julian.

Julian didn't even glance her way as he smoothly stepped aside.

Cassandra wobbled precariously, nearly toppling over before regaining her balance.

Muffled laughter rippled through the crowd. The humiliation burned.

Cassandra's cheeks flamed as she fought back tears of rage, silently cursing every amused guest.

A servant presented her carefully selected 19th-century vase. Reginald nodded politely. "Lovely. Thank you, Cassandra."

Her lips curled in smug satisfaction - until Marcus Underwood approached carrying a rolled parchment tied with an elegant red ribbon.

"Mr. Blackwood, this is from Miss Eleanor."

"Eleanor's gift? Bring it here at once!"

Reginald unrolled the parchment and burst into delighted laughter. "Hah! Is this me? Magnificent! What extraordinary talent!"

The crowd pressed closer to see what had delighted the patriarch so.

Cassandra froze. Her moment had lasted precisely three seconds.

The detailed sketch captured Reginald's laughing visage with remarkable precision, every wrinkle lovingly rendered. In the corner, delicate script read: "Happy Birthday, Grandfather! May you laugh like this every day. Love, Eleanor."

"Look at Eleanor's masterpiece! The likeness is uncanny! Such remarkable talent!" Reginald boasted with grandfatherly pride.

Julian's expression softened at the thought of the sweet girl, his smile tender.

This expression made Cassandra's face harden, jealousy souring her stomach.

"While Eleanor is still developing her skills, she undoubtedly possesses remarkable artistic potential," Nathan remarked evenly.

"Grandfather, Eleanor has exceptional talent," Evelyn seized the opportunity. "She's dreamed of attending the Academy of Fine Arts. Even Nathan, who rarely praises anyone, acknowledges her gift. Imagine what she could achieve with proper training - in five years, she could bring great honor to our family."

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. Was Evelyn implying he never gave compliments?

"What's this? Don't you care about your daughter's development?" Reginald's gaze grew distant, tinged with melancholy. "Eleanor isn't like other children. Given her... condition, she needs her parents' attention more than ever."
###Chapter 179

Nathan and Cassandra exchanged knowing glances, their forced smiles barely concealing their irritation.

"I absolutely adore this present. Where's Eleanor? Bring her here so her grandfather can embrace her!" Reginald's voice brimmed with affection.

"Miss Eleanor isn't feeling well, sir. She's resting upstairs but will join us later," Marcus explained smoothly.

"Oh, that poor dear..."

Reginald sighed heavily. "Marcus, have this sketch professionally framed and display it in my study where I can admire it daily."

Marcus bowed slightly before carefully storing the delicate artwork.

Witnessing her grandfather's obvious preference for Eleanor's humble gift, Cassandra's hands clenched into fists. Jealousy burned in her chest like acid.

She had assumed her younger sister - always financially constrained - would embarrass herself with some pitiful offering.

Yet Eleanor had outmaneuvered her completely. The million-dollar antique vase Cassandra had purchased paled in comparison to that simple drawing in Reginald's eyes.

Eleanor will pay for this humiliation, Cassandra vowed silently, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

Meanwhile, Victoria paced anxiously in the hallway until Penelope arrived.

"Well?" Victoria demanded, arms crossed tightly over her chest. "What's our next move?"

Penelope's lips curled into a venomous smile. "Patience, my dear. An important guest will arrive shortly. I have the perfect plan to disgrace Evelyn publicly."

Back in the grand hall, Reginald continued unwrapping presents.

When Nathan presented the exquisite 18th-century porcelain teacups, murmurs of appreciation rippled through the crowd.

Several antique connoisseurs among the guests leaned forward eagerly for closer inspection.

To everyone's amusement, Reginald clutched the box protectively against his chest. "These are from my precious grandson! No grubby fingers touching them!"

The guests erupted in laughter. Even Evelyn covered her mouth to hide her smile.

"Grandfather, these were originally part of Harrison Kingsley's private collection," Nathan explained, glancing pointedly at Sebastian. "I acquired them at the Monarch Group charity auction."

"Ah! Harrison's taste was always impeccable!" Reginald stroked the box reverently. "No collector in Crestview could rival him."

"My father will be honored to know his treasures have found such appreciative hands," Sebastian replied with effortless charm.

That was Sebastian's gift - his mere presence seemed to diffuse tension, his diplomatic words weaving connections where none seemed possible.

The moment shattered when Victoria's saccharine voice cut through the room. "Grandfather! My gift for you!"

All eyes turned to her, many filled with thinly veiled disdain.

Everyone knew Reginald's opinion of Victoria. Her dreams of becoming a Blackwood seemed increasingly delusional.

"Father, Victoria spent months searching for the perfect gift," Leonard interjected smoothly. "Knowing your love for Renaissance art, she acquired an authenticated masterpiece."

"Oh?" Reginald's eyebrows lifted with mild interest.

Victoria signaled the servants, who carried in a large framed painting with white-gloved hands.

Several art experts gathered around eagerly.

Then Reginald's expression darkened. "Thank you," he said curtly.

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Someone voiced the question on everyone's mind: "Is this truly Renaissance period? It appears... questionable."
###Chapter 180

"What are you implying?!" Victoria's face twisted in fury, her once-charming smile freezing into a grimace. "I purchased this painting from Montgomery Auction House! How dare you call it a forgery?"

With that single accusation, she dragged the prestigious Montgomery name into the mud.

Julian couldn't suppress a derisive smirk. "Ms. Sterling, given how rarely you attend auctions, I suppose you're unaware of how they operate?" His tone dripped with condescension. "My family owns the largest auction house in the country. Every item we acquire undergoes rigorous authentication. We don't deal in counterfeits. If you lack expertise, kindly refrain from tarnishing my family's reputation."

Nathan's gaze darkened.

A memory surfaced—Evelyn's sly smirk at the charity auction, goading Victoria into paying ten times the market price for a mere replica.

Had Evelyn anticipated Victoria gifting this painting to Reginald? Was it mere coincidence, or had she orchestrated this humiliation from the start?

"Ms. Sterling, there's a distinction between a forgery and a replica," another appraiser interjected, siding with Julian. "Many Renaissance-era artists replicated masterpieces, and such works still hold historical value. A skilled reproduction can command a high price. However, the one you acquired is... subpar. Otherwise, the flaws wouldn't be so glaring."

"This can't be a replica! I spent ten million dollars at Montgomery Auction House!" Victoria blurted, panic lacing her voice.

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Cassandra ducked her head, biting her lip to stifle a giggle.

The irony was too delicious.

"Ten million? This piece is worth one million at most," Julian remarked dryly. "Ms. Sterling, I suppose you made quite the generous donation at that charity auction."

Victoria's vision swam, her pulse pounding in her ears.

Even Penelope couldn't bear to watch. Humiliated, she turned away, refusing to defend her foolish niece.

"Enough," Reginald interjected calmly, though his patience was thinning. "A gift is a gesture of goodwill. Marcus, please take it."

"Evelyn!" Victoria whirled on her, venom in her tone. "What grudge do you hold against me? Was this your plan all along—to humiliate me?"

The room fell silent, all eyes shifting to Evelyn.

Evelyn blinked, her doe-like eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Humiliate you? Ms. Sterling, I'm afraid I don't understand."

Sebastian and Julian exchanged glances.

Was Evelyn turning the tables?

"You set me up!" Victoria jabbed a finger at her. "You knew this was a replica, yet you drove up the price! You tricked me into wasting ten million!"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, his cold stare fixed on Evelyn.

"Tricked you?" Evelyn tilted her head, her voice soft with confusion. "How? The auction was transparent. No one forced you to bid."

Sebastian stepped forward, shielding his sister. "Ms. Sterling, auctions operate on free competition. If you lacked the means, why participate? Blaming Evelyn for your own recklessness is absurd."

"Absurd? She manipulated the entire bidding war!" Victoria seethed. "Every time I raised my paddle, she countered! She inflated the price from one million to nine, then abandoned the bid at ten! She deliberately trapped me into overspending on a worthless replica!"

Julian cleared his throat. "For the record, it's a replica, not worthless. There is a difference."
###Chapter 181

Evelyn Carter's voice remained steady as she spoke. "If she truly desired this artwork, why did she withdraw from the bidding? She never intended to purchase it - this was merely a ploy to manipulate me!"

The crowd's expressions shifted with sudden understanding.

"Did Ms. Sterling deliberately scheme against Ms. Carter due to lingering feelings for Mr. Blackwood?"

"That seems unlikely. Their divorce is finalized. What purpose would such pettiness serve?"

"You underestimate Nathan Blackwood's appeal. A man of his caliber isn't easily forgotten."

"Such refined elegance masking such cunning tactics. Wasting intellect on romantic games - what a shame!"

The murmurs criticizing Evelyn brought visible satisfaction to Victoria Sterling's face.

"Ms. Carter, is this accusation accurate?" Leonard Blackwood's brow furrowed as he studied Evelyn intently.

Reginald Blackwood's gaze also settled on Evelyn, awaiting her response.

"Ms. Sterling, you've gravely misinterpreted my actions."

Evelyn stepped forward, her striking features now etched with wounded dignity. "I initiated the bidding for this painting. You were the one who followed my lead. My appreciation for this artwork and desire to support the charity motivated my participation from the outset. Both Mr. Blackwood and Mr. Montgomery can attest to this."

The audience's perception shifted visibly.

"You—!" Victoria's fury rendered her momentarily speechless.

"I can corroborate her account!"

Julian Montgomery rose promptly, eager to demonstrate loyalty to his admired Evelyn. "Ms. Carter placed the opening bid, with Ms. Sterling subsequently joining. By rights, this painting should belong to Ms. Carter."

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze chilled as it settled on Julian. This persistent nuisance needed removal.

"My initial intention was to acquire this piece for my personal collection," Evelyn continued, her voice softening. "The original hanging in Grandfather's study holds special meaning for me. Even as a reproduction, this painting evokes cherished memories of our time together."

Her lashes lowered delicately as she sighed. "When Ms. Sterling demonstrated such determined interest, I withdrew after several bidding rounds as proper etiquette dictates. I fail to comprehend how this constitutes wrongdoing. Your accusations wounded me deeply, Ms. Sterling. If you feel financially disadvantaged, I'm prepared to purchase the painting from you to rectify your loss."

The dramatic reversal stunned observers.

Evelyn's luminous eyes shimmered with convincing sincerity, her acting prowess making the performance utterly believable.

Nathan tilted his head slightly, exhaling through clenched teeth as his intense focus remained fixed on her.

He observed silently, allowing her theatrical display to continue.

"Preposterous!" Victoria's complexion flushed crimson with humiliation.

As she teetered on the brink of public outburst, Penelope Whitmore intervened swiftly with a discreet pinch. The sharp pain restored Victoria's composure, preventing an undignified scene.

"A simple misunderstanding!" Penelope interjected smoothly. "Father, Victoria rarely attends such events and often follows others' leads in purchases. What matters is her thoughtful intention to select your gift."

Her meaningful glance at Victoria carried unspoken instruction. "Your mother just called regarding an urgent matter at home. You should contact her immediately - don't keep her waiting. Go now."

Victoria retreated through clenched teeth, frustration evident in every stiff movement.

Reginald's brow creased momentarily before he grasped Evelyn's hand tenderly. "Evelyn, had you mentioned your admiration for that painting, I would have gifted it without hesitation. A Renaissance masterpiece means nothing compared to your happiness. Were it Michelangelo's David you desired, I would move heaven and earth to obtain it! My dear, you must know I deny you nothing."

"Your affection is treasure enough, Grandfather. I require nothing more." Evelyn squeezed Reginald's hand, her smile radiant.

The assembled guests reached unanimous understanding.

Though legally divorced from Evelyn, Nathan clearly maintained connections. Victoria Sterling's romantic aspirations appeared doomed.
###Chapter 182

The moment arrived when Evelyn Carter stepped forward to present her birthday offering.

As the attendants carried in the antique rosewood chair, a collective gasp swept through the gathering of connoisseurs and collectors.

"Magnificent! This is museum-quality craftsmanship!"

"Good heavens! I'd give anything to examine it properly!"

"Aside from those porcelain teacups earlier, this is undoubtedly the most valuable gift Reginald has received today!"

"Who is this Ms. Carter? To casually present 17th-century furniture as a gift! It appears Mr. Blackwood's former wife moves in elite circles!"

Nathan Blackwood felt his chest constrict. His stormy gaze remained fixed on his ex-wife with unsettling intensity.

He never anticipated Evelyn could produce something the Kingsley family had acquired at that charity auction - a piece valued at $100 million!

This revelation spoke volumes about the Kingsley family's devotion to her.

Then Evelyn's next words struck Nathan like a physical blow.

"Grandfather, this comes from both Sebastian and myself." Her luminous eyes sparkled as she offered her blessing. "May your years be filled with joy and robust health."

Sebastian Kingsley executed a graceful bow. "Mr. Blackwood, I wish you vitality that outlasts the celestial bodies themselves. May every aspiration find fulfillment."

Standing together, Evelyn and Sebastian formed a picture of aristocratic elegance.

They appeared as though destiny itself had paired them.

Nathan's heart shuddered violently. His hand instinctively rose to his chest before he forced it down, unwilling to betray his turmoil.

"My dear child! This is far too extravagant!" Reginald's voice trembled with emotion even as he scolded gently. "Evelyn, any token from you would delight me. There was no need for such extravagance! Sebastian, your generosity overwhelms me."

Sebastian's smile remained composed. "Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn and I sought only to bring you happiness with our selection."

Cassandra Blackwood's lips curled in a sneer. "Grandfather, you should accept it. Clearly Ms. Carter is leveraging Mr. Kingsley's resources to impress everyone. How convenient to share credit for a gift you didn't purchase. Ms. Carter, your frugality is... impressive."

Evelyn's crimson lips curved slightly. "I wouldn't presume upon Sebastian's kindness. I've prepared a modest personal gift as well, though it pales beside his offering."

Cassandra's eyes widened. This cunning woman had a secondary gift?!

"Evelyn! What else have you brought? Show me at once!" Reginald's excitement reignited.

A mysterious glimmer shone in Evelyn's eyes as she signaled with a graceful hand.

Theodore Winslow entered bearing an exquisite lacquered box.

Within lay a breathtaking jade landscape carving of unparalleled craftsmanship, where every mountain ridge and waterway had been rendered with astonishing precision.

The assembly erupted in awed murmurs.

Even Nathan and Julian Montgomery found themselves drawn to the masterpiece. Only a true artisan could achieve such lifelike detail.

Reginald's hands trembled as he pointed. "This... this resembles Edmund Fairchild's 'Endless Mountain Ranges'! Evelyn, how did you acquire this?!"

Edmund Fairchild, the legendary sculptor whose rare works commanded astronomical prices internationally.

"Grandfather, you flatter me too much." Evelyn's cheeks pinkened as she tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "This is my humble imitation - 'Hundred League Vista'. I labored over every detail, but it falls far short of Master Fairchild's genius. Merely a student's tribute."

The crowd regarded this stunning woman with newfound respect.

A student's tribute? Preposterous!

The level of detail compressed into the jade surface required masterful skill. From even a modest distance, one might mistake it for Fairchild's own work.

Who was this remarkable woman? Could she be Fairchild's secret protégé?

Admiring gazes followed Evelyn while Penelope Whitmore and Cassandra appeared as though they'd swallowed something unpleasant. "Since leaving our family, Evelyn has transformed completely. She's become unstoppable!"

"My precious girl, you are this old man's greatest treasure!" Reginald clung to Evelyn's hand joyfully.

"To have such a wife - what more could any man desire?" Julian Montgomery sighed dreamily.

Nathan shot him a warning glare. Wife? She's not yours!

His burning gaze returned to Evelyn, now the radiant center of admiration. Yet with each triumph, Nathan felt the gulf between them widening - though they'd shared three years as husband and wife.
###Chapter 183

Nathan Blackwood was seething with rage, his emotions a turbulent storm of betrayal and frustration.

Once again, this woman had played him for a fool!

The birthday celebration continued without interruption in the grand ballroom.

Evelyn Carter excused herself to freshen up, leaving the opulent dining table behind.

As she walked through the winding corridors, she reflected on Victoria Sterling and Penelope Whitmore's pathetic attempts to undermine her.

Their amateurish schemes were laughable - did they truly believe such transparent tactics could topple her?

Evelyn had anticipated every move they might make. What they failed to comprehend was the depth of Reginald Blackwood's affection for her.

His love formed an impenetrable fortress around her heart.

Knowing Sebastian Kingsley's presence required an additional gift, Evelyn had prepared a jade sculpture crafted with her own hands.

Her exceptional skill came from childhood years spent observing Walter Grayson at work in his stone workshop.

In many ways, the late Edmund Fairchild could be considered her mentor.

The mansion's labyrinthine corridors confused Evelyn, and soon she found herself disoriented.

A plump tabby cat darted past her feet.

"Where are you off to, little one?"

Evelyn chuckled and followed the feline's path.

Just as she caught up, her stiletto heel caught between uneven cobblestones, sending her stumbling forward.

Her eyes squeezed shut as she braced for impact.

Strong arms encircled her waist from behind, halting her fall with effortless strength.

The familiar scent of sandalwood and mint surrounded her as her back pressed against a solid chest.

"Meow!"

The cat vanished over a stone wall as quickly as it had appeared.

Evelyn kept her eyes closed, exhaling shakily.

Nathan could feel the rapid pulse at her wrist where his fingers brushed her skin.

Desire flared uncontrollably within him.

His grip tightened momentarily before he forced himself to release her.

"Let me go!" Evelyn bit her lip, twisting in his embrace.

Nathan's dark eyes burned with restrained passion as his hands lingered on her slender frame before finally stepping back.

"Don't flatter yourself," he growled. "I was preventing an accident."

She scoffed, steadying herself against a pillar. "I'd rather faceplant than have you touch me."

The setting sun painted Evelyn's delicate features in golden light, making Nathan's breath catch.

"Take advantage?" His lips curled in a dangerous smile. "If I wanted that, would I have waited until now?"

"Nathan!" Her almond eyes flashed with fury.

"Weren't you the one begging for my attention before?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "The divorce didn't erase my memory."

The reminder of her past vulnerability made Evelyn's cheeks burn.

She tilted her chin defiantly. "Regretting your choices now that you can't have me?"

"Evelyn, you—"

"Mr. Blackwood," she interrupted coldly, "that ship has sailed. You'll never get what you once threw away."

Something snapped in Nathan. Crimson rage clouded his vision as he seized her wrists, pinning her against the stone pillar.
###Chapter 184

"Ugh!"

Evelyn's back slammed against the cold marble pillar, the impact sending sharp pain through her spine. She gasped, her voice laced with fury. "Nathan! Have you lost your damn mind?"

Nathan's grip on her wrist tightened like a vice, his knuckles turning white. His breathing came in ragged bursts, his usually composed features twisted with barely contained rage.

Their faces were so close she could count the dark lashes framing his stormy eyes. The scent of his expensive cologne mixed with the faint metallic tang of anger.

"You lied to me again, Evelyn." His voice was dangerously low, each word dripping with accusation. "Any man would lose control after being deceived like this."

Evelyn's laughter was bitter as she struggled against his hold. "What exactly did I lie about this time, Your Highness?"

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. "Everything you don't know about me isn't because I kept secrets - it's because you never bothered to ask! Three years, Nathan. Three years as your wife, and you never once cared to know me."

Nathan flinched as if struck. His pulse pounded visibly at his throat.

"Do you know my favorite color? The music that makes me dance? The places that make me feel alive?" Her voice cracked. "I could recite your entire schedule, your allergies, even how you take your coffee. But me? I was just furniture in your perfect life."

The truth of her words hit Nathan like physical blows. Shame colored his aristocratic features pale.

"Don't pretend this is about deception," Evelyn continued, her voice trembling. "I was that book gathering dust on your shelf, praying you'd finally pick me up. But you only noticed me when it was time to throw me away."

Abandonment? The word echoed in Nathan's mind. Had he really...?

His hands shook as memories surfaced - Evelyn's tear-streaked face when he'd forced the divorce papers on her. The way her slender fingers had trembled holding the pen.

"Your indifference killed every last bit of love I had," she whispered. "Now I feel nothing for you. Nothing at all."

Nathan's breath hitched. "Liar." His voice was raw. "You're still mine, Evelyn. This act with Sebastian - it's just to punish me, isn't it?"

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "Delusional much? Get your head examined, Nathan. Sebastian makes me happy - something you never could."

Nathan's grip shifted to her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Happy?" he sneered. "You'd give yourself to a man you don't love just to spite me?"

A slow, cruel smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Seeing you upset is just a bonus. With him, I'm free. With you? I was in a gilded cage." She tilted her head. "Honestly, you're not worth the effort of revenge."

"You mercenary little-" Nathan's voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "Marrying you was the worst mistake of my life."

The words hung between them like a guillotine.

Evelyn went utterly still. Her face drained of color, lips parting soundlessly. Thirteen years of love. A near-fatal sacrifice. And she'd been reduced to... a mistake.

Nathan immediately regretted his words. He hadn't meant-

"Mr. Blackwood? Ms. Carter?"

Marcus Underwood's startled voice shattered the moment. Evelyn jerked away, smoothing her dress with trembling hands.

"Marcus," she said, voice artificially bright. "Shouldn't you be with Reginald?"

The older man's sharp eyes noted the tension but tactfully avoided comment. "There's an issue with the banquet arrangements. I came to inform Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn nodded stiffly. "Of course. Don't let me keep you."

As Marcus hurried Nathan away, Evelyn turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching her fractured reflection in the glass. Behind her, the grand ballroom glittered with false cheer, a perfect backdrop for her shattered heart.
###Chapter 185

Marcus Underwood knew how much Reginald Blackwood adored opera performances. He'd invested a small fortune to secure a renowned prima donna for tonight's gala. But her assistant just informed me the singer has severe food poisoning and can't perform!

Marcus paced anxiously. What now? We constructed this elaborate stage specifically for her act. Without the performance, Reginald will be devastated, and our guests will mock the Blackwood family's incompetence.

No, they won't.

Evelyn Carter appeared, her composed smile radiating quiet confidence. "Relax, Marcus. I won't let our family become tonight's entertainment."

Our family. Nathan Blackwood's chest tightened at her words.

Though their divorce wasn't finalized, they were no longer married. Yet Evelyn still defended the Blackwood name as fiercely as ever, solving their crises like she always had.

All to ensure Reginald's eightieth birthday celebration remained perfect.

"Ms. Carter, what's your plan?" Marcus brightened immediately at her assurance.

"Take me backstage, Marcus."

With that, Evelyn left Nathan standing there, following Marcus toward the performance area.

Nathan watched her retreating figure, fists clenching helplessly. The memory of her tear-filled eyes earlier made his breath catch painfully.

In the garden, an ornate stage stood decorated with theatrical props.

Guests below chatted merrily, offering birthday toasts to the patriarch.

Reginald basked in his family's presence, having invited Sebastian Kingsley and Julian Montgomery to his table. Their empty seats were quickly claimed.

Only Victoria Sterling remained isolated at a guest table - a deliberate snub confirming her outsider status in the Blackwood circle.

Victoria sat rigid with fury, her manicured nails digging into her palms. The humiliation burned like acid.

Her phone vibrated with a message from Penelope Whitmore.

[Opportunities aren't given - they're taken. Keep waiting and you'll remain the joke everyone pities.]

A joke? Never! Victoria's grip tightened on her phone, her perfectly arched brows drawing together in venomous determination.

Tonight, Evelyn would pay tenfold for every humiliation she'd inflicted.

"Where are Nathan and Evelyn?" Reginald scanned the crowd, frowning at his favorite couple's absence.

As he spoke, Nathan reappeared, his stormy expression making Julian recoil instinctively. His friend radiated such chilling intensity he might as well have returned from the underworld.

"Nathan, where's Evelyn?"

Reginald's displeasure grew. "Have you lost your wife? This negligence is unacceptable!"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, too emotionally tangled to respond.

"Mr. Blackwood, perhaps Evelyn got lost in the estate. I'll go find her." Sebastian began rising when Nathan's icy voice cut through.

"Unnecessary, Mr. Kingsley. You're equally unfamiliar here and might get lost yourself. I know exactly where my wife is."

Julian nearly choked on his wine. The tension between the two formidable men crackled like static.

Sebastian's usually warm eyes frosted over momentarily.

Just then, music swelled as the crimson stage curtains parted.

Conversations died as all attention turned toward the stage.

A breathtaking figure in elaborate costume glided gracefully to center stage.

Nathan studied the performer, struck by her haunting familiarity.

Marcus reappeared at Reginald's side.

"The performance is starting! Where's Evelyn?" The opera enthusiast found himself distracted without his beloved granddaughter-in-law present.

"Sir, Ms. Carter is right there."

Marcus gestured toward the stage with a proud smile. "Look closely - isn't that her?"

Gasps rippled through the audience.

Nathan shot to his feet, startling everyone.

His chest heaved violently as he stared transfixed at the vision before him. His heart stuttered as if struck by lightning.
###Chapter 186

Evelyn's flawless features were accentuated by theatrical makeup that perfectly complemented her costume. With deliberate grace, she turned to face the audience, her slender frame moving like liquid poetry. Those mesmerizing feline eyes held the entire room captive.

Her performance was nothing short of magical - every note, every movement casting a spell over the glittering crowd.

Nathan's gaze remained transfixed, an unreadable emotion flickering in his dark eyes. The distance between them felt like centuries, like he'd need to cross dimensions of time and emotion to reach the radiant woman commanding the stage.

Each subtle expression that crossed Evelyn's face sent Nathan's world tilting off its axis.

"Evelyn? Could that truly be Evelyn?!"

Reginald nearly leaped from his seat, fingers digging into the armrests. "Yes! That's my dear Evelyn! Look at those delicate features - that's my girl!"

The mention of her delicate features made Nathan slump back suddenly, his temples throbbing with sudden pain. Memories flickered at the edges of his consciousness like half-remembered dreams.

"Nathan? Are you unwell?" Julian noticed his friend's pallor and leaned in with concern.

"It's nothing." Nathan massaged his temples as fragments of the past surfaced. Why did Evelyn's name trigger such visceral recognition? As if their souls had met long before their lives intersected.

Reginald requested "O mio babbino caro" - Evelyn's signature piece.

In happier times, Evelyn would visit Reginald with costume trunks, performing short arias to lift his spirits. She still remembered how the old man had wept openly when she first sang for him, transported back to cherished moments with his beloved Margaret.

Margaret Blackwood had been a legendary prima donna, with Reginald as her most devoted admirer. Their love story defied aristocratic conventions, becoming the stuff of legend - exactly the kind of love Evelyn had once dreamed of.

Until Nathan handed her those divorce papers, shattering her illusions. Only then did she understand their love story was never meant to be.

The audience fell silent, captivated by the performance.

"Isn't that Mr. Blackwood's former wife? Such remarkable talent!"

"In this age of shallow pop culture, how rare to find a woman who appreciates true artistry!"

"Former wife? She's clearly moved on with Mr. Kingsley now!"

"Did you see how Mr. Blackwood looked at her? That man isn't over her by a long shot!"

"Who could get over someone like that? Even old Mr. Blackwood adores her. She's in another league compared to that counterfeit-loving socialite!"

Victoria overheard the whispers and stormed away, finding refuge in a shadowed alcove where she could nurse her fury and plot revenge.

Penelope kept pushing for immediate action, but Victoria wasn't foolish enough to be anyone's pawn. If caught, she'd lose everything.

No, she needed a disposable weapon - someone like Cassandra Blackwood.

Perfect.

Within minutes, Cassandra came huffing over, her elaborate gown hindering her angry strides.

"That bitch Evelyn! How dare she steal the spotlight again with her pathetic singing!"

Victoria smirked. "Darling, what does it matter if she can sing? Performing is servant's work. Even if she marries well, she'll always be entertainment for people like us."

Earlier humiliation still burned in Victoria's chest, but now she could freely vent her poison.

"You're absolutely right! She's just making a spectacle of herself! That common blood will always show!"

"Cassandra," Victoria lowered her voice conspiratorially, "wouldn't you love to put that upstart in her place?"

"More than anything! I want to tear her apart limb from limb!"

Victoria grasped Cassandra's arm, eyes glittering with malice. "I have a plan, but I can't do it alone..."
###Chapter 187

Victoria's manicured nails dug into Evelyn's wrist. "What way?!"

Glancing over her shoulder, Victoria withdrew two crystal vials from her clutch. The liquid inside shimmered under the chandelier light.

Cassandra frowned. "What is that?"

"A little... persuasion." Victoria's lips curled. "Strong enough to make a man forget his own name. Perfect for a social climber like Evelyn who can't keep her hands off married men."

Cassandra's gasp echoed. Victoria clamped a hand over her mouth. "Quiet, you idiot!"

"You—you want to drug Evelyn? At Grandfather's gala?!"

Leaning in, Victoria's whisper dripped venom. "Imagine the scandal when the entire Blackwood family finds Evelyn in bed with Sebastian Kingsley tonight. That pretty reputation of hers? Gone. Nathan will never look at her again after such humiliation. And Julian Montgomery?" She smirked. "Do you really think he'd want used goods?"

Cassandra's throat tightened. She'd always tormented Evelyn openly—never like this. If they got caught...

"Relax." Victoria flicked her hair. "With this crowd? No one will suspect us. You handle Sebastian's drink. I'll take care of Evelyn. Unless..." She arched a brow. "You enjoy watching Julian fawn over her?"

The barb struck true. Cassandra's cheeks burned with shame.

"Eliminate the competition, or stay pathetic forever. Your choice."

Victoria had learned from the best—Penelope Whitmore's manipulations were legendary.

Cassandra gave a stiff nod.

Onstage, Evelyn's soprano voice soared through Puccini's aria. The guests sat spellbound.

Julian's champagne flute hung forgotten in his grip. His gaze clung to Evelyn like a drowning man to driftwood.

Nathan's jaw tightened. The woman singing bore his ex-wife's face, yet felt like a stranger. His tea turned to acid in his throat.

"Such passion," Sebastian murmured, watching his sister. "Almost like a love letter."

Nathan's fingers twitched.

A sudden commotion rippled through the ballroom.

Evelyn's voice faltered.

Her breath seized.

There, parting the crowd like Moses at the Red Sea—Harrison Kingsley in a tailored Tom Ford tuxedo, his security detail clearing a path to the VIP section.

Gasps erupted.

"Is that the Monarch Group chairman?!"

"Harrison Kingsley at a Blackwood event? Hell must've frozen over!"

Evelyn's pulse hammered.

Why was her father here?

Who'd invited the lion into the den?
###Chapter 188

Sebastian's eyes widened in shock as he abruptly rose to greet Harrison.

"Father, what are you doing here?"

His gaze flickered anxiously toward the stage, barely concealed beneath a veneer of calm.

"Why shouldn't I be here when my own son is attending?" Harrison chuckled, then shot a pointed look at Sebastian. "You should have informed me. We could have arrived together."

He turned smoothly to Reginald, flashing a practiced smile. "Master Reginald, it's been too long. You look as vigorous as ever—age seems to favor you."

"Harrison!" Reginald stood immediately, clasping his hand warmly. "Had I known you were coming, I would have welcomed you personally!"

Leonard, Penelope, and their children followed suit, rising in deference.

Nathan studied Harrison with quiet curiosity, his brow furrowing slightly.

He had meticulously reviewed the guest list the night before—not once, but twice. The Kingsleys' names had been conspicuously absent. And judging by Reginald's startled reaction, it was clear the invitation hadn't come from him.

Which meant Leonard had extended it privately.

But why?

"I flew in directly from my meeting and came straight here," Harrison said smoothly, his tone light but deliberate. "Though it seems I'm fashionably late. As penance, I'll take three shots—consider it my apology."

Nathan exhaled sharply, struck by the uncanny resemblance between Harrison and Evelyn.

His chest tightened. Evelyn, how dare you play with my heart like this?

Harrison and Reginald fell into easy conversation, laughing like old friends. No one would guess their families had been locked in a bitter feud for generations.

Yet the tension between Harrison and Leonard was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife.

The guests noticed but wisely held their tongues.

With Harrison's arrival, Julian and Nathan discreetly excused themselves, retreating to a less prominent table.

"Grandfather, Julian and I will give you space," Nathan said with a polite bow.

"Ah, it's been years since I last saw you boys!" Harrison's gaze lingered on Nathan, assessing. "Master Reginald, I hear your grandson is remarrying soon?"

Reginald's expression darkened at the mention of the wedding.

"Chairman Kingsley," Leonard interjected smoothly, "my son is engaged to Victoria Sterling, daughter of Sterling Holdings' chairman. The ceremony is next month—we'll send your invitation shortly."

"Sterling Holdings?" Harrison waved a dismissive hand. "Never heard of them."

Leonard and Penelope stiffened, humiliation flashing across their faces.

"Victoria is my niece," Penelope said tightly. "She and Nathan grew up together."

She bit back further explanation, acutely aware of the Kingsleys' past feud with the Sterlings over substandard furniture exports.

Still, Harrison's blatant disregard rankled. After all, any slight against Victoria reflected on her.

"Ah." Harrison turned back to Reginald as if they hadn't spoken. "Let me toast to your health!"

Leonard and Penelope exchanged frustrated glances.

Harrison couldn't have made it clearer—he didn’t care who Nathan married.

As long as it's not my daughter, Harrison thought smugly. My Evelyn is far too good for him.

Onstage, Evelyn bravely finished the first act of her performance. As she prepared to bow, Harrison's gaze flicked toward her.

Her pulse skyrocketed, heart hammering against her ribs.

Thankfully, the heavy stage makeup and distance obscured her features. Harrison only paused briefly before looking away.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn fled the stage, her costume damp with sweat.

Just then, her phone buzzed—a message from Sebastian.

[Evelyn, Father's here! Stay out of sight. I'll keep watch. Contact me if needed.]

[Understood.]

Harrison turned to Reginald. "Where did you find that opera singer? She was quite talented."

Reginald beamed. "I didn’t hire her—she's my god-granddaughter!"

"Is that so?" Harrison arched a brow. "She must be exceptional for you to claim her."
###Chapter 189

Nathan Blackwood couldn't resist glancing at the stage.

But it was empty.

Evelyn Carter had already slipped away unnoticed. His brows knitted together, his gaze darkening with unreadable emotions.

Meanwhile, servants bustled in and out of the pantry.

A maid, bribed by Cassandra Blackwood, darted inside when no one was looking.

She avoided the security cameras, pulled out two vials of the drug Cassandra had given her, and poured them into separate champagne flutes before topping them off.

"One for Mr. Sebastian Kingsley, and the other for Mr. Julian Montgomery. Make sure Julian drinks his—no mistakes."

That was Cassandra’s command.

Her future wealth depended on this.

Nerves twisted her stomach, and she rushed out to the restroom.

At that moment, a girl in a soft white dress tiptoed into the pantry.

Eleanor Blackwood, who had been absent from the banquet, appeared like a ghost.

Her wide, childlike eyes darted around before she snatched a flute of champagne and downed it in one gulp.

Few knew about Eleanor’s secret habit—she loved alcohol and often sneaked into the wine cellar at night. Tonight was no exception.

"Mmm... Burp! Delicious!" She licked her lips, satisfied, then refilled the glass to hide the theft before scurrying away like a startled rabbit.

Ever since Harrison Kingsley had made his unexpected appearance, Evelyn had vanished from sight.

The banquet table overflowed with delicacies, but Nathan had no appetite. His gaze swept the hall restlessly.

"Come, Mr. Kingsley. A toast!"

Julian raised his glass toward Sebastian, his charming eyes shadowed with conflicting emotions. "You’re fortunate to have someone as extraordinary as Evelyn. Treat her well—love her like a queen. Never let her shed a tear."

Sebastian smirked, lifting his own glass. "Of course. She’ll want for nothing."

Julian’s throat tightened. He pulled a business card from his pocket and handed it to Sebastian.

"My number. In case you ever... change your mind."

Sebastian arched a brow. "Mr. Montgomery, I know who you are."

"But you don’t know this—I love her too." Julian’s confession was blunt, his gaze unwavering.

Nathan’s grip on his glass tightened.

Sebastian’s expression didn’t flicker. "Oh?"

"Love is fickle. If you ever stop deserving her, call me. I’ll be there before you hang up." Julian’s intensity left no room for doubt.

Sebastian chuckled. "Your concern is touching, but unnecessary."

Nathan couldn’t take another second. He stood abruptly and stalked away, jaw clenched.

Their words about his ex-wife—though never naming him—felt like knives twisting in his chest.

Just outside the hall, Victoria Sterling flung herself into his arms.

"Nathan!"

Then, from the corner of his eye—he saw her.

Evelyn.

His breath hitched.

Seizing the moment, Victoria pressed her lips to the corner of his mouth.

Evelyn turned—and froze.

Their eyes met for a heartbeat before she walked away as if she hadn’t seen a thing.

A sharp pain lanced through Nathan’s chest. He shoved Victoria back without thinking, sending her stumbling.

"Nathan! How could you—?"

He wiped the lipstick from his mouth, disgusted. "I don’t like being ambushed."
###Chapter 190

Evelyn's thoughts raced. Harassed?! After all the times I've thrown myself at him, he dares to accuse me of harassment?!

"Nathan, I'm your fiancée!" Evelyn's eyes instantly welled up with tears, her voice trembling with hurt. "How could you say such a thing?"

"Nathan took a deliberate breath, his gaze turning frosty. "Evelyn, you know how much I despise excessive physical intimacy."

"Yes, I know. I've always known."

The childhood trauma had left Nathan emotionally scarred, making it impossible for him to form normal romantic connections or express desire like other men. Evelyn understood his struggles.

Otherwise, a man of his caliber would have moved on during their three-year separation.

"But since our reunion, you've conveniently forgotten this." Nathan clenched his fists, remembering the accusatory look in Victoria's eyes.

Unfamiliar emotions churned within him - guilt, confusion, frustration. These were sensations he'd never experienced before, leaving him utterly disoriented.

"But Nathan, we're getting married soon!" Evelyn stepped forward aggressively, her voice rising hysterically. "We're not children anymore! We can't maintain this platonic relationship forever! I'll share your bed, bear your children!"

Nathan instinctively retreated, his breath hitching.

Marrying Evelyn had always been his goal. So why did impending matrimony fill him with dread rather than joy?

Suddenly, the door burst open again.

Sebastian stumbled out from the banquet hall, his unsteady gait suggesting intoxication as he passed them.

Evelyn hid behind Nathan, her lips curling into a sinister smirk.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had changed from her performance attire and removed her stage makeup when a maid rushed to her backstage.

"Ms. Carter! Something's wrong!"

The maid whispered urgently, "Mr. Kingsley isn't feeling well - he's resting in the guest suite. He seems quite uncomfortable."

Alarmed about her eldest brother's condition, Evelyn immediately responded, "Take me to him!"

With both Nathan and Sebastian absent from their table, Julian found himself bored and alone. He wandered into the moonlit gardens.

The tranquil nightscape sparkled with stars, the gentle babbling of Starlight River flowing beneath an arched bridge. Antique lanterns cast warm golden glows across the foliage.

Beyond the cicadas' chorus, Julian detected rustling in the shrubbery.

"Who's there?" he called sharply.

Only insect sounds answered. Assuming it was just wildlife, he turned to leave when a faint moan stopped him.

Julian's pulse quickened as he cautiously approached the disturbance. His steps lightened, his throat tightening with each advance.

"Show yourself!" he demanded, pushing through the foliage.

His breath caught. "Eleanor?! What are you doing here?"

"I... I don't know what's happening to me..."

"Are you ill? You can't stay hidden like this!"

As Julian reached for her arm, an electric jolt shot through him at the contact. Eleanor's skin burned feverishly.

"Help me..." Her voice slurred as consciousness wavered.

Before Julian could react, Eleanor suddenly pressed against him, her warm breath ghosting over his lips as she clung desperately.

"Eleanor! Stop this! My heart belongs to someone else!"

Her response was to capture his mouth in a searing kiss.

Elsewhere, Cassandra paced anxiously, unable to locate Julian. She hadn't informed Victoria about drugging Julian's drink.

Her plan was simple - seduce Julian, then leverage her family's influence to force marriage negotiations with the Montgomerys.

But where had he disappeared?

"Ms. Blackwood!" A maid scurried to her side.

"Is it done?" Cassandra whispered, glancing around furtively.

"Everything's prepared. I personally escorted Mr. Kingsley to the suite and led Ms. Carter there."

Cassandra smirked triumphantly. "What about Mr. Montgomery? Any sightings?"

"I... haven't seen him..."

"You're certain he drank the champagne?" Cassandra pressed urgently.

"Absolutely! I watched both gentlemen consume it. If Mr. Kingsley is affected, Mr. Montgomery should be experiencing similar symptoms."

Cassandra's phone vibrated with Victoria's call. She answered immediately.

"Brilliant work, Cassandra! Now we just wait for the fireworks!" Victoria's smug voice declared.
###Chapter 191

Evelyn stood frozen in the vast emptiness of the silent living room.

Her trembling fingers found the light switch as she called out desperately, "Sebastian? Are you home?"

A faint rustling sound came from the bedroom.

Her pulse quickened. She rushed forward, voice cracking with worry. "Sebastian! Answer me! Are you ill?"

"Evelyn...don't..." Sebastian's voice came out strangled, his breathing ragged.

"Sebastian! What's happening?"

All color drained from Evelyn's face. As she moved to enter, the door burst open.

In the dim glow, Sebastian appeared drenched from head to toe, as though emerging from the ocean. His chiseled features burned crimson.

The suit jacket lay discarded, leaving only a soaked white shirt plastered to his sculpted torso. The fabric gaped open, revealing inflamed skin beneath. His entire body seemed to pulse with unnatural heat.

"Sebastian, you're—"

"Drugged."

His vision swam, Evelyn's form blurring before him. "Cold showers...ice baths...nothing helps. The dosage is too strong."

"This can't be!" Fury and panic warred within Evelyn.

Though a surgical prodigy who'd performed brain operations, she stood helpless before her brother's chemically-induced torment.

"Evelyn...it's a setup." Each word cost him dearly. "Lock me in...I'll endure this alone."

His breathing grew more labored, eyes now fully bloodshot.

Evelyn's mind raced. Every second endangered him further.

"I won't abandon you!" Her voice broke. "The car's waiting—we're going to the hospital now!"

Never had she seen Sebastian in such agony. Tears pricked her eyes as she reached for him.

A deafening crash shattered the moment.

Sebastian had hurled a vase against the doorframe.

Then, with terrifying deliberation, he seized a glass shard and clenched it in his fist. Blood welled between his fingers as he maintained the pressure, seemingly drawing strength from the pain.

"Sebastian!" Evelyn's heart fractured at the sight.

This was his last defense—self-harm to protect her.

"Please...go!" he begged.

When she hesitated, his lust-darkened eyes met hers with finality. "GET OUT!"

Meanwhile, in the banquet hall's golden glow...

Harrison engaged Reginald Blackwood in animated conversation at the head table. Nearby sycophants kept their distance.

Harrison's imperial presence—like some ancient monarch—rendered lesser men unworthy to approach.

Wine-loosened, Reginald beckoned younger guests to join them.

Marcus Underwood escorted Nathan Blackwood and Cassandra Blackwood to the prestigious seats.

"Harrison, what say you about my grandson?" Reginald nudged playfully.

A faint smile touched Harrison's lips. "Reginald, your grandson eclipses even your legendary self."

Leonard Blackwood coughed discreetly, baffled by this blunt assessment from a man who'd built a financial empire.

As Leonard's son, Nathan should have been praised for inheriting fine genes. Yet Harrison implied generational superiority.

"Ha! The boy's not half the man I was at his age!" Reginald boasted. "Though admittedly stubborn as a mule—won't heed a word of my advice!"

Nathan sipped tea, his expression glacial.

"Father, you underestimate Nathan," Leonard interjected, aiming to one-up Harrison. "Under his leadership, Blackwood Industries has seen unprecedented growth—far outpacing competitors."

"Pah! That's baseline competence!" Reginald scoffed, never missing a chance to belittle his son. "If he couldn't manage that much, I'd replace him with someone who could!"

Harrison's gaze sharpened. "Reginald, Nathan's reforms have made Blackwood Industries a Crestview powerhouse in mere years. He's set the standard for young executives."

The unspoken truth hung between them—Reginald's criticisms were inverted pride. His grandson had exceeded all expectations.

"Harrison, you seem quite taken with Nathan!" Reginald's eyes twinkled mischievously. "Shall we discuss merging our families?"
###Chapter 192

The room fell into stunned silence at Reginald's outrageous suggestion.

Nathan's face darkened instantly, his fingers tightening around the porcelain teacup. "Grandfather, this isn't amusing."

Harrison Kingsley nearly choked on his Earl Grey tea, while Leonard Blackwood and Penelope Whitmore exchanged shocked glances.

Cassandra Blackwood hid a smirk behind her hand, thoroughly enjoying the unfolding drama.

"Harrison, if I recall correctly, you have three daughters?" Reginald continued, undeterred. "Has your family grown in recent years?"

"Still just the three girls," Harrison replied stiffly. "Nine children are quite enough for any man. I've no intention of expanding our household further."

Reginald stroked his chin thoughtfully. "And their marital statuses?"

"My sixth daughter, Cassandra, is happily married and living abroad. Arabella is still in university - far too young for such considerations." Harrison's tone turned protective. "And then there's my Evelyn."

At the mention of Evelyn's name, Nathan's hand jerked, nearly spilling his tea. His jaw clenched visibly.

"Ah yes, Evelyn! I remember her as a delightful child," Reginald beamed. "She must be... twenty-four now? Unmarried, I presume?"

"Not yet," Harrison confirmed, his eyes narrowing suspiciously.

"Then what do you think of Nathan as a potential son-in-law?"

Harrison's teacup clattered against its saucer. The audacity! As if he'd ever let his precious Evelyn marry into this dysfunctional family. The mere thought made his blood boil.

"Grandfather, I'm already engaged," Nathan ground out, his voice dripping with barely contained fury. "Even if I weren't, Evelyn Kingsley would be the last woman I'd consider."

Harrison's face darkened like a thundercloud. "Young man, are you implying my daughter isn't good enough for you?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "Evelyn is the jewel of our family. When the Prime Minister's son and the Duke of Westminster came courting, I found them lacking. What makes you think you have the right to dismiss her so casually?"

The tension in the room became palpable. If not for Reginald's presence, Harrison might have thrown Nathan out the window.

"Miss Kingsley is undoubtedly accomplished," Nathan conceded coldly. "We've had business dealings. She's intelligent, driven, exceptional in every way." His dark eyes flashed. "But our personalities are fundamentally incompatible. No amount of forced proximity could change that. Should our paths cross, I'm certain we'd make excellent business associates - nothing more."

Harrison's expression softened slightly at the compliments to his daughter.

"Why wait for chance encounters?" Reginald clapped his hands together. "Let's arrange a meeting! Tomorrow, next week - whenever suits. Perhaps this 'incompatibility' isn't as insurmountable as you believe!" The old man's grin widened. "Consider it settled!"

Nathan's handsome features twisted in displeasure. The old fox was clearly trying to sabotage his engagement to Victoria by playing matchmaker blindfolded!

Penelope finally intervened. "Father, with all due respect, Nathan is practically betrothed to Victoria. Wouldn't this be inappropriate timing?"

"Practically isn't legally," Reginald countered, his smile vanishing. His piercing gaze silenced further objections. "Marriage contracts are like business negotiations - until the ink dries, everything remains negotiable!"

"But the engagement announcement has already been made," Penelope pressed. "Any last-minute changes would reflect poorly on Miss Kingsley's reputation."

Leonard quickly pulled his wife aside before she could provoke Reginald further.

The old patriarch's face turned crimson. A coughing fit wracked his frail frame, each hack more violent than the last.

Harrison sipped his tea impassively. What a circus! No sane father would subject his daughter to this vipers' nest.

"Get away from me!" Reginald wheezed between coughs. "Where's Evelyn? I want Evelyn!"

The old man gasped like a fish out of water. Evelyn had become his oxygen - without her calming presence, he could barely function.

"Come to think of it," Cassandra mused with feigned concern, "where has Miss Carter disappeared to?" Her lips curled in a secret, malicious smile.

As if on cue, Victoria Sterling glided into the room, her timing suspiciously perfect.

"Victoria dear," Cassandra called sweetly, "have you seen Evelyn? Grandfather's asking for her."

Victoria twisted her fingers nervously. "I... I did see her earlier." Her eyes darted about anxiously. "But I'm not sure I should say..."
###Chapter 193

Victoria's shifting expression made Nathan tense. His fingers curled into fists. "What's wrong? What happened to Evelyn?!"

Sebastian's chest tightened painfully.

"Evelyn, just tell us directly. We're all family here." Penelope's icy gaze bore into her.

"I was strolling through the gardens when I accidentally saw Ms. Carter and Mr. Kingsley entering the same suite." Victoria blinked innocently. "Mr. Kingsley appeared quite intoxicated, so I assumed Ms. Carter was assisting him."

She added hastily, "At first I was concerned, but since they're officially dating, there shouldn't be any issue with them sharing a room, right?"

Nathan's entire body went rigid. His knuckles turned white from how hard he was clenching them.

Harrison shot up from his seat, bewildered. "Who did you say my son was with? Evelyn Carter? Who is she?!"

Victoria's eyes darted nervously toward Nathan.

Blood roared in Nathan's ears. Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed out, leaving stunned silence in his wake.

A triumphant smirk played on Victoria's lips. Evelyn, this time I'll make sure your reputation is destroyed beyond repair. I'll force Nathan to see you for the scheming slut you truly are.

"Someone explain who this woman is!" Harrison demanded, veins bulging at his temples.

He'd groomed his eldest son for greatness since childhood. How dare some gold-digging harlot set her sights on his heir?

"Oh dear! You really don't know her, Chairman Kingsley?" Penelope feigned shock. "Your son and Evelyn made their relationship public earlier at the birthday gala. During the charity auction, I noticed how close Lillian and Evelyn were. Naturally, I assumed you'd met her already."

"What? Lillian knows her too?!" Harrison's face darkened alarmingly. His jaw worked furiously.

That cunning witch! First she seduces my son, then worms her way into my wife's good graces? Just who does she think she is?

"Enough!" Reginald interjected sharply. He'd always been fond of Evelyn and wouldn't tolerate Penelope's poisonous insinuations. "Whatever exists between Evelyn and Sebastian is their private affair. There's no need for this discussion."

"With all due respect, Father, it's not that simple." Penelope's eyes gleamed dangerously. She cleared her throat delicately. "Legally speaking, Evelyn is still part of our family since she and Nathan haven't finalized their divorce. We respected your wishes by waiting until your birthday to announce Nathan and Victoria's engagement. They've endured so much humiliation for your sake - especially poor Victoria, suffering silently while Evelyn flaunts herself shamelessly. And now, at your celebration of all places! If this scandal breaks, our family will become the laughingstock of high society!"

Victoria and Cassandra exchanged smug glances, barely concealing their glee.

Harrison looked like he'd been struck by lightning. His mind reeled.

His son - the thirty-year-old confirmed bachelor, the man who'd shown less interest in women than in his morning coffee - had fallen for his brother-in-law's soon-to-be ex-wife?

Had the boy taken a vow of celibacy only to develop some bizarre fetish for married women?

The disgrace!

Nathan sprinted down the endless corridor like a man possessed.

The unflappable business magnate, the epitome of aristocratic composure, now ran with the desperation of a man chasing his last hope.

The mere thought of Evelyn in Sebastian's arms had shattered his legendary self-control.

He needed to stop this. To drag her away from that man's touch at any cost.

Evelyn, I won't let him have you!

When he reached the suite, Nathan's shirt clung to his sweat-drenched back. His breathing came in ragged gasps, his vision tinged red.

What if he was too late? What if they'd already... How far had things gone between them?

The mental images lanced through him like white-hot knives. Teeth gritted, he raised a shaking fist to pound on the door - just as it swung open.

There stood Evelyn, supporting a disheveled Sebastian. Both froze at the sight of him.

Nathan's arm hung suspended mid-air. His lips trembled violently. "Why... are you here?"

Evelyn's heart clenched painfully at his appearance. She forced a mocking laugh. "Word travels fast, I see. Couldn't resist coming to witness the scandal firsthand?"

"Did he touch you?" Nathan's voice was raw, his face ashen.

"None of your business." She shoved past him, Sebastian's weight making her stagger. "Move."

Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as she struggled down the corridor, desperate to get her brother medical attention.
###Chapter 194

Nathan refused to let go. His fingers dug into Evelyn's slender wrist, leaving angry crimson imprints on her porcelain skin.

What burned brighter than those marks were his bloodshot eyes, dark with possessive fury. "Did he touch you, Evelyn? Answer me!"

"Mr. Kingsley was drugged at your party!" Evelyn shot back, her emerald eyes blazing with contempt.

Nathan recoiled as if struck. "What did you say?"

"I've stabilized him temporarily, but without knowing the substance, we need immediate bloodwork at Kingsley Medical Center!"

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she wrenched free from Nathan's grasp. "I don't have time for your petty games, Nathan. If anything happens to Sebastian, I swear I'll make you all pay! This ends tonight!"

Her words were daggers twisting in Nathan's chest, severing something vital between them.

Shame burned his cheeks. She'd never defied him like this before - never fought for another man with such ferocious beauty.

"Evelyn! Come back!" His voice cracked with desperation.

But she was already turning away, supporting Sebastian's limp form.

Suddenly, hurried footsteps echoed through the hall.

"Evelyn! Evelyn!"

Reginald Blackwood's panicked voice cut through the tension.

Evelyn froze. Slowly, she turned with Sebastian's arm draped over her shoulders.

Then all color drained from her face.

Standing beside the Blackwoods was her father, Harrison Kingsley.

Harrison's sharp intake of breath was audible. He rubbed his eyes violently, certain he was hallucinating.

Evelyn's throat closed. No sound emerged.

Guilt and terror crashed over her like a tidal wave, each wave more suffocating than the last.

"Chairman Kingsley, Grandfather, Nathan - look at her!" Victoria seized the moment, stepping forward with venomous triumph. "Ms. Carter humiliates both families! Nathan promised the divorce after Grandfather's birthday. Couldn't she wait out of respect? As Nathan's fiancée, I've endured countless slights for family harmony. Yet she throws herself at your son before the ink dries? Chairman Kingsley, would you really let this shameless woman tarnish Sebastian's reputation?"

"Victoria!" Nathan's roar shook the chandeliers.

Victoria flinched but held her ground. The damage was done.

"Evelyn...you and Sebastian?" Reginald gaped at the scene, at a loss.

Leonard Blackwood shook his head in disgust. His son had dodged a bullet divorcing this disgrace.

"Youthful passions, I suppose," Penelope sighed theatrically. "Thank heavens only family witnessed this scandal."

"Evelyn. Come here."

Harrison's commanding voice cut through the murmurs. Everyone froze.

Who was he addressing?

Then Evelyn stepped forward mechanically, cheeks flaming. She swallowed hard before whispering, "Dad..."
###Chapter 195

Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper, yet it struck like lightning through the crowded room.

N?vel/Dr(a)ma.Org - Content owner.

Reginald and Leonard stood frozen, their mouths agape in disbelief.

Victoria felt an icy chill crawl up her spine. Her face turned ghostly pale. Penelope and Cassandra weren't faring much better either.

Who could have imagined that Nathan's meek ex-wife - the country bumpkin everyone looked down upon - was actually Harrison Kingsley's daughter and heiress to Monarch Group?

"Mother... is this true? That wench-"

Cassandra tugged timidly at Penelope's sleeve, only to be shaken off violently. "Silence!"

Nathan stood rooted to the spot, his mind reeling. A storm of emotions raged within him - shock, confusion, and something dangerously close to regret.

How was it possible? The woman who had dutifully cared for his grandfather as a nurse... the wife who endured three years of his neglect... was actually Harrison Kingsley's hidden princess?

Drawing a shuddering breath, Nathan stepped forward. His crimson-rimmed eyes burned into Evelyn's familiar yet suddenly foreign features.

Evelyn pressed her lips together and averted her gaze. Guilt and irritation warred within her, making it impossible to meet his piercing stare.

"Is this really you?" Nathan's voice came out rough, scraped raw by emotion.

"Yes." Evelyn's reply was crisp. Her eyes glittered like frost.

"So you were the one who opposed the Sterling family before. You made me climb ten floors-"

"Mr. Blackwood, let's not revisit ancient history." Evelyn cut him off coldly. "I'm Evelyn Kingsley - General Manager of Monarch Grand Hotels and Harrison Kingsley's daughter. Everything I did was for the hotel's interests, not personal vendettas. As for why I used a stand-in during our divorce proceedings..." Her lips twisted wryly. "I believe you can deduce the reason. I concealed my identity to avoid complications. We were ending things amicably - no need for dramatic confrontations."

She paused, her lashes casting shadows over her downcast eyes. "I did lie to you about this. For that, I'm truly sorry."

The deception was monumental - far greater than all her previous white lies combined.

Yet to Nathan's own surprise, fury didn't consume him.

Instead of anger, he burned with questions.

Why would a billionaire heiress willingly become his grandfather's nurse? Why marry him knowing he didn't love her? What could possibly explain her three years of silent suffering?

"So you... Sebastian and Dominic..."

"They're my full-blooded brothers."

Having delivered her explanation, Evelyn turned on her heel toward Harrison without another glance.

Nathan inhaled sharply. His chest constricted as if crushed by invisible weights.

At that moment, Theodore came rushing in, having heard the commotion. His eyes widened comically at the sight of Harrison and Evelyn together before comprehension dawned.

"Chairman Kingsley. Ms. Evelyn."

"Theodore, support Sebastian. He's in no state to walk alone."

Though Harrison's rage threatened to erupt, he maintained his composure for propriety's sake. There would be time to deal with his wayward daughter later.

Theodore immediately moved to brace Sebastian's waist. When Nathan stepped forward to help, Evelyn blocked him with an icy glare.

"That won't be necessary, Mr. Blackwood. We can manage."

Nathan's arms hung suspended awkwardly midair before dropping to his sides.

Evelyn turned to Theodore with military precision. "Contact Kingsley Medical Center. Inform them Sebastian may require gastric lavage."

"Gastric lavage? But he's just drunk-"

"Sebastian isn't drunk."

Evelyn's sharp gaze swept across the Blackwoods like a blade. "His symptoms clearly indicate he's been drugged!"

Gasps erupted through the crowd.

The three scheming women paled visibly, Cassandra's legs trembling beneath her voluminous skirts.

Harrison's aristocratic features hardened into glacial fury.

He'd suspected something amiss from the start. His son possessed an iron tolerance for alcohol - no mere champagne could reduce Sebastian to such a state at Reginald's birthday gala. Now the truth was horrifyingly clear.

Theodore half-carried Sebastian toward the exit as whispers exploded through the ballroom.
###Chapter 196

Reginald's face drained of color, his entire frame shaking with barely contained fury. "Evelyn, explain this to me right now!" His voice cracked like thunder through the grand hall.

Even knowing her true identity as Harrison Kingsley's daughter, the old man couldn't break the habit of calling her by her former name.

"This can't be happening!" Leonard Blackwood's hands clenched into fists, his carefully maintained family reputation crumbling before his eyes. The security at Cliffside Manor was impenetrable - no unauthorized person could possibly enter or leave without detection. "Everyone here tonight is family or close associates. Who would dare commit such a despicable act under my roof? There must be another explanation—perhaps Sebastian had an allergic reaction or—"

"Believe what you want," Evelyn cut in sharply, her chin lifted defiantly. "Kingsley Medical Center runs the most efficient toxicology labs in the state. The truth will be in Sebastian's bloodwork." Her icy gaze swept across the assembled guests. "And since you're so certain no outsider could have done this, does that mean we're looking at a family affair?"

Leonard's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, unable to form a coherent response.

Behind the Blackwood patriarch, Victoria Sterling shrank back, her gauzy dress clinging to her sweat-drenched skin. "It wasn't me," she whispered to herself, nails digging into her palms. "Cassandra did everything. I'm innocent."

Cassandra Blackwood's pulse hammered so violently she feared everyone could hear it. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. She'd drugged Sebastian while Victoria was supposed to deal with Evelyn. Why was only one half of their plan working?

Her venomous glare found Victoria. "You treacherous snake," she seethed silently. "You backed out and left me holding the bag."

"Ms. Carter-Kingsley, these accusations are outrageous!" Penelope Whitmore interjected, desperate to divert attention. "What possible motive would we have to harm you or Mr. Kingsley?"

"Silence!" Reginald roared, making several guests jump. "You will speak when spoken to!"

Penelope's face burned with humiliation, her hatred for the old man growing deeper by the second.

"You may not have wanted to hurt Sebastian," Evelyn said coolly, "but you were willing to use him as collateral damage. This was always about getting to me." Her steady voice carried through the tense silence.

Nathan Blackwood's gaze darkened as he studied Penelope and Cassandra with new suspicion. From the moment Sebastian and Harrison arrived unannounced, something had felt off. Then Penelope had revealed Evelyn's true identity at dinner, followed by the scandalous rumors about Evelyn and Sebastian sharing a room...

The pieces clicked together with terrifying clarity.

"After my performance," Evelyn continued, her voice thick with emotion, "a maid told me Sebastian was ill and resting upstairs. I went to check on him—that's when they made their move." Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. "To protect me, Sebastian cut his own hand with broken glass to stay conscious. They never imagined we were siblings—that their sick plan would backfire so spectacularly."

Harrison Kingsley's expression turned glacial. "Leonard, you will provide answers tonight, or I swear to God—"

"Chairman Kingsley, I assure you there's been some mistake—"

"Don't insult me!" Harrison snapped. "My children were attacked in your home. My son lies unconscious. I don't care if it was your family or the damn gardener—this happened under your roof. The responsibility falls on you!"

Leonard's face purpled with rage. "You're being unreasonable!"

"Unreasonable?" Harrison's laugh held no humor. "Your concern is touching while my son fights whatever poison runs through his veins."

Evelyn's heart swelled seeing her father defend them so fiercely. Despite his flaws, Harrison Kingsley would move heaven and earth for his family.

Victoria's dress clung to her trembling legs, while Cassandra edged backward, calculating her escape.

"Going somewhere, Ms. Blackwood?"

Cassandra nearly screamed as Julian Montgomery materialized beside her, his charming features set in uncharacteristic severity. All eyes turned to see him cradling a sleeping girl with utmost care.

Cassandra's blood ran cold.

The child in Julian's arms was Eleanor Blackwood.
###Chapter 197

Eleanor slept peacefully in Julian's embrace, her delicate fingers clutching his shirt. Her long lashes fluttered like butterfly wings against her porcelain skin. She resembled a celestial being who had descended to earth.

Julian lowered his gaze.

Having been with numerous women, he knew how to control his desires swiftly. When his eyes met Cassandra's again, they were razor-sharp. "Ms. Blackwood, if you leave now, you'll miss the most thrilling part of tonight's show."

"I...I need to use the restroom." Cassandra's forehead glistened with sweat, her pulse racing.

"You can relieve yourself after witnessing this."

Cradling Eleanor protectively, Julian strode toward Evelyn and Nathan with deliberate calm.

As he passed Cassandra, her eyes widened at the vivid love bites marking his exposed neck!

Her spine stiffened as if electrocuted.

Julian showed no signs of intoxication - so who had left those marks?

Just then, Eleanor whimpered in her sleep, disturbed by some nightmare.

Cassandra's heart plummeted, her vision darkening.

Had Eleanor been drugged? Had she and Julian...?

That imbecile got lucky!

"Eleanor!" Evelyn and Nathan exclaimed simultaneously.

"What's wrong with my granddaughter?" Reginald hadn't seen his youngest granddaughter all evening. Seeing her in Julian's arms made his blood run cold.

Leonard and Penelope exchanged alarmed glances.

"Grandfather, Nathan, don't worry. Eleanor's fine. I'm quite experienced handling situations like this." Julian inhaled deeply.

"Experienced?"

Nathan's brow furrowed dangerously. "Julian, if you used that 'experience' on Eleanor, I'll make you regret it!"

"Tsk! Why do you all treat me like some predator?" Julian cleared his throat, his gaze shifting uncomfortably.

Evelyn's sharp eyes noticed the marks on his neck but remained silent, merely arching an eyebrow.

"Julian! Explain this immediately!" Leonard demanded, his voice tight with concern.

Julian's expression turned glacial. "Eleanor was drugged. I found her unconscious in the garden bushes. The substance had already taken effect, putting her in critical condition. I administered water and medication. She's stable now - just needs rest."

Gasps filled the room. Penelope and Victoria's faces darkened.

Reginald swayed dangerously. "Eleanor too? Father, steady!" Leonard rushed to support Reginald with Marcus' help.

"Grandfather!" Evelyn moved forward in concern.

Harrison sneered, jealousy twisting his features at his daughter's concern for another paternal figure.

The puzzle pieces were falling into place.

Evelyn's piercing gaze alternated between Cassandra and Victoria. "Only Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Blackwood were seated with my brother earlier. Yet only my brother was drugged at that table. The second victim tonight was Eleanor. Presumably, she drank from the glass intended for the person who drugged my brother. An unfortunate case of mistaken consumption."

Nathan and Julian regarded her with admiration.

Her analytical mind had dissected the situation with surgical precision.

"Then who was the intended target? Certainly not Mr. Montgomery - the Blackwoods wouldn't be foolish enough to drug their own guest at their own gala."

All eyes turned to Julian.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his usually charming eyes turning arctic.

He despised underhanded tactics most of all. That someone dared drug him at Reginald's birthday celebration...

The audacity!

"Find the maid involved in this."

Nathan's crimson eyes burned with lethal intent. "Bring her to me. Ms. Carter and I will conduct the interrogation personally. No one leaves this estate until Ms. Carter uncovers the truth!"

Evelyn's breath caught at Nathan's resolute expression.

Their gazes locked, sending electric currents through both their hearts.
###Chapter 198

"Nathan! What is the meaning of this? Are you imprisoning us? Do you take us for criminals?"

Penelope's voice trembled with barely concealed panic. If this continued, their scheme would unravel. She couldn't allow it.

"Aunt Penelope, you are not suspects," Nathan replied, his dark gaze sharper than Leonard's ever was. "I merely require your cooperation in rooting out the filth hiding within these walls."

His tone left no room for argument. "If you've done nothing wrong, there should be no reason for objection."

"Exactly!" Reginald Blackwood's voice boomed with fury. "Such disgraceful behavior will not be tolerated! We will uncover the truth and give Evelyn and Mr. Kingsley the justice they deserve!"

Cassandra's teeth chattered audibly. Penelope clenched her fists, her lips pressed into a thin line.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Oliver Sinclair arrived, flanked by two imposing bodyguards dragging a trembling maid between them.

With a rough shove, they forced her to the floor. Her legs gave out, and she collapsed before the gathered crowd.

"Good timing, sir," Oliver said, handing over a tablet. "I secured the surveillance footage and sealed all exits. Caught this one trying to crawl out through the garden's service gate—like a rat fleeing a sinking ship."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

When had Nathan noticed something amiss? His speed was terrifying.

"Tsk. This is practically a confession," Julian Montgomery muttered, his sharp eyes boring into the maid. "Who in their right mind would resort to such desperate measures unless they were guilty?"

"Oh, we'll interrogate her thoroughly," Nathan said, his voice like ice. "But I'm more interested in the puppet master pulling her strings."

"Mr. Blackwood, please!" The maid sobbed, her face streaked with tears. "My family had an emergency! The doors were locked—I had no choice but to use the garden! I swear, I know nothing!"

"You served the drinks earlier," Julian pointed out.

"And you were the one who suggested I check on Sebastian," Evelyn added coolly.

Oliver tapped the tablet screen. "The footage confirms no one interacted with her between the pantry and the hall. Meaning—"

"—she was the only one who could've tampered with the drinks," Nathan finished.

The maid's face paled. Sweat beaded on her forehead.

"Wait." Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "How did you know the drinks were spiked? We never mentioned that detail."

A deadly silence fell.

"I—I overheard it when I arrived!" the maid stammered.

"Overheard?" Oliver scoffed. "From where? The next county?"

Nathan swiped through the footage, then paused. Evelyn leaned in—only for their foreheads to bump.

A spark. A breathless second.

Nathan's lashes lowered, his gaze searing. Evelyn quickly looked away, her pulse erratic.

On the screen, the maid crouched by a trash bin in the garden, glancing furtively before discarding two small vials.

"Clever," Oliver mused. "She avoided all indoor cameras but missed the one hidden by the ivy."

"No! Those were just painkillers!" the maid wailed. "Not drugs!"

"Oliver," Nathan said, ignoring her. "The evidence?"

"Here."

Oliver produced a sealed bag containing the retrieved vials. Nathan held them up, his jaw tight.

"Residue remains. Have it tested immediately. If it's not painkillers?" His voice dropped. "Hand her to the authorities. Ensure she faces full consequences."

Realizing the game was up, the maid lunged forward, grabbing Nathan's pant leg.

"Please, sir! It wasn't my idea!" She whirled, finger shaking as she pointed at Cassandra. "She made me do it! It was all Ms. Blackwood's plan!"
###Chapter 199

All eyes in the room locked onto Cassandra Blackwood with laser focus.

"Cassandra! Did you actually do this?" Reginald Blackwood's voice trembled with disbelief.

Julian Montgomery's piercing gaze burned into the terrified Cassandra, his jaw clenched so tight it could shatter diamonds.

Had Evelyn not accidentally consumed that tainted wine, he would have been the one falling victim to this viper's scheme.

Evelyn Carter lowered her lashes, her expression unreadable. A faint smirk curled her crimson lips as if she'd already unraveled every twisted thread of this conspiracy.

"You! How dare you frame me?" Cassandra shrieked, lunging forward like a rabid animal before Penelope Whitmore intercepted her. "I'm the chairman's daughter! Think carefully about the consequences before dragging my name through the mud!"

Her bravado rang hollow - anyone could see the terror in her darting eyes.

She couldn't expose Victoria Sterling now. That would only prove her own involvement in the poisoning.

Cold sweat drenched Cassandra's back as realization struck - she'd been played like a fiddle by that cunning snake, Victoria.

"Such wickedness!" Penelope spat venomously. "Our household treats staff with kindness, yet you drugged these young masters and tried pinning it on my daughter? You vile creature! Last time, Cassandra merely corrected your behavior, and you sought revenge by dragging her down with you? Never!"

Penelope clutched Leonard Blackwood's arm desperately. "Leo! Call the authorities! Arrest this treacherous wretch for slandering our precious girl!"

Leonard, who would never believe his darling capable of such depravity, barked orders. "Security! Restrain her and notify the police immediately!"

"It wasn't me! It was Ms. Cassandra!" The maid's voice cracked with hysteria. "She promised me a fortune to complete this task! Enough to escape servitude forever! Ms. Cassandra, why won't you confess? You wanted to seduce Mr. Montgomery! Speak up!"

Penelope moved to gag the maid, signaling for her removal.

She knew the servant lacked concrete evidence. Otherwise, it would have surfaced already.

Evelyn had pieced together the puzzle but sensed something amiss.

Having lived with the Blackwoods for three years, she knew Cassandra's limited intellect couldn't orchestrate such a sophisticated scheme.

This reeked of Penelope's handiwork - except Penelope would never drug her own flesh and blood.

Which left only one mastermind: Victoria Sterling.

Evelyn's sharp eyes caught the fleeting smirk playing on Victoria's lips.

White-hot fury surged through her veins, but she schooled her features. Without proof, accusing Victoria would only make her seem paranoid. She wouldn't give that serpent an escape route.

"Chairman Kingsley," Leonard addressed Harrison Kingsley solemnly, "this incident reflects poorly on our household management. Please accept our deepest apologies for this oversight."

Harrison's smile didn't reach his eyes as he maintained stony silence.

Leonard's expression darkened. That old fox is deliberately humiliating me by refusing my apology!

Nathan Blackwood disagreed with this premature conclusion. His icy gaze cut through the tension. "No, this is clearly—"

"Father," Evelyn interjected smoothly, "since Chairman Blackwood has apologized and the culprit has been identified, perhaps we should let this matter rest tonight. No real harm was done, and both our families value our reputations in Crestview. Escalating this would only cause unnecessary scandal. Shall we be the bigger people here?"

Nathan studied her with visible surprise.

Something was off.

The old Evelyn might have swallowed this insult, but Evelyn Carter never backed down from a fight!

He remembered the feral glint in her eyes when Sebastian was poisoned - like a cornered panther ready to tear out throats. This sudden compliance? Impossible.

Was she planning a more devastating counterstrike?

When Julian heard Evelyn call Harrison "father," his shock nearly sent him reeling. He hadn't realized Evelyn had gained such powerful backing. The chasm between them kept widening.

"Leonard," Harrison's voice could freeze hell, "I'm only accepting this apology for my daughter's sake." His reluctance hung thick in the air.

Seeing the danger had passed, Cassandra collapsed into Penelope's embrace. Seizing the opportunity, Penelope whisked her daughter away like thieves in the night.
###Chapter 200

The grand birthday celebration that began with splendor concluded in utter humiliation.

After such a disgraceful spectacle, Reginald had no desire to continue his birthday festivities. Harrison and Evelyn didn't linger either.

The Blackwoods escorted Evelyn and Harrison to the exit. Nathan walked silently beside Evelyn, his lips parting several times as if wanting to speak, yet words failed him.

Harrison kept shooting Nathan sideways glances sharp enough to pierce steel. If looks could kill, the young heir would've been buried six feet under by now.

Harrison fumed internally: How dare this insolent boy marry my precious daughter? He's nothing but a pretty face who somehow won Evelyn's heart. Pathetic!

"Mr. Kingsley!"

Victoria rushed after them, her face the picture of innocence. "I'm truly sorry for tonight's misunderstanding. I had no idea Ms. Carter was your daughter, which led me to assume she was involved with Mr. Blackwood..."

Harrison didn't break stride or grant her a single glance. "Ms. Sterling, if Evelyn weren't my daughter, would you have continued fanning those malicious rumors?"

"That's not what I meant—" Victoria's heart lurched with panic.

Nathan recalled how Victoria had dramatically exposed Evelyn's supposed affair with Sebastian in front of Harrison and Reginald. The venom in her eyes made him recoil as if seeing a stranger.

His lips twisted into a bitter smirk, disappointment weighing heavy in his chest.

"Ms. Sterling," Harrison said coldly, "I suggest you refrain from spreading slander when ignorant of the facts. Words cut deeper than blades. Imagine the damage you could've caused to an innocent woman's reputation." He quickened his pace, leaving her behind.

Victoria watched their retreating figures, hatred boiling in her veins. Even Nathan abandoned her without a backward glance. An icy dread seeped into her bones, as if doused in freezing water.

Outside, four luxury vehicles stood at attention. Theodore and a team of bodyguards awaited Harrison and Evelyn.

"Evelyn! Wait!"

Reginald caught Evelyn's hand, his eyes shimmering with tears. "Why did you hide being Harrison's daughter? Why become my caretaker under false pretenses?"

Evelyn sighed mournfully. "The century-old feud between our families forced me to conceal my identity when marrying Nathan. Our families' rivalry made my true name dangerous. Had I revealed myself as Harrison's daughter, I'd never have gotten close to you..."

Harrison and Leonard exchanged loaded glances while Nathan's heart twisted with anguish.

"You foolish girl!" Reginald squeezed her hand. "To hell with ancient grudges! I've never opposed your union. If you love each other, that's all that matters! I wholeheartedly support your marriage!"

Evelyn managed a faint smile at the old man's modern phrasing.

"Grandfather, I'm no saint. I've deceived you for so long. Nathan and I don't love each other. Even without the family feud, we can't be together."

Nathan felt the air leave his lungs, despair darkening his gaze.

"Now that your celebration is over, Nathan and I must finalize our divorce." The words carved fresh wounds in Evelyn's heart. She embraced Reginald, eyes burning. "Though I'll no longer be your granddaughter-in-law, I'll always be your Evelyn. You'll forever be my grandfather. Please stay healthy and live long."

Reginald clung to her, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

As Evelyn turned toward the car, Nathan finally snapped. He lunged forward to stop her.

Evelyn was no longer someone he could casually touch.

His outstretched hand hovered uselessly before dropping to his side.

"Answer me one thing," he rasped.

Evelyn turned, her expression glacial.

"When you married me under false pretenses... was it only because of our families' history?"

Nathan's lips trembled. He drank in her features as if memorizing them for eternity.

"Yes." The single word left Evelyn's lips like a death sentence.

"Then why?" Nathan's voice cracked, his bloodshot eyes pleading. "You're the Monarch Group heiress—wealthy beyond need. You knew our marriage was contractual. You knew we had no future... Why agree to marry me at all?"
###Chapter 201

Contract marriage?!

Harrison's face darkened with fury. His fingers curled into tight fists, barely restraining himself from punching Nathan square in the jaw.

Yet what truly baffled him was his own daughter's incomprehensible actions.

He'd thought Evelyn had reached peak recklessness when she'd secretly gone to warzones, patching up soldiers while dodging bullets and explosions.

But this? Disappearing for three years just to enter a contractual marriage with his sworn enemy's son? Harrison wanted to crack open Evelyn's skull to understand what madness possessed her.

Nathan's breath hitched, his chest constricting painfully. The finality of their separation hit him like a freight train.

Their three-year farce of a marriage would officially end after tomorrow's meeting at City Hall. But Nathan refused to let it end without answers.

"That first meeting three years ago," Nathan demanded, voice rough. "When Grandfather proposed our marriage, why didn't you refuse?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed into feline slits, glinting with cold amusement. "We're divorced now, Mr. Blackwood. Does it matter? Consider it a whim - a bored heiress playing house when your grandfather offered the opportunity."

"Evelyn!" Nathan's voice cracked. "I deserve the truth."

She sighed dramatically. "Dwelling on the past is pointless. Focus on your future endeavors instead."

Extending her hand with mocking formality, she added, "Next time we meet, we'll be business rivals. Show no mercy, because I certainly won't. Our past... arrangement shouldn't factor into competition."

She'd nearly said "love," but caught herself. There had never been love between them - not from his side, at least.

Nathan stared at her outstretched hand like it was a venomous snake. Taking it would mean truly letting go.

With an indifferent shrug, Evelyn slid into the waiting limousine. As the engine purred to life, she lowered the window one last time.

Nathan's pulse thundered when her gaze met his.

"Nine o'clock tomorrow at City Hall, Mr. Blackwood. Don't be late."

The limousine pulled away, its tires crushing Nathan's heart beneath their weight.

Behind him, Reginald wiped his eyes while Leonard wore a complicated expression.

"Finally realizing her worth after she's gone?" Reginald scoffed at his son. "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Both of you discard treasures while clinging to trash."

Leonard clenched his jaw, unable to refute the accusation.

Who could have imagined that the quiet, unassuming caregiver from the countryside - the one who endured three years of humiliation without complaint - was actually Harrison Kingsley's most cherished daughter? The heiress to the Monarch Group empire?
###Chapter 202

The Blackwood family was undoubtedly one of the most influential dynasties in Crestview. Had the news of Nathan and Evelyn's marriage been made public, their stock prices would have skyrocketed overnight.

But all those possibilities were now shattered.

The car glided through the inky darkness. Evelyn stared blankly out the window, her fingers tracing invisible patterns on the chilled glass. A hollow ache spread through her chest.

She couldn't stop replaying the devastated look in Nathan's eyes when he'd demanded to know why she married him. That wounded expression haunted her - as if she'd been the one who betrayed him.

Evelyn clenched her fists until her nails bit into her palms. She shook her head violently. "I can't afford to pity him!" Pity would only lead to heartbreak.

Nathan could never love her. If three years weren't enough to make him fall for her, why would he suddenly care now? That bitter resentment in his eyes was just an act for Harrison's benefit - another manipulation to justify his cruelty.

"So tell me," Harrison ground out through clenched teeth, his knuckles white, "why did you marry that bastard?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, rolling her eyes. "Dad, drop it. It's ancient history."

"Ancient history my ass!"

Harrison's roar made both the driver and Theodore in the front passenger seat jump. "My precious daughter secretly weds that Blackwood scoundrel for three years and ends up divorced! If I hadn't attended Reginald's birthday today, were you planning to hide this from me forever?"

"So... why did you go anyway?" Evelyn attempted to deflect. "Did Leonard invite you?"

"Don't change the subject!"

"Well..." Evelyn nibbled her lower lip. "He was handsome?"

"Handsome?!" Harrison bellowed. "Every single one of my sons is more handsome than Nathan Blackwood!"

"But your sons can't marry me!"

Harrison momentarily choked on his fury before exploding again. "What did they offer you then? What were the wedding gifts? How many jewelry sets? Villas? Cars? What percentage of shares did you get? And why wasn't there a single media report about the wedding? When the president of Blackwood Industries gets married, knowing Leonard, he'd parade it like a damn peacock! Especially marrying into our family! Why wasn't he strutting around like a cat who got the cream?"

"Dad," Evelyn said quietly, "you forgot I used a fake identity. They never knew I was your daughter."

At first, the memory stung, but Harrison's indignant rant almost made her laugh despite herself. "Besides, I preferred keeping things low-key."

Remembering how the Blackwoods had disparaged "Evelyn Carter" earlier, Harrison seethed, itching to bankrupt them by sunrise.

"You endured three years of marriage under a fake identity?" Harrison stared at her as if she'd grown a second head. "Evelyn, are you insane? Stupid? Possessed? This isn't how a Kingsley behaves!"

Evelyn wasn't any of those things. She'd simply loved Nathan enough to marry him at any cost.

A bitter smile touched her lips as she reached for Harrison's trembling hand, covering it with both of hers. "Nathan never mistreated me these past three years. We had... good moments. Don't worry about me, Dad. See? I'm home now."

"Where else would you go?" Harrison's voice cracked with mingled rage and anguish. His strong features twisted in pain, suddenly looking years older. "Fine. Since you married as Evelyn Carter, Nathan's ex-wife is that nobody - not my precious Evelyn. My daughter remains the most dazzling gem no man is worthy of!"

"Exactly! Perspective is everything!" Evelyn hugged her father tightly, resting her head on his shoulder as the car carried them through the night.
###Chapter 203

The birthday celebration had finally ended. Concerned about Eleanor's wellbeing, Reginald summoned his private physician to examine her. Only when the doctor confirmed her stable condition did the elderly patriarch relax.

In the dimly lit hospital corridor, two strikingly handsome men leaned against the windowsill, their silhouettes outlined by the moonlight.

Nathan extended his hand. "Got a smoke?" Julian Montgomery passed him a cigarette, watching as his friend lit it with practiced ease. The acrid smoke curled between them like ghosts of unspoken words.

"Evelyn Carter... the real Evelyn Kingsley?" Julian's voice held disbelief. "The legendary heiress of Harrison Kingsley's empire?"

Nathan exhaled sharply, the nicotine doing little to calm his nerves. His fingers trembled slightly as he tapped ash into the tray.

"Damn it, Blackwood!" Julian punched Nathan's shoulder with playful force, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "You hit the jackpot without even realizing it! Do you know what you've lost? You were married to the Kingsley princess! If you'd stayed married, Monarch Group's resources would've been at your fingertips. Your father and that viper Penelope wouldn't dare cross you then. Blackwood Industries would've been yours for the taking."

"I don't need Evelyn's connections to claim what's rightfully mine." Nathan blew a perfect smoke ring, shooting Julian a warning glare. "Do I look like some pathetic gold-digger to you?"

Julian chuckled. "No, you're the type who'll work himself to death before enjoying life. A true corporate martyr."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"What a waste," Julian sighed dramatically. "With the Kingsleys' backing, you could've retired by forty!"

Crushing the cigarette with unnecessary force, Nathan swallowed the bitter taste of regret. "I still don't understand why she chose me in the first place."

"Neither do I," Julian agreed cheerfully. "You're moody, emotionally constipated, and pining after Victoria. She'd have been better off with me."

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Tell me, Montgomery, do you honestly think Harrison Kingsley would approve of you for his daughter?"

"At least I wouldn't jump to conclusions every time she spoke to another man. That alone puts me ahead of you in the running, don't you think?" Julian's grin widened. "Remember how you used to pick fights whenever she was with Sebastian? All those cruel things you said... any regrets now?"

Nathan's knuckles turned white. "She should've told me who she really was!"

"You were divorced. She owed you nothing." Julian's tone turned uncharacteristically serious. "The truth is, you never trusted her. No foundation, no future. I admire her for enduring three years of your bullshit. I would've walked out after three days."

Every word struck like a knife. Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, veins protruding along his clenched fists.

Julian clapped Nathan's shoulder with false cheer. "But hey, thanks for the cautionary tale. When I pursue Evelyn - whether as Carter or Kingsley - I'll make sure not to repeat your mistakes. Wish me luck!"

"Go to hell." Nathan's murderous glare could've vaporized lesser men.

"Already on my way." Julian turned to leave, then paused dramatically. "You're not really letting tonight's incident slide, are you?"

"Penelope and Cassandra won't escape consequences." Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Even with evidence, Leonard will bury this to avoid scandal. But I have other ways to make them pay."

"Evelyn's safe this time, but what if—"

"Then Penelope and Cassandra would be in police custody right now."

Julian inhaled sharply at the icy promise in Nathan's tone. The air around them grew heavy with unspoken threats. Should any harm come to Evelyn, Julian had no doubt Nathan would eliminate every threat permanently.

A new thought struck Julian. "What about your fiancée? Victoria was the first to alert Harrison about Evelyn's situation. Doesn't that strike you as suspicious?"

Nathan's brow furrowed, irritation and suspicion warring within him. The game had changed, and suddenly, all the pieces looked different.
###Chapter 204

Nathan Blackwood had never believed in coincidences.

Yet for Victoria Sterling's sake, he desperately wished this was merely happenstance.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Oliver Sinclair rushed over breathlessly, handing Nathan his phone. "I've reviewed all surveillance footage of Madam Whitmore, Ms. Cassandra, and Ms. Sterling's movements tonight. You should see this."

"Impressive work, and so quickly!" Julian Montgomery paused mid-stride, turning back to observe.

Nathan's gaze dropped to the screen, his breathing growing shallow as he studied the footage.

"The video clearly shows Ms. Sterling interacting closely with Madam Whitmore and Ms. Cassandra. What's more concerning—" Oliver's voice darkened, "I found no evidence of Ms. Sterling near the room where Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Kingsley were located."

"How fascinating." Julian chuckled darkly. "If she was never there, how could she possibly have witnessed them entering together?"

Nathan's brow furrowed deeply. A buzzing filled his ears as if he'd been slapped.

The Blackwood family had gathered in the grand foyer, with Victoria among them.

Cassandra's face was ghostly pale. She claimed illness, but fear from tonight's events truly shook her.

Fortunately, Leonard believed his daughter unconditionally. With Penelope's support, Cassandra avoided suspicion.

Now Cassandra glared at Evelyn Kingsley's innocent expression, fingers itching to claw that deceptive face.

"Who would have imagined we'd allow such a fraud to marry Nathan?" Penelope wrapped a protective arm around Cassandra's shoulders, seething at how Evelyn had stolen the spotlight.

"Indeed! She concealed her true identity while living with Nathan for three years. It's terrifying when you think about it—doesn't this constitute fraud?" Victoria feigned concern.

"What an impressive performance!" Reginald Blackwood scoffed. "Why don't you two clowns take the stage for my birthday celebration?"

Penelope and Victoria froze mid-breath.

Nathan approached with stormy eyes, having heard every word.

"You keep accusing Ms. Kingsley of fraud. What exactly did she take? Money? Shares? Property?" Reginald's voice cut like steel. "She fulfilled every wifely duty—respectful to elders, kind to Cassandra, devoted to Eleanor. When Nathan divorced her, she left without a penny. Where's the fraud in that?"

Though aged, Reginald's mind remained razor-sharp. "For three years you tormented that girl. Don't think I didn't know what happened behind closed doors just because I didn't live here!"

"Father, we simply voiced concerns about her character," Leonard interjected through gritted teeth.

"Concerns that miraculously vanished when you discovered she's Harrison Kingsley's daughter, no?" Reginald leaned back with disdain. "Too late for regrets now. You rejected a billionaire heiress for this bankrupt family's daughter. Leonard, wouldn't your business in Fairhaven have flourished with Evelyn Kingsley as your daughter-in-law? Doesn't that sting?"

Leonard's jaw clenched, humiliation burning his cheeks.

Even Penelope recognized her husband's regret over choosing Victoria over Evelyn, her frustration mounting.

Evelyn was elite royalty—Harrison's only child from his first marriage. The Sterlings paled in comparison to the Kingsley empire. No wonder Leonard seethed.

Nathan's pale lips parted, but Victoria exploded first. "Grandfather, you've always despised my family! But love isn't measured in wealth! So what if the Kingsleys are rich? Nathan and I share true love—childhood sweethearts who survived his darkest trauma together! Nothing can replace that!"

She rushed to Nathan, clutching his sleeve desperately. "Nathan, tell them!"

Nathan's lowered gaze met hers with unfamiliar coldness.

In that moment, he strained to recall cherished childhood memories with this woman.

His mind came up empty.

Those treasured fragments had dissolved into nothingness.

Finally, the light in his eyes extinguished. His hoarse voice carried utter exhaustion.

"Victoria... let's postpone the wedding."
###Chapter 205

Nathan's words were spoken with chilling calmness, his heart already numb to the pain.

But for Victoria, those words struck like a detonated bomb. Her face burned as if she'd been slapped.

Dominic and Penelope stood frozen in shock. Only Cassandra couldn't suppress a dark smirk.

After tonight's events, Cassandra had seen Victoria's true nature. She had been used as a scapegoat, and now she refused to let this viper marry into their family.

The wedding was merely postponed—but if it were up to Cassandra, she'd cancel it entirely and make Victoria pay for her schemes.

"Nathan… you're really abandoning me?"

Victoria's voice trembled. She clutched his arm, tears streaming down her face. "Is it because Evelyn turned out to be Harrison Kingsley's daughter? Are you regretting divorcing her now?"

"Whether she's Evelyn Carter or Evelyn Kingsley changes nothing between us."

Nathan slowly, firmly, pried her fingers away. His striking eyes were ice-cold. "I warned you not to target her again. Yet you framed her, manipulated the situation, and pushed her into danger. I don’t understand this hatred of yours."

"No! Nathan, I just wanted you to see her for what she really is!" Victoria lunged forward in desperation, but he stepped back. She stumbled, nearly falling.

"She’s been lying to you from the start! And now you’re throwing away over a decade of love for a scheming woman like her? Don’t I deserve better?"

"She lied, but she never harmed anyone."

Nathan thought of Evelyn’s radiant smile—once reserved only for him—and regret twisted inside him. His voice was rough. "We need time apart. To think about whether this is what we truly want."

Victoria watched him walk away, her throat tightening as if invisible hands were choking her.

How did it come to this?

Her dream wedding had shattered in an instant. She refused to accept it. She would marry Nathan, no matter the cost.

After years of careful planning, she wouldn’t let that bitch Evelyn ruin everything.

"Hmph! My grandson is loyal, but he’s no fool." Reginald’s voice cut through the tension. "Ms. Sterling, I thought you’d at least wait until after the wedding to show your true colors. But you couldn’t even manage that."

His nose reddened with anger. "You brought this on yourself—twisting facts, spreading lies, bullying Evelyn!"

"Sir, the young madam’s name is Evelyn now, not Evelyn," Marcus corrected quietly.

"What does it matter? It’s the same person!" Reginald waved him off.

Victoria’s fingers twisted together, humiliation and fury burning through her.

Cassandra smirked, arms crossed. She was enjoying this.

"Marcus! Let’s go. I need a drink—and food!" Reginald declared.

"But sir, you’ve already had quite a bit tonight—"

"I’m happier now than I was at that damned party. Stop nagging!"

With that, Reginald stormed out, Marcus trailing behind.

The air in the room was thick with tension.

"Leonard! You have to talk sense into Nathan!" Penelope shrieked, shaking her husband’s arm. "Their engagement was announced publicly! Calling it off now would humiliate us all!"

Leonard, usually indulgent with his wife, felt irritation prickle under his skin. His tone turned cold. "You know Nathan. Once he decides something, he doesn’t change his mind."

Penelope’s face twisted. "Victoria waited for him all these years! He can’t just—"

"Enough." Leonard cut her off. "This isn’t about waiting. It’s about trust. And she broke it."

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms.

This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 206

Leonard's voice dripped with bitterness. "Back when Nathan decided to divorce Evelyn, he didn't even bother consulting me. Now that he wants to call off his wedding with Victoria, do you really think he'll consider my opinion?"

"This is completely different!"

Penelope's usually refined tone turned shrill. "Nathan never loved Evelyn Carter. He and Victoria grew up together. Their bond runs deeper than you can imagine!"

"Exactly." Leonard scoffed. "What I don't understand is why your precious niece isn't satisfied with their so-called deep connection. Why can't she just wait patiently instead of constantly provoking Ms. Kingsley? Her little stunt tonight - running to Harrison with half-baked accusations - has brought nothing but shame to the Blackwood name! I refuse to get involved in this mess any longer."

The memory of Reginald's mocking expression made Leonard's chest tighten. He glared at Victoria. "If I'd known you'd cause this much trouble, I would've advised Nathan to stay married to Evelyn! You're not just socially beneath us - you're a walking disaster for this family. The gap between you and Nathan is insurmountable."

Seeing Leonard abandon Victoria, Penelope's shoulders slumped as if her golden ticket to wealth had evaporated.

"Aunt Penelope..." Victoria's swollen eyes streamed tears as she gasped between sobs. "What do we do now?"

"Ha!" Cassandra clapped her hands with glee, her earlier discomfort forgotten. "Serves you right, you scheming witch! How dare you use me as your pawn? Someone like you could never marry my brother! Get out of our house!"

"I never used you!" Victoria wiped her tears while twisting the truth. "The party was enormous - I needed your help to execute our plan properly. Besides, I never told you to drug Julian Montgomery! That was your own stupid idea that ruined everything!"

"You're blaming ME?" Cassandra's eyes burned crimson. "I should've seen your true colors sooner!"

True to her nature, Cassandra chose violence over words. She lunged at Victoria, grabbing the six-figure diamond hairpin and yanking it free - taking a chunk of Victoria's hair with it. Victoria's scream pierced the air.

The two women tumbled to the floor like alley cats, scratching and pulling hair right in front of Penelope.

"Enough!" Penelope's roar shook the room. Both women paused, panting heavily, still gripping fistfuls of each other's hair with murderous glares.

"I'm counting to three," Penelope hissed. "One! Two! Three!"

The combatants reluctantly released each other.

"Cassandra, go to your room. I need to speak with your cousin privately." Penelope's icy tone brooked no argument.

"Mother!" Cassandra's hair resembled a bird's nest. "She set me up! If not for her, I wouldn't have humiliated myself tonight!"

"Don't pretend you're blameless!" Penelope snapped. "How many times have I warned you about rushing things with Julian? But no - you had to try seducing him at your grandfather's birthday gala! Is this what my elite education produced? You've only made him despise you more! Go reflect on your behavior!"

Cowed by her mother's fury, Cassandra shot Victoria one last venomous look before storming out.

Victoria stood frozen, clutching her ruined dress. A cold realization settled in her heart.

Penelope would move heaven and earth for Cassandra's desires, but Victoria? She was just a disposable pawn in Penelope's game to control Nathan.

"Aunt Penelope, about tonight—"

The sharp crack of Penelope's palm against Victoria's cheek cut off her words.
###Chapter 207

Victoria Sterling was utterly speechless at Penelope Whitmore's slap.

"I've warned you repeatedly—keep Cassandra out of your schemes." Penelope's crimson lips twisted in disgust. "Don't blame me for choosing my daughter over you!"

"Aunt Penelope, I'm sorry!" Victoria's eyes burned with resentment, yet she groveled. "I wasn't thinking clearly. It won't happen again!"

Penelope studied Victoria's desperate pleas with disdain.

If not for the fact that Victoria was her only usable pawn, Penelope would never have groomed such a treacherous woman to marry into the Blackwood family. Years of meticulous training couldn't be wasted now.

Tonight's debacle sickened her, but for the sake of her grander ambitions, she'd endure.

"Evelyn is Harrison Kingsley's daughter now," Penelope hissed, her painted nails digging into Victoria's shoulder. "Harrison is notoriously overprotective. Lay a finger on her, and you'll regret it. Your priority is reclaiming Nathan's heart and securing that marriage."

"But Nathan wants to end things!" Victoria wailed, her dreams of wealth crumbling. "Just like Uncle Leonard said—no one changes his mind once it's set!"

Penelope's eyes glinted dangerously. "It's not hopeless yet."

She leaned in, voice sharp as a blade. "Disappear. No calls, no outings, no visitors. Let the world believe you're shattered by the breakup."

Victoria hesitated. "Would that really work?"

"You can't trap a wolf without bait." Penelope smirked. "Suffer now so Nathan remembers your devotion later. That's how you'll win him back."

Meanwhile, Nathan Blackwood sat in his study, cigarette smoke curling around him like ghosts. His jaw was clenched, his gaze icy.

The memory of Evelyn's cool reminder—9 a.m. at City Hall—kept sleep at bay.

After visiting Sebastian Kingsley at the hospital, Evelyn had returned to her Crestview villa to prepare for the divorce. She'd even persuaded Harrison to return to Fairhaven, determined to face the morning alone.

Post-shower, her nightly routine complete, Evelyn devoured a bowl of fiery ramen, slipped on a silk eye mask, and slept soundly—until dawn.

Thanks to last night's drama at Reginald Blackwood's birthday gala, she'd barely rested. When her eyes finally fluttered open, the clock read 8:00 a.m.

"No! Theodore!" She bolted upright, scrambling for her tassel earrings. "Why didn't you wake me? My alarm didn't go off!"

Downstairs, Theodore Winslow—apron-clad and holding a spatula—froze at the sight of her. Barefaced, hair tousled, yet radiant. Her lips were naturally rosy, her eyes bright with irritation.

Every damn morning, she stole his breath.

"You were exhausted," he said gently. "I thought you needed the rest."

"Today of all days?" Evelyn seethed, yanking on her red skirt. "I can't be late to my own divorce! That arrogant bastard will think I'm hesitating!"

Theodore exhaled in relief. He'd worried she might be melancholy, but Evelyn spun in her festive outfit, grinning.

"Ms. Carter, at least eat something before—"

"No time! Pack it for the car!"

Today, Theodore opted for the Rolls-Royce over the Bugatti—comfort over flash.

In the backseat, Evelyn nibbled a sandwich while her fingers flew across her laptop.

"That Isabella Wang is impossible," she muttered. "Our team's reached out a dozen times, and her agent barely acknowledges Monarch Group's existence!"

Theodore tightened his grip on the wheel. "Two phone calls. No face-to-face. She's playing hardball."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Then we play harder."
###Chapter 208

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile. "What about Blackwood Industries?"

Theodore adjusted his glasses. "From what I've gathered, they're encountering identical issues."

"Excellent." Her manicured fingers tapped the mahogany desk. "That means we're still neck and neck with them."

"It's not just Blackwood we're up against." Theodore handed her a tablet displaying competitor analytics. "At least ten luxury hotels nationwide are vying for Isabella Laurent's wedding contract."

Evelyn took a deliberate sip of her espresso. "Between Monarch Grand Hotels and Blackwood Hotel, we're the only ones meeting Isabella's standards. She thrives on exclusivity—those boutique venues don't stand a chance."

She set down her cup with a decisive click. "Double our outreach efforts to her team. When Isabella visits Crestview next week, I'll personally ensure this deal is ours." Her emerald eyes hardened. "Nathan Blackwood won't steal this from me."

——

City Hall's entrance buzzed with giddy couples clutching marriage licenses. Laughter and camera flashes filled the air as lovebirds posed beneath heart-shaped clouds.

The arrival of a jade-green Rolls-Royce Phantom drew awestruck whispers.

Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch—9:03 AM.

Theodore snorted. "Fashionably late, as expected of Mr. Blackwood."

"Let him play his games." Evelyn's gaze lingered on a blushing bride adjusting her veil. "This is the last time I'll ever wait for him."

Three years ago, she'd stood alone at these same steps for eight hours without food, her wedding dress wilting in the summer heat. Nathan had sauntered in at closing time without apology, demanding they "get this over with."

Yet that night, she'd traced their marriage certificate with trembling fingers, too euphoric to sleep.

Now the memory tasted like ash.

A yellow taxi screeched to a halt thirty minutes later. Theodore's jaw dropped as Nathan emerged in a charcoal Tom Ford suit, his ice-blue tie mirroring the winter sky.

"Bloody hell," Theodore muttered. "Since when does a billionaire take cabs?"

"Pride won't let him flaunt wealth during a divorce." Evelyn smoothed her Stella McCartney jumpsuit and stepped into the sunlight.

Nathan's presence ignited a wave of hushed admiration. Women nudged their partners, covertly snapping photos of his razor-sharp jawline.

Evelyn's Louboutins clicked against marble as she approached. "Mr. Blackwood, you—"

"Flat tire." His baritone voice carried the barest hint of contrition. "My apologies."

The words hung between them like shattered glass. This was the first "sorry" he'd ever given her.
###Chapter 209

"It's fine, as long as you make it before 5:00 p.m. We can still finalize the divorce today." Evelyn's voice was icy as she turned toward the exit.

Nathan stood frozen, his throat tight with emotion.

The memory of three years ago flashed before his eyes—the day they were supposed to get their marriage license. But an urgent meeting with a project manager from Valmont had forced him to stay at the office.

By the time the meeting ended, important clients had arrived unexpectedly, demanding his attention.

Only later did he realize—he had forgotten to tell Evelyn to reschedule.

The recollection was sharp, a painful reminder of his negligence.

When he finally rushed to City Hall, the place was empty. Evelyn stood there alone, head bowed, looking heartbreakingly small.

Nathan hadn't expected her to wait all day.

He hadn't expected anyone to be that stubborn.

Back then, he had wanted to apologize. But resentment toward his grandfather for forcing this marriage, combined with Victoria Sterling's abrupt departure, had left him emotionally wrecked.

"Nathan, you're finally here!"

Even now, he could still see Evelyn's radiant smile when he closed his eyes.

At the time, he hadn't known what it would take for her to give up on him.

Now he knew—his relentless indifference had shattered her heart beyond repair.

Shame twisted inside him as he followed Evelyn into the building, his expression rigid.

"Are they here to get married? They look perfect together!"

"But neither of them seems happy."

"She’s probably mad because he’s late. And she has every right to be—this is an important day!"

"Honestly, he doesn’t even look like he can afford her. No car? These days, men are the real gold diggers."

Gold digger?!

Nathan's jaw clenched. He shot a lethal glare at the gossiping young man, who immediately paled and fell silent under the weight of his chilling aura.

At the divorce counter, Evelyn and Nathan sat side by side, handing over their marriage license and IDs.

The clerk glanced between them and cleared his throat. "Are you both certain? Three years of marriage isn’t easy to walk away from."

"Money isn’t an issue for either of us. He has staff to cook, clean, and manage his life. There’s nothing complicated about this separation."

Evelyn’s tone was frigid.

Nathan and the clerk both stiffened.

She checked her watch impatiently. "Please hurry. I have other engagements."

The clerk hesitated. "No children to consider? Any property division?"

"None."

Nathan stayed silent. He wanted to offer her something—anything—but she wouldn’t take it.

Now that he knew she was Harrison Kingsley’s daughter, anything he gave would seem like an insult.

"Then just sign here."

The clerk slid two forms forward. Evelyn signed swiftly, then glanced at Nathan—only to find his hand trembling uncontrollably.

Her brow furrowed.

Why the hell is he shaking? Is this some last-minute act to pretend he still cares?

"Mr. Blackwood, sign it already. Or have you forgotten how to write your name?"
###Chapter 210

Nathan felt a cold sweat break out across his brow. His left hand gripped his right forearm tightly, but the trembling wouldn't stop.

The fountain pen clattered to the marble floor.

Evelyn noticed his strange behavior immediately. Her sharp eyes studied him with clinical precision.

Nathan looked utterly exhausted. His usually immaculate dark hair was disheveled, his tailored suit wrinkled with dust. Even his collar and cuffs showed signs of grime.

What had happened to him? Why did he look like he'd been through a war?

Evelyn's curiosity burned. She bent gracefully to retrieve the pen, sliding it back across the polished table.

When the final signatures were in place, the clerk stamped their divorce certificates with practiced efficiency.

It was done. Their marriage officially dissolved in thirty seconds flat.

"May you both find happiness in your new lives," the clerk recited mechanically.

Outside City Hall, Evelyn examined the embossed document with unexpected detachment.

The prolonged legal battle had dulled the sharp pain she'd felt when Nathan first demanded the divorce. Now, only relief remained.

Love had once made her compromise everything. Now free, she could focus entirely on rebuilding her empire.

Men were officially off the menu.

"Mr. Blackwood, I have other engagements. We'll part ways here. Goodbye."

Evelyn tucked the certificate into her designer handbag and turned toward the stone steps.

"Evelyn, wait—"

A sickening thud interrupted him.

She whirled around, her breath catching.

Nathan lay sprawled across the steps, his face contorted in pain.

Though only five steps, the fall looked brutal.

"Nathan!"

Evelyn rushed to his side, noticing his violent tremors had worsened.

"You've been unwell since we arrived. What's wrong with you?"

"It's nothing." Beads of sweat dotted his ashen forehead. He stubbornly refused to explain.

"Tell me right now!" Her medical training kicked in, voice sharp with authority.

Every muscle screamed in protest as Nathan struggled to focus. Her concern sent an unexpected warmth through his chest.

"Do you actually care what happens to me?"

Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "I'd stop for a wounded stray. Basic human decency requires nothing less."

Nathan's pallor darkened. He pushed her away weakly. "Save your pity. I don't want it."

"You need medical attention. Uncontrolled falls indicate cerebellar dysfunction." Her professional tone brooked no argument.

"Is this about the divorce? Do you hate me so much you'd wish neurological damage upon me?" His icy glare could freeze lava.

"Don't flatter yourself." Her hollow laugh held no mirth. "I'm thrilled to be rid of you. Didn't you hear the clerk? 'Happy independent lives' sounds perfect to me. Since you're clearly fine, I'll take my leave. Do try not to concuss yourself on the way out."

Nathan's vision swam with red-hot anger.

The moment Evelyn released him, his legs buckled again, sending them crashing together.

Her voluptuous curves molded against his hardened frame. His traitorous hands found her cinched waist, fingers trembling against the scarlet silk.

Rational thought evaporated.

"Remove your hands before I remove them for you!"

Evelyn's dagger-sharp glare promised violence. "My pet alligator needs new chew toys."
###Chapter 211

Evelyn wished she could transform into Sophia's pet crocodile, Bruno, and bite off Nathan's arrogant head.

During their three-year marriage, Evelyn and Nathan had slept in separate bedrooms. He had never even brushed his fingers against hers. Now that they were divorced, Nathan kept grabbing her waist and invading her personal space. Evelyn thought Nathan was so disgusting that even Bruno would refuse to eat him.

Nathan's heart shattered when he saw the revulsion in Evelyn's eyes at his touch.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

A Porsche screeched to a halt nearby. Oliver rushed out, his face pale with worry.

"Mr. Blackwood, have you lost your mind?! After that horrific car crash, you should be in the hospital! Since when did you start gambling with your life?!"

"I'm not dead yet."

Nathan struggled to keep his heavy eyelids open, his vision still blurred. "And who are you to question my decisions?"

Evelyn froze in shock.

Now she understood why Nathan had been so disoriented this morning, why his hands had trembled too violently to hold a pen.

He'd been in a car accident.

"Nathan, you absolute idiot! You should be getting medical attention, not finalizing divorces! Do you think Death cares how handsome you are? Internal bleeding could paralyze you if untreated!" Evelyn's voice shook with unexpected concern.

Nathan's lips thinned. "Haven't you been waiting for this day? If I'd gone to the hospital instead of signing those papers, would that have made you happy?"

Evelyn blinked, then laughed coldly. "Of course not. So I should thank you for your dedication?"

"Evelyn!"

At the familiar voice, Evelyn whirled around.

Two sleek Bentleys had pulled up silently. Sebastian and Dominic stood by the cars, impeccably dressed. Her second brother held a bouquet of blood-red roses, his smile radiant.

"Seb! Dom!" Evelyn sprinted toward them, her entire face lighting up.

Nathan felt like his heart had been dipped in acid, the bitterness consuming him.

He remembered stupidly waiting outside the Kingsley mansion years ago, watching through the windows as the family laughed together while he stood freezing in the snow, only to be humiliated later.

He didn't know whether to hate himself for being blind to Evelyn's true identity or hate her for deceiving him so completely.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn gently took Sebastian's bandaged hand. "Seb, you should be resting at home!"

"I'm not made of glass. I healed weeks ago." Sebastian wrapped an arm around his sister's waist. "Today matters to you, so it matters to us. We missed your wedding...but we wouldn't miss this."

"Seb..." Evelyn's nose stung with emotion.

"Congratulations, Evie!" Dominic thrust the roses forward. "Congratulations on ditching that bastard Nathan! Welcome back to royalty!"

"Thanks, Dom! Love you!" Evelyn buried her face in the fragrant blooms.

Dominic had deliberately said "that bastard Nathan" loudly enough for the entire block to hear.

The bastard in question looked ready to commit murder.

"Evelyn!"

From another luxury car emerged Lillian, Camille, and Sophia, surrounding Evelyn in a warm embrace.

"You all came?!" Evelyn's eyes welled up.

"Obviously!" Sophia crushed her in a hug.

Lillian explained gently, "Harrison wanted to come too, but we thought it might cause unnecessary attention..."

"I understand." Evelyn smiled through her tears.

Nathan watched his ex-wife enveloped in familial love and felt both tormented and curious.

For three years, he'd given Evelyn none of this affection. So why had she stayed? Why endure his cruelty?

The unanswered questions were driving him mad.

"Oh my God! It's Camille Kingsley! The legendary actress who retired at her peak!" Oliver gaped at the still-gorgeous movie star. "I need her autograph! My mom worships her!"

Nathan shot him a death glare. "We're leaving."

But the words barely left his mouth before darkness swallowed him whole.
###Chapter 212

Mr. Blackwood!

When Nathan Blackwood opened his eyes, the sterile white ceiling of the hospital room greeted him.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled his nostrils.

His first conscious thought was of her.

"Evelyn," he rasped, his throat dry.

"You have a contusion in your right wrist and a mild concussion," the doctor informed him. "Some minor blood clots, but nothing life-threatening."

Evelyn stood by the window, her silhouette framed by the harsh morning light. The way the sunlight caught her profile made her look both ethereal and untouchable.

While Nathan had been unconscious, Oliver had filled Evelyn in on the accident details.

According to Oliver, Nathan hadn't slept at all the previous night. When Oliver entered the study that morning, the room had been so thick with cigarette smoke it made his eyes water.

"Mr. Blackwood likely suffered from exhaustion," Oliver explained. "Combined with his chronic migraines, it's no wonder he lost control of the vehicle."

Evelyn knew all too well how debilitating Nathan's migraines could be. They were the reason he rarely drove himself anywhere.

Her lips curled in derision. Who are you performing for? Smoking yourself sick, losing sleep, refusing medical attention? Victoria might fall for your theatrics, but I see right through you.

"Get well soon," she said coldly, turning toward the door. "I'm leaving."

"Evelyn! Wait!"

Panic flashed across Nathan's face as he threw off the hospital blanket. Ignoring the IV in his arm, he lunged after her.

Just as her fingers touched the doorknob, Nathan's body pressed against hers, caging her between his arms and the door.

"Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn hissed, struggling against his hold.

"Answer my question and I'll let you go."

Nathan's voice was rough with exhaustion. His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "Why did you marry me?"

"You're insufferable!"

Evelyn tried to knee him, but Nathan anticipated the move, pinning her leg with his own. She bit her lip in frustration.

Though trained in self-defense, she was no match for Nathan's military academy-honed reflexes.

"Evelyn," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "I just want the truth. Is that so difficult?"

"I was young and stupid, alright? Now get off me before I scream for security!"

Nathan didn't budge. His expression darkened at her flippant response.

Then the door swung open abruptly.

The sudden movement sent Evelyn crashing into Nathan's chest. Instinctively, his arms wrapped around her waist, his palms flattening against the soft curve of her abdomen.

She was softer than he remembered.

A rush of heat flooded his veins.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

"Mr. Blackwood! Mrs. Blackwood!"

Oliver stood frozen in the doorway, his eyes wide. The scene before him defied comprehension.

Seizing the opportunity, Evelyn twisted free. She aimed her stiletto at Nathan's foot, but he dodged with infuriating ease.

Though her attack failed, she managed to slip past Oliver and flee down the corridor.

"Sir... should I go after her?" Oliver asked hesitantly.

Nathan's expression was thunderous. Oliver wondered if he'd just signed his own death warrant by interrupting.

"Go after her?" Nathan's voice dripped with venom. He clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. "No. Go to HR instead. Tell them to deduct your entire annual bonus."
###Chapter 213

The divorce papers were signed, severing Evelyn Carter's thirteen-year marriage to Nathan Blackwood.

If memory served her right, Nathan would wed Victoria Sterling right after Reginald Blackwood's eightieth birthday celebration.

Victoria had finally gotten what she wanted - the chance to parade as Mrs. Blackwood, wife of Blackwood Industries' powerful CEO.

The thought didn't bother Evelyn. She genuinely wished them happiness.

After all, Victoria was the perfect match for Nathan.

That evening, Evelyn returned to Fairhaven with her brothers Sebastian, Dominic, and her loyal assistant Theodore Winslow.

"Evelyn!"

The moment she stepped through the wrought-iron gates of Willow Creek Estate, a melodious voice called out to her.

Evelyn's lips curved into a radiant smile. "Arabella!"

Harrison Kingsley's youngest daughter came running down the marble pathway, her sundress fluttering like butterfly wings.

"Evelyn! I've missed you terribly!"

Arabella threw herself into Evelyn's arms. Tears glistened in her kitten-like eyes, her nose turning the cutest shade of pink.

"My sweet little sister." Evelyn embraced her tightly, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Why the tears when I'm finally home?"

Though nearly the same height, Sebastian and Dominic couldn't help noticing how Evelyn seemed to envelop their delicate sister.

"You won't leave us again, will you?" Arabella's voice trembled, her rosy cheeks damp with tears. She looked like a fragile rosebud about to bloom.

"I'm here to stay this time." Evelyn smoothed her sister's hair. "To help Father with Monarch Group and be with all of you. No more goodbyes."

Guilt twisted Evelyn's heart at the raw emotion in Arabella's eyes.

In her foolish pursuit of love and freedom, she'd abandoned the family who cherished her most.

But she was home now. The pain in Arabella's expression shattered her.

"Wonderful! Everyone's been waiting for your return!"

Arabella clung to Evelyn a moment longer before turning to greet her brothers with a polite bow.

"Sebastian. Dominic."

Dominic sighed. "No need for formalities, Arabella. We're your brothers, same as Evelyn."

Sebastian added gently, "You've lost weight. Is university treating you well?"

"I've been preparing for my graduation recital." Arabella's eyes sparkled before dimming with hesitation. "Would you... perhaps come to my performance? Only if you're not too busy, of course!"

"Wild horses couldn't keep us away," Dominic declared.

Sebastian nodded. "We'll clear our schedules."

Evelyn slung an arm around Arabella's shoulders. "Just give me the date and I'll block my entire calendar for my favorite sister!"

Arabella trembled with joy. "I'll send you all the details! Thank you!"

Evelyn stroked her sister's silken hair affectionately.

Arabella was the epitome of grace and consideration, never causing their family worry. Yet Evelyn's heart ached at how overly self-sufficient she was.

As Harrison's youngest and Camille's only child, Arabella should have been the most pampered. But Evelyn, as the legitimate heiress, had unwittingly stolen the spotlight.

Remarkably, Arabella bore no resentment. Camille had raised her to respect and adore her siblings. Since turning eighteen, Arabella refused family allowances, earning scholarships and working part-time. Her classmates never guessed she was a Kingsley.

Evelyn recognized the unshakable inferiority complex Arabella carried - the belief that as an "illegitimate" child, she deserved less.

"Miss Arabella," Theodore interjected smoothly, "might there be an extra ticket for me?"

Arabella's head snapped up. Meeting Theodore's warm gaze, a blush spread across her porcelain cheeks.
###Chapter 214

"Absolutely!" Arabella responded with a bright smile.

Theodore's grin widened as he adjusted his cufflinks. "Then I'll accompany Ms. Evelyn."

Theodore had watched Evelyn and Arabella grow up together. He could still picture Arabella at six years old - sticky fingers clutching a lollipop, pigtails bouncing as she trailed after her older sister.

Evelyn didn't think much of Arabella's flushed cheeks. Her younger sister had always been shy, her porcelain skin prone to rosy blushes.

What Evelyn didn't realize was that Arabella had secretly loved Theodore for seven long years.

"Let's go! I'm starving." Evelyn grabbed Arabella's delicate hand. "I've been dreaming about Camille's cooking for weeks. Tonight we feast!"

Arabella giggled, shaking her sister's arm playfully. "Mother's still preparing dinner. You're too early!"

"My stomach disagrees!" Evelyn groaned as her belly rumbled loudly.

Theodore chuckled, reaching into his tailored suit pocket. "Ms. Evelyn, perhaps this will tide you over?" He unwrapped a square of dark chocolate and held it to her lips.

Without hesitation, Evelyn turned her head and took a delicate bite, their familiarity evident in the effortless gesture.

Arabella's pink lips pressed together, her chest tightening at their easy intimacy. She'd known since childhood that Theodore only had eyes for Evelyn.

He'd given up a prestigious legal career in Serenia to become Evelyn's personal secretary, content to remain in her shadow. Arabella had always been invisible to him.

The Kingsley mansion buzzed with rare energy that evening. Not only had Evelyn finalized her divorce from Nathan Blackwood, but Arabella's unexpected visit brought unexpected joy.

The staff hadn't seen the Kingsley sisters laughing together like this in years. Their shared mirth filled the grand halls of Fairhaven with warmth.

Only Cassandra's absence dampened the mood. Married to a Serenian presidential candidate, the youngest Kingsley sister couldn't break away from her political obligations.

Camille and the kitchen staff presented a lavish spread that made Evelyn's mouth water - roasted duck with cherry glaze, truffle-infused risotto, and her favorite chocolate soufflé.

Just as Evelyn reached for her fork, Harrison's commanding voice froze the room. "Living room. Now."

The family assembled - Sebastian with his perpetual frown, Dominic leaning against the grand piano, Arabella perched nervously beside Lillian and Sophia. Even Frederick paused his duties to stand attentively by the door.

Harrison's imposing figure dominated the space, his stormy expression radiating displeasure.

"Dad, can't this wait until after dinner?" Evelyn whined, eyeing the steaming dishes longingly.

"After the mess you've made?" Harrison scoffed. "You're lucky I let you sit at the table."

Evelyn forced a grin. "Come on, we should be celebrating my divorce!"

Arabella gasped, her teacup clattering against its saucer. "You were married?"

The revelation stunned her. Evelyn - the pragmatic, unshakable Evelyn - had married? And divorced? Arabella couldn't imagine her sister making such an emotional decision.

"Three years," Harrison growled. "Three years you wasted on that Blackwood bastard. And now he's parading some new fiancée while you come crawling home empty-handed!" His fist slammed against the mahogany table. "You're a Kingsley! Why didn't you bankrupt them first?"

Evelyn's playful demeanor evaporated. "Father, we discussed this. Reginald built Blackwood Industries from nothing. I couldn't destroy his life's work."

"I'd rather have an ungrateful daughter than a humiliated one!" Harrison's voice cracked with emotion, his usually composed features twisting in anguish. "Three years of suffering, Evelyn!"

The raw pain in his words silenced the room.

Sebastian's jaw clenched, while Dominic shot his sister a worried glance.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered against her cheeks as she fought back tears. She'd known her father's love ran deep, but this outburst revealed the true depth of his protective fury.

Her silence had only magnified his pain.

"Lillian," Harrison turned his glare toward Evelyn's stepmother, "the Blackwoods mentioned you met Evelyn publicly. Did you know about this marriage?"

Lillian met his gaze steadily. "Yes, I discovered it some time ago."
###Chapter 215

Lillian was prepared to face Harrison's full wrath, as long as Evelyn and Arabella remained undiscovered.

Harrison's voice thundered through the room. "Then why didn't you tell me?! You of all people should have known better! You watched Evelyn grow up! Did it not tear you apart to see her suffer in that wretched place?!" His fury was directed at his second wife.

"It's all my fault, Harrison."

Lillian rose slowly, her usual aristocratic poise replaced by quiet humility. "Please don't blame Evelyn. If you must direct your anger at someone, let it be me. I failed in my duty to protect her."

Evelyn's chest tightened. Just as she opened her mouth to defend Lillian, Sophia—always the most impulsive—sprang up from the sofa. "Harrison, don't take this out on Lillian! I'm just as guilty. I knew about Evelyn's marriage too!"

Harrison's eyes nearly bulged from their sockets.

"What?!"

Camille raised a timid hand. "I... I also knew for a long time."

"Camille!" Harrison clutched his chest dramatically. "Even you betrayed me?! When did my obedient wife start keeping secrets from me?"

Evelyn's eyes stung with unshed tears.

Harrison couldn’t possibly unleash his temper on everyone now.

"Father, please calm down," Dominic interjected smoothly, stepping forward as the mediator. He handed his father an ornate teacup, his expression the picture of appeasement.

"Get lost!"

Harrison, usually the epitome of refinement, was so incensed that he swore outright.

"Wait—don’t tell me you two knew as well?!"

Sebastian and Dominic exchanged glances before clearing their throats.

Harrison thought bitterly, Look at this family of performers! Every single one of them is a masterful actor, and I was the only fool left in the dark!

A man who had spent his life outmaneuvering rivals in business had been thoroughly outplayed by his own family.

With a final enraged shout, he stormed upstairs without another word.

"Harrison, aren’t you joining us for dinner?" Camille called after him, but received no reply.

"Camille, perhaps you should go up and comfort him? He’s always softened by you," Lillian suggested wearily.

"I... I don’t dare. I’ll just set aside his favorite dishes and bring them to him later." Camille, ever the timid soul, shrank back.

"Harrison usually retreats to his collection room when he’s upset. Oh no—what if he—" Sophia paled mid-sentence.

A bloodcurdling scream echoed from upstairs.

"Call the police! My antique rosewood chair worth 100 million dor is gone!"

The Kingsleys finished dinner in record time.

Had Sebastian and Dominic not physically restrained Harrison, he would have driven to Crestview that very night to reclaim the chair Evelyn and Sebastian had gifted to Reginald.

Harrison grew more eccentric with age. Collectors of rare antiques were notoriously shameless in their pursuits, and Harrison had become particularly volatile in recent years.

An elderly Harrison was a force to be reckoned with—wealthy men no longer had women fawning over them, so he channeled his passions elsewhere.

That evening, Evelyn and Arabella stayed up late chatting. They indulged in a joint skincare routine, massaging each other’s hands with luxurious creams.

"By the way, did you like the birthday gift I made for you?" Arabella asked, propping her chin on her hands as she lounged on the bed.

"I adored it so much that I had it framed and hung in my Crestview villa’s study. The day I put it up, Theodore thought I’d commissioned a 3D-printed portrait—it was that lifelike! And you know how sparing he is with compliments. He couldn’t stop praising your talent."

Evelyn gazed at her sister fondly, stroking Arabella’s delicate fingers. "Arabella, your artistry deserves royal recognition. Should we insure your hands? You’re the pride of the Kingsley family!"
###Chapter 216

"Evelyn, please stop complimenting me. My needlework can't hold a candle to Mother's." Arabella's cheeks flushed as she shyly bit her lip, revealing adorable dimples.

Being praised by Evelyn made Arabella's heart flutter.

But what truly set her pulse racing was when Nathan had admired her work too. The memory alone might keep her awake all night.

"You've inherited not just Camille's musical talents but her exquisite embroidery skills too," Evelyn remarked, eyes sparkling. "I could introduce you to Rosalind Walker herself. With your combined talents, you'd dominate the fashion world overnight! What do you say?"

"Thank you, Evelyn. But my heart belongs to acting." Arabella's voice softened with uncertainty. "After all, I'm studying at Crestview Arts Institute. I dream of becoming a renowned actress."

Her father Harrison had vehemently opposed this path, still haunted by how the industry had treated Camille years ago.

Arabella had secretly transferred from Valmont University to Crestview, studying drama for eight months before Harrison discovered the truth. His reluctant permission came with an ultimatum - complete her degree under his conditions or be disowned.

Determined to prove herself, Arabella vowed to succeed on her own merits. She wanted to change Harrison's perception of acting and earn his genuine respect.

"Magnificent! If that's your dream, you have my full support!" Evelyn embraced her, though concern shadowed her bright eyes. "But the entertainment industry is a viper's nest. Without connections or wealth, doors won't open easily. When you audition, simply write 'Harrison Kingsley is my father' on your resume. I guarantee you'll-"

"Evelyn! Father already despises my career choice. That would only make things worse!" Arabella laughed nervously. "Besides, success earned through privilege would feel hollow. I want to prove my worth through hard work alone."

"That Kingsley ambition shines through!" Evelyn sighed, pinching Arabella's cheek affectionately. "I just worry the industry might break your gentle spirit."

Like Camille, Arabella possessed remarkable talent but a tender heart. In that cutthroat world, she'd be vulnerable prey.

"Evelyn...may I ask you something?" Arabella hesitated before whispering, "About your...former marriage?"

"You want to know about Nathan?"

Arabella nodded eagerly. "Why did you divorce? Did he...hurt you?"

"No, we simply weren't compatible," Evelyn answered smoothly.

"But...as CEO of Blackwood Industries, he must have been terribly busy. Was that why-"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Why not assume he was unfaithful?"

"Impossible!" Arabella waved dismissively. "With his fortune? He'd be terrified of dying before spending it all!"

Evelyn's laughter rang out - her fierce reputation within the family remained intact.

Just then, her phone vibrated.

Nathan's name flashed on the screen.

Her expression darkened. Not wanting to worry Arabella, Evelyn slipped into her velvet slippers and retreated to the parlor.

"Well?"

"You answered unusually fast." Nathan's baritone voice curled around her.

"Ha! Don't forget to rate this five-star customer service," she quipped sarcastically.

Nathan's jaw tightened audibly. "I'm being discharged tomorrow. Meet me at Cliffside Manor."

"Tomorrow? In such a hurry to meet your maker?" she scoffed.

"Just be there. I'll be waiting."

"Not happening." Her refusal was immediate. "I'm occupied, and that house holds nothing for me anymore. Don't contact me again. Goodbye."

"You left many belongings behind," he countered smoothly. "Don't you want them?"
###Chapter 217

Evelyn thought, Oh, so Victoria Sterling is officially moving into Cliffside Manor to live with Nathan as his wife now? No wonder he wants my things gone. If I were her, I'd be furious seeing my husband's ex-wife's belongings cluttering up the place. I get it.

"Mr. Blackwood, if my things are taking up space, just toss them out. No need to consult me." Evelyn's voice was icy, detached.

"What about the gifts you gave me over the years? Should I throw those away too?"

Evelyn scoffed, her tone dripping with mockery. "I didn’t give you those gifts. Evelyn Carter did. She might’ve treasured them, but to me? They’re nothing but trash."

Nathan fell silent, the weight of her words pressing down on him like a suffocating fog.

"In the future, contact my secretary if you need anything. I don’t take calls from strangers. Goodbye."

"Evelyn!"

"What now?" Her patience was wearing thin, her voice sharp with irritation.

"What about those costumes? You kept them meticulously preserved in garment bags. Don’t you still want them?"

Nathan’s voice turned colder, more commanding. "If you don’t come get them, I’ll assume you’ve abandoned them—and I’ll dispose of them as I see fit."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. She hesitated.

Each of those exquisite costumes had been part of Camille Kingsley’s private collection, painstakingly handcrafted with intricate detail.

When Evelyn had asked to borrow them for a performance for Reginald, Camille had opened her entire wardrobe without hesitation, even insisting Evelyn keep them.

She couldn’t let Camille’s generosity be destroyed by that arrogant bastard. With a resigned sigh, she relented. "Fine. I’ll send my secretary to Cliffside Manor tomorrow to collect them."

"No. You’ll come in person."

Nathan’s tone was imperious, as if he held all the cards. "I won’t let your secretary in. I’ll be waiting for you tomorrow. Goodbye."

The line went dead.

Damn him! Evelyn glared at the darkened screen, fury simmering beneath her skin.

They were just clothes, yet Nathan acted like he’d uncovered some hidden vulnerability of hers.

Fine. She’d go—and treat it like a game of exorcising demons.

The next morning, Evelyn and Arabella freshened up and headed to the dining hall for breakfast.

Sebastian had an early meeting at the office, so he’d already left. Harrison, his three wives, and Dominic were already seated.

"The sleepyheads finally grace us with their presence! We’ve been waiting forever." Dominic propped his chin on his hands, grinning teasingly at his sisters.

"Arabella and I haven’t seen each other in ages. We stayed up late catching up." Evelyn yawned, her eyes slightly bloodshot at the corners.

Arabella, however, looked radiant—her skin glowing, cheeks flushed with vitality. Youth truly was wasted on the young. Evelyn would never bounce back so effortlessly.

Harrison sat at the head of the table, his gaze fixed on Evelyn. Dark circles shadowed his eyes. Clearly, he hadn’t slept well.

Who would’ve thought a single chair could rob the wealthiest man in Fairhaven of a night’s rest?

Evelyn felt no guilt. She ate with her usual appetite, as if last night’s incident had nothing to do with her.

The gift had been given. No take-backs. Harrison would just have to live with it.

As Evelyn rose to leave, Harrison’s cold voice cut through the air. "Do you still have feelings for that Blackwood boy?"

The table froze.

Evelyn answered calmly. "No."

"Then you’re completely over the divorce?"

"Harrison, we’ve known each other for twenty-four years. If you have something to say, spit it out. Don’t waste my time with pointless tests." Evelyn dabbed her lips elegantly with a napkin.

"Fine. Quentin!"

Harrison’s chief secretary hurried over, handing him a document. Harrison snatched it and flung it across the table at Evelyn.

"What’s this?"

"A list."

"What list?"
###Chapter 218

A neatly printed list of potential suitors. Harrison smirked with satisfaction.

Gasps echoed around the breakfast table.

Arabella, usually the epitome of elegance, was so stunned her fork clattered onto the marble floor.

Dominic choked on his coffee, coughing violently until his face turned scarlet.

"Harrison!"

Evelyn shot up from her seat, eyes blazing. "Is this your petty revenge? How childish can you be?"

"A true strategist must be ruthless."

Harrison took a leisurely sip of his espresso. "Besides, you're my daughter. Why would I seek revenge? You're divorced now, and no matter how discreet you are, word will spread. Nathan is already parading his new fiancée while you're left humiliated. As your father, I refuse to let that bastard outshine you."

"So if he jumps off a cliff, should I follow?" Evelyn scoffed, seething.

"Regardless, my decision is final." Harrison slid the document across the table. "Quentin compiled this last night—every eligible bachelor in the country, all from prestigious families, unmarried, and within your age range. Starting next month, you'll meet at least five per week. Weekends are your reprieve." His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn nearly overturned the table. "Absolutely not! I won't go!"

"Fine. Then consider your position at Monarch Group forfeited."

Her jaw clenched. Damn this manipulative old fox—blackmailing me with my career!

"You promised me the CEO role in exchange for revamping Monarch Grand Hotel!" she hissed, cheeks flushed. "Breaking your word will curse you to an early grave!"

"If my demise secures your lifelong happiness, then it's a worthy sacrifice." Harrison folded his hands, the picture of paternal devotion.

"I refuse to be paraded like some prize mare!"

"Then shall I handpick your successor as well?" His sharp gaze pinned her. "Never forget—I still hold the final say."

Breakfast concluded in icy silence.

Evelyn stormed out, fists trembling. She felt like she'd swallowed gunpowder, ready to detonate.

Since childhood, her sanctuary had been the hidden grotto in the estate gardens. At twenty-four, she still retreated there to curse or cry in private.

Predictably, Dominic found her minutes later, ducking inside with a grin. "Knew you'd be here, little stormcloud."

"Tell me honestly—is this Harrison's twisted payback for taking his chair?" she demanded.

"Not entirely." He stretched his legs. "He’s trying to help you move on. A fresh start."

"By auctioning me off? Why can't I just be happily single?"

She hurled a pebble across the pond. "Men are deadweight! Let him go on those dates—maybe wife number five will finally stick!"

Dominic chuckled. "You know how he is—vindictive and sore loser." Leaning in, he whispered, "But if you defy him, he will strip your CEO title."

A flicker of fear crossed her face. "Dom… what do I do?"

"Simple." He winked. "Give me that list."

Her eyes lit up. "You'll eliminate them for me?"

"I'll vet them first. Pick the hottest one—keep him as a plaything." He dodged her swinging fist, laughing.

Her phone rang abruptly.

Nathan Blackwood glared from the screen.

Fury reignited. She answered with a snarl. "What the hell do you want at this ungodly hour? Lost all shame?"

"Are you leaving soon?" His calm voice grated.

"No!"

"Come out now." A pause. "I'm at your gates."
###Chapter 219

Outside Willow Creek Estate, Nathan Blackwood leaned against his sleek black Ferrari, his imposing figure casting a long shadow in the afternoon sun.

His piercing gaze studied the elegant wrought iron gates, fingers tapping impatiently against the car door.

For days, Nathan had been digging into the Kingsley family history, determined to uncover every secret.

Harrison Kingsley had purchased this exclusive property for his first wife - Evelyn's mother. This wasn't just real estate; it was a statement of power and legacy.

The estate bore the name of Evelyn's mother, Willow Brown.

Evelyn had chosen her mother's maiden name when creating her false identity to live with the Blackwoods.

Nathan wondered why she'd picked such a common name as Evelyn.

She was anything but ordinary.

A creaking sound snapped him from his thoughts as the massive gates began to swing open.

Nathan straightened instantly, his broad shoulders tensing beneath the light blue jacket.

Evelyn stood on the stone steps, one hand shielding her eyes from the sun as she regarded him coolly.

Today, Nathan had abandoned his usual three-piece suits that seemed grafted to his skin.

The khaki pants and casual jacket made him look almost approachable - a stark contrast to his usual intimidating presence.

Evelyn had never seen him dressed so casually. It made her suspicious - was this calculated?

Handsome as ever, but still rotten to the core.

She shuffled forward in her house slippers, the small steps making her appear unexpectedly vulnerable.

Nathan's gaze dropped to her feet, an unfamiliar warmth spreading through his chest.

"Why are you staring at my feet? Never seen slippers before?" Evelyn curled her toes self-consciously beneath his scrutiny.

His lips quirked. "You're always in stilettos. This is... different."

"Then you must be blind," Evelyn scoffed. "I wore these every day for three years when you came home. But of course you wouldn't notice. No need to rub salt in the wound."

Nathan felt like he'd been punched in the gut. The memories came flooding back.

How she'd always greeted him first, apron-clad with cooking utensils in hand. Her bare face glowing from kitchen heat, yet always smiling just for him.

He'd scorned those moments. Now he'd give anything to have them back.

"Let's talk in the car." Nathan opened the passenger door with forced calm.

"We can talk right here." Evelyn crossed her arms stubbornly.

"Or would you prefer to invite me inside?" Nathan took a deliberate step closer, watching her flinch.

"Don't push me, Nathan!"

Before she could react, his long fingers closed around her wrist and he effortlessly deposited her into the leather seat.

The door clicked shut before she could protest.

"You—"

Nathan was already in the driver's seat, the locks engaging with a decisive thunk.

"Really? You need to lock me in just to have a conversation?" Evelyn yanked at the handle uselessly.

"I lock the doors when I drive. Wouldn't want you jumping out mid-conversation."

Evelyn's eyes flashed with fury, her body tensing for an explosion.

Suddenly Nathan was leaning across the console, his scorching body heat enveloping her. His nose nearly brushed hers, eyelashes fluttering against her cheek.

"What the hell—" She shoved at his chest in panic.

Nathan captured her hand, pressing it against his pounding heart. "Evelyn," he murmured, breath warm against her lips. "Don't move."
###Chapter 220

Nathan's arm slid around Evelyn's waist as he carefully buckled her seatbelt.

She recoiled instantly, wiping her hand on her dress as if contaminated. "Where exactly are you taking me?"

"Last night's agreement," he reminded her, fingers tightening on the steering wheel. "You were supposed to collect your belongings from Cliffside Manor today."

"I said I'd go! You didn't need to kidnap me!"

His lips curled into a humorless smile. "Forgive me if I don't trust your word." The engine roared to life. "How many lies did you tell during our three-year marriage, Evelyn? Was there ever a single moment of honesty between us?"

"Was there?" she countered icily.

"Think whatever you want." She turned toward the window. "None of it matters now."

The words struck Nathan like a bullet to the chest.

Sometimes he wished she'd never loved him at all. At least then the guilt wouldn't claw at him every time he saw that wounded look in her eyes.

The Ferrari accelerated onto the highway, city lights blurring into streaks of color.

Realizing escape was impossible, Evelyn reclined her seat and closed her eyes. If she couldn't flee physically, she'd retreat mentally.

"Sorry about that," Nathan muttered suddenly.

Her eyes flew open. "About what?"

She'd noticed his bizarre behavior since the divorce. The man who'd once been as stubborn as a mule now apologized constantly. Had Victoria signed him up for some kind of sensitivity training?

"Not realizing Sebastian was your brother."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Ancient history."

"But why didn't you explain?" His gaze traced her profile. "That night at the gala—"

"Would you have believed me?" She laughed bitterly. "The world always assumes the worst of women. If I weren't a Kingsley, if I were still just poor Evelyn Carter, you and everyone else would've branded me a gold-digging whore." She met his eyes. "I stopped caring what strangers think of me years ago."

Nathan's knuckles whitened against the leather wheel.

Did that include him now? Was he just another stranger to her?

The thought left him hollow.

After miles of tense silence, he ventured, "So Sebastian's the eldest, Dominic's second, and Maxwell took your mother's surname? Why is that?"

"Nathan."

Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. Her entire body had gone rigid. "You're crossing a line."

"I didn't—"

"Don't," she cut him off. "The only reason I'm tolerating this is because Kingsleys are raised to take the high road. But if you keep digging into my family..." Her nails dug into her thighs. "I don't care who you are. There won't be enough left of you to bury."

Nathan's jaw clenched.

"I didn't investigate," he ground out. "Maxwell looked familiar after our... altercation. I checked my military academy yearbook and recognized him. We trained together."

Evelyn turned back to the window, effectively ending the conversation.

With a frustrated sigh, Nathan hit speed dial. Oliver answered on the first ring.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

"Purchase heels for Ms. Carter," Nathan ordered. "Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, or Manolo Blahnik. Deliver them to Cliffside Manor immediately."

Evelyn's head snapped toward him.

Those were her favorite designers.

"Right away, sir!" Oliver's enthusiasm suggested he thought this might lead to reconciliation.

Nathan's gaze dropped to her feet. "Size 36," he added quietly. "Don't get it wrong."

The unspoken implication hung between them—he still remembered every detail about her.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn's long lashes fluttered as goosebumps rose on her porcelain skin.

"How did you know I wear size six shoes?" she demanded.

Nathan maintained his composed demeanor. "Just a lucky guess. Your feet look exceptionally petite."

Her toes curled instinctively in her house slippers. "Men are such perverts," she scoffed.

Nathan remained silent.

He couldn't possibly admit the truth.

The real reason he knew Evelyn's shoe size was because he'd meticulously examined every trace she'd left behind at Cliffside Manor, treating each discovery like buried treasure.

Through this secret investigation, he'd learned she hoarded snacks like a squirrel preparing for winter, with chocolate making up eighty percent of her stash.

Her signature perfume was Serge Lutens La Fille de Berlin. He'd once thought its bold fragrance didn't suit her delicate nature. Now he realized how wrong he'd been - this intense, romantic scent might as well have been created exclusively for her.

The size six shoes revelation came from the neatly arranged white sneakers she'd left on the shoe rack, positioned as if awaiting her imminent return.

That day when she'd accused him of never understanding her had cut deep.

This was his way of rediscovering her.

The two-hour drive passed in near silence.

When the Ferrari pulled into Cliffside Manor's courtyard, Nathan unbuckled first and leaned toward Evelyn.

She anticipated his move, blocking him with her arm. "I can manage my own seatbelt."

But Nathan exploited her momentary hesitation, his arm brushing her flat stomach as he swiftly released the buckle.

"You're welcome," he murmured.

Evelyn narrowed her striking eyes. His speed was inhuman! She'd heard from Maxwell that while most cadets took ten seconds to assemble a pistol, Nathan could do it in eight.

This explained how he kept outmaneuvering her.

Their arrival sent shockwaves through the staff.

"Oh my God! Is that Ms. Carter with Mr. Blackwood?"
"She's even more stunning than I remembered! How could he let her go?"
"What do we call her now? Ms. Carter or...?"
"Definitely Ms. Carter. If Victoria hears us using 'Madam' for anyone else..."
"You're right. That woman's jealousy knows no bounds. Nothing like Ms. Carter's kindness."

The whispers reached Nathan's ears. He glanced at Evelyn, whose indifferent expression only deepened his discomfort.

"Where are my belongings?" she asked coolly.

"Exactly where you left them."

"You knew I was coming today. Why wasn't everything prepared?" She frowned.

"I wouldn't dare touch your treasures," Nathan said pointedly.

Men truly were fools, he reflected. When Evelyn had been his devoted wife, he'd taken her for granted. Now that she pushed him away, he found himself obsessed with understanding her.

Avoiding his gaze, Evelyn asked, "Should I retrieve them myself, or will you have someone pack them?"

His phone interrupted with an urgent call. "I need to take this. I'll be right back."

"Whatever."

As Nathan hurried off, Evelyn exhaled, releasing the tension that had built during their journey.

The irony wasn't lost on her - as his wife, she'd schemed for moments alone with him, only to be ignored. Now this same man had personally driven to Fairhaven to fetch her, purchased her favorite heels, and performed small intimacies like fastening her seatbelt - all the attentions she'd once begged for.
###Chapter 222

Evelyn felt an odd discomfort creeping up her legs, like tiny spiders skittering across her skin.

The tenderness in the air had curdled, leaving a bitter aftertaste like spoiled cream.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Theodore. "Theo, I'm at Cliffside Manor in Crestview. Come get me now."

"What?!" His voice crackled with shock. "Why are you there?"

"Long story," she sighed. "Just hurry."

After hanging up, Evelyn marched upstairs.

She refused to linger in this suffocating mansion a second longer than necessary. All she wanted was to grab her things and vanish the moment Theo arrived.

Her old room wasn't far from Eleanor's. After checking with a maid about Eleanor's whereabouts, she decided to visit.

As Evelyn approached Eleanor's door, Cassandra's shrill voice sliced through the wood.

"You lying little mouse! What really happened between you and Julian at Grandfather's party? Spit it out!"

"N-nothing! Really—" Eleanor's tearful stammer twisted Evelyn's heart.

"Liar!"

Cassandra's rage escalated. "Do you expect me to believe nothing happened when he was drugged? Those marks on his neck didn't come from nothing! Or was he mauled by a stray dog?"

"I don't remember! I swear— Ah!"

CRASH!

The sound of shattering porcelain exploded through the door.

Evelyn saw red. Her fists clenched as she kicked the door open, startling the fuming Cassandra.

"You again?!"

Before Cassandra could react, something whizzed toward her face.

THWACK!

A slipper connected with a sickening smack.

"AHH!"

Another slipper followed, smacking Cassandra square between the eyes.

Her nose swelled instantly. Stars danced in her vision as a perfect shoe print bloomed across her forehead.

Cassandra clutched her face, finger trembling as she pointed at Evelyn. Fury rendered her speechless.

"Did you gargle sewage? Your breath reeks." Evelyn crossed her arms, tilting her head with a razor-sharp smile.

"Annie!" Eleanor whimpered from the corner, trembling.

When she spotted Evelyn, tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Evelyn Carter! You psychotic witch!"

Cassandra's face burned from the impact. These slipper soles packed more punch than brass knuckles. "Don't think your last name makes you untouchable! As a Blackwood, I won't let this slide!"

"Promises, promises." Evelyn's icy gaze dripped with mockery. "If you had any spine, you wouldn't be bullying your sister behind closed doors. If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were raised by rabid hyenas."

It took Cassandra three full seconds to process the insult. Then she lunged, claws outstretched. "You BITCH! I'll tear you apart!"

Evelyn sighed in disgust.

She refused to touch this rabid creature—who knew what diseases she carried?

Just as Cassandra's nails grazed Evelyn's sleeve, an iron grip locked around Cassandra's wrist.

"AGH! Let go!" Cassandra shrieked, doubling over in pain.

Evelyn felt Nathan's imposing presence behind her and spun around in shock.

Their eyes collided.

For a fleeting moment, she thought she glimpsed concern in those obsidian depths. But no—that couldn't be right.

She'd sooner believe in unicorns than trust this man to care.

"Did she hurt you?" Nathan's voice was uncharacteristically soft as his gaze swept over Evelyn. The concern in his tone felt alien.
###Chapter 223

Nathan froze for a split second. His ex-wife's icy voice cut through the air. "I'm unharmed, but Eleanor might be injured."

His dark eyes constricted instantly. Without warning, Nathan's fingers clamped around Evelyn's slender wrist like a vise.

"Ah! Nathan! You're hurting me!" Evelyn gasped, pain shooting up her arm. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead as tears welled in her eyes.

His lips pressed into a thin line before abruptly releasing her.

The sudden release sent Evelyn stumbling backward. She crashed onto the marble floor with an undignified thud, her designer dress rumpled beneath her.

"Nathan! She attacked me first!" Evelyn shrieked, pointing at the faint shoe print on her cheek. "Look at this! Evidence!"

Her manicured hands pounded the cold floor in frustration. "This woman barged into Cliffside Manor and assaulted your sister! How dare you take her side without hearing the full story!"

Nathan didn't even glance at Evelyn. His intense gaze remained fixed on Cassandra as he asked in that deep, commanding voice, "Are you certain you're alright?"

Cassandra merely rolled her eyes in response.

She moved toward Eleanor, kneeling gracefully before the trembling girl. Gentle fingers brushed through the child's soft curls.

"Aunt Cassie!" Eleanor launched herself into Cassandra's embrace, silent tears finally breaking free.

The child had endured Evelyn's abuse without crying, but the sight of her protector shattered her composure.

"Hush now, little star." Cassandra cradled Eleanor close, her voice tender yet firm. "No one will harm you while I'm here. From this moment forward, you're under my protection."

Her emerald eyes blazed with fury as they locked onto Evelyn. The woman resembled nothing so much as a fairytale villainess.

Something unfamiliar stirred in Nathan's chest as he watched the tender scene. The way Cassandra held his sister... it awakened a strange longing in him.

"Mark my words, Evelyn." Cassandra's voice turned deadly quiet. "Eleanor is mine to protect now. Don't think I'm unaware of what happens at Cliffside Manor in my absence."

Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "Lay one finger on this child again, and I'll make you regret the day you were born."

Evelyn's breath hitched, genuine fear flashing across her face. Mascara-streaked tears tracked down her cheeks as she turned pleading eyes toward Nathan.

"Nathan, please—"

"Did you hear Ms. Blackwood?" Nathan's voice could have frozen hell itself. His attention never wavered from Cassandra.

Evelyn collapsed against the floor in defeat. The realization struck her like a physical blow - Nathan had never truly considered her family.

"Apologize to Eleanor." Nathan's command brooked no argument.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a mutinous line.

"Forget it." Cassandra waved a dismissive hand. "A forced apology is worthless." Her laugh held no warmth. "We'll consider it progress if she refrains from biting people like a rabid dog."

With a final glare, Evelyn stormed off, slamming her bedroom door with enough force to rattle the chandeliers.

"Cassandra Blackwood!" she seethed, nails digging into her palms. "This isn't over!"

Only then did the question strike her - why was Cassandra here? Had Nathan brought her? Was he considering... no. That couldn't be possible. She'd burn Cliffside Manor to the ground before letting that happen.
###Chapter 224

Though Victoria was cunning, her frail appearance and modest upbringing made Cassandra believe she could overpower her physically if needed.

But Evelyn was a different story.

That woman came from the prestigious Monarch Group and was trained in self-defense. If she reconciled with Nathan, Cassandra would become Evelyn's personal punching bag.

The thought sent chills down Cassandra's spine.

As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Why not ally with Victoria and let her and Evelyn destroy each other?

Decision made, Cassandra dialed Victoria's number.

"Vicky! Nathan brought Evelyn home, and they were disgustingly affectionate. I think you've officially lost your place in his heart."

Nathan had ordered the staff to clean Eleanor's room while Evelyn comforted the trembling girl.

"Eleanor, I'm here. You're safe now."

"Evie!"

Though twenty, Eleanor's autism made her seem much younger. She clung to Evelyn's sleeve desperately. "Don't go! Stay with me. I missed you so much..."

Evelyn stiffened, guilt twisting her stomach. She'd never told Eleanor her true identity.

Nathan observed them silently before stepping closer.

"Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn's voice turned glacial before he could speak. "I know you're busy. I know you despise this family. But you watched Eleanor grow up. She idolizes you. If you have even a shred of decency left, don't ignore Cassandra's abuse again!" Her eyes flashed. "Next time I catch her hurting Eleanor, I'll press assault charges."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

He rarely visited Cliffside Manor, consumed by work.

The realization that Cassandra tormented her own sister—that her displays of affection were just performances for Reginald—hit him like a physical blow.

"I swear it won't happen again," he vowed.

"Don't swear to me. I'm not the victim here."

The familiar sting of her words barely registered now.

After settling Eleanor, Evelyn followed Nathan to her old room—the same one she'd occupied during their three-year marriage.

She opened the wardrobe. Every gift she'd painstakingly chosen for him remained perfectly preserved.

Memories flooded her: lonely nights crafting handmade presents, the way he'd dismiss her without a glance. She'd carried their relationship alone.

A bitter smile touched her lips.

Once, she'd loved this man obsessively.

Now, he repulsed her.

"Do you have a box? I need to pack my—"

Nathan's arm shot past her head, slamming the wardrobe shut.

She looked up sharply. His cufflinks glinted dangerously as he caged her against the furniture.

"Nathan?" Her voice wavered.

He leaned down, breath grazing her ear. "Evelyn."

Her name rolled off his tongue like a dark promise, sending electric currents down her spine.

"If you want these things," he murmured, "answer one question." His fingers brushed her jaw. "Why did you marry me?"
###Chapter 225

"You're never going to give up, are you?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the car door handle, her knuckles turning white. She inhaled sharply, her eyes burning with barely contained fury. "I've said everything I needed to say. If you refuse to believe me, that's your problem."

"Did we meet before? A long time ago?"

Nathan's voice was urgent, desperate. He stepped closer, his broad frame nearly enveloping her slender figure. "Evelyn, answer me. Did we know each other before?"

Her heart twisted violently. The color drained from her lips. "You're imagining things. The first time we met was when your grandfather introduced us and suggested we marry. Before that, we were strangers."

She couldn't let him find out.

She couldn't let him know she was the girl he'd saved thirteen years ago.

Now that they were divorced, the thought of him discovering her thirteen-year-long obsession with him made her stomach churn. It was humiliating. Pathetic.

She had to preserve what little dignity she had left.

Disappointment flickered in Nathan's eyes. He had been so sure there was more to this.

"Let me go," Evelyn whispered, her voice unsteady. "I need to get my things and leave." She pulled the car door open.

"Evelyn, you—"

"Stop!" she snapped, her voice sharp as shattered glass. "Nathan, we're divorced. Do you understand what that means? Why are you digging up the past? So what if I was obsessed with you once? I don't love you anymore. Now, every time I see you—every time I see these stupid gifts I wasted my time on—it makes me sick!"

Obsessed with me.

Those three words echoed in Nathan's mind, drowning out everything else. His grip on her shoulders tightened, and he spun her around to face him.

His breath caught.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, glistening with unshed tears.

"You can cry if you need to," he said stiffly, though his gaze softened slightly.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "Cry? Can't you see I'm furious? Divorcing you was the best decision I ever made. I wake up laughing about it! Why the hell would I cry?"

Her glare was icy, her chest rising and falling with barely suppressed rage. "The moment I signed those papers, I swore I'd never waste another tear on you."

Her words struck him like a physical blow.

Before he could respond, a sharp knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

The butler's voice was deferential. "Ms. Sterling is here. She's waiting for you downstairs."

Evelyn's expression darkened.

Nathan's jaw clenched.

Downstairs, Victoria paced anxiously.

The staff exchanged nervous glances, whispering among themselves.

Everyone knew Nathan's ex-wife was still in the house. If the two women crossed paths, it would be a disaster.

"Nathan!"

The moment Victoria spotted him descending the stairs, she rushed forward and threw her arms around his waist, clinging to him like a lifeline.

Nathan instinctively tried to push her away, but she held on desperately, as if letting go would mean drowning.

"I missed you so much," she sobbed into his chest. "I—I made a mistake. I was just angry, and I lost my way. But you know me, Nathan. We grew up together!"

She was playing the only card she had left—their shared history.

She had planned to give him space, as Penelope suggested, to let his anger fade.

But the moment she heard Evelyn had come to Cliffside Manor, Victoria panicked.

She had to see him.

"Victoria."

Nathan's tone was colder than she'd ever heard it. "I told you we needed time apart. You should leave."
###Chapter 226

"Why?!" Evelyn Carter's voice trembled as tears cascaded down her porcelain cheeks.

Victoria Sterling had learned from Penelope Whitmore that playing the vulnerable card worked wonders on men like Nathan Blackwood.

"Indeed, why?"

A melodious voice suddenly rang from the upper floor.

All eyes turned to see Evelyn descending the grand staircase effortlessly, a single suitcase in hand. She held her head high, her posture radiating quiet dignity.

The contrast between Evelyn's composed elegance and Victoria's tear-streaked face couldn't have been more striking.

Victoria clung to Nathan's arm possessively. A venomous glint flashed in her eyes as they locked onto Evelyn's serene expression.

The household staff exchanged excited glances, sensing drama unfolding.

Nathan's dark eyes clouded momentarily. His hands hovered over Victoria's shoulders, fingers twitching as if to push her away.

But all Evelyn saw was their intimate embrace.

'Of course,' Evelyn thought bitterly. 'No wonder he insisted I come personally to collect my belongings. This little performance was meant for my benefit.'

At that moment, Evelyn wanted nothing more than to return home immediately, burn every stitch of clothing she wore, and scrub her skin raw.

Everything Nathan Blackwood touched felt contaminated.

"Ms. Sterling is your fiancée," Evelyn remarked coolly. "She traveled all this way to see you, and you're dismissing her? How cruel."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly.

Evelyn turned her dazzling smile toward Victoria. "Don't misunderstand, Ms. Sterling. I'm merely collecting my things. Please, don't let me interrupt your... reunion. Time flies when you're in love, doesn't it?"

Nathan's throat worked silently. His aristocratic features paled as frustration burned in his chest.

Victoria shot Evelyn a hateful glare, still smarting from her humiliation at Reginald Blackwood's birthday gala. She wouldn't risk another public confrontation.

"Oh, and regarding the items I left behind," Evelyn added airily, "particularly those gifts I once foolishly purchased for Mr. Blackwood - consider them trash. I've heard it's bad luck to keep an ex's belongings. Might interfere with your new... relationship."

With that casual explanation, Evelyn lifted her box and strode past them without a backward glance.

Victoria gaped. The servants exchanged shocked looks.

Nathan's ex-wife showed not a flicker of jealousy toward his fiancée. If anything, she seemed... relieved. What did that say about their marriage?

When Evelyn reached the grand foyer, Nathan finally snapped. He shoved Victoria away with such force that she stumbled backward, crashing into the coffee table. Porcelain shattered. Her designer dress ripped. Blood welled from cuts on her palms.

Upstairs, Cassandra Blackwood watched through the banisters, grinding her teeth in fury.

Evelyn stepped outside in her house slippers, the evening breeze lifting her hair.

"Evelyn! Wait!" Nathan's deep voice carried across the manicured lawns.

She didn't turn.

"Mr. Blackwood! I've brought Madam's shoes!"

Oliver Sinclair arrived breathless, clutching an expensive shopping bag.

Nathan snatched the bag and intercepted Evelyn's path. "Here," he said stiffly, offering the designer footwear.

Evelyn accepted the package without meeting his eyes. As she moved to walk past him, something unexpected happened.

Nathan's chest swelled with absurd pride. This marked the first time she'd taken anything from him since their divorce.

Then reality shattered his fragile hope.

With perfect aim, Evelyn swung the bag and launched the thousand-dollar shoes straight into the estate's trash compactor.

Oliver choked as if physically struck.

Nathan stood frozen, his expression crumbling like a man watching his heart get trampled.
###Chapter 227

Outside Cliffside Manor, Theodore Winslow paced restlessly, his polished oxfords wearing a path into the gravel. His concern for Evelyn gnawed at him like a persistent shadow.

When Evelyn emerged carrying a sleek leather case, Theodore rushed forward to relieve her of its weight.

"Ms. Carter, did that bastard Nathan Blackwood lay a finger on you?" His voice was sharp with protective fury.

Evelyn arched a brow, unimpressed. "Mind your language, Theo. What if you slip and say that in front of investors? I won't have my secretary embarrassing me at board meetings."

Theodore clenched his jaw. "Understood."

"That bastard wouldn't dare touch me." Evelyn flexed her fingers, knuckles popping ominously. "Unless he wants to lose the ability to father heirs."

Theodore winced. Then his gaze dropped to her feet. "Why are you wearing house slippers?"

"I left in a hurry."

Truthfully, there had been three pairs of designer heels lined up in the foyer—her old life waiting like ghosts. But Evelyn had deliberately stepped over them.

Those shoes belonged to Evelyn Carter, socialite and heiress. Not the docile wife Nathan had tried to mold.

She would never again wear the modest flats of a subdued housewife.

"Take me to Monarch Grand Hotel."

The Bugatti's engine snarled to life as Evelyn peeled away from the manor.

Upstairs, Nathan stood framed in the window of her former bedroom, his knuckles white against the sill. He watched the car vanish down the tree-lined drive, his chest hollow.

At the hotel, Evelyn maintained her icy composure. She and Theodore rode the private elevator to her executive suite.

The moment the doors opened, they froze.

Julian Montgomery lounged against the hallway wall, his inky dress shirt clinging to his sculpted torso. His jacket was slung over one shoulder, revealing a sheen of sweat on his collarbones.

"Julian?" Evelyn's eyes widened. "How did you get past security?"

"Took the stairs. Forty-two flights." He flashed a panting grin, raking damp hair from his forehead.

Theodore's lip curled. This peacock actually thought showing off his physique would impress Evelyn? As if she'd fall for such cheap theatrics.

Julian, as if reading his mind, deliberately tugged his collar lower and winked.

"Are my staff incompetent?" Evelyn's voice turned arctic. "How does an uninvited guest waltz into my private offices?"

Julian's smirk faltered. He'd meant to surprise her, not incur her wrath.

"I'll handle the disciplinary actions," Theodore said with barely concealed satisfaction.

"Wait! Don't punish them." Julian caught Evelyn's wrist. "I snuck past security. Blame me."

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "Deduct a month's salary from the front desk staff. And fire whichever guards were on duty."

She strode toward her office without a backward glance.

Theodore smirked at Julian's stunned expression.

"Evelyn—wait! Ms. Carter!" Julian scrambled after her, suddenly the picture of contrition. "I'm sorry. Punish me instead. I'll do anything—name it!"

Evelyn paused at her office door. "Julian."

He perked up like a scolded puppy granted reprieve.

"Inside. We need to talk."

Julian practically bounded after her, leaving Theodore to stand sentry outside, grinding his teeth.
###Chapter 228

Theodore, the loyal German Shepherd, whined pitifully when suddenly assigned guard duty outside Evelyn's office.

As the heavy oak door clicked shut, Evelyn strode confidently to the leather sofa. Her toned legs, porcelain under the studio lights, stretched elegantly as she settled into the plush cushions. One arm draped casually along the backrest while the other rested on her thigh - the picture of effortless power. Julian Montgomery's breath hitched at the sight.

His throat worked visibly as his gaze traced her commanding posture. The air crackled with her regal energy.

God, she was magnificent.

"See? I knew you wouldn't actually throw me out," Julian smirked, his dimples flashing. He took a step forward, only to freeze when Evelyn's voice sliced through the air like tempered steel.

"Julian. Did I stutter when I said I wasn't interested?"

The playboy's charming expression shattered.

"The old Evelyn Carter might've tolerated your nonsense out of gratitude. But Evelyn Kingsley?" Her manicured fingers tapped the armrest. "She doesn't suffer fools."

Her glacial stare could've flash-frozen the Mediterranean. Julian actually shivered.

Desperation clawed at his chest as he advanced again. One razor-sharp glare from Evelyn pinned him in place like a butterfly specimen.

"You're still the same woman beneath the Kingsley name!" Julian's voice cracked. "How can paperwork erase everything between us?"

"The moment those divorce papers were signed, Evelyn Carter ceased to exist." Her crimson lips twisted. "Neither you nor Nathan deserve space in my life. Save your charm for someone impressionable, Mr. Montgomery. I'm immune."

"What did I do wrong?" Julian's knuckles whitened around his car keys. "Just tell me how to fix this!"

A dangerous glint entered Evelyn's eyes. "Let's discuss Eleanor Blackwood's birthday party, shall we?"

Julian's tan complexion paled to parchment. The memory flooded back - Eleanor's drugged state, her feverish skin beneath his palms, the way she'd clung to him in the moonlit gardens...

"That wasn't—"

"Save it." Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "The Blackwoods had staff everywhere that night. You could've called for help instead of playing hero with your zipper."

Julian's Armani shirt clung to his damp back. "She initiated everything! I stopped before—"

"Eleanor's not some club floozy you can use and discard." Evelyn's voice dropped to a lethal purr. "That fragile girl sees you as Prince Charming. And you treated her like another notch on your bedpost."

The fight drained from Julian's posture. He recognized that look - the same one boardroom rivals saw before Evelyn dismantled them.

"Unlike your usual conquests, Eleanor actually believes in love." Evelyn rose, smoothing her pencil skirt. "Now get out before I have security remove you. Theodore?"

"Evelyn, please!"

Julian lunged forward—

And found himself staring down the gleaming blade of a custom Damascus steel stiletto pressed against his jugular.
###Chapter 229

Julian Montgomery's face drained of color in an instant.

He hadn't noticed when Evelyn had drawn the blade. Before he could react, the cold steel was already pressed against his throat.

The butterfly knife was notorious—a silent, deadly weapon. A single flick of the wrist could be fatal.

And Evelyn had chosen to use it on Julian. Ruthless.

"Stop bothering me, Julian."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, tapping his cheek lightly with the sharp edge. "Even if you were the last man on earth, I wouldn’t pick you."

"But if there were only two men left—me and Nathan—who would you choose?" Julian's voice trembled, his pulse racing beneath the blade.

Evelyn smirked. "Still not you."

Julian, always so proud and unshakable, felt his pride shatter into a million pieces.

The office door swung open.

"Evelyn, what are you doing?" Sebastian Kingsley stood in the doorway, stunned.

Evelyn's expression shifted instantly. She retracted the knife with a fluid motion and beamed at her brother.

"Seb, you didn’t tell me you were coming!"

The transformation was so swift Julian barely processed it.

He rose stiffly, casting one last devastated glance at Evelyn before storming out, his eyes burning with humiliation.

Sebastian watched him go, recognizing the utter defeat in the usually arrogant prince. He sighed, unsure whether to laugh or pity him.

In all of Crestview, only Evelyn Carter could reduce Julian Montgomery to this state.

"Seb!"

Evelyn threw her arms around Sebastian's neck, her earlier ferocity gone. "How are you? Is your injury healed?"

"What do you think? I don’t even need bandages anymore."

Sebastian lifted her off the ground, spinning her playfully like he used to when they were children. "Just a scratch. Your brother isn’t that fragile."

Of course not. Even Harrison would be shocked if he knew Sebastian’s past.

Who would guess that this gentle, composed man had once been a crime lord?

Years ago, something had made Sebastian abandon that life. He turned over a new leaf, dedicating himself to morality and faith, severing all ties with his dark history.

Evelyn still couldn’t reconcile it—how a man who never harmed anyone, never drank or smoked, could have led an underworld empire.

There had to be a secret buried beneath her brother’s serene smile.

"What happened between you and Mr. Montgomery?"

Sebastian chuckled. "Julian may be ruthless with others, but he’s sincere with you. Even if you don’t want him, you shouldn’t humiliate him with a knife. A man needs his pride—especially the heir of the Montgomery family."

"If I didn’t, he’d never give up."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. "Most men back off when rejected, but Julian? Relentless. If I hadn’t scared him off, he’d keep chasing me. Now that I’m Evelyn Carter again, I refuse to be tangled with Nathan’s circle. I know I went too far, but it had to be done. Better to end it brutally than let it fester."

"Sometimes I wish Anna Brown and Evelyn Carter could merge into one," Sebastian murmured.

"Impossible. I buried Anna for good."

Exhausted, Evelyn slumped onto Sebastian’s lap.

He smiled, his elegant fingers massaging her temples.

"Seb, did you come because you have news?" She closed her eyes, relaxing under his touch.

"You’ve always been the cleverest. You already know."

"Have you found a way to handle the Blackwoods?" she asked lazily.

"If Victoria Sterling is too much trouble, I can deal with her." Sebastian’s tone was light, but his eyes held something darker.

"No. Victoria is mine." Evelyn’s eyes slitted like a predator’s. "If I let you handle her, I’d regret it. She dared to cross me—she’ll pay for it personally."
###Chapter 230

Sebastian's warm eyes crinkled at the corners as he passed a folder to Evelyn.

"What's this?"

Evelyn took it skeptically, flipping through the pages. Her expression instantly brightened.

"Blackwood Industries secured the Westridge project, and Leonard handed it over to Penelope. The estimated value is in the billions, with massive profits—and plenty of underhanded dealings involved. It's the perfect chance to expand Monarch Group's influence in Crestview."

Sebastian leaned in, his voice low. "More importantly, Penelope is using this project to climb the corporate ladder and challenge Nathan. She may have been an actress before, but her ambitions are ruthless. With Leonard's favor, she's aiming for control of Blackwood Industries."

"Control of Blackwood Industries?" Evelyn scoffed, her eyes glinting with determination. "How delusional. Does she really think she can handle that kind of power?"

She traced a finger over the documents. "Grandfather built Blackwood Industries from the ground up. Even if Nathan isn't the ideal successor, Penelope has no right to take what isn't hers."

"Study this carefully," Sebastian advised. "Leonard and Penelope are meeting Mayor Harrington at 1 PM the day after tomorrow at the Blackwood golf course in Crestview's western suburbs. They’ll likely be pushing the Westridge project."

He wrapped an arm around Evelyn’s shoulders, his expression solemn. "Evelyn, this is your chance to settle the score for me."

She smirked, tilting her head against his shoulder. "I know exactly what you're doing. You’ve laid the groundwork so I can strike back. You’re treating me like a kid, handing me an easy win."

"Evelyn, don’t call me out like that!" He pinched her cheek playfully.

"Sebastian, I’m not a child anymore. I’m twenty-four, and I’ve already been married and divorced." She turned to face him seriously. "You’ve all sacrificed too much for me. Let me protect you now. Monarch Group is my responsibility."

Meanwhile, Victoria Sterling—humiliated by Nathan earlier that day—stormed into her penthouse and immediately dialed Penelope. Tears streamed down her face as she sobbed into the phone.

"Serves you right!" Penelope snapped, her voice sharp with irritation. "I told you to stay away from Nathan while he’s still angry. But no, you just had to provoke him! Now that he’s rejected you, who else can you blame but yourself? Crying won’t fix anything!"

"But that witch Evelyn was at Cliffside Manor! Nathan brought her back like she still belongs there!" Victoria wailed. "She’s mocking me! How am I supposed to just take that?"

"You take it because you have to!" Penelope hissed. "I made everything clear to you. Why can’t you get it through your head? If you want to be Mrs. Blackwood, you need to be smart. All you do is throw tantrums and cry. You’re wasting all my efforts!"

Her voice turned icy. "Your goal is to be the wife of Blackwood Industries' CEO, not some lovesick fool pining after Nathan. If Evelyn Carter spat in your face, you’d smile and thank her if it got you closer to that title!"

"But—"

"Enough!" Penelope cut her off. "I’ll handle things from here. Right now, I’m securing my position on the board. Don’t disturb me again."

The line went dead.

Victoria collapsed onto her bed, gripping her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

Then, her phone rang again.

An unknown number.

She wiped her tears and answered sharply. "Who is this?"

"Adrienne, it’s been a while. How’s life in Crestview treating you?"

A man’s smooth, mocking voice sent a chill down her spine.

Victoria’s face drained of color.

Adrienne—the name she’d used during her wild days in Silvercrest.

After returning to Nathan, she’d erased all traces of her past—deleted social media, changed numbers, burned every bridge. Back then, she’d been reckless, careless.

She never expected him to find her.

"I’ve missed you, darling," the man purred. "Should I come to you, or will you meet me?"

His tone was light, but the threat was unmistakable.

Victoria’s silk blouse clung to her back, damp with cold sweat. Her throat tightened as if invisible hands were squeezing it.

"Where are you?" she forced out. "I’ll come to you."
###Chapter 231

The neon lights of Velvet Lounge flickered through the smoky air as Victoria Sterling slipped inside unnoticed. Dressed in an oversized hoodie and ripped jeans, she looked nothing like the glamorous socialite the tabloids adored.

Every other woman in the club wore sequined mini dresses with stiletto heels that could puncture concrete. Victoria's plain appearance made her stick out like a sore thumb in the sea of glitter.

A sudden waft of whiskey-laden breath made her stiffen. The scent of cheap cologne assaulted her senses before she even saw him.

"Adrienne, darling." The voice dripped with false sweetness. "Still as breathtaking as the day we met in Silvercrest."

Victoria recoiled as Dominic Reeves slid into the booth beside her. His muscular arms, once so appealing, now repulsed her. How had she ever found this man attractive?

Every fiber of her being screamed to run. Memories of their toxic relationship in Silvercrest came flooding back - the manipulation, the empty promises, the way he'd drain her bank account dry.

"Cut the crap," she hissed, keeping her voice low. "What do you want?"

Dominic's grin turned predatory. "Straight to business, I see." His fingers traced circles on the sticky table. "Five million should cover my... discretion about certain... events from our past."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. "You got your payoff when we ended things."

"Gambling debts don't pay themselves, sweetheart." He leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. "And I'm sure Nathan Blackwood would find our little... love child fascinating."

The mention of her daughter sent ice through Victoria's veins. That mistake - born from Dominic's lies about protection - still haunted her darkest nightmares.

"You bastard," she whispered, voice trembling with rage. "That was your fault!"

Dominic merely chuckled, swirling the drink he'd stolen from her. "Our daughter is proof of what we shared. Without her, we wouldn't be having this... reunion."

Victoria's mind raced. She could see the desperation beneath Dominic's bravado - the sweat on his brow, the slight tremor in his hands. This wasn't just about money; he was drowning.

Suddenly, an idea struck. Victoria let her shoulders slump, allowing tears to well in her eyes. "It's over between Nathan and me," she confessed, voice breaking. "He's calling off the wedding."

Dominic's smug expression faltered. "What? Why?"

"The Blackwoods found out about my family's financial troubles." She dabbed at imaginary tears. "Without Nathan's backing, I'm ruined."

Panic flashed across Dominic's face. Victoria could practically see the calculations in his head - no wealthy fiancé meant no payout.

She pressed her advantage, leaning into him with a sigh. "But maybe... if we worked together..." Her fingers trailed up his arm. "You always were the clever one, Dominic."

His eyes lit with greedy interest. Victoria hid her disgust behind a coy smile, already plotting how to turn this snake against itself. The game had just begun.
###Chapter 232

Victoria Sterling's ex-lover clenched his fists. "I'm not stupid enough to fight in those illegal underground matches! I'll keep squeezing money out of Victoria instead."

The truth was simple - Nathan Blackwood had moved on with someone new.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face, her eyes bloodshot. "He doesn't love me anymore. What can I do? I'm barely surviving myself now. Even if you threaten to kill me, I have nothing left to give."

"Is there really no other way?" Her ex's face twisted with desperation, as if he was the one who'd lost Nathan's affection.

Victoria's swollen eyes gleamed with sudden malice. "If that woman disappeared... Nathan might reconsider me."

"You want me to..." He drew a finger across his throat.

"She's the only thing standing between me and Nathan. Once she's gone, he'll marry me. Then I can give you anything." Victoria's icy fingers traced his jawline, her gaze hypnotic. "Fifty million dollars. However much you want."

"Fifty million?!" Greed flashed in his eyes as he pinned her against the wall. "Who is she? Give me the name."

The next morning, Nathan stood in his corner office at Blackwood Industries, staring through floor-to-ceiling windows at Crestview's skyline. The untouched coffee in his hand had gone cold.

"This is outrageous! What is Leonard thinking?" Oliver Sinclair crumpled the draft appointment letter bearing Penelope Whitmore's name. "That gold-digging actress has no qualifications! If she deserves to be Vice Chair, I deserve to walk on water!"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Leonard assigned her to the Westridge project specifically to pave her way onto the board."

A bitter taste filled his mouth as he forced down the cold coffee.

"Doesn't the Chairman trust you at all?" Oliver's voice shook with anger. "Your brother can't even manage his own health, let alone the company! No matter how much Leonard favors him, it's pointless. You're his son too - why does he keep sabotaging you? Using Penelope to spy on you... What kind of father does that?"

"Enough, Oliver." Nathan massaged his temples. "I appreciate your loyalty, but these words stay in this room."

"What's our move then, Mr. Blackwood?" Oliver asked through gritted teeth.

"I'd planned to reveal certain things gradually." Nathan's knuckles whitened around his coffee cup. "But if Leonard wants to play this game, I'll have to accelerate my plans."

His phone buzzed. Julian Montgomery's name flashed on the screen.

Too irritated to talk, Nathan almost ignored it - but the persistent buzzing grated on his nerves.

"What?"

"Nathan... I'm devastated." Julian's voice sounded hollow. "Can you... be with me tonight?"

"Go to hell." Nathan's reply was ice.

"Wait!" Julian's panicked shout stopped him from hanging up. "Evelyn dumped me! For real this time - she held a knife to my throat! It's over... My love... My heart... She's really gone..."

A smirk tugged at Nathan's lips.

"Serves you right."
###Chapter 233

To advance the Westridge project, Leonard Blackwood arranged an exclusive golf outing with Mayor Harrington and his wife at the prestigious Silvercrest Country Club.

The private course, typically reserved for elite clientele, appeared completely deserted today—a clear sign it had been booked for this high-profile gathering. Only the Blackwoods and Harringtons occupied the lush greens.

Cassandra Blackwood had never been skilled at golf, but that didn't stop her from dressing the part. Her pristine white golf ensemble and subtle makeup made her look more like Penelope Whitmore's younger sister than her daughter.

The entire purpose of bringing Cassandra was to introduce her to the Harringtons. At twenty-five, she was prime marriage material, and Penelope wasn't about to let her daughter's obsession with Julian Montgomery ruin potential alliances.

"Hello, Mayor Harrington, Mrs. Harrington." Cassandra executed a flawless curtsy, her smile perfectly practiced.

"Oh, this must be your daughter!" Mrs. Harrington beamed. "Even more stunning in person than on television!"

Both Penelope and Cassandra's smiles faltered.

Though Mrs. Harrington meant no harm, the comment unintentionally referenced Cassandra's humiliating public apology—a scandal that still spawned mocking memes across social media.

The mayor cleared his throat sharply, shooting his wife a warning glance.

"Ah—what I meant was," Mrs. Harrington corrected hastily, "your daughter is absolutely radiant. Truly, one of Crestview's most beautiful socialites."

"Thank you, Mrs. Harrington," Penelope replied smoothly, pulling Cassandra closer. "Where is your son today? I heard he and Cassandra attended the same university."

"He's tied up with official duties," Mrs. Harrington said dismissively.

"What a shame. We must arrange another meeting soon." Penelope's tone was honeyed, though her grip on Cassandra's arm tightened.

"Of course, whenever convenient," Mrs. Harrington agreed halfheartedly before abruptly shifting topics. "By the way, I heard you have another daughter. Why didn’t she join?"

Cassandra's smile nearly shattered.

So she doesn’t like me? Fine. But dragging Eleanor into this? Unforgivable.

Penelope maintained her composure. "My youngest is quite frail. She prefers staying home with her medications. Social events overwhelm her."

"Oh dear, what ails her so young? Is it serious?"

"Controllable with treatment," Penelope replied coolly, recognizing the unspoken implication—Mrs. Harrington was already considering Eleanor as a backup option.

As if my daughters are goods on a shelf for you to browse!

Meanwhile, Leonard and Nathan had finished several rounds with the mayor, strolling across the manicured lawn in casual conversation.

"Mayor Harrington, securing the Westridge project wouldn’t have been possible without your support," Leonard said, shaking his hand warmly.

"Nonsense! We’ve collaborated for years. When a prime opportunity arises, you’re my first call." Their decade-long friendship made the mayor unusually amiable.

"Let’s celebrate tonight—drinks on me!"

"Ah, tonight’s my father-in-law’s birthday. Non-negotiable attendance." The mayor chuckled. "Save the revelry for Friday’s contract signing. We’ll toast properly then!"

Nathan listened in silence, his expression unreadable, though pressure coiled in his chest.

He had until Friday.

Time was running out.

Exposing Penelope’s schemes wouldn’t suffice—Leonard would bury any scandal to protect the family name. Nathan needed an explosion too big to conceal.

Just then, a golf cart screeched to a halt before them.
###Chapter 234

"Good afternoon, Mayor Harrington and Chairman Blackwood!"

A melodious voice, crisp as silver bells, drifted into Nathan's ears.

Nathan's eyes snapped open to find Evelyn seated elegantly in the golf cart beside him.

His pulse quickened, blood rushing through his veins like wildfire.

Despite yesterday's humiliating encounter, he seemed utterly unaffected—as if the memory had been wiped clean from his mind.

The entire group froze. Cassandra couldn't contain herself. "How did you get past security?!"

"VIP access, darling." Evelyn tilted her head, her calm demeanor contrasting sharply with Cassandra's rising fury. "The main entrance welcomes me whenever I please."

Cassandra's face burned with remembered shame. That thrashing with slippers had left psychological scars no amount of makeup could cover.

Penelope's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Leonard's reaction was more measured, though equally startled.

But Mrs. Harrington's eyes lit up like Christmas lights. "Good heavens! Where has this exquisite creature been hiding?" she whispered to her husband. "She's absolute perfection—exactly the sort of girl I'd want for our—"

Theodore stepped forward first, offering his hand to help Evelyn descend.

She wore a sky-blue golf ensemble with a wide-brimmed white hat that framed her delicate features perfectly. The playful breeze caught her pleated mini skirt, revealing toned legs that drew every male gaze in the vicinity.

Nathan's jaw tightened when he noticed their matching color scheme—his polo shirt the exact same shade as her outfit, creating an unintentional couple's look.

His dark eyes smoldered with renewed hunger.

Evelyn was devastatingly beautiful—a fact that never failed to punch him in the gut.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Ms. Kingsley." Leonard recovered first, offering a polite smile though confusion creased his forehead.

"Oh, this isn't accidental, Chairman Blackwood." Evelyn clasped her hands behind her back, her confident gaze locking onto the mayor. "I came specifically to speak with Mayor Harrington."

A collective intake of breath.

Nathan's entire body went rigid, his expression turning glacial.

After their recent encounters, he'd learned to read Evelyn's patterns. She moved like a chess grandmaster—every appearance calculated, every word loaded with implication.

His mind raced. What was her play this time?

"Mayor Harrington," Evelyn continued smoothly, "I understand you're overseeing the Westridge development project and currently evaluating potential partners." Her lips curved into a victorious smile. "Monarch Group would be honored to collaborate in transforming Westridge into the crown jewel of Crestview."

Shockwaves rippled through the group.

Leonard and Penelope exchanged bewildered glances.

The mayor blinked owlishly, looking between Nathan and Leonard for guidance.

Nathan studied Evelyn's poised figure, his mouth suddenly dry as desert sand. But she didn't grant him so much as a sideways glance.

"Miss, you are...?" The mayor hesitated.

"Evelyn Kingsley." She extended a graceful hand. "My father is Harrison Kingsley, Chairman of Monarch Group in Fairhaven."

The mayor's initial dismissive expression transformed into one of startled recognition at the mention of the powerful conglomerate.
###Chapter 235

The words struck Mayor Harrington and his wife like a bolt of lightning.

She was the daughter of Harrison Kingsley, the wealthiest man in Fairhaven?

"Are you truly Chairman Kingsley's daughter?" Mayor Harrington couldn't hide his astonishment, his gaze fixed on Evelyn.

Theodore Winslow cleared his throat, amused. Most people flaunt diamonds, but Ms. Carter wields her father's name like a weapon.

"Yes. You can verify this with the Blackwoods if you'd like."

Evelyn's smile deepened. "I've had business dealings with Blackwood Industries before. They can confirm my identity."

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened as he watched her.

She didn’t even acknowledge their past—as if they were nothing more than competitors.

"Chairman Blackwood—Nathan—you're acquainted with Ms. Kingsley?"

Mayor Harrington, ever the politician, immediately adjusted his tone upon learning Evelyn's lineage. "My apologies for not recognizing you earlier." He extended his hand eagerly.

"Mayor Harrington, does my current standing qualify me to discuss this project with you?" Evelyn's smile remained, but her gaze sharpened with authority.

The mayor stiffened.

Despite her youth, she carried the same commanding presence as her father. He couldn’t afford to underestimate her.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his fists tightening. She’s using her father’s name to bulldoze her way in. Does she think business is some childish game she can interrupt whenever she pleases?

"Ms. Kingsley, your presence is an honor," Leonard Blackwood interjected smoothly, though his eyes were ice. "However, Mayor Harrington and I have confidential matters to discuss. As an outsider, you wouldn’t be privy to such details. Would you kindly grant us privacy?"

Cassandra Blackwood seethed but was restrained by Penelope Whitmore.

Let Leonard handle this, Penelope thought smugly. Evelyn is overstepping, and my husband will put her in her place.

"Mr. Blackwood, I’m aware this concerns the Westridge project. If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t be here either."

Evelyn arched a brow, unshaken. "And why shouldn’t I participate? Monarch Group’s resources and capital rival Blackwood Industries. Any project you can handle, we can too. Isn’t it only fair that Mayor Harrington has options?"

The mayor blinked. She came prepared.

Leonard and Penelope’s expressions soured.

"Ms. Kingsley."

Nathan finally stepped forward, looming over her. "Blackwood Industries has already reached an agreement with Mayor Harrington. Every detail has been negotiated to meet Westridge’s standards. By interfering now, you’re disregarding business etiquette and creating unnecessary conflict."

Evelyn tilted her head, her bright eyes glinting. "Stealing your project? You’re absolutely right. That’s exactly what I’m doing."

"Evelyn!" Nathan’s jaw clenched.

"But I disagree about violating etiquette or causing trouble."

She stepped back, escaping his shadow, putting deliberate distance between them. "Rules are written by the victors. If you’d already signed the contract, then yes—I’d be out of line. But as it stands, no agreement is final. The rules this time? They’re still being decided."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. He had no rebuttal.

She was right. Before ink met paper, everything was negotiable. He’d exploited that principle for years, crushing competitors effortlessly.

Now, the tables had turned.

And his opponent was his ex-wife.

"Ms. Kingsley, I doubt Mayor Harrington will choose you."

Penelope couldn’t contain herself. "Our families have been close for years. Our partnership is built on trust—something outsiders can’t replicate."
###Chapter 236

Evelyn's lips curled into a sly smile as she adjusted the strap of her designer handbag. "Ms. Blackwood, you mentioned wanting to discuss a collaboration, yet you barged in unannounced. No appointment, no courtesy—just a desperate attempt to corner Mayor Harrington. How... unprofessional."

Cassandra scoffed from beside her mother. "Exactly!"

Evelyn sighed dramatically, her fingers tapping against her thigh. "I know my arrival is unexpected, but time is of the essence. If I delay any longer, Mayor Harrington might make a decision he'll deeply regret."

"Regret?" Penelope's voice sharpened. "What are you implying?"

Ignoring her completely, Evelyn locked eyes with the mayor. "Mayor Harrington, is Monarch Group truly not worth your consideration? Or is it because I'm a woman that you assume I lack authority within my family's corporation?" She tilted her head, her tone dripping with faux innocence. "My eldest brother, Sebastian Kingsley—CEO of Monarch Group—entrusted this matter entirely to me. If you doubt my word, I can arrange for him to meet you immediately."

The mayor shifted uncomfortably. "Ms. Kingsley, it's not that I don't trust you. But Leonard Blackwood and I have a long-standing partnership. Blackwood Industries is a well-established name in Crestview. Perhaps another time—"

A smug smirk played on Leonard and Penelope's faces.

How laughable. This naive girl actually thought she could waltz in and steal a project right from under them.

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "I understand. Pre-existing relationships do complicate things." She leaned in slightly, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. "But let me assure you—cooperating with Monarch Group guarantees one thing."

Her eyes gleamed with mischief. "You won't regret it."

Nathan's pulse spiked.

That look. That tone. He knew that expression—Evelyn was about to drop a bomb.

"Ms. Kingsley," Penelope snapped, "are you suggesting there's something wrong with working with Blackwood Industries?"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Theodore, what time is it?"

"Three o'clock, Miss," her secretary replied smoothly.

"Perfect." She gestured toward his phone. "Show Mayor Harrington the three o'clock news, would you?"

Theodore tapped his screen, and a reporter's voice filled the air.

"Breaking news: Vincent Whitmore, deputy general manager of Blackwood Industries, was arrested this afternoon on charges of bribery and illegal bid-rigging in connection with multiple high-profile projects. Sources confirm Mr. Whitmore is the cousin of Penelope Whitmore, wife of Blackwood Industries' chairman. Investigators are now looking into potential accomplices—"

Leonard's face drained of color. Penelope swayed, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

"Mom!" Cassandra gasped. "What the hell is going on?!"

Nathan watched Evelyn's serene expression with amusement.

The arrest had happened two hours ago—yet the news had been suppressed until now.

No doubt her brother Dominic, the prosecutor, had pulled strings to keep it quiet.

"Penelope," Leonard hissed, "explain this."

"I—I don't know anything!" Penelope's voice cracked. "Mayor Harrington, Mrs. Harrington, this is all a misunderstanding! Fake news!"

Mrs. Harrington's lips thinned. "Is Vincent Whitmore really your cousin? And were you involved in these projects?"

Before Penelope could respond, a group of suited men approached—badges glinting in the sunlight.

"Ms. Whitmore," the lead investigator announced, "you're needed for questioning regarding your cousin's case."

Evelyn sipped her sparkling water, savoring the chaos.

Checkmate.
###Chapter 237

Evelyn watched with satisfaction as Penelope Whitmore's carefully constructed facade crumbled before her eyes.

The scene unfolded like a perfectly choreographed play. First Vincent Whitmore's arrest, then the damning news coverage about Blackwood Industries, and finally the prosecutors leading Penelope away in handcuffs.

"You can't do this! I demand to know what evidence you have!" Penelope shrieked, her manicured nails digging into the prosecutor's sleeve.

Cassandra Blackwood stood frozen, her face as pale as the marble statues lining the golf course. The usually poised socialite looked like she might faint at any moment.

"Leonard! Do something!" Penelope's desperate cry echoed across the manicured lawns, her tears leaving dark stains on the emerald grass.

Leonard Blackwood's face flushed crimson with impotent rage. Torn between maintaining his dignity and defending his wife, he turned his fury on Evelyn instead. "Ms. Carter! Explain yourself!"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Why are you shouting at me, Chairman Blackwood? The prosecutors work independently. I have no control over their actions."

"Then how did you know about the news broadcast? Your earlier comments were far too specific to be coincidence!" Leonard's voice shook with barely contained anger.

"Monarch Group has extensive media connections," Evelyn replied smoothly, her lips curving into a mocking smile. "If the press knew, why wouldn't we?"

Leonard's entire body trembled with rage. "Ms. Carter, just because your marriage to Nathan ended doesn't give you the right to destroy my family! Some relationships simply aren't meant to be!"

Mayor Harrington and his wife exchanged shocked glances. The revelation of a failed marriage alliance between the Carters and Blackwoods sent silent ripples through the gathered elite.

"Your bitterness over the divorce has made you vindictive," Leonard spat. "Attacking Blackwood Industries like this shows your true petty nature."

The insult hung in the air like poison. Theodore Winslow stiffened beside Evelyn, ready to defend his employer.

But Nathan moved first.

Stepping between Evelyn and his father, Nathan's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Father, your accusations are baseless. Unless you have proof, you will apologize to Ms. Carter."

"Nathan! You're defending her?" Leonard's eyes bulged with disbelief. "After everything she's done? After how she humiliated our family?"

Nathan's gaze remained steady. He turned slightly, his dark eyes meeting Evelyn's with an intensity that made her pulse quicken despite herself.

"I know she didn't do this," Nathan declared, his voice carrying across the silent gathering. "Divorced or not, I won't stand by while she's falsely accused."

He added with quiet conviction, "And even if we were still married, no one - not even you - would speak to my wife that way."

Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically, pressing her fingers against her ears. "Enough of this nonsense!"

Leonard looked apoplectic, his face turning an alarming shade of purple. Evelyn could practically see his blood pressure skyrocketing.

Strangely warmed by Nathan's unexpected defense despite herself, Evelyn decided she'd had enough entertainment for one afternoon.

"Given today's... developments," she said with deliberate understatement, "I'll leave you to your family matters. Theodore?"

As she turned to leave, Mayor Harrington came rushing after her, mopping his brow with a silk handkerchief. "Ms. Carter! About the Westridge project - we must discuss this further!"

Evelyn paused, allowing a small, victorious smile. "I'll have my office schedule a meeting. Expect my call within forty-eight hours."

"Absolutely! My door is always open!" The mayor practically bowed in his eagerness.

"Perhaps my son could join us?" Mrs. Harrington added hastily, her smile ingratiating. "He'd be honored to make your acquaintance."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his jaw clenching as he watched the scene unfold. The possessive glint in his eyes went unnoticed by everyone except Evelyn, who suppressed a smirk.

This powerful, beautiful woman needed to be kept safely away from prying eyes, Nathan thought grimly. Every time she appeared in public, she attracted unwanted attention like moths to a flame.
###Chapter 238

"Mrs. Harrington, I truly appreciate your kindness."

Evelyn smiled faintly, her tone light but firm. "But I'm a divorcee—my current status is rather complicated. Besides, I have no intention of remarrying anytime soon. It wouldn’t be fair to lead your son on."

"What nonsense! What’s wrong with being divorced?" Mrs. Harrington scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. "Even so, you're still a thousand times better than those vapid young socialites who only care about appearances!"

Cassandra’s cheeks burned with humiliation. She clenched her fists, resentment simmering in her chest. Evelyn was like the blinding sun—wherever she went, everything else faded into insignificance.

The golf cart rolled away, leaving Evelyn to slip free effortlessly while the Blackwoods were left to deal with the wreckage she’d left behind.

"Chairman Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, "I think it’s best we forget about the Westridge project for now. Perhaps we can revisit cooperation on a more suitable venture in the future."

Mayor Harrington and his wife departed hastily, their expressions tight with displeasure.

If anything went wrong with the projects under his jurisdiction, the consequences would be severe.

Just as Leonard stood frozen in shock, he realized Nathan had vanished without a trace.

In the locker room, Evelyn shed her youthful golf attire, transforming back into the poised, untouchable heiress. She flipped her dark hair over her shoulder and strode out in her stilettos, every step radiating confidence.

The moment she turned the corner, she collided with a towering figure—one that sent an involuntary shiver down her spine.

Her pulse fluttered, but she met Nathan’s icy gaze without flinching, her own expression unreadable.

"Mr. Blackwood," she drawled, arching a brow. "Since when did you develop a habit of lurking outside women’s locker rooms?"

"Evelyn," he bit out, his voice low and rough, "you won’t get the Westridge project."

His gaze dropped to her lips, soft and tempting, stirring something dangerous inside him. "That project belongs to Blackwood Industries. I won’t let you interfere."

"Oh?" She smirked, tilting her head. "And what exactly can you do? Blackwood’s reputation is in tatters. With the Whitmore scandal, the prosecutors will be digging into your company’s affairs. You can’t sign any contracts during an investigation—even if you wanted to keep it, you’re powerless."

Her smile was razor-sharp.

"You keep insisting we’re strangers after the divorce," Nathan growled, stepping closer until his arms caged her against the wall, his chest heaving. "Yet here you are, picking fights with me. Is this how you get your satisfaction? By tearing me down? Is this your idea of revenge?"

Evelyn’s lips curled, her eyes glinting with frost. "So that’s what you think?"

She leaned in, her breath brushing his ear as she whispered, "Then why did you play the hero earlier? That righteous act of yours is nauseating."

"Nauseating?" Nathan’s jaw clenched, fury and frustration warring inside him.

No matter what he did, her words always found their mark, cutting deeper than any blade.

"Evelyn," he warned, voice dangerously soft, "don’t push me to retaliate."

He closed the distance between them, his gaze locked onto hers. "Don’t think our past marriage will earn you any mercy in business. I’ll treat you just like any other opponent."

Evelyn blinked, unfazed. If anything, she looked exhilarated. "Good. That’s exactly what I want, Mr. Blackwood. If I make a move, you should strike back. Otherwise, this game would be dreadfully dull."

She rose onto her toes, her lips brushing his ear as she murmured, "Oh, and one more thing—"

Nathan stiffened, his skin burning where her breath touched him.

"I handed over all the evidence of Vincent’s crimes to the prosecutors. The media already has the story. Honestly, you should thank me. Now your dear stepmother’s little power play for the board will crumble before it even begins."

Nathan’s mind reeled. It felt like a dull knife twisting in his chest.

"Business is war, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn purred, stepping back. "If you don’t fight with everything you have, you’ll lose spectacularly. And next time I strike?" Her smile turned lethal. "I promise, it’ll be far more ruthless than this."

With that, she shoved past him, her victory absolute.

Nathan stood rooted in place, his vision tinged with red.

He couldn’t breathe.
###Chapter 239

Within mere hours, scandalous headlines about Blackwood Industries dominated every news outlet, skyrocketing to the top of trending topics.

Penelope Whitmore's disgraceful arrest on the golf course had been captured on video and leaked online, spreading like wildfire across social media.

A corporation as powerful as Blackwood Industries could usually pressure media outlets to bury unfavorable stories.

But Evelyn had struck first. By the time the Blackwoods mobilized their damage control, it was already too late.

Even their strongest influence couldn’t suppress the storm now.

The majority shareholder behind Spotlight News was Monarch Group. That meant they could loop footage of Penelope’s arrest on a 24-hour broadcast if Evelyn demanded it.

Creative netizens had already turned Penelope and Cassandra’s humiliation into viral memes. Someone had even edited their public missteps into a ridiculous zumba routine set to upbeat music.

Meanwhile, Leonard Blackwood scrambled to bail Penelope out, desperate to contain the PR disaster.

Evelyn, victorious in this first skirmish, returned to Monarch Grand Hotel in high spirits.

She indulged in an extravagant afternoon tea before settling into her office, gaming while video-calling Sebastian to gloat about her triumph.

"I’ve reserved the private dining room at our hotel’s restaurant. Let’s meet with Mayor Harrington the day after tomorrow—I want the Westridge project finalized by the end of the week!"

Evelyn was in her element, gleefully annihilating zombies in her game.

"Dominic’s interrogating Penelope now. Don’t let his usual playboy act fool you—when it comes to work, he’s ruthless. He won’t let her go until he’s wrung out every useful detail."

On-screen, Sebastian sat in his CEO office, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. His warm smile couldn’t mask the natural authority radiating from him.

"It won’t matter. She’ll still walk free in the end," Evelyn said confidently.

"Do you want her to walk free?" Sebastian’s tone was skeptical.

"What difference would it make? We don’t have enough to convict her."

Evelyn smirked as her in-game character revved a chainsaw, slicing through a zombie. "Penelope didn’t rise this high just because Leonard favors her. She’s cunning. She and her cousin Vincent Whitmore embezzled for years—Vincent took the fall while she stayed in the shadows, reaping the rewards. She’s a master manipulator."

Sebastian nodded thoughtfully. "A shame, then."

"Not at all."

Evelyn’s crimson lips curled into a dazzling smile. "As long as we profit, I’m satisfied. Besides, I never intended to crush her in one move. What I want is for her to lose her position as vice-chairman, lose Leonard’s trust, and make him blame her for Blackwood Industries losing this deal. Let her stew in that failure."

This would drive a wedge between Penelope and Leonard.

Defeating an enemy wasn’t just about victory—it was about making them suffer. Since Evelyn couldn’t destroy Penelope outright, she’d settle for breaking her spirit.

Owned by N?velDrama.Org.

Soon, Penelope would find her office as suffocating as a prison cell.

"Evelyn," Sebastian leaned forward, his voice teasing, "do you know what I want most right now?"

"Hmm? What?"

"To retire immediately—just to make room for you."

He sighed dramatically, spreading his hands. "Honestly, no one is more suited to be Monarch Group’s CEO than you."

At that, Evelyn’s expression soured.

The mountain of blind date profiles Harrison kept forcing on her felt like a curse. She was half-convinced he’d bury them with her in her coffin.

Just then, her phone buzzed—Arabella was calling.

"Seb, talk later. Arabella’s calling."

"Of course. Now that she’s back in Crestview, spend time with her. She needs you." His voice softened.

"I know. She’s the baby of the family—who else would I spoil?"

Truthfully, Evelyn carried a quiet guilt about Arabella. As the youngest, Arabella should have been the most cherished.

But from the moment Evelyn was born, her charisma had made her Harrison’s favorite. She’d unintentionally stolen the spotlight—and the affection—that should have been Arabella’s.

So Evelyn made sure to compensate however she could.

If Arabella needed love, Evelyn would give it to her tenfold.
###Chapter 240

Evelyn Carter always kept her struggles hidden, sharing only her joys with the world. This made it impossible for Nathan to know how to support her.

"Arabella, are you back in Crestview?" Nathan asked, his voice warm with affection.

"Yes, I'm already at the institute."

There was a brief pause before Arabella continued hesitantly, "Nathan... are you free tonight? Do you have plans?"

The unspoken invitation hung between them.

"You want to spend time with me?" Nathan saw right through her.

"Yes!"

Arabella's voice brightened. "We haven't had proper time together since you came home. If you're available, let me treat you to dinner?"

"Just dinner?" Nathan arched an eyebrow playfully. "No drinks?"

"Well then, let's go to karaoke!" Arabella teased. "It's been ages since we sang together. I wonder if you still remember how."

"Hah! I was born to sing!" Nathan cleared his throat dramatically. "Even Whitney Houston couldn't compare! Looks like I'll have to remind you of my talent!"

Meanwhile, a high-stakes meeting at Blackwood Industries concluded. Leonard Blackwood issued three critical directives.

First: Contain the Whitmore scandal's damage immediately. Control media narratives, restore corporate reputation, and prevent stock market disaster.

Second: Suspend Vincent Whitmore from all company positions. Launch thorough investigations into every employee under his supervision.

Third: Postpone Penelope Whitmore's promotion to Vice Chair indefinitely. Final decisions would follow complete case resolution.

Executives filed out with heavy sighs, the weight of crisis pressing upon them.

"Stay, Nathan. We need to talk." Leonard's grave tone stopped his son at the door.

Nathan turned expressionlessly, settling into his seat with practiced elegance.

Father and son faced each other across the polished conference table, the air between them frigid.

"As company president, how do you propose handling this?" Leonard's question carried steel.

"By the book."

Nathan's gaze remained impassive, his voice calm. "Aunt Penelope is under investigation. Full cooperation is her only option. There are no shortcuts."

"I'll find a way to help her." Leonard's chest tightened, his throat burning with suppressed emotion.

"Do you really believe that's possible?"

Nathan's dark eyes were fathomless. "The prosecutor handling Vincent's case is Dominic Kingsley."

"Dominic Kingsley?"

"Harrison Kingsley's second son. Evelyn's brother."

Leonard paled, his hands trembling slightly.

"Evelyn anticipated every move. But the Whitmores handed her this opportunity." Nathan adjusted his cufflinks. "As Chairman, your priority should be damage control. The real crisis begins when markets open tomorrow."

He shifted, signaling the conversation's end.

"Wait!"

Leonard leaned forward urgently. "You're acquainted with Dr. Laurent from Valmont. Securing him as Blackwood Biotech's consultant now - with his patents - could save our stocks. Contact him immediately. Bring him to Crestview this week."

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. "Fine."

Leonard exhaled - at least his son wasn't completely useless.

"But I have conditions."

"What?"

"I want the Vice Chair position." Nathan's starry eyes glinted with quiet determination.
###Chapter 241

"Nathan! You're exploiting the situation!" Leonard Blackwood's face twisted in shock as he slammed his palm on the mahogany desk and rose abruptly.

"Just settling scores, Father. Isn't that what you've preached since my childhood?" Nathan Blackwood remained composed, leisurely reclining in his leather chair.

"Your greed knows no bounds! You already claimed your pound of flesh. I even surrendered the presidency that rightfully belonged to your elder brother. Now you dare demand the vice-chairmanship? Why not ask for my resignation while you're at it?" Leonard's voice shook with barely contained fury.

Nathan's lips curled into a sardonic smile, his obsidian eyes revealing nothing. "Let's be honest - who's benefited whom more? Every scrap I've received since childhood came with your price tag attached. We both know exactly why I hold Monarch Group's presidency, so spare me the theatrics of portraying me as some villainous usurper. Just the two of us here - doesn't the pretense exhaust you?"

Leonard's complexion darkened to an alarming shade of crimson, rendered speechless.

"The vice-chairmanship in exchange for Blackwood Industries surviving this crisis unscathed. The choice seems rather straightforward." Nathan rose gracefully and moved toward the exit.

He paused at the threshold, adding with calculated nonchalance, "Unless you'd prefer to keep championing Penelope against all reason. Though I'd imagine even you must feel some semblance of shame by now."

Nathan's fist clenched as he stormed back to his office, the door crashing shut behind him with finality.

An unfamiliar lightness filled his chest. He inhaled deeply, long fingers loosening the constricting Windsor knot at his throat.

It had been years since Nathan experienced this particular flavor of satisfaction.

Watching Leonard exhaust every resource and scheme to salvage Penelope's crumbling position, only to meet with abject failure - the sight rejuvenated Nathan like nothing else.

Yet he couldn't deny Evelyn Carter's pivotal role in this victory.

Initially, Nathan merely aimed to block Penelope's vice-chairman aspirations. The nuclear option of public scandal seemed too risky, threatening Blackwood Industries' stock value and stakeholder confidence.

But Evelyn operated on an entirely different scale - her penchant for seismic disruptions yielded unexpected dividends. Not only had she neutralized Penelope's threat, but she'd also handed Nathan the perfect leverage to negotiate with Leonard, permanently eliminating any possibility of Penelope monitoring his activities.

Technically, Nathan owed Evelyn his gratitude.

Yet the memory of her scathing words that had lacerated his pride, her glacial indifference, caused his expression to darken.

Thank her? Unthinkable. That woman's original intent was stealing my project. Consider this repayment in kind.

His phone buzzed insistently.

Nathan retrieved the device, his brow furrowing slightly at the caller ID before answering with clipped impatience. "What do you want, Julian?"

"Nathan, you absolute bastard, come drink with me tonight." Julian Montgomery's voice carried the rasp of someone who'd been drinking since noon, tinged with the melodrama of a jilted lover. "I've acquired three limited-edition Bugattis, hired four supermodels to drown my sorrows with, and uncorked enough Dom Pérignon to flood a small country. Yet this... this ache in my chest persists. Is this heartbreak? It feels like someone's stabbing me with a rusty ice pick!"

"Sounds like angina. Might I suggest a cardiologist instead of a bartender? Stop wasting my time."

As Nathan moved to disconnect, Julian's panicked voice cut through. "Wait! At least celebrate your wicked stepmother's downfall with me!"

Nathan's lips thinned. "Fine. Time and place."

At precisely 6:00 p.m., a matte black Rolls-Royce Ghost idled discreetly behind Crestview Arts Institute. Despite its understated elegance, the vehicle still drew covetous glances from passing students.
###Chapter 242

Theodore Winslow flashed a charming smile. "Miss Carter, I heard Crestview Arts Institute has an excellent café. Allow me to treat you and Arabella to coffee."

Evelyn barely glanced up from her documents. "Fine. Pick Arabella up on your way."

She tapped her phone screen impatiently. "She's not answering. Go check her classroom. She doesn't know we're waiting at the rear entrance."

"Understood."

Theodore strode through the wrought-iron gates, his tailored navy suit drawing admiring whispers across the sunlit quadrangle.

Inside the bustling café, he placed an order for two caramel macchiatos. The barista nearly spilled the milk pitcher while staring at his chiseled profile.

Just then, two Chanel-clad socialites flounced in, their designer heels clicking against the marble tiles.

"Ugh, can you believe Arabella Kingsley landed the lead in the graduation showcase?"

Theodore's grip tightened around the coffee cups.

"That scholarship brat? Please." The second girl flipped her extensions. "She's obviously sleeping with Professor Laurent. Saw her cozying up to Ethan Chamberlain near the greenhouse earlier. Total gold-digger."

CRASH!

The gossiping duo shrieked as scalding coffee drenched their Valentino dresses. Mascara streaked down their cheeks like inky tears.

"You psycho!" One girl screeched, plucking a ruined eyelash from her cheek.

Theodore's voice turned glacial. "Defamation carries a three-year prison sentence. Consider yourselves fortunate I don't strike women."

The brunette trembled, but her blonde friend sneered. "What, is she your girlfriend? Go see for yourself if you don't believe us!"

Behind the lecture hall, Arabella stood trapped between rose bushes and Ethan Chamberlain's hulking frame.

"I've declined your advances six times." Her knuckles whitened around her textbook. "Now excuse me, I'm expected elsewhere."

Ethan smirked, producing a velvet Cartier box. "Playing hard to get?" The diamond watch inside glinted maliciously. "Be my girl and you'll get ten of these. Plus..." His gaze dropped to her waist. "Other... benefits."

Arabella recoiled as if struck. With one swift motion, she sent the watch flying into a mud puddle.

Ethan's face purpled with rage. "You ungrateful bitch!" He seized her wrist hard enough to bruise. "Think you're too good for me? I could ruin your career before it starts!"

"Release me!" Arabella twisted violently, her ballet flats slipping on damp grass.

"Oh, I'll release you alright." Ethan's free hand groped for her hip. "After you learn your—"

A sickening CRACK echoed through the garden as Theodore's fist connected with Ethan's jaw. The bully crumpled like a marionette with cut strings, blood blooming across his chin.

Theodore adjusted his cufflinks calmly. "Miss Kingsley, your coffee's getting cold."

Arabella gaped at her would-be assailant moaning in the dirt, then at Theodore's outstretched hand. Behind them, the gossip girls watched open-mouthed from the café window.

Theodore's lips curved dangerously. "Shall we discuss those defamation charges over latte art?"
###Chapter 243

Theodore's voice was laced with dark amusement. "Isn't this what you've been craving? Playing the innocent doesn't suit you, Arabella."

Before she could react, he slammed her slender frame against the rough bark of an oak tree, his lips descending toward hers.

"Stop! Don't!"

Arabella squeezed her eyes shut as hot tears of humiliation streaked down her cheeks.

A bloodcurdling scream shattered the tension.

When Arabella dared to open her tear-filled eyes, she saw Ethan Chamberlain being flipped effortlessly over Theodore's shoulder like a ragdoll.

The impact of Ethan's body hitting the ground sent vibrations through the grass.

But Theodore wasn't finished.

He hauled Ethan up by his designer collar and delivered three brutal punches to his face in rapid succession. The sickening crunch of cartilage echoed through the garden.

"Enough! Theodore, stop!"

Terrified he might kill the man, Arabella threw herself against Theodore's back, her arms locking around his torso in a desperate embrace.

"You bastard!" Ethan spat out a mouthful of blood, his face already swelling. "Do you have any idea who my father is? Richard Chamberlain of Chamberlain Holdings! You're dead!"

"Theodore Winslow. Of Fairhaven."

Theodore's voice vibrated with barely contained rage as he shrugged out of his tailored jacket and draped it over Arabella's trembling shoulders.

Seeing her like this - fragile as a wounded sparrow - made something primal snap inside him. Before he could stop himself, he pulled her against his chest.

Arabella melted into the embrace, her heart hammering against her ribs. The scent of his cologne - sandalwood and something distinctly masculine - enveloped her as she pressed her cheek against his starched shirt.

In Theodore's arms, the world righted itself again.

"Listen carefully, you pathetic worm," Theodore growled over Arabella's head. "Arabella Kingsley is untouchable. If you so much as look at her again, not even your father's fortune will save you."

Ethan scrambled backward before turning to flee into the night.

When Arabella emerged from the ladies' room fifteen minutes later, she found Theodore leaning against the hallway wall, his worried gaze tracking her every movement.

"Theodore..."

He blinked, the mask of professional detachment sliding back into place. "Miss Kingsley."

That formal address stung more than she expected. Arabella lowered her lashes to hide the hurt, stepping forward to return his oversized jacket. "Thank you. For everything."

"Miss Kingsley, what happened tonight was assault. I'm obligated to inform Evelyn and let the family decide how to proceed." His jaw clenched at the memory.

"No! Please!" Panic widened her eyes as she grabbed his forearm. "If Evelyn gets involved, it'll become a whole scandal! My parents would worry, and it could affect Monarch Group's merger talks!"

"But that bastard attacked you!" Theodore's voice cracked with fury, his knuckles whitening at his sides.

"You already made him pay." Arabella forced a shaky smile. "Graduation's next month - I'll never see him again. Besides..." She lifted her chin slightly. "I'm a Kingsley. I can handle myself."

Theodore swallowed hard. Just as he opened his mouth to argue, Arabella placed a trembling hand on his sleeve.

"Please," she whispered, her voice breaking. "I have my reasons. Trust me on this."

The unspoken plea in her eyes undid him. With a reluctant nod, Theodore watched her walk away, his fists clenching at his sides with impotent rage. Somewhere in the shadows, a camera shutter clicked silently.
###Chapter 244

Julian Montgomery had arranged to meet Nathan Blackwood at a newly opened high-end karaoke lounge in Crestview.

Inside the exclusive VVIP suite, Julian ordered an extravagant selection of premium wines. Gripping a bottle in one hand, he attempted to belt out Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You, completely butchering the iconic melody.

Nathan sat on the plush crimson velvet sofa, swirling a glass of whiskey with effortless elegance. His posture was regal, as if he were presiding over a throne rather than a dimly lit karaoke room.

The flickering neon lights cast shifting shadows across the space, but even in the darkness, Nathan’s commanding presence was impossible to ignore.

"We both know I'm not what you need— And I— Will always love you— I will always love you—"

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his fingers clenching around the glass so hard it nearly shattered.

Only someone with an unbreakable bond could endure Julian’s off-key wailing, which sounded more like a distressed donkey than a human voice.

Julian finished his performance with a dramatic, ear-splitting crescendo, while Nathan took a stiff sip of whiskey, his expression unreadable.

"Bro— Burp!"

Julian staggered over, collapsing onto the sofa beside Nathan and slinging an arm around his shoulders.

"Bro, how was that? Still got the pipes, right?"

Nathan arched a brow and sidestepped, letting Julian face-plant into the cushions.

"Yes. Astonishing how one man can sound like an entire herd of dying donkeys."

"Screw you!" Julian groaned, rubbing his face. "No wonder Evelyn divorced you. That mouth of yours could send a saint into early menopause."

"Evelyn?"

Nathan’s gaze sharpened, his voice dropping dangerously low. "I thought you were heartbroken. Or did you forget you two are practically strangers now?"

Julian choked on his drink. "Damn it, man. You really know how to twist the knife."

He exhaled heavily, swirling his wine before slamming the bottle onto the table.

"I admit it—your ex-wife is the most extraordinary woman I’ve ever met. I messed up from the start, and now I’ve lost my shot. But I still don’t get it—what’s so special about you that she gave up being the Monarch Group heiress? That she stayed anonymous for three years just to be your wife in name only?"

His voice turned bitter. "Sure, you’re good-looking, but that’s not enough. You treated her like dirt, and she still didn’t leave. And in the end, you were the one who kicked her out."

"Julian," Nathan warned, his fist clenching.

"No, I’m not done!"

Julian’s eyes burned with frustration, his words slurring slightly from the alcohol. "I don’t understand! Were you two lovers in a past life or something? Why would she endure so much humiliation—carry so much weight—just for you*?"*

Even Nathan didn’t have an answer.

That was why he had stopped Evelyn at Cliffside Manor—to demand the truth.

This mystery had become an obsession. Ever since discovering her real identity at his grandfather’s birthday gala, sleep had been elusive.

Nathan’s throat tightened. Before he could respond, Julian let out a hollow laugh.

"Nathan, I’ll admit—I’ve been reckless with women before. But this time, with Evelyn… I was serious. And I keep thinking—why couldn’t I have met her sooner?"

Nathan remained silent, his gaze darkening.

"If I had, I would’ve told her to stay the hell away from you. She’d have been better off."

Nathan’s patience snapped. He shot Julian a glare sharp enough to kill.

Meanwhile, Arabella Kingsley’s mood had lifted the moment she saw her sister. She insisted on treating Evelyn to dinner.

Unable to refuse, Evelyn chose a modest sushi bar, deliberately picking the most affordable dishes.

Though the food was mediocre, the sisters laughed freely, downing glass after glass of sake. Theodore Winslow, Evelyn’s ever-loyal assistant, played bartender, refilling their cups without complaint—though he barely touched his own meal.

Still, seeing the sisters so carefree made him smile.

After several bottles, they were pleasantly buzzed and decided to continue the night at a nearby karaoke bar.

Theodore was about to join when his phone rang—his brother informed him their mother’s heart condition had flared up. He had no choice but to leave.

"Theo, go. We’ll be fine," Evelyn assured him.

"Yes, don’t worry about us," Arabella added gently. "You’ve had a long day. Go take care of your mother, then rest. We’ll just sing a little and head home."

Theodore hesitated but finally nodded. "Call me if you need anything."

As he left, the sisters exchanged mischievous grins—tonight was theirs.
###Chapter 245

"I'm terribly sorry I can't stay longer, Ms. Carter and Ms. Arabella."

Theodore sighed with visible guilt. "I should return to the office now. Ms. Carter, if anything happens—anything at all—you must call me immediately. I'll come straight back!"

"Alright, alright, you worrywart. Just go already." Evelyn gave him a gentle push toward the waiting car. Theodore gazed at her with longing before finally departing with reluctant steps.

Arabella watched their exchange with quiet resignation. She bit her plush lower lip as a pang of jealousy twisted in her chest. Yet she couldn't bring herself to resent her sister—Evelyn was perfection incarnate. Of course Theodore would be drawn to her.

Someone as weak and insignificant as me doesn't deserve someone like Theodore. But why did Evelyn's ex-husband leave her? Could it be... some terminal illness? Did he leave to spare her the pain of widowhood?

Evelyn had reserved an exclusive VIP suite. As the sisters approached their door, ear-splitting shrieks masquerading as singing erupted from the opposite room.

"Ugh! That's horrifying!" Arabella tightened her grip on Evelyn's arm, shoulders hunching involuntarily.

If that qualifies as singing, then every donkey is a Grammy winner!

Evelyn swiftly pulled Arabella into their private room, putting distance between them and the auditory assailant across the hall. They ordered craft beers, an artisanal fruit platter, and an assortment of gourmet snacks.

Their playlist came together quickly.

From timeless classics to contemporary hits, the Kingsley sisters sang with abandon.

Evelyn danced, sang, and drank with increasing enthusiasm. Celebrating her Westridge project victory, she soon reached a pleasant buzz.

"Arabella... I need the ladies' room. Stay put—don't wander off!" Evelyn's vision swam slightly, her words beginning to slur.

"Evelyn, are you drunk? Let me come with you."

Arabella noticed how Evelyn's normally porcelain cheeks had bloomed a delicate peach hue. Her usually sharp emerald eyes glazed over with intoxicating warmth. As Arabella moved to assist, Evelyn waved her off.

"Nonsense! I'm the older sister—if anyone should be drunk, it's you! Then I'd have to drag your lightweight self back to campus!" Evelyn punctuated this with an undignified hiccup.

Arabella didn't know whether to laugh or cry. What kind of warped logic was that?

Emerging from the restroom alone, Evelyn navigated the hallway using the gilded walls for support.

First her limbs had turned traitorous, now her head spun like a carousel.

The opulent karaoke lounge mirrored Versailles' hall of mirrors—endless reflections and deliberately confusing room numbering. Soon, Evelyn found herself thoroughly lost.

Drunk and disoriented, she wandered the labyrinthine corridors until she stumbled upon what she believed was her room.

Pushing the door open, she collided headfirst with a towering, broad-shouldered figure.

"Oof!"

The soft exclamation escaped her lips as her already unsteady heels betrayed her. Her slender frame teetered backward.

The stranger's eyes flashed as he swiftly caught the small of her back.

Through her thin silk blouse, the man could trace every contour of Evelyn's narrow waist with his large palm. She fit against his hand like a missing puzzle piece.

His breathing hitched. Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses with his free hand, he studied Evelyn's exquisite features with the intensity of a connoisseur appraising rare art.

"Miss, you're intoxicated."

"Mmm... No!" Evelyn squinted drunkenly at the man's refined, aristocratic features.

Suddenly, her crimson lips curled mischievously as she reached to remove his glasses.

The man's gaze turned razor-sharp.

The last person who'd dared touch his glasses now fed the fishes off the Serenian coast.

"Hehe... Critter! You're Critter!"

The man inhaled sharply, expression transforming completely!

His penetrating eyes raked over Evelyn's flushed face before he ventured cautiously in a velvet baritone, "Evelyn Kingsley?"
###Chapter 246

"You really are Critter!" Evelyn's cheeks were flushed with alcohol, her smile radiant under the dim lighting.

The man's lips curved into a faint, indulgent smile. The usual coldness in his gaze melted away as he studied her. His left arm remained securely around her slender waist while his right hand adjusted his glasses.

It had been years since anyone called him by that childhood nickname.

Even his father had stopped using it. Yet here was Evelyn, as bold and unrestrained as she'd been when they were kids.

"Fifteen years, and you're still as stunning as ever," he murmured.

She giggled, her eyes crinkling with mischief. "Look who's talking!"

Evelyn reached up, patting his cheek playfully. The gesture was teasing, almost irreverent—but it didn’t bother him in the slightest.

If she were prim and proper all the time, she wouldn’t be the Evelyn Carter he adored.

She hiccuped, swaying dangerously. Her balance was completely shot.

Without hesitation, he scooped her up into his arms, bridal-style.

"Mm—put me down!"

Her face burned as she squirmed, her movements uncoordinated and kittenish.

The burgundy skirt rode up slightly, revealing slender, porcelain legs that gleamed under the ambient light. His gaze darkened, a playful edge creeping into his voice. "I’ll set you down if you say my name."

"Your name is... Critter?"

Evelyn was too far gone, her thoughts muddled by alcohol. She barely remembered her own name, let alone his.

"Alexander Whitmore," he corrected, his breath warm against her ear. "But you can keep calling me Critter." His lashes lowered, voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Only you get that privilege."

Unfortunately, his words were lost on her. She blinked up at him, utterly clueless.

Alexander carefully settled her onto the plush sofa, handling her as if she were made of glass.

Just then, his phone buzzed. His secretary’s name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Whitmore, everyone’s waiting for you."

"Send them home." His lips curled into a fond smile, his gaze never leaving Evelyn’s flushed face.

"Pardon?" The secretary sounded stunned.

"Cancel the meeting. And don’t disturb me."

"Y-yes, sir." The secretary didn’t dare question him further.

"Oh, and pick up some hangover medicine on your way here."

Hanging up, Alexander sank onto the sofa beside Evelyn. He gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his touch featherlight.

"What a twist of fate, running into you like this."

Meanwhile, Julian Montgomery slumped onto the couch after belting out Break My Heart Again, completely passed out.

Nathan Blackwood’s frown deepened, his mood equally grim.

He drained the last of his wine in one go, then snatched Julian’s cigarette box. Plucking one out, he clamped it between his lips, the sharp inhale filling his lungs with nicotine.

His striking features looked rougher in the dim light, shadows accentuating the hollows of his cheeks.

Evelyn always left him tangled in conflicting emotions. He exhaled a slow stream of smoke.

Since the divorce, his habits had spiraled. Smoking, drinking—no one was around to scold him anymore.

"Evelyn... Evelyn..." Julian groaned, clawing at his collar in his drunken stupor.

Nathan snapped back to reality. With a sharp flick of his cigarette, he nudged Julian’s limp arm with the toe of his polished shoe.

"Shut up. She’s not coming, no matter how much you whine."

A bitter edge crept into his voice as he added, "And who the hell are you to call her name like that?"

Suddenly, the door burst open. Oliver Sinclair stood there, panting, his grip white-knuckled on the doorframe.

"Ever heard of knocking?" Nathan crushed his cigarette, irritation flaring.

"Mr. Blackwood! I—I just saw Mrs. Carter!" Oliver’s face was slick with sweat, his eyes wide.

Nathan shot to his feet. "Where?!"
###Chapter 247

"Mr. Blackwood, swear to me you won't act rashly when I tell you this," Oliver Sinclair pleaded, his voice trembling.

"Out with it!" Nathan Blackwood's command cut through the air like a whip.

Oliver swallowed hard before continuing. "I just witnessed Ms. Carter entering a private suite. Then a man in glasses pulled her inside."

Nathan's vision blurred with rage, crimson flooding his eyes. "Which room? Take me there now!"

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore's assistant had just returned with the requested hangover remedy.

Alexander took the bottle with surprising gentleness, carefully administering the medicine to Evelyn. He even held a glass of water to her lips afterward.

The assistant stood frozen in shock.

Alexander Whitmore was known as the Ice Prince of Wall Street - a ruthless businessman who concealed his cunning behind polished manners. In all his years of service, the assistant had never seen his boss show such tenderness toward any woman.

Who was this mysterious beauty capable of thawing the untouchable Alexander Whitmore?

The assistant suppressed a knowing smile. Even the most powerful men weren't immune to love's spell when faced with true beauty.

"Feeling better?" Alexander asked softly as the color gradually returned to Evelyn's cheeks.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her chest, her gaze slowly focusing. A wave of nausea still churned in her stomach.

"Alcohol is poison," Alexander chided gently, offering another sip of water. "You should be more careful."

Though her memory remained foggy, Evelyn instinctively trusted this stranger. His gold-rimmed glasses gave him an air of refined sophistication, like a modern-day prince from a fairy tale.

"You seem... familiar," Evelyn murmured, rubbing her throbbing temples.

Alexander's fox-like eyes narrowed behind his glasses. So she didn't remember.

The door exploded inward with a crash.

Nathan stormed in like a force of nature, his fury radiating in waves.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly, his glasses glinting dangerously.

"Sir, that's Nathan Blackwood of Blackwood Industries," the assistant whispered urgently.

"Remove him," Alexander ordered coldly, not bothering with formalities.

Before the assistant could act, Nathan had already shoved past him, looming over Evelyn like a thundercloud.

Evelyn blinked up in confusion, rubbing her eyes like a sleepy child. "Nathan? What are you—"

"Come with me." Nathan cut her off, seizing her wrist.

With effortless strength, he pulled her against his chest, his entire body vibrating with suppressed rage.

This woman had stolen his business deal by day, and now she was celebrating with some pretty-boy stranger? The hypocrisy burned in his throat.

"Let go of me!" Evelyn struggled as sobriety returned. "Why are you stalking me? Are you some kind of guard dog?"

"Evelyn, don't push me!" Nathan's fist clenched, veins standing out along his forearm.

Alexander moved like lightning, capturing Evelyn's other wrist.

Torn between them, Evelyn felt like a wishbone about to snap.

"Clearly Ms. Carter has no desire to leave with you," Alexander said icily. "Or do you make a habit of kidnapping women?"

"You know nothing about our relationship!" Nathan snarled, the vein in his forehead pulsing dangerously.

Alexander adjusted his glasses with one hand, his gaze turning razor-sharp. "If I'm a stranger, then what exactly are you to her?"

Their answers came simultaneously.

Nathan declared, "I'm her husband!"

Evelyn shouted, "He's my ex-husband!"
###Chapter 248

Nathan froze for a heartbeat. His chest tightened painfully.

Evelyn's flushed cheeks drained of color as sobriety hit her like ice water. She glared at Alexander with fiery indignation.

"Alexander Whitmore! How dare you act so shamelessly? Release me this instant! I refuse to go anywhere with you!"

Alexander let her thrash and curse to her heart's content. At this moment, nothing else in the world mattered to him except tearing her away from that man.

Seeing her drunk and laughing with a stranger in that private room had ignited a fury in him. How could Evelyn be so reckless?

"Nathan Blackwood, you absolute brute! Unhand me—Ah!"

Without warning, Alexander hooked an arm around Evelyn's waist and hauled her over his shoulder, striding from the room with grim determination. His expression was stormy.

"Put me down! I'm going to be sick!"

Evelyn pounded his back with her fists. The world spun violently, her stomach churning until tears pricked her eyes.

"Go ahead," Alexander said coldly, unmoved. He almost welcomed it—let this be her punishment for being such a deceitful little liar.

As they vanished from the VIP lounge, Dominic's lips pressed into a thin line, fury darkening his gaze.

"That arrogant bastard has no manners whatsoever."

"Mr. Whitmore, shall we pursue them?" His assistant asked urgently.

"Have someone tail her."

Dominic's voice was deceptively calm. He still held the glass Evelyn had drunk from, his thumb tracing the faint imprint of her lipstick along the rim.

"Who would've guessed Nathan Blackwood is married?"

His assistant blinked in disbelief. "When did this happen? There's been no news of it."

"Investigate it."

Dominic raised the glass to his lips, sipping from where Evelyn had. His tone was measured, but the ice in his gold-rimmed eyes could freeze hell itself. "Dig into Nathan Blackwood's recent activities. And find out the true nature of their relationship."

Nathan had intended to take Evelyn back to his own suite, but the thought of Julian passed out on the couch made him change course. Instead, he carried her straight out of the club.

Staff and patrons stared but didn't interfere—just another lovers' quarrel, they assumed.

"Alexander... I really might vomit... This is unbearable..."

The hangover remedy had begun working, but being slung over his shoulder like a sack of grain made Evelyn seasick. Her weak whimper tugged at something primal in Alexander.

Desire coiled hot in his gut. His Adam's apple bobbed. "Then perhaps you shouldn't have gotten drunk, Evelyn."

The moment her feet touched pavement, Evelyn shoved him hard against the car door.

Alexander's breath hitched as she pressed against him, her flushed face inches from his. Her delicate hands splayed across his chest before curling into fists.

Then she threw up.

Alexander's eyes flew wide. "You—!"

Evelyn doubled over, emptying the contents of her stomach all over his immaculate Armani suit.

The stench of half-digested seafood and alcohol made Alexander gag. His expression turned thunderous. This infuriating woman used me as a goddamn support beam?!

"Alexander Blackwood, are you some kind of vengeful spirit? Why do you keep haunting me? Get lost! I can't stand the sight of you!"

Evelyn pushed at him weakly, but Alexander seized her wrists, pinning her with a glare that could melt steel.

"Who was that pretty boy with the glasses?"

"Who? Oh, him?" Evelyn's almond eyes glittered with mischief through her drunken haze. She smiled, slow and wicked. "That's my new lover. Got a problem with that?"
###Chapter 249

"Yes, I do!" Nathan Blackwood's voice cracked with raw emotion, his eyes burning crimson. All pretense of restraint shattered.

Evelyn Carter let out a mocking laugh that cut through the night air. "What difference does your objection make? You're nothing but a deranged lunatic!"

She twisted violently in his grasp, her flushed cheeks from alcohol making her even more alluring in the dim light. The scent of her perfume mixed with whiskey made Nathan's pulse race dangerously.

"You have your precious Victoria Sterling," she spat, "so why shouldn't I take lovers? Who the hell are you to dictate my life?"

Each syllable struck Nathan like a physical blow. His grip tightened unconsciously as images flooded his mind - Evelyn leaning intimately against that man at VELVET, their bodies nearly touching as they shared private jokes. The way that stranger's eyes had devoured her with undisguised desire.

The memory made Nathan's vision swim with red.

"Quite the scandalous social life you've cultivated, Ms. Kingsley," he sneered, though the barb hurt him more than her. The alcohol amplified every bitter emotion. "Why reserve an entire private suite unless you planned something...extravagant?"

Evelyn threw back her head with wild laughter. "Exactly! Did you think I'd remain that dull Evelyn you discarded? There's nothing I won't try these days. Your imagination is pathetically limited."

"Nathan!"

His control snapped. Chest heaving, he hauled her closer. "I'm removing you from this den of debauchery immediately. While I breathe, you won't so much as glance at another man!"

A police cruiser's siren wailed nearby.

Evelyn's demeanor shifted instantly - from fiery vixen to trembling victim. "Help! This madman is assaulting me!" Her terrified scream carried perfectly.

Nathan paled as two officers sprinted toward them, shouting commands. In the chaos, Evelyn wrenched free, wiping fake tears as she spun her tale.

"This stranger wouldn't take no for an answer after I accidentally spilled my drink on him! I offered compensation but he became violent!"

The officers turned disapproving glares on Nathan. "Harassment charges can land you in a cell tonight, sir."

"I'm not some predator!" Nathan growled. "We have history-"

"Do you know this man?" an officer asked Evelyn gently.

Evelyn's tearful headshake sealed his fate. "Never seen him before."

As the officers moved to restrain him, Nathan's phone vibrated violently. Leonard Blackwood's name flashed onscreen.

"Where the hell are you?" his father's voice crackled with urgency. "Victoria slit her wrists! She's at Crestview Medical Center - they're pumping blood into her as we speak!"

The words struck like a physical blow. Nathan's already ashen face drained of all color.

"Get your affairs in order, Nathan!" Leonard roared. "You pledged yourself to Victoria, then humiliated her publicly! That girl saved your life when you tried to end it as a teenager! This is your repayment? Driving her to suicide?"

Childhood trauma crashed over Nathan like a tsunami. His chest constricted painfully, breath coming in ragged gasps.

When his vision cleared, Evelyn had vanished back into the club's neon glow.
###Chapter 250

Evelyn stumbled back into the karaoke bar, her head clearing slightly after emptying her stomach. But the lighthearted joy from earlier had completely evaporated.

Of all the cursed luck—running into that bastard during a rare night out with her sister.

She clenched her fists, determined to exorcise this persistent ghost from her life once and for all.

Suddenly, warm fingers encircled her wrist.

Blinking up through her lashes, Evelyn forced a smile when she recognized Arabella. "I'm fine."

"Evie, was that man harassing you earlier really your ex-husband?" Arabella slipped an arm around Evelyn's waist, steadying her with concern. "The ridiculously handsome one?"

"Yeah," Evelyn muttered, the single word dripping with exhaustion.

"Oh my God! He's absolutely breathtaking!" Arabella's eyes sparkled like champagne bubbles. "I thought Sebastian, Dominic, Maxwell and Donovan were the pinnacle of male beauty, but your ex-husband? He could give our brothers a run for their money! Are you sure he's a CEO? He looks more like he belongs on a movie screen!"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Visual impact? Please, he's not some IMAX feature."

"No wonder Mom kept saying your ex was more gorgeous than George Clooney! I thought she was exaggerating—you know how obsessed she's been with him since Pretty Woman. But seeing him tonight? Mom wasn't lying one bit!" Arabella continued gushing about Nathan's devastating looks.

"Handsome face, rotten soul—like a gilded toilet bowl," Evelyn snapped, narrowing her eyes at her sister's flushed cheeks. "Keep praising that bastard and I'll tell Harrison that Camille's celebrity crush is George Clooney!"

Since it was so late, Arabella decided to stay at Evelyn's penthouse rather than return to campus. She'd head back to her dorm in the morning.

Noticing her usually alcohol-resistant sister was unusually affected tonight, Arabella grew concerned. Evelyn kept rubbing her temples, leaning heavily against the car window with shallow breaths.

"Let me help," Arabella murmured, gently massaging Evelyn's pressure points.

Evelyn melted into her sister's touch. Even intoxicated, she carried an intoxicating floral scent, her flawless skin glistening with a delicate sheen of perspiration.

Arabella swallowed hard. It was criminal how breathtaking her sister looked even in this state—like some intoxicated goddess from mythology.

Evelyn directed the driver to stop at the gated community's entrance. She preferred walking the last stretch when tipsy—the night air helped clear her head before bed.

Arm in arm, the sisters strolled down the tree-lined path.

The crisp evening breeze carried the scent of magnolias. A nearly full moon dominated the sky, leaving only the brightest stars visible. The serene scene gradually eased Evelyn's tension.

Suddenly, Evelyn froze. Her grip on Arabella's hand turned vice-like.

"Evie? What's—"

"Someone's following us," Evelyn whispered, every sense on high alert. Arabella's palm grew clammy as she nervously scanned their surroundings.

"Don't panic. Stay behind me." Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smirk. "I could use some stress relief after tonight."

Still seething from Nathan's provocation, Evelyn welcomed the opportunity to unleash her fury. Her childhood nickname "The Kingsley Ninja" from her brothers hadn't been given lightly.

"Enough skulking in shadows! Show yourself!" Evelyn's commanding voice sliced through the night.

A twig snapped ominously from the nearby foliage.

Evelyn's eyes darkened as she shoved Arabella protectively behind her.

Heavy footsteps crunched through the underbrush. A hulking figure emerged—dressed head-to-toe in black tactical gear, his face obscured by a ski mask. The way he cracked his neck sent chills down Arabella's spine.

Evelyn remained unnaturally calm. Though she recognized trained muscle when she saw it, she'd spent years sparring with her special ops brother Maxwell. Normal fighters didn't intimidate her.

"Which one of you is Evelyn Carter?" The masked man's accent marked him as non-local.

"That would be me," Evelyn taunted, raising a defiant eyebrow. "Care to kneel while you're at it?"

The response was instantaneous—a gleaming switchblade flashing toward her.

"Evie, watch out!" Arabella screamed as Evelyn shoved her aside.

"Run, Arabella!"

But Arabella stood paralyzed—how could she abandon her sister?

The ensuing fight became a blur of whirling limbs and deadly precision. Each strike generated palpable shockwaves through the air.

Within seconds, Evelyn had exchanged over twenty blows with her attacker, their movements almost too fast to follow.
###Chapter 251

Evelyn watched the chaotic fight unfold before her, her heart pounding faster than during any action movie she'd ever seen.

"Go, Evelyn!" Arabella cheered enthusiastically from the side.

Evelyn barely managed to evade the man's brutal kicks. Seriously? Now's the time for cheerleading?!

"Arabella! Call the police!" she snapped.

"Oh—right!" Arabella finally snapped out of her daze and fumbled for her phone.

The attacker hadn't expected the delicate-looking woman to be so skilled in combat.

Realizing he couldn't overpower Evelyn, he shifted his focus to Arabella. In a flash, he turned and lunged at her.

Arabella's phone clattered to the ground. She froze, eyes squeezing shut in terror. A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

A pained grunt followed.

Arabella's eyes flew open just in time to see Evelyn shielding her, taking the brunt of the knife attack.

A long gash split Evelyn's blazer sleeve, crimson blood staining the fabric in a vivid streak.

"Evelyn!" Arabella shrieked, tears streaming down her face.

Evelyn panted, clutching her bleeding arm. A dull, throbbing pain radiated through her scalp, sweat beading on her forehead.

This wasn't a random mugging.

This man was a professional.

Just as the attacker raised his knife again, a strong hand seized him by the collar, yanking him backward.

Evelyn seized the moment—her foot lashed out in a sharp roundhouse kick, sending the dagger clattering away.

A sharp cry of pain followed.

Crack!

Evelyn watched, stunned, as the man's arms were effortlessly dislocated—like dismantling a toy.

It was terrifyingly impressive.

"You?!"

Evelyn's breath hitched. The pain in her wound momentarily forgotten, she stared at the man who had subdued the attacker beneath his polished leather shoes.

Her unexpected savior.

"What a pleasant coincidence," Alexander Whitmore murmured, his lips curving into a gentle smile.

He pressed his shoe harder against the man's face, eliciting another agonized groan.

"Ms. Carter!" Theodore's voice rang out as he sprinted toward them.

"Theodore! Hurry—Evelyn's hurt!" Arabella's voice trembled, fresh tears welling in her eyes.

"Ms. Carter! What happened?!"

Theodore's heart clenched at the sight of blood pooling on the pavement. His vision blurred. "Who did this to you?"

"Why are you here? How's your mother?" Evelyn exhaled sharply, scolding him. "This isn't the time—"

"Like hell it isn't! You need a hospital now!" Theodore's hands shook as he reached for her.

Evelyn stepped back stubbornly. "It's not deep. Just take care of Arabella—she's shaken up."

"Ms. Carter..." Theodore's fingers curled helplessly.

Evelyn had always been relentless. Even now, wounded and bleeding, she refused to show weakness.

"Evelyn, let Theodore help you. I'm fine," Arabella whispered, guilt twisting her expression. "This is my fault. If I hadn't been so useless—"

"Don't be ridiculous." Evelyn pinched Arabella's tear-streaked cheek lightly. "If anything, I dragged you into this."

Nearby, Alexander's bodyguards secured the attacker, shoving him into a car.

"Sir, are you all right?!" His secretary paled, finally catching up.

Alexander dusted off his suit with effortless grace before locking eyes with Evelyn.

His gaze burned with something unreadable.

Evelyn inhaled deeply and approached him. "Thank you for your help. But I need to handle this man myself. It's important."

Alexander's lips quirked. "Of course. But on one condition."

"Name it."

Before she could react, strong arms lifted her effortlessly.

Alexander cradled her against his chest, moving so swiftly even Theodore couldn't intervene.

Evelyn gasped.

Her eyes met his—warm, intense, unwavering.

"First, the hospital," he murmured. "Then you can do whatever you want."
###Chapter 252

The emergency room at Kingsley Medical Center was eerily quiet.

Victoria Sterling had received a blood transfusion, but her condition remained critical.

When they wheeled her in, her face was ghostly pale, almost translucent. The deep, jagged cuts on her wrists told a story of desperation.

Nathan Blackwood, Leonard Blackwood, Richard Sterling, and Cassandra Blackwood stood in the sterile hallway, tension thick in the air.

Margaret Sterling clutched her chest, sobbing uncontrollably. "Victoria! My baby, wake up!"

"Enough!" Richard snapped, his face dark with fury. "Do you have no shame? Crying like this in public? You're humiliating us!"

"Humiliating?" Margaret whirled on him, eyes blazing. "Our daughter is fighting for her life, and all you care about is your reputation? Are you even human?"

She grabbed his collar, her nails digging in. "My son is already in prison. Victoria is all I have left! If she dies, I swear I'll—"

Richard shoved her away with a force that sent her stumbling to the floor.

Margaret gasped, shock momentarily silencing her tears.

"Aunt Margaret, Uncle Richard, please!" Cassandra rushed forward, helping Margaret up. But behind her concerned expression, a smirk tugged at her lips.

If Penelope Whitmore hadn't been detained for questioning, and if Leonard hadn't dragged her here to "comfort" Margaret, Cassandra wouldn't have bothered.

But since she was here, she might as well play the part.

"Leonard," Richard seethed, turning on his brother-in-law. "Your son did this. He owes us an explanation!"

Richard's voice shook with rage. "Victoria gave Nathan the best years of her life! The entire city knows they're engaged. First, he delays the wedding because of his divorce. Fine. We tolerated it for Reginald's sake. But now? He throws her away like trash? What kind of respectable family would accept this humiliation?"

Leonard's jaw tightened. He had no defense.

"We may not be as powerful as the Blackwoods, but we have our dignity!" Margaret spat, leaning on Cassandra for support. "If Nathan abandons Victoria, we'll go to the press. Let the world see how your son destroys lives!"

She knew exactly what Victoria was doing—forcing Nathan's hand through desperation.

Their childhood bond was her leverage. If Nathan had even an ounce of affection left, he wouldn't let her die.

And if marriage was off the table? Then the Sterlings would bleed the Blackwoods dry.

Leonard exhaled sharply. With Penelope's scandal already making headlines, another scandal—Nathan driving his fiancée to suicide—would tank Blackwood Industries' stock.

"Fine," Leonard said grimly. "When Victoria wakes up, tell her the wedding will proceed as planned."

The Sterlings visibly relaxed—but Margaret's eyes remained wary.

Nathan had grown too powerful. Would he even listen to Leonard anymore?

Footsteps echoed down the hall.

Nathan strode toward them, his face as cold as winter. Oliver Sinclair followed closely behind.

"How is she?" Nathan demanded.

Before Leonard could answer, Margaret lunged forward, gripping Nathan's shirt. "Look what you've done to my daughter! Do you want her dead? Is that why you're crawling back to Evelyn?"

"Mrs. Sterling!" Oliver quickly intervened, pulling her away.

The commotion drew stares. Despite the bodyguards blocking the area, curious onlookers peeked around corners, hungry for drama.
###Chapter 253

"Calm down?!" My voice cracked with raw emotion. "My daughter is fighting for her life because of that monster!"

I jabbed my finger toward Nathan's ashen face. "Nathan Blackwood! If you never intended to marry Victoria, why spin those pretty lies about marriage proposals? My daughter saved your wretched life when you tried to end it all! And this is how you repay her kindness?"

Nathan's hands trembled violently as childhood trauma came crashing back. The suffocating memories he'd buried deep now clawed their way to the surface, stealing his breath.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore rushed Evelyn to Kingsley Medical Center. She'd insisted Theodore stay with Arabella - the poor girl was already hysterical with guilt. Evelyn couldn't bear to see her delicate sister's tears fall harder.

The blade had missed vital arteries, thanks to Evelyn's quick reflexes. When she emerged from treatment, her porcelain forearm bore a thick bandage beneath the sleeve of Alexander's tailored jacket.

"Keep it," he murmured, adjusting the coat around her slender frame. His fingers lingered near the gauze. "That dressing looks terrifying. Do you really want to frighten your sister and secretary?"

Evelyn's protest died on her lips. There was something dangerously persuasive about Alexander's consideration.

"Sir, may I ask why you were in our neighborhood?" Her eyes held quiet suspicion.

"I have a penthouse there." The lie came smoothly. While his family did own the development, Alexander resided elsewhere.

"How... coincidental." She let the matter drop, though her gaze remained shrewd.

Watching the nurses clean her wound had been torture. "You didn't even whimper," Alexander observed, admiration coloring his tone. "You're the bravest woman I've met."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Many women possess strength, Mr. Whitmore. You'll encounter others."

His lips curved. "I'm not interested in others."

A beat of silence. Then Evelyn's expression turned serious. "While I appreciate your help, carrying a stranger bridal style was... forward. I value personal boundaries."

Alexander adjusted his glasses, contrition in his clear gaze. "My apologies. Seeing you injured made me act rashly. I'll respect your space."

His sincerity disarmed her. Just as she began to relax, Evelyn realized something. "We haven't properly introduced ourselves—"

"Evelyn!" A familiar baritone voice sliced through the hospital corridor.
###Chapter 254

Nathan froze.

Evelyn turned slowly, her icy gaze cutting through him like a blade. The indifference in her eyes made him feel like a complete stranger.

Standing mere steps away, Nathan's body locked in place. Seeing Evelyn with Alexander Whitmore tore at his insides. His tall frame trembled violently, as if he'd been pushed from a skyscraper's edge.

His lips pressed into a thin line. Then he noticed the bandage wrapped around Evelyn's forearm. His chest constricted, legs moving instinctively toward her.

"Your arm—"

Evelyn recoiled like he carried the plague. Alexander immediately positioned himself as a human shield between them.

Nathan's throat closed up. The two men's gazes clashed, electricity crackling in the charged silence.

"I won't let what happened at Velvet Lounge repeat itself." Alexander adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, eyes darkening dangerously. "You stole her from me once. Do you really think I'd allow it again?"

"Who exactly are you to her?" Nathan's voice dropped to subzero temperatures. After being deceived by the Kingsley brothers, he couldn't shake the suspicion that this man might be another of Harrison's hidden sons.

But the way Alexander looked at Evelyn—that wasn't brotherly affection. That was raw, undisguised desire.

"Someone far more important than you'll ever be." Evelyn's voice sliced through the tension like a scalpel.

Alexander glanced back at her, lips curling in satisfaction.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn continued, each word dripping with disdain, "didn't I make myself perfectly clear at the karaoke bar? Your persistence is becoming pathetic."

Nathan's eyes burned crimson. "Evelyn, are you truly this naive? Getting drunk with a stranger—"

"Spare me your concern," she cut him off with a scoff. "Your hypocrisy makes me sick. I've already vomited once tonight—don't make me repeat the experience."

Each word struck like a physical blow. Nathan's pale lips parted, unleashing the jealousy festering in his chest.

The day's events had left him emotionally gutted. His pounding headache blurred his vision, pushing him toward complete collapse.

Why? Why couldn't he let go after the divorce?

Did he actually regret it?

The questions spiraled endlessly in his mind.

Had he been wrong from the very beginning?

"Mr. Blackwood!" Oliver Sinclair came rushing down the hallway. "Ms. Sterling—she's stabilized!"

The secretary's timing couldn't have been worse. By the time he noticed Evelyn's presence, the damage was done.

Taking in the tense atmosphere, Oliver wished he could vanish.

Alexander's smirk returned. "Ah, so you already have a partner. Yet here you are, harassing Ms. Kingsley? How very... modern of you."

Nathan's expression darkened while Oliver stood frozen.

Evelyn's eyes widened slightly. He knows my real name?

"Since you're divorced," Alexander continued coldly, "the decent thing would be to leave her alone. If you can't be a good husband, at least try being a decent human being."

"How dare—" Oliver stepped forward angrily.

"Enough." Evelyn cut in sharply. "Let's go."

Alexander immediately softened, falling into step beside her like an obedient shadow.

Nathan watched the striking pair disappear around the corner. His heart stuttered, blood turning to ice in his veins.
###Chapter 255

Someone else had taken the place beside Evelyn.

Nathan Blackwood instinctively pressed a hand to his chest, feeling his heart tremble violently. It ached so deeply, as if it had been carved out entirely.

Only now did Nathan truly grasp the finality of their divorce.

In the underground parking lot, Theodore Winslow hurried toward Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn the moment he spotted them.

"Ms. Carter, how are your injuries?"

"Just a scratch. Where’s the attacker?" That was all Evelyn cared about right now.

"Don’t worry. I’ve already had him taken to the secure holding facility. He won’t escape." Theodore leaned in, his voice low.

"Good. Theo, we have a major operation coming up in the next few days." Evelyn’s almond-shaped eyes narrowed dangerously as she gave his shoulder a firm pat.

Theodore nodded solemnly. "I’m always ready for battle."

"Wait here. I need to say goodbye to him first."

With that, Evelyn turned and walked back toward Alexander.

At that moment, the man standing beside the Bentley with his hands clasped behind his back looked like a masterpiece carved from ice and elegance.

"As you saw tonight, Mr. Blackwood and I have… complicated history."

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Alexander’s faintly smiling face. Guilt laced her tone as she admitted, "I had no choice but to drag you into this mess. I shouldn’t have involved you. I’m sorry."

"No need to apologize. It’s an honor to be of use to you." Alexander’s voice was smooth, laced with an undercurrent of something deeper.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, the words only making her feel worse.

The man’s smile deepened. "If you find me useful, you’re welcome to use me again."

"Sir, you’re joking." Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "I don’t want a repeat of tonight."

"Keep the wound dry for a week and watch for infection. It’s late—you should head home."

Though reluctance flickered in Alexander’s eyes, he knew when to step back. With a final glance, he turned to enter the car.

"Wait!" Evelyn knocked on the tinted window.

The glass slid down, revealing Alexander’s amused expression.

"You called me Ms. Carter in front of Nathan. How did you know who I was? You recognized me from the start, didn’t you?" Evelyn’s curiosity burned. If she didn’t get an answer, she wouldn’t sleep tonight.

"Yes." Alexander’s gaze locked onto hers, deep and unreadable.

"I never show my face publicly. Few people in Crestview know my real identity. How did you? Have we met before?" Her eyes sparkled with intensity.

Alexander’s lips curved slightly. "I’ll tell you… next time we meet."

His secretary and bodyguard entered the car, and the two luxury vehicles pulled away, leaving Evelyn standing there.

Suddenly, she smacked her forehead. "Damn it! I forgot to ask his name again!"

The Bentley glided through Crestview’s glittering nightscape.

Alexander stared out the window, but all he saw was Evelyn’s breathtaking face reflected in the neon lights.

He exhaled slowly, fingertips brushing the cold glass.

Evelyn… I never expected to find you like this.

"Mr. Whitmore, I did a quick check on Nathan Blackwood and Ms. Carter’s relationship. There’s no record of their marriage, but I discovered they finalized their divorce just this month."

The secretary scrolled through his tablet, then added cheerfully, "Ms. Carter is single now!"

"It doesn’t matter. She said I’m closer to her than Nathan ever was." The memory of those words sent a thrill through Alexander.

"Congratulations, Mr. Whitmore! You’ve already beaten Nathan Blackwood!" His secretary grinned.

Alexander’s expression darkened, his icy gaze softening only at the thought of Evelyn.

"This isn’t nearly enough."

His voice dropped to a whisper.

"What I want… is to be the only one in her heart."
###Chapter 256

The clock had struck midnight when they finally arrived at Evelyn's private villa.

Arabella Kingsley was consumed with worry for her sister, forcing herself to stay awake despite the exhaustion. Her bloodshot eyes and pale complexion made her look utterly drained.

"Evelyn, stop torturing yourself. I'm perfectly fine." Arabella pouted, fresh tears welling up in her eyes. "Don't you have classes tomorrow? You should be resting."

Evelyn settled beside her younger sister and pulled her into a warm embrace.

"Evelyn...am I useless?" Arabella's voice trembled. "You've always protected me since childhood. Even now that I'm grown, I still can't do anything for you."

The older sister flicked Arabella's forehead gently. "Don't be ridiculous, little star. Because of you and Aunt Camille, our family became whole again. You're our precious lucky charm."

Evelyn's expression softened as she continued, "If you truly want to help me, focus on your acting dreams. When you become famous, I'll make you Monarch Group's spokesperson. We'll keep the wealth in the family and save me a fortune. Deal?"

"I promise!" Arabella wiped her tears with determination before heading to bed, falling asleep the moment her head touched the pillow.

After tucking her sister in, Evelyn slipped out quietly, her demeanor shifting as she entered the study where Theodore Winslow awaited.

"Victoria Sterling was hospitalized tonight. What's the real story?" Evelyn's warmth vanished as she took her seat.

Theodore nodded. "She attempted suicide by wrist-cutting but was rescued in time. Nathan Blackwood hasn't left her side."

Evelyn's lips curled in a cold smile. "Naturally. That scheming witch would stage this drama for him. Even in death, she'd chain him to her side."

"What's your take on this suicide attempt, Miss Kingsley?"

"The year's most pathetic performance," Evelyn scoffed, massaging her temples. "She hasn't become Mrs. Blackwood nor destroyed me yet. Someone truly suicidal wouldn't arrange to be discovered."

"You believe this was purely theatrics?" Theodore frowned. "But why take such a risk when their wedding approaches? Has Nathan developed second thoughts?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Who knows? Maybe the groom's eyes wandered elsewhere. That man's always chasing greener pastures. It wouldn't surprise me if he discards her like yesterday's news."

"Frankly, I hope they marry as planned," Theodore muttered. "Let them rot together and spare the world their toxicity."

His expression turned grim. "Any leads on your attacker? Penelope Whitmore remains detained with Mr. Kingsley - she couldn't have orchestrated this."

Evelyn's eyes turned stormy. "That fighter came from underground rings - all brute force, no finesse. Penelope lacks connections, and Cassandra lacks opportunity. Only Victoria fits - she spent three years in Silvercrest with questionable company. My guess? One of her former lovers became her attack dog."

Theodore's eyes widened at her razor-sharp deduction.

"As for why he targeted me..." Evelyn shrugged. "Rather than speculate, we'll get answers tomorrow."

She leaned forward suddenly. "Tell me you didn't inform Sebastian about this."

Theodore sighed. "I followed your instructions precisely. Mr. Kingsley knows nothing."

"Thank goodness-" Evelyn's relief was cut short by her ringing phone.

Sebastian's name on the caller ID made her blood run cold. She shoved the device away like it burned.

Moments later, Theodore's phone rang. Swallowing hard, he answered. "Mr. Kingsley."

"Put Evelyn on. Now."

Though not on speaker, Sebastian's thunderous voice made Evelyn's eyelid twitch violently.
###Chapter 257

Theodore answered, "Ms. Carter has retired for the evening, Mr. Kingsley."

Sebastian's voice turned icy. "Theodore, you've grown bold. Are you conspiring with Evelyn to deceive me now?"

Though Sebastian rarely lost his temper, his anger was terrifying when unleashed. "I won't repeat myself."

"Put Evelyn on the phone. If she doesn't answer, you'll be relieved of your duties before sunrise."

Evelyn's pulse raced. Fear gripped her. She snatched the phone, pressing it to her ear with trembling fingers.

"Sebastian..."

A sharp inhale. Sebastian fought to steady himself before speaking in a low, controlled tone. "Evelyn, come outside. Now."

Heart pounding, Evelyn stepped through the villa's grand doors.

Beneath the amber glow of streetlamps, Sebastian stood rigid beside his sleek black Aston Martin. The tailored gray suit accentuated his imposing stature. Shadows elongated his silhouette, making him appear even more formidable.

Her breath caught.

God, he was breathtaking. But right now, all she felt was dread—like a delinquent student summoned to the headmaster's office.

"Sebastian..." She approached cautiously, lips pressed into a nervous pout.

His gaze flickered to her bare arms. "It's cold. We'll talk in the car."

Without another word, he shrugged off his jacket, draping it over her slender frame before guiding her into the plush interior.

The moment the door shut, his restraint shattered. Hands gripping her shoulders, his voice was raw. "Where did he hurt you?"

Her throat tightened. "...My arm."

Sebastian paled. With unsteady fingers, he pushed up her sleeve, revealing pristine white bandages. A muscle jumped in his jaw.

"It's nothing serious!" she rushed to explain. "Hardly even stings anymore—"

He abruptly released her, running a hand through his hair. When he spoke again, each word was a blade. "That man will die for touching you."

Her stomach dropped.

This wasn't the composed businessman the world knew. This was the ruthless underworld king who'd once made empires tremble—the version of Sebastian she'd begged him to bury.

"Sebastian, you promised." She pressed closer, cheek against his thundering heart. "No more vengeance. No more darkness. He's just a pawn—we should use him to find who's really behind this."

The fury in his eyes slowly banked. Reaching forward, he retrieved a dossier from the front seat. "Look."

She flipped it open—and gasped. "This is—"

"Theodore came to me weeks ago." Sebastian's voice was steel. "He was desperate to identify your attacker. But that idiot never mentioned your injury." A bitter laugh. "Convenient oversight."

Evelyn groaned inwardly. Theodore, you blabbermouth! Aloud, she defended, "I ordered him not to tell you. Don't blame him."

"One more secret kept from me," Sebastian said coldly, "and I'll personally return him to the Pembroke family. Permanently."

Evelyn clamped her lips shut.

She feared no one—except an enraged Sebastian. Around him, even her fiery spirit turned meek.

As she scanned the file, her breath hitched. Fingers tightening on the papers, she whispered, "It's him?"
###Chapter 258

The man's name was Dominic Reeves. Sebastian's file contained an exhaustive background check on him—even a detailed plastic surgery report.

He'd undergone complete facial reconstruction.

Evelyn gasped when she saw his pre-surgery photo. She recognized him instantly—Victoria's personal trainer and secret lover back in Silvercrest. Dominic had shown her his social media profile before.

"That's him!" Her voice trembled with excitement. "The one who assaulted Victoria!"

The memory of that scandalous photo—Victoria being groped in public—was seared into her mind.

Sebastian cleared his throat, his brows knitting together in disapproval. "Language, Evelyn."

"But I'm right!"

She flashed him a wicked grin, teeth clenched. "Oh, this is perfect. It has to be Victoria behind this."

Sebastian's expression darkened, his eyes glinting with icy fury. "I thought she was just petty and jealous. But orchestrating something like this? I underestimated how far she'd go."

Evelyn tapped her chin. "Still... why would he get a whole new face?"

"Maybe Victoria made him disappear—literally," she quipped, smirking.

"Keep reading," Sebastian murmured, his lips curving into an indulgent smile.

She flipped the page. A casino debt contract stared back at her.

"Well, well. A gambler." Her eyebrows shot up. "Five million dollars? That's not just bad luck—that's a death sentence."

Sebastian's voice was eerily calm. "He's drowning in debt. Casinos, banks, loan sharks—they all want him dead. Changing his face was the only way out."

Everything clicked into place.

Desperate for money, Dominic had tried extorting Victoria. And why not? As the fiancée of Blackwood Industries' CEO, she was a walking ATM.

But Victoria saw an opportunity.

Sebastian's breath turned ragged. He pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace, his arms like steel bands around her. His voice was raw. "She added one more condition."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. "Hurting me."

A humorless laugh escaped her. "Guess their communication sucked. Victoria never told him she was planning to die that day."

Suddenly, she gaped at Sebastian in awe. "But—how did you uncover all this so fast? It's only been hours. You even got his debt records."

She clutched the file tighter. "Are you magic?"

"Just lucky."

His fingers threaded through her hair, soothing. "The casino he frequented in Silvercrest? It's under Monarch Group's shadow network. A few calls, and I had everything."

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

Holy hell. The Kingsley intelligence web was terrifying—and impressive.

Meanwhile, Leonard Blackwood had buried Victoria's suicide attempt to protect Blackwood Industries' reputation.

In the study, father and son faced off in tense silence.

"Nathan," Leonard said coldly, "this ends one way: you marry Victoria immediately."

His tone brooked no argument. "Since a wedding takes time, we'll host an engagement ceremony first. The faster we control the narrative, the better."

"I'll handle her... episode."

Nathan's chest constricted, but his gaze never wavered. "I won't marry her."

Leonard's face purpled with rage. "You were the one obsessed with her! You divorced Evelyn in secret just to be with Victoria!"

His fist slammed onto the desk. "Now you've discarded your ex-wife and driven your fiancée to madness? What the hell is wrong with you? You're a disgrace to the Blackwood name!"

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smile. His eyes—sharp as daggers—pierced through Leonard.

The air between them crackled with hostility.
###Chapter 259

Nathan's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "What's so amusing, Leonard? Did my words strike you as humorous?"

"Indeed."

"Nathan Blackwood! How dare you!" Leonard's face flushed crimson with rage as he slammed his fist against the mahogany desk.

"Rather than pretending this marriage is about love, why not admit it's to salvage Blackwood Industries' reputation?" Nathan's voice dripped with disdain. "At least then I might respect your honesty. But to lecture me about character? The acorn never falls far from the tree."

The bitter irony in his laughter hung thick in the air.

Nathan wasn't certain whether he mocked Leonard or himself more in that moment.

"Explain yourself!" Leonard's eye twitched violently, his entire frame trembling with barely contained fury.

"I wanted to marry the Victoria I grew up with." Nathan's long lashes cast shadows over his hollow cheeks. "The woman she's become? I can no longer stomach the thought."

His fingers tightened around the armrests. "Yet she did save my life. Without her intervention that night, I wouldn't be standing here. So I'll play the devoted fiancé until her depression stabilizes. Then I'll end it properly."

"You—you'd actually leave Rosalind?" Leonard's voice cracked with disbelief.

"Without hesitation." The finality in Nathan's tone left no room for debate.

"Have you lost your mind? Victoria slit her wrists when you postponed the wedding! A breakup would destroy her completely!" Leonard's face purpled with apoplectic rage.

"Precisely why I'm waiting." Nathan's glacial gaze met his father's. "Once her doctors confirm recovery, I'll sever ties cleanly."

Leonard's pupils contracted sharply. He collapsed into his leather throne, studying his son with sudden shrewdness. "This sudden change of heart... does Evelyn Kingsley have anything to do with it?"

Nathan's pulse stuttered, yet his response came razor-sharp. "She's irrelevant."

"Don't lie to me, boy!" Leonard's mocking laugh echoed through the study. "I saw how you watched Evelyn leave Reginald's birthday gala. How you brought her home that night and humiliated Victoria before her. You've never been indecisive—if something didn't interest you, you'd discard it without a glance. Yet you keep making exceptions for Evelyn. Spare me the denials."

Nathan shot to his feet, veins bulging along his throat. "This isn't about Evelyn!"

His knuckles turned white against the desk. "Even if it were another woman entirely, Victoria had no right to target innocents. Her actions are inexcusable."

"All because she loves you!" Leonard's voice took on a strange fervor. "If she only cared about your wealth and status, why bother with Evelyn? Jealousy proves devotion! And after three years of marriage, isn't it natural she'd feel threatened?"

As he spoke, Leonard's mind flashed to Penelope—how she'd wept and schemed to keep him, how her desperate love had ensnared him completely. To him, this was love's true face.

"Evelyn loved me once too." The words tore from Nathan's throat like shards of glass. "In all our years together, she never harmed a soul. Since when did love justify cruelty?"

He turned toward the door, cutting off further debate.

"Nathan! You'd sacrifice Blackwood Industries for—"

"The company isn't yours alone to gamble with." Nathan didn't bother turning around. "My personal life won't affect our bottom line."

The door slammed with finality, leaving Leonard clutching the remnants of his shattered plans.
###Chapter 260

Nathan Blackwood emerged from the study with a ghostly pallor. His chest constricted painfully, each breath a struggle against invisible chains.

The memory of Evelyn Carter burned like a fresh brand on his soul. Even the slightest recollection sent searing pain through his entire being.

What terrified him most was the undeniable truth - Evelyn had once loved him deeply.

Pride ran through Nathan's veins like molten steel. Even during childhood poverty, he'd never bowed or begged.

Their relationship had become a high-stakes poker game where dignity, not money, was the ultimate prize.

Nathan would rather die than admit defeat in this battle of wills.

"Mr. Blackwood." Oliver Sinclair approached hurriedly. "Three urgent matters require your attention."

Nathan wiped the cold sweat from his brow. "Proceed."

"First, Ms. Sterling has regained consciousness but remains unstable. She's demanding to see you immediately."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Second matter?"

"The chairman has secured Hunter Lovett - no, Lawrence Pembroke - as Penelope's defense attorney. She'll be released by morning. Her cousin Vincent has taken full responsibility."

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Lawrence Pembroke? The senior partner at Westridge Legal?"

Oliver nodded. "What's fascinating is that he's actually Theodore Winslow's eldest brother. The Pembrokes' third son! The legal world truly is small."

A spark of recognition flashed in Nathan's dark eyes.

Though not among Crestview's wealthiest families, the Pembrokes dominated the legal sphere. Walter Pembroke, Theodore's father, was revered as the "Scales of Justice" in political circles.

Walter's three sons were equally formidable. Lawrence never lost a case. Gregory followed his father's judicial path. And Theodore...

Theodore Winslow had graduated top of his class from Crestview Law School, the youngest ever to earn a doctorate. Yet he chose to serve as Evelyn's personal secretary, managing her schedule like some glorified butler.

Evelyn always surrounded herself with extraordinary people.

The bitter taste of jealousy flooded Nathan's mouth. "Penelope's release changes nothing. She'll never regain her board position."

"Ms. Blackwood dealt a masterstroke! She eliminated that viper in one move!" Oliver chuckled. "We've gained significant advantage thanks to her."

Nathan's expression darkened. "If you admire her so much, perhaps you should seek employment elsewhere?"

Oliver's smile vanished.

"In all my victories, I never saw you this excited. Remember whose payroll you're on."

Oliver swallowed hard.

"The third matter?"

"Ah! We've identified the man with Ms. Blackwood last night. His identity will shock you."

Nathan's grip tightened on his desk. "Who?"

"Alexander Whitmore. Youngest son of Whitmore Enterprises' chairman. Recently returned from Serenia after years abroad."

"Alexander Whitmore?" Nathan's heart lurched.

Whitmore Enterprises controlled nearly half of Crestview's commercial real estate. The business world joked that while the Blackwoods ruled the south, the Whitmores owned the north.

Two dynasties separated by Starlight River - maintaining surface civility while waging silent economic warfare for decades.
###Chapter 261

Nathan had long been aware of the deep business ties between Monarch Group and Whitmore Enterprises, with their leaders sharing a friendship spanning two decades.

Did that mean Evelyn and Alexander had known each other since childhood?

Their intimate familiarity spoke volumes, as if no one else existed in their private world. Childhood sweethearts, perhaps?

Oliver sighed with visible envy. "Not surprising. Ms. Evelyn comes from extraordinary lineage - Harrison Kingsley's treasured daughter, a rare jewel beyond most men's reach."

"Just look at her suitors. Theodore Winslow, youngest son of Walter Pembroke? Barely qualified to carry her handbag."

The secretary's gaze flickered sympathetically toward his employer. Even as president of Blackwood Industries and soon-to-be vice chairman, Nathan's greatest claim to fame remained being Evelyn Kingsley's husband.

The revelation would undoubtedly turn every eligible bachelor in Crestview green with envy.

Nathan's chiseled jaw tightened visibly, veins protruding at his temples. His fist clenched against the wall as dark thoughts swirled.

Alexander Whitmore? Theodore Winslow? Was his wife collecting admirers like trophies?

"Oliver," he rasped, massaging his temple, "fetch my medication."

Under cover of darkness, a jade-green Rolls-Royce glided to a stop before an abandoned structure on Crestview's western outskirts.

This derelict building, acquired by Monarch Group years ago, concealed a damp basement perfect for... private conversations. Harrison Kingsley's foresight about the area's development had made the purchase strategic.

The musty air inside reeked of mildew as Evelyn entered alongside Sebastian. A rat scurried past her stilettos without eliciting so much as a flinch - her time with Doctors Without Borders had hardened her to worse conditions.

In the flickering light hung Dominic Reeves, his swollen face purple from prolonged inversion. At the Kingsleys' arrival, he writhed like a hooked fish, tears and mucus streaking his battered features.

"Mercy, Ms. Kingsley! I'll do anything! Just let me live!"

Evelyn's lips curled. The man who'd attacked her with such bravado had lasted barely three days before breaking.

Sebastian moved forward instinctively, only for Evelyn to block him with an outstretched arm. "We agreed this was mine to handle."

With visible effort, her brother stepped back.

Evelyn's stiletto connected sharply with Dominic's shoulder, sending him swinging violently. He retched, barely keeping his stomach contents down.

"I didn't know it was you! Victoria Sterling manipulated me! I'll confess everything!"

"Then answer this," Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "As Victoria's lover in Silvercrest... did she ever bear a child?"
###Chapter 262

Sebastian's piercing gaze darkened as he studied Evelyn with newfound intensity.

His little sister had always been ruthlessly opportunistic, playing by her own rules.

Give her the slightest opening, and she'd flip the entire gameboard on its unsuspecting players.

Dominic Reeves' face went deathly pale. He never anticipated Evelyn would uncover this particular secret!

"Your reaction tells me everything," Evelyn stated coldly, her lips curling in derision.

"I... I do know," Dominic stammered, his throat bobbing nervously. His voice shook as he admitted, "Because that... child... is mine and Victoria's."

Both Kingsley siblings froze in shock.

Evelyn's delicate fingers clenched in triumph. Her risky gamble had paid off spectacularly.

"Explain. Now." Sebastian's voice cut through the air like shards of ice.

Dominic swallowed hard before continuing, "I used to work as a personal trainer at an exclusive gym in Silvercrest. Victoria became my client, and... things escalated. She was incredibly seductive, always initiating things. Eventually we started an affair."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Continue."

"It was always understood to be casual. Victoria had other men, and I was just one of them. Then one night we... experimented with substances. She was high, we didn't use protection..." Dominic wiped his sweaty brow. "Even though she took emergency contraception, it's not foolproof. Soon after, she discovered she was pregnant."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with dark amusement. How fascinating - the pristine Victoria Sterling had a drug habit. The revelations kept coming.

"Given Victoria's ruthless nature, why didn't she terminate?" Evelyn pressed.

Dominic shifted uncomfortably. "She claimed her reproductive system was too fragile. Said she'd never conceive again if she aborted. That no elite family would accept an infertile wife." His mouth twisted bitterly. "So she carried to term."

The mention of children sent a sharp pang through Evelyn, but she schooled her features into icy composure. "Where is the child now?"

"I only know she's at an orphanage in southern Silvercrest. She'd be about three now... That's all I know!" Dominic confessed desperately.

The man clearly had no paternal instincts, having never once visited his own daughter. He was sweating bullets trying to recall even these scant details.

"You're disgusting," Sebastian spat with barely contained fury. "Your own flesh and blood, abandoned like garbage?"

"W-wait! Victoria's mother has been secretly monitoring the girl! She took the baby immediately after birth. That woman would know where she is!" Dominic blurted, eager to avoid further punishment.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with sudden determination as she exchanged a meaningful glance with Sebastian. In that silent moment, the siblings reached perfect understanding.

Just then, the basement door burst open. A security guard hurried in clutching Dominic's ringing phone.

"Miss Kingsley, urgent call," he announced.

Evelyn glanced at the screen with disdain. "Who's Adrienne?"

Dominic paled further. "That's... Victoria."

"Answer it," Evelyn commanded, thrusting the phone toward him. Her gaze turned glacial. "No warnings. No hints. Act completely normal."

Trembling, Dominic nodded like a chastened dog.

He accepted the call. "Adrienne. Calling so late? Miss me?"

"Don't flatter yourself." Victoria's voice dripped with condescension. "You haven't done anything stupid, have you? I told you to wait for my signal. You haven't screwed up, right?"

Dominic's jaw clenched. "No, I've done nothing. Just waiting for your orders."

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile as she lowered her lashes, the perfect picture of deceptive calm.
###Chapter 263

Sebastian had taken matters into his own hands. He made a move against Evelyn without Victoria's knowledge.

This reckless action landed them in their current crisis because he desperately needed money. He hoped to quickly resolve the situation to claim his reward from Victoria.

What a treacherous ally!

Victoria's voice turned icy through the phone. "Don't lay a finger on Evelyn until I give explicit orders. The situation has improved now that I've regained Nathan's trust. Leonard has even approved our marriage, so our engagement announcement should happen soon."

Dominic thought, Engagement?

His worried eyes darted toward his sister. Evelyn remained impassive. She casually stretched, her eyelids drooping with boredom. Dominic couldn't suppress a smirk at his sister's indifferent reaction.

"Now that you and Nathan are reconciled, what about my $5 million?" Sebastian demanded impatiently.

Victoria snapped, "Must you be so insistent about such petty cash? I'll transfer $50,000 immediately. Spend it however you like. Once Nathan and I finalize everything and complete the engagement ceremony, you'll get the remaining balance."

"Do you still want me to deal with Evelyn?" Sebastian asked.

"Make sure she suffers," Victoria hissed, venom dripping from every word. "That woman has made my existence unbearable. I want her remaining days filled with unending torment. Even if I can't break her limbs, I'll ruin that perfect face of hers!"

The call ended, leaving Sebastian visibly shaken by Victoria's malice. In stark contrast, Evelyn remained composed, demonstrating extraordinary emotional control.

"You've performed adequately. I'll contact you if needed," Evelyn stated calmly.

Just then, Evelyn's phone buzzed. Theodore was calling. She answered while turning to exit the underground chamber.

As Evelyn departed, the atmosphere grew heavy. Sebastian's eyes bulged in terror as Dominic advanced toward him.

Dominic radiated an otherworldly chill, as though he'd emerged from the underworld itself.

He slowly crouched down, his movements deliberate.

From his suit jacket, he produced a silver dagger shaped like a cross. Its blade caught the dim basement light, glinting ominously. The weapon hovered near Sebastian's throat, threatening decapitation at any moment.

Though Dominic remained still, Sebastian trembled violently, as if facing Death himself.

"My sister's injury," Dominic said quietly, "was your doing."

"I-I'm sorry," Sebastian stammered.

Dominic shook his head, closing his eyes in prayer. "Merciful Father, forgive my sins. All I do is for those I love."

A bloodcurdling scream soon echoed through the dungeon as Dominic severed the tendons in Sebastian's wrist.

Outside in the empty field, Theodore stood waiting alone. His normally handsome features appeared gaunt and pale with exhaustion.

"Theodore, what's wrong?" Evelyn asked with concern, noting his pallid complexion.

Theodore gazed at Evelyn with sorrow-filled eyes. His voice shook as he whispered, "Ms. Carter... I'm so sorry..."
###Chapter 264

"Theodore, what's wrong?" Evelyn asked with concern. Her breath caught as she took in his disheveled appearance.

The usually composed Theodore stood before her with bloodshot eyes and trembling lips, looking utterly devastated.

Sebastian stepped forward from behind Evelyn, drying his hands with a monogrammed handkerchief. Evelyn's gaze flickered to the crimson stains marring the fine linen. She exhaled sharply—her brother had once again taken justice into his own hands, denying her the chance to demonstrate her strategic brilliance.

"I'm so sorry... truly sorry!" Theodore's voice cracked as he bowed deeply, the weight of his apology hanging heavily between them.

Evelyn's phone buzzed abruptly. Dominic's name flashed across the screen.

"Dominic?" she answered.

"Evelyn, Penelope just left my office." Dominic's tone carried equal parts frustration and self-reproach.

He continued, "My team has spent days compiling evidence of her embezzlement and bribery schemes. But she was prepared—every trail now leads to Vincent Whitmore."

A bitter chuckle escaped him. "Leonard hired Lawrence Pembroke. That man could defend the devil himself with his loophole exploitation. Without concrete proof, we had to release her."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. "You did everything possible. The Westridge project remains ours—that's what matters. We'll handle the rest when the time comes."

Unlike the seething men surrounding her, Evelyn remained composed. Their collective rage could incinerate Penelope where she stood.

Though Penelope was despicable, Evelyn understood a crucial truth: reckless vengeance bred mistakes. Leonard's obsession with his wife guaranteed he'd move heaven and earth to protect her. Escalating this into a corporate war over a single project? Not worth the fallout.

Dominic sighed. "Theodore called me earlier. Poor man sounded devastated. Please reassure him this isn't his fault."

Another weary exhale. "He's torturing himself over you—terrified you'd blame him, so he's shouldering guilt that isn't his to bear."

"I see," Evelyn murmured.

Ending the call, she turned to Theodore with newfound understanding. "Theodore..."

His knuckles whitened as he clenched his fists. "Ms. Carter, my family has failed you. I'll accept any consequences."

Earlier that day, Theodore had discovered his brother Lawrence took Penelope's case. The revelation sent him storming into Pembroke & Associates, where their argument turned explosive.

"Our father was a man of integrity! He spent his career prosecuting corrupt officials—do you remember how they came for us after his retirement? If not for Harrison Kingsley hiring him as legal counsel, shielding our family under Monarch Group's protection, where would we be now? How dare you represent the Blackwoods against Evelyn? This is betrayal!"

Twenty years of brotherly harmony shattered in that office. Theodore had never stood his ground so fiercely—not until Evelyn's honor was at stake.

Lawrence's retort still echoed: "The Blackwoods showed us kindness, but we owe them no fealty! Father spent decades winning cases for Leonard—any debt is paid. I'm a lawyer first. Every client deserves my best effort, regardless of personal ties. But you? Our parents sacrificed everything for your education, not to make you the Kingsleys' lapdog!"

Those words had carved Theodore's heart open. Torn between familial duty and unspoken love for Evelyn, he'd returned to her feeling unworthy.

"Theodore, listen to me." Evelyn closed the distance between them, her touch gentle as she steadied his shaking shoulders.

"Don't torment yourself. We won't let Penelope poison relationships that matter. She's not worth our anguish."

"Ms. Carter, I—" His voice fractured under the weight of shame.

Evelyn interrupted firmly. "Lawrence is doing his job—as he should. When we need legal counsel, I trust your family will stand with us. Isn't that right?"

Theodore's nod was barely perceptible, his gaze fixed on the floor.

The trio entered the waiting car. Sebastian laced his fingers through Evelyn's, his thumb tracing circles on her palm. "What's our next move, darling?"
###Chapter 265

Sebastian leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. "To find Victoria's illegitimate daughter, we'll need to draw them out of hiding."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with quiet determination. "Dominic let it slip that only Victoria's mother knows where the child is. So, we'll have Margaret lead us straight to her—no need for our own investigation."

Nathan chuckled, a mysterious smile playing on his lips. "And what about Victoria? How do you plan to handle her?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "If you want to destroy someone, you have to break them first—make them lose control."

She stifled a yawn, rubbing her tired eyes. "She's about to get engaged to Nathan, right? If we don't let her enjoy the spotlight, how can we crush her completely?"

Nathan's thoughts flickered back to the situation. He added, "Speaking of Nathan, that man is truly blind."

Evelyn scoffed. "It doesn't matter if he's blind or not. I know my worth now. A man like him means nothing to me anymore."

Suddenly, Evelyn's eyes widened as she remembered something. She quickly pulled out her phone and scrolled through her gallery, revealing a series of covertly taken photos of Alexander.

"Seb," she said, her voice laced with curiosity, "look at this man. Do you recognize him?"

She continued, "The day Dominic almost got the upper hand on me, this gentleman intervened just in time. That's why I only ended up with minor injuries."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Really? You should thank him properly, then."

Evelyn sighed. "He’s being annoyingly mysterious."

A playful smirk tugged at her lips. "I asked him who he was, but he refused to tell me. What’s even more interesting? He already knew exactly who I was."

The image of Alexander’s sharp, striking features flashed in her mind. Her curiosity burned brighter.

Beneath her composed exterior, Evelyn thrived on control. The idea of someone slipping through her grasp unsettled her.

Sebastian leaned closer, studying the man in the photo.

Then, his eyes widened in recognition. He looked at Evelyn in disbelief. "Evie, you seriously don’t recognize him?"

Evelyn blinked. "Should I?"

"When you were little, I remember you two were practically inseparable."

"What?!" she exclaimed, scrutinizing the photo again. He did seem familiar, but the memory remained just out of reach.

Sebastian continued, "Alexander Whitmore, from the Whitmore family. He was quiet as a child—barely spoke to anyone. You were the only one he ever played with. You’ve really forgotten?"

Evelyn gasped. "That’s Critter?!"

She stared in disbelief. "What kind of miracle diet did he have to grow up like that?"

Late that night, Alexander’s private club, Vertigo, buzzed with energy.

Under the dim, moody lighting, laughter and clinking glasses filled the air. Couples whispered in corners, lost in their own worlds.

Amid the chaos, Alexander sat alone in a secluded booth, exuding an aura of quiet authority. His presence alone kept women at bay. He was infamous—cold, ruthless, and intolerant of fools. No one dared cross him unless they wanted to vanish from Crestview.

A tipsy man stumbled toward him, slurring his words. "I can’t make it to the yacht party in two days."

He swayed, leaning heavily against Alexander. "My father’s forcing me on a blind date. Burp! Who the hell gets married in their twenties? Only Nathan Blackwood would rush into something like that."

Alexander took a slow sip of red wine. "If you don’t want to go, say no."

"I can’t," the man groaned, loosening his tie. "She’s the daughter of Harrison Kingsley—the richest man in Fairhaven. What’s her name? Evelyn—"

Alexander’s grip on his glass tightened. His eyes darkened. "I have a solution."

The man perked up. "Tell me."

Alexander finished his wine. The shifting lights cast shadows across his sharp features, making him look even more dangerous.

He smirked. "You go to the yacht party. I’ll take the blind date for you."
###Chapter 266

Penelope Whitmore finally stepped out of the district attorney's office after nearly a week, her exhaustion evident.

Without her usual high-end makeup, her face was pallid and drawn, as though she had aged ten years overnight.

A few strands of silver hair stood out starkly against her dark locks.

Dreading the swarm of reporters, Penelope couldn't bear the thought of returning home in such a wretched state.

She feared Leonard might see her like this—her carefully cultivated image would shatter in an instant.

Understanding her distress, Cassandra accompanied her to an upscale salon first, where she freshened up before facing the world again.

As they left, Penelope adjusted her hair in the mirror with a dark expression. "Let's not go home yet. We should visit Victoria."

She exhaled sharply. "After all, she's my niece. After risking my life for her, I can't afford to seem indifferent. I must maintain my kind and compassionate image for your father."

Twenty-five years of meticulous image-building—it cannot crumble now.

Cassandra frowned. "Mom! Victoria actually attempted suicide!"

Though she disliked Victoria, the memory of that bloodied bathroom still haunted her. "Forget whether Nathan will fall for her act—what if no one had found her in time? She could have died! She's ruthless, even to herself!"

Penelope smirked, tucking her compact away. "Oh, someone was always going to find her in time."

Cassandra gasped as realization struck. "Mom! Did you—?"

Penelope pressed a finger to her lips, silencing her.

The suicide attempt had been Penelope's idea—a calculated move to evoke Nathan's sympathy. She had used the same tactic years ago to win Leonard's pity, securing her place in the Blackwood family and the life she now enjoyed.

Nathan had battled depression before, and Victoria had been his pillar during that dark period. Triggering those memories would remind him of her virtues. The risk was high, but the potential reward was even greater.

"Even if Victoria isn't perfect, I won't allow that wretched Evelyn to worm her way back into Nathan's life!"

Penelope clenched her fists, fury simmering beneath her composed exterior. Evelyn, how dare you play games with me? I swear, I won't let you win!

"The Kingsleys may be powerful in Fairhaven, but that's just a small town," Penelope hissed. "In Crestview, the Blackwoods rule."

Cassandra's eyes gleamed with malice. "We'll have plenty of chances to deal with that woman later." She hadn't forgotten the humiliation of Evelyn throwing slippers in her face.

As they reached Victoria's hospital room, they learned Leonard and Nathan were already inside. Penelope immediately slipped into her role as the devoted aunt, tears welling in her eyes.

"Victoria! My dear girl!" She rushed in, pulling Victoria into a dramatic embrace. "How could you do something so reckless?"

In front of the men, she sobbed uncontrollably. "Why must the women in our family suffer like this? Framed, tormented—I can't take it anymore!"

"Aunt Penelope, please don't cry..." Victoria played her part flawlessly, her voice trembling with feigned distress.

Margaret, standing nearby, joined the performance, turning the room into a scene of melodramatic grief.

Nathan watched them silently, his expression unreadable. Victoria stole a glance at him, but his icy detachment sent a chill down her spine.

Once, her tears would have moved him instantly. He would have been the first to comfort her.

Now, that tenderness was gone—stolen by Evelyn.

The three women clung to each other, weeping, while Leonard's frown deepened.

"Penelope, Nathan," he said gravely. "Come with me. We need to talk."

Moments later, in the private lounge, Penelope gasped. "Leonard—!"
###Chapter 267

Tears cascaded down Penelope's porcelain cheeks as she gazed at Leonard with desperate, pleading eyes. "I thought I'd lost you forever," she whispered hoarsely. "These past days...they've been pure torture! I was terrified, Leo—"

Leonard's heart ached seeing his wife's distress. The usually composed socialite now looked utterly broken.

Yet the weight of recent events pressed heavily on his shoulders. The last thing he felt capable of was offering comfort.

The wall-mounted television suddenly blared to life with breaking news, capturing their attention.

The screen displayed Sebastian Kingsley, CEO of Monarch Group, shaking hands with Mayor Harrington at the Westridge project signing ceremony. Flashes from press cameras illuminated their triumphant smiles as contracts were exchanged.

Nathan's knuckles turned white around his teacup, veins protruding along his tense forearm. His aristocratic features hardened into an icy mask as fury simmered beneath the surface.

Simultaneously, Leonard's expression darkened. That cunning Evelyn stole what rightfully belonged to us, he thought bitterly.

Penelope's pulse quickened. She clutched Leonard's arm, her voice dripping with venom. "She's gone too far this time! What did our family ever do to deserve this? First stealing our project, now trying to imprison me! After everything we did for her during her marriage to Nathan—"

"Kindness?" Nathan interrupted coolly, setting down his cup with deliberate precision. "You consider three years of domestic servitude as kindness?"

Penelope's manicured nails dug into her palms. "She chose that life willingly! Nobody forced her hand!"

"Penelope," Leonard finally spoke, his voice grave. "There's something you need to know." He took a measured breath. "The board has made its decision. Effective immediately, Nathan assumes presidency of Blackwood Industries and the deputy chairmanship. This isn't negotiable."

The words struck Penelope like a physical blow.

"What?" she gasped, her face draining of color. "Leo, how could you—"

Leonard remained silent, his jaw clenched.

Nathan observed their interaction with detached amusement. How touching—the mighty Leonard Blackwood actually hesitating to crush his wife's ambitions.

"The reason should be obvious, Aunt Penelope," Nathan interjected smoothly. "A senior executive under investigation for bribery, abuse of power, and corruption charges can hardly retain a leadership position. The scandal would make Blackwood Industries the laughingstock of Crestview's business elite."

"Framed!" Penelope shrieked, bolting upright. "This is all Evelyn's doing! She used Vincent's confession to set me up!"

Her vision swam as rage overwhelmed her. "Vincent admitted everything! I had no part in it! Why shouldn't I remain deputy chair?"

Nathan merely smirked and strode from the room, leaving Penelope trembling with impotent fury. That wretched bastard! she seethed internally.

She turned desperate eyes to Leonard. "You promised me that position! After twenty-five years of marriage, you'd trust rumors over your own wife?" Her voice cracked with theatrical distress.

Leonard wrenched his arm free with surprising force. "Blackwood Industries answers to shareholders, Penelope. Not my personal promises." His piercing gaze held hers. "And tell me truthfully—are you truly innocent?"

The question hung between them like a guillotine.

Penelope's breath hitched. The calculating glint in Leonard's eyes chilled her to the core.

It's over, she realized with dawning horror. All my schemes, everything I've worked for—gone in an instant.
###Chapter 268

The sterile white walls of the hospital room seemed to close in as Victoria Sterling lay weakly on the bed, her mother Margaret Sterling sitting beside her.

"Your father pulled every string he could to hire Lawrence Pembroke for your aunt's release," Margaret said, her voice laced with satisfaction. "He even spent a fortune. That just proves how much your uncle still cares for her."

She leaned in closer, her tone brightening. "And thanks to Penelope Whitmore, your engagement to Nathan is practically set in stone!"

Margaret's eyes sparkled with triumph. "He's been visiting you every single day, hasn't he? The way he speaks to you—so gentle, so attentive. There's no denying it, the two of you have grown closer."

The mere thought of becoming the mother-in-law of Blackwood Industries' president sent a thrill through her. She tilted her head. "You know Nathan better than I do. If he truly despised you, why would he bother coming here at all?"

Victoria bit her lip, her fingers twisting the edge of the blanket. "I know, but... something feels off."

Nathan's cold, distant gaze haunted her. Even though he had been by her side these past few days, something about him had changed.

Margaret waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, stop overthinking it."

Just then, the door swung open, and Nathan strode in.

Victoria immediately transformed—her posture slumped, her voice weak and trembling. "Nathan..."

He approached, his expression unreadable. She reached out, hoping for the warmth of his touch, but he stopped just out of reach. Her hand hovered awkwardly in the air, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

"I have business at the office," he said, his tone polite but icy. "I'll come back tonight."

"Nathan, I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused you," Victoria whispered, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "It's all my fault..."

"Rest. Don't dwell on it."

With that, he turned and left.

Victoria's grip on the sheets tightened, her nails digging into the fabric. This wasn't the Nathan who had once doted on her. The way he looked at her now sent chills down her spine.

Panicked, she shot Margaret a desperate glance.

Understanding, Margaret hurried after him.

"Nathan!" she called out.

He stopped, turning to face her with an impassive stare. "Yes?"

Margaret dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. "You've seen how fragile Victoria is. She's only coherent when you're here. The moment you leave, she falls apart. She suffered so much abroad, all for the chance to return to you. If you abandon her now, she'll be ruined!"

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "I'll take responsibility for her recovery. After all, she did save my life once."

Then he walked away, leaving Margaret standing there, a cold dread settling in her chest.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter was buried in work, coordinating high-level meetings and perfecting the wedding planning project.

Her team was deep in discussion when her phone rang.

She answered without looking. "Harrison, I'm in the middle of something. What is it?" She balanced the phone between her ear and shoulder, flipping through documents.

The room fell silent.

Harrison Kingsley?!

Every head turned, eyes wide. The mere mention of the Monarch Group chairman sent a ripple of shock through the team.

This was a man most of them would never even glimpse in their lifetimes!

Then, in a low, abrupt tone, Harrison said, "It's time."

Evelyn blinked. "Huh?"

His voice suddenly boomed through the speaker. "Your blind date! You'd better go, or else!"

She jerked the phone away from her ear, wincing.

The entire room heard.

Jaws dropped.

The brilliant, elegant Evelyn Carter—whose wealth could rival a small nation—needed a blind date?!
###Chapter 269

Would ordinary people even stand a chance at love if someone like Evelyn struggled to find a partner?

"Nathan, I'm in the middle of a meeting. Save the trivial talk for later." Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose, irritation lacing her voice.

"Trivial?" Nathan scoffed. "Choosing a life partner is trivial to you? Let me be blunt—do you think being CEO of Monarch Group is trivial?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw. That sly old fox. He was using his position to corner her. Did he learn these manipulative tactics from Harrison?

"Fine, I'll go. But not today—I have an important meeting." She seized the excuse, buying herself time.

"You can delay, but you can't avoid it forever."

The dismissal in his tone grated on her.

The meeting dragged on, tension thickening the air. Everyone tread carefully, wary of provoking Evelyn and facing her wrath.

Back in her office, she collapsed onto the sofa, exhaustion weighing her down like a lead blanket.

Theodore entered with a steaming cup of coffee, concern etching his features. "Ms. Carter, is the project giving you trouble?"

Evelyn groaned. "Harrison, that ruthless schemer!"

She kicked off her heels, tucking her feet beneath her. Theodore hesitated only a second before draping a cashmere throw over her legs. His hands moved with practiced ease as he massaged her calves.

Apart from his mother, he'd never cared for anyone so devotedly.

Eyes closed, Evelyn murmured, "I want to shoulder this responsibility—to free Sebastian completely. I am capable."

More than capable. Power and strategy thrilled her. Had it not been for her disastrous marriage, she would've claimed the CEO title long ago.

I'll make up for every second wasted on that worthless man.

Theodore's voice softened. "The blind date might not be terrible. Think of it as meeting a new friend. The Chairman isn't forcing marriage—he just worries for you."

Jealousy pricked him, though he buried it deep. He'd always known his place. How could someone like me ever deserve Evelyn Carter?

"You're right. It's just a date." A sly smile curled her lips as she wiggled her toes. "He has his games, but I have mine."

Theodore's chest warmed at her playful grin. "What scheme are you plotting now?"

Evelyn sprang up, padding barefoot toward her desk. Theodore snatched her heels, following. "At least wear these—you'll catch a chill."

She lifted a foot, letting him slide the shoe on. Grabbing a pen, she scribbled furiously before thrusting the list at him. "Have everything here by tonight."

Theodore scanned it and chuckled. "Ms. Carter, you're positively wicked."
###Chapter 270

Under Chairman Kingsley's careful orchestration, Evelyn's blind dates were arranged with military precision.

Evelyn applied her ridiculous makeup in the powder room while Theodore waited outside, scrolling through his tablet to review the day's itinerary.

"11:30 a.m. luncheon with Mr. Chamberlain from Whitmore Enterprises. 1:30 p.m. tea with the heir of Sterling Holdings. 3:30 p.m. private opera box with the youngest son of Luxe Furnishings."

"Two hours each? How efficient." Evelyn rolled her eyes. Even cattle at auction get more time to make an impression, she thought bitterly.

The bathroom door swung open with dramatic flair. When Evelyn emerged in full disguise, Theodore's professional composure shattered into laughter.

"Ms. Carter, you've truly... outdone yourself." Theodore struggled to speak through his giggles.

She'd transformed into a walking catastrophe - fake freckles dotted her cheeks beneath a tangled bird's nest wig. A smudged "mustache" adorned her upper lip. Leaning against the doorframe with one finger digging in her nose, she looked like a rejected circus clown.

"Think this is enough? I was considering adding some realistic scars!" Evelyn grinned, flashing her deliberately blackened tooth.

Theodore, normally the picture of professional restraint, clutched his stomach as laughter overtook him. Evelyn seized the moment to snap a selfie and bombard the Kingsley Intelligence Network group chat.

The response was instantaneous.

[Sebastian: I beg your pardon. Who let this creature into our chat?]

[Evelyn: Hey handsome! Care to take a wild guess?]

[Maxwell: dying laughing emoji Evelyn, this is absolute gold!]

[Dominic: Jesus Christ! Nearly gave me a heart attack before my morning coffee! Almost spilled my latte all over my case files!]

[Donovan: Darling, even for cosplay, couldn't you choose something more... flattering?]

[Maxwell: Why not go as Ophelia? I'll play Hamlet! We can recreate the famous drowning scene!]

Maxwell flooded the chat with romantic GIFs, which Dominic countered with violent reaction images. Though separated by Maxwell's covert operations, their sibling rivalry knew no bounds.

[Evelyn: Gentlemen, as connoisseurs of the fairer sex, what are my chances of landing a husband looking like this?]

[Dominic: Negative 100%!]

[Sebastian: True beauty lies within one's character, not their appearance. Any worthy man would recognize your exceptional qualities, dear sister.]

[Donovan: Facial recognition was never my strong suit, but I know brilliance when I see it. These men would be fortunate to know you, disguise notwithstanding.]

[Maxwell: Honestly? I'm more of a legs man myself. winking emoji Dominic, as a public official, shouldn't you be more open-minded?]

[Dominic: Oh please! Since when did you become the morality police?!]

Evelyn's laughter echoed through the penthouse as she read their responses. Dominic's brutal honesty would be his downfall one day, she mused.

[Evelyn: Wish me luck! First victim arrives in twenty minutes.]

[Sebastian: May divine providence smile upon you and your unfortunate suitor.]

[Dominic: Evelyn, if some trust fund baby actually falls for this look, marry him immediately. That level of poor judgment suggests he's perfect for our family!]

[Evelyn: Oh darling, if anyone proposes today, I'm gifting them a lifetime membership to Kingsley Medical Center - they'll clearly need the psychiatric care!]

Meanwhile, Theodore's phone vibrated incessantly. While Evelyn adjusted her hideous wig, he checked the barrage of private messages from all four Kingsley brothers. The content varied only slightly.

[Kingsley Brothers: Keep eyes on Evelyn. Any problems, you call us immediately.]

[Theodore: Understood. Her safety is my top priority.]

[Kingsley Brothers: Who said we're worried about her? We're concerned for the poor bastards she's meeting!]

Theodore smirked. The family resemblance was uncanny.

And so Evelyn's disastrous matchmaking marathon began.

Ever the pragmatist, Evelyn decided to treat this as a surgical strike - eliminate all targets in one day. To her astonishment, despite her deliberately repulsive appearance, each wealthy bachelor remained impeccably polite. Their unflappable composure in the face of her absurdity was almost... suspicious.
###Chapter 271

Evelyn studied her reflection in the mirror, her fingers tracing the deliberately applied freckles. "Is my natural charm so irresistible that even this ridiculous disguise can't conceal it?" she muttered. "Or are these men just desperate to become Harrison Kingsley's son-in-law?" A wave of disgust washed over her as she examined her artificially plain features.

The intoxication of power truly knew no bounds. It could make rational men willingly blind themselves to reality. Thank heavens she'd come prepared with multiple escape plans.

Her first date had been at an upscale bistro. With practiced innocence, Evelyn had offered to read his pulse, then dramatically declared his organs were failing like a septuagenarian's. The thirty-year-old heir had turned purple with rage before storming out mid-appetizer.

The second encounter took place in a garden café. Evelyn spent the entire afternoon staring intently at the empty space behind her companion's chair. When the flustered gentleman finally asked what held her attention, she'd whispered, "Mr. Walter, there's a pale little boy standing right behind you. He keeps tugging at your jacket. Shouldn't we offer him some cake?" Her voice dropped to a haunted whisper. "He looks... hungry."

That suitor hadn't even waited for the check before fleeing.

Date number three had been deceptively normal - a matinee performance followed by tea. As they exited the theater, Mr. Lee politely suggested continuing their evening. "Ms. Kingsley, I've thoroughly enjoyed your company. Would you care to join me for dinner?"

Evelyn beamed. "What a lovely idea!" She reached for her oversized tote bag, letting the bold red lettering catch the light: FAIRHAVEN PSYCHIATRIC CENTER - PATIENT BELONGINGS.

"Mr. Lee," she asked sweetly as his face drained of color, "why are you backing away? The voices say you should stay for dessert."

Now, as twilight painted the teahouse in golden hues, Evelyn and Theodore waited for the fourth and final candidate. The tranquil space reminded her of Willow Creek Estate, with its delicate aroma of jasmine tea and the soft murmur of a bamboo water feature.

Theodore watched her with growing apprehension. "Ms. Evelyn, while your methods are... creative, aren't you concerned these gentlemen might spread unpleasant rumors? Your reputation in Crestview—"

"Let them talk!" Evelyn laughed, expertly darkening another freckle with her eyeliner. "The more they claim Harrison Kingsley's daughter is unhinged, the better. This should finally make Father abandon his matchmaking schemes." She smirked at her reflection. "Trying to outmaneuver me? He's losing his edge."

Theodore's lips twitched. "Though wouldn't it be simpler if your true match appeared? Someone who sees beyond... all this?" His gaze held unspoken longing.

Evelyn sighed, stowing her makeup. "Believe me, I'd love nothing more than to stop this ridiculous parade of suitors."

As Theodore's phone buzzed, Evelyn turned to the window, breathing in the fragrant evening air. The rustling leaves and distant birdsong almost made her forget this entire charade.

Then the door slid open.

The measured cadence of Italian leather soles announced the newcomer's approach. An unusual fragrance preceded him - not the predictable colognes of wealthy bachelors, but something far more intriguing. Violet leaves blended with something floral yet masculine, like moonlit gardens and secrets.

Evelyn's eyes fluttered open as the scent wrapped around her. Slowly, deliberately, she turned to inspect her final date of the evening.

Her breath caught.

Alexander Whitmore stood before her, impeccably dressed, a single white rose in hand. "My deepest apologies for the delay, Ms. Kingsley," he murmured, his voice like velvet over steel.

Theodore discreetly exited as Evelyn's pulse quickened. This was no ordinary suitor - this was the man who'd haunted her dreams since childhood. Critter had grown up, and the game had just become infinitely more complicated.
###Chapter 272

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. "Why is it you?"

Though her freckled face was half-hidden beneath a messy wig that resembled a bird's nest, there was still an undeniable innocence in her expression. Alexander Whitmore flashed her a charming smile. "Can't I be your blind date?"

She pressed her lips together, momentarily speechless. His directness caught her off guard, but the warmth in his gaze eased the tension. Part of her wondered if this was just another one of his playful jokes.

"Mind if I take a seat?" he asked politely.

"Please do," Evelyn replied, smoothing her skirt as she gestured to the chair across from her.

Alexander looked every bit the refined gentleman she remembered—dressed in a tailored navy pinstripe suit, his gold-rimmed glasses adding an air of sophistication.

"Evelyn, you look delightfully unique today," he remarked, his eyes crinkling with amusement. "But you don’t have to pretend with me. Just be yourself."

She cleared her throat awkwardly. "I distinctly recall my blind date wasn’t supposed to be with you. What are you doing here?"

His lips curved into a knowing smile as he adjusted his glasses. "Because I had a feeling you might want to see me again. And as it turns out, I was right."

Evelyn studied him, her curiosity piqued. "Interesting. Ever since we first met, I’ve been wondering about who you really are. So yes, I did hope to run into you again." She met his gaze directly. "Thank you for your help, Alexander. You’re the fourth son of the Whitmore family, aren’t you?"

A flicker of surprise passed through his deep-set eyes, and his fingers twitched imperceptibly against his knee. Suppressing his reaction, he replied smoothly, "Evelyn, it’s been a long time."

She hesitated before responding politely, "It’s nice to see you again."

Though they had shared a childhood friendship, over a decade had passed since they last met. The man sitting before her now felt like a stranger.

Her memories of him were faint—a small, quiet boy with delicate features who had often been the target of bullies. Back then, Evelyn had been known as "The Little Devil" for her fiery temper and fearless nature.

She vividly recalled the day she had seen him being cornered by three older boys. Without hesitation, she had charged in, fists flying, and sent them running. From that day forward, no one dared to lay a hand on him—not with Evelyn watching his back.

But those memories had faded with time. Unbeknownst to her, Alexander had clung to every moment of their past. Through years spent abroad, through every hardship, she had remained the brightest light in his otherwise shadowed world.

To him, she wasn’t just the moon—she was the sun, radiant and untouchable.

Evelyn tilted her head. "That night at the karaoke bar—when I was drunk—did you recognize me?"

A faint smile touched his lips. "Yes."

Her brows furrowed. "I was in danger that night. You didn’t just happen to save me, did you? You were following me the whole time?"

He nodded.

"But why?" she pressed. "If you knew who I was, why keep it a secret?"

"Because I was waiting," Alexander admitted, his voice roughened with emotion. "I stayed silent, hoping you’d remember me on your own."

A pang of guilt twisted in Evelyn’s chest. It felt like she had somehow failed him. "This place—did you choose it?"

"Yes," he said, his eyes softening. "I thought you might like it. It reminds me of Willow Creek Estate."

His gaze grew distant, as if lost in memory. "Do you remember? When we were kids, we used to play hide-and-seek in your garden. You always loved hiding in the fake mountains."

Back then, he had always known exactly where she was. But he’d pretend not to, spinning in exaggerated circles just to hear her stifled giggles. He had never minded letting her win—those small concessions were reserved for her alone.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Wow, you still remember that?"

She reached up self-consciously, tugging at her tangled wig. A flush crept up her neck.

Alexander merely smiled, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 273

Alexander Whitmore's lips curved into an elegant smile as he sipped his tea. He carried himself with the effortless grace of a modern aristocrat. The two of them exchanged pleasantries, catching up on years of separation.

Evelyn learned that Alexander had devoted himself to caring for his ailing mother in Serenia. Diagnosed with Alzheimer's, his mother's condition had gradually worsened, leaving her unable to care for herself. Despite numerous opportunities to return to Crestview, he had chosen to stay—both to tend to his mother and to cultivate his own career.

She recalled the intricate dynamics of the Whitmore family. There were four children in total—Alexander, his two elder brothers, and one older sister. The three eldest shared the same mother, while Alexander was the only child of the second wife, adding layers of complexity to their relationships.

Evelyn knew little about Mrs. Whitmore. Even though their families had been close during her childhood and she had visited the Whitmore estate, she had no distinct memory of the woman.

She tilted her head slightly. "What brought you back this year?"

"Home is where the heart is," Alexander murmured, lowering his gaze. His long fingers traced the rim of the delicate teacup. "After all, I am a Whitmore. It was time to reclaim what was rightfully mine."

Evelyn nodded in understanding.

Children born into privilege and power were often entangled in ruthless battles for control. Those who failed to navigate the treacherous waters were left with nothing—their birthright slipping through their fingers. Families like the Kingsleys, harmonious and loving, were rare exceptions.

Alexander suddenly leaned forward, his eyes alight with amusement. "We still have time before dinner. What would you like to do?"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard.

His lips curled into a knowing smile. "I could take you to see the roses at sunset." His voice softened, sincerity threading through his words. "I have a private garden, and today, it's open for exhibition. Let's enjoy them together."

Roses?

Her pulse quickened, a spark of delight igniting in her chest. Roses had always been her favorite. Back at Willow Creek Estate, she had once tended to a small rose garden herself—though in recent years, Lillian and the others had taken over its care.

"Absolutely," she agreed without hesitation. "Let's go."

As they made their way to Whitmore Gardens, Evelyn settled into the plush interior of Alexander's Bentley. Given their families' long-standing friendship, arriving separately would have been unnecessarily formal.

The Bentley glided smoothly along the road, with Theodore following closely behind, his grip tightening on the steering wheel.

Evelyn had just disentangled herself from Julian Montgomery. Now, Alexander Whitmore had appeared out of nowhere—and he carried an air of refinement that far surpassed Julian's flirtatious charm.

Before, Alexander had discreetly followed her home. This time, he had orchestrated a meeting by intercepting her blind date.

The man was undeniably cunning.

Theodore exhaled sharply, his gaze fixed on the Bentley ahead. After witnessing the pain Nathan Blackwood had inflicted on Evelyn, he had vowed never to let another man hurt her again. He would protect her—no matter what.

Inside the Bentley, the atmosphere was warm and relaxed.

Evelyn had shed her earlier disguise, opting for a natural look. Her long hair was loosely pinned up, a few tendrils framing her face. She had no need to maintain the polished image of a socialite here.

Alexander remained composed, though his gaze flickered toward her. Her flawless complexion, free of makeup, radiated effortless beauty.

He steadied himself before speaking softly. "Do you remember what you called me when we first met that night?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily puzzled. "I... don't recall."

A faint smile touched his lips. "You called me Critter."

She flushed, mortified.

Alexander chuckled. "My father used to scold me with that name. You overheard it once and decided to tease me with it."

"We were children," she muttered, cheeks burning. "I apologize for being so rude."

His eyes gleamed with amusement. "It's fine. You can still call me that now, if you'd like."

Evelyn groaned. "Oh, please. I'm not twelve anymore." She waved a hand dismissively. "Let's stick to Alexander. We're adults now—and you have a reputation to uphold."

He leaned slightly closer, his voice laced with warmth. "As you wish."
###Chapter 274

If Alexander Whitmore hadn't brought her here, Evelyn Carter would never have discovered the breathtaking rose garden on the southern outskirts of Crestview.

This wasn't part of the Whitmore family estate.

It was Alexander's private sanctuary—a hundred-acre field dedicated solely to the cultivation of Crimson Belle roses.

Beneath the fiery hues of the setting sun, the lush greenery and vibrant crimson blossoms shimmered like liquid rubies.

The sight of the fully bloomed garden captivated Evelyn, offering her a rare moment of peace.

Couples wandered leisurely, snapping photos, while influencers broadcasted the picturesque scenery to their followers.

For Evelyn, who had been drowning in work-related stress for weeks, this was a much-needed escape.

The striking couple drew envious glances from passersby.

They looked like a pair sculpted by destiny—flawless, radiant, and undeniably perfect together.

Evelyn bent down, her delicate fingers brushing against a velvety petal as if tracing a lover's lips.

She inhaled deeply, her nose crinkling in delight as the intoxicating fragrance enveloped her.

Alexander's gaze darkened, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

Evelyn.

A name as enchanting as the woman herself—more mesmerizing than any flower in this garden.

Evelyn laughed softly. "I know I'm stunning, but thank you for the compliment, Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander stepped closer, his voice laced with quiet intensity. "If I called you Evelyn like I used to, would you call me Alex again?"

Her lashes fluttered, her back still turned to him.

The weight of his lingering childhood affection made her uneasy.

To her, Alexander Whitmore was nearly a stranger now.

After a brief hesitation, she replied politely, "Perhaps—once we get to know each other better."

"I have no doubt we will." His voice was firm, resolute. "I'll wait for you."

The tension in the air thickened.

Eager to shift the conversation, Evelyn straightened, adopting a businesslike tone.

"Mr. Whitmore, what's the annual yield of this field? What are your cultivation costs? Do you have any exclusive corporate contracts?"

Alexander chuckled, adjusting his glasses. "Ms. Carter, are you proposing a partnership?"

"Honestly? Yes."

The moment she stepped into this garden, possibilities had ignited in her mind.

Since returning to Monarch Group, she had been itching to expand into the cosmetics industry—specifically, a rose-themed luxury skincare line.

But Harrison Kingsley had insisted she focus on strengthening Monarch Grand Hotels first, leaving her ambitions stifled.

Now, standing amidst this sea of blossoms, her determination flared anew.

"The Crimson Belle rose, or Rosa Damascena, has roots in ancient mythology," she explained, her eyes alight with passion.

"It symbolizes Aphrodite's beauty and Adonis's vitality—a timeless emblem of love and allure."

She gestured to the field. "Its essential oil is exceptionally rare, affecting both body and soul. Imported roses are costly, and very few estates cultivate them domestically."

Alexander watched her, his expression unreadable.

He barely registered her business pitch.

Over the years, countless investors had coveted his rose fields—yet he had never entertained their offers.

This garden, this dazzling spectacle, existed for one reason alone: Evelyn.

When he remained silent, she misinterpreted his hesitation.

She laughed lightly. "I know my proposal is sudden. And it's not a small venture. Take your time to consider—I'm in no rush."

Outside Whitmore Gardens, Theodore Winslow stood in the fading light, his thoughts tangled.

He observed the endless sea of roses, acutely aware of the deep ties between the Whitmores and the Kingsleys—especially between Alexander and Harrison.

He knows exactly what he's doing.

Evelyn had always kept men at arm's length.

She had cut off Julian Montgomery without hesitation.

Yet with Alexander, she seemed... different.

Less guarded.

More willing to engage.

Of course, the fact that he had saved her from that knife attack played a role.

But Theodore couldn't shake the feeling that Evelyn was allowing Alexander closer than anyone else.
###Chapter 275

Could this be love? The thought sent a sharp pang through Nathan's chest as he exhaled heavily, his fingers tightening around the railing.

Three sleek black sedans rolled up the winding driveway of Whitmore Gardens, their polished exteriors glinting under the afternoon sun.

Nathan's gaze darkened when he recognized the license plate of the lead car.

It belonged to the Blackwood family—specifically, Nathan's own vehicle.

The moment the car stopped, Oliver Sinclair, Nathan's ever-efficient secretary, stepped out and opened the rear door with practiced ease. Nathan emerged, adjusting the cuffs of his tailored suit with an air of effortless authority.

"Damn it," Nathan muttered under his breath, his jaw clenching at the sight of Victoria Sterling's smug expression as she exited the car beside him.

A delicate, pale hand reached out from the interior.

"Nathan, could you help me down?"

Nathan hesitated, his brow furrowing slightly before he reluctantly extended his hand.

Victoria seized it instantly, clinging to him as if afraid he might pull away. A triumphant smile curved her lips.

Even with Nathan's usual icy demeanor, she was certain she could win him back.

Watching them approach the estate entrance hand in hand, Theodore Winslow—Evelyn Carter's loyal secretary—rolled his eyes in disgust. He couldn't even muster the energy to curse them.

Today was just not his day.

"Nathan, I only came along to see the gardens. You don't mind, do I?" Victoria's voice trembled with feigned vulnerability, though her grip on Nathan's hand was anything but weak. "If it's too much trouble, I can leave. I don't want to be a burden."

Nathan hadn't come to Whitmore Gardens for leisure. The estate boasted the largest Crimson Belle rose fields in Crestview—perhaps even the entire province. He was here to assess the soil quality and rose cultivation for Blackwood Industries' upcoming luxury skincare line. Two renowned botanists accompanied him for a thorough evaluation.

If everything met his exacting standards, he intended to negotiate a partnership with the estate's owner to secure exclusive access to the roses.

Somehow, Victoria had caught wind of his plans and insisted on joining. Given her recent suicide attempt and fragile mental state, Nathan had little choice but to relent.

"It's fine," Nathan replied tersely, his voice low. "The doctor said fresh air would be good for you."

"Thank you," Victoria whispered, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she leaned against his shoulder.

Nathan stiffened, his entire body recoiling at the contact. Disgust twisted his features.

"Mr. Blackwood," Oliver murmured from behind him, "isn't that Ms. Carter's secretary?"

Nathan's head snapped up, his breath catching. An inexplicable surge of emotion tightened his chest, his pulse hammering violently.

Why was Theodore here? If Theodore was present, that meant Evelyn couldn't be far. What was she doing at Whitmore Gardens? Sightseeing?

Nathan gritted his teeth.

No. That wasn't her style.

She must be here to sabotage his deal.
###Chapter 276

The air crackled with unspoken hostility as the two groups locked eyes.

"Mr. Blackwood," Theodore Winslow said with a mocking smile, his tone dripping with thinly veiled disdain. "What an unfortunate coincidence."

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened. "Is Evelyn here?"

At the mention of Evelyn, Victoria Sterling felt a shiver crawl up her spine, her fingers tightening around her purse strap.

"Why?" Theodore scoffed. "Does Mr. Blackwood intend to claim this place as well?"

Oliver Sinclair bristled. "Damn it, he hasn’t done anything! We’re just asking a question. Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?"

"Nothing?" Theodore arched a brow, his voice laced with derision. "Spare me the lies."

"Enough, Oliver," Nathan cut in sharply. "Why is Evelyn here?"

Theodore’s gaze flickered toward Victoria before landing back on Nathan. "The same reason you are, I imagine."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. So, Evelyn had set her sights on Whitmore Gardens. But he wouldn’t let her win—not this time.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter had already stepped into the sea of crimson roses, the golden hues of sunset painting her in an ethereal glow. She moved with effortless grace, her fingers deftly inspecting the delicate petals and stems, jotting notes on her phone between snapping photos.

While others came to admire the scenery, Evelyn was here for business—her sharp eyes scanning for opportunity like a prospector hunting gold. Who would have guessed that beneath her breathtaking beauty lay the mind of a shrewd entrepreneur?

Alexander Whitmore watched her with quiet amusement, hands clasped behind his back. A fond smile tugged at his lips as he murmured, "Still the same relentless girl I remember."

His phone buzzed, breaking the moment. "What is it?" he answered tersely.

"Mr. Whitmore," his secretary said in a hushed tone. "Nathan Blackwood’s team has arrived. They’ve been pushing for a partnership regarding Whitmore Gardens, but as per your instructions, we haven’t given them a definitive answer."

Alexander’s gaze remained fixed on Evelyn. "They’re persistent, I’ll give them that."

"And… he’s brought his fiancée," the secretary added, unable to mask the disdain in his voice.

A shadow crossed Alexander’s face. This was the man Evelyn had once loved? The one she had sacrificed everything for? His grip tightened around his phone.

"Are the arrangements ready?" he asked coldly.

"Everything is prepared, sir."

"Good. Escort them here." Adjusting his glasses, Alexander allowed a faint smirk to curl his lips.

Evelyn straightened, brushing dirt from her hands as she rose from the flowerbed, oblivious to the storm brewing behind her.
###Chapter 277

Evelyn was the type who became completely absorbed in her work when she found something fascinating, losing all sense of time and space.

Suddenly remembering Alexander was still waiting, she turned abruptly to find him standing exactly where she'd left him, his patience unwavering.

A meticulously crafted flower basket now hung from his arm, filled with delicate blush-pink roses that caught the fading sunlight.

The sight made Evelyn recall an old saying: "Flowers don't argue, they just bloom."

"Ms. Carter," Alexander called as he approached, his voice warm like the evening breeze.

Seeing his immaculate attire, Evelyn waved urgently. "Wait! Don't come closer - it's all mud here!"

But Alexander paid no heed, striding purposefully through the thorny undergrowth until he stood before her. Evelyn bit her lip, cheeks flushing at his determination.

"Miss Evelyn, these are for you." Alexander's deep eyes reflected the golden sunset as he offered the basket.

She gave a polite smile but shook her head. "Mr. Whitmore, while I appreciate the gesture, I can't accept these."

Though just flowers, roses carried certain implications. Accepting them would be... complicated.

Alexander anticipated her refusal. "Consider them research specimens," he suggested smoothly. "I noticed your fascination with these Damask roses. The soil beneath is from this very garden - perfect for transplanting to your conservatory. They'll bloom year-round with proper care."

Trapped by his logical explanation, Evelyn hesitated before finally accepting. "Thank you, Mr. Whitmore. For both the gift and the opportunity to study them."

Suddenly, Alexander leaned closer, his chiseled features filling Evelyn's vision. She caught her breath, lashes fluttering like startled butterflies.

"Is something wrong?" she asked, instinctively touching her face. "Do I have dirt..."

He nodded solemnly. "Right there."

Her self-conscious wiping only smeared another streak of mud across her cheek. Now she truly looked a mess.

With infinite patience, Alexander produced a snow-white handkerchief and gently dabbed at her face before she could protest.

"I can-" Evelyn began, but he'd already finished.

"All clean," he murmured, withdrawing just as she started feeling uncomfortable with their proximity. That was Alexander - always knowing exactly when to step back.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn wondered if his actions held deeper meaning, but quickly dismissed the thought. His kindness likely stemmed from their childhood friendship and his inherently gentle nature.

The sound of approaching footsteps shattered the moment.

Evelyn looked up and froze.

Nathan stood mere paces away, his imposing frame casting a long shadow. His expression revealed nothing, but his eyes burned with an eerie crimson glow.

The calm before the storm.

He'd witnessed everything - Evelyn accepting the roses, her radiant smile, Alexander's tender ministrations. Their easy intimacy played like a haunting melody in Nathan's mind.

His fists clenched until his knuckles turned white beneath his tailored sleeves. Every muscle in his body tensed as a deafening roar filled his skull.

He'd thought she came for the Westridge project. He would have gladly surrendered it all to her. But this? Watching her bestow upon another man what was once his?

This agony was beyond anything he'd imagined.
###Chapter 278

A tempest of emotions raged behind Nathan Blackwood's stormy expression.

Evelyn Carter, however, harbored no such complicated thoughts.

In her mind, she was cursing her rotten luck.

Running into this bastard in such a picturesque place is like finding a cockroach in my champagne.

As for Victoria Sterling, who clung to Nathan's arm like ivy, she was nothing more than an irritating spectacle.

Evelyn's eyes burned just looking at her.

Then, Alexander Whitmore's towering frame leaned closer.

His lips grazed her ear as he murmured in a low, velvety voice, "Don't worry. I've got you."

Evelyn's pulse stuttered, but she scoffed internally.

What's the big deal? If they act like rabid dogs, we'll put them down like rabid dogs.

"Ms. Kingsley, what a surprise to see you here," Victoria cooed, her saccharine tone dripping with false sweetness.

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Is this gentleman your new beau? You two make such a striking pair."

Evelyn remained impassive, her expression unreadable.

Alexander, however, smirked. "Flattering, but no. I'm not Evelyn's lover—yet."

Evelyn barely reacted, but Nathan's knuckles whitened as his fist clenched.

Not yet?

The implication sent a bolt of fury through him.

Is this bastard taunting me? Or has she really moved on so quickly?

Victoria felt Nathan's arm tense beneath her grip.

She smirked inwardly.

Good. At least one of them has truly let go of their failed marriage.

Her gaze flickered to Alexander, assessing.

Who is this man? He’s not just handsome—he carries himself like royalty.

Breaking the silence, Alexander arched a brow. "Mr. Blackwood, here to admire the roses with your fiancée?"

His lips curled. "You'd better hurry. Whitmore Gardens closes soon."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I don’t have time for this."

He shot Alexander a venomous glare before turning to his secretary. "Oliver, contact Whitmore Gardens immediately. We need to finalize the collaboration details."

Oliver Sinclair nodded briskly, pulling out his phone.

Within seconds, a loud ringtone pierced the air—coming from nearby.

Oliver frowned. "Strange. It sounds like they're right here."

The ringing grew louder as a man in a tailored suit sprinted toward them.

"Mr. Whitmore, your phone," the man announced, handing the device to Alexander.

He didn’t miss the chance to shoot Nathan’s team a disdainful glance.

Without hesitation, Alexander ended the call with a graceful flick of his fingers.

Simultaneously, the ringing on Oliver’s phone ceased.

Oliver stood frozen, mouth slightly agape.

Nathan’s face drained of color.

A slow, triumphant smile spread across Alexander’s lips.

"The owner of Whitmore Gardens you're trying to reach, Mr. Blackwood, is me."

His gaze slid to Evelyn. "And I’ve already accepted Ms. Kingsley’s proposal for an exclusive partnership."

Evelyn’s eyes widened as Alexander extended his hand.

"To a successful collaboration," he murmured.

She glanced at Nathan, whose expression darkened with barely restrained fury.

Seeing him so thoroughly defeated sent a thrill through her.

But winning without a fight?

Too easy.

A mischievous smile curved her lips, dimples flashing.

She grasped Alexander’s hand firmly.

"Looking forward to it, Mr. Whitmore."
###Chapter 279

The members of the Blackwood team exchanged stunned glances. Oliver Sinclair suddenly felt his vision blur, as if struck by lightning from above.

Seeing Nathan's stormy expression, Victoria Sterling - thinking she was being helpful - quickly interjected, "Nathan, there's no need to worry. It's just a garden. There are plenty of estates like Whitmore Gardens in the country. We can contact other—"

Before she could finish, Nathan abruptly pulled his arm from her grasp with such force that she stumbled backward, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

"Let's go, Mr. Whitmore," Evelyn said without sparing them another glance, offering Alexander a polite smile instead.

Alexander responded warmly, "Of course. I've reserved us a private dining room at Le Jardin. We can leave whenever you're ready."

Their shared smile made Nathan feel like invisible hands were tightening around his throat, his brows knitting together in frustration.

He swiftly stepped between them, blocking Alexander's path. "Mr. Whitmore, we need to speak privately," he demanded, his voice firm despite the failed business negotiations.

"If this is about the Whitmore Gardens project, I believe we've exhausted all discussion, Mr. Blackwood," Alexander replied dismissively.

"What if it's about something else?" Nathan countered, his dark gaze locking onto Evelyn's face with unsettling intensity.

Alexander led Nathan to an ornate gazebo nestled among the rose bushes. Though surrounded by vibrant blooms, the air between them turned frigid as they sat across from each other.

Glancing at his watch impatiently, Alexander said, "Let's be brief, Mr. Blackwood. I have dinner plans with Ms. Carter that I'd hate to delay."

"Dinner plans? I thought this was strictly business," Nathan retorted, unwilling to concede any ground when it came to Evelyn. "Don't presume too much. Evelyn was my wife for three years. I know her far better than you ever could."

Alexander chuckled darkly, adjusting his glasses. "Three years of a marriage in name only hardly qualifies you as an expert on Evelyn's heart. Tell me, Mr. Blackwood, where does this confidence come from?"

"You've been investigating me?" Nathan's fists clenched, his eyes turning glacial.

"Everything I do is for Evelyn's benefit," Alexander countered smoothly. "Our current collaboration was never about taking her from you. She's the woman I've been waiting for, and I won't allow anyone - especially you - to interfere."

He continued mercilessly, "I'm aware your assistant contacted my associates. Let me be clear: Whitmore Enterprises never had any intention of partnering with Blackwood Industries."

The way Alexander said "Evelyn" with such tenderness made Nathan's jaw tighten.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his gaze burning like embers in the night. "Don't think your reputation in Serenia is unknown to me, Whitmore. Evelyn might be taken in by your charming facade, but I see through it. I know exactly what kind of man you are."

In Serenia's high society, Alexander Whitmore was indeed legendary - a beautiful but notorious figure who concealed his true nature beneath impeccable manners. Yet before Evelyn, he transformed into the picture of gentle devotion, revealing the depth of his cunning.

Though divorced, seeing Evelyn grow closer to Alexander filled Nathan with a volatile mix of rage, jealousy, and dread.

Alexander merely smirked, making no attempt to deny Nathan's accusations. "You've never been one to lack female companionship. But Evelyn isn't some plaything to be discarded after a few bouquets and sweet words," Nathan growled, his handsome features hardening into icy severity.

"How curious," Alexander mused after a pause. "If you care so deeply about Evelyn, why did you divorce her and remarry in the first place?"

The question struck like a dagger, leaving Nathan momentarily speechless as waves of regret crashed through him.

"I'm fully aware of my flaws," Alexander continued coldly. "But my feelings for Evelyn remain pure and constant. You, however, married her while pining for another, breaking her heart in the process. Anyone else might have the right to judge me - but not you."

His voice turned glacial as he added, "Whether you regret it now is irrelevant. Your divorce is final. Whoever Evelyn chooses to love is none of your concern."

Rising abruptly, Alexander strode toward the exit before pausing to glance back at Nathan's frozen form. "My feelings for her predate your marriage. In my eyes, those three years mean nothing."

Left alone in the gazebo, Nathan sat motionless as Alexander's words echoed in his mind, his face ashen, his broad shoulders trembling almost imperceptibly.
###Chapter 280

The last of the guests had departed from Whitmore Gardens, leaving only Evelyn Carter and Victoria Sterling amidst the sprawling rose bushes.

Twilight painted the sky in hues of lavender and gold, yet Evelyn's flawless complexion seemed to glow with an ethereal radiance, like moonlight given human form. The sight ignited a familiar, bitter envy in Victoria's chest.

No matter how much she despised Evelyn, she couldn't deny the woman's breathtaking beauty—a diamond among mere glass. What woman wouldn't seethe knowing such perfection had lived under the same roof as Nathan Blackwood for three years, even if their marriage had been a farce?

Victoria tossed her sleek chestnut hair over one shoulder, shedding the demure facade she wore for Nathan. A smug smirk curled her lips as she sauntered toward Evelyn, the self-assured gait of a victor.

"Found yourself a new benefactor already?" Victoria's voice dripped with false sweetness. "How efficient. Though really, you should've done this sooner. No amount of scheming will make Nathan spare you another glance."

Evelyn arched a brow, regarding her like one would a particularly tiresome insect. "Why would I want his attention? I'm not some circus attraction desperate for an audience."

Victoria's smile faltered. Bitch. Time to play her ace.

"Since we're chatting," she purred, "I might as well share my good news. Nathan and I are getting engaged. The ceremony will coincide with my birthday gala."

"How lovely." Evelyn's tone was as flat as stale champagne. "Don't expect a gift from me."

The blatant indifference stung. Victoria's nails bit into her palms. "Still putting on airs? I know you're seething inside. But what can you do? I won Nathan, while you're just Crestview's discarded trash!"

Evelyn sighed theatrically. "Victoria, every conversation with you revolves around Nathan. Is your existence truly that vapid? Beyond clinging to a divorced man, do you have any accomplishments worth mentioning?"

Victoria's face flushed crimson. "How dare—"

"Let me guess," Evelyn continued, stepping closer with feline grace. "You think flaunting this engagement proves you've climbed the social ladder? How pedestrian. The 'treasure' you're so proud of is refuse I wouldn't touch again."

"Refuse?!" Victoria shrieked.

Her complexion mottled with rage. "You're just jealous! These insults prove how much you care! Three wasted years, and Nathan still cast you out like yesterday's news!"

Evelyn's gaze turned arctic. The sudden chill made Victoria's bravado waver.

"Let me enlighten you," Evelyn said softly, advancing until mere inches separated them. "My patience isn't permission for your delusions. Push me again, Adrienne, and your fairytale ending might become a nightmare."

The name struck like lightning. Victoria—no, Adrienne—recoiled as if scalded. Blood drained from her face, leaving her ghastly pale.

"W-what?" Her voice cracked. "I don't know any Adrienne!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a razor-thin smile. "How odd. Isn't that what they called you during your... adventurous years in Silvercrest? Most people don't look like they've seen a ghost when hearing their own name."

Victoria's breath came in shallow gasps. The Adrienne persona—a gold-digging party girl who'd slept her way through elite circles—was the antithesis of the pure, devoted image she'd crafted for Nathan.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying Victoria's panic with detached amusement. "What's wrong? You look ill."

"I—I need to go." Victoria stumbled backward, heels catching on gravel.

But Evelyn closed the distance, trapping her against a marble fountain. One manicured finger tapped Victoria's collarbone. "Run all you want," she murmured. "But remember—I know everything. And unlike you, I don't make empty threats."

The setting sun painted Evelyn in fiery light, her shadow stretching long across the garden path. For the first time, Victoria understood why Nathan had once called his ex-wife the most dangerous woman in Crestview.

And she'd just made herself prey.
###Chapter 281

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smile. "You can change your appearance or identity, but your past remains unchanged." Her voice carried an icy edge. "No secret stays buried forever. There are matters I choose not to expose—not out of kindness, but because they don't concern me."

She leaned closer, her whisper cutting like glass. "But cross me again, and I'll unravel every deception you've woven."

Victoria's breath hitched. A violent tremor ran through her body as realization struck—Evelyn knew everything. The weight of that knowledge left her paralyzed with dread.

When Nathan finally emerged from Whitmore Gardens, Evelyn and Alexander had already departed. His conversation with Alexander left him reeling, lost in thought until the evening chill reminded him of the passing hours.

Nathan arranged for Victoria's return to Kingsley Medical Center before heading to Cliffside Manor with Oliver. The young secretary's distress was palpable throughout the journey.

Oliver's nervous sweat soaked through his tailored suit. "Mr. Blackwood, I—I deserve punishment for this failure!" His voice cracked with emotion. "Had I known we were dealing with a Whitmore... This is entirely my fault."

Nathan exhaled sharply, eyes closed. "Stop this melodrama. It's merely a business setback."

"But sir, this isn't insignificant—"

"Alexander Whitmore hasn't been active domestically for years," Nathan interrupted. "Even with thorough research, the outcome would remain unchanged. Contact other rose suppliers—the country has several comparable gardens."

"Yes, I'll begin arrangements tomorrow." Oliver wiped his brow. "Mr. Whitmore's generosity toward Ms. Carter is... unusual. Most businessmen would negotiate extensively for such a major project."

The observation struck Nathan like a physical blow. His voice turned gravelly. "Oliver, tell me truthfully—did I treat Evelyn poorly before? Was I truly that... cruel?"

Oliver froze. The question hung between them like a guillotine. Though honest by nature, he recognized the professional minefield before him. His throat tightened with unspoken words.

"Speak freely," Nathan commanded, his gaze piercing. "I require honesty, not flattery."

Oliver swallowed hard. "If... if Ms. Carter viewed your marriage as purely transactional—benefiting financially for three years before leaving—then no, you weren't unjust."

He hesitated before continuing, "But if she genuinely loved you? Enduring your indifference and the Blackwood family's mistreatment without complaint? That changes everything. To a woman who gave her heart completely, financial compensation would feel like... salt in the wound."

Nathan's breath caught. The words landed with devastating impact, stirring emotions he'd long suppressed. Memories surfaced—Evelyn's quiet devotion, her unflagging care despite his coldness.

The realization hit him like a tidal wave. His hands trembled slightly as he whispered, "She loved me."

In that moment, Nathan Blackwood looked utterly shattered.
###Chapter 282

Alexander Whitmore had arranged an exquisite Omakase experience for Evelyn, knowing her fondness for unexpected delights. The bluefin tuna, flown in fresh that morning, melted like butter on her tongue.

Each tempura piece was a masterpiece - golden crisp outside, succulent within. The sashimi glistened with oceanic freshness, its texture like silk against her palate.

Evelyn found herself enchanted by every meticulously crafted dish. The fine wine flowed freely, loosening her usual reserve around Alexander.

To her surprise, Alexander proved a renaissance man. Their conversation danced from Proust to Prokofiev, from classic literature to contemporary gaming culture. There wasn't a subject the Whitmore heir couldn't discuss with surprising depth.

The real revelation came when they discovered their shared passion for an obscure MMORPG. Both favored the high-risk berserker class. Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink with excitement as she animatedly described her favorite combat strategies, hands sketching elaborate maneuvers in the air.

Alexander watched her with amused indulgence, letting her dominate the conversation. When they finally left the restaurant, their talk had remained refreshingly casual - no business proposals, no awkward negotiations.

As their chauffeurs pulled up, Alexander anticipated her unspoken question. "Evelyn," he said smoothly, "whenever you're ready with the Monarch Grand proposal, send it over. We'll review and proceed directly to signing."

Evelyn hesitated. "Alexander... choosing me over Nathan today - was this about giving him consequences?"

His expression remained unreadable, that faint smile playing on his lips.

"The business world isn't personal," she continued gently. "You should prioritize your interests. While Nathan and I have... history, I won't leverage our friendship unfairly. Review both proposals objectively."

Driving away from Whitmore Gardens, Evelyn wrestled with unease. Part of her wanted to relish Nathan's setback, but another part rebelled against advancing through a man's favor - even Alexander's.

She'd built her independence precisely to avoid such dependencies.

Alexander studied her thoughtfully. "You're right, of course," he conceded. Then added with quiet conviction, "But even if Nathan presents the superior proposal, I'd still choose you."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily speechless. Had he heard anything she'd just said?

His smile deepened. "I understand your principles, Evelyn. But my approach values established relationships. Nathan's a stranger; you're..." He paused meaningfully, "...someone I've known forever."

The warmth in his voice sent an unexpected flutter through her. She looked away, suddenly self-conscious.

"I appreciate your confidence," she managed. "Though with recent hotel developments, my proposal may take longer than expected."

Alexander opened her car door. "Take all the time you need." As she settled in, he lingered at the window. "Aren't you curious what Nathan wanted to discuss earlier?"

Evelyn laughed, the sound bright with genuine amusement. "Not remotely. That chapter is closed." With a final wave, she departed, leaving Alexander watching her taillights disappear into the night.
###Chapter 283

The sleek Bugatti disappeared into the velvet night. Alexander Whitmore adjusted his sunglasses, a slow smirk spreading across his lips as exhilaration pulsed through his veins.

Owned by Monarch Group.

The powerful engine roared as the car sliced through the empty streets, its headlights cutting through the darkness.

Alexander rolled down the window, letting the crisp night air rush in. His gaze drifted to the glittering skyline across Starlight River, lost in contemplation.

Theodore Winslow's grip tightened on the steering wheel. His voice was tight with disapproval. "Ms. Carter, you seem awfully familiar with Mr. Whitmore already."

Evelyn Carter shrugged lightly. "We clicked. He's interesting."

Theodore's jaw clenched. "Just because he saved you doesn't mean he wasn't following you to the gala. You should be careful."

Evelyn chuckled. "Maybe he recognized me and got curious. After talking to him, I don't think he's dangerous—just eccentric. Probably the Serenian influence."

Her eyes sparkled. "And we both love the same game! We even made plans to play together soon."

Theodore's frown deepened. After a tense silence, he finally murmured, "Ms. Carter, you've never been this... accommodating with a man you just met. Do you... like him?"

Evelyn shot him an incredulous look. "Where did that come from?"

She rolled her eyes dramatically. "If anything, Alexander's the one who seems interested. But honestly, men are distractions. I have fortunes to make—no time for romance!"

Theodore exhaled in relief, his shoulders relaxing. Good. At least Mr. Whitmore hasn't swayed her.

Just then, the car jolted slightly over a speed bump. A small card slipped from the bouquet in Evelyn's lap.

"Hmm?" She picked it up, unfolding the elegant stationery.

In flowing script, Alexander had written: "Youth's fleeting—don't waste a single moment of it."

Evelyn's lips curved. This man is... intriguing.

Theodore broke the silence. "You saw Victoria Sterling again today. Did she say anything?" His voice darkened at the mention of the venomous woman.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What do you think? Can a snake ever stop being poisonous?"

"Ms. Carter, she's already tried to harm you once. She'd sacrifice anyone to climb higher." Theodore hesitated. "How do you plan to handle this?"

Evelyn's fingers traced the rose petals absently. "Actually, I need you to take care of something else for the next few days."

"Your orders, Ms. Carter?"

"Keep watch on Margaret Sterling—Victoria's mother." Her voice turned icy. "After tonight, Victoria won't be able to restrain herself. She'll make her move soon."

Theodore frowned. "Did you provoke her?"

"I may have... hinted at her past in Silvercrest." Evelyn smirked, recalling Victoria's horrified expression.

"Isn't that tipping her off?"

Evelyn shook her head, eyes gleaming. "Not a warning—a lure. I want her to panic. The closer she gets to marrying Nathan Blackwood, the more desperate she becomes. She'll eliminate any threat—including that hidden child."

Theodore's eyes widened. "So she'll send her mother to relocate the girl!"

Evelyn nodded. "Victoria's stuck in the hospital. Her mother is the only one who knows the child's location. The bait's set. Now we wait for the trap to spring."
###Chapter 284

Evelyn Carter rushed back to Kingsley Medical Center, her pulse racing with terror. Sebastian's ominous warning reverberated through her mind like a death knell. Her manicured nails found their way between her teeth as she paced the sterile hospital room.

The situation was dire. She couldn't allow Evelyn Carter, a Kingsley, to uncover her buried secrets from Silvercrest. That woman possessed the cunning of a fox and the persistence of a bloodhound. Victoria Sterling knew she had to act before the truth surfaced.

With trembling fingers, she dialed Dominic Reeves. The phone rang endlessly before his groggy voice answered. "Do you know what time it is?" he grumbled.

"Dominic, she's investigating me!" Victoria's voice cracked with desperation. "She might expose everything. You need to leave Crestview immediately!"

A dark chuckle came through the receiver. "Trying to ditch me now? Not until I get my payment."

Fury ignited in Victoria's chest. "If Evelyn finds out about us, my engagement to Nathan is finished! You'll get nothing then. Forget about the ten million!"

Silence stretched between them before Dominic finally relented. "Fine. But if you're lying..."

"I swear you'll get every cent!" Victoria interrupted. "For safety, we shouldn't contact each other until this blows over."

The call ended, but her hands wouldn't stop shaking. After several deep breaths, she dialed another number. "Mother? Come to the hospital immediately. It's urgent!"

Meanwhile, in the dimly lit basement, Evelyn examined Dominic's phone with satisfaction. The man himself sat bound to a chair, his face gaunt from days of minimal rations. Gone were the days of hanging upside down - a small mercy that had nearly brought him to tears.

Theodore Winslow accepted the phone from Evelyn, his lips curling in approval. "Impressive performance," he remarked.

Dominic paled. "Anything for you, Ms. Kingsley," he stammered, his eyes darting to his bandaged wrists where two tendons used to be.

Evelyn crossed her legs elegantly, her emerald eyes glinting. "Victoria's birthday approaches." Her voice turned icy. "Play your part well, and I'll ensure you get prison instead of a coffin. Fail me..." She let the threat hang in the air.

Beads of sweat dotted Dominic's forehead. "Y-yes, Ms. Kingsley!"

Noticing his emaciated state, Evelyn gestured to Theodore. "Bring him proper food."

Soon, a feast appeared - golden roasted chicken, warm bread, even a cold beer. Dominic's eyes watered at the sight, his stomach growling audibly after days of stale crusts.

Theodore placed the tray before him with disdain. "Eat. Courtesy of Ms. Kingsley."

Trembling hands reached for the food. "Is this... my last meal?" Dominic whispered between bites.

As they ascended from the dungeon, Theodore frowned. "Why feed that vermin?"

Evelyn stretched gracefully. "Every pawn has its purpose, Theodore. To dismantle Victoria's empire, I need Dominic's cooperation." Her lips curved into a predator's smile. "And a well-fed pawn performs better."
###Chapter 285

Evelyn stretched lazily, stifling a yawn. "Dominic must despise both me and Victoria after being imprisoned," she mused aloud.

Her lips curled into a knowing smile. "But if I show him kindness when he's at his lowest, he'll be so grateful that his hatred will shift entirely to Victoria." She tapped her fingers lightly against the armrest. "Then, he'll focus all his energy on destroying her."

Theodore chuckled, admiration gleaming in his eyes. "Ms. Evelyn, your brilliance never ceases to amaze me." He leaned forward eagerly. "I can't wait to witness their battle."

A week later.

Evelyn finished her meticulous inspection of the restaurant and strode back to her office, satisfaction humming through her veins. Nearly six months had passed since she took over Monarch Grand Hotels, and under her leadership, profits had soared.

The recent evaluation had not only secured their prestigious star rating but also earned them the coveted title of Most Popular Hotel of the Year.

Yet Evelyn wasn’t content. Her gaze was fixed on the ultimate prize—Best Hotel of the Year, an honor the Blackwood family had monopolized for five consecutive years. With her at the helm, the Kingsleys finally had a real chance to seize the spotlight.

Breaking from her usual discreet demeanor, Evelyn surprised Theodore by granting interviews to three major media outlets. She had a purpose—remaining in the shadows wouldn’t earn her the respect she needed to become Monarch Group’s CEO.

Wyatt had handed her the hotel as a test, a stepping stone. She intended to prove she was more than capable.

Another victory secured, Evelyn reached for her coffee, only to remember Theodore had left to handle urgent business. Rosalind’s birthday banquet was in two days, and he still hadn’t returned.

Evelyn closed her eyes, fingers drumming rhythmically against the desk. Her strategy was flawless. She could afford to wait.

Then, her phone buzzed. The screen displayed the name of her beloved protégé—Rosalind Walker.

She answered with a smile. "Rosalind, what delightful surprise do you have for me today?"

"Master!" Rosalind’s voice was honey-sweet. "I’ve baked pastries and brewed the finest tea. Won’t you visit my atelier for a treat?"

Evelyn saw right through her. "You want me to review your new Rosalind Couture collection again, don’t you?"

Rosalind laughed, feigning offense. "Master, must you expose me so mercilessly?"

Evelyn’s tone softened with pride. "Your talent speaks for itself. You’ve inspired countless designers and carved your name into fashion history. Trust your instincts—my interference would only dilute your vision."

"Thank you, Master. Without you, none of this would be possible." Rosalind’s humility remained unchanged. To her, Evelyn was still the guiding star she revered.

A pause. Then, hesitantly, Rosalind added, "Master… there’s something else. That witch Victoria came by again, demanding clothes." Her voice dripped with disdain. "She fixated on that silver off-shoulder gown in the design room—last season’s design, no less! The fit is atrocious on her, but she insisted on taking it anyway."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Did you let her?"

Rosalind sighed. "That’s why I’m apologizing, Master."

Evelyn chuckled. "No need. Like me, you act with purpose. I trust your judgment."

A cold laugh escaped Rosalind. "I made it clear—each piece is priceless. If she dares alter even a stitch, she’ll pay five times its worth."

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed with amusement. "Won’t that ill-fitting dress cause problems?"

Rosalind shrugged. "If it does, that’s her humiliation to bear. Don’t you agree, Master?"
###Chapter 286

Victoria Sterling poured every ounce of her being into preparing for her birthday gala.

She radiated energy, a far cry from the frail patient she'd pretended to be. Days were spent meticulously selecting venues, curating outfits, and perfecting her makeup. An outsider might mistake these preparations for wedding arrangements.

Noticing her improved condition, Nathan Blackwood ceased his hospital visits. Though resentment simmered beneath her composed exterior, Victoria focused solely on the upcoming celebration.

On the eve of the grand event, Victoria stood in her chambers wrestling with the couture gown borrowed from Rosalind Walker.

Her willow-like frame couldn't fill the dress's generous bustline. Two maids worked frantically, their efforts proving futile against the ill-fitting garment.

"Useless!" Victoria shoved them aside, her cheeks flaming with frustration. "How did the Sterlings end up with such incompetent staff?"

One trembling maid suggested, "Miss Victoria, perhaps we could call a seamstress for alterations? Or use discreet pins?"

Victoria's irritation mounted, though she'd never admit her true concern was financial. The seven-figure gown came with strict contractual terms - any damage or unauthorized alteration, even a single pin prick, would cost her five times its value. Beyond the financial blow, she refused to give that woman Rosalind Walker the satisfaction.

"Fetch me double-sided tape! Immediately!" Victoria commanded.

Within moments, the maids returned with the tape, expertly securing the excess fabric. When Victoria tried the dress again, it held perfectly.

"Brilliant solution, Miss Victoria!" the maids chorused.

Victoria exhaled in relief, a triumphant gleam in her eyes.

A sharp knock interrupted the moment. Margaret Sterling entered, tension lining her features.

"Mother!" Victoria adjusted her dress anxiously before dismissing the maids with a sharp gesture.

Margaret secured the door behind them. "It's done," she said, her grip icy as she clasped her daughter's hand.

Victoria squeezed back, her expression darkening with gratitude. "You've sacrificed so much for me, Mother. I'll never forget this. I'll ensure you're properly cared for when I'm Mrs. Blackwood."

Margaret paled, locking eyes with her daughter. "Nonsense. You're my flesh and blood. With your reconciliation to Nathan and Leonard's support, we're on the brink of victory. Nothing will stop you from joining the Blackwood dynasty."

The following evening, as twilight painted the sky, the Sterling family spared no expense hosting Victoria's birthday gala in the grandest ballroom of the Blackwood Hotel. This venue choice underscored the families' alliance, signaling unity beyond mere social connections.

Penelope Whitmore, representing Leonard, had secured attendance from Crestview's elite and national dignitaries. The event's opulence rivaled a royal wedding.

Melodious music filled the lavish space as elegantly dressed guests mingled. Crestview's power players attended not just for the birthday, but to honor Leonard Blackwood.

Though Penelope had recently faced prosecutor scrutiny, the investigation revealed her cousin's financial misdeeds. Now revitalized, she moved through the crowd arm-in-arm with her husband, resplendent in designer attire, engaging effortlessly with guests.

"Congratulations are in order," a guest toasted the couple.

Penelope beamed. "The honor belongs to my dear niece today."

"Miss Sterling is Nathan's fiancée, soon to be Blackwood Industries' first lady," another guest observed. "This celebration belongs to you both."

Laughter rippled through the group as more well-wishers added their congratulations.
###Chapter 287

The grand ballroom buzzed with excitement as Cassandra Blackwood mingled among the glittering crowd.

"Congratulations, Cassandra! You'll soon gain another sister-in-law," Amelia Thornton teased with a mischievous grin.

Beatrice Whitmore chimed in, "Correction - it should be another sister-in-law. Though I suppose the newest addition always shines brightest, doesn't it? Especially when she's both Mrs. Blackwood's niece and your brother's fiancée. Such perfect harmony!"

Cassandra forced a smile, her manicured nails digging into her champagne flute. Perfect harmony? More like a perfect disaster.

"Rumor has it Victoria Sterling and Nathan were childhood sweethearts," Amelia continued. "After overcoming so many obstacles, their love story is finally getting its happy ending. He divorced his ex-wife and immediately proposed to Victoria. Now that's true devotion."

Beatrice nudged Cassandra playfully. "When will your brother stop breaking hearts? More importantly, when will we celebrate your engagement? We're all waiting to see who captures the Blackwood princess's heart."

Cassandra's gaze instinctively swept across the room, searching for Julian Montgomery - the most eligible bachelor in Crestview.

Meanwhile, in the penthouse suite, Julian and Nathan stood by floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city's sparkling skyline.

Julian looked dashing in his ivory suit with an onyx shirt, his signature golden rose pendant glinting against his choker. The ensemble accentuated his aristocratic features perfectly.

Nathan wore his customary all-black attire - tailored suit, crisp shirt, and silk tie. The only adornment was his platinum dragon cufflinks, symbols of his uncompromising authority.

"My God," Julian exhaled dramatically.

He couldn't resist teasing his brooding companion. "If I didn't know better, I'd think you were attending a funeral rather than an engagement party."

Nathan's expression remained glacial. "Black is traditional for funerals. Does wearing white change the occasion?"

Julian chuckled. "The universe clearly balanced your stunning looks with that dreadful personality!"

His attention shifted to Nathan's cufflinks. "Those are rather distinctive. Mind if I borrow them sometime?"

"Absolutely not," Nathan replied without hesitation.

Julian sighed dramatically. "We used to share everything - even underwear! Now you won't lend me simple cufflinks. Getting stingy in your old age?"

Oliver Sinclair entered briskly. "Excuse me, sir. Ms. Sterling sent me to remind you about your joint speech for the engagement toast. She's waiting downstairs."

Nathan's response was icy. "I'm not going."

Oliver barely concealed his satisfaction. "Very well, I'll inform her immediately." Nothing pleased him more than seeing his boss put the demanding Victoria in her place.

Julian raised an eyebrow. "After her recent... emotional episode and that suicide attempt, you're provoking her again? What if she decides to make another dramatic scene?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "I can't appear on stage with her tonight."

Julian blinked in surprise. "Why ever not? Isn't she your fiancée?"

"I've decided to end our relationship," Nathan stated calmly.

Julian's jaw dropped while Oliver nearly choked on his own breath.

Nathan continued quietly, "I haven't told her yet. She needs time to stabilize first." His voice softened slightly. "She did save my life once. I owe her that much consideration."

Julian's eyes sparkled with sudden understanding. Leaning closer, he whispered, "Nathan, tell me honestly - are you breaking things off because of Evelyn?"

Nathan's breath hitched, a sharp pain lancing through his chest at the mention of her name.
###Chapter 288

At the Blackwood Hotel, Victoria Sterling basked in the blinding spotlight of her moment.

Meanwhile...

Evelyn Carter drove her sapphire-blue Bugatti along the winding coastal road of Moonlight Cove.

The ocean breeze played with her chestnut locks as she hummed along to a cheerful melody blasting through the speakers.

Her phone lit up with an incoming call from Dominic.

"Hello, Dom!" she answered in that honeyed tone only reserved for her brothers.

"Good heavens, that voice!" Dominic teased. "Should I record this for Nathan? Might finally crack that icy exterior of his."

Evelyn chuckled before turning serious. "Does this mean everything's arranged?"

"All set," Dominic confirmed proudly. "Sebastian's team is ready too. Your brothers have everything under control."

She turned onto the private road leading to Reginald's estate. "I'm visiting Grandpa Reginald now. He's the only Blackwood who refused to attend Victoria's gala."

A pang of sadness struck her. The old man who loved company was sitting alone by choice.

Memories flooded back - their poetry sessions, antique appraisals, beach walks. Last Valentine's Day during Crestview's worst snowstorm, she'd braved the weather with homemade pastries.

"Evelyn!" Reginald had exclaimed that day. "Shouldn't you be with Nathan? What brings you to this old fool's doorstep?"

Back then, she'd made excuses for Nathan's absence. "He's buried in work at Blackwood Industries. But he sent flowers - it's the thought that counts."

Reginald had shaken his head. "Child, you're too forgiving. That boy needs a firmer hand. Like your grandmother - she'd either scold me senseless or pinch my thigh until I behaved."

They'd watched the snowfall until Reginald suddenly asked, "Are you afraid of the cold? Never mind - let's visit Grandma. Need to clear her path - she always hated the chill."

Now arriving at the estate, Evelyn called out, "Grandpa! I'm home!"

"Annie!" Eleanor's sweet voice answered as she wheeled Reginald into view.

"Ellie!" Evelyn rushed to embrace Nathan's half-sister.

Eleanor's hands traced Evelyn's back. "You've gotten so thin! Haven't you been eating?"

"I'm fine," Evelyn lied, having skipped too many meals lately.

"My dear," Reginald beckoned. "Let me look at you."

Evelyn knelt by his wheelchair. "Grandpa, you look pale. Haven't you been resting well?"
###Chapter 289

"It's just an old condition flaring up again. Nothing to worry about." Reginald Blackwood reassured Evelyn as he gently stroked her hair. His complexion was unnaturally pale, tinged with a sickly gray.

Evelyn held his left hand, carefully checking his pulse. A heavy weight settled in her chest.

After a long moment, she spoke firmly. "Grandfather, I'll dedicate time every week to give you acupuncture treatments. I'll also prepare a new set of medicines for you. You must follow the regimen—and Marcus will supervise your medication."

Reginald sighed softly. "My dear, you're not the same person you once were. You're the heiress of the Kingsley family now, and Harrison adores you. How can I let you take on all this responsibility? I heard from Nathan that you're also managing Monarch Grand Hotels—that must be exhausting. Don't trouble yourself over me. Marcus takes good care of me."

Though he longed to see her more often, he couldn't bear the thought of her exhausting herself.

Evelyn stiffened slightly. She hadn’t expected Nathan to discuss her affairs with Reginald. In the past, he had treated her like nothing more than a decorative piece in his life.

Now that we're divorced, he suddenly cares?

She arched a brow. "So what if I'm Harrison's daughter? Does that mean I can't be your granddaughter anymore?" She lifted her chin defiantly. "I control my own life. I'll do whatever I please!"

Her fiery yet adorable display made both Reginald and Eleanor chuckle.

Just then, her phone buzzed. She glanced down at the screen.

[Theodore: Ms. Carter, everything is in place. Awaiting your signal.]

The banquet hall was a vision of opulence, the center stage adorned with cascading floral arrangements.

As the lights dimmed, the figures on stage grew more radiant. Nathan and Julian arrived fashionably late, their entrance drawing every eye in the room.

Despite their attempt at subtlety, their magnetic presence commanded attention.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Unbelievable," one guest muttered. "The famously reclusive Nathan Blackwood actually showed up for Victoria Sterling’s birthday banquet. She must have quite the hold on him."

Another smirked. "You think this is just a birthday party? How naïve. Haven’t you noticed? Victoria’s parents and the entire Blackwood family are here. This is clearly a cover for something bigger."

A third guest gasped. "Oh! So that’s why. I knew there had to be more to it."

A fourth scoffed. "Nothing stings more than comparison. I heard from my connections in the Sterling family—when Nathan married the first time, it was done in secret. No grand ceremony, no celebration. That woman spent three quiet years with him. And now? Look at this spectacle for his girlfriend’s birthday. Can you imagine the wedding they’ll throw? If I were the ex-wife, I’d be devastated."

Nathan’s jaw tightened as if he’d been slapped. Guilt twisted in his chest—toward Evelyn.

During their marriage, he’d never considered that he might have wronged her. But now, divorced and exposed, he felt like a sinner laid bare before the world.

Julian nudged him. "Nathan, are you all right? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."

"I'm fine," Nathan muttered, forcing a deep breath to steady himself.

In the front row, Leonard Blackwood sat beside the Sterling family, the arrangement eerily reminiscent of parents at a wedding.

Suddenly, the lighting shifted, and a lively melody filled the air.

Amid thunderous applause, Victoria made her grand entrance. She wore a silver haute couture gown, dripping with millions in jewels. The dress hugged her curves, leaving her shoulders bare as she glided forward, arm-in-arm with Penelope Whitmore.

Gasps erupted.

"That’s a Roza Walker original!" someone exclaimed.

"Stunning! And for just a birthday? Nathan must be obsessed with her!"

Victoria preened under the admiration, drunk on the attention.

Her only regret? That Nathan wasn’t standing beside her.

But tonight, she was the star. Nothing would ruin this moment.

Penelope stepped to the microphone. "Thank you all for joining us to celebrate my niece Victoria’s birthday. This is a truly special occasion, one she’ll cherish forever."

She took Victoria’s hand, her expression dripping with faux maternal affection.

"Before we continue…" Penelope paused dramatically. "There’s an important announcement."

The room fell silent.

Leonard maintained an unreadable smile. The Sterlings practically vibrated with excitement.

"Victoria Sterling and Nathan Blackwood are officially engaged!"
###Chapter 290

Gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by thunderous applause that shook the chandeliers.

Julian Montgomery froze for a heartbeat before turning to Nathan Blackwood with concern etched across his face.

Nathan stood like a marble statue, his icy aura creating an invisible barrier that kept everyone at bay.

The spotlight mercilessly found him, illuminating his ashen face that had lost all color.

Penelope Whitmore squeezed Victoria Sterling's hand, her face radiant with triumph. "Victoria and Nathan grew up together, facing every challenge side by side. Tonight, we're thrilled to announce their engagement! The Blackwood family couldn't be happier to share this joyous news with all our distinguished guests!"

Victoria's cheeks bloomed with a rosy hue, her eyes shining with bridal shyness. She gazed adoringly at Nathan, mistaking his rigid posture for nervous excitement.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen of Cliffside Manor...

Evelyn Carter stirred a pot of soup for Reginald and Eleanor when the door burst open.

Eleanor rushed in, her face ghostly pale. "Evelyn! Something terrible—" Her hands trembled violently. "Grandfather collapsed! He's not moving!"

The wooden spoon clattered against the floor as Evelyn's world tilted. Her pulse roared in her ears as she sprinted toward the living room.

Reginald lay sprawled on the Persian rug, his limbs twitching uncontrollably. Foam gathered at the corners of his twisted mouth, his eyes rolled back in their sockets.

"Stroke!" Evelyn gasped, immediately recognizing the symptoms.

Marcus Underwood hovered nearby, his face crumpled with panic. "I've called an ambulance! Hold on, Mr. Blackwood!"

"Marcus, stay calm!" Evelyn's voice cut through the chaos like steel. Dropping to her knees, she began administering emergency care with practiced precision.

Both Marcus and Eleanor gaped as she worked—her movements so precise she might have been wearing a doctor's coat.

Beads of sweat dotted Evelyn's forehead. "Marcus, where are Grandfather's acupuncture needles?"

"In his study!"

"Get them. Now." Her voice brooked no argument. When the needles arrived, Evelyn's hands didn't shake as she prepared them. "The ambulance won't make it in time. I need to stabilize him first."

Back at the grand ballroom...

Penelope and Victoria's announcement sent waves of excitement through the glittering crowd.

Society daughters watched with envy burning in their eyes as Victoria stood center stage like a fairy-tale princess.

"Can you believe her luck?" one debutante whispered behind her fan. "Marrying Nathan Blackwood? What did Victoria Sterling do to deserve this?"

Another guest's eyes narrowed at Victoria's flowing gown. "That dress hides something. Do you think she's... you know... with child?"

"Now that you mention it," a third voice joined in, "she did look different when she came in. That explains the sudden engagement!"

"Pregnant before marriage? How scandalous."

"If getting pregnant lands you a Blackwood, sign me up for scheming any day. That's hitting the jackpot!"
###Chapter 291

Victoria stood poised on stage, acutely aware of the murmurs rippling through the crowd below. Yet she held herself with the grace of a royal swan, chin lifted defiantly, her spirit unbroken by their whispers.

Let them talk, Victoria thought with a smirk. My glorious future is just beginning, while they'll forever remain insignificant tadpoles in their muddy ponds!

"Nathan! You need to see this!" Julian's voice cut through the air as he thrust his phone toward Nathan, his eyes wide with shock.

The screen displayed a viral hashtag burning across social media - #NathanAndVictoriasEngagement - its bold letters piercing through Nathan's stormy gaze like daggers.

Julian leaned in urgently. "I'm completely lost here. Didn't you tell me you were ending things with Victoria? Why is your stepmother announcing your engagement? It's everywhere! Even Leonard isn't objecting. What kind of game are they playing?"

A deafening roar filled Nathan's ears as his fists clenched, the fabric of his tailored suit straining over his rigid muscles.

He felt like a bowstring pulled to its breaking point, his chest constricting with barely contained fury that threatened to erupt at any moment.

Then -

The massive LED screen behind Victoria, which had been displaying elegant floating cherry blossoms, suddenly went black.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Is this part of the show?"

"Technical difficulties?"

As confused whispers spread, the screen flickered back to life - but instead of floral motifs, it now displayed a photograph of a young girl.

The child in the image was painfully thin, her matted hair framing a tear-streaked face. Her ragged clothes hung loosely on her tiny frame, her expression one of utter despair.

The heartbreaking image immediately stirred sympathy among the guests.

"Oh my God! Who is this poor child?"

"Is Ms. Sterling using her birthday gala for a charity appeal? I'd be happy to donate!"

Hearing the murmurs, Victoria and Margaret spun around to see the screen. "What's happening?" Penelope asked, her voice laced with alarm.

"That filthy urchin!" Victoria's perfectly painted lips twisted in disgust. "How did this mistake happen at my celebration?"

Margaret turned ghostly pale, leaping from her seat as if scalded. "Turn it off!" she shrieked, pointing wildly at the screen. "Shut it down immediately!"

Her hysterical reaction drew bewildered stares from nearby guests, including Leonard and Richard who exchanged confused glances at her disproportionate response.

Then a gravelly voice cut through the murmurs: "Why shut it down?"

Victoria's blood ran cold as she searched the crowd. When her eyes landed on Dominic's menacing figure emerging from the shadows, she nearly fainted from terror.

Cold sweat drenched her designer gown as her legs trembled uncontrollably. Her carefully crafted mask of composure cracked, revealing raw panic beneath.

Dominic stepped into the spotlight, his rugged appearance instantly commanding attention. "How touching," he sneered. "While you're here gorging on champagne and caviar, this child - your daughter, Victoria - suffers daily abuse at a Silvercrest orphanage. Tell me, do you even have a conscience left?"
###Chapter 292

Daughter? My Daughter?! Victoria's entire body shook violently at the revelation.

It felt like twin jackhammers were relentlessly pounding against her skull.

Only one thought echoed through her mind - How?! This was supposed to remain buried forever!

Now that the truth was exposed, the girl's resemblance to her became painfully obvious.

"No... this can't be..." Victoria whispered like a broken record, her face drained of color.

Dominic's laughter cut through the air like a knife. "How pathetic. How poetic." His cold eyes bore into her.

"Tell me, Victoria," he sneered, "What kind of mother fails to recognize her own flesh and blood?"

The grand ballroom erupted into chaos, the revelation hitting like a tsunami.

Half the guests stared at the trembling socialite on stage, while others watched Nathan's reaction with bated breath. The usually composed billionaire's jaw clenched so tightly it looked painful, his emerald eyes darkening dangerously.

Penelope's perfect facade cracked as she yanked Victoria close. "Explain yourself!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "Who is this man? How does he know you?"

Margaret Sterling, ever the protective mother, lunged at Dominic with surprising speed. "You filthy liar! How dare you slander my daughter!"

But Dominic, trained in combat, sidestepped effortlessly. Margaret went sprawling across the marble floor, her designer gown tearing as she landed with an undignified thud.

Snickers rippled through the crowd. Richard Sterling turned crimson, wishing the ground would swallow him whole.

Victoria ignored her fallen mother, screaming for security. "Get this madman out of here! Now!"

Dominic's rage boiled over at her denial. Just as he opened his mouth to retaliate, a voice colder than Arctic ice cut through the noise.

"Touch him, and you're fired."

Nathan advanced like a predator, his crimson-rimmed eyes locked on Victoria.

The woman he'd known since childhood - who'd played the angelic friend, the devoted lover - now seemed like a complete stranger. Every memory with her suddenly felt tainted.

"Darling, this is all a setup!" Victoria stumbled toward him, nearly tripping over her hem. The few steps felt like crossing a battlefield.

She clutched his arms desperately, her manicured nails digging into his suit sleeves. "You must believe me! I've loved only you my entire life! I remained pure for you all these years!"

Dominic barked out a laugh. "Pure? That's rich coming from you."

Victoria whirled on him, eyes blazing. "I'll sue you for defamation! I'll have you arrested!"

"Save your threats," Dominic spat. He yanked a document from his pocket and flung it at her. "DNA doesn't lie. That's your daughter's test results in black and white."

The damning papers fluttered to the ground between them.

Nathan's entire world tilted on its axis as he stared at the evidence. The woman he'd trusted implicitly had been lying to him for years.

Victoria's perfect life was unraveling before everyone's eyes. And Dominic? He'd drag her down to hell with him if it came to that.
###Chapter 293

The explosive revelation sent shockwaves through the grand ballroom, shaking the crystal chandeliers. Victoria Sterling felt the marble floor tilt beneath her designer heels.

"My God! This gutter rat is Victoria's lover?" A society matron gasped behind her fan. "What kind of depraved taste does she have? Engaged to Nathan Blackwood while rolling in the mud with this trash!"

The whispers cut like knives. "Rich girls always crave dirty thrills, don't they?"

"She even bore his bastard!" Another guest sneered. "Now she dares to parade as Blackwood's fiancée? What kind of monster abandons her own flesh and blood?"

The scandal erupted like champagne from a shaken bottle.

Suddenly, Dominic Reeves' mocking laughter sliced through the chaos. "Depression? Don't make me laugh!" He wiped imaginary tears. "A heartless viper like you wouldn't know depression if it bit you!"

The massive LED screen flickered again.

Medical records in crisp English appeared - damning evidence Victoria had paid millions to suppress. "Surprise, princess," Dominic taunted. "Your psychiatrist kept originals of all those forged documents. Smart woman - she knew you'd try dragging her down eventually."

Nathan Blackwood's knuckles turned white around the DNA report Julian Montgomery handed him. His voice carried icy precision. "This comes from the most reputable lab in the country. The results are indisputable."

Victoria's manicured claws dug into Nathan's arm. "Darling, when I left you, I wasn't in my right mind! The trauma, the medications-" Her tears smeared perfect mascara tracks. "I didn't know what I was doing in Silvercrest!"

Penelope Whitmore watched from the stage, torn between vindication and disgust. The viper had finally bitten herself - with venom lethal enough to kill her social standing forever.

Nathan's bitter laugh echoed through the sudden silence. He shook Victoria off like a diseased animal, watching dispassionately as she crumpled to the floor. Three years. Three years he'd spent vilifying Evelyn, defending this lying harpy. The irony burned like acid.

"Victoria Sterling," he enunciated each syllable like a death sentence, "we're done."

The ballroom doors burst open.

Four uniformed officers marched straight past the sobbing socialite - and clamped handcuffs around Margaret Sterling's bony wrists. "Margaret Sterling, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder."

The cold metal clicked shut on a dynasty's downfall.
###Chapter 294

Gasps echoed through the ballroom as all eyes locked onto Margaret Sterling's ghostly pale face. The cold metallic click of handcuffs snapping around her wrists sent a visible shudder through the crowd.

The officers wouldn't make such a public arrest without irrefutable evidence.

This could only mean one thing - Margaret's involvement in the murder plot was undeniable.

As the reality of her situation crashed over her, Margaret swayed dangerously, her vision tunneling into darkness. The glittering chandeliers above seemed to tilt precariously as her world collapsed around her.

This couldn't be happening! She'd been so careful - using offshore accounts, hiring professionals abroad. Every precaution had been taken. How had they traced it back to her?

"Margaret! Margaret!" Richard Sterling's desperate cries cut through the murmuring crowd. He lunged forward, only to clutch his chest and crumple to the marble floor in a dead faint.

"Someone call an ambulance!" Leonard Blackwood barked, immediately directing staff to attend to the fallen man.

Julian Montgomery's jaw dropped. "Bloody hell, Nathan! Your ex-mother-in-law just got arrested for murder! This party just became the scandal of the decade!"

Nathan Blackwood's expression remained glacial, his piercing gaze tracking the unfolding drama with detached indifference. "Justice served," he stated coldly. "Crime doesn't pay."

As officers escorted a disheveled Margaret past Victoria Sterling, their eyes met for one devastating moment. The raw terror in her mother's gaze shattered Victoria completely.

"No! You can't take her! She's innocent! Mother!" Victoria's hysterical screams turned to shrieks as she lunged forward - only for disaster to strike.

The precarious tape holding her designer gown in place finally gave way under stress and perspiration.

Gasps filled the air as the dress slithered to the floor, leaving Victoria exposed in nothing but her undergarments before the entire elite gathering.

"Ahhh!" She curled into herself, arms crossing protectively over her chest, humiliation burning through her like acid.

Penelope Whitmore's face twisted in disgust. This disastrous evening would haunt their family's reputation for years. All her careful planning ruined by this disgraceful spectacle.

Meanwhile, Cassandra Blackwood sipped her champagne in a shadowed corner, lips curling in satisfaction as she watched her nemesis' spectacular downfall. Several guests had already discreetly pulled out phones to capture the scandalous moment.

"Honestly mate," Julian quipped, nudging Nathan, "considering what's underneath, you've dodged one hell of a bullet."

Nathan turned away without a backward glance, decades of childhood memories now tainted beyond recognition.

"Nathan, please!" Victoria's desperate cry came as she scrambled after him, momentarily forgetting her state of undress in her panic.

"Good lord! Are those... stretch marks on Victoria's stomach?"

"They certainly look like it!"

"Definitely pregnancy stretch marks - I'd recognize them anywhere!"

"The absolute nerve! Playing the innocent virgin while hiding a pregnancy? Disgusting!"

"Mr. Blackwood's lucky escape if you ask me!"

Victoria's dreams of wealth and status evaporated before her eyes, the whispers cutting deeper than any blade.

Nathan's broad shoulders remained rigid as he strode toward the exit, his expression unreadable.

Julian followed silently, uncharacteristically at a loss for words as the weight of the evening's revelations settled over them both.
###Chapter 295

"Do you think I'm pathetic? A fool? Laughable?" Nathan's voice was raw, his lips twisting into a shattered, bitter smile.

Julian shook his head slowly. "No, Nathan. I'm your best friend—your brother. No matter what happens, I'd never mock you. I just... feel sorrow for you."

"Regret." Nathan squeezed his bloodshot eyes shut, ruthlessly shredding every memory tied to Evelyn in his mind until nothing remained—not even a trace.

"There's nothing to regret. I was blind. I deserve this," Nathan exhaled sharply.

"No, that's not true." Julian sighed, his voice heavy with sympathy. "It was those three years of marriage. Maybe you could've loved her if not for Victoria. You could've been happy instead of at war with each other. Don't you think?"

"Could've been happy." Nathan froze, his dark eyes glazing over momentarily.

"Nathan, can we not get divorced?"

"Because I love you."

A piercing ring echoed in his ears as he clutched his head, pain lancing through him. He staggered, bracing himself against the wall. Suffocation clawed at his throat.

Back then, Evelyn had begged him through tears not to end their marriage. He'd thought it was desperation—her clinging to a cage she'd built, refusing to let him go.

Only now did he understand.

Evelyn had never meant to trap him. The first time she confessed her love, she'd hoped to nurture it. She knew he'd never loved her.

She had fought to keep him because she feared that after the divorce, she wouldn't even have the right to love him anymore.

Julian interrupted his spiraling thoughts. "That child was already three or four years old. That means while Victoria was in Silvercrest, she was secretly with another man."

He continued, voice edged with disdain, "But if I recall correctly, she was still clinging to you back then—making you believe she adored you, that she was suffering abroad, waiting for you. In reality, she was anything but idle behind your back."

Nathan's chest tightened, agony wracking his body until even breathing felt like a struggle.

"Victoria always had men around her. You were just one of them," Julian said, his gaze piercing. "But in Evelyn's heart, it was always you. Do you remember that night you went to her house in the storm? Do you know what she told me?"

Nathan stared at him, sweat beading on his forehead.

"I tried to confess to her. She rejected me." Julian's smile was bitter. When had he ever humbled himself like that for a woman? "She said if it wasn't Nathan, she wouldn't love anyone. Without you, she wouldn't love anyone else."

Nathan's pupils constricted. Every organ in his body felt like it was being carved open by a blade, pain searing through every nerve.

Evelyn, you said you wouldn't love anyone else without me. But we've been apart for over three years. Did I appear in your life much earlier than that?

Why?

Why?!

Evelyn, I need you to give me an answer!

Just then, his phone vibrated violently in his hand. Trembling, he pulled it out—Marcus was calling. Fear spiked through him. Had something happened to Reginald?

"Marcus, is Grandfather alright?"

"Young Master Nathan! Old Master Reginald has suffered a stroke! Come to Crestview Hospital immediately!" Marcus's voice was urgent.

"What?!" Nathan's heart lurched.

Marcus quickly added, "Don't panic. He's been stabilized and moved to a VIP ward. His condition is under control now."

Relief was short-lived as Marcus continued, voice thick with emotion, "If it weren't for Ms. Kingsley's emergency first aid, we might not have bought enough time for the doctors to save him. Without her... he could've been in grave danger!"

Nathan's face burned with shame, as if he'd been slapped repeatedly.
###Chapter 296

The explosive scandal surrounding the Sterling family dominated every social media platform overnight. The internet's top trending topics shifted dramatically from Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Sterling's engagement announcement to hashtags like #VictoriaSterlingSecretDaughter and #MargaretSterlingMurderPlot.

Leaked footage from the disastrous birthday gala went viral within hours. Victoria's unhinged meltdown, where she resembled a rabid animal more than a socialite, and the compromising photos of her half-dressed state became the most shared content online.

The comment sections overflowed with venomous remarks directed at Victoria. Netizens expressed visceral disgust toward a woman who'd discard her own child for social advancement. Several online petitions demanded legal action against Victoria's alleged abuse.

[Abandoning her daughter overseas without a second thought? She's lower than vermin! At least rats care for their young!]

[Vermin: Please don't compare us to this trash!]

[So Nathan left his wife for this psycho? Impressive taste.]

[Nathan's clearly got sawdust for brains! Never met his ex but she's gotta be an upgrade from this trainwreck!]

[Ex-wife: Upgrade? That's the understatement of the century!]

[Childhood sweethearts? More like childhood nightmares! Note to self: run whenever I hear those two words!]

[This is better than any soap opera! Someone call Netflix - we need a limited series ASAP!]

Destroying reputations appeared effortless on the surface. Only the Kingsley brothers understood the meticulous planning behind every revelation that toppled Victoria from her gilded pedestal.

Evelyn always moved with calculated precision. When she struck, she ensured her enemies would never recover.

Outside the Blackwood Hotel, a media circus unfolded. Police vehicles and gawking crowds created gridlock. When Margaret Sterling emerged in handcuffs, her ashen face and trembling legs required two officers to support her.

Spectators eagerly filmed the humiliating spectacle, their phones capturing every degrading moment for viral consumption.

Across the street, Sebastian and Dominic Kingsley observed from their Rolls-Royce. The tinted windows rose smoothly, concealing their satisfaction at orchestrating justice for their baby sister.

"Dom, I considered hiring troll farms to amplify the Sterlings' scandal," Sebastian remarked, sipping espresso. "But public outrage seems sufficiently... organic."

Dominic scrolled through trending comments, his piercing gaze mirroring their brother Maxwell's intensity. "Ash, must you always assume I'm angling for discounts? I've never hesitated spending on Evelyn!"

"True," Sebastian teased, "but only for Evelyn. This time, isn't it also for her sake?"

Dominic's eyes sparkled mischievously. "You took point on this operation - you deserve the credit. Besides, as the younger brother, shouldn't you indulge me occasionally?"

Sebastian chuckled, ruffling Dominic's hair. "All those years prosecuting white-collar crime honed your negotiation skills."

Dominic's phone rang as he reached for it. "Speak of the devil - Raymond's calling!"

He activated speakerphone. "Ray, status update?"

"Margaret's in custody," Raymond's gruff voice announced. "The hitman's being processed as we speak. That bastard won't see sunlight for decades."

Lillian Hartwell, Harrison Kingsley's second wife, had borne three children. Their brother Henry Kingsley served as Monarch Group's chief pilot, while sister Arabella had married into Serenia's political elite with First Lady potential.
###Chapter 297

Raymond Kingsley, the youngest son of the prestigious Kingsley family, had dreamed of becoming a crime-fighting officer since he was a boy. Now, he had achieved his goal, rising to the rank of captain in Crestview's elite Criminal Investigation Division.

"Come on! Hit him harder! Don't stop until he breaks!" Raymond's aggressive words only fueled Dominic's frustration.

"Can't you detectives get creative with your interrogation techniques?"

Dominic clenched his fist against the car window. "We prosecutors don't have that kind of freedom. Don't waste this opportunity!"

Sebastian, standing nearby, shook his head with a wry smile.

Harrison Kingsley's daughters were graceful and refined, like royalty. But his sons? They were ruthless, relying on brute force more than their father ever had—and he had once ruled the streets.

When the three brothers worked together, their targets had only two choices: surrender or face annihilation.

Nathan Blackwood raced to the hospital, his heart pounding. Julian Montgomery, unwilling to let him go alone, followed close behind. The sleek sports car screeched to a halt at the entrance, and Nathan bolted inside without hesitation.

Reginald Blackwood was the only person Nathan truly cared about in the Blackwood family. His grandfather had always treated him with unconditional love, something no one else had ever offered.

"Grandpa... Grandpa..."

Nathan's voice was raw with emotion as he sprinted down the corridor.

When he turned the corner, he saw Evelyn sitting on a bench, cradling a sleeping Eleanor in her arms. The scene was serene, like a masterpiece capturing the quiet beauty of life.

Evelyn's long fingers gently brushed Eleanor's hair. Her expression was peaceful, almost angelic, yet there was an undeniable strength in her delicate frame. She was the kind of woman who appeared when someone needed saving—like a guardian descending from the heavens.

A sharp pang of guilt twisted in Nathan's chest. Thank God she was here.

Hearing his footsteps, Evelyn lifted her gaze. Their eyes met, and for a fleeting second, something warm flickered in her bright irises—something that made Nathan's heart stutter.

But just as quickly, it vanished. Her expression turned icy, her stare piercing through him like a blade.

"I assume Ms. Sterling's birthday celebration is over? How noble of Mr. Blackwood to abandon his mess and rush here." She didn't raise her voice, but her words cut deeper than any insult.

Nathan stepped closer, regret heavy in his eyes.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, wishing she could shut out the world. "Grandpa is resting now. Marcus is with him. You should wait outside."

"Evelyn... I'm sorry," Nathan choked out, his voice rough.

"Sorry?" Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Nathan, the person you owe an apology to is the man lying in that hospital bed—the one who barely escaped death. Why are you apologizing to me? I mean nothing to you. But your grandfather? He loved you. The least you can do is be here for him. I happened to be nearby this time, but what about next time? Death doesn't give second chances."

Her voice wavered, her eyes reddening. "I hate this. I hate that he's not my grandfather. I hate that I can't stay by his side forever. I wish I could sew him into my pocket and keep him safe every second of the day."

Nathan's throat tightened. His apologies meant nothing to her—they were worthless.

"Nathan!" Julian's voice cut through the tension as he strode in. He glanced at Evelyn, confusion flickering across his face, before turning to Nathan with a grim expression. "We need to talk. Now."
###Chapter 298

"What's wrong? Just hand it over right here," Nathan commanded, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn.

"Nathan! Nathan! My love!" A desperate wail echoed through the sterile hospital hallway. The shrill cry sent chills down Julian's spine.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his body tensing at the sound of Victoria's voice.

Startled awake by the commotion, Eleanor clutched Evelyn's sleeve, her wide eyes filled with panic. "What's happening? Is Grandpa okay?"

Evelyn soothed her with a gentle touch. "Everything's fine. With me here, nothing bad will happen to Grandpa."

She shot a frosty glance at the disheveled Victoria before guiding Eleanor away. "Come, sweetheart. Let's get you somewhere quiet to rest. You can see Grandpa as soon as he wakes up."

The way she walked away without so much as a backward glance struck Nathan like a bullet to the chest, leaving him breathless.

"Nathan!" Victoria sobbed, her eyes puffy from crying. She tried to rush toward him, but Julian blocked her path with an outstretched arm.

"Ms. Sterling, this isn't the time. You should be at your father's bedside or hiring a competent lawyer for your mother. That's what a devoted daughter would do," Julian reprimanded coldly.

Ignoring him, Victoria turned her tear-streaked face toward Nathan. "I've been set up! I'm the victim here! Nathan, you have to believe me—how could I ever betray you when I love you more than anything?"

Nathan's back remained rigidly turned, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. The word "love" from her lips filled him with nothing but revulsion.

He finally spoke, his voice dripping with disdain. "The child is already walking. You've made a complete mockery of everything. If you had even an ounce of shame, you wouldn't dare speak of love. Just hearing you makes me sick."

Julian added with a sneer, "You should thank Nathan for his mercy. If it were up to me, your cheating husband wouldn't get a proper burial, and your entire family would be banished from Crestview—permanently."

His brutal words shattered Victoria's composure, reducing her to hysterical sobs.

After a long silence, Nathan finally turned, his icy stare freezing her in place. "Leave. Now."

"No! I won't go!" Victoria protested with a pitiful whimper, still clinging to the delusion that playing the victim would sway him. She didn't realize Nathan had already sent a discreet text to Oliver.

Within moments, Oliver arrived with two imposing bodyguards in tow.

Nathan's voice was glacial. "Remove her. Don't let her disturb the other patients."

"Right away, Mr. Blackwood," Oliver replied crisply. Rolling up his sleeves in irritation, he and the other guard seized Victoria's arms, dragging her toward the exit.

"I never slept with Dominic! He—he forced himself on me when I rejected him! That's how I got pregnant with that... that monster!"

In a last-ditch effort to regain Nathan's sympathy, Victoria spun a grotesque lie, her voice trembling with fake anguish. "He blackmailed me! When I refused to comply, he decided to destroy me completely! Nathan, I'm a victim too! Why won't you believe me?"

"Victoria." Nathan's eyes burned with a cold fury that extinguished any remaining hope in her. "Our breakup has nothing to do with that man or the child."

Her mouth fell open in stunned silence, her mind scrambling to process his words.
###Chapter 299

"If you had fallen for someone else in Silvercrest and even had a child without telling me..."

Nathan Blackwood's eyes darkened with barely contained fury, his fingers clenching into white-knuckled fists. "I might have forgiven you. But you lied to me about having depression. You weaponized my trauma and manipulated my emotions. You tried to force me into marriage with your deception!"

Victoria Sterling's face drained of color, her lips trembling wordlessly.

The gravity of her mistake crashed over her. When she'd fabricated her mental illness, she'd only thought of it as a way to keep Nathan's attention. She'd forgotten that both Nathan and his mother were survivors of depression's cruel grip. His fear of history repeating itself had made him tolerate her lies and abandon Evelyn—the woman who genuinely loved him.

She hadn't considered that when this deception unraveled, she wouldn't just be exposing her manipulation of Nathan, but also disrespecting his mother's memory.

Forgiveness? Unthinkable.

"You turned my mother's suffering and my past into weapons against me." Nathan's voice was raw with betrayal, his bitter laugh scraping against the tension in the room. "Victoria, you've made me the greatest fool in Crestview."

"It's not— I didn't—" Victoria stammered helplessly.

Julian Montgomery cut in with disgust. "You grew up with Nathan. You knew better than anyone what he endured. If you had one shred of decency, you wouldn't have exploited his pain." His glare intensified. "Using your childhood bond as emotional blackmail? I doubt you ever truly loved him. This is revolting. I'd rather die alone than be with someone like you."

"Enough, Julian." Nathan couldn't bear to hear another word about Victoria's treachery. "Oliver," he commanded his assistant, "get her out of my sight. Permanently."

Oliver Sinclair's expression turned icy as he seized Victoria's arm, dragging her toward the exit like discarded trash.

"Nathan Blackwood!" Victoria finally shed her pitiful act, her shriek echoing through the corridor. "All these excuses just mean you've found someone new! You're in love with that bitch Evelyn! What's so special about her? Did she save your life? She approached you with a fake identity—she's deceiving you too!"

"Silence!" Nathan's roar was thunderous, his eyes blazing. "You will not speak her name. If you insult Evelyn again, I'll ensure the Sterling family disappears from this country's elite. Get. Out."

The violence in his tone shattered Victoria's bravado. Without Oliver's grip, she would have crumpled to the floor.

She'd underestimated Evelyn's hold on Nathan's heart. Using her as leverage had been a fatal miscalculation.

As the elevator doors swallowed Victoria's trembling form, the tension in the hallway dissipated.

"Regardless of everything... congratulations are in order." Julian clapped Nathan's shoulder, relief evident in his voice. "However long the deception lasted, breaking free is what matters. It's never too late."

"Never too late?" Nathan's laugh was hollow, his broad shoulders slumping. Then why did it feel like everything precious had already slipped through his fingers?
###Chapter 300

Victoria Sterling was hauled toward the hospital entrance like a ragdoll. The commotion drew a crowd of wide-eyed medical staff, their whispers cutting through the sterile air.

At this point, she had nothing left to lose—not even the tattered remains of her pride.

Hah!

In perfect unison, Oliver Sinclair and the bodyguard released their grip. Victoria crumpled to the floor in a heap of designer fabric and shattered dignity.

"Got any sanitizer?" Oliver asked, wiping his hands on his suit jacket.

The bodyguard shook his head. "Sorry, Mr. Sinclair."

"Disgusting," Oliver muttered, shooting Victoria a look of pure disdain. "Get some antiseptic wipes from the nurses. We need to sterilize after touching trash."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode through the automatic doors, leaving Victoria sprawled on the cold tiles.

Outside, thunder split the sky like a gunshot. Within seconds, rain hammered down in sheets, steaming against the pavement.

Too broken to move, Victoria sat motionless as the storm drenched her. Her once-pristine updo unraveled into ratty strands. Smudged mascara streaked her cheeks like war paint.

"Nathan Blackwood, I saved your life!" she shrieked, slapping a puddle in fury. Muddy water splashed into her eyes, and she howled when her bedazzled acrylic nails snapped off.

Just then, a sleek Rolls-Royce Phantom screeched to a halt inches from her knees, spraying her with gutter filth.

"You reckless idiot!" Victoria scrambled backward, screeching like a harpy. "I'll sue you into oblivion!"

The driver emerged with a black umbrella, ignoring her completely. He opened the rear door with ceremonial precision.

Sebastian Kingsley stepped out first, taking the umbrella. He held it aloft as his brother Dominic exited the vehicle. Even through the downpour, the Kingsley brothers radiated lethal elegance.

Victoria's curses died in her throat.

"Ms. Sterling," Dominic drawled, eyeing her bedraggled form. "Isn't your father at Memorial Hospital? Why the performance here?"

"Let's go," Sebastian said coldly. "Evelyn's waiting."

They walked past without another glance, their Italian loafers avoiding the puddles—and the woman drowning in them.

"Why?" Victoria clawed at her sodden dress. "Why does Evelyn Carter get everything? Love. Protection. Even Nathan chose her over me!"

Lightning flashed, illuminating her twisted expression.

"I'll kill you, Evelyn," she whispered to the storm. "I swear on my life, I'll watch you burn."

Inside the private suite, Evelyn hummed a lullaby while tucking Eleanor Blackwood into bed. The girl's eyelashes fluttered shut, her breathing steady at last.

Exhaustion weighed on Evelyn's shoulders as she crept toward the door. When she opened it, Nathan stood frozen in the hallway.

His Armani suit was immaculate, but his eyes were shattered.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to his lapel—to the dragon-engraved platinum tie pin glittering there.

Her stomach clenched. She'd designed that piece during their first Valentine's as husband and wife. Had personally selected the Burmese rubies. Had imagined it would symbolize their forever.

Now it felt like a slap in the face.

Just like how he'd commissioned Crimson Promise for Victoria.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips. How ironic that he'd dusted off her discarded gift now.

As if sentiment could undo betrayal.
###Chapter 301

"I've asked Victoria to leave, so she won't disturb you anymore." Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn's impassive eyes. His throat worked visibly as he swallowed hard.

"Really? Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn's lips curved into a mocking smile sharp enough to draw blood. "At least you've solved one problem tonight. Though I wonder... did Ms. Sterling receive another $20 million and a villa this time?"

CRACK!

The thunder outside seemed to strike Nathan directly. His broad shoulders tensed as an invisible blade twisted in his chest.

The memory of slamming divorce papers before Evelyn resurfaced with brutal clarity. Back then, he'd been so desperate to escape their contractual marriage that he'd never considered the devastation it would cause. The signed documents, still bearing tear stains, remained on his nightstand as a constant reminder.

Nathan's breath hitched as he imagined Evelyn alone in their bedroom that day, signing away their marriage while he rushed to Victoria's side. The phantom taste of copper filled his mouth as his throat constricted painfully.

The entire world might have betrayed him, but Evelyn had loved him with heartbreaking sincerity. Even without returning her feelings, he'd had no right to shatter her heart so carelessly.

Now he stood before her, desperately trying to piece together what he'd destroyed.

"Marcus told me you used acupuncture to save Grandfather." Nathan's voice emerged rough with emotion. "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." Evelyn's tone could have frozen hell. "He's my grandfather too. Now if you'll excuse me—"

She moved to leave, but Nathan blocked her path.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with barely restrained fury. "Even stray dogs know better than to block people's way. Are you less civilized than a mutt, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Evelyn, I want to make amends." Nathan's intense gaze burned into her. "Name your price. Whatever compensation you want—"

"Are you mentally deficient?" Evelyn's incredulous laugh held no warmth. "You should have that brain of yours scanned. I think years of poor judgment have finally rotted it through."

"I know I hurt you—"

"Stop." Evelyn slashed a hand through the air. "Don't apologize to me ever again. I've heard enough empty words to last a lifetime. The truth is simple—you loved Victoria, promised to marry only her. There's nothing wrong with honoring that vow. You were right all along, Nathan. The mistake was mine for loving the wrong man. But I swear on my life—I'll never make that mistake again."

Nathan's eyes reddened. His fingers curled into fists so tight his knuckles blanched.

Each word struck like a dagger, pinning him to the wall of his own shame.

They'd both loved the wrong person. The difference was Evelyn had woken from that nightmare, rebuilt herself stronger than before. While Nathan remained trapped, sinking deeper into an abyss of regret with no bottom in sight.

"Evelyn!"

At the familiar voice, Evelyn turned to see Sebastian and Dominic approaching down the corridor. Her entire demeanor transformed, the ice in her eyes melting instantly.

"Seb! Dom!" She shoved past Nathan without a backward glance, practically skipping toward her brothers. "I'm starving! Can you make me a midnight snack?"

"Me too!" Dominic slung an arm around Evelyn's shoulders, mimicking her pout. "Feed us, big brother!"

Sebastian chuckled, ruffling both their hair like they were children again. "Alright, you bottomless pits. Let's get you fed."

Nathan watched the trio disappear around the corner, the silence pressing against his eardrums like physical pain. An emptiness yawned in his chest where his heart should be.

Without him, Evelyn still had love in abundance.

But without Evelyn, Nathan had become a hollow shell of a man.
###Chapter 302

Though Evelyn had left the hospital, her concern for Reginald Blackwood weighed heavily on her mind.

She needed to reach out to Lillian Hartwell. The Kingsley family's generations of medical expertise made their facilities the most advanced in the country. Perhaps Lillian could suggest treatment options for Reginald's chronic condition.

During the drive back, Dominic scrolled endlessly through social media. Whenever he found particularly scathing comments about Victoria Sterling, he'd read them aloud with wicked amusement.

"These keyboard warriors are usually so annoying, but today they're absolutely delightful!" Dominic wiped tears of laughter from his eyes as he read another vicious post. "I should frame some of these!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, gazing out the window. The sight of Nathan wearing that golden brooch tonight had stirred an uncomfortable restlessness in her chest.

Those gifts represented a past full of humiliation - memories she'd rather forget. She'd destroy every last one before letting Nathan keep them.

"Evelyn, Raymond has arrested Margaret and Dominic Reeves." Sebastian's warm palm settled on the nape of her neck, his thumb tracing soothing circles against her skin.

"Raymond just texted that Reeves confessed immediately," Sebastian continued. "But Margaret refuses to talk. No matter what interrogation tactics they use, she insists the murder was entirely her idea. No conspiracy, no accomplices."

"Even vipers protect their young," Evelyn murmured, forcing her turbulent emotions into order. Her voice turned crisp and detached. "With her husband ill and son imprisoned, Victoria is Margaret's only remaining hope. Of course she'd protect her daughter."

Evelyn had played this chess match masterfully. She'd drawn the snake from its hole and trapped it in her carefully laid snare.

She'd sent Theodore to tail Margaret to Silvercrest. An untrained socialite like Margaret never noticed the surveillance. That's how Theodore discovered the orphanage hiding Victoria's illegitimate child.

Theodore described the place as a children's concentration camp.

Seeing those filthy, neglected orphans had filled Theodore with such rage he'd nearly broken protocol. How could such cruelty exist in this world?

Margaret had removed the girl from the orphanage but couldn't stomach murder herself. Instead she'd hired some desperate, uneducated woman to do the deed.

Fortunately, Theodore intervened in time, spiriting the child to safety aboard Evelyn's private jet. Now the girl rested securely in police custody.

"That child is her own flesh and blood," Sebastian's voice darkened. "This wasn't protection - it was cold calculation. She sacrificed her granddaughter to preserve her daughter's marriage prospects."

Evelyn nodded grimly.

"Don't worry, Evelyn." Dominic cracked his knuckles, his smile taking on a dangerous edge reminiscent of Maxwell's. "Raymond and I will ensure Margaret never sees daylight again. As for Reeves?" He chuckled darkly. "Does he think prison will be his worst punishment? His nightmare is only beginning."

The Blackwood estate descended into chaos after the gala.

Nathan remained at the hospital with his grandfather, but Leonard and Penelope hadn't visited Reginald in hours. The scandal involving Margaret and Victoria had clearly overwhelmed them.

"Mr. Blackwood, negative press about you is trending online," Oliver Sinclair fretted. "Shall I contact PR to manage this?"

Nathan slumped in the hospital corridor, his striking features drawn with exhaustion. His left leg crossed over his right as he leaned against the cold wall, the elegant line of his throat creating a heartbreaking silhouette. Even in despair, his beauty remained devastating.

"Aren't they right to criticize me?" Nathan's voice rasped. He tugged at his tie, though it did nothing to ease the suffocating pressure in his chest. "I deserve every word."

"Mr. Blackwood, please don't say that." Oliver swallowed hard. "You were manipulated by that witch. You're as much a victim as—"

"Victim." Nathan's brow twitched. The word lanced through him, but the only true victim he could envision was Evelyn.

He'd been Rosalind's blade, wielded cruelly against Evelyn.

If Rosalind had caused his suffering, then he'd caused Evelyn's.
###Chapter 303

"Master Nathan!"

Agnes Thornton's voice echoed down the hospital corridor as she hurried toward Nathan Blackwood, her arms laden with shopping bags.

"Nathan." The weary man rose immediately to relieve her burden. "What brings you here at this hour?"

"When Oliver mentioned Grandfather Reginald's hospitalization and that you'd be staying overnight, I thought you might need supplies." Agnes began unpacking toiletries and neatly folded clothes. "I've also prepared midnight snacks for you and Oliver."

Nathan's gaze dropped to the steaming containers. The warmth radiating from them contrasted sharply with the cold numbness in his chest.

"Thank you, Agnes, but I'm not hungry. Oliver can have them." The recent events had left him emotionally drained, his appetite nonexistent.

"I-I couldn't possibly!" Oliver Sinclair shook his head vigorously. "That wouldn't be proper, sir."

"Honestly!" Agnes huffed, grabbing a croissant and shoving it unceremoniously into Nathan's mouth. "Are you moping over that scheming Victoria Sterling? Pathetic! I expected better from you!"

Nathan managed a wry smile as he chewed the forced offering. "This isn't about her."

"Then what? Young Madam Evelyn?" Agnes's knowing eyes sparkled with mischief.

Nathan choked, his cheeks coloring faintly. "Ahem. It's Grandfather's condition that concerns me."

"Since we're at the hospital," Agnes said with exaggerated innocence, "perhaps we should schedule a brain scan for you first thing tomorrow."

Oliver discreetly signaled his approval behind Nathan's back. Only Agnes dared speak to the formidable Blackwood heir with such candor.

"Agnes." Nathan's voice turned glacial. "I recognize my past mistakes regarding Evelyn because of Victoria's interference. But even without Victoria, my marriage to Evelyn would have ended. Our union was Grandfather's arrangement, not a love match. I don't regret the divorce."

"Three years, Master Nathan! Three years Madam Evelyn devoted to you heart and soul!" Agnes's voice cracked with emotion. "Even glaciers melt with that kind of warmth! Are you truly telling me you feel nothing for her? Nothing at all?"

"I don't love Evelyn."

Nathan's pulse stuttered as the lie left his lips. "Without love, why should I keep her bound to me?"

Oliver's shoulders slumped in silent disappointment. He'd witnessed the subtle changes in his employer whenever Evelyn was mentioned.

But Nathan's traumatic past - his mother's suicide, his family's neglect, Victoria's betrayal - had erected impenetrable emotional walls.

"Master Nathan," Agnes sighed, "there's no shame in admitting mistakes or seeking forgiveness. Surely your pride isn't worth sacrificing a lifetime's happiness?" Her expression softened. "If you'd just be honest with yourself, I'd help you win her back!"

"Me too!" Oliver chimed in eagerly before catching Nathan's withering glare that promised imminent transfer to a Siberian mining operation.

"Oh! Almost forgot." Agnes produced a sleek voice recorder from her pocket. "A distinguished gentleman visited Cliffside Manor tonight and asked me to deliver this."

Nathan accepted the device warily. "Who was it?"

"He introduced himself as Mr. Winslow."

Nathan's breath hitched. Exchanging a glance with Oliver, he pressed play.
###Chapter 304

The Sterling family's downfall became the talk of the town overnight.

Netizens mocked them as the ultimate cautionary tale for white-collar crime, suggesting they deserved an award for their spectacular failure at covering their tracks.

Margaret Sterling was arrested for conspiracy to commit murder and hiring a hitman. Though it wasn’t enough for the death penalty, she faced at least two decades behind bars. At fifty, she’d likely spend the rest of her life in prison.

Richard Sterling suffered a massive heart attack amid the chaos and was rushed to the ICU. The delay in medical attention caused severe brain damage from oxygen deprivation.

"Ms. Sterling, you should prepare yourself," the doctor said gravely. "There’s a high chance your father will remain in a vegetative state."

Victoria Sterling stood frozen outside the hospital room, her face drained of color as if struck by lightning.

The Sterling Corporation was drowning in debt. Creditors and suppliers hounded Victoria day and night, forcing her to hide in a hotel, too terrified to return home.

Between her mother’s legal fees and her father’s medical bills, Victoria had nearly exhausted her savings, getting a bitter taste of poverty for the first time. But things only worsened.

Two days later, an assistant from Rosalind Couture tracked her down.

Victoria had abandoned the borrowed gown in her frantic escape from the gala. When she finally remembered and went to retrieve it, she found the once-pristine dress trampled beyond recognition, covered in dirt and footprints.

"Five times the compensation?!" Victoria shrieked, clutching the invoice with shaking hands. Her eyes burned with fury. "Six million dollars for a ruined dress? This is daylight robbery!"

"Six million is nothing for our clientele," the assistant replied coolly. "Our patrons regularly spend tens of millions on couture. If you couldn’t afford it, you shouldn’t have borrowed it in the first place."

"You—how dare you speak to me like that! I’ll sue you!" Victoria’s voice cracked with rage, her face twisted in fury.

"Go ahead," the assistant said with a dismissive smirk. "But pay the amount within two weeks, or we’ll take legal action."

With that, she walked away, leaving Victoria trembling in humiliation.

Victoria collapsed into a chair, covering her face as silent sobs wracked her body. Soon, the dam broke, and she wept uncontrollably.

When the tears finally dried, she wiped her face with shaky hands, straightened her shoulders, and drove straight to Cliffside Manor.

Her last hope was Penelope Whitmore.

This mess was partly Penelope’s fault—she couldn’t just abandon her now!

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family sat around the dining table in tense silence.

Reginald Blackwood’s health had stabilized, and his complexion had regained its healthy glow. The stubborn old man had refused to stay in the hospital, opting to recuperate at his Moonlight Cove estate instead.

The entire family was present tonight, including Nathan Blackwood.

But the atmosphere was so thick with tension it could choke a person.

Normally, Penelope would flaunt her affection for Leonard Blackwood at the table, feeding him bites of food just to provoke Nathan.

Tonight, however, the couple ate in stony silence. Leonard’s expression was stormy, while Penelope picked at her food with no appetite.

Cassandra Blackwood, on the other hand, ate heartily, savoring every bite.

"Must you eat so much?" Penelope snapped, her frustration boiling over. "Look at your face—it’s round enough as it is! No man will want you if you keep this up!"

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "I’ll eat as much as I want. And unlike some people, I don’t need a man to validate me."

She turned to her parents with a shrug. "Honestly, you’re overreacting. Sure, it’s a mess now, but better to deal with it early. A little pain now saves a lifetime of regret."
###Chapter 305

Cassandra scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Better this than letting that gold-digging witch and her parasitic family bleed us dry."

Victoria Sterling and Nathan Blackwood never had an official engagement party—just a cold, calculated announcement. Severing ties wouldn't be difficult.

"Shut your mouth and eat!" Penelope Whitmore snapped, shooting her daughter a venomous glare. Cassandra's lack of tact was infuriating.

Leonard Blackwood's expression darkened further.

Another miscalculation by Penelope. Another disaster for the Blackwood name.

At least Victoria's sordid past had been exposed in time. If not, her illegitimate child and scandal would have turned Nathan and the Blackwoods into a laughingstock.

"Madam!"

The butler rushed in, his face strained. "Ms. Sterling is at the gates. She insists on speaking with you."

Penelope's blood ran cold. Every nerve in her body screamed danger.

"Let her in. She is your niece, after all." Leonard's voice was ice, his gaze fixed on his untouched wine.

Penelope knew Victoria wouldn't leave without a confrontation. Jaw clenched, she strode toward the foyer.

"Aunt Penelope!"

Victoria lunged forward, nails digging into Penelope's arm. "You have to help my mother! She's your sister—your own flesh and blood!"

"Help her?" Penelope hissed, barely restraining her fury. "Your mother is a fool. Only an idiot would hire a hitman to kill a child when she could have just paid to make the problem disappear. Did she think murder was easy?"

"But what choice did we have? Evelyn already knew about my past in Silvercrest! She was going to ruin me! With her resources, she'd have found the girl eventually!"

"Pathetic." Penelope's lips curled. "Evelyn played you. She barely lifted a finger, and you handed her victory. Now your reputation is in tatters, your child is exposed, and you dare ask me to clean up your mess?"

Years of careful planning—destroyed in one move. The rage simmered, but Penelope wouldn't repeat her sister's mistakes. She needed to cut ties. Now.

"Aunt Penelope, you can't abandon us!" Victoria's voice cracked. "The creditors are hunting me! My father's in a coma—I can't even afford his hospital bills!"

She trembled, recalling the threats. "Just lend me enough to settle the debts. I'll pay you back once the company recovers!"

Penelope laughed, cold and sharp. "Recover? Your brother's in prison. Your father's a vegetable. The Sterling empire is dust. Even if I sold you piece by piece, it wouldn't cover what you owe." She leaned in, venomous. "Run. Take whatever's left and disappear in Silvercrest. Isn't that where all your loyal friends are?"

She tried to shake Victoria off, but the younger woman's grip tightened.

Victoria's tear-filled eyes hardened. "After everything I've done for you? All the schemes, the lies—the way you used me to manipulate Nathan, to torment him until his mother killed herself?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Help me, or I swear, I'll tell Leonard everything."

Penelope froze.

Victoria smiled, slow and vicious. "I have nothing left to lose."
###Chapter 306

Penelope Whitmore's palms turned clammy as she strode back to the dining room, her mind racing. How dare that scheming little viper Victoria Sterling threaten me!

She took comfort knowing there was no concrete evidence of her discreet manipulations over the years.

But Leonard Blackwood's affection had noticeably cooled. If Victoria kept pouring oil on troubled waters, Penelope's standing in the Blackwood household would deteriorate further.

She needed to resolve Victoria's debt situation without dipping into her own funds. The solution? A masterfully performed tearful plea before Leonard.

"Darling," Penelope placed her delicate hand over Leonard's clenched fist, her voice trembling with manufactured emotion. "I know Victoria made mistakes, but you've known her since childhood. Remember how sweet and obedient she used to be?"

Tears welled in her eyes as she continued, "With her mother imprisoned and father comatose, poor Victoria can't even afford basic necessities. Those ruthless debt collectors have terrified her into homelessness. I raised her too - how can I bear seeing her like this?"

She sniffled dramatically. "You've always been so generous and forgiving. Consider this an act of charity to help her through this difficult time. People will praise your benevolence."

Leonard's stern expression softened slightly. The manipulation was working.

Suddenly, a fist slammed onto the table.

The abrupt noise startled everyone. Cassandra Blackwood nearly choked on her food. Nathan Blackwood, who had remained silent throughout the meal, pulled a recording device from his pocket and tossed it onto the table.

"If you truly want to help Victoria," his voice dripped with icy sarcasm, "listen to this first."

Penelope's heart pounded violently. What game was Nathan playing now?

Leonard picked up the recorder with a puzzled frown and pressed play.

The voices of Dominic Reeves and Victoria Sterling filled the room:

"Don't make any moves against Evelyn until I give the signal. Things are progressing perfectly now that I've regained Nathan's trust. Leonard even approved our engagement - we'll announce it soon."

"And my five million dollars?"

"Must you be so impatient over petty cash? I'll transfer fifty thousand first. Blow it all if you want. Once Nathan and I are officially engaged, you'll get the balance."

When the recording ended, stunned silence gripped the dining room.

Penelope's face turned to stone. She bitterly regretted speaking up for Victoria now.

That brainless fool! How could she be so careless?! She deserves whatever's coming to her!

"Aunt Penelope," Nathan's bloodshot eyes burned with fury, "is this the 'sweet girl' you raised?"

His laugh held no humor. "You should thank my ex-wife for being sharp enough to expose your niece's treachery early. Had anything happened to Evelyn, I would have made Victoria's existence more painful than death itself."

Penelope gasped, staring at Nathan's merciless expression in shock.

She'd always assumed Nathan took after his father - sentimental, indecisive, emotionally vulnerable.

After all, he'd remained devoted to Victoria for years. Surely severing such deep emotional ties would be difficult?

She never anticipated this cold, ruthless version of Nathan. Whatever affection he'd held for Victoria had clearly evaporated.

"Victoria views me and our family as nothing but ATMs and stepping stones," Nathan wiped his lips with a napkin before rising gracefully.

His glacial gaze swept over them. "Chairman Blackwood, if you're determined to play philanthropist, there are countless orphanages, nursing homes, and schools across Crestview worthy of your generosity. Why waste it on a woman with such transparent ulterior motives?"
###Chapter 307

Nathan's handsome face darkened after his declaration. Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode out of the dining hall.

Penelope's heart clenched as she watched his retreating figure—tall, broad-shouldered, and radiating icy detachment.

At the same moment, Leonard abruptly withdrew his hand from beneath Penelope's and rose to his feet, his expression stern.

"Nathan is right." His voice was sharp with finality. "They brought this upon themselves. We've extended our help time and again, but now that they've caused this disaster, we can't afford to be dragged down with them. From now on, stay out of the Sterlings' affairs. That family is nothing but poison!"

With that, Leonard stormed out, leaving the table in tense silence.

Cassandra smirked, chewing her steak with exaggerated relish. "Honestly, Mother, why do you even care? Let that scheming Victoria rot in her own mess."

"Shut your mouth! You understand nothing!"

Penelope's composure shattered. Her eyes flashed with fury as she snatched a bread roll from the table and hurled it at Cassandra.

I underestimated him. The thought burned through Penelope's mind. He's even more ruthless than his father.

Now, it seemed she had no choice but to dip into her private funds to settle the Sterlings' debts. The thought was like swallowing glass—painful and humiliating.

After dinner, Nathan headed straight for the garage. Within minutes, his sleek black car was speeding toward Moonlight Cove.

He had expected relief after cutting Victoria out of his life. Instead, an unsettling hollowness gnawed at him.

From the moment he took the reins of Blackwood Industries, he had strived for perfection in every aspect of his life.

Yet now, it felt like everything was crumbling—his marriage, his family, even his own judgment.

"Ms. Carter was incredible! So calm under pressure. When Old Master Reginald collapsed, she didn't hesitate—just took out those needles and stabilized him within seconds. I've never seen anything like it. She's as skilled as his personal physician!"

Nathan's grip tightened on the steering wheel as the servant's words replayed in his mind.

He should have realized sooner. Evelyn had medical expertise.

She had saved Reginald. She had treated the hotel employee's seizure. And back when they were still married, she had eased his own migraines with those same steady hands.

She had given so much—quietly, selflessly—fulfilling her role as his wife with unwavering dedication.

So why had he only seen her as irritating? As insincere?

The realization struck like a physical blow. He had been blind to her virtues, obsessed with faults that existed only in his own stubborn perception.

His left hand pressed against his chest, as if he could physically suppress the ache spreading there.

Looking back, Nathan saw the truth with painful clarity: he had wasted years on Victoria. She had been his greatest mistake.

And to Evelyn? He was no better than Victoria.

When Reginald heard his grandson was coming, he waited eagerly in the sitting room, his weathered face alight with rare joy.

He had never voiced his affection openly, but his love for Nathan was undeniable. Why else would he have fought so hard to secure Nathan's position as CEO of Blackwood Industries?

Some bonds ran deeper than words.
###Chapter 308

"Grandfather, how have you been these past few days? You must tell me if you feel unwell."

Nathan knelt on one knee in front of Reginald’s wheelchair, his clear, youthful eyes filled with concern. "Why don’t you come stay with me at Cliffside Manor? Agnes and I can take good care of you."

"Why would I return to that prison?" Reginald scoffed, his expression darkening at the thought of Leonard and his foolish wife. "I’d die faster if I had to see your father and that wretched Penelope every day."

Just the mention of her name made his head throb. He exhaled sharply, shaking his head. "I swore I wouldn’t set foot in Cliffside Manor again until Leonard divorces her. Besides, I prefer it here. This place is my fountain of youth—out of sight, out of mind!"

Nathan’s lips curled into a helpless smile. His grandfather’s stubbornness was legendary, and there was no arguing with him once his mind was made up.

"This villa was Master Reginald and Madam Margaret’s love nest," Marcus explained with a knowing smile. "He stays here because it still carries traces of her presence. That’s why he refuses to leave."

"Marcus, perhaps I truly am growing senile," Reginald murmured, his gaze drifting toward the garden with a wistful expression. "Sometimes, I see things. Once, I even thought I saw Margaret singing among the flowers. When I approached, she turned and smiled at me."

"You’re not senile, Master Reginald," Marcus said gently. "Madam Margaret must have felt how deeply you’ve missed her all these years. She couldn’t bear to leave you either, so she stays by your side."

Nathan’s throat tightened. He lowered his head, guilt gnawing at him.

He had always known how deeply his grandparents had loved each other. Their marriage had been his ideal—a bond so strong and beautiful that he had chased after it desperately with Victoria.

But along the way, he had ignored the signs. Their personalities clashed. Their conversations were shallow. More often than not, he was the one bending over backward to please her.

Yet, he had been too afraid to let go, terrified that all his efforts would be wasted if he admitted the truth.

In the end, he had failed spectacularly—and worse, he had hurt someone who had truly cared for him.

He had been a fool.

"I’m sorry, Grandfather." Nathan’s long lashes trembled, his voice barely above a whisper.

Reginald studied his grandson—proud, brilliant, and now weighed down by regret. He sighed heavily and patted Nathan’s shoulder. "You’re as stubborn as I was at your age. But I was luckier—I loved the right person. You weren’t as fortunate."

A faint smile tugged at his lips. "But at least you stepped back before making the same mistake twice. That’s worth celebrating."

"Grandfather, I—"

"No, the fault is mine too," Reginald interrupted firmly. "I shouldn’t have forced you to be with Evelyn. From now on, I won’t interfere. It’s unfair to her to be tied to someone who doesn’t love her."

His expression turned serious as he turned to Marcus. "Tomorrow, compile a list of eligible bachelors for me. I want to vet them thoroughly so I can introduce them to Evelyn when she’s ready. Divorced or not, I won’t let her future be dictated by it. Otherwise, I’ll never rest in peace!"

"Ah—yes, sir," Marcus stammered, momentarily stunned.

Nathan’s fingers clenched involuntarily. The memory of Alexander Whitmore presenting Evelyn with roses under the sunset flashed through his mind.

A sharp, sour pang twisted in his chest.

After speaking with Reginald a while longer, Nathan left the villa.

"Master Reginald," Marcus ventured cautiously once they were alone, "you’ve always wanted Young Master Nathan to reconcile with Ms. Carter. Why arrange introductions for her now?"

A sly grin spread across Reginald’s face. "I know my grandson better than anyone. If I push him toward Evelyn, he’ll only resist harder."

His eyes gleamed with cunning. "Men are possessive by nature. We thrive on challenge. Only when he feels threatened will he finally admit what he truly wants."
###Chapter 309

The storm had finally passed.

Evelyn's clever manipulation of Dominic Reeves had set off a chain reaction that completely dismantled the Sterling Corporation.

Though Blackwood Industries suffered collateral damage, Nathan hadn't married Victoria yet. Most saw him as a victim rather than a fool in this twisted game.

In the general manager's office, Evelyn idly played a video game while Theodore peeled grapes for her, updating her on recent developments.

"Mr. Raymond mentioned that Margaret is going to trial soon," Theodore said, placing a juicy grape between her lips. "No reputable lawyer will take her case—the evidence is overwhelming. She's looking at twenty years, at least."

Evelyn swallowed the grape, licking her lips with satisfaction. "Mmm, so sweet!"

Theodore smiled. She was the sweet one.

"He should've called me himself," Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "Raymond always overthinks things."

Her youngest brother, Raymond, was just like Arabella—too considerate, too burdened by their family name.

Despite being only three years older than Evelyn, Raymond had always doted on her as much as Sebastian, Dominic, Maxwell, and Donovan.

"Mr. Raymond has his insecurities," Theodore observed. "He doesn’t want to smother you."

Evelyn scoffed. "He’s family. To me, he’s no different from the others."

"Oh, and Dominic Reeves is in lockup now," Theodore added, his expression darkening. "Mr. Dominic and Mr. Raymond made sure to arrest several loan sharks and casino thugs to keep him company."

Evelyn smirked. "How thoughtful. I’ll cook them a feast tomorrow as thanks."

"The Sterlings’ debts are nearly cleared," Theodore continued.

Evelyn’s fingers paused mid-air. "Nathan paid them off? How generous of him."

"Not Nathan. Penelope."

Evelyn’s lips pursed.

"That’s odd," Theodore mused. "Victoria’s reputation is ruined—she’s useless to Penelope now. Why would she bail them out?"

"Victoria must have dirt on her," Evelyn said, eyes glinting. "After years of scheming together, do you really think Victoria doesn’t know Penelope’s secrets? Penelope had no choice."

Theodore fed her another grape. "Victoria left her father in the hospital and fled the country. She didn’t even care about her daughter. I followed your instructions—the girl’s in one of Monarch Group’s sponsored orphanages now."

"What a pity," Evelyn murmured.

"Pity?"

"That Victoria and Nathan didn’t marry. They deserve each other."

As she exited the game, a friend request popped up—a high-level player named Rose.

Evelyn didn’t think much of it. As the top-ranked Lucifer, she got dozens of requests daily. But the name Rose caught her eye.

She accepted.
###Chapter 310

The notification pinged on Evelyn's screen as she was wrapping up her work.

[Victoria: Fancy a quick match before you log off?]

[Alexander: Actually heading out now. Rain check?]

[Victoria: How about coffee at the Monarch Grand's lobby café instead?]

Ten minutes later, Evelyn stepped into the serene café on the third floor.

The space was unusually empty. Alexander Whitmore sat alone by the panoramic windows, his silhouette gilded by the golden sunset. The light caught the sharp angles of his profile, making him look almost ethereal.

"Mr. Whitmore."

Evelyn approached, her heels clicking softly against the marble. "When did you arrive? You should've come straight to my office."

"I heard you were swamped today." He turned with a lazy smile, removing his glasses. "Didn't want to interrupt. Just got back to Crestview and thought I'd wait here until you finished."

His phone screen lit up as he tilted it toward her. "Logged into the game and saw you online. Figured I'd shoot my shot."

"Let me get you a drink. My treat."

Evelyn felt a pang of guilt. His thoughtfulness was almost disarming—showing up unannounced yet considerate enough not to disrupt her schedule.

"Actually..." Alexander leaned back, the leather couch creaking softly. "I'm on my fourth espresso. But I wouldn't say no to dinner." His smile turned playful. "Haven't had proper Crestview cuisine since I left for Serenia. Indulge me?"

She couldn't refuse—not when he'd waited so patiently. "Of course. The Monarch's chef does an incredible braised lamb shank."

Evelyn signaled Theodore to prepare their finest private dining room.

Dinner flowed effortlessly between shared laughs and easy conversation. Alexander had a way of making even mundane topics sparkle with wit.

Outside, Theodore lingered by the door, jaw tight. The sound of Evelyn's laughter—bright and unguarded—twisted something in his chest.

He distrusted Nathan Blackwood, but Alexander unsettled him more.

It wasn't jealousy. Theodore respected Evelyn's autonomy completely.

But some people carried shadows beneath their charm. Alexander's smiles were too polished, his arrivals too unpredictable. Even Evelyn couldn't anticipate his movements.

That man was a storm wrapped in velvet.

"The lamb was exquisite." Alexander dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin. "Though I'd expect nothing less from Monarch's kitchens. Thank you for this, Evelyn."

"My pleasure. I've owed you since the incident at the gala." Her voice softened. "You saved my life that night."

His fingers brushed hers as he reached for his wineglass. "And a single dinner settles that debt?"

Alexander tilted forward suddenly, close enough that Evelyn caught the faint scent of sandalwood. Moonlight through the windows turned his eyes to liquid silver.

Her breath hitched.

Then two tickets materialized in his palm.

"Sebastian Laurent's debut Crestview concert." His thumb traced the embossed date. "Tonight at seven. Join me?"

Evelyn blinked. The request—delivered with that disarming smile—felt like a chess move disguised as courtesy.

Alexander held perfectly still, watching her. When he spoke again, his voice was a low murmur. "You wouldn't deny your rescuer this small favor, would you, Ms. Carter?"

The question hung between them, threaded with unspoken challenge.
###Chapter 311

Nathan Blackwood reclined in his executive chair, the leather creaking softly beneath him as he massaged his temples. The high-level meeting had drained him, leaving behind only exhaustion in his piercing gaze.

The whispers about him and Victoria Sterling had spread like wildfire through Blackwood Industries. Yet, within the towering glass walls of the corporate empire, not a single employee dared to breathe a word about their CEO.

Unless they had a death wish.

Now the newly appointed Vice Chairman, Nathan wielded unprecedented power. But despite his elevated status, a heavy weight settled in his chest—no satisfaction, only relentless tension.

"I never expected Penelope to settle Gold Corporation's financial issues so smoothly," Oliver Sinclair remarked, satisfaction lacing his tone. "She's been hoarding money for years. At least now she'll have to cough it up."

Nathan's fingers stilled against his temple. "Penelope built her fortune with Vincent Whitmore's help. Even with him behind bars, she still has deep pockets. That means she has another source."

Oliver frowned. "Could Éclat Boutique be involved? How could a mediocre boutique generate that kind of profit? It's just clothes and accessories."

Nathan's sharp gaze cut to him. "After all these years working for me, how are you still this naive?"

With a flick of his wrist, Nathan sent a folded document sailing across the desk, landing squarely against Oliver's chest. "That boutique is just a front. Penelope has spent years building an underground network in Crestview. On the surface, it's luxury goods. Behind the scenes? Bribery. Corruption."

A chill ran down Oliver's spine. "We severely underestimated that witch."

"I never underestimated her," Nathan said coldly. "Underestimating your enemy is the quickest way to lose."

He exhaled, rubbing his temples again. "Taking Penelope down isn't a one-night job. Her roots run deep in Crestview, and with Leonard protecting her, we need more evidence. More leverage. Move too soon, and we'll burn with her. The right moment will come."

Oliver clenched his jaw. "Sooner or later, we'll make that witch pay in blood."

Nathan shifted topics abruptly. "What's the status on Isabella Wang's project?"

"The wedding proposal has been finalized. We're ready to meet with her team whenever," Oliver reported.

He hesitated before adding carefully, "Mr. Blackwood… didn't you mention compensating Ms. Carter? This could be an opportunity to make amends. What if we handed the wedding planning rights to Monarch Grand Hotels? She might appreciate—"

Nathan cut him off. "Why would I give it to Monarch?"

His expression darkened. "I owe Evelyn, not the Kingsleys. Why should I hand them an opportunity?"

Oliver fell silent. His boss's logic was… unique.

"She once said in business, we should never hold back when competing against her." Nathan's lips curled slightly. "If I go easy now, wouldn't that be an insult?"

He leaned back, his voice cool. "Prepare as planned. In business, I don't compromise my standards for anyone. I'm not Alexander Whitmore."

Oliver blinked. Was that… jealousy?

The phone on the desk buzzed. Julian Montgomery's name flashed on the screen.

Nathan answered, tone flat. "What?"

Julian's excited voice crackled through. "Nathan! I scored VIP tickets to Sebastian Laurent's concert tonight. You're coming with me!"

"You? At a piano recital?" Nathan scoffed. "Since when do donkeys appreciate classical music?"

Julian laughed. "If I can understand your insults, why not a piano recital?"

He dropped his voice conspiratorially. "Besides, Isabelle just got back from Valmont. She's Sebastian's star pupil and performing as a guest tonight. I wanted to surprise you, but you ruined it. Thought you'd appreciate the romantic gesture."

Nathan's expression soured. "I'm allergic to romance."

"Come on! You've been brooding since Evelyn left. You need a distraction."

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. "Don't associate Victoria with me anymore. It's disgusting."

"Fine, fine," Julian sighed. "But you're still coming. I'll pick you up in an hour."

Nathan hung up without another word.

The office fell silent again, heavy with unspoken tension.

Outside, the city lights of Crestview glittered—beautiful, cold, and indifferent.

Just like the man sitting in the dark.
###Chapter 312

Isabelle Montgomery was Julian's younger sister. She had been a constant presence in Nathan Blackwood's life since childhood, practically growing up under his watchful gaze.

Julian was more than just an older brother—he played the role of both sibling and guardian. His devotion to his only sister knew no bounds, surpassing even the Kingsley brothers' affection for Evelyn.

After a brief hesitation, Nathan finally relented. "Fine, pick me up."

Night descended upon the Crestview National Music Hall not long after.

Julian had secured a VIP box on the second floor well in advance, ensuring the perfect vantage point to witness his sister's brilliance. Not content with just that, he had also arranged professional camera equipment, meticulously adjusting the angles to capture every moment of her performance.

Seated nearby, Nathan crossed his legs, casting a disdainful glance at Julian, who was now more engrossed in his camera than a seasoned paparazzo.

Unimpressed, Nathan remarked, "The organizers will document the entire performance and even produce commemorative discs for the performers. Don’t embarrass yourself with your amateur efforts."

Julian shot back, "A heartless man like you wouldn’t understand! Footage captured by a loving brother is infused with emotion. How could it compare to some sterile official recording?"

Just as Julian adjusted the lens, his eyes widened in surprise. "Damn! Evelyn is here too. Did I miss something? And who the hell is that guy beside her? Why is he so pale? Is he sick?"

Nathan’s pulse quickened as he rushed to the railing. Across the hall, in another VIP box, Evelyn and Alexander Whitmore were deep in conversation, exchanging smiles as if lost in their own world.

Unaware of the intense scrutiny, Evelyn shivered slightly in the chilly air-conditioned hall. Her emerald-green evening gown offered little warmth, and tiny goosebumps prickled her arms.

Alexander noticed immediately. Without a word, he removed his suit jacket and knelt before her.

"Alexander, what are you doing?" Evelyn’s eyes widened in surprise.

He draped the jacket over her slender legs. "If your legs are warm, you won’t feel as cold."

Then, with a charming smile, he added, "I considered offering you the jacket, but your dress is far too stunning. You look like a siren from Greek mythology—it would be a crime to hide your beauty."

Evelyn’s toes curled in her heels, flustered by his boldness. Men in Serenia were certainly direct. No wonder Camille had fallen for her husband!

Meanwhile, Nathan’s grip on the railing tightened until his knuckles turned white. The sight of Alexander kneeling before Evelyn sent a surge of frustration through him. The veins in his hands stood out starkly against his skin.

A single question burned in his mind—what exactly was the nature of Evelyn’s relationship with Alexander?

"Who the hell is that guy?" Nathan muttered through clenched teeth.

Julian, who had once harbored feelings for Evelyn, couldn’t help but scowl. Even though she had rejected him outright, seeing another man by her side still stung.

"He’s clearly a wolf in sheep’s clothing," Julian grumbled. "And look at how pale he is—does he moonlight as a vampire?"

Nathan’s gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, his voice icy. "That’s Victor Whitmore’s youngest son, Alexander."

Julian blinked in surprise. "The Whitmores? Why don’t I remember him?"

"He spent over a decade in Serenia and only recently returned to Crestview," Nathan explained.

"The Whitmores are a formidable family," Julian mused, narrowing his eyes at Nathan’s tense expression. "Seems like the competition for Evelyn’s attention is heating up."

He smirked. "You know what they say—even the mightiest oak can bend in a storm. You’ve got two choices: retreat gracefully or fight like hell. Your call."

Nathan inhaled sharply, jaw clenched. "Just shut up."
###Chapter 313

The concert hall lights dimmed.

World-renowned pianist Sebastian Laurent took the stage with effortless grace. His tailored navy velvet tuxedo shimmered under the spotlights as he seated himself before the gleaming grand piano. The opening notes of his signature composition "Whispers of the Seasons" filled the auditorium.

A hush fell over the captivated audience as the haunting melody wove its magic. Yet Evelyn Carter's attention remained fixed on Sebastian's exquisite attire.

That distinctive navy suit was a one-of-a-kind masterpiece from Éclat Boutique's exclusive collection. Designed personally by international fashion icon Rosalind Walker, these creations were reserved only for those of exceptional talent and reputation.

Nathan Blackwood sat rigidly through the performance, his jaw clenched so tightly his temples throbbed. Though he maintained perfect composure, his knuckles whitened with restrained tension.

Throughout the concert, his gaze kept drifting back to Evelyn. She looked breathtaking tonight, and every graceful movement she made only deepened his irritation.

When Alexander Whitmore leaned close to whisper something in Evelyn's ear, Nathan's grip on the armrests tightened until the wood creaked. The way Evelyn's eyes sparkled with amusement at whatever Alexander said made Nathan's stomach twist.

What could they possibly be discussing so intimately? After three years of marriage, why did she have more to say to this man than she ever had for him?

Julian Montgomery shivered suddenly. "Damn, did they crank up the AC?" he muttered, rubbing his arms.

After several breathtaking pieces, the spotlight shifted to Isabelle Montgomery, Sebastian's protégé. The young pianist floated onto stage in an emerald chiffon gown adorned with delicate silk blossoms, looking every bit the woodland nymph.

Julian immediately perked up, waving enthusiastically. "Belle! Over here! Your big brother's watching!"

Nathan shot him a glare that could freeze lava. He seriously considered pushing Julian off the balcony.

On stage, Isabelle remained blissfully unaware of her brother's antics. With moonbeam radiance, she offered the audience a graceful curtsy before settling at the piano.

Her performance of Mozart's "Rondo Alla Turca" flowed like liquid silk beneath her nimble fingers. Evelyn watched with visible admiration, though a shadow of something darker flickered in her eyes.

Her left hand rested on her lap, fingers unconsciously mirroring the lively melody with perfect precision. Even her once-paralyzed pinky seemed to regain momentary life.

Alexander noticed the subtle movement. "I remember how brilliantly you played as a child," he murmured. "Had you pursued music, you'd undoubtedly surpass Isabelle's skill today."

Evelyn's fingers stilled abruptly. "That life is gone," she said firmly, clenching her hand into a fist.

The injury from Eldermere battlefield - carrying Nathan's unconscious body through enemy fire - had severed tendons in her left hand. Countless surgeries and rehabilitation had restored partial function, but her piano dreams had died that day.

Yet Evelyn regretted nothing. She hadn't saved Nathan the man, but a fellow peacekeeper. Her scars weren't reminders of past mistakes, but medals of honor.

As the final notes faded, Sebastian and Isabelle took their bows amidst thunderous applause.

"Evelyn, would you join me backstage?" Alexander asked with a charming smile.

"Is something wrong?"

"A personal favor. My mother adores Maestro Laurent. I was hoping to request an autographed album."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Sebastian's notoriously selective with admirers."

Alexander's smile deepened. "Sincerity moves mountains. If I can just speak with him directly..."

Meanwhile, Julian practically bounced down the corridor, arms overflowing with flowers for his sister. Nathan followed stiffly, his expression stormy.

They turned a corner - and froze. Evelyn and Alexander approached from the opposite direction. The spacious hallway suddenly felt claustrophobically small.
###Chapter 314

The air crackled with tension. Evelyn Carter froze mid-step when her gaze collided with Nathan Blackwood's piercing stare. A delicate frown creased her forehead.

Alexander Whitmore adjusted his designer glasses, his expression shifting to one of mild discomfort.

"Evelyn, I had no idea he'd be here," Alexander murmured, his voice laced with apology. "We should go. Forget the autograph."

A careless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Don't be ridiculous. Since when do we detour around ex-husbands?" Her eyes sparkled with quiet determination. "Mrs. Whitmore deserves that autograph. We're not leaving."

Alexander's sharp intake of breath was audible. He studied Evelyn with newfound admiration. Across the room, Nathan's jaw clenched visibly.

The distance between them was negligible—every word carried. Though their divorce was finalized, Nathan found himself inexplicably drawn to her. The way she spoke of Alexander's mother ignited something primal within him. He needed to know—how close had she grown to Alexander?

Logic warred with impulse. Approaching her would be foolish. Yet his feet moved of their own accord.

The dressing room door burst open.

"Nathan!"

A petite figure in emerald green launched herself at him. Isabelle Montgomery—Julian's younger sister—wrapped herself around Nathan like ivy. Her flushed cheeks pressed against his chest as she giggled. "You came to see me perform! Is this my surprise?"

Nathan's entire body stiffened. His gaze darted to Evelyn, but Julian remained oblivious, chuckling at his sister's antics. To him, this was merely childhood familiarity.

He failed to recognize the inappropriateness—Isabelle was twenty-two, no longer a child, and certainly not Nathan's blood relative.

Especially not with Evelyn watching.

"Come on, Nathan! Hug me properly!" Isabelle's arms tightened around his waist. She tilted her face up, lips puckered in a pout.

Nathan stood like marble, unresponsive.

His attention never wavered from Evelyn. Isabelle followed his gaze, her smile faltering when she spotted the breathtaking woman nearby. Envy darkened her eyes.

"Zoe," Julian teased, "forgetting your real brother now that Nathan's here?" He spread his arms dramatically. "Where's my hug?"

"You have fan clubs for that," Isabelle retorted. Her fingers crept toward Nathan's jawline. "Julian's too predictable. I prefer Nathan—mysterious and brooding. Exactly my type."

Nathan recoiled from her touch.

Then he saw it—Evelyn was walking toward him.

Every muscle in his body tensed. His pulse roared in his ears like a freight train.
###Chapter 315

Evelyn tilted her chin up gracefully, her piercing gaze locked onto Nathan as she moved toward him.

At that moment, every pulse of his blood seemed to rush toward his heart. His throat constricted, muscles tensing further, as if his entire body was screaming at him to reach for her.

Isabelle, noticing Nathan's reaction, tightened her grip on his arm possessively. A surge of jealousy flared within her. This woman wasn't just familiar to Nathan—she meant something to him.

Just as Nathan thought Evelyn was coming for him, she glided past like a whisper of wind, leaving him frozen in place.

"Alexander!" Evelyn called out, her voice warm and bright, ignoring Nathan completely.

"Oh! Darling!" Sebastian Laurent, walking down the corridor, lit up at the sight of Evelyn. He embraced her with the enthusiasm of reuniting with a long-lost friend, kissing her cheeks affectionately. Their closeness was undeniable.

The entire group—Nathan, Julian, and Isabelle—stared in stunned silence.

Having been Sebastian's protégé for years, Isabelle knew him as a reserved, often aloof man who rarely showed warmth.

How had this woman effortlessly drawn such rare affection from him?

"My dear, I had no idea you were in Crestview! If I'd known, I would've canceled everything to dine with you!" Sebastian beamed, his hands resting on Evelyn's shoulders.

"You have rehearsals to focus on. I wouldn’t dream of disturbing you." Evelyn replied in flawless French, her tone soft and intimate, as if it were her native tongue.

Evelyn had befriended Sebastian under her alias, Sharon, designing custom gowns for him. She had a way of turning collaborators into lifelong friends.

Nathan watched, memories flooding back. His shoulders tensed as his world tilted on its axis.

He remembered the early days of their marriage—how Evelyn’s eyes used to sparkle like Isabelle’s, how she’d chatter excitedly about little things.

But he had ignored her, dismissing her as uninteresting. Slowly, she became quieter, fading into the background of Cliffside Manor.

He had thought her dull, comparing her unfavorably to Victoria. He’d believed marrying her was a mistake.

Yet now, he realized—he had nearly destroyed her.

His neglect had turned her into a shadow of herself, her love for him sinking like the Titanic.

"Mr. Whitmore, over here!" Evelyn’s eyes gleamed as she spotted Alexander beyond Nathan. She waved at him with a radiant smile.

Alexander hastily straightened his tie and strode toward her, his usual composure slipping into visible eagerness.

Nathan’s fingers clenched, bitterness clawing at his chest, while Julian seethed beside him.

As Alexander passed Nathan, he paused. Adjusting his glasses, he shot Nathan a smirk—a victor’s taunt.

That mocking gaze was a knife, twisting in Nathan’s heart. Helpless, he watched Alexander take his place beside Evelyn.

Was this all he could do? Stand by as another man stepped into the life he’d thrown away?

With effortless charm, Evelyn introduced Alexander to Sebastian.

"Sebastian, this is my dear friend, Alexander. His mother adores your work—he’d love a signed album for her."

"Of course! It would be my pleasure!" Sebastian agreed warmly, summoning his manager for a photo.

As the trio posed, Nathan’s chest ached. The scene was a cruel reminder of what he’d lost—and what he could never reclaim.
###Chapter 316

The concert hall doors swung open, and Isabelle Montgomery clung to Nathan Blackwood's arm like she used to as a child.

She chattered excitedly about her time abroad, her voice laced with longing for him.

The only difference now was that in the past, she would hold Nathan's hand with her left and her brother Julian's with her right. But tonight, Julian had been demoted to a mere bag carrier—completely forgotten. Her entire focus was on Nathan.

Julian trailed behind them, his lips pressed into a thin line. With Evelyn Carter absent and his sister ignoring him, Crestview's most notorious playboy was starting to feel irrelevant.

When they reached the parking lot, Nathan suddenly stopped. He inhaled sharply and firmly pulled his arm from Isabelle's grip.

"Nathan?" Isabelle blinked up at him, her small hand hovering in the air.

"Isabelle."

Nathan turned to face her, his expression stern. Gone was the warmth he'd once shown her as a child. His gaze was distant, sending an uncomfortable chill down her spine.

"You're a young woman now, not a little girl. Certain behaviors between us are no longer appropriate."

"Why not? You're like a second brother to me!" Isabelle protested, anxiety creeping into her voice. "What's wrong with a sister holding her brother's hand?"

"Julian is your real brother. I'm not." Nathan's tone was final. He didn't elaborate further.

Isabelle pouted, her innocent facade barely masking the simmering anger beneath. She couldn't shake the suspicion that Nathan's sudden coldness was because of that stunning woman from earlier.

After Rosalind Walker's failure, Isabelle had rushed back to Crestview when Nathan was at his loneliest, determined to claim his heart. She wouldn't let some random woman ruin years of careful planning.

"Nathan, that was cruel," Julian interjected, unable to stand seeing his sister upset. He pulled her into a protective embrace. "You watched Isabelle grow up. You used to carry her everywhere—holding hands now shouldn't be an issue. Besides, you're single. Save the boundaries for when you have a wife."

"Isabelle will have a boyfriend someday. Her hands should be reserved for him." Nathan exhaled deeply. Unbidden, Evelyn's words flashed through his mind: My hands should be reserved for my woman to hold.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter slid into her Rolls-Royce after parting ways with Alexander Whitmore.

Achoo!

The concert hall's air conditioning must have been too cold—she sneezed three times in rapid succession.

"Ms. Carter, are you coming down with something? I'll prepare medicine and ginger tea when we get back," Theodore Winslow fretted, handing her a tissue.

Evelyn dabbed at her nose, the tip already turning pink. "It's nothing. Probably someone talking about me behind my back."

"Who would've thought we'd run into that bastard Nathan at a concert," Theodore grumbled, taking the used tissue without hesitation.

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face as she recalled Isabelle clinging to Nathan, touching him so freely.

That despicable man indulges her childish flirtations. He probably enjoys it.

She had known Isabelle was Julian's sister, but Nathan's connection to her—and their level of intimacy—was news to her. Evelyn scoffed, shaking her head. Three years of marriage, and she still knew so little about that man.

"The scoundrel isn't satisfied with two sisters—he's collecting more. How vulgar."

"Ms. Carter?" Theodore frowned. "What did you say?"

"Nothing. Just casting a spell to ward off the bad luck from encountering that bastard." Evelyn crossed her arms and leaned back, closing her eyes.

Seconds later, her phone rang. Sebastian Kingsley's name flashed on the screen.

"Sebastian?"

"Evelyn, don't leave right after work the day after tomorrow. I'll pick you up at the hotel—we're going back to Fairhaven."

"Fairhaven?" Her pulse spiked. "Is Dad okay?"

"Dad's fine." Sebastian's voice softened. "Uncle Victor is bringing his sons for dinner. Dad wants all of us there. They've been friends for twenty years—he doesn't want to slight them."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Alright."
###Chapter 317

The silver moon hung heavy in the ink-black sky, its glow swallowing every trace of starlight.

The sleek Maybach rolled to a stop outside Cliffside Manor. Nathan Blackwood stepped out alone, his voice clipped as he dismissed the driver.

"Take Oliver back. I'll walk in myself. No need to follow."

"But, Mr. Blackwood," Oliver Sinclair protested, concern knitting his brow. "The storm's coming. I heard thunder on the drive. It's a long walk from the gates to the main house—"

"I said no."

Nathan's jaw was set, his fingers absently loosening his silk tie. "I need air. Leave."

The car disappeared into the night, tires whispering against wet pavement.

Nathan inhaled sharply, the crisp night air doing nothing to ease the weight in his chest. Three steps in, the heavens split open.

Rain fell in sheets, drenching him before he could react. By the time he staggered through the grand foyer, water streamed from his hair, his clothes clinging to his frame like a second skin.

Agnes Thornton gasped, rushing forward with a towel. "Good heavens! Young Master! Where's the car? Where's Oliver?"

Nathan didn't answer. Droplets slid down his pale face, his usually immaculate black hair plastered to his forehead. His shirt, once crisp and white, was now translucent, revealing the hard lines of his torso beneath.

"Agnes." His voice was raw. "Bring me a bottle. Anything strong."

"You're shivering! I'll make ginger tea—"

"Wine. Now."

She studied him, her sharp eyes missing nothing. "What happened?"

His throat worked. "I saw Evelyn tonight."

Agnes brightened momentarily before Nathan's next words turned her blood cold.

"She wasn't alone."

"Who—?"

"She has a lover." The admission tore from him, each syllable laced with something perilously close to agony.

Agnes inhaled sharply. "Already? Well, I suppose that's no surprise. Lady Evelyn is exquisite—kind, brilliant, from an impeccable family. Even divorced, she'd have suitors lining up for miles."

"Remarry?" The word hit Nathan like a physical blow, his vision swimming crimson at the edges.

"Is that why you're like this?" Agnes pressed, her grip firm on his sodden shoulders. "Drowning yourself in rain and liquor because another man holds what was once yours?"

"I don't—" Nathan raked shaking fingers through his hair.

"Listen to me," Agnes said fiercely. "If you're just possessive, get over it. But if you truly want her—even now, even after everything—then fight. At least you won't die wondering. And she's worth fighting for."

Nathan's chest constricted. With every denial that rose in his throat, the ache behind his ribs grew sharper, more insistent.

Meanwhile, across town, Isabelle Montgomery adjusted the strap of her silk slip dress, surveying her reflection with satisfaction.

After graduating top of her class at Valmont's Royal Conservatory, she'd turned down a coveted position with the Valmont Philharmonic. Crestview might lack Valmont's cultural prestige, but it held something far more valuable.

Nathan Blackwood.

Her brother Julian's recent confirmation that Nathan had permanently severed ties with Victoria Sterling had reignited Isabelle's ambitions. Tonight, she'd invited Cassandra Blackwood over—step one in her carefully orchestrated campaign.

Isabelle smirked, running a manicured finger along the rim of her champagne flute. Arrogance came naturally to her; beauty and talent had ensured she'd never known rejection. The women of Crestview's elite circles? Mere stepping stones.

The game was afoot.
###Chapter 318

Yet, Isabelle Montgomery was exceptionally close to Cassandra Blackwood, driven by one simple reason - Cassandra belonged to the prestigious Blackwood family.

In Isabelle's eyes, only those from elite families like the Blackwoods deserved her friendship.

"Oh Cassandra, you look absolutely stunning today! And you brought gifts? How incredibly thoughtful of you!" Isabelle greeted Cassandra at the door with a dazzling smile. The two embraced like long-lost sisters, their hands clasped tightly.

"Isabelle! I've missed you terribly! You've grown even more beautiful since our last meeting!" Cassandra showered her with compliments while carefully concealing her true intentions.

Knowing Julian Montgomery's deep affection for his younger sister, befriending Isabelle would give Cassandra the perfect excuse to visit the Montgomery estate frequently.

Cassandra planned to subtly win Isabelle over. If Isabelle spoke highly of her to Julian, she could quickly ascend to become the future Mrs. Montgomery.

The cunning in Cassandra's heart was truly remarkable.

"During my recent European tour, I picked up some souvenirs. I got something special for you and Mrs. Montgomery. They're just small tokens, I hope you won't be disappointed."

Isabelle eyed the mountain of luxury gift boxes, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "Did you get something for my brother too?"

"Yes...but I was worried he might not like it and would refuse it." Cassandra blushed, lowering her head demurely.

"Oh my! Look at you blushing like a schoolgirl at the mere mention of him!" Isabelle teased playfully. "Leave it to me. He'll accept anything I give him."

"Thank you so much, Isabelle! You're absolutely wonderful!" Overjoyed, Cassandra immediately retrieved Julian's gift.

Isabelle took the exquisite velvet box and opened it to reveal a platinum tie pin with sapphire accents - clearly an expensive piece.

Just then, Julian descended the grand staircase wearing a custom YSL purple suit with a rose-patterned silk shirt. His ethereal elegance and noble bearing made him seem almost otherworldly.

Cassandra stared at her idol with undisguised admiration, her mouth slightly agape.

"Julian!" Isabelle called sweetly to her brother.

Julian's indulgent smile for his sister instantly turned frosty when he noticed Cassandra. "Ms. Blackwood, to what do we owe this visit?"

"I...I..." Cassandra stammered nervously.

"Julian, I invited Cassandra over," Isabelle said, wrapping an arm around Cassandra's shoulders. "We've been best friends forever, didn't you know? She's my closest companion in Crestview."

"Is that so? I wasn't aware." Julian arched an eyebrow, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Isabelle, I don't object to you making friends, but choose wisely. Some friends elevate you, while others drag you down."

Isabelle subtly glanced at Cassandra, who had turned pale with humiliation.

"I know what I'm doing, Julian. I'm twenty-two, not a child! Don't you think I can tell good people from bad?" Isabelle retorted calmly.

"Since you haven't spent much time in Crestview these past years, if you truly want companionship, I could introduce you to Ms. Evelyn Carter. She's the beautiful lady you saw last night." Julian's voice softened noticeably when mentioning Evelyn. "Coincidentally, she's acquainted with your mentor, Sebastian Laurent. You'd have much in common."

Isabelle inwardly scoffed at the suggestion. The absurdity! Befriending her romantic rival?

As Julian moved to pinch his sister's cheek affectionately before leaving, Isabelle seized the moment to thrust the gift into his hands.

"Julian, this is something Cassandra specially picked for you. She put her heart into it, so you must accept it properly," Isabelle said, blinking her large, innocent eyes at him.

Julian took the box without comment and strode away with effortless grace.

"See? I told you. If it comes from me, he'll never refuse," Isabelle boasted, hands on her hips.

Cassandra was so moved that tears welled in her eyes as she gazed gratefully at Isabelle.

Julian reached the doorway, his expression unreadable.

He glanced coldly at the delicate box, not even bothering to open it. Raising his arm, he seemed ready to toss it away carelessly.

Then, remembering his sister's words, he spotted his female secretary by the car. A smirk played on his lips as he flicked the box toward her.

The secretary caught it hastily, confusion written across her face. "Mr. Montgomery, what's this?"

"A gift for you."

She opened it and frowned. "But sir, this is a men's tie clip. I don't even have a boyfriend. What would I do with it?"

Julian waved impatiently. "Give it to your father then. Or use it as a paperweight. I couldn't care less what you do with it."
###Chapter 319

With Julian Montgomery away and Mrs. Montgomery still recuperating overseas, Cassandra Blackwood's plan to gain favor hit a temporary roadblock. Still, the mere thought of Julian accepting her gift sent her pulse racing. Sleep would be elusive tonight.

That afternoon, beneath the sprawling oak tree in the Montgomery estate's garden, the two women indulged in tea while admiring the autumn foliage.

"Isabelle, when did you meet Evelyn?" Cassandra's voice carried a sharp edge, laced with thinly veiled resentment.

"I ran into her backstage after my piano recital the other day," Isabelle replied airily, crossing her legs as she took a sip of Earl Grey.

Her gaze flicked to Cassandra, sharp and assessing. "Judging by your tone, you have quite the grudge against her."

"Grudge?" Cassandra scoffed, her fingers tightening around her cup. "It's more like an all-out war."

"That serious?"

"You've been abroad too long, Isabelle. There's so much you don't know." Cassandra's lips curled into a sneer. "Evelyn is a master manipulator—pulling Nathan's and Julian's strings like puppets. She's turned everything upside down!"

"The Blackwood family is in complete disarray because of her!"

"What? My brother is interested in her too?" Isabelle's expression darkened.

"Julian was ensnared by that witch! She has a way with men—a born seductress!" Cassandra's cheeks flushed with fury. "Luckily, they're not as close now. I suppose she's already moved on to her next victim."

"Julian doesn't fall for just anyone. He's the one who plays with women, not the other way around." Isabelle smirked. "Evelyn was probably just another fleeting fling. He never keeps the same woman twice. She's disposable. Trust me, I know him better than anyone."

Noticing Cassandra's distress, Isabelle softened her tone, offering a reassuring smile.

"But you, Cassandra, are different. Our families have strong ties. With my help, you'll win Julian over."

Cassandra nearly teared up. "Oh, Isabelle! You're such a true friend!" She felt as though happiness was finally within reach.

"By the way," Isabelle leaned in, her voice lowering, "what's the deal between Evelyn and Nathan? That's what concerns me most."

Cassandra's fists clenched. "Just mentioning it makes my blood boil! She's his ex-wife!"

"What?!" Isabelle shot to her feet, her teacup crashing onto the grass. "Ex-wife?! How is that possible? Nathan just broke up with Victoria! He was never married!"

"Oh, you didn't know." Cassandra smirked. "They had a secret marriage and only recently divorced. And guess who arranged it? My grandfather."

Seeing Isabelle's growing interest in Nathan, Cassandra seized the opportunity to stoke the flames. "Even after the divorce, Nathan and Evelyn remained close. Victoria tried clinging to him twice, making a scene, but he hadn't fully moved on from Evelyn! She brought it on herself with her petty schemes, but can anyone deny that breaking up with her had nothing to do with that viper, Evelyn?"

Now it was Isabelle's turn to seethe.

"No wonder! That night, the way Nathan looked at her—like she had him under a spell." Isabelle gritted her teeth, bitterness seeping into her voice. "Victoria fought for over a decade to win his heart. How did that woman become his wife? What right did she have?!"

Her words dripped with venom. "Cassandra, if you don't mind, I'd love to be your sister-in-law!"

Cassandra nearly choked. This girl really doesn’t hold back!

"Of course I don’t mind! Compared to that ruthless, scheming Victoria, I’d much rather have you in the family!" Cassandra quickly pledged her allegiance.

"Since we both have clear goals, why not form an alliance?" Isabelle moved closer, gripping Cassandra’s shoulders firmly. "I’ll help you win my brother, and you help me with Nathan. Deal?"

Cassandra hesitated. "Isabelle, you know my family dynamics. My relationship with Nathan is... complicated. I’m not as close to him as you are to Julian. I’m afraid I won’t be much help!"

Her words were sincere. In her eyes, this was nearly an impossible task.
###Chapter 320

Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood adore you deeply! You can help me gather intel, acting as my inside source.

Combining our efforts, the benefits will far outweigh the risks—especially when dealing with Evelyn.

Working together is undoubtedly the smarter move!

Isabelle's eyes gleamed with ambition.

The moment Cassandra realized Isabelle's plan was to take down Evelyn, her face lit up with excitement.

"Let's form an alliance!" Cassandra declared. "We'll see how that wretched Evelyn dares to strut around Crestview like she owns the place!"

Isabelle crossed her arms, her bold crimson lips curling into a smirk of absolute confidence.

Born into luxury, Isabelle had been doted on by her family since childhood.

She attended elite schools alongside royalty, won international accolades, and lived her entire life under the spotlight.

Defeat was a foreign concept to her. Whatever she wanted, she always got.

"My hand belongs only to the woman I love."

Isabelle clenched her fists. Not this time, Nathan. I won't let you slip away again. I will be the one to hold your hand—no one else.

The day of their return to Fairhaven arrived in a flash.

To make it back in time for the evening banquet, Evelyn spent the entire day in a frenzy—approving contracts, attending meetings, and finalizing wedding plans.

Her schedule was relentless.

But the results were worth it.

Under Evelyn's leadership, Isabella Wang's wedding plans were successfully finalized after days of intense teamwork.

The moment Evelyn signed off with "approved," the room erupted in cheers, the excitement rivaling an Olympic victory celebration.

Working with Evelyn demanded both mental and physical stamina.

One wrong move, and you'd collapse from exhaustion.

Yet, not a single complaint was voiced. No one even considered backing out.

Despite her status as Monarch Group's heiress, Evelyn rolled up her sleeves and worked just as hard as everyone else.

She kept them fueled with endless meals, coffee, and snacks—never letting anyone go hungry.

Though she demanded perfection, her words were always gracious, her solutions brilliant.

Whenever someone hit a roadblock, Evelyn effortlessly guided them through it, earning their admiration.

"Everyone, thank you for your incredible effort these past few days," Evelyn said, standing at the head of the conference table.

"Take a well-deserved three-day break. Then, head to the dining director’s office—I’ve arranged deluxe buffet vouchers for all of you."

She smiled. "Once we secure Isabella Wang, bonuses and paid vacations are just the beginning. Those Maldives trips you’ve been dreaming about? I’ll personally fund them. My word is my bond."

"Long live Ms. Carter!" The team cheered, arms raised in exhilaration.

Though the deal wasn’t finalized yet, Evelyn’s promise filled them with hope.

By the time Evelyn left the conference room, it was already 5:00 p.m.

"Theo, is my evening attire ready?" she asked, striding toward the elevator.

"Yes, Ms. Evelyn. It’s waiting in the dressing room. Would you like to change now?"

She waved a hand dismissively. "No need. Uncle Victor watched me grow up—he’s practically Harrison’s brother. He’s seen me at my worst."

Time was running short. Evelyn and Theo stepped into the executive elevator.

As it descended, she adjusted her hair in the reflective doors and carefully reapplied her lipstick.

The final touch—like the last stroke on a masterpiece—instantly brightened her complexion.

Theo watched with an affectionate smile.

Beneath that fierce, unshakable exterior was still the same soft-hearted young woman he knew.

Lost in thought, neither noticed when the elevator reached the first floor.

Ding.

The doors slid open.

Once again, the intoxicating scent of violet leaves filled the air—warm, deep, and hauntingly elegant.

If this fragrance had a name, Alexander Whitmore would be its creator.

As expected, Evelyn’s gaze lifted—and collided with Alexander’s dark, enigmatic eyes.

Her breath hitched.

Her hand trembled, the lipstick swerving off-course, leaving a playful red streak near the corner of her mouth.

Alexander’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile as he drank in her startled expression.

"Ms. Carter," he murmured, his voice smooth as velvet.

"I’ve come to take you home."
###Chapter 321

Evelyn stared at him in disbelief, her voice barely above a whisper. "How...how did you get here?"

Theodore Winslow, standing behind her, watched Alexander Whitmore's sudden reappearance with growing unease. His fingers curled into tight fists at his sides.

"They told me this elevator was exclusively for your use," Alexander replied smoothly, his lips curving into a practiced smile that didn't reach his eyes. "So I waited."

"That's not what I meant." Evelyn's delicate brows drew together. "Why did you come looking for me? Shouldn't you be preparing for tonight's dinner at Willow Creek Estate with your father?"

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. "That's precisely why I'm here - to escort you home. We'll go together."

Evelyn's full lips pressed into a thin line. His explanation was flawless, yet something felt off. "That's very kind of you, Mr. Whitmore, but Sebastian already made arrangements. He'll be here shortly to take me home." She forced a polite smile. "I'll see you at the estate tonight."

"I've already spoken with Harrison Kingsley about changing the plans. He agreed, so Sebastian won't be coming." Alexander's voice remained unshaken.

"What?" Evelyn's eyes widened, her carefully maintained composure slipping for just a second.

"Our families have been close for generations," Alexander continued smoothly. "Chairman Kingsley and my father are like brothers. We practically grew up together. Surely you don't think I'd let anything happen to you?"

Internally, Alexander thought, Though I'd love nothing more than to steal you away to Serenia, to keep you as my most precious treasure. But aloud he simply said, "Shall we?"

Evelyn hesitated. This was completely unlike Sebastian, who usually guarded her like a prized possession. Had her brother really agreed to this? Was he trying to push her toward Alexander like their father might?

"Very well," she finally conceded, though suspicion still lingered in her gaze. "Thank you for going out of your way."

"Ms. Carter," Alexander's voice dropped to that intimate timbre she'd grown accustomed to, "I always have time for you."

As they turned to leave, Theodore suddenly called out, "Ms. Evelyn!"

Both paused. Evelyn turned with a questioning look. "Yes, Theo?"

At that moment, Alexander adjusted his glasses, his hawk-like gaze slicing toward Theodore with chilling precision. The secretary froze under that look, his words dying in his throat.

"Oh, Theo," Evelyn said brightly, oblivious to the silent exchange. "You don't need to accompany me tonight. Go home and rest - you've been working so hard lately."

Theodore's shoulders slumped as he watched them walk away. That cold, calculating stare from Alexander left him feeling like he'd been plunged into icy darkness.

Their exit through the hotel lobby drew immediate attention from staff members.

"Look! Ms. Carter has a new escort!" one whispered excitedly.

"And he's absolutely gorgeous!" another added. "Mr. Winslow doesn't stand a chance!"

"They're completely different types," a third observed. "This one's like a sleek panther, all dangerous elegance, while Theo's more like a loyal golden retriever."

"I'll take both!" someone giggled.

Outside, Alexander's chauffeured car waited. His assistant held the door open, but as Evelyn moved to enter, Alexander caught her wrist gently.

"Ms. Carter."

Evelyn turned, surprised. "Yes?"

Alexander's gaze softened as he produced a crisp white handkerchief from his pocket. "Your lipstick," he murmured, reaching toward her face.

This time, Evelyn was quicker. She snatched the handkerchief from his hand with a playful glint in her almond-shaped eyes. "I can manage, thank you."

Alexander's lips twitched in amusement but he said nothing. Moments later, the luxury sedan pulled away from the hotel, leaving Theodore standing alone in the gathering twilight.
###Chapter 322

The sleek black Lamborghini idled across the street, its tinted windows rolling down to reveal Nathan Blackwood's striking profile.

His jaw was clenched, his usually icy gaze now tinged with red as he watched the Bentley pull away. The sight of Evelyn and Alexander together sent a jolt through him, sharp as lightning. A cold dread seeped into his veins.

Nathan hadn’t slept in two nights. Not even sleeping pills could quiet his restless mind.

Since their encounter at the concert, he’d been distracted, his thoughts consumed by her. Normally unshakable in his focus, he’d skipped critical meetings and let reports pile up untouched.

He didn’t understand why.

But he knew Evelyn was the reason.

Today, without telling Oliver, he’d driven himself to the Monarch Grand Hotel and waited all afternoon.

Just to catch a glimpse of her.

Just to see if it would finally let him sleep.

Instead, seeing her still with Alexander hit him like a physical blow. Pain lanced through his skull, his vision swimming for a moment.

Would this help his insomnia?

No.

It felt like a heart attack.

Nathan’s bloodshot eyes darkened. He gritted his teeth and slammed his foot on the accelerator.

The sports car roared to life, tearing after the Bentley.

Willow Creek Estate buzzed with activity as servants hurried to prepare for the evening’s guests. Following Harrison’s invitation, the Kingsley siblings who could make it had gathered—Sebastian, Dominic, and the youngest, Raymond, were already there. Evelyn was on her way.

Arabella, swamped with coursework, had bowed out. Since this wasn’t a formal event, Lillian had insisted her daughter focus on her studies.

Another night dominated by testosterone.

Dominic sipped his tea, glancing between Sebastian on his left and Raymond on his right. He shook his head with a wry smile. "Why is it so hard to get our sisters in one room?"

"Dom, be grateful," Raymond drawled, sprawled across the sofa in his leather jacket, one arm propped behind his head. His posture screamed cop, not Kingsley heir. "We just closed a big case. The chief gave us two days off. Otherwise, we wouldn’t see each other for another decade."

As the youngest Kingsley, Raymond bore the strongest resemblance to Harrison—thick brows, doe eyes, a sharp nose, full lips, and sun-kissed skin.

"I wouldn’t mind that," Dominic teased.

"Be thankful I’m here!"

A sharp crack cut through the air.

Sebastian and Dominic jolted upright, startled, as Raymond—without even looking—snatched a walnut hurtling toward him midair.

Dominic blinked. "What kind of reflexes are those?"

Raymond grinned, cracking the walnut open with one hand. "Mom, you spoil me. You know these are my favorite."

Lillian marched over, hands on her hips. "Sit up straight! You’re a Kingsley, not some street thug. Are you a cop or an undercover criminal?"

Raymond popped the kernel into his mouth. "Does it matter?"

"Change. Now." She kicked his boot. "Chairman Whitmore and his sons will be here soon. Don’t embarrass your father."

In the study, Harrison sat on a vintage leather sofa, reading glasses perched on his nose as he flipped through a stack of photos.

All of them featured Evelyn and Alexander.

Quentin stood nearby. "As instructed, I’ve discreetly monitored Ms. Evelyn’s dating situation. She hasn’t contacted anyone else on the list, but she’s been spending significant time with Mr. Whitmore."

Harrison nearly wore the photos out from flipping through them. "Has Alexander made any inappropriate advances?"

"None. He’s been nothing but respectful."

Harrison grunted, silent.

A knock sounded at the door. Camille’s voice floated through. "Harrison, Chairman Whitmore and his sons have arrived."
###Chapter 323

The grand foyer of Cliffside Manor buzzed with refined energy as Sebastian and Dominic Kingsley stood beside their impeccably dressed brother Raymond, who had chosen a tailored navy suit for the occasion. Together with their elegant stepmothers Lillian and Sophia, they warmly welcomed Victor Whitmore and his second son Nathaniel into their home.

"Sebastian, CEO of Monarch Group, and Dominic, the renowned prosecutor! My, how you've both grown into such distinguished gentlemen!" Victor's booming voice filled the marble hall as he clasped their hands with genuine affection. His sharp gaze then landed on Raymond. "And this must be young Raymond? The last time I saw you, you were barely reaching my waist! Now look at you - tall, handsome, and clearly inherited the Kingsley charm. Where does life find you these days?"

Raymond offered a modest smile, his posture straightening instinctively. "I serve as a detective with Crestview PD's Major Crimes Unit, Uncle Victor."

"A detective?" Victor's bushy eyebrows shot up, a flicker of calculation passing behind his cordial expression. To a titan of industry like himself, law enforcement seemed a quaint career choice - all risk with little financial reward, capped by limited advancement potential. The pinnacle would be police commissioner at best, a far cry from steering a corporate empire worth billions.

"My son has always marched to his own drum." Lillian's lips tightened almost imperceptibly as she smoothed her emerald silk dress. Among Harrison Kingsley's wives, she held the highest social standing as a Hartwell by birth. While she never competed for the family fortune, generations of blue-blooded upbringing had instilled exacting standards for her children.

Yet here was Raymond, her youngest, stubbornly dedicating himself to chasing criminals rather than boardroom victories - a constant source of quiet mortification at society gatherings.

"Lillian, you sell him short!" Sophia interjected brightly, her diamond bracelets catching the light as she gave Raymond's shoulder an affectionate squeeze. "At twenty-seven, Raymond already has four commendations for solving high-profile cases. He's the youngest division captain in Crestview PD history!"

Dominic nodded in agreement, his prosecutor's voice taking on a courtroom edge. "The Major Crimes Unit's clearance rate improved eighteen percent since Raymond took command. Hardly what I'd call lacking talent, Uncle Victor."

Victor chuckled, the sound rich with forced joviality. "Clearly a rising star then! The Kingsleys never fail to impress."

Raymond's cheeks warmed at the praise, his fingers unconsciously adjusting his tie. Family approval meant more to him than any departmental award.

"Victor! You old fox!"

The gathering parted as Harrison Kingsley descended the staircase with his characteristic effortless grace, flanked by Camille and his longtime aide Quentin. Though nearing sixty, Harrison moved with the vitality of a man twenty years younger, his silver-streaked hair perfectly styled. The sight made Victor unconsciously straighten his own posture.

"It's been months since you darkened my doorstep," Harrison teased, his emerald eyes glinting with mischief. "I nearly sent out search parties thinking you'd fled the country to avoid losing another golf match."

Victor scoffed, adjusting his burgundy tie. "Says the man who declined my polo invitation last season! What was your excuse? 'Business in Serenia'?" He gave Harrison's traditional Chinese silk robe an exaggerated once-over. "Or were you worried those aging knees couldn't mount a horse anymore?"

Laughter rippled through the assembled family as the two patriarchs fell into their familiar competitive banter, a decades-long dance of one-upmanship that had begun in their university days.

"Save your concern, old friend," Harrison retorted, running a hand through his still-thick hair. "I'll be the one pushing your wheelchair when we're both doddering relics in some luxury retirement home."

The assembled guests chuckled at their playful rivalry. Both men had maintained their appearances with almost obsessive dedication over the years - Victor in his custom Brioni suit that accentuated his broad shoulders, Harrison looking regal in embroidered silk that whispered of private ateliers and astronomical tailoring bills. Their lifelong competition showed no signs of abating, even as grandchildren began entering the picture.

Camille exchanged amused glances with Sophia. Some things never changed - least of all the unspoken contest between these two titans to see who could age more gracefully. Currently, Harrison seemed to be winning by a hair, his lack of silver strands at the temples a particular point of irritation for Victor.

As champagne flutes circulated, the gathering settled into comfortable conversation, the grand hall alive with the clink of crystal and the murmur of old money exchanging pleasantries. Yet beneath the polished surface, unspoken calculations continued - alliances being weighed, futures being assessed, and the ever-present Kingsley-Whitmore rivalry playing out in subtle glances and carefully chosen words.
###Chapter 324

Nathaniel approached with effortless elegance, offering a respectful bow to Harrison.

Though Nathaniel and Alexander shared blood as half-brothers, their appearances couldn't have been more distinct.

Alexander, Victor's youngest son, possessed an ethereal beauty that blurred gender lines—soft features, porcelain skin, and eyes like liquid silver.

In contrast, Victor's second son carried sharper edges—bold brows arching toward his temples, a chiseled jawline, and piercing eyes mirroring his father's intensity. His tall, lean frame exuded quiet authority.

"Ah, Nathaniel! Good to see you!"

Harrison's face warmed at the sight of the young Whitmore heir he'd watched mature over the years.

"Victor, didn't you mention bringing your youngest tonight? It's been ages since I last saw that boy. Where is he?"

Victor chuckled. "That rascal claimed some last-minute business. He'll arrive shortly."

His gaze swept the room. "Harrison, where's Evelyn? I thought she'd be joining us."

A cough. "She had matters to settle first but promised to come afterward." Truthfully, Harrison couldn't predict his daughter's movements—but Evelyn never broke her word.

"Tch. She'd better show! I came specifically for her!" Victor crossed his arms. "I'm not leaving without seeing Evelyn tonight!"

As if summoned, the butler's voice echoed through the hall. "Chairman Kingsley! Ms. Evelyn has returned!"

"Speak of the devil!"

Harrison's entire demeanor brightened, eyes crinkling with paternal pride.

All heads turned toward the entrance.

Victor perked up instantly, craning his neck like an eager schoolboy.

Even typically composed Nathaniel subtly adjusted his tie, his usual indifference cracking with uncharacteristic tension.

"Dad! I'm home!"

Evelyn's crystalline laughter filled the space as she glided in—sunshine incarnate—with Alexander at her side.

The sight stunned everyone except Sebastian.

Harrison blinked in surprise.

Victor's expression morphed into something complicated, while Nathaniel's lips pressed into a bloodless line. His grip tightened on his tie, knuckles whitening.

Darkness pooled in his gaze.

"Uncle Harrison, Father—apologies for our delay."

Alexander's velvety voice broke the silence. After casting a lingering look at Evelyn, he offered the elders a flawless bow.

"Alex, did you two meet at the door?" Victor's eyes darted between them.

A slow, knowing smile curved Alexander's lips as he admired Evelyn's profile. "No, Father. I specifically collected Evelyn from her hotel." His fingers brushed hers. "We arrived together."
###Chapter 325

The grand hall plunged into abrupt silence, tension thickening the air like an approaching storm. Evelyn turned her head in surprise, her gaze colliding with Alexander's tender expression.

The way Alexander murmured "Evelyn" made Nathaniel's scowl deepen. Harrison studied his beloved daughter before appraising Alexander with an inscrutable look, though his lips curled into a faint smile. "Alex, you went out of your way to escort Evelyn home? That's too much trouble."

"Uncle Harrison, the pleasure was entirely mine."

Dominic nudged Sebastian with his elbow, whispering sharply, "Seb, when did Evelyn get so close to Alexander? I had no clue!"

"Do I need to report every detail of Evelyn's life to you?" Sebastian replied with deliberate nonchalance.

"So you knew about their relationship?"

"Naturally."

"Damn it! Are you flaunting your special bond with our sister now?"

"I specifically asked Alexander to bring Evelyn home."

Dominic sucked in a breath. "Seb, how could you casually throw our baby sister at some man? People's true colors are hard to discern. What if Alexander has ulterior motives? What if he makes inappropriate advances during the ride?"

"Ulterior motives are inevitable," Sebastian smirked lightly. "In this world, no man could remain immune to Evelyn's charm. As for the latter scenario..." His eyes glinted dangerously. "If Alexander were that kind of man, do you think he'd still be standing here with all his limbs intact?"

"...Point taken."

As the heiress of Monarch Group, Evelyn had been trained by Maxwell and Sebastian in swordsmanship and firearms since childhood while her peers were still playing with dolls.

Truthfully, Sebastian's actions weren't entirely selfless. Nathan had been entrenched in Evelyn's life for thirteen long years. Though she'd uprooted that man from her heart, the deep, agonizing wound remained.

She needed someone new to fill that void. While her brothers couldn't fulfill that role, Sebastian believed Alexander might.

While the men conversed in the parlor, Evelyn found herself cornered by her three stepmothers in the sunroom.

"Evelyn, darling, be honest. What's really going on between you and Alexander?" Sophia, ever the blunt one, wrapped an arm around Evelyn's slender waist with a mischievous grin.

"We're friends," Evelyn answered calmly.

"Boyfriend material?" Sophia pressed eagerly.

"Male friend!" Evelyn corrected, exasperated.

"Oh please, there's no such thing as platonic friendship between attractive singles. So he's your boyfriend. Even if you're not official yet, it's inevitable!" Sophia pinched Evelyn's waist playfully. "When I saved your father from that assassination attempt, he wanted to be sworn siblings. Look at us now! We just haven't had children yet."

Evelyn gaped, utterly defeated by Sophia's lack of filter.

Lillian and Camille exchanged amused glances. After all, if not for Sophia's bravery years ago, Harrison might not be alive today. Two bullet scars still marked Sophia's lower back and left shoulder from shielding Harrison.

"Evelyn, Alexander would be a wonderful match," Camille sighed dreamily. "It's not just about social status. Victor Whitmore and your father are close friends. Marrying into the Whitmore family would guarantee your happiness. Plus," she added with a wink, "Alexander is devastatingly handsome. Your children would be absolutely breathtaking."

"Wait—how did we jump to children?! He means nothing to me! Where is this conversation even going?" Evelyn felt the discussion spiraling into absurdity.

"Camille, I think we shouldn't judge a life partner solely by looks," Lillian interjected rationally, narrowing her eyes slightly. "From what I know, Alexander just returned from Serenia. He holds minimal shares in Whitmore Enterprises, and his position isn't stable. His mother was exiled abroad under the guise of medical treatment and is rarely heard from. While their union might seem equal, in reality, Evelyn might be marrying beneath her station."

She continued gravely, "Who's to say Alexander isn't eyeing Evelyn's fortune? He could be using her substantial background to gain power within the Whitmore family."

"Oh dear! That makes perfect sense. We shouldn't rush into this!" Sophia, ever the weathervane, immediately switched sides.

"Evelyn, even when shopping we compare three stores. Marriage is far more serious. Either remain single, or marry someone truly exceptional. Perhaps consider Nathaniel?" Camille suggested.

Overwhelmed, Evelyn covered her face with both hands. With so many mothers, their chatter felt like eight hundred mosquitoes buzzing in her ears.

Her head throbbed mercilessly.
###Chapter 326

The dinner was a lavish affair, with exquisite dishes spread across the table and a rare vintage from Harrison Kingsley’s prized collection—Château Belleview, aged to perfection over the past decade. The atmosphere remained warm and convivial, just as it had always been between the two families.

For Harrison and Victor Whitmore, this gathering was more than just a meal—it was a nostalgic reunion, a reminder of their decades-long friendship. The only difference now was the presence of their children, adding youthful energy to the evening.

Victor had an ulterior motive this time—finding suitable matches for his two unmarried sons.

Throughout the banquet, Nathaniel Whitmore sat directly across from Evelyn Carter, while Alexander Whitmore occupied the seat beside her.

The dining table was wide, making the distance between Nathaniel and Evelyn far greater than that between her and Alexander.

Nathaniel watched with quiet frustration as his younger brother attended to Evelyn with unwavering devotion. A shadow flickered in his eyes, and the fork in his hand nearly bent under his grip.

What a disadvantageous position! That cunning little brother of mine is making the most of this setup—right place, right time, right company.

Alexander, having learned from their previous encounters, knew Evelyn’s weakness for seafood—especially crab and shrimp, delicacies she could never resist.

So, throughout the meal, Alexander barely touched his own plate. Instead, he meticulously peeled shrimp for Evelyn, offering her one succulent piece after another. The entire table discreetly observed their interaction.

Evelyn indulged without restraint, savoring every bite in front of her family. Alexander’s long lashes lowered as a faint smile curved his lips. His elegant fingers deftly cracked open shrimp shells, placing the perfectly peeled morsels onto Evelyn’s plate.

For a man of his status, such an act might be considered beneath him. Yet Alexander seemed entirely absorbed, oblivious to the onlookers, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.

Evelyn showed no embarrassment, nor did she refuse his attentions. Instead, she accepted each offering with graceful appreciation, enjoying every moment.

Had they been alone, she might have rejected him outright. But with Victor present, the dynamics shifted. This was a golden opportunity to expose his vulnerabilities—she wouldn’t let it slip away.

As Alexander peeled each shrimp, wiping his fingers meticulously with a napkin afterward, Nathaniel couldn’t help but scoff. He knew his brother’s obsessive cleanliness—he wouldn’t even wear the same suit twice. Yet for Evelyn, he was breaking his own rules. It seemed Alexander was determined to outmaneuver him at every turn.

"My daughter is becoming more and more unrestrained. You must forgive her manners, Victor," Harrison said, slightly embarrassed by Evelyn’s voracious appetite.

"Oh, Harrison, don’t say that. We’re all family here—no need for formalities. Evelyn’s honesty reminds me of you in your younger days. I adore it. Honestly, I’d love to whisk her away in a grand procession and make her my daughter-in-law!" Victor laughed heartily, finally revealing his true intentions.

Harrison merely smiled in response, choosing not to delve deeper into the topic.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finally sat back, satisfied. She covered her mouth delicately as she let out a soft sigh. Alexander turned to her, his deep gaze lingering, warmth swirling in his eyes.

"Wipe your hands," he murmured, discreetly passing her a napkin beneath the table.

"Mm, thanks," Evelyn replied, dabbing her lips with practiced elegance.

"Evelyn seems to have quite the appetite tonight," Nathaniel remarked with a charming smile.

"Oh, my apologies. The food here is simply too delicious—I couldn’t help myself," Evelyn began.

"No, no, Evelyn, you misunderstand me. I didn’t mean it as criticism. I just find you refreshingly different from the other society ladies I’ve met," Nathaniel said warmly.

Leaning forward, he added with sincerity, "I admire your authenticity. You’re utterly captivating."

Hmm. So being 'real' just because I eat like a normal person? Has he never met a woman who enjoys food before? Evelyn thought wryly, but she smiled politely. "Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Nathaniel."

"I noticed you haven’t had much to drink. You must be thirsty. Allow me to pour you some wine," Nathaniel suggested, rising smoothly with the intention of serving her.

But before he could, Alexander cut in coolly, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "Seafood pairs with white wine, not red. Honestly, Nathaniel, have you been living under a rock? Even basic etiquette eludes you now?"
###Chapter 327

Alexander's taunt made Nathaniel's expression shift instantly. His fists clenched discreetly beneath the table.

The Kingsley family pretended not to notice, but Victor, sharp as ever, caught the tension. His gaze darkened as he studied Alexander, displeasure evident in his eyes.

"Evelyn, I'll have someone bring you a glass of white wine to pair with the seafood," Alexander suggested smoothly, now ignoring Nathaniel's stiff posture. "A small sip won't hurt."

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Honestly, anything is fine for me."

Trapped between the two Whitmore brothers, she felt her scalp prickle with discomfort. Forcing an awkward smile, she added, "Though I actually prefer beer."

To her surprise, both Nathaniel and Alexander turned to her simultaneously, their voices overlapping.

"No! That could cause gout!"

As dinner wound down, Alexander excused himself to the restroom.

Standing at the sink, he methodically pumped hand sanitizer into his palm. His pale, elegant hands looked almost clinical under the harsh lighting. He scrubbed them vigorously until they flushed pink.

Five washes later, he lifted his hands to his nose and inhaled. The faintest trace of seafood lingered. With a quiet sigh, he squeezed another dollop of sanitizer, meticulously cleaning each finger.

The restroom door creaked open.

Nathaniel stepped inside, his expression stormy as he watched his brother’s obsessive ritual. A mocking smirk curled his lips. "Going all out, aren’t you, Alex? Spending the whole night peeling shrimp for Evelyn must be torture for a germaphobe like you. Will you be dreaming of soap tonight?"

Alexander ignored him, plucking a few tissues from the dispenser. He patted his hands dry with deliberate grace, his fair lashes lowered.

"Nathaniel, it's been years. I thought you might have picked up some impressive skills abroad," Nathaniel sneered. "Turns out, you’ve just perfected the art of groveling."

Alexander’s lips curved. "Oh? Are you jealous? At least in front of Evelyn, I have the privilege of groveling. You don’t even get that chance, do you?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

"Compared to your pathetic attempts to get close to her," Alexander continued smoothly, "being a groveler seems far more valuable, doesn’t it?"

Nathaniel let out a sharp, furious laugh. "No wonder Father never favored you. You’ve always been twisted. Being human isn’t enough for you—you’d rather be her lapdog!"

"In a world that laughs at failure but not at success," Alexander mused, tossing the crumpled tissue into the bin, "the ends justify the means." He tilted his head. "Since we were children, you’ve barely spared me a word. Why the sudden interest tonight? Could it be that you’re desperate to see me win Evelyn’s favor? Does it sting to realize even a lapdog outshines you?"

"Alex!" Nathaniel’s voice was a snarl. "Don’t get ahead of yourself. Father will never approve of you and Evelyn. Do you honestly think you stand a chance against me?"

"Whether I do or not," Alexander replied coolly, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, "has never been for you to decide." His dark eyes glinted as he met Nathaniel’s furious gaze. "When it comes to Evelyn, victory is inevitable for me."

The tension snapped. Nathaniel stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Alexander’s smile faded. His fingers curled into fists.

Then, his phone buzzed. He answered coldly. "What?"

"Mr. Whitmore," his secretary’s voice was cautious, "there’s something you should know. Please remain calm."

A pause. Then, in a hushed tone: "Nathan Blackwood is at Willow Creek Estate’s gates. He came alone."

Alexander’s eyes darkened. "Understood."

Meanwhile, Nathan stood beneath the flickering streetlamp across from Willow Creek Estate, the autumn wind slicing through his thin suit.

This was his third time waiting here for Evelyn.

But tonight was different. The quiet hope he’d once harbored had morphed into something fiercer—a longing that burned in his chest.

Pride told him not to call her. No self-respecting man would endure this humiliation repeatedly.

So he waited.

She would come out eventually.

And he would see her.
###Chapter 328

Nathan only wanted to catch a fleeting glimpse of Evelyn.

Suddenly, the wrought iron gates of Willow Creek Estate creaked open. Nathan's pulse spiked violently. Every muscle in his body tensed as his broad shoulders leaned forward unconsciously.

His piercing gaze locked onto the entrance, breath hitching in anticipation.

But when Alexander Whitmore sauntered into view with that infuriating smirk, Nathan's hope shattered like glass.

The cold night air grew heavier as Alexander approached with deliberate steps.

"Mr. Blackwood," Alexander drawled, adjusting his cufflinks. "How...unexpected. Isn't it rather presumptuous to lurk outside a lady's residence at this hour?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his voice glacial. "My business here doesn't concern you. Since when did Fairhaven become Whitmore territory?"

"Always so arrogant," Alexander sneered. "I know exactly why you're here. Regretting your choice? Realized too late that Victoria played you?"

A muscle twitched in Nathan's cheek as bitter truth coated his tongue.

"Evelyn has moved on," Alexander continued icily. "If you think you can waltz back into her life after breaking her heart, you'll have to go through me first."

Nathan's fingers curled into fists. "You don't speak for her."

His chin lifted defiantly. "Even if I have regrets, even if I want her back - that's between Evelyn and me. Your interference means nothing."

"Damn it, Nathan—"

Their heated exchange was abruptly cut off.

Nathan's head snapped up as Evelyn stormed toward them, her silk robe fluttering like battle standards in the night breeze. His treacherous heart hammered against his ribs.

"Evelyn, you'll catch cold—" Alexander's tone instantly softened, concern replacing his earlier venom.

But she swept past him without a glance, stopping mere inches from Nathan.

The space between them crackled with electricity, Alexander suddenly rendered invisible.

"Touring Fairhaven again, Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Should I start charging admission for loitering outside my gates?"

Nathan drank in her furious beauty, his response startlingly honest. "The view is...exceptional."

Evelyn's eyes flashed. Was this man truly so dense?

"Then I'll arrange a proper tour guide," she bit out. "This isn't a damn scenic overlook!"

When Nathan simply continued staring with those haunted eyes, Evelyn lost patience. "Leave. Now."

For a suspended moment, raw emotion flickered across his face. Then, shockingly gentle: "Alright. Goodnight."

Evelyn blinked. Goodnight? After this spectacle?

As Nathan turned toward his car with unsettling finality, something primal made her call out—

"Nathan, wait!"
###Chapter 329

Nathan's pulse quickened as he turned away from Evelyn, an irrepressible smile tugging at his lips. Yet in that same breath, his courage faltered, preventing him from meeting her gaze directly.

Alexander's mouth formed a tight line. A tempest brewed in the depths of his stormy eyes. Though Evelyn and Nathan's tumultuous divorce had shattered their world, he still detected the lingering undercurrent of unresolved emotions between them - invisible threads stubbornly connecting them.

"Since you're here, Nathan, speak your mind before you leave." Evelyn's voice was glacial as she stepped forward, scrutinizing Nathan's rigid posture. "Don't lurk about like a common thief. I'd hate to have nightmares tonight."

A bitter taste flooded Nathan's mouth as he finally turned to face her, each word measured. "It's nothing. Just... insomnia these past few nights."

Evelyn's brow furrowed, struggling to connect his sudden appearance at Willow Creek Estate with his sleep troubles.

Could his sleeplessness truly involve me? The thought unsettled her.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Why must he blame me for everything? Honestly, I haven't provoked him!"

"If you can't sleep, try medication or counting sheep. Showing up here won't solve anything."

"It already has." Nathan's intense gaze locked onto hers. "I believe I'll sleep soundly tonight after this."

With those cryptic words, he turned on his heel and departed.

Evelyn stared blankly at his retreating silhouette until the sleek sports car dissolved into the night. Only then did she release her pent-up frustration.

"What an absolute lunatic!"

Inside the vehicle, Nathan suddenly felt the weight of exhaustion crash over him. The emotional toll of seeing Evelyn left him drained. His fingers trembled against the steering wheel as profound weariness enveloped him.

The charged atmosphere in the car grew heavier as he watched Evelyn and Alexander disappear beyond Willow Creek's ornate gates.

With unsteady hands, Nathan retrieved his phone and dialed Oliver.

"Mr. Blackwood, your instructions?"

"Investigate."

"Pardon?" Oliver's confusion was palpable.

"Dig into the connections between the Kingsleys and the Whitmores. Especially Evelyn and Alexander's relationship." Nathan's jaw tightened. "Evelyn isn't easily impressed. I refuse to believe their bond is as simple as Alexander claims."

"Understood, sir! I'll begin immediately!"

Oliver couldn't conceal his satisfaction. His tone brightened noticeably. Gathering courage, he murmured, "Had you trusted Mrs. Blackwood sooner, she might never have left. Those interlopers wouldn't dare—"

"One more word and you'll be transferred to our most remote branch!" Nathan growled.

Oliver immediately backtracked. "Apologies, Mr. Blackwood! I spoke out of turn!"

Evelyn had been aware of Nathan's unannounced arrival at Willow Creek's entrance. Initially, she'd resolved to ignore whatever schemes her detestable ex-husband was concocting outside - he deserved some hardship.

Unexpectedly, Alexander had confronted him. To prevent further escalation, Evelyn had intervened personally to untangle the mess.

The brief altercation didn't disrupt the family gathering's harmony, and dinner concluded peacefully.

Harrison, accompanied by Quentin, retired to the study. He discreetly summoned Sebastian and Dominic.

"Father, did you need something?" Sebastian inquired.

"How much do you two know about Evelyn and Alexander's situation? Be truthful." Harrison smoothed his robe before settling gracefully onto the sofa.

The brothers exchanged glances before Dominic promptly deflected. "You should ask Sebastian! I'm completely in the dark about Evelyn and Christopher!"

Sebastian remained composed, his expression unreadable.

"Sebastian, what's the true nature of their relationship?"
###Chapter 330

Harrison's voice took on an interrogative edge, sharp as a prosecutor's cross-examination. "Evelyn has only ever allowed you and me to peel shrimp for her. Since when does she accept affection from other men? Tonight, Alexander was practically feeding her by hand at dinner. And she didn't even reject his advances. Out with it - what's really going on between them? Is Evelyn actually interested in him?"

"Father," Sebastian observed with quiet precision, "your tone suggests you're not particularly fond of Alexander Whitmore."

Harrison pressed his lips into a thin line, leaving the accusation unanswered.

"Alexander and Evelyn share childhood history. Their reunion seems to have rekindled that connection." Sebastian adjusted his cufflinks thoughtfully. "Evelyn rarely connects with men so effortlessly, and our families have maintained good relations with the Whitmores for years. If their relationship progresses, it might not be an unfavorable development."

Dominic leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees. "When Victor arrived tonight with both his unmarried sons in tow, his intentions were transparent. He's clearly seeking a marital alliance with our family. His sights are set on Evelyn!" Harrison's gaze dropped, his head shaking slowly. "But let me be unequivocal - I will not sanction this marriage."

The Kingsley brothers exchanged subtle glances. Their father's vehement opposition to the Whitmore family came as an unexpected revelation.

"Dad," Dominic couldn't resist teasing, "did you and Uncle Victor have some secret falling out? Blocked each other's numbers perhaps?" His lips quirked. "Though I must say, you both played the gracious hosts remarkably well tonight. If it were me, I'd have made the tension painfully obvious."

"With that deductive ability, I'm astonished you passed the bar," Harrison shot back, eyes narrowing. "Did you use my influence to get special treatment during your bar exams?" His expression sobered. "Evelyn is my most precious daughter. She just escaped the vipers' nest of the Blackwood family. I'll be damned before I deliver her into another den of wolves - the Whitmore household!" His fist clenched unconsciously. "Do you think their family is some idyllic paradise? They're embroiled in vicious internal power struggles. None of Victor's four children are simple characters. If Evelyn marries into that family, she'll be constantly navigating treacherous political waters." His voice dropped. "Moreover, Alexander is Victor's least favored son. While his overseas ventures appear successful, his business origins are... questionable at best. A man with such a past might see marriage into our family as an opportunity to legitimize himself in Crestview society."

Dominic's eyebrows shot up in surprise, while Sebastian's long lashes cast shadows over his suddenly pensive expression, lips pressing together in silent self-reproach.

In his determination to provide his sister with a fresh start, he'd overlooked these critical considerations. The oversight stung.

"As my daughter," Harrison declared, voice thick with emotion, "Evelyn deserves to illuminate someone's life, not immolate herself to brighten another's path. I won't allow it!"

Meanwhile, a sleek Bentley glided through Crestview's moonlit streets.

Nathaniel had departed in his own luxury vehicle, while Victor had broken protocol by summoning Alexander to ride with him. The father and son sat in strained silence, the air between them crackling with unspoken tensions that spoke volumes about their fractured relationship.

"Alexander," Victor broke the silence with icy precision, "explain your behavior with Evelyn tonight."

Alexander's lips curved in a humorless smile. "Since when do you take interest in my romantic pursuits? For fifteen years in Serenia, you never once inquired about Mother or me. Now that I'm back in Crestview, suddenly my every move warrants your scrutiny."

"Don't deflect," Victor snapped, his aristocratic features hardening. "I'm asking about your relationship with Evelyn Kingsley!"

"As you witnessed tonight," Alexander adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, the lenses catching the passing streetlights, "Evelyn and I share an... intimate connection." His smirk held an edge of challenge.

Victor exhaled sharply, a vein pulsing at his temple. "Effective immediately, you will cease all contact with Evelyn. Maintain absolute distance from her."

"Why?" Alexander's question dripped with false curiosity.

"Evelyn is the match I've selected for Nathaniel. Your interference jeopardizes carefully laid plans."

Alexander's chuckle held no warmth. "Nathaniel is your son, and I'm not? If Evelyn were with me, she'd still become your daughter-in-law. What's the problem?"

"My decision is final. Nathaniel will marry Evelyn." Victor's jaw tightened. "If you seek alliance with the Kingsleys, Harrison has a younger daughter - Arabella. She remains unmarried."

Alexander's fingers stilled on his glasses. "So the disfavored son only merits the illegitimate daughter?" His voice turned lethally soft. "How... predictable."

"Alexander! Mind your tongue!"

Victor's face flushed with barely contained rage. "You won't compete with Nathaniel. I'll provide what you're due, but don't overreach for what isn't yours."

"I've heard that refrain since childhood," Alexander murmured, leaning back against the supple leather seats. "Yet to date, I've received nothing that was ever truly mine." His eyes closed, the picture of relaxation belying his next words. "Keep your empty promises. Deliver this message to Nathaniel - he should rein in his aspirations. Evelyn belongs to me alone. He wouldn't survive the competition."
###Chapter 331

The tension between Blackwood Hotel and Monarch Grand Hotels remained palpable beneath their surface calm.

As an A-list celebrity, Isabella Laurent commanded immense influence in the entertainment world. Her extravagant lifestyle meant no expense would be spared for her upcoming nuptials.

The diva had made one non-negotiable demand - only master-crafted, one-of-a-kind jewelry pieces would grace her wedding ensemble.

"Each piece must be an exclusive creation from legendary artisans," Oliver Sinclair relayed the star's requirements to Nathan Blackwood and his executive team. "Ms. Laurent insists this is non-negotiable for someone of her stature."

Nathan's fountain pen tapped rhythmically against the conference table as his stormy gaze darkened.

The boardroom erupted in murmurs.

"Does she think our hotels are her personal jewelry box?" one executive scoffed.

"Back in the day, they called people like her traveling performers," another muttered. "Now she acts like royalty."

Nathan's commanding voice cut through the chatter. "This is a strategy meeting, not a gossip circle. Either contribute solutions or remain silent."

The chastened team scrambled to propose alternatives.

The design director presented a meticulously prepared dossier of renowned jewelers. "Each of these artisans has won multiple international awards," she emphasized, projecting their masterpieces onto the screen.

Nathan studied the presentation with detached interest before asking, "Why isn't Alexa included?"

The room plunged into stunned silence.

"Did she pass away?" Nathan asked bluntly, genuinely perplexed by their reaction.

The design director nearly choked on her mineral water. "No, Mr. Blackwood. Alexa is... well, she's practically a deity in jewelry design circles. The artisans I just mentioned all consider her work inspirational. Her pieces become family heirlooms. Convincing her to design for a celebrity wedding would be... unprecedented."

Nathan's lips curved into a determined smile. "Every legend has a price. We're securing Alexa for Isabella's wedding jewelry."

The executives exchanged horrified glances.

"But Mr. Blackwood," the design director protested, "the designers I've proposed are exceptionally—"

"It's not about their qualifications," Nathan interrupted. "It's about our competition." He leaned forward, his piercing gaze sweeping the room. "Monarch Grand Hotels won't settle for second best. Knowing Evelyn Carter, she'll pursue Alexa with everything Monarch Group can offer."

A heavy silence descended as the team absorbed this reality. The battle lines had been drawn - this wedding contract would be won by whoever could secure the impossible: a custom collection from the legendary Alexa.
###Chapter 332

Nathan's eyes darkened. "She won't settle for anything less than perfection. If Evelyn sets her sights on something, she obliterates the competition, leaving no chance for retaliation. That's why we need to strike first—Alexa must be ours before she makes a move."

Murmurs of doubt rippled through the room. If even Blackwood Industries couldn't secure Alexa, how could Evelyn Carter possibly succeed?

"I want a full dossier on Alexa by tonight—not her professional achievements, but her personal life," Nathan commanded, preparing to dismiss the meeting.

Just then, the head of design spoke up hesitantly. "Mr. Blackwood, I can provide extensive details about Alexa's work, but as for her personal life... there's only one thing I can confirm."

Nathan turned sharply. "And that is?"

"She's a woman."

The next morning, after wrapping up her team meeting, Evelyn strode back into her office.

"Theodore, I'm starving. Order me fried chicken and beer—extra crispy, and make it quick." She flopped into her chair, booting up a game on her computer.

"Ms. Evelyn, how can you be so relaxed?" Theodore stared at her, exasperated. "It's crunch time, and you're craving junk food? I'm so stressed I could spontaneously combust. Isabella Wang's team is hunting for a top-tier jewelry designer, and Blackwood Industries is definitely making moves. Why aren’t you worried? You rejected every proposal from our team, insisting on hiring Alexa. Everyone knows Alexa is practically a myth! We’re on a deadline—how are we supposed to pull this off?"

Evelyn smirked, fingers flying across her keyboard. "If we can't get Alexa, neither can they. No need to panic."

"But—"

A video call notification flashed on her screen.

Theodore moved to leave, but Evelyn waved him back. "Stay. It's just a friend."

She accepted the call, and a striking blonde woman with piercing blue eyes appeared.

"Long time no see, Giselle."

"Actually, Nathan Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries, just reached out. He wants Alexa to come out of retirement to design for them." Giselle delivered the news in flawless French.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Nathan personally contacted you? That must’ve bruised his ego."

"Doesn’t matter who asks. My answer stays the same."

Evelyn leaned forward, resting her chin on her palm, eyes twinkling. "But what if I were the one asking? As Alexa’s right hand, could you make an exception, Giselle?"

Theodore’s jaw dropped. So this was why Evelyn had been so confident—she had an inside connection to Alexa’s inner circle!

But Giselle’s next words sent his mind reeling.

She rolled her eyes, a playful smirk tugging at her lips. "Stop teasing me, Ms. Alexa. Do you know how hard it’s been to track you down?"

Ms. Alexa?

Theodore’s brain short-circuited.

Evelyn Carter… was Alexa? The legendary, reclusive jewelry designer the entire industry worshipped?
###Chapter 333

Theodore stood frozen, his jaw slack with disbelief. Evelyn, however, remained utterly composed, even stretching lazily with a soft yawn.

"Why reveal myself now? Look at poor Theodore—you've terrified him," she teased, her lips curving into an amused smile.

"Alexa, why haven't we heard from you since you returned to Crestview? The entire atelier has been waiting for your return!" Giselle's voice trembled, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Evelyn sighed, a shadow of guilt crossing her features. "I'm sorry, darling. My family needs me right now, so I can't leave. You'll have to manage things at the Valmont studio for a while."

She hesitated before continuing, her tone softening. "But don't worry about the atelier closing. The pieces I designed in my early years are priceless—funds won't be an issue. Still, I don’t want anyone sacrificing their future for me. If anyone wishes to leave, they have my blessing—including you, Giselle. You deserve to choose your own path."

Giselle wiped her eyes fiercely. "Alexa, I owe you everything. I’ll never leave."

Evelyn’s gaze softened. "You’ve repaid me tenfold. I refuse to be your burden. It’s an honor to have you, but your life is yours to shape."

Her eyes shimmered with warmth as she chuckled lightly. "The reason Alexa became a legend? It was because of all of you standing beside me."

Theodore swallowed hard, his vision blurring with emotion.

In that moment, he realized how foolish he’d been. He had thought he understood Evelyn—admired her brilliance, her poise. But she wasn’t just extraordinary. She was Alexa. A living icon. And he had underestimated her in every way.

"Alexa, if Blackwood Industries contacts me again, I’ll reject them outright. Better yet, I’ll tell them you’re collaborating with Monarch Group—crush their hopes completely."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a sly grin. "Oh, don’t reject them yet. If we don’t give them hope, how can we properly destroy them?"

Giselle blinked, then nodded in understanding.

"The game hasn’t even begun, and Nathan hasn’t played his trump card yet. If we win too easily, where’s the fun in that?"

Evelyn flashed a wicked smile, her teeth gleaming like a fox’s. "I’ve waited so long for this. Shouldn’t we let Nathan exhaust himself trying to win—only to realize his opponent was waiting at the finish line all along? That despair is far more delicious than mere defeat, don’t you think?"

As the call ended, Theodore remained shell-shocked. The revelation of Evelyn’s true identity had left him reeling. He had known she was brilliant, but Alexa? He nearly wanted to kneel in reverence.

This was the closest he’d ever been to a goddess.

"Earth to Theodore!" Evelyn waved a hand in front of his face, snapping him out of his daze.

He blinked rapidly, refocusing on her.

"Do you think I’m being too cruel?" She leaned back in her chair, spinning it lazily.

Theodore clenched his fists. "After everything Nathan did to you? You’re being merciful."

Evelyn exhaled, satisfied. "Good. That’s what I wanted to hear."

She closed her eyes, tilting her face toward the sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"I spent three years by Nathan’s side. The worst part wasn’t that he didn’t love me. It was that he treated me like I was nothing." Her voice turned icy. "And the way he flaunted his love for Victoria while we were still married? That was the deepest cut of all."
###Chapter 334

The scene replayed in my mind like a broken record.

Nathan Blackwood, the man who despised inconvenience, had purchased countless solo tickets to Silvercrest.

He had flown to Belvaux repeatedly, begging a master jeweler to craft a one-of-a-kind birthday gift for Victoria Sterling.

Some might call it preference.

But back then, I was still his wife.

Even if he felt nothing for me, he owed me basic respect.

I turned my back to Theodore Winslow, my voice flat, devoid of emotion.

It was as if I were narrating a tragic love story—one filled with melodrama and heartbreak.

Theodore knelt beside me like a devoted hound, his eyes burning with loyalty as he gazed up at me.

"For you to suffer because of that worthless woman—Nathan deserves to rot for what he did!"

A faint smile touched my lips as I waved a dismissive hand.

In the past, I would have seethed with bitterness.

Now, I felt nothing but cold amusement.

If Victoria was trash, then Nathan was the bin that held her.

She had gone from recyclable to irredeemable waste, but he had always been the container.

I was capable of love—but not blind devotion.

There was no point lingering over a trash bin.

Still, I found dark satisfaction in watching Nathan scramble for Alexa.

I wanted to see him fight desperately for me—only to lose everything in the end.

Nathan, you were always heartless.

Now, so am I.

To reach Alexa, Nathan chartered a private jet to Valmont.

As the plane soared through the clouds, memories surged unbidden.

The first year of our marriage.

Despite his hectic schedule, he had flown to Belvaux to commission Crimson Promise for Victoria.

He had groveled before a jeweler who crafted pieces for royalty.

Never before had he humbled himself so completely for anyone.

Moved by his persistence, the artisan had reluctantly agreed.

Now, Crimson Promise lay forgotten in its velvet box, never to see daylight again.

The necklace no longer symbolized love—only regret and shame.

Nathan stared blankly at the clouds outside the window.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn’s radiant face materialized in the mist, vivid as spring sunlight.

The illusion was so real his breath caught.

His hand lifted instinctively, fingers brushing the cold glass.

Empty.

A sharp ache twisted in his chest.

"Do you know how much Young Madam adored that necklace?"

"When she heard you were giving it to Victoria, she cried until her eyes were swollen!"

"If it were her, she would have treasured your gift. She kept every tie you discarded—never throwing anything away. She would never trample on your feelings."

Agony lanced through him.

The woman he thought would cherish his love had shattered it beyond repair.

Yet even in ruins, it was something Evelyn had once wept for—something she had dreamed of.

A bitter smile curved Nathan’s pale lips.

What kind of madness made Evelyn endure three years of suffering by my side?

Why was she so obsessed with me?
###Chapter 335

Oliver Sinclair approached with a steaming cup of espresso and placed it carefully on the table.

"Mr. Blackwood, I've reached out to Ms. Dubois, the head of Alexa’s atelier. She’s agreed to meet with you."

Nathan Blackwood’s weary eyes flickered with renewed determination.

"Truly?"

"Yes, but she only consented to a discussion. Her tone was... less than welcoming."

Oliver exhaled sharply, his brow furrowed. "I fear this negotiation may not go smoothly."

Nathan shook his head. "As long as someone from Alexa’s team is willing to speak with me, there’s still hope."

After three tense days in Valmont, Nathan finally secured a meeting with Giselle Dubois at a quaint café near Alexa’s studio. He wasn’t even granted entry inside.

"Mr. Blackwood, forgive my bluntness." Giselle crossed her arms, her gaze sharp and unyielding. "Alexa designs exclusively for royalty, first ladies, and those who’ve made extraordinary contributions to society. While Isabella Laurent is undoubtedly a star, she doesn’t meet our criteria."

Oliver barely suppressed an eye roll. Since when is jewelry more exclusive than a military honor?

Nathan remained composed. "I understand how this may sound, but I assure you, my intentions are sincere. Years ago, I established the Hope Haven Foundation in my mother’s name. We’ve supported countless causes—orphanages, scholarships, elderly care. I’m not asking Alexa to design for a celebrity. I’m asking her to consider the greater impact."

He leaned forward. "Moreover, all proceeds from Isabella’s wedding at our hotel will be donated to charity."

Giselle’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Are you implying Alexa lacks vision, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Not at all." Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"Many wealthy men come here cloaked in philanthropy, only to exploit Alexa’s reputation. How do we know you’re not one of them?" Her words struck like a blade. "How do we know your foundation isn’t just a front?"

Nathan’s fist clenched on his knee, knuckles whitening.

Oliver, unable to stay silent, interjected in flawless French, "Ms. Dubois, we came here in good faith. Must you be so hostile?"

Nathan raised a hand, silencing him. "Every transaction in the Hope Haven Foundation is publicly documented. I can provide full financial records for your review."

Giselle scoffed, rising from her seat without touching her coffee. "I’ll relay your proposal to Alexa. But don’t hold your breath. You’re hardly the first to beg for her attention."

She strode away, leaving Oliver fuming. "Does she always act like she’s swallowed a lemon, or is Valmont just cursed with early menopause?"

Nathan loosened his tie, exhaling slowly. "Prepare our backup plan. Alexa’s team won’t bend easily, and I doubt Evelyn can offer better terms."

"What now?" Oliver pressed.

"We focus on Isabella, but we don’t give up on Alexa." Nathan’s eyes darkened with resolve. "Monitor Evelyn’s movements. If she makes a move with Alexa, I want to know immediately."
###Chapter 336

Nathan Blackwood had been keeping a close watch on Evelyn Carter's movements ever since returning from Valmont to Crestview. Yet the reports from Oliver Sinclair only brought him the same monotonous updates—Evelyn remained buried in her work at Monarch Grand Hotels, never stepping foot outside the city.

Leaning back in his leather chair, Nathan gazed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, his brow furrowed. With Isabella Wang's wedding fast approaching, why wasn't Evelyn making any moves? Had she truly given up on her Alexa persona, or was she plotting something entirely different?

The incidents at Whitmore Gardens and Penelope Whitmore's arrest—intervened by Dominic Kingsley—had left Nathan wary of this seemingly delicate woman.

Honestly, who feared their ex-wife after divorce? The office phone buzzed, interrupting his thoughts.

"Sir, Mr. Montgomery is here to see you," came the secretary's voice.

"Send him in."

Julian Montgomery strolled into the CEO's office like he owned the place, flopping onto the sofa with the ease of someone about to kick off his shoes for a nap.

"How many times must I remind you? This isn't your damn lounge," Nathan snapped without looking up from his documents. "Some of us actually work."

Julian snorted. "Invitation? What are you, the damn Emperor of Crestview? Though now that I think about it, you do resemble those heartless tyrants in my mother's soap operas."

Nathan slammed his pen down. "State your business or get out."

Unfazed, Julian tossed an orange in the air. "Isabelle's been back in town for days. Mom's cooking your favorite tonight—you're coming."

"Busy," Nathan clipped. "With the Isabella Wang situation unresolved, I'm not in the mood for socializing."

"Bullshit." Julian peeled the orange with exaggerated care. "Mom just flew back from Belvaux specifically to cook for you. You're really going to disrespect your godmother?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "...Fine."

"That's more like it!" Julian's grin widened. "Though honestly, you're more loved in our family than your own. Pathetic, really."

A memory flashed through Nathan's mind—Isabelle's overly intimate behavior at the concert hall. When they'd strolled through parks hand-in-hand, she'd been a ten-year-old girl, his best friend's kid sister. Now? The thought made his skin crawl.

"About Isabelle—" he began, only to be interrupted by a sharp knock.

"Enter."

Oliver barged in, files in hand. "Mr. Blackwood, I've completed the investigation into Mrs. Carter's connection with Alexander Whitmore, along with the ties between the Whitmore and Kingsley families—" He froze upon seeing Julian. "Ah. My apologies."

Julian's eyes gleamed with mischief. "Oh don't stop on my account." He popped an orange slice into his mouth. "So you're spying on Evelyn now? Couldn't win her back fair and square?"

"Eat your damn fruit," Nathan growled, though his pulse betrayed him with an erratic thud.

"Why shouldn't I ask?" Julian chewed viciously. "I pursued Evelyn first, remember? You and Whitmore should both back off."

Nathan's eyes darkened with something primal. "And yet she married me." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "She'll never be yours."

"Big words for a divorced man." Julian nearly hurled the orange at Nathan's face. "If you're so great, why not chase her openly? What's with the sneaking around?"
###Chapter 337

By the time you finally make up your indecisive mind, Evelyn might already have a whole brood of children with Alexander!

Julian smirked, deliberately provoking Nathan.

Nathan felt a sharp pang in his chest, but he maintained his composure, replying coolly, "Who said I'm pursuing Evelyn? I was merely inquiring about their collaboration because she stole one of my projects. It could affect Blackwood Industries' interests."

Julian laughed, tossing an orange peel at him playfully. "Sure, keep telling yourself that. You're as stubborn as they come."

Nathan caught the peel, his face flushing with anger as he crushed it in his palm.

Oliver struggled to keep a straight face, forcing a serious expression. "Mr. Blackwood, it appears there’s nothing unusual between Young Madam and Alexander. For the past three years, she’s been by your side. No one else has caught her attention. In the last decade, I’ve found no connection between Young Madam and the Whitmore family."

Nathan’s expression softened slightly at this.

It seemed Alexander hadn’t yet won Evelyn over. Perhaps it was just wishful thinking on his part.

"But a few days ago," Oliver continued, "I discovered that Chairman Whitmore took his two unmarried sons, Nathaniel and Alexander, to Fairhaven—likely to visit Chairman Kingsley. Given the long-standing ties between the Kingsley and Whitmore families, Chairman Whitmore might be arranging a union between his sons and the Kingsley daughters!"

"A union?!"

Nathan and Julian both froze. Evelyn and Alexander were childhood friends of the same age, and their families were deeply connected.

No matter how Nathan looked at it, they seemed like a perfect match.

A wave of intense unease crashed over both men, overwhelming and inescapable.

"Well, I guess it’s game over," Julian mused, shooting Nathan a knowing glance.

He chuckled, "Seems even the Whitmores are eager to win my goddess over. You know what they say—persistent suitors wear down even the most resistant hearts. If Chairman Whitmore personally proposes a marriage alliance and Chairman Kingsley pressures Evelyn, it wouldn’t be surprising if she agrees in the end."

Nathan’s face turned icy.

Julian laughed. "Oh dear, looks like you might be attending your ex-wife’s wedding soon! Given your history, you should be extra generous with the gifts, don’t you think?" He popped another orange slice into his mouth, thoroughly amused.

A strange heat flared inside Nathan. His voice was rough as he snapped, "Impossible! Evelyn would never agree to a business marriage arranged by her family. She doesn’t care for Alexander. A woman who’s faced a lion wouldn’t settle for a wolf."

Julian smirked. "Wow, someone’s bitter."

Nathan scowled. "Julian!"

"I meant the orange is sour. Why are you so sensitive?" Julian teased, enjoying his snack.

That evening, Nathan arrived at the Montgomery residence as planned, accompanied by Julian. Despite his long-standing familiarity with the family—considering Mrs. Montgomery his godmother since childhood—he still observed proper etiquette.

He brought thoughtful gifts: premium health supplements known for their benefits.

Mrs. Montgomery, who adored Nathan, had prepared a lavish spread. Eighty percent of the dishes were his favorites, while the remaining twenty catered to Isabelle’s tastes.

Julian, twirling his fork, feigned offense. "Mom, your favoritism is reaching new heights! I requested specific dishes before leaving, but it seems you’ve completely ignored me. They say sons forget their mothers after marriage, but you’ve forgotten your own flesh and blood now that you have your godson. Truly heartbreaking!"

"You’ve had my cooking for over twenty years," Mrs. Montgomery retorted playfully. "Since Nathan doesn’t visit as often, of course I’ll spoil him. Don’t even compare yourself."

Her eyes softened as she turned to Nathan. "Nathan, these are all your favorites. Eat well."

"Thank you, Godmother," Nathan replied with a warm smile, picking up his fork.

"Nathan, you must try this!" Isabelle strategically sat beside him, offering him a bite with her fork. "I made this just for you."

Before her fork could reach his plate, Nathan intercepted it mid-air, freezing her smile.

"Thanks, but I’ll serve myself."
###Chapter 338

The young and stunning Isabelle Montgomery flushed crimson at Nathan Blackwood's words, her cheeks burning with embarrassment.

Julian Montgomery's brows furrowed. "Nathan, are you seriously upset that Isabelle tried to serve you with her own fork? She hasn't even used it yet, and she offered you the first bite." Protective as always, Julian stepped forward to shield his younger sister.

Isabelle quickly apologized. "I'm sorry, Nathan. I didn't think it through."

She hastily switched to a clean fork and attempted to place a piece of fish onto Nathan's plate, but he stopped her again.

"I can serve myself."

Isabelle pouted. "I haven't been back in years. Nathan, are you trying to push me away? We used to share ice cream when we were kids!"

"That was when we were children. You're not a child anymore," Nathan replied coolly, his gaze lingering on the food. He picked up a small piece of crab meat and chewed slowly.

Isabelle's heart clenched. Her expression darkened as she shoved the fish into her mouth, chewing with unnecessary force.

Meanwhile, Nathan surveyed the lavish spread before him, memories surfacing of the meals Evelyn Carter used to prepare for him. He knew exactly how much effort these dishes required—how she would spend entire afternoons in the kitchen, enduring the heat and smoke that left her face glistening, suppressing coughs. Yet, he had never once praised her.

Even if her cooking rivaled that of a five-star chef, Nathan had stubbornly refused to acknowledge it. And yet, every time he ate her food, he found himself craving more.

A sharp pang struck his chest as he recalled the hopeful glimmer in Evelyn's eyes, the way she'd watch him expectantly, only for her smile to falter when he remained silent.

But without fail, she'd always bounce back, flashing him that bright, determined grin.

"Next time, I'll do even better!"

Next time.

Would there even be a next time?

The thought made Nathan's appetite vanish. Even swallowing became difficult.

"Nathan," Isabelle spoke up after a brief silence, sensing that business might pique his interest. She propped her chin on her hand, blinking her large, doe-like eyes. "I heard Isabella Wang is arriving in Crestview soon. Are you planning a welcome banquet? It would be a great opportunity to promote the hotel—she is an international superstar, after all."

Nathan's striking eyes chilled slightly, though his expression remained composed. He despised discussing business during family meals, especially when outsiders pried into his company's affairs.

"Hmm."

"Can I help with anything?" Isabelle pressed eagerly.

Nathan dismissed her offer. "That won't be necessary."

Undeterred, Isabelle continued, desperate to impress him. "I could perform piano pieces for Isabella Wang and the guests! It's my specialty!"

Again, Nathan shut her down. "There's no need."

His frown deepened as he firmly refused. "You're the Montgomery heiress. It's beneath you to entertain guests like that. Professionals will handle the performances."

Isabelle's face fell. "So... you don't think I'm good enough?"

By now, Nathan had completely lost his patience.

He had only attended this dinner out of courtesy, not wanting to offend Mrs. Montgomery and Julian, but the evening was growing increasingly unbearable.

"Nathan, Isabelle is the protégé of a world-renowned pianist. She's more than qualified to perform at your banquet. Just let her do it," Julian interjected between bites.

"Yes, Nathan. She sees you as family—let her help you this once," Mrs. Montgomery added, ever the doting mother.

Isabelle clasped her hands together, her eyes pleading. "Nathan, I promise I'll play perfectly. I won't disappoint you!"

Nathan exhaled sharply and gave a reluctant nod.

After dinner, Nathan bid the Montgomerys farewell and left. Outside their estate, Oliver Sinclair intercepted him with urgent news.

"Mr. Blackwood, there's a problem. Your hotel has scheduled the same event date as Monarch Grand Hotels!"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Did Evelyn arrange a welcome banquet for Isabella Wang on the same day?"
###Chapter 339

"Mr. Blackwood, your brilliance is truly unparalleled!"

Oliver Sinclair wiped his brow nervously as he ventured, "Given Young Madam's... unpredictable methods and relentless determination, do you think she might actually succeed in stealing Isabella Laurent away? Perhaps we should—"

"What?" Nathan Blackwood cut him off sharply, his dark brows knitting together.

Oliver flashed a bright grin. "Why not let Evelyn have this one? It's just a wedding banquet, after all. A real gentleman shouldn't compete with a lady, especially considering your past—"

"Absolutely not."

Nathan's voice was ice. He frowned deeply. "Since negotiations with Alexa have stalled, Isabella is our only leverage. If Evelyn thought of targeting her, it means she's as desperate as we are. At this critical juncture, even the smallest advantage could tip the scales. I won't let her win. By any means necessary, Isabella Laurent will attend our event."

With that final decree, the imposing CEO strode into his luxury car, his expression unreadable.

Oliver stood frozen on the pavement, his face falling. Good grief. The man's harder than reinforced steel. How's someone this stubborn ever going to win her back?

Inside the car, Nathan leaned back against the leather seats and exhaled slowly. Should I have taken Oliver's advice? Let her have this victory?

From the divorce until now, Evelyn had outmaneuvered him at every turn—always one step ahead, always leaving him scrambling in her wake.

It startled him to realize the woman he'd once known as his gentle, uncomplicated wife had transformed into someone formidable. Brilliant. Ruthlessly strategic. With each passing day, she seemed further out of reach.

Nathan ached to best her just once, as if a single victory might bridge the chasm between them.

——

Late that night, Julian Montgomery headed to Velvet Lounge for drinks, leaving only Eleanor Montgomery and Isabelle at home. Isabelle slipped into her mother's bedroom, curling up on the silk duvet with practiced sweetness.

Recalling dinner, Eleanor sighed. "Isabelle, your behavior toward Nathan tonight was... excessive. You made him uncomfortable."

She pinched the bridge of her nose. "You're not a child anymore, and Nathan isn't the boy who played with you in the gardens. He's the CEO of Blackwood Industries now—every move he makes is scrutinized. You must be more careful. It's inappropriate for you to—"

"Mother." Isabelle sat up abruptly, her gaze sharp. "I wasn't acting childish. I don't see Nathan as a brother."

Eleanor blinked. "What?"

"Why do you think I turned down the Valmont Philharmonic? Why abandon my career in Silvercrest?" Isabelle's eyes glittered. "I came back for him. I intend to marry Nathan Blackwood."

"Have you lost your mind?!"

Eleanor shot upright, staring at her daughter in horror. "He's practically family!"

"Not by blood." Isabelle's smile turned feline at the thought of Nathan. "I've waited years for him to end things with Victoria. Now? Nothing stands in my way."

Watching her daughter's delusion, Eleanor felt a pang of dread.

"Mother, what's wrong?" Isabelle tilted her head. "Don't you want this for me?"

"It's not that..." Eleanor hesitated. "Nathan is exceptional, but he's not right for you. Your brother warned you—he's been married before. Isabelle, you're so pure-hearted. The Blackwoods are vipers. If you marry into that family—"

Isabelle nearly laughed. Pure? Please. Cassandra Blackwood's the naive one. If she became Nathan's wife, she'd have those women eating from her palm.

"Mother!" She squeezed Eleanor's hand. "I'm a Montgomery heiress. Our family rivals the Blackwoods. With you and Julian supporting me, who'd dare mistreat me?"

"But affection can't be forced! Even if you're willing, Nathan must—"

Isabelle's smile turned razor-sharp. "With your backing, I already have the advantage. Once I prove my worth—show him I'm not just Julian's little sister but a woman who can stand beside him—he'll have no choice but to notice me."

"Darling—"

"No arguments, Mother." Isabelle's voice hardened. "I will marry Nathan Blackwood. Or no one at all."
###Chapter 340

Three days later, Evelyn Carter and her team were preparing to arrive in Crestview. However, Theodore Winslow received shocking news from their agent—Isabella Wang had ultimately chosen to attend the wedding banquet hosted by Blackwood Industries.

In the entertainment room of the Monarch Grand Hotel, Theodore delivered this infuriating news to Evelyn. She was leisurely engaged in a game of billiards with Raymond Kingsley, her seventh brother, demonstrating professional-level precision with each shot, effortlessly sinking one ball after another.

"Ms. Carter! Something terrible has happened!" Theodore called out anxiously.

"Hush! It's match point!" Evelyn delicately pressed a slender finger to her lips, signaling him to stay quiet. This shot determined tonight's dinner—she couldn't afford to lose focus.

Theodore was at his wit's end. He wanted to rush her, but he didn't dare. Even if the sky were falling, he wouldn't interrupt Evelyn's moment of fun.

Click! Click!

Evelyn executed the final shot flawlessly, winning in spectacular fashion.

She let out a triumphant scream. "Yes!"

Grinning, she raised her cue in victory. Raymond, perched on the edge of the pool table, smirked at his sister, completely unbothered by his loss.

"Evelyn, your skills are improving," Raymond remarked.

Leaning gracefully against the cue, she playfully stuck out her tongue. "All thanks to your excellent teaching."

Dressed in a red satin spaghetti-strap dress, Evelyn had only taken two shots before one of the straps slipped down, revealing her porcelain-like shoulder—a sight particularly alluring.

Theodore's gaze involuntarily flickered toward her, and he swallowed hard.

Raymond noticed the not-so-innocent look in Theodore's eyes. His expression darkened instantly.

Casually, he stepped closer to Evelyn and adjusted the strap that had nearly slipped off. Clearing his throat, he said, "Even when you're having fun, you should be careful. This is acceptable in front of your brothers, but around other men, you can't be so bold."

His sharp eyes flicked toward Theodore.

As a seasoned detective, Raymond had an eagle-like gaze. Under his scrutiny, Theodore felt a chill run down his spine, as if his thoughts were being laid bare. He quickly averted his burning gaze elsewhere.

"Yes, big brother!" Evelyn's voice dripped with honeyed sweetness. "Theodore isn't a stranger. Besides, I haven't revealed anything. You're such a prude."

Raymond's eyebrow twitched. The way she called him big brother sent a tingling sensation through his chest. He hesitated, unable to bring himself to scold her.

"Theodore, what's the matter?" Evelyn turned, picked up a glass of red wine, and leaned against the pool table, taking a slow sip. Her charming eyes sparkled with carefree amusement.

"Ms. Carter, Isabella Wang has confirmed her attendance at Blackwood Industries' wedding banquet! She stood us up!" Theodore blurted nervously.

"Good." Evelyn took another sip.

"Good?! Nathan Blackwood intercepted our VIP, and you're calling it good?" Theodore's eyes widened in disbelief.

"Let me guess," Evelyn mused, swirling the wine in her glass. "In the next three days, Blackwood Industries will send invitations to every major celebrity in town. They'll publicize the banquet extensively—after all, an international superstar's first stay in Crestview is at their hotel. Free publicity."

Her eyes gleamed with satisfaction. "This move cements the Blackwood Hotel's supremacy in Crestview—maybe even the entire country. Whether it's the president or a superstar, anyone coming here will only stay there."

"So Isabella Wang chose them. That's a massive loss for us, isn't it?" Theodore frowned.

"Smooth sailing is boring." Evelyn smiled—a smile more intoxicating than the wine in her glass. "I love challenges that bring you to life, turning the tide against the wind. That's what makes it thrilling."

Theodore's heart skipped a beat. His boss's mischievous grin at that moment was breathtaking.

"Evelyn, it seems you already have a plan?" Raymond asked with a knowing smirk.

She nodded. "Theodore, proceed with the banquet preparations as scheduled."

"What? But our VIP isn't coming! What's the point?" Theodore's shoulders slumped. He felt they'd already lost to Nathan.

Evelyn's lips curled into a mysterious smile. "Who says it's pointless? The victor hasn't been decided yet. The prize may still fall into our hands."

Outside the Monarch Grand Hotel, Oliver Sinclair hid in a sleek Porsche, assigned to monitor Evelyn's every move. Just as he was dozing off from boredom, Theodore finally emerged, his expression grim.

Oliver smirked. After suffering under Nathan's orders these past few days, seeing Evelyn's loyal secretary equally miserable gave him a twisted sense of satisfaction.

Heh. Victory sure feels good.

Then—

"Madam."

A few seconds later, Evelyn stepped out, followed by Theodore and—

Wait. Who's that other man?!

Oliver snatched his binoculars, rubbing his eyes before scrutinizing the trio again.

Oh, damn. It really is another man!

"Let's go for barbecue!" Raymond casually slung an arm over Evelyn's shoulder.

"I want ribs, brisket, corn, baked beans, and mac and cheese!" Evelyn licked her crimson lips.

"Evelyn, that's enough food for an army."

"Classics! And extra sauce, please!"

"Might as well chug some beer while we're at it!"

The siblings laughed in unison and climbed into the car.

Oliver gulped, hands trembling as he lowered the binoculars.

Oh crap. It's over.

With shaky fingers, he snapped photos and sent a frantic message to his boss.

[Mr. Blackwood! SOS! Ms. Carter has a new love interest!]
###Chapter 341

Back at Blackwood Industries, Nathan Blackwood sat motionless in his executive chair, his piercing gaze fixed on the computer monitor. With each deliberate keystroke, a new image materialized - each frame featuring the same captivating subject: Evelyn Carter.

These surveillance photos, captured by Oliver Sinclair over the past week, showed Evelyn going about her daily routine. Originally tasked with gathering intelligence on Monarch Group's operations, Oliver had found Evelyn's security detail impenetrable, resulting in this collection of mundane yet intimate snapshots.

Nathan's fingers hovered over the keyboard as he cycled through the images repeatedly. The more he studied them, the more Evelyn's radiant smile seemed to leap from the screen. Had these been physical photographs, they would have worn thin from his constant handling.

The sudden vibration of his smartphone shattered the silence. Nathan blinked, as if waking from a trance, and reached for the device.

His expression darkened as he read the incoming messages. Without hesitation, he grabbed his tailored suit jacket and stormed out of the office.

Meanwhile, at an upscale grill house, Evelyn Carter was laughing with her younger brother Raymond Kingsley.

The siblings hadn't seen each other in months, and the reunion called for celebration. Empty wine glasses littered their table as they reminisced.

After several drinks, Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink. She leaned forward conspiratorially. "Raymond Kingsley, when are you going to find me a proper sister-in-law?"

"Not you too!" Raymond groaned, pouring mineral water into Evelyn's wine glass when she wasn't looking. "Mother's already hounding me about this. Between my dangerous job and crazy schedule, who has time for relationships?"

Evelyn pouted. "What's wrong with the Kingsley men? None of you want to settle down! I want nieces and nephews to spoil!"

Raymond chuckled. "Aren't seven overprotective brothers enough for you? What if we get married and stop pampering you?"

"That's exactly the problem!" Evelyn exclaimed, her words slightly slurred. "Remember in university when you bought out the entire campus chocolate supply? Every boy thought you were my boyfriend! You robbed me of my first love!"

Raymond winced at the memory. "Don't remind me! Mother caught me with all those chocolates and thought I was dating some girl. She had the principal monitor me until graduation!"

"You never told her they were for me?" Evelyn gasped.

"It was right before finals!" Raymond defended. "She would've had me transferred schools if she knew I was spoiling you instead of studying." He smirked. "Though I can't complain - it kept all those infatuated girls away after I accidentally won 'Most Eligible Bachelor.'"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Wait... you used me as your excuse to avoid admirers?" She flicked his forehead sharply.

Raymond laughed, rubbing the spot. "Seriously though, with my job, marriage would be cruel. My wife would essentially be a widow."

Evelyn nodded sagely. "Same."

"What about Alexander Whitmore?" Raymond suddenly asked. "At Sebastian's last dinner party, he couldn't take his eyes off you." He lowered his voice dramatically. "Though he looks a bit pale... you don't think he's sickly, do you?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink.

"Listen," Raymond continued seriously, "we Kingsleys don't need money, but we do need strong genetics. The family legacy depends on it."

"As long as he's not mentally unstable, I don't care about his complexion," Evelyn retorted, her blush deepening.

When they finally left the restaurant, Theodore Winslow stood waiting by the car. Seeing Evelyn leaning heavily on Raymond, he moved to assist.

"Don't touch her."

Raymond's arm tightened protectively around Evelyn as he blocked Theodore with his other arm. His voice turned icy. "I've got her. Keep your hands to yourself." Theodore stiffened, lips pressed into a thin line of embarrassment.
###Chapter 342

Raymond Kingsley was acutely aware of Theodore Winslow's hidden resentment toward him. Raymond believed every man who showed excessive interest in his sister Evelyn harbored ulterior motives.

"Raymond, you're being paranoid. Theo isn't some random stranger," Evelyn said with an exasperated sigh, rolling her eyes playfully.

"He may not be a stranger, but he's still a man," Raymond countered, his jaw tightening. His sharp gaze cut through Theodore like a blade. "You should hire a female assistant tomorrow. I don’t like the idea of you working so closely with a man."

Evelyn waved him off dismissively, her lips curving into an amused smirk. "Oh, please. You're such a suspicious detective. You see criminals everywhere."

"Vigilance never hurt anyone," Raymond shot back.

He helped Evelyn into the car and shut the door. As Theodore bowed slightly before turning to leave, Raymond stopped him with a firm grip on his shoulder.

"Wait."

"Is there something else, Mr. Kingsley?" Theodore asked, his expression carefully neutral.

"As Evelyn’s assistant, you're with her constantly. While you support her, remember to keep your distance," Raymond warned, his voice low and dangerous.

His piercing stare was glacial. "What isn’t yours will never be yours. Don’t overstep. Unlike my brothers, I won’t tolerate any nonsense. I was born skeptical, and I’ve seen enough darkness in this world to know better than to trust blindly."

Theodore inhaled sharply, his fingers curling into fists at his sides.

"To put it plainly—don’t even think about Evelyn. If you dare cross that line, I won’t hold back."

"Mr. Kingsley, I understand boundaries. But rules can govern actions, not feelings," Theodore retorted, struggling to keep his voice steady.

His eyes glistened with suppressed emotion as he finally voiced what had been festering inside. "I would never act inappropriately toward Ms. Evelyn because I genuinely admire and respect her. But you can’t demand that I stop loving her. Love isn’t a crime."

Raymond’s brow twitched slightly. Though he disliked Theodore, the man’s blunt honesty caught him off guard.

"Remember your words today."

"Hey! What’s taking so long? I’m exhausted!" Evelyn called from the car, lowering the window with an impatient frown.

"Coming, Ms. Evelyn." Theodore turned back, offering her a warm smile.

"Evelyn, call me when you get home," Raymond said, making a phone gesture with his hand.

She flashed him an OK sign before waving goodbye as the car pulled away.

Raymond watched them leave, his smile fading the moment they were out of sight. His sharp eyes scanned the opposite side of the street before he turned and strode off.

Across the road, Oliver Sinclair’s sleek Porsche was parked inconspicuously. He had just sent a location to Nathan Blackwood when, within seconds of Evelyn’s departure, both she and Theodore vanished.

"Strange… Where did they go?" Oliver muttered under his breath.

Before he could react, the car door was wrenched open violently. A powerful hand seized his collar, dragging him out effortlessly as if he weighed nothing.

"Hey! What the hell—?!"

Oliver’s breath hitched when he saw Raymond looming over him like an avenging shadow. Panic surged through him. "You can’t do this! There are laws in this country! I’ll report you!"

"Save your breath."

Raymond’s expression darkened as he pulled out his badge and shoved it in Oliver’s face. "The police are here to deal with scum like you who slip through the cracks."

Oliver’s blood ran cold, his mind reeling.

Meanwhile, Evelyn yawned in the car, her eyelids growing heavy.

Just then, her phone rang.

"Raymond? I’m not home yet. What’s—"

"Evelyn, do you know Oliver Sinclair?" Raymond’s rough voice cut through the line.

Her drowsiness vanished instantly. She sat bolt upright.

"What’s going on? Why are you asking about him?"

"Evelyn, where did you meet this creep? His phone is filled with photos he took of you without your knowledge! I caught him red-handed!"
###Chapter 343

Nathan Blackwood arrived at the steakhouse only to find Evelyn Carter and Theodore Winslow had already left.

His jaw clenched as he recalled the photos of Evelyn with that mysterious man. His expression was icy, but inside, he was barely holding himself together.

Amid the bustling restaurant, he felt nothing but humiliation—self-inflicted, yet unbearable.

And beneath it all, worry gnawed at him.

Evelyn was out at this hour, dining with some stranger in a place like this. Did she have no sense of danger?

His phone buzzed—an unknown number. He exhaled sharply before answering.

"Who is this?"

"Mr. Blackwood?" A robotic female voice responded.

"Yes."

"This is the Crestview West District Police Station. May I ask your relationship with Mr. Oliver Sinclair?"

Nathan's brows furrowed. "He's my assistant. What happened?"

"Please come to the station immediately. We'll explain when you arrive."

The night had taken a surreal turn.

His Lamborghini sped through the streets, his mind racing. He couldn't fathom how Oliver—the most harmless man he knew—had ended up in police custody.

As Nathan strode into the station, he collided with a tall, broad-shouldered man in a black leather jacket.

Recognition struck like lightning.

This was the same man from the photos—the one who had been cozying up to Evelyn.

Raymond Kingsley's sharp gaze locked onto him, assessing, dissecting.

A cold smirk curled on Raymond's lips. "Nathan Blackwood, I presume? Here to bail out your assistant?"

Nathan's eyes darkened with hostility. "What business is it of yours?"

Raymond chuckled. "Interesting question."

His smirk turned mocking. "Oliver Sinclair is here because of me. So, it's very much my business."

Nathan's composure cracked. "Is this revenge?"

"Revenge?"

"My assistant exposed your affair with Evelyn. Is this your petty retaliation?"

Blinded by fury, Nathan failed to realize the man before him wasn’t some random playboy—he was a seasoned detective.

Raymond, instead of taking offense, laughed. "It's a miracle you run a corporation with that level of intellect."

Nathan's teeth ground together. "You're a gigolo bold enough to strut around a police station, framing my assistant for exposing you. I'll admit, I'm impressed by your audacity."

Raymond blinked, stunned.

Gigolo?!

Did he really look like some kept man?

Raymond studied Nathan. So, this was the pretty boy who broke Evelyn's heart. Thick brows, striking eyes, a solid frame beneath that tailored suit. He looked like he could throw a punch.

Just then, two officers passed by and saluted Raymond.

"Captain Kingsley!"

Raymond nodded in acknowledgment.

Nathan froze, his breath hitching.

This man wasn’t a gigolo.

He was a cop.

Captain Kingsley.

A Kingsley.

His mind reeled.

Those sharp eyes, the strong jaw—they were eerily familiar.

"Raymond!"

A woman's voice cut through the tension, sending another shock through Nathan.

How many sons did Harrison Kingsley have?

Didn’t the old man worry about inheritance wars later?
###Chapter 344

Nathan Blackwood turned slowly, his breath catching when he found Evelyn Carter standing mere steps behind him. Her piercing gaze held an arctic chill that made his blood run cold.

"Evelyn, why are you here?" Raymond Kingsley immediately abandoned Nathan and rushed to his sister's side. "I told you I'd handle this. You should be resting at home."

"No. This is something I need to settle myself."

Evelyn's voice was steady, but her eyes never left Nathan's. The detachment in them carved deeper than any blade could.

After the divorce, she had treated him with nothing but frosty indifference. He had once resented it—now, it terrified him. The thought of her regarding him as nothing more than a stranger sent a tremor through his chest.

He would have preferred her fury—her curses, her slaps, anything but this glacial distance.

"Evelyn—" Nathan hesitated, her name barely a whisper on his lips.

"Let's talk outside, Nathan."

Her tone left no room for argument. With one last icy glance, she turned and strode ahead. Nathan's gaze clung to the elegant sway of her figure, his feet itching to follow—until Raymond yanked him back.

"Listen here, you clueless bastard," Raymond hissed, fingers digging into Nathan's arm. "This is a police station. If you so much as breathe wrong near my sister, I'll cuff you myself."

Nathan exhaled sharply, forcing down the storm inside him. "As her brother, you should know exactly what she means to me."

Raymond scoffed, a humorless smirk twisting his lips. "Oh, I know. And from my years in homicide, I can tell you—men who hire stalkers to trail their ex-wives? They're either psychopaths or future murderers. Neither ends well."

Nathan had no retort.

They ended up in a secluded courtyard behind the precinct, the dim glow of distant streetlights casting long shadows. Privacy was crucial—both were public figures, and this conversation demanded discretion.

Evelyn faced him, arms crossed, the moonlight painting her in silver.

"Nathan—"

"Have you been drinking?"

He didn't let her finish. In two strides, he closed the distance between them, his broad frame eclipsing the light. Evelyn stiffened as he tilted his head, inhaling the faint scent of alcohol clinging to her hair.

His voice dropped low. "This is strong liquor. Since when do you drink? You couldn't even handle karaoke cocktails. In three years of marriage, I never saw you touch a drop."

Her laugh was brittle. "I've always had a high tolerance. You just never cared to notice." She stepped back, her spine pressing against the cold brick wall.

"Because you never showed me the real you." Nathan's jaw tightened. "You hid everything."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Ah, deflection. Classic Nathan."

Her crimson lips curved, and the sight sent heat coiling low in his gut. He clenched his fists, fighting the urge to close the space between them again.

"Remember the man you were back then?" she continued, voice dripping with disdain. "Even when I tried, you never listened. You found me irritating—why would I bare my soul just to be rejected again?"

Each word was a knife, twisting deeper.

So she had concealed herself—not out of deceit, but to avoid his disdain. Just like how Victoria Sterling had played the innocent ingenue, feigning fragility to manipulate him.

The realization struck like lightning.

Victoria's "love" had been a calculated performance. But Evelyn? She had only ever tried to be what she thought he wanted.

The ache in his chest was unbearable.

His eyes burned. Before he could speak, Evelyn cut in, her tone glacial.

"Let's be clear, Nathan. I know why you sent Oliver to spy on me. Isabella Wang's wedding is coming up, and I'm your biggest competition. Fine—business is business. But Salvador Corp is already ahead. Isabella chose your venue. So why have Oliver tailing me? Why take photos of Raymond?" Her gaze sharpened. "Isn't that crossing a line?"
###Chapter 345

"You're utterly shameless." Evelyn spat the words through clenched teeth.

Harrison Kingsley and his wives had shielded their children with unwavering devotion. It was this protective cocoon that granted them the liberty to chase their aspirations.

In the past, Evelyn had been blinded by love. For Nathan, she had sacrificed everything—abandoned her family, trampled her dignity—all for the laughable illusion of true love.

Now, sober and reunited with the Kingsley family, Evelyn was determined to embrace her role as the heiress of Monarch Group. This wasn’t merely about atonement; it was her vow to ensure her siblings could pursue their passions without restraint.

She refused to let her family’s peace be shattered.

Yet here stood Nathan, shamelessly pushing her boundaries, testing the last shred of her patience.

"Shameless?" The word cut through Nathan like a blade. His eyes darkened, burning with an intensity that bordered on desperation.

Without warning, he seized her, pulling her against his chest. His breath, warm and uneven, brushed her lips as he demanded, "If I'm so shameless, Evelyn, then look at me. Why arrest Oliver? Is this your way of punishing me?"

At the mention of revenge, Evelyn's own eyes flared. His audacity infuriated her. He was the one who had ordered Oliver to stalk her. Raymond had caught Oliver red-handed, with undeniable proof. Instead of an apology, Nathan had the gall to twist this on her.

"If you hadn’t orchestrated this, why would Raymond randomly arrest and detain Oliver?" Nathan’s voice dripped with bitterness. A storm of emotions churned in his chest, suffocating him. "Evelyn, did one victory against you earn my eternal hatred? Is that why you conspired with your brothers to destroy me and my company?"

"What’s wrong?" Her lips curled into a taunting smirk. "Jealous? My brothers adore me. What can I do if they insist on defending me?"

"Evelyn!" Nathan’s temples pulsed violently.

"You have your precious sisters. Why shouldn’t I have my brothers? If it bothers you so much, fight back. Rally your little sisters against me!"

This wasn’t like her. But tonight, the alcohol had loosened her tongue, and she refused to hold back.

"Little sisters?" Nathan frowned, confusion flickering across his face. "What are you talking about?"

Evelyn scoffed, pressing her palms against his chest to shove him away. "Are you playing dumb? I don’t have time for a disgusting man like you."

Nathan’s long lashes lowered, shadows dancing in his obsidian eyes.

Memories surged—of the night outside the karaoke bar when she had vomited on him, accused him of being a thug, and nearly landed him in jail. That evening, he had stripped off his ruined shirt and stood before the mirror, stunned to find red scratches marring his chest—marks left by her furious nails.

Now, as her hands pressed against him again, that same electric heat coursed through him, igniting a fire in his chest.

His gaze darkened, emotions swirling dangerously.

"I’ve said all I needed to say. From now on, keep your people away from me. Or next time, jail will be the least of their worries."

"Evelyn, you’re not leaving." His voice was rough, edged with desperation.

"This is a police station! Act like a thug again, and I’ll call Raymond to arrest you!" Her cheeks flushed with anger.

"Still, you’re not going anywhere."

"Why?!"

"Explain to me—which sisters are you talking about?"

Nathan’s brow furrowed as he pressed her. "I only have two sisters, Cassandra and Eleanor. Who else are you referring to?"

Evelyn bit her lip, fury boiling inside her. She wanted to slap him.

Just then, Nathan’s pupils contracted. In a flash, he twisted, blocking a vicious strike from behind. Years of military training had honed his reflexes to perfection.

Evelyn gasped.

Before she could react, Nathan was already locked in combat with Raymond. Their fists and kicks flew with terrifying precision, making her heart race.

Nathan moved like lightning, his attacks ruthless.

In this clash between a former elite soldier and a hotheaded detective, Raymond was clearly outmatched. Among Evelyn’s brothers, only Sebastian and Maxwell could rival Nathan in a fight.
###Chapter 346

Nathan's fist was milliseconds away from connecting with Raymond's face when Evelyn's panicked scream cut through the air. "Don't touch my brother!"

Nathan's entire body froze mid-strike, his knuckles hovering just inches from Raymond's jaw. Seizing the opportunity, Raymond swung with full force, landing a brutal punch on the corner of Nathan's mouth.

A sharp grunt escaped Nathan as the metallic tang of blood flooded his tongue. The impact sent him stumbling back a single step, but he barely swayed.

Evelyn's fists clenched at her sides, her eyes wide with disbelief.

She hadn’t expected him to actually listen to her. He had stopped—just like that—letting Raymond strike him without resistance.

Raymond immediately pulled Evelyn close, glaring at Nathan’s split lip. "You filthy bastard! If you ever lay a finger on my sister again, I’ll beat you so badly your own mother won’t recognize you—cop badge or not!"

Yet, a quiet dread coiled in Evelyn’s chest. Nathan had held back. If he hadn’t, Raymond would be the one lying broken on the ground right now.

In the end, she chose not to press the issue of him spying on her. After three years of marriage, she knew exactly the kind of man Nathan Blackwood was.

Nathan dragged Oliver back to the car. The secretary’s head hung low, his shoulders slumped in defeat.

"I’m sorry, Mr. Blackwood. I’m useless. That idiot cop caught me and caused trouble for you—"

"Forget it," Nathan cut him off, wincing as he touched his throbbing lip.

"Mr. Blackwood! You’re hurt!" Oliver’s eyes widened at the blood staining Nathan’s mouth. He looked ready to burst into tears. "Did that bastard cop hit you?! How dare he assault an innocent civilian?! I’ll file a complaint—"

"Innocent civilian?" Nathan’s mind flashed to the way he had pinned Evelyn against the wall earlier. Nothing about that had been innocent.

"Drop it. Don’t make things worse."

"But—"

"That ‘idiot cop’ is Evelyn’s seventh brother. One of Harrison Kingsley’s many sons," Nathan said, finally placing the resemblance.

"Seventh?!" Oliver gasped. "How many brothers does the young madam have?! If they all come after you one by one, this will never end!"

Nathan leaned back, closing his eyes as he wiped the blood from his lips. A deep sigh escaped him. He was starting to wonder the same thing. At this rate, he’d prefer they all attack him at once—this piecemeal vengeance was exhausting.

Just as his frustration peaked, his phone buzzed.

Nathan pulled it out, scowling at Isabelle Montgomery’s name flashing on the screen.

"Isabelle. What do you want?" His voice was ice.

"Nathan!" Her sickly sweet voice slithered into his ear.

His eyes snapped open.

Suddenly, Evelyn’s words echoed in his mind.

"You have so many sisters. Why can’t I have a few good brothers?"

So that’s what she’d meant.

A jolt of adrenaline shot through him, straightening his spine.

On the other end, Isabelle prattled on. "I’ve prepared the repertoire for Isabella Laurent’s wedding banquet in three days. Would you like to preview it?"

Nathan didn’t hear a word. His mind was too busy dissecting Evelyn’s hidden meaning.

She cared about his interactions with other women.

Was she… jealous?

"Nathan? Are you even listening?" Isabelle cooed.

"Stop." His voice dropped dangerously.

"What?"

"I’m not your brother. Don’t call me like we’re family."

Isabelle faltered. "Nathan… what do you mean? You don’t like when I call you?"

"No. Watch your mouth next time."

He ended the call before she could respond.
###Chapter 347

Three days vanished like a fleeting dream.

Isabella Wang finally arrived in Crestview as planned, drawing attention from across the globe.

On the evening of the gala, Cassandra Blackwood had chosen a breathtaking amethyst haute couture gown for herself. She had spent hours curling her hair and perfecting her makeup, ensuring she exuded her signature sophistication.

Naturally, Penelope Whitmore also attended in her finest. Her hair was styled in an intricate updo, showcasing a pair of dazzling emerald earrings and a nearly two-inch-wide imperial jade pendant. It looked as though she had draped an entire mansion’s worth of wealth around her neck.

"Mother, I recall you own an even more exquisite piece of jade than this one, don’t you? Why aren’t you wearing that instead?" Cassandra asked, tilting her head curiously.

"Don’t bring it up. Just thinking about it makes my chest ache!"

Penelope clenched her teeth, gripping her pendant tightly. "It’s all because of that wretched Victoria Sterling! I have no idea what the Sterling family has been doing to rack up millions in debt!"

"I didn’t have liquid funds readily available, and the authorities were breathing down my neck. The boutique hasn’t seen a single customer in two months either. I had no choice but to part with that jade piece and sell it to help settle some of the Sterlings’ debts!"

"My goodness! You’re far too generous. If it were me, I’d be sobbing. That was a birthday gift from Father!"

Cassandra winced in sympathy. Then, with a frown, she asked, "But I truly don’t understand, Mother. Why are you helping the Sterling family? Wouldn’t it be better to let those rotten relatives fend for themselves?"

"Hmph! If only I could."

Penelope’s voice dripped with venom. Back when she had groomed Victoria to cozy up to Nathan, she had been overly ambitious, putting all her eggs in one basket. Never had she imagined her own schemes would backfire, leaving her with nothing but failure.

Now, not only had she failed to manipulate Nathan, but the pawn she had carefully cultivated had turned around and blackmailed her.

Recently, Victoria had tasted the sweet thrill of extorting her aunt. Just the day before, she had called Penelope from Silvercrest, demanding more money. Penelope had been so furious she nearly considered hiring an assassin to eliminate her.

But killing Victoria was an absolute last resort—one she wouldn’t entertain unless absolutely necessary. So, she had promised Victoria that she would soon find an opportunity to collaborate again, allowing her to return to Crestview. That was the only way she could keep that despicable girl in check.

"Mother, how do I look in this dress?"

Cassandra twirled happily, the amethyst evening gown swaying gracefully around her. She had chosen it after seeing how dashing Julian Montgomery looked in a violet shirt. Wearing this, she felt as though they were matching. "Tonight, I must be absolutely radiant. I can’t afford to embarrass our family!"

"The undisputed star tonight is Isabella Wang, an international icon. Your chances of outshining anyone are slim. Focus your efforts on Julian instead. Your attention should be on him, not competing with other women. What’s the point of looking more beautiful than them if Julian doesn’t spare you a second glance? The doors of the Montgomery family won’t open for you!"

To Penelope, Victoria was a lost cause, and Eleanor had always been a disappointment. Cassandra was her last hope—the one who wouldn’t disgrace their family. She had pinned all her ambitions on Cassandra, doing everything in her power to ensure she married into a prestigious family. A well-married daughter would only make her path to seizing control of Blackwood Industries smoother.

"Mother, don’t worry. This time, I will absolutely become Julian’s wife!" Cassandra declared, puffing out her chest with confidence.

Penelope arched a brow. "Oh? Do you have a plan?"

"Mother, Julian’s younger sister, Isabelle, has just returned from Valmont. She promised to help me! You know how much Julian dotes on her. With her support, I’m certain I can become her sister-in-law!" Cassandra grew more animated as she spoke, as if she already had one foot inside the Montgomery estate.

"Isabelle?" Penelope’s delicate brows furrowed as she recalled the times Julian used to bring a little girl to Cliffside Manor to visit Nathan. That child had been clingy—and seemed rather fond of Nathan as well.

"Well, nothing in this world comes for free. Aren’t you afraid of being used?" Penelope lounged on the sofa, idly flicking her crimson nails. "Isabelle wouldn’t help you out of the goodness of her heart. She must have set conditions, didn’t she?"

"Mother! No wonder Father adores you. You’re so sharp!" Cassandra sat beside her, adjusting the heavy fabric of her gown. "Isabelle is interested in Nathan, so her condition is to marry him."

"What? Absolutely not!" Penelope’s voice turned shrill. "Isabelle is a Montgomery. If she marries Nathan, that bastard will gain even more power within Blackwood Industries!"

"If that happens, I’ll lose any foothold I have left!"
###Chapter 348

"But Mother, I could marry into the Montgomery family instead. It would benefit you just as much!" Cassandra's face paled at her mother's violent reaction.

Penelope remained silent, lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes glinting with something dark. After a moment, she asked, "What's the situation between Isabelle and Nathan?"

"There hasn't been much progress. From what Isabelle hinted, Nathan still seems hung up on that little tramp, Evelyn. She doesn’t stand a chance," Cassandra replied with a sneer.

Penelope smirked. "Darling, don’t you see? This is the perfect opportunity to drive a wedge between Nathan and Julian!"

Cassandra blinked. "Mother, what do you mean?"

Penelope flicked her daughter’s forehead in frustration. "Julian is the sole heir of the Montgomery Group. Even though his grandfather still holds power, Julian has already inherited a significant portion of shares from his father. The company will be his one day!"

She leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "If we use Isabelle to create tension between Julian and Nathan, it’ll be far more effective than forcing a marriage. I know Nathan—he’s stubborn. If he doesn’t want something, no one can make him take it. Even if Isabelle doesn’t end up with him, the damage to their friendship will be irreversible. They’ll never be the same again!"

Understanding dawned on Cassandra’s face, and she gazed at her mother with newfound admiration.

Just then, a soft knock interrupted them.

"Come in!" Penelope smoothed her expression, masking the venom in her eyes.

The door creaked open, and Eleanor shuffled in, clutching a worn teddy bear.

At the sight of her sister, Cassandra’s resentment flared. She wished she could tear both Eleanor and that hideous stuffed animal to pieces.

"Eleanor? What do you want?" Penelope asked coolly.

"M-Mother…" Eleanor kept her head low, fingers tightening around the bear. "C-Can I go to the banquet tonight?"

Both Penelope and Cassandra froze. Eleanor had never asked for anything before—this was a first.

Cassandra smirked, her voice dripping with mockery. "Oh, dear sister, has your innocent act finally cracked? Did you hear Julian would be there? Couldn’t resist throwing yourself at him again, could you? After what happened last time, I thought you’d have some shame."

"I-I didn’t!" Eleanor denied hastily, pushing away the memory of that humiliating encounter in the garden.

"Eleanor, luck won’t save you forever. And let’s not forget—you’re mentally unstable. Do you really want Julian to witness one of your episodes?" Cassandra rolled her eyes in disgust.

Eleanor’s face drained of color.

"Eleanor, it’s best if you stay home tonight," Penelope said, her tone final. "And about what happened between you and Julian before… I’ll let it slide. But from now on, don’t interfere with your sister’s plans. Or else. Understood?"

"Mother! I-I just want to meet Isabella Laurent! I love her films!" Eleanor pleaded, tears welling in her eyes.

"Who would believe such a pathetic excuse?" Cassandra scoffed. "Mother, don’t fall for it. She might look harmless, but she’s scheming for Julian!"

"Eleanor, don’t get in your sister’s way. You’ve caused enough trouble already. No more. Understand?" Penelope’s voice was icy, as if Eleanor were nothing more than a nuisance.

Eleanor stood frozen, head bowed, tears slipping silently down her cheeks. The rejection from her mother and the cruelty from her sister made her feel like an outsider in her own family.

She was the daughter with the broken mind—the one who brought them shame.

An unwanted burden.

An invisible ghost.
###Chapter 349

The moment Isabella Laurent set foot in Crestview, the media erupted into a frenzy.

Combined with the Blackwood family's high-profile status, headlines for the past three days had been dominated by the international superstar and her choice of accommodation.

During this time, the Blackwood name suffered a blow in public perception. While any publicity could be considered good publicity, the Blackwood Hotel found itself in an especially precarious position—unable to afford further damage to its reputation.

For decades, the Blackwood Hotel had maintained an impeccable standing as a premier luxury brand, not just in Crestview but across the nation. It had been the preferred destination for dignitaries from politics, business, arts, and sports. Even the former president of Valmont had exclusively stayed at the Blackwood during his visits to Crestview.

Yet, over the past six months, a string of scandals had shattered the hotel’s once-pristine image. Now, whenever people mentioned the Blackwood Hotel, the first things that came to mind were Nathan Blackwood’s marital drama and Victoria Sterling’s disgrace.

Reputation took years to build but could crumble overnight.

Recognizing the urgency, Nathan poured significant resources into securing Isabella Laurent’s stay, determined to restore the Blackwood’s tarnished prestige. In this battle, he wanted victory more than Evelyn ever had.

At exactly 6:00 p.m., the hotel’s grand lobby buzzed with journalists and starstruck fans, all eager for a glimpse of Isabella. A lavish red carpet stretched across the entrance, amplifying the evening’s grandeur.

"I’ve been Isabella’s biggest fan for years! I’ve watched every single one of her films! After a decade, I’m finally seeing her in person!"

"In all of Crestview, the only hotel worthy of Isabella is the Blackwood! Monarch Grand Hotels can’t even compare—their reputation, amenities, and service don’t stand a chance!"

"Still, the Blackwood’s recent actions have been questionable…"

"Regardless, it remains the pioneer of Crestview’s hospitality industry! Isabella choosing to stay here proves its unmatched excellence!"

The bodyguard swung open the door of the sleek limousine.

The star of the evening, Isabella Laurent, stepped out to thunderous cheers.

With a striking blend of Asian, French, and Italian heritage, Isabella possessed cascading dark curls and mesmerizing almond-shaped eyes. Her statuesque 1.76-meter frame ensured she stood out effortlessly in any crowd.

Unprepared for the overwhelming enthusiasm of Crestview’s fans, the usually composed superstar softened, offering a rare smile and wave to the ecstatic crowd.

"Isabella! I grew up watching your movies!"

"How does she look even more stunning in person?!"

Guided by her manager and bodyguard, Isabella made her way inside, bypassing the chaos for a private elevator to the banquet hall.

Outside, Nathan and Oliver Sinclair awaited her arrival. The moment she appeared, Nathan stepped forward with effortless grace, extending a hand.

"Ms. Laurent, welcome to Crestview."

Tonight, Nathan was immaculate in a tailored four-piece suit, exuding an aura of power and sophistication that matched the superstar’s own magnetism.

"Mr. Blackwood." Isabella returned the handshake with equal poise.

"First time in Crestview—how are you finding it?"

"My mother was born here," she replied, her voice warm. "In a way, this city is part of my roots. Even though it’s my first visit, the moment I stepped off the plane, I felt like I belonged."

Nathan’s effortless charm dissolved any initial tension, and soon, the two were walking into the banquet hall, engaged in easy conversation.

Inside, the air hummed with the presence of high society, perfumed with the scent of wealth and prestige. Isabella’s entrance sent a ripple of excitement through the room—even A-list celebrities considered rushing over for a photo.

After all, Isabella was a figure usually seen only at events like the Oscars.

Nearly every woman in attendance couldn’t resist stealing glances at Nathan. With the obstacle of Victoria Sterling gone, Crestview’s elite socialites and heiresses were now vying for the coveted position of becoming the next Mrs. Blackwood.

Nathan was, without question, the most eligible bachelor in the city.

Meanwhile, Penelope Whitmore and Cassandra Blackwood stood to the side, their expressions darkening as they clutched their champagne glasses. Despite being part of the Blackwood family, they had been relegated to the background.

"Mother, we’re Blackwoods too. Why should we let Nathan steal the spotlight?" Cassandra muttered bitterly.

Penelope’s jaw tightened.

As the wife of Blackwood Industries’ chairman and a former actress, Penelope was accustomed to being the center of attention. She refused to be ignored.

With a practiced smile, she sauntered toward Nathan and Isabella, her hips swaying.

"Ms. Laurent, I’ve heard so much about you. You truly exceed expectations."

Isabella glanced briefly at Nathan, her expression unreadable.
###Chapter 350

"I am Penelope Whitmore, wife of Chairman Leonard Blackwood." Penelope announced with an air of superiority, her chin lifted imperiously.

"Nathan, I don't comprehend her words, but there's no necessity for translation. I've no interest in learning her identity," Isabella replied dismissively in flawless French, continuing her animated conversation with Nathan without sparing Penelope a glance.

Penelope's grasp of French allowed her to understand barely a third of their exchange. As she prepared to reintroduce herself in French, Nathan's lips curved into an amused smile as he told Isabella, "Precisely my thought. Why bother introducing insignificant individuals to you?"

The cutting remark left Penelope utterly bewildered. Suddenly, titters of laughter erupted around them, and the surrounding whispers became painfully clear.

"Did you see how Isabella just dismissed the Blackwood matriarch? She's absolutely fearless! I thought it was just her stage persona, but she's genuinely this bold!"

"This is priceless! Isabella Wang hails from Silvercrest. Why would she care about Crestview's business politics or some corporate chairman's wife?"

"Exactly! Penelope's posturing means nothing to someone like Isabella!"

The mocking comments made Penelope's face flush crimson before draining to pale. The fine lines around her eyes deepened with tension. Too prideful to retreat, she forced a brittle smile. "Ms. Wang, as you're aware, our Blackwood Hotel and Monarch Grand Hotels have always been competitors. Your presence tonight honors us greatly. As the lady of Blackwood Industries, I'm deeply flattered."

Nathan's expression remained icy. "Lady of Blackwood Industries?" The self-aggrandizing title nearly made him scoff aloud.

The atmosphere grew palpably tense. Oliver quickly translated Penelope's words to Isabella, hoping to stir conflict.

"No, there seems to be a misunderstanding," Isabella corrected after listening. "Both Monarch Grand Hotels and Blackwood Hotels are exceptional establishments. My attendance tonight isn't about which hotel is superior, but because Nathan's character and actions have deeply impressed me."

The verbal slap made Penelope's cheeks burn. Isabella might appear aloof, but she was razor-sharp. Agreeing would have meant disparaging Monarch Group, one of the world's Fortune 500 companies. Isabella was far too clever to fall into such an obvious trap.

As tension thickened, the banquet hall doors swung open dramatically. Isabelle Montgomery glided in, her million-dollar Swarovski-encrusted pink gown shimmering like a blooming peony.

"Isn't that Sebastian Laurent's protégé?"

"She's not just a pianist - she's Julian Montgomery's younger sister! The Montgomery Group heiress!"

"Julian's sister? Does that make her my future sister-in-law?"

"Then who's my future sister-in-law? Cassandra? Ugh, I can't stand that woman. She's insufferable."

Across the room, Cassandra sneezed abruptly.

Isabelle's entrance made Cassandra's eyes dart around like radar, desperately seeking Julian. Her disappointment was palpable - their relationship clearly lacked depth.

Noticing the crowd's attention shifting from Isabella to herself, Isabelle swelled with pride. She'd worked tirelessly to convince Nathan to let her perform tonight, determined to establish her own identity beyond being "Julian's sister" in Crestview's elite circles.

With practiced grace, she approached Nathan, lifting her gown's hem. His indifferent gaze made her falter. Suddenly, sharp, confident heel clicks echoed from the entrance.

The familiar sound made Nathan's breath hitch.

His entire body tensed as his gaze locked onto the doorway, his pulse suddenly erratic.
###Chapter 351

The towering double doors of the banquet hall framed Evelyn Carter's slender figure. From her vantage point, Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze appeared to be locked onto her alone.

"Nathan!" Evelyn's heart fluttered as she quickened her pace toward him.

Suddenly, the air thickened with the intoxicating fragrance of Damask roses - passionate, unapologetic, and faintly dangerous.

Click. Click. Click!

The sharp staccato of stiletto heels echoed through the hall as a striking figure swept past Evelyn, making her pulse race. The woman's commanding aura was so potent it seemed to steal the oxygen from the room.

Every guest stood transfixed, especially Nathan, who remained frozen like a statue. His obsidian-dark eyes burned into the icy perfection of Evelyn's delicate features.

Her elegantly arched brows framed a face as cold as winter, yet her crimson lips moved like dancing flames, setting Nathan's heart ablaze.

Evelyn's tailored black suit accentuated her understated sophistication. Yet her breathtaking beauty made her impossible to ignore, effortlessly commanding attention in the crowded room.

Murmurs rippled through the gathering as guests recognized the unexpected arrival. Penelope Whitmore and Cassandra Blackwood visibly paled at the uninvited guest's dramatic entrance.

A hushed exclamation broke the tension.

"That's Harrison Kingsley's daughter! She was featured in Vogue and Forbes last month - the new GM of Monarch Grand Hotels!"

"Yes! Evelyn Carter! The woman who's been challenging Nathan Blackwood at every turn!"

"Look at those eyes - pure steel. She's every inch the corporate queen. The way she carries herself - like royalty!"

"Honestly, they'd make a formidable power couple. Why fight when they could rule together?"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the gossip, though the last comment inexplicably softened his expression. The idea pleased him in ways he couldn't explain.

As Evelyn eclipsed Isabelle Montgomery completely, Isabelle's nails dug into her palms. The edges of her vision turned red with rage, her entire body trembling with barely contained fury.

But what shattered Isabelle completely was the raw hunger in Nathan's gaze as it followed Evelyn's every move. In all her years knowing him, his eyes had always been impenetrable pools of darkness. Never had she seen him look at any woman with such undisguised desire. Did he still love Evelyn? Was that why he couldn't look away?

"Ms. Wang, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs like velvet-wrapped steel. "I hope you don't mind my unexpected appearance."

She stood before them with regal composure, her scarlet lips curving into a smile that didn't reach her frosty eyes.

"Your presence is always... stimulating, Ms. Carter." Nathan's response carried layers of unspoken meaning, his lips quirking slightly. "Had I known you were coming-"

Evelyn's smile widened, sharp as a blade. "Why bother with formalities? You know perfectly well I'm not here for pleasantries, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's handsome features darkened instantly.

Oliver Sinclair wiped his brow nervously, fingers flying across his phone screen to alert security.

[Oliver: Code red! How did she get in?!]

[Security: Apologies, sir! She bypassed all checkpoints-]

[Oliver: Unacceptable! Find out how and remove her immediately!]
[Security: Yes sir! Mobilizing team now!]
###Chapter 352

[Nathan: Have you lost your damn mind?! Evelyn is the daughter of Fairhaven's most powerful man, Harrison Kingsley. She's also someone Mr. Blackwood deeply cares about! If you lay a finger on her, Mr. Blackwood will skin you alive! Stay alert and report anything suspicious immediately!]

Oh my God!

Isabella Wang suddenly gasped, her eyes widening in awe. "Ms. Kingsley, the brooch you're wearing—is that Aurora's Tear, Alexa's legendary masterpiece?"

"Yes, it is." Evelyn smiled faintly.

With Evelyn's breathtaking beauty stealing the spotlight, no one had noticed the exquisite yellow diamond brooch pinned to her dress—Aurora's Tear, the gold-winning piece from the International Jewelry Design Awards.

"Jewelry designed by Alexa?! Unbelievable! I'd kill just to touch it!"

"Didn't you read the headlines? This brooch is valued at over a billion dors! The 10-carat yellow diamond alone is worth tens of millions. It's a holy grail for collectors!"

"Only the daughter of Fairhaven's wealthiest man could afford such extravagance!"

"That jade pendant Penelope is wearing is expensive too, but it's nothing compared to Alexa's work."

Penelope's face burned with humiliation. She clenched her teeth, suppressing a cough.

Nothing?!

Leonard had gifted her that imperial green jadeite—the most valuable piece in her collection—yet these people dared call it nothing?!

In her heart, she cursed Victoria and the Sterling family. If she hadn't bailed them out of debt, she wouldn't be suffering this humiliation tonight.

"Ms. Kingsley, I've been searching for Aurora's Tear for years. After seeing it at an exhibition two years ago, I couldn't forget its brilliance. I never imagined it would be in your possession!" Isabella sighed in admiration.

Isabelle Montgomery's chest tightened with envy. Her sharp gaze cut through Evelyn like a blade.

What wasn't there to envy? Evelyn's flawless beauty? The fact she wore jewelry even A-list celebrities couldn't obtain? Or perhaps the way Nathan Blackwood's intense gaze never left her?

"Two years ago, I was going through a rough patch. I thought buying something beautiful might lift my spirits."

Evelyn's lips curled slightly as she spoke casually. "Coincidentally, I saw this piece at the exhibition and fell in love at first sight. My sadness vanished instantly. So I bought it without hesitation."

Her words stabbed Nathan like a knife, twisting in his chest until he couldn't meet her radiant eyes.

Two years ago was when he had been running himself ragged for Victoria, designing Crimson Promise.

Anything Victoria wanted, Nathan would deliver without her even asking.

Yet he had never once cared about what Evelyn desired.

Nathan's gaze remained fixed on her, but she didn’t spare him a single glance.

She still resented him.

And that resentment meant she hadn’t moved on.

"Jewelry personally designed by Alexa is priceless!"

Isabella looked at Evelyn with admiration. "This proves you must be deeply involved in philanthropy, Ms. Kingsley."

Evelyn smiled gracefully. She lowered her lashes, unpinned the brooch, and wrapped it carefully in a silk handkerchief. Then, with both hands, she offered it to Isabella.

"Ms. Kingsley, what are you—?"

"I think Aurora's Tear suits your bold, unshakable elegance more than mine, Ms. Wang. I hope you won’t mind me gifting it to you upon our first meeting."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Cassandra, Penelope, and Isabelle gaped in shock.

This was a piece worth millions—yet Evelyn gave it away without blinking.

Only someone with insane wealth would do that!

Nathan's jaw clenched. Sweat dampened his palms.

Evelyn… what game are you playing now?
###Chapter 353

Evelyn felt a jolt of astonishment ripple through her, leaving her momentarily speechless! She had exhausted every connection, begged every acquaintance to secure even a single piece from Alexa's coveted jewelry collection, yet all efforts had proven futile.

Then came the unexpected twist—Nathan Blackwood himself presented her with Alexa's exquisite brooch as a personal gift. Isabella's heart raced with exhilaration.

"No, no, Ms. Carter! Your generosity overwhelms me, but this is far too precious. I simply can't accept it," Isabella protested, though her fingers trembled with longing over the delicate piece. Pride warred with desire as she forced herself to decline.

"This brooch once mended my broken spirit," Evelyn murmured, her gaze distant yet determined. "But now I've stepped fully into the light, never to return to those shadows. Consider this my blessing—may it bring you the fortune it once granted me."

Nathan's breath hitched. A sharp, searing pain lanced through his chest as if struck by an invisible blade. The fleeting warmth he'd felt moments ago vanished, replaced by an icy void.

"Oh! In that case, Ms. Carter, I'll gratefully accept your extraordinary gift!" Isabella beamed, cradling the brooch like sacred treasure. Her radiant smile transformed the usually aloof superstar into someone almost unrecognizable.

"Unbelievable," Cassandra Blackwood hissed, nails digging into her mother's arm. "Mother, we invested a fortune in this event! Why let that wretched woman steal the spotlight with some trinket? Our family could shower Isabella with ten times—"

"Patience, darling." Penelope Whitmore's lips curled into a venomous smile. "Evelyn's always been a walking curse. Let her play her games—Nathan's getting exactly what he deserves."

Cassandra frowned. Before the divorce, Evelyn had trembled at Nathan's slightest displeasure. Now? She wielded power over him like a puppeteer. Had she always possessed this skill, Victoria Sterling would never have stood a chance.

"Ms. Evelyn Carter!" Isabelle Montgomery stepped forward, false sweetness dripping from her voice. "Of all nights to present gifts, you choose the Blackwoods' wedding banquet? How... calculated."

Nathan's eyes darkened at the unnecessary interference.

"If a simple gift threatens to overshadow the host," Evelyn countered, her emerald eyes glinting, "then you insult Mr. Blackwood far more than I ever could. Unless..." She gestured to Nathan, who stood rigid nearby. "Does Mr. Blackwood object? No? Then perhaps guests should mind their roles."

Isabelle's face flushed crimson, but the watching crowd stifled her retort.

Evelyn sighed, turning to Isabella with apparent remorse. "Ms. Laurent, my presence clearly causes discomfort. Monarch Group and Blackwood Industries have always been rivals—I shouldn't have come. Please enjoy your evening."

"Wait!" Isabella caught Evelyn's arm. "I'd love to discuss Alexa Jewelry further. Are you free tonight?"

"Absolutely. The Monarch Grand has prepared Crestview's finest cuisine and vintage Lafite for your pleasure." Evelyn's smile was all polished charm. "Shall we dine while we talk?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The audacity! Poaching the guest of honor at the Blackwoods' event!

Nathan's pulse roared in his ears. As he moved to intervene, Isabella offered him an apologetic glance. "Mr. Blackwood, urgent matters call me away. My sincerest apologies."

The room collectively held its breath. No explanation. No pretense. The legendary diva lived up to her reputation.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn purred, though her eyes remained frosty, "we'd gladly set an extra place at our table. Will you join us?"

Nathan's jaw clenched. Just as he drew breath to respond, Evelyn laughed lightly. "Ah, but with so many distinguished guests, you're undoubtedly occupied. Another time, perhaps."

The dismissal hung in the air like a challenge—one Nathan couldn't answer without causing a scene. The game, it seemed, was far from over.
###Chapter 354

Under the dazzling chandeliers of the grand ballroom, Evelyn Carter gracefully exited with Isabella Wang on her arm, their laughter echoing through the stunned silence like wind chimes in a hurricane.

Every pair of eyes followed their departure, the air thick with unspoken shock.

Nathan Blackwood's grip tightened around his champagne flute, his knuckles turning white. The way the crystal reflected the light made his crimson eyes appear even more dangerous.

This woman... First she stole his Westridge project. Now she's taking his most important guest.

Evelyn Carter, you're not some refined socialite. You're a damn pirate in designer heels!

His free hand unconsciously pressed against his chest, where an unfamiliar hollowness had taken root.

Outside the Blackwood Hotel, an unusual number of reporters still lingered in the cold night air.

Theodore Winslow adjusted his cufflinks as he stepped out of the forest-green Rolls-Royce Phantom. The sudden camera flashes died immediately when reporters realized he wasn't a celebrity.

Then the real spectacle began.

Gasps erupted as Evelyn and Isabella emerged together, their silhouettes framed by the hotel's golden entrance.

"Is that—? She actually got Isabella Wang to leave Nathan Blackwood's event!"

"This is huge! Monarch Group just humiliated Blackwood Industries on their home turf!"

The media frenzy was instantaneous. #EvelynCarterWithIsabellaWang began trending before they even reached the car.

Just as Evelyn was about to enter the vehicle, a bold reporter shouted, "Ms. Carter! Isn't this a blatant business ambush?"

Evelyn paused. When she turned, the sheer intensity in her gaze made the reporter take an involuntary step back. The contrast between her delicate features and commanding presence was startling.

"Ms. Wang choosing to stay at the Blackwood doesn't preclude me from inviting her to dinner." Evelyn's smile was all polished edges. "Unless you're suggesting Mr. Blackwood is so insecure he'd object to businesswomen having social engagements?"

The Rolls-Royce's engine purred to life, leaving behind a cloud of whispers and flashing cameras. Inside, Isabella chuckled. "You enjoy riling him up, don't you?"

Evelyn's smile turned feline as she watched Nathan's furious silhouette recede through the tinted windows. "Immensely."
###Chapter 355

The grand ballroom buzzed with life, the banquet in full swing. Yet the atmosphere had shifted noticeably since Evelyn Carter's dramatic exit with Isabella Wang.

The guests' excitement dimmed, their whispers filling the air like a quiet storm.

Zoe Montgomery had arrived tonight with one goal—to shine in front of an international superstar. She had dressed to perfection, rehearsed her lines, and waited for her moment.

Now, with Isabella gone, her stage had vanished. All her meticulous preparations had been for nothing.

This is all Evelyn's fault! Zoe seethed.

Outside the banquet hall, Nathan Blackwood stood motionless by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his presence as cold as the night air. His gaze remained fixed on the spot where the Rolls-Royce had disappeared, his breathing heavy, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"Mr. Blackwood," Oliver Sinclair hesitated before speaking, wiping sweat from his brow. "I hate to say it, but it seems Ms. Carter has outmaneuvered us. The trending topics are all about Monarch Group now. And the news of her taking Isabella Wang away has already spread. Even the chairman knows."

He swallowed hard before continuing. "People are questioning Blackwood Hotel's capabilities. They're saying we shouldn't have taken on an event we couldn't handle. Some are even doubting if our standards have declined."

Evelyn's calculated move had worked flawlessly. She had left no room for retaliation.

Nathan watched the distant taillights until they vanished completely. His voice was rough when he finally spoke. "Why the sudden change? You used to call her 'Young Madam.'"

Oliver inhaled sharply, looking flustered. "I call her Ms. Carter when she's acting against you. 'Young Madam' is reserved for when she's not."

Nathan exhaled, his expression unreadable. "It's just a title. Call her what you want." His gaze darkened. "Besides, I'm not upset. Evelyn has always been like this, hasn't she?"

Oliver blinked in surprise. Every time Nathan clashed with Evelyn, he'd been visibly furious. But tonight, after such a public humiliation, he was eerily calm.

Does Mr. Blackwood have some hidden masochistic streak? Oliver wondered.

Every guest had been carefully vetted, the security system airtight. So how had Evelyn slipped in unnoticed? Nathan couldn't shake the question.

"Um... I heard there was a brief malfunction in the surveillance system just before Ms. Carter entered," Oliver admitted. "But the equipment was serviced recently. It shouldn't have failed so quickly. We suspect a cyberattack—maybe a virus."

"A hacker?" Nathan's brow furrowed.

Could Evelyn have orchestrated this? Does she have that kind of skill? Or did her brother Sebastian intervene again?

"Nathan!" A sweet voice shattered his thoughts. Zoe rushed toward him, her face flushed with indignation. His frown deepened as she approached.

"Evelyn is outrageous! How dare she take Isabella away right in front of you? It's like she wants to humiliate you!" Zoe stomped her foot, seizing the chance to vent. "She clearly doesn't respect you at all!"

She knew men like Nathan—powerful, proud—couldn't stand having their authority challenged.

But his response drained the color from her face.

"You barely know her," Nathan said coolly. "Evelyn has always been like this. She never cared about my position."

"Nathan, what are you saying?"

"It doesn't bother me. I don't mind."

His icy gaze locked onto her, displeasure flickering in his eyes. "Ms. Montgomery, I find your behavior tonight... puzzling."

The formal address—Ms. Montgomery—hit her like a slap. She froze, her breath catching.

Is he... distancing himself from me?

"This is the Blackwoods' banquet, and I was present," he continued. "Regardless, it wasn't your place to speak for my family."

"But Nathan, I was just trying to help you!"

Her voice trembled with panic as she clutched his arm. "Are we really going to let that wicked woman ruin your event, steal your guest, and turn the Blackwoods into a laughingstock in Crestview? She's too arrogant! Why does she think she can act like this? Just because she's your ex-wife?"

The moment the words left her lips, she regretted them.

Nathan's expression darkened. "I've been married. That's no secret. But who told you Evelyn is my ex-wife?"

"Julian did!" she lied hastily.

Nathan's voice turned dangerously soft. "Cassandra told you, didn't she?"

Zoe bit her lip, too afraid to answer.
###Chapter 356

"That's between Evelyn and me. It's nobody else's business." Nathan's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "She's moved on with her life, so stop dragging up our past."

Isabelle's pulse hammered violently in her throat, bitter resentment coiling in her chest. The unspoken message in Nathan's words was crystal clear - he was protecting Evelyn's privacy. Defending her.

"Isabella Laurent has left. If you're not up to performing tonight, I can have Oliver arrange your ride home immediately."

Nathan didn't even glance at Isabelle's ashen face before withdrawing his arm and striding away. Oliver shot her a disdainful look, clicking his tongue. He couldn't reconcile this sharp-tongued girl with Julian's refined sister. She was practically begging for trouble.

"Nathan! Nathan Blackwood!"

He didn't pause until she shouted his full name, the syllables cracking with emotion.

"Are you still in love with her? Is that why you keep defending Evelyn?" Her voice trembled with barely contained fury.

"No, I don't love her." The denial came too fast, as if even a second's hesitation might betray some hidden truth.

"Then why take her side? She never loved you! She played you, stole from you, then sabotaged your banquet!" Isabelle's pitch rose hysterically. "She's toxic! Everything she touches turns to ruin. Why protect her?"

Unlike Rosalind, Isabelle had never learned to mask her emotions. The pampered Montgomery heiress always got what she wanted. This rejection was foreign, unbearable.

The harder she chased Nathan, the further he retreated. When he finally turned, his gaze was glacial.

"You've never been married. You wouldn't understand the respect between spouses. Evelyn was my wife - showing her mercy is my prerogative." Each word struck like an arrow.

"Even if I don't love her, she was mine. I'm the only one who gets to criticize her."

Outside, rain began pelting the pavement. Eleanor slipped out of Cliffside Manor, clutching a stuffed bear to her chest. The downpour soaked her cotton dress within minutes, yet the toy remained pristine.

Trembling with social anxiety, Eleanor couldn't approach the hotel's grand entrance. She crept through the service door, dodging elegantly dressed guests as she scurried down back corridors.

"Halt!" The command froze Eleanor mid-step. Despite being Leonard Blackwood's daughter, she felt like a criminal under the guards' scrutiny.

"No solicitors tonight. Get lost!" one sneered, eyeing her damp, disheveled appearance.

"Please...I just want to see Isabella Laurent. One minute, that's all!" Eleanor begged.

"Invitation only. Scram!" The guard moved to shove her.

"Look at this dumpster diver thinking she belongs here!" his partner mocked.

But Eleanor's admiration for Isabella bordered on obsession. Gritting her teeth, she hugged the bear tighter, took three steps back, and charged.

The guard easily caught her slight frame, flinging both girl and toy aside. Eleanor squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact—only to land in strong, familiar arms.
###Chapter 357

Eleanor's face drained of color as she stumbled forward, crashing straight into the man's arms. Julian lowered his gaze, a chill settling in his chest. His long lashes trembled faintly.

The dampness from her clothes seeped through his thin silk shirt, mingling with the warmth of his skin. His breathing grew ragged as his arms instinctively tightened around her.

"Eleanor?" Julian's voice was low and rough.

Eleanor squeezed her eyes shut, fingers digging into his crisp lapel without a word.

Julian suppressed a quiet chuckle. "Did I hurt you?" he murmured.

She pressed her forehead against his chest and shook her head.

A pang of tenderness twisted inside him.

The two security guards, witnessing Julian's sudden appearance, stiffened immediately. They bowed deeply, voices trembling. "Good evening, Mr. Montgomery!"

"What's going on here?" Julian asked lazily, still holding Eleanor close.

"Oh, it's nothing serious, just a small misunderstanding," the previously aggressive guard stammered, forcing a smile. "This young lady is a fan of Ms. Isabella Laurent, and she tried to enter without an invitation. We were just doing our job—"

"So, you thought manhandling her was part of your job?" Julian's expression darkened.

"N-No! We were just preventing unauthorized entry," the guard backpedaled, unwilling to admit they'd bullied a defenseless girl.

Julian smirked, then leaned down to whisper in Eleanor's ear, "Want me to teach them a lesson?"

Eleanor, still avoiding his gaze, hesitated before giving a tiny nod—then quickly shook her head.

Julian chuckled, slipping his phone from his wine-red velvet jacket and dialing Nathan's number.

"Nathan, mind if I discipline your employees?" The two guards exchanged panicked looks.

After a brief pause, Julian stroked Eleanor's damp hair soothingly. "Good. I'll handle it."

Hanging up, he steadied Eleanor on her feet and flicked his wrist. Instantly, the Montgomery family's elite bodyguards closed in, encircling the two trembling hotel guards.

Eleanor blinked in confusion as Julian slipped his hands into his pockets and strolled forward with a smirk. The Montgomery guards shifted seamlessly, blocking her view.

A sharp cry pierced the air.

A pained groan followed.

The circle of guards was impenetrable, but the sounds of struggle made Eleanor flinch.

Finally, Julian stepped back, coldly observing the two battered men now kneeling before him. He accepted a handkerchief from one of his men and wiped the blood from his knuckles.

"If you can't even recognize a Blackwood, what use are your eyes?"

The guards trembled, their gazes darting to Eleanor before they kowtowed violently.

"Ms. Blackwood, please forgive us! We were blind! Spare us!"

In Crestview, everyone knew the Montgomerys had ties to both legitimate and shadowy dealings. Crossing them meant ruin.

"I'll settle this myself. No need to trouble your boss," Julian drawled.

With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the bloodied handkerchief onto their faces.

"Leave Blackwood Industries and get out of Crestview. If I ever see you here again, you won't be walking away."

"Thank you, Mr. Montgomery! Thank you!"

Sobbing, the two were dragged away by the Montgomery guards.

Eleanor bit her lip, frozen in place.

Julian approached her again, bending slightly to meet her eyes with a playful glint.

"Eleanor, you're full of surprises. Even your own family's employees didn’t recognize you."

She took a small step back, murmuring softly, "Did you have to go that far?"
###Chapter 358

"Did I go too hard on them?" Julian murmured, his piercing gaze sharpening as he studied Eleanor's reaction.

Eleanor glanced down at her trembling hands and gave a hesitant nod.

"Honestly, I still think I went too easy."

Seeing her vulnerable expression, Julian instinctively reached out to ruffle her hair. "You're Nathan's little sister. No one gets to treat you like that." His voice softened. "I held back only because I didn't want to scare you."

The warmth. The comfort. Eleanor felt Julian's fingers threading through her damp locks and couldn't suppress the small, contented sigh that escaped her lips.

At that exact moment, Cassandra emerged from the banquet hall, her eyes widening at the scene before her. Her docile half-sister had somehow managed to sneak all the way here?

"That little witch!" Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "One moment out of my sight and she's already throwing herself at Julian. How dare she!"

Blind rage threatened to consume her, but Cassandra forced herself to pause when she noticed Julian still standing there. Months of observing Victoria had taught her patience. She wouldn't risk alienating the man she coveted. Instead, she melted into the shadows, watching them with venomous eyes.

Julian took in Eleanor's disheveled state - the soaked dress clinging to her frame, the mud splattered across her hemline. Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tailored burgundy blazer and draped it over her shoulders. From her hiding spot, Cassandra nearly choked on her fury, her face contorting with barely contained jealousy.

"What happened? Didn't your driver bring you?" Julian's brow furrowed with concern.

"I... I came alone. No one knows I'm here," Eleanor admitted quietly.

"Alone?" Julian's frown deepened.

"Mr..."

Eleanor didn't recognize him. The memory of their moonlit kiss during Reginald's birthday celebration had long faded from her traumatized mind.

"Eleanor, I'm Julian Montgomery. Your brother's closest friend." His lips curved into a warm smile. "Just call me Julian."

"Julian... Julian?!"

The name struck her like a thunderbolt. This was the Julian Cassandra constantly raged about? The same man whose name was always followed by threats and violence?

Fear coiled in her stomach, but Julian remained oblivious. Instead, he firmly grasped her chilled fingers. "Let me arrange for fresh clothes."

"N-no, that's not necessary—"

"Don't be shy. Your brother and I are practically family." His grip tightened as he guided her forward. "Come, let's get you sorted."

"Julian, wait."

Being led by a near-stranger unsettled her, yet she lacked the courage to resist. Gathering her frayed nerves, she squeezed his hand slightly. "Do you... treat Cassandra this way too? She's also Nathan's sister."

Julian's expression darkened momentarily before softening into a dazzling smile meant only for her. "No. This is special. Just for you."

Every word pierced Cassandra like daggers. From her concealed vantage point, her glare could have melted steel, her hatred for Eleanor burning brighter than ever.
###Chapter 359

Julian Montgomery reserved the penthouse suite at the Blackwood Hotel, immediately instructing his assistant Yasmin to procure an elegant evening gown for Eleanor Blackwood to change into.

While Eleanor disappeared into the bedroom to dress, Julian lounged on the velvet sofa, his fingers drumming an impatient rhythm against his knee. Dressed in his signature black tuxedo, he looked every bit the dashing groom awaiting his bride's grand reveal.

The door clicked open moments later.

"Mr. Montgomery," Yasmin announced with a warm smile, "Miss Blackwood is ready."

Julian's head snapped up as Eleanor emerged shyly from the bedroom, transformed in a deep burgundy gown that accentuated her delicate frame. Her wide, innocent eyes held a hint of uncertainty that made his breath catch.

In his world of glamour and excess, Julian had encountered countless women, but never one whose gaze remained so untouched by cynicism.

His stare lingered a beat too long, coloring her cheeks pink.

"Honestly Yasmin," Julian chided without looking away from Eleanor's face, "burgundy? For someone her age? Shouldn't you have chosen something more youthful?" His tone carried mock disapproval. "After all these years working for me, I expected better taste."

Yasmin flushed, preparing to apologize when Eleanor spoke up.

"I actually love this color," she said with refreshing honesty. "But Julian, red really doesn't suit you. It makes you look..." She hesitated before finishing, "...like a shadow."

Yasmin's eyes widened in shock behind Eleanor.

Julian's expression darkened instantly. In all his years, only Evelyn Carter had dared criticize him so bluntly.

The man prided himself on his looks, considering himself second only to Nathan Blackwood in all of Crestview.

"Only because you're Nathan's sister will I let that slide," Julian muttered, his voice tight with irritation.

"Are you angry, Julian?" Eleanor asked with genuine concern, clutching her stuffed bear tighter. "If I said you look like a lump of charcoal in red, would you yell at me?"

Yasmin couldn't suppress a sudden laugh, quickly covering her mouth. The infamous Julian Montgomery, reduced to a lump of coal in this girl's eyes!

Julian's jaw dropped, his chest rising with indignant breaths. He moved toward Eleanor with deliberate steps, his imposing frame dwarfing her petite form.

Slowly bending down, he raised his hand. Eleanor squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.

Instead, Julian's lips quirked into a smirk as he gently flicked her forehead. "You're right. I'm hitting you now. Did that hurt?"

Eleanor rubbed the spot and shook her head.

"Next time you insult me," Julian warned playfully, "I won't be so gentle."

Meanwhile, the banquet hall descended into chaos after Evelyn Carter's dramatic exit forced Nathan to intervene. With Isabella Wang whisked away and Nathan absent, Isabelle Montgomery watched her carefully laid plans unravel.

Frustrated, she drained two glasses of champagne before storming toward the grand piano on the dais.

Most guests continued mingling, oblivious to the seething woman until—

BANG!

Isabelle slammed both hands onto the keys in a discordant crash that silenced the room. Every head turned toward the stage, many wearing expressions of disapproval.
###Chapter 360

What on earth is happening?

Honestly, how can someone act so disgracefully? Has she no sense of decorum?

Isabelle Montgomery truly embodied the spoiled, entitled heiress stereotype. Nathan's cutting remarks only fueled her growing rage. She cared little for the occasion - all she wanted was to unleash her fury.

Yet surrounded by Crestview's elite, the Montgomery name demanded restraint.

Gritting her teeth, Isabelle forced composure. A delicate cough, then her fingers flew across the piano keys - Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor flowing effortlessly.

As a Valmont Royal Academy of Music prodigy, the piece became an extension of her turbulent emotions. The crowd gradually forgot her earlier outburst, swept away by the passionate performance.

Meanwhile, Cassandra Blackwood stormed back into the ballroom, her gown trailing behind her. "Mother!" she hissed, gripping Penelope Whitmore's arm. "Eleanor is here!"

Penelope's eyes widened. "Where?"

"I just saw her with Mr. Montgomery! He even gave her his jacket and patted her head!" Cassandra's eyes welled with angry tears. "Mother, we've been fooled! Eleanor's sharper than she pretends. She's been targeting Julian from the beginning! How vile!"

"Enough!" Penelope pinched her daughter's arm discreetly. "That's your sister! Both my daughters will maintain appearances. Never speak of her like that again!"

Cassandra trembled with suppressed rage, biting her lip bloody. She recognized her mother's words weren't in defense of Eleanor - just another denial of her "imperfect" child.

"What should I do?" Cassandra clutched Penelope desperately. "I finally made Evelyn break things off with Julian, and now my own sister interferes! He barely tolerated me before - now any chance at marrying into the Montgomery family is ruined!"

"Stop this nonsense. Eleanor isn't your rival." Penelope waved dismissively. "Find Oliver later. Have him locate Eleanor and bring her home immediately."

To Penelope, this was merely a minor disruption. She'd controlled her daughters tightly for years. Eleanor's condition made her an unlikely candidate for advantageous marriage - but Penelope remained determined to profit from her "defective" child somehow.

"Ms. Montgomery seems rather temperamental," Penelope remarked casually as Isabelle's piano piece crescendoed.

"Temperamental? She's insufferable!" Cassandra abandoned pretense with her mother. "Compared to Victoria, she's utterly lacking in refinement - a walking time bomb!"

"Good," Penelope's eyes glinted coldly.

"Good? How?"

"Hot-tempered people are transparent. Easier to manipulate." Penelope analyzed coolly. "Isabelle only wants to be Nathan's wife. Spoiled since birth, she lacks nothing - simple-minded but possessive." Her lips curled. "Someone like Victoria, all honeyed words and hidden daggers? Far more dangerous."

As they spoke, the grand ballroom doors swung open.

Isabelle, lost in her performance, remained oblivious as all attention shifted toward the entrance. There, flanked by Julian's bodyguards, a petite figure entered hesitantly - head bowed.

"My word! Who's that delicate beauty with Mr. Montgomery?" Society women immediately began whispering. "I've never seen her before!"

"Another fleeting romance, no doubt. Mr. Montgomery changes women like gloves. Rumor says none last beyond a month."

"Pretty, but not his usual type. He favors bold, voluptuous women typically."

"Personally, she outshines Isabelle on that stage and certainly eclipses Cassandra Blackwood. Say what you will about Julian Montgomery, but the man has impeccable taste. That girl beside him? A genuine treasure, not some polished fake!"

"Indeed, Mr. Montgomery's preferences far surpass Mr. Blackwood's. She seems refreshingly sincere - unlikely to betray him like certain others..."

Cassandra's face burned crimson with humiliation, her gums aching from clenched teeth. Penelope's expression twisted with disdain as the whispers continued.
###Chapter 361

"I warned you, Mother! I told you they weren't just friends!" Cassandra's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Eleanor is deliberately sabotaging me!"

Her nails dug into her palms as she watched the scene unfold.

Julian had dressed Eleanor in an exquisite crimson gown that made her radiate even without makeup. The rich burgundy fabric perfectly matched Julian's tailored tuxedo, creating a striking visual harmony.

Under the dazzling chandeliers, they looked like royalty at their coronation. All guests' attention was magnetically drawn to the breathtaking pair.

Cassandra's violet dress suddenly felt garish and ill-fitting. The clashing colors screamed "mismatch" in the most humiliating way.

"Darling, I carried Eleanor for nine months." Penelope's voice carried the weight of experience. "That girl has the emotional intelligence of a child. She couldn't steal a candy bar, let alone a man."

Her words provided little comfort. Cassandra's chest burned with jealousy.

"You're missing the real issue," Penelope continued sharply. "Julian has never shown genuine interest in you. After your grandfather's birthday fiasco, he probably finds your advances repulsive."

A visible tremor ran through Cassandra's body.

"Now that he knows Eleanor is your sister," Penelope concluded coldly, "he's using her to punish you."

Cassandra's breath hitched. "So... I'll never become Mrs. Montgomery?"

"Stop being dramatic." Penelope's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Work with Isabelle. Change your approach. If Julian favors Eleanor, you must shower her with kindness. Make him see your compassionate side. Understood?"

"Fine," Cassandra spat through clenched teeth.

Meanwhile, Eleanor's entire being vibrated with anticipation about meeting Isabella Laurent. Her searching gaze swept across the ballroom until—

There.

On the grand piano stage.

Isabelle Montgomery.

Eleanor's blood turned to ice.

Her legs buckled beneath the weight of sudden memories.

Cruel laughter echoed in her mind.

"Who'd be friends with a retard like you?"

"Throw her in the dumpster where trash belongs!"

"Cut her hair! I hate girls with prettier hair than mine!"

"No wonder the Blackwoods despise you. Even your sister can't stand you. You're the family's shame."

On stage, Isabelle played a melancholic sonata, oblivious to the terrified eyes watching her.

Tears blurred Eleanor's vision as she clutched her teddy bear tighter. Cold sweat drenched her back as she stumbled backward.

"Eleanor?" Julian's concerned voice cut through her panic as he grasped her elbow. "I thought you wanted Isabella's autograph? Let's go meet her."

Instead of responding, Eleanor wrenched free and bolted for the exit like a hunted animal.

"Eleanor! Wait!" Julian's shout echoed through the hall as he gave chase.

The scene made Cassandra see red. Despite her mother's advice, she couldn't stomach Julian's obvious concern for "that imbecile."

Outside, Eleanor ran blindly into the night, tears streaming down her face.

Just minutes ago, she'd been giddy about meeting her idol. Isabella's films were her sanctuary—those strong heroines standing against injustice gave her courage during countless lonely nights.

Now?

She just needed to escape.

"You're unwanted baggage, loser!"

The taunts chased her like relentless ghosts.
###Chapter 362

The blaring horn shattered the night's silence.

A black sedan screeched to a halt, its high beams illuminating Eleanor's terrified face.

Her porcelain skin glowed eerily under the harsh headlights.

Frozen in place, the young woman resembled a startled fawn caught in hunting lights.

The massive truck's brakes screamed in protest, but physics dictated it couldn't stop in time. Eleanor clutched her worn teddy bear tighter, squeezing her eyes shut.

"Eleanor! Move!"

Julian's muscles burned as he lunged forward, his designer shoes skidding across pavement. With one powerful yank, he pulled her from death's path mere milliseconds before impact.

His arms encircled her fragile frame protectively, just as she shielded her beloved stuffed animal.

They spun through the air in a bizarre waltz before crashing onto the concrete sidewalk. Julian twisted mid-fall, taking the brunt of impact to cushion Eleanor's landing.

A sickening crack echoed as his shoulder collided with the curb. Pain radiated through his body, sweat soaking through his custom Armani suit.

The out-of-control truck careened off-road, plowing through a decorative hedge before coming to rest against a brick wall. The shaken driver emerged unharmed.

Gritting his teeth against the agony, Julian loosened his grip on Eleanor.

To his astonishment, the ungrateful girl wriggled free from his embrace and darted away without a backward glance.

"Hey! Eleanor! Where the hell do you think you're going?" Julian bellowed, his voice raw with pain and indignation. His injuries made standing impossible without assistance.

The evening's high-profile gala had begun as a glittering success but ended in abrupt chaos. To prevent unnecessary family concern, Julian instructed his assistant to discreetly handle his vehicle retrieval and medical arrangements.

Meanwhile, Isabelle Montgomery nursed her wounded pride at the hotel's exclusive bar, sharing drinks with her frenemy Cassandra. The ice cubes clinked ominously in her half-empty martini glass.

"That bastard Nathaniel only has eyes for Evelyn now," Isabelle spat, slamming her glass down with enough force to crack the crystal. Her crimson manicure matched the fury in her bloodshot eyes. "If he still cares for her, why the hell did they divorce?"

"You're preaching to the choir, darling," Cassandra sighed, twirling her cocktail straw. "Evelyn waited on our family hand and foot for three years. Cooked Nathaniel's favorite meals, memorized his schedule, endured his glacial indifference - the perfect corporate wife."

She took a long sip before continuing, "Honestly? I'd have lasted a week tops in her shoes. But three years? That takes either saintly patience or pathological desperation." Cassandra's lips twisted in reluctant admiration. "Yet Nathaniel barely glanced her way. Always mooning over Victoria. He threw away the one woman who truly loved him for some childhood fantasy."

The alcohol lowered Cassandra's usual filters. "Looking back? My brother was a complete idiot."

Isabelle's grip tightened around her glass at Cassandra's unexpected sympathy for Evelyn. "What's this? Suddenly developing a conscience about how your family treated Evelyn?" Her laugh held no humor. "Regretting losing your perfect little doormat sister-in-law?"

Cassandra's smile turned brittle. "Don't be ridiculous, Isabelle." She backpedaled quickly, "I'm just analyzing the situation. Why ignore Evelyn for years only to chase her after the divorce?" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Maybe Nathaniel only understands love when he's lost it. Typical male psychology."

Isabelle drained her glass, the bitter wine matching her mood. Her competitive nature burned hotter. "I refuse to believe Nathaniel has genuine feelings for Evelyn! Three years of marriage would've revealed any spark." She tossed her chestnut locks defiantly. "This is just possessive posturing - he can't stand seeing his discarded wife thriving without him."

Her manicured finger traced the rim of her glass. "What Nathaniel and I share is real, not whatever transactional arrangement he had with Evelyn." Isabelle's smirk didn't reach her eyes. "He's just temporarily distracted by her little games."

Cassandra discreetly rolled her eyes behind her drink. Isabelle's delusions knew no bounds, but Cassandra needed the Montgomery family's influence for her own ambitions. Some truths weren't worth speaking.

"We should focus on winning Isabella Wang's support to help Nathaniel close that merger," Cassandra suggested smoothly, changing tactics. "I can help make introductions."

Isabelle's expression darkened at the memory of Evelyn dramatically producing Aurora's Tear. Her nails dug into her palms. "That damn brooch isn't Alexa's only masterpiece," she muttered. "If Evelyn can play the designer card, so can I."
###Chapter 363

That was pure nonsense.

Isabelle Montgomery could never obtain a jewelry piece that even an esteemed collector like Isabella Laurent couldn't access.

Though shocked by Isabelle's audacity, Cassandra Blackwood played along. "You're incredible, Isabelle! If you can secure Alexa's jewelry, Isabella will definitely return to us. We can finally get back at Evelyn, help Nathan, and—best of all—make him see you in a new light. You'll be Blackwood Industries' savior, and Nathan won't be able to resist you."

Isabelle smirked, swirling her wine. "So we just need to steal the case from Evelyn."

Cassandra nodded, though her mind raced with different plans.

Helping Nathan wasn't her goal—they weren't full siblings, after all.

But this was her chance to shine. If she orchestrated this instead of Nathan, she could prove her worth to their father and restore her mother's fading influence in the family.

Isabelle was merely a stepping stone.

Cassandra's eyes gleamed with ambition, her cheeks flushed with excitement.

"Tonight was a disaster," Isabelle huffed. "Nathan left early, and Julian didn't even show up like he promised. What's his problem? I should've thrown a fit."

"Julian did come," Cassandra said coolly. "But he left shortly after."

"When?"

"While you were playing the piano. He brought my sister, Eleanor, with him." Cassandra smirked. "Funny, isn't it? My sister—the so-called 'idiot'—was the center of attention, all thanks to Julian."

"Your sister? That dimwit?"

Isabelle's jaw dropped. She couldn't fathom her brother associating with someone like Eleanor.

She knew Eleanor all too well.

Back in their Crestview Academy days, they'd been classmates. Isabelle had made sure Eleanor's school years were a living nightmare.

"I already have enough problems before marrying into the Montgomery family," Cassandra sighed dramatically, her eyes turning icy. "And now, your brother might actually have feelings for my sister."

"Feelings? For her?" Isabelle shot up, knocking over her glass. "That idiot isn't worthy of Julian!"

Cassandra hid a smirk behind a sympathetic expression. "You didn't see it, but Julian was devoted to her tonight. He bought her a new dress, whispered sweet nothings—claimed she was the only one who mattered. It was sickening."

She knew Julian was too much of a playboy to genuinely care for Eleanor.

But she needed Isabelle riled up.

Isabelle's rage simmered as Cassandra painted the scene.

She slumped back into her seat, sipping her wine with a dark expression. The shadows under her eyes deepened.

Julian was her brother—no one understood him better than she did.

Over the years, he'd never shown real interest in any woman. But Cassandra had noticed his unusual attention toward Eleanor.

That couldn't happen.

Isabelle had tormented Eleanor relentlessly.

Years may have passed, but she doubted Eleanor had forgotten.

If Julian and Eleanor grew close, Eleanor might use him for revenge.

It didn’t matter if Julian married her or not—he’d do anything to make her happy.

Isabelle clenched her teeth. "Don’t worry. As long as I’m alive, Eleanor will never be with my brother."

The Monarch Grand Hotel’s VIP suite exuded opulence. A grand round table displayed ten exquisite dishes, each a masterpiece of aroma and presentation. The wine served was a rare vintage, worthy of a high-end auction.

The conversation flowed effortlessly—films, jewelry collections, high society gossip.

The dinner was nothing short of perfection.
###Chapter 364

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn and Theodore escorted Isabella to her car in the underground parking garage.

"Ms. Laurent, thank you for such a wonderful dinner. The dessert was divine—I couldn’t stop myself from having seconds," Isabella admitted, her eyes sparkling with delight.

"Please send my compliments to the chef."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a warm smile. "If you enjoyed it, I’ll have two boxes delivered to your hotel before you leave Crestview. One for you, and one for your mother."

Theodore seized the opportunity to interject, pride lacing his voice. "Ms. Wang, every dish you tasted tonight, including the dessert, was personally crafted by Ms. Carter herself."

Isabella’s eyes widened in astonishment. "Wait—you made that intricate dessert, Ms. Carter?"

It was difficult to reconcile—Evelyn, born into wealth, a formidable businesswoman, and yet, an accomplished chef. The dessert alone, with its delicate layers, was a testament to her skill.

Evelyn ducked her head slightly, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. "Yes, though I could’ve done better. My apologies."

Isabella fell silent for a moment before a slow smile spread across her face. "Do you have a contract with you, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn and Theodore exchanged startled glances. "Are you saying—?"

"I want Monarch Grand Hotels to bring my dream wedding to life," Isabella declared. "If possible, I’d like to sign the agreement tonight."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, though her expression remained composed. Inside, her heart raced with exhilaration.

Theodore, barely containing his excitement, rifled through his briefcase. "I have it right here. We always carry contracts with us, Ms. Wang."

Evelyn took a steadying breath, her gaze intent. "Ms. Wang, you entrusted Monarch Group and Blackwood Industries with finding a designer for your custom jewelry piece. Since I haven’t fulfilled that request yet, may I ask why you’ve chosen us for your wedding?"

Theodore blinked, equally curious.

Isabella hesitated, then sighed. "To be honest, I wasn’t interested in either of you handling my wedding. I’ve never been to Crestview, and I only agreed to host it here to honor my mother’s wishes. From the start, I doubted both your hotel and Blackwood Hotel."

She met Evelyn’s gaze, sincerity shining in her eyes. "I accepted Mr. Blackwood’s invitation tonight, but I wasn’t enthusiastic about it. I thought it didn’t matter who I chose—you or him. For that, I apologize. I was arrogant. But now that I’m here, I see that both of you are exceptional leaders. I know I’m in good hands either way."

"Then why us?" Evelyn pressed.

Isabella smiled softly. "I hadn’t decided until you gave me Aurora’s Tear. Tonight’s dinner was a masterpiece, every dish reflecting your dedication and creativity. Your sincerity moved me. That’s why I’m choosing Monarch Grand Hotels."

Evelyn was stunned.

All those years spent honing her culinary skills hadn’t been in vain. They had served her when she least expected it.

As Evelyn and Isabella settled into the car, Theodore laid out two sets of documents, his grin irrepressible.

Before signing, Isabella paused. "Ms. Carter, may I add one more condition to the contract?"

"Of course," Evelyn replied patiently. "What is it?"

"I want to keep my wedding setup a secret until the day itself. I’d love to surprise my fans—and my mother. Can you promise me that?"

"Absolutely. We’ll ensure everything remains confidential, just as outlined in the agreement." Evelyn had a way of instilling confidence with just her words.

The tension of the past week finally dissolved.

Isabella extended her hand, her smile radiant. "Here’s to a successful collaboration, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn clasped her hand firmly, her eyes gleaming. "The pleasure is mine, Ms. Laurent."
###Chapter 365

The morning sun had barely risen when Nathan Blackwood received the urgent call about Julian Montgomery's car accident. Without hesitation, he dropped everything and raced to Kingsley Medical Center.

In the VIP ward, Julian lay motionless, his neck and back secured in braces. His secretary Yasmin carefully fed him sliced apples, the scene resembling a spoiled child being tended by his nanny.

Nathan's brows knitted together as he entered. "I thought the Montgomery Group just secured that new oilfield. You're acting like an invalid before even hitting thirty."

Yasmin discreetly stepped aside, nodding respectfully before leaving the two men alone.

"Damn it, Nate! Are you here to comfort me or insult me?" Julian winced as he tried to sit up, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "I wouldn't need help if I could move my damn arms!"

"Stay still," Nathan commanded, striding forward to push him back down with surprising gentleness despite his stern expression.

"If I end up paralyzed, will you push my wheelchair, Nate?" Julian asked with an exaggerated pout.

"You've got a harem of women for that," Nathan retorted dryly. "Even if only your mouth works, you're still the Montgomery heir. Gold-diggers will line up regardless."

Julian smirked. "True. My charm's irresistible."

"More like your bank account's irresistible," Nathan thought wryly.

"What exactly happened?" Nathan's voice turned serious.

"Ask Eleanor," Julian huffed, recalling the petite figure fleeing into the darkness. "This is all her fault. She should be the one stuck wheeling me around forever."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Explain. How is Eleanor involved?"

"Your sister sneaked into the gala last night. If I hadn't intervened, your incompetent security would've thrown her out onto the streets."

"Eleanor was there last night?" Nathan's shock was palpable. Now Julian's cryptic call about "getting his affairs in order" made sense.

"I was kind enough to dress her—"

"You dressed her?" Nathan's face paled, his hands clenching into fists.

"Not me! Yasmin handled it!" Julian backpedaled quickly, not wanting broken bones to add to his injuries. "I took her to see Isabella Laurent at the ballroom, but she freaked out and bolted like a spooked deer. I followed because it's dangerous at night. She nearly got hit by a truck crossing recklessly. I pushed her out of harm's way but smashed my back against the curb."

"Is Eleanor hurt?" Nathan's concern was immediate.

"Doubt it. I was in too much pain to chase after her. The little ingrate didn't even help me up!" Julian complained bitterly.

"I've warned you before—keep your distance from Eleanor." Nathan's voice turned icy. "What happened at Grandfather's birthday was an accident. She doesn't belong in your world. Control your inappropriate thoughts."

"Seriously? I risked my neck saving her, and this is the thanks I get?" Julian's neck brace made his indignant expression almost comical. "Why are you interrogating me instead of showing gratitude?"

"Why expose her to strangers? Why take her to that vipers' den?" Nathan countered sharply.

"What are you talking about?" Julian looked genuinely confused.

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Eleanor has severe social anxiety and autism spectrum disorder. Crowds and unfamiliar environments terrify her." His voice softened with protective concern, remembering his sister's timid nature.
###Chapter 366

Julian Montgomery froze. His fingers clenched as the realization struck him like a physical blow.

Autism.

Suddenly, Eleanor's unusual behavior made perfect sense. At twenty-two, she should have been worldly, yet she acted with the innocence of a child.

No wonder Penelope had kept her hidden away all these years.

"Did you ever ask for her consent?" Nathan's voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Did you consider whether she wanted to attend that glittering event? Of course not. You never think about others' feelings - that's who you are."

Nathan took a deep breath, his knuckles white around his phone. "Eleanor prefers a quiet life. Stop interfering. You're only hurting her."

Julian remained silent for a long moment before rasping, "Is there... any chance of improvement?"

Nathan's expression darkened as he shook his head. "If recovery were possible, it would have happened years ago."

The memory of Eleanor's terrified face flashed through Julian's mind, making his chest constrict with guilt.

The ringing of Nathan's phone shattered the heavy silence. Leonard Blackwood's name glared from the screen.

Nathan hesitated before answering. "Father."

"Come to my office immediately." The command brooked no argument. "I'll be waiting."

The line went dead.

Nathan stared at the darkened screen, his jaw tightening. Was this really how things would always be between them?

Sometimes he wished Leonard wasn't his father. Maybe then he wouldn't feel this constant, simmering resentment.

When Nathan arrived at Blackwood Industries, the chairman's secretary ushered him in without ceremony.

The scene that greeted him made his blood run cold.

Leonard sat behind his imposing desk, but it was the presence of Cassandra that set off alarm bells in Nathan's mind.

"Nathan!" Cassandra beamed, her sickly-sweet tone making his skin crawl.

To an outsider, they might appear close. Nathan merely nodded, his expression carefully blank.

"I've heard all about the hotel incident from Cassandra," Leonard began, steepling his fingers. "Including how Ms. Kingsley whisked away your honored guest, Isabella Laurent. My team has shown me the Twitter storm."

Leonard's gaze turned icy. "Public perception of our hotel has plummeted overnight. Explain yourself."

"Our PR team worked through the night to mitigate the damage," Nathan replied evenly. "The negative comments have been largely contained."

"Contained?" Leonard's voice dripped with disdain. "The damage is done. Our entire social circle is talking about this debacle. In our world, reputation is everything."

Nathan's jaw clenched.

"In business, there are always competing narratives," he countered. "What matters is who emerges victorious. The doubters will fade when we succeed."

His cold stare shifted to Cassandra. "We should focus on long-term strategy, not short-term optics. Anything less risks catastrophic losses."

Cassandra's smile faltered, her eyes flashing with barely contained fury.

A frantic knock interrupted the tense standoff. The secretary burst in, tablet in hand.

"Mr. Blackwood! You need to see this immediately."

Leonard's face darkened as he scanned the screen. Without looking up, he barked, "Turn on the news. Channel seven. Now."
###Chapter 367

The secretary switched on the flat-screen television, tuning it to the afternoon news broadcast.

It was that cursed Three O'Clock News segment again.

Nathan Blackwood's jaw tightened. Ever since losing the Westridge project bid, he couldn't stomach watching business news without feeling physically ill.

"Welcome back to our afternoon headlines," the anchor announced with polished professionalism. "International superstar Isabella Laurent has arrived in Crestview, causing quite the media frenzy."

Nathan's fingers dug into the armrests of his chair.

"Sources confirm Ms. Laurent chose our city to honor her late mother's final wish - to hold her wedding in her mother's hometown. Both Blackwood Industries and Monarch Grand Hotels have been competing fiercely for the honor of hosting this celebrity wedding. After extensive consideration, Ms. Laurent has made her final decision."

Nathan's mouth went completely dry as the broadcast cut to exterior shots of a luxury hotel.

"We're pleased to announce Monarch Grand Hotels as the chosen venue for Isabella Laurent's wedding ceremony."

The blood drained from Nathan's face. A deafening roar filled his ears as if he'd been struck by lightning.

Cassandra Blackwood barely concealed her smirk.

With this spectacular failure, her path to power within Blackwood Industries became clearer. Nathan's incompetence would be his undoing.

The screen transitioned to an exclusive interview with Isabella Laurent.

The actress explained her decision with effortless grace. "While Blackwood Industries certainly has its merits in the hospitality sector, Monarch's wedding proposal simply resonated with me more. This wasn't about quality or service - just personal preference."

Nathan snatched the remote and violently shut off the television. The device shattered against the mahogany conference table.

"Some brilliant long-term strategy you had," Leonard Blackwood sneered, his face purple with rage. "Not only did you lose the Laurent wedding, but your pathetic PR stunt last night only helped our competitors. Explain to me exactly how you plan to salvage this disaster?"

Before Nathan could respond, Cassandra intervened with practiced concern. "Father, please don't upset yourself."

Cassandra, ever her mother Penelope's daughter, knew defending Nathan now would only deepen Leonard's resentment. "Isabella made it perfectly clear this was about personal taste, not our capabilities. Nathan did everything possible. That Evelyn Carter is simply too cunning - always three steps ahead. Such is business, I suppose."

Nathan's head snapped up, his glare murderous. "Evelyn played fair. The failure is entirely ours."

Cassandra's eyes narrowed to slits as she bit her tongue. How noble of you to defend your ex-wife now that the damage is done. Keep digging that grave, brother dear.

"Tell me you didn't throw this deliberately, Nathan," Leonard demanded, veins bulging at his temples.

"Of course not." Nathan kept his gaze lowered.

"Need I remind you that woman is your ex-wife?" Leonard slammed his fist on the table. "She has no connection to Blackwood Industries anymore - she's the enemy. Not even a friendly acquaintance. That scheming witch has been a thorn in our side for months. I've tolerated her interference out of respect for your past relationship, but my patience has limits!"

Nathan's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists as he met his father's livid stare, his own eyes burning with barely restrained fury.

"What's that look, boy? You challenging me now?" Despite his bluster, Leonard's pulse quickened.

That same dangerous glint had been in Nathan's eyes years ago when his mother leapt from the penthouse balcony. Even now, decades later, Leonard could still see the ghost of that moment staring back at him through his son's eyes.
###Chapter 368

Even though Evelyn and I are divorced, and she's no longer my wife, she's still untouchable.

Nathan's eyes darkened with a dangerous glint as he took a menacing step forward. The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

Leonard recoiled slightly, his face paling. The tension between father and son crackled in the air like static before a storm.

Cassandra swallowed hard, unnerved by the icy fury radiating from her half-brother.

But she quickly composed herself, moving behind Leonard with a practiced, saccharine smile. She began massaging his shoulders with deliberate strokes.

"Don't waste your energy arguing with Nathan over Evelyn, Dad," she purred. "She may have the advantage now, but the final outcome isn't decided yet."

Leonard's eyes sharpened with interest. "Are you saying you can change the situation?"

Cassandra's lips curved into a confident smirk. "If you let me take over the Isabella Laurent project, I have a way to win her back."

She tilted her head, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Just because Isabella announced her wedding will be at Monarch Grand Hotels doesn't mean it's set in stone. Plans can always... change."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

He knew his sister well. Cassandra was ambitious but lacked the intelligence to back it up.

Yet this time, she was challenging him with unnerving confidence.

Something wasn't right.

"Excellent!" Leonard beamed, patting Cassandra's hand. "I knew I could rely on you. You've always had vision."

He turned to Nathan with a dismissive wave. "You're off the project. Cassandra will handle everything with Isabella. I don't want you anywhere near Evelyn again."

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Leonard never praised his achievements, but he was always quick to punish him at the slightest misstep.

To Leonard, Nathan would always be the illegitimate son—a threat to his authority.

"Thank you, Daddy!" Cassandra wrapped her arms around Leonard's neck, shooting Nathan a triumphant look.

"You'll be rewarded when you succeed," Leonard promised indulgently. "What would you like? A penthouse? A yacht?"

Cassandra giggled. "I don't want material things. I'm a Blackwood—I want to contribute to our family's legacy."

She leaned in, her voice turning sly. "If I secure Isabella's wedding, I want to be General Manager of Blackwood Hotel. Let me prove I can run it better than Evelyn ever did."

Nathan's lips twitched in dark amusement.

So that was her game.

"Done," Leonard agreed without hesitation.

Cassandra smirked at Nathan, already envisioning his humiliation when she stripped him of his power.

But Nathan's eyes held a silent warning—this wasn't over.
###Chapter 369

Nathan Blackwood stepped out of the chairman's office and made his way back to his own.

Theodore Winslow had a fresh cup of coffee waiting. His brow furrowed with concern as he asked cautiously, "How did it go, Mr. Blackwood? I hope the chairman didn’t give you too much trouble."

Nathan moved to the sofa with effortless grace, sinking into the plush cushions. He lifted the cup to his lips, taking a slow sip, his expression unreadable.

"He didn’t."

Theodore exhaled in relief.

"As if that would ever happen."

Nathan’s voice was dry. "He’s never been much of a father to me."

Theodore scoffed. "Sometimes I wish he wasn’t."

Nathan downed the rest of the now-lukewarm coffee, its bitterness lingering on his tongue. "A shame I share half his DNA."

He set the cup down with deliberate calm. "Leonard has tasked Cassandra with convincing Isabella Wang to use our hotels as her wedding venue."

Theodore’s eyes widened. "What?"

Nathan smirked. "After all the effort we put into the proposal—countless meetings, sleepless nights—this is the thanks I get. Instead of acknowledging my contributions, he hands my work over to her." His jaw tightened. "No doubt Penelope Whitmore put her up to it."

"That’s not all," Nathan added, his voice dangerously soft. "If Cassandra succeeds, she’ll take over management of Blackwood Hotels."

Leonard had never been skilled at business, but he excelled at one thing—making his son’s life a living hell.

Theodore clenched his fists. "Did you challenge the decision? You can’t just let Cassandra steal your project!"

Nathan arched a brow. "Would it matter? Leonard and Cassandra are on the same team. He’s been looking for an excuse to strip me of authority."

His tone was eerily calm. "Cassandra just gave him one."

Nathan had long learned not to let every slight rattle him—otherwise, he’d have died of stress years ago.

"So we’re just supposed to sit back and take it?" Theodore hissed through gritted teeth.

Nathan said nothing, savoring the last traces of coffee.

Theodore hesitated before speaking again. "To be honest, I’m a little disappointed in Evelyn, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan’s lips curled slightly. "You’ve always admired her. What changed?"

"Business is business," Theodore muttered. "She shouldn’t mix personal feelings into this. I think she’s trying to get back at you—leading you straight off a cliff."

Nathan’s expression darkened for a fraction of a second before smoothing over. "I understand her. I’ve hurt her before." The ghost of regret flickered in his eyes.

"But at this rate, you could lose everything in the company!" Theodore argued. "Sebastian Kingsley adores her. She’ll never see things from your perspective. You’re alone here, and she has the power of her family behind her. One day, she might just—"

"Don’t worry," Nathan interrupted, a faint smile playing on his lips. "I’m not so easily defeated."

His voice dropped lower. "Even if being her husband is in the past, I don’t deserve her if I can’t hold my ground. That’s why I have a plan."

Theodore leaned in. "What plan?"

Nathan closed his eyes briefly, exhaling before meeting Theodore’s gaze. "I have to win. All of it."

Theodore understood instantly.

If Nathan couldn’t claim victory, he’d rather burn everything to the ground.

"I won’t let anyone—or anything—stand in her way."

Nathan had an evening meeting scheduled, but he canceled it without hesitation. Instead, he drove straight to Monarch Grand Hotel.

Stepping into the grand lobby, a wave of conflicting emotions washed over him.

The first time he’d come here, Evelyn had tricked him—making him climb endless stairs to her office only to humiliate him with a decoy.

The memory still stung.
###Chapter 370

No woman had ever left Nathan Blackwood feeling so utterly defeated. Not even when Victoria Sterling had used and betrayed him—that had only ignited his fury.

Nathan's lips twisted into a bitter smile as he surveyed the newly renovated hotel lobby. Monarch Grand Hotels operated with far more precision than the outdated Blackwood Hotel ever had.

Evelyn Carter had played the role of a naive, submissive country girl when they married. Though he'd never looked down on her humble origins, he'd always believed she didn't belong in his world.

Now, the truth struck him like a slap—he was the one who hadn't belonged in hers.

For three years, Evelyn had set aside her pride and dignity to stay by his side. He had been closest to her during their marriage, yet he'd been blind to her worth.

It was never Evelyn who had been unattainable.

Theodore Winslow was deep in discussion with two hotel executives when he turned and spotted Nathan lingering in the lobby. Shock flickered across his face before his expression hardened into icy disdain.

"That will be all for now. Return to your duties."

"Of course, Mr. Winslow."

Once the executives departed, Theodore strode toward Nathan with deliberate coolness.

"Mr. Blackwood, the restaurant is to your left, the bar to your right, and the café is on the third floor. If you require accommodations, the front desk can assist you."

"I'm here to see Ms. Carter." Nathan cut straight to the point, his gaze scanning the ceiling as if it held answers.

"My employer doesn't entertain every random visitor who walks through those doors." Theodore's voice dripped with barely concealed contempt.

If not for professional decorum, he would have had security throw Nathan out immediately.

"Say what you will, but I'm not leaving until I see her."

Nathan had never been one to tolerate insults, yet here he stood, weathering Theodore's hostility without flinching. A few harsh words meant nothing compared to the restless nights he'd endure if he walked away now.

"Evelyn has no interest in seeing you, Nathan. You'll only upset her."

Theodore's eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening. His next words came out in a low, dangerous growl. "If you have any sense left, you'll walk out that door right now. As long as I'm here, you won't get within ten feet of her."

"Fine. But I need to hear that from Evelyn herself."

Nathan didn't budge, his resolve unwavering.

"You don't get to make that decision for her."

"Nathan! Are you trying to start a scene?"

Theodore's temper flared, but before he could unleash his fury, a smooth, cheerful voice cut through the tension.

The sound sent an unpleasant shiver down Nathan's spine.

"Mr. Winslow, is Evelyn available?"

Nathan turned to see Alexander Whitmore strolling into the lobby, impeccably dressed and radiating confidence.

The two strikingly handsome men now stood before Theodore, their mutual animosity crackling in the air like static. Theodore found himself caught between them, bracing for the inevitable clash.

Alexander couldn't have chosen a worse time to appear.

For a fleeting second, Theodore considered locking them both in a room and letting them tear each other apart.

"We're in a professional setting, Mr. Whitmore. You will address her as Ms. Carter or Ms. Kingsley—especially on hotel premises." Theodore's tone left no room for argument, his disdain for both men equally apparent.

Nathan's lips curled slightly. For once, Evelyn's infuriating secretary didn't seem quite so unbearable.

"Very well. Is Ms. Kingsley available? I'd like to invite her to dinner tonight as thanks for securing Sebastian Laurent's autographed album for my mother."

Alexander remained unruffled, proving himself adept at choosing his battles.

"She's occupied." Theodore's reply was meant for both of them.

"I can wait."

Nathan and Alexander answered simultaneously, their voices overlapping with identical determination.
###Chapter 371

Even in Evelyn's absence, she maintained complete awareness of every happening within the Monarch Grand Hotel.

"Mr. Blackwood and Mr. Whitmore are requesting to see you, Ms. Carter. What should I tell them?"

Theodore adjusted his earpiece and turned slightly, lowering his voice to a discreet murmur.

Both men stiffened, their postures betraying their nervous anticipation.

"See me? Whatever for? Are they expecting some special discount?" Evelyn's voice carried through the earpiece with cool detachment.

"Ms. Carter, they're insisting on meeting with you personally. I can't simply have security remove them." Theodore found himself in an awkward position - dealing with Nathan and Alexander wasn't exactly straightforward.

"Ask them their purpose for this visit." Evelyn's tone remained unreadable.

"Ms. Carter wishes to know the nature of your business," Theodore relayed with visible irritation.

"I'd like to invite Ms. Carter to dinner as a gesture of gratitude."

Alexander adjusted his designer glasses with a practiced smile.

"My mother received that signed album from Sebastian Laurent you arranged. She's absolutely thrilled. Insisted I properly thank you - she'd feel terrible accepting such a gift without reciprocation."

His sidelong glance at Nathan spoke volumes.

Alexander was banking on Evelyn's inherent kindness making refusal impossible.

After all, even if she harbored no romantic interest in him, he was certainly preferable to that emotionally unavailable cheat who'd broken her heart.

Theodore turned expectantly to Nathan.

"Business matters," came the clipped response.

Alexander's brow furrowed.

After a brief pause, Evelyn's instructions crackled through: "Bring Mr. Blackwood to me."

Both Theodore and Alexander froze in shock.

Nathan's lips curved in satisfaction.

The undisguised triumph on his face resembled that of a child chosen first for team sports.

"If you'll follow me, Mr. Blackwood."

Theodore spun on his heel, irritation evident in his stiff movements.

As Nathan strode away, Alexander concealed the storm in his eyes behind his glasses. Fury burned through him.

When Alexander returned alone to the underground parking, his secretary immediately recognized the failed mission and silently ushered him into the waiting car with practiced deference.

Leaning back, Alexander closed his eyes - but the tension in his jaw betrayed his simmering rage.

Evelyn had chosen Nathan.

This unprecedented humiliation consumed Alexander entirely. It felt like a public slap across the face before his rival.

"Destination, Mr. Whitmore?" The secretary ventured cautiously.

"Did I give you permission to speak?" The icy question hung in the air.

The secretary immediately bowed his head, a cold sweat breaking across his brow.

Several tense minutes passed before Alexander finally opened his eyes, fingers clenching until his knuckles cracked audibly.

"Investigate Julian Montgomery's sister and her current relationship with Nathan."

"Julian has a sister?"

Alexander's eyes glinted dangerously.

"I'll begin immediately." The secretary practically trembled with apprehension.

"Take me to Vertigo." Alexander closed his eyes again.

Vertigo Club - the exclusive establishment he'd discreetly registered under his secretary's name five years prior.

The woman managing it had been instrumental in navigating Crestview's elite circles.

Now, she might serve another purpose entirely.

With this thought, Alexander adjusted his glasses, a sinister smirk playing across his lips.

Theodore led Nathan through the hotel's bustling kitchen corridors.

Nathan nervously adjusted his Windsor knot, stealing glances at his reflection in the polished stainless steel surfaces.

Not even his military commendations or his inaugural board meeting as Blackwood Industries' CEO had made him this nervous.
###Chapter 372

Theodore stepped aside with visible reluctance. "Ms. Carter said you may enter." His posture remained rigid, as though proximity to Nathan might contaminate him.

N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.

"Appreciate it."

Theodore's scowl deepened, his resentment undisguised. "Don't thank me. Ms. Carter's being generous. Were it up to me..." His fingers flexed into fists. "You'd be leaving in an ambulance."

He shoved open the kitchen door with unnecessary force before stalking away.

Nathan exhaled slowly, steeling himself before crossing the threshold.

Monarch Grand Hotel's kitchen gleamed like a surgical suite - all sterile stainless steel and immaculate white surfaces. The only sounds were his own ragged breathing and the pounding of his pulse.

Rounding a corner, he spotted the slender figure working behind a towering steel counter. The massive workstation dwarfed her petite frame.

Evelyn Carter stole his breath yet again.

Clad in spotless chef's whites with her hair secured beneath a cap and face masked, she meticulously sculpted dough with surgical precision using silver shears. So engrossed in her craft, she remained oblivious to his presence.

Nathan's vision blurred as Agnes Thornton's words echoed in his mind:

"Mr. Blackwood, that dessert wasn't purchased or made by our chef. Young Madam prepared it specially for you. The head chef claims her skills surpass his own. You enjoyed every bite without realizing the effort poured into that small creation. She locked herself in the kitchen all day, never once complaining about her aching joints."

A tidal wave of remorse crashed over him.

This marked his first time witnessing Evelyn in her culinary element. These were the hidden hours of her three years as a Blackwood.

She'd infused every dish with devotion - her passion, her exhaustion, her unreciprocated love - while he'd dismissed each offering without gratitude.

What a fool he'd been, systematically destroying every shred of affection she'd ever held for him.

Evelyn's brow furrowed in concentration as she shaped the delicate pastry destined for Isabella Laurent to deliver to her mother. The intricate dessert had consumed her entire afternoon - four painstaking hours yielding just four completed pieces.

"Finally!" She exhaled in relief, admiring her fifth creation. Lifting an arm, she dabbed at her damp forehead with her sleeve.

The sudden crunching sound made her freeze.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Her gasp sliced through the kitchen as wide eyes locked onto the intruder. "Nathan! What the hell—"

He maintained eye contact while deliberately taking another bite.

Only three pastries remained on the tray.

"Spit that out right now!" Crimson fury stained Evelyn's cheeks, her fists clenching with the urge to strike him. "You have no right!"

Nathan chewed slowly, savoring the flavors. "Exquisite."

"You bastard! That's not for you!"

Seeing red, Evelyn lunged for the half-eaten pastry.

Nathan hastily shoved the remainder into his mouth.

"Damn you, Nathan Blackwood!"

Her scream echoed off stainless steel. In her rage, she failed to notice the freshly mopped floor. Her feet slid out from under her, sending her crashing against his solid chest.

Thud!

Nathan's back slammed into the counter, pain flashing across his features. Instinctively, his arms encircled Evelyn to break her fall.

As his grip tightened, her breathing grew erratic.

Time suspended around them.

Through the thin barrier of her surgical mask, the softness of Evelyn's lips met his in accidental contact.

Both froze.

Nathan's eyelids grew heavy, lashes fluttering shut. Despite every ounce of self-control, heat pooled low in his abdomen, his body betraying his better judgment.
###Chapter 373

Evelyn shoved against Nathan's solid chest to break free. She stumbled backward, her spine colliding with the freezer door.

Her breath hitched. Eyes wide, she felt heat flood her cheeks as perspiration prickled her skin.

Even through the mask, the ghost of his lips burned against hers.

Damn it! Why did she feel like this? Evelyn's chest heaved, her face scorching as she ripped the mask off and flung it to the floor.

No way was she reusing that. It was tainted now.

Nathan rose slowly, bracing himself against the counter's edge. His brows knitted as he pressed his lips—still flushed from the kiss—into a thin line.

Outwardly composed, he couldn't ignore the frantic drumming of his heart.

"Doesn't your back hurt?"

His voice was distant, still dazed from what had just happened. Yet he forced calm into his tone.

"Not your concern."

Evelyn clenched her jaw, fury simmering. That man had stolen her dessert. "Why the hell did you eat my food without asking, Nathan? I spent all afternoon on it—not for you to devour."

"It's been years since I've tasted your cooking." His gaze darkened. "I wanted to savor it again. You used to bake for me."

Nathan wasn’t a man who lived for food. He often skipped meals when work consumed him.

But when Evelyn poured her soul into cooking? That was irresistible. Resentment and longing had driven him to take it.

He hadn’t thought—just acted. If he hesitated, the chance would vanish.

"Ha! That was then."

Evelyn's voice dripped venom. "I cooked and cleaned for you when you were my husband. Now? You're nothing. Who gave you the right to touch my food? I'd rather throw it to stray dogs than let you have a bite."

The words struck like a blade.

Nathan’s expression darkened, pain flickering in his eyes.

He searched her face, desperate to find traces of the woman who once spent hours in the kitchen just to please him.

Was that love truly gone?

Had nothing remained?

Leaving him frozen, Evelyn snatched the remaining pastries with a scowl and locked them in the cabinet.

She didn’t trust him near her things.

"My apologies." Nathan exhaled. "I didn’t realize it mattered so much to you."

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered, emotions raw. She turned her back, scrubbing her hands under the faucet. "Weren’t you here for business? Spit it out. I’m busy, and you’re wasting my time."

Nathan steadied himself. "I came to tell you—I’m no longer overseeing Isabella’s wedding arrangements."

Evelyn paused mid-scrub, then scoffed. "And? She’s already signed with Monarch Grand Hotels. All you can do now is watch us make history."

Ignoring her jab, Nathan continued, "Leonard handed control to Cassandra."

Evelyn whirled around, eyes sharp.

"You’re clever." Nathan’s voice lowered. "You know what that means."

"So this is why you came?" She crossed her arms, smirking. "Still the same selfish man. You lost, so you’re warning me—hoping I’ll deal with Cassandra for you?"

She scoffed. "Please. Cassandra’s schemes are amateur hour. Even if she tries to sabotage me, she’s about as sharp as a spoon. Maybe in her next life, she’ll stand a chance."

Nathan’s lips twitched, tension easing.

Oddly, her sharp tongue was endearing—when it wasn’t aimed at him.

"Still," he murmured, "Cassandra isn’t working alone. Penelope’s backing her."
###Chapter 374

Nathan's voice was low with warning. "Penelope is cunning and manipulative. I'm concerned she might target you, so I came to warn you personally."

Evelyn turned away, her expression carefully blank. "That's all you wanted to say? Don't let me keep you from your work."

He studied the rigid line of her shoulders for a long moment before turning to leave.

"Wait." Her voice stopped him mid-step.

His pulse jumped as he turned back.

"Why tell me this?" Evelyn's gaze was sharp with suspicion. "You understand the stakes better than anyone. Any Blackwood Industries executive could gain prestige by securing Isabella's endorsement. That was always your plan."

She crossed her arms. "So why change tactics now?"

"I want you to win."

Nathan's eyes held rare sincerity - a startling sight from a man hardened by a decade in cutthroat business.

Her laugh was bitter. "We were married for three years and you treated me like furniture. Now that we're divorced, you suddenly care about loyalty?" She gestured toward the door. "Don't let the doorknob hit you on the way out, Mr. Blackwood."

The dismissal stung just as sharply as the first time.

At the Montgomery estate, Isabelle summoned Cassandra to her private music room after nightfall.

The heavy oak door clicked shut behind them.

"What's so urgent?" Cassandra asked, perching on a velvet settee.

Isabelle's fingers hovered over the grand piano. "Five days since Monarch Grand Hotels announced their partnership with Isabella. Still no plan to deal with that gold-digging social climber?"

Cassandra's nose wrinkled at the condescending tone. "Rome wasn't built in a day, Isabelle. These things require—"

"Tsk. Pathetic." Isabelle lifted the piano lid with a flourish and retrieved a manila folder. It landed at Cassandra's feet with a slap.

Biting back her pride, Cassandra picked it up. The dossier contained a photo of a sharp-featured woman with piercing eyes.

"Vivian Prescott? Who's she?"

"A reporter for Spotlight News." Isabelle played a discordant chord. "Small-time gossip rag. But look at her family background."

Cassandra scanned the pages, then gasped. "Vincent Prescott... former VP of Monarch Grand Hotels? The one Evelyn sent to prison for embezzlement?"

Isabelle's smile was feline. "Exactly. Two years behind bars thanks to your dear sister-in-law. I'd say Miss Prescott has quite the axe to grind."

The pieces clicked together. Cassandra's eyes gleamed with malicious understanding. "And as a journalist, she'd have the perfect platform to destroy Evelyn's reputation."

Isabelle's laughter filled the room as her fingers danced across the keys in a triumphant arpeggio.
###Chapter 375

Only fourteen days remained until Isabella Wang's wedding.

Evelyn Carter had been drowning in work lately—adjusting designs to Isabella's exact preferences, supervising venue preparations, and double-checking every material, cost, and staff member. On her most grueling day, she had managed only three hours of sleep.

Yet, she thrived on it. With a clear, lucrative goal in sight, her motivation never wavered.

After a morning meeting with her team, Evelyn sat in her office, nibbling on a sandwich while reviewing documents.

Theodore Winslow knocked and entered, carrying a steaming cup of coffee. Despite her exhaustion, Evelyn still looked effortlessly radiant. Theodore sighed, shaking his head with an affectionate smile. "You know it's terrible for digestion to eat while working."

"I don’t have a choice. There’s a jewelry event later," Evelyn replied, taking another bite without glancing up.

"Why is your schedule so packed today? I noticed you finally had a free afternoon and wanted to book you a spa session." Theodore frowned, concerned.

"Save it for after Isabella’s wedding. I can’t relax with so much on my mind."

Evelyn lifted the coffee mug, meeting his gaze. "Any updates on Cassandra and Penelope these past few days?"

"I’ve been monitoring them, but they’ve been unusually quiet. Nothing suspicious."

Theodore hesitated before adding, "With our plans moving forward smoothly, maybe they’ve finally accepted defeat."

Evelyn smirked, recalling her recent conversation with Nathan Blackwood. "I wouldn’t underestimate them. After Cassandra stole the spotlight from Nathan, do you really think she’d retreat without a fight? What would she tell Leonard? No, she won’t give up that easily."

A sharp knock interrupted them.

The administrative secretary entered, carrying an elegant white gift box. "The pastries from the kitchen are ready, as requested, Ms. Carter."

"Thank you. Just leave them on the coffee table."

Once the secretary left, Theodore opened the box, admiring the intricately crafted desserts. They were a testament to Evelyn’s dedication to perfection. He chuckled.

"Get ready, Theo. We leave in five."

That afternoon, Nathan returned to his office after a grueling meeting.

"Mr. Blackwood, you received an invitation to today’s Luxe Bijoux exhibition a week ago. Isabella Laurent will be attending. We don’t—"

Before his assistant could finish, Nathan cut him off. "I’m not going."

"Are you certain?"

Nathan’s lips curled in disdain. "Cassandra will be there. She’s the one who charmed Isabella into this arrangement."

His assistant cleared his throat. "Well, I’ve just been informed that Ms. Carter is already at the event."

A flicker of interest passed through Nathan’s dark eyes.

"Bring the car around. And prepare a fresh suit."

The Luxe Bijoux showcase was being held at the Crestview International Convention Center.

The event was a dazzling affair, drawing fashion moguls, industry elites, and A-list celebrities who strutted down the red carpet as if it were the Met Gala.

Among them, Isabella Laurent stood out—not just as the most luminous star, but also as the face of Luxe Bijoux in Silvercrest.

As the heiresses of Crestview’s most powerful conglomerates, Cassandra Blackwood and Isabelle Montgomery had secured spots on the guest list—positions lesser celebrities would kill for.

Cassandra and Isabelle lingered on the red carpet, striking exaggerated poses for the cameras. The press grew visibly irritated as they hogged the spotlight far longer than necessary.

If the host hadn’t repeatedly urged them inside, they might have planted themselves there permanently.

"Good grief, don’t they have mirrors at home?" a journalist muttered. "It’s embarrassing how they’re clinging to this carpet like it’s their last lifeline."
###Chapter 376

The flashing cameras barely spared a glance for Isabelle Montgomery and Cassandra Blackwood as they strutted down the red carpet.

I could've ignored their presence entirely, but their smug expressions as they tried to outshine Isabella Wang made my blood boil.

Delusional socialites, believing they could dictate fashion trends.

I didn't bother taking a single photo. Why waste precious memory on such irrelevance?

Cassandra, the so-called heiress of Blackwood Industries. Isabelle, sister to Julian Montgomery, the so-called Prince of Crestview.

Neither had earned their fame—just their trust funds.

No doubt they'd paid for their spot in the lineup.

Flushed with self-importance, the two swept into the venue, expecting adoration.

Instead, they found themselves invisible.

Reporters flocked to A-listers like Isabella or legendary designers like Rosalind Walker.

Not a single journalist approached them.

"Are they blind?" Cassandra hissed, stomping her Louboutin in frustration. "How dare they ignore us? I'll have their press passes revoked!"

Isabelle sneered. "Typical vultures. They only chase real stars—not wannabes with daddy's credit cards."

The barb hit its mark.

Cassandra's smile turned venomous. "Funny. Mother always warned me against mingling with the media. She says it's... undignified for people of our standing."

A not-so-subtle dig at Isabelle's desperate social climbing.

Isabelle's cheeks flushed. "I prefer privacy. Unlike some, I don't need paparazzi to validate my worth."

Their fake camaraderie shattered as they turned away from each other.

Then—commotion.

A wave of excited murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"It's Evelyn Carter!"

"She wasn't on the red carpet! How does she always slip past the cameras?"

"The Monarch Group heiress—managing five-star hotels and now organizing Isabella Wang's wedding!"

"Gorgeous, brilliant, and actually accomplished. Unlike certain trust-fund princesses..."

The unspoken comparison burned.

Reporters surged forward, two accidentally jostling Cassandra and Isabelle in their haste.

The socialites stumbled, nearly face-planting on the marble floor.

"Watch where you're going!" Cassandra shrieked, clutching her designer gown.

Isabelle trembled with rage as the media swarm ignored them completely.

"Ms. Carter!" a reporter called out. "Monarch Group beat Blackwood Industries for Isabella Wang's wedding contract. Your thoughts?"

Evelyn's voice carried effortless grace. "Working with Isabella is an honor. But let's be clear—this wasn't about 'beating' anyone. Blackwood Hotels set industry standards in Crestview long before Monarch existed. One contract doesn't define our professional respect."

Murmurs of admiration followed.

"So poised!"

"Classy, unlike those other heiresses who'd gloat over a rival's loss."

Isabelle's nails dug into her palms.

Then she noticed it—the crimson pendant resting against Evelyn's collarbone.

A flawless red beryl, rarer than diamonds.

Cassandra audibly gulped, covetous gaze locked on the gem.

But Isabelle's sharp eyes caught something else.

A slow, calculating smile curved her lips as a scheme took shape.
###Chapter 377

Evelyn attended the fashion gala tonight with clear intentions.

She wasn't here to flaunt her status as the Kingsley heiress. Two crucial matters demanded her attention.

First, she needed to address those vicious rumors about stealing the Westridge project from Blackwood Industries. The media would get their exclusive interview, and she'd set the record straight once and for all.

Second, she carried a carefully selected gift for Isabella Laurent. But beneath that gracious gesture, her sharp eyes tracked Cassandra Blackwood's every move. That scheming woman wouldn't ruin tonight's events - not on Evelyn's watch.

Isabella approached with a distinguished gentleman in a tailored espresso tuxedo. "Ms. Kingsley, allow me to introduce someone special."

"This is Edmund Windsor, CEO of Luxe Bijoux," Isabella said with a graceful gesture. "An old friend of mine."

"Edmund, meet Evelyn Kingsley, General Manager of Monarch Grand Hotels. A true rising star in Fairhaven's business circles."

Edmund hailed from Valmont's aristocratic circles, his royal lineage evident in his bearing.

This wasn't his first visit to Crestview or the country of Orealm. He'd developed a deep affection for this nation years ago.

"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Windsor. Welcome to Crestview." Evelyn extended her hand with practiced elegance.

Edmund's smile warmed as he clasped her hand. "The honor is entirely mine, Ms. Kingsley. Your presence elevates our event."

Isabella's gaze flickered between them. Something felt... off.

They were supposed to be strangers, yet their interaction carried the ease of old acquaintances.

The press corps buzzed with speculation.

Edmund Windsor, with his blue blood and aristocratic bearing, rarely showed such warmth to anyone. Yet he smiled at Evelyn like she was family.

But then again, Evelyn Kingsley was extraordinary. And beautiful women always commanded attention.

"What an unexpected surprise, Ms. Kingsley. Fancy meeting you here."

Isabelle Montgomery glided forward, her elaborate train swirling behind her. With her dimpled smile and wide eyes, she played the innocent angel perfectly.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial as it settled on Isabelle.

Without acknowledging the interruption, she turned back to her companions. "Shall we continue our conversation over there?"

The deliberate snub made Isabelle's blood boil. Her fingers clenched around her clutch until her knuckles whitened.

How dare Evelyn dismiss her? Her brother was Julian Montgomery!

Just as the trio turned to leave, Isabelle called out with saccharine sweetness, "That's a remarkable jewelry set, Ms. Kingsley. The crimson beryl pairs exquisitely with the rose gold. It caught my eye from across the room."

All attention shifted to Evelyn's necklace.

Evelyn's lips curved in a cool smile. "How kind of you to notice."

"But correct me if I'm wrong," Isabelle continued, her eyes glinting with malice, "these pieces don't appear to be from Luxe Bijoux's collection."

The crowd leaned in for closer inspection. Isabelle was right.

While Evelyn's jewelry was undeniably stunning, connoisseurs could tell it wasn't Luxe Bijoux's signature style.

A major breach of etiquette - right before the brand's CEO.

"Considering this is Luxe Bijoux's exclusive event," Isabelle purred, chin lifted in challenge, "wearing another designer's work seems rather... gauche. With Monarch Group's resources at your disposal, compliance shouldn't be difficult. Unless..." Her eyes widened in faux realization. "Are these your own designs? Using Luxe Bijoux's platform to promote your brand? How very... entrepreneurial of you. Then again, you did outmaneuver Mr. Blackwood in business. Marketing opportunities everywhere, hmm?"

Her barbed words hung in the air.

The journalists erupted in hushed whispers, cameras trained on Evelyn's reaction.
###Chapter 378

"She's the heiress of Monarch Group. Surely she understands industry etiquette."

"Obviously. She's probably exploiting the situation. The tactics businesswomen employ these days... Who knows what shady methods she used to win over Isabella and outmaneuver Mr. Blackwood."

"How disappointing. I had such high hopes for Ms. Carter, but she's proven herself utterly unscrupulous."

Isabelle Montgomery's lips curled in triumph. She'd successfully turned the tide. "You arrogant little witch, Evelyn. Today will be your reckoning." Destroying someone's reputation was always more effective than direct confrontation.

Unseen by Isabelle, Nathan Blackwood had witnessed the entire exchange from the shadows.

The imposing figure remained motionless, his icy gaze fixed on Isabelle's smug expression. The impeccable lines of his tailored suit accentuated his powerful frame as his expression darkened.

"Sir, that woman is harassing your wife," Theodore Winslow whispered urgently.

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line.

He leaned forward slightly, then stilled.

"Wait."

Theodore blinked in confusion.

"That's Evelyn Carter. She doesn't need rescuing like some damsel in distress."

Nathan's eyes narrowed with an unconscious tenderness that would have shocked anyone who knew him. "And if she does require assistance... she has me."

His hand absently touched his chest.

Nathan added in a voice like velvet-covered steel, "She's mine. No one gets to torment her except me."

Theodore nearly choked. Since when did the infamous Ice Prince of Blackwood Industries melt like spring snow? What a pity Ms. Carter couldn't see this unprecedented display of devotion.

Meanwhile, the crowd's murmurs grew louder.

Evelyn's jewelry choice had caused quite the scandal. Promoting a competing brand at a corporate event? Unthinkable.

Cassandra Blackwood lurked behind Isabelle, savoring Evelyn's humiliation.

Evelyn remained composed as Isabelle stirred the pot. Her unshakable poise only fueled Isabelle's irritation.

Where were the tears? The panic? The desperate explanations Isabelle had anticipated?

This wasn't going according to plan.

"Ms. Carter," Edmund Windsor finally spoke, his cultured voice cutting through the whispers. "I couldn't help but notice you're wearing Luxe Bijoux's Eternal Bloom collection. Only ten sets exist worldwide."

"Yes, Mr. Windsor. I've always admired Luxe Bijoux's craftsmanship. This particular collection holds special meaning for me."

Isabelle's pulse quickened. The CEO of Luxe Bijoux had noticed her!

"Then you must know," Edmund continued, his gaze lingering on the delicate rose gold earring adorning Evelyn's left ear, "the Eternal Bloom collection drew inspiration from a remarkable designer's work - Alexa's Passion's Thorn."

From Nathan's vantage point, Edmund's appreciative stare was far too intimate.

His knuckles whitened around his champagne flute.

"The jewelry Ms. Carter wears tonight is the original Passion's Thorn design. To put it bluntly," Edmund announced to the stunned crowd, "without Passion's Thorn, there would be no Eternal Bloom collection."
###Chapter 379

Gasps echoed through the crowd.

Evelyn Carter and Cassandra Blackwood weren’t the only ones stunned. As Theodore Windsor’s close friend and Alexa’s biggest admirer, Isabella Laurent was equally floored.

She had heard whispers about Passion’s Thorn, but she had never laid eyes on it.

For the first time in her life, Isabella envied the elite.

Evelyn shot Theodore a subtle, grateful glance.

She didn’t need to defend herself—Theodore had already taken care of the troublemakers at his event.

There was no point wasting energy on insignificant people.

Nathan Blackwood’s gaze remained locked on Evelyn, his jaw clenched.

He was certain she knew Theodore—and that they were far closer than he liked.

"Who is that man?" Nathan demanded, his voice icy.

"Theodore Windsor is the CEO of Luxe Bijoux," someone murmured. "His grandfather was the last Duke of Valmont, and his grandmother founded the brand. The Windsor family owns it outright."

Another voice chimed in, "They also gifted him a massive estate. And that’s not all—he’s one of the top five wealthiest men in Valmont, worth billions. Mrs. Carter is incredible! Who knew she had royal connections?"

Nathan’s fingers curled into fists, his knuckles whitening.

"Did you see how Mr. Windsor defended her? Do you think he’s interested?"

A nearby guest gasped. "If he is, she could become a duchess! She’s already an heiress—imagine her marrying into royalty! That’s every woman’s dream!"

Nathan’s voice cut through the chatter like steel. "That won’t happen. He’s old enough to be her father. She wouldn’t be interested."

A gossipy attendee smirked. "You never know. Maybe she prefers older men. After all, she did fall for you, and you’re six years her senior."

Nathan shot him a glare that could freeze fire.

Six years was nothing compared to two decades.

The man paled, pressing his lips together in surrender.

Nathan’s irritation flared.

He wasn’t angry at Evelyn anymore for keeping secrets.

He was furious at the parade of extraordinary men orbiting her—pushing him further down the line.

"Unbelievable! The CEO of a global luxury brand just admitted to borrowing Alexa’s designs. Isn’t that embarrassing for his company?"

"Not at all," another countered. "Mr. Windsor was honest. He didn’t copy—he was inspired by her work."

Theodore’s voice carried over the murmurs. "We did incorporate elements from Alexa’s designs."

The crowd fell silent.

He continued, "Ms. Alexa was fully aware. We discussed it privately, and she granted permission for us to use those elements in the Eternal Bloom collection. She even contributed to the designs."

A collective gasp rippled through the room.

Isabelle Montgomery’s smug expression shattered.

"So, Mrs. Carter isn’t just wearing Alexa’s jewelry—she’s wearing pieces approved for this event." Theodore’s gaze flicked to Evelyn before turning away.

Evelyn smirked. "There’s something else you don’t know, Ms. Montgomery."

She let the suspense build before delivering the final blow.

"Luxe Bijoux and Alexa have been partners for years. Every VIP member knows one rule: they’re welcome to wear Alexa’s pieces to our events and will be seated in the VVIP section. Not only that—Luxe Bijoux provides lifetime maintenance for any Alexa jewelry."

Her eyes gleamed with triumph.

"You claim to be a fan of Luxe Bijoux. How could you not know?"

Isabelle’s face drained of color.

She owned plenty of Luxe Bijoux pieces, but the membership threshold was impossibly high—requiring not just exorbitant spending but also an impeccable pedigree.

Despite being Julian Montgomery’s sister, she had never qualified.

And now, everyone knew it.
###Chapter 380

Cassandra discreetly retreated, putting distance between herself and Isabelle. She wanted no association with the disgraced woman now.

The journalists caught on quickly. Their gazes turned skeptical as they studied Isabelle.

"How ridiculous," one reporter muttered. "Ms. Montgomery accusing others when she's not even a VELVET member."

"She should focus on her own shortcomings rather than others'," another added.

"Owning a few jewelry pieces doesn't make one an expert. Bragging before Luxe Bijoux's CEO? He probably doesn't recognize her."

"Tsk. She lacks Ms. Kingsley's elegance entirely."

Isabelle's face drained of color at their words. Being ranked beneath Evelyn Carter? Unbearable.

Humiliation burned through her like wildfire.

Without sparing Isabelle a glance, Evelyn walked away, engaging in pleasant conversation with Edmund Windsor and Isabella Laurent.

The press flocked after them, abandoning Isabelle in her moment of shame.

"Oh no, Isabelle!" Cassandra rushed back, gripping her arm urgently. "Nathan's here!"

"Nathan? Where?" Isabelle's palms turned clammy.

"Right behind you. He's watching this way. I don't know how much he saw."

Isabelle turned stiffly.

There in the shadows stood Nathan Blackwood, his icy gaze piercing through her like daggers.

Her breath hitched. Her pulse stuttered. Time seemed to freeze.

"N-Nathan..."

His expression darkened. With a dismissive shake of his head, he turned away, Oliver Sinclair following silently.

The finality in that gesture shattered something inside Isabelle. She stumbled back, a cold dread seeping into her bones.

In the restroom, Isabelle's sobs echoed off the marble walls. "Damn her! Why won't that bitch just die? I wish a truck would run her over!"

Mascara streaked down her cheeks as she wept uncontrollably.

This wasn't just about social ruin. Nathan had witnessed her humiliation firsthand - no excuses would suffice now.

"I know, right?" Cassandra pretended to commiserate while secretly relishing the spectacle. "Why doesn't lightning strike her down?"

"Why didn't you help me?" Isabelle rounded on her. "You just stood there like an idiot!"

"I...I panicked!" Cassandra feigned distress. "You're always the clever one. What could I possibly add? If I were smarter, we'd have dealt with Evelyn long ago."

Sniffling, Isabelle demanded, "Any word from Vivian Prescott yet? Still nothing?"

"Patience," Cassandra soothed. "Good things come to those who wait. That woman despises Evelyn. She'll help us."

Her phone buzzed.

A wicked smile spread across Cassandra's face as she showed Isabelle the screen. "Speak of the devil! Vivian's calling."

Isabelle's tear-stained face twisted with malice. "This time, I'll make sure Evelyn Carter falls from grace permanently."
###Chapter 381

Vincent guided Evelyn and Isabella to the backstage lounge, where they sipped champagne and chatted.

The conversation flowed effortlessly until Isabella's phone buzzed. Her agent needed her for an urgent press interview.

Once she left, only Vincent and Evelyn remained in the softly lit room.

"It's been three years, Evelyn. How have you been?" Vincent's gaze was warm, filled with the quiet pride of a mentor. There was no hint of anything beyond professional respect.

Evelyn gave a small, wry smile. "As you can see, not much has changed."

"You've grown, though. I can see it in your eyes." Vincent studied her carefully, noting the subtle shadows beneath them. "Where did you go? Did you find inspiration abroad?"

She let out a soft laugh. "No grand adventures. Just the same routine—farmers' markets and quiet nights. The fire's gone out, I suppose."

"You always did have a way with words."

Vincent clinked his glass against hers, his expression thoughtful. "When will you reveal yourself as Alexa? It's a shame to keep such brilliance hidden."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "I want to, but timing is everything. Revealing it now could bring complications. When I do, it has to mean something—to have impact."

"Of course. I should’ve known you’d have a strategy." Vincent chuckled. "We’ve been friends long enough. If something’s troubling you, you can tell me."

Evelyn met his eyes, understanding the unspoken offer. "Someone’s been trying to take control of AX. The recent sales drop isn’t just bad luck—it’s sabotage."

Vincent nodded grimly. "Ms. Carter, I suspect Ms. Sterling is involved. She’s been throwing her weight around, but now it’s clear there’s more to it."

Evelyn shrugged elegantly. "Do what you must. You’ve handled everything impeccably so far. Whatever you decide, I’ll support you."

As the show’s opening music began, they left the lounge together.

They hadn’t taken more than a few steps when a deep voice cut through the murmur of the crowd.

"Evelyn."

Her pulse stuttered. She turned, frowning.

Nathan strode toward them, his expression unreadable. The moment his gaze landed on Vincent, his jaw tightened. Vincent, sensing the tension, raised a brow.

"Friend of yours, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Hardly."

Nathan wasn’t one for social events—especially not something as frivolous as a jewelry show. His presence here could only mean one thing: that insufferable admirer of his had dragged him along.

Nathan stopped before them, his attention fixed solely on Evelyn.

"Aren’t you going to introduce us?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "I don’t see why. Blackwood Industries has no stake in jewelry. Your circles don’t overlap."

Nathan’s lips thinned, but he didn’t retreat. Instead, he extended a hand to Vincent.

"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Windsor."

Vincent shook his hand, unfazed. "Likewise, Mr. Blackwood. I wasn’t aware you knew Ms. Carter."

Nathan’s grip tightened imperceptibly. "If you were close to her, you’d know exactly who I am."

Vincent’s eyes narrowed as he matched the pressure. The handshake became a silent battle of wills.

Nathan didn’t know what had come over him. He wasn’t usually this petty.

But something about seeing Evelyn with another man—especially one who looked at her like that—made his blood run hot.
###Chapter 382

Nathan Blackwood couldn't suppress the surge of irritation watching Evelyn Carter laugh with another man. Every fiber of his being demanded he eliminate all male presence around her.

This unfamiliar possessiveness baffled him. He was behaving like some jilted lover, not the composed billionaire heir he'd always been.

Self-control had been his greatest strength - until Evelyn entered the equation.

"Special relationship?" Evelyn's mocking laughter cut through his thoughts. "Ours is the 'good riddance' variety, Nathan."

His breath caught. "Evelyn." His voice emerged rougher than intended.

"Ex-husbands don't get to claim closeness." She tilted her chin defiantly. "A decent ex disappears permanently. Surely the great Nathan Blackwood understands basic etiquette?"

Theodore Windsor's eyebrows shot up. Married? His longtime friend Alexa - no, Evelyn - had never mentioned any marriage. What could have driven a woman like her to wed this possessive man?

"Make my life difficult all you want, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Your mere existence suffices to ruin my day. But Mr. Windsor here is invaluable to me. Harm him, and I'll make you regret it."

She arched one perfect brow. "Have some self-respect, darling ex-husband."

Nathan's jaw clenched until it ached. His fingernails bit into his palms.

Her defense of another man stung worse than any physical blow.

The woman who'd once loved him now treated him like roadkill.

"The gala's starting." Evelyn gestured toward the ballroom. "Shouldn't you attend to your little companion, Mr. Blackwood? She might throw a tantrum without her keeper."

She turned to leave with Theodore, but Nathan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

"Hey!" Theodore moved to intervene. "The divorce severed whatever claim you think you have."

Evelyn raised a staying hand. "Go ahead, Theodore. I'll handle this."

"But-"

"Relax." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "What's the worst a divorced man can do?"

Nathan felt the words like a knife twist. His grip tightened involuntarily.

Recognizing the private history between them, Theodore reluctantly departed after receiving Evelyn's reassuring nod.

The corridor fell silent save for Nathan's pounding heartbeat. Even holding his breath didn't steady him.

"Release me." Evelyn's struggle was all sharp elbows and cold fury. Her gaze held nothing but contempt.

"You meant Isabelle, didn't you?" The words tumbled out before he could stop them.

He pulled her flush against him, their sudden proximity making both inhale sharply.

"How interesting." Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "I never specified anyone. Your mind immediately jumped to Ms. Montgomery? How telling."

She said it deliberately, watching his reaction.

Nathan's lips twisted wryly. Arguing with her was like boxing shadows.

But curiosity outweighed anger. Who was he to her now?

"Are you jealous, Evelyn?" The question emerged hoarse.

Her laughter rang hollow. "Delusional as ever, Nathan? When I wore your ring, you paraded Victoria Sterling through Silvercrest's Christmas lights, commissioned exclusive jewelry for her. Your cruelty never once sparked my jealousy. Now that we're divorced, you dare ask?" Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "You always did overestimate your appeal."
###Chapter 383

Evelyn stood frozen as Nathan's grip tightened around her wrist. His touch burned like acid against her skin.

She was right about everything. Every accusation she'd thrown at him was true.

"There's nothing between Isabelle and me, Evelyn. She's just a friend!" Nathan's voice cracked with desperation, his ears turning crimson.

Apologies weren't in his nature, yet here he was, begging for understanding.

"Why tell me? It's none of my business."

Evelyn's patience had evaporated. Her gaze could have turned Medusa to stone. "I don't care what you do with your little playmates. Save your explanations for someone who gives a damn." She jerked her arm free. "I have a show to attend."

"If you didn't care, why bring it up? First at the police station, now here."

Nathan's eyes shimmered dangerously. His broad shoulders trembled with barely contained emotion. "You're keeping tabs on my relationships. That means you still feel something. You're not over me, no matter what you claim."

"This belongs to N?velDrama.Org: ?."

"It's not concern, Nathan. It's disgust."

Evelyn pried his fingers off one by one, her nails digging into his flesh. "Had I known you kept your ex-lovers on speed dial, I'd never have wasted my heart on you. The only regret I have is not leaving sooner when I discovered what a lying cheat you really are."

The air left Nathan's lungs as if she'd punched him.

The injustice of her words tasted like poison. He'd never felt so misunderstood.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn wavered at the raw pain in his expression.

Then she turned on her heel and walked away without looking back.

Some stories weren't meant for happy endings. Some wounds never fully healed. But life moved forward regardless.

Her phone vibrated. Theodore's name flashed on the screen.

"What's wrong, Theo?" She forced calm into her voice.

"Code red, Ms. Carter! Check Twitter immediately!" Theodore's panic was palpable.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She knew that tone.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen.

The blood drained from her face. "Goddammit!"

Isabella Laurent's leaked wedding photos dominated the trending list.

Months of meticulous planning. Countless sleepless nights. All ruined by some hacker's click.

Every detail laid bare for the world to see.

Nathan had been drowning in his own turmoil when Evelyn's curse snapped him back to reality. Against all odds, his lips curved upward.

This fiery version of Evelyn fascinated him more than the obedient wife she'd once been. She burned brighter now, more alive in her anger than she'd ever been in his arms.

He moved toward her.

But she was already sprinting down the corridor, her stilettos clicking against marble as she left him in the dust.

Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. Nathan watched her retreating figure and dialed Oliver's number.

"Mr. Blackwood."

"Status report on Monarch Group." His instincts screamed trouble. "Yes, sir. I was just about to brief you."
###Chapter 384

The wedding designs are exploding across social media. Every platform is flooded with the viral images.

The shares are multiplying by the minute.

Nathan's brow arched sharply. "Which media outlet leaked these?"

"A verified fashion journalist broke the story first."

"Some people have no boundaries." His eyes turned stormy as his jaw tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Theodore hesitated. "With the wedding setup exposed, could this damage Ms. Carter's reputation?"

"Undoubtedly. That's precisely why she vanished so abruptly. She's usually meticulous about controlling her public image."

Nathan stared at the empty seat Evelyn had occupied, his chest tightening. "If I'm not mistaken, Isabella must have included a confidentiality clause in her contract with Evelyn regarding the wedding details. This leak constitutes a clear violation."

"A contract breach? That serious?"

"With the setup revealed prematurely, Monarch Group has technically violated terms. Even if they don't owe Isabella financial compensation, I guarantee she'll take her wedding elsewhere. Monarch Grand Hotels just lost their star client." Nathan's voice was grave.

All of Evelyn's careful planning had been sabotaged in one fell swoop.

The prestigious Monarch Grand Hotel was suddenly out of the running!

"How?" Theodore gasped. "Ms. Carter is brilliant and detail-oriented. How could she get outmaneuvered like this?"

Nathan's hands balled into fists.

By all rights, as Evelyn's business rival, he should be celebrating Monarch Group's misfortune.

Yet no satisfaction came.

"Track down that journalist. I want to know who authorized this leak and why."

The exposed wedding venue photos became trending news within the hour.

Everyone at the fashion show buzzed about the stunning designs, oblivious to the brewing storm. They gushed over what a dream wedding it would be.

Isabella, however, was livid.

Before the finale, the superstar made a hasty exit, abandoning her front-row seat without even acknowledging Edmund Windsor.

From their vantage point, Isabelle and Cassandra observed everything.

"Vivian works fast." Isabelle's angelic face twisted with malice.

When Isabella stormed out, Isabelle knew her plan had succeeded.

"So you're Fairhaven's princess, Evelyn Carter?" she thought smugly. "So what if you own a jewelry empire? You've been checkmated. Game over."

"Like father, like daughter. Vivian's just as ruthless as Michael Prescott." Cassandra clapped softly. "I'm impressed she got those photos so quickly. Maybe she missed her calling as a spy."

"Cut contact with Vivian immediately. We can't risk any connection back to us." Isabelle rose gracefully. "I've eliminated Evelyn for you, Cassandra. Now it's your turn to secure Isabella's business."

"Relax." Cassandra smirked. "With Isabella furious over the breach, she'll have no choice but to choose Blackwood Hotel now that Monarch Grand is out. There are only two luxury venues in this city worthy of her status."

Her spine straightened with triumph. "And we're the last one standing."
###Chapter 385

The moment Evelyn heard from Edmund Windsor that Isabella Laurent had left the event prematurely, she dashed toward the underground parking garage with Theodore in tow.

Isabella sat rigidly in the luxury van, her expression stormy.

Just as the automatic door began to slide closed, a manicured hand shot out, gripping the edge with surprising strength.

"I understand your anger about the Twitter post, Isabella. I'm equally furious about the photo leak. Monarch Group had no prior knowledge of this breach."

Evelyn's chest heaved from exertion, beads of perspiration dotting her forehead.

Isabella offered a practiced smile - the kind perfected over three decades in the entertainment industry. Her face revealed nothing of the tempest beneath.

"No need for dramatics, Ms. Carter," she said coolly. "We had an agreement. I believe you're a woman of integrity - why else would Edmund speak so highly of you?"

Theodore's shoulders relaxed slightly. Perhaps there was still hope.

Their relief proved premature.

"However," Isabella continued, voice sharpening, "you can't deny Monarch Grand Hotels has serious security flaws. As general manager, that falls under your purview. Today it's wedding designs - tomorrow it could be clients' private data. Wouldn't you agree, Ms. Carter?"

Theodore's jaw clenched. He could endure personal attacks, but watching Evelyn take the blame was unbearable.

Evelyn raised a silencing hand. Drawing herself up, she met Isabella's gaze squarely. "You're absolutely right, Ms. Laurent. The photo leak was our failure. As general manager, I accept full responsibility."

"Ms. Evelyn—" Theodore's knuckles whitened.

"Credit where it's due - most executives wouldn't admit fault so readily," Isabella conceded. "But facts remain: the contract was violated. Therefore, I must terminate our collaboration per the agreement's terms. Contracts exist for a reason, don't they?"

With a meaningful glance at her assistant, Isabella signaled for the door to close.

"Wait, please!"

Evelyn retrieved an ornate box from Theodore and extended it toward Isabella with both hands. "I respect your decision to withdraw. Though we can't work together, I hope we'll remain friends. I prepared your favorite dessert - a small token of my esteem."

Isabella eyed the offering without touching it. "That's kind of you. Perhaps I'll accept it when next we collaborate."

The engine purred to life as the van pulled away.

"That was deliberate humiliation!" Theodore exploded.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "No, she was being professional. With no deal between us, accepting gifts would be inappropriate. And given her impending wedding date, she's undoubtedly scrambling to find a new venue now."

She squared her shoulders. "This isn't over. First priority - uncover who sabotaged us. There's clearly a mole in our organization."

"A mole?" Theodore's eyebrows shot up. "You think it's an inside job? I assumed Cassandra Blackwood was behind this."

"Oh, she orchestrated it," Evelyn said darkly. "But without internal help, she couldn't have obtained those photos. We start our investigation within Monarch Group."
###Chapter 386

Evelyn's almond-shaped eyes fluttered open, the world around her dissolving into a blur. How amusing, she thought. They believe withholding my power will make them invincible.

Theodore's shoulders slumped as he delivered the devastating news - their prized client Isabella Laurent had terminated their contract. But the real crisis lay in uncovering the mole within Monarch Grand Hotels before further damage could be done.

Nathan watched Evelyn's troubled expression with growing discomfort. Without a word, she pushed the delicate pastry box across the table and strode away, her designer heels clicking decisively against marble floors.

"Just dispose of it," Evelyn tossed over her shoulder, gesturing for Theodore to follow.

As they exited, a commanding figure entered the lobby.

Oliver observed Evelyn's retreating form with conflicted emotions. "Mr. Blackwood," he murmured, "It appears Ms. Carter will be occupied for the foreseeable future. Scheduling a meeting seems unlikely."

Nathan remained silent. Moving toward the trash bin, he retrieved the discarded box with surprising care, brushing imaginary dust from its lid.

"Sir!" Oliver protested, his usually relaxed features twisting in distaste. The thought of the formidable Nathan Blackwood rummaging through garbage was inconceivable.

Nathan's lips quirked. "I've done worse as a boy." The memory of Evelyn laboring over these pastries in her kitchen flooded him with unexpected warmth. "Let's go."

Back at Monarch Grand, Evelyn convened an emergency meeting with senior staff and wedding planners. The conference room buzzed with tension as she announced Isabella's withdrawal.

Gasps and angry murmurs erupted. One junior planner burst into tears, her months of meticulous work rendered meaningless.

Evelyn's heart ached witnessing their devastation. The financial loss meant nothing compared to her team's crushed spirits.

"This changes nothing," she declared, her melodic voice cutting through the gloom. "We proceed as planned. And the vacation bonuses I promised? Still happening." Her crescent-moon eyes sparkled with determination. "No tears, my darlings. This isn't your failure."

To her surprise, the staff unanimously voted to postpone their vacations, vowing to work harder to recoup losses.

When the room emptied, Theodore secured the door. "Ms. Carter," he whispered urgently, "Why not confront them about the mole? I could've analyzed their reactions!"

Evelyn spun her chair lazily, long legs draped over its armrest. "Oh Theodore," she sighed, "If the traitor expected this meeting, don't you think they'd have prepared impeccable poker faces?"

Her chair halted abruptly. "No, we'll let them grow complacent. Then," her eyes darkened dangerously, "we'll set the perfect trap."

"I'll review all surveillance footage near the wedding venue," Theodore offered. "And trace the leaked photos to their source."

Evelyn's crimson nails drummed against the conference table. "Excellent. Make it happen."
###Chapter 387

The following morning at Blackwood Industries, Oliver Sinclair hurriedly knocked on Nathan Blackwood's office door before barging in.

"Mr. Blackwood, I've uncovered—Ahhh!"

His warning came too late.

Nathan had already taken a bite of the pastry from the suspiciously tainted box.

Crunch.

Nathan chewed slowly, savoring the taste, his eyes narrowing slightly in satisfaction.

"Sir! You can't eat that! It was literally in the trash!" Oliver's voice cracked with panic.

"The box is dirty, not the contents." Nathan took another deliberate bite.

The flavor was exquisite.

A bitter pang twisted in his chest.

Once, Evelyn Carter had prepared these for him daily.

He had taken it for granted.

Now, the only way he could taste her creations was by scavenging them from discarded packaging.

Pathetic.

"Your report?" Nathan set aside the remaining pastry, his tone deceptively calm.

Oliver cleared his throat. "After some... persuasion, the influencer finally confessed—he was just a pawn! Someone anonymously sent him Isabella Wang's wedding details to leak."

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "And?"

"He has no idea who hired him."

Nathan exhaled through his nose. "Oliver, are you taking night classes?"

"Pardon?"

"How to Waste My Time 101?" Nathan's knuckles cracked ominously. "This is your critical lead? No name, no mastermind—just a dead end?"

Oliver paled. "Wait! I traced the payment account! I just didn’t verify it yet because I rushed back to—"

"Give me the details." Nathan extended his hand. "Before Evelyn's brothers solve this first."

Oliver blinked. "You're... personally handling this?"

A rare flicker of urgency crossed Nathan's face.

Oliver nearly teared up. "Sir, seeing you back in action is—"

"One more word," Nathan warned, "and your bonus funds a charity of my choice."

Oliver snapped his mouth shut.

Years ago at the military academy, Nathan had mastered cyber tracking and decryption.

But after inheriting Blackwood Industries, those skills gathered dust.

The last time he'd hacked—when Evelyn was still "Anna Brown"—he'd hit digital walls.

Her mysterious male acquaintances? Untraceable.

A warning: those men weren’t ordinary.

This time, though, the culprit wouldn’t be so elusive.

Oliver smirked. "Sir, be honest—do you still have feelings for Evelyn?"

Nathan’s stare could freeze lava. "Do you have a death wish, or are you just generous with your salary?"
###Chapter 388

I owe her for these three years.

Nathan Blackwood exhaled sharply, his dark lashes casting shadows over his downcast eyes. I'll spend the rest of my life making amends.

Every single day.

That evening, Sebastian and Dominic Kingsley abandoned their pressing schedules and raced to Cliffside Manor upon hearing about the collapsed partnership with Isabella Laurent.

In the study, Dominic's fingers flew across the keyboard, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he traced the digital footprints of the anonymous accounts Evelyn had provided.

Meanwhile, Evelyn lounged elegantly on the velvet sofa, clinking crystal glasses with Sebastian while savoring the rare Bordeaux he'd brought from his private collection.

"Honestly, aren't you two being utterly shameless?"

Dominic hadn't even paused to drink water in hours. His jaw tightened. "I'm breaking my back here while you two enjoy vintage wine. Since when did bullying a federal prosecutor become acceptable family entertainment?"

When neither sibling showed remorse, Dominic whined pitifully, "At least save me a glass!"

"Work faster and I'll gift you the entire wine cellar," Evelyn teased, swirling her drink. "Three hundred bottles of temptation. Consider it... professional encouragement."

"Pfft! I'm a law-abiding civil servant!" Dominic smacked the keyboard dramatically. "Your corruption attempts are pathetic."

"Evelyn, Father knows about the situation," Sebastian mentioned casually, watching her reaction.

"Of course Harrison would hear immediately." Evelyn set down her glass, tucking her legs beneath her. "Sitting in his ivory tower, waiting for me to fail, no doubt."

"Actually, he laughed."

Sebastian's lips curved as he pinched her sulking cheek. "His exact words: 'Why would my lioness care about such trivial prey? Has the world run out of worthy adversaries?'"

Evelyn blinked.

"Oh, and Father mentioned Isabella's starring role in Eternal Requiem's eighth season." Sebastian leaned closer, eyes glinting. "The producers begged him to invest. He said if you're truly upset, he could have her replaced tomorrow."

Evelyn gasped. Since when did her father have Hollywood connections? The old fox's influence knew no bounds!

"Ahem. Unnecessary." Evelyn shook her head. "We breached contract first. Isabella did nothing wrong - let's not destroy careers over bruised egos."

She sighed, twirling a loose curl. "Besides, I chose independence. Solving problems with family power defeats the purpose. The only proper satisfaction comes from uncovering the conspirators and... handling them personally."

"Spoken like a true Kingsley." Sebastian's proud gaze warmed. "An eye for an eye, darling."

Evelyn could burn the world if she wished. Her brothers would happily provide the matches.

Just then, her phone vibrated on the marble coffee table.

Evelyn glanced sideways. Her delicate fingers stilled.

Nathan Blackwood's name glared from the screen like an accusation.

"Your ex-husband calls," Sebastian sing-songed, swirling his wine.

"Ugh. Blocked numbers should stay blocked." Evelyn flipped the phone face-down.

Suddenly, Theodore burst in, expression tense.

"Ms. Evelyn, Nathan Blackwood is at the gates!"

As if on cue, the doorbell chimed.
###Chapter 389

Sebastian swirled his wine glass with an amused smirk. "Looks like our nuisance caller decided to show up in person."

With both Sebastian and Dominic present, Nathan Blackwood wouldn't dare cause trouble.

One wrong move from him, and Sebastian would make sure not even divine intervention could save him.

"That bastard actually came to our doorstep?" Dominic snarled, fingers flying across his keyboard. "That fucking piece of trash!"

Evelyn sighed and rose abruptly. "This is my mess to clean up. I'll handle it."

She marched to the entrance alone and activated the video intercom. Nathan's chiseled features appeared on screen, his expression unreadable.

"What do you want?"

Her voice was glacial, as if addressing a complete stranger. "Did Crestview run out of tourist attractions that you had to loiter outside my home?"

"Evelyn." His baritone voice carried an unfamiliar urgency. "Come out. We need to talk."

"Why can't we talk like this? I can see and hear you perfectly fine."

Nathan exhaled sharply, his Adam's apple bobbing. The woman before him had truly become ice personified.

"Stop being difficult. I have something important to tell you."

"Difficult?" A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "You're the one trespassing on private property."

"Just come outside. I need to see you."

Moonlight caught in his haunted eyes, revealing emotions he could no longer suppress. All pretense of pride had crumbled.

"I need to see you."

Evelyn's pulse spiked violently. She took an involuntary step back, gripping the doorframe.

After a steadying breath, she forced out a hollow chuckle.

Had he uttered those words years ago, she would've wept with joy. She'd have moved mountains for that simple admission.

But now? It was pathetic. Clinging to expired vows only diminished her self-worth.

"Nathan, the world doesn't revolve around your whims." Her voice dripped with disdain. "You spent three years teaching me that lesson."

"Nathan—" His voice cracked, every muscle taut with tension.

"Doesn't look like rain tonight." Evelyn tilted her face toward the moon. "Last time I went out, I feared lightning might strike you dead. This time? You're not worth the risk."

The screen went black.

Nathan stood frozen in the autumn chill, the cold seeping into his bones.

Evelyn trudged upstairs, her steps leaden.

How dare he? After years of neglect, after the divorce, he had the audacity to demand her attention? What more was there to say? Three years of silence couldn't be undone with one midnight visit.

She'd wasted enough time on that man. Never again.

Theodore looked up anxiously as she reentered the study. "Are you alright, Ms. Evelyn? Did he—"

"Please." She scoffed, moving behind Sebastian to wrap her arms around his shoulders. "He wouldn't dare."

Sebastian patted her hand. "Tell me you at least made him suffer."

"Not my style."

"Pity." His lips quirked. "With me here tonight, you could've exacted proper revenge."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Such violence, Bash. I prefer resolving conflicts peacefully."

"Evie!" Dominic suddenly whooped, punching the air. "Got her! Break out the good wine—the '98 Lafite!"

"Theo," Evelyn called, her mood lifting instantly. "Fetch my idiot brother that bottle from the cellar."

She hurried to Dominic's side, leaning over his shoulder. "Who's behind the account?"

Dominic jabbed the screen triumphantly. "Vivian Prescott from Spotlight News! The IP matches her official work address exactly..."
###Chapter 390

"Good job, Dominic! Though you could've been quicker." Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted brow with an amused smirk.

"I was faster this time! Why didn't you ask Maxwell for help? He specializes in these... unconventional operations. You should always delegate to the experts!"

"I contacted Maxwell days ago. He's on a critical mission—I wouldn't dare interrupt."

Evelyn stretched lazily. "Sebastian, darling, you know I'm just as skilled as Maxwell in hacking. You could've uncovered this yesterday."

Sebastian frowned. "Then why didn't you?"

A theatrical yawn. "Oh, I was simply... bored."

Dominic's jaw tightened. So I'm just her errand boy after all.

Evelyn scrolled through the Twitter account, her crimson nails tapping the screen. "Interesting. Vivian Prescott—an investigative journalist with a 'noble pursuit of truth.' Why suddenly shift focus to expose Isabella Wang's wedding details?" Her laugh was ice. "Someone's pulling her strings."

"You think she was bribed?" Sebastian's voice darkened.

"Not just bribed. Hired. Entertainment gossip isn't her beat—this is a targeted attack."

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Vivian's profile photo. "Vivian Prescott... Vivian Prescott..." Suddenly, she gasped. "Vincent Prescott's daughter!"

"Who?" Dominic blinked.

"The disgraced VP of Monarch Grand Hotels? The one you fired and prosecuted?" Sebastian's lips curled.

"Exactly. This is her revenge." Evelyn's memory was flawless—she never forgot a dossier.

Dominic nodded gravely. "Considering you ruined her father's life, she's being remarkably restrained by only attacking your client."

Evelyn's chin lifted. "He embezzled millions. Should I have given him a promotion instead?" Her eyes flashed. "If she were truly filial, she'd visit him in prison rather than harass me. Pathetic."

Theodore entered, his expression stormy. "Ms. Carter, surveillance confirms no outsiders accessed the venue. The leak came from within."

Evelyn studied Vivian's photo—petite, doe-eyed. A predator's smile formed. "Theodore, monitor every male staffer. Especially those who've interacted with her. Report any contact immediately."

"Why just the men?" Dominic protested.

"Because testosterone and treachery go hand in hand," she purred, her divorce having etched cynicism into her bones.

"Not all of us!" the Kingsley brothers chorused.

Theodore raised his hands. "I'm certainly loyal!"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, I know you're the exceptions." Her stretch was feline. "Still, you're all saints compared to him."

Exhaustion weighed on her. After Dominic's investigation, the brothers retired to guest suites while Evelyn collapsed into her silk sheets.

Then—lightning.

A deafening crack split the night, wrenching her awake.

She never stirred easily, yet tonight, her pulse raced like a hunted thing.

Slipping into a burgundy robe, she padded to the kitchen. Rain lashed the windows as thunder growled.

The water glass trembled in her hand.

Mother used to hold me during storms...

Her mother's whisper haunted her: "It was a night like this when I left that place."

What place?

Another flash—

And there he stood.

Nathan Blackwood, drenched and unmoving, his gaze locked on her window. The storm raged around him, but he remained—a statue carved from regret.
###Chapter 391

Evelyn's mind raced. What the hell is that bastard doing out there? Is this some pathetic attempt to manipulate me with his self-inflicted suffering? Does he really think I'd fall for such a cheap trick?

Her chest burned with fury. She spun on her heel, ready to retreat to the sanctuary of her bedroom—but froze after two steps.

Autumn rain in Crestview wasn't like summer showers. Nighttime temperatures could plunge below freezing this time of year.

Nathan had been standing motionless for nearly four hours in nothing but a thin suit.

A chilling thought struck her. What if he refuses to leave? If he freezes to death on my doorstep, I'll have to explain this to the authorities. What a goddamn mess.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn stormed back inside and snatched her phone off the nightstand. Her fingers flew across the screen as she dialed Nathan's number.

The call went straight to voicemail.

She couldn't fathom what game he was playing.

His masochistic display didn't evoke pity—only morbid curiosity.

With a frustrated growl, she grabbed a massive umbrella and marched toward the entrance. The door swung open with more force than necessary.

When Nathan saw Evelyn's slender silhouette approaching through the downpour, he wondered if hypothermia was making him hallucinate.

Only when she stood before him—close enough for raindrops to catch in her lashes—did reality sink in. Warmth flooded his chest, his frozen lips twitching into an involuntary smile.

"What the hell are you trying to prove?" Evelyn's voice cut through the storm like shattered crystal. "Trying to get yourself hospitalized?"

Nathan's hands trembled as they moved toward his suit buttons. Instinct made him want to offer his jacket—until he remembered the fabric was soaked through. His arms dropped uselessly to his sides.

"Why is your phone off?" she demanded.

"Dead battery," he admitted, sounding like a chastened schoolboy.

Strangely, her anger thrilled him. There was something perversely satisfying about her fury.

"Were you planning to stand here all night if I didn't come out?"

"Yes." His breath formed ghostly clouds between them. "I needed to tell you something."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp enough to draw blood. "Nathan Blackwood, you never fail to disgust me. Can't you come up with anything more original than emotional blackmail? Are you the CEO of Blackwood Industries or some desperate stalker?"

"Methods don't matter," his voice dropped to that dangerous velvet register, "as long as I see you."

Evelyn's breathing turned ragged, her chest rising in furious waves. The sight made Nathan's gaze darken with something far warmer than hypothermia.

To his credit, he maintained control—though few men could've resisted that view.

"You're not sleeping well."

"What?"

"You never used to wake at night. Slept like the dead till morning."

Evelyn's grip on the umbrella handle turned white-knuckled.

During their brief marriage, they'd shared a bed for six excruciating months.

Even then, Nathan had slept with his back to her, the space between them wider than the Grand Canyon.

She knew he was a light sleeper. She hadn't realized he'd been listening to her breathing.

"Whatever you came to say, spit it out! It's freezing out here!"

A violent shiver racked her body.

"Let's talk in the car."

Nathan seized the umbrella with one hand while yanking the car door open with the other. Before she could protest, he'd maneuvered her inside.

The interior smelled of damp wool and expensive cologne.

In the dim dashboard light, Evelyn noticed how Nathan's aristocratic lips had turned blue at the edges. His elegant fingers—now gripping his knees—were mottled with cold.

Her mouth tightened as he produced a cashmere blanket from somewhere and wrapped it around her shoulders.

"I found who leaked the photos. Vivian Prescott. Her father is Vincent Prescott—you know why she did this. She's been waiting years for revenge."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "You stood in the rain for hours just to tell me that?"

"Partly." Nathan's voice was hoarse with more than cold. "I needed to see if you were... affected by what happened."
###Chapter 392

Hahaha!

Evelyn no longer had to maintain her facade of docility around Nathan. The shackles were finally off.

She threw her head back with unrestrained laughter. "Do you really think something this insignificant could break me? Evelyn Carter doesn't crumble that easily. You're severely underestimating me, Nathan."

A flicker of relief passed through Nathan's stormy gray eyes. "Good."

"Now tell me," Evelyn crossed her arms, "what's your real motive for coming here tonight?"

Nathan had become increasingly unpredictable lately. Though the thought was absurd, part of her wondered if he'd developed feelings.

For three years, she'd laid her heart bare. Countless opportunities for him to reciprocate. Why now?

If true, the irony would be laughable.

"Evelyn, I owe you." His voice roughened with emotion. "Our marriage may have been in name only, but I treated you poorly. I want to make amends when possible."

"Make amends?" Her laughter turned icy. "Fine. Here's how - promise you'll vanish from my life permanently. No more interference. That's the only reparation I'll accept."

Nathan's chest constricted as if pierced. The pain stole his breath.

Evelyn shrugged off his jacket, tossing it back. "Spare me the noble excuses. If you'd said this was about sabotaging Cassandra, I might've listened."

Watching her retreat into the villa, Nathan felt hollow. The downpour mirrored his turmoil.

Some pathetic part of him had hoped she still cared.

Now he understood - this was how she'd felt those three agonizing years. The helplessness. The unrequited longing.

Back inside, Evelyn pressed against the door, steadying her ragged breaths. The roar of Nathan's Ferrari confirmed his departure.

She moved to the window when warm hands settled on her shoulders.

Startled, she relaxed upon recognizing her brother's touch. "Sebastian! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Since when do you creep around like a ghost?"

"I wasn't sneaking. You were just... preoccupied."

He embraced her from behind, resting his chin on her head as they gazed at the storm. "He's gone?"

"Sorry for waking you."

Evelyn leaned into his solid frame, lashes fluttering shut. "Nathan came to tell me Vivian Prescott leaked those photos."

"Just that?"

"Mm."

Comfortable silence settled between them.

Eventually, Sebastian turned her to face him. "Hypothetically... if Nathan fell in love with you now? If he was willing to devote himself completely to you?"

"Sebastian!" She scowled.

"I'm serious. After everything, if he genuinely changed - would you reconsider? He was your first love, after all."

"Never." Her voice fractured. "It's beyond forgiveness now. I'm... terrified, Sebastian. Love has broken me too many times. I won't lose sleep over a man's moods again. Won't cook elaborate meals only to be ignored. I'm exhausted. Never again."

"Good." Sebastian squeezed her trembling hands. "Nathan forfeited any right to you. My sister deserves infinitely better. Let that regret haunt him forever."

The storm outside mirrored the tempest in Evelyn's chest - turbulent, unrelenting, but ultimately... cleansing.
###Chapter 393

Cassandra Blackwood spent three hours getting ready.

Every strand of hair was perfectly curled. Her designer dress hugged her figure flawlessly. She wanted to make an unforgettable impression on Isabella Laurent.

The moment she stepped into the presidential suite of the Blackwood Hotel, Cassandra lifted her chin confidently.

Isabella barely glanced up from her tea.

The international superstar's expression was icy. Her manicured fingers tapped impatiently against the porcelain cup.

Cassandra's smile faltered.

"Ms. Laurent," she began sweetly, "I was devastated to hear about your troubles with Monarch Grand Hotels. Their breach of contract was utterly unprofessional."

Isabella's lips curled.

Cassandra continued, oblivious. "Such behavior deserves industry-wide condemnation. Had you chosen our hotel initially—"

"Are you suggesting I lack judgment?" Isabella interrupted.

Cassandra's face paled.

Isabella set down her cup with a sharp clink. "Canceling with Monarch doesn't make Blackwood my only option. Evelyn Carter is an exceptional manager. There may be... mitigating circumstances."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms.

Why was this woman defending Evelyn?

"Your wedding is imminent," Cassandra pressed, forcing composure. "We can prepare everything within your timeline. Our resources far surpass—"

"I'll consider Blackwood," Isabella said coolly. "On one condition."

Cassandra leaned forward eagerly.

"Nathan Blackwood personally oversees every detail." Isabella's eyes glinted. "I trust no one else."

The dismissal in her tone was unmistakable.

Cassandra stormed out, humiliation burning her cheeks.

That arrogant actress! How dare she demand Nathan's involvement?

Her phone trembled in her grip as she dialed Penelope.

"Mother! That washed-up star treated me like dirt!"

Penelope's voice turned venomous. "How dare she disrespect a Blackwood? Go to your father. Leonard will make that bastard son of his comply."

Within the hour, Cassandra was sobbing in Leonard's office.

"You're too sheltered, my dear." Leonard sighed, patting her shoulder. "The business world is ruthless. Consider this a lesson."

His words offered no comfort.

Cassandra's tears fell harder.

Why did everyone keep failing her? First Evelyn, now Isabella Laurent.

She'd make them regret it.

Especially that smug actress who dared to ask for Nathan.

The thought alone made her blood boil.
###Chapter 394

Leonard's voice was firm. "You must never let others decipher your thoughts through your eyes. That's extremely dangerous."

"I understand, Father."

Leonard pulled out his phone and initiated a video call to Nathan.

When Nathan answered, his face appeared on screen - cold, stern, and radiating displeasure.

Cassandra immediately clung tighter to Leonard's arm, making a show of their close relationship for Nathan's benefit.

Nathan completely ignored her display. "Why are you contacting me?" His voice was icy.

"Your sister has already negotiated terms with Isabella Wang. Now it's your turn to finalize the agreement." Leonard's tone brooked no argument. "Meet with Isabella immediately and sign the contract."

"We've already discussed this. There's no need for my involvement."

A sardonic smile played on Nathan's lips. "Congratulations in advance, Cassandra, for stealing such a major project from Ms. Carter. Since you're so brilliant and capable, you should handle this important signing yourself. I wouldn't dream of stealing your spotlight."

Cassandra's blood boiled with rage. Her eyes turned red from suppressing her fury.

Without Nathan's participation, Isabella Wang would never agree to work with the Blackwood Hotel.

"Nathan, Cassandra is your sister. She's worked hard to get this far. Can't you, as her elder brother, help her close this deal?" Leonard's voice deepened, his eyes flashing with anger.

"Whether this project succeeds or fails is Cassandra's responsibility. There's no such thing as sharing the hardship but keeping all the glory for oneself."

Leonard was livid. "Nathan!"

"If you're truly concerned about resolving this, perhaps you should meet Isabella Wang yourself. Surely the chairman of Blackwood Industries can handle a mere celebrity?"

The screen went black.

Nathan had ended the call without giving them a chance to respond.

Meanwhile, the Montgomery family faced their own troubles.

Eleanor Montgomery had been competing fiercely with Victor Whitmore's daughter, Giselle Whitmore, for the jewelry charity auction. Eleanor had nearly secured an agreement with Theodore Windsor's team, but yesterday she received shocking news - Theodore had chosen Giselle instead.

All her recent efforts had been wasted. The disappointment left her unable to eat.

Isabelle Montgomery watched this unfold with growing resentment.

She knew exactly why Theodore had changed his mind - he was taking revenge on Evelyn Carter's behalf.

Furious, Isabelle retreated to her room and called her frenemy, Cassandra.

"I'm in a terrible mood. Let's go drinking at my brother's club tonight."

"Ugh, same here."

Cassandra vented about Isabella Wang refusing to sign with her. "Even though we stopped Isabella from working with Evelyn, I didn't gain anything from it. How infuriating!"

"Hmph! Don't worry. Isabella Wang just can't admit she made the wrong choice. She'll come around soon enough."

Isabelle strolled into her walk-in closet, running her fingers through racks of designer gowns. In a lazy drawl, she asked, "So much has happened recently, and I've had to endure it all. Cassandra, can't you arrange something... entertaining to cheer me up?"

Cassandra froze for a heartbeat.

Then understanding dawned, and a wicked smile curved her lips. "Don't worry. I'll definitely make sure you enjoy yourself tonight!"
###Chapter 395

That night after escaping Julian's embrace, Eleanor lay wide awake until sunrise.

Her elbow throbbed where she'd scraped it during the escape. The angry red wound oozed faintly when she examined it under her bedroom light.

Tears pricked her eyes as she dabbed antiseptic on the raw flesh. She'd sneaked out without permission and couldn't risk anyone discovering her injury.

With trembling hands, she bandaged herself before curling around her stuffed bear. But sleep refused to come as memories assaulted her.

The cafeteria bathroom stall where Isabelle forced her to eat lunch alone.

The time Isabelle's friends shoved her headfirst into a reeking dumpster.

The dead rat she'd found nestled in her textbooks.

Her favorite novel's pages scattered like confetti across the school courtyard.

And worst of all - the music room piano. Just thinking about it made her whimper into her pillow.

Julian Montgomery. Isabelle's brother. Her tormentor's flesh and blood.

Tears soaked Eleanor's pillowcase as she muffled her sobs until morning light painted her walls.

Though autistic, Eleanor understood complex emotions better than most assumed.

She knew despite being Isabelle's brother, Julian had saved her life that rainy night.

That afternoon, Eleanor carefully followed an online tutorial to bake a blueberry cheesecake. Maybe Nathan could deliver it as thanks.

She hummed while refrigerating her creation, wiping flour-dusted hands on her apron. Turning toward her bedroom, she froze mid-step.

Cassandra lounged on her bed, legs crossed, examining her manicure with a predatory smile.

"Don't I deserve a greeting, little sister?" Cassandra flicked her golden hair. "Or has the dummy gone mute now too?"

"H-Hello, Cassandra." Eleanor's voice barely rose above a whisper.

Cassandra's smile widened. "I'm taking you clubbing tonight. My treat."

"N-No thank you. I'd just embarrass you." Eleanor stared at her slippers.

"Suit yourself." Cassandra stood slowly, eyes glinting. "I only wanted some sisterly bonding time."

Eleanor released a shaky breath as Cassandra sauntered out, hands clasped behind her back.

The moment the door clicked shut, Eleanor lunged for her bed. Frantic hands searched the blankets.

"Mr. Snuggles!" Her cherished bear from Evelyn was gone.

Cassandra never visited without leaving destruction in her wake.

Terror propelled Eleanor downstairs where Cassandra was sliding into a limousine.

"Give him back!" Eleanor screamed, pounding the car window.

Cassandra lowered the glass just enough to dangle the stuffed bear mockingly before tossing it onto the seat beside her.

"Drive," she commanded.

Eleanor chased the accelerating limo, tears blurring her vision. "Please! He's all I have!"

She collapsed on the driveway, sobbing like a mother watching her child being stolen. Even the stone-faced butler shifted uncomfortably.

"Get me a car!" Eleanor demanded with unprecedented force, tear-streaked face blazing with determination.

The butler hesitated. "But Ms. Eleanor, Mrs. Whitmore expressly forbids—"
###Chapter 396

Eleanor's voice trembled with indignation as she cried out, "I'm Leonard Blackwood's daughter too! Why can Cassandra go out while I'm trapped here? Get the car ready immediately!"

The head butler sighed in resignation, knowing better than to argue with the Blackwood heiress. Within minutes, a sleek black limousine pulled up to the mansion's grand entrance.

As twilight descended upon Crestview, the cityscape transformed into a glittering constellation of neon lights and illuminated skyscrapers.

Inside the exclusive Velvet Lounge's VIP suite, Isabelle Montgomery lounged decadently with her elite circle from Crestview's upper echelons. Gone were the polished manners of high society debutantes - these young socialites now resembled seasoned nightlife predators, their designer dresses barely containing their wild energy.

Isabelle had left for Valmont after middle school, leaving few connections in Crestview. Tonight's gathering consisted of her former junior high clique - the same group that had tormented Eleanor under her leadership.

"Whatever happened to that weirdo Eleanor?" one girl drawled between sips of champagne. "She practically vanished after graduation. So strange for a Blackwood to be that invisible."

"My mother says she's mentally unstable," another sneered, twirling a lock of hair. "Lady Blackwood keeps her locked away like some shameful secret."

"No wonder she was so slow in class!" a boy guffawed. "Turns out the little freak was actually-"

"Now, now," Isabelle interrupted, crossing her silk-clad legs with feline grace. A cigarette dangled from her crimson lips as she exhaled a perfect smoke ring. "The clinical term is autistic spectrum disorder."

"Same difference - still a retard!" The group erupted in cruel laughter.

Isabelle smirked at their vicious amusement, her catlike eyes gleaming with malicious satisfaction.

The private room's door swung open abruptly.

Cassandra Blackwood entered, escorted by a bowing attendant.

The room fell into stunned silence, all eyes widening at the unexpected arrival.

"Relax everyone," Isabelle purred, gesturing lazily. A young man immediately presented a crystal ashtray for her to tap ashes into. "Cassandra's one of us."

Cassandra's breath caught at the sight. She'd thought Rosalind was the master of deception in their circle, but Isabelle's transformation from prim society darling to this decadent seductress was staggering.

She couldn't help wondering what Julian would think seeing his supposedly refined sister in this state. Would he be horrified? Furious?

"Cassandra darling," Isabelle pouted, "where's our dear Eleanor? The evening won't be nearly as entertaining without her."

Cassandra sighed dramatically, waving Eleanor's beloved teddy bear teasingly. "Don't worry. With this, my dear sister will come running like an obedient puppy."

Isabelle's perfectly arched brows lifted in interest. "Oh? Playing games with the little freak now?"

"Just wait and see," Cassandra smirked.

True to Cassandra's prediction, Eleanor's limousine arrived at Velvet Lounge shortly after. The club's pulsating entrance, thronged with glittering partygoers and bouncers, triggered Eleanor's social anxiety instantly. Her breathing turned shallow, fingers trembling against the car door.

Retreating into the leather seats, she dialed Cassandra with shaking hands.

"Yes, dearest sister?" Cassandra's mocking voice cut through the club's cacophony.

"Give him back!" Eleanor's voice cracked, tears of frustration welling. "Give me Mr. Bubbles right now!"

"You mean this disgusting, matted old thing?" Cassandra taunted. "I've hidden him somewhere special."

"Where?!" Eleanor nearly screamed, her chest constricting painfully.

"Somewhere in Velvet Lounge, of course!" Cassandra's laugh was pure venom. "But telling you exactly where would ruin our little game, wouldn't it? Poor Mr. Bubbles, all alone in some dark corner... unless you come find him!"

Eleanor's vision blurred with angry tears. The malicious laughter sent chills down her spine, her entire body trembling with barely contained rage.

Never - not even during Cassandra's cruelest childhood torments - had she felt such overwhelming hatred. The stuffed bear was her last connection to her late mother, her only comfort during panic attacks.

Gritting her teeth, Eleanor wiped her tears violently. With a determined breath, she flung the car door open and marched toward the club's neon-lit entrance, her small frame trembling but resolute.
###Chapter 397

The bass from Velvet Lounge's speakers thrummed through the walls, but inside the opulent private suite, the silence was so thick you could hear a pin drop.

Julian Montgomery lounged in a tailored black suit, the top buttons of his silk shirt undone just enough to reveal the glint of a silver chain against his toned chest. A crystal glass of Bordeaux dangled from his fingers as he crossed his legs, the picture of effortless dominance.

A crimson droplet trailed from the corner of his lips. He caught it with his thumb, smearing it like war paint. His smirk was careless, but his eyes—sharp as shattered glass—warned everyone to keep their distance.

His security detail stood rigid along the walls, statues in designer suits.

Julian drained his wine in one smooth motion before snapping his fingers.

The guards parted like curtains.

A bound man collapsed at Julian’s feet, face swollen beyond recognition, blood and spit dribbling from his split lips.

"Mr. Montgomery—please—mercy—" The words slurred through broken teeth.

Julian tilted his head, feigning sympathy. "Tsk. You’re ruining the rug." He flicked his wrist dismissively. "Do you have any idea what this Persian costs? Not even your black-market kidneys could cover it."

The man scrambled forward, groveling. Julian lifted a polished shoe and shoved him back with a bored sigh.

"Mr. Montgomery, I—I was loyal! Damian Whitmore forced me! He threatened my family! All I did was report your schedule—"

Damian Whitmore. Julian’s uncle. His father’s beloved younger brother.

At seven, Julian had watched his father’s casket lower into the ground. The "accident" had left his mother a widow, his sister Isabelle too young to understand the viper’s nest they’d inherited.

But Julian knew.

His grandfather, Archibald Montgomery, still held the family reins, but Damian had slithered into the CEO seat meant for Julian’s father. The same uncle who’d wept the hardest at the funeral—only to poison every boardroom against Julian since.

His mother and Isabelle remained oblivious. Even his closest friend, Nathan Blackwood, had no idea of the knives Julian dodged daily.

"Pathetic." Julian’s chuckle was ice. "You think playing both sides makes you clever? Money’s useless if you’re not breathing to spend it."

The wine glass shattered against the floor.

The man flinched as if it were his bones breaking.

"I don’t mind rats," Julian mused, leaning forward. Shadows carved his features into something monstrous. "Every king has them. But you? You got greedy. Slip up again, and I’ll mail your tongue to Damian myself."

The man’s bladder gave out.

Julian’s smile vanished. "Natalia."

His secretary emerged from the shadows, a blade glinting in her manicured hand.

The man’s screams were cut short.

Julian stood, straightening his cuffs. "Gift-wrap it. Let’s see if Uncle Damian has the stomach for his favorite pâté."

———

Across the club, Isabelle Montgomery smirked as surveillance feeds flooded the room’s massive screen.

Eleanor Blackwood darted through the crowd below—a frightened doe in a den of wolves.

Isabelle sipped her champagne. "Now this is entertainment."
###Chapter 398

Eleanor stumbled through the Velvet Lounge like a lost kitten in a thunderstorm. Drunken patrons kept grabbing at her arms, pulling her in different directions.

A particularly aggressive man with whiskey breath cornered her near the bar. She ducked under his arm just in time, but he started shouting obscenities that made her ears burn.

Up in the private suite, Isabelle and her friends were howling with laughter as they watched the security feed. The champagne glasses in their hands shook from their mirth.

"Look at that pathetic creature!" Isabelle pointed at the screen, tears of laughter streaming down her perfectly contoured cheeks. "I swear she hasn't developed past fourteen mentally. What an absolute joke!"

Cassandra leaned in with a wicked grin. "Want to know where I hid that disgusting stuffed animal?"

She whispered into Isabelle's ear, making the other girl shriek with renewed laughter.

"That's brilliant! There's no way that simpleton will ever find it before dawn. This is better than any comedy show!"

Meanwhile, Eleanor had searched every booth and table in the massive club. Her bare legs were covered in bruises from being accidentally kicked, and her arms ached from pushing through the crowd.

She stood frozen in the middle of the dance floor, arms wrapped around herself like a protective shield. Strangers kept giving her strange looks that made her skin crawl. The noise and lights were making her head spin, her breathing coming in short, panicked gasps.

Suddenly, the overhead lights shifted to deep purple. Glittering confetti rained down from the ceiling like metallic snow.

The crowd erupted in cheers, bodies grinding together to the pulsing beat.

"My bear... I need to find Bruno..." Eleanor whimpered to herself, bending down to check under another table.

She didn't see the solid wall of muscle until she collided with it face-first. The impact made stars explode behind her eyes. Tears immediately welled up from the sharp pain in her nose.

"I-I'm so sorry..." she stammered, trying to dart around the obstacle.

But the living wall moved to block her path again. A familiar scent of sandalwood and expensive whiskey washed over her.

"Eleanor?!"

Her heart stuttered. Slowly, trembling fingers still covering her nose, she looked up through wet lashes.

Julian Montgomery's handsome face swam into view, his dark eyes slightly unfocused from alcohol but filled with instant recognition.

For a moment, Eleanor wondered if the collision had given her hallucinations. "J-Julian? Is that really you?"

The next second, Julian's arms enveloped her in a crushing embrace. One strong hand cradled the back of her head while the other secured her waist, shielding her from the jostling crowd.

The dance floor had become dangerously chaotic, filled with intoxicated people moving without awareness.

Eleanor's pulse raced as her small hands fisted in Julian's silk shirt. Part of her wanted to push away - he was Isabelle's brother after all. But another part, the scared and exhausted part, wanted to melt into his warmth just for a moment.

Around them, clubgoers gasped as they recognized the Prince of Crestview. Women screamed while men shook their heads in envy at his flawless features.

Those famous bedroom eyes - often described as the most seductive in all of Crestview - were now solely focused on the trembling girl in his arms.

The music, the lights, the revelry - it all faded to background noise as they stood in their own private bubble.

"Did you come here alone?" Julian murmured, his lips brushing the shell of her ear.

Eleanor gave a hesitant nod, then shook her head.

His expression darkened. "Tell me what's wrong." Despite the intensity in his eyes, his voice remained gentle.

"I lost Bruno..." The words tumbled out before she could stop them, along with a fresh wave of tears. "Cassandra took him... He was a gift from Evelyn... My only friend..."
###Chapter 399

Julian's heart ached when he heard Eleanor's quiet sobs.

His throat tightened with an unexpected surge of emotion.

The tears glistening on Eleanor's cheeks sent waves of tenderness through him.

For a moment, Julian forgot how she had fled from him the last time they met.

"Evelyn?" His voice was soft as he brushed away her tears with his rough fingertips. "Evelyn gave you the bear?"

Eleanor nodded quickly, her nose tinged pink.

"Where did you lose it? Here?"

Another small nod, her eyes still shimmering with unshed tears.

"Don't worry, I'll help you find it."

Julian took her delicate hand and led her toward the stage, drawing every eye in the club.

A warm, golden spotlight followed them, casting an intimate glow.

Eleanor kept her gaze lowered, but she couldn't resist stealing glances at him.

Despite his stern expression, he was breathtakingly handsome.

His sharp jawline and piercing eyes were unlike anyone else's.

She bit her lip, memorizing every detail of his face.

"Stop the music."

Julian's command cut through the noise, silencing the room instantly.

Isabelle and Cassandra were too absorbed in their revelry to notice—until someone nudged them.

Isabelle shot up from the couch, her face twisting in fury.

The sudden outburst startled everyone around her.

When Cassandra saw Julian holding Eleanor's hand, her chest tightened with rage.

Was he publicly declaring his affection for that girl?

Her mind screamed. Eleanor! If you think you can take what's mine, you'll regret it!

"What is this?!" Isabelle hissed, summoning her bodyguard. "I told you to watch her! How did she end up with my brother?!"

"Ms. Isabelle, I—I didn't expect Mr. Julian to be here tonight. She was running around, and—"

"Useless!"

Isabelle lashed out, but her kick missed, sending her stumbling to the floor.

Cassandra and her friends stifled laughter.

On stage, Julian's lips curved into a faint smile.

"Let's play a game," he announced. "My sister lost her teddy bear here tonight."

The screen behind him displayed a photo of the stuffed animal.

Murmurs spread through the crowd.

"Sister? I thought Mr. Montgomery only had one sister—the pianist prodigy."

"More like a secret lover. Since when does he call random girls 'sister'?"

"She looks like a child! Is she even legal?"

"Rich men love them young and innocent."

Eleanor's cheeks burned. She tried to pull away, but Julian's grip was unyielding.

"Whoever finds this bear tonight," he continued, "gets their expenses at Velvet covered for a year."

The crowd erupted in excitement.

A countdown appeared on the screen.

"Five, four, three, two, one—begin!"

Julian watched with satisfaction as the guests scattered in search of the toy.

Eleanor stared in awe, her lips slightly parted.

Julian's gaze darkened as he studied her expression.

"Come," he murmured. "We'll wait in my private room. They'll find it soon."
###Chapter 400

Julian led Eleanor into another secluded VIP room.

Inside, several escorts were drinking with three wealthy young men—Julian's closest friends from Crestview.

When Eleanor saw strangers embracing each other, her cheeks burned crimson. She ducked her head so low she might as well have been an ostrich burying itself in the sand. Julian tugged her inside.

The moment they entered, his friends erupted into wolf whistles and cheers.

"Ooh! Mrs. Montgomery, you must be something special to have tamed our brother!"

Eleanor froze. Her face flamed even hotter.

"Shut up!" Julian snapped. "This is—"

He had been about to introduce her as Leonard Blackwood’s youngest daughter, but Nathan’s warning flashed in his mind. He quickly corrected himself. "This is my sister. Keep your filthy thoughts to yourselves!"

"Julian, that teddy bear hunt of hers must’ve cost a fortune," one friend teased. "A year of free drinks at VELVET? That’s easily hundreds of thousands—maybe even millions if she parties every night. You could’ve bought her a warehouse of teddy bears with that kind of money."

None of Julian’s friends believed this was purely platonic.

Women flocked to Julian, but he never spoiled any of them like this. Clearly, he had feelings for Eleanor.

"That bear was a gift from my first love. It means everything to us. What do you know?" Julian rolled his eyes, exasperated.

"First love?" Eleanor gasped. "You mean my sister-in-law?"

"Yes. I was in love with Evelyn once. She was my first love." Julian admitted it without hesitation, a faint smile on his lips.

Even though Evelyn had rejected him harshly, he still considered it an honor to have loved such an extraordinary woman.

Eleanor shrieked in horror. "No, no, no! You can’t like her! She belongs to my second brother! You can’t steal her!"

She clenched her fists, her expression fiercely protective. "Aren’t you friends with him? How could you betray him like this? If you take her away, I’ll never speak to you again!"

The room fell silent—then burst into laughter.

Eleanor’s face burned. She curled her toes and twisted the hem of her shirt, mortified.

Julian didn’t know whether to laugh or sigh. Seeing her embarrassment, he shot his friends a warning glare.

Instantly, the room went quiet.

"Eleanor," Julian murmured, bending slightly to ruffle her hair. "I didn’t expect you to be so fiercely loyal."

Her hair was impossibly soft beneath his fingers. He smirked. "If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were jealous."

"Jealous? I don’t taste sour," she said seriously.

Julian was speechless.

The gap between their worlds had never been clearer.

And yet, she had completely captivated him.

While the staff at VELVET scoured the club for the missing teddy bear, Julian and his friends drank inside. Eleanor stood alone on the terrace, gripping the railing, silently praying for her bear’s safe return.

"Found it!"

A woman’s triumphant shout echoed through the club as she leaped onto the stage, brandishing the teddy bear high.

"Where the hell was it?" someone yelled.

"Inside the toilet tank—in the men’s bathroom!"

The men in the room instinctively covered their crotches, impressed by her dedication.

Eleanor jumped in delight, beaming like a child.

"Money really does move mountains," Julian mused, stepping onto the terrace with a cigarette between his lips. The ember glowed faintly in the dim light. "If I offered enough, they’d probably eat dirt with a smile."

"I’m going to get my bear!"

Eleanor tried to slip past him, but Julian blocked her path effortlessly.

After the car accident, he had vowed never to let her run from him again.

"Not so fast," he said, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. "It’s soaked. My assistant will dry it before giving it back."

Eleanor kept her gaze lowered, too flustered to meet his hypnotic eyes. "Th-Thank you…"

"Congratulations to our winner!" Natalia announced, taking the bear from the woman. "You’ve earned free VIP access to VELVET for a year!"

The woman screamed in excitement while the crowd buzzed with envy.

VELVET was the most exclusive club in Crestview. A year of free entry was like winning the lottery.

Julian flicked his cigarette and signaled Natalia.

She grinned. "And as a thank-you for helping Mr. Montgomery’s sister, all tabs tonight are on him!"

The crowd erupted into cheers.
###Chapter 401

"Cheers to Mr. Montgomery! Long live Mr. Montgomery!"

"Hell yes! Julian's incredible! I need a Velvet Lounge membership ASAP!"

"Sign me up for a three-year membership renewal! Mr. Montgomery keeps his promises!"

The crowd erupted in thunderous applause, their excitement palpable in the air.

Natalia Montgomery's phone buzzed with a text from sales - tonight's revenue shattered all previous records since Velvet Lounge's grand opening.

Though Julian Montgomery came from old money, he was no spoiled heir.

What appeared as extravagant generosity tonight was actually a masterstroke of marketing. By treating every guest, he'd won public favor, boosted Velvet Lounge's prestige, and stimulated future spending - a triple victory.

"It's too extravagant..." Eleanor lowered her thick lashes, biting her plump lower lip in discomfort.

"What? Worried about my finances?" Julian arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow in amusement.

True, he'd spent a small fortune tonight. But the joy he felt was priceless. When was the last time he'd experienced such genuine happiness?

Julian couldn't determine whether his lavish display was to impress this intriguing girl or satisfy his own whims.

Eleanor blinked her doe-like eyes, giving a tiny nod.

"Ha! Fascinating." Julian chuckled. "Most women beg me to spend more on them. Yet here you are, distressed over my spending for your sake."

Turning, he leaned against the balcony railing, studying Eleanor's flushed cheeks. A roguish smile played on his lips. "Why? Planning to manage my finances someday, little one?"

The alcohol loosened his tongue, making him bolder than usual.

Standing so close, Eleanor could feel his warm breath caressing the shell of her ear. The sensation sent involuntary shivers down her spine.

She hunched her shoulders timidly. "I-I'm not a bank. I don't want to handle your money."

"Banks aren't the only ones who can manage my wealth, Eleanor." Julian's baritone voice dropped an octave as he reached out to toy with her silken strands. "Why didn't you keep those curls? Though I must say, this straight style suits you. Adorably so."

Eleanor's eyes reddened as she turned away, feeling mocked. "I don't like perms."

"You don't?" Genuine surprise colored his voice.

When her hair slipped through his fingers, an inexplicable emptiness settled in his chest.

"I don't like perms," Eleanor confessed softly, lifting her delicate face to meet his gaze. "But if you prefer it... I'll get one. You saved me tonight and found Mr. Snuggles... I'm grateful. I'll do whatever you wish."

"Whatever I wish?" Dark desire flared in Julian's eyes, his breathing growing ragged.

From any other woman, this would be a blatant invitation. But from Eleanor's innocent lips, he knew she meant every word literally.

"Mr. Montgomery."

A waiter entered with a crystal decanter of ruby-red wine and two glasses. "Compliments of Mr. Whitmore - a vintage from his Belvaux estate."

Julian nodded his approval. As the waiter departed, Eleanor's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine, her pink tongue darting out to moisten her lips.

That telltale gesture didn't escape Julian's notice. "Care for a drink?" he offered with an amused smile.

"R-Really?" Her eyes widened like a child offered candy.

"Clearly you enjoy wine. That night in the garden-"

Julian's throat went dry as memories of their moonlit encounter surfaced. He forcibly pushed down the heat threatening to consume him.

Before he could finish, Eleanor had already poured the wine with surprising grace. She brought the glass to her nose, inhaling deeply like a curious kitten.

With practiced movements, she swirled the liquid, studying its legs and hue like a seasoned sommelier. Finally, she took a delicate sip, savoring each nuanced flavor with closed eyes.
###Chapter 402

Eleanor murmured, "This is the 1998 Château Noir Merlot, exclusively reserved for the Presidential Estate. Its deep garnet hue carries concentrated flavors with remarkable purity. The bouquet reveals complex layers of dark berries, toffee, and freshly roasted espresso beans. The tannins are robust yet elegantly structured."

Julian was astonished. Not only did Eleanor possess artistic talent, but her wine expertise surpassed even his own.

Having operated Velvet Lounge for years with private vineyards in Belvaux and Montclair, Julian considered himself a connoisseur - yet Eleanor's palate left him humbled.

This was a masterclass in subtle sophistication.

Isabelle and Cassandra had completely lost their party mood. Both seethed with the urge to storm Julian's private suite and confront that insufferable Eleanor.

"Sniff... Isabelle, look! I told you!" Cassandra wept in the restroom, her mascara streaking down flushed cheeks as half her false lashes dangled precariously. "Eleanor's seducing your brother! Did you see how he turned the club upside down for that ridiculous stuffed animal? When has Julian ever pampered any woman like this? You're his blood sister, yet he's doting on Nathan's sister instead! I can't endure this humiliation!"

While sobbing dramatically, Cassandra expertly fanned Isabelle's fury - though the latter needed no encouragement. Isabelle's rage had already reached volcanic levels. "How could Julian?! He's never indulged me this way, not even when we were children!"

Isabelle recalled losing expensive toys as a girl. Julian would simply replace them with superior versions, never bothering to retrieve the originals. She'd mistaken his financial generosity for affection - but compared to tonight's display for Eleanor, those childhood gestures seemed pitifully impersonal.

The Julian Montgomery she knew loathed inconvenience. Yet he'd upended his entire establishment for Eleanor's childish comfort item. The realization shattered Isabelle's heart.

"That scheming girl already has Nathan wrapped around her finger," Cassandra hissed. "Now she's stealing Julian too. If this continues, she'll replace you as his favorite."

"Replace me? Over my dead body!" Isabelle's eyes burned with venomous hatred. Unable to contain herself any longer, she stormed out in a fury, stiletto heels striking marble like gunshots.

Once alone, Cassandra abruptly stopped crying. A cold smirk twisted her lips as she calmly reapplied her lashes before the mirror, humming a triumphant tune.

Back in the private suite, Eleanor and Julian had nearly emptied the decanter. Wine-flushed and pleasantly intoxicated, Eleanor's usual reserved demeanor melted away. Words poured from her rosy lips in an uncharacteristic stream, which Julian found inexplicably soothing - a rare comfort he hadn't experienced in years.

"Did you know female arousal has biological roots?" Eleanor's cheeks glowed pink as she sipped her wine. "The X chromosome carries genes enhancing color perception. With two X chromosomes, women experience colors more vividly than men!"

"Is that so?" Julian's lips curved as his gaze dropped to her plump, wine-stained mouth, then lower to her delicate feet - previously hidden in modest sneakers but now bare and unconsciously flexing against the velvet upholstery. His pupils dilated with hunger.

"Also, women's bodies contain higher water content - nearly 60% compared to men's!" Eleanor continued enthusiastically, relishing this rare opportunity for unfiltered conversation. "It's because our body fat percentage is naturally—"

Suddenly, the entire club plunged into darkness.

"Hmm?" Eleanor blinked in confusion. "Julian, does Velvet Lounge often have power outages?"

Before she could react, strong arms enveloped her. Her breath caught as her pulse skyrocketed. Julian knelt before her, tilting her chin up with featherlight fingers before capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

Their wine-scented breaths mingled as tongues tangled passionately. Somewhere in the darkness, ethereal music began playing.

Then - a flicker of light. In that fleeting illumination, Eleanor glimpsed Julian's half-lidded eyes glittering like captured starlight: mesmerizing yet dangerously unpredictable.
###Chapter 403

The flickering crimson lights cast dancing shadows over their entangled figures.

Eleanor's slender frame trembled slightly in Julian's embrace. She remained passive, yet her innocent reactions only fueled Julian's reckless desire.

The alcohol coursing through his veins stripped away his restraint.

Eleanor gasped as Julian's towering form pressed her down.

Her limp body sank into the plush sofa cushions.

Julian's breathing grew ragged. His lips never left hers, devouring her with hungry kisses.

A sultry jazz melody floated from the stage.

"Heaven is in your eyes, bright as the stars were under..."

Julian kissed her until her thoughts scattered. Her luminous eyes glazed over with desire.

"Mmm..."

His gaze burned with primal hunger—like a starved predator finally tasting its prey.

Even intoxicated, a sliver of awareness reminded him—Eleanor was his best friend's sister.

At the last possible moment, he wrenched himself away.

"You...you..." Eleanor's dazed whisper trailed off, her mind too foggy to form coherent words.

That kiss had intoxicated her more than any liquor.

"Just testing your little theory," Julian murmured, his whiskey-rough voice laced with dark amusement. "About women's...natural inclinations."

"Do I...seem inclined?" Her eyelids grew impossibly heavy.

Julian brushed his lips against her forehead. "Sleep, little rose. I'll give you the answer tomorrow."

The vivacious girl from moments ago now lay pliant in his arms, succumbing to exhaustion.

The singer's velvet voice wove through her fading consciousness:

"Why stop to think of whether this little dream might fade..."

CRASH!

The door exploded inward as Isabelle Montgomery stormed into the VIP lounge.

Disheveled socialites scrambled apart like startled birds. Women shrieked and clung to their companions.

"Who the hell—?" A bleary-eyed man pointed accusingly.

Julian had kept his sister sheltered. Isabelle's years abroad meant few in Crestview recognized the Montgomery heiress.

Fury radiated from Isabelle in waves. Without a word, she snatched a champagne bottle and smashed it across the nearest man's head.

Glass shattered. Screams erupted.

"You disgusting pigs!" Isabelle's murderous glare promised violence.

"Crazy bitch!" Two men lunged forward.

"Gentlemen." Julian's icy voice cut through the chaos as he emerged from the terrace, cradling a sleeping Eleanor. "Are you harassing my baby sister?"

The room froze.

"Sister?!"
###Chapter 404

The two men exchanged tense glances before reluctantly sinking back into their seats.

Blood trickled down the face of the man who'd been struck with the champagne bottle. He forced a strained chuckle. "Ah, Ms. Montgomery. Our apologies for any disrespect."

"Isabelle! What in heaven's name are you doing?" Eleanor's voice cut through the club's music as she spotted her brother Julian carrying a barely conscious Eleanor Blackwood.

Dominic's grip tightened around the sleeping woman as he frowned at his sister. "Isabelle, control yourself."

"You're the one who needs controlling!" Isabelle's hands trembled with rage. "Did I ruin your little tryst with that Blackwood tramp?"

The other club patrons held their breath, including the injured man who now dabbed at his bleeding temple with a monogrammed handkerchief.

"I've told you repeatedly," Julian's voice dropped to a dangerous octave. "You don't come to Velvet without my knowledge. This isn't some playground, Isabelle."

His sister scoffed, jabbing a manicured finger toward his face. "Spare me the protective brother act! You're just furious I caught you with Nathan's sister!"

The temperature in the VIP section seemed to drop several degrees when Julian uttered through clenched teeth: "Isabelle Montgomery."

A shiver ran down Isabelle's spine. In twenty-three years, her brother had never once used her full name.

"Leave. Now." Each word carried the weight of a judge's gavel.

"Not without you!" Isabelle crossed her arms defiantly.

Julian adjusted Eleanor's sleeping form against his chest. "I have responsibilities tonight. Go home."

"You're actually going to—" Isabelle's screech made several patrons wince.

"Natalia!"

The statuesque bodyguard materialized instantly. "Sir?"

"Escort my sister home."

Natalia moved with military precision, her iron grip closing around Isabelle's slender wrist.

"Unhand me! How dare you touch—OW! You're hurting me!" Isabelle's protests faded as she was unceremoniously dragged through the club's velvet curtains.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter lounged in her penthouse suite's sunken marble tub, surrounded by floating gardenia petals. The scent of bergamot candles mingled with steam rising from the milky water.

"Divine," she sighed, wiggling her toes as the heated jets massaged her shoulders. Her phone's vibration sent ripples across the water's surface.

Theodore's name flashed on the screen. "If this is about the Westridge files, darling, let's discuss it over breakfast."

"Ms. Carter," Theodore's voice held uncharacteristic tension. "There's something you should know. But please remain calm."

Evelyn flicked a petal with her fingernail. "Theodore, I survived three boardroom coups before thirty. Try me."

A weighted pause. Then: "Julian Montgomery just carried Eleanor Blackwood into the Grand Monarch. They took the private elevator to the penthouse suites."

The gardenia-scented water sloshed violently as Evelyn shot upright. "Say that again."

"Julian and Eleanor. Together. I saw the registration myself."

Evelyn's breathing shallowed. The bathroom mirrors fogged with the heat of her rage.

Then the walls shook with her roar: "WHERE'S MY EMERALD CUTTER? I'LL CARVE THAT TRAITOROUS BASTARD INTO MINIATURE PORTRAITS!"
###Chapter 405

Evelyn didn't even have time to dry her hair.

She threw on a cashmere coat over her silk nightgown and sped toward Monarch Grand Hotel in her Bugatti. Water droplets still clung to her dark locks, leaving damp trails down her back.

Her mind raced the entire drive.

After months of silence, she finally tapped Nathan's name in her contacts—the first time she'd initiated contact since their divorce.

Nathan was currently in Serenia, a neighboring city two hundred kilometers from Crestview.

He'd recently purchased land there to develop a luxury hot spring retreat, still under construction.

At that moment, Nathan and Oliver stood on-site, yellow hard hats secured as they reviewed blueprints under the glow of construction lights.

Just as Oliver adjusted the flashlight for Nathan, his phone buzzed.

Nathan frowned, pulling it out with chilled fingers.

Evelyn Carter.

Her name blazed across the screen like starlight piercing through darkness.

His breath caught.

His pulse hammered so violently he feared Oliver might hear it. The phone nearly slipped from his unsteady grip.

"Oh! It's Mrs. Blackwood!" Oliver whispered excitedly.

"I see that. Control yourself," Nathan muttered, though his own composure was crumbling.

His numb fingers betrayed him—he accidentally declined the call.

Nathan's stomach dropped. He cursed his traitorous hands.

A second later, Evelyn called again.

"Hello." His voice came out rougher than intended.

"Finally decided to answer?" Evelyn's melodic voice carried its signature mocking lilt.

"Always." The word held more weight than he intended.

"Spare me the act, Mr. Blackwood. Three years of marriage taught me all your tells. This isn't even the first time you've hung up on me."

Nathan blinked. "When have I ever—"

"Not interested in revisiting history." Her tone turned glacial. "I'm calling because your best friend needs a funeral arranged."

Nathan's blood ran cold. "Julian? What did he do?"

"If he'd actually succeeded, he'd already be six feet under! It's Eleanor!"

Evelyn's voice shook with fury. "Julian got her drunk and checked into my hotel with her. My assistant witnessed everything."

"What?"

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "Julian wouldn't—"

"Of course you'd defend him," Evelyn scoffed. "Birds of a feather."

"Evelyn—"

"I'm heading to Monarch Grand now. If that bastard hasn't crossed the final line, I might let him keep his dignity intact. Barely."

Her next words came clipped and precise. "I'll contain the scandal, but Eleanor's reputation is at stake. Get here immediately. I'll extract her—you handle damage control. And Nathan?"

A beat of silence.

"Don't bring anyone else into this."

The line went dead.

Nathan stared at the darkened screen, an odd pang striking his chest.

Memories surfaced—Evelyn inventing trivial reasons to call during their marriage. Back then, he'd found it irritating yet endearing. Had he ever actually hung up on her?

"Emergency in Crestview. I need to leave now."

Oliver gaped. "This instant?"

"Evelyn's already en route. She'll protect Eleanor, but I need to handle the fallout." Nathan's jaw clenched. "Isn't there a helicopter at Blackwood Galleria's helipad?"

"Yes, but at this hour—"

Nathan was already striding toward the exit. "I'll fly it myself."

Midnight shadows swallowed Crestview whole.
###Chapter 406

The tires shrieked against the pavement as Nathan watched Evelyn whip the Bugatti into the parking spot with terrifying precision.

Theodore couldn't help but smirk in admiration.

Evelyn flung the car door open, her dark hair still damp from the shower. Her usually composed face was twisted with fury.

"Where is that bastard Julian hiding?"

"The penthouse suite," Theodore answered, lowering his voice. "Top floor. Only one suite up there—so you won’t disturb other guests while you... handle things."

"Good."

Minutes later, Evelyn stormed down the hallway, her stilettos clicking like gunshots against the marble floor. Theodore trailed behind, half-convinced she was about to catch a cheating spouse rather than rescue Eleanor.

"Open it."

"Yes, Miss Carter."

Theodore swiped the master key. Before he could even step aside, Evelyn kicked the door with such force the hinges groaned in protest.

"Julian Montgomery! Get your disgusting ass out here NOW!"

Her voice echoed through the suite like a war cry.

Julian emerged from the bedroom, still dripping wet. His bare torso glistened under the chandelier light, a towel hanging precariously low on his hips.

Theodore inhaled sharply. One wrong move, and that towel would be on the floor—along with whatever dignity Julian had left.

"Evelyn?" Julian's face lit up with genuine surprise. "Damn, if I knew you were coming, I would’ve dressed up—or stayed naked. You tell me which you prefer." He flashed a roguish grin.

Evelyn didn’t answer.

Instead, she crossed the distance between them in three strides.

SMACK!

SMACK!

SMACK!

Three brutal slaps echoed through the suite. Julian staggered back, his cheek flaming red, his expression a mix of shock and betrayal.

"You—you hit me?" His voice cracked. "Three times?"

Theodore winced. He wasn’t sure if he should be more concerned about Julian’s face or Evelyn’s hand.

"Damn right I did!" Evelyn hissed, flexing her stinging palm. "Did I not warn you? Eleanor is like a sister to me! Are the women in this city not enough for you? Did you really think it was acceptable to prey on my friend’s sister?"

"No! Evelyn, listen—" Julian’s voice was desperate, but she cut him off.

"I misjudged you, Julian. You’re worse than filth."

The words hit Julian like a knife. His eyes darkened, his jaw clenched.

Then—

"What the hell did you do to Eleanor?"

A cold, lethal voice cut through the tension.

Evelyn turned to see Nathan striding toward them, his usually immaculate appearance disheveled, his eyes burning with quiet rage.

She frowned. Why did he look like he’d just crawled out of a coal mine?

"Nathan!" Julian whirled toward him, pointing at his swollen cheek. "Your ex-wife just assaulted me! She accused me of something I didn’t do—control her!"

Nathan’s gaze flicked between them, unreadable. Then, with a faint sigh, he met Evelyn’s furious glare.

"I don’t control her," he said simply. "No one does."
###Chapter 407

Nathan's eyes widened as he took in the breathtaking sight before him.

The words themselves were simple enough.

But paired with Julian's intense stare and that gravelly tone, Nathan could practically taste the raw emotion hanging thick in the air.

No—not emotion.

Unrequited longing. That's all this was.

Nathan cursed under his breath for being caught without his phone. What he wouldn't give to capture Julian's lovesick expression right now—just to shove it in his face later.

"Besides, your memory's terrible."

Julian's chiseled features tightened, stormy eyes flashing with barely restrained fury. "I warned you to stay away from Evelyn. Yet here you are, crossing every boundary. Three slaps weren't enough—she should've broken your nose!"

"Our boundaries?" Evelyn's stomach twisted. Being lumped together with Julian like this made her skin crawl.

"Mr. Blackwood, mind your phrasing. You're your own person—don't drag me into this." Her voice could've frozen hell as she spun toward the bedroom. "Or I'll need ear bleach."

Julian's lips pressed into a thin line.

"Pfft! Failed romance act!" Nathan crowed, delight bubbling up at Julian's visible frustration.

His triumph lasted exactly one second before Julian's fist connected with his sculpted abdomen. White-hot pain exploded through him—he swore his soul briefly left his body.

Evelyn hurried down the hallway, pulse racing.

The usually unshakable woman ran through a dozen worst-case scenarios in her mind. If even one of them proved true when she opened that door, not even Julian could stop her from ending Nathan Montgomery.

"Eleanor!"

She burst into the room—and froze.

Silence.

None of her imagined horrors materialized.

Instead, soft lamplight bathed Eleanor's peaceful face as she slept, the faint scent of vanilla lingering in the air. A well-loved teddy bear was clutched tightly in her arms.

Evelyn approached on silent feet, sinking to her knees beside the bed. Her fingers trembled as they brushed Eleanor's warm cheek.

Something sharp and painful lodged itself in Evelyn's chest. Her breath hitched, eyes burning.

Tears?

The fearless Evelyn Carter who laughed in the face of danger couldn't handle this simple sight.

Julian entered just then, shoulders stiffening at the scene. His throat worked silently.

Hearing his approach, Evelyn hastily swiped at her eyes.

A heavy silence settled between them.

Julian swallowed hard before reaching for her damp hair. "You'll catch cold."

"Not your concern."

She jerked away, putting distance between them.

Julian's hands curled into fists.

He didn't recognize himself anymore. These impulses, these actions—they made no sense.

"Nathan didn't touch Eleanor. He may be an idiot, but he knows some lines can't be crossed."

"That means nothing. Men's promises are as reliable as their zippers." Her glare could've cut glass.

Seeing her anger, Julian knew further words were useless. He turned abruptly toward the bathroom.

Seconds later, he returned with a towel draped over her head.

"Dry it properly before you go."

"I said—"

His large hands were already working the towel through her hair with surprising gentleness.

Evelyn went still, heart pounding.

Who was this man?

Certainly not the Nathan Blackwood she knew.
###Chapter 408

Evelyn couldn't help but wonder if Nathan was still the same man who had once refused to even pour her a glass of water.

How could he be drying her hair now?

Had he been possessed?

"Get your hands off me!" she gritted out in a hushed tone, careful not to wake Eleanor.

The girl lay curled beneath the quilt, still deep in sleep.

"If you want to wake Eleanor, by all means, make more noise," Nathan murmured, his lips curving slightly as he continued to towel-dry her hair. He had found her weakness.

"Then be gentle! I've been losing too much hair lately. You're going to make me bald!" Evelyn scowled, her cheeks flushing with irritation.

"Sorry, this is my first time doing this. No experience."

An inexplicable warmth bloomed in Nathan's chest. His fingers stilled before resuming their careful motions, rubbing her hair gently with the towel. "I'll do better next time."

Evelyn suppressed a shiver. "Nathan," she said coldly, "I'm only tolerating this for Eleanor's sake. Next time, I'll cut off your hands."

Nathan chuckled but didn’t stop, his fingers now massaging her scalp with surprising skill.

Against her will, Evelyn felt the tension in her body ease. Her lashes fluttered halfway shut.

Damn it. How was he this good at this? It felt too good.

When they finally stepped out of the bedroom, Evelyn's eyes were slightly red, as if she'd been crying.

Nathan tilted his head, his gaze lingering on her.

Julian blinked at them, momentarily dazed. For a second, it felt like they were still the perfect couple—not the divorced pair they were now.

Nathan was devastatingly handsome. Julian couldn’t think of any woman who could match him except Evelyn.

"Julian, you should go home. Eleanor will stay here tonight." Nathan’s tone was calm. "It’ll be troublesome to wake her now. I’ll take her back tomorrow morning."

"I’m not leaving. I’ll stay with her."

Julian remembered the kiss he’d stolen from Eleanor while drunk. Though a kiss couldn’t lead to pregnancy, guilt gnawed at him. He wanted to make it up to her.

"No." The ex-couple spoke in unison.

"Ms. Carter!"

Theodore strode in, phone in hand. "The security manager just reported a helicopter on the hotel rooftop. They don’t know who it belongs to."

"A helicopter?"

"It's mine," Nathan admitted without hesitation.

Evelyn and Theodore froze.

"Mr. Blackwood was on a business trip in Serenia yesterday," Theodore explained. "Ms. Kingsley, he flew back the moment you called him!"

If only Nathan had half of Julian’s persistence and shamelessness.

Nathan’s chest tightened with embarrassment. "Oliver, that’s enough."

"Mr. Montgomery, why tell me this? Expecting me to praise your boss?" Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "When a good person does something bad, people say their true nature is revealed. But when a bad person does something good, suddenly they’ve ‘changed.’"

Julian muffled a laugh behind his hand.

Nathan had no retort.

"Eleanor is his sister. Of course he’d rush back. That’s basic human decency—nothing praiseworthy."

With that, Evelyn strode out, done with both of them.

Theodore shot Nathan a frosty glance before following his boss.

"Hmph! Who does he think he is?" Oliver muttered, offended by Theodore’s attitude.

"At least he knows when to keep quiet."

Nathan exhaled sharply, shaking his head in frustration. "Oliver, you’re excellent at everything—except knowing when to shut up."

"I just wanted Ms. Carter to know how hard you worked," Oliver grumbled.

"She always knew."

The words left Nathan’s lips before he could stop them, and a sharp pang of regret pierced his chest. Memories of Evelyn’s kindness—her unwavering support—flooded back like a relentless tide.

She had always known.

But when she had loved him, Nathan had been blind to it all.

Now, between them lay too much love, too much pain. And no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t sure he could ever make it right.
###Chapter 409

Evelyn returned to the VIP lounge with Theodore after ensuring Eleanor was safe.

The entire ride back, she couldn't stop replaying the moment Nathan had gently dried her hair. Her pulse quickened. Her throat tightened.

"Sorry, it's my first time doing this. I don't have much experience."

Absolute nonsense! Evelyn scoffed internally. He was with Victoria for years. Even if they never slept together, they must have done everything else. Why is he acting so innocent with me? And he's best friends with Julian—birds of a feather!

The moment she stepped into her penthouse, Evelyn kicked off her stilettos and stormed to the couch, sinking into it with a scowl.

Theodore quietly warmed a glass of milk and handed it to her, concern flickering in his gaze. "Ms. Carter, it's past midnight. Drink this and rest."

"How did Eleanor end up at VELVET tonight?" Evelyn demanded, ignoring the milk. "The Blackwoods monitor her every move. This doesn't make sense."

"I questioned Julian," Theodore admitted. "He claimed he had no idea why she showed up. But he mentioned she was frantically searching for something. If he hadn't found her..."

Evelyn's fingers clenched around the glass. "Searching for what?"

"The stuffed bear you gave her."

Her breath caught. How did Eleanor's bear end up at VELVET?

"I pressed Julian about any unusual activity at the club," Theodore continued smoothly. "He denied it—but slipped that his sister, Isabelle, was there."

Evelyn's lips curled. Even without witnessing it firsthand, the pieces clicked.

"Cassandra." Her voice turned icy. "She never learns, does she? Bullying Eleanor again? She’s begging for consequences."

Theodore blinked.

"Oh, I will make her regret it."

Meanwhile, Julian stumbled into his penthouse after Nathan forcibly ejected him from VELVET.

He collapsed onto his bed, eyes shutting—only for the memory of Eleanor's soft lips to flood his mind.

I’m a goddamn monster.

Gritting his teeth, Julian wrenched himself up and stalked to the shower, turning the water ice-cold. Twenty minutes under the brutal spray barely dulled the heat coursing through him.

Dawn was breaking by the time he finally slept.

When Julian finally woke the next afternoon, Isabelle was waiting outside his door, arms crossed, eyes blazing.

"You’ve crossed a line, Julian!"

He arched a brow. "By banning you from VELVET? Or by keeping you away from Cassandra?"

He reached to ruffle her hair, but she slapped his hand away. "Don’t touch me with the same hands that touched her. It’s disgusting!"

Julian froze. "What did you just say?"

Isabelle’s cheeks flushed, but humiliation from last night fueled her rage. "I hate Eleanor! You’re my brother! Why are you doting on her?"

Julian’s expression darkened. "Isabelle—"

"You turned the entire club upside down for some ratty toy of hers!" Her voice rose hysterically, drawing startled glances from passing staff.

"I’m your real sister! When have you ever cared for me like this? You just throw money at me! But for that—that simpleton—you’re suddenly so attentive?" Her voice cracked. "I was abroad for years! The second I return, you’re obsessed with her!"

"Enough." Julian’s voice turned lethal. "Eleanor is not a simpleton. You will not speak of her like that."

Isabelle recoiled—then stormed off, leaving Julian seething in her wake.
###Chapter 410

Julian Montgomery's jaw tightened when Isabelle called Eleanor a dummy. The harshness in her voice cut through him like a blade.

To him, Isabelle had always been radiant—a little spoiled, perhaps, but inherently kind.

Now, her crimson eyes burned with fury, her hatred for Eleanor so palpable it seemed to darken the air between them.

Was it because he had spent the evening with Eleanor?

Julian had been with countless women over the years, yet Isabelle had never reacted like this. Why did she despise Eleanor so much?

"Julian, you're yelling at me over that—that idiot!" Isabelle's face paled as his piercing glare locked onto her. A cold sweat broke across her skin.

"Eleanor is not an idiot," Julian said, his voice dangerously low. "If I hear that word from you again, Isabelle, I won't be so forgiving."

He exhaled sharply, his chest heavy with disappointment. "You were too young to remember when Father died. Mother was drowning in family affairs, and I was the one who fed you, played with you, even changed your diapers. How could you say I don’t care about you?" His voice cracked. "Hearing that from you—it hurts more than you know."

"Julian—" Isabelle's voice trembled.

"I do care. But we're adults now. The way I show it has changed, and you refuse to see it." His gaze darkened. "What I don’t understand is why you hate Eleanor so much. What has she ever done to you?"

"I just don’t like her! She’s not good enough for you!" Isabelle blurted, scrambling for an excuse.

Julian's expression hardened. "You don’t get to decide who deserves me, Isabelle. Eleanor is Nathan Blackwood’s sister—her status is no less than ours. And even if she had nothing, no one could stop me from being with the woman I choose."

With that declaration, he turned and walked away, leaving Isabelle seething behind him.

A week had passed since Isabella Wang terminated her contract with Monarch Grand Hotels.

Theodore Winslow rubbed his temples in frustration. "Ms. Carter, we’ve monitored the entire team, but there’s been no movement. Maybe there’s no mole after all."

Evelyn Carter didn’t look up from her game. "No one’s reached out to Vivian Prescott?"

"Nothing suspicious."

A smirk curled her lips as she obliterated the last zombie on-screen. The gory explosion made Theodore wince. "Then we’ll have to lure the fish out. Call an emergency meeting with the wedding team—now."

Thirty minutes later, eight staff members filed into the conference room.

Evelyn strode in ten minutes late, her demeanor unbothered despite the failed contract. "Apologies for the delay. Urgent matters."

She took her seat at the head of the table, scanning each face with calculated ease. "I’ve revised the wedding plan. Isabella Wang will reconsider working with us."

Gasps of excitement filled the room. "Really? That’s incredible, Ms. Carter!"

Evelyn’s smile didn’t reach her eyes as she studied them. Then she noticed it—Julian Whitmore, one of the planners, had gone rigid.

He cleared his throat. "Ms. Carter, hasn’t Isabella already signed with Blackwood Industries? At this stage, can we really sway her back?"

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the table, her gaze sharpening. "Oh? Where did you hear she chose Blackwood Industries? That’s news to me."

The room fell silent.

Julian’s Adam’s apple bobbed.

Got you.
###Chapter 411

The sharp question sliced through the air like a blade, and every gaze in the room locked onto Julian Whitmore.

Though Evelyn Carter’s piercing stare sent a chill down his spine, Julian straightened his shoulders and answered smoothly, "It's an open secret. Isabella Laurent was torn between us and the Blackwood Hotel before, but you managed to sway her decision for the wedding. Now that we’ve lost the contract and her big day is approaching, it’s only logical she’d switch to them."

His reasoning was flawless.

Leaning back in her chair, Evelyn smirked. "You make a fair point, but you're overlooking one crucial detail. The Blackwoods haven’t signed a formal agreement with Isabella yet."

Gasps rippled through the room. "What? It’s been a week! How is that possible?"

Julian’s expression remained neutral, but his fingers tightened imperceptibly around his pen.

"If they had, the Blackwoods would’ve announced it to the world. Their silence tells me negotiations are still ongoing." Evelyn rose gracefully, spinning her leather chair with a flick of her wrist. "And I don’t back down until the final second. I’ve drafted a new proposal—one that might just catch Blackwood Industries off guard."

The team erupted in cheers. "That’s our Ms. Carter!"

Julian forced a smile, echoing their enthusiasm—though his eyes remained cold.

"But we’re the ones who botched the contract first," he pointed out carefully. "Isabella might refuse to even meet with us."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a confident smirk, her emerald eyes gleaming with challenge.

"Plans change. And even if the odds are against us, I’ll make sure we leave our mark."

Once the committee dispersed, only Evelyn and Theodore Winslow remained in the vast conference room.

Accepting the coffee Theodore handed her, Evelyn strode to the floor-to-ceiling window, savoring the panoramic view of Crestview as she took a slow sip.

"Ms. Carter, was that new proposal just bait?" Theodore asked, stepping beside her.

"Indeed," she murmured, her gaze sharpening. "And someone just took it."

Theodore’s eyes widened. "Who?"

"A suspicion, nothing more. But I’ll need proof." Evelyn’s voice dropped to a whisper. "Keep an eye on Julian after hours tonight. Report back immediately if he meets anyone suspicious."

The next morning, Eleanor Blackwood stirred awake in her bed, clutching her childhood teddy bear. Nathan Blackwood had dropped her off at Cliffside Manor last night.

With Nathan’s protection, Penelope Whitmore hadn’t dared complain to Leonard Blackwood. Cassandra Blackwood, who had instigated the whole mess, wisely kept quiet—knowing Penelope wouldn’t scold her, but Leonard certainly would.

Curling deeper into her blankets, Eleanor’s mind drifted back to last night. Her pulse quickened, her cheeks flushing as fragmented memories surfaced.

She had blacked out. The details were hazy—how she got home, what happened after—but one sensation burned vividly in her mind: the weight of Julian Montgomery’s lips against hers in the dark, his smoldering gaze stripping her soul bare.

With a shaky breath, Eleanor pushed herself up and moved to her desk.

She pulled out a sketchbook and pencil, closing her eyes briefly before letting her hand glide across the paper.

Minutes later, the striking portrait of a devilishly handsome man stared back at her—his roguish smirk captured perfectly.

Eleanor traced the lines of his jaw, her fingers lingering over his piercing eyes.

"Julian is… unfairly beautiful."

Little did she know, at that very moment, Julian’s crimson Ferrari roared up the driveway of Cliffside Manor.

"Who did you say is here?"

Penelope, strolling through the autumn gardens with Leonard, froze as the butler delivered the unexpected news.

"Mr. Julian Montgomery has arrived."
###Chapter 412

Leonard checked his watch and frowned.

At this time of day? He knew Nathan wasn't home, and dinner was nearly ready. Why would Julian show up unannounced?

"Leonard, don't overthink it," Penelope chided, looping her arm through his. "Julian doesn’t visit often. Maybe he’s here for Cassandra."

Leonard’s brows shot up. "Cassandra and Julian?"

"You’ve been too buried in work to notice," Penelope said with a playful poke to his arm. "Cassandra has had feelings for him for ages."

Leonard was stunned. "She never mentioned it."

"Girls don’t just announce these things," Penelope replied, feigning embarrassment for their daughter.

Leonard’s expression turned serious. "Cassandra is my eldest. Her marriage must align with our family’s interests. She deserves the best Crestview has to offer."

Penelope nodded. "The Montgomerys are one of the most influential families in the city. Julian is Archibald’s only heir—his uncle is too old to produce one. The empire will be his soon enough."

She had it all mapped out. "Besides, he and Nathan are close. A union between our families would strengthen ties."

Leonard’s frown eased.

Julian might have a reputation as a playboy, but that was typical for young men of his status. Once he settled down, he’d focus on family. And with Cassandra by his side, she’d keep him in line.

Julian lounged in the Blackwood living room, perfectly at ease.

He’d spent countless childhood afternoons at Cliffside Manor with Nathan. Pouring himself a drink, he didn’t bother waiting for the staff.

"Julian, what brings you here?" Leonard appeared, though he usually left socializing to Penelope.

After their earlier conversation, though, he felt he should make an appearance.

"Apologies for dropping in unannounced, Uncle Leonard," Julian said smoothly.

"We were just about to have dinner. Won’t you join us?" Penelope offered.

Julian shook his head. "I won’t stay long." He set his glass down. "Is Cassandra home? I need to speak with her."

Leonard and Penelope exchanged a glance.

Cassandra had been avoiding Julian lately, per her mother’s advice to play hard to get.

She hadn’t expected it to work so well—now he was here, seeking her out.

Her heart pounded as she entered the room.

"You wanted to see me, Julian?"

He took a slow sip of his drink. "Yes."

Cassandra sat across from him, feigning shyness. "What is it?"

His gaze turned icy. "Do you have anything to say about what happened at Velvet last night?"

Her stomach dropped. "What do you mean?"

"Eleanor never leaves the house. So how did her teddy bear end up dumped at my club?"

Julian’s fingers tapped against his glass. "You crossed a line, Cassandra."

Her face paled.

"You’ve got it all wrong," she stammered, eyes welling with tears.

Julian scoffed. "Eleanor didn’t cry when you humiliated her. Why are you?"

He stood, done with her theatrics. "Two things. One—stay away from Evelyn. If you target her again, you’ll regret it. Two—keep your distance from Zoe. She’s innocent. I won’t let you corrupt her."

Without another word, he walked out.

The door slammed shut.

Cassandra collapsed onto the floor, trembling.
###Chapter 413

Julian wasn't in a rush to leave after stepping out of the lounge. Instead, he lingered in the corridor, his footsteps slow and deliberate.

He appeared to be taking a casual stroll, but his mind was working overtime.

Julian's sharp eyes scanned the area, hoping to catch a glimpse of that small, timid figure with her perpetually lowered gaze.

He wasn't a saint.

But there was something about that fragile girl that tugged at his heartstrings.

"Young Master Julian? What are you doing here?" Agnes hurried toward him, her expression a mix of surprise and suspicion.

"Uh—well—" Julian fumbled for words, his usual confidence faltering. Finally, he steeled himself and asked, "Agnes, where is Eleanor's room?"

Agnes's eyes widened in disbelief.

Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined Julian seeking out Eleanor.

"What do you want with her, Young Master Julian? Miss Eleanor isn't comfortable around strangers. Don't frighten her."

Julian frowned. "Agnes, you've known me since I was a boy. I grew up with Nathan."

"If you ask me, you and Young Master Nathan are fine," Agnes said, giving a thumbs-up. Then she added pointedly, "But you with women?" She gave a thumbs-down.

Julian groaned and rubbed his temples.

It took considerable effort—and a fair amount of groveling—for Julian to convince Agnes he wasn't up to no good. Finally, she relented and led him to Eleanor's room.

"I'll stand guard outside. Make it quick before someone sees you here," Agnes warned, planting herself firmly in front of the door.

Julian rolled his eyes. "We're not committing a crime, Agnes. Relax."

He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.

Agnes's indignant voice carried through the wood. "You little rascal! Watch your tone with me!"

Julian's breath caught as he took in Eleanor's room.

While Cassandra's quarters dripped with extravagant luxury, Eleanor's space was starkly minimalist. Beyond the manor's basic furnishings, there were no personal touches—nothing to suggest this was her home.

A faint scratching sound drew his attention toward the bedroom. Julian moved silently, his curiosity piqued.

The door was slightly ajar. He slipped inside unnoticed.

Eleanor sat hunched over a wide desk, her slender back to him as she sketched intently.

Julian's pulse quickened as he crept closer, peering over her shoulder.

His heart stuttered.

With delicate precision, Eleanor was drawing a portrait—and the subject was unmistakably him.

"Finished." Eleanor set down her pencil and admired her work with a small, satisfied smile.

"When were you planning to give that to me?"

"Ah!"

Eleanor shrieked and nearly toppled out of her chair. She scrambled to cover the drawing, but Julian was faster.

With a smirk, he snatched it away.

"G-Give it back!" Her cheeks flushed crimson as she stretched on her tiptoes, trying in vain to reclaim it.

Julian held it just out of reach, towering over her. Undeterred, Eleanor grabbed his collar and attempted to climb him like a tree.

"Cough! Let go! You're choking me!"

Gasping for air, Julian finally bent and hoisted her onto the desk just to breathe again.

"Give it back! It's mine!" Eleanor's eyes shimmered with frustrated tears.

"You drew me," Julian countered, his voice dropping low. "That means you've already given me the rights to it."

Their eyes locked, and the air between them crackled.

"Be honest, Eleanor—why not just give it to me?"

Her blush deepened. In her fluster, she yanked his collar harder.

Julian lost his balance.

With a startled gasp, he crashed into her, their lips a hair's breadth apart.

"Ah—that tickles."

Eleanor turned her face away as Julian's warm breath fanned across her skin.

Her heart hammered wildly.

Julian froze, fighting the heat pooling in his gut. With great effort, he pushed himself upright.

His breathing was ragged, his pupils dilated.

Though legally an adult, Eleanor looked heartbreakingly small curled up on the desk.

She hid half her face behind her knees and stretched out a hand.

"Give it back."
###Chapter 414

"I saved you—I mean, your teddy—last night. Can't you let me have the portrait in return?"

Julian Montgomery braced his muscular forearm against the desk, leaning closer with an intensity that made the air between them crackle. "I adore that sketch. May I keep it, please?"

Eleanor Blackwood's toes curled inside her ballet flats as she stammered, "I-I actually prepared something else for you."

His amber eyes ignited like sunlight through whiskey. "Show me."

Twenty minutes later, Julian slid into his Ferrari's butter-soft leather seat.

A triumphant grin split his face as he cradled two treasures—a pastry box and a rolled canvas. This was pure euphoria.

He'd never forgotten the portrait Eleanor gifted Reginald during the patriarch's birthday gala. That moment had planted an insatiable craving in Julian's chest—to possess a drawing crafted solely for him.

And now, against all odds, he held it.

The joy was so potent it threatened to crack his ribs.

After carefully stowing the sketch, he flipped open the cake box with boyish eagerness.

Inside sat a lopsided blueberry mousse cake, its frosting slightly smeared.

Julian swiped a finger through the cream and tasted it.

His brows knitted. "Odd. There's a tartness to it..."

Midnight found Evelyn Carter gaming in her study, a jade face mask clinging to her skin as her fingers flew across the keyboard. She hadn't budged for hours.

Truthfully, exhaustion weighed her eyelids like lead coins. But Theodore hadn't reported back after tailing Julian Whitmore tonight. Gaming kept her awake while she waited.

The server admin's latest invitation to join the pro league glowed on her screen—another decline. She played for distraction, not profit. Monarch Group heiresses didn't need tournament purses.

Beep.

A notification flashed: Alexander Whitmore had logged in. His avatar "Rose" winked at her handle "Lucifer."

[Rose: Fancy a match?]

[Lucifer: Make it quick. I'm babysitting a situation.]

Alexander's velvety baritone filled her headphones when the voice channel connected. "Evening, Ms. Devil."

"Likewise, Mr. Flower." Evelyn's lips quirked. "Blooming nicely tonight?"

"You're remarkably composed given Isabella Wang's theatrics." Admiration warmed his tone.

"Please. I was raised by wolves."

Alexander's chuckle was rich as aged bourbon. "Care to elaborate?"

"Let's just say if she's playing Darth Vader, I've got Yoda on speed dial."

The line crackled with his laughter before turning serious. "Do you require assistance?"

"Negative. This is between me and Blackwood Industries. No need to drag Whitmore Enterprises into my mess." She adjusted her headset. "Appreciate the offer though."

"I'm not offering as a Whitmore." His voice dropped to a intimate murmur. "I'm asking as Alexander."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the mouse.

"Don't mistake me—I have every confidence in you." His exhale ghosted through the speakers. "I simply hate seeing you stretched thin. These late-night stakeouts... I've missed our games."

Her breath hitched.

Had he been monitoring her login times?

The man had just resettled in Serenia after years abroad—no wonder he clung to their virtual rendezvous. Pathetic, really.

A knock shattered the moment.

"Theodore's back," she announced abruptly. "Duty calls. Sleep well, Mr. Whitmore."

She disconnected before he could respond.

Through the pixelated glow of his monitor, Alexander traced her offline icon with a fingertip. "Sweet dreams, Evelyn."

His expression hardened as he clicked into a surveillance file—Theodore's entire family tree glowing ominously onscreen.
###Chapter 415

Theodore adjusted his cashmere scarf against the autumn chill as he hurried toward Evelyn. His breath came in visible puffs, cheeks flushed from exertion.

Evelyn didn't press for answers immediately. She moved with deliberate grace to the mahogany sideboard.

The crystal decanter caught afternoon light as she poured amber liquid into a tumbler.

"Warm yourself first." She extended the glass. "The wind's particularly biting today."

Their fingers brushed during the exchange. A jolt of warmth traveled up Theodore's arm at the fleeting contact.

"Come sit." Evelyn gestured toward the Chesterfield sofa.

She settled into the cushions, silk robe pooling around her. One fuzzy slipper dangled precariously from her toes.

Theodore cradled the drink, watching the ice cubes swirl. His voice held barely contained energy. "You were correct, Ms. Carter."

He took a steadying breath. "Julian Whitmore and Vivian Prescott share more than a professional relationship."

Evelyn's lips curved without humor. "Even correct assumptions require capable men to substantiate them."

Color rose in Theodore's neck as he unlocked his phone with slightly trembling fingers.

Evelyn scrolled through the gallery with clinical detachment. Each image confirmed Julian's betrayal - intimate café dates, lingering touches, exchanged glances thick with conspiracy.

"We have irrefutable proof now," Theodore said, barely containing his triumph. "Enough to confront him directly."

Evelyn set the device down with deliberate calm. "This merely confirms their affair."

Theodore's brow furrowed. "I obtained their hotel registry through contacts. Weekly meetings for two months - all after Vivian started investigating Monarch Group."

"Circumstantial at best." Evelyn massaged her temples. "You studied law. Without concrete evidence of information exchange..."

Her voice trailed off as she reclined against the cushions. The unspoken truth hung between them - passion could explain away all these encounters.

Theodore's realization dawned slowly. This wasn't merely about identifying a leak. Evelyn intended to dismantle the entire operation and make each participant pay dearly.

"We need evidence of actual data transfer," he conceded.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered shut. "Julian couldn't wait to share news of my new proposal. Monitor Vivian and Cassandra Blackwood instead. Let Julian think he's safe."

She exhaled deeply. "And dig deeper into Vivian's background. I suspect we'll find interesting connections."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

The only sound became Evelyn's even breathing. Theodore turned to find her asleep, lips slightly parted, dark lashes casting shadows on porcelain cheeks.

Exhaustion had finally claimed her.

Kneeling beside the sofa, Theodore fought the impulse to gather her into his arms. His fingers hovered inches from her shoulder before retreating.

Instead, he reached for the cashmere throw draped over a nearby chair. The blanket settled over Evelyn's form with practiced care.

He was her protector, not her lover. That privilege belonged to another man - one worthy of carrying Evelyn Carter across thresholds.

Theodore contented himself with this silent vigil, promising in his heart to straighten her wedding train when the day came.
###Chapter 416

The night stretched endlessly outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathan's study. He sat motionless in his leather armchair, swirling a crystal glass of burgundy liquid.

The wine glass had been a gift from Evelyn months ago - an exquisite Baroque-style piece she'd chosen personally. The delicate chime it made when tapped betrayed its superior quality.

Nathan's fingers tightened around the stem. Had Evelyn imagined their relationship would last forever when she gave him this? The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth that even the finest Bordeaux couldn't mask.

A sharp knock interrupted his brooding. Oliver entered, clutching a manila folder with the urgency of a man bearing vital intelligence.

"I've compiled everything on Vivian Prescott, Mr. Blackwood." Oliver's voice brimmed with confidence. "Down to her grandparents' burial plots. Nothing was overlooked."

After Evelyn's harsh words, Oliver had thrown himself into this investigation with unusual fervor, determined to redeem himself in Nathan's eyes.

"Scan the documents and forward them to Ms. Kingsley." Nathan continued studying the wine's hypnotic swirl under the lamplight.

Oliver hesitated. "Shall I have them delivered to the young madam personally?"

"Email will suffice." Nathan's gaze turned glacial. "Anonymously."

Oliver blinked. "But why—"

"Because," Nathan cut him off, his voice dangerously quiet, "if she sees it's from Blackwood Industries, she'll delete it unread."

The vibrating phone on the coffee table saved Oliver from further questions. Nathan glanced at the screen - Julian Montgomery requesting a video call.

Nathan accepted with a raised eyebrow. "This had better be important."

Julian's ashen face filled the screen, hospital sheets stark white behind him. The blue-tiled walls confirmed Nathan's suspicion - the emergency ward at Kingsley Medical Center.

"Nathan...I'm dying," Julian groaned, his usually vibrant features twisted in agony.

"My condolences." Nathan's expression remained impassive.

"Your sister—" Julian gasped, clutching his IV-laden arm as another wave of pain hit. "Eleanor...does she know anything about poisons?"

Nathan's lips twitched despite himself. Julian sounded like a woman in labor.

"She baked me this godforsaken blueberry mousse," Julian continued between moans. "Ate the whole damn thing. Tasted off, but what was I supposed to do? Refuse?" He shuddered. "Now I've been puking my guts out for six hours straight. Doctors say it's severe food poisoning."

Even the toughest men had their breaking points. Watching Julian writhe in hospital sheets, Nathan decided his sister's baking might qualify as a war crime.
###Chapter 417

The Monarch Group project team regained their spark after the crucial meeting. Motivation surged through them like an electric current.

Evelyn Carter had that magnetic effect - turning employees into devoted followers with her charismatic leadership.

Her briefing today radiated infectious energy.

"Isabella Wang agreed to meet me tonight," she announced, eyes gleaming. "I won't count my chickens before they hatch, but this is our breakthrough moment."

The conference room erupted in cheers.

Only Julian Whitmore remained silent at the far end. His plastered smile couldn't mask the storm brewing beneath.

"We violated contract terms, but Isabella understands business." Evelyn's manicured fingers tapped the mahogany table. "My revised proposal outshines the Blackwoods'. When she sees it, she'll forget our initial missteps."

"Show us, Ms. Kingsley!" someone called out.

Evelyn's smile turned rueful. "After last month's security breach, I'm exercising caution. This isn't about trust - we're under microscopic scrutiny." She straightened her blazer. "As Monarch Grand's CEO, I can't risk another corporate espionage incident."

The team nodded, exchanging eager glances. They practically vibrated with anticipation for their next move.

That evening, Evelyn dined at Éclat while Theodore Winslow organized documents in her office.

The moment Theodore left, Julian slipped inside like a shadow.

Security was unusually lax - his golden opportunity.

Every surveillance camera captured his movements, but desperation overrode caution. Time was running out.

If he didn't secure that proposal tonight, Evelyn might finalize the deal with Isabella. And Vivian Prescott would never get her vengeance.

Love had blinded Julian completely. For Vivian, he'd cross any line - even becoming a criminal.

His phone flashlight cut through the darkness as he combed through Evelyn's meticulously organized space.

The proposal had to be here. Evelyn hadn't left the premises, and Theodore carried no briefcase.

Drawers flew open. File cabinets whispered as he rifled through them. Cold sweat dotted his forehead.

Then - jackpot. The thick dossier lay buried beneath financial reports.

"Got you," Julian breathed, clutching the precious documents. "Vivian, this is for you."

Lights blazed to life.

Theodore stormed in with security, forming an impenetrable circle around Julian.

Julian stood frozen, still gripping the stolen goods. He'd expected eventual exposure - just not this soon.

Security parted like the Red Sea.

Evelyn entered like a queen, her black stilettos clicking ominously. The crimson soles mirrored the fire in her gaze.

Her commanding aura could've toppled empires.

Julian's knees nearly buckled. Fear coiled in his gut.

"Commercial theft carries a three-year sentence minimum." Evelyn's voice could frost glass. "Those papers in your hands? They're your prison sentence."

Theodore's glare could've melted steel. "Trade secret theft? That's three to ten years. Plus financial reparations that'll bankrupt you ten times over."
###Chapter 418

Julian Whitmore staggered backward, his polished shoes catching on the carpet edge.

The evidence is irrefutable. Any last words?

Theodore Winslow's knuckles turned white, veins bulging at the thought of Vivian Prescott's betrayal. His mind conjured violent fantasies of throttling Julian against the mahogany desk.

I stand by my actions.

Though fear coiled in his gut, Julian straightened his tie with trembling fingers. Love made fools of brave men. I leaked the proposal. Sold the details to Spotlight News. Every accusation is true.

His loyalty to Vivian remained unshaken.

Theodore's fist twitched, itching to smash Julian's smug defiance.

Clear the room. Theodore, Julian—stay. Evelyn Carter's command sliced through the tension like a scalpel.

Security filed out in synchronized silence.

Let's speak frankly, Julian.

Evelyn selected a truffle from the crystal dish, unwrapping it with deliberate slowness. The proposal was bait. Empty pages after the cover sheet. Ada Laurent and I never met.

Julian's breath hitched. Impossible!

Amused, Evelyn tossed him the folder. See for yourself.

Sweat soaked Julian's collar as he flipped through blank parchment. His confession now echoed in Theodore's phone recording.

A masterful trap.

How?!

Julian slammed the folder, decorum shattered. He needed answers before handcuffs clicked around his wrists.

Monarch Grand Hotels have tighter security than Fort Knox.

Evelyn's teeth sank into dark chocolate. The first leak confirmed my suspicions. Surveillance rotated on every team member. You played it smart—no contact with Vivian. But greed has a distinct scent.

You know about us? Julian's voice cracked.

Theodore snorted. Ms. Kingsley knows everything.

Julian's shoulders slumped.

The Kingsley heiress wielded power like a scythe. Vivian couldn't hide from that kind of reach.

Ten years at Monarch, Julian. Flawless event executions. You were weeks away from heading the Planning Department.

Evelyn's disappointment cut deeper than anger.

Julian flinched.

Was throwing away your career worth becoming Vivian's pawn?

Every sacrifice! Julian lunged forward, eyes wild.

Theodore blocked him instantly.

Evelyn didn't blink.

Vivian's father rots in prison because of you! Julian spat. She lost everything! You think losing one deal balances the scales? You deserve worse than bankruptcy—you deserve hell!

The air crackled with venom.

Evelyn merely reached for another truffle.

###Chapter 419

Nathan lashed out at Evelyn as if she had murdered his beloved grandmother.

Theodore's face flushed crimson, but Evelyn remained unfazed. She merely arched a brow and smirked. "Tsk. Fascinating."

"What did you just say?" Nathan snapped, his composure crumbling.

"I said Vivian Prescott is fascinating," Evelyn clarified, reaching for another piece of chocolate.

Theodore suppressed a fond smile as he noted the dwindling supply of sweets.

"You've known Vivian for barely two months, yet she's already got you dancing to her tune," Evelyn mused. "Willing to throw away your career, defy the elite—all for her sake."

She tilted her head, amused. "I ought to take notes from Ms. Prescott."

"Don't you dare insult Vivian!" Nathan exploded. "You're the one who thinks money makes you untouchable! If it weren't for you, Vivian would still have her family's support! You destroyed her!"

His voice cracked with rage. "People like you—wealthy, entitled—you're the poison in this world!"

Theodore frowned. Why was Evelyn indulging this delusional fool when she could simply hand him over to the authorities?

"By all means, vent your grievances," Evelyn said coolly. "I won't stop you. My father endured worse—slander, even assassination attempts—yet he thrived. Power and wealth have their perks."

Her gaze turned glacial. "But you crossed a line by sabotaging my family's business. Did you really think I wouldn't retaliate?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "I reward loyalty. But those who betray me? They don't fare well."

Nathan shuddered, a cold dread creeping up his spine.

Evelyn's presence alone was suffocating.

"Since you're so desperate for answers, I'll enlighten you," she continued.

"Vivian never loved you. She used you because you worked for Monarch Group."

"Lies!" Nathan howled, his voice raw. "Stop twisting the truth! I helped Vivian get justice! She wouldn't—she couldn't—"

Evelyn ignored his outburst and nodded at Theodore. "Turn on the screen."

The television flickered to life, revealing explicit images—Vivian entangled with Timothy Windsor, the director of Spotlight News.

Theodore's jaw dropped.

He had investigated Vivian, but this? This wasn't in his report.

"No! It's fake!" Nathan clawed at his hair, his eyes wild. "Those photos are doctored! That's not her!"

His heart shattered as he stared at Vivian's coy smile, her arms draped around the older man. There was no coercion—only betrayal.

Evelyn remained impassive. "The evidence speaks for itself."

Theodore gagged and averted his gaze.

"They've been meeting like this for over a year," Evelyn added. "Would you like to see the videos?"

"No!" Nathan collapsed to his knees, his anguished sobs echoing through the room.

Theodore leaned in, whispering, "Where did you get these, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn's expression didn't waver. "Later."

"Why... why would she do this to me?" Nathan choked out between tears.

"She used the information you gave her for revenge—and for personal gain," Theodore muttered, eyeing Nathan with pity.

"Personal gain?"

"You were a pawn, Nathan. Someone else paid her to manipulate you."
###Chapter 420

Evelyn tilted her head, resting her elbow on the desk with a knowing smirk. "How do you think she managed to get close to you so fast? She miraculously discovered the contract's loophole. Do you honestly believe she could pull that off alone?"

Julian Whitmore's shoulders shook with silent sobs, his face buried in his hands.

He didn't regret destroying his career. What gutted him was realizing Vivian Prescott had played him from the start - the woman he'd foolishly believed was his soulmate.

"Ms. Carter... I'll tell you everything."

Under Evelyn's relentless interrogation, Julian confessed how Vivian had instructed him to steal Monarch Group's trade secrets.

Theodore Winslow documented every damning admission.

Though Julian was taken into custody, his arrest wasn't made public. As Monarch Grand Hotels' legal consultant, Theodore filed charges for corporate espionage quietly.

With the pawn captured, it was time to confront the queen.

Evelyn surveyed her immaculate desk with amusement. "A thief with manners. I should thank him for tidying up after rifling through my things."

Theodore frowned. "Ms. Carter, you still haven't explained—"

"Nathan sent the photos."

Theodore's eyebrows shot up. "Nathan Blackwood? Our competitor? Why would he help you?"

"Probably furious that Penelope and Cassandra stole his Westridge project." Evelyn's lips curled. "He's using me to get back at Cassandra."

Her mind flashed to that night in Cliffside Manor when Nathan had gently dried her hair. She scoffed, pushing away the memory. "I'd sooner believe in ghosts than think that man has my best interests at heart. Sending anonymous emails? Please. Did he really think I wouldn't recognize his handiwork?"

The Hacking Princess didn't earn her title by accident.

"Now that we've dealt with our mole, how do you plan to handle Vivian Gordon?" Theodore asked warily. "Even with Julian's testimony, we lack concrete evidence against her."

Evelyn's eyes glinted dangerously at the compromising photos on her screen. "Send these to the director's wife."

"The woman holds a black belt in taekwondo, Ms. Carter," Theodore noted with interest.

"Perfect. She's got a live practice dummy now." Evelyn reached into Theodore's pocket, fishing for chocolate. "I dealt with her father. Let someone else handle the daughter."

"Otherwise I'd be the villainous tycoon from daytime dramas."

Theodore trapped her wandering hand against his jacket. "Easy on the sweets, Ms. Carter. Your dentist will revolt."

Meanwhile at Blackwood Industries, Nathan remained in his office well past working hours, awaiting Ian's update.

When Ian finally arrived, his excitement was palpable. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter has apprehended the spy in her company. He's in custody now."

Nathan exhaled, tension leaving his shoulders. "Good."

"Do you think she used the information you provided?"

"It doesn't matter if she did." Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "I merely gave her an optional advantage."

"I have every confidence she could've handled it alone."

He'd consistently underestimated his ex-wife.

Nathan used to consider Evelyn a dull, unremarkable housewife whose sole talent was cooking.

Now he recognized his own staggering blindness.
###Chapter 421

The memories were too painful for Nathan Blackwood to revisit.

His intercom buzzed sharply. Nathan answered on speakerphone. "What is it?"

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Carter's assistant is here to see you. He doesn't have an appointment. Should I—"

"Send him in," Nathan commanded coldly.

Getting an audience with the CEO of Blackwood Industries was no small feat.

But Theodore Winslow worked for Evelyn, so Nathan made an exception.

Within minutes, Theodore strode into the office with a stony expression.

"Ms. Carter instructed me to deliver this, Mr. Blackwood."

He placed a pristine white box on Nathan's mahogany desk.

"What is it?" Nathan eyed the box without raising his head.

"A ticking time bomb," Theodore deadpanned.

Nathan's lips thinned.

"You think you're clever?"

Theodore's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Why ask if you won't believe me? It's perfectly harmless. Just accept Ms. Carter's... thoughtful gift."

With measured movements, Nathan lifted the lid.

Indeed, no explosives. Just an absurdly cute dog-shaped cream cake staring back at him.

His lips twitched.

"Did Evelyn bake this?" Hope flickered behind his guarded eyes.

Theodore scoffed. "Dream on. She had me purchase it specially for you." His smirk widened. "Did you honestly think you deserved her cooking?"

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"What's that supposed to mean? Ms. Carter cooked for Mr. Blackwood before. If he wasn't worthy, why would she endure it for three years?" Oliver snapped.

Theodore gave Nathan a withering look. "Evelyn Carter would sooner feed stray dogs than cook for you again."

Oliver clenched his fists. "Take that back!"

"Enough," Nathan cut in sharply. "Why did Evelyn send this?"

Theodore's expression turned glacial. "Ms. Carter received your anonymous delivery. Consider this her... reciprocation."

Nathan froze. She'd figured it out already?

"She's reminding you not to underestimate her. She's nobody's fool and doesn't need your... canine counsel."

Without ceremony, Theodore turned on his heel and strode out.

"Canine counsel? I hope she wasn't referring to you." Oliver muttered.

Nathan's darkening expression made Oliver pale and retreat to the corner.
###Chapter 422

The dim hotel room lights flickered as Vivian Prescott lay tangled in the sheets with Gregory Thornton.

She had made this compromise too many times - trading her dignity for career advancement at Spotlight News.

The sudden crash of the door slamming open made them both jump.

"Ah!"

Vivian scrambled off the older man, clutching the silk sheets to her bare chest.

Gregory, the director of Spotlight News, fumbled for his discarded shirt with trembling hands. His face drained of color when he saw who stood in the doorway.

"M-Margaret?"

"So this is the slut you've been fucking, Gregory?"

Margaret Thornton's towering 5'9" frame filled the doorway, her muscular arms crossed over her designer blazer. The former collegiate athlete made ordinary women look fragile in comparison.

With a contemptuous snort, Margaret shrugged off her jacket, revealing biceps that could rival most men's.

"I expected better taste from you. What could possibly attract you to this...mediocrity?"

Before Vivian could react, Margaret lunged forward, yanking her out of bed by her bleached blonde hair.

The sound of flesh meeting flesh echoed through the room as Margaret delivered five brutal slaps that left Vivian's face swollen and bleeding.

Each strike released years of pent-up rage in Margaret.

"Gregory! Help me! Please!" Vivian screamed through split lips.

But Gregory cowered in the corner, shaking like a leaf in a storm.

Margaret's assistant Lydia Chambers entered with two hulking bodyguards in tow.

"Come quick everyone! See the homewrecking whore who dared seduce my boss's husband!" Lydia announced cheerfully, raising her phone to capture every humiliating moment.

The live stream began immediately, flooding social media with the scandalous scene.

Vivian and Gregory could only stare in horror.

"On your knees, Gregory!" Margaret commanded.

Her husband dropped instantly, forehead pressed to the carpet.

"That failed investment would have ruined you if not for my family's money. Every luxury you enjoy comes from my trust fund!"

Margaret delivered a savage kick to his face as the live stream comments exploded with cheering emojis.

"Now that you're successful, you betray me? Remember - you're nothing without me!"

"Nothing...I'm nothing..." Gregory whimpered, his professional persona shattered.

Vivian crawled forward, tears streaking her ruined makeup. She couldn't comprehend how their two-year affair had been exposed.

The bodyguards took turns beating Gregory while Margaret focused on Vivian. A vicious backhand sent one of Vivian's veneers skittering across the floor.

Lydia wisely ended the live stream before the dental work flew.

By the end, Gregory was dragged out semi-conscious, still shirtless and bleeding.

Vivian curled into a fetal position, her face a mosaic of scratches, her expensive extensions torn out in clumps.

"Confused about how I found out, slut?" Margaret loomed over her. "You brought this on yourself. Think hard about who you've crossed recently."

The name came to Vivian in a flash of terror.

"Evelyn Carter...it has to be Evelyn!"

Her phone buzzed ominously on the nightstand.

With trembling fingers, Vivian opened the new email attachment - a voice recording.

Henry Whitmore's voice filled the room, detailing how Vivian had seduced him into stealing Monarch Grand Hotels' wedding planning proposal.

The recording ended with a single, damning sentence: "This was all Vivian Prescott's idea."

The phone slipped from her bloodied fingers as reality crashed down.
###Chapter 423

Evelyn's phone slipped from her fingers.

Her legs gave out beneath her as she collapsed onto the cold marble floor. The world she knew had just imploded.

Meanwhile, Cassandra luxuriated in her nightly routine. The warm bathwater lapped at her skin as she applied her expensive skincare products before the vanity mirror.

Ever since Julian had issued his ultimatum, an unshakable tension had settled in Cassandra's bones. Sleep had become an elusive stranger.

What was so special about that simpleton anyway? Why did Evelyn keep defending Eleanor? Why did Julian take her side?

"That conniving little actress," Cassandra spat.

Her manicured fingers snatched up a lipstick. With violent strokes, she scrawled Eleanor's name across the mirror before obliterating it with angry slashes. "You're not worth my time now. Just wait until I take control of the Blackwood Hotel—"

Her phone's shrill ringtone shattered the moment.

Seeing Isabelle's name flash across the screen, Cassandra's face twisted in disgust before smoothing into a practiced smile. "Darling Isabelle, what a surprise. Calling so late?"

"We have a serious problem!"

Isabelle's hushed voice carried an edge of panic. "The mole on Evelyn's team has been exposed. The police already have him in custody."

"What? How?" Cassandra's grip tightened on her phone. "And Vivian?"

"You haven't seen? Vivian and her boss got caught in bed during a live broadcast tonight. The wife walked in and streamed everything. They didn't even have time to cover themselves. The internet's having a field day."

Cassandra's mind went blank.

Her carefully constructed world collapsed between one breath and the next.

"Delete all your communications with Vivian before the police trace them back to you," Isabelle warned grimly.

"Understood."

Another call beeped through—her personal assistant.

"Hold on, Isabelle." She switched lines. "Report."

"It's bad news, Ms. Blackwood."

Her assistant's voice trembled. "Ms. Prescott was in a car accident near Hawthorne Boulevard. She's unconscious and in critical condition."

"Perfect timing." Relief flooded Cassandra's voice.

"Excuse me?"

"With the mole caught, it was only a matter of time before Evelyn connected everything to Vivian and us. This accident couldn't have come at a better moment."

Cassandra's eyes glinted with cold calculation. "She served her purpose by ruining Evelyn's deal with Isabella. Now it's time for her exit. A hospital bed will keep her conveniently silent."

Meanwhile, Evelyn had already received news of Vivian's accident.

She was selecting a vintage bottle from the wine cellar Sebastian had designed for her, planning a nightcap.

"The accident happened when Vivian lost focus while driving. I suppose that livestream scandal affected her more than she let on." Theodore steadied the ladder as Evelyn reached for a bottle.

"She made her choices. A woman with her looks didn't need to sell herself so cheaply." Evelyn's tone remained detached.

"Margaret certainly didn't hold back." Theodore shook his head. "Serves as a warning to other women eyeing married men."

Evelyn's marriage had crumbled when Victoria stole her husband.

Though Nathan had never loved her during their three years together, that gave Victoria no right to trample on Evelyn's dignity and insert herself between husband and wife.

"With the pawns eliminated, shall we focus on the queen, Ms. Carter?" Theodore's gaze held unspoken meaning.
###Chapter 424

"Decant the Lafite, Theodore." Evelyn Carter frowned and turned away with her phone clutched tightly in her hand.

Theodore Winslow's heart ached. He knew that look—she needed space, and he had learned to respect it, even when it pained him.

"I know what you're thinking," Evelyn said, her voice softer now. She turned back to him with a knowing smile. "You assume I despise Nathan because of our failed marriage. But we're not enemies, Theo."

She reached out, giving his shoulder a reassuring pat. "If I want to establish Monarch Group in Crestview and expand our reach, I'm bound to cross paths with him. I'm just being pragmatic."

"But Ms. Carter—"

"What's there to fear?" She cut him off with a dismissive wave. "Are you worried he'll try something? Maxwell would put a bullet in him before Nathan even got the chance." Her laugh was light, almost careless.

Theodore swallowed hard. No, that's not it at all. His thoughts burned with unspoken devotion. I would lay down my life for you without hesitation. What terrifies me is the thought of you falling for him again. I couldn't bear to watch you walk back into that heartbreak.

With a heavy sigh, he took the bottle of wine and retreated, leaving her to the silence of the room.

The phone in Evelyn's palm buzzed insistently—persistent, just like Nathan Blackwood himself.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice was cool, detached, the way it always was with him now.

"Thank you for the cake. It was delicious."

Her breath hitched. Shadows flickered beneath her lashes as she clenched her jaw.

The night was still.

Nathan's voice, low and rough, curled around her like smoke. Once, she had craved the sound of it, dialing his number just to hear him speak, even when he was indifferent. She used to roll in bed, giddy with the thrill of his attention.

Now, it meant nothing.

She prided herself on discipline—on cutting ties with anything that could weaken her, even love.

"You're welcome," she replied, her tone icy. "Consider it a reminder to keep your opinions to yourself and stay out of my affairs."

"I wasn't interfering."

Nathan's voice darkened. "Your business is my business."

Evelyn scoffed. "Of course. You need me to put Cassandra in her place. If she secures the GM position at Blackwood Hotel, your dear stepmother might get ambitious again. And then where would you be?"

Nathan's expression soured.

Once, when she was still Evelyn Carter, she had put him above everything—tender, devoted, his in every way.

Now, her words were knives, and every conversation was a battlefield of schemes and power plays.

Yet, he couldn't let go. Not when she was the only woman who had ever made his heart bleed.

Pride meant nothing compared to her.

"Evelyn," he said, voice steady, "do you really think I care about Penelope and Cassandra? They can't touch me. If they could, I wouldn't have held my position this long."

He hesitated, something unspoken lingering between them.

Evelyn's fists tightened, knuckles white. "Stay out of my way, Nathan. As one ex to another—this is your only warning. When I'm angry, I don't care who gets caught in the crossfire. Things will get messy."

"Don't hold back on my account."

His voice was a whisper against her ear, even through the phone. "I can't promise much, but know this—no one will stand against you as long as I lead Blackwood Industries."
###Chapter 425

Evelyn's brows knitted together. The words tasted like honey-laced poison, the sickly sweetness barely masking the bitter deception beneath.

Silence stretched between them.

Neither spoke.

Nathan was the first to break the tension, clearing his throat abruptly. "I think that's enough for tonight. Goodnight."

"Wait, you—"

The line went dead before Evelyn could finish.

What the hell just happened? She stared at the darkened screen, fingers tightening around her phone.

On the other end, Nathan exhaled sharply, his pulse hammering. His palms were damp, his throat parched.

Eyes closed, he muttered under his breath, "People who leave don't stay. But the ones who haunt my thoughts? That's a different kind of trouble."

Vivian Prescott remained comatose after the devastating accident.

Cassandra Blackwood had learned from the doctors that the chances of Vivian ever waking were nearly nonexistent.

Luck was on her side.

Otherwise, Cassandra would have had a much harder time covering up the fact that she had bribed Vivian for insider details about the Monarch Grand Hotels contract.

Even so, Cassandra was making no progress with Isabella Laurent.

Isabella had made it clear—she wouldn’t sign with Blackwood Hotel unless Nathan was directly involved. Worse, Isabella’s team was already scouting other luxury hotels, meaning Blackwood wasn’t even guaranteed as a backup option.

That afternoon, Cassandra stormed into the Montgomery estate.

While she fumed, Isabelle Montgomery remained perfectly composed, sipping her afternoon tea with practiced elegance.

"Do you have a plan to secure Isabella’s signature?" Cassandra demanded.

Isabelle set her cup down. "She demanded Blackwood Industries and Monarch Group present her with a rare gem, didn’t she? Nathan’s been chasing after Alexa’s pieces, but even his trip abroad didn’t land him one."

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Isabelle’s eyes.

"That’s exactly why Evelyn won her over at the wedding with that brooch," Cassandra spat, frustration boiling over. "If I just had one of Alexa’s pieces, this wouldn’t be an issue!"

"You do," Isabelle said smoothly.

Cassandra froze. "What?"

Isabelle arched a brow. "Who said you don’t own one?"

Cassandra’s pulse jumped. "Isabelle, what are you saying? Did you—"

"Alexa’s a ghost. No one’s seen her face. No one’s even sure if she’s real." Isabelle leaned in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "So why not have a replica made?"

Cassandra recoiled. "A fake? You want me to hand Isabella a counterfeit?"

Isabelle smirked. "Who’s going to know? Even experts struggle to authenticate paintings at auctions, let alone gemstones. The only person who could call you out is Alexa herself."

She paused, then added, "I studied in Valmont. There’s a jeweler there—an old apprentice of Alexa’s. He could recreate one of her designs for you. Once Isabella sees it, she’ll sign without hesitation."

Cassandra hesitated.

But time was running out.

Sometimes, you had to gamble.
###Chapter 426

Camille Kingsley's birthday was approaching.

Evelyn Carter threw herself into her demanding work at the jewelry studio during the day.

At night, she locked herself in her private workshop, meticulously crafting a gift for Camille.

She designed a stunning ring—18K gold, adorned with a flawless aquamarine and dazzling diamonds.

For a master jeweler like Evelyn, the craftsmanship was effortless.

But the aquamarine was extraordinary—massive, with unparalleled clarity, rivaling the rarest gemstones in the world.

Evelyn never cut corners when it came to gifts for family. She poured her heart into every detail.

Nathan Blackwood had once been the recipient of her thoughtful presents.

Yet, the man had never appreciated her gestures.

Her phone buzzed on the workbench. A video call from Giselle Dubois, her studio’s chief assistant.

"You only call this late if it’s urgent," Evelyn remarked, not pausing as she polished the gemstone.

"Do you remember Tristan Moreau?" Giselle asked.

"Of course. He trained under me for three years before branching out on his own. Talented, with an impeccable eye for detail. What about him?"

"Two days ago, someone approached him with a request—to replicate one of your signature pieces. Can you believe the audacity? The market is already flooded with knockoffs of your designs."

Evelyn merely chuckled, her fingers still working deftly. "No need to be angry. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If people can’t afford the real thing, they settle for fakes to feed their vanity."

"Tristan couldn’t reach you, so he came to me. He refused the job—obviously. He wouldn’t dare insult you by counterfeiting your work."

Giselle sounded furious on Evelyn’s behalf.

Evelyn’s curiosity piqued. "Who commissioned the forgery? It takes serious connections to track down my former apprentice."

"Tristan didn’t say how they met. But the client is an heiress from Crestview—a Montgomery, I believe."

Evelyn’s hands stilled for a brief second.

"Interesting. She’s also a student of Sebastian Laurent, the renowned pianist."

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn’s lips.

Ah. So that’s how it was.

If Cassandra Blackwood and Isabelle Montgomery were asking for trouble, Evelyn wouldn’t deny them.

"Giselle, tell Tristan to take the job." Evelyn’s eyes gleamed with mischief.

"What? Why?"

"He’d better make it convincing. I won’t tolerate shoddy imitations."

Five days later, Nathan Blackwood received unexpected news the moment he stepped out of a board meeting.

Isabella Laurent, who had been unresponsive for weeks, had suddenly agreed to the deal.

Nathan’s expression darkened as he stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his presence icy.

"What’s the catch?"

His assistant hesitated. "I’m not sure, sir. But Isabella is a discerning collector. She wouldn’t accept a counterfeit."

"Evelyn must know by now," Nathan murmured, his gaze distant.

With Cassandra securing the deal, Nathan knew he’d be dragged into a storm of corporate warfare—far worse than anything Evelyn faced.

Yet, his thoughts remained consumed by Evelyn. His own troubles barely registered.

Giving up? Impossible.

Nathan exhaled sharply, tension coiling in his shoulders.

Others might surrender, but Evelyn wasn’t one to back down. She was biding her time. He knew she had a plan.

Cassandra was no match for his brilliant ex-wife.

Ex-wife.

The word sent an unexpected pang through his chest.
###Chapter 427

The Blackwood family gathered at Moonlight Cove for their monthly dinner with Reginald.

For once, they appeared united. Even Cassandra poured Eleanor a drink, urging her to eat more as if they were the closest of sisters.

Eleanor sat beside Nathan, keeping her head down and focusing on her meal without engaging in conversation.

Though socially reserved, Eleanor had her pride.

She neither accepted Cassandra's drink nor acknowledged her.

"Father, Penelope and I have reached a decision," Leonard began, sitting with impeccable posture, every inch the refined gentleman. "We wanted to share it with you and hear your thoughts."

"If you've already decided, why bother telling me?"

Reginald didn’t look up from his plate. "Can't your wife handle it? She’s always been your advisor—that’s how you’ve managed all these years."

Penelope’s smile tightened, malice flickering in her eyes.

Every month, she dreaded this dinner with the old man and his biting remarks. The night before, she barely slept.

She counted the days until fate would finally silence him.

Leonard cleared his throat, frowning as he squeezed Penelope’s hand under the table. "Cassandra is at the perfect age for marriage. We should start considering her future."

Cassandra pressed her lips together, cheeks flushing.

"Marriage?"

Reginald set down his fork, brow furrowing. "She’s only twenty-five. Too young. I want my granddaughters to stay with me for at least two more years before rushing into anything."

Leonard fell silent.

"Besides, our girls won’t lack suitors. Even at fifty-two, men would still be lining up for them."

Reginald eyed Leonard suspiciously. "Don’t tell me Blackwood Industries is in trouble and you’re planning to sell her off for a business alliance."

"You misunderstand, Father. The company is fine," Penelope interjected with a forced smile.

"Let me make one thing clear, Leonard." Reginald’s voice turned sharp. "I won’t allow you to trade your daughter for profit. I don’t care if Blackwood Industries collapses tomorrow—marriage for business is unacceptable. Understood?"

"Oh, Grandfather, you’re overreacting."

Cassandra clung to Reginald’s arm, swaying playfully. "Mother and Father only want what’s best for me. This has nothing to do with business. I feel ready to marry."

"Ready?" Reginald blinked in surprise. Cassandra nodded demurely.

Time was passing too quickly.

"You’ve got it all wrong, Father. We didn’t pressure her," Penelope said, beaming. "Cassandra wants this. She’s already set her heart on someone."

Reginald raised an eyebrow. "Oh? And who might that be?"

"You know him."

Leonard smiled. "It’s Julian, Father."

Nathan continued eating slowly, his expression unreadable—though a storm brewed behind his eyes.

"Julian? Julian Montgomery?" Reginald’s eyes widened.

Penelope nodded. "That’s right."

Clang.

The sudden noise drew everyone’s attention.

Eleanor had dropped her silverware.

In a family like the Blackwoods, where etiquette was sacred, such clumsiness was unforgivable.

"I—I’m sorry."

Pale-faced, Eleanor scrambled to pick it up, but Nathan leaned down and retrieved it for her.

"Don’t worry. Just ask for a new set." His gentle smile eased her embarrassment.

"Th-Thank you, Nathan," Eleanor whispered, lowering her head.

Cassandra’s eyes narrowed dangerously, a smirk playing on her lips.
###Chapter 428

"Eleanor, how could you be so careless with your silverware during dinner with Grandfather? Have you forgotten all your etiquette?" Penelope scolded Eleanor with visible disapproval.

"That's quite enough. It's merely a dropped fork. Must you berate the child so harshly?" Reginald immediately came to his granddaughter's defense, his protective instincts flaring.

Beneath the table, Penelope's fingers curled into tight fists. It seemed even her breathing offended the old patriarch these days.

"Grandfather, Father, Mother... I've finished my meal."

Eleanor kept her gaze lowered, cheeks burning with humiliation as she bit her lip and hurried from the dining room.

Nathan watched his half-sister's retreating figure with a contemplative expression, his drink momentarily forgotten.

Cassandra barely concealed her satisfaction at seeing Eleanor humiliated.

"You should have remained your usual silent self, Eleanor. This embarrassment is what you get for daring to approach Julian. Know your place - see who our parents truly favor, and who deserves to stand beside Julian Montgomery!"

"Julian?" Reginald blinked in confusion. "I was under the impression he was interested in Evelyn."

Leonard, Penelope, and Cassandra all winced at the blunt observation.

Nathan choked on his whiskey, coughing violently as he gripped his crystal tumbler.

"Why would Julian be interested in Evelyn, Grandfather?" Cassandra's face flushed crimson with outrage.

"Doesn't he favor Evelyn? I may be eighty, but I'm not blind. Julian couldn't keep his eyes off Evelyn during my birthday gala. The man clearly has a devoted nature when he finds the right woman."

As he spoke, Reginald cast a meaningful glance at Nathan, who scowled darkly. "Since Julian shows such interest, I considered introducing him properly to Evelyn. The Montgomerys move in the same circles as the Kingsleys. More importantly, Julian genuinely cares for Evelyn. I believe he could provide her with an excellent life."

An excellent life? As if Julian and Evelyn would ever have that together.

Nathan's grip tightened on his glass until his knuckles turned white.

Though Reginald never mentioned Nathan by name, the pointed remarks struck their intended target with precision.

Julian had been sowing wild oats since sixteen and couldn't keep his pants zipped, yet Reginald had the audacity to suggest matching him with Evelyn? Some observational skills.

Nathan had no words.

"Am I your granddaughter or is Evelyn, Grandfather?" Cassandra's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Julian loves me, not her. You should be supporting my happiness!"

"You may fancy Julian, but does he return your affections?" Reginald asked pointedly.

"I... He..." Cassandra floundered for a response.

"I observed Julian's behavior toward you at the celebration. You exchanged no words, and he barely glanced in your direction."

Humiliation burned through Cassandra as she clenched her jaw.

The painful truth left her no room for argument.

"Our family doesn't require marriages of convenience, but neither should our women throw themselves at uninterested men. Forced matches never end well."

Reginald shook his head skeptically. "Besides, your temperaments clash terribly. Julian has a fiery disposition - I can only imagine the explosive arguments if you married."

"Grandfather!" Cassandra's eyes welled with angry tears.

"What answer do you expect from Cassandra, Father? She's a young woman - have some consideration for her feelings," Leonard interjected smoothly. "Julian does have feelings for Cassandra. He came by the manor just last week specifically to speak with her. Penelope and I witnessed it ourselves."

As Cassandra recalled Julian's actual words that day, her stomach twisted.

She knew Julian couldn't stand her, but what did that matter?

With her family's full support behind the match, Cassandra believed she could eventually make Julian fall for her. Given time, he would surely succumb to her charms.
###Chapter 429

Reginald stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Oh? Is that so?"

"Absolutely."

Penelope quickly came to Cassandra's defense. "A gentleman like Julian wouldn't visit a lady at her home without good reason. He must have developed feelings for her if he sought her out. Circumstances may have been different back then, but things have changed now."

She shot a pointed look at Nathan. "Besides, you might be scheming to pair Ms. Kingsley with Julian, but last I heard, she's already moved on with someone else."

Nathan's gaze turned icy as it locked onto Penelope.

His jaw tightened, and he swallowed hard, as if forcing down a surge of emotion.

Reginald raised an eyebrow. "Evelyn has a boyfriend? Who?"

"Alexander Whitmore, the youngest son of Whitmore Enterprises' chairman," Penelope replied smugly.

She had gotten the information from Victoria.

Cassandra had casually mentioned that Evelyn still kept in touch with Alexander.

Penelope didn’t care if it was true—her priority was stopping the old man from playing matchmaker.

"Evelyn and Alexander aren’t together," Nathan snapped.

Unable to contain himself any longer, he slammed his fist on the table with a resounding thud. His expression darkened dangerously.

"I heard they’ve been on multiple dates," Penelope continued, undeterred. "Strolling through the rose gardens, attending the symphony—"

"I said, they are not together."

Nathan’s furious glare pinned her in place. "I suggest you verify your information before spreading baseless rumors."

His voice was low, laced with warning. "Evelyn is a lady—the heiress of Monarch Group and the general manager of Monarch Grand Hotels. Your careless words could tarnish her reputation."

Penelope’s face twisted in outrage.

"Nathan! Is that any way to speak to your elders? How dare you—"

Before Leonard could finish, Nathan pushed back his chair and stood abruptly. "I’m done with dinner. Enjoy yours."

Reginald narrowed his eyes as Nathan stormed out.

Frustrated, Nathan loosened his tie and strode into the garden, desperate for fresh air.

Ever since Reginald had brought up pairing Julian with Evelyn, Nathan had been on edge.

But when Penelope claimed Evelyn was with Alexander? That had nearly suffocated him.

His chest tightened as reality crashed over him.

With a grimace, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it, inhaling deeply.

The bitter taste did nothing to soothe his rising agitation.

He yanked out his phone and dialed Julian.

"To what do I owe this unexpected call, Nathan?" Julian’s voice was lazy, tinged with amusement. "You haven’t visited since my food poisoning incident. Don’t tell me you’ve found someone else."

"I have news for you."

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Leonard and Penelope are planning to marry Evelyn off to you."

On the other end, Julian bolted upright. "What the hell? Keep your family drama to yourselves! Why drag me into this mess?"

Nathan smirked coldly. "You always said it didn’t matter who you married—that she’d just be eye candy. What’s wrong with Evelyn? She likes you, and a marriage alliance with Monarch Group would only strengthen your position."

"Yeah, I said that, but—"

"But nothing. She can’t outsmart you anyway." Nathan took another drag.

Julian groaned. "You know exactly what kind of woman Evelyn is. Don’t play Cupid and throw me into misery."

Nathan’s grip on the cigarette tightened. "Misery loves company."

Julian didn’t deserve Evelyn.

And Alexander? Absolutely not.

Nathan gritted his teeth, resentment burning through him.

All he wanted was to keep Evelyn close—to shield her from every potential rival.
###Chapter 430

The counterfeit Evelyn jewelry Cassandra obtained from Isabelle worked like magic.

Her heart pounded as she prepared to present the piece to Isabella as a gift, terrified of being exposed.

But Cassandra had already devised an escape plan. If caught, she'd claim she'd been duped by a friend due to her limited jewelry expertise.

Evelyn's apprentice must have perfected the craftsmanship because Isabella showed no suspicion. The star immediately adorned herself with the necklace, refusing to remove it.

Ultimately, Isabella signed the contract with Cassandra.

That wasn't all. With Penelope's glowing recommendation, Leonard finally brought Cassandra into the company's inner circle, promoting her to senior management where she could attend executive meetings.

That evening, mother and daughter celebrated on the terrace with champagne.

"Your father will transfer the hotel's management to you after Isabella's wedding," Penelope murmured, eyes gleaming with ambition. "Make a powerful impression, darling. Soon you'll join the board, and that's when we'll eliminate Nathan."

She embraced her daughter, visions of triumph sparkling in her gaze. "I can't rely on your sister, but my future rests in your capable hands."

"Don't worry, Mother," Cassandra declared, clinking her glass. "When I take control, the Blackwood empire will be ours."

A knock interrupted them.

"Madam Whitmore, Ms. Blackwood," the butler announced, "an invitation has arrived."

Exchanging glances, they stepped inside.

"From whom?" Cassandra demanded.

"Mr. Pembroke, personal secretary to Monarch Grand Hotels' general manager."

"Monarch Grand?" Could it be from Evelyn?

Taking the envelope, Penelope dismissed the servant. Inside were two invitations to a charity jewelry auction.

Her lips thinned, expression unreadable.

"Mother, we haven't heard from Evelyn in weeks. Why these sudden invitations? Could this be a trap?"

Penelope scoffed. "We've nothing to fear. Isabella's contract is signed and sealed."

The evening news flashed across the television, featuring the charity event.

"The organizer is Éclat magazine!" Cassandra gasped, pointing at the screen. "That iconic fashion bible every celebrity dreams of gracing. Evelyn's collaborating with Éclat? Unbelievable! And Isabella's attending!"

While Cassandra had expected Monarch to crumble after losing Isabella, Evelyn had secured this prestigious partnership. She always landed on her feet.

Jealousy burned through Cassandra, her nails biting into her palms.

"A grand event won't change her defeat," Penelope sneered. "Declining would look petty. I'll attend - that girl doesn't intimidate me."

"We can monitor her too," Cassandra added. "Ensure she doesn't sabotage our deal with Isabella."

Meanwhile, Evelyn enjoyed cocktails with Éclat's editor-in-chief, conversing fluently in French.

Changing into form-fitting athletic wear for kayaking, she rushed downstairs when Sebastian arrived.

"Seb!"

She leaped into his arms. The muscular man caught her effortlessly. Her curves pressed against him through the clinging fabric, creating an electrifying intimacy.
###Chapter 431

Sebastian's brows knitted together. "Evelyn. Are you seriously thinking about exercising now?"

"Yes, Bash. I'm feeling energized, so I thought I'd take the kayak out on the river behind the estate." She beamed up at him, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"It's pitch black outside. What if you capsize? You barely passed your swimming test last summer." Sebastian's voice carried a protective edge as he gave her waist a gentle pinch. "And have you checked the temperature? It's below freezing in that ridiculous outfit."

His sharp gaze shifted to Theodore. "She only listens to you. How could you let her even consider this?"

"My apologies, Mr. Kingsley. I should have been more firm." Theodore dipped his head in acknowledgment.

"Stop scolding Theo, Bash." Evelyn tugged her brother's sleeve. "He did warn me, but I insisted."

The siblings settled onto the plush sofa, fingers intertwined. Evelyn rested her head against Sebastian's broad shoulder. "The editor-in-chief of Éclat just finalized all the event details with me. Thank you for arranging this incredible opportunity. Éclat was my childhood bible - every issue fueled my fashion dreams."

Vivienne Laurent of Éclat was a living legend, the Miranda Priestly of their generation. Industry insiders knew a single disapproving glance from her could make or break designers during fashion week.

Yet this titan had personally called Evelyn to discuss the charity gala.

No one needed to know how her hands had trembled during that call, though her voice remained perfectly composed.

"As long as it makes you happy, little star." Sebastian's lips curved into a rare soft smile as he booped her nose. "I worried you might be brooding over Blackwood Industries stealing Isabella Wang from your project. Busy minds have no room for melancholy."

"Pfft. I'm not some fragile doll." Evelyn's pink lips formed an adorable pout. "I've been sleeping like a baby and eating everything in sight. That business with Isabella didn't even scratch the surface."

Theodore discreetly bit his lip, his pulse quickening as he watched the unguarded affection playing across Evelyn's face. This softer, more playful version of her only emerged around Sebastian.

He couldn't tear his eyes away from the rare display.

"Sleeping well? Those dark circles tell a different story." Sebastian's calloused thumb gently traced the delicate skin beneath her eyes. "And speaking of - wait, how do you even know Vivienne Laurent? She's practically entrusting her precious event to you. That's not just professional courtesy."

Evelyn's eyes shone with curiosity. "Éclat has never hosted an event in Crestview before."

"We're not acquainted." Sebastian's expression remained impassive.

"Then how-"

"She's been infatuated with me for about a decade, I believe."

Evelyn and Theodore gasped in unison. "What?"

Sebastian shrugged. "I've rejected her multiple times. Eventually I stopped acknowledging her advances altogether."

This was shocking - Vivienne Laurent was nearing fifty, while Sebastian had just turned thirty. The age gap alone made this revelation astonishing.

"How tragic. Absolutely heartbreaking." Evelyn sighed dramatically.

"Indeed. Must be exhausting having a fifty-year-old admirer." Theodore nodded sympathetically.

"Excuse me? I meant for Vivienne!" Evelyn swatted Theodore's arm. As a longtime admirer of the editor-in-chief, she felt compelled to defend her. "Age is irrelevant here. She simply chose the wrong man. She's every bit the formidable Miranda Priestly from Devil Wears Prada. How could sparks fly with an iceberg like Bash? Two frosty personalities don't make a flame."

Sebastian looked utterly speechless.

Theodore found himself equally at a loss for words.
###Chapter 432

Time slipped through our fingers like sand, and suddenly it was the evening of Monarch Grand Hotels' prestigious charity jewelry auction.

With Éclat magazine's involvement, the event had become the talk of Crestview without Monarch Group needing to lift a finger for promotion.

Éclat wasn't just any fashion publication - it was the holy grail that Hollywood royalty fought tooth and nail to appear in.

The red carpet outside the hotel pulsed with energy and flashing cameras.

A-listers gracefully navigated the screaming crowds, pausing just long enough for photographs before security whisked them inside.

When a sleek black limousine pulled up, the crowd's murmurs crescendoed into excited whispers.

The door swung open to reveal Penelope Whitmore and Cassandra Blackwood, draped in couture gowns that probably cost more than most people's annual salaries.

While other socialites discreetly used private entrances, these two thrived on public attention like moths to a flame.

"Look! Isn't that Victoria Sterling's aunt?"

Penelope's perfectly botoxed face twisted at the shouted question cutting through the crowd.

She'd spent years meticulously crafting her image as the respectable wife of Blackwood Industries' chairman, desperate to bury her scandalous past as a gold-digging mistress.

Yet here she was, still being reduced to "that notorious niece's aunt" because of Victoria's antics.

The title tasted like vinegar, bitter and unwanted.

"Oh my god, it is her!" another voice chimed in.

"Didn't she get arrested for bribery or something shady with city contracts?"

"Totally! But money talks, right? She walked free while regular folks would still be rotting in jail."

"That mugshot's still floating around online. The audacity to show her face in public!"

"Honestly, Leonard should keep his wife on a shorter leash."

"I'll never forget Victoria's birthday fiasco. Penelope was bragging about her perfect niece right before Victoria had her very public meltdown. Karma's a bitch!"

Penelope's stiletto-clad feet turned to lead. Only Cassandra's vice-like grip on her elbow kept her moving forward.

She'd truly believed those skeletons were safely locked away.

But Victoria's nuclear-level scandal had resurrected every buried shame.

Under a hail of snickers and camera flashes, the two women scurried into the hotel like rats escaping daylight.

"Maybe we should've used the private entrance, Mother," Cassandra hissed through a frozen smile. "Now I have to endure the humiliation by association."

"Excuse me?" Penelope's manicured nails dug into her daughter's arm. "After everything I sacrificed to give you this life? I endured public scorn while pregnant with you just to secure your position! Without my perseverance, you'd be nobody!"

The venom in her whisper made Cassandra flinch. "This is the thanks I get? An ungrateful child embarrassed by her own mother?"
###Chapter 433

Evelyn Carter pressed a hand to her bruised arm, desperate to escape Penelope Whitmore's scolding lecture.

From childhood, Evelyn had reaped the benefits of her mother's influence over her father, which paved the way for her privileged future. Yet beneath the surface, she secretly despised her mother's lack of refinement and worldly sophistication.

Penelope's vulgarity stood in stark contrast to polished socialites like Isabelle Montgomery's mother and Lillian Hartwell. Not that Evelyn had any choice in her parentage anyway.

The charity gala unfolded in two acts - the lavish banquet followed by the high-profile auction.

The venue glittered with A-list celebrities and acclaimed artists, as if the entire entertainment constellation had descended upon the event.

As Monarch Grand Hotels' general manager and event organizer, Evelyn found herself cornered by reporters demanding live interviews.

She maintained perfect composure under the flashing cameras.

"Ms. Kingsley," a journalist pressed, "Isabella Wang originally chose your hotel for her wedding venue. Now you're hosting Éclat magazine's charity auction. Is this your attempt to compete with Blackwood Industries?"

Evelyn's lips curved in a practiced smile. "I understand why you'd draw that conclusion given our companies' rivalry. But Éclat approached us about this event - the timing is purely coincidental. There's no ulterior motive here."

Another reporter jumped in. "Sources say Isabella initially booked KS World Hotel. What caused her last-minute switch to Blackwood Hotel? Was there some incident?"

Evelyn's smile tightened. "That information remains confidential hotel business. I'm not at liberty to discuss it."

The same persistent journalist continued, "She canceled with you after her wedding details leaked. Did that security breach influence her decision?"

Though Evelyn's expression remained calm, her eyes turned glacial. This reporter was clearly here to provoke.

From her shadowed corner, Isabelle Montgomery sipped champagne, watching with malicious delight as Evelyn fielded the aggressive questioning. She'd personally tipped off this particularly nosy journalist.

While the scandal had barely dented Evelyn's career, Isabelle hoped to bait her into some damning statement that would spark public backlash.

Penelope and Cassandra Blackwood moved closer through the crowd.

Flush with recent victories, Cassandra no longer feared Evelyn. Arrogance radiated from her every pore.

"You're absolutely right," Evelyn admitted suddenly, her smile vanishing. "That's exactly what happened."

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Isabelle's champagne flute froze halfway to her lips. She hadn't anticipated Evelyn would actually confirm the rumors instead of deflecting with some polished excuse.

This unexpected honesty threw her off balance.

"Stop harassing Ms. Kingsley," Cassandra interjected with false sympathy, chin lifted smugly. "She's had quite enough humiliation after that contract breach." Her lips curled in a cruel smile. "But chin up, Ms. Kingsley. There's always next time. Your failure serves as an excellent cautionary tale for Blackwood Industries. Rest assured, we maintain far stricter confidentiality protocols with our clients."
###Chapter 434

The bombshell Evelyn dropped had everyone's jaws on the floor.

First, she exposed how Monarch Grand Hotels had breached the contract with Isabella Laurent.

Second, she immediately organized an event for Éclat magazine - clearly damage control after losing Isabella's business.

Third, under Evelyn's management, Monarch Grand had failed spectacularly at customer privacy protection. A shocking negligence for any GM.

Isabella's switch to Blackwood Hotel proved which establishment truly delivered five-star service.

Reporters descended upon Evelyn like vultures, firing rapid questions with predatory intensity.

Evelyn saw right through Cassandra's game.

This was a calculated media ambush orchestrated by Cassandra and Penelope.

Even their flawless makeup couldn't conceal their smug expressions.

What pathetic clowns.

Isabella and Vivienne made their grand entrance together.

They took in the scene - Evelyn cornered by reporters while Cassandra smirked.

Vivienne adjusted her designer sunglasses. "Perhaps you were too hasty canceling with Ms. Carter."

Isabella arched a perfect brow. "Oh?"

"Her brother Sebastian is extraordinary. The most breathtaking man I've ever laid eyes on."

Vivienne's eyes sparkled behind dark lenses. "My absolute dream man."

"What does that have to do with my hotel contract?" Isabella looked genuinely puzzled.

Vivienne's voice turned pleading. "Couldn't you reconsider? She might be family someday."

Isabella nearly choked. Was this supposed to be persuasive?

No one noticed the lone figure observing from the mezzanine.

Nathan Blackwood stood motionless, his piercing gaze locked on the drama below.

Watching Evelyn's composed expression, his lips curved with dark amusement.

She wouldn't go down without a fight.

Evelyn never retreated from battle.

"Sir, the reporters are tearing her apart with false accusations," Oliver murmured.

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "Even framed, I can't intervene. My involvement would only complicate matters further."

This was Evelyn's fight alone.

"I need two favors," Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

Oliver leaned in. "Name them."
###Chapter 435

I want that journalist silenced. The one who dared to slander Evelyn's name should vanish from every media platform.

Consider it done.

Contact Monarch Group's PR team immediately. Monitor all online mentions. Any negative press about Evelyn Carter or Monarch Grand Hotels must be scrubbed from the internet.

Understood.

Nathan Blackwood stood motionless, his hardened gaze softening as he studied Evelyn's defiant profile.

Evelyn, do whatever you wish. No thanks needed—I'll handle everything in the shadows for you.

The commotion downstairs continued.

"Ms. Carter," Penelope Whitmore sneered, seizing the opportunity to humiliate her, "what a shame Salvador Corporation couldn't secure the partnership with Isabella Wang. Clearly, your inexperience in management led to this failure."

Her voice dripped with false sympathy. "But don't worry, dear. We all make mistakes when we're young. The important thing is admitting them."

Evelyn's lips curled into an unreadable smile. "Indeed, it was my oversight to let those with ulterior motives slip through. A lesson learned."

Penelope scoffed.

"Are you implying you were framed, Ms. Carter?" a journalist blurted out.

Ignoring the question, Evelyn gestured gracefully toward the next venue. "The charity auction is about to begin. Shall we?"

She didn’t spare Penelope or Cassandra another glance.

The mother-daughter duo seethed.

That little witch thinks vague words will save her? Penelope's nails dug into her palm as she glared at Evelyn's retreating figure. She has no idea what’s coming.

Cassandra clung to her mother’s arm, gleeful. "Did you see how she avoided answering? She’s already admitted defeat! Once this event ends, we’ll make sure the media drags her through the mud."

"Mrs. Whitmore! Cassandra!"

Isabelle Montgomery emerged from the crowd, her steps elegant as she lifted the hem of her gown. "Good evening."

"Ah, Isabelle!" Penelope clasped her hands warmly. "I was looking for you. I worried you might not have arrived."

Cassandra beamed. "Mother, it’s thanks to Isabelle that we secured Isabella Wang’s contract."

Isabelle demurely lowered her lashes. "It was nothing, really. Just a small favor among friends."

Penelope patted her hand. "Such loyalty won’t be forgotten, my dear. If you ever need anything, just ask."

Her smile was honeyed, but her eyes gleamed with calculation.
###Chapter 436

The attendees streamed into the adjacent grand hall where the charity auction was about to commence.

Evelyn discreetly slipped away from the media frenzy, seeking refuge in the quiet corridor to catch her breath.

"Ms. Carter!" Theodore hurried toward her with concern etched across his features. "Are you unwell?"

"Just some persistent journalists." She waved a dismissive hand. "What harm could they possibly do?"

Though composed, a faint crease appeared between Evelyn's brows. "You shouldn't be here. The auction requires your attention."

"But I was concerned about your wellbeing." Theodore's voice carried a rasp of anxiety. "Those reporters were clearly planted to undermine you! They kept circling back to past missteps to tarnish your image."

"Isn't that their job?" Evelyn arched an elegant eyebrow, crossing her arms. "Should they shower me with praise simply because it's a charity event?" Her lips curved into a knowing smile. "Besides, their questions weren't unfounded. There were indeed... lapses in management that certain opportunistic vultures exploited. I can hardly blame the messengers."

Theodore's mind immediately conjured images of Cassandra and Penelope.

"You're mistaken about one thing," Evelyn continued, leaning against the marble wall while absently tapping her shoulder. "Those journalists weren't sent to destroy me, but to assist me." Her eyes gleamed with quiet calculation. "Let Cassandra revel in her petty schemes. I specialize in watching my adversaries plummet from their self-constructed pedestals precisely when they believe victory is assured." A dark chuckle escaped her lips. "How utterly delightful."

Theodore observed how Evelyn's gaze darkened dangerously, mirroring Sebastian's ruthless demeanor so perfectly it sent an involuntary shiver down his spine.

This exquisite rose concealed venomous thorns beneath her beauty.

Recalling his duties as the Monarch Group's executive secretary, Theodore hastily returned to oversee the auction preparations.

Having worked tirelessly since dawn with only a light breakfast, Evelyn hadn't eaten all day. Not a morsel of lunch or dinner, nor even a sip of water.

Her stomach protested loudly as she collapsed onto a plush sofa, kicking off her stilettos to reveal pale, aching feet. Curling into herself, she winced at the sharp pangs of hunger.

"Starving..." she murmured weakly, eyelids fluttering shut.

Then an unmistakable aroma teased her senses - rich, velvety chocolate.

Assuming hunger-induced hallucination, she instinctively sniffed the air like a curious kitten.

"Planning to inhale it rather than eat?" A deep, resonant voice laced with icy amusement cut through her daze.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. Her eyes flew open.

Wide, startled emerald orbs locked with Nathan's mesmerizing dark ones - those fathomless eyes that never failed to unravel her composure no matter the circumstance.

The scene before her was surreal: Evelyn lay curled on the sofa while Nathan knelt before her on one knee, holding out a decadent chocolate cupcake.

Her empty stomach clenched painfully.

Three years of marriage, yet Nathan had never once bent his knee or lowered his proud head for her. During her most vulnerable moments, when she'd loved him desperately like a moth drawn to flame, she'd been the one humbling herself, swallowing tears of heartbreak.

The memories brought an unexpected sting to her eyes, her breathing turning uneven.

Nathan maintained his position, brow furrowing slightly at her lack of response. "You were complaining about hunger. Why refuse? It's your favorite - chocolate. Not poisoned, I assure you."

"I don't want it." The words scraped against her throat, thick with unshed tears and bitterness.

"Agnes mentioned your gastric issues. Prolonged fasting isn't advisable."

"I said I'm not eating it!"

With a sudden violent motion, Evelyn swatted the cupcake from Nathan's hand.

"Evelyn!" His voice held shocked fury.

The delicate pastry sailed through the air before shattering against the floor, its fragments scattering like broken promises.

Nathan's obsidian eyes burned into hers. The heat of his anger warred with the icy disappointment flooding his veins, leaving him chilled to the bone.

More than the cupcake had crumbled - so had something fragile between them.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" Nathan bit out through clenched teeth. "Can't you recognize basic kindness?"

Evelyn sat up abruptly, hunger forgotten beneath the storm of emotions. "I despise you! More so for this sudden consideration!" Her voice trembled with barely restrained fury. "Nathan, do you realize your pity feels more insulting than your indifference ever did?"
###Chapter 437

"What the hell are you saying?" Nathan Blackwood's brow furrowed, his expression darkening as he stared at her in disbelief.

She was being utterly irrational.

"Stay away from me." Evelyn Carter's voice was ice. "I don't need your kindness. Not even a little."

She clenched her teeth against the sharp pain in her stomach, forcing herself to stand despite the dizziness threatening to pull her under. Her face was ghostly pale, but her eyes burned with defiance. "Is it because Victoria Sterling left you? Now that she's gone, you're desperate to redirect your affections somewhere else?" Her lips curled into a bitter smirk. "I'm not your consolation prize, Nathan. You might be willing to settle, but I refuse to lower my standards for you."

Nathan's fist tightened, his knuckles turning white. Humiliation and fury coiled inside him, his vision tinged red.

All he had done was offer her a damn cupcake.

He had seen her wincing in pain, her stomach growling from hunger, and he'd thought—what? That a simple gesture would ease her suffering?

How naïve.

She had twisted his intentions, weaponizing them against him with venomous precision.

Evelyn slipped into her heels, spine straight as steel, and strode away without another glance.

Nathan stared at the crushed cupcake in his palm, his chest constricting as he watched her retreating figure.

The Evelyn he once knew—the one who used to smile at him like sunlight breaking through clouds—was gone.

Their failed marriage had left scars too deep to heal.

To her, he was no longer a lover, but a battlefield ghost. A reminder of trauma she couldn’t escape. Every kindness he offered was met with suspicion, every attempt at reconciliation met with hostility.

His lips trembled as he crushed the cupcake further, the sweetness turning to dust between his fingers.

He had ruined everything.

The grand hall buzzed with anticipation, the charity auction still minutes away from beginning.

Two titans of their respective industries—Isabella Wang, the reigning queen of entertainment, and Vivienne Laurent, the formidable editor-in-chief of Éclat magazine—stood as the undisputed stars of the evening. Reporters swarmed them, cameras flashing relentlessly.

Penelope Whitmore had already disappeared into the crowd, schmoozing with the other elite socialites, while Cassandra Blackwood and Isabelle Montgomery pursued their own agendas.

Cassandra wanted a photo with Isabella Wang—another trophy for her collection. After all, she had been the one to secure the deal with the superstar. A little media attention would only solidify her reputation.

Isabelle, on the other hand, had her sights set on Vivienne Laurent. A photo with the fashion icon would elevate her status in the industry, opening doors for her future endeavors.

"Ms. Wang!" Cassandra beamed, spotting the actress wearing the gown she had gifted her. "You look absolutely stunning tonight! I’m so honored you chose to wear it."

The reporters closed in, microphones thrust forward, cameras clicking nonstop.

"Of course," Isabella replied smoothly, though her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. "It’s an Alexa original, after all."

She didn’t particularly like Cassandra’s shallow demeanor, but business was business. The Blackwoods were handling her wedding, and she couldn’t afford to be rude.

So she draped an arm around Cassandra’s waist, flashing a practiced smile for the cameras.

Cassandra nearly squealed in delight.

"Ms. Wang!" a reporter called out. "Will you be bidding tonight, or are you donating an item for the auction?"

Isabella’s lips curved. "I’ll be donating a piece of jewelry."

"Oh? Can you give us a hint about what it might be?"

"That," she said with a playful wink, "is a surprise."

Meanwhile, Isabelle was mustering her courage to approach Vivienne Laurent.

She waited until the editor finished her interview, then darted forward.

"Ms. Laurent!"

Vivienne paused, turning slowly. Her sharp gaze assessed Isabelle from behind her sunglasses, unimpressed.

The girl was drowning in an ill-fitting evening gown—this season’s couture, yes, but completely wrong for her frame and coloring.

Tasteless.

"Ms. Laurent," Isabelle gushed, her round face flushed. "I’ve been a fan of Éclat since I was a child! You’re such an inspiration—"

"Since you were a child?" Vivienne arched a brow. "How old do you think I am?"

Isabelle blanched. "N-no! That’s not what I meant! I just—I admire you so much—"

But before she could finish, Vivienne had already brushed past her, her attention snagged by someone else entirely.

Isabelle spun around—and froze.

Vivienne was striding toward Evelyn Carter, her entire demeanor shifting.

"Ms. Carter!" she called, her voice warm. "I’ve been waiting for you."

The way she smiled at Evelyn—like they were old friends—sent a ripple of shock through the room.
###Chapter 438

The crowd of celebrities and journalists turned their stunned gazes toward Evelyn.

"Ms. Laurent, I apologize. I wasn't aware you were waiting for me."

Evelyn felt the heat rise to her cheeks under the unexpected attention, her typically composed demeanor faltering slightly.

Vivienne Laurent's eyes crinkled with warmth behind her designer sunglasses. "No need to apologize, darling. You've been working tirelessly tonight."

In a move that sent whispers through the crowd, the fashion icon draped an arm around Evelyn's shoulders with sisterly affection. "Everyone, do capture this moment for us."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

The assembled guests collectively held their breath. Never in living memory had the notoriously aloof editor-in-chief of Éclat magazine voluntarily posed for photographs with anyone.

This simple gesture spoke volumes about Evelyn's rising status in high society.

Nearby, Cassandra Blackwood and Isabelle Montgomery's expressions darkened.

Isabelle, still standing awkwardly where she'd been rebuffed earlier, felt humiliation crawl up her spine like icy fingers.

Why? What mystical allure did Evelyn possess that drew influential figures to her like moths to flame? Isabelle couldn't comprehend the secret of her rival's magnetism.

The camera flashes illuminated Evelyn and Vivienne's smiling faces, their arms entwined.

Though Evelyn maintained perfect poise, her heart thrummed with exhilaration like a champagne bottle ready to pop.

In this single moment, she'd reclaimed every ounce of respect she'd lost earlier in the evening.

When the photo session concluded, Vivienne guided Evelyn to a quieter corner of the venue.

"Ms. Laurent, I can't thank you enough for what you just did."

Evelyn spoke with genuine gratitude. "As you witnessed, I encountered... difficulties tonight. Your public endorsement has restored my standing immeasurably."

She hesitated before adding, "I understand we're both invested in this event's success, so I appreciate you prioritizing the gala's reputation."

A self-deprecating smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Regardless of the reason, I'm deeply grateful."

"Ms. Carter," Vivienne corrected gently, removing her sunglasses to reveal earnest eyes, "my assistance has nothing to do with professional obligations."

Her expression softened with maternal affection. "Sebastian reached out to me. He asked that I look after you tonight and provide whatever support you might need."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Her overprotective brother strikes again. Even absent, Sebastian had woven an invisible safety net around her, anticipating every possible scenario.

But Vivienne's feelings for Sebastian were... complicated.

Evelyn thought wryly, 'Sebastian, you're fully aware of her decade-long crush on you, yet you're leveraging that affection for my benefit. How very ungentlemanly.'

"Ms. Carter, I'm aware Isabella Wang terminated her contract with you, which must have been devastating professionally."

Vivienne's tone turned serious as she adjusted her glasses. "Isabella and I go way back. I could speak with her about reinstating you as her wedding planner. Consider it my pleasure to help."

"Oh no, that's quite unnecessary!"

Evelyn waved her hands in protest. "You've already done more than enough. I couldn't possibly accept further favors!"

"Are you concerned about being indebted to me?"

Vivienne's laugh was light as she patted Evelyn's shoulder. "Darling, I expect nothing in return. Surely Sebastian mentioned my... feelings for him?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, nodding vigorously.

"You're Sebastian's beloved sister - his most cherished family member." Vivienne's voice took on a dreamy quality. "Anyone precious to him becomes precious to me. Ten years I've loved him without expectation. Just being permitted to adore him from afar is gift enough."
###Chapter 439

At the mention of Sebastian Kingsley, Vivienne Laurent's eyes ignited with an almost fanatical devotion.

Evelyn Carter was momentarily stunned. She desperately wanted to know what Sebastian had done to inspire such unwavering loyalty in this woman.

He truly was a master of manipulation.

Outside.

Nathan Blackwood chain-smoked three cigarettes in the designated area, yet the suffocating weight in his chest refused to dissipate.

But with the auction about to commence, he had no choice but to drag his heavy heart back into the grand hall.

Nathan's tall, brooding figure emerged from the left corridor, his presence commanding yet tinged with melancholy.

Simultaneously, from the opposite end, a refined gentleman approached with effortless grace.

Their paths collided before the grand double doors.

The air crackled with tension as their gazes locked, an unspoken challenge passing between them.

Nathan's piercing glare met Alexander Whitmore's composed demeanor.

Alexander adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses with a practiced smile. "What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Blackwood. Here to support the charitable cause?"

Nathan's lips curved into a cool smirk. "Not as altruistic as you, I'm afraid. My contributions are... personal."

There was no mistaking who he meant.

Alexander's smile faltered slightly, his fingers tightening imperceptibly around his bidding paddle.

The night's main event—the charity auction—finally began.

There were two ways to participate: donating items for auction or engaging in competitive bidding.

All proceeds would go directly to the state's charitable fund, with complete transparency guaranteed.

This marked the fifteenth anniversary of Éclat magazine's prestigious charity gala, and anticipation hung thick in the air. Would Monarch Grand Hotels shatter previous donation records?

Nathan and Alexander's simultaneous entrance caused a stir, but tonight belonged to Evelyn. Neither man wished to overshadow her, so they took discreet seats in the front row, becoming little more than elegant background decor.

Unbeknownst to Evelyn, Alexander had arrived. She and Vivienne sat close, their heads bent together in animated conversation.

Isabelle Montgomery, seated several rows away, seethed with barely contained fury at the sight.

The auction commenced.

The emcee unveiled the first item—a breathtaking five-piece emerald diamond set from the private collection of Mrs. Whitmore herself.

Gasps of awe rippled through the crowd.

The very first lot was already staggeringly valuable, lending immense prestige to Evelyn's event.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. She instinctively turned to scan the room for Alexander.

Her gaze found his effortlessly—his refined features stood out even in the dim lighting.

Noticing her surprise, Alexander offered a subtle smile and a discreet wave.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved in response as she waved back.

Neither noticed Nathan watching their exchange, his grip tightening around his bidding paddle until the wood threatened to splinter. The burning ache in his throat matched the fire in his chest.
###Chapter 440

The moment the emerald diamond necklace was unveiled, the crowd erupted into excited murmurs.

Anyone with eyes could see it was a masterpiece—the flawless clarity of the gemstone, the precision of its cut. A piece like this could easily fetch millions.

Whitmore Enterprises had truly outdone themselves, donating such an exquisite piece for the charity auction.

Then, a spotlight swept across the room, illuminating Alexander Whitmore's striking figure.

All eyes turned toward him, and gasps of admiration rippled through the crowd. His aristocratic features, sharp yet refined, commanded attention.

But his gaze never wavered from Evelyn Carter, as if she were the only person in the room.

He had come for her.

Only her.

"That man is breathtaking! His face looks like it was sculpted by the gods themselves. Who is he?"

"He must be Victor Whitmore's son. Who else could afford to donate something so valuable?"

"Victor Whitmore's son? Why haven’t we seen him before?"

"Look how devoted he is to Ms. Carter. Are they involved?"

"And why not? She’s stunning. They’d make a perfect match!"

The whispers buzzed in Nathan Blackwood’s ears like a swarm of wasps. A perfect match?

The thought made his jaw tighten.

Alexander’s polished appearance and the way his dark eyes lingered on Evelyn reminded Nathan of a serpent—charming but dangerous.

"The starting bid for this emerald diamond necklace is two million dollars. Let the bidding begin!"

The auctioneer’s voice barely faded before paddles shot up across the room.

"Three million!"

"Four million!"

"Four and a half!"

"Five million!"

The energy in the room was electric, the competition fierce.

Before the auction began, Evelyn had been nursing a dull ache in her stomach.

But watching the bids skyrocket in mere moments?

Suddenly, she didn’t feel a thing.

Money was the best painkiller.

Meanwhile, Penelope Whitmore and her daughter, Cassandra, sat seething in their seats.

They had come expecting Evelyn to fail spectacularly.

Instead, the auction was off to a roaring start, and their carefully laid plans to humiliate her were crumbling before their eyes.

"Mother!" Cassandra hissed, her nails digging into her palms. "Alexander Whitmore is here representing his family’s company, and he brought that necklace just to support her? He’s clearly obsessed!"

Penelope smirked. "Jealous?"

"Of course I am!"

Cassandra’s chest burned with resentment.

No man had ever doted on her the way Evelyn’s brothers did.

No one had ever looked at her the way Nathan once had—before Evelyn came back into his life.

Even now, Alexander Whitmore, a man of wealth and status, only had eyes for her.

"Why does she get everything?" Cassandra whispered bitterly. "Perfect brothers, powerful admirers… while I’m stuck with a useless sister and a future tied to Julian Montgomery!"

Penelope pinched her daughter’s thigh sharply.

Cassandra yelped, drawing irritated glances from nearby guests.

"Stop wallowing," Penelope snapped under her breath. "Julian Montgomery is your fiancé. That alliance is non-negotiable. And as for Alexander Whitmore?"

Her lips curled into a cruel smile.

"Let Evelyn have him. He’s Victor Whitmore’s least favorite son—no shares, no real power. Just a pretty face with a famous last name."

She leaned closer, her voice dripping with malice.

"Let her shackle herself to a man with no future. It’ll keep Nathan out of her grasp and ruin her in one stroke."

By then, the bids had climbed to six million.
###Chapter 441

The auction hall fell into stunned silence as all bidding ceased.

Evelyn Carter's lips curved into a satisfied smile. The charity auction was off to an excellent start.

"Seven million dollars."

A deep, composed voice suddenly cut through the quiet from the back of the room.

Evelyn's breath caught. The pleased expression on her face vanished instantly.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Nathan Blackwood raised his bidding paddle high from the front row, his expression unreadable yet radiating absolute confidence.

"That's Nathan Blackwood—CEO of Blackwood Industries!"

"Oh my God! When did he get here? He just appeared out of nowhere!"

"He's always so low-key, but when it comes to spending, he doesn't hold back!"

Nathan didn't lower his paddle. His intense gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, unwavering.

Yet Evelyn didn't so much as glance in his direction.

Seven million dollars couldn't even earn him a backward glance from Evelyn Carter, the heiress of Monarch Group.

If that was the case, he'd just have to keep spending.

"Paying seven million for that necklace is ridiculous. Even if he's wealthy, he shouldn't throw money around like that." Vivienne Laurent, the editor-in-chief of Éclat magazine, shook her head in disapproval.

"The more fools like him there are, the more hope children in impoverished areas have." Evelyn smirked, already mentally cursing that bastard Nathan to hell.

"Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you for your generous contribution to charity!"

The auctioneer slammed his gavel, and the room erupted into thunderous applause.

When the cameras turned to Nathan, he offered a perfunctory smile.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore, seated not far from him, adjusted his glasses with a single finger, his gaze icy.

The auction continued smoothly.

Every piece of jewelry donated was sold at exorbitant prices. Even Penelope Whitmore made a symbolic purchase.

But what infuriated Evelyn was that whenever a less desirable piece went unnoticed, Nathan would deliberately outbid everyone—paying well above its value.

In just an hour, he had already bought three pieces, spending over thirty million dollars.

Evelyn's expression darkened. She wished she could throw this insufferable man out of the venue.

Just then, Nathan won yet another underwhelming piece, sparking murmurs among the crowd.

"Is that really worth four million? Mr. Blackwood must have terrible taste."

"He's handsome and rich—who cares if he's a little foolish? Nobody's perfect!"

"Foolish? Open your eyes! Haven't you noticed? Every piece he's bought is practically worthless. Even if you picked randomly, you'd land on something decent eventually. He's clearly doing this on purpose!" someone pointed out shrewdly.

The crowd exchanged glances. That made sense! So then...

"Mr. Blackwood is deliberately buying the cheaper items to support Ms. Carter and boost the auction's prestige. He's trying to win her over!"

Isabelle Montgomery watched as the man she desperately longed for went out of his way to please Evelyn Carter. Her eyes burned with fury.

She wanted Nathan so badly, yet he was throwing himself at Evelyn's feet—only to be ignored. The sheer contrast made Isabelle feel humiliated beyond measure.

The crowd nodded in agreement, finding the theory plausible.

Nathan caught snippets of their whispers, and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly.

At least some people understood.

Too bad Evelyn never once looked back at him.

His faint smile faded.

"How pathetic," Alexander scoffed, utterly unimpressed.

What was the point of throwing money around? Did Nathan think Evelyn was some shallow woman who could be bought?

"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present the next item!"

The auctioneer's voice boomed as he dramatically pulled away the velvet cloth covering the display case.

A breathtaking teardrop-shaped white diamond necklace was revealed, surrounded by hundreds of tiny blue diamonds. The craftsmanship was exquisite—chic, elegant, and utterly mesmerizing.

"This stunning piece was generously donated by Ms. Isabella Laurent and designed by the world-renowned jeweler, Ms. Alexa herself! Thank you, Ms. Laurent, for your incredible generosity!"

The moment the necklace appeared, Cassandra Blackwood jolted upright in her seat, her face twisting in shock.

At the same time, Isabelle's expression stiffened. Her fingers clenched together so tightly they turned white.
###Chapter 442

They had prepared for every possible scenario—except this.

Isabella Wang was donating that necklace publicly, in front of everyone!

How could this be happening?

Cassandra Blackwood whipped her head around, locking eyes with Isabelle Montgomery from across the room. Her lips parted, but no words came out.

The unveiling of Alexa's work sent the auction into a frenzy.

Jewelry connoisseurs and industry elites leaned forward, straining for a glimpse of the legendary designer's masterpiece.

Nathan Blackwood and Alexander Whitmore, who had been disinterested all evening, suddenly sat straighter, their grips tightening on their bidding paddles.

"Cassandra, why are you standing? Sit down before you embarrass us!" Penelope Whitmore hissed, yanking her daughter's arm.

"Mother, we have a problem!" Cassandra collapsed into her seat, her voice shaking.

"What now?"

"That necklace Isabella Wang donated—I gave it to her."

"You what?!" Penelope's eyes bulged. "Since when do you own an Alexa piece? And you just handed it to some actress?"

Her fury flared. "That ungrateful wretch is spitting on your generosity! And you—why didn’t you bring it home to me first? After everything I’ve done for you!"

"Mother... it's fake." Cassandra's whisper was barely audible, her skin clammy.

Penelope froze. "Excuse me?"

"Isabelle helped me commission a replica from Alexa's apprentice." Cassandra swallowed hard. "Isabella Wang was delaying the contract signing, so I thought—like Evelyn Carter did—I’d use Alexa’s name to sway her. The counterfeit is flawless, one of her lesser-known designs. I assumed even if it was exposed later, the deal would already be sealed. But now... she’s donating it! If this gets out, Blackwood Industries will be humiliated!"

"You absolute fool!"

Penelope dug her nails into Cassandra’s wrist. "No gift is better than a fraudulent one! You’ve risked our family’s reputation over this?"

"It wasn’t my idea! Isabelle manipulated me!" Cassandra’s voice cracked with indignation.

"And you let her?" Penelope’s face flushed crimson. "If the forgery goes unnoticed, she gets her wedding planned—her vendetta against Evelyn served. If it’s exposed? You’re the one holding the bag, not her!"

The realization hit Cassandra like a slap. She’d been played.

"Mother, what do we do?"

"We adapt."

Penelope inhaled sharply, composing herself. "Alexa’s works are everywhere. Who can prove this one’s fake? Even Isabella didn’t suspect."

Cassandra exhaled shakily, but dread still coiled in her stomach.

"I’d like to say a few words about this piece." Isabella Wang took the microphone, her smile serene.

Her gaze landed on Cassandra’s ashen face. "My thanks to Ms. Cassandra Blackwood of Blackwood Industries for this generous gift."

Evelyn Carter casually texted Theodore Winslow backstage.

A spotlight abruptly illuminated Cassandra, freezing her like a deer in headlights. The jumbo screen magnified her strained smile for all to see.

She wanted to scream.

"While I adore Alexa’s creations," Isabella continued, "I believe sharing this treasure to help those in need is far more meaningful than keeping it for myself."
###Chapter 443

This philosophy has guided Evelyn Carter's jewelry designs for years.

As her devoted admirer, I aspire to walk the same creative path. I hope Ms. Cassandra Blackwood won't mind my bold request.

The gift moved me deeply—precisely why I wish to elevate its significance.

Isabella Wang's declaration left Cassandra speechless.

All she wanted was for the blinding spotlight to switch off, for her flushed face to vanish from the massive screens.

If possible, she'd dissolve into the air itself.

Evelyn's creations are rare treasures with immeasurable value. Therefore, Ms. Wang announced this lot would have no reserve price!

The auction began, but bidders hesitated.

"Thirty million."

Alexander Whitmore's calm voice cut through the silence as he lifted his paddle with a confident smile.

Thirty million dors?!

The highest bid of the night so far!

If the opening bid already reached thirty million, would this escalate to hundreds of millions?

While an Evelyn Carter piece justified such sums, the staggering amount deterred many hopeful bidders.

"Fifty million." Nathan Blackwood raised his paddle, his expression icy yet determined.

A fierce glint in his eyes betrayed his relentless ambition.

The crowd gasped—did the Blackwoods operate a private mint?

A twenty-million-dollar leap in one bid!

Several tentative bidders immediately withdrew.

"Seventy million." Alexander countered without hesitation, his challenge clear.

Nathan didn't flinch. "Ninety million."

"One hundred million." Alexander fired back.

The auction hall erupted in disbelief.

Confirmed—the Whitmores also printed money in their basement.

Evelyn crossed her arms, long lashes fluttering over unreadable eyes, crimson lips pressed thin.

She watched the bids skyrocket like speculative stocks, yet her face remained impassive.

"Ms. Kingsley," whispered Vivienne Laurent, "this isn't bidding—it's a testosterone-fueled duel."

"Exactly! They're treating this gala like a drag race!" Evelyn scowled, itching to confiscate their paddles.

Nearby, Penelope Whitmore gaped at the spectacle.

"Mother, you claimed Mr. Whitmore was penniless!" Cassandra hissed. "Yet he just bid a hundred million!"

Penelope had no rebuttal.

Had she gravely miscalculated? Was Alexander a wolf in lamb's wool?

"One hundred twenty million." Nathan's voice was steel.

Evelyn had been his unresolved obsession for years—tonight, he'd claim this piece at any cost.

"One hundred fifty million!"

A crystalline voice rang out.

Evelyn finally raised her paddle, frosty determination in her gaze. The game had changed.
###Chapter 444

Nathan and Alexander's breaths hitched simultaneously as their gazes locked onto Evelyn.

Having known her for years, they instantly recognized the dangerous glint in her emerald eyes.

This was the unmistakable sign of Evelyn Carter's legendary temper.

Without hesitation, both men withdrew their bids immediately.

If Evelyn wanted that necklace, they'd let her have it. No piece of jewelry was worth her wrath.

"Congratulations, Ms. Carter! The necklace is yours!"

The auctioneer, sensing the tension, wasted no time slamming his gavel before anyone could react.

A stunned silence blanketed the grand ballroom before erupting into thunderous applause.

Evelyn remained impassive, her porcelain features betraying no emotion as she stared blankly ahead.

"Mother! Evelyn just bought the counterfeit necklace!" Cassandra's voice trembled as violently as her hands. "What if she realizes it's fake?"

Penelope's nails dug into her daughter's arm. "Keep your voice down, you foolish girl!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "She'd never suspect a forgery at her own charity event. Consider that $150 million payment for your miserable karma!"

"But when she examines it later—"

"Once that necklace leaves this ballroom, any substitution could've happened anywhere!" Penelope's lips curled into a venomous smile. "Who's to say she didn't swap it herself to frame you?"

Cassandra marveled at her mother's effortless deceit, cursing her own inability to match such cunning.

Across the room, Isabella Wang preened with satisfaction, watching the highest bid of the evening go to her donated piece.

She smugly assumed Evelyn must still be desperate for collaboration, hence this extravagant display.

Ah, the naivety of youth!

Meanwhile, the "naive" Evelyn's icy fingers tapped a message to Theodore before settling back with the poised anticipation of a panther awaiting its prey.

"Our next item is from—"

The auctioneer's announcement died abruptly as the velvet drape lifted.

His eyes darted between the teardrop diamond necklace in the display case and his inventory sheet.

This wasn't the scheduled item.

When spotlights illuminated the dazzling piece, gasps rippled through the elite crowd.

"Am I hallucinating? Isn't that Isabella Wang's donated necklace?"

"It's identical! The same design!"

"Impossible! Every Alexa creation is one-of-a-kind!"

"Two identical pieces at the same auction? One must be counterfeit!"

The murmurs crescendoed into open speculation as fingers pointed at the display case.

Isabella shot forward in her seat, face draining of color at the duplicate necklace on stage.

Penelope and Cassandra clutched each other's hands, their knuckles whitening. Cold sweat trickled down Cassandra's spine.

Her donated necklace was undeniably fake.

Which meant only one thing—the necklace currently on stage was genuine.

"Ms. Carter, weren't the auction items vetted?" Vivienne Laurent whispered urgently, not as accusation but concern.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Perhaps the question should be directed at Ms. Wang, don't you think?"

Vivienne's eyes widened. "That necklace... Could it be—?"

As whispers swirled, Evelyn rose with regal grace and ascended the stage.

Nathan's piercing gaze tracked her every movement, his pulse accelerating inexplicably beneath his tailored suit. His skin burned as if scorched by her proximity.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Evelyn's melodic voice commanded silence, "as organizer of Éclat's charity gala and director of Monarch Grand Hotels, I take full responsibility for this irregularity and sincerely apologize for any confusion caused."
###Chapter 445

Evelyn Carter gave a graceful curtsy to the audience, her emerald green gown shimmering under the chandelier lights.

The murmuring crowd gradually fell silent.

"Secondly," she continued, her voice clear as crystal, "I'd like to announce my donation - the Celestial Tear, one of Alexa's most exquisite creations." Her rosebud lips curved slightly.

Gasps echoed through the grand ballroom as all heads swiveled toward Isabella Laurent.

The international superstar sat frozen, her manicured fingers gripping her champagne flute too tightly. Hundreds of eyes burned into her, but she could only stare helplessly at Cassandra Blackwood.

Cassandra, in turn, whipped her head toward Isabelle Montgomery's seat - only to find it conspicuously empty.

Isabelle had slipped away during the earlier commotion, her instincts screaming danger.

From her vantage point on stage, Evelyn observed this comical chain reaction with icy amusement. A knowing smile played on her crimson lips. "Ms. Laurent, I wasn't aware you'd be donating this piece tonight. What an extraordinary coincidence. I do hope there's no misunderstanding."

Isabella's voice trembled slightly. "Ms. Carter, how is it possible that you also possess the Celestial Tear?"

Evelyn's smile faded, replaced by a thoughtful frown. "Ms. Laurent, the real question isn't why I have this necklace, but rather why yours appears to be a counterfeit."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the elite gathering.

Penelope Whitmore maintained her composure with visible effort, while Cassandra turned as pale as her ivory gown.

"That's impossible!" Isabella protested, her carefully cultivated poise cracking. "Cassandra Blackwood herself gave me that necklace! The Blackwood heiress wouldn't dare—"

Her voice caught as the implications hit her. If the necklace was fake, her grand philanthropic gesture would make her the laughingstock of high society.

"Ms. Carter!" Penelope interjected sharply, stepping forward. "You can't make such outrageous claims without proper authentication! This is slander!"

Evelyn remained unruffled. "I wouldn't make such an accusation without proof, Ms. Whitmore. I assure you, I'm being completely objective."

A mischievous glint flashed in Evelyn's hazel eyes, noticed only by one observant guest.

Nathan Blackwood sat ramrod straight in his front-row seat, his gaze locked on Evelyn's expressive face. That particular sparkle in her eyes - the one that used to infuriate him - now filled him with inexplicable warmth.

"Ms. Carter! You're accusing the Blackwoods of dealing in counterfeits? Where's your evidence?"
"Isabella Laurent is a renowned jewelry collector! She'd know a fake immediately!"
"Exactly! You can't make baseless accusations! They look identical - get an expert to authenticate them first!"

Evelyn weathered the storm of criticism with regal indifference.

Then - a dramatic interruption.

The massive double doors burst open with a resounding crash.

Every head turned in unison.

A statuesque blonde woman in towering Louboutins strode into the ballroom, her ice-blue eyes scanning the crowd with authority.

Even Nathan did a double-take. It was Giselle Dubois - Alexa's right-hand woman.

What was she doing here?

"It's Ms. Dubois! The director of Alexa's atelier!" someone whispered excitedly.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. If anyone could authenticate Alexa's work, it was her personal assistant.

With purposeful strides, Giselle marched directly toward Evelyn, ignoring the gawking spectators.

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed visibly as she descended the stage to meet her.

"You made it," she said softly, the warmth in her voice surprising the onlookers.

Giselle took Evelyn's hand and pressed a reverent kiss to her knuckles - the traditional Valmontian gesture of deep respect.

"My sincerest apologies for the delay... Ms. Alexa."
###Chapter 446

The grand ballroom fell into stunned silence before erupting into shocked whispers.

Evelyn Carter is Alexa? Nathan Blackwood's mind went completely blank.

His entire body went numb as if his soul had been violently ripped from his chest. His knees nearly buckled beneath him.

Evelyn is Alexa! The realization hit him like a freight train. She's the world-renowned jewelry designer everyone worships.

She had been watching his pathetic attempts to meet Alexa this entire time. She must have been secretly laughing at his humiliation.

Nathan felt like the ground had disappeared beneath his feet. His lips trembled uncontrollably as his breathing became ragged. His eyes burned crimson with barely contained fury. He couldn't tell if he was more furious or devastated.

"You lied to me again, Evelyn. You actually lied to me again!" he seethed internally.

She possessed this extraordinary talent yet played the role of a meek housewife for three years. She scrubbed floors while hiding her brilliance behind an apron.

"Why would you degrade yourself like this?" His jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached. "Were you mocking me this whole time?" His hand instinctively clutched at his chest where his heart pounded violently. "Is this some twisted game to you, Evelyn? How could I possibly love someone who's never been honest with me?"

"Alexa?!" The heiress of Monarch Group is Alexa?! This is unbelievable!

"Could this be fake?"

"The diamonds can be forged, but her identity?"

"Besides, Giselle Dubois herself confirmed it!"

Even the most dignified socialites abandoned all pretense of decorum, pulling out their phones to snap pictures like rabid paparazzi.

With Alexa looking this breathtakingly stunning, not capturing this moment would be criminal. Tonight would go down in history!

Alexander Whitmore observed the crowd swarming around Evelyn with quiet amusement. She shone like the moon surrounded by insignificant stars. Adjusting his glasses, his lips curved into a fond smile.

No other woman could electrify him like Evelyn. She made him believe love might not be the foolish fantasy he'd always thought it was.

The scene descended into chaos as the crowd pressed closer, desperate to get near the legendary designer.

Concerned for Evelyn's safety, Alexander rose to intervene when a sudden gust of cold air rushed past him.

His eyes narrowed dangerously as Nathan shoved through the crowd with single-minded determination, fists clenched like a man possessed. Alexander's fingers twitched with the urge to tear him limb from limb.

Evelyn blinked in surprise when Nathan suddenly positioned himself as her human shield. "What do you think you're doing?" she demanded coolly.

"Too many people. You could get hurt," Nathan replied stiffly, refusing to meet her gaze.

Evelyn scoffed. "Theodore is right behind me, and this hotel has excellent security. We don't need your heroics."

"You lied to me again, Evelyn," Nathan said slowly, turning to face her at last.

His dark eyes burned with intensity. "Don't you have anything to say about your deception?" His voice trembled with barely restrained emotion.

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Does it sting being on the receiving end? Don't worry, you'll get used to it."

Nathan inhaled sharply, coughing to disguise how thoroughly she'd winded him. She infuriated him beyond reason.

The uproar only subsided when Theodore dispatched a team of bodyguards to restore order.

"Oh my God! You're really Alexa?!" Isabella Wang rushed forward, tears streaming down her face as she struggled to form coherent words. "How is this possible?"

"I never meant to hide my identity," Evelyn explained gently. "These titles mean little to me. I simply love creating jewelry without the spotlight." She smiled warmly at her starstruck fan. "Your admiration means the world to me."

Such effortless grace! Such poise!

"Ms. Carter—no, Ms. Alexa! Please forgive my earlier rudeness!" Isabella was practically groveling, wishing she could turn back time.

Evelyn waved her hand dismissively. "As both Alexa and Monarch Grand Hotel's manager, I understand confidentiality breaches better than anyone. There are no hard feelings."

Now came the moment to expose Cassandra and Penelope's deceit.

"'Celestial Tear' is one of Alexa's most private works, rarely displayed publicly," Giselle declared, fixing Cassandra with a piercing stare. "Aside from Alexa herself, no one else possesses it. Therefore, the piece Ms. Blackwood gave Ms. Wang is undoubtedly counterfeit."

Giselle's voice turned icy. "Forging Alexa's work constitutes serious infringement of her reputation and creative rights. Each piece carries exorbitant insurance. You're not legally ignorant, Ms. Blackwood. You understand the severe penalties awaiting you, correct?"
###Chapter 447

The moment those words were spoken, the crowd burst into shocked whispers, their suspicious gazes burning into Cassandra Blackwood.

Nathan Blackwood's eyes darkened imperceptibly. His expression remained composed, as if he'd anticipated this outcome all along. After all, even he knew securing an audience with the elusive Alexa was like trying to catch moonlight in your hands. He never believed his half-sister possessed the connections to obtain genuine Alexa jewelry. Something about this situation reeked of deception.

A wave of bitter resentment washed over Nathan as realization dawned. He turned sharply to pin Evelyn Carter with a glare that could freeze fire.

Evelyn merely arched one delicate eyebrow in response, studying Nathan as if he'd lost his mind. "What's with that look? Like you want to skin someone alive," she muttered under her breath.

The weight of the crowd's accusatory stares made Cassandra shrink behind Penelope Whitmore, her face turning ashen.

"Ms. Blackwood," Isabella Wang's voice cut through the murmurs like a blade, her eyes blazing with fury. "Have you been deceiving me from the very beginning?" The international superstar trembled with barely contained rage. "Was this your pathetic attempt to manipulate me? To trick me into collaborating with your Blackwood Hotel?"

Cassandra opened and closed her mouth like a fish out of water, sweat beading on her forehead.

"I trusted you implicitly because of the Blackwood name," Isabella continued, her voice rising. "I believed you to be a woman of integrity! Now I question everything about your family's so-called century-old reputation in Crestview!"

The spectators exchanged scandalized looks. "Unbelievable!" someone muttered. "A billionaire heiress caught passing off fakes to a celebrity - right in front of Alexa herself! This will stain the Blackwoods' legacy forever."

"As President of Blackwood Industries," Nathan's icy voice sliced through the tension, "I had no knowledge of Ms. Blackwood's private dealings with you, Ms. Wang. Her actions were personal and do not reflect our corporation's values." His tone suggested he couldn't care less about the unfolding scandal.

Penelope's jaw clenched so tightly her molars threatened to crack.

Evelyn, standing slightly behind Nathan's imposing frame, blinked in surprise at his words.

Nathan's gaze deepened as it settled on Evelyn. "However," he continued smoothly, "regarding the counterfeit jewelry and damages suffered by Ms. Kingsley - also known as Alexa - Blackwood Industries will assume full responsibility."

A ripple of confusion passed through the crowd. The statement seemed straightforward, yet carried an odd undercurrent.

Evelyn's eyes clouded with disappointment as she turned away from Nathan. She'd thought he'd changed. That he might finally stop cleaning up after Penelope and Cassandra. But clearly, he still prioritized damage control over principles. His earlier words about wanting her to win had been empty after all.

"Wait just one moment!" Penelope pushed forward, her face flushed with indignation. "Why are we being treated like criminals? We're victims too!"

She gestured dramatically. "My daughter acted with the purest intentions! Knowing Ms. Wang's admiration for Alexa's work, she went to great lengths to acquire a special piece to facilitate our collaboration! The Blackwoods could purchase ten Alexa originals without blinking - why would we risk our reputation with counterfeits? We were deceived by the seller!"

Snickers erupted through the gathering.

"Listen to her," someone scoffed. "Claims she could buy ten Alexa pieces while holding a fake. The audacity!"

"That's Mrs. Blackwood for you," another muttered.

Finally, Giselle Dubois stepped forward, her voice dripping with disdain. "Everyone knows each Alexa creation is a unique masterpiece rarely available for purchase." The chief assistant crossed her arms. "The idea that someone could casually acquire multiple pieces is laughable."
###Chapter 448

Owning a piece from Alexa's collection was like possessing a rare gem - priceless and irreplaceable. No collector in their right mind would part with such a treasure unless facing absolute financial ruin.

Theodore's lips curled in amusement as he studied Cassandra's furious expression. "You should know better than to trust shady dealers, Ms. Blackwood. Even if you could afford it, Alexa would never sell to someone like you." His gaze swept over her dismissively. "You're hardly what we'd consider... suitable clientele."

"You—how dare you!" Penelope sputtered, her face flushing crimson with rage.

Whispers rippled through the crowd like wildfire. Cassandra's numerous scandals in Crestview society had been the talk of the town for months. Without the Blackwood name shielding her, she would have been ostracized long ago.

Someone needed to put this arrogant socialite in her place!

"Ms. Blackwood," Theodore continued smoothly, shifting his attention to Cassandra, "are you truly claiming ignorance about purchasing counterfeit goods? Or is this another carefully constructed lie?"

Cassandra's hands trembled visibly. She lifted her chin defiantly. "Of course I wouldn't buy fakes! The Blackwoods can afford anything we desire!"

"Hmm... I wouldn't be so certain about that."

Murmurs of speculation spread through the gathering. What hidden meaning lay beneath Theodore's words?

Nathan's brow furrowed as he turned to Evelyn, who had remained silent beside him throughout the confrontation. When their eyes met, her lips curved into a knowing smile that sent shivers down his spine.

She had orchestrated everything.

The puppet master pulling the strings was none other than Evelyn, who had watched the drama unfold with calculated detachment.

"What are you implying?" Penelope clutched Cassandra protectively, adopting the posture of a wronged mother. "Are you accusing my daughter now?"

Theodore ignored Penelope's theatrics, keeping his focus locked on Cassandra. "Ms. Blackwood, surely you remember the artisan you commissioned to create this replica? The details must be fresh in your mind."

Cassandra's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. Every possible response would only incriminate her further.

"Memory failing you? Allow me to refresh it." With a dramatic flourish, Theodore gestured to the massive screen behind him, where a man's face suddenly appeared.

"Bonjour, Tristan." Theodore greeted the man in flawless French.

"Bonjour, Theodore. Bonjour, Maître." Tristan's gaze shifted to Evelyn, his expression sheepish.

"Your craftsmanship remains impeccable," Evelyn remarked without malice. "I recognized your handiwork the moment I saw that necklace." Her smile held secrets within secrets.

Cassandra swayed on her feet, her vision blurring. Only Penelope's supporting arm kept her from collapsing.

With a remorseful sigh, Tristan held up a document for the cameras. "I was paid to forge a piece from my mentor Alexa's collection. Look closely—the client's signature appears right here."

Reporters jostled for position as cameras zoomed in on the damning evidence. The crowd pressed forward, eager to witness Cassandra's downfall.

After several adjustments, the screen clearly displayed an elegant signature at the bottom of the receipt: Cassandra Blackwood!

"What is this?" Penelope hissed through clenched teeth. "You told me Isabelle arranged this! Why does it bear your signature?"

"Mother, that scheming Isabelle tricked me!" Cassandra wailed, crocodile tears streaming down her cheeks.
###Chapter 449

Evelyn's vision swam with fury as the words hit her, her knees nearly buckling beneath her. The white-hot anger burning in her chest wasn't directed at Nathan this time, but at that scheming little viper Isabelle who'd played her daughter Cassandra like a fiddle!

The gallery erupted into chaos as concrete proof was unveiled, transforming Cassandra from victim to orchestrator of the forgery scandal. Journalists scrambled to broadcast the revelation.

[Breaking: Evelyn Carter, Monarch Group heiress, revealed as legendary jeweler Alexa!]
[Beauty fades but talent endures - how many secret identities does the Kingsley heiress possess?]
[Ms. Cassandra Blackwood, third daughter of Leonard Blackwood, dared gift counterfeit jewels to superstar Isabella Wang! The sheer audacity!]
[Investigative report: When will Penelope and her daughter stop their disgraceful antics?]

Cassandra hadn't anticipated being thrust back into the spotlight so soon. Compared to last year's humiliating press conference, this media storm hit with ten times the force.

Penelope saw the situation spiraling and turned on Nathan with venom. "Nathan! As president of Blackwood Industries and Cassandra's brother, how can you stand by while they attack your own sister? I may not be your birth mother, but Cassandra shares your blood! Will you really sacrifice family for some outsider?"

"Outsider?" Nathan's eyes darkened to obsidian. "Who exactly is the outsider here?"

"Who else? That woman clinging to your arm!" Penelope spat.

Nathan's gaze flickered to Evelyn. "She's family."

Evelyn frowned at his sharp profile, thinking the man had clearly lost his mind.

Penelope trembled with rage, bile rising in her throat. "You! You'd abandon all principles for a woman!"

"Better principles sacrificed for love than for greed," Nathan countered icily, withdrawing his phone. "Bring them in."

Evelyn tensed, uncertain of his game.

The doors burst open again. Marcus wheeled in a masked figure whose features remained hidden except for the delicate hands gripping the armrests.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn whispered urgently, fingers clutching Nathan's sleeve.

He turned, something vulnerable flashing in his eyes. "Returning what was stolen from you."

"Stolen?"

The wheelchair occupant lifted shaking hands to remove the disguise, revealing Vivian Prescott's gaunt face.

The crowd murmured in confusion while Cassandra looked as if struck by lightning - her complexion drained of all color, her body rigid with terror.

Evelyn's breath caught as she pieced together Nathan's scheme. Vivian's "vegetative state" after the accident had been an elaborate ruse - a trap laid patiently over months, waiting for Cassandra to stumble into it at her moment of greatest confidence.

The realization hit Evelyn like a thunderbolt. Nathan hadn't just been protecting her - he'd been conducting a masterful revenge plot worthy of the Blackwood name.
###Chapter 450

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, studying Nathan with intense curiosity.

That face... Why does she seem so familiar? Someone in the crowd whispered.

Oh! I remember now! Isn't she that mistress of Spotlight News' director? The one exposed during that scandalous live broadcast?

I'm shocked she's still alive. I would've buried myself in shame by now. How can she still show her face in public?

Honestly, death would be preferable to living with that disgrace. But why is she here?

Vivian's hands trembled as she drew a deep breath. "I've come today to bear witness to a crime, to seek redemption, and to apologize for my actions." Her voice shook. "I owe Ms. Kingsley, General Manager of Monarch Grand Hotels, my deepest apologies. My name is Vivian Prescott, former journalist for Spotlight News. My greed and foolishness made me abandon all professional ethics."

She continued, "I bribed Ms. Kingsley's staff to steal Isabella Wang's wedding designs and sold them to other media outlets. This caused Ms. Kingsley to breach her contract, resulting in the termination of her collaboration with Isabella Wang."

The crowd gasped. No one had imagined the complex web behind Evelyn and Isabella's broken contract. The revelations were staggering!

This is property of N?velDrama.Org.

Sympathetic glances turned toward Evelyn. Being known as Alexa had bestowed an ethereal grace upon her.

To the onlookers, Evelyn appeared as pure and beautiful as an angel. She seemed too delicate for this world - better suited for some sacred temple, far from earthly dangers.

"Ms. Prescott!" A reporter shouted. "Are you saying someone manipulated you?"

"Who paid you off?"

"Was your car accident staged? Did someone try to silence you?"

Journalists swarmed Vivian, rapid-fire questions creating a whirlwind of conspiracy theories.

Vivian closed her eyes, drawing another steadying breath. When she reopened them, her hand rose decisively, finger pointing directly at Cassandra.

"It was Ms. Blackwood who ordered me to do it!"

A deafening roar filled Cassandra's ears. The world seemed to tilt on its axis, her vision blurring at the edges.

Five nights earlier, in a sterile hospital room, Vivian had clutched her sheets nervously. Her gaze flickered to the devastatingly handsome man whose mere presence filled the room with palpable tension. Her hospital gown clung to her, damp with cold sweat.

Nathan sat motionless, his chiseled features unreadable. Oliver stood nearby, his stare like ice.

"Thank you for saving my life, Mr. Blackwood," Vivian had whispered, voice trembling.

"Do you know why I saved you?" Nathan's voice was arctic as he toyed with a silver lighter. Vivian dared not respond.

"Because you still have value to me." The lighter snapped shut with finality. His dark lashes lowered. "One word from me, and you either walk out of here... or never walk again. I could make you disappear entirely."

"Mr. Blackwood!" Vivian had gasped, her body going limp with terror. "Just tell me what you want! Whatever it is, I'll do it! I'll give you everything!"

Nathan's obsidian eyes gleamed as he rolled an unlit cigarette between his fingers.

"Name Cassandra Blackwood as the mastermind. Clear my wife's name."
###Chapter 451

The charity auction concluded with an unexpected twist that left everyone breathless.

Not only did the evening set a new fundraising record for any event hosted by Éclat magazine, but it also became a media sensation due to the shocking revelations that unfolded.

Leonard Blackwood wasted no time dispatching his secretary and legal team upon hearing the news. They swiftly escorted Penelope Whitmore and the shell-shocked Cassandra Blackwood past the gawking crowd and into a waiting car. Their hurried exit resembled nothing so much as rats fleeing a sinking ship.

"Ms. Prescott, I represent Blackwood Industries. Your public accusation of corporate espionage against Monarch Grand Hotels will result in a defamation lawsuit unless you can provide irrefutable evidence. We will pursue this matter to the fullest extent of the law!" The lawyer’s voice was steel, his stance unyielding as he delivered the warning before turning on his heel.

Vivian Prescott now found herself staring down the barrel of a legal battle with one of the most powerful conglomerates in the country. The threat of litigation alone was enough to send a chill down her spine, but what truly terrified her was the realization of Nathan Blackwood’s absolute control over her fate. With a single word, he could destroy her.

Nathan regarded her with icy detachment, his expression unreadable.

Trembling, Vivian blurted, "I—I have proof! Don’t think your wealth and influence can silence me. I’ve changed! I won’t be manipulated into betraying my conscience!"

The lawyer hesitated, glancing uncertainly at Nathan for direction.

Nathan remained unmoved, his voice glacial. "Inform Chairman Blackwood that Ms. Prescott and Monarch Grand Hotels stand against him."

A darker thought flickered through his mind: And so do I.

Even the lawyer couldn’t suppress a shiver at the implication. Evelyn Carter was the heiress of Monarch Group. If this escalated, it wouldn’t just be an attack on her—it would draw in the entire Kingsley family. Her father, her brothers, and the formidable Hartwell dynasty behind them were forces not to be underestimated. Playing with fire now would be suicidal.

"Where apologies are owed, they should be given. But defending lies and tyranny will only make the Blackwoods a laughingstock," Nathan stated coldly.

His gaze swept the room, searching for Evelyn—only to find she had vanished without a trace. A bitter emptiness settled in his chest.

Meanwhile, Evelyn escorted Vivienne Laurent to the underground parking lot, as the editor had another engagement to attend.

"Ms. Kingsley, you were extraordinary tonight," Vivienne murmured, embracing her warmly. "I always knew Sebastian’s sister wouldn’t disappoint."

Evelyn smiled modestly. "That’s only because you’re seeing me through Sebastian’s lens."

"No," Vivienne insisted, sincerity softening her usually stern features. "Your intelligence, your grace, your conviction—they impressed me from the moment we met. I think we could be wonderful friends."

Evelyn arched a playful brow. "Wouldn’t it be even better if we were sisters?"

Vivienne’s cheeks flushed faintly. "Darling, I’ll be fifty next year. I enjoy Sebastian’s company, but I shouldn’t hold him back."

"So what if you’re fifty?" Evelyn countered with a smirk. "There’s a twenty-five-year gap between my father and his third wife, and they’re perfectly happy. Life’s too short for regrets, Vivienne. If you love him, fight for him."

"Alexa," Vivienne said suddenly, using Evelyn’s pseudonym. "Have you ever made choices you regretted? Moments you wish you could take back?"

A sharp pang lanced through Evelyn’s chest, as if a carefully sealed wound had been torn open.

Still, she curved her lips into a knowing smile. "I’ve made plenty of mistakes. But I don’t regret any of them now."

In her heart, she added: I regretted marrying him. But I don’t regret loving him with everything I had.

The contradiction was painful—but it was the truth.

Vivienne slipped into her car, and Evelyn watched her drive away.

"Alexa!"

The call of her name echoed through the parking garage, unanswered.
###Chapter 452

"Ms. Carter! Please wait!"

A swarm of reporters descended upon Evelyn like vultures spotting prey.

Nathan was still handling the chaos inside the grand hall, leaving her completely exposed. Though the journalists meant no harm, their relentless questioning made her stomach twist with pain.

Her fingers curled into tight fists as a cold sweat broke across her forehead. Despite the discomfort, she held herself with unwavering poise, her sharp gaze never faltering.

"Ms. Carter! Will you take legal action against Ms. Blackwood for plagiarizing your designs?"

"Cassandra Blackwood leaked Monarch Group's trade secrets, sabotaging your partnership with Isabella Laurent. Will Monarch and Blackwood Industries settle this in court?"

"Isabella Laurent publicly severed ties with Blackwood Industries. Are you planning to reconcile and resume your collaboration?"

The barrage of questions only intensified the throbbing in her abdomen. Her lips pressed into a thin line, refusing to let even a hint of weakness show.

Before she could respond, a familiar figure cut through the crowd.

Strong arms wrapped protectively around her, shielding her from the frenzy.

Her vision blurred momentarily before clearing—just in time to see Alexander Whitmore's concerned face inches from hers. His voice, smooth yet firm, addressed the press.

"Monarch Group will release an official statement addressing all your questions. Right now, Ms. Carter is unwell and needs medical attention. Excuse us."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Alexander hadn’t been present all evening. How had he noticed her distress?

Memories of the past three years flooded her mind—Nathan’s indifference, the miscarriage, the days she couldn’t even get out of bed. Not once had he shown her kindness. Even something as simple as a glass of water had been too much to ask.

Love revealed itself in the smallest gestures. And Nathan had failed every test.

A droplet of sweat trailed down her temple. Alexander’s grip tightened around her waist, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"Can you hold on until we reach the hospital? Or should I call an ambulance?"

She exhaled shakily. "I’ll live."

His jaw clenched. Normally reserved and detached, Alexander had only ever shown warmth toward her. Seeing her like this unraveled something inside him—an urge to protect her at all costs.

"Lean on me," he murmured, guiding her forward.

The reporters, however, weren’t done.

"Sir, may we know who you are?"

His response was cool. "Alexander Whitmore."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Whitmore—as in Whitmore Enterprises, the billion-dollar empire rivaling Blackwood Industries?

Of course. Only a man of his stature could stand beside Evelyn Carter, the daughter of Fairhaven’s wealthiest magnate and a world-renowned jewelry designer.

"Mr. Whitmore, what is your relationship with Ms. Carter?"

"Are the two of you involved?"

Evelyn’s fingers dug into Alexander’s sleeve as another wave of pain struck. His arm tightened around her, his voice sharpening.

"Enough. She needs a doctor."

Without another word, he swept her away, leaving the clamoring press behind.
###Chapter 453

Evelyn was in unbearable agony. Yet she couldn't help rolling her eyes at the ridiculous assumption. These journalists really lacked imagination. Must every man and woman be romantically involved? Couldn't they just be friends?

"I'm Ms. Carter's bodyguard."

Alexander Whitmore gazed down tenderly at the woman in his arms, his entire world narrowing to only her existence. "And I'm also Ms. Carter's devoted admirer."

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock at his unexpected declaration.

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd as camera flashes exploded around them, bathing the scene in blinding light. These weren't ordinary reporters doing routine coverage tonight. They were completely engrossed, capturing every dramatic moment with feverish intensity.

Without warning, a tall figure materialized beside Evelyn like a sudden storm. Nathan Blackwood wordlessly tore her from Alexander's embrace, his iron grip locking around her waist. With silent efficiency, he began steering her through the chaotic crowd.

"Nathan! Release me! Who do you think you are?!" Evelyn winced in pain, her struggles proving futile against his unyielding hold.

Nathan remained deaf to her protests. His jaw clenched visibly, veins protruding at his temples as he single-mindedly propelled her forward.

He looked positively unhinged.

The spectators exchanged confused glances. So Evelyn Carter had two protectors? But there could only be one man by her side!

Reaching a secluded corridor, Evelyn finally snapped. She wrenched her arm free, her entire body trembling with fury.

The moment she slipped from his grasp, Nathan recaptured her slender wrist, dragging her back against his chest. One hand anchored firmly at the small of her back, pressing her flush against him as if terrified she might vanish.

He hadn't craved anything this desperately in years. And now, no matter how clear his mind remained, his body betrayed him with uncontrollable longing.

"Nathan! Have you completely lost your mind?!"

Evelyn felt utterly powerless. Her breath came in ragged gasps as the searing pain in her abdomen forced tears to her eyes.

"What more do you want from me, Evelyn? What must I do to stop this torment between us?" Nathan's breathing grew labored.

His voice trembled as moisture gathered in his eyes. In this moment, Nathan appeared equal parts enraged, humiliated, and desperate.

"Torment? That's rich!"

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. She lacked the energy to argue with this delusional, mentally unstable man. She was done with him. "Release me, or don't blame me for what happens next. Three... two..."

"Do you truly believe I'm incapable of protecting you? Or is this your way of humiliating me?!" Nathan's grip tightened dangerously, his eyes burning crimson.

He'd just witnessed Alexander Whitmore's public declaration.

His ex-wife. His woman.

Yet another man dared lay claim to her, openly courting her affection.

In that moment, his heart endured agony equivalent to a thousand stampeding horses.

His body felt leaden, as if sinking into an endless abyss.

"One." Evelyn's expression turned glacial as she uttered the final count.

"Evelyn—"

Whoosh!

In the next heartbeat, Evelyn's lips curled in cold disdain. The gleaming edge of a butterfly knife pressed against Nathan's chest.
###Chapter 454

Nathan Blackwood felt an icy tremor course through his veins. Once bound in matrimony, he never imagined they would stand as adversaries, blades drawn between them.

Though the gleaming butterfly knife hadn't yet broken skin, its phantom edge carved straight into his heart.

"The last person who greeted me like this was Julian Montgomery," Evelyn Carter remarked coolly, tilting her head. Her striking eyes held no warmth. "But he had the sense to keep his distance." She pressed the blade firmer against his chest. "Given your arrogance, Mr. Blackwood, do I really need to drive this home for you to understand?"

Nathan ignored the threat, his voice rough with emotion. "What does he have that I don't?"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard.

"Alexander Whitmore," Nathan pressed, stepping closer despite the knife, his gaze burning. "What makes him worth choosing over me?" His voice cracked, raw and desperate. He didn’t care about the weapon or her lethal precision.

"Step back, Nathan!" Evelyn retreated, her grip tightening on the knife as it nicked the fabric of his suit, grazing skin. "Do you think I won’t do it?"

"Is this just revenge?" His stare pinned her, trembling. "Or do you actually love him?"

The blade bit deeper, drawing a thin line of crimson.

"Does it matter?" Evelyn scoffed. "Being with him is no different than being with you. Why the theatrics?" Her lips curled. "Besides, I gave you three years. You’re the one who threw me away."

Each word was a lash. Nathan inhaled sharply, pain radiating through his chest like wildfire. The truth was brutal, and it left him hollow.

"Evelyn!"

Her pulse jumped at the sound of Alexander’s voice. He stood a few paces away, his expression taut with worry.

"You’re still unwell," he said softly, extending a hand. "Let me take you to the hospital." His eyes, always so gentle, brimmed with concern.

Unlike Nathan’s confrontations, Alexander’s approach was different—steadfast care, unwavering protection. A silent promise: I’ll always be here.

"Fine. Let’s go." With a flick of her wrist, Evelyn sheathed the knife and strode toward Alexander without a backward glance. The choice was clear.

Nathan stood frozen, swallowed by bitter irony.

Evelyn didn’t take Alexander’s hand. "Just walk with me," she murmured.

His fingers twitched before he withdrew them. "Of course."

Side by side, they left—a picture-perfect pair—under Nathan’s shattered gaze. Only when the hallway emptied did he finally lift a hand to his wound, his expression twisting with anguish.

Evelyn, all I ever wanted was for you to see me.

Alexander rushed Evelyn to Kingsley Medical Center. By the time they arrived, pain had sapped her strength. She clutched her stomach, her face ashen.

A chronic condition, forged in the crucible of her years with Doctors Without Borders—starvation, chaos, and relentless stress.

"Mr. Whitmore! I’ll fetch a wheelchair!" the secretary stammered, panic in his eyes.

"No need." Alexander scooped her into his arms, cradling her against his chest as he marched inside.

"It hurts…" Evelyn gasped, her body limp against him.

"I know you hate being touched," he murmured, tightening his hold as if to fuse her into his very being. "But endure it just this once, Evelyn. Don’t hate me for this." His voice was velvet, coaxing.

The secretary gaped. Alexander Whitmore—known for his icy detachment—was melting for her. Anyone could see it: she’d be a fool not to choose him.

Hours later, an IV drip finally eased Evelyn’s pain. Exhausted, she drifted to sleep.

For the first time, the woman who distrusted men let her guard down—allowing Alexander to stay.

Perhaps it was their childhood bond.

Or perhaps, just this once, she felt safe.
###Chapter 455

The delicate scent of Evelyn's perfume lingered in the sterile hospital room. Alexander remained seated beside her bed, his gaze never leaving her face.

She stirred slightly, a soft sigh escaping her lips. The sound sent a jolt through Alexander, his fingers twitching with the urge to reach for her.

Over the years, countless stunning women had thrown themselves at him—whether in Serenia or Crestview. Yet the more they pursued him, the more indifferent he became. To him, women were like stubborn barnacles clinging to a ship's hull—more trouble than they were worth.

But Evelyn was different.

Only she dared to challenge him, to act without restraint around him. Even if it meant diving into murky waters, he would follow without hesitation, so long as he could keep spoiling her.

His dark eyes deepened as he watched her. His hand lifted instinctively, fingers hovering just above her cheek—so close, yet not daring to touch.

Then, his phone buzzed.

A message from his secretary.

[Mr. Whitmore, the Kingsleys are here. They're at the entrance.]

Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, Alexander stood and opened the door.

Sebastian, Dominic, and Theodore stood in the hallway like three immovable glaciers, their expressions unreadable.

"Allow me to apologize sincerely, Mr. Kingsley," Alexander said smoothly, taking the initiative. "Evelyn was in severe pain—she couldn't even walk. I had no choice but to bring her here immediately. I regret not informing you sooner."

Theodore's jaw tightened, his knuckles whitening. "Mr. Whitmore, you—"

Sebastian raised a hand, silencing him. His cold smile didn't reach his eyes. "We appreciate you bringing Evelyn to the hospital, Mr. Whitmore. But given that we were actively searching for our sister, and you chose to ignore our calls—even turning off your phone—what exactly were you thinking?"

Dominic's frown deepened, displeasure radiating from him. This man had the audacity to take their sister without permission? Did he think they wouldn’t retaliate?

Alexander merely smiled, his tone deferential. "My apologies. My only concern was Evelyn’s well-being. I wanted her to rest undisturbed. Nothing else crossed my mind."

Dominic scoffed. "And you think we weren’t concerned about her?"

"Of course you were," Alexander replied calmly. "As her brothers, your love for her is natural. And given how deeply you care for her, surely you wouldn’t object to another man in this world who adores her just as much?"

Theodore and Dominic were stunned.

This man was shockingly direct—openly declaring his feelings for Evelyn right in front of them. The Kingsleys were a family of restraint; even Evelyn, despite being doted on by everyone, had always been composed. She had never expressed emotions so recklessly.

If only she had been this bold before—if she had dared to speak her heart—she wouldn’t have suffered so much at Nathan’s hands.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. He had to admit, his father had been right to oppose Evelyn’s association with Alexander.

This man, for all his gentle devotion, unsettled him. There was something unnerving about the way he looked at Evelyn—as if he already considered her his.

"Wait here," Sebastian said coldly. "I’ll get Evelyn."

As he moved past Alexander, he paused. "Mr. Whitmore, our family has plenty of people who care for her. Your assistance is no longer required. You may leave."

Alexander walked away without protest, his expression unreadable.

His secretary, trailing behind, couldn’t hide his frustration. "Mr. Whitmore, those Kingsley brothers clearly have an issue with you. They were practically glaring daggers."

Alexander smirked. "In-laws rarely get along. Evelyn is their precious sister—of course they wouldn’t just hand her over to another man."

"But still!" the secretary huffed. "You used to wield immense power in Serenia. You were practically royalty there. Why subject yourself to their scrutiny?"

Alexander adjusted his glasses, the lenses catching the light. "I had everything in Serenia—but what does that matter?" His voice dropped, icy. "I was born with a silver spoon, yet I spent years alone in that city. People only see the glamour, not the agony. If not for the Whitmores and Victor’s betrayal, the entire Whitmore Enterprises would have been mine."

His eyes burned with quiet fury.

"And Evelyn…" His fingers curled into fists. "She should have been mine long ago. She never should have married that beast Nathan."

The secretary bowed his head, sensing the storm beneath his employer’s calm exterior.

Alexander exhaled slowly, his voice a whisper.

"I will reclaim everything. Whitmore Enterprises. And Evelyn. Both will be mine."
###Chapter 456

The morning light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn stirred awake, blinking in confusion at the familiar surroundings of Fairhaven.

Had she been teleported home?

She pinched her arm sharply, wincing at the sting.

No dream. She was really back in her family’s estate.

Just then, Lillian and Sophia swept into the room, their expressions a mix of relief and exasperation. Sophia smirked, crossing her arms. "Teleport? Oh, darling, if only you had such convenient magic."

"Evelyn, how are you feeling?" Lillian perched on the edge of the bed, her fingers brushing over Evelyn’s hollowed cheeks. "You’ve lost weight again. Have you been pushing yourself too hard?"

Sophia’s eyes welled up as she blurted, "You shouldn’t go back to Crestview, that wretched city! Stay here where you belong—spoiled and adored like the princess you are. Why bother competing with those brutish men? Just name your desire, and we’ll make it happen. Even if you want Bruno served as sashimi!"

Evelyn choked back a laugh. "Thanks, but I’ll pass on the alligator delicacy."

"Sophia doesn’t know how to show concern gently," Lillian murmured, her heart aching. "She adores you. And I… I feel so guilty. You’ve endured too much. How will I explain this to your mother? She entrusted us to keep you safe and happy."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "It was just a stomachache. You’re all overreacting."

Sophia’s eyes widened dramatically. "Overreacting? When you were little, we’d panic if you so much as sneezed!"

"Evelyn," Lillian sighed, "your father stayed up all night worrying. He hasn’t eaten a thing, waiting for you to wake."

Evelyn bolted upright. "What? I’ll drag him to the dining room myself!"

Then she paused, frowning. "Wait—how did I even get back last night?"

Sophia’s lips pursed. "Sebastian carried you in."

Evelyn smiled faintly. Of course, it was Sebastian. Her dependable older brother.

But Sophia’s frown deepened. "Though when he brought you in, he looked… troubled. I’ve rarely seen him like that. What did you do to him?"

Evelyn gaped. "Me? I’d never dare cause trouble for family! You know that."

Lillian and Sophia exchanged glances. "So, he’s upset about someone else," they said in unison.

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn swung her legs off the bed. "Never mind that. I’m going to see Harrison."

In the study, Harrison sat slumped on the sofa, his expression stormy.

Memories of the previous night haunted him—Sebastian carrying Evelyn in, her face pale, her body curled in pain even in sleep. The sight had twisted his heart like a knife.

"Chairman," Quentin ventured cautiously, "have you seen today’s headlines? The internet is hailing Ms. Evelyn as a celestial goddess."

"A goddess?" Harrison scoffed. "More like a troublemaking imp. She won’t rest until she’s turned the world upside down!" He slammed a fist on the armrest. "Why can’t she just enjoy being a pampered heiress? Must she court chaos?"

Camille blinked in surprise. "Harrison… did you already know Evelyn is Alexa?"

"She’s my daughter," he snapped. "Aside from her secret marriage to that Blackwood boy, is there anything I don’t know about her?"

The little girl he’d once cradled was now a force of nature, wild and unpredictable.

"You should be proud," Camille insisted, her cheeks flushing with excitement. "A top-tier jewelry designer! The Queen of Valmont wears her creations. Lillian and Sophia say it’s a legacy to boast about for generations!"

Harrison massaged his temples. "It’s not her talent I doubt. It’s her recklessness. The way she bulldozes through Crestview—she’s making enemies left and right!"

His voice dropped. "People aren’t trustworthy. What if someone harms her before I can intervene?"

The door burst open.

Evelyn strode in, radiant and grinning.

"Hmph! Let’s see which naughty child skipped breakfast. If you don’t eat, I’ll raid your precious antique collection and donate it all to the retirement home—as chamber pots!"

"Evelyn," Camille gasped, "are you alright?"
###Chapter 457

"Don't fret, Aunt Camille. I'm perfectly fine." Evelyn reassured her stunning stepmother while wrapping her arms around her in a warm embrace.

"You two should chat. I'll go whip up some snacks for you." Camille gestured subtly toward Harrison, indicating he was still upset by mimicking horns above her head with her fingers.

Evelyn flashed an OK sign and winked playfully as Camille excused herself. Quentin, ever the tactful assistant, slipped out as well.

"Dad," Evelyn settled beside her father and leaned into him like an old friend, resting her head against his shoulder. "I overheard your conversation with Aunt Camille from the hallway."

She exhaled softly before continuing, "You really underestimate me, you know. My so-called arrogance? It's just confidence. None of those caged songbirds could ever compete with a phoenix like me."

Harrison sighed, shaking his head. "You are my golden phoenix, but those wild hens keep pecking at you. Doesn’t it wear you down?" His voice softened. "Why provoke them? It only gives me more gray hairs worrying about the fallout."

"Wild hens?" Evelyn burst into laughter, her voice as light as a lark’s song. "Oh, Dad, you’re sharper than I am! I might have been a little harsh earlier."

"I just don’t want to see you hurt because of that stubborn streak of yours," Harrison murmured, pulling her into a tighter hug. Then, his expression darkened. "Speaking of fallout—you caused quite the scene at the Blackwoods’ event. As the president of Blackwood Industries, didn’t Nathan give you any trouble?"

Evelyn’s pulse flickered, but she shrugged. "Not at all. In fact, he played his own game in all this." She smirked. "I thought that reporter who exposed Cassandra was just lucky. Turns out, Nathan orchestrated it—he had her brought to the gala."

Harrison’s brow arched. "Oh?"

"He used the chaos to clean up his own mess. That man has more layers than an onion. No wonder he’s kept his throne all these years."

Harrison chuckled, unable to resist teasing. "Three years married to him, and he never outmaneuvered you? Impressive."

"Dad," Evelyn bared her teeth in a grin, fierce as a young lioness. "Anyone who dares cross me hasn’t been born yet."

Just then, Harrison’s phone buzzed. Evelyn grabbed it from the coffee table, her smile vanishing as she glimpsed the caller ID.

"Who is it?" Harrison asked.

Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "Leonard Blackwood."

Harrison smirked. "Ah, your former father-in-law."

"Dad!" Evelyn’s cheeks flushed scarlet—a rare sight for the unflappable heiress.

Clearing his throat, Harrison tapped the speaker button. "What can I do for you, Chairman Blackwood?"

"Chairman Kingsley," Leonard began, uncharacteristically subdued. "I’d like to discuss last night’s… incident."

Despite his usual arrogance, Leonard’s tone was almost diplomatic. "I’ll be in Fairhaven soon. Perhaps we could meet for lunch?"

Harrison’s smirk deepened as he ruffled Evelyn’s hair. "I doubt we have much to discuss. Besides, my daughter’s home—family time takes priority. If you have something to say, say it now."

A tense pause. Then Leonard forced a laugh. "Chairman Kingsley, there’s been a misunderstanding about the auction. That receipt wasn’t signed by Cassandra. It was forged—completely invalid."

"Chairman Blackwood," Harrison’s voice turned flinty, "if you’re here to debate your daughter plagiarizing mine, save it. Let our lawyers handle it."

"Chairman Kingsley!" Leonard’s composure cracked. "You’d really sue over something this trivial?"

"Trivial?" Harrison’s gaze turned glacial. "Anything involving my daughter is never trivial."

Evelyn, curled beside him like a contented cat, felt her chest swell. In that moment, she understood exactly why her mother had fallen for this fiercely protective man.

Leonard exhaled sharply. "So there’s no room for discussion?"

Harrison’s smile was razor-thin. "The older I get, the pettier I become. In business, I’ll weigh pros and cons. But with family?" His voice dropped to a growl. "You touch my daughter, I burn your world down."
###Chapter 458

Overnight, Cassandra Blackwood became the center of a raging storm on social media. Every action she took sent shockwaves through Crestview's elite circles. The most devastating blow? She single-handedly caused Blackwood Industries' stock to nosedive by half a billion dollars in twenty-four hours. A staggering achievement for all the wrong reasons.

The fallout escalated when international superstar Isabella Wang publicly severed ties with the Blackwood Hotel. By noon the next day, #BlackwoodScandal was trending globally, and the company's shares took another catastrophic plunge. The internet had no mercy for Cassandra.

[Some heiresses are born with silver spoons, others with plastic forks. Ms. Kingsley is grace personified—brilliant, compassionate, a visionary in both hospitality and jewelry design. Then there's Cassandra, whose only talent is scheming. Imagine treating Isabella Wang like this during her first visit to Crestview!]

[Don’t insult Ms. Kingsley by comparing her to Cassandra. They exist in different universes.]

[Predictable behavior from Cassandra. The apple doesn’t fall far from the rotten tree. #InvestigateBlackwoods]

[Is there a single decent human being in that family? Someone call the authorities!]

Nathan Blackwood didn’t wait for his father’s approval. As CEO, he summoned an emergency board meeting, leaving Cassandra’s seat conspicuously empty. She’d been "indisposed" since the scandal broke—too humiliated to show her face.

Nathan leaned forward, his broad shoulders casting a shadow over the polished mahogany table. His fingers steepled, his piercing gaze sweeping the room like a blade. "I trust everyone is aware of the disaster at Monarch Grand Hotels’ charity gala?"

A tense silence followed. Every executive nodded stiffly.

"Then I’ll make this brief." Nathan’s voice was ice. A flick of his wrist, and Oliver Sinclair stepped forward, unfolding a document.

Oliver’s voice rang clear:

"Regarding Director Cassandra Blackwood’s gross misconduct, Blackwood Industries announces the following disciplinary actions: Effective immediately, Ms. Blackwood is removed from her directorship, stripped of all hotel project authority, and mandated to cooperate fully with law enforcement. The damages resulting from her mishandling of Isabella Wang’s wedding contract are deemed personal liability. Blackwood Industries assumes no responsibility. All legal and financial repercussions will be borne solely by Ms. Blackwood."

Gasps erupted. Whispers slithered through the room like snakes.

Cassandra was the chairman’s daughter—Nathan’s half-sister. Even if they shared no love lost, this was brutal. The message was clear: cross Nathan Blackwood, and not even blood would save you.

"Absolutely not!" A shrill voice shattered the murmurs. Penelope Whitmore stormed in, diamonds flashing, her face twisted with fury.

Nathan didn’t flinch. "Oliver," he said coolly, "remove the unauthorized personnel."

Oliver moved swiftly, blocking Penelope’s path. "Madam, this is a private meeting. You’ll need to leave."

"Unhand me, you insignificant worm!" Penelope clawed at Oliver’s tie, her manicured nails scraping his throat. "I’m the chairman’s wife! This entire empire belongs to the Blackwoods. Who are you to dismiss me?"

The board members exchanged glances. If not for her declaration, they’d have mistaken her for a deranged socialite.

Nathan’s lips curled into a smirk colder than winter. "Madam Whitmore, there is no such title as ‘chairman’s wife’ on our corporate registry."

Penelope’s face purpled with rage.

Snickers rippled through the room.

"As for Cassandra’s fate," Nathan continued, "the decision is final. Any employee who disregards it will join her in unemployment."

"You heartless bastard!" Penelope shrieked.

But Nathan had already turned away, the dismissal in his posture more cutting than words. The war was far from over—but today, victory was his.
###Chapter 459

Nathan's deliberate humiliation was impossible to miss. The atmosphere in the boardroom shifted palpably as the executives' gazes turned icy, laced with undisguised scorn.

Penelope's fingers trembled against the polished mahogany table. "Even as CEO, you can't override the board's authority! This decision requires the chairman's approval! How dare you act unilaterally?"

Nathan's lips curled into a razor-thin smile. "Ms. Whitmore, are you suggesting the chairman would condone Cassandra's actions—commercial theft, fraud, crashing our stock value by billions overnight—simply because she's his daughter?"

Each question struck like a scalpel, dissecting the truth with surgical precision. The executives' scrutiny sharpened, their disapproval radiating toward Penelope.

Her blood ran cold. The humiliation burned like acid, stripping her bare before these wolves in tailored suits.

"Corporate fairness is an illusion," Nathan continued, his voice cutting through the tension. "Beneath its gilded surface, corruption festers. But as long as I lead this company, those parasites will never see daylight."

Not a single insult was uttered, yet Penelope felt flayed alive.

Silence. Then—applause erupted, thunderous and approving. The executives' eyes gleamed with newfound respect.

By noon, the entire company buzzed with gossip. Employees clustered in break rooms, snickering over the chairman's wife's disastrous theatrics.

"Did you see her storm into that meeting? Even a stray dog has better manners!"

The official dismissal email sparked another wave of exhilaration.

"Finally! That viper's gone!"

"Thank Mr. Blackwood! I'm framing his photo on my desk—our real savior!"

"Cutting ties? More like cutting out the rot!"

Oliver nearly bounced in his chair. "Sir, watching Penelope implode was better than a spa day! That woman deserved every second of it!"

Nathan arched a brow. "Foot massages, Oliver? Is working for me that stressful?"

"What? No! It's—it's a metaphor!" Oliver flailed.

"Has the investigation begun?" Nathan settled onto the sofa, his posture deceptively relaxed.

"Ms. Carter's secretary submitted evidence. The media blackout's in place—Cassandra's finished." Oliver grinned.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. This wasn't his battle; it was Evelyn's. He merely ensured the path was clear.

"Sir, about the hospital... Ms. Carter had severe cramps. She stayed until midnight." Oliver hesitated.

Nathan's jaw tightened. An invisible vise clamped around his chest.

"Should I... deliver some medicine? As an excuse to check on her?"

"Do I need excuses to see my wife?" Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous murmur.

Oliver gulped. "N-no, sir."

"Then why," Nathan said softly, "would I send you?"
###Chapter 460

Nathan's lips twisted into a bitter smile, his dark eyes clouded with anguish. "Isn't Alexander already by her side? She has an entire army of brothers protecting her. Why should I be the one to comfort her? Do I look that pathetic to you?"

Oliver couldn't stand seeing his boss like this. "Mr. Blackwood! Your current standing in Evelyn's heart is precarious! Playing the fool might be your only chance! If you don't swallow your pride now, you'll lose her forever!"

Before Oliver could finish, Nathan shot him a glare so icy it made the secretary choke on his own words, coughing violently.

"We're divorced. Broken mirrors can't be fixed." Nathan's voice was rough, like gravel soaked in poison. "What's mine will always return. Chasing what isn't... that's a fool's errand. I don't regret letting her go. Not once."

Meanwhile, Penelope stormed into Cliffside Manor, her face streaked with tears. She burst into Leonard's study and collapsed against him, her expensive silk blouse absorbing the mess of her crying.

"Leonard! How could Nathan be so cruel? Cassandra is his own sister! Not helping her is bad enough, but to have her fired? How will she face anyone at the company now?" Penelope's voice rose hysterically. "He's turning Blackwood Industries into his personal dictatorship! Ever since becoming CEO, he's looked down on you even more!"

"I gave the order." Leonard pushed her away, irritation flashing across his face. Strangely, Penelope's tears which once melted his heart now only grated on his nerves. He longed for solitude, for the quiet corners where memories of Nathan's mother lingered.

That cold, unyielding woman who never shed a tear for him, never gazed at him with the adoration Penelope showed. His greatest regret was never truly conquering her heart. Penelope had been a balm to his wounded pride during those vulnerable years.

"Leonard... what did you say?" Penelope's tear-swollen face snapped up in shock.

"With this scandal, how could I possibly let her keep that position? If I intervened, what would happen to my authority as Chairman? To Blackwood Industries' reputation?" Leonard's voice turned glacial.

"Which matters more - our daughter or your precious reputation?" Penelope shrieked.

"I'm Cassandra's father." Leonard massaged his temples. "But I'm also responsible for thousands of employees! You can spoil her rotten, but I won't jeopardize this company!"

"Leonard! Have you stopped loving me?" The moment the childish words left Penelope's lips, she regretted them.

"Harrison has made it clear he'll fight for Evelyn to the bitter end. We're looking at a legal war." Leonard stood abruptly, sending Penelope tumbling onto the sofa. "Instead of crying here, go discipline your daughter! I've cleaned up her messes since she was five. She's twenty-five now - when will she grow up?"

Penelope trembled as Leonard's voice turned venomous. "What I don't understand is how Mary's child turned out so capable. Nathan took Blackwood Industries past Whitmore Enterprises - our equal for decades! And your children? What have they accomplished besides creating scandals? Stay home and reflect on your failures."

The door slammed like a gunshot. Left alone, Penelope's tears turned crimson with rage. "Mary... you bitch! Even dead, you haunt me!" Her laughter turned manic. "But it doesn't matter. I killed you once. Now I'll destroy what you loved most - your precious son!"

The memory of Nathan's words at the board meeting earlier that day fueled her fury like gasoline on fire. This war was far from over.
###Chapter 461

Chaos reigned at the Blackwood estate.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter swayed gently on the antique swing at Willow Creek Estate, soaking in the golden afternoon light.

The swing stood empty most days, reserved solely for her use.

Her father, Harrison Kingsley, had commissioned this swing decades ago for her late mother. Legend had it that Camille Kingsley would spend hours here, barefoot toes skimming the grass as she swung through the breeze. Some afternoons, she'd doze off right here, lulled by the rhythmic motion.

Harrison would always be the one pushing the swing. Their silhouettes would dance together in the sunlight, a perfect harmony of movement and stillness. Sometimes they'd simply sit together, wordlessly appreciating the garden's blossoms drifting on the wind.

After Camille's passing, Harrison insisted the staff maintain the swing daily.

As if his beloved wife had merely stepped out for tea and would return any moment.

"Theodore, Ms. Wang has been quite persistent about re-engaging our services." The swing creaked as Theodore Winslow gave it another gentle push. "She's requested a private dinner to offer her formal apologies."

Evelyn took another crisp bite of her honeycrisp apple. "Since she couldn't reach me directly, she's been harassing you instead?"

"Relentlessly." Theodore grimaced, his gaze lingering on the apple's juicy flesh. "My phone hasn't stopped buzzing for two days straight."

"Consider it language practice." Evelyn's lips curved around another bite, glistening with juice.

"You're teasing me again." Theodore's throat moved as he watched her eat, the apple suddenly seeming far less appealing than the woman enjoying it.

"In the past, you would've accepted immediately - business before pleasure."

Evelyn tapped her ballet flats against the manicured lawn, slowing the swing. "But now I'm Alexa. An icon can't appear too eager." She shrugged. "My cameo served its purpose."

"True enough." Theodore nodded. "Isabella Wang learned the hard way that crossing Evelyn Carter has consequences."

"Not everything's about revenge." Evelyn stretched, the sunlight catching in her chestnut hair. "I'm simply not in the mood for her brand of theatrics."

The swing creaked softly between them.

"Besides," she added, "the Éclat showcase was a triumph. Monarch Group can survive without Isabella's patronage."

The universe, it seemed, had already balanced the scales for Isabella's earlier slights.

Evelyn's phone vibrated against the wrought iron armrest.

An unknown number flashed across the screen. Normally she'd ignore such calls, but something made her swipe to answer.

"Hello, is this Ms. Evelyn Carter?"

The name struck like a physical blow, transporting her instantly to another lifetime.

How long had it been since anyone called her that?

The voice unearthed memories she'd carefully buried beneath layers of designer labels and boardroom victories.

"Yes, this is Evelyn."

"Ms. Carter, I'm calling from Mount Evercrest National Park." The man's voice held a familiar warmth. "I'm the new head ranger - Frederick Whitaker's protégé. You can call me Zachary."

He had no idea he was speaking to the heiress of Monarch Group, to the woman behind the Alexa brand.

Mount Evercrest - where fate first intertwined Evelyn's path with Nathan Blackwood's.
###Chapter 462

The first time Evelyn Carter and Nathan Blackwood met was thirteen years ago at Mount Evercrest National Park.

That was the place where Nathan saved Evelyn's life.

"Oh? So you're Frederick Whitaker's student?" Evelyn's eyes sparkled at the mention of an old friend.

"Yes, Frederick is retiring next month. He's doing his final rounds this month. Once the handover is complete, he'll return to his hometown."

Zachary Prescott sighed. "I saw your name in his contacts, so you must mean a lot to him. He wants a quiet retirement, but I was hoping you could visit him one last time. Frederick has pancreatic cancer. We don’t know how much longer he has."

"What? Frederick has—" Evelyn straightened, her heart twisting.

"By the time he was diagnosed, it was already stage four. You know how aggressive pancreatic cancer is." Zachary's voice cracked.

"I see."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "I'll make time to see him."

"Please don’t tell him I told you. He’s proud. He doesn’t want pity."

"I’ve known Frederick for thirteen years. I understand."

After the call, Evelyn sat motionless on the swing. Moments later, tears welled in her eyes.

"Theodore," she whispered, voice thick. "Who is Frederick? What’s wrong?"

Theodore Winslow knelt beside her, pulling out a handkerchief to gently wipe her tears.

"An old friend."

Her lips trembled. "Contact the best gastroenterologists in Crestview and Fairhaven. I want to do everything I can for him."

"Of course." Theodore nodded solemnly, respecting her silence.

Another call came—this time from her fiery apprentice, Rosalind Walker.

"Evelyn!" Rosalind’s shriek nearly shattered her eardrum. "You liar! You’re Evelyn Carter, heiress of Monarch Group, and Alexa, the legendary jewelry designer! How could you keep this from me? I should report you for fraud!"

"You just found out? That’s slow."

Evelyn scoffed, snatching Theodore’s handkerchief to blow her nose. "Since I’m such a trickster, maybe I should prank you more often."

Meanwhile, Penelope Whitmore’s humiliation didn’t end with Nathan. Her confrontation with Leonard Blackwood shattered her carefully crafted image of the devoted, gentle wife.

Furious, Penelope dragged a sobbing Cassandra Blackwood to the Blackwood estate in the dead of night.

"Useless," Penelope hissed, jabbing her red-painted nail into Cassandra’s forehead hard enough to draw blood. "First, you sided with Victoria Sterling because you thought that scheming bitch would be your sister-in-law. You thought you could control her."
###Chapter 463

The slap echoed through the room.

Cassandra's cheek burned as she clutched her face, shrinking back into the sofa. The sting was nothing compared to the humiliation boiling inside her.

Penelope's eyes blazed with fury. "I didn't raise you to be this reckless! Do you have any idea what you've done?"

Cassandra bit her lip hard enough to draw blood.

"You let Victoria play you like a fool!" Penelope hissed. "If I hadn't intervened, your grandfather and father would have disowned you after that disaster at the birthday gala!"

"I'm Father's favorite," Cassandra muttered defiantly. "He would never—"

Crack!

Another slap silenced her.

Penelope's voice turned icy. "You think favoritism will save you? Look at yourself—outsmarted by Evelyn, manipulated by Victoria, and now publicly humiliated. Even Eleanor would have handled this better!"

The comparison to her autistic sister was the final blow.

Tears of rage blurred Cassandra's vision as Penelope dragged her toward the Montgomery estate. The whispers started the moment they stepped through the gates.

"Is that Cassandra Blackwood? The one from the viral scandal?"

"Did Julian Montgomery get her pregnant?"

"Please, Julian has standards. That girl's reputation is in ruins."

Each word was a knife twisting in Cassandra's chest.

"Where is Eleanor Montgomery?" Penelope demanded, shoving past the butler. "Her daughter destroyed mine! She doesn't get to hide!"

The butler blocked their path. "Mrs. Montgomery isn't receiving visitors—"

"Lies!" Penelope's shriek echoed through the marble foyer. "Isabelle set my daughter up with counterfeit jewelry and forged her signature! This isn't over!"

A cold voice cut through the chaos.

"Penelope."

Eleanor Montgomery descended the grand staircase, Isabelle clinging to her arm. Dressed in couture silk, every inch the aristocratic matriarch, she made Penelope's fury look cheap.

Cassandra's stomach dropped.

Isabelle's wide, innocent eyes only fueled Penelope's rage. "Your precious daughter framed Cassandra! That Alexa jewelry was fake, and she made sure Cassandra took the blame!"

Eleanor's smile didn't reach her eyes. "My daughter doesn't need to frame anyone. The truth always comes out."

She glanced at Cassandra's tear-streaked face, then added softly, "Though I suppose some people never learn."

The words hung in the air like a guillotine.
###Chapter 464

The Montgomery household staff gasped in unison, hands flying to cover their parted lips.

Seeing Leonard would undoubtedly side with her, Penelope attempted to shift blame onto the Montgomery family.

All eyes, including a shocked Eleanor Montgomery's, turned toward Isabelle simultaneously.

"Is this true, Isabelle?"

Isabelle's face paled as she vehemently denied the accusations, brows knitting together. "I would never do something so despicable, Mother. Cassandra was the one who suggested giving Isabella Laurent counterfeit jewelry."

Cassandra's face twisted in fury at Isabelle's blatant lie. She pointed an accusing finger and shrieked, "That's a filthy lie, Isabelle! You proposed the scheme to help me win Isabella over while undermining Evelyn in the process!"

"Evelyn?" Eleanor's eyebrows shot up. "You mean Evelyn Carter? What does she have to do with this?"

Isabelle broke into a cold sweat, rendered speechless.

That idiot Cassandra had dragged Evelyn's name into this. Their friendship was clearly over.

"Do you know where you are, Ms. Blackwood?" A chilling voice cut through the tension like ice, making Cassandra flinch.

Julian strode in from the grand entrance, his lips curled in a dangerous smirk.

"I don't care if you want to humiliate yourselves, but don't you dare involve my family in your petty schemes."

"Young Master Julian!" The butler and staff immediately bowed in greeting.

"Julian!" Isabelle's eyes welled with tears as her knight in shining armor arrived.

Julian had always despised Cassandra. Given his unconditional devotion to his sister, he would unquestionably take Isabelle's side.

"You're Nathan's closest friend, Julian," Penelope snapped. "Our families have decades of history. How dare you speak to me this way?"

"My friendship with Nathan is between us," Julian countered, tilting his head with a mocking smile. "What does that have to do with you? You didn't birth or raise him." His smile turned razor-sharp. "You've never shown Nathan an ounce of maternal care, so don't try playing that card now."

Penelope never imagined Julian could be so duplicitous. At the Blackwood estate, he'd been the picture of courtesy, but here, he didn't bother hiding his contempt.

All her social standing depended entirely on Leonard's favor. The moment he withdrew it...

A shiver ran down Penelope's spine.

After twenty years as Mrs. Blackwood, she still couldn't command basic respect.

"Cassandra went too far, Julian!" Isabelle threw herself into her brother's arms. "She tried dragging me into her mess and framing me! You were right about her all along. I should have listened when you warned me to cut ties. I promise I'll never be so stubborn again."

"Is what Cassandra said true, Isabelle?" Julian's voice turned grave as he searched his sister's face. "Did you really commission counterfeit jewelry to harm Ms. Carter?"

"Never!" Isabelle shook her head frantically, her complexion ashen. "It was all Cassandra's idea!"

"Stop lying, Isabelle!" Cassandra's finger trembled with rage as she pointed accusingly. "The forger was Alexa's apprentice from Valmont! Even if I wanted fakes, I'd have found someone local on short notice. Why would I go all the way to Valmont?"
###Chapter 465

Isabelle Montgomery turned to Cassandra Blackwood with narrowed eyes. "You studied in Valmont. Only you would have the connections to orchestrate this." Her voice dripped with accusation. "If you're innocent, why don't we call Tristan Moreau right now and verify your story?"

"Call him?"

Evelyn Carter's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "The fact you'd suggest that proves you're behind this scheme. For all I know, you could've paid him off. This is clearly a setup."

The tension between the two women crackled like live wires.

"Brilliant strategy, Ms. Montgomery," Penelope Whitmore interjected coldly, redirecting attention to Evelyn. "You used my daughter as a pawn in your game against Cassandra. Our rivalry with Monarch Grand Hotels presented the perfect opportunity to destroy her reputation. Had your plan succeeded, you'd have won everything. And if it failed?" She let out a bitter laugh. "You could simply pin everything on Cassandra and walk away unscathed. How fortunate that Evelyn turned out to be Alexa. Otherwise, your scheme might have actually worked."

Isabelle's face flushed crimson, her pulse hammering in her throat. "Mrs. Blackwood, that's a outrageous accusation!"

"Did you really plot against Ms. Kingsley, Isabelle?" Eleanor Montgomery gasped, clutching the banister as her frail body trembled from shock.

"Mother! Julian!" Isabelle stomped her foot in that childish way she'd always done when frustrated. "I have no reason to target Evelyn! Why would I?"

In the past, Julian Montgomery had always caved to his sister's tantrums. No matter how unreasonable her behavior, he'd comfort her and let the matter drop.

But now, the way Julian stared at her made Isabelle's knees weaken, her breath coming in shallow gasps.

"No reason?" Cassandra scoffed. "You're obsessed with Nathan, jealous that he still worships his ex-wife. You can't stand that he ignores you while treating Evelyn like a queen. That's why you want to ruin her."

"But you overlooked one critical detail, Ms. Montgomery," Penelope sneered. "Evelyn matters deeply to both Nathan and Julian."

She turned to Julian with a knowing look. "If memory serves, you once pursued Evelyn yourself. Though nothing came of it, I doubt you'd tolerate anyone harming the woman you once loved."

"Y-You're lying!" Isabelle's hands clenched into fists, her entire body shaking. "Don't listen to them, Julian! Yes, I have feelings for Nathan, but they're divorced! Why would I go after Evelyn? I'm not that petty!"

Julian exhaled sharply, his expression darkening. Strangely, though Isabelle screamed her denials, her words seemed to dissolve before reaching his ears.

As the confrontation reached its boiling point, Natalia Montgomery rushed into the room, her heels clicking urgently against the marble floor.

"The police are here, Mr. Montgomery." Her gaze flicked to Cassandra. "They went to the Blackwood residence first, but came here when they learned Ms. Blackwood was present."

"P-Police?" Cassandra's legs nearly gave out beneath her.

Penelope's face drained of color as she gripped her daughter's trembling arm.

"Ms. Cassandra Blackwood."

Plainclothes officers entered without ceremony. "We have evidence linking you to the Monarch Grand Hotels data breach. You'll need to accompany us for questioning."
###Chapter 466

Cassandra froze.

"Mom! Save me, Mom! Please!"

As the officers dragged her daughter away, Penelope's only concern was maintaining appearances. She rushed forward to block them.

"My daughter is innocent! Are you blind? How dare you arrest someone who's done nothing wrong?"

Julian watched coldly as Penelope and Cassandra caused a scene. He prayed the officers would hurry before he had to endure more of their theatrics.

"Obstructing justice is a crime, Mrs. Blackwood," one officer said flatly.

"Sir, my daughter was set up! Isabelle Montgomery orchestrated this!" Penelope turned on Isabelle, her face twisted in fury.

"W-What does this have to do with me? Even if I forged something, it's just a copyright violation—a fine at most. I didn't leak trade secrets. Your daughter thought she could take on Evelyn. She got what she deserved."

The moment the words left her lips, Isabelle paled.

Shit. In her panic, she'd just incriminated herself.

A cold, piercing gaze burned into her back.

She turned slowly.

Julian's eyes were dark with fury, shock, and something worse—disappointment.

"Your sister isn't the saint you think she is, Julian. She manipulated both of us."

Cassandra's screams echoed through the Montgomery estate.

"Isabelle! You used me as your pawn! I swear, I'll make you pay for this!"

"Isabelle, come here!" Mrs. Montgomery called nervously, her voice trembling as she watched Penelope and Cassandra's outburst.

"Mommy!"

Still dazed, Isabelle moved toward her mother—until Julian seized her wrist.

"J-Julian—" She flinched.

"Why did you do it?" His voice was raw, his grip tightening. "Was this all just revenge against Evelyn?"

"Cassandra made it up!"

"Stop lying to me!"

He clenched his fingers harder. Isabelle whimpered. "Ow! Let go! You're hurting me! Mommy, help!"

"Julian, release her this instant!" Mrs. Montgomery pried his hand open and pulled Isabelle into her arms. "We can talk this through!"

"Talk?" Julian's laugh was bitter. "I gave her chances. What did she do with them?"

His gaze burned into Isabelle's tear-filled eyes. She looked fragile, angelic—but he knew better now.

The betrayal cut deep. She'd lied repeatedly. She'd conspired with Cassandra to destroy Evelyn.

"What did Evelyn ever do to you? Why go this far? Because she's Nathan's ex-wife? Is that reason enough to ruin her?"

"That's enough, Julian!" Mrs. Montgomery tightened her hold on Isabelle. "You grew up with her. You know she'd never intentionally hurt anyone!"

She stroked Isabelle's trembling back. "Even if she made mistakes, that girl Cassandra influenced her. Why drag your sister down? If this gets out, she could be interrogated!"

"You flew abroad on the private jet before Cassandra and Isabella signed the contract. When I asked where you were going, you said Feranco for a fashion show. I had Natalia check—you never went there. You went to Valmont." His voice was hoarse, veins standing out on his forehead. "If you had nothing to hide, why lie?"

He continued, relentless. "When Cassandra was arrested, you admitted to forging the jewelry. What's your excuse now? Do you think Dad would be proud, knowing his 'perfect' daughter is a scheming liar?"

"Julian! How dare you!" Mrs. Montgomery's eyes welled up at the mention of her late husband.

"You're a monster, Julian!"

Isabelle finally snapped. All her pent-up rage exploded. "Evelyn humiliated me in front of Nathan! She made me look like a fool in public! What's wrong with teaching her a lesson? You're no better—defending that gold-digging slut while turning on your own sister! I mean nothing to you!"
###Chapter 467

Isabelle Montgomery sneered at Julian, "Even if you grovel at Evelyn's feet, she'll never look at you twice. You'll never have her."

"Isabelle Montgomery!"

Julian's sharp tone made her shrink into their mother's embrace.

"Even if Evelyn doesn't become your sister-in-law, that doesn't give you the right to hurt or insult her. I know her character. She's no saint, but she wouldn't harm anyone unless provoked—which means you must have started it."

Isabelle's face twisted in fury.

"One more thing—get over Nathan. Anyone with eyes can see Evelyn is the only woman for him." Julian scoffed, his tone laced with dry amusement.

Being Nathan's closest friend, Julian had perfected the art of mocking him subtly.

Isabelle's cheeks burned crimson.

"You're coming with me to see Evelyn tomorrow. You will apologize to her."

With that, Julian turned and walked away.

"Are you insane? Why should I apologize to her? I won't!" Isabelle shrieked, her voice cracking.

"Then I'll have you on a flight to Valmont tonight. And you won't step foot in Crestview again without my permission."

The steel in his voice sent a chill down Mrs. Montgomery's spine.

She had heard rumors about her son's ruthlessness, but he had never been this harsh with his only sister.

Was Evelyn Carter—Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife—really worth this?

"Julian! Come back, Julian!"

Isabelle's desperate sobs echoed through the hallway, but Julian, who had always doted on her, didn't even glance back.

That night, Julian drowned his sorrows at Velvet Lounge, his private sanctuary.

The memory of Evelyn's cold dismissal of Isabelle gnawed at him. The whiskey burned his throat, but it did nothing to dull the ache.

The door creaked open.

"Damn it, I said no company! Get out!"

Irritated, Julian hurled his glass against the wall, shattering it.

"Mr. Montgomery, Mr. Blackwood is here to see you."

Natalia offered an awkward smile before stepping aside.

"My apologies, Mr. Blackwood. He's... not himself tonight."

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "I'm used to it."

"Right this way."

Nathan strode in, and Natalia quietly shut the door behind him.

"What's wrong with you now?"

Nathan arched a brow as he took the seat beside Julian. "So Evelyn rejected you. Must you act like the world ended?"

"Fuck off. Are you going to mock me forever?" Julian grabbed the bottle and took a long swig.

"Rejected?" Nathan smirked, pulling out a cigarette. "She never accepted you in the first place. How could she reject you? You were always the backup—never the first choice."

Julian scoffed. "At least I'm still in the running. You're out of the race."

Then it hit him—Isabelle had called Evelyn a slut.

His grip tightened around the bottle.

If she weren't his sister, he would have broken more than just glass.
###Chapter 468

The insult had come from Julian's beloved sister.

Though fury burned within him, Julian couldn't bring himself to punish Isabelle severely.

The conflict tore at him, leaving him fractured and adrift.

"Are you on your period?" Nathan's voice was cool as he flicked cigarette ash. "You're not acting like yourself. What's wrong?"

Julian exhaled heavily. "The forged necklace Isabella gave to Ada was supplied by Isabelle."

Nathan's expression darkened, his emotions carefully masked. He said nothing.

Julian frowned. "You don't seem surprised."

"I suspected as much," Nathan replied.

Julian's chest tightened. "Nathan, my sister—"

"Since we're on the subject," Nathan interrupted, taking a slow drag, "your sister was also the one who tipped off the press about Evelyn at the charity event."

Julian went pale. His lips trembled before he managed to whisper, "I'm sorry, Nathan."

"The apology shouldn't come from you," Nathan said coldly. "It should come from your sister. She owes Evelyn an apology."

Calling Evelyn his ex-wife still stung.

"Isabelle is twenty-two," Julian said hoarsely. "I know I shouldn't excuse her behavior as youthful ignorance—"

He swallowed hard. "But we grew up with her. She's stubborn, impulsive. She doesn't always think before she acts, but she doesn’t mean harm. Isabella was a bad influence, and I spoiled her. This is my fault."

Nathan was silent for a long moment before cutting to the chase. "So what are you going to do about it? How will you make this right for Evelyn?"

Julian's breath hitched.

Nathan was merciless, unforgiving. He never left room for compromise.

Even if Isabelle was Julian's sister, Nathan wouldn't tolerate her hurting someone he cared about.

"I'll take her to apologize to Evelyn tomorrow."

"Is that all?"

"She's my sister, Nathan," Julian pleaded. "It's her first offense. Can you let this go, for me?"

Nathan stood, his voice icy. "I'll go with you tomorrow."

Julian stiffened. "Why? Do you think I’d side with her and cause trouble for Evelyn? I would never—"

"No." Nathan's gaze was sharp. "I'm worried you might get stabbed."

Julian was speechless.

It stung that Nathan knew about Evelyn holding a knife to his throat.

"I haven't seen her in a while," Nathan murmured, his expression softening. "I want to see her."

He moved toward the door.

Julian stopped him. "You haven't answered my question, Nathan."

Nathan paused.

"We've been friends for years," Julian pressed. "Can we move past this? I'll make Isabelle apologize. The Montgomery Group will compensate Evelyn for the copyright infringement."

Nathan turned, his presence chilling. "Julian, if it were your sister in Evelyn's place, could you forgive such an attack? Would you let it go?"

Julian had no answer.

"We've been friends for over twenty years," Nathan said quietly. "So I won't pursue Isabelle for what she did."

His fists clenched.

"But this is her only chance."
###Chapter 469

For three blissful days, Evelyn surrendered to the comforts of Cliffside Manor, indulging in lavish meals and uninterrupted rest.

Her three stepmothers—Lillian, Camille, and Sophia—pulled out all stops to pamper her. Camille especially took charge of the kitchen, preparing gourmet dishes that made Evelyn's taste buds dance.

The scale didn't lie—three pounds gained in as many days.

"This is ridiculous," Evelyn groaned, pinching her slightly fuller waistline. "I'll never fit into my designer dresses at this rate."

"Darling, diets can wait until after dessert," Camille cooed while Sophia nodded vigorously, already plating another serving of tiramisu.

With Harrison and Sebastian attending a business summit in Serenia, the Kingsley women enjoyed an intimate luncheon free from masculine interruptions.

"Ms. Evelyn! Breaking news!" Theodore burst into the dining room, his usually composed face alight with excitement. "Cassandra Blackwood's been arrested for corporate fraud! Penelope's having hysterics, and Leonard's scrambling to post bail."

Evelyn dabbed her lips with a monogrammed napkin. "Took Crestview PD long enough. Their efficiency pales compared to Fairhaven's force." Her tone carried mild amusement. "Though I suppose arresting an heiress requires... delicate handling."

Lillian piled more food onto Evelyn's plate. "Eat up, dear. Camille's truffle risotto won't reheat well."

"I literally can't—" Evelyn's protest ended in an unladylike burp that sent her stepmothers into peals of laughter.

Theodore's lips quirked at the adorable sight. Instinctively, he moved to pat Evelyn's back. "Easy there, Ms. Kingsley. Wouldn't want you choking on Camille's famous cooking."

Lillian's sharp eyes caught the tender gesture, her brow furrowing slightly.

"While Cassandra deserves punishment for targeting Evelyn repeatedly," Sophia declared, abandoning table manners in her husband's absence, "Penelope should be in cuffs too! That viper probably put her daughter up to it. When will karma strike that—"

"Sophia! Your food's getting cold." Camille's voice held an unusual edge as she shoved a bread roll into Sophia's mouth.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to sapphire slits.

There was history here—something between Camille and Penelope.

Rather than confront Camille immediately, Evelyn cornered Sophia in her private sitting room after lunch.

"Why did I open my big mouth today?" Sophia groaned, slapping her forehead. "I swore to Camille I'd never discuss this with the children."

The pieces clicked. Before marrying Harrison, Camille had worked with Penelope at Gemstone Network. Both rising stars at the time, Camille had been the golden girl while Penelope languished in supporting roles.

"Penelope's always been manipulative and jealous," Evelyn mused, swirling her tea. "I'd wager she sabotaged Camille's career out of envy."

"You have no idea how—" Sophia bit her lip hard. "I can't. I made a promise."

Evelyn leaned forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Aunt Sophia, if Penelope hurt Aunt Camille, don't you want justice? The Kingsleys don't tolerate injustice."
###Chapter 470

Evelyn pressed her hands over her ears. "I don't want to hear this. Make it stop."

Nathan stood frozen, speechless.

Camille had a bitter feud with Penelope. If not for that woman, Camille would never have abandoned her dazzling career at its peak.

The sudden sound of Lillian's icy voice made Evelyn and Nathan jump with startled screams.

"Good heavens, Lillian! Must you always appear like a ghost?" Evelyn clutched her chest dramatically.

Evelyn never acted coy around Harrison, but with Lillian, she transformed into an adorable pouting child.

"Aunt Lillian, what brings you here so late? I wasn't expecting you." Nathan exhaled slowly, relieved it wasn't Camille who'd overheard them.

"I've been standing here since your conversation began. Your voices carried quite clearly."

Lillian glanced outside before shutting the door firmly and approaching them. "There's no use keeping secrets now, Evelyn. Nathan's old enough to know the truth."

Nathan eagerly grasped Lillian's chilled fingers, waiting with bated breath.

"Consumed by jealousy over Camille's talent and fame, Penelope systematically sabotaged her at every turn."

"Despite Camille's immense popularity, she faced constant bullying and marginalization at the network. Then came the final blow - she was drugged and publicly humiliated at a major event."

Lillian took a shuddering breath to steady herself before recounting the painful history in a detached tone.

Evelyn sighed deeply. Normally so talkative, she remained uncharacteristically silent.

"D-Drugged?"

Nathan's throat constricted as she rasped out the question, "Was Aunt Camille-"

"Not that kind of drug."

Lillian's voice broke as she whispered, "It was a neurological disruptor. Banned in Serenia now, but back then it circulated freely in entertainment circles. A recreational substance with devastating health effects."

Both women paled, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

As heiress to the Hartwell pharmaceutical empire, Lillian possessed encyclopedic knowledge of medical substances.

"What happened then?" Nathan squeezed Lillian's hands urgently.

"During a live network special, while performing on stage... she suffered a very public loss of bodily control."

Lillian's eyes swam with tears.

"Damn it!" Fury propelled Evelyn to smash her fist through the vanity mirror.

Nathan trembled violently, holding her breath.

Though two decades had passed, Nathan could viscerally feel Camille's devastating humiliation.

Camille had possessed everything - fame, adoration, brilliance.

Yet her beloved stage became the site of her deepest trauma, forever stealing her confidence and charisma.

"How can you be certain Penelope orchestrated this, Aunt Lillian?" Nathan forced herself to ask calmly.

"Harrison and I uncovered substantial evidence, but nothing concrete enough to legally implicate Penelope."

Lillian shook her head regretfully. "Penelope relentlessly targeted Camille while maintaining an... unusually close relationship with the network director."

"Camille endured hell at GSN, trapped by an ironclad contract. Her only option was endurance. Later we discovered Penelope had instructed her agent to procure the illegal substance before the network special. Yet without definitive proof..."

"That's enough for me."

Nathan closed her eyes. When they reopened, they burned crimson. "If I believe she's guilty, that's evidence enough."
###Chapter 471

Just forty-eight hours ago, Evelyn Carter's journey from Fairhaven to Crestview had been filled with joy. Now, a storm cloud darkened her expression, her lips pressed into a thin, unyielding line.

Back at the Monarch Grand Hotel, Evelyn locked herself in her office, undisturbed by Theodore. She scoured every available record related to Camille Kingsley's infamous scandal.

Lillian Hartwell's words echoed in her mind. The Monarch Group's charity gala had been Camille's darkest hour—yet also the moment she grew closer to Harrison Kingsley. Back then, Monarch Group wasn't the empire it was today. People relied on magazines and newspapers for entertainment news. When the scandal broke, Harrison had gone to extreme lengths to suppress it. Rumor had it he bought and destroyed every magazine subscription in the country that dared mention it. Journalists who reported on it faced swift retribution.

But the foreign press had been present that night.

Someone had captured the entire ordeal on film and uploaded it to an overseas website. Though Harrison had managed to get the video removed, fragments of it still lingered online.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she searched.

Within minutes, she found it—a grainy, decades-old recording of the gala, long buried.

The footage showed Camille at her most vulnerable, hunched over, trembling violently. Her face was ghostly pale.

She was breaking.

The harsh spotlight above her mercilessly illuminated her despair. The jeers and laughter from the audience crashed over her like waves, threatening to drown what little composure she had left.

Then—a tall, broad-shouldered figure stormed onto the stage.

Even from the back, Evelyn recognized Harrison Kingsley.

Without hesitation, he removed his jacket and knelt before Camille, draping it over her shoulders to shield her.

The room fell silent.

The video ended abruptly.

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, shoulders slumping as she stared blankly at the screen.

Had this moment been what won Camille's heart?

Maybe my father wrote the playbook on winning women over.

Her phone buzzed.

Snapping out of her thoughts, Evelyn answered. "What is it, Theo?"

"Ms. Carter, Julian Montgomery has arrived with his sister to see you."

The weight of Camille's past pressed down on her, and the last thing Evelyn wanted was to entertain the Montgomerys. But Theo mentioned Isabelle had come to apologize.

Perhaps watching Isabelle squirm would lift her spirits.

It would be like watching a slapstick comedy.

When Evelyn reached the reception room, Theo approached with a frown.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Carter. I didn’t realize Nathan was with them. He’s inside too."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why didn’t you throw him out?"

Theo winced. "My apologies. He wasn’t there when I escorted them in. By the time I returned, he was already lounging on the sofa with coffee."

Evelyn smirked. "Never mind. You wouldn’t stand a chance against him anyway."

With a tilt of her chin, she signaled Theo to open the door.

The moment it swung open, Evelyn strode in, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor. The sleek black blazer draped over her shoulders accentuated her commanding presence.

"Evelyn." Julian stood abruptly, his throat dry.

She was breathtaking as always—her bold, confident aura impossible to ignore.

Once again, she stole his breath away.

Nathan glanced up, his pulse quickening.

His heart hammered against his ribs.

Hiding behind Julian, Isabelle clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as she glared at Evelyn’s haughty expression.

"Oh, what a lovely gathering," Evelyn drawled, shrugging off her blazer. Theo caught it effortlessly.

She turned to Nathan with a mocking smile. "What an exemplary boyfriend you are, Nathan. Here to support Ms. Montgomery in her time of need?"

Boyfriend? Nathan’s jaw tightened at her sly grin.

She was still hitting below the belt.

But this was Evelyn—no longer the naive woman he once knew. He had to accept her sharp edges, even when they cut deep.

Isabelle, thrilled by the misunderstanding, hurried to Nathan’s side with a pitiful expression.

"Evelyn, I admit I was blind before, but you might need glasses too."

Nathan remained impassive, though his gaze betrayed something deeper. "No boyfriend here. Just your ex-husband. Being your husband was exhausting enough. I don’t have the energy to be anyone else’s."

Isabelle froze.

Nathan had made his stance clear before, but she’d refused to accept it.

Now, he’d publicly humiliated her in front of Evelyn.

"I am here to support someone," Nathan continued, cheeks burning as he lifted his coffee mug. "But it’s not Ms. Montgomery."

He took a sip, scalding his tongue but forcing it down anyway.

He’d had these thoughts before.

But saying them aloud? That was new.

Evelyn frowned.

If not Isabelle, then who?

Julian?

Still a roundabout way to side with her.
###Chapter 472

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smirk. The icy mask she wore began to crack, revealing the irritation beneath.

A surge of anger heated her veins.

Nathan's blatant favoritism toward his ex-wife was signing Isabelle's social death warrant.

Why? Evelyn thought bitterly. A man like Nathan could have any woman he desired - someone as accomplished and stunning as me. Yet he still crawled back to that gold-digging ex he'd discarded.

And the audacity! Evelyn had men fawning over her - Julian Montgomery, that insignificant Alexander Whitmore, and countless others. Shouldn't that at least bother Nathan?

"I only cleared my schedule because I heard Mr. Montgomery was bringing his sister to apologize," Evelyn stated coolly, crossing her legs with practiced elegance. "You should understand - I'm not just the Monarch Group heiress. As Alexa, my design studio receives hundreds of meeting requests daily. I don't waste time on trivial matters... or irrelevant people."

She tossed her hair over one shoulder, the movement calculated. "Had I known Mr. Blackwood would be here, I wouldn't have bothered coming at all."

Nathan's face darkened. "Why?" he demanded, voice rough. "You'd rather spend time with Julian than see me?"

Julian raised an eyebrow, thinking: Well, this is awkward.

Even though Evelyn clearly preferred Julian's company, Nathan directed all his bitterness at him.

"I'll only meet under two conditions," Evelyn held up two perfectly manicured fingers. "Either it's personal... or business." She let the words hang. "Mr. Blackwood, we have neither. Why would I meet someone who's less than a stranger to me?"

The description cut deeper than any insult. Nathan wasn't even worth being called a stranger.

The pain flashing across Nathan's face was merely the surface of his turmoil.

Julian pressed his lips together, mildly consoled that at least he ranked above "stranger" status.

"Get to the point, Mr. Montgomery," Evelyn said, checking her diamond-encrusted watch. "I have a board meeting in forty minutes." Her stiletto-clad foot tapped impatiently, the signature red soles flashing like a warning. She looked every inch the untouchable ice queen from a fashion spread.

Nathan's gaze dropped to Evelyn's delicate ankles peeking beneath her tailored trousers.

His jaw tightened as his mouth went dry. He had to fight the urge to swallow hard.

How had he been so blind to let this woman go?

Now, every inch of her drove him to distraction.

Isabelle played the victim perfectly - pale lips trembling, eyes wide with feigned distress. The picture of innocence bullied by the cruel heiress.

"Ahem. Evelyn—I mean, Ms. Carter." Julian caught Evelyn's warning glance and corrected himself. "My sister and I came to formally apologize."

He continued carefully, watching Evelyn's reaction. "The necklace presented to Isabella Laurent at the auction was procured by my sister. She commissioned a forger in Valmont to replicate your design—"

"Oh, I knew that weeks ago." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand.

Both Montgomery siblings froze.

Nathan merely frowned. He wasn't surprised. Isabelle's amateur schemes stood no chance against Evelyn's resources.

"H-how?" Isabelle stammered, her carefully constructed composure cracking. "When did you find out?"

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "The day you contacted Tristan Moreau and paid him a small fortune to forge my design."

Isabelle's facade shattered. "What?!"

"I understand why you sought out Tristan," Evelyn continued, examining her nails. "I did train him, after all. You probably assumed he left my studio because we had a falling out." She tilted her head, eyes glinting with amusement. "How provincial of you. Just because divorced couples can't be friends doesn't mean mentors and protégés can't maintain professional respect after parting ways."
###Chapter 473

Nathan Blackwood inhaled sharply.

Evelyn Carter's words sliced through him like a razor.

Though Tristan Moreau hailed from a different country, he held deep reverence for his mentor and craft. He would never betray his principles for personal gain.

Evelyn smirked. "You miscalculated, Ms. Montgomery. Your first mistake was assuming everyone is as small-minded as you."

The pettiest person in the room was obvious.

Nathan's lips twitched faintly. His gaze remained steady.

Humiliation burned through Julian Montgomery.

He had braced himself for Evelyn's sharp tongue, but the sting of her words still caught him off guard.

"You're cruel, Evelyn!"

Isabelle Montgomery jabbed a finger at Evelyn's composed face. "You played dumb when I approached Tristan. You knew Cassandra would hand the necklace to Isabella, yet you waited until the charity auction to expose everything!"

Her voice cracked. "All this just to ruin Cassandra. How heartless can you be? Must you destroy everyone who crosses you?"

Isabelle's dramatic wails painted her as the victim.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "What was I supposed to do—let you and Cassandra keep scheming?"

"You—!" Isabelle choked on her fury.

The woman was fearless.

Despite Nathan and Julian's presence, Evelyn didn’t hold back. Did she care about no man’s opinion?

"You came to apologize, Ms. Montgomery, not to accuse," Nathan interjected, his voice low but firm. "Is admitting your mistake truly so difficult?"

He lifted his gaze to Evelyn. "Even if Ms. Kingsley doesn’t deal with Cassandra, I will. I’ll ensure you get your justice, whether your brother intervenes or not. The outcome remains unchanged. What more do you have to say?"

Evelyn met his eyes, emotions swirling.

Nathan wasn’t shielding Isabelle.

Tsk. Evelyn decided his actions were none of her concern.

"Nathan..." Tears spilled down Isabelle’s cheeks, her heartache and rage warring within her.

The man who once held her hand under golden sunlight in the park was now a stranger, his warmth replaced by icy detachment.

Ensnared by Evelyn, Nathan had become a shadow of himself.

"Well?" Evelyn tapped her fingers impatiently. "Are you apologizing or wasting my time?"

"Do it, Isabelle," Julian urged.

"I’m sorry," Isabelle hissed through clenched teeth, barely audible.

"Louder," Evelyn commanded.

"I’M SORRY!"

Julian gripped Isabelle’s shoulders, forcing her into a stiff bow.

Humiliation seared through her.

Evelyn, I swear you’ll pay for this!

"Theodore," Evelyn stood.

"Yes, Ms. Carter?" Theodore Winslow responded instantly.

"As Mr. Montgomery stated, the Montgomery Group will handle the fallout of Ms. Montgomery’s actions. Compile a full damage report—including emotional distress—for his immediate review."
###Chapter 474

Evelyn strode out without a backward glance. Every penny from the settlement would go to Hope Haven Foundation. Not a single cent would touch her hands.

Julian's lips twisted into a bitter smile as he watched her leave.

Her glacial beauty perfectly matched her merciless nature. Evelyn was the very definition of an ice queen.

While Evelyn returned to her office, Theodore escorted Julian to finalize the compensation details.

As Evelyn's legal counsel and personal secretary, Theodore had meticulously prepared the damages assessment. The astronomical sum made Julian's throat constrict.

This was the price for plagiarizing Alexa's designs.

Julian stared at the settlement agreement, his fingers tightening around the pen. The financial blow was substantial, but the humiliation cut deeper.

There had been a time when Julian harbored feelings for Evelyn. Though romance was never in their future, he'd hoped to remain friends. Hurting her was the last thing he'd wanted.

Now, any possibility of friendship had shattered beyond repair.

Isabelle sobbed hysterically all the way to the parking garage, playing the victim with theatrical flair.

"The actual victim didn't shed a single tear," Julian snapped, his patience wearing thin. "Why are you bawling when you caused this mess?"

He stormed ahead, leaving Isabelle struggling to keep pace in her designer heels.

"How can Evelyn demand $100 million?" Isabelle wailed, mascara streaking down her cheeks. "This is outright robbery!"

Julian whirled around, his expression thunderous. "Count yourself lucky, Isabelle. If I hadn't intervened, you'd be issuing a public apology to the press right now."

Isabelle paled at the thought.

"You're grounded indefinitely," Julian declared, yanking open his car door. "No leaving the estate without my permission. Use this time to reflect on your actions."

"You can't do this!" Isabelle shrieked, pounding her fists against the car window.

Julian remained unmoved, staring straight ahead as the driver pulled away. He'd been too lenient with his sister for far too long.

Left standing in the garage, Isabelle collapsed into dramatic tears until two female bodyguards forcibly escorted her to the waiting vehicle.

As the car carried her toward the Montgomery estate, her phone suddenly vibrated with an unknown caller ID.

"Who is this?" she sniffled, wiping her nose.

"Ms. Montgomery." The digitally distorted voice sent chills down her spine. "You must be devastated after today's humiliation. The man you adore won't even glance your way."

Isabelle's breath hitched. How did this stranger know her private affairs?

"What if I told you I could help you get everything you desire?" the voice purred. "Would you be... open to collaboration?"
###Chapter 475

Theodore returned to Evelyn's side after completing his tasks.

"Are you really going to let Ms. Montgomery walk free, Ms. Carter? That's far too generous of you."

He watched with affectionate exasperation as Evelyn knocked over office supplies with her stiletto heels. With practiced ease, he collected the scattered items and tucked her shoes safely under the desk.

Evelyn was immersed in her gaming session, unleashing virtual carnage to distract herself. Her legendary character, Lucifer, had achieved mythic status in the gaming community. Whenever she streamed, thousands of viewers flocked to witness her unparalleled skills.

"Let her off? Please," Evelyn scoffed without looking up from her screen. "I run a business, not a charity. Isabelle's smart - she made Cassandra take the fall. Without concrete evidence, my hands are tied for now."

Theodore's jaw tightened. "This won't be the last we hear from Ms. Montgomery. She had the audacity to glare at you before leaving."

Evelyn's fingers flew across the keyboard. "She'd better come at me with everything she's got. Because when this blows up, she'll wish she'd stayed in her lane."

Her phone vibrated with an incoming call from Sebastian.

"Hey, Bash!" she answered in a singsong voice.

"Are you at the hotel, Evie?" Sebastian's deep voice inquired.

"Yes, in my office."

"So Theodore's with you?" His tone dropped noticeably.

Evelyn instantly understood the unspoken message. Feigning a bathroom break, she rose gracefully. Dismissing Theodore outright would raise suspicions.

Once safely locked in her private bathroom, her voice turned serious. "What's going on? Does this involve Theo?"

"Indirectly," Sebastian confirmed. "Leonard reached out to Lawrence Pembroke for help. He's bailing Cassandra out as we speak."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Of course. Lawrence is her golden ticket."

"Lawrence hasn't lost a case in fifteen years," Sebastian warned. "He'll stop at nothing to clear Cassandra's name. If I were him, I'd start by discrediting Vivian Prescott - she's the key witness."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Vivian's not with me. Nathan has her under lock and key." She steeled herself. "I'll handle this. You and especially Dominic need to stay clear. His government position can't be compromised by helping me. Our enemies would pounce on that."

The call ended with palpable tension.

Cassandra had always been small fry compared to Penelope Whitmore. But Evelyn worried about Theodore's reaction. Her sensitive assistant took duty and loyalty to heart - she could practically see his tearful apology already.

Lost in thought, she returned to her office.

"Evelyn."

The raspy whisper made her freeze mid-step. Her stomach dropped as she whirled around.

The hallway stood empty.

Shaking her head, Evelyn massaged her temples, blaming exhaustion for the auditory hallucination.
###Chapter 476

Gasp!

A strong hand clamped around Evelyn's wrist, dragging her into the shadows.

She collided with a solid chest. The man's ragged breathing stirred the hair at her crown, his touch igniting trails of fire across her skin.

That prolonged embrace felt foreign yet achingly familiar.

Nathan.

His arm remained locked around her waist, protective against the precarious height of her stilettos.

The grip spoke volumes - desperate to shield her, terrified she might vanish again.

"Nathan! How did you—" Evelyn struggled, her cheeks flaming with fury.

"Julian mentioned the security here was impenetrable." Nathan's voice emerged rough and strained. His military training made breaching hotel defenses child's play.

After assuming leadership of Blackwood Industries, his combat skills had gathered dust in corporate boardrooms.

Yet seeing Evelyn required more tactical maneuvering than any special ops mission.

"Skulking around like a common thief?" She ground her teeth, attempting to stomp on his foot.

Nathan pivoted, pinning her against the wall. Their gazes collided, electricity crackling between them.

Now that he'd captured this stolen moment, Nathan drank in every detail of her face.

"Stop staring, you bastard!" Evelyn hissed, her ears burning crimson.

"You've gained weight." His gaze lingered on her softened cheekbones, the sharp angles now gently rounded.

Evelyn's jaw dropped at the audacity.

"Angry? There's nothing wrong with filling out. You were practically skeletal before." Nathan's tone carried genuine concern beneath the teasing. "You should eat more."

A resounding slap echoed through the hallway.

Nathan caught her wrist, the stinging imprint on his cheek a scarlet brand. "Is this how you repay favors, Evelyn? I don't expect gratitude, but must you assault me every time we meet?"

"Gratitude? For what? Restraining Vivian Prescott to testify against Cassandra?" Evelyn's chest heaved with bitter laughter. "You're the one who should thank me, Nathan. Without my cooperation, you'd have lost this game long ago."

"Nathan!"

His eyes darkened to crimson, raw emotion breaking through. "I just wanted to see you."

"And you're the last person I want to see!"

Evelyn twisted futilely against his hold. Outmatched against special forces training, she fumbled for her phone.

Nathan anticipated the move, effortlessly capturing her other wrist.
###Chapter 477

Restrained. Humiliated. Helpless—Mmph!

Nathan Blackwood lost control for the first time in his life. A surge of reckless desire overtook him as he silenced Evelyn's protests with a searing kiss.

Their lips collided, muffling her cries into breathless whimpers.

Evelyn's mind blanked.

Nathan's scorching breath fanned across her trembling mouth. His palms burned where they pinned her wrists, sweat beading on his forehead.

The first time he'd kissed her, alcohol had clouded his judgment.

Now? He had no excuse.

You're divorced, Nathan. This is wrong, his conscience screamed.

Yet his body moved of its own volition. Logic shattered beneath the weight of thirteen years of suppressed longing.

His heartbeat roared in his ears. The iron self-control he prided himself on disintegrated like ash in the wind.

What began as a desperate attempt to quiet her transformed into something raw and hungry. This wasn't restraint—it was surrender.

Evelyn fought weakly, but her traitorous body responded to his touch. His tongue claimed hers in a devastating rhythm that stole her breath and willpower alike.

A single tear traced her cheek.

Thirteen years of unrequited love. Thirteen years of humiliation. Was this her punishment for loving too deeply?

"You bastard, Nathan!"

Theodore Winslow's enraged shout shattered the moment. Seeing red, Evelyn's secretary charged forward, wrenching Nathan away with surprising strength before delivering a vicious right hook.

Nathan dodged with inhuman speed, the punch grazing air.

"Theo!" Evelyn's hoarse cry went unheeded.

Theodore only saw the smeared lipstick on Nathan's mouth—the evidence of his violation. Rage blurred his vision.

"I'll kill you!"

Nathan's expression darkened.

Theodore was a sixth-degree black belt—his spinning kick legendary across Crestview's martial arts circles. He launched a devastating strike aimed at Nathan's ribs.

Yet Nathan moved like shadow. One moment dodging, the next appearing behind Theodore with a pressure-point strike that sent the younger man crumpling.

What kind of sorcery—?

Evelyn recognized the military close-combat technique instantly. Her brother Maxwell could execute it flawlessly.

This wasn't just skill—it was years of brutal training distilled into lethal precision.

"Enough, Nathan!"
###Chapter 478

My arms tightened around Theodore's limp body. Without my support, the towering 188-cm man would have collapsed at Nathan's feet.

"I'm alright, Ms. Carter," Theodore gasped weakly, though his trembling limbs betrayed his words. He couldn't even lift his head properly.

"You can't stand. Don't lie to me about being fine."

Tears blurred my vision as I glared at Nathan, who stood perfectly composed without a hair out of place. "How dare you attack my secretary like this in front of me? What kind of monster are you, Nathan?"

His face twisted in pain at my words.

"He threw the first punch," Nathan defended hoarsely. "And I didn't actually hurt him. The paralysis will wear off by tonight. He'll recover full movement."

"Save your excuses," I spat, wiping my mouth violently with my sleeve as if his very presence contaminated me. "You're just proving what a disgusting creature you are."

Nathan flinched when he saw my tears. The way I scrubbed at my lips cut deeper than any physical blow.

"Admit it, Nathan. Are you regretting the divorce now?"

I watched his throat work as he swallowed hard.

Our eyes locked in the heavy silence, my accusing stare pinning him in place. The unspoken condemnation in my gaze made him shudder.

Seconds stretched between us with no denial from his lips. He couldn't even muster a weak protest.

Nathan clung to his last shred of dignity through sheer willpower.

"Your silence speaks volumes."

Despite my trembling voice, I forced a bitter smile. "But let me make one thing clear - even if you've changed your mind, keep those thoughts to yourself. Bury them where they'll never see daylight."

"Your so-called feelings for me are the ultimate insult to my existence."

The words transported Nathan back to that fateful day when he'd served me divorce papers.

"I'm done with this farce, Evelyn. Every moment in this sham marriage suffocates me."

"Now that Victoria's returning, it's time you relinquish your position as Mrs. Blackwood."

Every cruel word he'd ever spoken to me now echoed back to haunt him.

Nathan stumbled through the underground parking garage like a ghost.

He didn't remember how he got there. His head pounded mercilessly while his limbs moved mechanically, as if he'd battled phantoms.

All strength had drained from his body the moment he saw me.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Oliver rushed forward when he noticed Nathan's ashen face, supporting him anxiously. "Is your migraine returning? Get in the car - I'll fetch your medication."

Pills could numb the pain in his head.

But nothing could heal the agony in his heart.

"I don't understand, Oliver."

Nathan pressed trembling hands to his temples, breathing raggedly. "I ignored her throughout our marriage. Treated her horribly. Yet she stayed. Why? Why does she despise me now when I finally want to give her everything?"

After a long pause, Oliver sighed softly. "Mr. Blackwood... it's because the young madam loved you... loved you so deeply once."

A truth more painful than any lie.

She didn't love him anymore.
###Chapter 479

Once Nathan had left, Evelyn assisted Theodore, whose entire body had gone numb, back to her office.

She carefully lowered him onto the leather sofa, ignoring the perspiration beading on her forehead as she immediately began examining his limbs.

Her medical training from Kingsley Medical Center served her well in moments like these.

"I'm alright, Ms. Carter."

Though paralyzed, Theodore managed slight movements. A lump formed in his throat seeing Evelyn's concern. "I apologize for causing you trouble."

"Don't apologize. You were protecting me." Evelyn knelt to massage his legs, her voice firm. "But never act so impulsively again."

"It wasn't impulsive."

With great effort, Theodore propped himself up. His intense gaze burned with determination. "I'd do it a thousand times over. No matter what happens, I'll always step between you and danger."

"Your bravery is commendable but foolish." Evelyn's voice trembled slightly. "Nathan has four years of special forces training. Today he showed mercy - if you weren't my secretary, he might have shattered every bone in your body."

"Let him try!" Theodore's voice cracked as he staggered to his feet, towering over her. "I don't care if he breaks me! I'd rather die than watch that monster lay hands on you again!"

Evelyn's breath caught as she met his tear-filled eyes.

Unnoticed by Theodore, tears streamed down his face, his numb nerves preventing him from feeling the wet trails on his cheeks.

"Look at you," Evelyn teased gently, reaching up to wipe his tears despite the tightness in her own throat. "My big, brave secretary, crying like a child."

Suddenly, Theodore wrapped one arm around her waist, pulling her close. His other hand pressed against the small of her back as he tried to draw his beloved employer into an embrace.

Evelyn stiffened, acutely aware of the storm of emotions radiating from him.

"Release me, Theodore." She pushed against his chest with surprising strength. "This isn't appropriate."

"Punish me however you see fit, Ms. Carter." His tear-stained face looked younger, vulnerable. The raw desperation in his voice was a calculated risk - shameful, but necessary when facing Evelyn's notorious emotional walls.

Her expression darkened as she pressed two fingers firmly against his sternum.

The still-weakened Theodore collapsed back onto the sofa.

"I know your intentions were pure," Evelyn said, her voice icy despite the conflicting emotions in her eyes. "Starting tomorrow, you're on mandatory leave for one week. Use the time to rest and... reconsider your position."

"Ms. Carter-" Theodore's heart plummeted.

"You've been emotionally compromised." She turned toward her desk, her tone final. "When you return, we'll discuss whether you can continue serving as my secretary."
###Chapter 480

Twenty-four hours had crawled by since Cassandra Blackwood was dragged into interrogation under the cover of darkness.

For a pampered socialite like Cassandra, the past day had been sheer torment. Though they'd provided decent meals,

the relentless questioning had left her with dark circles and a gaunt complexion. She hadn't moved from that chair in hours.

The harsh spotlight burned against her meticulously styled hair, turning it into a frazzled mess.

Pure agony.

"I didn't do it! I never sent Vivian to spy on Monarch Group! This is all Evelyn's doing—she framed me!"

"I'm innocent!"

Exhaustion weighed on Cassandra, but she kept denying any involvement, her voice hoarse from repetition.

Then, the door swung open.

A sharply dressed man strode in, a sleek leather briefcase in hand, confidence radiating from every step.

"Gentlemen, I'm Lawrence Pembroke, Ms. Blackwood's defense attorney."

Lawrence Pembroke?

Cassandra's dull eyes flickered with sudden hope.

He gave her a reassuring smile, his gaze steady. "I need a private word with my client."

Once alone in the consultation room, Cassandra clutched his sleeve, tears streaming. "Did my father send you? Please, get me out of here. I can't take this anymore."

"Relax, Ms. Blackwood." His voice was calm, but his eyes were razor-sharp. "I took this case because I believe we can clear your name. But I need complete honesty from you—no omissions, no lies."

"Of course!"

Cassandra nodded frantically. If Lawrence had gotten her mother out of legal trouble before, he could save her too. So she spilled everything.

Lawrence listened impassively, fingers steepled.

"Mr. Pembroke, can you stop Evelyn? She's vicious!"

Cassandra slammed her fist on the table. "If it weren't for that witch, I wouldn’t be in this mess!"

"Ms. Carter is the plaintiff, Ms. Blackwood. The victim. And let’s not forget—she’s Harrison Kingsley’s daughter."

His tone darkened. "This won’t be easy. Evelyn is relentless. If you walk away unscathed, consider yourself lucky. Don’t push for more."

Cassandra bristled at the reprimand but bit her tongue. She needed him.

"Our key witness is Vivian Prescott. Her affair with Timothy Thornton, the director of Spotlight News, could discredit her testimony."

Lawrence twirled his pen, expression unreadable. "Then there’s Julian Whitmore—he was seen with Vivian before this all unfolded. That’s our best shot at getting the charges dropped."

"Wait… you’re saying we pin this on Julian?" Cassandra whispered, stunned.

Lawrence’s lips curved into a cryptic smile.

"But… would he take the blame? I heard they broke up."
###Chapter 481

"That's beyond your concern."

As the most formidable defense attorney in Crestview, Lawrence Pembroke's success couldn't simply be credited to his family's legal connections. His ruthless precision and meticulous case strategies played an equal role.

Certain victories required... unconventional methods. Necessary evils to secure acquittals.

Despite Theodore Winslow's earnest appeals, Evelyn remained unmoved about revoking his compulsory leave.

She clarified this wasn't a vacation. These seven days were for introspection - about his professional conduct and how he perceived her authority.

After Isabella Laurent's persistent invitations, Evelyn finally relented and made an appearance.

The international superstar shed all pretenses of diva behavior around Evelyn. She played the devoted fan, personally serving drinks and attending to every need.

Evelyn had no interest in tormenting Isabella further. While she maintained her Alexa persona, business came first. Monarch Grand Hotels' reputation and profitability outweighed personal grievances.

Thus, she consented to host Isabella's wedding.

The actress nearly vibrated with excitement.

But that wasn't all. Isabella offered to become Monarch Group's brand ambassador pro bono, plus agreed to an extravagant budget - reparations for past disrespect.

"Ms. Carter, what's this?" Isabella stared at the documents in disbelief.

Evelyn sipped her espresso with practiced elegance. "Your revised wedding proposal."

Isabella and her manager exchanged stunned glances. The turnaround was impossibly fast.

She'd drafted it with record-breaking efficiency.

"This wasn't rushed," Evelyn corrected. "I prepared this version long ago."

Placing her cup down, she continued, "I always create contingency plans. Never imagined I'd need the alternate proposal, but circumstances change."

Isabella's lips pressed together as unease prickled her skin.

"The wedding's imminent, Ms. Carter. Venue preparation takes time. Can we manage this?" The manager fretted.

Evelyn's smile held secrets. "You admire gothic aesthetics, correct? How do you feel about black roses?"

"Black roses?" Isabella's squeal could shatter crystal.

"The current venue features excessive red roses. Replacing them with Ecuadorian black roses would be more... efficient." Evelyn's eyes gleamed.

Isabella flushed with exhilaration.

The initial proposal had pleased her, but this? This was her fantasy wedding realized.

Black roses symbolized obsession, mystery, and eternal devotion.

A macabre romance dripping with dark charm.

"Aren't those... funeral flowers?" The manager ventured timidly.

Evelyn knew the visuals would ignite social media.

A celebrity wedding of this caliber would dominate headlines for weeks.

While profits mattered, her true aim was catapulting Monarch Grand Hotels onto the global stage.

The manager suspected Isabella was merely a pawn in this ambition.
###Chapter 482

"Am I the one getting married here, or are you?" Evelyn shot her agent a withering glare. "I'm discussing business with Ms. Laurent. It's incredibly rude to interrupt."

Isabella flushed crimson, turning to her agent. "I chose to work with Ms. Carter precisely because I trust her judgment completely."

"I fully intend to follow her recommendations, so kindly keep your opinions to yourself."

After finalizing the new contract with Isabella, Evelyn delegated her team to escort the celebrity's entourage out. She quickly briefed her staff on the assignment details before heading home for the evening.

Sebastian's Rolls Royce was idling at the office entrance. The chauffeur opened the door with practiced elegance.

"Seb! What's the occasion?" Evelyn slid into the plush leather seat and immediately wrapped her arms around her brother's neck.

"I heard you gave Theodore an entire week off." Sebastian absently stroked her hair.

"Yes. He's been working nonstop lately. The break is well-deserved."

"Is that so?"

Sebastian's eyes narrowed with knowing amusement. "Trouble seems to follow you everywhere these days, and yet you dismiss your most capable assistant when you need him most. Did you two have a lovers' quarrel?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "What exactly are you implying? We're not involved like that. Where did you get such an absurd idea?"

"Ah, so the poor fellow's affections remain unrequited then."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Sebastian Kingsley, explain yourself this instant!"

"Theodore's feelings for you are painfully obvious to everyone," Sebastian remarked with a knowing smile.

"Everyone?"

"Aunt Lillian too. She mentioned it to me recently - said she couldn't bring herself to tell you directly."

Evelyn fell silent, mortified. Apparently the entire world had noticed Theodore's crush except her.

As if the situation wasn't awkward enough already.

"Aunt Lillian worries his feelings might complicate your professional relationship, especially since you're living together at Crestview. She's not comfortable with the arrangement," Sebastian said, squeezing his sister's hand.

Lillian's concern stemmed from genuine care - she viewed Evelyn as her own daughter.

In Lillian's mind, there was always the risk Theodore might act on his desires when emotions ran high.

"I trust Theodore completely. He would never cross that line," Evelyn said firmly. "But I need to know why you suddenly granted him leave."

"Truthfully? I'm giving him space to reconsider his position."

Evelyn didn't need her brother's protection. Her expression turned serious. "I became aware of his feelings, so I insisted on this break. It's a reality check."

"If he can't move past this, I can't keep him as my assistant."

Sebastian frowned. "That's rather harsh. You'd really let him go over this?"

"It's for his own good."

Evelyn sighed heavily. "Romance isn't in the cards for me anymore. Nothing could ever happen between us. It would only cause him pain to remain close, knowing his feelings can't be returned." Her voice softened. "I know the agony of loving someone you can't have. I won't let people I care about suffer that way. Theodore deserves better than pining after me."

Sebastian pulled his sister into a comforting embrace.

His phone chose that moment to ring.

Keeping one arm around Evelyn, he answered curtly, "Yes?"

"Mr. Kingsley, Cassandra Blackwood has been released without charges. Lawrence Pembroke secured her release."
###Chapter 483

Evelyn Carter finally breathed the sweet air of freedom after three agonizing days in police custody.

Lawrence Pembroke had ordered Leonard Blackwood to suppress all media coverage, but Nathan Blackwood discovered the truth immediately.

"How did Cassandra walk away unscathed?" Nathan's knuckles turned white against the car window. "I thought we had eyes on Vivian Prescott. Did Lawrence make contact?"

"Mr. Blackwood," his assistant hesitated, "the problem isn't Vivian. It's Julian Whitmore."

The explanation was obvious. Lawrence had undoubtedly uncovered compromising information about Julian and threatened his family's safety.

The ruthless attorney had no moral boundaries when it came to winning cases.

Nathan's jaw clenched violently. "Walter Pembroke's reputation as an impartial judge is being destroyed by his eldest son." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "With Julian taking the fall, Vivian might be—"

A ringing phone cut through the tension.

"What now?" Nathan snapped.

After a brief conversation, his assistant turned pale. "Bad news, sir. The police just arrested Vivian for defamation and evidence tampering."

The expected outcome still sent Nathan into a rage.

Vivian had brought this upon herself.

Yet the injustice burned in Nathan's chest.

Meanwhile, tears streamed down Cassandra's face during the drive back to Cliffside Manor, overwhelmed by her narrow escape.

Penelope Whitmore rushed to embrace her daughter, their dramatic reunion playing out perfectly for Leonard and Reginald Blackwood.

Years ago, Penelope couldn't act to save her life. Now, performance was second nature to her.

"Mom! Dad!" Cassandra wailed. "You have to make them pay! Evelyn and Isabelle Montgomery destroyed me!"

Never missing an opportunity to slander Evelyn, Cassandra collapsed dramatically before Reginald's wheelchair. "Grandfather, Evelyn is trying to ruin our family. She's manipulative and cruel. If Mr. Pembroke hadn't intervened, you'd never see me again!"

Reginald's expression darkened with conflict.

He refused to believe his beloved "Anna" could be the monster Cassandra described. Yet the police reports confirmed Evelyn had filed charges against Cassandra.

Once again, Reginald found himself trapped between loyalty and truth.

The last time he'd faced such a dilemma was during Blackwood Industries' aggressive expansion twenty years earlier.

In their ruthless market domination, Reginald's sons Leonard and Gary became entangled in a bribery scandal. Due to Reginald's favoritism toward his frail eldest son, Gary took full blame and received a four-year sentence.

The family's shame became unbearable when Gary died of a heart attack in prison after just six months.

The tragedy destroyed Reginald's wife Deborah, who never recovered from the grief.

"Grandfather, I warned you about Evelyn's true nature," Cassandra sobbed against his knee. "Her kindness is just an act. She's probably scheming to steal your company shares!"

Penelope nodded vehemently. "She's right, Reginald."
###Chapter 484

Penelope stirred the pot viciously, twisting facts about Evelyn. She deliberately concealed that Evelyn was Harrison Kingsley's daughter from the beginning.

She gained your trust just to marry Nathan. Think about it. That was her scheme all along. We're fortunate Nathan saw through her and divorced her before any real damage occurred.

If Evelyn had secured Nathan's affection and your confidence, she would've seized control of Blackwood Industries by now.

"Enough!" Reginald waved his arm impatiently. "Evelyn isn't that kind of woman."

He continued firmly, "Besides, I know Harrison. He might be a playboy, but he's a principled gentleman. I refuse to believe he'd raise a dishonorable daughter."

"Father!"

"Grandfather!"

Reginald added pointedly, "The Kingsleys possess wealth and influence comparable to ours. Ms. Kingsley wouldn't throw away her marriage for some company shares."

He scoffed, "That's the sort of tasteless behavior I'd expect from Victoria Sterling, but Ms. Kingsley? She has everything. She wouldn't stoop so low."

Penelope's face twisted in fury, her fingers itching to overturn the old man's wheelchair.

Gregory interjected coldly, "Regardless, Ms. Kingsley has shown hostility toward Blackwood Industries."

Though aware his daughter was the instigator, Gregory wouldn't admit his parenting failures to Reginald.

Defiantly, he stated, "Even with our internal disputes, Evelyn has no right to interfere. She's leveraged her family's power against us repeatedly - first targeting Penelope, now trying to imprison Cassandra over trivial matters."

"She's clearly declaring war. Since returning to her family, Ms. Kingsley has changed. She'll prioritize her family's interests over her relationship with you."

Reginald's grip tightened on his wheelchair arms as he breathed heavily.

"Marcus, summon Evelyn immediately. I want to hear her explanation myself."

Meanwhile, Nathan's car pulled up at Cliffside Manor's driveway. Oliver opened the door promptly.

As Nathan stepped out indifferently, a sleek Maserati parked beside him.

Lawrence Pembroke emerged, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan smirked coldly. "Chairman Blackwood must've gotten himself into serious trouble to require your services at this hour, Mr. Pembroke. Cleaning up his messes again?"

Lawrence maintained his composure. "Chairman Blackwood retained me as Ms. Cassandra's defense attorney. I take my professional responsibilities seriously."

He added pointedly, "But I suppose legal ethics aren't your expertise, Mr. Blackwood. Understandable, given our different professions."

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously as he advanced on Lawrence.

The lawyer instinctively retreated, immediately regretting the show of weakness.

"The legal field has its shadows," Nathan said icily. "While some lawyers champion the underprivileged, others like you serve corporate interests without scruples."

Lawrence's smile stiffened.

"I won't interfere with your ambitions," Nathan continued, his piercing gaze making Lawrence shudder. "But heed this warning - you may play your ruthless games, but Evelyn Kingsley is off-limits."

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "She's important to me. Harm her, and I'll return the favor tenfold."
###Chapter 485

Nathan delivered his cutting remarks with icy precision before turning on his heel and striding away.

Lawrence remained frozen in place, his entire body rigid with humiliation.

Coming from a prestigious legal dynasty where his father served as a Supreme Court justice, Lawrence had always been the golden child. His brothers worshipped the ground he walked on while his parents expected nothing less than perfection.

Success came effortlessly to him. By thirty, he'd become the most sought-after attorney in Crestview, with corporate titans groveling for his counsel.

Never in his privileged life had he been so thoroughly insulted.

Wait a minute.

Lawrence's brow furrowed as he watched Nathan's retreating figure with narrowed eyes.

Something didn't add up about Nathan's relationship with Evelyn. The famously aloof Nathan Blackwood losing his temper over a woman? Unheard of.

Evelyn was Harrison Kingsley's daughter - a fact Lawrence knew well. A woman of her caliber wouldn't settle for anything less than perfection in a partner.

There was only one logical explanation: Nathan harbored feelings for Evelyn, though she was clearly out of his league.

So what if the man had striking features?

Nathan's mother had died without ever marrying his father. His current position as CEO of Blackwood Industries was nothing more than a pity appointment from Reginald.

Lawrence's lips curled into a sneer. "For all your wealth and fancy titles, you're still a bastard, Nathan Blackwood. Delusional to think you're worthy of Ms. Kingsley."

With renewed confidence, Lawrence entered the VIP lounge wearing a mask of charm.

The assembled guests blinked in surprise when Lawrence appeared moments after Nathan.

"Father, this is Lawrence Pembroke," Leonard announced enthusiastically. "Mr. Pembroke was instrumental in securing Cassandra's release. I was thinking of appointing him as head of our corporate legal division. What do you think?"

"Reginald Blackwood, what an honor." Lawrence offered a perfectly calibrated smile. "I've long admired your accomplishments."

"Lawrence Pembroke?" Reginald studied him with piercing eyes. "Walter Pembroke's eldest boy?"

"Yes, sir. Justice Pembroke is my father." Lawrence's chest swelled with pride. "Were you and my father acquainted?"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the familiar exchange.

He despised pretentious social climbers like Lawrence. But Reginald clearly knew the Pembroke patriarch.

"We've met." Reginald's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Your father presided over my youngest son Gary's trial. Such a fair judge - gave my boy four years in prison."

The room went deathly silent.

Lawrence's carefully constructed composure shattered as the blood drained from his face.

Leonard flinched as dark memories resurfaced, his expression turning grim. Nathan noted his father's reaction with interest.

"My father takes his judicial duties seriously," Lawrence stammered. "On his behalf, I'd like to—"

"Apologize?" Reginald cut him off with an arched brow. "Did your father make an error in judgment? Why would his son need to apologize for a judge doing his job properly?"

Lawrence opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water.

"A judge's duty is to be impartial," Reginald continued smoothly. "By apologizing, are you suggesting your father abused his authority?"

"You misunderstand, Mr. Blackwood," Lawrence forced a laugh that came out strangled. "I merely meant—"

"I know exactly what you meant." Reginald's voice turned glacial. "I've heard all about you, boy. How you specialize in helping wealthy clients evade justice. Frankly, I never would have guessed you were Walter's son. You're nothing like him."
###Chapter 486

The biting sarcasm in those words was impossible to miss!

Wasn't this a direct challenge to Lawrence's integrity?

Nathan couldn't suppress a faint smirk, while Leonard and Penelope's faces darkened immediately.

Grandfather Reginald!

At that moment, Reginald's assistant Marcus Underwood rushed in. "Ms. Kingsley has arrived."

Nathan's heart skipped a beat, his eyes widening involuntarily.

All eyes turned toward the entrance with complex expressions.

Click. Click. Click.

The sharp staccato of designer heels against marble floors seemed to pierce straight through Nathan's chest.

Evelyn entered the grand hall where she'd once lived for three years, yet the regal, icy aura surrounding her now made it seem like her first visit.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan felt suspended in time.

As if their divorce papers had never been signed.

"Grandfather Reginald, I'm here!"

Evelyn's radiant smile was reserved solely for the patriarch as she glided past everyone without a glance.

When she passed Nathan, there wasn't the slightest hesitation in her stride—as though they were perfect strangers.

Nathan inhaled sharply, his hands clenching into unseen fists. His pulse hammered violently even as his heart sank like a stone.

Every encounter with his ex-wife since the divorce felt like exquisite torture, leaving him emotionally ravaged.

"Evelyn Kingsley!"

Cassandra practically vibrated with rage at Evelyn's flawless appearance. Only Penelope's restraining grip prevented her from launching herself at Evelyn right then.

"Oh, Law! What a pleasant surprise!"

Evelyn paused unexpectedly when passing Lawrence, her smile taking on a knowing edge.

Lawrence stiffened visibly.

The entire room seemed to hold its breath.

"Law?" The intimate nickname made everyone question the nature of their relationship.

"Ms. Kingsley, it's been some time." Lawrence forced a polite smile, deliberately using formal address.

"Indeed. Five or six years since you last visited my father, wasn't it? He mentioned you recently." Evelyn's gaze slid meaningfully to Leonard's shocked expression. "Our families go way back, Chairman Blackwood. I remember Uncle Walter bringing you and Gregory to our estate when we were children. Pity we lost touch over the years."

Lawrence's smile grew strained, his ears burning crimson.

Evelyn's casual words wrapped around his throat like invisible nooses!

The last thing he wanted publicized was his family's past reliance on the Kingsleys. He barely admitted to himself that his current status was built on their patronage.

Lawrence craved true power—to expand his influence and elevate his family's standing. To do that, he needed to escape the Kingsleys' long shadow.

"Mr. Pembroke, I wasn't aware you were so... acquainted with the Kingsleys," Leonard remarked pointedly.

"My father briefly served as legal counsel for Monarch Group, but that ended years ago. We've had no contact since," Lawrence hurried to clarify, putting deliberate distance between their families.

"Law—no, Mr. Pembroke."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed, her smile frosting over. "Surely you recall the difficulties your family faced when Uncle Walter retired from the bench. Without my father's intervention..." She let the implication hang. "We've never sought repayment for that kindness. But collaborating with outsiders against me?"

Her crimson lips curved into a glacial smile. "Is ingratitude part of your legal code of ethics now?"
###Chapter 487

Evelyn's piercing interrogation had torn away Lawrence's carefully constructed facade, exposing his ingratitude for all to see.

She smirked inwardly. Didn't you want to sever ties with the Kingsleys? Fine. I'll drag out every skeleton you tried to bury and parade your darkest thoughts before everyone!

Lawrence's lips formed a thin line. Though his mouth still curved in a practiced smile, his gaze toward Evelyn turned glacial.

This was the woman Theodore had been so infatuated with? A venomous, sharp-tongued vixen! If his brother had married such a troublesome creature, would their family ever know peace again?

The air grew thick with tension.

Leonard Blackwood decided Evelyn Kingsley was his personal nemesis. Every encounter with her inevitably led to disaster.

Lawrence's legal prowess was undeniable. Leonard had long wanted to recruit him, but this unexpected connection to the Kingsleys made his skin crawl.

"So Mr. Pembroke shares such... history with the Kingsleys," Nathan remarked, his penetrating stare never leaving Evelyn even as he addressed Lawrence. "And Ms. Kingsley happens to be your benefactor's daughter. Is this how you repay kindness - by constantly antagonizing her?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed at Nathan's words.

Was he... defending her? Taking her side against his own family? He'd never done that during their marriage. Was this some belated attempt at reconciliation?

Absolutely unnecessary! The man must have lost his mind!

Reginald's frown deepened at the exchange.

"Ha! So according to you, Ms. Kingsley, I shouldn't practice law simply because my family received yours' kindness?" Lawrence countered with saccharine sharpness. "I'm a professional. In my world, there are only clients and non-clients. Since Ms. Cassandra Blackwood is my client, naturally I'll give her my best."

He flashed a razor-thin smile. "There's no conflict here. Were you to hire me, Ms. Kingsley, I'd serve you with equal dedication. This has nothing to do with repaying debts, wouldn't you agree?"

Nathan's fist clenched at Lawrence's smug expression, his eyes darkening.

"Oh heavens! I wouldn't dare employ such an illustrious attorney as yourself!" Evelyn gasped dramatically, waving her hands in mock horror. "A double-edged sword like you - today fighting my case, tomorrow helping others sue me!"

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "You show no regard for my family despite my father saving yours. What worth does a mere woman like me hold in your esteemed eyes? If someone paid you to destroy me, wouldn't you do so enthusiastically? I simply couldn't afford such... distinguished services!"

Even Evelyn cringed at her own theatrics.

Victoria Sterling herself would have applauded this performance.

Nathan's lips twitched despite himself at Evelyn's deceptively sweet venom.

Lawrence coughed, his chest burning with suppressed rage.

Cassandra had hoped to leverage home advantage and Lawrence's presence to humiliate Evelyn. Even a minor victory would have soothed her wounded pride.
###Chapter 488

In the end, even Lawrence had to concede defeat against Evelyn's razor-sharp retorts. Cassandra didn't dare provoke further and cowered behind Penelope like a frightened turtle retreating into its shell.

"Grandfather Reginald!"

Evelyn moved gracefully to Reginald's side, taking his weathered hand in hers. Concern shadowed her delicate features.

Their bond appeared far stronger than Cassandra's with the old patriarch. "Did you summon me so late because you're unwell?"

"Don't fret, my dear. I'm perfectly fine."

Reginald's aged eyes softened as they met her clear gaze, his fingers giving hers an affectionate pat. "See? Still in excellent health."

Evelyn exhaled in visible relief. "Thank goodness."

"Evelyn, truthfully, I called you here tonight for no urgent matter." Reginald's voice turned earnest. "I simply missed you and wished to see you. But I must ask—what truly transpired between you and Cassandra? How did matters escalate to this degree?"

His wrinkled face creased with worry. "You're both my granddaughters. I only wish for harmony between you. These constant conflicts weigh heavily on my heart."

Yet Evelyn understood—this was Grandfather Reginald's gentle way of advocating for his blood granddaughter, Cassandra.

An unexpected sting pierced her nose, her throat tightening.

No matter how devotedly she cared for Reginald, blood ties ran deeper. Even when the so-called "obedient granddaughter" he referenced was a venomous schemer who'd betrayed her repeatedly.

Those two days Cassandra spent detained had been pure torment!

Penelope seized the moment to wail dramatically, clutching a weeping Cassandra. "They subjected your precious granddaughter to twenty-four hour interrogations! Threats! Verbal abuse! Sleep deprivation! Look how they've brutalized her!"

Indeed, Cassandra appeared markedly haggard, her tear-streaked face invoking pity.

Reginald had doted on his eldest granddaughter since childhood. Though Cassandra lacked Evelyn's brilliance and charm, rarely visiting after adulthood, she remained his flesh and blood. At his age, family peace was all he desired.

When Nathan noticed Evelyn's eyes reddening, her usual vibrancy dimmed, an unfamiliar ache gripped his chest.

She was hurting.

Memories surfaced—how during their three-year marriage, she'd always been an outsider in Cliffside Manor. Back then, he'd been deliberately inconsiderate, hoping she'd surrender and request divorce.

History seemed to repeat itself tonight.

But this time, Nathan wouldn't repeat past mistakes.

With icy determination darkening his gaze, he strode to his grandfather's side. The room collectively held its breath as he performed his next shocking act.

In one fluid motion, Nathan's muscular arm encircled Evelyn's shoulders, pulling her firmly against him with possessive certainty—as if she'd never ceased being his wife.

Evelyn gaped up at him, frozen.

"Nathan, what—"

"Grandfather."

Nathan silenced her protest, his large hand anchoring her in place. "Rather than interrogating Ms. Carter, perhaps you should demand what your precious Cassandra has done this time."
###Chapter 489

Evelyn could feel the scorching heat of Nathan's palm searing through her skin.

Insane maniac!

What demon had possessed him this time? She desperately wanted those filthy hands off her body.

As if sensing her struggle, Nathan tightened his grip until his fingers dug painfully into her shoulder. He was forcing their proximity with brutal determination.

The gathered crowd gasped at the sight of the divorced couple pressed so intimately together.

Only Reginald beamed with delighted surprise, his earlier melancholy vanishing instantly.

Ah! Had Evelyn reconciled with Nathan? Though her expression looked anything but pleased... No matter! Even if Nathan was being domineering, at least my stone-hearted grandson is finally taking action! This calls for fireworks!

Evelyn's patience snapped. While everyone was distracted, she slowly raised her foot—then slammed her stiletto heel down with vicious precision.

Ugh! Nathan's jaw clenched as a muffled grunt escaped him, audible only to Evelyn.

A wicked smile curled her lips as she twisted her heel mercilessly into his handmade Italian loafers.

Much better.

Nathan's lips trembled from the agony, his soul nearly leaving his body from the excruciating pain.

Gritting his teeth, he turned his smoldering gaze to the satisfied woman in his arms.

Strangely, his frown softened. Did tormenting him bring her such joy? If so, he'd gladly endure it again.

"Grandfather! I'm being framed!"

Cassandra panicked as she realized the ex-couple might condemn her publicly. She tugged Lawrence Pembroke forward like a human shield.

"If I were truly guilty, even the great Mr. Pembroke couldn't have secured my release! The police aren't fools—real criminals leave evidence. This vile woman fabricated everything!"

"Mr. Blackwood," Lawrence interjected smoothly, "the legal system has rigorous procedures. As Ms. Blackwood's counsel, I merely ensure due process—not manufacture innocence."

His venomous gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Ms. Kingsley, whatever grudge you hold, resorting to slander is beneath the daughter of Harrison Kingsley. Shouldn't you demonstrate... graciousness?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed into icy slits. How amusing—this viper had forgotten how his father once groveled at her family's doorstep.

Nathan's sudden laugh froze the room—a chilling sound that made even Evelyn shiver in his embrace.

"Mr. Pembroke," Nathan's voice dripped with menace, "you overestimate your importance. Have you forgotten our conversation earlier? Or is your memory defective?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. They'd spoken beforehand?

Cassandra and Penelope instinctively retreated—Nathan's aura was more terrifying than any monster.

Lawrence's smug mask cracked as fear and rage twisted his features.

"Nathan! Mind your tone!" Leonard barked. "Mr. Pembroke is our honored guest!"

"Your guest," Nathan corrected coldly, his burning gaze returning to Evelyn's luminous eyes. In that moment, the world faded—only she existed.

"My warning stands," he declared, voice resonating with lethal promise. "Anyone who harms Ms. Kingsley will suffer consequences beyond imagination."

Evelyn's pulse raced as she found herself trapped in Nathan's magnetic stare.

Lawrence gulped, fists clenching behind his back.

"Do you recall my words now, Mr. Pembroke?" Nathan's whisper carried the weight of an executioner's axe.
###Chapter 490

The instant Evelyn Carter stepped into the room, the Blackwood family erupted into chaos before scattering in disarray.

She wasn't in the mood to explain anything to Reginald. The truth would reveal itself in time.

Besides, she had learned long ago from Harrison and Lillian about Lawrence Pembroke's ruthless methods. If he could get Cassandra Blackwood released from police custody, it meant he had already eliminated any loose ends.

Even if she knew he had coerced Julian Whitmore into taking the blame, the case was officially closed. The authorities wouldn’t reopen it anytime soon.

Lawrence was as dangerous as his charming smile suggested.

Still, Reginald had no intention of making things difficult for Evelyn. He trusted her character implicitly—he had witnessed her sincerity firsthand.

If he couldn’t trust Evelyn, who in this world could he trust?

She personally wheeled Reginald back to his room.

Nathan Blackwood followed closely behind her, his presence suffocating.

Evelyn was thoroughly annoyed.

But tonight, Reginald was in high spirits, watching the young couple fuss over him with a delighted grin. His smile stretched so wide that every tooth showed.

It wasn’t just love that nourished the soul. Watching a couple he shipped interact was just as fulfilling!

"I'm sorry, Grandpa Reginald. I’ve been so busy lately that I couldn’t visit. You must be upset with me, aren’t you?" Evelyn looked guilty.

"What nonsense, child! Just remembering this old man makes me happy."

Reginald squeezed her hand warmly before shooting Nathan a pointed look. "You're young—you should be out enjoying life, meeting good men. I hear Julian Montgomery and Alexander Whitmore are quite close to you. What do you think of them? Any other gentlemen catching your eye? Bring them to meet me—I’ll vet them for you!"

Nathan’s eye twitched. It felt like his grandfather had just swung a sledgehammer into his chest.

This meddling old man, confined to a wheelchair, still playing matchmaker!

Wasn’t he afraid Evelyn would bring home a wolf in sheep’s clothing?

Nathan’s breathing grew ragged, his eyes darkening with agitation.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Grandpa Reginald, how did you know about Alexander?"

"Oh, I know everything without even leaving this house," Reginald boasted.

"Ah. We’ve known each other since we were children."

"Childhood sweethearts, then?" Reginald asked nervously.

"Hmm..." Evelyn smiled faintly. "More like an older sister and a little brother. He was so frail back then—I had to take care of him!"

She tilted her chin up slightly, one hand resting on her hip, her smile radiant.

Nathan stared at her, transfixed.

Then, abruptly, his vision blurred. A sharp pain lanced through his skull.

He turned away quickly, pressing a hand to his temple as cold sweat drenched his back.

Somewhere in the depths of his memory, her smile overlapped with the blurry face of a little girl.

He had always felt like he’d known Evelyn far longer than he could recall.

But why couldn’t he remember?

"Is that so? You never mentioned being so close to the Whitmore boy before," Reginald mused.

"We lost touch when he moved to Serenia with his mother. We only reconnected recently by chance."

Evelyn was completely transparent about her relationship with Alexander.

"Ah... I heard he donated a rare collector’s necklace to support your charity auction. Seems he holds you in high regard."

"He probably just did it out of gratitude—for old times’ sake."

"Well, then, the youngest Whitmore heir is clearly a man who repays kindness."

Reginald shot Nathan a disdainful look, growing more irritated the longer he stared at him.

Hmph! Far better than this block of wood!

He wasn’t siding with an outsider—he was just frustrated with Nathan’s inaction and hoped to provoke him into stepping up.

"Grandpa Reginald, please don’t blame Mr. Blackwood for our divorce. It was mutual. I bear him no ill will."

Evelyn glanced back, her calm gaze making Nathan’s chest tighten.

"Mr. Blackwood isn’t as cold as you think. He knows how to repay kindness, how to love... how to cherish someone."

Nathan’s heart twisted violently. His throat constricted with remorse, his broad shoulders trembling faintly.

He did know how to love.

But all his passion had been wasted on the wrong person. Only after crashing into a wall, bloodied and broken, did he realize his mistake.

Yet he refused to be compared to Alexander Whitmore.

In Evelyn’s eyes, he would never measure up.
###Chapter 491

Evelyn gave Reginald a few final words about his medication before politely excusing herself from the room.

The moment she stepped into the hallway, Nathan came striding after her.

"Let me drive you home," he stated firmly.

She'd been biting back her fury in front of Reginald. Now it erupted as she took three rapid steps backward, finger jabbing toward his face.

"Freeze!" she shouted.

Nathan's brows knitted in confusion.

Evelyn's lips pursed in momentary embarrassment. She'd meant to say "stop" but the wrong word slipped out.

Whatever. The meaning was clear enough.

"I don't need your chauffeur services. I'm a grown woman perfectly capable of finding my own way home!"

"It's late." Nathan took an uncompromising step forward. "I'm driving you."

The memory of being manhandled by him earlier made her teeth grind. She brushed invisible dust off her shoulder with exaggerated disdain. "Nathan Blackwood, the only reason I didn't rip you a new one earlier was out of respect for Reginald, not because I want anything to do with you. So back off. Right now I'm so pissed at Lawrence Pembroke and Cassandra Blackwood that I'd kick a stray dog. Take one more step and I swear I'll rearrange that pretty face of yours."

She thought she sounded properly terrifying.

Nathan's lips twitched with barely suppressed amusement.

"If Lawrence gives you more trouble, come to me," he said quietly. "I'll handle him."

"Ha! The affairs between the Pembrokes and us Kingsleys are none of your concern. Worry about your own mess!"

She remembered how Nathan had publicly humiliated Lawrence to defend her earlier, and a strange tightness gripped her chest.

Then she remembered - that bastard was only protecting his own interests.

Gregory Blackwood clearly wanted Lawrence in Blackwood Industries. If that happened, Gregory would gain a powerful ally - disastrous for Nathan's position.

The realization made her snort derisively.

Just as Nathan moved to close the distance between them again, a sharp voice cut through the hallway.

"Nathan!"

He turned to see Gregory approaching rapidly.

"My study. Now."

"I'll see you later. Right now I'm seeing Ms. Kingsley home," Nathan replied evenly.

"See her home?" Gregory scoffed. "She doesn't need you - look!"

Nathan whirled around.

The woman had vanished like a ghost.

Evelyn strode through the Blackwood estate gates with icy composure.

"Ms. Kingsley."

She halted. Her eyes frosted over at the sight of Lawrence approaching with his trademark smarmy smile.

"However displeased you may be, I did successfully resolve Ms. Cassandra Blackwood's predicament. Losing to me is nothing to be ashamed of."

"Honestly, by any measure, I'd say I came out ahead in this exchange."

Rather than rising to his bait, Evelyn mirrored his mocking tone. "This incident has shown me your true colors. I've met plenty who bite the hand that feeds them, but you're the first to smash the entire dinner set after finishing the meal. I wonder - if your father Walter knew his most accomplished son's ambition was to lick the boots of the wealthy and betray his former benefactors, would he die of shame?"

Lawrence's plastic smile shattered. "Ms. Kingsley, I've shown restraint precisely because you're Chairman Kingsley's daughter! You cross lines with your constant provocations! Do you think wealth grants you immunity from consequences?"

"You've just reminded me - I am the heiress of Fairhaven's wealthiest family. Doing as I please is practically my birthright. Why wouldn't I wield such privilege?"

Evelyn's dangerous smile was a blade that drew no blood when it killed. "So next time you consider opposing me, remember exactly whose daughter I am and what power stands behind me. My temper makes my father's look tame."

With that, she pivoted on her designer heels and strode away.

Lawrence watched her retreating figure with gritted teeth.

"Evelyn Kingsley, don't mistake me for that spineless brother of yours. Just because Theodore is content being your family's lapdog doesn't mean I'll roll over for you!"

He called after her: "This isn't over between us!"
###Chapter 492

The study was tense with the presence of Penelope and Cassandra.

Nathan had deliberately excluded Reginald from this meeting, knowing the old man had already chosen Evelyn's side in this conflict.

Father and son now stood on opposite battlefields.

Ever since Lillian's tragic suicide, the bond between Nathan and Leonard had been nothing more than a hollow title.

And now, their rift deepened further because of Evelyn Kingsley.

This was precisely the scenario Penelope had been orchestrating.

Only when the Blackwoods were divided could she maneuver through the chaos to claim her share of the family fortune.

From a broader perspective, no matter how powerful Nathan became, Leonard remained his father. Surely a son must yield to his father's authority?

"I summoned you here to deliver an announcement."

Leonard sat rigidly on the sofa before tossing a freshly printed document toward Nathan. "I've appointed Lawrence Pembroke as Blackwood Industries' chief legal counsel. The announcement goes out tomorrow morning. My signature alone suffices - no presidential approval required."

Penelope and Cassandra exchanged triumphant smirks.

"I oppose this decision," Nathan stated coldly.

"Your opposition is irrelevant," Leonard snapped. "Lawrence is exceptionally talented. Don't you understand the value of securing top legal talent?"

"You heard that conversation between Evelyn and Lawrence, didn't you?"

Nathan's lips curled in derision. "You'd hire a backstabbing, money-grubbing snake like that?"

"You insolent—!"

Leonard shot to his feet, momentarily dizzy from the abrupt movement. Penelope steadied him with false concern.

"Darling, don't agitate yourself!" she cooed, secretly reveling in the confrontation.

"The Kingsleys supported the Pembrokes during their darkest hour. Harrison Kingsley personally mentored Lawrence. Even Theodore works at Monarch Group now. Yet Lawrence repays their kindness with betrayal for personal gain." Nathan's gaze turned lethal. "Do you truly believe you can control such a viper? When someone offers him better terms tomorrow, whose side do you imagine he'll choose?"

"Nathan Blackwood! You're just protecting that Kingsley witch!"

No longer restraining himself, Leonard's face flushed crimson with rage. "You're defending her so fiercely - have you fallen for that scheming bitch?"

"What if I have?" Nathan replied coolly.

His heartbeat thundered in his chest like war drums.

Leonard froze as if struck by lightning.

Penelope and Cassandra gaped, unprepared for such a blunt admission.

They couldn't discern whether Nathan genuinely loved Evelyn or was simply defying his father.

After all, the only mistake in Nathan's impeccable life had been abandoning the perfect Evelyn Kingsley for Victoria Sterling.

"Nathan Blackwood! Do you think you can undo the past?" Leonard's voice cracked with fury, his eye twitching violently. "Even if you've fallen for Evelyn Kingsley, abandon that fantasy now! As long as I draw breath, I'll never permit you near that Kingsley witch! Had I known she was Harrison Kingsley's daughter, I'd never have allowed that marriage! She made fools of us for three years!"

Each word pierced Nathan's heart like poisoned arrows.

Rage ignited in Nathan's eyes, his pupils contracting into lethal slits.

In one fluid motion, he seized the crystal ashtray and hurled it to the marble floor.

CRASH!

"Ah!"

Leonard flinched while the women shrieked.

Shards exploded across the study like glittering shrapnel.

Several fragments sliced through Penelope's designer dress and arm.

Blood welled from the cuts, her face twisting between shock and fury.

"Evelyn committed no crimes. What right have you to speak of her this way?"

Nathan's voice burned with barely contained violence, his fists clenched white-knuckled.

"What wrong did she commit by marrying me? How did she wrong our family during those three years? I failed her. Our entire family failed her! Cross this line again - even you - and I won't show mercy."

That gaze...
###Chapter 493

That same chilling gaze returned—the one that made no distinction between demon and mortal—as if Nathan had just stepped off the blood-soaked battlefields of Kridor.

Leonard's breath came in ragged gasps, his lips trembling uncontrollably.

The last time he'd seen that look was years ago, when young Nathan clung to his mother's lifeless body after her tragic fall. The boy had stared at his father with those very same hollow, devastated eyes.

Leonard despised that gaze. But more than anything, it terrified him.

And now, for the sake of Evelyn Carter—a mere woman—Nathan dared to defy his own flesh and blood?

Penelope and Cassandra had expected Nathan to humiliate himself. Instead, they stood frozen, barely daring to breathe.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his eyes fluttering shut. There was nothing left to say. He turned on his heel and strode toward the door.

"Nathan Blackwood!"

Leonard's voice cracked, raw with desperation. "You're choosing to protect Evelyn Carter over your own father? Have you forgotten your name? Your bloodline? Without my support, do you think you'd be sitting in that CEO chair at Blackwood Industries?"

The same tired threats. The same empty words.

Nathan felt nothing but exhaustion.

"You owe everything to me!" Leonard's voice rose to a scream. "Cross me, and I swear I'll strip you of your title! You'll be nothing!"

Even Penelope, his devoted wife, had never seen him unravel like this.

"Do what you must." Nathan paused at the threshold, his voice eerily calm. "If you can."

His next words were a blade, sharp and final. "For her, I'd wage war against the entire Blackwood dynasty."

The moment Nathan stepped into the hallway, his shoulders sagged. It was as if his soul had been hollowed out.

"Nathan."

A familiar voice made him stiffen. His vision blurred as Reginald materialized before him.

The old man hadn't changed into sleepwear. His crisp dress shirt suggested he had no intention of staying at Cliffside Manor tonight.

Ever since Margaret's passing and Leonard's remarriage to Penelope, Reginald considered Moonlight Cove his true home.

"Grandfather..." Nathan's voice broke.

"I heard everything."

Nathan knelt without hesitation, bringing himself level with the wheelchair.

Reginald's wrinkled hand landed on his shoulder. "It's disrespectful to speak to your father that way..." A sly grin tugged at his lips. "But this time, I agree with you!"

He gave Nathan's shoulder an approving squeeze. "That Lawrence Pembroke snake has no place in Blackwood Industries. Profit-hungry vultures don't belong in our family legacy."

The old man's eyes gleamed. "Don't worry, boy. I may be retired, but my vote still holds weight. If your father pushes this, I'll intervene."

"Grandfather, this is my responsibility as CEO. You should enjoy your retirement in peace."

"Nonsense! An old man needs excitement!" Reginald leaned closer, eyes twinkling. "Now, about what you said earlier... That you'd fallen for Evelyn. Was that true?"

Nathan's pulse roared in his ears.

After a weighted pause, he swallowed hard. "I spoke in anger. I didn't mean it."

Reginald snorted. "Stubborn boy."

As Nathan pushed the wheelchair down the corridor, the old man hid a knowing smile.

Foolish child.

The words that slip out in anger are often the truest of all.
###Chapter 494

The grand wedding of Isabella Wang and the CEO of a prestigious European luxury automobile brand took place at Monarch Grand Hotels in Crestview as planned.

Every social media platform across the globe was flooded with trending topics about Isabella's extravagant ceremony.

All media outlets in Crestview competed fiercely to cover the event, their sensational headlines fueling the frenzy:

[Monarch Grand Hotels Secures Victory in Bidding War Against Blackwood Industries!]

[Monarch's First Venture in Crestview Ends in Triumph! Blackwood Industries Left in Shambles!]

[Scandals Plague Blackwood Family - How Can Two Elite Families Be So Different?]

The spotlight on Monarch Grand Hotels reached unprecedented heights that day.

Netizens praised Evelyn Carter, whose identity as Alexa had been revealed, comparing her to Cassandra Blackwood. Cassandra appeared like a wilted daisy next to Evelyn's radiant presence.

[Ms. Carter was destined to win this battle. She's Alexa! Did Nathan Blackwood really think he could compete?]

[Let's be fair - this isn't Mr. Blackwood's fault. Cassandra was the one who overestimated herself and crashed into a brick wall. Now she's the laughingstock of society!]

[Cassandra thought she delivered a fatal blow to Ms. Carter, only to become the ultimate embarrassment!]

[Buying counterfeit jewelry for an international superstar? How utterly disgraceful!]

[She was just being economical where it counts, wasn't she?]

[Even if Cassandra walks out of police custody unscathed, her reputation is beyond repair!]

The humiliated Cassandra Blackwood watched helplessly as she became the subject of nationwide ridicule. Overwhelmed by rage, she collapsed into a feverish illness, confined to her bed.

Though Penelope Whitmore burned with vengeance, she was forced to retreat temporarily to care for her ailing daughter while simultaneously scheming to regain Leonard Blackwood's favor.

Despite being in her forties, Penelope underwent extensive cosmetic procedures, secretly purchased several revealing gowns, and even acquired an aphrodisiac perfume - preparing to seduce Leonard just as she had two decades prior.

The man hadn't touched her in nearly six months.

Yet Leonard seemed to be deliberately avoiding her, not returning home for weeks. When they did cross paths, he barely spoke and refused to meet her gaze.

How could Penelope not seethe with hatred?

"Evelyn Carter," she fumed. "This is all that witch's fault! I'll make sure Evelyn suffers a thousand times worse than what I'm enduring now!"

But no matter how intensely Penelope loathed Evelyn, she couldn't dim the brilliance of Evelyn's triumph.

Isabella's wedding spectacularly showcased the influence of Monarch Group, Fairhaven's premier corporation, in Crestview.

Moreover, Monarch Group's stock value skyrocketed that day, with analysts predicting continued growth when markets reopened. But the impact didn't end there.

When wedding photos flooded social media, they ignited a nationwide frenzy.

[An ocean of crimson roses! Isabella's wedding is absolutely breathtaking!]

[I don't care what it takes - I'm having my wedding exactly like this!]

[Finally, a break from traditional ceremonies! Monarch Grand Hotels gets perfect marks!]

Nathan Blackwood sat motionless in his office, intently watching the live broadcast of Isabella Wang's wedding.

A faint smile touched his lips as the ice in his piercing gaze momentarily melted.

Normally, such events wouldn't hold his interest.

But knowing Evelyn had poured her heart and soul into this project made it impossible to look away.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts, and Oliver Sinclair entered carrying an oversized olive-green duffel bag.

"Mr. Blackwood, I've prepared all the hiking equipment you requested."
###Chapter 495

"Thank you."

Theodore Winslow tilted his head curiously. "What made you suddenly decide to go hiking?"

Nathan Blackwood adjusted his cufflinks with practiced ease. "I make this trip annually."

When Nathan was eighteen, he'd spent a summer volunteering at Mount Evercrest National Park. Those two months as a junior ranger had been his escape from the suffocating expectations of the Blackwood dynasty.

Life had been beautifully simple then. Wake at dawn. Patrol the trails with Ranger Frank. Rescue stranded tourists. Document potential hazards. No board meetings. No corporate politics. Just the crisp mountain air and the quiet companionship of nature.

It remained one of the few genuinely peaceful periods in his otherwise turbulent life. Even now, as CEO of Blackwood Industries, he secretly funded the park's conservation efforts - a fact known only to him and his former captain.

"Mr. Blackwood! Did you see Isabella Wang's wedding coverage?" His assistant's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Madam Evelyn's design was extraordinary! Who would've thought the bride would agree to black roses?"

A faint smile touched Nathan's lips. "She's not an ordinary woman. She's Evelyn Carter." His voice softened. "She always finds a way."

Meanwhile, Lawrence Pembroke returned from Europe after his humiliating defeat. The prestigious position at Blackwood Industries' legal department had slipped through his fingers due to Nathan and Reginald Blackwood's interference.

The usually unflappable attorney had tasted bitter failure for the first time. He'd barely stepped through his penthouse doors when Theodore confronted him.

"Well, well." Lawrence's lips curled in derision. "If it isn't Evelyn Carter's lapdog. Shouldn't you be fetching her coffee instead of lurking in my home?"

Theodore's jaw tightened. "Don't you owe me an explanation?"

"Explanation?" Lawrence's composure cracked. "Watch your tone, little brother. I'm still your elder."

"First Penelope Whitmore. Now Cassandra Blackwood." Theodore's hands clenched into fists. "You've made quite the career out of betraying those who helped us."

"Lawrence!"

"I know you're obsessed with elevating the Pembroke name. But not like this!" Theodore's voice shook with barely contained fury. "Without the Kingsleys, we'd be nothing! How can you conspire against Madam Evelyn after everything?"

"For this family!" Lawrence exploded. "Must we grovel at the Kingsleys' feet forever? Just because they threw us some crumbs decades ago? You're content being their pet, but Gregory and I have greater ambitions!"

The words hung between them like a slap. Before Lawrence could react, Theodore's fist connected with his jaw.

The impact sent Lawrence staggering back. In twenty-eight years, Theodore had never raised a hand against his brother. The man he'd once idolized now filled him with nothing but disgust.

Lawrence retaliated with a wild swing, but Theodore - a black belt in taekwondo - easily overpowered his older sibling. Within moments, he had Lawrence pinned, pounding his brother's back into the marble floor.

"Stop this instant!"

Their parents and Gregory came rushing downstairs, horrified at the scene unfolding in their foyer. The usually elegant penthouse now bore witness to the Pembroke brothers' shattered relationship.
###Chapter 496

Theodore moved with lightning reflexes, darting forward to yank Lawrence off Evelyn's furious secretary. His arms locked around Lawrence's torso in a vice-like grip.

"Lawrence! Have you lost your damn mind?" Theodore's voice cracked like a whip. "Since when do we solve family disputes with fists?"

"Lost my mind?" Lawrence spat blood onto the marble floor. "He's the one who's lost his damn soul over that Kingsley woman!"

Gregory scrambled to his feet, wiping his split lip. "I'm just doing my job as their legal counsel. But our baby brother here? He's turned into some lovesick guard dog for Evelyn Kingsley!"

The library doors burst open as Walter Pembroke stormed in, his wife clinging to his arm. The patriarch's face darkened at the sight of his sons' injuries.

"Enough!" Walter's command shook the chandelier. "Both of you—my study. Now."

Eleanor Pembroke wrung her hands, her usual composure shattered. She'd never seen her sons come to blows before.

Gregory attempted damage control. "Father, Lawrence was just upset about the Salvador case. Emotions ran high—"

"I'm staying at the penthouse tonight." Lawrence shrugged off Theodore's grip, his knuckles still raw from the fight.

"Lawrence!" Eleanor cried out. "At least let the physician—"

"Oh please," Gregory sneered, adjusting his ruined tie. "We all know where he's really going. Does Evelyn Kingsley need her lapdog to tuck her in?"

Something snapped inside Lawrence. His fist connected with Gregory's jaw before anyone could react.

"You filthy—" Lawrence's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Say her name like that again. I dare you."

Walter stepped between them, his presence like a force field. "Not another word. Gregory, apologize. Lawrence, control yourself."

Lawrence's chest heaved. "I'll take whatever punishment you deem fit, Father. But I won't apologize for defending Evelyn's honor. And if Gregory insults her again?" His eyes burned with conviction. "I'll break every tooth in his smug face."

The tension shattered when the head butler announced, "Mr. Pembroke! Harrison Kingsley's personal envoy has arrived."

Quentin Prescott entered with perfect composure, though his sharp eyes catalogued the scene instantly. "Mr. Pembroke," he inclined his head. "Chairman Kingsley requests the pleasure of your family's company at Willow Creek Estate this evening."

Walter's diplomatic mask slid into place. "Please extend our gratitude to Harrison. We'd be honored."

The moment Quentin departed, Gregory wheeled toward the staircase. "Count me out. Jet lag."

"Like hell you are." Walter's voice turned glacial. "You will attend if I have to drag you there myself."

Gregory's jaw worked silently before storming off. Theodore exhaled sharply, running a hand through his disheveled hair.

In the charged silence, Eleanor whispered, "When did our family become a battlefield?"

No one had an answer.
###Chapter 497

The grand finale of Isabella Laurent's wedding unfolded like a dream, leaving the world buzzing with admiration.

Evelyn Carter had emerged victorious once again. Not only had she secured both fame and fortune, but she'd also miraculously revived the once-struggling Monarch Grand Hotels, transforming it into a thriving empire within a single year.

In just six months, she had surpassed Harrison Kingsley's expectations with dazzling brilliance.

Now, her first priority was clear—return to Fairhaven and claim her well-deserved reward from Harrison!

Hehe!

That evening, Evelyn arrived at Arabella Kingsley's school to pick her up. The sisters rode back to Fairhaven in a luxurious emerald-green Rolls Royce, the epitome of elegance.

Inside the car, laughter and chatter filled the air as the two sisters leaned against each other, their bond unbreakable.

"Evelyn, I still can't believe you're actually Alexa, the world-renowned jewelry designer!" Arabella pressed her flushed cheeks in astonishment.

"Stop right there—I already know what you're going to say." Evelyn tossed her dark hair over her shoulder, lifting her chin playfully. "You're about to tell me your admiration for me is like an endless, rushing river, right?"

"I've heard enough flattery to last a lifetime, so save your breath." She smirked. "If there's any jewelry you want, just ask. Consider it yours."

"H-How could I?" Arabella shook her head, her cheeks tinged pink. "You're Alexa! Only A-list celebrities wear your designs. You should give one to Cassandra. I heard her husband is about to become the president of Serenia. Wouldn't it elevate your brand if the First Lady wore your jewelry?"

"Pfft, Alexa might be a big deal to the world, but to family, it's just a name." Evelyn wrapped an arm around her sister's slender waist. "Go ahead and brag about it at school. Let them know your sister is Alexa. Trust me, they'll be lining up to kiss up to you. It'd be the honor of their lives to be connected to you."

Arabella's smile faltered slightly as memories of the rumors spread about her at school resurfaced—Ethan Chamberlain's relentless provocations, both overt and subtle.

Her eyes reddened, but she forced a small, tight-lipped smile.

"Sigh... Speaking of which, I really miss Cassandra."

Evelyn and Arabella leaned closer, their eyes shimmering with emotion. "I wonder if her husband is treating her well. If he dares to hurt her, I'll turn him into mincemeat!"

"You probably wouldn't even need to lift a finger," Arabella giggled. "Sebastian, Dominic, Donovan, Maxwell, Raymond, and Dad—none of them would let him off easy."

True enough.

Would Cassandra's husband really be foolish enough to test the wrath of the Kingsley family?

"Hmm? Evelyn, where's Theodore?" Arabella had been wondering about his absence since she got into the car and finally mustered the courage to ask.

"Oh, he's been overworking lately, so I gave him some time off." Evelyn shrugged, her expression unreadable.

The luxury car glided smoothly through the gates of Willow Creek Estate.

Just as the Kingsley sisters stepped out, they ran into the Pembroke family, who had just parked and were making their way toward them.

Evelyn hadn't been informed that Harrison had invited the Pembroke family tonight, so surprise flickered across her face before she quickly schooled her features back into calm indifference.

Lawrence Pembroke shot Evelyn a glare sharp enough to rival a rooster's comb the moment he spotted her. He looked like he was about to start crowing any second.

"Ms. Evelyn..." Theodore called out softly, his voice strained.

He took a hesitant step forward, but the memory of her words from that day made him retreat again. His heart, which had yearned to be near her, shattered all over again.

Evelyn spared him only a fleeting glance.

Tall and broad-shouldered, he stood there like a lost puppy, shoulders slumped, lips bitten pale. The sight was almost painful to witness.

But Evelyn knew better than to give him false hope.

To do so would be the cruelest kindness of all.
###Chapter 498

"Ms. Carter! It's been ages!" Walter Pembroke stepped forward with his wife, greeting Evelyn with practiced politeness.

"Uncle Walter, there's no need for formalities. Just call me Evelyn like you used to." Her smile was warm, effortless—no trace of the icy corporate heiress the world knew.

"That was when you were a child. Now, you're a director at Monarch Group and Theodore's superior. Things have changed."

Walter knew the woman before him wasn't just Harrison Kingsley's daughter anymore. She was Fairhaven's rising queen, the most likely successor to the Kingsley empire. Every word had to be measured.

Lawrence scoffed, heat creeping up his neck.

Did the Pembrokes have to bow to the Kingsleys forever?

Were crowns and thrones really earned, or just accidents of birth?

Evelyn didn't press further when Walter insisted on deference.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Pembroke studied the Kingsley sisters discreetly.

Evelyn had bloomed into a vision. As a child, she'd been porcelain perfection—now, she was a storm of elegance and power, breathtaking at first glance.

No wonder Theodore was hopelessly in love. Her chest ached for her son.

And the gap between their families was an ocean. The Pembrokes were respected scholars, but compared to Fairhaven's wealthiest dynasty? They might as well be peasants.

Her son was reaching for a star far beyond his grasp.

Mrs. Pembroke's gaze shifted to Arabella, standing quietly with perfect poise.

"H-Hello, Mrs. Pembroke!" Arabella bowed slightly, pulse fluttering. The sight of her crush's mother sent roses blooming across her cheeks.

"Hello, Ms. Arabella."

If Theodore couldn't have Evelyn, the youngest Kingsley daughter might suffice. Sweet-tempered, refined—a decent match for her youngest. The only flaw? Her mother wasn't Harrison's legal wife.

Camille Kingsley had never been more than a mistress, and Arabella was their sole, frail proof of affection. Surely the Kingsleys didn't value them highly.

Letting Theodore marry Arabella felt like settling.

Arabella's lashes fluttered as she stole a glance at her love.

One look froze her racing heart mid-beat, then shattered it.

Theodore only ever looked at Evelyn.

No one understood that burning gaze better than she did.

Because for seven years, hadn't she watched him with the same desperate hunger?

Willow Creek Estate buzzed with rare energy tonight. Only Sebastian was absent, overseas on business.

But the two civil servants—Dominic and Raymond—arrived precisely on time, as if synchronized.

Initially, the atmosphere was warm. Harrison and Walter were contemporaries with decades of shared history.

Mrs. Pembroke and Harrison's three wives chatted like old friends.

Yet tension crackled among the younger men.

A prosecutor, a judge, a detective, and a lawyer—with Evelyn, the plaintiff herself—sat around the table. A courtroom in miniature.

"So, Lawrence. I hear Evergreen Legal is thriving in Crestview."

Dominic swirled his wine, lips curling. "Funny how you're always defending the criminals my office prosecutes."

"Every man deserves representation." Lawrence matched his smirk. "Even the ones you overzealously charge."
###Chapter 499

Lawrence responded with a practiced smile that didn't reach his eyes. "When a client seeks me out and places their trust in me, it's only professional to give the case my utmost dedication."

Dominic arched an eyebrow, crossing his legs as he studied Lawrence like a specimen under microscope. "Fascinating perspective. Those who can afford your services must be exceptionally influential. It seems your clientele operates on an entirely different financial plane."

"Not necessarily." Lawrence adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate nonchalance. "While I may helm the firm, it's not solely mine. There are other stakeholders expecting returns, not to mention the dozens of associates depending on those paychecks." He sighed theatrically. "At the end of the day, I'm just another working stiff trying to make ends meet."

The collective eye-roll from Dominic, Raymond, and Evelyn was nearly audible.

Theodore, who had remained silent throughout the exchange, finally spoke in that cutting tone only he could master. "Let's not pretend, Lawrence. You're currently Crestview's most sought-after attorney, with cases making national headlines." His fingers tapped against the crystal glass. "This year alone, your lowest retainer was $2.5 million, with your highest hitting $16 million—and that's just your personal cut, excluding your associates' earnings."

A weighted silence descended over the dining room.

Harrison and Walter paused their conversation, attention shifting to the younger generation's table.

Lawrence's smile turned brittle. "Theodore, my financials and the firm's operations are private matters. Hardly appropriate dinner conversation, don't you think?" The forced expression pulled at the carefully concealed wound beneath his foundation.

"I mention it to establish one undeniable fact—you're obscenely wealthy." Theodore's voice remained icy calm. "You've accumulated more than ten lifetimes' worth of spending money. Which brings me to my actual point." He leaned forward slightly. "With financial motivation eliminated, why take the Blackwoods' case knowing they're actively working against Ms. Carter?"

The tension became palpable.

Unbelievable.

If Theodore had a nickname tonight, it would be "The Executioner." He'd come armed with verbal daggers specifically for his brother.

Evelyn hadn't acknowledged Theodore all evening.

Now her glacial gaze lifted, those piercing eyes assessing his profile with detached calculation. She recognized this as his attempt to defend her.

But she neither wanted nor required his intervention.

"Theodore!" Gregory hissed under his breath, kicking his brother's ankle beneath the table. "This isn't the time or place for family disputes!"

Theodore might as well have been carved from marble for all the reaction he showed.

Lawrence's expression had deteriorated into something resembling a terminal illness patient.

"Theodore!" Walter's reprimand cracked through the air like a whip. He offered Harrison an apologetic grimace. "My deepest apologies, Chairman Kingsley. It appears my son forgot his manners tonight."

Harrison merely chuckled, swirling his wine with undisturbed composure. "No need for apologies. I've watched Theodore grow up alongside Sebastian—first as his right hand, then Evelyn's protector. He's always been exceptionally principled." His smile deepened. "Truthfully, I've considered him family for years. A godson, if you will."

Godson?

That casual declaration elevated Theodore's status exponentially while delivering a crushing blow to Lawrence's carefully constructed facade.
###Chapter 500

Lawrence had always despised his incompetent younger brother.

To Lawrence, Theodore was nothing more than a spineless servant, content to fetch tea and trail after Evelyn like a devoted lapdog.

But Lawrence never anticipated Harrison Kingsley—Fairhaven's wealthiest tycoon—to publicly declare Theodore as his godson.

This was blatant favoritism, an unmistakable show of support from the Monarch Group patriarch.

Worse still, Harrison had praised Theodore extravagantly before the entire gathering.

Wasn't this just a veiled insult directed at Lawrence?

Around the table, the Kingsley siblings wore varying expressions. Evelyn's crimson lips curled as she barely suppressed a laugh.

Oh, Harrison. How deliciously petty.

Lawrence probably never imagined this dinner would become his carefully laid trap.

"Mr. Kingsley, you honor our son beyond measure!" Walter and Penelope Pembroke exchanged startled glances. Though thrilled, Walter waved his hands frantically. "My youngest could never deserve such an honor! Serving at Monarch Group is privilege enough!"

"Walter, we've been friends for decades." Harrison's voice carried quiet authority. "I don't give compliments lightly. If Theodore weren't exceptional, I wouldn't make this offer. Surely you understand?"

Each praise for Theodore cut deeper into Lawrence's pride.

Beneath the table, Lawrence's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened, eyes burning with humiliation.

Just as he sought an excuse to leave, Harrison remarked casually, "Evelyn, when you see Sebastian in a few days, deliver a message for me."

"What is it, Father?" Evelyn rested her chin on one hand, eyes gleaming.

"I've approved his acquisition proposal for Westwood Legal. He may proceed immediately."

Lawrence froze.

The words struck like a thunderbolt.

Westwood Legal held controlling shares in his firm.

If Harrison acquired it, wouldn't that give the Kingsleys complete control over Lawrence's practice?

So this was their game!

Lawrence's jaw locked, veins bulging at his temples as cold sweat soaked through his tailored suit.

He couldn't bear to meet Harrison or Evelyn's gazes, knowing their triumphant stares would flay him alive.

This entire dinner had been a carefully orchestrated humiliation—retribution for crossing Evelyn, proof of who truly held power.

Harrison wanted Lawrence to understand the cost of challenging his treasured daughter.

After dinner, the Pembroke family lingered in the parlor, conversation flowing in clusters.

Evelyn seized the rare opportunity to chat with her brothers, their laughter ringing through the room.

Meanwhile, Dominic and Gregory, being in similar professional circles, engaged in lively debate. The four siblings eventually settled into a boisterous game of cards.

Just as Evelyn leaned forward to play her hand, her elbow knocked over a crystal glass of merlot.

Burgundy liquid cascaded down her ivory dress, staining slender calves and dripping onto delicate feet.

"Let me help!" Dominic scrambled for napkins.

"I'll do it!" Raymond sprang up urgently.

"Should I...?" Gregory hesitated, feeling obligated to join the sudden commotion.

As three grown men fumbled to assist, a tall figure materialized and dropped to one knee before Evelyn.

Evelyn looked down in surprise, dark lashes fluttering.

Theodore had appeared instantly, producing a monogrammed handkerchief. Cradling her foot with one hand, he began meticulously dabbing away the wine with the other.

Evelyn jerked back instinctively.

Undeterred, Theodore continued his ministrations with single-minded focus, as though this were simply part of his duties.

The room fell silent.

Across the parlor, Arabella—mid-conversation with Camille—felt her heart plummet. Tremors wracked her frame.

Her vision blurred as she bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, something fragile shattering in her chest.

"Mother... I'm unwell. I'll retire early."

Arabella kept her head lowered, golden hair veiling tear-bright eyes as she fled.

"Arabella? Arabella!" Camille called after her retreating figure.

Evelyn noticed Theodore had finished with her foot and moved toward her stained calf. Flustered, she recoiled and stood abruptly.

Theodore looked up, gaze luminous with devotion.

Meeting that worshipful stare, Evelyn sighed softly. "You're not my secretary tonight. You're Walter Pembroke's son. Even if you were, this isn't necessary. I'll wash it off."

With that, she walked away, leaving Theodore kneeling alone before the astonished assembly.
