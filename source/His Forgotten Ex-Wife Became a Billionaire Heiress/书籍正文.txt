###Chapter 1

The phone screen lit up as Vivian Laurent was setting up a candlelit dinner.

She wore an apron, holding freshly cut red roses with a sweet smile on her lips.

"Let's divorce."

Three simple words pierced her heart like a sharp blade.

Entertainment news suddenly blared from the television.

[Roscente Group CEO Ethan Roscente spends millions renting private island for actress Sophia Evans! Intimate getaway photos surface - wedding imminent!]

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly.

So this was why.

Three years of marriage reduced to a cold text message.

With shaking hands, she dialed the familiar number.

"What is it?" An impatient voice answered.

"Ethan," her voice cracked. "Don't you owe me an explanation?"

"About what?"

"You and Sophia—"

"Vivian," he interrupted. "Don't play the victim. You know exactly how this marriage started. The three-year agreement is up. It's time to end this."

Papers shuffled in the background.

"My driver's waiting outside. Go sign the papers. Keep the house. Name your price. I'm busy—don't call again."

The line went dead.

Vivian stood frozen, then suddenly laughed.

How ironic.

Three years ago when Ethan was paralyzed in that accident, doctors said he'd never walk again. She'd stayed by his hospital bed for six months, using ancestral acupuncture techniques to heal him.

Back then, his precious Sophia was too busy filming abroad to even call.

And now...

Vivian walked to the mirror, studying her delicate features.

Three years ago, poison had disfigured her face and ballooned her weight to 220 pounds. Now toxin-free, her true beauty had returned.

She'd actually thought—

The doorbell rang.

"Madam," the driver stood respectfully outside. "Mr. Roscente sent me."

At the civil affairs office, clutching her fresh divorce certificate, Vivian called her best friend.

"Isabella, let's get drinks."

"What? I thought you were waiting for Ethan tonight—"

"I'm divorced."

......

Roscente Group CEO Office.

"It's done?" Ethan didn't look up from his desk.

"Yes, sir. Ms. Laurent signed everything."

"How much did she ask for?"

"Nothing."

Ethan finally glanced up, frowning. "What did she say?"

"Nothing at all." The driver hesitated. "Sir, perhaps you should—"

"Get out."

When silence returned, Ethan made another call.

"Any leads on Dr. Luna?"

"Nothing. The miracle doctor's whereabouts remain unknown—we don't even know if they're male or female."

"Keep looking." Ethan's voice turned icy. "Sophia's condition won't wait."

Hanging up, he stared out the window.

For some reason, Vivian's always-smiling eyes flashed through his mind.
###Chapter 2

Midnight at Nightfall Lounge.

Amethyst lights pulsed through the air as seductive music teased the senses.

Vivian Laurent entered in stilettos, finding Isabella Langley already nursing a drink in the VIP booth.

"Isabella."

She tapped the glass tabletop. Though they'd grown distant after Vivian's marriage into the Roscente family, Isabella had managed all her business ventures.

"Vivian!"

Isabella embraced her, voice trembling. "You finally left that man! I've waited three years for this decision!"

Three years ago, Vivian's sudden wedding announcement had shocked Isabella. This was the legendary Dr. Luna—renowned physician, elite hacker Queen, and genius designer—retiring at her peak.

"He hasn't seen you like this, has he?" Isabella eyed her transformed friend.

Vivian shook her head. "The toxins are gone." When Ethan Roscente left, she'd been a disfigured woman covered in lesions.

"What's next? Your Dark Web medical queue extends to next year, and Shadow's contracts are piling up."

Vivian swirled her amber drink, its hue mirroring her distant gaze. She still couldn't fathom why she'd wasted three years in that empty mansion.

"I'm back."

"Found the poisoner?"

"Natalie." Vivian's eyes turned glacial at her half-sister's name.

"Letting her go?"

"Hardly." A dangerous smile curved Vivian's lips. "She'll learn what suffering truly means."

As they discussed business, leering men approached.

"Buy you ladies a drink?"

"Get lost."

Vivian didn't even glance up. One man reached for her face. "Playing hard to—"

He flew three meters before hitting the floor.

"Get her!" he roared.

By the time security arrived, bodies littered the ground. Vivian flexed her wrist. "Let's talk upstairs."

Outside the private lounge, Felix Valdemar gaped. "That was insane! I didn't even see her move!"

Beside him, Ethan Roscente gave a noncommittal hum, his gaze tracking the retreating figure.

"Definitely an upgrade from your fat ex-wife." Felix snapped his fingers. "Right, today's your divorce."

"Former wife," Ethan corrected.

"Anyone running with Isabella Langley is trouble." Felix scowled, recalling their corporate battles.

...

Alcohol burned through Vivian's veins. Celebrating her newfound freedom, she'd overindulged. After Isabella left for the restroom, she staggered toward the hallway.

The bathroom door swung open.

Vivian froze.

The mirror reflected a tall silhouette.

She blinked hard, doubting her intoxicated vision.

The man smoking at the corridor's end—it was unmistakably Ethan Roscente.
###Chapter 3

Vivian's fingertips trembled slightly.

Three years had passed. She was finally face to face with that unforgettable visage again. Ethan stood at the end of the hallway, his tall frame elongated by the overhead lights as he spoke on the phone.

She stumbled forward and grabbed his wrist.

Ethan frowned at the sudden appearance of this woman. Wasn't she the one brawling downstairs earlier? So she did pick up men—just not the low-quality ones.

"Miss, have some self-respect." His voice was glacial.

Smack!

The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the corridor.

"You bastard!" Vivian's vision darkened as she collapsed forward.

Ethan instinctively caught her, still hearing her mutter: "Cheating scum..."

In the private room, Felix spat out his drink. "Holy shit! Where'd you pick her up? Isn't that the Valkyrie from downstairs?"

"No idea." Ethan dumped the unconscious woman onto the couch with a dark expression.

Morning light stabbed at Vivian's eyes.

She sat up rubbing her temples, finding a black suit jacket draped over her. Last night...had she actually struck Ethan?

Her phone's ringtone interrupted the memory.

"Nathan's anxious voice came through. "Dr. Laurent! There's a 19-year-old girl with critical injuries from a car accident. The entire hospital's stumped—"

"On my way."

Vivian grabbed the jacket and ran. Reviewing the case files during the ride, her frown deepened. Multiple organ ruptures, traumatic brain injury...the girl's survival this long was miraculous.

Chaos reigned outside the OR.

"Mr. Garnache, your daughter's heart is nearly punctured..." The lead surgeon mopped his brow.

"Money is no object!" Mrs. Garnache clung to her husband. "Save our girl!"

"Move!"

Vivian strode in, her white lab coat revealing last night's black miniskirt. The alcohol fumes made Mr. Garnache grimace. "Are you even qualified?"

"Delay any longer and she dies." Vivian pushed through the OR doors.

Under the surgical lights, the teenager's vitals were nearly flatlined.

"Prep the defibrillator." Vivian snapped on gloves. "5mg epinephrine IV push."

Nathan hesitated. "Vivian, this—"

"Trust me."

The scalpel became an extension of her will. Three hours later, the heart monitor's steady beep broke the tension.

"Pulse restored!" a nurse exclaimed.

Removing her mask revealed Vivian's exhausted smile. Three years away from the OR, yet her hands remembered every movement.

Watching sweat-dampened strands cling to her temples, Nathan recalled that phone call from three years ago: "I'm getting married, Nathan. No more medicine."

What a waste, he'd thought then. A genius like her belonged at medicine's pinnacle.
###Chapter 4

The operating room lights blazed bright as daylight. Beads of sweat formed at Vivian Laurent's temples as her scalpel moved with precision through the patient's chest cavity—a masterful dance of steel and flesh.

"Blood pressure stabilizing!" a nurse exclaimed.

Outside, the Jiang couple paced anxiously. Mrs. Jiang twisted the strap of her handbag. "Can someone so young really handle this?"

"That's Dr. Luna," Nathan Clementson said from his post against the wall, his tone firm. "Voted top surgeon of the year by International Medical Journal."

Mr. Jiang immediately pulled out his phone. His eyes widened at the search results. "Good lord... Over three hundred successful heart transplants..."

The surgery lasted seven grueling hours. As Vivian tied off the final suture, her gloved fingers trembled slightly.

"Need a break?" Nathan offered her a glass of water.

She shook her head, pulling down her mask to reveal a pallid face. "I'm going home."

Hospital staff watched in awe as the seemingly fragile woman strode down the corridor—fresh from performing a textbook-perfect operation.

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente stood in Vivian's apartment. Three dishes and a soup sat cold on the dining table. His lips curled into a sneer as memories of that rainy night three years ago surfaced.

His phone rang. "We located Dr. Luna," Simon Eisner reported.

"Where?"

"Capital Hospital. Just finished a major surgery."

Ethan grabbed his suit jacket and bolted out the door. He'd pay any price to save Sophia Evans.

At the hospital entrance, Mr. Jiang was effusively shaking a doctor's hand. Ethan approached. "Where's Dr. Luna?"

"Left already," a nurse gestured toward a side exit. "Used the staff corridor."

Ethan barked into his phone: "Lock down all exits. Find a woman in a lab coat."

Vivian had already changed into casual wear and slid exhaustedly into a taxi. Rubbing her temples, she suddenly spotted a black Maybach closing in through the rearview mirror.

"Turn right ahead," she instructed the driver, eyes narrowing.

The cab veered into an alley—the Maybach sticking to them like a shadow. Vivian's lips curved. "Lose him."

A high-speed chase ensued through city streets. Ethan floored the accelerator, pulling alongside the taxi—only to see an unfamiliar man behind the wheel.

Then the cab braked hard. Before Ethan could react, a slender figure vaulted from the backseat into the driver's position.

The taxi's engine roared as it shot forward like an arrow. Ethan's pupils constricted—those were professional-grade driving skills.

Tires screeched as both vehicles raced across an overpass. Vivian steered with one hand while flipping off the pursuing car with the other.

"Later, Mr. Roscente," she murmured before executing a flawless drift into traffic—vanishing instantly.

Ethan slammed the steering wheel. Outmaneuvered by a woman—using his own specialty.

His phone pinged with Simon's message: "Confirmed. Dr. Luna's real name—Vivian Laurent."

Ethan's face darkened as he stared at the screen.
###Chapter 5

Vivian Laurent slammed the brakes after shaking off Ethan Roscente. Before she could speak, her driver was already vomiting outside the car.

"Miss, are you an F1 racer?" The driver leaned against the door, his face pale.

Vivian had indeed won twenty racing championships. She'd been banned for dominating too hard. But now wasn't the time for memories—Ethan's face occupied her mind.

He was back.
And he hadn't recognized her.

Her phone buzzed. Vivian answered. "Nathan."

"Little师妹, Ethan Roscente is looking for you. Says Sophia Evans is critically ill. Name your price."

Vivian's lips curled coldly. Of course it was for Sophia.

Sophia was Ethan's first love. He'd crashed his car chasing her, spent half a year in a wheelchair. Vivian had secretly healed him. On their wedding day, Ethan flew overseas to make Sophia a movie star.

"Little师妹?" Nathan pressed.

"No."

"Why?" The voice changed. Ethan's deep tone came through. "You just saved an emergency patient."

Vivian's voice turned glacial. "Two rules."

"What rules?"

"No Evans. No Roscentes."

Ethan paused. "You know me?"

"Mr. Roscente's mistress scandal is everywhere. Starring Sophia Evans, right?" Vivian sneered. "Sorry, I don't treat cheaters and homewreckers."

"She's not—"

"Save it." Vivian cut him off. "Time spent saving her could rescue ten dogs."

The dial tone left Ethan grimacing. He turned to Nathan Clementson. "Give me Dr. Luna's contact."

"Sorry." Nathan smiled. "My师妹 doesn't change her mind."

After Ethan left, Nathan called Vivian. "Come to the hospital. Your schedule."

Vivian considered. "Two weeks. I need a vacation."

"Perfect! I'll prepare your office!"

Meanwhile, Ethan called Felix Valdemar. "Find that woman from the bar."

"Isabella Langley's friend? That lunatic?" Felix whistled. "You're interested?"

"Just get results."

News of Vivian's return sent ripples through multiple industries. Fashion designer Amy and jewelry director Erin rushed to report. Only Lucas Lefèvre stood silently.

He was Vivian's adopted orphan.

"Boss," Lucas whispered. "The Dark Web bid hit nine figures. Ethan offered—"

"No."

One word. Final.
###Chapter 6

"Shadow, our regular clients on the Dark Web are going insane. They keep demanding to know when the top agent will take contracts again." The assistant's anxious voice came through the phone.

Vivian Laurent twirled the plane ticket between her fingers. "Let them wait."

"But those contracts—"

"I said I'm not taking any jobs right now." She cut him off. "Starting next week, I'll be working at the hospital. We'll discuss this later."

She hung up and efficiently packed her luggage. The three-year-old villa already had a "For Sale" sign outside. She wanted nothing that Ethan Roscente had given her.

The real estate agent called while she sipped coffee in the airport VIP lounge.

"Ms. Laurent, the house has been sold."

"Good." She took another sip. "Dispose of everything inside."

Meanwhile, Ethan stood before the empty villa, his expression thunderous.

"Ethan, coming to the bike race tomorrow?" Felix Valdemar's voice came through the phone.

"Not interested."

"Isabella Langley will be there." Felix lowered his voice. "Thought you wanted to find that Night person."

Ethan's eyes sharpened. "Send me the address."

Across the ocean, Vivian was sunbathing on the beach when her phone buzzed incessantly.

"W! Emergency!" Isabella's voice messages poured in. "That bastard Felix hired a pro racer. We've lost three matches already!"

Vivian smirked. "Book my flight. I'll be there tomorrow."

Race day. The track buzzed with excitement. Isabella paced nervously. "Where is she?"

"Here." Lucas Lefèvre pointed toward the entrance.

The crowd turned to see a tall figure silhouetted against the light. The red racing suit hugged her curves perfectly as she carried her helmet under one arm, revealing a stunningly cold face.

"W!" Isabella rushed forward.

Vivian scanned the opposite side. "Pro racer?"

"Some mysterious expert. Haven't seen them yet."

She swung onto the bike with practiced ease, long legs bracing. "Let's begin."

As engines roared, a dark figure emerged from the opposite pit area. Ethan wore a full-face helmet, his gaze locked on the red racing suit.

Felix leaned in. "That's Isabella's ace."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. Something about that figure felt strangely familiar.
###Chapter 7

Ethan Roscente removed his helmet and tossed it onto the lounge sofa.

Felix Valdemar quickly offered him a cigarette, the lighter clicking open with a sharp snap.

"One more race, Ethan," Felix said with a pleading tone. "That last run was flawless."

Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke and shook his head.

Felix's phone buzzed. His expression darkened as he read the message.

"Damn it! Lost again!" He gripped his hair in frustration. "Isabella Langley is going to laugh in my face."

The two real estate companies had been locked in a bitter rivalry over land acquisitions for years.

Ethan tapped his cigarette. "Is it really that serious?"

"It's about pride!" Felix growled through clenched teeth.

He leaned in suddenly. "Heard there's a new female racer in town. Took down all our guys with insane skills."

Ethan's fingers stilled.

Night?

The memory of that挑衅的手势 flashed in his mind.

He stubbed out his cigarette. "Let's go."

The starting line was empty—the third round had already begun.

Isabella leaned against the railing. Ethan approached her directly. "Where's Night?"

"Another one looking for Night." She eyed him skeptically. "Who are you, really?"

Without another word, Ethan swung onto his motorcycle.

As the engine roared to life, Felix shouted, "Go get 'em, Ethan! Crush them!"

Isabella scoffed. "Dream on!"

"Who was it that just lost to Ethan earlier?" Felix shot back.

They both let out identical dismissive noises.

......

The winding mountain road coiled like a serpent.

Vivian Laurent easily left her pursuers behind, their figures vanishing from her rearview mirror.

She eased off the throttle, fingers tapping idly against the handlebars.

Then—the growl of an engine, closing in fast.

A black motorcycle appeared in her mirror, leaning so low into the curve it nearly scraped the asphalt.

A smirk curved Vivian's lips.

Now things were getting interesting.

The two bikes wove through the treacherous mountain pass, neither yielding an inch.

Every turn was a life-or-death gamble.

Neither showed any intention of slowing down.
###Chapter 8

Ethan Roscente gripped the steering wheel, his eyes locked on the speeding race car ahead. The driver's skills confirmed his suspicion from their brief encounter outside the hospital.

This woman was definitely Dr. Luna.

He floored the gas pedal, attempting to overtake. But she always managed to evade him by a hair's breadth. Their two cars raced down the track like cheetahs, leaving other competitors far behind.

The finish line loomed ahead.

"Go Ethan!" Felix Valdemar shouted from the sidelines.

Isabella Langley countered, "My boss is taking first place!"

Both cars crossed the finish line almost simultaneously.

Vivian Laurent parked smoothly and moved to leave. Ethan abandoned his vehicle and caught her wrist.

"Come with me."

He pulled her into a secluded area without explanation.

"Dr. Luna, I'm Ethan Roscente." He cut straight to the point. "I need you to save someone. Name your price."

Vivian froze mid-motion while removing her helmet. She hadn't expected her racing opponent to be this persistent man.

Through the helmet visor, she studied the face that had captivated her at first sight.

"You've mistaken me for someone else." Her voice turned icy.

Ethan frowned. The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn't place it.

"Your driving outside the hospital. Today's race. Both prove you're Dr. Luna." He stepped closer. "Help me this once, and the Roscente family owes you. Otherwise..."

"Otherwise what?" Vivian narrowed her eyes.

"Just reminding Dr. Luna to consider the consequences."

"I told you, I'm not her."

As she turned to leave, Ethan's phone rang.

"Ethan..." A woman's anxious voice came through.

Vivian paused.

"Sophia?" Ethan's expression changed instantly. "I'll be right there."

His hurried departure stabbed at Vivian's heart. Wasn't that woman supposed to be abroad?

"Viv! We won!" Isabella ran over excitedly. "Felix looked ready to explode!"

Vivian responded distractedly.

"What's wrong?" Isabella noticed her mood. "Did that guy cause trouble?"

"Do you know who he is?"

"Who?"

"Ethan Roscente."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Your ex-husband?!"
###Chapter 9

Isabella grabbed Vivian's wrist tightly. "Did he recognize you?" Her fingertips trembled slightly. If she'd known it was Ethan Roscente, she would never have let Vivian participate in that competition.

Vivian scoffed and shook off her hand. "He only knows me as Night."

"Sophia Evans?" Isabella's eyes widened. "That influencer who posts yacht photos on Instagram?" She stomped her foot angrily. "Is Ethan insane? Asking his ex-wife to save his mistress?"

Vivian wiped her fingers methodically, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "That's why I refused."

Isabella immediately perked up, leaning closer. "What's your plan?"

Vivian didn't answer. She strode straight to the parking lot. The roar of an engine split the night as a red sports car sped away.

Water dripped in the villa bathroom. Vivian emerged wrapped in a robe, her hair still damp. She opened her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Suddenly, Roscente Group plunged into darkness.

"What's happening?" The IT director wiped sweat from his brow. "All systems are down!"

A pig in a business suit appeared on every screen, a glowing "Roscente" character above its head. The technicians exchanged nervous glances, none daring to speak.

"It's Queen!" the lead engineer gasped. "Only she could breach our firewall!"

Ethan was en route to the hospital when his phone vibrated. The photo from Simon made his pupils constrict.

"Queen?" His eyes narrowed, knuckles whitening.

Memories of their three-day cyber battle two years ago surfaced. It had ended in a stalemate. He never expected her to attack Roscente Group now.

Vivian watched the cascading data streams, a cold smile curling her lips. With a tap of the enter key, every display in Roscente Group lit up simultaneously—

The suited pig began tap dancing to "The Piggy Song."

The entire IT department froze in shock.

Watching the live feed, Ethan suddenly laughed. He dialed an encrypted number. "Long time no see, Queen."

Vivian's screen went black. Blood-red letters slowly materialized:

"Got you."
###Chapter 10

The moment Ethan Roscente's plane touched down, an urgent call came through. He slid into the black Maybach and motioned for his assistant to hand him the laptop.

His long fingers flew across the keyboard as lines of code cascaded down the screen. Within ten minutes, the last strand of virus had been eradicated.

"Find out who's behind this." Ethan snapped the laptop shut, his voice glacial. "I want to know why Queen is targeting Roscente Group."

"Already on it," Simon Eisner responded promptly.

His phone vibrated. Patrick Alpinus's voice crackled through the receiver. "Ethan, is Queen back in the game?"

"Your intel network never fails to impress." Ethan narrowed his eyes.

"Send me the files." Patrick sounded excited. "I've hit a dead end investigating Shadow's case."

"Wasn't Shadow eliminated four years ago?" Ethan frowned.

"No body, no confirmation." Patrick sighed. "The Dark Web's top female operative just vanished into thin air..."

Vivian Laurent lounged on the sofa, fingertips lightly tapping her keyboard. The data stream on her screen suddenly froze—someone had cracked her virus.

Her eyebrow arched. Only one person could dismantle her program in ten minutes. King.

"Roscente Group has some tricks up its sleeve." She chuckled, closing the laptop.

The fruit bowl on the coffee table emitted a fresh aroma. Vivian picked up a strawberry, its crimson juice staining her fingers.

The betrayal four years ago felt like yesterday. Natalie's smiling face as she drugged her. The despair of a failed mission. And... Ethan's unexpected gentleness when he saved her.

She licked the strawberry juice off her fingers, her gaze turning icy.

She'd heard Natalie was getting engaged?

Time for her dear stepsister to taste the bitter fruit of her own schemes.
###Chapter 11

Valrose Group had been making frequent moves in the real estate industry recently.

Vincent Valrose was gradually transferring power, letting Natalie take over the company's core operations.

Vivian stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingertips lightly tapping the glass.

She had been away from the Valrose family for four whole years without a single trace. Yet her biological father Vincent had never bothered to look for her.

There had never been a place for her in that household.

It was precisely this cold indifference that allowed her to grow up in the countryside and eventually join the organization, honing her extraordinary skills.

Her phone vibrated. Vivian dialed Lucas's number.

"Viv!" Lucas's voice brimmed with excitement.

"What's Valrose Group up to lately?"

"They're eyeing that plot in the southern district." Lucas quickly pulled up the files. "Natalie's been throwing money around to grease palms. She's dead set on getting it."

A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. "Hijack it."

"On it!"

Lucas worked with astonishing efficiency. Two days later, the newly registered "Triple Six Realty" successfully secured the project.

The news reached Natalie just as she was trying on her engagement ring in the dressing room.

"What?!" She shot up from her seat, nails digging into her palms.

She had wined and dined, pulling out all the stops to secure that land.

"Find out who did this!"

"It's a newly established company..."

Natalie trembled with rage but forced herself to suppress it. The engagement ceremony was about to begin.

In the banquet hall, Oliver stood expressionless at the end of the red carpet.

Dressed in an immaculate suit, his eyes were as hollow as a marionette's.

Natalie walked toward him on Vincent's arm, her smile saccharine sweet.

"Oliver." She cooed. "From today onward, you're my fiancé."

Oliver's lips moved soundlessly.

"Everyone's watching." Natalie pinched his arm discreetly.

Just then, the doors swung open abruptly.

"My little sister's engagement, and you didn't invite me?"

The cool female voice brought the entire room to a stunned silence.

...

In the top-floor office of Roscente Group, an assistant rushed in. "Mr. Roscente, we've found Madam."

"Where?"

"At the Valrose engagement banquet."

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly. Having investigated Vivian's background, he knew exactly what her situation in the Valrose family was like.

She'd left with nothing when they divorced. Showing up at the Valroses now likely meant she'd hit rock bottom.

Though their marriage had been transactional, remembering how she'd cared for him, Ethan picked up his suit jacket.

"Prepare the car."
###Chapter 12

Oliver Roland's dull eyes suddenly lit up.

Natalie Valois's face turned deathly pale.

Her fingers dug into her palms as she stared at the familiar figure in the doorway.

"Vivian?"

The name she hadn't heard in five years pierced her heart like a dagger.

Wasn't Vivian supposed to be dead?

She had sent people to search everywhere, but found no trace of her.

Yet here Vivian stood, alive and well at her engagement party.

What shocked her more was Vivian's face—once disfigured, now more radiant than ever.

"Impossible..." Natalie's voice trembled.

Oliver had already shaken off her hand and rushed toward Vivian. "Vivian!"

He opened his arms eagerly, only to be blocked by the man beside her.

Lucas Lefèvre stood between them with a cold expression. "Keep your distance."

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Congratulations on your engagement."

"It's not what you think!" Oliver protested desperately. "This was arranged by my family. I have no feelings for Natalie!"

The guests erupted in murmurs.

"Get out, Vivian!" Natalie shrieked.

Vivian remained composed, her presence overwhelming.

"I came to give you a gift," she said lightly. "I planned to give you a piece of land, but it seems you don't need it now."

Natalie's eyes widened. "You're the one who took that land?"

"Nothing's yours until the contract is signed." Vivian produced an exquisite box from her clutch. "But I have something else for you."

Natalie eyed the box warily.

"Open it," Vivian urged with a charming smile.

Inside lay a single pill.

"What is this?"

"Have you forgotten already?" Vivian tilted her head. "The same thing you gave me years ago. Take it now, and we're even."

Natalie's hands shook.

She remembered the pill's effects—Vivian's ruined face was proof enough.

"You're trying to poison me?" Natalie flung the pill away.

"So you admit it was poison?" Vivian's gaze turned icy. "You're confessing to what you did?"

"That's nonsense!" Natalie forced composure. "Your disappearance had nothing to do with me!"

"I gave you a chance." Vivian sighed.

At that moment, the banquet hall's screen flickered to life.

"Mr. Wang~ You promised me the project if I kept you company tonight~"

The video showed Natalie in a revealing dress, perched on a middle-aged man's lap.

His greasy hands roamed her waist. "That depends on how well you perform..."

The two soon became entangled on screen.

"Turn it off! Now!" Natalie screamed, lunging for the controls.

This was the price she'd paid last week to secure a deal—now exposed before Oliver's entire family.

The technicians panicked. "The system's hacked! We can't stop it!"

As the video continued, the guests' whispers grew louder.

Natalie collapsed to the floor.

Her carefully planned engagement party was ruined.
###Chapter 13

Ethan grabbed Vivian's wrist.

"So the bride was in such a hurry to get engaged because she needed someone to take responsibility."

"Poor Oliver Roland. Cuckolded before the wedding even happened."

The guests' whispers cut into Natalie like knives. She clutched Oliver's sleeve, voice trembling. "Oliver, please let me explain! I have nothing to do with this man!"

Oliver coldly shook her off, his gaze fixed on Vivian. "No need. The engagement is off."

He should have been with Vivian all along.

Natalie trembled violently, her carefully applied makeup unable to hide her twisted expression. She lunged at Vivian. "You bitch! I'll kill you!"

Lucas seized her wrist, lifting her like a ragdoll.

"Afraid people will talk about your dirty little secret?" Vivian smirked. "Do you like this engagement gift, sister?"

Her dress swirled elegantly as she turned and walked away without looking back.

Natalie collapsed to the floor, screaming hysterically. "Vivian! You'll pay for this!"

Vivian didn't even break stride. Since when had she ever been afraid?

Outside the ballroom, Vivian hurried down the hallway. A familiar voice called from behind. "Vivian?"

Her body went rigid.

Ethan Roscente.

He'd seen her true self at the bar last time. If he recognized her now, it would be disastrous.

"Let's go!" She grabbed Lucas' arm to flee.

Ethan strode forward and seized her wrist. "Stop!"

Vivian whirled around, burying her face in Lucas' chest.

"Get rid of him," she whispered.

Lucas understood, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "Sir, mind your manners."

Ethan glared at the figure in the man's arms, eyes dangerous. "Who are you?"

"Her boyfriend." Lucas lifted his chin defiantly. "Now move aside. My girlfriend's tired."

"Boyfriend?" Ethan scoffed. "I'm her ex-husband."

He reached for Vivian, but Lucas blocked him.

"Ex-husbands should know their place." Lucas enunciated each word. "She's mine now."

A sharp pain stabbed through Ethan's chest. No wonder she'd been so eager to divorce—she'd already found her next target.
###Chapter 14

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes, radiating an aura of undeniable authority.

"When did this start?"

Lucas Lefèvre met the man's gaze coldly.

If Ethan hadn't wasted Vivian's four years, her career would have soared much earlier.

"None of your business."

"How is it not my business? If Vivian cheated during our marriage—"

"She didn't!" Lucas raised his voice sharply.

No one could slander his sister in his presence. If Vivian hadn't cut all ties these years, he would have confronted Ethan sooner.

"You know perfectly well who was unfaithful. Who was the one who never came home for four years while entangled with another woman?"

Ethan fell silent.

His relationship with Sophia Evans was far more complicated than it appeared.

"It's not what you think."

"So the private yacht wasn't real? The years spent with another woman weren't real either?" Lucas pressed relentlessly.

Ethan had no rebuttal. He had indeed wronged Vivian.

Vivian gently tugged at Lucas's sleeve.

"Let's go."

Lucas shielded Vivian as they turned to leave.

Ethan watched their retreating figures, an inexplicable tightness in his chest.

The divorce was meant to free Vivian from the constraints of being Mrs. Roscente so she could pursue her own life.

With this young man protecting her, Vivian probably hadn't suffered at the Valrose family's hands.

Only then did Ethan notice the chaos at the engagement venue. The bride wept on the spot while the groom struggled against those restraining him from chasing after them.

Guests whispered among themselves, discussing the dramatic scene.

Ethan had his people investigate what happened.

Relief washed over him knowing Vivian hadn't been humiliated, but his brows soon furrowed again.

That Oliver Roland was also interested in Vivian?

Ethan's expression darkened. His indifference toward Vivian stemmed from lack of feelings, not her appearance. But how did her looks attract so many suitors?

...

In the car, Vivian spoke softly.

"Thank you, Lucas."

Without Lucas's timely intervention, her identity as Dr. Luna would have been exposed.

But why had Ethan appeared at the Valrose engagement party?

"Viv, that was your ex-husband? I should've taught him a lesson. Letting him off was too easy."

Vivian shook her head. "There'll be other chances. Take me to Isabella's first."

Langley Corporation.

Isabella Langley was reviewing documents when Vivian arrived. She immediately pulled her into the office.

"You're giving me more work again!" Isabella pouted in complaint.

"To the capable go more responsibilities. That's what makes our Isabella so exceptional."

"I heard you had Lucas steal Natalie's project? She spent months preparing that land deal. How much did it cost you?"

Vivian nodded. "We'll recoup it. Money can be earned back slowly. What matters is the satisfaction."

"What about this real estate company? Will you keep operating after securing the project?"

Triple Six Realty was a temporary venture Vivian registered, its name playing on "Valrose."

Their first project was hijacking Natalie's deal.

"Since it's established, we might as well continue."

Isabella waved her hands. "Don't hand this to me! You've been an absentee boss all these years. I deserve compensation—a long vacation!"

"No problem. Lucas and I will handle everything."

"Which company will you oversee first? Real estate? The atelier? Or the perfume brand?"

Vivian smiled. "I'm reporting to the hospital tomorrow. I promised Nathan I'd assist."

Isabella's eyes widened.

What happened to that promised vacation?
###Chapter 15

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Vivian Laurent rubbed her eyes. Her phone screen lit up with a message from Isabella Langley: "Reporting to the hospital today?"

"Mhm," Vivian replied tersely.

Isabella's next message carried playful teasing: "Ethan Roscente would lose his mind if he knew you're Dr. Luna."

Vivian's fingers stilled. She recalled Ethan's icy gaze at the Valrose estate yesterday. "He'll never find out."

Isabella sent a virtual hug. "Forget about him. By the way, there's an S-class contract on the Dark Web. Eight-figure commission."

"Not interested," Vivian replied decisively. "The organization hasn't finished their investigation yet."

She rose and selected a lab coat from her wardrobe. The woman in the mirror had cool, detached eyes—no one would suspect this facade concealed the identity of Dr. Luna.

The hospital lobby buzzed with activity. Nathan Clementson waited by the entrance, immediately approaching Vivian. "Junior, the dean has everything arranged."

"I said a regular physician position," Vivian murmured.

Nathan nodded with a smile. "Relax. Only the dean and I know your real credentials."

Whispers followed them down the corridor. A young female doctor leaned toward her colleague. "I heard she never even attended medical school."

"Must've gotten in through connections," a male doctor sneered.

Vivian ignored the gossip. She accepted the medical chart from Nathan. "I'll do rounds."

"The VIP ward is on the top floor," Nathan reminded her. "The Garnache heiress has her follow-up today."

Vivian nodded. She didn't notice Daniel Ashcroft watching her from the shadows, his expression venomous.

"Let her handle it," Daniel told his companion. "The Garnaches aren't to be trifled with."

The elevator doors closed. Vivian reviewed the chart—congenital heart disease, surgery performed three months ago by Dr. Luna. Her lips curved slightly. No one knew the masked surgeon now stood here in plain sight.

She entered the private suite. A middle-aged man rose abruptly. "You are?"

"Dr. Laurent. Here for your daughter's examination."

The man frowned. "Where's Dr. Wang?"

"On leave today." Vivian lied smoothly. She approached the bed where a small girl regarded her nervously.

"Don't be afraid." Vivian's fingers found the child's pulse. After a moment, she announced, "Good recovery, but we need to adjust the digoxin dosage."

The man's eyes narrowed. "Are you certain? Dr. Luna specifically said—"

"Dr. Luna said the first three months are critical," Vivian interrupted. "Her current heart rate requires halving the dose."

The man's eyes widened. "How would you know Dr. Luna's exact words?"

Before Vivian could respond, the door burst open. Daniel marched in with a group of physicians. "Mr. Garnache, this woman has no medical license!"

The room froze. Vivian studied Daniel's triumphant expression, then slowly withdrew an item from her pocket.

"Who said I'm unqualified?"
###Chapter 16
The Savior

Vivian Laurent familiarized herself with the hospital layout before picking up the medical charts to begin her rounds.

She specifically asked Nathan Clementson about Emily Garnache's condition. The young girl who had been critically injured in the car accident was now out of danger after Vivian's life-saving surgery.

"Mr. Garnache has been inquiring about you," Nathan adjusted his glasses. "He wants to thank you in person, but I haven't disclosed your identity as per your request."

"I'll check on her recovery."

Vivian put on her surgical mask and headed straight for the VIP ward.

The Garnache family, being one of the city's most influential, had arranged the highest level of care for their daughter. The past few days had seen a steady stream of visitors from various circles, all turned away by security.

"I'm the new attending physician." Vivian showed her ID and underwent strict checks before being allowed entry.

Emily looked much healthier now, a far cry from the girl who had been fighting for her life on the operating table.

"Are you the new doctor?" Emily blinked her large eyes.

"Just started today. I'm here for your routine check-up."

Warmth filled Vivian's chest as she looked at the life she'd pulled back from death's door. This was the most precious reward of being a doctor.

"Sit here!" Emily patted the edge of the bed, pouting. "Mom and Dad won't let me get up. I'm so bored!"

The accident had left the entire Garnache family shaken. As their only child, Emily was their most treasured jewel.

"They mean well." Vivian spoke softly. "Sit up straight. Let me examine you."

The results showed excellent progress. All Emily needed now was continued rest.

"I heard the doctor who saved me was a young woman too," Emily suddenly said. "I really want to thank her. Mom said if it weren't for her, I might have..."

"She'll feel your gratitude." Vivian's voice was gentle.

"By the way, what's your na—"

The door burst open before Emily could finish. Mr. Garnache stormed in, his expression darkening when he saw an unfamiliar doctor. "Who authorized your presence? My daughter only receives treatment from Dr. Clementson!"

He'd rushed over from an important meeting after receiving a call about an unapproved intern barging into his daughter's room.

The anonymous tip had come from Daniel Ashcroft.

In his office, Daniel smirked at his colleagues. "Everyone knows Mr. Garnache's temper. Once he explodes, Clementson is finished."

He'd long coveted the department head position, with the brilliant Nathan being his main obstacle.

"The hospital won't risk offending the Garnaches for one doctor. When that happens, the department head position..."

Daniel narrowed his eyes, already picturing Nathan being thrown out.
###Chapter 17

"Get out!"

The air in the hospital room turned icy. Mr. Garnache's years in the business world radiated an oppressive aura.

Vivian's lab coat gleamed coldly under the sunlight. The corner of her lips curved beneath her mask. "Are you sure, Mr. Garnache? Once I leave, it won't be easy to bring me back."

"I said get out! If you dare harass my daughter again, you'll regret it!"

"Dad!" Emily stomped her foot in frustration.

Vivian turned and walked away, her lab coat swishing sharply behind her.

News traveled fast. The moment Vivian returned to her office, Daniel Ashcroft barged in.

"Some people really don't know their place," he sneered, leaning against the doorframe. "Daring to provoke Mr. Garnache."

Vivian didn't even look up. "Don't you have patients to attend to, Dr. Ashcroft?"

"I'm just giving you a friendly warning," he scoffed. "Relying on Nathan Clementson's connections won't save you forever."

"When did this hospital turn into a zoo?" Vivian finally met his gaze. "I hear barking everywhere."

Daniel's face darkened. "Who are you calling a dog?"

"If the shoe fits." She flipped through a patient file calmly. "By the way, I heard about last week's surgery..."

He slammed the door on his way out.

Back in the hospital room, Mr. Garnache was still fuming. His precious daughter needed rest after her surgery.

A bodyguard knocked gently. "Mr. Garnache, Mr. Roscente is here to see you."

"Ethan Roscente?" Mr. Garnache frowned. "Let him in."

Ethan entered with a bouquet of flowers, exuding authority with every movement.

After exchanging pleasantries, Ethan glanced at Emily. "Mr. Garnache, may we speak privately?"

In the hallway, Ethan cut straight to the point. "Any leads on Night's whereabouts?"

"I'm searching for her too," Mr. Garnache sighed. "She saved Emily's life. I owe her my gratitude."

Ethan's eyes darkened. "My father's condition is critical. If you hear anything..."

"You'll be the first to know," Mr. Garnache promised solemnly.

The moment Ethan left, Nathan's call came through.

"That female doctor?" Mr. Garnache dismissed. "I already—"

Whatever Nathan said next made his eyes widen. "She's... Night?!"
###Chapter 18

Ethan Roscente strode toward the elevator with measured steps.

Simon Eisner followed closely, rapidly scrolling through files on his tablet.

"Mr. Roscente, the latest financial report shows suspicious fund movements. Victor Roscente's people have started making their move."

The Roscente Group had grown rapidly over the years, with Victor always watching like a hawk.

"They've moved the shareholders' meeting to tomorrow. They're trying to catch us off guard."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

"Head to the office first."

The elevator doors slid shut.

"Still no word from Dr. Luna," Simon reported in a low voice.

Ethan tapped the railing absently.

"Keep searching."

The elevator reached the ground floor.

The hospital lobby bustled with activity.

Vivian Laurent hurried toward the elevators, medical chart in hand.

She was on rounds today, checking a postoperative patient with abnormal symptoms.

At the corner, she froze mid-step.

Ethan and Simon were stepping out of the elevator.

Vivian's heart skipped a beat.

She quickly lowered her head, pretending to organize her charts.

"Dr. Laurent! Chief Zhou is looking for you!"

The nurse's call made Vivian stiffen.

From the corner of her eye, she saw Ethan pause abruptly.

Vivian quickened her pace to leave.

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

"What was that doctor's name?"

Simon immediately understood.

"I'll find out."

Moments later, Simon returned.

"It's the new general surgery resident, Dr. Laurent. Probably just a coincidence."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

"She practices medicine?"

"Mrs. Roscente doesn't have any medical background," Simon answered carefully.

Ethan stared down the hallway.

"Look into it."

"The shareholders' meeting is about to start," Simon reminded.

Ethan withdrew his gaze and strode away.

Vivian hid around the corner, palms sweating.

She hadn't expected to run into Ethan at the hospital.

Even less that he'd react so strongly to the name "Vivian."

"I need to update my credentials."

She bit her lip, considering her options.

Her hospital records needed immediate adjustments before Ethan uncovered the truth.

At the end of the hallway, Ethan's figure had disappeared.

But Vivian knew the real trouble from this chance encounter was only beginning.
###Chapter 19

The red light above the operating room dimmed as Vivian Laurent removed her blood-stained gloves. Short-staffed in the ER, she had been called in to assist with an emergency procedure.

Footsteps echoed urgently down the hallway. A nurse rushed over. "Dr. Laurent, Mr. Garnache has been waiting in your office for quite some time."

A slight frown crossed Vivian's face as she quickened her pace. From a distance, she spotted a cluster of lab coats gathered outside her office, with Daniel Ashcroft at the center, animatedly holding court.

"Ah, Dr. Laurent finally graces us with her presence," Daniel sneered, stepping into her path. "Mr. Garnache has been waiting forty minutes. Good luck explaining that."

Whispers rippled through the group:
"Emily Garnache's condition worsened..."
"He's here to confront Vivian..."
"This should be entertaining..."

Vivian pushed past them and opened her office door. Mr. Garnache stood with his back to her, staring out the window.

"You needed to speak with me?" Her tone was calm.

Outside, the crowd held their breath, anticipating an outburst. Instead, Mr. Garnache spun around and bowed deeply.

"Dr. Laurent, I was blind to your skill!" His voice trembled. "Please, examine my daughter again!"

Gasps erupted in the hallway. Daniel's face drained of color.

Vivian remained composed. "Emily's vitals are stable. No further evaluation is necessary."

"I was wrong!" Beads of sweat formed on Mr. Garnache's forehead. "Name your terms—anything!"

Her gaze flicked toward the door. "Then clear the spectators."

Mr. Garnache stormed out, scattering the onlookers. Daniel bolted so fast he nearly collided with a medication cart.

Once the door closed, Mr. Garnache lowered his voice. "Dr. Luna, Dean Remetio told me everything. You saved my daughter twice. The Garnache family owes you a lifelong debt."

Vivian's eyes glinted. "There is something you can do for me."

"Anything!"

"If Ethan Roscente comes asking about me..."

"Understood." He clasped his hands. "My lips are sealed."

She gave a faint nod, fingertips tapping lightly on the desk. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating her ID badge—General Surgery Department: Vivian Laurent—in bold letters.
###Chapter 1

The Roscente Group headquarters stood tall in the city skyline.

Ethan Roscente strode into the boardroom with measured steps, his leather shoes clicking sharply against the marble floor. The chatter inside ceased instantly.

Victor Roscente shot up from his seat, face dark with anger. "Weren't you negotiating the Paris project?"

Ethan loosened his tie with one hand, the other tucked casually in his trouser pocket. "How could I miss such an urgent board meeting called by my dear uncle?"

"The domestic operations are under my jurisdiction!" Victor slammed both palms on the conference table. "You've been expanding overseas for years. What gives you the right—"

"Fifty-one percent shareholding." Ethan's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Uncle seems to have forgotten who saved Roscente from bankruptcy."

The room fell deathly silent. Victor's face cycled through shades of pale and purple as the humiliating memory resurfaced.

Ethan turned toward the exit. "You're welcome to take Roscente back anytime... if you're capable."

In the CEO's office, Simon Eisner waited with a tablet. "Sir, we've compiled Vivian Laurent's profile. Medical school graduate. Nathan Clementson recommended her for the hospital position."

Ethan's finger paused on the screen. "Nathan... Dr. Luna's senior?"

"Another development." Simon lowered his voice. "Bidding has started for the West District land. Among the competitors is a new firm called Triple Six Realty."

......

Hospital corridors buzzed with activity as Vivian walked alongside Nathan.

"Master asked about you last month." She waved a medical chart playfully. "Still not reconsidering inheriting his practice?"

Nathan chuckled. "I'm content where I am. Dinner at your place tonight?"

"Perfect. Lucas is cooking."

The evening air carried savory aromas through the apartment. Lucas Lefèvre moved deftly in the kitchen while Isabella Langley discussed new designs with the twins, Amy and Erin.

"Boss!" Erin bounded over with a wineglass. "My jewelry studio needs reinforcements!"

Isabella shoved a tablet into Vivian's hands. "I'm taking leave. Triple Six Realty is yours now. Win that West District bid."

The Roscente Group logo flashed across the screen. Vivian's fingers drummed lightly against the table, a smirk playing on her lips.

"How intriguing." Her eyes gleamed. "My ex-husband's company?"
###Chapter 21

Vivian Laurent flipped through the bidding list, her fingers pausing briefly on the Roscente Group's documents.

Triple Six Realty's name sat alone at the bottom, looking particularly insignificant.

A faint smile touched her lips as a sharp glint flashed in her eyes.

The proposal she'd pulled an all-nighter to complete still carried the warmth from the printer. Rubbing her temples, Vivian walked into the hospital.

"Dr. Laurent, we're short-staffed in outpatient care." Daniel Ashcroft leaned against the doorframe, his smile not reaching his eyes.

The outpatient hall buzzed with activity.

Vivian's specialist consultation room stood empty.

She grabbed a chair and sat in the hallway instead, her gaze scanning the passing crowd like a medical scanner.

"Young man." She suddenly stopped a hurrying youth.

He frowned impatiently. "My mother's in the ER."

"Your liver shows abnormalities." Vivian stated bluntly.

The young man scoffed. "I had a perfect physical last year."

"Suit yourself." Vivian said no more.

Two hours later, the same young man rushed back drenched in sweat.

"Doctor! You're incredible!" His CT scan clearly showed liver shadows.

The hallway erupted instantly.

"Dr. Laurent, examine me next!"
"I was here first!"

A tidal wave of patients surged toward Vivian's consultation room.

Daniel Ashcroft smashed a teacup in his office.

Dusk settled heavily.

As Vivian stretched her stiff neck, the door swung open.

Ethan Roscente stood silhouetted against the fading light, his tall frame impeccably dressed in a tailored suit and perfectly knotted tie. An aura of unapproachable authority surrounded him.

Vivian's fingers paused slightly at the edge of her mask.

Their eyes locked, and the air between them froze.
###Chapter 22

The clinic lights carved sharp angles across Ethan Roscente's face. Shadows deepened the intensity of his gaze beneath prominent brow bones.

Vivian Laurent's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

She adjusted the metal strip of her surgical mask with practiced precision. The edges sealed flush against her skin.

"Registration form." Her voice dropped deliberately lower.

Ethan slid the document across the desk with unyielding force. The leather chair creaked faintly under his weight.

Vivian retrieved black-framed glasses from the drawer. The reflective lenses masked the flicker in her eyes.

"General Surgery doesn't entertain hypochondriacs."

"Abdominal pain." His expression remained impassive.

Her pen scratched a jagged line across the prescription pad.

"Try Gastroenterology."

The air thickened between them.

She felt his gaze piercing through the glasses, dissecting every microexpression.

"Night." Ethan suddenly uttered the codename. "Double your last fee."

Ink bled from her stationary pen tip.

"You're mistaken." Vivian adjusted her glasses. "I'm just a resident."

Her lab coat sleeve revealed a slender wrist.

Ethan leaned forward abruptly.

"That racing overtake technique matched your Nightfall Lounge rescue move."

The scent of disinfectant mingled with his cedar cologne.

Vivian slammed the medical chart shut.

"If every abdominal pain patient hallucinated like you, we'd need a Psychiatry department."

She yanked out a CT request form.

"CBC, abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, MRI..." Her pen nearly tore through the paper. "Twenty thousand deposit."

Ethan's hand trapped the emerging printout.

"Doctor Laurent needs money?"

"Standard procedure." She met his stare. "Unless Roscente Group can't afford it?"

A medication cart rattled past outside.

Ethan's lips curved slightly.

"You know me."

Her eyelashes trembled almost imperceptibly.

"It's on your registration." She gestured to the monitor. "Next patient's waiting."

The door handle turned abruptly.

"Dr. Laurent?" A nurse peeked in. "Emergency consult."

Vivian stood instantly, her coat brushing Ethan's knee.

"Tests are ordered." She slapped the forms down. "Decline them for actual patients in need."

Ethan examined the thick stack.

A crude smiley face was scribbled at the bottom.
###Chapter 23

The hospital corridor was eerily quiet in the dead of night.

Ethan Roscente strode back to Vivian Laurent's office with test results in hand. When he pushed the door open, only a solitary desk lamp greeted him.

"Where's Dr. Laurent?" His voice was icy.

"She's already left for the day," the nurse stammered.

Ethan's gaze lingered on the empty chair, a glint of amusement flashing in his eyes.

This woman dared to play games with him.

His long fingers tapped the desk rhythmically as a dangerous smirk curved his lips.

Vivian, do you really think you can run?

The next morning, Ethan was the first to arrive at the outpatient clinic.

He leaned against the wall, eyes fixed on the elevator doors.

When a nurse finally unlocked the clinic, he learned Vivian wasn't scheduled for consultations today.

"Hiding from me?" Ethan scoffed before heading straight to the General Surgery Department.

Inside her office, Vivian was engrossed in her computer screen.

"Vivian!"

Her fingers stilled at the sudden interruption.

She looked up calmly. "Can I help you, Mr. Roscente?"

"If you weren't guilty, why avoid me?" He stepped closer to her desk.

Vivian gestured to the duty roster on the wall. "As you can see, I'm not assigned to outpatient services today."

She took the test results he tossed at her and skimmed through them.

"All your vitals are normal. You're free to go."

Before Ethan could respond, Nathan Clementson burst in.

"Dr. Laurent!"

He froze upon seeing Ethan.

"Emergency surgery. Now." Nathan grabbed Vivian's arm and pulled her out.

In the hallway, he whispered urgently, "Does he recognize you?"

"Just suspicions." Vivian quickened her pace. "Don't worry. I can handle him."

As the operating room light flickered red, Ethan stood outside the VIP ward.

"Frequent visitor lately, Mr. Roscente." A jovial voice greeted him.

Ethan cut straight to the point. "That new doctor, Vivian Laurent. She resembles Night."

"Night? Working as a resident?" The man feigned surprise. "Renowned physicians like her don't just settle in hospitals."

Ethan swirled his tea absently when realization struck.

Night was legendary for one thing—her unparalleled racing skills.

He set the cup down, eyes sharpening.

Time to put this theory to the test.
###Chapter 24

The operating room lights dimmed as city lights began glowing outside the windows. Vivian Laurent rubbed her stiff neck, exhausted after three consecutive complex surgeries.

"You were brilliant today." Nathan Clementson removed his mask with admiration in his eyes. "That vascular suturing technique even put me to shame."

Vivian shook her head with a smile. "You flatter me, Nathan. I merely offered a suggestion."

A tall young doctor approached from the corridor. His well-defined muscles were visible beneath the lab coat, and intelligent eyes sparkled behind gold-rimmed glasses.

"Professor, I've compiled the research materials you requested." Ryan Fairsprene handed Nathan a folder, his gaze lingering on Vivian.

Nathan smiled. "This is Dr. Laurent, my junior colleague. Ryan, didn't you want to consult someone about nerve anastomosis techniques?"

Ryan's ears turned pink. "Dr. Laurent, could I trouble you for a few minutes?"

Vivian was about to decline when she noticed the earnest curiosity in his eyes. She sighed. "Walk with me then."

The pair headed toward the elevators, oblivious to the icy stares from behind the nurses' station.

"See that? Dr. Fairsprene barely acknowledges anyone, yet he's following that new doctor around like a puppy," one nurse whispered, nudging her colleague.

Chloe Ashcroft gripped her clipboard until her nails left deep indentations. Watching Vivian's slender figure, she hissed through clenched teeth, "Just another pretty face who got in through connections."

The underground parking garage was dimly lit. As Vivian fastened her seatbelt, blinding headlights suddenly flashed in her rearview mirror.

A black Maybach lurked like a predator, maintaining an exact distance behind her. Vivian frowned and deliberately slowed down—the pursuing vehicle matched her speed.

"How interesting." Ethan Roscente rested one hand on the steering wheel, fingers tapping rhythmically. He pulled alongside and lowered his window.

Vivian kept her eyes forward but suddenly accelerated at the turn. Screeching tires echoed as her red sports car shot forward like an arrow.

"Got you." Ethan's lips curved as he slammed the accelerator. The two vehicles raced through empty streets, their roaring engines piercing the night.

Meanwhile, in the hospital's top-floor office, Chloe sobbed into the phone. "Uncle, that Vivian Laurent is insufferable! Today she openly flirted with Dr. Fairsprene—"

A chilling laugh came through the receiver. "Don't worry, niece. I'll make sure she learns who really runs this hospital."
###Chapter 25

Vivian's car maintained a steady speed without the slightest fluctuation.

Ethan narrowed his eyes and suddenly accelerated at the next curve, sharply turning the steering wheel.

The two vehicles brushed past each other with a screeching metallic friction.

"Are you out of your mind?" Vivian slammed on the brakes and angrily banged on Ethan's window.

The window rolled down, revealing Ethan's sharply defined features.

"What a coincidence, Dr. Laurent." His lips curved in a faint smirk.

Vivian took half a step back, surprise flashing in her eyes above the mask. "Mr. Roscente? Is this how you treat someone who saved your life?"

"Brake malfunction." Ethan casually handed her a check. "For the repairs."

Vivian didn't even glance at it. "No need. Insurance will cover it."

"Working late, Doctor?" Ethan's gaze lingered on her tightly secured mask.

"Just finished surgery." She adjusted the mask. "Occupational hazard. I suggest you wear one too."

"You drive very steadily, Doctor." Ethan remarked abruptly.

"Took me three years to get my license." Vivian chuckled lightly. "Problem with my driving skills, Mr. Roscente?"

She'd noticed the trailing black sedan long ago.

Ethan's phone suddenly rang.

"Mr. Roscente, we found Night!" Simon's excited voice came through. "Just performed surgery in Country A."

Ethan's pupils constricted. "Confirmed?"

"Absolutely. The patient verified it personally."

Hanging up, Ethan studied the woman before him.

Could she really not be Night?

"Anything else, Mr. Roscente?" Vivian tilted her head. "If not, I need to rest."

As she turned, the corner of her mouth lifted almost imperceptibly.

Her arrangements in Country A had worked perfectly.

"Vivian." Ethan suddenly called out.

"Yes?"

"Next time we meet, I'd like to see your face."

Vivian waved without looking back. "I suggest making an appointment first, Mr. Roscente."

Ethan watched her retreating figure, fingers absently tapping the steering wheel.

This woman's reactions were too perfect.
###Chapter 26

Vivian Laurent's medical career differed from her colleagues. She worked under a flexible contract.

The Triple Six Realty project required her personal attention these days, so she took time off from the hospital.

She had personally drafted the government bid proposal already submitted. Now she needed to inspect the construction site of the land parcel acquired from the Valrose family.

As she arrived, a familiar figure caught her eye.

"Vivian!" Oliver Roland approached rapidly, his eyes alight with reunion joy.

Her brow furrowed. "Why are you here?"

"I've been searching for you since our last meeting," Oliver explained urgently. "Natalie said you stole her land. I guessed you'd come and waited here daily."

"My arrangement with Natalie is a business marriage. I have no feelings for her. She told me you were—"

"Stop." Vivian's icy tone cut him off. "My disinterest has nothing to do with the past."

She turned to a staff member. "Escort Mr. Roland out."

A dejected Oliver was led away.

News reached Natalie Valrose swiftly. She arrived in a fury as Vivian prepared to leave.

"You bitch!" Natalie swung her hand for a slap.

Vivian caught her wrist with crushing force, making Natalie pale.

"Tag-teaming with your husband?" Vivian smirked before delivering a stinging slap to Natalie's face.

"How dare you!" Natalie shrieked, clutching her cheek.

"Reciprocation." Vivian's gaze turned lethal. "Measure your strength before attacking next time."

"You stole my project, now my husband too?" Natalie spat through gritted teeth.

Vivian laughed scornfully. "I'll claim the project. But your husband? Not interested."

She stepped closer. "Your family excels at stealing husbands and fortunes though."

"Oliver is mine!" Natalie screamed hysterically. "I ruined your face once—I can do it again!"

"Control your husband. Keep him away." Vivian's eyes turned dangerous. "As for you... try me."

She walked away as Natalie's shrieks followed.

Natalie glared venomously at Vivian's retreating figure. Rumor said Triple Six Realty was bidding against Roscente Group for a government project.

She'd enjoy watching Vivian crushed by the business titan.
###Chapter 27

Golden sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating Vivian Laurent's desk. She closed the project proposal and tapped her fingers lightly on the cover.

The bidding venue buzzed with activity. Representatives from major real estate companies exchanged pleasantables in tailored suits. The arrival of Triple Six Realty went virtually unnoticed.

Vivian sat quietly in a corner. Dressed in a beige blazer with her hair casually tied up, she looked like a fresh-faced newcomer.

"I heard Roscente Group is determined to win this time."
"Of course. They've been preparing their proposal for three months."

Whispers floated through the air. A faint smile touched Vivian's lips as she opened her folder.

When Roscente Group took the stage, thunderous applause erupted. Their general manager delivered an eloquent presentation with polished 3D renderings.

Vivian was the last speaker. By the time she approached the podium, many attendees had already begun packing their documents.

"My vision for this land parcel is..."

Her cool voice filled the auditorium. Vivian didn't use slides, simply describing her concept in straightforward terms.

The room gradually quieted. Some took notes while others exchanged murmurs.

"...That concludes Triple Six Realty's proposal."

Scattered applause followed. Vivian bowed calmly and returned to her seat.

When the government representative announced Triple Six Realty as the winning bidder, the room erupted in shock.

"What company?"
"I've never heard of them!"

Vivian walked composedly to the signing table. Her signature flowed across the document without hesitation.

Outside, early summer breeze greeted her. Vivian took a deep breath and dialed a number.

"Isabella, we did it."

An excited shriek came through the phone. "I knew it! You're amazing, Viv!"

Meanwhile, chaos engulfed Roscente Group's real estate division. The sweating general manager called Ethan Roscente.

"Mr. Roscente...we've been outmaneuvered."

Ethan's pen scratched across the document he'd been reviewing.

"Find out who did this."

Simon Eisner soon reported back. "It's a newly established small company. The legal representative is Li Ming."

"Dig deeper." Ethan's eyes darkened. "I want to meet the real owner."

Night fell over the glittering city. Vivian and her team celebrated at downtown's hottest bar.

"Drinks are on me tonight!" Erin raised her champagne glass.

Vivian clinked glasses, amber liquid swirling in hers. She didn't notice the piercing gaze observing her from the VIP section above.

Ethan swirled his whiskey, brow furrowed. He barely registered Felix Valdemar's words beside him.

"What's caught your eye, Ethan?"

Setting down his glass, Ethan's attention locked onto a familiar figure in the first-floor booth.

"How interesting."

Vivian threw her head back to drink, her pale neck gleaming like pearl under the lights. Her unrestrained laughter contrasted sharply with her usual composed demeanor.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. Suddenly remembering something, he pulled out his phone and called Simon.

"Send me Triple Six Realty's registered address."

A cold smile curved his lips when he saw the familiar location. Adjusting his cufflinks, he stood.

"An old acquaintance requires greeting."

Vivian had just set down her glass when a chill ran down her spine. She turned and froze.

Ethan was cutting through the crowd, coming straight toward her.
###Chapter 28

Neon lights pulsed through Nightfall Lounge as deafening heavy metal music shook the walls.

Vivian Laurent entered with her team to find every seat occupied. The secret to her establishment's success lay in its exclusive craft cocktails.

"Viv, we have to celebrate properly tonight!" Aileen pulled her into a plush booth.

Crystal glasses glimmered under the mood lighting as servers delivered drinks.

"A toast to Viv's latest acquisition!"

The clinking of glasses echoed as Vivian downed her cocktail. Alcohol quickly loosened the atmosphere.

Emily suddenly slammed the table. "Just drinking is boring. Let's play a game!"

"What kind?"

"Truth or Dare!" She spun an empty bottle. "Whoever loses takes the punishment—no exceptions!"

The group cheered, all eyes turning to Lucas Lefèvre.

Lucas smirked. "I'm game."

Finally everyone stared at Vivian.

"I'll sit this one out," she waved dismissively.

"No way!" Emily grabbed her arm. "This party's for you!"

Several rounds passed with Vivian miraculously avoiding the bottle. Emily kept getting targeted instead, stomping in frustration.

"I'm switching seats with Viv!" Emily declared. "This spot's cursed!"

Vivian reluctantly changed places. The bottle spun—and landed directly on her.

"Truth or Dare, Viv?"

......

Two tall figures entered through the lounge's entrance.

"Sorry Ethan, all the private rooms are taken." Felix Valdemar pointed to a distant booth. "Only that section's available."

Ethan Roscente's gaze sharpened. That slender silhouette looked hauntingly familiar.

Beside her, a handsome man leaned in to whisper something. Ethan's pupils contracted—wasn't that the man from the Valrose estate?

"Ethan?" Felix followed his line of sight.

Ethan was already striding toward the booth.

Vivian sat surrounded by cheering friends.

"Choose already!"

"Truth then," Vivian said with a coy smile.

Emily's eyes sparkled. "My question is—was the sex good with your ex?"

Ethan froze mid-step.

"It wasn't." Vivian's voice rang clear. "He was terrible in bed."

Ethan: "......"

Standing mere feet away, his face darkened like a thundercloud.
###Chapter 29

"No way!" The crowd gasped in unison.

"Vivian, you should've dumped that useless husband sooner. What good is a man who can't perform?"

Ethan's face darkened instantly. He thought they'd parted amicably, yet here she was slandering him behind his back.

Before he could confront her, the next round began. The spinning bottle landed on Vivian again.

Vivian sighed.

She needed to change seats.

Amy squealed. "See? I told you it's the seat's fault! Truth or dare, Viv?"

"Dare." No way was she risking a truth bomb.

Amy's eyes sparkled. "Kiss any guy in this room."

Vivian froze.

"Can I pick another dare?"

"No takebacks!" The crowd chanted.

"You could always kiss Lucas."

As Vivian hesitated, an icy voice cut through the noise. "Vivian."

Her body tensed. She'd recognize that voice anywhere.

Why was Ethan here?

She kept her back turned. Without makeup, recognition would be disastrous.

Ethan advanced. The crowd instinctively parted under his commanding presence.

Damn, he's hot!

When he was steps away, Vivian lunged into Lucas's arms.

"Take me to the restroom." Her fingers clutched his shirt.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"Excuse us." Lucas tried shielding her.

Ethan seized Vivian's wrist. "Running away? Won't even face your ex-husband?"

The audience gasped. This was her ex?

And he had performance issues? Pitying glances rained on Ethan.

He bristled under their scrutiny. What the hell were they assuming?
###Chapter 30

Felix Valdemar stood beside Ethan Roscente, his eyes wide with disbelief.

The obese woman covered in festering sores from Ethan's wedding three years ago had undergone a complete transformation.

He remembered how she had clung desperately, like a repulsive toad.

"Move, or I'll vomit on you," Vivian Laurent slurred drunkenly.

Lucas Lefèvre repeated coldly, "Move."

Ethan's body stiffened slightly before he stepped aside.

Lucas supported Vivian as they walked toward the restroom.

Inside, Vivian swiftly pulled out her makeup kit.

With practiced precision, she dotted her face with dense clusters of scars, obscuring her delicate features.

The mirror reflected a grotesque visage.

This was the Vivian Ethan remembered.

Gasps filled the air when she emerged.

Ethan remained expressionless.

"Well, if it isn't Mr. Roscente after three years," Vivian sneered. "I thought you'd forgotten all about me."

Ethan glanced at the onlookers before gripping her wrist. "We need to talk."

Lucas moved to follow.

Vivian waved him off.

"Speak quickly," she said, shaking free of Ethan's grasp.

His brows furrowed. "You never used to frequent places like this."

The docile Vivian from his memory bore no resemblance to the woman before him.

"You know me?" Vivian laughed coldly. "How many times did we even meet?"

The sharpness in her eyes startled Ethan.

"I know you resent me," he said gravely. "Name your price. I'll compensate you."

Her smirk deepened.

"Your money means nothing to me, Mr. Roscente."

The steel in her gaze unsettled him.

Where was the timid Vivian from before?

"How will you survive without money?" he pressed. "The Valrose family won't support you."

"That's none of your concern," Vivian said icily.

"By relying on that pretty boy?" Ethan glanced at Lucas.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian snapped. "We're divorced. I'll see whoever I want!"

She turned and walked away without looking back.
###Chapter 31

Ethan Roscente froze at Vivian Laurent's sudden outburst. His knuckles turned white from gripping his fists too tightly.

The ink on their divorce papers had long dried.

What right did he have to question his ex-wife's life?

Yet an inexplicable fury burned hotter in his chest—especially when he saw Vivian smiling at that man.

"I was just worried about you," Ethan said, his voice rough.

Vivian scoffed, her eyes sharp with mockery. "How noble of you, Mr. Roscente."

She turned to leave, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"Vivian!" Ethan grabbed her wrist. "I divorced you so you could live better, not to end up in places like—"

"Places like what?" She yanked her hand free. "You're here too, aren't you?"

Across the lounge, Lucas Lefèvre stood up, his gaze wary.

Ethan's throat tightened. He wanted to say it was different, but the words died in a sigh.

"I'm fine," Vivian said, stepping back. "Don't bother."

As she turned, the ends of her hair brushed his fingertips, carrying the faint scent of jasmine.

Lucas approached. "Everything okay?"

"What can he do?" Vivian downed her drink in one gulp. "Eat me alive?"

The bottom of the glass reflected her reddened eyes.

Ethan stood rooted in place, watching Vivian surrounded by friends. She laughed freely, tiny creases forming at the corners of her eyes.

This was exactly what he wanted for her.

"Ethan?" Felix Valdemar cautiously approached.

"Drinks." Ethan strode to the nearest booth—directly facing Vivian's table.

He saw her suddenly excuse herself, heard her say, "Work tomorrow."

Work? His brow furrowed. He pulled out his phone and texted Simon Eisner: "Find out what Vivian's been up to."

In the hospital hallway, Chloe Ashcroft slammed a coffee cup onto the desk in front of Vivian.

"Get me an Americano."

Vivian didn’t look up from the medical chart. "Caffeine causes tremors."

"You—!" Chloe's cheeks flushed with anger. "A mere intern dares—"

"Even interns prioritize patient safety." Vivian snapped the file shut. "Unless Dr. Ashcroft lacks that basic knowledge—"

Chloe snatched the chart from her hands. "Who do you think you are?!"

Papers scattered across the floor as the chart went flying.

Vivian knelt to gather them one by one. Her nails dug into her palms, but she flashed a flawless smile at the security camera.

"Dr. Ashcroft," she said softly, "your surgery is scheduled for 3 PM."

Chloe stormed off in her stilettos.

Vivian slammed the chart onto the desk, sending a pen clattering to the ground.
###Chapter 32

Vivian Laurent ignored Chloe Ashcroft's provocation, which only infuriated Chloe more.

The General Surgery Department was fully booked with surgeries today. Almost every doctor was busy in the operating rooms.

Fresh from receiving her official employment notice, Chloe carried herself with arrogant pride. She deliberately placed her certification in the most visible spot on her desk.

This was her first time leading a surgery. Daniel Ashcroft had promised to supervise personally, but an emergency disrupted their plans.

"Critical trauma patient incoming! Where are Chief Clementson and Dr. Ashcroft?" A nurse rushed into the surgical prep area in panic.

Nathan Clementson was already in surgery. Daniel Ashcroft was about to scrub in. No other doctors were available.

"I'll handle it." Vivian stepped forward.

Daniel frowned. "What can an intern possibly do?"

With no other options, Daniel had to abandon supervising Chloe's procedure. Chloe brimmed with confidence. "Don't worry, Uncle. I could perform this simple surgery blindfolded."

Daniel patted her shoulder. "I trained you myself."

Chloe had every reason to be confident. Born into a medical dynasty, she'd trained at top international medical schools.

Just before the procedure began, an assistant doubled over with severe abdominal pain. Chloe scanned the room and pointed at Vivian. "You'll assist me."

Had she known Vivian's true identity, she wouldn't have dared let her through the operating room doors.

Vivian agreed readily. "Fine."

She wasn't doing Chloe any favors—only prioritizing the patient's safety.

The subcutaneous cystectomy seemed straightforward. Chloe hummed while making the first incision until Vivian interrupted. "Stop!"

Chloe glared. "Who gave an assistant the right to interfere?"

"The cyst adheres to the valve. Your approach will damage surrounding tissue." Vivian's tone remained calm.

"Nonsense!" Chloe scoffed. "Are you questioning my judgment?"

"I'm stating facts."

"Silence!" Chloe insisted on proceeding.

Blood sprayed everywhere. The operating room fell deathly quiet.

Chloe turned pale. The excessive bleeding made her hands tremble.

"Move!" Vivian shoved Chloe aside.

With practiced precision, Vivian controlled the bleeding, sutured the wound, and removed the cyst flawlessly. The medical team watched in awe.

Her suturing technique surpassed even veteran surgeons.

Slamming the scalpel onto the tray, Vivian delivered her verdict: "Don't practice on patients if you lack basic skills."

Chloe's lips quivered without sound.

News spread through the hospital instantly. Though a minor procedure, Chloe's blunder was undeniable.

When confronted by hospital administrators, Chloe suddenly shrieked: "Vivian pushed me! She sabotaged my surgery on purpose!"
###Chapter 33

Chloe Ashcroft's grandfather Daniel Ashcroft was the hospital's vice president. The surgical mishap had alarmed the higher-ups, and an investigation team swiftly arrived at the hospital.

When Vivian Laurent was summoned to the office, Daniel and Chloe had been waiting impatiently. The dean was away on business and remained unaware of the situation.

"It's her!" Chloe pointed at Vivian with a shrill voice. "She deliberately pushed me during the surgery, causing it to fail!"

Daniel's face darkened. "Vivian Laurent, you're just an intern. Chloe gave you this opportunity out of kindness, and this is how you repay her? I recommend immediate termination. Nathan Clementson, as department head, should also be held accountable!"

Nathan frowned deeply. "Vivian would never do such a thing."

"Denying it with hard evidence right here?" Daniel scoffed.

Vivian crossed her arms, her gaze icy. "I warned her about the incorrect incision angle before the surgery. She chose to ignore me."

"That's a lie!" Chloe shrieked hysterically. "You pushed me and caused the mistake!"

"The operating room has surveillance," Vivian said calmly. "Let's review the footage."

Chloe smirked. "The system malfunctioned today. Nothing was recorded."

"How convenient." Vivian's lips curved slightly.

Nathan's palms grew clammy. He knew Vivian's special status, but without evidence, the situation looked dire for her.

"I did push her," Vivian suddenly admitted.

Chloe's eyes lit up triumphantly. "She confessed!"

Nathan stared at Vivian in shock as she walked calmly to the computer. "But I'd like everyone to see why I pushed her."

The Ashcrofts watched coldly, expecting Vivian's futile last stand.

Vivian's fingers flew across the keyboard as lines of code flashed on the screen. The onlookers exchanged confused glances.

Two minutes later, Vivian pressed Enter. "The footage has been restored."

Chloe's face turned ashen. "Impossible!"

The screen clearly displayed the deleted surgical recording.
###Chapter 34

The surveillance footage revealed every detail with crystal clarity.

Chloe Ashcroft's hand trembled as she held the scalpel.

Vivian Laurent's warning rang out clearly.

"Shut up!" Chloe snapped.

The moment the scalpel pierced the skin, blood gushed out.

Chloe stumbled back in shock.

Vivian lunged forward.

She pressed firmly on the bleeding point.

The footage showed Vivian maintaining a safe distance from Chloe the entire time.

"See it clearly now?" Vivian scanned the room. "I only intervened after she made the mistake."

The conference room fell dead silent.

Nathan Clementson smirked. "Dr. Ashcroft, you let an intern operate alone on her first solo surgery?"

Daniel Ashcroft's face darkened.

"I... I must have remembered wrong..." Chloe's voice shook.

Vivian met her gaze. "Lack of skill can be improved. A rotten character can't."

"You're lying!" Chloe shrieked.

"Deleting footage. Framing me." Vivian spoke deliberately. "The hospital will give me justice."

Chloe's eyes widened. "This footage—"

Nathan stepped in front of Vivian. "Will the deputy chief protect his own family?"

He pulled out his phone. "Shall I call the dean?"

Daniel's knuckles cracked from how tightly he clenched his fists.

Outside in the hallway, Ryan Fairsprene waited anxiously.

"It's over." Vivian gave a small smile.

The three of them walked away side by side.

Chloe stood in the shadows.

Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Vivian's retreating figure.
###Chapter 35

Nathan Clementson frowned deeply. "The surveillance footage was clearly deleted by Chloe Ashcroft. How did you recover it?"

Vivian Laurent tapped lightly on the keyboard. The screen immediately lit up with the video.

"Child's play for me."

She turned to Nathan with a sly smile. "Next time something like this happens, just call me. Chloe's been giving you trouble, hasn't she?"

Nathan merely smiled faintly.

Ryan Fairsprene couldn't resist chiming in. "The director always targets Dr. Clementson."

"Ryan!" Nathan cut him off sharply.

Vivian understood perfectly. Nathan was devoted to medicine and never engaged in petty office politics.

She patted his shoulder reassuringly. "No one gets to bully you while I'm around."

......

In the penthouse office of Roscente Group, Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes after hearing the report.

"Vivian Laurent handled Chloe's disruption?"

"Yes. Though it was just a minor procedure, Dr. Laurent remained remarkably composed under pressure."

Ethan dismissed his subordinate with a wave.

Leaning back in his chair, Vivian's image surfaced in his mind. This woman who shared his ex-wife's name kept giving him déjà vu.

His ex-wife knew nothing about medicine, while this Vivian was clearly a professional. Besides, she didn't have those scars on her forehead.

A knock interrupted his thoughts.

Simon Eisner entered briskly. "Mr. Roscente, we've obtained the files on Triple Six Realty."

Ethan took the documents. His gaze froze when it landed on a photograph.

"Him?"

The man in the photo was the same young man he'd seen accompanying Vivian twice before.

"The principal is Lucas Lefèvre. His background appears quite ordinary," Simon added.

Ethan smirked coldly. So this so-called "pretty boy" was actually a real estate company executive?

"Investigate Vivian's connection to this company," he ordered sternly. "And arrange a meeting with Lucas."

As Simon turned to leave, Ethan called him back.

"Remember—don't use my name."

A sharp glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. The business world was a battlefield, and he intended to uncover Lucas's true motives for getting close to Vivian.

He refused to believe anyone could genuinely be attracted to Vivian's scarred face. As her ex-husband, he simply had a duty to warn her against being deceived.

That was all.
###Chapter 36

Ethan Roscente arranged for someone to contact Lucas Lefèvre under a false identity.

Lucas frowned as he pushed open the private dining room door.

"Wrong room." He stepped back.

After checking the number, he confirmed it was correct.

"Come in." Ethan's voice came from inside.

"Ethan Roscente?" Lucas remained at the doorway.

"So you know me."

"I don't." Lucas's tone was icy.

His fists clenched. If Vivian hadn't stopped him, he would've taught this bastard a lesson long ago.

Lucas quickly texted Vivian: "Your ex set up a meeting. Trouble."

Ethan spoke abruptly: "What do you want with Vivian?"

"You don't deserve to say her name." Lucas sneered. "Not everyone's as calculating as you."

The audacity of this man mentioning Vivian.

"Spare me the act." Ethan narrowed his eyes. "You were seeing her before the divorce, weren't you?"

"You knew she was my wife and seduced her. Too bad she left with nothing. Your scheme failed."

In Ethan's eyes, Lucas was just a gold digger.

"Bastard!" Lucas swung a punch.

"Vivian must've been blind!"

Ethan took the hit, his expression darkening. This man resorted to violence. Did he hit Vivian too?

...

When Vivian arrived, the room was in shambles.

Ethan had Lucas pinned on the sofa.

"Let him go!" Vivian rushed in.

She struck Ethan's arm repeatedly. Trained in martial arts, Ethan easily overpowered Lucas.

Only at Vivian's appearance did Ethan release him.

She helped Lucas up, checking for injuries. "Where does it hurt?"

Lucas shook his head.

Seeing Vivian's concern twisted Ethan's gut. When he'd been in that car accident, she'd cared for him just like this.

He grabbed Vivian's arm.

"Stay away from him." Ethan's voice was cold. "He's violent and manipulated you into cheating for money."

Vivian stared in disbelief. "Are you insane?"

"I'm serious. He admitted it."

"What money?"

"He thought he'd get my assets in the divorce!"

Vivian shook him off. "Ethan, you need a psychiatric evaluation."

She'd known Lucas for years. That half-dead boy on the streets - she'd saved him herself.

No one knew Lucas better than she did.
###Chapter 37

"Must I repeat what I said at the bar that night?"

Vivian Laurent's voice was glacial, her gaze sharp as a blade. She helped Lucas Lefèvre up with practiced efficiency, bearing no resemblance to the docile wife from three years ago.

Ethan Roscente stood frozen.

"Let's go." Vivian pulled Lucas away without a backward glance.

"He's not even hurt!" Ethan called after them. His brow furrowed as he watched Lucas retreat. Was this pretentious man already manipulating Vivian?

......

Inside the black sedan, Vivian fastened her seatbelt. "Where are you injured? I'll take you home."

"I can drive," Lucas offered.

Vivian started the engine. "No need." She glanced at the rearview mirror. "What happened back there?"

"I threw the first punch." Lucas clenched his fists. "He accused you of adultery during your marriage. The hypocrisy is infuriating!"

Vivian chuckled. "Why bother with his nonsense?"

"Viv," Lucas turned suddenly, "do you still love him?"

Silence filled the car.

Vivian's fingers tightened imperceptibly. Three years hadn't erased everything. But the foolish devotion she once had? That was long gone.

"Don't ask childish questions."

"I'm only six months younger!"

"Fine, not a child." Vivian deflected with a smile.

After dropping Lucas off, Vivian noticed the familiar luxury car in her rearview mirror. It had been tailing her since the restaurant. Only one person would do that.

She deliberately pulled over.

Both vehicles came to a stop.

"You knew I was following you?" Ethan approached, his suit jacket billowing slightly in the night breeze.

Vivian crossed her arms. "Has Roscente Group gone bankrupt? You seem to have too much free time."

The streetlight illuminated the bruise on Ethan's face.

"Lucas isn't who you think he is."

"Does your first love know how concerned you are about your ex-wife?" Vivian's lips curved.

"She means nothing to me."

Vivian scoffed. "Three years and you still haven't won her over? The mighty Ethan Roscente, rejected."

"Why would I—"

Blinding headlights suddenly cut through the darkness. A speeding car veered straight toward Vivian.

Ethan lunged forward.

Vivian stumbled into that once-familiar embrace. The warmth of his chest against hers made her freeze.
###Chapter 38

The black sedan roared past, kicking up a gust of icy wind. Ethan Roscente instinctively pulled Vivian Laurent into his arms. They stood so close she could hear the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

The familiar scent of cedarwood enveloped her. It was uniquely Ethan—he never wore cologne, preferring handcrafted incense instead. The subtle fragrance lingered like him: aloof yet unforgettable.

Three years. For a fleeting moment, Vivian thought time had rewound.

She shoved him away with enough force to make him stagger back.

"Watch the car," Ethan murmured.

"Mm." Vivian turned her face away.

"About the divorce..." His voice was low. "Do you hate me?"

"Is there any point discussing this now?"

"I heard you found a job."

Vivian lifted her chin, her gaze distant. "Are you running a background check, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan's eyes burned into her. "I know a doctor named Vivian Laurent."

She scoffed. He was testing her.

"Common name. Surely you don't think it's me?" She deliberately flicked her hair. "I never even graduated college."

"But..." She stepped closer suddenly. "If you know any good plastic surgeons, do recommend them." Her fingertips grazed her cheek. "This face could use some work."

Ethan's expression darkened. "For that man?"

"Why not?" She batted her lashes.

"Your eyes need treatment too." His jaw clenched. "How is he worth it?"

Vivian smiled brighter. "Still better than some. Who's the blind one here?"

"Is this about Sophia Evans?" Ethan frowned. "It's not what you think."

"Not interested." She turned to leave.

A phone rang abruptly. Ethan glanced at the screen and declined the call.

It rang again. This time he answered. "Sophia?"

The tenderness in his voice made Vivian's fists tighten.

"Ethan, where are you?" A saccharine female voice floated through the speaker.

Vivian's lips curved. Time for payback.

She leaned toward the phone and purred in a honeyed tone, "Ethan, you're hurting me... Be gentler..."
###Chapter 39

Sophia Evans's knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone.

The heavy breathing coming through the receiver was unmistakably intimate.

How could there be a woman with Ethan Roscente?

For three years, she'd schemed endlessly without getting close to him. Now some woman had beaten her to it?

"Ethan, are you two—"

"Not now!" Ethan's hoarse voice cut her off before the call disconnected abruptly.

He turned to glare at Vivian Laurent. "You've got a death wish?"

Vivian tilted her head, mischief dancing in her eyes. "What? Going to hit me, Mr. Roscente?"

She subtly tensed her muscles. Though Ethan was a skilled martial artist, she was Shadow—the Dark Web's top operative.

"You're absolutely—" Ethan's temple throbbed with anger.

"Shouldn't you go comfort your superstar?" Vivian drawled. "Wouldn't want her crying now, would you?"

She slid smoothly into the driver's seat and sped away.

Ethan's figure grew smaller in the rearview mirror.

Vivian smirked. The man was probably fuming right now.

Ethan stood rooted to the spot, chest heaving.

Where had the docile Vivian gone?

This sharp-tongued version could drive a man to madness.

Yet somehow, she seemed more vibrant than ever.

...

Vivian had barely stepped inside when her phone rang again.

"Viv, when can you deliver the designs?" Amy's anxious voice came through.

AN Atelier's lead designer AN was Vivian's other identity.

Socialites worldwide clamored for AN's exclusive gowns—only ten unique pieces released annually.

"I've been busy. Soon."

"There's something else," Amy hesitated. "The perfume line wants Julian Cortez as spokesperson..."

Julian Cortez—the untouchable A-lister who never endorsed products.

Vivian laughed. "Leave it to me."

After hanging up, she walked to the sink.

Water washed away her disguise, revealing breathtaking features in the mirror.

Porcelain skin. Luminous eyes.

Vivian made a face at her reflection. What had she been thinking, falling for Ethan Roscente?
###Chapter 40

Ethan Roscente pushed open the apartment door to complete darkness.

He flicked the switch absentmindedly. Cold white light instantly flooded the empty living room.

His phone screen lit up with Sophia Evans' name flashing repeatedly.

He ignored the accumulating unread messages without hesitation.

After showering, Ethan draped a robe over his shoulders and lit a cigarette.

Amidst the curling smoke, he finally answered the call.

"Ethan, did I wake you?" Sophia's voice was tentative.

"Get to the point."

"Theo kept asking about you today. Said he misses Uncle Ethan."

The ash at Ethan's fingertips trembled slightly.

"Put him on."

"He's already asleep." Sophia's voice softened. "Lately he keeps asking if Uncle Ethan doesn't want us anymore."

She quickly added, "Kids say the darndest things. Don't take it to heart."

"I'll visit this weekend."

"Ethan... thank you for always looking after us." Sophia's voice cracked. "My health issues keep burdening you."

"My duty."

Several seconds of silence passed.

"Ethan..." Sophia hesitated. "That woman who answered earlier..."

"Just a friend." Ethan stubbed out his cigarette.

"Is she still there?"

The image of another woman in Ethan's bed made Sophia dig her nails into her palms.

"None of your concern."

"I only care about you." Sophia's voice turned plaintive. "Those online rumors about us..."

"Don't care."

"Well... goodnight."

Sophia hurled her phone onto the couch after hanging up.

The world thought she was Ethan's secret lover.

Only she knew the truth behind his special attention.

But the title of Mrs. Roscente would be hers.

Her eyes darkened as she dialed another number.

"Victoria, still awake?"

"Sophia?" Victoria Roscente sounded surprised. "You never call first."

"About your brother returning..."

"Don't remind me." Victoria groaned. "Father's furious, thinks he's coming for the company."

Sophia lowered her voice. "Has Ethan been seeing anyone?"

"I wouldn't dare ask." Victoria shivered. "His glare could kill."

"Do me a favor." Sophia softened her tone. "Find out who he met tonight."

"Sure." Victoria agreed readily. "But you owe me."

"Name it."

"My perfume company wants Julian Cortez as spokesperson." Victoria gushed. "You know him, right?"

Sophia frowned. "He never does endorsements."

"That's why I need you!" Victoria wheedled. "Landing his first deal would..."

"I'll try." Sophia said dismissively. "Or just ask Ethan."

Victoria snorted. "Him? I'm lucky if he doesn't yell at me. Though I am seeing him tomorrow... to ask for money!"
###Chapter 41

Ethan Roscente sat behind his expansive desk reviewing documents.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Enter," he said without looking up.

Victoria Roscente cautiously pushed the door open.

"Brother, are you busy?"

She lingered at the threshold, hesitant to approach.

Ethan finally raised his gaze.

"Did Victor send you?"

Victoria shook her head quickly.

"I heard you returned to the country. I came to see you."

Her fingers twisted together as her voice grew quieter.

Ethan set down his fountain pen.

"Get to the point."

Victoria swallowed hard.

"I want Julian Cortez as Vine Perfumes' spokesperson."

She blurted it out in one breath.

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

"No."

"Brother!" Victoria protested.

Ethan pressed the intercom.

"Simon, escort her out."

Simon Eisner appeared instantly at the door.

Victoria's eyes reddened with anger.

"You're always so heartless!"

She slammed the door behind her.

Sophia Evans' call came moments later.

"Ethan, please help Victoria."

Her pleading voice carried through the phone.

"She's done so much for Theo and me."

Ethan remained silent for a beat.

"Just this once."

Sophia nearly squealed with delight.

"Thank you, Ethan."

She hung up, a triumphant smile curling her lips.

Simon soon delivered bad news.

"Julian Cortez declined all endorsement offers."

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

"Arrange a meeting tonight."

Night fell.

Julian had just stepped from his car when his phone rang.

"Sister!"

He answered with delighted surprise.
###Chapter 42

Agent Wang nervously wrung his hands. "The Roscente Group is an industry giant. Offending them would ruin your career."

Julian Cortez glanced at his phone and abruptly interrupted. "I need to return to the hotel immediately."

"What?" Agent Wang's eyes widened. "This is a meeting arranged by Mr. Roscente himself!"

Before he could finish, Ethan Roscente appeared at the end of the hallway with his assistant. Beads of sweat formed on Agent Wang's forehead.

"Mr. Roscente, my apologies. Julian isn't feeling well—"

Ethan's icy gaze swept over them, sending a chill down Agent Wang's spine. Despite his youth, the Roscente heir exuded an intimidating presence.

"For the endorsement deal, I only want Julian." Ethan's voice was frosty.

Agent Wang forced a smile. "But Julian never does endorsements—"

"Tell me which hotel he's staying at." Ethan pulled out his car keys. "I'll speak to him myself."

The hotel corridor was bathed in soft light.

Vivian Laurent leaned against the wall, her eyes brightening when she spotted Julian. "Hey, superstar. Am I interrupting?"

"Vivian!" Julian rushed toward her. "I've been looking for you for three years!"

"What, afraid I was dead?" She laughed and playfully punched his arm.

Julian's eyes grew warm. Years ago, when his depression was at its worst, Vivian had pulled him back from the ledge. Later, she helped him break into the industry, paving the way for his rise to stardom.

"Where have you been all this time?" His voice tightened.

Vivian shrugged. "Got married."

"What?" Julian nearly bit his tongue.

"Divorced now." She waved it off. "Anyway, I started a fragrance studio. I want you to be the face of it."

"Done." His answer came without hesitation.

Vivian raised a brow. "Not even asking about compensation?"

"When have I ever refused you?" He pulled out his phone. "Let's grab dinner."

The elevator dinged as it arrived.

They stepped in, laughing—only to freeze when the doors opened.

Ethan stood in the center of the elevator, his gaze locked onto Vivian.

"Night?"
###Chapter 43

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent before shifting to Julian Cortez.

How did these two know each other?

Vivian was equally surprised. What was Ethan doing here?

She quickly composed herself. "You must have mistaken me for someone else. Who's Dr. Luna?"

A smirk played on Ethan's lips.

Dr. Luna was cunning, but he wouldn't let her slip away this time.

"I remember our encounters at Nightfall Lounge and the hospital quite clearly, Dr. Luna."

Julian's manager rushed over. "Mr. Roscente, this is our Julian."

"The endorsement deal is settled," Julian blurted out. "We just signed with Vivian."

Vivian's attempt to stop him came too late.

"Vivian?" Ethan seized on the name.

Dr. Luna... Vivian... Vivian Laurent!

"Vivian Laurent!" He called out sharply.

Julian looked between them. "You know each other?"

Vivian clenched her teeth.

She'd barely escaped last time. Now Julian's careless words had exposed her.

"You're mistaken," she insisted. "My surname is Sullivan."

The manager tried to mediate. "Why don't we all have dinner together?"

"No need," Vivian refused.

"I'd love to," Ethan countered.

Julian chimed in, "Come on, Vivian. It's a rare opportunity."

Reluctantly, Vivian gave in.

In the parking lot, Vivian hesitated to approach her own car.

"Ride with me," Julian offered.

Ethan grabbed Vivian's wrist. "This lady and I have things to discuss."

He practically shoved her into his car.

The interior felt suffocatingly small.

Ethan's long legs barely fit in the cramped space.

"Since when do doctors moonlight as brand ambassadors?" His tone dripped with implication.

"I told you—you've got the wrong person."

Ethan's laugh was cold.

Keep pretending.

He had all the time in the world to play her little game.
###Chapter 44

"Your name is Vivian Laurent?" Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes at her. "That's the same name as my ex-wife. I also know a doctor with that name."

"Age affecting your hearing, Mr. Roscente?" Vivian smirked coldly. "My surname is Lefèvre."

Ethan was rendered speechless.

Her attitude reminded him of his ex-wife after their divorce. But this face was completely different—her skin glowed like polished jade under the lights, radiating a pearlescent sheen.

His ex-wife had suffered from severe facial rashes, worked as a clerk at Triple Six Realty, and knew nothing about medicine.

"Dr. Luna, I was thinking—"

Vivian turned her back on him abruptly.

Ethan frowned. This woman's hostility toward him was baffling.

The car stopped at the restaurant entrance. Vivian was the first to exit, choosing the seat farthest from Ethan.

To curry favor, Manager Wang had pre-ordered the signature dishes. When the waiter inquired about dietary restrictions, Julian Cortez spoke up. "No mushrooms, cilantro, or carrots."

"Since when are you picky?" Manager Wang looked surprised.

"It's for Vivian." Julian glanced at her.

Warmth spread through Vivian's chest. After all these years, Julian still remembered her preferences.

Ethan's fingers stilled. His ex-wife had avoided those exact ingredients.

"Extra spicy." Vivian deliberately raised her voice.

Ethan's brow furrowed. His stomach couldn't handle spicy food.

"Got a problem with that, Mr. Roscente?" Vivian challenged him with her gaze.

"None."

The table soon filled with dishes swimming in crimson chili oil. Julian broke into a sweat just looking at them—as a celebrity, he couldn't risk eating such food.

Vivian ate with relish. Ethan watched her, chopsticks untouched.

His ex-wife had preferred bland flavors, never cooking anything spicy.

The pungent aroma of chilies made Ethan's stomach twinge with pain. But this was an opportunity to get closer to Vivian.

He picked up a bite and swallowed. Fiery agony exploded across his tongue.

Vivian enjoyed his pained expression, serving him a portion of spicy fish head. "Eat up, Mr. Roscente."

She'd once catered to Ethan's tastes. Now she could indulge her own preferences freely.

Ethan forced himself to continue eating despite the discomfort. Soon, his shirt clung to his back with cold sweat.
###Chapter 45

Ethan Roscente's stomach twisted with sharp pains.

He clenched his jaw, forcing himself to endure until dinner ended.

Julian Cortez stood up. "Let me drive you home, Vivian."

"Sure." Vivian Laurent deliberately raised her voice, her peripheral vision catching Ethan's pale face.

She walked out of the restaurant without looking back.

At the corner, Vivian suddenly stopped.

"Viv?" Julian watched in confusion as she headed toward a pharmacy.

At the glass counter, Vivian pointed decisively at two boxes of antacids. "For him."

Julian took the medicine. "Mr. Roscente?"

"Don't let him die in the restaurant." Her tone was icy. "Don't tell him it's from me."

Julian hesitated. "You two—"

"I'd buy medicine for a stray dog too." Vivian cut him off. "Hurry up."

"But you alone—"

"I'll take a cab." She waved him away. "I'll have someone contact you tomorrow about the collaboration."

In the private dining room, beads of sweat formed on Ethan's forehead.

"Mr. Roscente." Julian handed him the pills. "Antacids."

Ethan looked up sharply. "Did she tell you to buy these?"

"I bought them." Julian maintained his composure.

The medicine took effect quickly.

Ethan's phone lit up with Sophia Evans's incoming call.

"Did you succeed?" Her cheerful voice came through.

"Yes." Ethan answered curtly.

Sophia immediately called Victoria Roscente.

"Julian agreed!" she exclaimed excitedly.

Victoria logged into the company account and posted a silhouette of a mysterious spokesperson.

Fan groups exploded instantly.

"It's him!"

"Julian's taking an endorsement?"

When the news reached Amy, she was organizing files.

"Vivian!" She burst into the office. "Vine Perfumes stole Julian?"

Vivian raised an eyebrow and clicked the link.

Victoria's company logo stared back at her.

"So that's their game." She chuckled.

Amy stomped her foot anxiously. "What do we do?"

"Julian already signed."

"For how long?"

"Guess."

"Six months? A year?"

Vivian set down her pen. "Lifetime."

The office fell silent.

Amy's eyes widened. "L...lifetime?"

"Problem?"

"This is amazing!" Amy nearly hyperventilated. "This is an industry first!"

Vivian gazed out the window.

Neon lights flickered in the night.
###Chapter 46

Morning sunlight filtered through the blinds into the office. Vivian Laurent was organizing patient reports.

Amy was signing her contract today, but Vivian didn't attend. The hospital schedule was packed - she had no time for such trivial matters.

Chloe Ashcroft deliberately excluded Vivian from rounds with the department staff. Vivian simply shrugged and continued reviewing medical files.

"Dr. Laurent, could you take a look at this case?" Ryan Fairsprene approached with documents.

Vivian accepted the file and analyzed it carefully. The two leaned together discussing the condition, occasionally making notes on paper.

Across the room, Chloe glared daggers at them, nails digging into her palms. How dare this new intern openly flirt with the man she wanted.

"Keep staring like that and your eyes might pop out," Vivian remarked without looking up.

When Dr. Li from outpatient services fell ill suddenly, Vivian volunteered to cover. Mask secured, she sat in the examination room seeing patient after patient without pause.

"Next," she said, rubbing her temples.

"Stomach discomfort," came a deep male voice.

Vivian's head jerked up, nearly knocking over her water glass. Ethan Roscente sat across from her, lips curved in a faint smirk.

"Gastrointestinal issues belong in internal medicine," she said quickly, adjusting her mask.

"But everyone says Dr. Laurent has exceptional skills." Ethan tapped the desk with long fingers. "Or should I call you Dr. Shen?"

Vivian remained impassive. "You're mistaken. This condition is beyond my expertise."

"Then treat someone else for me." Ethan leaned forward. "Unless you'd prefer everyone knew the renowned Dr. Luna works here as an intern."

Vivian's eyes narrowed. So he'd uncovered her identity.

"My rules are clear," she said coldly. "No Roscentes. No Evanses."

"Why?" Ethan frowned. "Sophia Evans genuinely needs your help."

Vivian laughed abruptly. "Mr. Roscente, you're married, aren't you? Or rather, divorced - from someone who shared my name. What a coincidence. Now you want me to save your mistress?"

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply. "How did you know about the divorce?"

Few were privy to that information.

Vivian's pulse jumped, though her expression stayed neutral. "Research. If you weren't ashamed, why hide it?"

"Sophia and I are just friends."

"Friends warrant multiple pleas for help?" Vivian scoffed. "Do I look stupid?"

Ethan fell silent. Some truths couldn't be spoken.

Seeing his hesitation, Vivian pushed the registration form back. "Get out."
###Chapter 47

Ethan Roscente stood motionless, his lips curling into a cold smirk.

"As a doctor in this hospital, you must follow its rules. I brought Sophia Evans for consultation—you will see her."

Vivian Laurent continued writing in the medical chart without looking up.

"My examination room, my rules."

She snapped the chart shut with sharp finality, her gaze icy.

"Leave. Now."

A sudden cramp twisted Ethan's stomach, forcing him to retreat to the emergency room for IV fluids.

When he returned that afternoon, Vivian's office stood empty.

Inside the operating theater, tension hung thick.

"Five-story fall. Rebar through the chest. Multiple compound fractures."

Nathan Clementson briefed the team, handing Vivian the scans.

"Brain trauma too. Prognosis is grim."

Vivian scanned the CT images and snapped on gloves.

"Prep for thoracotomy."

On the table, her hands moved with blinding precision. Hemostats became extensions of her will, clamping each bleeding vessel with unerring accuracy.

"BP stabilizing!" a nurse exclaimed.

Four hours later, the operating lights dimmed.

The patient rolled out with steady vitals.

"Incredible!"

"Even Dr. Clementson couldn't have done better," staff murmured in the halls.

Chloe Ashcroft's friend whispered in her ear.

"See how Dr. Fairsprene looks at Vivian? Like she hung the moon."

Chloe's nails bit into her palms.

She stormed into Daniel Ashcroft's office.

"Uncle, Nathan's deliberately humiliating you!"

Daniel's expression darkened.

"That construction worker's surgery was rightfully yours!"

Chloe leaned closer, voice dropping.

"I know how to get Vivian expelled."

Daniel's eyes narrowed.

"How?"

A venomous smile spread across Chloe's face.

"Just watch the show."
###Chapter 48

Morning sunlight filtered through the hospital curtains.

Vivian Laurent pushed open the door to find Emily Garnache packing her schoolbag.

"You've recovered well." Vivian examined the girl's wound with a satisfied smile. "You can be discharged today."

Emily cheered and threw her arms around Vivian. "Thank you, Dr. Laurent!"

Mr. Garnache retrieved a thick envelope from his briefcase. "For your excellent care, Doctor."

Vivian gently declined. "Just doing my job."

"Then join us for dinner this weekend," Mr. Garnache insisted. "Emily keeps begging to watch movies with you."

Before Vivian could respond, the door burst open.

Ryan Fairsprene rushed in, pale-faced. "Dr. Laurent! Emergency!"

In the hallway, Ryan lowered his voice. "The fall victim from yesterday just died this morning."

Vivian froze. "Impossible!"

Chaos engulfed the first-floor ward.

A thick-necked man was screaming at the nurses' station. "Murderers! My brother could still talk when he arrived!"

A woman clutching an infant stood beside him, two young girls trembling behind her.

"Please remain calm," the duty doctor attempted to explain. "The patient's vitals were stable post-op—"

"Lies!" The man punched the wall. "Bring out the surgeon!"

Nathan Clementson stepped forward, but Vivian was already striding toward the commotion.

"I'm Dr. Vivian Laurent, the attending surgeon."

A mocking laugh cut through the crowd. Chloe Ashcroft leaned against the wall, drawling, "Ah yes, our most brilliant resident doctor."

She emphasized the word "resident" with deliberate malice.
###Chapter 49

The man's furious roar echoed through the hospital corridor outside the operating room.

"You let an intern operate on my brother?" He grabbed the head nurse by her collar. "Is this how your hospital treats human lives?"

The gathered family members of other patients gasped in shock.

"An intern performing surgery? This is outrageous!"
"I'm filing a complaint! My husband's surgery is scheduled for tomorrow!"

Vivian Laurent stepped forward, her lab coat swaying slightly with each step.

"I'm fully licensed." Her voice was calm but firm. "The entire procedure was recorded. We can review the footage anytime."

The man released the nurse and turned to Vivian.

"Bullshit! My brother was perfectly fine before your so-called surgery. How could he die right after?"

He slammed his palm against the wall, making the overhead lights flicker.

"No one leaves until I get answers!"

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "According to his post-op vitals, he should have woken up this morning."

She paused deliberately. "This kind of sudden death... is highly unusual."

The man's eyes darted briefly before he doubled down on his anger.

"Stop playing doctor!" Spittle flew from his mouth. "I want compensation! Ten million dollars! Not a penny less!"

A woman beside him tugged at his sleeve. "Brother, maybe we should—"

"Stay out of this!" He shook her off. "The kids need to eat!"

In the corner, Chloe Ashcroft smirked.

Vivian took a commanding step forward.

"If this was medical malpractice, the hospital will take responsibility." She locked eyes with the man. "But if someone committed homicide..."

The man involuntarily stepped back.

"Th-that's ridiculous!" Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "Trying to weasel out of this?"

Ryan Fairsprene couldn't stay silent. "The patient was out of danger!"

"Shut up!" The man jutted his chin defiantly. "Pay up, or I'll expose this hospital as a death trap!"

He pulled out his phone, pretending to start recording.

Vivian suddenly smiled.

"Perfect." She took out her own phone. "I was just about to call the police."

The man froze mid-motion.

"W-what do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Vivian dialed 911. "Let the coroner determine who's lying."
###Chapter 50

Ethan Roscente's car sped toward the hospital.

His brow furrowed as he contemplated how to persuade Vivian Laurent to save Sophia Evans.

His informants had already reported the emergency situation.

"Faster," Ethan commanded the driver in a low voice.

The hospital corridor buzzed with tension.

The deceased's brother stood at the forefront of grieving relatives, refusing any settlement.

Vivian spoke calmly. "If you won't allow an autopsy, at least let me examine him."

"Over my dead body! Who knows what tricks you'll pull?" the man snapped.

The eldest daughter wiped her tears. "Doctor, please look at my father—"

"Ungrateful girl! Can't you let your father rest in peace?" the uncle berated.

The girl fell silent in fear.

Vivian stepped between them. "No shouting in hospitals."

She knelt to the girl's level. "Don't be afraid. I'll find out what happened."

Turning to the man, her gaze turned sharp. "Obstructing an investigation suggests guilt. We have every reason to suspect you."

The man's eyes darted nervously. "Slander! He was my own brother!"

Vivian addressed the widow. "Your husband died under mysterious circumstances. Even with compensation money, could you and your children ever have peace?"

The woman broke down sobbing and finally nodded consent.

The man exploded. "Weak woman!"

Vivian examined the body meticulously.

The coronary artery rupture contradicted yesterday's test results completely.

She spotted anomalies in the oxygen machine settings.

"Someone tampered with the oxygen regulator," Vivian declared.

The oxygen concentration had been deliberately increased, causing oxygen toxicity.

The post-surgical organs couldn't withstand the stress and failed.

The perpetrator had tried restoring the settings but botched it in panic.

"Who accessed this machine?" Vivian scanned the room.

Medical staff shook their heads.

"Time of death suggests tampering two hours ago." Vivian locked eyes with the man. "Calculated cruelty."

Nathan Clementson suggested, "Check surveillance."

Footage clearly showed the man entering the room that morning.

"The thief cries 'stop thief,'" Vivian scoffed.

She pulled up his records. "Massive gambling debts. You'd trade your brother's life for money? Ever consider your family?"

The man's face twisted. "Framing me!"

"Police are on their way," Vivian said coolly.

The man's hand tightened around a concealed fruit knife.

His loan shark had promised debt forgiveness upon completion.
###Chapter 51
Ethan's Injury

The hospital corridor lights glared harshly.

Vivian squinted at the man claiming to be a patient's relative. His tailored suit couldn't hide the panic in his eyes.

"My brother's death wasn't the hospital's fault?" The man suddenly raised his voice. "You doctors always shift blame!"

Vivian's lips curled coldly.

Her slender fingers tapped the medical chart. "Surveillance shows you were the only one in the ICU last night."

The man's face drained of color.

"Lies!" He yanked a switchblade from his pocket. "Die!"

Steel flashed.

Vivian braced to counterattack when strong arms yanked her against a solid chest.

A pained grunt sounded in her ear.

Warm liquid splattered her hand.

"Ethan?" She looked up into his furrowed brow.

His dark suit sleeve gaped open. Blood dripped onto the tiles like blooming crimson flowers.

"Are you insane?" She shoved away from him. "I had it handled!"

Ethan pressed a hand to his wound, smirking. "This is your gratitude?"

Footsteps pounded down the hallway.

Security swarmed, pinning the attacker facedown.

Vivian crouched beside the restrained man. "Know who he is?" She pointed at Ethan. "The head of Roscente Group."

The man's pupils constricted.

"Two choices." Her voice turned glacial. "Rot in prison, or—"

"I'll talk!" The man screamed. "Someone paid me to tamper with the oxygen machine!"

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Ethan examined his blood-soaked sleeve, then shook his head at Vivian taking statements.

This woman even dared to exploit his reputation.
###Chapter 52

"What did you say?" The widow lunged at the man, raining blows on him with her fists.

"That was your own brother! When we were poor, he gave you his last bite of food! He dropped out of school to work so you could study! When you couldn't afford high school tuition, he secretly sold his blood for money! How could our family ever wrong you? And yet you—"

The man hung his head, voice trembling. "Sis... I'm sorry... I lost my way..."

He had become addicted to gambling and racked up massive debts with loan sharks. When desperate, someone contacted him with an offer—not only hospital compensation but an extra two million.

"Who put you up to this?" Vivian's voice was icy.

"I don't know... It was a woman on the phone..." The man cowered. "She said the bigger the scene, the more money I'd get..."

Vivian's sharp gaze swept the crowd. Chloe Ashcroft hastily looked down, nails digging into her palms.

"There must be transfer records."

"Yes! Yes!"

Ethan Roscente immediately ordered his team: "Trace it."

Within thirty minutes, they had their answer. The account belonged to Chloe's best friend.

"My God! It was Dr. Ashcroft?"

"Why would she do this?"

"Was she trying to frame Dr. Laurent?"

Chloe turned deathly pale. "Lies! This is a setup!"

Vivian smirked and redialed the number from the man's phone. Instantly, a shrill ringtone sounded from Chloe's purse.

"Care to explain?"

Chloe frantically silenced her phone, but it was too late.

"A doctor hiring a hitman?"

"I heard her last surgical mishap was covered up by her grandfather, the VP."

"She won't wriggle out of this one!"

Chloe's legs gave way, collapsing to the floor. Consumed by her vendetta against Vivian, she'd never considered the consequences.

"The facts are clear." Vivian looked down at her with disdain. "Someone like you doesn't deserve to wear that lab coat."

Police swiftly took Chloe away. She faced legal punishment and permanent revocation of her medical license.

As for the man who murdered his own brother for money—life imprisonment awaited him.

In a shadowed corner, Daniel Ashcroft trembled as he dialed a number. "Uncle... Disaster has struck..."
###Chapter 53

Vivian stood at the end of the corridor, her fingertips trembling slightly. She took a deep breath and approached the mother and daughter who were weeping uncontrollably.

"My condolences." She handed them a tissue. "I did everything I could on the operating table."

The older woman clenched the tissue, her knuckles turning white. "Dr. Laurent, we know you tried your best. The paramedics said... there wasn't much hope from the beginning."

Who could have predicted the patient would be taken off life support by his own brother right after stabilizing?

Ethan appeared behind Vivian without warning. He pulled out an embossed business card and handed it to the woman. "The Roscente Group has an education fund. We'll cover your child's tuition."

The woman froze, tears streaming harder down her face.

Vivian scoffed and turned to leave. Ethan followed swiftly, his white shirt sleeve stained with dark red.

"Take it off," Vivian snapped, slamming her office door shut.

Ethan leaned against the doorframe with a smirk. "In a hurry, Doctor?"

"One more word and I'll throw you out." She grabbed a pair of scissors. "When your wound gets infected and they have to amputate, don't come crying to me."

The shirt clung to the injury, peeling away with fresh blood. Vivian frowned. "Five-centimeter laceration. Needs seven stitches."

The clink of sterilized instruments filled the room.

"Why did you take that knife?" She pulled on gloves. "Don't think this changes anything."

Ethan stared at the ceiling. "Can't stand ungrateful bastards." He paused. "You were in surgery for eight hours."

When the needle pierced his skin, Ethan tensed. Vivian's fingers moved deftly, the suture thread glinting silver under the light.

Her lashes cast faint shadows beneath her eyes, a sheen of sweat on her nose. Ethan suddenly noticed a tiny mole near her right tear duct.

"Change the dressing in three days. No spicy food." She snipped the thread. "Now get out."

As Ethan buttoned his shirt, he murmured, "Dr. Laurent breaking her oath to save a Roscente... does that mean—"

"It means you need a neurologist." She slammed the forceps down. "I'm calling security if you're not gone in ten seconds."

A knock interrupted them. Nathan's voice came through the door. "Vivian? There's an emergency—"

When the door opened, he found Ethan adjusting his tie, Vivian's ears flushed pink.
###Chapter 54

Vivian Laurent stepped out of the office. Nathan Clementson stood waiting in the hallway.

"Senior," she called softly.

Nathan's brow furrowed. "Don't take this to heart. I know you hate hospitals because of all the politics. It was thoughtless of me to bring you here."

"How is this your fault?" Vivian gave a cold laugh. "Chloe Ashcroft would risk lives just to drive me away. Daniel Ashcroft must have known—he probably ordered it."

She paused. "Senior, they won't let you off either. Why not return to Master's place—"

"No." Nathan shook his head. "Hospitals may be complicated, but at least we can save lives here. That sense of fulfillment when patients recover is irreplaceable."

Vivian sighed. Her senior was too pure-hearted. Daniel Ashcroft would exploit that sooner or later.

"I came to tell you something," Nathan lowered his voice. "The surgery incident has blown up. Someone filmed it and posted online. The backlash is spreading."

"I don't care," Vivian said flatly.

Nathan looked troubled. "Daniel will seize this opportunity. With Chloe involved, the Ashcrofts won't let this go."

That evening, the scandal exploded across social media.

Under the trending hashtag #UnlicensedSurgeon, vicious speculation ran rampant:

"Practicing medicine without certification!"
"Using patients as lab rats!"
"Hospital protects connected insiders!"

The vice president soon gave an interview: "Our investigation confirms Vivian Laurent entered through Nathan Clementson's connections. We will take strict disciplinary action—both are dismissed immediately."

Public outrage surged.

"Good riddance!"
"Revoke that doctor's license!"
"The VP did the right thing!"

Daniel Ashcroft smiled at the trending topics. This was the price for crossing the Ashcroft family.

Isabella Langley stomped her foot in fury. "I should hack those slanderous accounts!"

"Don't act rashly," Vivian stopped her.

"But they have no idea who you really are!" Isabella protested. "If we revealed you're Dr. Luna—"

"Look!" Isabella suddenly gasped.

The hospital's official account had released the full surveillance footage.

The video clearly showed Nathan struggling during the surgery before Vivian stepped in to take over.

Alongside it, Vivian's true credentials were published:

Offered professorship at Capital Medical University (declined)
Recipient of multiple international medical awards
Pioneer of groundbreaking surgical techniques

Public opinion flipped instantly.
###Chapter 55

The autopsy report clearly showed the patient didn't die from Vivian Laurent's surgical error. The actual cause was oxygen toxicity-induced cardiac arrest after the family illegally adjusted the oxygen regulator.

Police soon released a statement. The victim's younger brother had confessed to the crime. The dual announcements from hospital and police completely cleared Vivian's name.

Unexpectedly, the CEO of Garnache Group spoke out. He admitted his daughter's critical condition had been saved by Vivian's intervention. Now fully recovered, he expressed deep gratitude.

Overwhelming evidence flooded social media, causing instant public reversal.

Netizens exploded: "This isn't an intern - she's a medical genius!"

"I knew no mere intern could lead surgery at a top hospital. That operation video was miraculous!"

"VP Ashcroft's accusations were slander! His granddaughter just got convicted for malpractice - this was pure revenge!"

Vivian's phone buzzed with Dean Remetio's call.

"Dr. Laurent, you've suffered unjustly."

"Dean, how did those statements and appointment letters appear so quickly?" Vivian sensed something amiss. "Capital Medical University's offer couldn't process this fast."

Dean Remetio chuckled. "Ethan Roscente arranged everything. From contacting Mr. Garnache to coordinating with police - all his doing."

"Ethan Roscente?" Vivian's fingers trembled.

She never expected his intervention. The statements listed every surgery and achievement - details even she'd forgotten. Though her Dr. Luna identity remained hidden, Ethan had clearly done thorough research.

A ripple of emotion stirred, then stilled. This small favor wouldn't make her agree to treat Sophia Evans.

......

Post-scandal, Vivian's patient load skyrocketed. Daniel Ashcroft avoided her entirely.

Overwhelmed, Vivian worked nonstop. With limited appointments, patients ambushed her after hours.

One evening, a crowd surrounded her car. As she hesitated, warm fingers encircled her wrist.

"Get in."

Ethan's voice brushed her ear. Before reacting, she was inside a black Maybach.

"Why are you here?"

"Follow-up." Ethan signaled the driver. "I'll drop you."

"Just let me off ahead."

Ignoring her, the car glided downtown. Only when stopping at a Michelin restaurant did Vivian realize.

"Ethan Roscente!"

"Dinner, Dr. Laurent." He opened her door with ballroom grace.

Seeing the restaurant's sign, Vivian's lips twitched.

"Why here?"

"The chef's reputed excellent." Ethan's gaze sharpened. "You've been?"

Vivian swallowed hard. This was her investment - with the head chef she'd personally recruited.
###Chapter 56

Ethan Roscente flipped open the menu, his fingers hovering over several signature spicy dishes.

"I thought you couldn't handle spicy food?" Vivian Laurent glanced at the selections, her brow furrowing slightly.

Last time, he'd been rushed to the emergency room with gastric bleeding.

"Dr. Laurent enjoys it." Ethan closed the menu. "I recall you dislike cilantro and carrots."

Vivian scoffed. "Get to the point, Mr. Roscente. If this is about asking me to save someone, forget it."

"Just hoping to become friends." His expression remained neutral.

She nearly laughed aloud. Ethan Roscente could count his friends on one hand—Felix Valdemar and a childhood companion overseas.

The meal passed in tense silence. When Ethan offered to drive her home afterward, she declined without hesitation.

The hospital finally granted Vivian vacation time. The flood of patients seeking "Dr. Luna" had overwhelmed the facility, though other physicians were perfectly capable.

During her rest day, a message arrived from Amy. Julian Cortez had signed the endorsement contract, with the official announcement imminent. Victoria Roscente mistakenly credited Ethan for securing the deal and had begun heavy promotion.

Ethan found himself stretched thin lately. The real estate project had stalled, and after punching Lucas Lefèvre, that partnership dissolved completely. He considered approaching Vivian's ex-wife—the other Vivian.

But Vivian had blocked all his contact methods. His attempts to reach Lucas only yielded mockery.

"Late-night call? Ethan Roscente actually dared ask me to collaborate!" Lucas gulped down a glass of water angrily. "We still haven't settled the score from that punch!"

Vivian handed him a tissue. "He hasn't bothered me recently."

"Next time I see him, I'm returning the favor!" Lucas ground his teeth.

On her second vacation day, Emily Garnache called.

"Vivian, could you accompany me shopping? My father never lets me go out..." Emily's voice trembled with suppressed frustration.

"Of course." Vivian agreed readily. "I'll pick you up tomorrow."

Mr. Garnache trusted Vivian implicitly. They arranged to meet at the city's most luxurious mall.

"Thank you so much!" Emily clung to Vivian's arm. "I know you're the one who saved me."

Vivian patted her hand. "Living well is thanks enough."

As they entered the designer boutique section, they collided with Ethan and Victoria Roscente. Victoria held Julian Cortez's newly endorsed handbag.

The moment their eyes met, the air turned glacial.
###Chapter 57

Emily Garnache clung to Vivian Laurent's arm, her eyes sparkling.

"Viv, I actually wanted to visit a perfume shop today."

"Oh?" Vivian tilted her head.

"Do you know who my celebrity crush is?" Emily shook her phone excitedly.

Vivian shook her head.

"Julian Cortez!" Emily whispered dramatically. "He never does endorsements, but he's making an exception this time! The internet's going wild."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. The endorsement contract was still under NDA.

"I have to check out that perfume shop." Emily tugged her forward. "When it's officially announced, I'll buy a bottle for everyone at the company!"

They stopped before an opulent storefront. The Vine Perfumes sign glittered in the sunlight.

"That's Victoria Roscente's shop." Vivian narrowed her eyes.

The store was packed. Emily pulled Vivian inside. "Help me pick something out."

Vivian picked up a test strip. Notes of rose and sandalwood drifted up.

"This is our signature scent, Mademoiselle Rose." A sales associate approached. "Pure floral notes. Limited edition."

"How much?" Vivian asked casually.

"Ten thousand." The associate lifted her chin.

Vivian nearly laughed. The production cost couldn't exceed a hundred.

"Too expensive?" The associate glanced at the AN Atelier across the street. "That place is more... affordable for you."

Vivian's gaze turned icy.

"Is this how you treat customers?" She waved the test strip. "The scent is passable, but the longevity is terrible. Gone with the wind—just like your pricing."

The associate's face darkened. "Don't cause trouble if you can't afford it!"

Emily stepped forward. "Who says we can't?"

"Suit yourselves." The associate smirked. "When Julian's endorsement drops, fans will be fighting over these."

Even Emily looked stunned.

The click of heels approached. Victoria Roscente glided over gracefully. "Is there a problem?"
###Chapter 58

Victoria Roscente's gaze settled on Vivian Laurent, her brows slightly furrowed.

The woman's unnaturally perfect features triggered her instincts.

"Boss, this customer claims our perfumes are overpriced and questions their quality," the clerk whispered.

Victoria smirked. "Oh? What's wrong with our perfumes?"

Vivian had recognized this as Victoria's store immediately. Back when she was married to Ethan Roscente, his cousin had never treated her kindly.

"Your perfumes aren't worth their price tags," Vivian stated directly.

Victoria signaled a clerk to bring their bestsellers. "These are our top sellers. Enlighten me about their flaws."

Vivian sampled each one and shook her head. "All subpar."

"Nonsense!" The clerk bristled. "We use premium organic herbs grown on our own estates!"

"The ingredients are decent," Vivian tapped a bottle lightly. "But can you guarantee these contain only what's listed?"

Victoria's pupils contracted.

"Your repeat customers come for the special additives, don't they?" Vivian's voice carried just enough for nearby shoppers to hear.

Victoria forced composure. "Please leave. We don't welcome troublemakers."

"In a hurry to kick me out before someone discovers your illegal ingredients?"

"That's slander!" Victoria's voice cracked with tension.

Vivian lifted one bottle. "Cloudtree essence. A banned addictive plant. Where did you source it?"

Victoria paled. She'd used triple-layered fragrance notes to mask the Cloudtree's scent.

"And this calming mist?" Vivian shook another bottle. "Actually contains stimulants, doesn't it?"

"Security! Remove them!" Victoria barked before forcing a smile at onlookers. "This is malicious slander from competitors. Everyone gets a complimentary new fragrance today."

Emily Garnache trembled with rage as they were shoved out. "I'm reporting this fraudulent store!"

Vivian stopped her from reaching for her phone. "Patience."

She watched the panicked Victoria through the display window, lips curving slightly.

"The real show has just begun."
###Chapter 59

Emily's eyes sparkled with excitement as she gripped Vivian's arm. "Vivian, is everything you just said...true?"

Vivian gave a slight nod. "Vine Perfumes did add banned ingredients. Though the dosage is small, long-term use can be harmful."

"Then let's report them!" Emily's cheeks flushed with anger. "A shady company like that deserves to be shut down!"

"It's useless," Vivian shook her head. "Victoria has the Roscente family backing her. They've already covered their tracks."

Emily bit her lip. "So we just let it go?"

"Wait and see." A faint smile curved Vivian's lips. "They'll reap what they sow."

Emily still looked discontented. "I'll never buy their products again! Even if Julian endorses—" Her voice trailed off at Julian's name.

"Don't worry," Vivian patted her shoulder. "Julian would never take such an endorsement."

"Really?" Emily was skeptical.

"Of course." Vivian's tone was firm. As the owner of AN Atelier, she knew Julian's contract details better than anyone.

Emily sighed. "But Vine's ads are already hinting at Julian's involvement..."

"Come on, let me show you real perfume." Vivian led her toward the AN boutique across the street.

Victoria watched them leave with a cold smirk. "If they can't afford it, just say so. No need to act all high and mighty."

A sales associate chimed in, "Exactly! How can AN's cheap products compare to ours? Once Julian's endorsement is official, let's see how they keep up their act!"

The next morning, Emily's call jolted Vivian awake.

"Vivian!" Emily shrieked through the phone. "Julian actually signed with AN! I knew you wouldn't lie to me!"

Vivian held the phone slightly away from her ear. "Calm down."

"I'm buying out AN's entire perfume stock! I'll gift them to the whole company!" Emily was practically hyperventilating.

"Don’t go overboard," Vivian chuckled. "AN chose Julian for his image, not to exploit his fans."

"Wait, how do you know all this?" Emily suddenly sounded suspicious.

Vivian paused. "Just a guess."

"Ugh! I missed the limited-edition launch!" Emily wailed.

"I'll give you a set," Vivian offered.

"Seriously? You managed to get one?"

Vivian stayed silent. As the owner, her warehouse was stocked with new releases.

"Check Twitter!" Emily suddenly shrieked. "Vine is trending for all the wrong reasons! Serves them right for trying to ride Julian's coattails!"

Emily's triumphant laughter echoed through the phone. Vivian opened Twitter to see #VineFalseAdvertising already topping the trending list.
###Chapter 60

"Julian chose AN for his first endorsement deal. What excellent taste! Affordable prices with premium quality."

"Vine Perfumes is shameless, trying to ride on Julian's fame. Their customer service lied about him being their spokesperson. Now they're exposed."

"AN's fragrances are budget-friendly yet exquisite. Vine can't compare with their tacky nouveau riche style. Julian made the perfect choice."

Fans were outraged, flooding Vine's official website with complaints until it crashed.

Victoria Roscente gripped her phone, face pale with fury.

"Brother! You promised to secure Julian's endorsement for me. Now he's signed with AN. How am I supposed to save face?"

Ethan Roscente's cold voice came through the line. "When did I ever promise you that?"

"That dinner you had with Julian—"

"It was merely an introduction at Sophia's request." His tone was final. "You'll face the consequences of false advertising yourself."

Victoria trembled with anger. "You'd just watch me humiliated like this?"

"Adults take responsibility for their actions."

The call ended abruptly.

Ethan massaged his temples and pulled up AN's corporate profile.

The emerging fragrance company had shown remarkable growth with diverse product lines. Its founder remained an enigma.

Last time, Vivian Laurent had personally handled the contract...

His eyes darkened as he pressed the intercom. "Order 200,000 units of AN's latest perfume. Company-wide bonus."

Simon Eisner sounded surprised. "Do you know their CEO, sir?"

"Some questions shouldn't be asked."

Hanging up, Ethan touched the healing wound on his arm.

The stitches would come out soon.

He'd see her again.
###Chapter 61

The night deepened as Vivian Laurent's phone screen lit up.

Amy's voice came through the receiver, brimming with barely contained excitement.

"Viv! We've broken all sales records!"

"Julian Cortez's fans went wild. They cleared out our entire inventory, even the other product lines."

Her excited breathing crackled over the line.

"Vine Perfumes had a terrible day. Our store had lines around the block while theirs was deserted."

Vivian chuckled softly and shook her head.

Amy suddenly lowered her voice. "Two VIP clients placed massive orders."

"A Ms. Garnache and a Mr. Roscente."

Vivian's fingers stilled.

Ethan Roscente?

She narrowed her eyes. What was the Roscente heir playing at now?

"Ms. Garnache paid cost price. Mr. Roscente offered 50% above retail."

Amy gasped. "Isn't that... excessive?"

"Take it or leave it," Vivian said coolly.

To everyone's surprise, Ethan immediately wired the deposit.

Amy sounded stunned on the other end.

Changing topics, she mentioned the International Perfumery Awards invitation.

"The organizers want you as a judge."

Vivian hadn't participated since winning seven consecutive championships years ago.

"Not interested," she declined flatly.

Those predictable fragrance formulas couldn't hold her attention.

...

Tension hung thick at Vine Perfumes headquarters.

Victoria Roscente's office lay in shambles, littered with broken glass.

Her assistant timidly offered a tablet. "The negative reviews are multiplying—"

"Shut up!" Victoria slapped the device away.

Her flawless makeup had smudged, eyes bloodshot.

The assistant ventured carefully, "But you made the competition finals..."

"If you win gold—"

Victoria's head snapped up, her expression venomous.

"Yes! I'll prove myself through talent!"

She grabbed a perfume bottle and hurled it against the wall.

As glass rained down, Victoria bared her teeth in a savage grin.

"Just you wait, Vivian Laurent."
###Chapter 62

The holiday ended, and Vivian Laurent returned to the hospital.

The outpatient hall was still overcrowded. Nathan Clementson had posted a notice at the registration desk: "Dr. Laurent only treats complex medical cases. Please see other specialists for common conditions."

The Chloe Ashcroft incident had been settled. Though she avoided prison, her medical license was permanently revoked.

"The Ashcrofts really went all out this time. Rumor has it they paid the victim's family eight figures."

"Those three kids will have their education and weddings covered now."

Colleagues continued whispering in the break room.

Vivian walked past with her coffee, expression neutral as she returned to her station.

"Dr. Laurent, do you think the family made the right choice?" someone couldn't resist asking.

She adjusted her stethoscope. "The living must move forward."

Without another word, she headed to the operating room. Three high-risk surgeries were scheduled today—all arranged by Nathan.

By the time the last surgery ended, city lights glittered outside.

Vivian had just changed out of her scrubs when the ER delivered a critical car crash victim. Without hesitation, she pulled her gloves back on.

The next morning, Nathan studied her pale face. "Should we reschedule today's surgeries?"

She splashed cold water on her cheeks. "The patients can't wait."

For three straight days, the OR doors swung open and shut. When Vivian finally emerged again, her fingers trembled slightly.

"Vivian!"

She turned to see Ethan Roscente at the end of the hallway.

"Yes?" Exhaustion weighed her voice.

"Stitch removal." He stepped closer. "I heard you haven't rested in days."

What was supposed to be a routine checkup became concerning when nurses mentioned Vivian hadn't stopped working for 72 hours.

"My hands are shaking. I can't do it now." She stated the truth.

"Another doctor already handled it." His gaze lingered on the dark circles under her eyes. "Let me drive you home."

She opened her mouth to refuse.

Ethan jingled his keys. "Driving fatigued is illegal. Even if you don't give me your address, I'll find it."

That convinced her. She gave a neighborhood name and trudged toward the elevator.

He caught up just before the doors closed, slipping in beside her.
###Chapter 63

The spacious backseat of the black Maybach exuded a subtle leather fragrance.

Vivian Laurent leaned against the seat with her eyes closed, allowing her exhausted mind to drift into rest.

Ethan Roscente pressed his lips together, swallowing unspoken words.

Within minutes, Vivian was fast asleep.

The car jerked to a sudden stop, tires screeching against pavement.

"Watch your driving!" Ethan's arm shot out, pulling Vivian protectively against his chest.

Her steady breathing showed no signs of disturbance.

"My apologies, Mr. Roscente." The driver glanced nervously through the rearview mirror.

Having chauffeured Ethan abroad for years, he'd never seen his employer show such concern for any woman.

Even Sophia Evans rarely gained access to this vehicle.

The car soon halted before an elegant villa.

Ethan studied Vivian's sleeping face.

Her long lashes cast shadows over cheeks still bearing faint marks from her surgical mask. Stripped of her usual sharpness, she looked unexpectedly vulnerable.

Who would believe the renowned Dr. Luna was this young woman?

Early twenties, yet wielding surgical skills rivaling seasoned specialists.

Ethan's thoughts drifted to his ex-wife.

Same age, yet worlds apart - one a medical prodigy, the other vanished without trace.

Lately, memories of that departed woman haunted him unexpectedly.

Vivian's slender fingers rested gracefully - instruments capable of both life-saving surgery and piano concertos.

"Mr. Roscente?" The driver ventured cautiously.

"Dismissed." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.

As the driver retreated, Ethan bent to scoop Vivian into his arms.

Her weightlessness startled him. An odd familiarity prickled his senses.

Two steps in, Vivian's eyes snapped open.

"Death wish?" Her fingers locked around Ethan's throat.

She cursed her uncharacteristic lapse. During Shadow Organization training, she'd never slept this deeply.

"Taking you home." Ethan remained unfazed.

Vivian released her grip. "Put me down."

"We're here. What's the code?"

Her laugh held ice. "You think you deserve to know?"
###Chapter 64

"Put me down." Vivian's voice was icy.

Ethan finally released her. Vivian strode to the door and unlocked it with facial recognition.

As she tried to slam the door shut, Ethan already forced his way inside.

"Who said you could come in?"

"After escorting Dr. Laurent home, I don't even get a glass of water?" Ethan walked straight to the living room as if he owned the place.

Vivian scoffed. "Help yourself. Drink up and get out. Every corner of this house has surveillance. Mind your manners, Mr. Roscente."

Exhausted, she had no energy to deal with him. When she moved out of the Roscente mansion, she'd left everything behind. Every item here was newly purchased.

Vivian turned and went upstairs, slamming the bedroom door behind her.

Ethan stood alone in the empty living room, surveying the sterile space. No servants. No signs of life. Just blinding white walls and cold furniture.

He pulled out his phone and made a call.

...

Vivian woke after only three hours of sleep.

Rubbing her temples, she remembered Ethan had brought her home. At this hour, he should be long gone.

Her stomach growled. Dragging her feet, she stepped out of the bedroom.

An enticing aroma wafted through the air.

From the staircase, Vivian saw Ethan was still there. Outside, darkness had fallen. She frowned. "Planning to spend the night, Mr. Roscente?"

"Dinner." Ethan stood up.

The dining table was laden with exquisite dishes. Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You can cook?"

The spread looked professionally prepared, nothing like an amateur's work. In her memory, the Roscente heir didn't even know which way a kitchen door opened.

Truth was, Ethan couldn't cook. He'd had a Michelin chef prepare and deliver this meal. But seeing Vivian's skeptical look, he felt like teasing her.

"What if I said yes?"

Vivian's expression darkened instantly.

The rumors flashed through her mind—how Ethan had learned to cook for Sophia Evans, preparing daily love lunches. Now he was using the same tactic on her?

"Take your love lunch and get out!"

Ethan looked stunned.

She'd been fine moments ago. What triggered this outburst? He suddenly missed the sleeping Vivian from the car ride.

"A chef made this," he explained quickly. "My injured hand can't even hold a spatula steady."

Vivian's cold gaze flicked to his bandaged hand.
###Chapter 65

Vivian Laurent gave Ethan Roscente an icy glare. "I'll take the food. You can leave now."

"Cold as ever?" Ethan didn't budge. "I waited three hours for you. At least let me have a warm meal before kicking me out."

Vivian rolled her eyes internally.

Her stomach betrayed her with a loud growl. After thirty seconds of silence, she pulled out a chair and sat down.

"I heard Julian Cortez signed as the face of AN Atelier." Ethan picked up a piece of sweet-and-sour ribs. "You're close with their team?"

"Interrogation?" Vivian kept her eyes on the braised pork in her bowl.

It was unexpectedly delicious. She was so hungry her chopsticks nearly slipped.

"Just making conversation."

"If it's just conversation, why should I answer?"

Ethan's chopsticks froze mid-air.

"Are we friends?"

"..."

"Right now, you're the one who needs something from me."

Ethan was speechless. Her logic cut like a scalpel—flawless and merciless.

"I just wanted to chat." He set down his chopsticks. "I'm curious about you, Dr. Laurent."

"Too bad I'm not curious about you."

Ethan studied her frosty profile. She treated patients with such warmth, yet turned to ice around him.

This same woman had performed eighteen consecutive surgeries to save extra patients—procedures she could've easily refused.

Vivian finished eating like a storm and pushed her bowl aside.

Ethan followed suit.

"Done?" She glanced up.

"Yeah."

"Go wash the dishes."

Ethan arched a brow. No one had ever dared order him to do chores.

"You ate at my place. Cleaning up is the least you can do." She pointed to the kitchen. "Make it spotless before you leave."

"Vivian," Ethan chuckled darkly, "is this how you treat guests?"

"You're free to leave if you hate washing dishes."

Her genuine distaste for dishwashing struck him. Suddenly he remembered his ex-wife—that version of Vivian never resisted cleaning up.

She used to hum while tidying after meals.

"Why don't you hire a housekeeper?"

"None of your business."

Vivian loathed having outsiders in her home. Living alone meant freedom—wandering in pajamas whenever she pleased.

"I'll arrange a live-in housekeeper and chauffeur." Ethan softened his tone. "You won't need to drive yourself anymore."

How considerate. Too bad Vivian wasn't buying it.

"Mr. Roscente, does your girlfriend know how attentive you are to other women?" Her smile was razor-sharp.

"I've been single since my divorce." He held her gaze. "I consider you a friend. These small gestures mean nothing."

"First, we're not friends." She raised a finger. "Second, no thanks."

Ethan eventually carried the dishes to the kitchen. How hard could washing up be?

He turned on the faucet and rinsed a plate haphazardly.

See? Easy.
###Chapter 66

Ethan Roscente hastily rinsed his hands and walked out without drying them.

"It's late. I'm leaving." He glanced at Vivian Laurent, who was absorbed in typing.

Vivian didn't even look up. "Don't let the door hit you on the way out."

Only after the door clicked shut did she set aside her laptop, staring blankly at the entryway.

The chat window on her screen continued to blink.

"AN, do an old man a favor," Samuel Garten's messages kept popping up. "We're one judge short."

Vivian rubbed her temples.

"I'm not the right person for this."

"Nonsense!" Samuel sounded frantic. "You've won the gold medal three times in a row. One of the judges just had a heart attack—we'll have a vacancy if you don't step in!"

The chat fell silent for a few seconds.

"...Fine."

Samuel immediately sent her flight details. Vivian adjusted her surgery schedule overnight and flew to France the next day.

At the airport, the silver-haired Samuel waved his cane excitedly.

"AN!" He studied her from head to toe. "Good heavens, you haven't aged a day. When I first met you, you were only this tall." He gestured to his waist.

Vivian smiled and steadied the elderly man. "You're as spirited as ever."

"Stop humoring me." Samuel lowered his voice. "This year's contestants are no pushovers. Keep an eye out for me."

"Don't worry."

Meanwhile, in an upscale sanatorium across town...

Victoria Roscente slammed a champagne flute onto the table.

"That AN woman did this on purpose!" she seethed. "And my brother actually took her side!"

Sophia Evans took a delicate sip of tea. "Calm down. Explain properly."

"She stole Roscente Group's endorsement deal!" Victoria's cheeks flushed with anger. "Ethan even said I wasn't competent enough—"

Sophia gently squeezed her hand. "Your brother's under a lot of stress lately. By the way, about what I asked you to look into..."

"I checked." Victoria scoffed. "Ethan hasn't seen Vivian since returning to the country. Honestly, you're the only one on his mind."

Sophia smiled in relief, her fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of her teacup.

Outside, dusk deepened.
###Chapter 67

The International Perfumery Awards commenced as scheduled.

The world's top perfumers gathered under one roof, the air thick with an intoxicating blend of fragrances.

Sophia Evans entered gracefully on Victoria Roscente's arm. Her white sundress accentuated her slender waist, the oversized sunglasses only adding to her allure. All eyes turned toward them.

"Oh my God! It's Sophia Evans!"

"She's even more stunning in person. Though quite thin."

"I heard Mr. Roscente invested in medical research just for her condition."

Amid the whispers, Sophia removed her sunglasses with practiced elegance, revealing her signature gentle smile.

Victoria wore a confident smirk. Hidden in her bag was the stolen Cloudtree essence, and she'd already bribed three judges. Victory was assured.

Suddenly, Victoria's expression froze.

"What's wrong?" Sophia followed her gaze.

A statuesque woman stood at the center of the room. Her tailored black suit hugged every curve, the icy perfection of her features radiating an unapproachable aura.

An inexplicable irritation prickled Sophia's chest.

"That troublemaker from the boutique." Victoria's eyes narrowed. "I'll handle this."

Clicking her heels, Victoria blocked Vivian Laurent's path. "How did an amateur like you slip into this elite event?"

Vivian didn't even glance up.

"Playing hard to get?" Victoria raised her voice. "Here to steal my techniques before I win?"

Vivian finally met her gaze, eyes sharp as daggers. "Your perfumes don't interest me."

"Sour grapes. You didn't even qualify to compete, did you?"

"You'll see soon enough." Vivian turned away, posture straight as a pine.

Victoria clenched her fists. Just wait until the awards ceremony—we'll see who's laughing then.

The competition began. Each perfumer worked in isolated booths, their creations to be judged blindly.

As a guest judge, Vivian sampled the entries. When she inhaled the seventh fragrance, her eyes turned razor-sharp.

She took the sample bottle and strode toward the judges' chamber.

During the break, Victoria scanned the room but found no trace of Vivian.

"Ran away already?" She smoothed her dress, awaiting her moment of triumph.

Samuel Garten took the podium.

"After rigorous evaluation, the gold medal goes to—" He paused. "Victoria Roscente for 'Whispers of Spring.'"

Victoria's victorious smile bloomed.
###Chapter 68

Victoria Roscente shot up from her seat, hands trembling as she accepted the gleaming gold trophy.

Sophia Evans clapped gracefully, her eyes sparkling with genuine delight. "Victoria, I knew you'd win."

Samuel Garten abruptly changed the subject. "Miss Roscente, please provide the ingredient list for your perfume. We suspect your entry contains prohibited substances."

Victoria's smile froze.

"Impossible!" she shrieked. "All materials were provided by the committee. If there's an issue, investigate yourselves!"

A cool female voice cut through the tension. "Then explain this."

Victoria whirled around, her pupils contracting in shock.

Vivian Laurent stood behind her, holding a slender dropper between her fingers.

The dropper containing Cloudtree extract—the one Victoria had personally destroyed.

"Who do you think you are?" Victoria hissed through clenched teeth. "Haven't you caused enough trouble?"

Samuel intervened. "This is Judge AN, the one who discovered the discrepancy."

"Judge? AN?" Victoria's voice shook. "This is absurd!"

She stared at Vivian's youthful face. The legendary perfumer AN had been famous for years—how could she be this young?

Vivian met her gaze evenly. "Problem?"

"You're an impostor!" Victoria screamed hysterically. "AN retired years ago!"

"Believe what you want." Vivian shook the dropper. "What matters is your violation."

Samuel added sternly, "If confirmed, the gold medal will be revoked."

Victoria turned deathly pale.

Sophia interjected smoothly, "May I ask what this is?"

"Cloudtree extract," Samuel explained. "A banned substance in Country C."

Sophia laughed lightly. "First, this may not belong to Victoria. Second," she swept a graceful glance around, "we're not in Country C."

Victoria's eyes lit up, her posture straightening.

Sophia turned to Vivian, extending a delicate hand. "Sophia Evans. A pleasure."

Her smile was flawless.
###Chapter 69

Vivian Laurent crossed her arms, making no move to shake hands.

Victoria Roscente shrieked, "AN, how dare you treat Sophia like this? She's an A-list actress! You should feel honored!"

A mocking smile curled Vivian's lips. "Sorry, I don't follow celebrity gossip. Seems Miss Evans isn't as famous as she thinks."

Sophia Evans paled, her nails digging into her palms. "It's fine if you don't recognize me. I don't know you either."

"Obviously. I'm not in your industry." Vivian scoffed. "What's surprising is how forgettable you remain after all these years in showbiz."

Sophia's chest heaved with anger. This bitch knew exactly where to twist the knife.

"I—"

Vivian cut her off. "Enough small talk. Victoria, you admit to using unauthorized materials in your competition entry?"

Victoria jutted her chin. "So what? It's not illegal abroad."

"The issue isn't legality." Vivian's voice turned icy. "You violated contest rules, giving yourself an unfair advantage."

She turned to Samuel Garten. "Additionally, this contestant attempted to bribe the judges. I have email proof."

"What?" Samuel's eyes widened in shock.

Vivian handed him her phone. The screen displayed Victoria's bribery attempt.

"Fake!" Victoria screamed. "This is a setup!"

She thanked her stars the email had been sent through an intermediary with no direct ties to her.

"We'll see about that." Vivian said coolly.

Just as Samuel moved to revoke Victoria's award, Sophia dramatically collapsed.

"Sophia!" Victoria wailed. "You made her faint!"

Vivian knelt, pressing two fingers to Sophia's wrist. The pulse was strong and steady.

She stood, looking down at the faking actress. "Come find me when you're actually dying."

With that, she strode away without a backward glance.

Victoria glared at her retreating figure, hatred burning in her eyes.

Inside the ambulance, Sophia "regained consciousness."

"You scared me to death!" Victoria clutched her chest.

Sophia smirked. "If I hadn't fainted, your gold medal would've been revoked on the spot."

Victoria's eyes welled up with grateful tears. "Sophia, you're the best!"

A calculating gleam entered Sophia's eyes. "Call Ethan now. Tell him I collapsed because of her."
###Chapter 70

Ethan Roscente's phone lit up with an incoming call from Victoria Roscente.

"Brother, Sophia fainted." Victoria's voice trembled with urgency.

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly. "What happened?"

"At the International Perfumery Awards today, some woman named AN made Sophia collapse from anger." Victoria seethed. "She bullied me and targeted Sophia too."

"AN?" The name sounded vaguely familiar to Ethan.

"She's the studio owner who stole Julian Cortez's endorsement deal." Victoria practically spat the words.

Ethan's gaze sharpened.

Julian's endorsement had been arranged by Night. Could there be a connection between Night and AN?

"What does AN look like? How old is she?" Ethan asked abruptly.

Victoria sounded offended. "Ethan, Sophia just collapsed! Why do you care about some AN woman?"

"How is she now?" Ethan's tone remained neutral.

"The doctor said it's nothing serious." Victoria answered sullenly.

"Good. Call the doctor if needed." Ethan ended the call without ceremony.

Victoria stared at her phone in shock.

On the hospital bed, Sophia Evans's eyes darkened with resentment. Ethan had been growing increasingly distant lately.

"He must be busy." Sophia forced a weak smile. "Victoria, could you keep an eye out for me? I suspect someone's getting close to your brother."

"That can't be!" Victoria's eyes widened. "Ethan's always been ice-cold toward women."

Sophia squeezed her hand. "Just do this for me, okay?"

"Don't worry, Sophia." Victoria patted her chest. "I'll watch him closely."

......

Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, pondering the possible link between AN and Night.

He immediately ordered footage from the perfume competition, only to discover the crucial segments had been edited out.

"Get me AN's profile." Ethan called Simon Eisner.

Thirty minutes later, the dossier arrived.

AN - internationally renowned perfumer and fashion designer who rose to fame a decade ago. Her AN Atelier brand dominated the fashion world, with limited-edition designs that commanded astronomical prices.

Ethan's frown eased. Someone famous ten years ago couldn't possibly be the young Night.

Night was barely in her twenties now. She couldn't have been a master perfumer at age ten.

Seeing Night collaborate with Julian had made him suspect AN might be Night's alternate identity. Clearly, they were simply associates.

"Mr. Roscente, the invitation for next week's charity gala." Simon presented an embossed card.

Ethan accepted it. A prominent collector's birthday celebration in the capital, rumored to feature a priceless artifact that had high society clamoring for invitations.

"Clear my schedule." Ethan tucked the card away, his gaze turning contemplative.

Somehow, he sensed this event might unravel certain mysteries.
###Chapter 71

Vivian Laurent returned triumphantly from the International Perfumery Awards.

Her phone rang the moment she stepped off the plane.

"Let's grab drinks!" Isabella Langley's energetic voice chirped through the receiver.

"Just got back. Exhausted." Vivian massaged her temples.

"I don't care!" Isabella whined. "None of those foreign hunks were half as fun as you."

Vivian chuckled. "Fine. The usual place?"

Nightfall Lounge's parking lot overflowed with luxury vehicles.

Isabella circled the lot three times in her red sports car before spotting an empty space.

As she began reversing, a black Maybach cut in and stole the spot.

"Asshole!" Isabella slammed her steering wheel.

The window rolled down, revealing Felix Valdemar's smug face. "Don't blame others for your terrible parking skills."

"Felix?" Isabella gritted her teeth. "You'll regret this!"

Inside the lounge, Vivian already had drinks waiting.

"That bastard!" Isabella stormed in, downing her cocktail in one gulp.

"Who angered our precious Isabella?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"Who else?" She rolled her eyes. "That arrogant prick Felix!"

Vivian slid her a fresh drink. "Tell me about your European escapades?"

Isabella's eyes lit up as she launched into travel stories.

"What about you?" She leaned in suddenly. "Any progress with Ethan Roscente?"

Vivian swirled her glass. "He only knows me as Night."

"That's it?" Isabella pouted. "Is the man blind?"

"In his memory, Vivian Laurent is an ugly, foolish woman." Vivian smiled wryly. "Why would he connect the dots?"

Isabella lowered her voice. "Maybe you should—"

Felix appeared at the lounge entrance, cutting her off.

Isabella immediately straightened, her gaze turning sharp.

Felix strode to their section, taking the adjacent booth.

"Ugh!" Isabella muttered under her breath.

Vivian observed their tension while sipping her drink.

"Oh," Isabella remembered suddenly. "Do you need more funding for that real estate project?"

Vivian shook her head. "Still working on financing."

Their conversation was interrupted by Felix's loud laughter.

Isabella snapped. She grabbed her glass and marched over.

"Sir," she said with a fake smile. "Mind keeping your volume down in public?"

Felix looked up with a taunting grin. "Since when did you become the manners police?"

As they began arguing, Vivian quickly pulled Isabella away.

"Don't bother," Vivian murmured. "Let's go somewhere else."

Isabella continued fuming as they exited.

Vivian glanced back at the lounge's neon sign, lost in thought.

Neither noticed Ethan Roscente watching their departure from a second-floor window, his expression icy.
###Chapter 72

Isabella Langley's cheeks were flushed with alcohol as she tugged at Vivian Laurent's arm.

"Dance with me!"

Vivian shook her head, pulling her jacket tighter around herself.

"Why are you dressed like that?" Isabella yanked the jacket off. "You should let Ethan Roscente see how stunning you look tonight!"

The strobe lights flickered over the dance floor, illuminating Vivian's sleek black halter top and leather pants that hugged her long legs. Heads turned as she moved.

Up in the VIP lounge, Felix Valdemar perked up at the sudden burst of cheers.

His gaze landed on two figures at the center of the dance floor.

Squinting, he recognized one of them immediately.

"Is that Isabella Langley?"

And the bombshell beside her—wasn't that the woman Ethan had been searching for?

Felix pulled out his phone and recorded a video, sending it to Ethan with a text:

"Boss, isn't this the one from last time?"

Ethan had just wrapped up a meeting when his phone buzzed.

The video showed Vivian swaying her hips to the rhythm.

His expression darkened.

"Head to Nightfall Lounge."

Meanwhile, a group of thugs lurked in the shadows, watching Vivian intently.

"Boss Duke, that's her! The one who took down our guys last time."

Duke Massies spat out his cigarette, eyes glinting with hunger.

"Pathetic. Watch how it's done."

As Vivian finished dancing, a sheen of sweat glistened on her forehead.

She barely took two steps before a greasy man blocked her path.

"Hey gorgeous, how about a dance?"

"Not interested."

Duke flashed a gold-toothed grin.

"You know who I am? I own this district."

Vivian smirked.

"Move."

Duke reached out to grab her.

"You're asking for it!"

Just as Vivian tensed to strike—

A dark blur shot past.

Duke barely registered the movement before searing pain exploded in his wrist.

The next instant, he was airborne.

THUD.

The floor shook.

Duke lay sprawled on the ground, his front teeth missing.
###Chapter 73

"Are you alright?" A deep male voice murmured near her ear.

Vivian Laurent lifted her gaze.

"Ethan Roscente, why is it always you?"

The corner of Ethan's lips curved upward. "Perhaps it's fate."

"More like a curse."

"Ethan, how did you get here so fast?" Felix Valdemar stared at the sudden appearance of his friend in astonishment.

Vivian instantly understood - Felix had tipped him off.

"I happened to be nearby," Ethan replied casually.

"You actually intervened? For her? Since when are you two so close?" Felix couldn't believe his eyes.

"Isn't it proper to protect a lady?"

"But she doesn't need protection! Last time we saw her take down five grown men single-handedly - she even slapped you!"

Felix rubbed his eyes. He vividly remembered when a woman once pretended to faint in front of Ethan. His friend hadn't even offered a hand, just stepped aside coldly.

Ethan ignored Felix completely.

Turning to Vivian, he asked, "Dr. Laurent, care for a drink?"

"No thanks. I'm leaving."

"Perfect timing. I'll drive you."

"I have my own car." Vivian turned to walk away.

"You can't drive after drinking."

"I'll call a designated driver."

"What a coincidence." Ethan pointed at himself. "You've got one right here."

Felix's jaw dropped. The CEO of Roscente Group volunteering as a chauffeur?

His shock intensified when Ethan removed his jacket and draped it gently over Vivian's shoulders.

Rubbing his eyes again, Felix wondered if this was the same ice-cold tyrant he knew.

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley emerged from the dance floor and spotted Vivian walking out with Ethan.

Wasn't that Vivian's ex-husband? What was he up to?

Just as Isabella moved to intercept them, someone grabbed her wrist.

With a swift twist, she had the offender's arm locked behind his back.

"Ow! That hurts!" Felix grimaced in pain.

This woman fought dirty!

Recognizing Felix, Isabella released him. "What do you want?"

"My buddy will make sure your friend gets home safe. No need for third wheels." Felix massaged his sore wrist.

Isabella considered it. Vivian could handle herself.

"Hey, where've you been lately?" Felix asked offhandedly.

"None of your damn business." Isabella turned on her heel.

She hadn't forgotten their parking spot feud earlier. She'd have the bar put up a sign: "No Entry for Felix Valdemar or Dogs!"
###Chapter 74

Ethan Roscente gripped the steering wheel, his gaze flickering toward Vivian Laurent in the passenger seat.

The golden sunset spilled through the window, painting delicate highlights across her sculpted profile.

"We're here." Ethan's deep voice cut through the silence as the car stopped.

Vivian unfastened her seatbelt. Just as her fingers touched the door handle, Ethan's question froze her movements.

"Dr. Laurent, you're quite close with AN?"

Her fingers stiffened imperceptibly.

"Is there a problem?" Vivian turned with practiced calm.

Ethan leaned back, long fingers drumming the steering wheel. "Heard you secured Julian Cortez's endorsement for her."

"Since when does the Roscente Group CEO take interest in my social circle?" Vivian's lips curved without warmth.

"Just making conversation." Ethan shrugged. "AN is an international supermodel, after all."

Vivian pushed the car door open. "Thanks for the ride."

She strode toward the villa entrance but froze when her key met unlocked resistance.

The door swung inward from within.

"Viv—"

Her hand clamped over Lucas Lefèvre's mouth as she shoved him inside. The door slammed shut behind them.

Ethan's eyes narrowed.

He'd clearly seen a man's silhouette.

His fingers tightened around the keys. Within seconds, Ethan was striding up the walkway.

Inside, Vivian glared at Lucas. "What are you doing here?"

"I—"

The doorbell chimed.

Vivian paled. "Hide. Now."

"Why—"

"No questions!" She propelled him toward the bathroom. "Move!"

Bewildered but compliant, Lucas ducked inside.

Vivian inhaled sharply before cracking the door open. "Something else, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan's gaze swept past her, scanning the interior. "Mind if I use your restroom?"

He shouldered past before she could respond.

Vivian's pulse hammered.

Behind the bathroom door, Lucas held his breath.

Ethan's footsteps grew louder...
###Chapter 75

Ethan Roscente's footsteps echoed through the hallway.

Vivian Laurent stepped in front of the door. "Mr. Roscente, please stop."

His eyebrow arched. "What's wrong, Dr. Laurent? Hiding someone in there?"

Her pulse quickened. She wasn't sure if Ethan had seen Lucas.

"That's right," she lifted her chin. "My little wolfdog. Quite clingy."

Ethan stiffened. "You have a boyfriend?"

"Mr. Roscente," her voice turned icy. "We're not that close."

His Adam's apple bobbed. He'd crossed a line.

"My apologies." Ethan turned to leave.

The hallway lights stretched his shadow long behind him. He pulled out his phone. "Felix, send me your location."

"Weren't you taking someone home?"

"Change of plans." Ethan lit a cigarette.

The smoke curled around him as he tried to suppress the inexplicable irritation.

"Had to move," Felix sounded dejected. "Isabella kicked me out."

"..."

Ethan crushed the cigarette and hit the gas.

Vivian exhaled when she confirmed Ethan's departure.

Lucas peeked out from the inner room. "Why was Ethan Roscente—"

"Don't mention him." She poured a glass of water. "What do you need?"

"A charity gala invitation." Lucas presented the gold-embossed card. "Rare treasures on display. There's a Jade Gambling segment too."

"I'll go with you." Vivian nodded.

"Perfect!" His eyes lit up. "By the way, Roscente Group is still negotiating—"

"No." Her refusal was absolute.

The hospital stayed unusually quiet these days. Without the Ashcrofts causing trouble, Vivian could focus on her patients.

Soon, the gala night arrived.

Vivian wore a black gown of her own design. The satin hugged her curves, the open back revealing delicate shoulder blades.

Lucas gaped.

"Sis..." He stammered. "You'll cause a riot looking like that."

Her red lips curved as earrings swayed with each step. Tonight, she would be the center of attention.
###Chapter 76

"What's wrong? Don't recognize me?"

"It's not that I don't recognize you. You're just too stunning to believe."

Vivian Laurent took the lead and stepped forward.

Once inside the car, she suddenly asked, "Ethan Roscente won't be there, right?"

"Haven't checked. Are you afraid of running into him?"

She was. The last thing Vivian wanted was for Ethan to discover her true identity.

Fate loved playing cruel jokes. At the banquet entrance, a luxury car pulled up right in front of theirs.

The door opened, revealing a man's long legs stepping out first.

The impeccably dressed figure emerging from the vehicle could be none other than Ethan Roscente.

"Today's just not my lucky day!"

Fortunately, their car was behind his, giving her a chance to fix the situation.

Lucas Lefèvre noticed too. "Vivian, Ethan's here. Should we still go in?"

"Of course we're going."

Vivian wasn't afraid of Ethan—only of her identity being exposed. She decided to redo her makeup.

Lucas saw right through her. "You're going with that ugly disguise again?"

"Embarrassed to be seen with me?"

"No. You look breathtaking today. You should stun everyone."

Vivian's makeup skills were unparalleled. She could transform her stunning features into something utterly plain.

"I'm not here to compete in a beauty pageant." She adjusted the car's lighting and quickly reapplied her makeup.

In moments, her gorgeous face became unremarkable.

"Let's go." She linked arms with Lucas as they entered the venue.

The birthday celebration showcased the host's wealth. The most luxurious garden hotel in the capital had been booked, its opulent decorations dazzling.

Their entrance immediately drew attention.

That aura! Those figures!

Pity about the plain face. The black evening gown accentuated her perfect curves, but the face above it was forgettable.

Vivian had come to help Lucas with jade gambling. A corner of the venue displayed piles of raw stones.

Jade gambling relied entirely on skill and luck. One cut could bring poverty, another could bring riches.

Knowing his limitations, Lucas had specifically asked Vivian for help.

"Vivian, I'm counting on you."

"Don't worry."

Many guests were already selecting stones. After exchanging greetings, Vivian joined them.

Not far away, Ethan stood surrounded by admirers.

He looked bored, politely dismissing one after another.

When he finally escaped, a particular silhouette caught his eye.

A woman with her hair elegantly pinned up. The black starry gown traced the graceful lines of her back. Her flawless skin glowed like pearls under the lights.

That single glimpse of her back was enough to make him pause.
###Chapter 77

Vivian Laurent's slender fingers traced the rough surface of the raw jade on display. A slight frown creased her brow at the texture.

"Vivian." Lucas Lefèvre approached in a tailored suit. "Found anything interesting?"

She shook her head. "The quality varies too much, and the prices are inflated. We need to be careful."

Bending closer, she examined a grayish-brown stone, fingertips exploring its coarse edges.

Ethan Roscente stood on the second-floor balcony when a familiar silhouette caught his eye.

His pupils contracted sharply when the woman turned.

Vivian?

What was she doing at this exclusive auction?

His gaze narrowed as Lucas casually draped an arm around Vivian's shoulders.

So that's how it was.

A cold smirk twisted his lips as his fingers tapped the railing.

"Brother!" Victoria Roscente approached in stilettos, followed by an elegant young woman.

Ethan frowned. "Why are you here?"

"Meet Bianca Semona," Victoria announced proudly. "One of the country's top jade appraisers."

Bianca extended her hand with a gracious smile. "An honor to meet you, Mr. Roscente."

Ethan barely acknowledged her, his attention fixed below.

Victoria followed his gaze and stiffened. "Is that Vivian?"

Her lips curled in distaste. "Still looks like she shops at thrift stores after all these years."

Vivian remained focused on the jade, strands of hair framing her face.

"How dare she bring that man here?" Victoria's voice rose sharply. "Aren't you going to do something?"

"Enough." Ethan's tone could freeze molten steel. "Watch your mouth."

Victoria gaped. "I'm defending your honor!"

"Unnecessary." He turned away. "Leave her alone."

Stamping her foot in frustration, Victoria glared while Bianca studied the woman examining stones below.

Vivian suddenly looked up, her gaze locking onto the intense stare from the balcony.

Their eyes met for one charged moment before she calmly looked away, as if he were a stranger.
###Chapter 78

Victoria Roscente clenched her wine glass.

Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Vivian Laurent laughing nearby.

That woman was wearing AN Atelier's latest haute couture gown.

AN! The brand that had humiliated her in the perfumery world!

Victoria's chest heaved violently.

"Vivian!"

She stormed forward in her heels and flung the wine the moment Vivian turned.

Vivian sidestepped gracefully.

The crimson liquid arced through the air before splattering onto the expensive carpet.

"Is this all you've got, Victoria?"

Vivian smirked and grabbed a champagne flute from a passing waiter.

Splash!

The icy liquid drenched Victoria's head.

"Agh!"

Her scream drew every eye in the ballroom.

Bianca Semona rushed over. "Victoria!"

Champagne dripped from Victoria's ruined hair. Her designer gown was destroyed.

"You bitch!" She lunged wildly. "Fatherless trash!"

Crack!

The slap echoed through the silent hall.

Victoria clutched her cheek in shock.

"That's your first lesson in manners."

Vivian wiped her hands calmly.

"Second course."

She grabbed another wine glass and poured it down Victoria's dress.

"To wash out that filthy mouth."

Whispers erupted around them.

Victoria turned deathly pale.

The reality of her humiliation hit her.

"You think the Roscente name makes you special?"

Vivian whispered in her ear.

"You—"

"Victoria."

Ethan Roscente's cold voice cut through the crowd.

Guests parted like the Red Sea.

"Brother! She—"

"Enough."

Ethan's glare could freeze hell.

"Clean yourself up. Now."

Bianca pulled at Victoria's arm. "Let's go to the ladies' room..."

Victoria bit her lip until it bled.

Watching Vivian's composed demeanor, she tasted humiliation like never before.

That bitch would pay.
###Chapter 79

The bathroom lights glared harshly.

Victoria Roscente stared at her reflection, trembling with rage. Her cheeks were still flushed from the altercation.

"Who does she think she is?" She slammed her fist against the marble countertop, knuckles turning white.

Bianca Semona quickly handed her a damp towel. "Victoria, don't let her get to you."

"Did you see that? Even trash like her dares to humiliate me!" Victoria ground her teeth.

Bianca lowered her voice. "Who is that woman? Mr. Roscente seemed very protective of her."

"My brother's wife." Victoria sneered. "A gold-digging bitch who forced her way into our family."

"Mr. Roscente is married?" Bianca's eyes widened.

"To a 300-pound pig who used dirty tricks to trap him. He's never acknowledged her."

Bianca relaxed slightly, disdain flashing in her eyes. "She's certainly not worthy of Mr. Roscente."

Acid jealousy churned in her stomach.

How could such a woman marry Ethan Roscente?

"I won't let this slide!" Victoria scrubbed at her face viciously.

Bianca's eyes gleamed. "Leave it to me. There's a changing room upstairs. I'll teach her a lesson."

"What's your plan?"

"They're selecting jade stones." Bianca whispered. "The man with her knows nothing about jade. I'll make him pay top dollar for worthless pieces."

Victoria finally smiled. "You're a true friend."

Back in the ballroom, Ethan approached Vivian Laurent.

"Are you alright?" His gaze swept over her.

Vivian shook her head calmly. "She can't touch me."

She'd tolerated Victoria for Ethan's sake before. No more.

"She's young and foolish." Ethan's tone was flat.

"Control your sister." Vivian met his eyes directly. "Next time, it won't just be spilled wine."

Bianca emerged from the bathroom just in time to witness the exchange.

Ethan's commanding presence stood out even among the elite crowd. His chiseled profile looked sculpted under the lights.

How could such a perfect man be married to that woman?

Bianca's nails dug into her palms through the silk of her gown.

Vivian suddenly turned, locking eyes with someone staring daggers at her.

Victoria's friend?

Her brow furrowed slightly.

Another woman after Ethan?

Not wanting to cause a scene, Vivian walked away.

Bianca seized the opportunity to approach Ethan.

"Mr. Roscente." She blushed. "I'm Bianca Semona."

Ethan didn't spare her a glance as he strode past.
###Chapter 80

Bianca Semona had always been the center of attention. Beautiful and poised, she was accustomed to being adored wherever she went. This was the first time someone had completely ignored her.

She bit her lower lip hard, her gaze darting between Vivian Laurent and the man speaking with her. A plan quickly formed in her mind.

"Hello everyone, I'm Bianca Semona." She stepped into the center of the crowd, her voice clear and bright. "I wonder if any of you are familiar with Jade Gambling? Perhaps you've heard my name."

"Bianca Semona?" someone exclaimed immediately. "The daughter of Master Semona? They say she could pick out premium jade from scrap piles at age three! A true prodigy in the gemstone appraisal world!"

"You flatter me." Bianca lowered her head slightly, though her lips curled with pride. "I merely learned a few basics from observing my father since childhood."

"Miss Semona, could you help us evaluate this stone? We're hesitant to make a move."

"Miss Semona!" More people gathered around her.

The adoration of the crowd satisfied Bianca immensely. She deliberately glanced toward Ethan Roscente's direction, only to find he didn't even spare her a look. The man beside Vivian showed the same indifference.

Bianca picked up a high-intensity flashlight, its beam gliding across the stone's surface. She alternated between examining patterns with a magnifying glass and measuring data with a refractometer, her movements practiced and professional.

"Truly Master Semona's daughter. Such expertise is unmistakable," the onlookers praised.

Within half an hour, she selected two stones to cut open immediately. The translucent jade shimmered brilliantly under the light, drawing gasps of amazement.

"Miss Semona is incredible!"

"You honor me too much." Bianca smiled demurely.

Requests for her assistance multiplied rapidly, with someone even offering, "Miss Semona, I'll pay five hundred thousand. Could you evaluate mine first?"

"Apologies." Bianca's expression turned displeased. "The Semona family has a tradition—appraisal isn't for profit. To measure my skills in monetary terms is insulting. Besides..." She smirked disdainfully. "A mere five hundred thousand is beneath our family's notice."

"Pfft—" Vivian suddenly burst out laughing.

"What are you laughing at?" Bianca's eyes turned icy.

Vivian tilted her head, her smile radiant. "At you. If you think the money's too little, just say so. No need to put on this virtuous act. Your passive-aggressive remarks are practically oozing out."

"You!" Bianca's face flushed with anger. "There's always been a fee structure in Jade Gambling. Premium jade's market value far exceeds that amount. Don't embarrass yourself if you don't understand!"

"Who says I don't understand?" Vivian raised an eyebrow.

Bianca sneered. "Stop pretending. Prove it—cut open a stone for everyone to see!"

Vivian scanned the crowd. "Anyone want me to evaluate their stone? Free of charge. I guarantee better results than Miss Semona here."

The crowd erupted in mocking laughter.

"Little girl, Jade Gambling isn't child's play. Don't make a fool of yourself."

"Exactly! Miss Semona is a recognized genius in the field. You're not fit to hold a candle to her!"

Skeptical comments rose one after another. Not a single person believed Vivian.
###Chapter 81

Bianca Semona curled her lips in a mocking smile. "Vivian Laurent, Jade Gambling isn't child's play. These raw stones cost real money. Don't make everyone lose their investments."

The crowd stepped back nervously. No one dared to let Vivian choose. As Ethan Roscente moved forward, Lucas Lefèvre cut in first. "Pick any stone you want, Vivian. It's on me."

He'd been eager to see her skills in action.

"Thought you claimed to know stones? Prove it by picking one now," Bianca taunted.

Vivian didn't even glance at her. She walked straight to the raw jade section. When someone offered her a professional flashlight, she waved it away.

Her fingers closed around a dull gray stone. She handed it to Lucas. "Cut this one."

The saw's whirring filled the air until Lucas gasped. "Ice-blue jade!"

Murmurs erupted through the crowd.

This stone's quality surpassed both of Bianca's previous finds combined.

"No way! She grabbed it at random?"
"Now that's a true expert—no tools needed!"

Bianca's face paled, her nails digging into her palms. This had to be luck. How could Vivian possibly understand Jade Gambling?

"Satisfied?" Vivian asked coolly.

"You just got lucky!" Bianca's voice trembled. "Prove yourself by cutting a few more!"

"Fine." Vivian scanned the room. "Free selections for anyone. Who's next?"

The attendees exchanged uncertain glances, still attributing her success to chance.

Ethan suddenly spoke. "I'll go."

"You?" Vivian narrowed her eyes. "I refuse."

"You said anyone could participate," Ethan pressed closer. "Money isn't an issue. Choose freely."

With a cold laugh, Vivian approached the stone pile. This time, she didn't pick randomly. She placed her palm lightly against each stone's surface, sensing them one by one.

Beads of sweat formed on Bianca's palms. Could the legends about touch-based identification be true?

"This one." Vivian pointed to an unremarkable stone.

The saw started again. The room held its breath. Bianca stared fixedly at the blade, her nails nearly drawing blood.

The blade descended, revealing a murky interior—pale pink streaked with ugly purple blotches.

A worthless rock.
###Chapter 82

The crowd's anticipation turned to disappointment as murmurs spread through the gathering.

"This stone is worthless."

"Quality jade should be pure and translucent. This one's full of impurities. No need to keep cutting."

Amateur connoisseurs shook their heads, dismissing it as scrap material.

Bianca Semona finally relaxed, her lips curling in disdain.

She mocked herself for feeling nervous earlier. Having grown up in this world, how could she lose to an amateur?

Vivian Laurent's eyes flickered with concealed frustration.

She had expected premium jade, not this once-in-a-millennium variegated stone.

Further cutting would reveal its true splendor.

"Mr. Roscente, my mistake," Vivian feigned regret. "Shall I repurchase this stone at cost?"

Buying at thirty million to sell for three hundred million—she wouldn't let this profit slip away.

Ethan Roscente cared little for the stone's value, but Vivian's unusual interest raised his suspicion.

Examining the cross-section, he noticed hidden patterns beneath the surface irregularities.

"A gift from you deserves preservation." Ethan instructed his men to secure the stone.

Whispers circulated: "Mr. Roscente spoils his wife excessively, treasuring even worthless rocks."

"More like money can't buy taste."

Ethan leaned close to Vivian's ear. "This stone isn't ordinary, is it?"

Vivian's pupils contracted. She hadn't expected him to discern its true nature.

Only they recognized its worth—not even self-proclaimed prodigy Bianca understood.

Bianca seized the moment. "Mr. Roscente, I'd be happy to help you select better materials."

"Unnecessary." His refusal was ice-cold.

"My consultation would be complimentary," Bianca persisted.

"She knows nothing about jade. I can help you recoup your investment."

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "Do I strike you as someone who cares about money? As Victoria's friend, you should know your place."

Bianca's nails dug into her palms, jealousy burning in her eyes.
###Chapter 83

Bianca Semona had been thoroughly snubbed by Ethan Roscente.

She turned to Vivian Laurent with a perfectly practiced smile plastered on her face.

"Miss Laurent, you don't seem very experienced with jade gambling. Would you like me to pick a stone for you?"

Lucas Lefèvre immediately shook his head. "That won't be necessary."

With an expert like Vivian by his side, he didn't need anyone else's advice.

But Vivian gently pressed his arm.

She'd noticed Bianca hovering around Victoria Roscente earlier. This sudden offer of help was definitely calculated.

"How kind of you, Miss Semona." Vivian's lips curved slightly.

Bianca's eyes flashed with triumph. The fish had taken the bait.

She made a show of examining several displays before stopping at an enormous raw stone.

"This one will definitely yield premium jade."

Lucas's eyes lit up. Priced at three hundred million, if it contained high-quality material, the value could increase tenfold.

He looked expectantly at Vivian.

"Are you certain, Miss Semona?" Vivian's smile held hidden meaning.

She'd already assessed this stone earlier—its contents were worth at most one hundred fifty million. A guaranteed loss for the buyer.

Bianca's stomach tightened. Had she been found out?

"I...I'm just making a suggestion. The surface looks promising, but with jade gambling, no one can guarantee anything."

She deliberately told only half the truth. While one side of the stone showed potential, the other was worthless scrap.

"Miss Semona," Vivian's voice turned icy, "are you trying to make fools of us, or are you simply incompetent?"

Bianca's face paled.

How was this possible? She hadn't seen Vivian inspect this stone thoroughly.

"What would you know?" Bianca forced composure. "You're a nobody in jade gambling circles. That pathetic stone you picked for Mr. Roscente earlier—everyone saw it."

The crowd immediately chimed in:

"She's the daughter of Master Semona!"

"If you can't afford it, just say so."

"Coming to a jade gambling event without three hundred million? Pathetic."

"Step aside if you're not buying—I'll take it!"

People clamored to claim this "treasure."

Vivian chuckled softly...
###Chapter 84

"Let me make this clear—if this jade stone turns out worthless after cutting, I, Bianca Semona, won't take responsibility."

"Of course we understand! We trust Ms. Semona!"

Vivian Laurent's gaze sharpened like a blade as she stared at Bianca. "Do you deserve their trust, Ms. Semona?"

Bianca's fingers trembled slightly.

She knew this jade was flawed. She'd intended to trap Vivian, not involve others.

Admitting the stone's defects now would ruin her reputation.

She forced composure. "I don't know what you mean. From what I can see, this section is flawless."

Vivian cut straight to the point. "What about the other side?"

Bianca fell silent. The reverse side contained nothing of value.

An impatient voice interrupted. "Enough delays! If Ms. Semona says it's good, either buy it or step aside!"

Vivian kept her hand on the stone. "Buy it if you wish. But heed my warning—don't trust Bianca Semona. This purchase will bring devastating losses."

The man scoffed. "Who the hell are you? My losses are none of your business!"

Vivian released the stone. Some people insisted on jumping into fire—no stopping them.

Three hundred million for a lesson seemed excessive.

"Since everyone heard Ms. Semona endorse this stone, let's witness her expertise together. See if her reputation holds."

Vivian's words pushed Bianca to the cliff's edge.

Bianca paled. This stone would fail spectacularly, destroying her credibility.

She backpedaled. "Perhaps... I could select another for you?"

The buyer had already paid. "No! Cut it now! Ms. Semona, I'm here because of your father's name. Don't disappoint me."

Bianca bit her lip until it bled. Her scheme against Vivian had backfired spectacularly.

Years of built prestige would crumble today because of Vivian.

Yet Vivian remained composed, victory assured.

Ethan Roscente studied Vivian intently. This version of her was startlingly unfamiliar.

She radiated brilliance—confident and formidable. Her earlier words carried such weight they'd roasted Bianca alive.

If the stone proved worthless, Bianca's career would end.

More astonishing—Vivian seemed certain of the outcome.

This Vivian outshone even her beauty.

At the crowd's edge, a disguised man observed everything unnoticed.

No one recognized him as Zero—the Dark Web's top operative.
###Chapter 85

Zero and Shadow were once the most feared duo in the world of espionage.

Their success rate was impeccable.

Among the elite agents trained by the organization, they were the sharpest blades.

But four years ago, Shadow vanished without a trace after a mission.

Zero searched the entire world but found nothing.

The organization eventually declared Shadow dead.

Yet the woman before him had eyes just like Shadow's.

Beneath that ordinary face lay the same focused intensity.

Zero's current mission was to steal the priceless Bodhisattva Jade from a billionaire's birthday gala.

The bounty was worth hundreds of millions.

He was about to make his move when the commotion caught his attention.

Perhaps it was just his imagination.

He needed to focus on the mission.

Vivian Laurent suddenly sensed an unfamiliar gaze.

It wasn't Ethan Roscente.

She scanned the room but found nothing.

"What's wrong?" Lucas Lefèvre asked.

"Nothing." She averted her eyes.

The stone-cutting machine abruptly stopped.

The crowd erupted in gasps.

The premium jade ore had nearly been a total loss.

Only the section Bianca Semona had marked yielded sparse fragments of jade.

Three hundred million dollars—gone in an instant.

The buyer's face turned ashen.

"I warned you about this stone," Vivian said coolly. "Either Bianca deliberately misled you, or her judgment is severely lacking."

Bianca protested, "I suggested choosing a different stone! You insisted on this one!"

"Is this your so-called expertise?" The buyer's voice dripped with venom.

Whispers spread through the crowd.

"The Semona family's reputation is ruined."

"What a disgrace to her father's legacy."

Bianca panicked. "I truly saw potential in it!"

"Then why let him buy it?" Vivian smirked. "Quite the manipulative move, Miss Semona."

She turned to the buyer. "Adults must take responsibility for their choices."

Regret twisted the man's features.

He glared at Bianca. "This isn't over!"

"It wasn't my fault!" Bianca's voice trembled.

"Get lost! The Semonas are nothing but frauds!"

Bianca clenched her fists.

Her hate-filled gaze locked onto Vivian.

Now she understood why Victoria Roscente despised this woman.

From this moment forward, they were sworn enemies.
###Chapter 86

Ethan Roscente's gaze remained scrutinizing.

Vivian Laurent's earlier certainty that the jade stone contained nothing valuable had aroused his suspicion.

"Keep staring and I'll gouge your eyes out!" Vivian made a clawing gesture with two fingers.

Ethan frowned slightly.

He stepped closer instead. "You knew that stone was flawed from the start?"

Vivian's pulse quickened.

She forced a casual shrug. "What would I know about jade?"

"Then how were you so sure?"

"Use your brain." Vivian rolled her eyes. "Since when would Victoria Roscente's friend give me a good recommendation? If it was truly valuable, why didn't she tell Victoria to buy it?"

Ethan considered this.

The explanation made logical sense.

He exhaled quietly.

Perhaps he'd been overthinking things.

Yet Vivian's earlier display of confidence had been... intriguing.

Lucas Lefèvre stepped between them coldly. "Must you stand so close to my sister after divorcing her?"

He pulled Vivian away.

"Should I still make the purchase?" Lucas whispered.

"Third and eighth." Vivian replied tersely.

Lucas's eyes lit up.

He hurried off to select the stones.

...

Victoria Roscente descended the staircase in her evening gown.

The ballroom buzzed with conversation.

She strained to hear - only praise for Bianca Semona's expertise.

Victoria lifted her chin smugly.

Her gaze landed on Vivian.

A man was whispering in Vivian's ear.

Victoria sneered.

Did they think such cheap tactics would provoke her brother?

She found Bianca dabbing at tears.

"What happened?"

After hearing the story, Victoria stormed toward Vivian.

"Vivian Laurent! You shameless harlot!"

Lucas froze mid-step toward the jade vendors.

"Married to my brother yet flaunting your affairs? Have you no decency?"

"While Ethan was abroad for three years, you must've cuckolded him endlessly!"

Lucas clenched his fists. "Watch your mouth!"

"Am I wrong?" Victoria shrieked. "How dare you speak, you homewrecker?"

The ballroom fell silent.

All eyes turned to Vivian.

This unremarkable woman was Ethan Roscente's secret wife of three years?
###Chapter 87

The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the banquet hall.

Victoria Roscente clutched her stinging cheek, her eyes wide with disbelief.

"Ethan... you actually hit me?"

Ethan Roscente's gaze was as cold as steel, his entire body radiating icy fury.

"You've disgraced the Roscente family name."

Victoria's eyes welled with tears, her lips trembling too much to speak.

Vivian Laurent smirked with disdain.

"That drink earlier clearly didn't teach you any manners. Your mouth is still filthy."

Lucas Lefèvre couldn't help but chuckle.

Vivian never minced words when putting someone in their place.

She turned to Ethan, her tone calm but firm.

"I wasn't the one who leaked news of our divorce."

Her clear voice carried through the room as she addressed the crowd.

"As a single woman now, I'm free to see whoever I please."

The banquet hall fell into stunned silence.

Guests exchanged shocked glances.

The CEO's sudden marriage and divorce announcement had caught everyone off guard.

Victoria gaped in disbelief.

"You... you actually agreed to divorce?"

She couldn't fathom this woman—who'd once sacrificed everything for Ethan—walking away voluntarily.

Ethan gave a silent nod.

Victoria suddenly shrieked in realization:

"You must be after the Roscente fortune!"

Vivian's laugh was cold.

"Ask your brother—have I ever taken a single cent from the Roscentes?"

She straightened her posture, her gaze unwavering.

Her conscience was clear after all these years.

Marrying Ethan had never been about money.
###Chapter 88

"The divorce agreement clearly states Vivian leaves empty-handed."

Victoria Roscente's nails dug into her palms. "How could she walk away without money?"

"Brother, don't be fooled!" Her voice turned shrill. "She schemed her way into the Roscente family and stole Sophia's—"

"Enough!" Ethan Roscente's temple vein bulged. "You're drunk."

As bodyguards escorted Victoria out, she kept screaming. "We're family!"

The banquet hall regained its composure.

Ethan addressed the guests. "My apologies for my sister's behavior."

Polite murmurs filled the air as Mr. Golden finally made his entrance.

"Thank you for your patience." His face glowed with excitement. "The main event begins now."

A velvet-draped cart rolled in. The red silk lifted to reveal a radiant jade Bodhisattva statue.

"An authentic Eastern Han dynasty relic." Mr. Golden beamed. "The only one in such pristine condition worldwide."

Gasps of awe erupted. Vivian Laurent narrowed her eyes and whispered to Lucas Lefèvre.

"What?" Lucas exclaimed. "Mr. Golden, this statue is a fake!"

The crowd erupted.

"Preposterous!" Mr. Golden's face darkened. "I paid 3.8 billion for this!"

Bianca Semona stepped forward with trembling hands. Her magnifying glass revealed the truth.

"It's...a modern replica." She swallowed hard. "The jade origin and carving techniques are inconsistent."

Mr. Golden slammed the table. "Someone switched it! Nobody leaves!"

Disguised as a waiter, Zero studied Vivian from the shadows. His escape plan had been flawless—until this woman caught his attention.

She'd identified his meticulously crafted forgery from across the room with just her naked eye.

A spark of interest flickered in Zero's gaze. This Vivian Laurent woman just became far more intriguing.
###Chapter 89

Zero's heartbeat quickened. If Shadow was alive, where had she been these four years?

That woman's presence felt eerily similar to Shadow's.

He'd never stopped searching for traces of her all these years.

He needed to test this woman. But the situation was chaotic now—he had to escape quickly. For her sake, Zero had already lingered too long here. Things were getting dangerous.

That familiar sensation of being watched prickled Vivian's skin. She scanned the room, only spotting Ethan Roscente standing nearby.

Lucas had gone to cut the jade stones, completely unfazed by the earlier incident. He'd chosen exactly the two raw stones Vivian had pointed out.

Vivian remained still, lost in thought.

The Bodhisattva Jade was sizable. With tonight's security level, who could've smuggled it out unnoticed?

An ordinary person couldn't. But if the organization was involved...

She knew their methods too well. Were they here tonight?

That feeling of being observed—could it be...

A suit jacket suddenly draped over her shoulders. The familiar cologne enveloped her.

Vivian turned to meet Ethan's intense gaze.

"No thanks. I don't need it."

"Put it on. The AC's too strong." His eyes studied her expression. "You feeling unwell?"

"No." She was just thinking.

Stealing the jade right under everyone's noses—that took perfect execution. Who in the organization could pull that off?

As she moved to remove the jacket, Ethan stopped her. "Stop being stubborn. About Victoria—I apologize for her. She's been spoiled since childhood."

"Doesn't matter." Vivian's tone was flat. "I don't waste thoughts on insignificant things."

Ethan fell silent.

His gaze shifted to Lucas in the distance. "Your choice in men remains questionable. He's only focused on himself, not you at all."

Lucas was completely absorbed watching the stone-cutting machine.

Vivian chuckled. "My taste in men has always been terrible. You know that."

Ethan frowned. Was that a dig at him?

"So what now, ex-husband?" Vivian arched a brow. "Unhappy with your own life, so you can't stand seeing others happy?"

"That's not what I meant." Ethan's voice lowered. "I just don't want you repeating past mistakes. You should live for yourself."

"How thoughtful of you."

Seeing the complicated look in Ethan's eyes, Vivian added, "Genuine thanks. You helped me see men's true nature. Don't worry—I won't be foolish again."

The Vivian before Ethan seemed like a different person entirely.

Her plain face now radiated a dazzling brilliance.

"You..." He hesitated. "Never mind."

Vivian scoffed. If Ethan wasn't speaking, she wasn't interested in hearing it anyway. Nothing good ever came from his mouth.
###Chapter 90

The wealthy merchant turned every corner upside down but found nothing.

He had no choice but to interrogate each guest present, yet the results were disappointing—the suspect never surfaced.

At 2 AM, the merchant reluctantly called off the gathering.

Lucas Lefèvre cradled two raw jade stones Vivian Laurent had picked for him, grinning from ear to ear. "Viv, I'm meeting Amy and the gang to celebrate. Wanna join?"

"You kids have fun."

"Need a ride home?"

"No." Vivian waved him off. "Don't keep the ladies waiting."

She watched Lucas drive away before strolling down the deserted street alone.

Around the corner, twenty-something punks with rainbow-colored hair suddenly surrounded her.

"Hey pretty, all alone?"

Vivian scanned their pockmarked faces, her lips twitching. "Money or your lives?"

The thugs exchanged confused glances. Since when did their victims act tougher than them?

They'd been hired by Zero to test her. He suspected this woman might be the legendary Shadow.

"We'll take both!" The bleach-blond leader leered deliberately.

Vivian pointed to a dark alley. "Let's move there. No cameras."

The gang froze. Was this woman... volunteering?

What kind of psycho was she?

Ignoring their stunned expressions, Vivian strode into the alley's depths.

A black Maybach glided past.

"Stop!" Ethan Roscente slammed the window control.

His eyes narrowed as he saw Vivian being herded into the alley by thugs, his face darkening instantly.

Was she insane? Following street punks into a dark alley at night?

And her so-called boyfriend just let this happen?

Ethan pulled out his phone. "Police."

Divorced or not, he couldn't turn a blind eye.

He threw open the car door and marched toward the alley.

Inside, the gang had Vivian completely surrounded.

"Come on, sweetheart, scream a little?" The blond leader shifted awkwardly. Her calmness threw them off.

Vivian cracked her knuckles. "Either fight or shut up."

Just as the thugs prepared to rush her, a dark figure burst into their midst.

Ethan knocked out the nearest punk with one punch, shielding Vivian behind him. "Stay behind me."

Vivian eyed the broad back blocking her view and quietly lowered her raised leg.

"Mr. Roscente, what's this performance about?"
###Chapter 91

Ethan Roscente's towering figure cast Vivian Laurent completely in shadow.

"The police are on their way." His deep voice echoed through the dim alley. "Leave now if you want to live."

The thugs exchanged uneasy glances. Everyone knew the power of Roscente Group in the country. The name Ethan Roscente alone struck fear into hearts.

"Move out!" Their leader gritted his teeth and signaled retreat.

Within moments, the alley emptied except for the two of them.

"Are you hurt?" Ethan turned, his gaze scanning Vivian's form.

She remained silent.

Her original plan to deal with these men had been disrupted by Ethan's sudden appearance.

In the darkness, Ethan couldn't read her expression, assuming she was shaken.

"It's over now." His voice softened.

"I'm fine." Vivian's tone was flat.

She stepped toward the alley exit with Ethan following closely.

"Do you know those men?"

"No."

Vivian was also puzzling over their motives. Neither robbery nor assault - their purpose seemed unusual.

Ethan suddenly asked, "Are you in debt?"

Vivian paused mid-step.

"I can clear it for you." His voice held certainty. "You took nothing in the divorce. Consider this compensation."

"Your imagination runs wild, Mr. Roscente." Vivian's laugh was cold.

"That developer has no real capital for the project, does he?" Ethan grew more agitated. "He's using you to secure loans?"

Vivian ignored him, walking ahead.

Ethan seized her wrist.

"I can provide project funding. Roscente Group can partner with you."

"Let go." Her voice turned icy.

"That man abandoned you. It's not safe to go back now."

"None of your concern."

Ethan tightened his grip. "Must you be so stubborn?"

"Move."

"Get in the car." Ethan left no room for refusal.

As Vivian opened her mouth to protest, the world spun.

Ethan hoisted her over his shoulder, striding toward the black sedan parked nearby.

"Put me down!"

The car door slammed shut.

"To the estate." Ethan ordered the driver.

The vehicle disappeared into the night.
###Chapter 92

Vivian Laurent pounded desperately on the car window. The driver ignored her completely. Ethan Roscente had given strict orders—no one was to stop without his permission.

Ethan dialed his secretary with icy precision. "Find out why those men were targeting her."

The car sped through the streets before screeching to a halt before the Roscente Family Estate. The opulent mansion was where Vivian had stayed while nursing Ethan before their marriage. In three years of marriage, he'd never brought her here.

"Go shower." Ethan frowned. "Clean clothes will arrive shortly."

Vivian stood frozen, her gaze glacial.

"What?" Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Cat got your tongue? Or are you waiting for me to undress you?"

"All this trouble just to make me take a shower?" Vivian's lips curled in mockery.

Ethan remained impassive. "Don't flatter yourself. Where are you living now? Need me to arrange accommodations?"

He truly didn't know his ex-wife. Their post-divorce encounters could be counted on one hand. He didn't even know her current address.

A sharp pain pierced Vivian's chest. To him, Dr. Luna and his foolish ex-wife would always be two different people.

"Save your pity." She sneered. "I'm doing perfectly fine—no shortage of money or roofs over my head."

"Vivian, stop pretending."

"Who's pretending?"

The air between them turned to ice. For the first time, Ethan found this woman utterly incomprehensible.

A phone ringtone shattered the silence. "Sophia Evans" flashed across the screen.

"Ethan, are you done with work?" Sophia's voice floated through the speaker. "Victoria got bullied tonight. I heard you divorced Vivian? She wouldn't take it out on Victoria, would she?"

"She's always been like this—throwing tantrums since her days with the Valrose family. Never deserved you. The divorce was the right call."

Vivian let out a cold laugh, loud enough to be heard. "Birds of a feather flock together."

Dead silence from the other end.

"Ethan!" Sophia's voice trembled. "Who's with you? What are you doing together so late?"

Vivian suddenly leaned in, her crimson lips nearly brushing the phone. She lowered her voice to a sultry whisper laced with suggestive breaths. "Your dear Ethan brought me home...insisted I shower immediately."

In one swift motion, she yanked Ethan's tie, her warm breath caressing his ear. "You hurt me last time...be gentler tonight."
###Chapter 93

"Ethan..." Sophia Evans' voice trembled through the phone.

Her knuckles turned white from gripping the device too tightly.

This was the second time.

The second time she'd overheard Ethan Roscente's compromising sounds with that woman.

Vivian Laurent's kittenish voice made Ethan's throat tighten.

He ended the call abruptly.

"Vivian." Ethan's gaze darkened.

Her natural fragrance drifted toward him—fresh and subtle, unlike those overpowering perfumes.

Vivian had pressed herself against Ethan deliberately, ensuring Sophia heard everything.

Their current position looked intimate, as if he were embracing her.

"What? Afraid I'll devour her?" Vivian arched a brow. "How many nasty things has Miss Evans said about me? That I'm unworthy of you? Or that I'm vicious?"

Ethan's expression shifted slightly.

Sophia did often make such remarks.

"Whatever. We're divorced anyway." Vivian waved a hand dismissively. "Go comfort your first love. I'm leaving."

She turned to go, but Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"Stay tonight. Take the master bedroom." He released her and headed upstairs without another word.

Bodyguards surrounded the mansion.

Vivian had no choice but to remain at the Roscente Family Estate.

...

All the thugs Zero sent to test Vivian ended up in police custody.

He studied the surveillance footage with a scowl.

If she really was Shadow, why hadn't she contacted him in four years?

Using an excuse to stay in the country, he prepared to meet this woman personally.

...

Vivian had been busy lately.

Triple Six Realty had seized Natalie Valois' project and already begun construction.

AN Atelier operated smoothly.

With no major surgeries at the hospital, she enjoyed the break.

Isabella Langley invited her abroad for a racing event, which she eagerly accepted.

The thrill of speeding down the track exhilarated her.

Back at the hotel, she accessed the Dark Web.

"Planning to take a contract?" Isabella entered with her laptop.

"Just browsing." Vivian kept her eyes on the screen.

She searched for clues about the Bodhisattva Jade.

Though she suspected the organization was involved, she needed proof.
###Chapter 94

"Hack into this bank's system for me." Isabella Langley slid her laptop toward Vivian Laurent. "They scammed me into depositing a large sum and now refuse to let me withdraw it."

Vivian smirked and took the computer.

Her slender fingers flew across the keyboard as lines of code flashed on the screen.

Within five minutes, the bank's internal records lay bare before them.

"It's a scam." Isabella's eyes burned with fury as she stared at the screen. "They've already drained all the funds. It's just an empty shell now."

She slammed her palm on the table.

"Dare to cheat me?" Isabella's laugh was icy. "I'll expose them to the world."

Though the bank operated domestically, it was registered overseas with an obscure legal entity.

Isabella swiftly compiled evidence and filed an anonymous report.

The news exploded across international financial circles, even drawing Interpol's attention.

Meanwhile, the racing world was also in an uproar.

Headlines proclaimed: "Racer W Triumphs in Comeback Race."

Inside the Roscente Group CEO's office.

Ethan Roscente studied a covert photo on his screen.

The woman in the racing suit had an unmistakably elegant silhouette.

His eyes narrowed.

Dr. Luna happened to be in France these past few days.

A skilled driver like Night, and now W's sudden reappearance...

Ethan's lips curved slightly.

"Mr. Roscente?"

Simon Eisner's voice snapped him from his thoughts.

Ethan's smile vanished instantly. "Since when do you enter without knocking?"

"I knocked three times." Simon cautiously handed him documents. "These require your signature."

His gaze flickered to the computer screen, shocked to find his boss browsing racing news.

"Also," Simon added, "those thugs you asked me to investigate—they have no financial ties to your wife."

Ethan frowned.

No debts?

Then why had Lucas abandoned Vivian that night?

His phone rang abruptly.

"Ethan, Queen has struck again." Patrick Alpinus's excited voice came through.

"Explain."

"She hacked a transnational bank and exposed their fraud. The entire financial sector is in chaos."

Ethan raised a brow. "How do you know it's her?"

"Who else besides you and Queen could pull this off?" Patrick insisted. "I swear I'll catch her this time!"

"And then what?" Ethan chuckled. "Give her an award?"

"I need to see who this Queen really is!" Patrick grumbled indignantly.

Ethan hung up, his gaze returning to the racing headlines.

Two mysterious women, both stirring up storms.

He found himself anticipating how this game would unfold.
###Chapter 95

Vivian Laurent witnessed the bank's predatory practices against ordinary citizens. Without hesitation, she reported them with a phone call.

The aftermath wasn't her concern.

At dawn the next day, Vivian boarded a flight back home.

Zero had kept watch in the capital for three straight days. The woman resembling Shadow never reappeared.

His investigation revealed she was Ethan Roscente's ex-wife. They had married secretly three years ago before divorcing.

The timeline didn't match Shadow's profile.

When the organization issued an urgent recall order, Zero had no choice but to abandon his pursuit.

At airport security, he brushed past a masked woman.

That familiar silhouette made him pause.

But the boarding announcement sounded, forcing him to hurry away.

If Shadow still lived, she would reach out to him first.

"What's wrong?" Isabella Langley nudged Vivian, who seemed distracted.

Vivian withdrew her gaze. "I felt someone watching me."

"With that ridiculous outfit? No one could recognize you." Isabella teased as their car arrived. "Let's go."

The moment they got home, Emily Garnache's message popped up—an invitation to a trendy new restaurant.

Vivian raised an eyebrow at the location. She knew the place intimately—it was one of her own establishments.

"Vivian! They say this place has a month-long waiting list!" Emily tugged her toward the entrance excitedly.

A hostess stopped them at the door. "Apologies. We're fully booked tonight."

Emily's face fell. "Should we go somewhere else?"

"Sure." Vivian shrugged.

Inside the dining room, Natalie Valois was fawning over Oliver Roland.

"I waited two weeks for this reservation," she cooed. "You've been ignoring me lately..."

Oliver stirred his soup absently.

Suddenly, he shot up, eyes locked on the entrance.

"Vivian!"

She turned to meet his delighted gaze.

Across from him, Natalie's expression darkened instantly.

"Who's that?" Emily studied Oliver curiously.

"Join us!" Oliver gestured eagerly. "We've got two extra seats."

Natalie's nails dug into her palms.
###Chapter 96

Emily Garnache stared at the exquisite dishes on the menu, swallowing hard. Yet she hesitated about the shared table suggestion. Though this person was Vivian Laurent's friend, they were still a stranger.

She was about to decline politely when a shrill female voice interrupted.

"Some people don't even have reservations yet dare to put on airs here?"

Natalie Valois approached in high heels, linking arms with Oliver Roland. Her red nail polish glinted harshly under the lights.

"Vivian, must you haunt me everywhere like a jinx?" Her crimson lips curled. "Still obsessed with someone else's fiancé?"

Vivian's eyes darkened. "Watch your mouth."

Curious glances turned their way from other diners.

Oliver's face turned ashen as he grabbed Natalie's wrist. "Enough. Let's go."

She yanked her arm free. "Why should I leave? She ruined our last engagement party! Now she just happens to be here—you really think this is coincidence?"

Her heavily powdered face twisted with rage. "Vivian, you've always played the innocent victim while being a scheming bitch behind the scenes!"

"Natalie!" Oliver snapped. "Vivian didn't know we'd be here. Stop this nonsense."

"I'm being unreasonable?" Her voice rose sharply. "Oliver Roland, remember who your fiancée is! You're defending this homewrecker?"

"I invited Vivian." Emily interjected timidly. "I chose the time and place—"

"Silence!" Natalie shot her a glare. "Who asked for your input?"

Emily's eyes instantly reddened, fingers nervously twisting her clothes.

Vivian patted her shoulder gently before turning an icy gaze on Natalie. "I have zero interest in your man. If you can't keep him, that's your problem."

"Spare me the act!" Natalie scoffed. "This place requires reservations a week in advance. Did you book?"

She smirked at the waiter. "Do they have reservations?"

The waiter shook his head.

"See?" Natalie shrilled. "She stalked us here! Raised in the countryside with no manners—what else can she do besides seduce men?"

Oliver tried to speak but was drowned out by her tirade.

Emily trembled with anger. "Vivian would never—"

Vivian pulled her back sharply, eyes glinting like steel blades.
###Chapter 97

Vivian gently pressed Emily's wrist, signaling her not to mention medical skills.

The Valrose family knew nothing about her true background.

She shot Natalie an icy glare, radiating an intimidating aura.

"Natalie, is there anything in your head besides men?"

"Last warning. I'm only here to eat. As for your man, I wouldn't touch him even if you paid me."

Natalie burst into exaggerated laughter, drawing stares from nearby diners.

"What did you say? Ban me from dining here? Who do you think you are? The owner?"

A faint smile played on Vivian's lips.

"Correct guess."

Natalie froze momentarily before scoffing.

"Waiter! Someone's causing trouble here. Get her out!"

The waiter stood frozen in place.

"Who said I don't have a reservation?" Vivian leisurely pulled out her phone. "Care to make a bet?"

"What kind?" Natalie hissed through clenched teeth.

"If I have a private dining room here, you'll kneel and kowtow to me."

Natalie trembled with rage.

"Have you lost your mind?"

"Chickening out?"

Natalie's eyes darted. This restaurant was notoriously hard to book. How could Vivian possibly have a private room?

"And if you lose?"

"Name your terms."

Emily stomped her foot anxiously.

"Vivian! Let's just eat somewhere else!"

Seeing this, Natalie grew more confident.

"Fine! If you lose, not only will you kowtow to me, but you'll disappear forever from Oliver's and my sight!"

Oliver's face darkened.

"Enough!"

"Oliver!" Natalie's eyes welled up with crocodile tears. "She's the one bullying me!"

Emily looked ready to cry.

"This isn't fair!"

Vivian calmly dialed a number.

"Prepare the penthouse private room."
###Chapter 98

Emily gazed at Vivian with concern, but the woman merely arched an eyebrow with effortless composure. "Why wouldn't I dare?"

A venomous glint flashed in Natalie's eyes as she envisioned Vivian groveling on her knees. She would record every humiliating second and broadcast it for the world to see.

"Everyone here is our witness." Natalie lifted her chin haughtily. "Don't start crying when you get thrown out, Vivian."

"I always keep my word." Vivian smoothed her sleeve. "The question is—will you?"

"Ridiculous!" Natalie sneered, already tasting victory.

Vivian gave Emily's hand a reassuring squeeze before addressing the waiter. "Fetch your manager. Tell him Vivian Laurent requests his presence."

"You think dropping your name will intimidate anyone?" Natalie's shrill laughter cut through the air. "Or are you still clinging to the Valrose family's coattails? Give it up—you've been disowned!"

Vivian ignored her, her calm gaze fixed on the waiter.

After a brief hesitation, the waiter dialed the internal line. To everyone's astonishment, the elusive manager arrived within moments.

"Start recording," Vivian murmured to Emily. "This will make entertaining viewing later."

Though uneasy, Emily raised her phone to capture the scene. Natalie watched with disdain, anticipating Vivian's downfall.

The manager rushed forward and bowed deeply. "Ms. Laurent!"

The address stunned the entire room. His fingers trembled slightly—this was the first time the restaurant's mysterious investor had ever visited in person.

"My friend and I would like a private dining room," Vivian said coolly.

"Of course! Your reserved suite is always available." The manager gestured eagerly.

The waiter's eyes widened. The exclusive VIP room that had never been opened to the public—had it been waiting for her all along?

"No hurry." Vivian turned to Natalie with a faint smile. "Time to honor our agreement."

Natalie's face drained of color. "This—this isn't fair! You set me up by knowing the manager!"

"The terms were clear." Vivian enunciated each word. "All I needed was access to the private dining room. Surely you're not backing out in front of everyone, Natalie?"
###Chapter 99

"Who's the sore loser here?" Natalie Valois spat through gritted teeth. "Everyone saw you cheating!"

Emily Garnache scoffed. "Vivian won fair and square. If you're so jealous, why don't you try pulling strings too?"

Her eyes sparkled with admiration. She couldn't believe Vivian had connections at this exclusive restaurant. So cool.

"Shut up!" Natalie glared daggers at Emily. "You're nothing but Vivian's lapdog!"

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Vivian Laurent retracted her hand, eyes icy. "Insult my friend again. I dare you."

Emily's heart raced. That slap was legendary. Even as a girl, she felt butterflies.

"You hit me?" Natalie clutched her cheek in disbelief.

"You lost the bet." Vivian's voice remained calm. "Backing out now?"

"This was a setup!" Natalie shrieked. "Why should I kneel?"

"Disgusting!" Emily's face flushed with anger. Raised properly, she couldn't think of harsher words.

Vivian nodded. "Fine."

Natalie exhaled in relief and turned to leave.

A sudden pain shot through her knees, sending her crashing to the floor.

Vivian loomed over her. "Did I say you could go?"

Snickers rippled through the crowd.

"Vivian!" Natalie burned with humiliation. She struggled to stand but couldn't move from the pain.

"Remember this lesson." Vivian's voice turned glacial. "Next time won't be so easy."

She took Emily's hand and headed toward their private dining room.

Emily waved her phone. "This video's going viral~"

Oliver Roland hurried to help Natalie up.

"Ahhh!" Natalie screamed hysterically. "I'll kill her!"

Security blocked her path as she lunged forward.

The manager announced impassively, "Miss Valois, you're now banned from this establishment."

Natalie trembled violently. Her wedding ruined, forced to kneel in public, now ejected from the restaurant—she'd become nothing but a pathetic joke in Vivian's shadow.
###Chapter 100

Natalie clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. She stared at Vivian's retreating figure, her eyes burning with hatred.

"Oliver!" Oliver Roland grabbed her wrist. "Have you lost your mind?"

"But she—"

"Enough!" He shoved her hand away. "Do you realize how humiliating that was? Stay away from Vivian."

Natalie stumbled back, her face pale.

"I love Vivian," Oliver said coldly. "Don't come near me again."

He turned and walked away, his dress shoes clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Oliver!" Natalie chased him to the entrance, only to see his black sports car speed off.

She bit her lip until she tasted blood.

Vivian.

This was all Vivian's fault.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number. "I want Vivian Laurent ruined."

——

Inside the private dining room, crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow.

"Vivian!" Emily Garnache rushed over excitedly. "You were amazing! Did you see Natalie's face?"

Vivian took the menu from the manager. "Order whatever you like."

"You own this place?" Emily's eyes widened. "Is there anything you can't do?"

"Plenty," Vivian said with a faint smile.

Emily rested her chin on her hand. "Natalie won't let this go."

"She can't touch me," Vivian sipped her tea. "But you should be careful."

"Got it!" Emily pulled out her phone. "I already sent her the video."

Vivian smirked. "Well done."

After dinner, Vivian personally drove Emily home.

——

The hospital hallway still reeked of disinfectant.

"Dr. Laurent!" Ryan Fairsprene hurried over. "You're back!"

Nathan Clementson stood by the office door, his lab coat immaculate.

"Dr. Clementson," Vivian nodded.

"Ryan was frantic while you were gone," Dr. Liang teased.

Ryan's ears turned red. "I... I just had some cases to discuss..."

"Let's exchange contacts," Vivian took out her phone.

Nathan's gaze flickered between them before he turned and entered his office.
###Chapter 101

"Sure, add me." Vivian smoothly pulled up her QR code and slid it toward Ryan Fairsprene.

The notification ping sounded as the scan completed. She tucked her phone into her lab coat pocket and turned toward the exam room.

The waiting area was packed with patients, the line stretching down the hallway.

"Dr. Laurent, my knee has hurt for three years." An elderly woman with silver hair clutched her joint, brows furrowed.

Vivian's fingers pressed lightly against the swollen area. "Meridian blockage. Two needles will fix it."

Silver flashed between her fingers as the acupuncture needles found their marks. The woman's eyes widened. "It's a miracle! The pain's gone!"

"Follow up in two weeks." Vivian scribbled notes while calling, "Next."

The young man had barely sat down when she spoke. "Dizziness, fatigue, muscle aches?"

"How did you know?" He nearly jumped up. "No other hospital could diagnose me."

"See Dr. Wang in cardiology." Her pen flew across the prescription pad. "Your heart's the issue."

At 2 PM, the last patient finally left. Rubbing her stiff neck, Vivian returned to her office to find a thermal lunchbox on her desk.

"Did you bring this, Nathan?" She peeked into the next room.

Nathan Clementson shook his head. "Not me."

"That..." Ryan's ears turned pink. "I noticed you always miss meals..."

"Thanks." She lifted the lid. Steam rose from the hot food. Only then did she check her phone. A message from Ethan Roscente glowed on the lock screen.

"Race me?"

Vivian arched a brow. The championship trophy from France still sat in her study—earned under the alias "W."

She recalled their last motorcycle duel, Ethan relentlessly tailing her. That final hairpin pass had been a close victory.

"Didn't lose hard enough last time?" She sent a mocking sticker.

His reply was instant. "Supercars this time."

She snorted. Her fingers danced across the screen. "Try not to cry when you lose."

"Scared?" Ethan fired back.

"Send time and location." She set down her chopsticks. "I'll show you what professional looks like."

Across town, the man smirked. His friend from the French circuit had just sent footage—a petite figure in a full-face helmet executing an impossible last-turn overtake.

This time, he'd witness "W's" skills firsthand.
###Chapter 102

Ethan Roscente's racetrack location pin was precise. Vivian Laurent glanced at it and confirmed the details.

She casually texted Isabella Langley: "Want to watch some excitement?"

"Absolutely!" Isabella replied instantly. "But why is he suddenly challenging you to a race?"

"Who knows," Vivian chuckled. "Probably still bitter about losing last time."

"Then let's make him lose even harder this time."

"My thoughts exactly."

The appointed day arrived quickly.

The racetrack was sizable, with a circular track surrounded by spectator stands. The central obstacle course looked particularly challenging.

Numerous racers had gathered for the event, filling every seat in the stands.

When Vivian and Isabella arrived, Ethan had been waiting for some time. Felix Valdemar stood beside him, immediately scoffing at Isabella's appearance.

"Save your snorts," Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Don't come crying when you lose later."

"In your dreams! Last time Ethan went easy on you. Today's the real deal—outcome's still undecided!"

Felix remained unaware that Vivian was the legendary racer W, despite being W's devoted fan.

"If you can't handle losing, just admit it. No need for excuses."

"Ethan's skills speak for themselves. Only my goddess W could possibly beat him."

"Wait," Isabella suddenly became intrigued. "Who's this goddess of yours?"

"Racer W!" Felix declared proudly. "Undefeated since debut, just won last month's international championship!"

His enthusiasm suggested he'd personally claimed the trophy.

Isabella: "..."

"Could you recognize W if she stood right in front of you?"

"Of course!" Felix thumped his chest. "I'd know my goddess by her silhouette alone!"

Despite W never having revealed her identity publicly.

Vivian: "..."

Isabella sighed: "I recommend an eye exam."

Couldn't even recognize his idol standing before him, yet spouting such nonsense.

"You're the one needing glasses! My vision's 20/20!"

"Enough." Ethan cut Felix off.

The embarrassment of failing to recognize the real deal was too much.

"Bro, I'm backing you up here!" Felix protested. "I'm betting on your win!"

"Then I'm betting on my champion!" Isabella immediately countered.

"Five million!"

"Ten million!" Isabella doubled down.

Their rivalry escalated.

Amused, Vivian turned to Ethan: "Not placing a wager, Mr. Roscente?"

"What's your stake?" Ethan arched an eyebrow.

Vivian rested her chin in hand, considering. Money held no appeal, nor did other trivialities.

"How about this," she suddenly smiled. "If I win, I get to sit in the Roscente Group CEO's chair for two days?"

Felix's eyes bulged. Was this woman insane? Daring to covet the Roscente empire!

Yet Ethan responded without hesitation: "Agreed."

He met Vivian's gaze directly: "If I win, you cure Sophia Evans."
###Chapter 103

Vivian Laurent's fingers tightened slightly as she heard the terms of the wager.

She let out a cold laugh. "No deal."

Ethan Roscente raised an eyebrow. "Afraid to lose, Dr. Laurent?"

"Afraid?" A sharp glint flashed in her eyes. "I just realized the position of Roscente Group's CEO isn't worthy of me."

Felix Valdemar nearly choked on his own saliva.

The woman's audacity was infuriating.

"Boss, she's bluffing," Felix whispered to Ethan. "Everyone knows W never takes a gamble she can't win."

Isabella Langley shoved Felix aside. "Who asked for your opinion?"

"Isabella!" Felix snapped. "Can't you control that temper of yours?"

"Control this!" She grabbed a water bottle and hurled it at him.

Felix ducked and scrambled away. "Gentlemen use words, not violence!"

"I'm no gentleman!"

Their chase disappeared down the racetrack in seconds.

Only two figures remained in the empty space.

Vivian turned to leave, but Ethan suddenly gripped her wrist.

"Dr. Laurent," he said, voice low. "I helped you at the hospital last time."

Her gaze turned icy.

For once, Ethan felt an unfamiliar pressure. Sophia Evans' condition was deteriorating. His private physician had issued an ultimatum.

He couldn't afford to let this chance slip.

"So?" Vivian's smile was frosty.

Ethan met her eyes. "I'm calling in that favor. One race."

"You win, name your price. I win, you save Sophia."

Vivian's chest rose and fell sharply. Memories flashed—Ethan shielding her, his blood staining her lab coat.

Now that debt had become a bargaining chip.

"Deal," she bit out. "But I have conditions."

Ethan nodded. "Name them."

"If I win, Roscente Group is mine. You disappear—permanently." Her eyes burned with challenge. "If you win, I'll save her. Once."

Ethan extended his hand. "Agreed."

Vivian ignored it and strode toward the car.

She was W—the undefeated racer. Today, Ethan would pay.

This twisted bond would end here.
###Chapter 104

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

A sharp pang shot through his chest, as if pierced by countless tiny needles.

Vivian's gaze was icy cold, looking at him like a complete stranger. This sudden distance made him inexplicably agitated.

"Does Mr. Roscente agree?" Vivian's voice held no warmth.

"Fine."

"Then let's race."

Vivian's fingers tapped lightly against the steering wheel. As the legendary racer W, she'd never lost before. This time would be no exception.

She would never save Sophia Evans.

"Let go." Her eyes dropped to Ethan's hand gripping her wrist.

Ethan released his hold. Vivian turned and walked deeper into the parking garage, her red racing suit blazing under the fluorescent lights.

Ethan chose a black sports car.

In the dim corner of the locker room, a heavily cloaked woman emerged. She crept toward Vivian's red race car and quickly tampered with it.

...

Isabella pushed open the locker room door.

"Viv, are you really going through with this bet?"

"Yes."

"What's at stake?"

After hearing Vivian's brief explanation, Isabella stomped her foot in outrage.

"This is outrageous! I should tell Ethan you're his ex-wife! Forcing his ex to save his first love? What kind of monster does that?"

Vivian stopped her with a hand. "Don't. I won't lose."

"After you win, we'll tell him. Let him regret this forever!"

"Mm." Vivian fastened her seatbelt.

"I'll be cheering from the stands. Even professional racers can't beat you - what chance does Ethan have?"

Vivian adjusted her gloves. "Don't underestimate him. In our past encounters, his skills rivaled professionals."

This race, she must win.

"I believe in you!"

"I will win." Vivian flashed a confident smile.

At the locker room entrance, the two crossed paths again.

Ethan paused, his dark eyes studying Vivian intently.

She walked past him without a glance.

Isabella glared daggers at him. "Jerk!"

Ethan frowned.

What had he done to deserve that?

The red racing suit accentuated Vivian's slender frame. Her determined stride carried a hint of melancholy.

Ethan suddenly realized - that silhouette resembled his ex-wife's.

At the gala days ago, the woman in the evening gown had carried herself with the same poised grace.
###Chapter 105

Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed deeper.

The thought took root like wildfire.

Every piece of evidence denied the possibility, yet that inexplicable familiarity lingered.

"Ethan?" Felix Valdemar tapped his shoulder. "The race is starting."

Ethan snapped back to reality and strode toward his black sports car.

Vivian Laurent's red racer already idled at the starting line.

The two vehicles stood side by side like coiled predators.

"Three... two... one!"

Engines roared as the scarlet machine shot forward like an arrow.

Ethan pursued relentlessly.

The winding track bristled with obstacles.

Vivian navigated each hazard with surgical precision.

His rearview mirror reflected the black car's unwavering pursuit.

"Trying to pass me?" Vivian smirked, jerking the wheel.

Sparks flew as their vehicles grazed during a sharp turn.

"Brilliant!" Spectators gasped.

Felix waved excitedly. "Go Ethan!"

"Vivian, you've got this!" Isabella Langley cheered through a megaphone. "Turn Roscente Tower into a hot pot restaurant if you win!"

Felix nearly choked. "Isabella, you—"

A sudden commotion interrupted him.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea.

A woman in sunglasses approached. When she removed her mask, collective gasps erupted.

"It's Sophia Evans!"

"The movie queen has returned!"

Felix whirled around, his pupils contracting.
###Chapter 106

Sophia Evans' gaze settled on Felix Valdemar, her lips curving into a perfectly measured smile. "Felix, long time no see."

"Sophia?" Felix blinked in surprise. "Weren't you abroad?"

As Ethan Roscente's childhood friend, he knew Sophia well. Though unaware of their complicated history, he'd noticed Ethan's special consideration for this woman.

"I just returned today." Sophia tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "I heard about the race and came to watch. Is Ethan competing? Which car is his?"

Her eyes shimmered as she spoke, every gesture exuding elegance. The moment Victoria Roscente told her about Ethan's divorce, she'd booked the first flight back.

This was destiny's gift.

The title of Mrs. Roscente would be hers.

She'd been observing from the shadows. That woman standing beside Ethan was AN from the International Perfumery Awards. That breathtaking face set off alarm bells in Sophia's mind.

No wonder she'd felt instant dislike upon their first meeting.

Now she understood—this woman also coveted Ethan.

Their intimacy stung Sophia's eyes. With practiced subtlety, she'd tampered with the red sports car. At such speeds, any accident would be...

Felix pointed to the track. "Ethan's racing. The black one's his."

"How nostalgic." Sophia sighed softly. "Feels like yesterday when we all raced together."

Isabella Langley stood nearby, her stomach churning.

The woman's pretentious act made her nauseous.

"Ugh!" The sound escaped before she could stop it.

Felix turned with concern. "Isabella, are you okay?"

"Fine." Isabella covered her nose. "Just caught a whiff of something foul. Can't tell where that disgusting stench is coming from."

Felix looked bewildered.

Sophia's expression flickered before smoothing over. "Felix, is this your girlfriend?" Her tone dripped faux concern. "I've heard olfactory hallucinations can indicate health issues. Should she see a doctor?"

"She's not my girlfriend!" Felix denied hastily.

"Who'd want to date you?" Isabella rolled her eyes at Sophia. "Of course you can't smell your own stench. At least you're self-aware—just shameless as hell."

She smirked coldly. "How does something this repulsive even exist? Wait, calling you 'something' insults actual objects."
###Chapter 107

Sophia Evans' perfectly made-up face twisted in rage. No one had ever humiliated her in public like this.

The A-list actress clenched her fists so hard her nails dug into her palms. She couldn't afford to lose her composure in front of the crowd.

Felix Valdemar frowned. "Isabella Langley, you've gone too far."

"Want to hear something even worse?" Isabella lifted her chin defiantly. "Everything I said was true."

She never minced words or pretended to be nice to please anyone.

Felix fell silent.

He turned to Sophia. "Don't take her seriously."

Sophia forced a smile. "It's fine. This young lady has quite the personality."

Isabella ignored them and raised her megaphone. "Go Vivian!"

Not to be outdone, Felix rushed to the broadcast booth and grabbed the microphone. "Ethan for the win!"

The sound system amplified his voice across the racetrack.

Sophia sauntered over gracefully. "Let me say something too."

She took the mic and cooed, "Ethan, I flew back just to watch your race. You've got this!"

The crowd erupted.

"It really is Sophia Evans! I heard Mr. Roscente chartered an entire yacht for her birthday last month!"

"Oh my god, she came back just for him. So sweet!"

The deafening cheers reached the track.

Ethan Roscente swerved slightly, nearly losing control. Sophia was back?

Inside the red race car, Vivian Laurent felt a sharp pang in her chest.

So that was his plan. Ethan had even called Sophia back. Was he that confident of winning?

The two cars raced neck and neck. Seizing the moment when Ethan was distracted, Vivian floored the gas pedal and overtook him.

But when she tried to brake, the pedal went limp.

What?

The car had passed all safety checks. As the speed kept increasing, danger loomed.

Sophia's voice still echoed through the speakers. "Ethan, I'll be waiting at the finish line!"

She walked elegantly toward the finish, her eyes glinting coldly when they landed on the red race car.

The out-of-control vehicle was already careening dangerously.
###Chapter 108

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes at the red sports car ahead.

Vivian Laurent's speed was unnaturally fast.

She didn't slow down at the sharp turn ahead. Tires screeched against the pavement, sending sparks flying.

Was she insane?

Final lap. The finish line was within reach.

Ethan stayed close, but Vivian maintained her lead.

The steep slope before the finish was his last chance.

The red car roared past. Ethan slammed the accelerator. His black racer launched into the air like a hawk, soaring over Vivian's car.

The crowd erupted.

A flawless aerial overtake.

Ethan crossed the finish line first.

He exhaled. Victory.

But something was wrong.

Vivian's car had veered off course during the descent, slowing abruptly. Uncharacteristic for her.

"Ethan!" Sophia Evans flung herself at him, arms wrapping around his waist. "I knew you'd win!"

She tilted her face up. "Let's celebrate tonight, just us. You haven't spent time with me since I returned..."

Ethan ignored her.

His gaze locked onto the red car speeding away.

Vivian hadn't stopped.

She was still driving dangerously fast.

Ethan's pupils contracted. He shoved Sophia aside and jumped back into the driver's seat.

"Ethan!" Sophia stomped her foot in frustration.

His black racer shot forward like an arrow.

Sophia glared at the retreating taillights. That woman...her skills were unnatural. At that speed, she shouldn't have avoided every obstacle so precisely.

Inside the car, Vivian stomped on the brakes.

Useless.

She'd lost. The deal required her to save Sophia now.

The rearview mirror reflected Ethan embracing Sophia.

Hah.

Vivian smirked coldly.

Suddenly, blaring horns pierced the air.

Ethan's car was closing in.
###Chapter 109

The engine roared as Ethan Roscente floored the accelerator.

His black sports car shot forward like an arrow, finally catching up to the out-of-control red race car at the third turn.

"Vivian!" He rolled down the window and shouted.

The howling wind and engine noise made Vivian Laurent's ears ache.

Her knuckles turned white gripping the steering wheel as the car scraped against the guardrail with a screech.

Ethan jerked the wheel hard, slamming his vehicle against the red racer.

Metal groaned as the two cars collided.

Gasps erupted from the spectator stands.

"That car's malfunctioning!"

"Oh God, the brakes are gone!"

"This driver's ice cold. I'd have fainted by now."

The red racer finally began slowing under the dual resistance.

Vivian's back was drenched in cold sweat.

When both vehicles came to a complete stop, Ethan kicked his door open and rushed over.

"Vivian!" He pounded on her window.

The door opened to reveal Vivian's pale face.

Ethan grabbed her shoulders. "Are you hurt?"

Before she could answer, a shrill female voice cut through the air.

"Ethan!"

Sophia Evans came running in heels, her perfect makeup streaked with tears.

Vivian coldly pushed Ethan away.

"I'm fine."

"Let's get you to the hospital." He reached for her again.

"Not necessary." She shook him off.

Sophia had already thrown herself into Ethan's arms.

"You scared me to death!" She sobbed dramatically. "If anything happened to you, I—"

Ethan stiffened, trying to disentangle himself.

"Let go."

Sophia only clung tighter while glaring daggers at Vivian.

The sight of that stunning face made her dig her nails into her palms.

"Ethan, who is this—"

Breaking free, Ethan strode to the red racer.

When he popped the hood, the acrid smell of chemicals assaulted his nostrils.

The brake line was coated with a strange green liquid.
###Chapter 110

Ethan Roscente's furious voice echoed across the empty racetrack. "Who tampered with the brakes? Are the track inspectors blind?"

His fists clenched, veins bulging.

The manager rushed over, sweat beading on his forehead. "Mr. Roscente, we'll investigate immediately."

"Investigate?" Ethan's gaze sharpened like a blade. "What will you do if someone had died?"

Now he understood why Vivian Laurent had been forced to slow down before the finish line.

The realization that her brakes had failed made his victory feel hollow.

"The race is void," he declared. "We'll switch cars and restart. The wager stands. Agreed?"

Sophia Evans watched Ethan's attention remain fixed solely on Vivian. Suddenly, she clutched her chest, gasping dramatically. "Ethan... I feel terrible..."

He turned to steady her. "What's wrong?"

Vivian observed the scene with icy amusement. Such pathetic acting was an insult to anyone's intelligence.

First, she'd faked fainting. Now, she was pretending to be ill. Vivian's secret identity as AN was clearly no longer safe.

More suspiciously, the brakes had failed at this precise moment.

Isabella Langley came running. "Viv! There was something wrong with your car!"

"Someone sabotaged the brakes."

"What?" Isabella's eyes widened. "This was attempted murder! I hope the bastard rots in hell!"

Vivian's frosty gaze locked onto Sophia. "Exactly. And when I find out who did it—"

Her words sliced through the air. "I'll take their hand."

Sophia paled, fingers trembling uncontrollably.

Ethan's voice turned grave. "I'll handle this."

"Don't bother." Vivian's laugh was razor-sharp. "Attempted homicide deserves personal retribution."

A lethal aura radiated from her. Sophia's legs buckled, and she clung to Ethan's sleeve.

"Ethan..." she whimpered. "Take me home, please?"

"I'll have someone escort you." He remained unmoved.

Panicked, Sophia tried to flee.

"Stop." Vivian blocked her path. "Leaving so soon?"
###Chapter 111

Sophia Evans turned deathly pale, taking half a step back.

"You're slandering me!" Her voice trembled. "When did I ever attempt murder? You targeted Victoria at the International Perfumery Awards, and now you're framing me?"

She turned to Ethan Roscente with tear-filled eyes.

"Ethan, I feel dizzy..." She clutched her chest, breathing rapidly. "Can I go rest?"

Ethan frowned deeply.

The perfumery competition? Vivian had issues with Victoria?

He pushed aside his confusion. "Dr. Laurent, Sophia just arrived. She couldn't have done this."

"Making conclusions without investigation, Mr. Roscente?" Vivian's laugh was icy.

To Ethan, Sophia would always be innocent.

"She's unwell," Ethan insisted. "I'll take responsibility for whatever happened."

"Unnecessary." Vivian's gaze sharpened like a blade. "The surveillance footage is coming. Surely Miss Evans can last a few more minutes?"

She locked eyes with Ethan. "Don't worry. Even if she dies, I can revive her."

Sophia's pupils contracted.

This woman was a perfumer. Since when did she practice medicine?

Ethan didn't press further. Soon, the racetrack manager hurried over.

"Mr. Roscente, the footage is blurry." The manager handed over a tablet. "The suspect was fully covered. We can't see their face."

The video showed a shadowy figure sneaking toward the race car, pouring an unknown liquid on the brake line.

Sophia exhaled in relief. "This proves my innocence, doesn't it?"

"It's a woman," Vivian zoomed in. "Any objections?"

The crowd shook their heads.

"There are plenty of women here!" Sophia shrieked.

"But only one wears this ring." Vivian suddenly grabbed her wrist.

The frozen footage showed the perpetrator's ring finger glinting with a diamond as they poured the liquid.

Sophia tried jerking back, but Vivian held firm.

The rings were identical.

"A celebrity attempting murder." Isabella Langley recorded with her phone. "How would your fans react to this going viral?"

Sophia's face turned ashen.
###Chapter 112

Sophia's fingertips trembled.

She never expected Vivian would unravel her carefully laid scheme so quickly.

"The surveillance footage will prove my innocence... Ethan, you have to believe me!" Sophia clutched at Ethan's sleeve.

A storm brewed in Ethan's eyes.

He had just been defending Sophia moments ago, only to have reality slap him across the face.

"Checking footage takes too long." Vivian's laugh was icy. "Let's run a DNA test on this trench coat instead. See who really wore it."

Her gaze cut like a blade.

Sophia's lips lost all color.

Vivian tightened her grip. "Need me to refresh your memory about how you set this up?"

Beads of cold sweat formed on Sophia's forehead.

She tried to pull away, but Vivian twisted her wrist sharply.

A sickening crack echoed through the air.

Sophia's scream pierced the silence.

"Vivian!" Ethan's pupils constricted.

"Does it hurt?" Vivian released Sophia's limp wrist. "She just tried to kill me."

Her voice could freeze hell.

"If I hadn't reacted fast enough, I'd be in the hospital right now." Vivian stepped closer to Ethan. "The woman you're protecting is a murderer."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

He had no rebuttal.

Had that out-of-control race car hit the stands, the consequences would have been catastrophic.

"I warned you." Vivian wiped her hands. "I'd break one of her hands."

She glanced at Sophia curled on the floor. "This is just the beginning."

Her coat flared sharply as she turned.

Isabella made a slashing motion across her throat at Sophia. "Expect our lawyer's letter!"

"Vivian!" Ethan moved to follow, but Sophia grabbed his pant leg.

"Ethan..." She held up her deformed wrist with tear-filled eyes. "It hurts..."

Gritting his teeth, Ethan scooped her up.

During the ride to the hospital, Vivian's resolute back kept flashing through his mind.

Meanwhile, Sophia was calculating.

This injury might become her opportunity to get closer to Ethan.

"Minor fracture." The doctor secured the splint. "Two weeks of rest."

In the hospital room, Sophia deliberately displayed her bandaged hand.

"Ethan..." Her voice quivered. "That woman is terrifying..."

She lifted her pale face. "Will you... protect me?"

Ethan's chiseled profile looked especially striking under the lights.

Sophia gazed at him with fascination.

He was far more handsome than Alexander.

If not for what happened back then... she would never have chosen that sickly man.
###Chapter 113

"Sophia Evans, how do you explain your fingerprints on the brake pads?" Ethan Roscente's voice was icy.

His scrutinizing gaze bore into her.

The Sophia he remembered was gentle and considerate, maintaining her kindness despite humble beginnings.

She had always upheld her principles in the cutthroat entertainment industry.

For years, he had looked out for her at his late brother's request.

But this woman who tampered with the brakes was unrecognizable to him.

"Ethan, are you convicting me based on a blurry video? She broke my wrist—I'm the victim here!" Sophia refused to admit guilt.

"I gave up my career abroad to return for you. You promised Alexander you'd take care of me. If he were still here, he'd never let me suffer like this."

Tears streamed down her face like broken pearls.

Ethan's anger cooled slightly at her display of emotion.

"I'll find out the truth. Why would you harm a stranger like this?"

Sophia bit her lip, eyes glistening. "After all these years, you'd rather trust an outsider than me?"

Ethan fell silent. The Sophia he knew wouldn't do such things.

But Vivian Laurent never acted without reason. Frustrated, he rubbed his temples.

"Did you know each other before?" he asked, changing the subject.

Seeing his softened demeanor, Sophia relaxed slightly.

"You didn't know she's AN? Last time, she bullied Victoria during the International Perfumery Awards. She must have recognized me today and framed me deliberately! That video doesn't even show faces clearly—what kind of evidence is that?"

Her attack on Vivian stemmed from noticing Ethan's unusual interest in the woman.

"AN?" Ethan's pupils constricted.

He had considered the possibility before dismissing it. AN had been established for years—how old was Vivian?

So she wasn't just Dr. Luna and racer W, but also fashion designer AN.

The girl was like a diamond, each facet dazzling brilliantly.

"Ethan, is she interested in you? She targeted me last time and framed me now. My instincts say she's getting close to you with ulterior motives." Sophia seized the chance to slander.

"Enough!" Ethan cut her off sharply. "I'll judge her character myself."

Vivian couldn't even be bothered to glance at him—how could she be scheming against him?

Seeing his defense of Vivian, Sophia felt a thorn pierce her heart.

"Was she the woman on the phone last time?" This mattered most to her.

Ethan had never had women around him all these years.

"No." His answer was crisp. That had been his ex-wife, not Vivian.

Sophia studied his expression carefully. Convinced he wasn't lying, she relaxed slightly.

But the intimidating woman still posed a threat.

"You called her Dr. Laurent? Isn't she a perfumer? What's her full name?" Sophia probed further.
###Chapter 114

"Her name is Vivian Laurent." Ethan Roscente's voice was icy.

Sophia Evans' pupils constricted sharply. "Vivian? Isn't that your—"

Her voice trembled as her nails dug into her palms.

"Victoria told me you were divorced." Sophia forced a smile. "She can't possibly be that ugly girl."

The Vivian she remembered was dark-skinned, overweight, and covered in freckles. That country bumpkin wasn't fit to stand beside Ethan.

"Just a coincidence." Ethan's tone remained indifferent.

Sophia exhaled in relief but couldn't resist probing. "You're so kind to her because of the name?"

Ethan's eyes darkened.

His initial approach to Vivian had indeed been for Sophia's illness. But the woman's eyes were too clear, like spring water, drawing him in against his will.

"Why did you return suddenly?" He changed the subject.

"I missed you." Sophia softened her voice. "Victoria said you'd be at the racetrack, so I came."

She deliberately added, "Theo misses you too. Let's visit him together?"

Mentioning their child always softened Ethan's heart.

"There's a flight for you tomorrow." Ethan's response was crisp.

Sophia's face paled. "I just got back!"

"Rest at the hospital tonight." Ethan walked away without looking back.

The moment the door closed, Sophia's expression twisted.

She grabbed her phone and dialed her agent. "Find out who was at the racetrack today! Look for a woman with my build wearing a ring!"

Even if she had to fabricate evidence.

Ethan would investigate. She had to prepare.
###Chapter 115

Ethan Roscente drove away from the hospital alone. Neon lights blurred through the rain-streaked windshield, distorting his vision.

He dialed Simon Eisner's number, his voice low. "Investigate today's incident."

The steering wheel turned beneath his fingers. When he regained focus, his car had stopped outside Vivian Laurent's villa. The rhythmic swish of wipers cleared the glass again and again.

The house stood dark and silent. Ethan's finger hovered over the doorbell, unmoving.

He lit a cigarette. Smoke curled through the car but couldn't dispel his unease. Vivian's parting expression haunted him.

"Vivian!"
He finally pressed the bell. The chime cut sharply through the rainy night.

No response came from within.

Half an hour later, headlights pierced the downpour. Ethan squinted as Vivian's sports car approached.

The window lowered, revealing Vivian's icy expression. A man's silhouette sat in the passenger seat.

"Something wrong?" Vivian stepped out, raindrops glistening in her hair.

Ethan swallowed hard. "About today... I apologize for Sophia Evans."

"Unnecessary." Vivian cut him off. "We're nothing to each other now."

A sudden horn blast shattered the moment. Through the rain, Ethan saw the man inside glaring at him with open hostility.

"Who is that?" Ethan's voice tightened.

Vivian smirked. "None of your business."

The storm intensified. Ethan remained rooted as Vivian turned toward the villa. The mysterious passenger never emerged, yet his presence loomed large.

"Vivian!" Ethan raised his voice. "At least tell me who he is!"

Only the slam of a door answered him.
###Chapter 116

Ethan Roscente ignored the man's presence.

His intense gaze remained fixed on Vivian Laurent. "I'll send Sophia Evans back to the hospital tomorrow. Her impulsive actions stem from the International Perfumery Awards incident."

"Vivian, I never imagined you're not just Dr. Luna, but also the founder of AN Atelier."

Vivian's expression remained unreadable.

She had anticipated her identity being revealed.

"Are we that close?" she countered.

Ethan hesitated.

"That racing bet..." he began.

Vivian cut him off. "A bet's a bet. I'll examine Sophia's condition."

Ethan should have been elated.

Instead, an inexplicable emptiness settled over him.

"Your car's damaged. We could have a rematch."

"Unnecessary." Vivian turned away. "Goodnight, Mr. Roscente."

She entered her home without looking back.

Ethan stood motionless, staring at the closed door.

"Contact me if you need anything," he murmured.

After her shower, Vivian's phone lit up with notifications.

Isabella Langley had sent a barrage of messages.

"Viv! Check trending! Sophia's murder video just went viral!"

"She's finished this time!"

Vivian opened the news.

The parking lot confrontation footage spread like wildfire.

"Wasn't me," Isabella clarified. "Probably leaked by racetrack spectators."

Sophia's contorted face filled the screen.

Gone was her usual gentle demeanor.

Comments exploded:

"OMG! That's Sophia? Terrifying!"

"Always knew her sweetness was fake!"

"No talent, just rich sponsors backing her!"

Vivian powered off her phone.

Darkness pressed against the windows.

This storm had only just begun.
###Chapter 117

"Did you all miss the key point? That woman Sophia Evans was chasing is breathtakingly gorgeous! Her aura, her elegance—absolutely stunning!"

"I saw the racing footage. She looked insanely cool driving that red sports car. Those drifting skills would make professional racers kneel."

"The car chase was insane. She stopped perfectly even with brake failure. That was some god-tier driving."

"This woman is ruthless! She broke Sophia's wrist! My poor Sophia!"

"Are you brain-dead? What would you do if someone tried to kill you? Breaking one wrist was merciful!"

"Serves her right! I've hated that fake sweetheart Sophia forever. She should get kicked out of showbiz!"

Public opinion was polarized, but Vivian Laurent remained indifferent.

Sophia Evans stared at her phone screen, nails digging into her palms. The situation had spiraled beyond her expectations—Vivian must be pulling strings behind the scenes.

"Is my PR team useless? Delete those posts now!" she screamed into the phone.

Her flustered agent replied, "We're trying, but the trending topics—"

"Did you find the scapegoat?"

"Paid a fortune. She'll confess online, claiming she mistook Vivian for the woman who stole her boyfriend."

Sophia smirked. The decoy wore identical racing gear down to the ring placement.

Soon, a tearful girl's confession video went viral. She admitted attacking Vivian in a jealous rage, mistaking her for a homewrecker.

Sophia's team immediately issued a statement painting her as the innocent victim.

Public sentiment shifted:

"I knew Sophia was framed! How vile to slander her!"

"Hugs for our poor Sophia!"

"Vivian must apologize publicly! How dare she hurt Sophia!"

Watching the tide turn, Sophia exhaled in relief. After years in entertainment, manipulating public opinion was child's play.

"Vivian, you think you can play this game with me?" Her eyes darkened as she glared at the night sky.

At dawn, Ethan Roscente's private jet stood ready—without him.

"I demand to see Ethan!" Sophia shattered a water glass in fury.

His assistant remained impassive. "Mr. Roscente insists you go abroad for treatment."

Unanswered calls. Sophia's knuckles whitened clutching the sheets. The once-devoted Ethan now treated her with icy detachment.

"All because of Vivian..." She gritted her teeth.

If the open approach failed, she'd go underground. Sophia recalled whispers of the "Dark Web"—where any "service" could be bought for the right price.

With a vicious smile, she typed a cryptic URL into her browser. This time, Vivian would disappear permanently.
###Chapter 118

Ethan Roscente sat in his office at Roscente Group, staring at the computer screen with a furrowed brow. The overwhelming online support for Sophia Evans unsettled him.

Simon Eisner had just finished delivering his report. The suspect apprehended by the police was a mentally unstable girl who claimed Vivian Laurent resembled the woman who stole her fiancé. The engagement ring on the girl's finger seemed to corroborate her story.

"The evidence chain is airtight, Mr. Roscente." Simon handed over the investigation file.

Ethan took the documents, tapping his fingers rhythmically on the desk. While the surface evidence appeared flawless, his instincts told him there was more to this.

"Dismissed."

Once alone, Ethan massaged his temples. The mountain of paperwork on his desk suddenly felt unbearable. He couldn't focus on a single word.

His phone vibrated abruptly. The call came from the subordinate assigned to escort Sophia abroad.

"Sir, we have a situation." The voice sounded urgent. "Ms. Evans collapsed at the airport."

Ethan shot to his feet. "What happened?"

"The doctor says it's sudden hypoglycemia."

"Take her back to the hospital." Ethan's voice turned grim. His gaze fell on the calendar—Vivian's promised assistance remained pending, and now this complication with Sophia.

Ending the call, he stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the city lights. His reflection showed deeply creased brows.

Meanwhile, Vivian had just completed an eight-hour surgery. Leaning against the locker room wall, she closed her eyes to rest.

The ringing phone shattered the silence. Isabella Langley.

"Viv!" Isabella's furious voice crackled through. "That bitch Sophia is at it again!"

Vivian chuckled. "What now?"

"Those paid trolls are spreading blatant lies online! Despite concrete evidence, they're whitewashing her crimes." Isabella sounded ready to explode. "I can't swallow this!"

"Patience." Vivian changed out of her scrubs. "The fox will show its tail eventually."

"By the way, have you checked the Dark Web lately?" Isabella suddenly lowered her voice.

"No time. Why?"

"There's a one-million-dollar bounty on your head!"

Vivian paused. "One million?" She burst out laughing. "That's all I'm worth?"

"The point is someone wants you dead!" Isabella practically stomped through the phone. "Should we investigate?"

Buttoning her shirt, Vivian met her own sharp gaze in the mirror. "Unnecessary. I'd like to see who dares take this contract."

Memories surfaced—of exorbitant Dark Web contracts she'd once accepted as Nightingale, the top assassin in her former organization.

How was Zero doing now? The thought flickered and died instantly. Any connection to her past could be lethal.

"Viv, are you serious?" Isabella's voice snapped her back.

"Dead serious." Vivian grabbed her car keys. "Good exercise."

Hanging up, she exited the hospital. In the darkness, her trained senses detected multiple watching eyes. A smirk curled her lips as she deliberately slowed her pace.

Come on. Let's see who's foolish enough to try.
###Chapter 119

Sophia Evans's condition suddenly worsened, forcing her to postpone her overseas trip. Ethan Roscente arranged for her VIP hospital suite but rarely visited.

Every time she called, his assistant Simon Eisner politely declined with "Mr. Roscente is in a meeting."

Victoria Roscente arrived with a fruit basket, fuming as she entered. "My brother is being ridiculous! You bore his child, yet he won't even let you through the Roscente family gates!"

She only knew Sophia loved Ethan deeply, unaware of the truth behind their relationship. When Sophia suddenly left the country years ago and secretly gave birth, Victoria naturally assumed the child was Ethan's.

"Don't say that." Sophia coughed weakly. "I'm just a burden. Ethan has done enough for me these years."

"But what right does that AN woman have?" Victoria clenched her teeth. "Sharing a name with that ugly Vivian Laurent makes me sick!"

A cold glint flashed in Sophia's eyes. "She won't live past tonight."

"Really?"

"The Dark Web assassin has accepted the contract." Sophia gently touched her IV tube. "Soon, AN will cease to exist."

Victoria's fists tightened excitedly. "Perfect! With her gone, I'll be the undisputed queen of perfumery!"

...

Under cover of night, the assassin infiltrated the villa undetected.

He'd taken the lowest-tier contract—no method specified, only death required. Simple jobs like this paid handsomely.

In the bedroom, Vivian Laurent appeared to be sound asleep.

The assassin withdrew a syringe, its needle glinting coldly in the moonlight. He crept toward the bed, raising the needle—

His wrist suddenly went numb!

Before he could react, the needle now pressed against his own throat.

"Who sent you?" Vivian's voice cut like ice.

The assassin froze. That syringe contained lethal poison—one slip meant instant death.

"I-I'll talk..." His Adam's apple bobbed nervously. "It was... Ms. Evans..."
###Chapter 120

The woman's voice cut through the darkness like a razor.

"Did you consider the consequences when you decided to kill me?"

The assassin shuddered. "You knew I was coming?"

Impossible. This was a private contract from the Dark Web—a place ordinary people couldn't access.

"A million dollars? That's all my life is worth?" Vivian Laurent chuckled.

Cold sweat drenched the assassin's back. She even knew the payment amount.

"Spare... spare me..."

"Do you know where the last person who tried to kill me is now?" Vivian's tone was glacial.

"Who?"

"Sophia Evans. Still lying in the ICU." Her voice was merciless. "I don't let assassins walk away."

The assassin discreetly pulled out knockout powder and flung it at her.

Vivian sidestepped. Seizing the chance, he yanked a needle from his collar and bolted.

She didn't give chase.

The villa's lights suddenly blazed to life. The assassin reached the staircase—only to slip on the oil Isabella Langley had poured. He tumbled down the steps.

"This is your skill level?" Isabella doubled over laughing.

With a broken leg, the assassin was swiftly tied up.

"Who the hell are you people?" he snarled.

Isabella pointed at Vivian descending the stairs. "She's your mentor's mentor."

Confusion twisted his face.

Vivian looked down at him. "Did the Dark Web lower their recruitment standards?"

"I—I've never failed before!" he spat.

"Which organization sent you?"

"None."

"Let him go," Vivian said abruptly.

Everyone froze.

"Viv!" Isabella protested. "He tried to kill you!"

"He's useful alive." Her tone left no room for argument.

Lucas Lefèvre suggested, "Should I have him tailed?"

"Unnecessary." Vivian was certain. "His injuries will slow him down."

She had anticipated this. Deliberately leaking her location online, she'd set a trap. When Isabella and the others spread oil on the stairs, she'd thought it overkill.

Turns out, it came in handy.
###Chapter 121

The emergency call came in the dead of night.

Vivian Laurent had just bid farewell to Isabella Langley when Daniel Ashcroft's name flashed across her phone screen.

"Vivian, we have a critical patient who fell down the stairs. Get to the hospital now!" Daniel's voice brooked no argument.

A 2:30 AM summons.

Vivian smirked. Daniel never missed a chance to make her life difficult.

"Where are the on-duty doctors?"

"Swamped! No more questions—move it!"

The roar of an engine split the silence.

Vivian threw on her lab coat and rushed to the ward, only to collide with Ryan Fairsprene in the hallway.

"You?" Ryan's eyes widened. "Daniel's clearly setting you up."

Vivian shrugged. "Doesn't matter. Where's the patient?"

A pained groan echoed from the room.

That voice sounded oddly familiar.

Vivian pushed the door open, scanning the medical report. "Fractured right leg, dislocated left arm, two broken ribs."

The patient froze.

"Dr... Dr. Luna?!"

Finn Deross's eyes bulged, his hospital gown drenched in cold sweat.

Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine his assassination target would be his attending physician.

"What a coincidence." Vivian arched a brow, tapping the clipboard with her fingers.

Finn struggled to sit up. "I don't need treatment!"

"Fine." Vivian smiled. "Crawl out, then."

Ryan glanced between them. "You two know each other?"

"Finn Deross." Vivian read from the chart. "Twenty-five. Freelancer."

Finn turned ghostly pale.

Having his identity as a Dark Web assassin exposed by his target was worse than mission failure.

"Spare me, Dr. Luna! I swear I'll quit!" His voice trembled.

Ryan tactfully exited the room.

Vivian leisurely pulled on surgical gloves.

Finn's pupils contracted as she approached.

"Stay... stay back!"

A sharp crack of bone resetting echoed through the ward, followed by a scream.
###Chapter 122

Finn Deross braced himself for a beating.

To his surprise, the woman simply reset his dislocated arm with brutal efficiency.

The excruciating pain faded, and his limb became functional again.

Vivian Laurent crouched down expressionlessly. With a sharp crack, she realigned his misaligned leg bone.

"Who are you?" Finn demanded, staring at her.

"Your grandmaster." Vivian dusted off her hands as she stood. "Consider this a free lesson."

She turned and strode from the hospital room, her retreating figure radiating effortless confidence.

Finn frowned thoughtfully. That title... could she be a legend from the Dark Web?

He pulled up Vivian's profile again. This time, he noticed the address was suspiciously detailed—down to the exact room number.

This was clearly deliberate.

......

Victoria Roscente waited two full days.

No news of Vivian's death arrived.

She stormed into Sophia Evans' hospital room. "Your assassin failed? How is that woman still breathing?"

"The contractor's gone dark." Sophia twisted her hospital gown nervously.

"A professional couldn't kill her?" Victoria stamped her foot. "That bitch has nine lives!"

Sophia's fingers plucked at the sheets. "Ethan hasn't visited me in days."

Ever since Vivian appeared, Ethan Roscente's attention had dwindled to nothing.

"I remember Ethan mentioning Vivian works at a hospital." Victoria's eyes lit up. "Let's pay her a visit."

Sophia located Vivian's workplace and decided to book an appointment as a patient.

She reached for a surgical mask and hat—until Victoria's comment froze her mid-motion.

"You look exactly like the woman who tampered with those brakes on the security footage."

Sophia's hat slipped from trembling fingers.

"That wasn't me!" Her voice shook. "You believe me, right?"

"Of course." Victoria patted her shoulder. "Just an unfortunate resemblance."

At the hospital, they discovered Vivian's appointments were fully booked.

Worse, the waiting area buzzed with glowing praise.

"Dr. Laurent is miraculous! She cured my chronic condition with three prescriptions."

"After her acupuncture, my paralyzed leg could move again!"

Sophia's unease grew. Was Vivian truly this skilled?

She offered a patient cash to surrender their spot—only for the nurse to refuse.

"Dr. Laurent's orders: no appointments for Sophia Evans."

Victoria exploded. "Who does she think she is? Some two-bit doctor playing diva?"

Glaring patients surrounded them instantly.

"Who's this lunatic? Dr. Laurent is a miracle worker!"

"Isn't that celebrity Sophia Evans? Disgraceful behavior for a star."

"If our hospital's beneath you, feel free to leave!"
###Chapter 123

Victoria Roscente's face flushed crimson.

She had never been publicly humiliated like this in her entire privileged life.

"Bunch of ignorant peasants!" she shrieked back.

The crowd erupted instantly.

"Everyone look! The celebrity is bullying ordinary people!"

"Throwing tantrums when she can't get an appointment—how classy!"

"Record this and post it online!"

Sophia Evans turned pale and urgently pulled Victoria's arm. "Victoria, let's go!"

They scrambled through the jeering crowd in disgrace.

Victoria trembled with rage. "These lowlifes deserve to be wiped off the earth!"

"Don't stoop to their level," Sophia soothed. "Just poor nobodies who've never seen the real world."

Victoria gritted her teeth. "What kind of spell has Vivian cast on them?"

"Poor people are easily bought," Sophia smirked. "They'll wag their tails for crumbs."

"So we just let this slide?"

"Of course not." Sophia lowered her voice. "I discovered Vivian has an enemy here—Dr. Daniel Ashcroft."

She whispered into Victoria's ear.

Victoria's eyes lit up. "Perfect."

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente was reviewing documents in his office.

His phone vibrated.

"Sir, Miss Victoria and Miss Sophia caused a scene at the hospital."

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

He immediately dialed Victoria's number.

"It's Ethan!" Victoria panicked, looking at Sophia.

"Don't answer," Sophia stopped her hand. "We were just patients seeking treatment."

They stormed straight to Vivian's consultation room.

The door slammed open violently.

The current patient jumped in fright.

"Dr. Luna has quite the attitude!" Victoria screeched.

Vivian didn't glance up. "Get out."

"Who do you think you are?" Victoria marched forward. "How dare you refuse to treat Sophia?"

The patient asked nervously, "Dr. Laurent, should I call security?"

"Go ahead!" Victoria sneered. "Let everyone see this homewrecker's true colors!"

She turned toward the hallway and shouted, "This woman seduced my brother and destroyed relationships!"

Vivian finally looked up.

The corner of her lips curved slightly.

What an imaginative script.

She almost wanted to applaud the performance—if only she weren't the unwilling protagonist.
###Chapter 124

Sunlight filtered through the blinds into the examination room as Vivian Laurent organized patient files.

The sharp click of high heels echoed outside the door.

Victoria Roscente barged in with Sophia Evans in tow, followed by a bewildered patient.

"Dr. Laurent, I heard you specialize in stealing other women's fiancés?" Victoria's loud voice drew curious glances from patients in the hallway.

Sophia tugged at Victoria's sleeve. "Don't say that. I'm sure Dr. Laurent isn't that kind of person."

She turned to the patient with an apologetic smile. "Would you mind stepping out for a moment?"

The patient scurried out gratefully.

Vivian set down her fountain pen and lifted cold eyes. "The psychiatry department is on the fifth floor. I suggest you go straight there."

As Victoria bristled, Sophia intervened.

Sophia approached Vivian's desk, her eyes reddening. "Dr. Laurent, I know you misunderstood what happened at the racetrack. But Ethan and I truly love each other. Please let us be happy."

Vivian's fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk.

"First, I have zero interest in Ethan Roscente. Second, get out now."

"Why so defensive?" Sophia's voice quivered with fake tears. "Being the other woman is immoral—"

Vivian shot to her feet, her lab coat brushing the desk edge.

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

"Shall I remind you how you climbed your way up, Miss Evans?"

She pointed at the door. "Out."

As Vivian raised her hand, Sophia suddenly collapsed to the floor.

"Ah!" Victoria shrieked. "The doctor attacked her!"

Victoria then delivered a sharp slap to her own face, the sound reverberating through the room.

"Vivian Laurent! How dare you!"

Vivian's lips twitched at the sight of Victoria's rapidly reddening cheek.

Victoria rushed to the door and flung it open.

"Everyone look! The doctor assaulted a patient!"

Patients crowded the hallway, whispering among themselves.

Sophia weakly tried to rise before dramatically collapsing again.

Daniel Ashcroft appeared at the perfect moment. "What's going on here?"

"Director Ashcroft!" Victoria pointed at her cheek. "Is this your hospital's standard of conduct?"

Daniel's eyes gleamed. "Vivian, you actually struck a patient? This hospital won't tolerate such disgraceful behavior!"

He raised his voice. "You're fired!"

Camera flashes erupted as onlookers began recording.
###Chapter 125

Victoria Roscente shrieked in agreement. "Exactly! Someone like you doesn't deserve to be a doctor!"

Vivian Laurent's lips curled into a cold smile. "Daniel Ashcroft, you've orchestrated this little performance quite well to get rid of me."

"How dare you make such accusations?" Daniel's eyes darted nervously. "You violated hospital protocols first, and we have solid evidence of you assaulting a patient. If they press charges, you'll lose your medical license!"

"Oh?" Vivian adjusted her lab coat leisurely. "How convenient that you barged in right after I finished examining the patient. Your timing is suspicious, to say the least."

Daniel pointed at the wailing woman on the floor. "She's clearly injured from your attack. How can you deny it?"

The absence of surveillance cameras in the examination room gave Daniel confidence. Today, he would ruin Vivian's reputation completely.

Vivian glanced at the woman. "If I had really hit her, she'd be in the ICU by now."

Victoria jumped forward. "Vivian! We demand a medical examination!"

"Vivian, you're fired!" Daniel barked. "Get out of this hospital immediately!"

He planned to claim later that Vivian had resigned voluntarily.

Vivian chuckled. "Fire me? You don't have that authority."

As the hospital's consultant specialist, her employment status wasn't something Daniel could influence.

Daniel's face darkened. Even his uncle, the vice president, couldn't touch this woman.

Victoria burned with jealousy. This woman wasn't just the founder of AN Atelier but also a medical expert. How could she be so accomplished?

What infuriated Victoria more was that Vivian reminded her of that disfigured Vivian from the banquet. The humiliation still made her teeth grind.

"Evidence?" Vivian suddenly stepped closer to Victoria, her icy smile sending chills down spines. "You keep accusing me of assault. Where's your proof?"
###Chapter 126

Victoria Roscente lifted her chin, her voice shrill. "I saw you push Sophia with my own eyes!"

Vivian Laurent kept her hands in her lab coat pockets, her gaze icy.

She hadn't even touched a single thread of Sophia's clothing.

Victoria pointed at her swollen cheek. "And this slap mark? You did this!"

"Think you're so great, Dr. Laurent? Resorting to violence when you can't win an argument?"

"We came here seeking medical help, and this is how you treat patients?"

The sharp click of dress shoes echoed from the end of the hallway.

"Victoria."

The name pierced Victoria's spine like an icicle.

Her body stiffened, her arrogance vanishing instantly.

Ethan Roscente's tall figure appeared around the corner.

Sophia remained collapsed on the floor, summoning tears on command. "Ethan... my leg hurts so much..."

She extended a trembling hand, her face streaked with tears.

Ethan didn't even glance at her, his eyes locked on Victoria. "Explain."

"Brother!" Victoria's voice shook. "We came for treatment!"

"Vivian deliberately refused to register Sophia!"

"We just wanted an explanation, and she attacked us!"

Her accusations grew more animated, as if she'd witnessed every detail.

Vivian suddenly smiled. "Proof?"

"Think you're a walking surveillance camera?"

Victoria jutted her chin out. "Exam rooms don't have cameras!"

"Who told you that?" Vivian leisurely pulled out her phone.

Both Victoria and Sophia paled instantly.

They'd specifically confirmed this hospital prohibited cameras in exam rooms.

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

If there really was footage...

Not only would their scheme fail, but they'd be caught red-handed.

Victoria forced composure. "Y-you installing cameras illegally violates patient privacy—"

"Shall I play the footage for everyone?" Vivian interrupted.

Her thumb hovered over the phone screen.
###Chapter 127

Victoria Roscente stood at the clinic doorway, her voice shrill and piercing. "Hospitals strictly prohibit surveillance cameras in examination rooms! Dr. Laurent is blatantly violating regulations! Who knows how many patients' privacy she's secretly recorded? How can you allow such an unethical doctor to practice?"

"Victoria!" Ethan Roscente's voice cut through the air like a whip. "Haven't you learned your lesson from last time?"

His brows furrowed in frustration. His cousin was becoming increasingly outrageous, tarnishing the Roscente family name. The Victoria he knew used to be willful but knew her limits—now she was behaving like a vulgar shrew.

"Did I say anything wrong?" Victoria lifted her chin defiantly.

"Ethan..." Sophia Evans suddenly clutched his sleeve with trembling fingers, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "My ankle hurts so much... She pushed me earlier, and now I can't stand at all..."

Her pale face tilted upward, the picture of fragile vulnerability.

Ethan bent down to help her up. "Let's get you off the floor first."

"Carry me?" Sophia extended her arms like a child. "I really can't move..."

After a brief hesitation, Ethan scooped her up and gently deposited her onto a nearby chair.

Vivian Laurent observed the scene with cold detachment before letting out a soft, mocking laugh.

The sound made Ethan pause mid-motion, his gaze involuntarily darting to Vivian.

"How dare you laugh, Vivian!" Victoria immediately screeched. "You're the one who hurt Sophia! Director Ashcroft already said you're fired—pack your things and get out!"

Vivian's sharp eyes pinned Victoria in place. "If you weren't colluding, how would you know he's the director?"

"I—" Victoria faltered, then pointed at Daniel Ashcroft's name tag. "It's right here! Director Ashcroft!"

"I told you, he has no authority to fire me." Vivian calmly walked to the examination table and retrieved her phone from its stand. "Besides, I have proof of your little performance."

Only then did Sophia and Victoria notice the phone mount, their faces draining of color.

Had Vivian been recording this whole time?

Vivian tapped the stop button and waved the phone. "Apologies, but with such aggressive visitors, I thought it prudent to document everything. The footage clearly shows who pushed whom."

She played the video. Victoria's venomous voice immediately spilled from the speakers.

The recording showed Vivian merely raising her hand to shoo them away—never touching Sophia. Yet Sophia had collapsed as if struck by an invisible force.

The most ridiculous moment came when Victoria dramatically slapped her own face while screaming that Vivian had assaulted her.

Confronted with irrefutable evidence, Sophia turned ashen.

Victoria stood frozen, utterly dumbstruck. She never anticipated Vivian's countermove. Assuming the clinic's lack of surveillance gave her free rein, she'd instead trapped herself in her own web of lies.
###Chapter 128

The surveillance footage froze on the exact moment Ethan Roscente pushed open the door.

Vivian Laurent pocketed her phone, her gaze sweeping over the two women before her.

"I never touched you, yet you claim I pushed you down. I didn't lay a finger on anyone, yet you accuse me of assault." Her voice remained calm. "We're complete strangers. Why frame me like this?"

Patients gathered outside the examination room began murmuring.

"Dr. Laurent is an excellent physician. What's your problem?"

"I was just inside getting treated. These two barged in without appointments and started yelling."

"Is this how celebrities behave? Let's film this and let the internet decide!"

Victoria Roscente flushed with anger. "Stop recording! All of you, stop right now!"

She turned to Ethan with pleading eyes. "Brother, look at them—"

"Enough!" Ethan's voice cut through the air like ice.

Victoria immediately fell silent.

Their plan had spiraled out of control.

They'd intended to provoke Vivian into violence, or at least fabricate evidence of her attacking them. Daniel Ashcroft had promised to have Vivian fired once the news spread.

But Vivian remained composed throughout, turning the tables on them instead.

"This is Vivian's setup! She's violating our privacy rights by recording us!" Victoria protested weakly.

Vivian held up her phone. "Self-defense. If you've done nothing wrong, this footage can be deleted anytime."

She met Ethan's gaze. "Mr. Roscente, how should we handle this?"

"Victoria, apologize." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.

Victoria gaped. "Brother! Sophia got hurt! Aren't you even concerned about her?"

Ethan fixed Sophia Evans with a piercing stare. "Who put you up to this?"

Sophia's eyes welled with tears. "Ethan, I wasn't faking... Maybe I just got startled and fell..."

"Apologize." Ethan repeated.

Biting her lip, Sophia turned to Vivian. "Dr. Laurent, this was all my fault. Victoria's still young and impulsive. Please be merciful..."

Before she could finish, the examination room door burst open.

Daniel Ashcroft stormed in with security guards. "Vivian Laurent! You're suspended effective immediately pending investigation for assaulting patients!"
###Chapter 129

Sophia Evans' apology dripped with venom, every word laced with insinuations against Vivian Laurent.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. She recognized this manipulative tactic all too well.

"Stop playing the victim," she scoffed. "Your coordinated act was flawless. Without my recording, I'd never clear my name today."

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Admit it. You conspired with Daniel Ashcroft."

"Absolutely not!" Sophia denied vehemently.

"The racetrack surveillance was unclear, but hospital cameras don't lie." Vivian advanced step by step. "Shall we check your communication records with Daniel?"

She welcomed the escalation. Her conscience was clean.

Sophia bit her lower lip. Ethan Roscente immediately ordered the surveillance footage pulled.

Victoria Roscente panicked. Sophia shot her a reassuring glance.

The footage clearly showed both women entering Daniel's office.

"Explain." Ethan's voice turned glacial.

"We only consulted about medical conditions." Sophia's eyes welled up with practiced tears. "Dr. Ashcroft praised Vivian's skills and suggested we see her."

She discreetly passed her phone to Victoria.

"Victoria recognized Vivian as Dr. AN and remembered their past conflict." Sophia's tears fell like an Oscar-worthy performance.

Suddenly, Sophia dropped to her knees before Vivian.

"Dr. Laurent, we beg your forgiveness." Her voice trembled theatrically. "Please show mercy."

"Sophia!" Victoria feigned concern, reaching to help her up. "You're unwell. Get up!"

Vivian looked down at the kneeling celebrity.

"A superstar kneeling before me?" Her lips twisted in amusement. "This deserves savoring."

She'd noticed Victoria holding the phone earlier.

"Willing to sacrifice dignity just to frame me?" Vivian's laugh held contempt. "Even Natalie Valois had more self-respect."
###Chapter 130

Vivian swiftly snatched the phone from Victoria's hand.

The screen clearly displayed an ongoing recording.

Sophia had intended to capture footage and later edit it to fabricate evidence of Vivian forcing her to kneel.

Given Sophia's online influence, this manipulated video would undoubtedly sway public opinion in her favor once released.

"What exactly are you trying to do, Miss Evans? Shall I livestream this and let everyone witness your kneeling performance?"

"Vivian, don't push too far!" Victoria reached out to help Sophia up.

She turned to Ethan for support. "Brother, are you just going to stand by while Sophia gets bullied?"

Sophia weakly shook her head. "Don't blame your brother... It's all my fault..."

Before she could finish, she suddenly clutched her forehead and swayed unsteadily.

The next second, Sophia's eyes fluttered shut as she collapsed limply to the floor.

"Brother! She's fainted from distress! Call a doctor!"

Sophia's tactic was clever—it ended the confrontation while painting her as the victim.

Daniel cowered in the corner, afraid to draw Vivian's attention.

This plan had failed again, but he silently vowed to find another way to drive Vivian out of the hospital.

Daniel quickly summoned medical staff to carry Sophia away for examination, with Victoria following closely behind.

Only Vivian and Ethan remained in the examination room.

"Aren't you going to check on your girlfriend, Mr. Roscente? She just passed out."

"She's not my girlfriend. We don't have that kind of relationship."

Vivian smirked coldly. "Your family is truly amusing. Do you really think I'd be interested in you? Do I seem that desperate?"

Ethan was momentarily speechless.

He considered himself exceptional in every aspect, yet Vivian had never once regarded him with genuine interest.

"Vivian, I admit Victoria and Sophia were wrong. Name your terms."

"I only have one demand—stay away from me!"

Did these people think she had nothing better to do than deal with their constant provocations?

"I'll arrange for Sophia to go abroad soon and ensure Victoria stops bothering you. Any other requests?"

"Let's talk after you've actually done it."

"I apologize for the trouble." Ethan lowered his voice.

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "The great Ethan Roscente actually knows how to apologize?"

She remembered Ethan always carrying himself with arrogance, never yielding to anyone in business matters.

Ethan saw nothing wrong with apologizing. "They made a mistake. An apology is warranted."

"Are they incapable of speaking for themselves? Why must you apologize on their behalf? Though I am curious about one thing."

"What?"

"If I hadn't recorded earlier, would you have believed Sophia's claim that I pushed her, or my denial?"

Silence stretched between them.

Vivian laughed mockingly at herself. What had she been expecting?

Ethan and Victoria were siblings, and Sophia was his first love. The answer was obvious.

"Never mind. I won't put you on the spot."

Just as Vivian turned to leave, Ethan suddenly spoke.

"I would have believed you."
###Chapter 131

Vivian froze.

His answer completely caught her off guard.

Ethan actually believed her?

Was it genuine, or just empty words to persuade her to keep treating Sophia?

"You'll stoop to any lengths to make me save her, won't you, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan heard the sarcasm in her voice.

But his declaration of trust had been sincere.

"Though we haven't known each other long, I understand your character."

"Oh?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Enlighten me then. What kind of person am I?"

She was genuinely curious how this man perceived her.

Ethan's gaze remained steady. "You're exceptionally capable—mastering every field effortlessly. With your principles, petty schemes are beneath you. If you truly wanted Sophia gone, she'd be in the ICU right now."

Vivian blinked.

Was that last part supposed to be a compliment or an insult?

"You don't resort to underhanded tactics because you operate with integrity. More importantly, you respect that white coat. The only blood you'd stain it with would be from saving lives."

His words struck a chord.

Her medical oath was precisely what had restrained her.

This coat could bear the stains of surgery, never the taint of personal vendettas.

She hadn't expected Ethan to recognize that.

Meeting his fathomless eyes, her heartbeat stuttered.

She quickly looked away. "Do you believe that girl was behind the racetrack incident too?"

"Uncertain," Ethan gave an ambiguous reply.

Current evidence cleared Sophia of involvement.

Vivian smirked coldly. "Better hope it wasn't her. If I find proof or she tries framing me again, I'll personally escort her to prison."

"She..." Ethan hesitated.

"I'll send her abroad soon. She won't trouble you further."

This decision surprised Vivian.

"I'll visit her when I have time, as promised. But not now."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

He'd hoped for another race with Vivian, but that chance seemed lost. This might be their final interaction.

With difficulty, he forced out, "Understood..."

The word left an anvil on his chest.

Vivian scoffed and returned to her examination chair.

"Stop cluttering my workspace if you have nothing useful to say." She called toward the door, "Next patient, please!"

As the patient entered, Vivian immediately focused on her work.

Ethan had no choice but to leave.

Closing the door, he glanced back one last time.

The woman immersed in her duties showed no trace of their earlier conversation.

Rubbing his temples, Ethan knew one thing for certain—Sophia needed to leave immediately.

News spread fast. Nathan and Ryan rushed over.

Only after confirming Vivian's safety did they relax.

Nathan wore a guilty expression. "This is all my fault."

"Don't be ridiculous. How is this your responsibility?"

"If I hadn't asked you to come to the hospital, none of this would've happened."

Vivian shook her head. "I enjoy working here. Sophia would've come after me regardless. As for Daniel Ashcroft..." Her eyes hardened. "I'll have a word with the Dean myself."
###Chapter 132

Vivian Laurent knocked on the door of Dean Remetio's office.

She reported Daniel Ashcroft's misconduct in detail. As a doctor, she only wanted to focus on treating patients, not waste time on petty workplace politics.

The dean's stance was clear. "Don't worry, Dr. Laurent. I'll speak with Daniel immediately. If the investigation confirms his involvement in framing you, the hospital will take severe disciplinary action."

Dean Remetio held the renowned Dr. Luna in high regard. Since Vivian's arrival, the hospital's reputation had skyrocketed. Though her true identity remained undisclosed, her medical expertise had already made waves in the capital's medical community.

Patients flocked daily to secure appointments with her. Invitations from prestigious medical forums piled up like snowflakes, all of which she politely declined.

"I appreciate your support, Dean." Vivian gave a slight nod.

"Not at all," the dean waved his hand. "By the way, the cardiology department has two complex cases. Their chief requested your consultation when you have time."

"Certainly."

Meanwhile, Daniel Ashcroft was summoned to the dean's office. His expression darkened upon learning Vivian was involved.

"Dean, I know you favor Vivian Laurent," Daniel said stiffly. "But as deputy chief of General Surgery with years of service here, don't I have the authority to manage my subordinates?"

Backed by his uncle VP Casstevensa, he spoke without restraint.

"Dr. Laurent is a consultant specialist outside your jurisdiction," the dean replied coldly. "Even if she made mistakes, discipline isn't your responsibility."

"What's her background?" Daniel pressed. "Isn't your favoritism unfair to other doctors?"

"If you possessed half her surgical skills, you'd receive the same treatment."

Daniel fell silent. In under two months, Vivian had performed numerous complex surgeries, setting multiple hospital records. Her patients had become devoted admirers.

"Understood?"

"Yes."

Exiting the office, Daniel clenched his teeth in fury. He vowed silently to drive that meddlesome woman out of the hospital.

...

In a standard ward, Sophia Evans lay in bed while Victoria Roscente watched over her with concern.

"Ethan!" Victoria complained when Ethan Roscente entered. "You have no idea how arrogant Vivian is! That gold-digging vixen is clearly after our family's—"

"Whose idea was this today?" Ethan cut her off sharply.
###Chapter 133

"We're just here for a check-up. What scheme could we possibly have?" Victoria Roscente protested with a stiff neck, but her eyes darted nervously.

Ethan Roscente let out a cold laugh. "Do you take me for a fool?"

Victoria clenched the hem of her dress. "Brother, Vivian went too far this time. Look what she did to Sophia."

"Sophia's study abroad plan is final. You're welcome to join her if you miss her so much." Ethan's voice was glacial.

Victoria immediately fell silent. Being exiled overseas was the last thing she wanted.

In the hospital bed, Sophia Evans' eyelashes fluttered faintly. She had heard every word, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

It didn't matter. She still had an ace up her sleeve.

That child was her ultimate bargaining chip.

"Ethan..." She opened her eyes weakly, voice trembling with tears. "My foot hurts so much..."

"The scans show nothing wrong." Ethan remained impassive. "Theo's been asking for you. Go see him."

Victoria took the hint and slipped out of the room.

As the door clicked shut, Sophia's tears spilled over. "Ethan, I really just came for treatment. Dr. Laurent hates me, I know..."

She lifted her tear-streaked face. "In my whole life, only Alexander ever truly cared for me. If he were still here—"

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

Alexander Roscente. His illegitimate half-brother. That unacknowledged name was his deepest wound.

Sophia's tears fell harder. "I know you find me repulsive. I'll leave."

She suddenly grabbed Ethan's hand. "But my feelings for you are real! I used to love Alexander, but now—"

"Enough!" Ethan wrenched his hand away.

"Then tell me," Sophia choked out between sobs, "what about Vivian? Do you love her?"

Ethan's breath hitched.

"No." The word left his lips before he could stop it.

Even he wasn't sure if it was the truth.
###Chapter 134

Sophia Evans wiped the tears from the corner of her eye, her fingers trembling slightly.

"I understand, Ethan," she said softly. "I was too selfish. I caused you trouble."

She lifted her gaze, a faint light flickering in her eyes.

"I accept going abroad." She paused. "But can I stay one more day? Just one. Have dinner with me tomorrow night, please?"

She bit her lower lip, her fingers unconsciously twisting the edge of the hospital blanket.

"After dinner, I'll leave the next day," she added, her voice feather-light.

Ethan Roscente stood by the hospital bed, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Fine," he finally agreed. "I'll arrange a flight for the day after."

Sophia exhaled in relief, a faint smile touching her lips.

"Ethan," she suddenly said, "I want to go home. The hospital makes me uncomfortable."

Her lashes lowered.

"I've been in and out of hospitals since I was a child. The smell of disinfectant makes me sick."

Ethan turned to leave. "I'll handle the discharge paperwork."

"Wait!" Sophia called out urgently. "Where will I stay?"

"A hotel," Ethan replied without looking back. "Pick one."

Sophia's smile froze.

She took a deep breath, forcing her voice to remain steady. "It's just two nights. A hotel is too much trouble. Why don't I..."

She hesitated, then ventured carefully, "Why don't I stay at the Roscente Family Estate? The staff can take care of me."

The Roscente Family Estate was the ancestral home, located in the most prestigious district of the city.

"A hotel is more convenient," Ethan said coldly.

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"Why?" Her voice trembled. "That woman stayed there before. Why can't I?"

Ethan frowned, recalling his ex-wife's brief stay.

"That was different," he answered curtly.

Sophia's heart sank.

She forced a smile. "You're protecting her. Who is she?"

"None of your concern." Ethan turned to leave again.

Sophia suddenly grabbed his wrist.

Ethan pulled his hand away smoothly, effortlessly breaking her grip.

"About dinner tomorrow," Sophia pressed, swallowing her disappointment. "You promised?"

"Yes." Ethan nodded and strode out of the room.

The moment the door closed, Sophia's gentle facade vanished.

Her eyes darkened as she stared at the door.

Tomorrow, she would have Ethan Roscente.

No matter the cost.
###Chapter 135

Vivian Laurent adjusted the collar of her lab coat as she stepped out of the dean's office.

A line of patients still waited for her at the outpatient clinic.

Nathan Clementson had been lingering in the hallway. He approached immediately.

"Need to rest in your office? I can cover your afternoon shift."

"I'm fine, Nathan." She shook her head. "Heard your surgery schedule is packed this week. Don't overwork yourself."

Guilt shadowed his face. He'd been the one to call her to the hospital, only for everything to spiral out of control.

Reading his expression, Vivian sighed. "Alright then. Thanks for covering."

She stood on tiptoes to pat his shoulder. "Don't worry. I always pay back what's owed to me."

"You'll always be the little sister I need to protect." Nathan ruffled her hair affectionately.

Vivian laughed. "You're the best!"

She turned toward the cardiac center. A challenging case awaited—one even seasoned specialists hesitated to operate on.

After examining the patient, Vivian felt confident. The surgery would be difficult, but manageable.

However, the patient's current condition required two more days of stabilization before proceeding.

She'd barely settled at her desk when a nurse knocked.

"Dr. Laurent, Mr. Deross is complaining about wound pain. He requested to see you."

Grabbing her medical kit, Vivian wondered what scheme Finn was plotting this time.

At a corridor intersection, she froze.

Ethan Roscente was helping Sophia Evans out of a patient room. The actress clung to him, a saccharine smile plastered across her face.

Vivian's grip tightened on the kit strap.

Noticing Vivian from the corner of her eye, Sophia suddenly stumbled.

"Ethan!" she cried, feigning a fall.

He frowned. "What's wrong?"

"I feel dizzy..." Sophia whimpered pitifully. "Could you carry me to the car?"

This performance was solely for Vivian's benefit—a blatant display of ownership.

"If you're unwell, you shouldn't be discharged." Ethan's voice remained cool.

"This illness... may be incurable." Tears welled in Sophia's eyes. "I don't want to spend my final days in a hospital bed..."

After a pause, Ethan swept her into his arms.

Sophia immediately looped her arms around his neck, flashing Vivian a triumphant smirk over his shoulder.

Ethan strode away without noticing Vivian standing in the shadows.

But Sophia knew. Vivian had seen everything.
###Chapter 136

Finn Deross gasped in pain on the hospital bed.

This mission had been a disaster. Not only did he fail to collect the commission, but he was also left severely injured. Worse, he'd missed two subsequent contracts with terrifyingly high penalty fees.

He'd wanted to prove himself to Dominic Atlante. Now? He'd probably become the laughingstock of the entire mafia family.

When Vivian Laurent entered the room, Finn instantly masked his agony with an ingratiating smile.

"Master, you're finally here."

Vivian approached without expression and began changing his bandages.

Her movements were rough. When she touched his fractured ribs, Finn howled.

"Could you be gentler?"

"Afraid of pain?" Vivian scoffed. "You didn't seem afraid when taking the contract."

"I'm human too!"

"Done." Vivian finished the dressing with clinical efficiency. "Don't call me unless it's urgent."

As she turned to leave, Finn grabbed her coat sleeve.

"Wait! You owe me!"

Vivian arched a brow. "Owe you?"

"I got injured at your place. That makes it your responsibility." His tone was shamelessly bold.

Vivian nearly laughed.

It reminded her of that thief who sued his victim after getting food poisoning from stolen goods.

"What do you want?"

Finn's eyes lit up. Over the past two days, he'd observed Vivian closely. This woman was anything but ordinary. In just weeks, she'd gained renown at the hospital and displayed uncanny knowledge of the Dark Web.

"I still have two unfinished contracts. In this condition, I can't complete them. The penalties would bankrupt me. Could you possibly—"

"Complete them for you?" Vivian cut him off.

"With your skills, it'd be effortless!"

Vivian turned away again.

Finn panicked. "If you refuse, I'll expose your identity on the Dark Web! Someone as capable as you hiding in a hospital? You must have secrets!"

Vivian froze.

"Blackmailing me?"

Finn shrank back slightly but held his ground. "Just stating facts. Help me this once, and I'll take your secrets to the grave."

Silence filled the room.

Finn watched Vivian's rigid back with bated breath.

Finally, she turned slowly, her lips curving into a dangerous smile.

"Tell me about these contracts."
###Chapter 137

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she stared at her phone screen.

Finn had actually outmaneuvered her.

"Master, please help me." Finn blinked like a begging puppy. "I've called you Master so many times. It's just two small tasks."

"You know the Dark Web rules better than I do." Vivian's expression remained icy.

Finn's shoulders slumped. "I know I messed up... If I hadn't taken your contract, I wouldn't have gotten hurt..."

Vivian massaged her temples.

Finn wasn't cut out for this line of work. In his early twenties, he acted impulsively and had a soft heart. After his last assassination mission failed, she'd discovered the kid had never even fired a gun.

"Show me the intel."

Finn's eyes lit up as he handed over the tablet.

The job was simple: gather evidence of a wealthy socialite's cheating husband. The target would be meeting his mistress tomorrow night at an elite private club.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. It had been too long since her last mission.

The next evening, Vivian infiltrated the club. The target had rented out the entire venue and required all staff to wear costumes. She was assigned a Bunny Girl outfit.

The black bodysuit clung to her curves. The bunny ears sat crookedly on her head. Worst of all was the fluffy tail attached to her backside.

Suppressing her discomfort, Vivian adjusted the micro camera hidden in her necklace.

Inside, the club was a den of debauchery. The target groped women shamelessly while downing drinks. Vivian moved through the crowd, capturing every compromising moment.

Just as she prepared to leave, a figure blocked her path.

"Hey bunny, have a drink with me?"

Chase Blanchet swayed drunkenly, his gaze crawling over her. The notorious playboy was tonight's host.

Vivian sidestepped him. "I'm working."

"Don't play hard to get." Chase grabbed her wrist. "You know whose turf this is?"

The club's strobe lights flickered across his greasy smile. Vivian spotted the target leading two women toward a private room.

Her lips curled. "Want to play, Chase? Then catch me if you can."

Before he could react, she stomped on his foot. As he yelped in pain, she slipped into the crowd like a fish through water.
###Chapter 138

Vivian felt nausea rising in her throat.

She just wanted to escape this situation quickly, not waste time with these people.

"Get lost."

"Don't be so cold. Have a drink with me?" Chase Blanchet's greedy eyes lingered on Vivian's exquisite face. The waitress was breathtakingly beautiful.

"One drink and I can leave?" Vivian glanced at the glass on the table.

Chase smiled suggestively. "You have my word."

He eagerly handed her the glass. Vivian lowered her lashes as she accepted it, her fingertips barely touching the rim.

An unusual scent mingled with the alcohol.

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Drinking alone is boring."

Chase seized the opportunity to grab her hand, his rough thumb stroking her skin. "This makes it more interesting."

"Am I beautiful?" Vivian suddenly looked up.

As Chase opened his mouth to answer, she gripped his chin.

The glass tilted, pouring cold liquid down his throat.

"You—!" He coughed violently but had already swallowed most of it.

"You're not worthy." Vivian released him with a disdainful look.

Chase's expression turned strangely euphoric. "Call me names again. I love it."

Vivian frowned.

Psychopath.

She turned to leave when an odd sensation hit her.

Heat spread through her body. Her skin burned.

She quickly checked her pulse. Her heartbeat raced abnormally.

"Feeling it now, wildcat?" Chase licked his lips.

"What did you do?" Vivian demanded sharply.

"Smell your hand." He smirked triumphantly.

A faint, elusive fragrance lingered on her skin.

Vivian's pupils constricted.

The drug was absorbed through contact!

She shoved Chase away, only to find herself surrounded by bodyguards.

"Grab her!"

Vivian smirked.

She'd grown rusty from inactivity. A fatal mistake.

Her fists and feet moved like wind. Attackers fell one after another.

Chase watched, mesmerized. "So feisty! Hold her down!"

More bodyguards swarmed in.

Vivian yanked off her bowtie. Her black hair cascaded like a waterfall.

Tonight, she'd teach these men the meaning of regret.
###Chapter 139

The drug surged violently through Vivian's veins, blurring her vision. She bit her tongue hard, the metallic taste of blood sharpening her focus.

"Don't move." She twisted Chase Blanchet's arm behind his back, pressing a blade to his throat. The steel glinted coldly under the lights.

Sweat dripped down Chase's temples. "Stay back!" he barked at his bodyguards.

They froze. Vivian dragged him toward the exit, then suddenly drove her knee upward with brutal precision.

A scream tore through the hallway. She slammed the door shut behind her, locking it with a swift click.

Her fingers trembled as she dialed 911. "Golden Bliss Club, third floor. Drug use in progress." After hanging up, she sent an encrypted video file.

Chaos erupted inside the club. Chase writhed on the floor, snarling, "Tear this place apart! Find her!"

He hadn't expected this seemingly fragile paparazzo to move like a trained operative. Nor had he anticipated the damning footage of powerful figures stored on her phone.

Sirens wailed in the distance. Vivian barely managed to grip the steering wheel as she sped away. The rearview mirror reflected her flushed face.

She had to make it home.

Crystal chandeliers bathed the penthouse suite in golden light. Sophia Evans lifted her wineglass, diamonds glinting on her manicured nails. "A toast before your flight tomorrow."

Ethan Roscente ignored the glass. He loosened his tie, his platinum cufflinks catching the light.

"Flight details confirmed?"

Sophia studied his razor-sharp profile. Five years, and the way his brow furrowed still made her pulse skip.

"Ethan." She reached for him, but he stepped back. Her fingertips grazed only the cold diamonds on his sleeve.

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, city lights cascaded like fallen stars. Sophia remembered that disastrous night. She should've been Mrs. Roscente by now.

But the spiked drink had ended up in her own brother's throat instead.
###Chapter 140

Ethan Roscente pushed open the door.

The dining table was lavishly set with exquisite dishes. He took his seat without hesitation.

"Let's eat."

Sophia Evans beamed with practiced charm. "I prepared all this specially for you. Tell me if it suits your taste."

His eyes skimmed over the elaborate spread, appetite absent.

A memory surfaced—three years ago, after the car accident. During his overseas recovery, that woman had cooked for him daily. Her culinary skills were exceptional.

Too bad it had been so long since he'd tasted her cooking.

Not since Vivian Laurent stunned everyone at the tycoon's birthday banquet with her Jade Gambling skills. His ex-wife had vanished from his radar since then. He wondered what she'd been up to.

"Ethan?"

Sophia's voice pulled him back.

"Nothing." He picked up his chopsticks.

She raised her wine glass. "Let's toast to celebrate."

The deep red liquid concealed secrets unknown to him.

"You're not well. Don't drink."

Her heart warmed at his concern. He still cared.

"Then I'll have juice." She poured herself a glass, lips curving in a hidden smile.

Tonight would be unforgettable. Beneath her coat, only a seductive camisole waited for the drugs to take effect.

"Thank you for always being so patient with me."

"Hmm."

"Oh, an international director is casting for a lead role. I'd love to audition..."

Her usual tactic. One nod from Ethan, and her agent would handle the rest.

"Talk to your agent."

Her smile faltered momentarily. Another reminder—all this privilege came only because of Alexander Roscente.

"Cheers." She forced a bright smile, lifting her glass.

Ethan drained his wine in one go.

Sophia watched his Adam's apple bob, pulse accelerating.

The plan had succeeded.
###Chapter 141

"Ethan, try this. I had the kitchen prepare it specially for you." Sophia Evans picked up a piece of fish with her chopsticks and placed it gently into Ethan Roscente's bowl.

Ethan frowned and pushed the bowl aside. "No, thanks."

Undeterred, Sophia continued, "I heard you've been doing exceptionally well with the overseas branch. Perhaps you should consider staying there longer?"

"The Roscente Group needs me here more."

Three years ago, he'd left for abroad—not just to expand the family empire, but to investigate his elder brother's mysterious car accident. Though all evidence pointed to an unfortunate mishap, Ethan had always suspected foul play.

But time had eroded any remaining leads.

Then there was Theo. His brother's premature child had been sickly and weak. It had taken Ethan three years of meticulous care to restore the boy's health.

Now, it was time to return.

"Theo keeps asking about you. He misses his uncle."

"I'll visit him soon."

Midway through dinner, Ethan suddenly felt an uncomfortable heat spreading through his body. He loosened his tie, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

Something was wrong.

"Sophia!" He slammed his hands on the table, his gaze sharp as a blade. "What did you do?"

"Ethan? What's wrong?" Sophia feigned concern, though triumph flickered in her eyes.

The drug was taking effect.

"You drugged me!" Ethan's vision swam red, his body burning from within. Only their shared history kept him from wrapping his hands around her throat.

"How could you accuse me? We ate the same food." Sophia gestured at their shared dishes, hiding a smirk. The real culprit had been his pre-poured glass of wine.

Seizing the opportunity, she threw her arms around his waist. "You're burning up. Let me take you to bed and care for you."

Through his dress shirt, she could feel the hard planes of his muscles and the feverish heat of his skin. The man she'd coveted for so long would finally be hers.
###Chapter 142

Ethan's knuckles turned white, veins bulging on the back of his hand. He shoved Sophia away with a hoarse growl. "Get out!"

Her coat slipped to the floor. The black camisole clung to her curves, pale skin glowing under the lights.

She lunged at him again, undeterred.

"Ethan, you're clearly suffering." Her fingers trailed down his dress shirt. "Let me help you."

His breathing grew ragged, but his gaze turned glacial.

Sophia rose on her tiptoes, lips parting. Just before contact, a powerful shove sent her sprawling.

"Ah!"

Ethan strode away without a backward glance.

Scrambling up with her strap slipping, she chased after him. "Ethan! You can't treat me like this!"

Whispers erupted down the hallway.

"Is that Sophia Evans?"
"Dressed like that... tsk tsk..."
"Quick, take a picture!"

By the time she reached the lobby, his sports car was already peeling away. She deliberately collapsed on the steps, wailing. "Ethan! I fell!"

The taillights vanished around the corner.

Her fists clenched until nails bit into palms. Her carefully laid plans—ruined.

"Why..." Tears splattered the marble. "What does she have that I don't?"

Camera flashes lit up her crumpled form. Too enraged to care, she pounded the ground.

This failure made the next attempt far more difficult.
###Chapter 143

The black sports car shot forward like an arrow released from its bow. Ethan Roscente gripped the steering wheel with one hand, his knuckles turning white. He tore off his tie, his Adam's apple bobbing as sweat beaded at his temples.

His blood felt like it was boiling. He rolled down the window, but the night air did nothing to cool the fire raging inside him.

The speedometer needle kept climbing. The scenery outside blurred into streaks of color. Only when the screech of brakes pierced the night did he realize he'd driven to Vivian Laurent's villa.

Moonlight glinted off the wrought iron gate. Ethan slammed his fist against the steering wheel, cursing his own recklessness. Then he saw her.

Those unmistakable bunny ears stood out in the darkness. Her slender legs shimmered beneath the short skirt as she stumbled toward the gate. Ethan's pupils contracted. His breath caught.

"Vivian?"

Before he could think, his drugged body moved on its own. Just as the gate was about to close, he shoved his arm against it.

"Help me..." The words scraped from his throat.

In the darkness, he grabbed her slender wrist and pinned her against the wall. Her skin burned against his palm. The woman in his arms trembled violently.

Vivian bit her lower lip until it bled. The metallic taste did nothing to quell the heat coursing through her veins. She tried to kick, but he easily restrained her.

"Are you drugged?" Ethan's voice was low. Only then did he notice her abnormally high body temperature.

Vivian answered with ragged breaths. Moonlight filtering through the curtains illuminated her flushed eyes. Those usually composed eyes now glistened with unshed tears.

The last thread of his restraint snapped.

Ethan cupped the back of her head and crushed his lips against hers. They both shuddered at the contact. The kiss tasted of blood, desperate and biting.

Vivian's fists pounded weakly against his shoulders. His burning hands slid down to her waist, fingers digging into the thin fabric of her clothes.

"Ethan..." Her broken whimper was swallowed by his mouth. She arched against him, helpless against the brutal kiss. His overwhelming presence surrounded her, leaving no room for refusal.

The bunny ears headband fell to the floor. With one hand, Ethan tore open his collar, revealing his heaving chest. He lifted her by the waist, forcing her to wrap her legs around him.

"This time..." He panted against her lips. "You're not running away."

Outside, thunder cracked. Rain poured down in sheets, drowning out the sounds of their ragged breathing. Two people, both under the influence, surrendered completely to the darkness.
###Chapter 144

Ethan Roscente completely lost control in the darkness.

Vivian Laurent's body seemed tailor-made for him, every curve fitting perfectly against his. He had never felt such an irresistible magnetic pull before.

"Don't move." His deep voice carried undeniable dominance.

Vivian's struggles were futile against his iron-like embrace. His arms tightened like steel bands around her.

"Mmm..." Her protest was swallowed by his lips, reduced to a soft whimper.

Ethan's palm slid over her slender waist, fingers brushing against the fluffy bunny tail. He gave it a deliberate squeeze, making her shiver.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "Don't you dare!"

He ignored her completely. The drug and primal instinct had consumed his rationality, leaving only one thought: claim her.

His scorching lips trailed down her neck, leaving burning marks. In the darkness, every sensation was amplified. Each of Vivian's gasps drove him wilder.

"Help me..." Ethan's voice was rough with desire.

Vivian's legs weakened, only his support preventing her from collapsing. She tried pushing him away, but he captured her wrists.

"Let go!" Her voice trembled.

Ethan paid no heed. He interlaced their fingers with possessive force, guiding her hand downward.

"You!" Vivian jerked back as if electrocuted. "I'll kill you!"

He chuckled darkly, pulling her closer. Her threat sounded more like a plea to him, fueling his obsession.

"Vivian..." He murmured her name.

Her response was a sharp bite. The sudden pain brought brief clarity, making him realize his loss of control.

Lights flooded the room.

Ethan finally saw the "little bunny" in his arms clearly. Beneath the heavy makeup, her familiar features were unmistakable. The fluffy bunny ears swayed slightly with her movements.

"You..." His throat moved, eyes flashing with awe.

It wasn't a hallucination after all. It was really her.
###Chapter 145

Vivian's dazed expression made Ethan's Adam's apple bob. He clenched his fists, nails digging deep into his palms.

The metallic tang of blood spread across his tongue.

"Get out!" Ethan shoved her away violently, his voice hoarse with barely restrained fury.

Vivian staggered, catching herself on the coffee table. Her entire body burned, vision swimming with black spots.

"This is my apartment," she sneered. "You're the one who should leave."

They froze simultaneously.

Only then did Ethan notice the unnatural flush on Vivian's cheeks. He turned to leave, but a sudden grip stopped him.

Vivian fisted his shirt collar, scorching breath fanning his neck. "You think you can walk away before—"

Her words dissolved as their lips crashed together.

Every shred of restraint shattered.

......

Dawn light pierced through the curtains when Vivian woke sprawled across a bare male chest.

She went rigid.

The wrecked bedroom testified to last night's frenzy. Shredded fabric littered the floor. The air still hung heavy with musk.

"Ethan!" Vivian lunged for his throat.

He flipped her beneath him in one fluid motion. Scratches marred his tanned skin. A bloody bite mark glistened on his shoulder.

"I'll take responsibility," he rasped.

Vivian kicked hard. Ethan landed heavily on the rug but rose unfazed, reaching for his clothes.

Morning light carved every defined muscle of his torso.

"Like hell I need that!" Vivian yanked the sheets higher, ears burning crimson.

Ethan suddenly stilled, gaze locking on the bed. "Last night was your first time?"
###Chapter 146

Vivian Laurent leaned against the headboard, a slender cigarette between her fingers.

Smoke curled around her as she studied Ethan Roscente through half-lidded eyes.

The man who'd been a starving wolf last night now looked every inch the polished CEO.

"What's this?" She blew a smoke ring with a mocking laugh. "Mr. Roscente taking responsibility?"

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks, his gaze lingering on the red marks along her collarbone.

"You were a virgin." His voice was deep.

The cigarette trembled in Vivian's fingers, ashes scattering on the silk sheets.

"Bullshit!" She sat up abruptly. "I've slept with more men than you've ever laid eyes on!"

A smirk played on Ethan's lips.

He bent to pick up the bunny ear headband from the floor, twirling it around his finger.

"That's not what you said last night."

Vivian's face flushed crimson.

She hurled a pillow at him. "Get out!"

Ethan caught it effortlessly and tossed it onto the sofa.

"Get dressed." He checked his watch. "The registry office opens at nine."

Vivian blinked. Had she heard him right?

"Have you lost your mind? We've only been divorced for three months!"

Ethan straightened his tie, his eyes unreadable behind his glasses.

"Perfect. Saves us the waiting period."

Her hands shook with rage.

Wrapping the sheet around herself, she stepped onto the carpet barefoot.

"Ethan Roscente, do you think sleeping with me means you have to marry me?" Her laugh was bitter. "This isn't the dark ages!"

Ethan closed the distance between them in one stride.

He caged her against the wall, his breath warm on her face.

"Then why were you a virgin?"

Vivian turned her face away.

"None of your damn business!"

Ethan gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Marry me." His voice was rough. "Now."

She slapped his hand away.

"In your dreams! Consider last night a dog bite and get the hell out!"

Ethan straightened his suit jacket.

"You have three days to decide."

At the door, he paused and held up the bunny ears.

"Oh," he said, "I'm keeping these."

Vivian grabbed the ashtray and threw it.

The door clicked shut just in time. The ashtray hit the wood with a dull thud.

She collapsed onto the floor and reached for her phone.

Texted her best friend: "I slept with Ethan Roscente."

The reply came instantly: "??? You finally bagged him?"

Vivian typed furiously: "He bagged me!"

Another vibration.

"So...remarriage?"

She tossed the phone onto the bed.

In the bathroom mirror, the evidence of last night covered her skin.

As hot water streamed down, Ethan's words echoed in her mind.

"Vivian," he'd whispered against her ear, "let's start over."

She scrubbed her skin until it turned red.

"Bastard..."

Steam fogged the mirror, hiding the tears on her cheeks.
###Chapter 147

Ethan Roscente stood motionless, watching Vivian Laurent's bloodshot eyes.

He knew she needed space.

"I'll come back later," he said, turning to leave.

"Stop!"

Vivian's voice cut like a blade.

Ethan froze, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

"If you ever show your face near me again, I'll destroy you."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"Vivian, about last night—"

"Get out!"

She hurled a vase from the coffee table.

Ethan sidestepped as glass shattered at his feet.

One last glance, then he walked out.

The door clicked shut. Vivian collapsed onto the sofa.

Every muscle ached as if she'd been run over.

Fragmented memories flooded back—Ethan pinning her down like a rabid animal.

She pounded the cushions with clenched fists.

Her phone buzzed.

Ethan's message appeared: [Sent food over.]

She blocked the number without hesitation.

Under the scalding shower, she studied the bruises in the mirror.

Her fist smashed through the reflection.

Cracks spiderwebbed across the glass.

Meanwhile, Ethan was mobilizing his team.

"Monitor Sophia Evans' flight," he ordered coldly. "Detain her upon landing."

The voice on the line acknowledged.

Ethan massaged his temples.

This situation had spiraled beyond control.

—

Wrapped in a robe, Vivian dialed Lucas Lefèvre.

"Viv?"

"Run a background check."

She gave Chase Blanchet's name.

Keyboard clatter sounded through the receiver.

"Found him. This guy's connected."

Lucas' tone turned grave.

"Compile the evidence."

Vivian's laugh held no warmth. "I want him locked away forever."

"Understood."

Lucas hesitated. "Viv, about last night—"

"I'm fine." She cut him off. "Just do it."

Ending the call, she tossed the phone aside.

A dull throb pulsed between her thighs.

She hurled a pillow at the wall.

Ethan Roscente would pay for this.
###Chapter 148

Vivian Laurent handed her plan to Lucas Lefèvre, and within 24 hours, results followed.

Chase Blanchet's father's company was suddenly audited by tax authorities, revealing glaring financial discrepancies. Simultaneously, police raided a private club after an anonymous tip, arresting several businessmen and politicians involved in an indecent party.

"Efficient," Vivian murmured, a faint smirk playing on her lips as she scanned the news.

Lucas texted: Everything's handled. They'll never recover from this.

Thanks, she replied.

Her phone buzzed again. Since when do you say 'thanks'? Are you an imposter?

Vivian chuckled. Yes, I'm an alien in disguise.

... Lucas responded with a string of ellipses.

Enough jokes, she typed, turning serious. Keep monitoring the situation. Alert me if anything changes.

Got it!

The next morning, Vivian headed straight to the pharmacy.

Without hesitation, she swallowed two morning-after pills. Her gaze lingered on the box, emotions flickering in her eyes. That unexpected night couldn't leave any consequences.

At the hospital, Finn Deross winced as Vivian changed his bandages.

"Ow—go easy, Dr. Luna!" he hissed through gritted teeth. "The mission was a success, wasn't it?"

Vivian pressed harder. "Success?" Her voice turned icy. "Do you have any idea what it cost me?"

Finn blinked, clueless. "What cost?"

She pursed her lips. This fool had no idea he'd nearly gotten her violated.

"Dr. Luna, seriously—who are you?" Finn leaned in, curiosity burning. "Those surveillance videos were pro-level, like something out of a spy movie!"

"Stop asking questions," she snapped.

Finn pouted. "You're so secretive. Just like my uncle..."

Vivian froze. "What uncle?"

His eyes darted away. Family rules forbade him from uttering a single word about that man.

Across the ocean, Zero's computer screen glowed in the dark.

Ever since spotting a woman who resembled Shadow in Country C, he'd been tracking events there. Now, a completed Dark Web contract caught his attention.

"Interesting," he mused.

The timing of the target's exposure matched the mission's completion—a signature Shadow move. She always cleaned up loose ends after a job.

His fingers flew across the keyboard. Though evidence was scarce, his instincts screamed: Shadow is alive. And she's in Country C.

A predatory smile curved his lips.

"Found you."
###Chapter 149

The storm was coming.

Vivian Laurent's days passed in their usual rhythm.

She moved between the hospital, Isabella Langley's design studio, and Lucas Lefèvre's shop.

That day, while scrolling through her phone, Sophia Evans' name dominated the trending list again.

#SophiaVisitsSickFan
#SophiaDonatesMillion
#WarmestIdolSophia

The video showed Sophia holding a patient's hand, tears glistening in her eyes. "Let's fight this together..."

The comments overflowed with emotion.

"Sophia is so kind!"
"How could anyone slander such a pure soul?"
"Vivian should leave the entertainment industry!"

Vivian swiped past without expression.

Sophia's new drama was officially announced.

At the press conference, reporters pressed her about the brake line incident.

Sophia smoothed her hair. "I understand her jealousy. After all, Ethan and I..."

Her words ignited the internet.

"Sophia is too forgiving!"
"Someone like Vivian deserves to be blacklisted!"
"Let's expose her!"

Vivian smirked and turned off her phone.

She knew Sophia's tactics all too well.

The storm arrived without warning.

Heavy raindrops hammered against the windows all night.

Standing by the glass, Vivian felt an inexplicable unease.

The next morning, the downpour intensified.

"Vivian! It's an emergency!"

Lucas burst into the clinic, drenched.

Vivian's medical file clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 150

Vivian's phone vibrated urgently with a call from Lucas.

"The real estate project is in trouble!"

The development she had fought for was now in its construction phase, with buildings rising rapidly.

"Sales were phenomenal. The prime location sold out immediately. But now..."

"What happened?" Vivian's stomach tightened.

"Heavy rains caused a building collapse at the construction site!"

Her grip on the phone faltered. "How? Any casualties?"

"Thankfully, work was halted due to the storm. But inspectors found substandard materials. Someone reported us for cutting corners. The project's suspended, and buyers and media are furious."

Exhaustion weighed Lucas's voice. He'd overseen every detail, yet disaster struck.

"Quality control was sabotaged," he growled.

Vivian inhaled sharply. Billions in investments and Triple Six Realty's reputation hung in the balance.

"What's the scene like?"

"Media swarming, buyers protesting, regulators demanding answers."

"I'm coming." She grabbed her coat.

This was her company. She'd face it head-on.

"Vivian!" Lucas protested. "It's a mob out there!"

Nathan happened by, noting her tension. "Need assistance?"

"Corporate emergency." She accepted the umbrella he offered.

The rain eased, but dread settled in her chest. News alerts about the collapse flooded her phone.

"Are all department heads on-site?"

"Waiting for you."

"Confirm no injuries first. Safety is priority!" Her tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 151

The rain outside the window gradually eased.

Vivian Laurent arrived at the scene when Lucas Lefèvre suddenly grabbed her. "Viv, your lab coat."

Only then did she notice she was still wearing her hospital uniform.

The media had already set up their cameras. Vivian's chest tightened. If Ethan Roscente saw the reports...

Her lips pressed into a thin line beneath her mask. Too late to worry about that now.

As she pushed open the car door, Lucas barely had his umbrella up before a dark figure cut between them.

An iron grip clamped around her wrist, yanking her under another black umbrella.

The familiar scent of cologne hit her.

Vivian's pupils constricted.

Ethan Roscente!

The obsidian suit amplified his intimidating aura, his jawline taut with tension.

Her heart skipped a beat. Speak of the devil.

"Let go!" She struggled, but he didn't budge.

Ethan dragged her into a secluded corner.

"Have you lost your mind?" His voice simmered with anger. "Do you know what kind of viper's nest you're walking into?"

Vivian frowned. "None of your business."

"That bastard Lucas sent you as his sacrificial lamb!" Ethan's knuckles whitened. "Can you handle the fallout from Triple Six Realty's shoddy materials scandal?"

Raindrops slid down the umbrella's edge, drawing silver lines between them.

Finally understanding, Vivian scoffed. "Not everyone operates like you, with such disgusting tactics."

Rage flickered in Ethan's eyes.

He ripped off her mask. "Have you learned nothing these years? Or—" His thumb brushed her lower lip. "Has he fucked you into submission?"

Vivian raised her hand to strike, but he caught her wrist mid-air.

"I have the material inspection reports." She enunciated each word. "I'm here to expose the truth."

Ethan froze.

A commotion erupted nearby as camera flashes erupted like a thunderstorm.

"Dr. Luna! It's really Dr. Luna!"

"Why is the medical equipment R&D expert here?"

Ethan's expression turned to stone.
###Chapter 152

"Ethan Roscente, if you're sick, go check yourself into a hospital."

Vivian Laurent shook off his grip and turned to leave. Hundreds of workers were still waiting for her at the construction site accident.

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "I'm trying to save you!"

"Let go!"

"Is this worthless company worth risking your life for? Do you think that man cares whether you live or die?"

Vivian smirked coldly. "My company. My people. None of your concern."

The stubborn set of her shoulders sent a sharp pang through Ethan's chest. She'd walked away with nothing during their divorce, and now she was being used as a scapegoat.

"Come with me. I'll handle this."

"I don't need your help." She wrenched her arm free. "Staying away from me is help enough."

Her slender frame stood unwavering in the downpour. The image overlapped with another—Dr. Luna, the renowned physician who'd also been named Vivian Laurent. Just as unyielding.

Against his better judgment, he followed.

"Ms. Laurent, the media has the entrance blocked." Lucas Lefèvre hurried over with an umbrella.

Vivian scanned the sea of reporters. "You investigate the construction materials. I'll deal with this."

"At least take the umbrella—"

"Unnecessary." She shrugged on a raincoat and yanked off her face mask.

Ethan's pupils contracted.

Raindrops slid down flawless, luminous skin—no scars in sight. That familiar defiant glint in her eyes was unmistakable.

Dr. Luna?!

His blood turned to ice. The disfigured ex-wife he'd despised... was the legendary physician of the capital?

Water dripped from his chin as Ethan stood frozen, gripped by a chill deeper than the storm.
###Chapter 153

Ethan Roscente's pupils constricted sharply, his gaze locking onto Vivian Laurent with laser focus.

The world seemed to spin around him.

How could this radiant woman possibly be his timid ex-wife?

The Vivian he remembered was a country bumpkin fresh from the countryside, without even a college degree. During his car accident recovery, she'd fumbled through basic caregiving. After marriage, she'd become a recluse, behaving like some provincial housewife.

But Dr. Luna?

An internationally renowned medical genius. The darling of fashion circles. The mysterious queen of high society. Every movement exuded breathtaking charm as she mingled effortlessly with elites.

These two personas couldn't possibly overlap.

Ethan's fingers clenched unconsciously.

No wonder she'd always avoided him. No wonder she'd refused to treat Sophia Evans. All the clues had been there, yet he'd ignored them.

Even at that jade gambling banquet, her dazzling performance should have raised suspicions.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

Their divorce had nothing to do with Lucas Lefèvre. She didn't need to rely on any man. She'd been acting all along, playing him for a fool.

The obesity. The facial scars. All disguises?

Ethan's chest heaved violently, his stare glued to Vivian.

She didn't even glance his way.

Standing in the pouring rain, she faced the media frenzy with unshakable poise.

"Everyone, I'm Vivian Laurent, head of Triple Six Realty."

Her voice cut through the downpour with crystalline clarity.

"We take full responsibility for today's incident. I promise all questionable construction materials will be scrapped. Completed sections will be demolished and rebuilt."

Raindrops slid down her hair, doing nothing to diminish her commanding presence.

"All material sources will be fully transparent and subject to public oversight. For any casualties, we accept complete liability. Affected homeowners will receive fair compensation."

Each word carried ironclad conviction.

This accountability, this strength—utterly unrecognizable from the shrinking violet in his memories.

Ethan remained rooted, rainwater soaking his suit.

Finally, he understood—he'd never truly known this woman at all.
###Chapter 154

Rain drummed against the makeshift canopy with urgent intensity.

A reporter shoved his microphone toward Vivian Laurent's face. "Reliable sources claim Triple Six Realty was established less than three months ago, snatching this project from Valrose Realty. With insufficient capital, how can you guarantee construction quality?"

"If not for this storm, how long would you have hidden these jerry-built projects?" another journalist demanded.

Vivian's fingertips turned cold. "We'll conduct comprehensive inspections on all ongoing constructions. No homeowner will move into unsafe properties."

She silently thanked fate for exposing the flaws early. Discovering them after completion would have been catastrophic.

"Liar!" A furious shout erupted from the crowd. "You just want to scam our hard-earned money!"

"Refund! Now!" More voices joined the outcry.

Vivian noticed the loudest protesters had shifty eyes—nothing like genuine homebuyers.

"I personally guarantee all problematic buildings will be demolished and rebuilt without delay," she declared firmly.

Her words were met with jeers.

"Women shouldn't run businesses!" A thug with a pockmarked face spat. "No refund today? We'll smash this pathetic company!"

Several burly men shoved past security onto the stage.

Vivian retreated until her back hit the cold display board.

"Stop."

The command sliced through chaos like a blade.

Silence fell instantly.

"It's Ethan Roscente!" Someone gasped.

Whispers rippled through the crowd. "Why would the Roscente Group CEO come here?"

Under his black umbrella, Ethan's leather shoes stepped through puddles, each footfall syncing with the crowd's held breaths.

Vivian tightened her grip on the document folder. Meeting him during her most humiliating moment was the last thing she wanted.

Ethan paused at the steps. As his umbrella tilted up, those fathomless eyes locked onto hers.

The entire crowd froze.

He spoke slowly...
###Chapter 155

Ethan Roscente strode through the rain with steady steps, coming to stand beside Vivian Laurent.

His towering figure cast a shadow over her, yet their presence together felt unexpectedly harmonious.

"As guarantor of Triple Six Realty, I have a statement to make."

Ethan's voice cut through the downpour, reaching every ear with crystal clarity.

He turned slightly, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Vivian.

"Ethan Roscente, CEO of Roscente Group. I assume you're all familiar with our corporation. I hereby guarantee Triple Six Realty will fulfill all obligations."

His sharp gaze swept across the crowd.

"Any homeowners requesting refunds may come directly to me. Roscente Group will honor full contract reimbursements."

Silence fell instantly over the scene.

Whispers began circulating through the crowd.

"The Roscente CEO is personally involved?"

"What's their relationship?"

The restless mob gradually settled.

Someone murmured, "With Roscente backing the project, why worry about unfinished buildings?"

Reporters raised their cameras but hesitated to act.

One bold journalist pushed forward.

"Mr. Roscente, what's the nature of your relationship with Triple Six Realty?"

A faint smile touched Ethan's lips.

"Strategic partners. I have complete faith in Ms. Laurent's capabilities."

He paused, his tone turning resolute.

"Roscente assumes full responsibility for any project issues."

As the rain lightened, tension thickened in the air.

"Now, does anyone still want a refund?"

Ethan's voice carried undeniable authority.

The crowd began dispersing.

"We trust Mr. Roscente!"

"Let's go home and wait for updates."

Homeowners gradually left.

Several suspicious figures tried slipping away unnoticed.

"Stop."

At Ethan's command, bodyguards immediately blocked their path.

"Y-yes, Mr. Roscente?"

One man stammered nervously.

Ethan's smile turned icy.

"You wanted refunds? Present your purchase contracts."

The men paled.

"We...we've changed our minds..."

"No contracts?"

Ethan's eyes turned piercing.

"Inciting riots carries legal consequences."

He stepped closer.

"Shall I have someone investigate your backgrounds?"
###Chapter 156

The troublemakers' faces turned deathly pale.

Ethan Roscente's sharp gaze swept over them like an icy blade.

"Mr. Roscente, we were just passing by..." one man stammered.

"Show me your property ownership papers," Ethan interrupted coldly.

They exchanged nervous glances, beads of sweat forming on their foreheads. None of them had any proof.

"Since you won't tell the truth, you can explain yourselves at the police station." Ethan pulled out his phone.

"No, wait!" They waved their hands frantically. "We're not residents here..."

Vivian Laurent stood nearby, rainwater dripping from her hair. She hadn't expected Ethan to see through their act so easily.

"Who sent you?" Ethan's voice could freeze hell itself. "Speak now, and I might let you go."

After exchanging hesitant looks, one man finally whispered, "It was... Miss Natalie Valrose..."

A cold smile curled Vivian's lips. Just as she'd suspected.

After humiliating Natalie at the restaurant and stealing her project, that woman wouldn't take it lying down.

Ethan signaled his bodyguards to release them. The thugs scrambled away like frightened rats.

An umbrella suddenly appeared over Vivian's head. She looked up into Ethan's stormy eyes.

"Dr. Luna? Or should I say... my ex-wife?" His low voice vibrated with suppressed anger.

Vivian shrugged. "Call me whatever you like."

She turned to leave, but Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"Did you enjoy playing games with me?" He gritted his teeth. "Why didn't you tell me you're Night? Why the fake identity?"

Rainwater traced the sharp line of his jaw. His dark eyes burned with intensity.

Vivian tried to pull free. "Mr. Roscente, are we that close?"

"You!" His grip tightened. "That night at the bar, you clearly—"

"Clearly what?" Vivian's laugh was bitter. "I thought you hated being lied to the most."

Her words stabbed straight into Ethan's heart. He released her abruptly, watching as she walked away without looking back.
###Chapter 157

Vivian Laurent let out a cold laugh, her fingers lightly tapping the table.

"Ethan Roscente, after three years of marriage, you still don't know what I look like."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as he struggled for words.

"The scar on my face healed long ago, but you never noticed." Vivian removed her mask. "I've been right in front of you every day, yet you couldn't recognize me."

His pupils constricted sharply.

"You thought all I could do was cook and do laundry?" Vivian scoffed. "If Night can run a company, why can't I?"

She stood up, looking down at him with disdain.

"You've always judged me with prejudice. When I dine with someone, it's gold-digging. When Night does the same, it's business networking."

Ethan's fingers clenched into fists.

"Victoria Roscente harassed me. Sophia Evans targeted me. The root cause is always you." Vivian grabbed her purse. "How many times must I tell you to stay away from me?"

She pushed open the private dining room door without looking back.

Ethan reached out to stop her but grasped only air.

Her words cut deeper than any blade.

Suddenly, he remembered those dark days after the car accident.

When doctors declared he'd never walk again, it was Vivian who administered daily acupuncture and massages.

He'd thrown medicine bowls at her in frustration. "Get out! Stop pretending to care!"

Yet she'd quietly cleaned up the mess and returned the next day.

Three months later, he miraculously stood up.

The doctors had marveled, "This recovery defies medical explanation!"

Ethan shot to his feet.

Could it be... Vivian had healed his legs?
###Chapter 158

Ethan Roscente stood in the pouring rain, water dripping from his hair. His fingers trembled slightly as he watched Vivian Laurent walk away.

He remembered the euphoria when he first stood up again. He had paced around the room like a child, forgetting even to thank her.

Now he realized he had never truly appreciated all she had done for him.

She had healed his legs, but he had broken her heart.

Bending down, Ethan picked up the fallen umbrella. His suit was already soaked. He dialed his secretary. "Put Triple Six Realty under 24-hour surveillance. Intervene immediately if anything happens."

When Vivian arrived at the construction site, chaos greeted her. Lucas Lefèvre was struggling to handle reporters and angry families of the victims.

"Vivian, I'm sorry." Lucas's eyes were bloodshot. "Over half the materials were substandard. The inspection engineer has been missing for three days."

Vivian stared at the collapsed wall, its rusted steel bars exposed. She took a deep breath. "First, stabilize the situation."

Inside the conference room, a dozen suppliers lounged with arrogant expressions.

"Ms. Laurent, this isn't our fault," said the heavyset leader, blowing smoke rings. "Your people specifically requested lower-grade materials."

Vivian slammed the contract on the table. "It clearly states Grade A materials. You delivered Grade C."

"Ah, but look at this." The man produced an addendum. "This bears your company's official seal. It explicitly permits substandard materials."

Lucas shot to his feet. "That's impossible! I never signed this!"

Vivian took the document, her hands shaking slightly. The seal was genuine, but the signature was clearly forged.

"Call the police," she said coldly.

The supplier's face darkened. "Think carefully, Ms. Laurent. No one benefits if this escalates."

Vivian locked eyes with him. "Who put you up to this?"

The room fell silent. The suppliers exchanged nervous glances, none daring to speak.

Then Vivian's phone rang.

The screen displayed a name: "Natalie Valois."
###Chapter 159
Natalie's Defeat

"These materials are indeed defective." Vivian Laurent tapped the desk with her fingertips, her gaze sharp as a blade.

Without hesitation, Lucas Lefèvre turned to leave. "I'll investigate immediately."

Within half an hour, Lucas returned with a terrified man in tow, extracting the name of the mastermind behind the scheme.

His recent divided attention had created this opening for sabotage.

"Viv, the losses are catastrophic." Lucas ran a frustrated hand through his hair.

Vivian remained composed. "Stay calm. I need you to look into someone for me."

"Who?"

Her eyes narrowed, voice icy. "Dig into Natalie Valois's connections with these suppliers. I want concrete evidence."

If Natalie was truly behind this, Vivian wouldn't let it slide.

Fortunately, the project was in its early stages. The damages were still manageable. The sudden downpour had ironically been a blessing.

After the rain stopped, Vivian personally oversaw the demolition of all compromised structures.

She inspected every new material shipment herself. For full transparency, she even live-streamed the construction site.

Online discussions erupted. Ethan Roscente's public endorsement of Vivian became a trending topic.

Natalie had been certain this would crush Vivian. She'd calculated Triple Six Realty's financial collapse perfectly.

But Ethan's unexpected intervention shattered her plans. The Roscente Group's backing instantly swayed public opinion.

Natalie's nails dug into her palms as she watched Vivian calmly directing reconstruction efforts on the live feed.

"Ms. Valois, emergency!" Her secretary burst in, panic-stricken.

Natalie slammed the desk. "Get out!"

"It's critical!" The secretary stamped her foot. "Multiple projects have been suspended. Tax authorities are investigating us!"

Natalie's face drained of color.
###Chapter 160

"What's going on?" Natalie Valrose's face turned pale as she nearly dropped her phone. "Why was the project suddenly halted?"

"Someone reported our materials failed inspection," her assistant answered urgently. "Valrose Group's stock is plummeting."

"Where's my father?" Her fingers trembled.

"The chairman is waiting for you in his office."

The moment she pushed open the office door, a sharp slap struck her face.

Smack!

Natalie staggered back, her cheek burning.

"Dad!" She covered her stinging face as tears spilled over.

"Look what you've done!" Vincent Valrose roared in fury.

"What did I do?" She lifted her chin defiantly.

"You dared to target Vivian!" Vincent slammed his hands on the desk.

"She deserved it!" Natalie spat through gritted teeth. "That ungrateful wretch stole our project first!"

"Fool!" Vincent bellowed. "Do you know her connection to Ethan Roscente?"

Vincent had never cared about his estranged daughter. After banishing Vivian to the countryside years ago, he hadn't even noticed her three-year disappearance—let alone her secret marriage to Ethan.

"How would I know how she seduced Ethan Roscente?" Natalie wailed. "And you hit me for her sake?"

"Who's been managing the company all these years? Who's stayed by your side?" Tears streamed down her face. "You promised I'd be your only daughter!"

Vincent's expression softened as he saw her swollen cheek. "I'm sorry, Natalie. I acted rashly. The Roscente Group is crushing us. The company can't withstand this."

"You mean..." Her eyes widened. "Ethan is attacking us because of Vivian?"

"Whatever the reason, we must apologize." Vincent sighed wearily. "The Valrose family can't survive this blow."

At Roscente Group headquarters, security barred them from entering.

"No appointment, no entry," the receptionist said coldly.

After two days of failed attempts, they still hadn't caught a glimpse of Ethan.

"This is getting us nowhere," Vincent muttered anxiously.

Natalie suddenly smirked at her phone. "Dad, I know where he is."

......

Dust swirled around the construction site where Vivian Laurent inspected materials with meticulous focus. Sweat glistened on her sun-kissed skin.

Ethan Roscente stood nearby, watching her silently. He'd never seen this version of Vivian—resilient, dedicated, utterly transformed from his memories.

In that moment, he realized exactly what he'd lost.

"What are you doing here?" Vivian asked without looking up, her hands never pausing in their work.
###Chapter 161

Ethan Roscente twisted open the bottle cap and offered the water to Vivian Laurent.

She didn't take it. Her icy gaze spoke volumes.

Her eyes were filled with unmistakable rejection.

He understood—they were square. There was no reason for him to intrude.

"The Roscente Group guaranteed this project. I'm just checking the progress." He withdrew his hand. "Need emergency funds? I can transfer ten billion immediately."

"No."

Her tone was firm. Though the project's rework demanded massive capital, and her liquidity was tight...

She'd rather drain her personal savings and other business reserves than accept his help.

"Consider it a loan." Ethan persisted. "Lucas lacks experience. I brought a professional team to assist."

"Thanks, but no." Vivian cut him off. "I don't want to owe you."

Ethan fell silent.

Studying her stubborn profile, he realized he'd never truly known her.

Discovering his ex-wife was the legendary Vivian had sparked a secret thrill in him.

This was who she was meant to be—shining in her own world, not confined as Mrs. Roscente.

"Vivian, I—"

Simon Eisner hurried over. "Mr. Roscente, you have a visitor."

Vincent Valrose's obsequious voice rang out. "An honor to finally meet the great Ethan Roscente!"

He ignored his daughter entirely, rushing toward Ethan.

Ethan's expression darkened. He'd investigated how the Valrose family had treated Vivian.

"Throw him out." The order was curt.

Vincent paled, nearly dropping to his knees. "Have mercy, Mr. Roscente! Please spare Valrose Realty!"

Vivian burst out laughing. "Ethan, since when did you start herding livestock?"

Ethan: "..."
###Chapter 162

Ethan Roscente tapped his long fingers on the desk, his indifferent gaze sweeping over Vincent Valrose's fawning face.

Vivian Laurent stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, sunlight outlining her delicate profile.

Vincent finally noticed her presence, his pupils contracting sharply. Wasn't this the same Vivian who caused a scene at Natalie's wedding? She had blossomed into such a stunning beauty.

What shocked him more was Vivian daring to address Ethan by his full name. Everyone in the business world respectfully called him "Mr. Roscente."

Instead of being angered, Ethan's expression softened.

Vincent's eyes darted as schemes formed in his mind. If he could secure this connection with the Roscente family...

"Mr. Roscente, I'm Vivian's father Vincent Valrose." He rubbed his hands together with an ingratiating smile. "Please forgive my daughter's lack of manners."

Ethan arched an eyebrow, his gaze shifting between Vivian and Vincent.

"Father?" Vivian laughed coldly. "Last time we met was at my mother's funeral, wasn't it?"

Vincent's face stiffened before forcing another smile. "I've neglected you these years. Let's have a family dinner tonight? Mr. Roscente should join us?"

Natalie stood nearby, her nails digging into her palms. She glared at Vivian's face, wishing she could tear off that mocking smile.

"Fine." Vivian suddenly agreed, her red lips curving. "Though I suppose my old bedroom is now a storage room?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. He'd investigated Vivian's situation in the Valrose family, but reality proved worse than expected.

"Of course not!" Vincent said hastily. "Your room has been kept exactly as you left it."

Natalie finally snapped. "Father!"

"Silence!" Vincent barked before turning back with a paternal smile. "Vivian, I've failed you these years..."

Ethan suddenly stood, his black suit amplifying his intimidating presence.

"Mr. Valrose." His voice turned icy. "If your daughter's room truly remained untouched, why is there no bed?"

Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead. He hadn't expected Ethan to know such details about the Valrose household.

Vivian lightly traced the cufflinks on Ethan's sleeve, her fingertips lingering on the intricate patterns.

"Mr. Roscente has an excellent memory." Her smile carried hidden meaning. "But Father's forgetfulness is understandable. He barely remembers what I look like."

The office fell into dead silence. Natalie turned pale, finally realizing this radiant Vivian wasn't the same bullied ugly duckling from years ago.
###Chapter 163

"Vivian, the Valrose family will always be your home." Vincent Valrose forced a smile, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Vivian Laurent twirled her teacup absentmindedly, her gaze icy. "Yet I don't even have my own room anymore."

"When Natalie and her homewrecker mother moved in, their first act was stealing my bedroom." She locked eyes with Vincent. "Now you expect me to stay in the servants' quarters?"

Vincent stole a glance at Ethan Roscente's stony expression and shuddered.

"Of course not!" He waved his hands frantically. "We have plenty of rooms. Take your pick."

A smirk played on Vivian's lips. "Then return my original room to me." She turned to Natalie Valrose. "As for the thief, the servants' quarters seem fitting."

"Vivian! How dare you!" Natalie trembled with rage, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

Vivian tilted her head innocently. "Father, am I being unreasonable?"

"N-no, of course not." Vincent wiped his brow. "I'll have your room prepared immediately."

"Dad!" Natalie shrieked. "She won't even stay there! This is just to humiliate me!"

"True, I won't." Vivian took a sip of tea. "Perhaps I'll keep a dog there instead." She set down her cup. "The bed as its kennel, the rest as chew toys. Perfect."

"Who are you calling a dog?!" Natalie leapt up, arm raised to strike.

"Enough!" Vincent barked.

Tears welled in Natalie's eyes. "She just called me a dog!"

Vivian chuckled. "Good comprehension skills." She stood, looking down at Natalie. "Though even dogs have more dignity than you."

Natalie lunged at her in a blind rage.

Vivian's foot shot out, sending Natalie crashing to the floor.

"My apologies," Vivian smoothed her skirt. "Reflex when a rabid animal attacks."
###Chapter 164

Natalie Valois staggered up from the ground, her dress covered in dust.

"Who are you calling a rabid dog? I'll tear your mouth—"

"What will you do?" Vivian Laurent cut her off sharply.

She deliberately stepped behind Ethan Roscente. Vivian knew Vincent Valrose's act was just to curry favor with the powerful CEO.

Why not use the ready-made shield?

"You want to hit me now? That murderous glare—should I expect you to finish me off when we get home? Maybe I shouldn't return to the Valrose household at all." Vivian raised her voice intentionally.

Vincent grabbed Natalie's arm. "Mind your manners! Apologize to your sister!"

He turned with an ingratiating smile. "She tripped on her own. Vivian dear, your sister's young and foolish. Be the bigger person. I'll have your room prepared immediately. What breed of dog would you like? Daddy will get you the finest."

Vivian watched Vincent's groveling display—like a dog begging for scraps.

She smirked. "I want a backstabbing wolf."

"A...backstabbing wolf?" Vincent's smile froze.

"Yes." Vivian smoothed her hair. "My mother raised one once. It cost her life. I'd like to see how vicious these creatures truly are."

Vincent's face drained of color. The insult was unmistakable.

"Such a sense of humor, Vivian." He forced another smile. "Why not bring Mr. Roscente for lunch? I can send help. The sun's scorching—hardly suitable for someone of Mr. Roscente's stature."

His eyes darted to Ethan. "Mr. Roscente, the Valrose estate is quite pleasant. Perhaps—"

"Do I know you?" Ethan's icy tone sliced through the air. "Why would I eat at your house?"

Vincent choked on his words.

His gaze locked onto Vivian sheltering behind Ethan. This only confirmed their intimate connection.

"Mr. Roscente seems quite close to my daughter. I'm Vincent Valrose, her father. Since—"

"Enough." Vivian laughed derisively. "Trying to claim connections now? Are you worthy? Does he even acknowledge you? The embarrassment."

Vincent's face cycled through shades of gray. Never in his life had he endured such humiliation.

Yet he couldn't even retaliate. The Roscente Group held Valrose Realty's fate in its hands. For now, Vivian had to be treated like royalty.
###Chapter 165

"Vivian, those words cut deep. Being a Valrose is your birthright." Vincent Valrose's face turned ashen.

Vivian gave a humorless laugh. "Exactly why it's my greatest shame."

Ethan Roscente's lips quirked in amusement. This version of Vivian was like a rose in full bloom - vibrant and thorned.

She'd never been one to suffer fools gladly. Unprovoked, she remained civil. Wronged, she retaliated tenfold.

The docile bride he'd married was a carefully constructed facade. He much preferred this unvarnished truth.

Even her coldness toward him was preferable to deception. Especially when her fox-like eyes gleamed with cunning schemes.

"You—" Vincent trembled with impotent rage.

He forced a conciliatory smile. "I know I've failed you. I want to make amends."

Vivian arched a brow. "What perfect timing."

"Timing?" Vincent looked genuinely confused.

She gestured to the construction site behind her. "See this land?"

Vincent nodded.

"I took this project from Natalie." Vivian's tone remained even. "The storm collapsed one building. Faulty materials mean demolishing everything."

Vincent's pulse spiked. Was she expecting compensation?

"Project failures are your responsibility," he said hastily.

Vivian's smile turned glacial. "Relax. Ethan's covering the costs. But someone colluded with suppliers, planted spies—"

Her gaze sliced toward Natalie.

Natalie's spine prickled with dread. "That's slander!"

Her tracks were covered. Vivian couldn't possibly have evidence. This had to be a bluff.
###Chapter 166

Vivian Laurent's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained icy cold.

"What's the rush? I didn't name anyone." She spoke deliberately. "Unless you're feeling guilty?"

Natalie Valrose's face flushed crimson as she slammed her hands on the table and stood abruptly.

"You're slandering me! You've always framed me since we were kids!" She gritted her teeth. "Old habits die hard!"

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned dangerously cold.

"Who exactly are you calling a dog?" His voice was low and threatening.

Vincent Valrose paled and immediately delivered a stinging slap across Natalie's face.

The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the grand hall.

"You disgraceful brat!" Vincent roared. "Apologize to your sister this instant!"

Natalie clutched her cheek as tears streamed down her face.

"Dad! She's the one who—"

"Silence!" Vincent cut her off harshly. "Vivian is your blood sister. Why would she falsely accuse you?"

He turned to Vivian with an ingratiating smile.

"Vivian, your sister is just being childish. She was only insulting herself."

Vivian chuckled softly, her eyes flickering to her phone screen.

The live stream had exploded with activity.

Comments flooded the screen:

"Holy shit! Is this a real-time rich family drama?"

"Queen Vivian is slaying! That death glare though!"

"Ethan protecting his wife is everything!"

"Can Sophia Evans' fans shut up? She's the one chasing after Ethan!"

"Homewrecker bitch! Get out of showbiz, Vivian!"

"Are you blind? Vivian's a real estate CEO!"

The comments were polarized.

Some gushed:

"Vivian's beauty is next level! A hundred times classier than Sophia!"

"The way Ethan looks at her... couple goals!"

Others spewed venom:

"Whore! Stealing someone's man will get you what you deserve!"

"Let's doxx her! Revenge for Sophia!"

Vivian pocketed her phone casually.

"Dad, you're awfully quick to distance yourself..." She paused meaningfully. "Could it be you know something?"

Beads of sweat formed on Vincent's forehead.

Ethan suddenly stood, his tailored sleeve brushing against Vivian's hand.

"Need me to handle this?" He murmured.

Vivian shook her head, crimson lips curving.

"This little matter? I'll take care of it myself."

She turned to face the cameras, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"To everyone watching—the real show is just beginning."
###Chapter 167
Vivian's Trap

Sophia Evans' fans flooded the internet with vile insults and crude language.

Sophia stared at the live stream, her eyes burning with jealousy.

The image of that perfect couple standing side by side stabbed at her heart like a knife.

After her last plan failed, Ethan Roscente had stormed away in anger.

She fled back to the country in panic, too afraid to reach out.

Ethan had gone completely silent.

Now here he was again—with that woman.

Sophia's nails dug deep into her palms.

How did Vivian Laurent deserve all this?

A brilliant doctor. An elite race car driver. A renowned designer and perfumer.

Now she even owned a real estate company.

It was as if the world's luck had been poured into her lap.

The endless praise online only fueled Sophia's rage.

She hurled her tablet onto the floor.

On screen, Ethan's protective stance toward Vivian made her blood boil.

Meanwhile, Vivian watched coldly as the Valrose family tore itself apart.

Vincent Valrose barked at Natalie Valrose.

"Old habits die hard?" Vivian arched a brow mockingly. "Cat got your tongue?"

Vincent's face darkened.

He swore silently to teach Vivian a lesson once Ethan was gone.

"Apologize to your sister now!" he snapped.

Natalie lifted her chin defiantly. "She's no sister of mine!"

A sharp slap rang out.

Natalie clutched her stinging cheek, humiliation and fury twisting her features.

"Her own incompetence ruined everything, yet she blames me?" she shrieked.

Vivian let out a soft laugh.

"Even animals take responsibility for their actions. You're worse than trash."

"Liar!" Natalie screamed hysterically. "Just because Ethan backs you doesn't mean you can slander me!"

She was certain Vivian had no proof.

"Seems last time wasn't lesson enough," Vivian mused.

At the mention of the restaurant incident, Natalie's eyes flashed with venom.

"You were the one who humiliated me!"

"Swear it wasn't you," Vivian pressed.

"It wasn't!" Natalie shot back without thinking.

Too late, she realized the trap.

"What if I have evidence?" Vivian's lips curved. "Should I call the police? Or make you pay for all damages?"

Natalie's face went deathly pale.
###Chapter 168

Vivian Laurent tossed the choice to Natalie Valrose.

Confess.
Or deny.

Confession meant full responsibility.
Denial risked facing Vivian's potential evidence.

Natalie's fingers trembled.

She remembered the restaurant incident.
Vivian had worn that same confident expression then.

It had all been an elaborate mind game.

"I won't play your game," Natalie hissed through clenched teeth.

Vivian's lips curved. "Scared?"

Her gaze flicked to Vincent Valrose.

"Shall we review the evidence together?"

Natalie's breathing turned ragged.

"What evidence?"

"The recording of you bribing the supplier." Vivian's voice was soft. "And the bank transfers."

Ethan Roscente produced his phone at the perfect moment.

"Shall I dial 911 for you?"

His tone could have frozen hell.

Beads of sweat formed on Natalie's forehead.
The Roscente legal team's reputation preceded them.

Once authorities got involved...

"I just wanted to teach you a lesson!" Natalie blurted.

Vivian's eyes sharpened like daggers.

"So you admit it?"

"No!" Natalie backpedaled frantically.

Ethan's thumb hovered over the call button.

"Wait!" Natalie clutched her head, crumbling. "I...I was involved."

Her voice dwindled to a whisper.

"But I never meant to hurt anyone..."

Vivian turned to Vincent.

"Hear that?"

Bitter fury simmered beneath her words.

"All because of your petty jealousy?"

She pointed toward the collapsed construction site outside.

"Do you realize how many could have died?"

Natalie hunched her shoulders.

"They'd have caught it during inspection..."

Her weak justification hung in the air.

"I just wanted you to lose money..."

Vivian's laugh was ice.

"Using innocent lives to get back at me?"

Ethan's screen illuminated the dim room.

The numbers 911 glowed like an accusation.
###Chapter 169

The construction site was in complete disarray after the torrential downpour. Broken steel bars protruded like vicious fangs.

Natalie clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. The elaborate trap she had designed was utterly destroyed by the sudden storm.

Live stream comments flooded the screen.

"Oh my god! Vivian was framed all along!"

"These shady developers need to be exposed!"

"Poor Vivian, always being targeted."

Vivian stood at the center of the ruins, rainwater dripping from her hair. She fixed Natalie with an icy stare. "Now it's time to settle accounts."

Vincent Valrose turned pale. He grabbed Natalie and slapped her across the face.

"Dad!" Natalie staggered back.

"Kneel!" Vincent roared. "Apologize to Vivian!"

Natalie bit her lip and dropped heavily to her knees on the concrete.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, voice trembling.

Vivian gave a cold laugh. "That's it?"

Ethan Roscente stood beside Vivian, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Vincent wiped sweat from his brow. "We'll compensate half the material costs—"

"Not enough." Vivian cut him off. "I want Natalie to publicly confess."

The live stream camera captured the tense standoff. Comments exploded.

"So satisfying!"

"Make the villain pay!"

Vincent clenched his fists. "Fine."

Ethan leaned close to Vivian. "Happy now?"

His quiet words made her heart skip a beat.

"Mhm." She turned away, the tips of her ears turning pink.

A faint smile flickered in Ethan's eyes. "Whatever you say."

His words brushed against Vivian's heart like a feather.
###Chapter 170

Vincent Valrose hurriedly left the scene without daring to linger for even a second.

He needed to secure funding immediately, or the Valrose Group's losses would be catastrophic.

Before leaving, he plastered on a smile and said to Ethan Roscente, "Mr. Roscente, you must bring Vivian home for dinner sometime."

Vincent knew perfectly well that Ethan and Vivian's relationship was far from simple.

As long as he kept a firm grip on Vivian, the Valrose family's resurgence was guaranteed.

Thinking of Natalie's foolish actions, a cold glint flashed in Vincent's eyes.

He would teach that useless daughter of his a harsh lesson when he got back!

With the unwanted guests gone, Vivian resumed inventorying supplies.

Ethan, however, stayed close behind her.

Vivian abruptly stopped and turned. "Do you need something, Mr. Roscente? Waiting for my gratitude?"

"No thanks needed," Ethan said intently. "Have dinner with me? There are things I want to say."

"I'm busy," Vivian refused bluntly.

"Just a quick meal. It won't take long," Ethan pressed earnestly.

Ever since learning the truth, his heart had been weighed down with guilt toward her.

"Mr. Roscente, persistence doesn't suit you." Vivian turned to leave.

She failed to notice the soft, muddy ground beneath her feet.

The recent heavy rains had left the terrain treacherously slick.

Her foot slipped, sending her tumbling forward.

"Careful!" Ethan seized her wrist and pulled her securely into his arms.

The familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her instantly.

This was the embrace she'd once dreamed of.

Before their marriage, she'd yearned for such a moment.

During their three years together, she'd prayed nightly for his return.

Now, it had come far too late.

Vivian shoved him away. "Thanks."

As she turned to leave, her foot nearly slipped again.

Without hesitation, Ethan swept her up into his arms.

"Put me down!" Vivian struggled in his hold.

Meanwhile, Sophia Evans stared furiously at her tablet screen.

The image of Ethan holding another woman sent daggers through her heart.

He was carrying Vivian like that!

This had to be one of Vivian's schemes.

She had to stop it.

Just then, a three-year-old boy ran up to her. "Mommy!"

Sophia's eyes lit up with inspiration.

Ethan carried Vivian steadily until they reached solid ground before setting her down.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian snapped, using his full name.

"Leave professional matters to professionals." Ethan gestured toward a nearby team. "I brought quality inspectors."

Vivian scoffed. "Such sudden generosity. Fine—you get five minutes for today's help."

Without Ethan's presence today, her victory wouldn't have been so decisive.

She always repaid debts fairly.
###Chapter 171

Vivian Laurent stood by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting her slender silhouette against the polished floor.

Ethan Roscente remained three steps behind her, his gaze fixed on her back.

"Vivian." His deep voice cut through the quiet office.

She turned slowly, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

"Responsible?" She let out a soft laugh. "Isn't it a bit late for that, Mr. Roscente?"

Her heels clicked against the marble as she closed the distance between them.

"We're divorced." She stopped just inches away, tilting her chin to meet his eyes. "And you were the one who couldn't wait to sign the papers."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"I know." His voice was rough. "But this time is different."

Her eyebrow arched. "Different how? When you realized I wasn't the Vivian you thought I was? Or when you found out I'm no miracle doctor?"

His brows furrowed.

"That's not—" He stepped forward, closing the gap between them. "It's because—"

His phone rang.

Sophia Evans' name flashed across the screen.

He declined the call without hesitation.

"Because of what?" Vivian's eyes gleamed with amusement. "That night?"

She laughed lightly. "Don't tell me you're that old-fashioned. It was just a one-night stand."

His expression darkened.

"I didn't—"

The phone rang again. This time, it was Theo's number.

Vivian gestured gracefully. "Go ahead. Wouldn't want to keep them waiting."

After a brief hesitation, he answered.

"Ethan, it's me." Sophia's voice carried through the speaker, deliberately loud. "Theo misses you."

There was rustling before a child's voice piped up. "I miss you."

Ethan's features softened. "I miss you too."

His eyes never left Vivian's face as he spoke.

She turned on her heel and walked toward her desk, her retreating figure radiating icy detachment.
###Chapter 172

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Vivian Laurent stood at the corner of the hallway, catching a glimpse of Ethan Roscente's tender smile as he turned his head.

"I've missed you too," his deep voice carried clearly to her ears.

Her fingers tightened around the file folder in her grip.

Just ten minutes ago, this same man had promised to take responsibility for her—even mentioned marriage.

Now he was whispering sweet nothings to another woman over the phone.

A cold laugh escaped her lips as her nails dug into her palms.

What a bastard.

She spun on her heel and strode away, the sharp click of her heels echoing across the marble floor.

On the other end of the line, a little boy's voice piped up. "Uncle Ethan, when are you coming to see Theo? I miss you so much. Mommy misses you too."

Sophia Evans knelt beside her son, silently mouthing the rehearsed lines to him.

"Uncle Ethan, Mommy's been sick these days. She cries all the time," Theo said with a pout. "Did you and Mommy fight?"

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly. "We didn't fight."

"Then have you forgiven Mommy?" the boy pressed. "She said she did something wrong and you won't forgive her."

Sophia held her breath, eyes fixed on the phone screen.

"That's between adults," Ethan replied flatly.

Theo's voice suddenly trembled. "But Theo only has Mommy now..."

A smug smile curled Sophia's lips. She knew Ethan doted on his nephew.

Sure enough, after a brief silence, his voice came through. "Fine."

"Really? You forgive Mommy?" Theo's eyes lit up.

"Mhm." Ethan's response was curt.

Theo cheered and thrust the phone at Sophia. "Mommy! Uncle Ethan says he forgives you!"

Sophia took the phone, her voice instantly softening. "Ethan, Theo shouldn't have bothered you like this—"

"Take care of him," Ethan interrupted.

"Wait!" she hurried on. "I was wrong last time. I shouldn't have done that. You can yell at me, even hit me if you want—"

"It's in the past." His tone turned icy.

Sophia bit her lip. "That night...did you end up with someone else?"

Her greatest fear was that the spiked drink had gone to Vivian instead.
###Chapter 173

"Sophia Evans!" Ethan Roscente's voice cut through the air like ice.

He ended the call without hesitation. Even one more second of her voice was unbearable.

Sophia kept rambling, unaware. "Ethan, I saw the livestream. Why are you helping that bitch Vivian Laurent? She's clearly using you—"

The dial tone finally registered. The call had been terminated long ago.

Her phone shattered against the floor with a loud crack.

Theo cowered in the corner, trembling. "Mommy..."

"Useless!" Sophia yanked the boy up by his collar. "If you can't win your uncle back, don't even think about eating!"

The child's terrified tears only fueled her rage.

———

Ethan turned to look for Vivian, but she had vanished.

He intercepted Lucas Lefèvre, who was packing up equipment. "Where's Vivian?"

"None of your business." Lucas shoved him away. "An ex should know his place."

Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "So it was you at her place that night?"

Lucas lifted his chin in defiance. "Keep harassing her, and you'll taste my fist."

A crew member informed him Vivian had already left, delegating the remaining tasks.

———

Vivian drove straight to Isabella Langley's apartment.

"Look who graced us." Isabella handed her a glass of ice water. "Triple Six crisis handled?"

"Annoyed." Vivian downed the entire glass in one go.

Isabella arched a brow. "The Valrose family? Or Ethan Roscente?"

"What do you mean?" Vivian sat bolt upright.

"Don't play dumb." Isabella pulled out her phone. "The entire internet's buzzing about your little construction site drama."

Vivian snatched the device. A livestream replay filled the screen.

Her fingers trembled slightly. "So... everyone saw it?"
###Chapter 174

Isabella Langley tossed the tablet onto Vivian Laurent's lap. The glaring headlines on the screen were impossible to ignore.

"Take a look. The top ten trends are all about you." Isabella smirked. "Even Sophia Evans, the A-list celebrity, got overshadowed."

Vivian arched a brow as her fingers glided across the screen.

Public opinion about the building collapse had completely shifted. The hateful comments had turned into gasps of awe. She never expected an accident to become the best PR move.

"Should you make an account?" Isabella pointed at the comments section. "Your fans are begging for it."

Vivian casually registered an account under the handle: "Vivian Laurent—Try Me."

Her first post read: "Wellness class is in session. Lesson one: How to live long enough to keep hating me."

The account exploded instantly. Followers skyrocketed.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Isabella shivered under Vivian's intense gaze.

Vivian blinked. "I'm broke."

"How much?" Isabella reached for her wallet.

"Save it for your own funeral." Vivian sighed. "I need fast cash."

The financial hole at Triple Six Realty was too deep. With the government project about to launch, their funds were drying up.

"Bank robbery?" Isabella suggested seriously.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "I'm thinking of taking a Dark Web contract."

The most lucrative bounties were there. One job could solve everything.

"Aren't you afraid the organization will find out?" Isabella frowned.

"I'll use a burner account." Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Besides, there's someone more suited for this than me."

At the hospital, Nathan Clementson paced anxiously.

"Vivian!" He rushed over. "Do you need money? I have savings."
###Chapter 175

"Don't worry, Nathan. Everything's handled. I have a backup plan if needed."

Vivian's tone was light, but she'd already decided never to touch Ethan's money.

Nathan frowned slightly. "You're close with Mr. Roscente?"

"Would you believe me if I said no?" She took a sip of water.

"He likes you?"

Vivian choked, pounding her chest. "Nathan, what nonsense!"

Ryan pushed the door open, glancing between them. "Dr. Laurent, who likes you?"

"Ignore him." She set down her glass. "Mr. Roscente and I aren't even friends."

Their relationship was more absurd than a soap opera.

Ryan's eyes lit up. "A suitor?"

"Dr. Fairsprene," Vivian warned with a glare. "Stop spreading rumors like Nathan."

"So... is there someone you like now?"

Someone she liked?

Ethan's sharp features flashed through her mind.

"No!" Her denial was firm.

Ryan's lips curved into a smile.

"Dr. Laurent, I have some cases to discuss. Are you free?"

"I have cardiac surgery today. Text me."

He hid his delight—finally an excuse to get her number.

"Go ahead. I'll handle things here." Nathan's voice was gentle.

Vivian nodded and turned to leave.

Passing the inpatient ward, she changed course.

Finn was stuffing clothes into a suitcase when he spotted her in the doorway. His hands trembled.

"G-Grandmaster!"

"Recovering well." She leaned against the doorframe.

"Thanks to your brilliant skills." He forced a smile, cold sweat dripping down his back.

This woman always brought trouble.

"I need money."

Finn clutched his wallet. "I'm broke!"

"Not yours." Her red lips curved. "Do me a favor."

He gulped. "W-what favor?"

"The Dark Web pays well."

His legs weakened. "You want me to take illegal jobs?"

"You take the contracts. I'll do the work." Her tone was blunt. "I keep the money."

"And I...?"

"Expecting a cut?" Vivian narrowed her eyes. "We haven't settled your assassination attempt yet."

Finn looked miserable. "You used the most expensive meds. My hospital bill could buy a sports car."
###Chapter 176

Vivian Laurent arched an eyebrow at Finn Deross.

She had indeed used the best medicine, but her motives weren't pure.

"Do you think I'm trying to harm you?" Her tone was light.

Finn immediately waved his hands. "No, no!"

He finally understood—this woman was not to be trifled with.

"What about taking on missions?"

"No problem!" Finn nodded eagerly.

"And the commission split?"

"Keep it all!" He shook his head like a rattle drum.

Vivian patted his head approvingly. "Good boy."

She added, "Only accept contracts worth over a hundred million. I'll review them first."

"Got it!" Finn's eyes lit up. "Um...can I tag along? I want to learn from you. You're amazing!"

He rubbed his hands excitedly. "You remind me of my idol!"

"Who?"

"Shadow!"

Vivian froze.

She hadn't expected to hear her own codename here.

Seeing her lack of reaction, Finn grew anxious. "The legendary Shadow, ranked second on the Agent Leaderboard! If she hadn't disappeared, Zero would never have taken the top spot!"

His face twisted with anguish. "No one on the Dark Web has been able to surpass her records."

Vivian stayed silent.

She suddenly felt like laughing.

"Maybe I'm better than your idol," Vivian teased.

"Impossible!" Finn jumped to his feet. "Shadow is the strongest!"

Vivian didn't bother arguing. After all, they were the same person.

"Fine, your idol is the best," she waved dismissively. "Focus on securing missions. The sooner, the better."

"Leave it to me!" Finn thumped his chest. "But you have to promise to teach me!"

"Deal."

As Vivian turned to leave, she glanced back. "Keep this between us."

"Understood!"

In the operating room, Vivian was sterilizing her hands.

Today's cardiac surgery had drawn the attention of the entire hospital. The dean stood in the observation area with a group of specialists.

"Dr. Luna, feeling the pressure?" the dean asked quietly.

Vivian didn't look up. "The patient comes first."

She focused on reviewing the medical reports, unaware of the icy gaze fixed on her from the crowd.

Those eyes burned with disdain and hatred.
###Chapter 177

This cardiac surgery was considered the most complex case in the entire city.

Every top cardiovascular specialist had declined to take it.

Yet the one who ultimately accepted this high-risk operation was a female general surgeon.

Whispers filled the observation room. Skeptical gazes pierced through the surgical theater like needles.

Vivian Laurent remained unfazed. She trusted only the truth beneath her scalpel.

After sterilization, she picked up the surgical blade with practiced ease.

Standing nearby, VP Casstevensa smirked coldly. This woman—who'd gotten his granddaughter expelled and his nephew disciplined—dared to attempt a cardiac procedure?

"Ridiculous," he muttered under his breath. "Even after thirty years in cardiology, I wouldn't touch this case..."

The sharp blade glided through skin with terrifying precision.

Cardiac surgery required sternotomy—cutting through the breastbone to access the chest cavity. Her movements were swift and decisive.

"Chest cavity accessed," the nurse announced softly.

Murmurs of astonishment rippled through the observation room.

"That technique... it's flawless."

"She's really just a general surgeon?"

Vivian's hands were steady as stone. The scalpel became an extension of her will, each incision perfectly placed.

"BP normal."

"Heart rate stable."

The monitors emitted rhythmic beeps.

Suddenly, an alarm shattered the silence.

"Blood pressure spiking!"

"190 over 120... 200 over 130... still climbing!"

The nurse's voice turned urgent.

Vivian's gaze sharpened. The critical moment had arrived.
###Chapter 178

"Critical situation! Intracranial pressure spiking! Risk of brain herniation imminent!" The emergency alarm blared through the operating room.

"Dr. Laurent, systolic blood pressure just exceeded 200!"

All eyes locked onto Vivian Laurent. Her slender fingers guided the puncture needle with precision, its tip piercing through a one-millimeter micro-incision.

"Administer antihypertensives. Buy me three minutes."

Assistants scrambled to adjust medication dosages. The blood pressure monitor remained stubbornly unchanged, numbers climbing relentlessly.

"This is outrageous!" VP Casstevensa suddenly barked. "A general surgery rookie leading this high-risk procedure? Did the preoperative risk assessment mean nothing?"

His eyes gleamed with malice. During morning rounds, he'd secretly swapped the patient's antihypertensive medication with vitamin tablets. Those innocuous white pills now dissolved harmlessly in the patient's stomach.

"Dr. Laurent's technique is textbook perfect!" the anesthesiologist countered. "None of us could execute with such precision."

VP Casstevensa smirked. He'd orchestrated this surgical deadlock perfectly. Hypertension combined with cardiac surgery and missing medication—this was divine intervention.

"Brain hemorrhage detected!" The monitor shrieked. "Blood loss exceeding 50ml!"

Chaos erupted. Midway through open-heart surgery, the patient suffered a cerebral bleed. Like encountering a storm while tightrope walking.

"Page neurosurgery!" Vivian's voice remained steady.

"They won't arrive for twenty minutes!" The scrub nurse stamped her foot in frustration.

Behind the observation window, VP Casstevensa's lips curled upward. He could already envision Vivian's professional ruin. How dare this upstart challenge his authority at Central Hospital?

Beads of sweat formed on Vivian's temples. Her hands accelerated suddenly, sutures dancing between cardiac vessels at inhuman speed. The room held its breath.

"Take over the cardiac procedure." She stripped off bloodied gloves. "Prep for craniotomy."

Gasps filled the room. Simultaneous open-heart and brain surgery? This was stealing lives from Death's grasp.

The EKG began erratic patterns. CT scans showed the hemorrhage expanding rapidly. VP Casstevensa's smile widened—the climax approached.

As Vivian lifted the surgical drill, the OR doors burst open. An unexpected figure stood silhouetted in the doorway.
###Chapter 179

"Prepare the craniotomy instruments now." Vivian Laurent's voice was crisp and authoritative.

The operating room erupted in murmurs.

Every eye turned to her in shock. No CT scan. No MRI. Not even basic imaging. Yet she was proceeding directly to brain surgery.

"Dr. Laurent, this is too risky," the anesthesiologist protested. "Shouldn't we wait for the neurology specialist—"

"No time." Vivian cut him off. "Intracranial pressure is rising. Any delay could be fatal."

Her gaze swept across the surgical team.

"Continue with the cardiac sutures. I'll handle the cerebral hemorrhage."

The scrub nurse hesitated before passing the scalpel.

The moment Vivian grasped the instrument, her entire demeanor transformed. Those usually gentle eyes turned razor-sharp.

She made the first incision with practiced precision.

"Bone drill."

The whirring sound sent bone fragments flying. Every surgeon in the room held their breath.

"Gigli saw."

Vivian's movements were unnervingly accurate. No hesitation—as if she could visualize every blood vessel inside the patient's skull.

When the bone flap lifted, dark clots came into view.

"Subdural hematoma," Vivian murmured.

She began meticulously evacuating the blood mass. Each cut was calculated—relieving pressure without damaging brain tissue.

In the observation gallery, someone gasped.

"How is she... One wrong move—"

"Silence!" VP Casstevensa snapped. "Pay attention."

But his expression grew increasingly conflicted. This woman who'd ruined his granddaughter's career was demonstrating surgical skills even he had to admit...

Were flawless.

Beads of sweat formed on Vivian's forehead, but her hands remained steady.

"Blood pressure rising!" The monitor chimed.

A collective exhale filled the OR.

"She actually... saved him?"

Vivian ignored the reactions. Her focus never wavered from the delicate neural structures.

"Prepare to close."

When she finally set down her instruments, her scrubs were drenched.

But the patient's vitals had stabilized.

In the gallery, someone began clapping. Soon, applause filled the room.

Only VP Casstevensa remained motionless, face unreadable.

His fists clenched as he stared through the glass.

Just how many hidden talents did this Vivian Laurent possess?
###Chapter 180

Under the surgical lights, beads of sweat glistened on Vivian Laurent's forehead.

Her scalpel made a precise incision through the patient's skull, revealing grayish brain tissue.

"Something's wrong." Her brows furrowed slightly.

A tumor was pressing against a critical neural region.

"Prepare the neurosurgical instruments." She issued the order without looking up.

The nurses exchanged glances but quickly handed over the requested tools.

Dr. Zachary Kalmien rushed to the operating theater.

"Outrageous!" He banged on the glass window. "How dare a general surgeon perform a craniotomy?"

"Dr. Kalmien, it's Dr. Laurent..." A nurse stammered.

"I don't care who she is!" He angrily pulled on sterile scrubs.

When he burst into the OR, the sight left him speechless.

Vivian's fingers moved with the grace of a pianist, the tumor already cleanly excised.

"This..." Dr. Kalmien's eyes widened.

He'd never witnessed such flawless neurosurgery.

Even more astonishing, Vivian was simultaneously performing cardiac surgery.

Both complex procedures flowed seamlessly under her skilled hands.

"BP stable."

"HR normal."

The anesthesiologist continued reporting reassuring numbers.

Four and a half hours later, Vivian finally set down her instruments.

"Successful procedure." She announced quietly.

The OR erupted in applause.

Dr. Kalmien approached eagerly. "Dr. Laurent, how did you—"

Vivian removed her mask, revealing a tired but calm smile. "The patient wanted to live. I simply helped."

News spread through the hospital like wildfire.

"Dr. Laurent performed craniotomy and thoracotomy simultaneously!"

"Completed in under five hours!"

"It's a medical miracle!"

VP Casstevensa shattered his teacup in his office.

He glared at the surgical records on his computer, face dark with fury.

Meanwhile, Vivian was checking on her patient.

"Vitals stable." She nodded in satisfaction.

Dr. Kalmien caught up to her, eyes shining. "Dr. Laurent, join our neurosurgery department!"

She shook her head. "I prefer general surgery."

"But your neurosurgical skills—"

"Just happened to know a bit." Vivian replied mildly.

In the hospital corridors, nurses buzzed with excitement.

"Dr. Laurent is incredible!"

"Multiple hospitals are inquiring about her!"

Vivian walked past the chatter without reaction.

Her lab coat pocket held the next patient's chart.
###Chapter 181

Vivian Laurent had just set down her scalpel when Dr. Zachary Kalmien from the Cardiology Department blocked the doorway.

"Dr. Laurent, join our department!" Dr. Kalmien's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Double the salary, priority surgical scheduling."

Vivian wiped the sweat from her brow, offering a polite smile. "I'm quite content in General Surgery, Dr. Kalmien."

"Those brutes in General Surgery don’t appreciate talent!" Dr. Kalmien stomped his foot in frustration. "A genius like you belongs in Cardiology."

Footsteps echoed down the hallway.

Dr. Wang from Hepatobiliary Surgery rushed over, panting. "Dr. Laurent, we need a deputy director—perfect timing for you!"

"Wang, what are you playing at?" Dr. Kalmien glared.

Vivian subtly retreated, seizing the moment of their argument to slip into the elevator.

Back in the General Surgery Department, she collapsed into her chair with a relieved sigh.

Nathan Clementson handed her a glass of water. "Was that a consultation or a battlefield?"

"Worse than a battlefield." Vivian drained the glass in one go. "If anyone asks for me, tell them I'm unavailable."

Before Nathan could respond, the nurse station phone rang.

"Dr. Laurent!" A nurse called out. "Oncology, Neurosurgery, and Respiratory Medicine are all asking for you!"

Vivian immediately ducked under her desk, shooting Nathan a pleading look.

Nathan reluctantly picked up the phone. "Ah, Dr. Laurent is... in the restroom."

That afternoon, Nathan witnessed what could only be described as a "talent war."

"Dr. Laurent belongs to General Surgery!" The department chief slammed his fist on the table. "Anyone else trying to poach her will get their surgeries scheduled at midnight!"

Ryan Fairsprene stood in the corner, clutching a medical chart, his eyes shining as he watched Vivian.

"Dr. Laurent, your surgery yesterday was incredible," he whispered. "May I learn from you?"

Vivian looked up, offering a warm smile. "Of course. You have real potential."

Ryan's face flushed crimson to the tips of his ears.

......

At the Roscente Group's top-floor office, Ethan Roscente stared at his computer screen, scrolling through the hospital forum's discussions about Vivian.

"Genius Surgeon."
"Once-in-a-century medical prodigy."
"An artist in the operating room."

His fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk.

The timid wife who once deferred to him had become the hospital's most sought-after talent.

His phone buzzed—a message from a hospital contact: "Ethan, your ex-wife got cornered by five department heads today."

Ethan's lips curved involuntarily.

He opened his photo album, pulling up a wedding picture. Vivian in her wedding dress, her smile shy and soft.

Now, her gaze on the operating table was sharp as a blade—a completely different person.

"How many more secrets do you have?" he murmured.

Outside, city lights flickered to life, stretching his shadow long across the floor.

Someone who was once within reach now shone like a distant star—brilliant yet untouchable.

Ethan shut his laptop and grabbed his suit jacket.

Suddenly, he wanted to see the woman who intrigued him more by the day.
###Chapter 182

Vivian Laurent's apartment was shrouded in darkness, the curtains tightly drawn. The relentless media frenzy had forced her to work from home.

Finn Deross had been summoned as a temporary assistant, currently sifting through Dark Web contracts on her behalf. His gaze kept drifting toward Vivian, brimming with curiosity.

"Focus." Vivian tapped the desk without looking up.

Finn finally blurted out, "The hospital incident is all over the news. Who exactly are you?"

"Vivian Laurent. 26. Female." Her reply was dismissive.

"I mean your skills!" Finn leaned closer. "Medical expertise is one thing, but you're scarily proficient with Dark Web contracts too."

A smirk curled Vivian's lips. "How else could I be your mentor?"

"Then take me as your apprentice!" Finn's eyes lit up.

"Get in line." Vivian swiped through the screen. "The queue of wannabe disciples could circle the city three times."

Finn huffed. "I'm a top-fifty expert on the Dark Web!"

"Remind me—who was it that got outplayed by me last time?" She arched a brow.

Finn chuckled awkwardly. "That was a fluke... Anyway, are you sure about these?" He pointed to several high-risk contracts highlighted in red.

One stood out—intercepting an arms shipment from the Integrity Group in North America.

"Two hundred million commission. Worth a shot." Vivian clicked to accept.

Finn paled. "Are you insane? The Integrity Group is the largest syndicate in North America!"

Vivian studied him with interest. "You're well-informed."

"Just... doing my homework." Finn gulped his water, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Vivian swiftly pulled up a dossier. "Their leader goes by Dominic Atlante. Quite the enigma."

She suddenly looked up. "Same surname as you. Any relation?"

Finn choked on his drink.
###Chapter 183

Finn Deross paled instantly, waving his hands frantically. "Misunderstanding! Someone like me could never be connected to such an important figure. There are thousands of people with the surname Deross in Riverdale. If I had those kinds of connections, would I really be scraping by taking contracts on the Dark Web?"

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he spoke rapidly. Vivian Laurent arched an eyebrow but didn't press further.

"Just joking. Why so nervous?" She returned to studying Dominic Atlante's file.

Finn stole glances at her expression. Seeing no suspicion, he exhaled slightly in relief.

This mission had been Vivian's initiative. If it went south, he wouldn't dare face his uncle's wrath. Just imagining Dominic's icy gaze sent chills down Finn's spine.

Using Finn's account, Vivian accepted the contract and immediately began investigating. The Triple Six Realty crisis had been resolved—media fallout handled, homeowner protests settled. She'd personally inspected all construction materials, hired veteran project supervisors, and had Isabella Langley overseeing everything. The situation was airtight.

"Master..." Finn sidled up, blinking pitifully. "I've got nowhere to go after being discharged. Could I maybe—"

"Not a chance."

"You'd make me sleep under a bridge?"

"Should I send you back to the hospital right now?"

Finn's eyes darted. "I'll pay rent! Or I'll report you to the Dark Web for hijacking my account!"

Vivian narrowed her eyes. Though the threat meant nothing, Finn had his uses. She gave a reluctant nod.

"Ten thousand a month."

"Highway robbery!" Finn's eyes widened.

"Take it or leave it."

"Fine!" He gritted his teeth. What he could learn from Vivian was worth far more than ten grand.

At dawn, Vivian flew overseas for the mission. Despite her hiatus, the skills were second nature. She packed equipment efficiently, instructing Finn to house-sit while assigning Lucas Lefèvre and Isabella to manage company affairs.

Five days passed without Vivian's call appearing in Ethan Roscente's call log. The hospital reported Dr. Laurent's unexplained absence, while only Lucas remained at the construction site. Ethan checked racing events and AN Atelier's schedule—no trace of her.

His phone chimed again: "The number you dialed is unavailable."

Ethan shot up, bolting out without his suit jacket. The elevator took too long—he took the stairs three at a time.

In the parking garage, his black sports car roared to life. Ethan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. He needed to see Vivian now. Not a second longer.
###Chapter 184

The night was pitch black. Ethan Roscente's car idled outside Vivian Laurent's apartment building.

The warm yellow light spilling from her windows stung his eyes.

He took the steps two at a time, jamming his finger against the doorbell.

The chime echoed for what felt like an eternity.

"Who is it?" A young man's voice called from inside.

The door cracked open.

Finn Deross rubbed his sleepy eyes, blinking at the impeccably dressed Ethan standing on the doorstep.

"Can I help you?" Finn asked, his guard up.

Ethan's gaze drilled into Finn.

The stranger wore pajamas, his hair tousled from sleep.

Why was he in Vivian's apartment?

"Where's Vivian?" Ethan's voice could freeze hell.

Finn yawned. "Not here."

"Who are you?" Ethan's eyes narrowed.

"I live here." Finn shrugged.

Ethan's fists clenched involuntarily.

"What's your relationship with Vivian?"

"Roommates." Finn leaned lazily against the doorframe. "You still haven't told me who you are."

A vein throbbed in Ethan's temple.

"Ethan Roscente."

Finn's eyes widened. "Oh! Now I remember!"

Ethan's pulse quickened.

"You're that guy from the rumors..." Finn scratched his head. "Vivian said not to let you in."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"She actually said that?"

Finn nodded. "Told me to say she's out if you showed up."

Ethan let out a cold laugh. "Move."

"What are you—" Finn blocked the doorway.

"I said, move." Each word was a bullet.

Finn recoiled from the sheer intensity, stepping aside instinctively.

Ethan strode past him into the apartment.

The living room stood empty except for two half-finished bubble teas on the coffee table.

"She really isn't here," Finn said, trailing behind.

Ethan's eyes swept every corner.

"How long have you two lived together?"

"Not long." Finn scratched his head again. "You need her for something?"

Ethan ignored the question.

His attention locked onto a man's jacket draped over the sofa.

"This yours?"

Finn nodded. "Yeah."

Ethan's breathing grew ragged.

"When will Vivian be back?"

"Dunno." Finn spread his hands. "She's on a business trip."

Ethan whirled, grabbing Finn by the collar.

"The truth!"

Finn gasped for air. "I...I'm telling the truth..."

Ethan released him, eyes stormy.

"Tell her I'll be back."

Without another word, he slammed the door behind him.

Finn massaged his throat, exhaling sharply.

"Vivian wasn't kidding. That guy's seriously intense."
###Chapter 185
Ethan's Obsession

The villa was eerily silent when Ethan pushed open the front door. His footsteps echoed through the empty space.

He scanned the living room. Not a soul in sight.

"Where is everyone?"

Finn peeked out from the kitchen, a half-eaten sandwich in hand.

"No idea." He swallowed his food. "Call her yourself."

Ethan narrowed his eyes at the young man.

Finn couldn't be older than twenty, his gaze still bright with youthful naivety.

Lucas was younger than Vivian. Now there was Finn too.

A realization struck Ethan—Vivian was constantly surrounded by younger men.

The thought twisted something in his chest.

At thirty-five, he carried himself with mature sophistication.

Yet for the first time, he felt the sting of age.

"What's your relationship with her?" Ethan's voice turned icy.

Finn shrugged. "None of your business. Leave a message or get lost."

Ethan strode to the couch and sat.

"I'm staying."

Finn nearly choked on his sandwich. "What?"

"Prepare a guest room." Ethan's tone brooked no argument. "Unless Vivian personally throws me out."

Somehow, Finn found himself climbing the stairs.

Only when standing outside the guest room with a broom did he snap out of it—why was he obeying this man?

He fumbled for his phone.

«Boss, Ethan's refusing to leave!»

The reply came moments later.

«Let him.»

Finn groaned and collapsed onto the bed.

Downstairs, Ethan watched the clock's hands complete another rotation.

"Where did she go?"

Finn rolled his eyes. "Vacation. Won't be back anytime soon."

Ethan frowned.

The excuse was too flimsy.

Unreachable by phone. Disappearing without a trace.

This wasn't like Vivian.

Meanwhile, at the warehouse district's outskirts...

Vivian perched on a tree branch, night-vision goggles revealing a dozen patrolling guards.

Her final mission: stealing from under Dominic's nose.

Her fingers brushed the equipment at her waist.

As long as she avoided direct confrontation...

The odds were still in her favor.
###Chapter 186

The surveillance drone had circled the warehouse for three straight days. Vivian Laurent noted every guard's shift rotation in her notebook, even counting how many times they chewed during meals.

"Shipment moves out tomorrow! Stay sharp!" Scar Lowell ran a finger along his facial scar, scanning the perimeter with hawk-like intensity.

One thug sneered around his cigarette. "Those military cowards wouldn't dare show up."

Twenty armed men patrolled the compound. Infrared sensors glinted under moonlight while surveillance cameras rotated in seamless arcs.

Perched on a tree branch, Vivian flexed fingers around silver needles. At precisely 7 PM, she pressed the detonator.

BOOM—

Flames erupted from the southeast corner. Smoke laced with odorless knockout gas engulfed half the warehouse.

"Breach!" Five guards charged toward the explosion only to collapse mid-stride.

Scar drew his pistol. "Second team! Gas masks on!"

Seven figures advanced in tactical formation. Vivian smirked, severing a rope with a flick of her wrist. White powder snowed down, neutralizing the filters instantly.

Tranquilizer darts found their marks. As the last guard dropped, Scar's radio crackled to life.

"Come in? Hello?" Static answered. His eyes bulged when a slender figure emerged from shadows.

Moonlight outlined the girl's silhouette. She kicked aside discarded weapons, her black combat suit emphasizing lean muscle.

"Goodnight." Vivian pulled the trigger just as Scar recognized the starlight in her eyes.

Every alarm in the warehouse died simultaneously. Security feeds froze on a lone figure inspecting the arsenal, surrounded by unconscious bodies.
###Chapter 187

Three AM. The night was pitch black.

Vivian Laurent stood on the warehouse rooftop, the wind tugging at her hair. She glanced at her wristwatch. Five minutes until the operation began.

A voice crackled in her earpiece. "Surveillance systems hacked. Guard rotation confirmed."

"Move out," she ordered curtly.

Three helicopters descended soundlessly behind the warehouse. Highly trained agents swiftly loaded the cargo and vanished within fifteen minutes.

As dawn tinged the horizon, Scar Lowell groaned awake. He staggered to his feet, finding the warehouse doors wide open and completely empty.

"Where's the shipment?!" His roar echoed through the hollow space.

His men stirred groggily, exchanging confused looks. Trembling, Scar dialed Dominic Atlante.

"Boss... we have a problem."

At the Integrity Group headquarters, top-floor office.

Dominic slammed his fist on the desk, splitting the solid wood. "What did you say?"

Scar's voice shook. "The shipment... it's all gone."

"Useless!" Dominic hurled his phone against the wall, shattering it. He yanked open a drawer and pulled out a pistol, cocking it with a sharp click.

His assistant hesitantly offered a backup phone. "Sir, should we alert the authorities?"

"Authorities?" Dominic's laugh was icy. "You want the whole city knowing Dominic Atlante got robbed?"

His fingers traced the gun barrel thoughtfully. "Find them. Tear this city apart if you have to."

Meanwhile, at an abandoned factory on the outskirts.

Vivian finished inventorying the last crate, a satisfied smirk playing on her lips. Finn Deross's frantic voice buzzed in her earpiece. "Are you insane? That was my uncle's shipment!"

"And?" She casually wiped down her pistol.

Finn sounded ready to combust. "He'll track you down in three days and carve you into pieces!"

Vivian chuckled, holstering her weapon. "Let him try."

Outside the window, the sun breached the horizon. This game was just beginning.
###Chapter 188

Finn was thoroughly impressed.

The legendary master truly lived up to her reputation.

He wondered how his uncle was handling the situation—probably furious enough to stomp around.

"When are you coming back?" Finn pressed, oblivious to the figure approaching behind him.

"Soon."

"Hurry up, then."

He felt like a trapped animal at home, especially around Ethan Roscente. The man's presence made his skin crawl.

Ethan usually kept to himself, only appearing in the evenings. Every time those piercing eyes landed on him, Finn's spine tingled with unease.

The moment he hung up, Finn turned and collided with a solid wall of muscle.

"Ah!" He clutched his chest, nearly leaping out of his skin.

"How long have you been standing there? How much did you hear?"

Ethan had only caught the tail end of the conversation. He'd noticed Finn sneaking around and guessed he was talking to Vivian.

"When is Vivian returning?"

"Soon."

"Good." Ethan nodded.

Finally.

His gaze swept across the villa, then narrowed at Finn. "Doesn't this place seem filthy to you?"

"Filthy?" Finn blinked.

"Clean it. Top to bottom. Before she gets back."

"Why me?" Finn scowled.

"She dislikes mess." Ethan's eyes darkened. "Unless you'd prefer a beating instead?"

Finn studied him suspiciously. "What exactly is your relationship with Vivian?"

This man knew Vivian's habits yet acted like they were sworn enemies.

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "I'm her husband."

Though technically her ex-husband, the marriage had been real.

"What?" Finn's eyes bulged. "You're really her husband?" The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "No way! Vivian's not blind—why would she marry you?"

"Care to repeat that?" The temperature in the room plummeted.

Since when was being with him equivalent to poor eyesight?

Finn suddenly found the ceiling fascinating. "Ah, bedtime!" He bolted upstairs before Ethan could react.

The moment he shut his bedroom door, his phone rang. His hand trembled at the caller ID.

Uncle Dominic.

This was it—the jig was up. Vivian's secret was out, and now his uncle was coming for him.

When the call went unanswered, a text appeared:
"Ignoring me? Should I come fetch you myself?"

Just reading it made Finn break out in a cold sweat.

He immediately called back. The line connected instantly.

"Uncle! What's up?" Finn forced cheer into his voice.

Dominic cut straight to the point. "I just lost a shipment."

Finn's stomach dropped. So it had begun.

He feigned ignorance. "What? How could your shipment go missing? Lazy subordinates? Big loss? Any leads? Don't stress—health comes first!"
###Chapter 189 

"Was it you?" Dominic Atlante's voice cut through the phone line like ice.

Finn Deross nearly dropped his phone.

"Uncle, I'm in Country C right now. Check the flight records if you don't believe me!"

He swallowed hard, forcing himself to sound calm.

"There's a contract on the Dark Web to retrieve those stolen arms." Dominic's tone remained flat. "Someone took it three days ago."

Finn's back prickled with cold sweat.

"Is... is that so?" He forced a laugh. "I had no idea."

"No idea?" Dominic's冷笑 was audible. "Then why was it accepted through your account?"

Finn froze.

"How... how did you get my account details?" His voice shook.

The Dark Web's security was world-class. How had his uncle breached it?

"That's not your concern." Dominic's voice dropped dangerously. "Tell me who took the job."

"My account was hacked!" Finn blurted. "You know I don't have those kinds of skills."

He'd been terrified of this uncle since childhood, despite their mere five-year age gap.

"True. You're incompetent." Dominic's words were razor-sharp. "I want the perpetrator's name."

Few people in the world could pull off such a flawless arms heist without leaving traces.

Finn's palms were drenched.

"I really don't know..." His voice dwindled.

"Think carefully." Dominic's tone turned lethal. "If it's one of your friends, I'll spare them."

Finn gritted his teeth.

"Uncle, I swear I don't know! Gotta go!"

He hung up, only then realizing his shirt was soaked through.

He'd just burned bridges with the most dangerous man he knew.

Stumbling downstairs, he gulped water straight from the pitcher, startling Ethan Roscente in the living room.

"See a ghost?" Ethan frowned.

"N-nothing." Finn waved him off and fled back upstairs.

Three days later, Vivian Laurent pushed open the villa door, exhausted but triumphant.

This mission had paid handsomely.

The house was silent. She crept into the bedroom without turning on the lights.

"Dead tired..." She collapsed onto the bed.

Thump!

A muffled groan came from beneath her.

Vivian sprang upright.

"Who's there?"
###Chapter 190

Vivian pushed open the door and immediately sensed something unusual in the room.

Her fingers quickly found the light switch on the wall.

As the lights flickered on, the tall silhouette of a man came into view.

Ethan Roscente sat on the edge of her bed, his pajama collar slightly open to reveal sharp collarbones.

He raised a hand to rub his temples, clearly startled by the sudden brightness.

His usually immaculate hair now fell softly across his forehead, casting delicate shadows.

"What are you doing here?" Vivian's voice carried suspicion.

Ethan lowered his arm and met her gaze with burning intensity.

"Waiting for you."

Two simple words that sent an unexpected tremor through her.

Her eyes caught the faint outline of muscles beneath his pajamas, making her look away.

"Did waiting require lying on my bed?"

Ethan stood up, the hem of his pajamas swaying gently.

"I fell asleep by accident."

He took two steps closer and suddenly frowned.

"You've lost weight."

Vivian instinctively touched her cheek.

Days of relentless missions had drained her completely. All she wanted was to collapse into bed.

"We'll talk tomorrow."

She moved past him toward the bed, too exhausted to even remove her jacket.

Ethan remained motionless.

For days, he'd felt an emptiness inside that only disappeared when he saw Vivian.

"Fine."

As he turned to leave, the sound of steady breathing stopped him.

Glancing back, he found Vivian already curled up in sleep.

Ethan exhaled softly and returned to the bedside.

With utmost care, he removed her shoes as if handling fragile porcelain.

His fingers accidentally brushed against her ankle—icy cold to the touch.

His brow furrowed as he reached to pull the blanket over her.

Just as he leaned down, Vivian's eyes flew open, her hand snapping around his wrist.

Their gazes locked until the wariness in her eyes gradually faded.

She released him, rolled over, and sank back into sleep.

Ethan stood watching her peaceful face, transfixed.

Moonlight streamed through the window, bathing them both in its silver glow.
###Chapter 191

Ethan Roscente gazed at Vivian Laurent's exhausted sleeping face, his heart softening.

He knew this trip wasn't just a simple vacation for her. But with her stubborn nature, she'd never reveal a single detail to him.

Gently, he removed her shoes and carefully carried her to the center of the bed. He adjusted the air conditioning to a comfortable temperature and meticulously tucked her in.

He stood by the bedside, watching her for a long moment before finally turning off the light and leaving.

The next morning at ten, Vivian finally woke up. The familiar bedding brought her immense comfort.

As she descended the stairs, she saw two men locked in a glaring contest.

"Master—I mean, Teacher!" Finn Deross's eyes lit up, nearly slipping up. He quickly corrected himself in front of the outsider.

Ethan raised an eyebrow. Teacher? What was this kid planning to learn from Vivian? Medicine?

"Come eat breakfast." Ethan was spreading jam on a slice of toast with elegant precision.

Finn stared at him in surprise. This man wasn't the least bit shocked that Vivian had returned?

Vivian walked down the stairs, her eyes sweeping over Ethan. So last night hadn't been a dream—this man had really barged into her room.

"Why are you still here?" She approached the dining table.

Ethan handed her a slice of toast slathered with strawberry jam. Vivian took it and began eating hungrily.

"He's here too," Ethan said, glancing at Finn.

Finn cleared his throat. "I'm not the same as you. Right, Teacher?" He tested the title, hoping for Vivian's approval.

Vivian didn't deny the address. She turned to Ethan. "You've been staying here so long. Have you paid rent?"

"How much?" Ethan didn't hesitate.

"Two hundred thousand," Finn blurted out, calculating that it might cover his own rent too.

Ethan immediately ordered the transfer.

"Enough." Vivian tapped the table. "You're moving out today."

"What about him?" Ethan looked at Finn.

"He's my apprentice. My person. What are you?"

Ethan fell silent for a moment before suddenly speaking. "I could be your person too."

Vivian nearly choked on her toast. What kind of nonsense was this man spouting so early in the morning? She still hadn't settled the score with him for taking her bed last night!
###Chapter 192

Vivian Laurent threw Ethan Roscente's luggage out the door with a cold expression.

Ethan stood at the doorway, hesitating to speak.

"I'll go in a week." Vivian crossed her arms. "Now leave."

Ethan opened his mouth. "It's not because of Sophia Evans—"

"Doesn't matter." Vivian cut him off. "Just notify me when the flight's booked."

She turned to slam the door.

Ethan braced his arm against the frame. "We need to talk."

"About what?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "About you telling everyone I'm your wife?"

Ethan froze.

Finn Deross peeked from the living room. "Master, is he really your husband?"

"No!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "Next person who spreads rumors gets their legs broken."

Ethan cleared his throat. "I only—"

"Get out." Vivian slammed the door shut.

Finn shrank back. "Master's terrifying."

Vivian massaged her temples. "Stop yapping. Go get the books from the study."

She opened her laptop to check the account balance.

Five hundred million dollars sat untouched.

"Master, you're amazing!" Finn staggered under a stack of books. "Half a month's earnings!"

Vivian closed the laptop. "Emergency funds only."

"Why still work at the hospital?" Finn frowned. "Missions pay better."

Vivian grabbed her car keys. "Saving lives and making money are different things."

She shrugged on her jacket.

"Where to?" Finn chased her to the door.

"Construction site." Vivian didn't look back. "Don't bother me until you've finished those."

Meanwhile, smoke curled through Zero's office.

"Any leads?" Zero stubbed out his cigarette.

His subordinate shook his head. "Dark Web's encryption is impenetrable."

"Keep digging." Zero narrowed his eyes at the blurry surveillance screenshot.

"This person..."

He exhaled slowly.

"Looks just like her."

The subordinate blinked. "Who?"

Zero uttered two syllables:

"Shadow."
###Chapter 193

Zero was staring blankly at his computer screen when the communicator emitted a sharp beep.

"Zero. The Director wants to see you."

The mechanical voice sounded cold and impersonal.

DarkKingdom—this behemoth lurking in the underworld was the nightmare of countless fugitives. As the world's most secretive assassination organization, they controlled countless shady dealings.

Most members were orphans kidnapped as children. In the lightless training camps, only the strongest survived. The losers faced two fates: being tossed into the incinerator or becoming live target practice.

Zero was among the elite. Having clawed his way through mountains of corpses, he now ranked among the organization's top three operatives.

Pushing open the heavy metal door, he entered a room illuminated only by the eerie blue glow of monitors. A figure sat with its back to him, swiveling in a chair.

"Integrity Group's arms shipment was hijacked."

The raspy voice grated like sandpaper.

Zero's pupils contracted slightly.

"I heard."

"Your thoughts?"

His fingers tapped absently against his thigh.

"Whoever pulled this off under Dominic Atlante's nose isn't amateur. I checked the Dark Web's top twenty—none of them did it."

A metallic clinking sound filled the room. The Director was flipping a coin.

"We've trained many promising recruits over the years. Yet none could surpass that one."

Zero's breath hitched.

"Shadow..."

The name stabbed his heart like a blade.

"Do you think she's still alive?"

The coin hit the floor with a jarring clatter.

"That plane crash..." Zero's voice trembled slightly. "The entire aircraft was blown to pieces."

The flickering monitor light cast pale reflections across Zero's face.

Shadow—the eternal legend of the Dark Web rankings. She'd proven with her skills that in the world of killing, gender was never a barrier.

"You two were close." The Director's tone held probing intent. "If she were alive..."

"I'd know."

Zero's reply was absolute.

The air turned glacial. After a long pause, the Director finally spoke.

"Monitor Integrity Group. Find this person."

Zero understood the unspoken order—if the perpetrator posed a threat, eliminate them permanently.

As he exited, Zero's fingers brushed the blade concealed in his sleeve. The last gift Shadow had given him.
###Chapter 194

Dominic Atlante Makes His Appearance

Vivian Laurent stepped through the doors of Triple Six Realty. Inside the conference room, Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre were deep in discussion over a project.

The moment Isabella spotted Vivian, she quickly dismissed Lucas.

"What's wrong?" Vivian noticed the gravity in Isabella's expression.

"Your recent missions are too dangerous," Isabella whispered urgently.

Vivian shrugged. "The real estate projects are expensive. I'm using Finn's account. No one will suspect me."

"The Secret Organization knows everything about you. If they capture you—"

Vivian cut her off. "They won't trace it back to me. Not yet."

"Why not just ask Ethan Roscente for money? You're entitled to half the assets from the divorce," Isabella suggested.

"We're done. Completely." Vivian's tone was firm.

Isabella sighed. "Can you really sever all ties with him?"

"That's exactly why I need to keep my distance." Vivian's gaze drifted away.

As evening fell, Vivian finished her work and headed home.

A sleek black Maybach sat parked near the entrance of her neighborhood. Its elegant lines caught her eye for a moment.

Pushing open her front door, she was met with an unnerving silence.

Finn Deross stood facing the wall like a scolded schoolboy.

"What are you doing?" Vivian raised an eyebrow.

Finn frantically gestured toward the sofa with his eyes.

There, a man in a tailored suit sat perfectly composed. His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest, exuding an aura of quiet authority.

"Your guardian?" Vivian studied the stranger.

Finn hissed under his breath, "My uncle."

Vivian's face lit up with realization. "Oh! Uncle Dominic. You look remarkably young."

Finn buried his face in his hands.

The man slowly lifted his gaze, his sharp eyes locking onto Vivian. "Dr. Laurent. I've heard so much about you."

Finn's back was already slick with sweat. His uncle, Dominic Atlante, showing up in person could only mean trouble.

When Dominic had suddenly appeared at the villa earlier that day, Finn had nearly lost his composure. He hadn't disclosed his location, yet his uncle had found him with terrifying precision.

Even more unsettling was the way Dominic's hawk-like eyes gleamed when he mentioned "Dr. Laurent"—a glint that sent chills down Finn's spine.
###Chapter 195

Dominic Atlante gave a slight nod.

His gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent, a flicker of surprise flashing in his eyes.

The woman was strikingly beautiful.

Her slender frame was a far cry from the image of someone capable of hijacking a massive shipment.

Dominic's eyes darkened briefly before returning to normal.

No need to rush. The cat-and-mouse game would be more fun played slowly.

Finn Deross quickly explained, "This is my uncle."

That made sense.

Finn was in his early twenties, but this man appeared no older than thirty.

Vivian didn't know Dominic Atlante, but her instincts told her he was no ordinary man.

"Mr. Atlante," Vivian greeted politely.

Dominic's piercing gaze remained fixed on her. Vivian met his eyes without flinching.

As the leader of the North American Syndicate, most people trembled in his presence. Yet this woman's calm demeanor was as unreadable as still water.

"I hear you've been looking after my nephew," Dominic said, his voice low and rough. "This boy has always been trouble."

"Finn is quite capable. He hasn't caused any issues."

"Our family is based overseas. I happened to be in town and thought I'd check on him." Dominic paused. "I hope you'll continue to keep an eye on him."

Vivian's lips curved slightly, though her eyes revealed nothing. "You flatter me, Mr. Atlante. Finn is a grown man."

"Finn insists on learning from you, especially since you work at the hospital." Dominic tapped the table lightly. "We feel better knowing he's under your guidance."

"I wouldn't call it teaching. He's just assisting me." Vivian's smile deepened. "If you don't object, I can certainly... challenge him further."

Dominic nodded. "I'd appreciate that."

As the conversation ended, Dominic stood to leave.

Only then did Vivian notice how tall he was. She wondered how he compared to Ethan Roscente.

"Uncle, let me walk you out," Finn offered hastily.

Once outside, the two men entered a sleek black car parked by the curb.

"You startled me, showing up like that," Finn admitted. "I thought—"

"You thought I'd kill her?" Dominic's eyes turned icy.

The idea had crossed Finn's mind. Dominic's sudden appearance was completely unexpected.

As the Atlante heir, Finn's every move was monitored. He'd believed his activities on the Dark Web were secret, unaware his account had been under surveillance.

With Integrity Group's stolen shipment linked to Finn's account, Dominic had come to investigate personally.

This woman, Vivian Laurent, was far more complex than she appeared.

A renowned surgeon, a real estate mogul, and closely connected to the Roscente Group CEO.

She was likely the mastermind behind it all.
###Chapter 196

"Do I look like a serial killer?" Dominic Atlante narrowed his eyes.

Finn Deross swallowed hard.

The question didn't require an answer.

"Of course not, Uncle." He forced himself to speak. "Then... you won't hurt her?"

"No."

Integrity Group could afford to lose a shipment of arms.

But this woman had piqued his interest.

Better to recruit her than make an enemy.

"Thank you, Uncle." Finn exhaled in relief.

Dominic lit a cigarette, his gaze inscrutable through the smoke.

Having Finn follow Vivian Laurent wasn't a bad idea.

The boy could learn from her while keeping tabs.

Two birds with one stone.

When Finn returned to the living room, Vivian was still on the sofa.

"Master."

"Your uncle left?"

"Yeah."

"What's his name?"

Finn stiffened.

"He... his name is Rainier Valence." He blurted out the first alias that came to mind.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Rainier Valence?"

The kid's lie was almost convincing.

She'd already guessed the truth.

Finn's terrified reaction had been telling enough.

That man reeked of blood—an odor impossible to mask.

And his familiarity with Integrity Group's operations?

Only Dominic Atlante fit the description.

Since he hadn't revealed himself, she'd play along.

She'd cross that bridge when she came to it.

......

A week later, Vivian kept her appointment to examine Sophia Evans.

Ethan Roscente personally drove to pick her up.

"Breakfast." He handed her a paper bag.

After instructing Finn to watch the house, Vivian got in the car.

"That boy is still living with you?" Ethan frowned.

"Problem?"

"A man and woman alone together—it's inappropriate."

Vivian nearly laughed.

Ten Finns combined couldn't take her in a fight.

"Since when does the mighty CEO have so much free time?"

"Only for your affairs."
###Chapter 197

The private jet cruised smoothly at thirty thousand feet.

Vivian Laurent leaned against the leather seat, her fingers drumming impatiently on the armrest.

"I don't need your special treatment." She shot a cold glance at the offered juice.

Ethan Roscente paused mid-air before placing the glass on her tray table.

"The designer exhibition in Eudora is worth seeing," he remarked casually.

"My schedule isn't your concern."

Vivian plugged in her headphones and maxed out her tablet's brightness. Sketches of her latest gown design flickered across the screen, the lines still imperfect.

Ethan's gaze drifted from his documents.

He noticed the faint dimple that appeared when Vivian bit her lower lip in concentration. Her stylus moved in absent circles like a lazy cat kneading.

His throat tightened involuntarily.

The cabin air suddenly felt stifling. Ethan loosened his tie but only grew warmer.

Vivian looked up, catching his lingering stare.

"Too much free time, Mr. Roscente?"

"Reviewing proposals." He hastily lowered his eyes to the files where numbers had blurred into gibberish.

Vivian scoffed, pulling the blanket tighter.

She didn't see Ethan carefully retrieving the slipped blanket later, handling it like fragile porcelain.

His fingers hovered a breath from her hair before retreating to tuck the edges neatly.

When the attendant brought dinner, Ethan silenced her with a finger to his lips.

"Let her sleep."

His untouched steak grew cold as he watched Vivian's lashes flutter with each breath, casting delicate shadows.

During turbulence, she instinctively curled deeper into the blanket.

Ethan's hand shot out to steady her shoulder, lingering long after the shaking stopped. The residual warmth made him clench his fist.

"'AN Atelier design inspiration'..." He read the filename on her tablet, lips quirking upward.

So this was how she worked. Forehead creasing in focus, eyes brightening with breakthroughs.

These details captivated him more than any corporate secret.

When Vivian turned, a strand of hair caught on her lips.

Ethan held his breath as he gently freed it. The brief contact sent electricity shooting up his arm.

He recoiled just as her lashes fluttered.

Retreating to his seat, Ethan pretended to check emails. His burning ears betrayed the thunderous heartbeat.

Only the steady hum of engines and their synchronized breathing filled the cabin.
###Chapter 198

The plane touched down smoothly on the private tarmac. Vivian Laurent stirred awake, rubbing her stiff neck. She realized she'd been moved from her seat to a spacious rest bed.

"Awake?" Ethan Roscente's voice came from the cabin door.

Vivian pushed aside the blanket and sat up. "Why didn't you wake me?"

"You were sleeping soundly." Ethan handed her a glass of water. "We're early."

She drained the glass in one gulp. "Let's go. The sooner we finish, the sooner we leave."

Grabbing her medical kit, she strode toward the exit.

...

At the Evans estate, Sophia Evans paced anxiously. Her slender fingers clutched the curtains as she stared at the driveway.

"Miss, Mr. Roscente has arrived," the butler announced softly.

Sophia scrambled back into bed. She quickly dusted powder on her face to appear paler.

When the door opened, she let out a practiced cough. "Ethan... you're here."

Her gaze darkened at the sight of Vivian standing beside him. Their proximity made her jaw tighten.

"Dr. Laurent is an excellent physician. I've asked her to examine you," Ethan said evenly.

Sophia shook her head weakly. "My condition... it's not worth troubling Dr. Laurent."

Vivian raised an eyebrow at Ethan. "The patient seems uncooperative."

"Sophia." Ethan's voice turned stern. "Don't be difficult."

She bit her lip. "Very well... thank you, Dr. Laurent."

Vivian moved to the bedside. Ethan pulled out a chair for her, making Sophia's nails dig into her palms.

"Dr. Laurent must be tired from her trip. Shouldn't she rest first?" Sophia forced a smile. "Ethan, you should let our guest settle in—"

"No need." Vivian opened her medical kit. "We'll begin now."

She retrieved her stethoscope with efficient movements. Behind her glasses, her eyes were cool and professional. Sophia instinctively shrank back.
###Chapter 199

Sophia's words were a blatant claim of ownership.

She positioned Vivian as an outsider while asserting that she and Ethan were the true masters of this household.

Vivian's lips curled into a cold smile at the passive-aggressive remarks.

Since Sophia had initiated the provocation, she saw no reason to hold back.

"Mr. Roscente mentioned taking me to see the most beautiful sights in Eudora after your examination." Vivian deliberately slowed her speech. "He said the sunsets here are spectacular and insisted on accompanying me personally. You should focus on recovering, Miss Evans. Feel free to make any requests of Mr. Roscente."

Sophia's smile froze instantly.

Ethan wanted to watch the sunset with her?

He had never done anything like that for Sophia.

"If you wish to tour the country, I can arrange more professional guides." Sophia forced a smile. "I have many connections in Eudora who could provide excellent companionship."

She added pointedly: "Someone of Ethan's status shouldn't be reduced to playing tour guide."

Vivian turned to Ethan. "I don't mind either way, but this was your suggestion, wasn't it?"

Ethan responded calmly. "My schedule happens to be clear. No need to trouble others."

Sophia quickly interjected. "Then I'll join you. It's been ages since Ethan accompanied me anywhere."

"You need rest." Ethan dismissed her outright.

Vivian produced her stethoscope. "Come closer."

As Sophia extended her wrist, she suddenly cooed at Ethan. "Ethan, I'd like some orange juice."

She hoped to demonstrate his special treatment of her.

"Your condition determines whether you should have juice. That's the doctor's decision." Ethan replied professionally.

"Could you at least fetch me a pillow?" Sophia persisted. "I want to sit up."

Ethan handed her a cushion without ceremony.

A glint of triumph flashed in Sophia's eyes.

She pushed further. "Ethan, I feel so weak. Could you help me up?"

After brief hesitation, Ethan agreed sitting would facilitate the examination.

He moved to support her shoulders.

Sophia immediately went limp, collapsing into his arms and wrapping herself around his waist.

Ethan stiffened momentarily.

He quickly righted her and attempted to withdraw.

"Stay with me, Ethan?" Sophia clung desperately to his sleeve.

"Let Dr. Laurent concentrate." Ethan freed himself decisively. "The sooner you're treated, the sooner you'll recover."

With that, he strode to stand by the door.

Though Ethan remained aloof, Sophia had achieved her goal.

Their intimate contact had served its purpose of making Vivian uncomfortable.

"Are we doing this or not?" Vivian tapped her stethoscope impatiently. "Any position. Give me your hand."

Sophia reclined slowly, smug satisfaction evident.

Vivian placed the stethoscope against Sophia's chest.

The heartbeat was irregular, the rhythm weak and muddled.

Genuinely ill, but far from terminal.
###Chapter 200

Vivian Laurent rested her fingertips lightly on Sophia Evans' wrist, listening intently.

"Did you bring all the previous medical reports?" She withdrew her hand and looked up.

Ethan Roscente answered first. "Yes." He turned to his assistant. "Retrieve all the medical records."

Sophia clenched the bedsheet, her nails nearly piercing her palms. She had tampered with every previous exam, but facing Vivian still made her uneasy.

Vivian flipped through the records, her brow furrowing slightly.

"A full examination is necessary." She closed the file. "Is now convenient?"

Ethan immediately arranged for preparations. As Sophia was helped into a wheelchair, Vivian gave her a meaningful glance.

That look sent chills down Sophia's spine. She had indeed poisoned herself, and the irregular heartbeat was real. But would Vivian discover the truth?

"How is she?" Ethan asked quietly.

Vivian replied coolly, "She won't die."

The test results arrived quickly. Vivian scanned the data, her lips curling into a cold smile.

"What did the previous doctors say?"

Ethan repeated the diagnoses: organ failure, required rest, limited time left...

"She's perfectly healthy." Vivian tossed the report onto the table. "There's nothing wrong with her."

Ethan looked stunned. "But these indicators are severely abnormal..."

"Fabricated data would show abnormalities." Vivian pointed at the report. "If these numbers were accurate, she'd be in the ICU by now."

Sophia, just wheeled back in, turned pale upon hearing those words.
###Chapter 201

Vivian Laurent's lips curled into a cold smile. The absurdly abnormal test results had exposed Sophia Evans' deception.

While taking Sophia's pulse earlier, she'd noticed the woman's bluish lips and abnormally low body temperature—classic symptoms of poisoning that contradicted the alarming indicators in the medical report.

Clearly, Sophia had bribed the hospital staff.

Ethan Roscente lacked medical knowledge. Even if he consulted other hospitals with this report, they'd only confirm the "critical condition" diagnosis.

"Let's wait for Ms. Evans to return."

Sophia soon reentered the living room.

Both Ethan and Vivian looked up—one grave-faced, the other smirking. Sophia's stomach twisted, fearing Vivian had already uncovered her scheme.

"Ethan..." She leaned weakly against a maid. "The blood draw hurt so much. Look how swollen my wrist is."

As she approached Ethan, her legs suddenly buckled. "I feel dizzy..."

Ethan sidestepped her.

The maid barely caught Sophia before she fell.

"Dizziness is normal." Vivian waved the medical report. "With numbers like these, surviving till tomorrow would be a miracle."

"Are you cursing me?"

"Just stating facts. Even I wouldn't dare fabricate such outrageous results. Ms. Evans is truly... extraordinary."

Sophia bit her lip as she sat down. "Are you mocking me, Dr. Laurent?"

"Not at all. I'm impressed. Ordinary people with these blood levels would be in ICU. Ms. Evans' constitution is... remarkable."

Sophia clenched her fists. "I hate hospital smells. That's why Ethan let me recuperate at home. I know I'm a burden..." She gazed tenderly at Ethan. "But he won't let me go. He keeps searching for specialists—"

Vivian cut in. "How reputable is this hospital?"

"The best private facility in Eudora," Ethan answered.

"Apparently not good enough." Vivian chuckled. "Couldn't even detect poisoning. Shall we get a second opinion elsewhere?"

Sophia's pupils constricted. "Ethan, I'm too exhausted..." She suddenly covered her face, sobbing. "Is Dr. Laurent accusing someone of poisoning me? Or... that I poisoned myself? Am I insane?"

Tears streaked her pale cheeks.

"I may have conflicts with Dr. Laurent, but she can't just make wild accusations!" She looked pleadingly at Ethan. "I want to live more than anyone..."

Vivian watched the performance coldly.

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. This Vivian Laurent was too sharp—she'd seen through the act immediately.
###Chapter 202

Vivian Laurent crossed her arms, watching Sophia Evans' performance with cold detachment.

"Finished with your act, Miss Evans?"

A mocking smile curled at the corner of her lips.

"Normal people would worry about their health upon discovering poisoning. Yet you're more concerned with denial—almost as if you knew beforehand."

Sophia paled.

"That's absurd!" She turned tearful eyes toward Ethan Roscente. "Dr. Laurent hasn't even examined me. How dare she—"

Vivian calmly withdrew silver needles from her bag.

"Don't believe me? Let Mr. Roscente take you to another hospital then."

The needles glinted ominously under the light.

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"I... I trust Dr. Laurent." She forced a smile. "I'm simply too weak to go—"

"Lie down."

Vivian cut her off, scribbling a prescription while speaking.

The first needle's insertion drew a bloodcurdling scream.

"Ah—!"

Sophia trembled violently, her nightgown soaked with sweat.

Vivian continued methodically, needle after needle.

"Endure it." Ethan stood impassively nearby. "It's just treatment."

Thirty minutes later, Vivian withdrew the needles.

The brewed medicine emitted a foul, earthy odor.

Sophia pinched her nose and gulped it down.

Ethan followed Vivian out without a backward glance.

The moment the door closed, Sophia hurled the empty bowl against the wall.

"Bring me that prescription!"

She hissed through clenched teeth.

Upon reading the ingredients, her face turned ashen.

"Horse urine... cow dung..."

She gagged over the bedside, retching violently.

"Vivian Laurent!"

Sophia clawed at the sheets, her nails leaving crescent marks.

That bitch did this on purpose!
###Chapter 203

"Why aren't you staying in the ward?" Vivian arched an eyebrow at Ethan, who had followed her out.

"The doctors and nurses can handle it." Ethan slid one hand into his pocket, his tone indifferent.

Vivian was surprised. His attitude toward Sophia seemed different from the rumors she'd heard.

"Getting bored of her already?" A smirk played on her lips. "Looking for something new?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "Sophia and I don't have that kind of relationship."

"Save it." Vivian raised a hand to cut him off. "I'm not interested in your love life."

Men's excuses were the least trustworthy thing in the world. She'd seen too many hypocrites hiding behind noble facades.

"How serious is her condition?" Ethan changed the subject.

"I told you—she won't die." Vivian scoffed. "You're being played for a fool, Mr. Roscente."

Sophia's little act was laughably amateurish in the eyes of a professional like her.

Ethan fell silent.

This woman had no filter.

"What about follow-up treatment?"

"Treatment for faking an illness?" Vivian turned to leave. "Book my flight. I'm going home."

She didn't want to stay a second longer.

"Wait." Ethan blocked her path. "The Harvest Festival in Eudora starts soon. It's quite the spectacle."

Vivian paused. She'd heard of this festival—Eudora's most important traditional celebration.

"I'll think about it," she finally relented.

Back at the hotel, Ethan immediately called his assistant. "Pull all of Sophia's medical records from the past few years."

His eyes turned icy. If she'd been deceiving him all this time...

The next morning, Vivian received a text from Ethan: Your guide is here.

She opened the door to find him holding a tiny flag. She immediately tried to shut it again.

"I'm qualified." He braced a hand against the door. "I know this place well."

Vivian snorted. "Is Roscente Group going bankrupt? The CEO is moonlighting as a tour guide now?"

"Exclusive VIP service." His tone was dead serious.

The moment they left the hotel, word reached Sophia.

Crash! She hurled her teacup to the floor.

Ethan had never taken her sightseeing. He was always "too busy with work." Now he had time for that bitch?

Her hands trembled as she dialed Victoria's number. "Your brother is obsessed with that woman!"

"We need to destroy Vivian!" Sophia's nails dug into her palms. "She can never become a Roscente!"

A vicious glint flashed in her eyes. This time, she would make sure Vivian disappeared—permanently.
###Chapter 204

The coastline of Eudora appeared mysteriously beautiful under the overcast sky. Steel-blue waves lapped against golden sands as Vivian Laurent stood by the shore, the sea breeze tousling her hair.

Ethan Roscente's gaze never left her. She blended seamlessly with the seascape, as breathtaking as a masterpiece.

"Feel like sailing?" Ethan pointed toward the horizon. "There's a special island over there."

He deliberately omitted mentioning Santorini Island's famous heart shape—a beloved romantic getaway with luxury resorts.

"Sure." Vivian hadn't been out on the water in ages and agreed eagerly.

Ethan swiftly chartered a yacht. As he expertly checked the equipment, Vivian raised an eyebrow. "You can operate this?"

"Licensed and certified." He flashed the credentials from his pocket. "Learned from Felix and the others."

The yacht cut through the waves, cool wind whipping past them. Vivian's hair danced wildly as she closed her eyes, savoring this fleeting freedom.

Thirty minutes later, the heart-shaped island came into view. Crowds of tourists bustled along the vibrant shoreline. They strolled the beach, Ethan maintaining a respectful distance.

Suddenly, the sky darkened. Storm clouds rolled in with alarming speed, churning the sea violently.

"A squall's coming." Ethan frowned. "It's too risky to head back now."

They scrambled for shelter as fat raindrops began pelting down. Ethan draped his suit jacket over Vivian's head and guided her toward the nearest hotel.

"Only two rooms left," the front desk clerk apologized.

Just as Vivian started to speak, a drenched couple rushed in. "Please, we need a room!"

Upon hearing the rooms were taken, the teary-eyed girl pleaded, "Could you spare one? We just got engaged..."

Thunder cracked as rain lashed against the windows. Ethan watched Vivian silently, awaiting her decision.

Through the downpour, the hotel's heart-shaped emblem flickered faintly in the storm.
###Chapter 205

The downpour raged outside as Vivian Laurent stood at the hotel front desk, her fingertips absently tracing the edge of the keycard.

The young couple kept thanking her. She forced a thin smile in response.

The words "King Bed" glared up at her from the plastic card.

Ethan Roscente stood behind her, his soaked shirt clinging to his sculpted back, revealing every taut muscle beneath.

"The storm's too heavy," he murmured, his voice carrying the chill of rainwater.

Vivian clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

The shower hissed behind the bathroom door.

She checked the lock three times before daring to peel off her drenched dress.

Hot water cascaded over her skin but did nothing to wash away the unease coiling in her chest.

"Ethan?" she called through the cracked door, droplets falling from her hair.

The rustle of fabric answered from outside.

"Front desk said they're out of spare clothes," his voice came out rougher than usual.

She bit her lower lip, fingers twisting the towel until the fabric wrinkled.

The mirror reflected her flushed cheeks and water droplets clinging to her collarbone.

Taking a deep breath, she hitched the towel higher.

"Don't turn around."

His footsteps were soundless on the plush carpet.

Ethan's broad back faced her like an unyielding wall, his shoulders rigid with tension.

Yet his peripheral vision caught the flash of pale calves as she moved.

The sheets whispered as she settled onto the bed.

His throat went dry. Knuckles whitened with unconscious pressure.

Unwanted memories surged—that night flashing behind his eyelids.

Golden lamplight. Her wide, startled eyes like a frightened doe.

Now that same doe stood mere feet away, her warm fragrance curling around him.

Ethan loosened his collar. The room temperature seemed to spike suddenly.

Outside, the rain hammered harder against the windows.
###Chapter 206

Ethan's muscles tensed. His breathing grew shallow.

As Vivian brushed past him, a delicate floral scent filled his nostrils. It reminded him of jasmine after rainfall.

His Adam's apple bobbed. His fingertips trembled slightly.

Vivian quickly burrowed under the covers, wrapping herself tightly in the duvet.

She calculated silently. If Ethan dared approach, she'd smash the bedside lamp over his head.

He handed her the hairdryer, his voice hoarse. "Dry your hair first."

Then he strode toward the bathroom, his retreating figure oddly flustered.

Behind the closed door, Ethan braced himself against the sink, breathing heavily.

The mirror reflected a man with red-rimmed eyes and darkened pupils.

He'd always prided himself on self-control, never bothering with empty flirtations. But since meeting Vivian, his restraint had crumbled.

The water droplets clinging to her hair had made him want to lick them away.

Cold water cascaded over him. Ethan clenched his fists.

In the white laundry basket, a scrap of lace peeked out like a crimson blossom against snow.

He jerked his head away and turned the water to its coldest setting.

Vivian tossed and turned in bed.

She suddenly remembered her discarded lingerie still hanging behind the bathroom door - the black lace set was particularly noticeable.

The sound of running water continued. She clutched the sheets and counted sheep.

Her phone vibrated. Isabella's message popped up: "I had someone check Sophia's lab results. Her hemoglobin levels are higher than an athlete's!"

Vivian scoffed. "This isn't her first time faking illness."

"And Ethan actually believed her? Chartered a private jet to Switzerland?"

"Who knows." Vivian glanced at the blurred silhouette moving behind the frosted glass.

Isabella replied instantly: "More importantly, what's happening between you two?"

Vivian gritted her teeth. "Trapped in a hotel by the storm. Only one suite available."

The chat exploded with exclamation marks.

"Alone together in one room?!" Isabella sent a suggestive emoji. "Is the bathroom glass transparent?"

Vivian threw her phone onto the carpet.
###Chapter 207

The message on Vivian's phone screen made her ears burn.

"Isabella Langley!" She typed furiously. "Who wants to shower with him? We're just stuck in the same room!"

The reply popped up instantly. "A man and woman alone together? Skip the shower and just pounce already."

Vivian's fingers hammered the screen. "I don't feel anything for Ethan Roscente anymore!"

"Really? Who was the one staring at his open collar last time?" Isabella sent a winking emoji. "That CEO physique though..."

Vivian nearly threw her phone.

The shower sounds stopped abruptly.

Steam billowed out as the bathroom door opened. Ethan emerged with only a towel around his waist. Water droplets trailed down his collarbone, tracing paths over his sculpted abs.

Vivian's breath hitched.

"My clothes got wet." Ethan towel-dried his hair, droplets splashing onto Vivian's hand. The contact made her flinch.

She turned away sharply. "Couldn't you call room service for new ones?"

"Typhoon. Services are down."

Vivian pulled the blanket higher, curling into herself. Ethan's cedar scent mixed with steam, invading her senses.

"What's so great about this stupid island anyway?" she muttered. "Too many tourists, not enough rooms."

Ethan paused mid-motion. He didn't tell her this island's nickname was "Lovers' Isle" - where couples who stayed overnight were said to last forever.

Water dripped from the towel's edge, darkening the carpet. Vivian's gaze flickered downward before snapping away.

"See enough?" Ethan's voice cut through the silence.

Vivian bristled like a startled cat. "I wasn't looking!"

His low chuckle sent a droplet rolling down his throat. Vivian stared fixedly at the ceiling, her pulse roaring in her ears.

Outside, the storm battered the windows as if trying to break through.
###Chapter 208

Rain poured down in sheets, drumming against the windowpanes with relentless intensity.

Vivian Laurent huddled in the corner of the bed, pulling the blankets tighter around herself. Her heartbeat pounded louder than the storm outside.

As dusk deepened, the rain showed no sign of letting up. It seemed they would have to spend the night in this small motel.

Ethan Roscente moved around the room wearing nothing but a towel, his sculpted muscles sharply defined under the dim lighting. Vivian turned her face away, her ears burning.

"I'll wash your clothes for you," Ethan said, picking up the garments she had changed out of. "They should be dry by tomorrow."

"No!" Vivian sat up abruptly, clutching the slipping blanket. "I'll do it myself."

Wrapped in the blanket, she shuffled to the bathroom and quickly washed her clothes. Just as she finished hanging them up, Ethan walked in with a hairdryer.

"This will dry them faster," he said, flipping the switch. Warm air blasted onto the damp fabric. "Go back to bed. Don’t catch a cold."

Vivian stared at him. Who would have thought the mighty CEO of Roscente Group would personally dry her clothes?

"They can air-dry."

Ethan arched a brow. "Or do you prefer staying like this?" His gaze flicked to the blanket wrapped around her. "Playing hard to get?"

Vivian gritted her teeth. She should have known better than to expect anything decent from this man!

Two hours later, her outerwear was finally dry. But her undergarments were still damp. Blushing, she snatched the hairdryer from him. "I'll handle the rest myself."

Once fully dressed, she regained her composure. Tossing the hairdryer back at Ethan, she snapped, "Dry your own clothes and stop parading around."

"Not satisfied with what you see?" Ethan glanced down at his chiseled abs.

"I've seen better." Vivian forced a cool tone, though she refused to look at him.

Ethan suddenly closed the distance, caging her between his arms. "So Dr. Laurent has quite the experience, huh?"

"Back off!" Vivian shrank away but couldn’t escape the sight of his perfect abdominal muscles. The faint hint of his Adonis belt beneath the towel made her breath hitch.

"So," Ethan leaned in, his breath brushing her ear, "my physique isn’t good enough for you?"
###Chapter 209

"Just wanted you to see clearly, so Dr. Laurent can't play dumb again."

Vivian's breath hitched.

"Ethan Roscente!" She lashed out with her foot.

Ethan anticipated the move, catching her slender ankle in his large hand.

The heat of his palm seared through her skin. A shiver ran down her spine.

"Let go!" Her ears burned crimson.

His bare torso loomed inches away, every muscle defined. Vivian averted her gaze but stole another glance.

He released her foot, only to trail his fingers along her flushed cheek.

"You touched my face with the same hand that held my foot!" She bristled.

"You're blushing." His voice turned gravelly.

Her fair skin bloomed pink like dawn-kissed roses. Those usually cunning eyes now glistened, begging to be teased.

Ethan's gaze darkened.

"I'm not—mmph!"

His hand cradled the back of her head as he crushed his lips against hers.

Vivian's eyes flew wide.

His scent overwhelmed her. The invasion of his tongue was untamed yet relentless.

Her pulse thundered.

Ethan's grip on her waist threatened to fuse their bodies together—until she shoved him away.

Slap!

Her palm struck his chiseled face.

He didn't flinch. The red mark bloomed across his cheekbone.

"My apologies." His voice roughened. "Couldn't resist."

Three years of marriage had remained chaste. Yet now, divorced, an insatiable hunger for her consumed him.

"Looking to die?" Vivian clenched her fists.

Ethan smirked. "Want to return the favor?"

Trembling with rage, she glared.

The man had a death wish.
###Chapter 210

Vivian urged Ethan to dry his clothes, only relaxing when she confirmed his coat was completely dry.

The rain showed no signs of stopping outside. It seemed they were destined to spend the night on this island.

In the hotel restaurant, couples nestled together while Vivian remained preoccupied with the sudden storm.

A conversation from the neighboring table drifted over: "They say the red bean trees on this island are magical. Countless couples come here every year to make wishes."

"Yeah, if it weren't raining, we'd probably see wedding photos being taken right now."

Curious, Vivian turned to Ethan. "What legend are they talking about?"

He avoided her gaze, offering no answer.

She addressed the couple directly. "Excuse me, what's this legend you mentioned?"

They looked surprised. "You came to Santorini Island without knowing? Couples who confess their love here receive blessings from the goddess of love for eternal happiness."

Vivian froze.

"He's not my boyfriend," she quickly clarified.

The couple exchanged knowing smiles. "The ambiguous stage—we've been there. Look how well he treats you."

She turned to find Ethan had silently peeled an entire plate of seafood for her.

"Are you doing this on purpose?" she hissed under her breath.

He feigned innocence. "I'd never heard of this legend before. Besides, it doesn't apply to us."

Vivian took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm.

After dinner, they returned to their room.

She deliberately tossed a blanket at Ethan. "You're sleeping on the floor."

Late into the night, Vivian tossed and turned.

Ethan lay mere feet away on the floor.

Her fingers unconsciously brushed her lips. The memory of that sudden afternoon kiss still lingered, its warmth not yet faded.
###Chapter 211 

The sea breeze carried a briny scent as Vivian opened her eyes at dawn.

Ethan was already dressed, arranging breakfast on the balcony table. Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting fragmented shadows across his chiseled profile.

"I'll take you back after breakfast," his voice was low.

Vivian bit into her sandwich, the crisp bread crunching between her teeth. She set down her fork with determination. "Now."

Ethan tapped the table twice. "The holiday parade is spectacular."

"Not interested." Vivian grabbed her backpack and strode toward the door without looking back.

The returning yacht cut through the azure waves. Vivian stood on deck, her hair tousled by the wind.

"Book the earliest flight," she turned to Ethan. "I'm going back to the hospital."

Ethan frowned. "I could take you—"

"No." Vivian cut him off. "Patients can't wait."

Meanwhile, the sterile scent of disinfectant filled Sophia's hospital room. For the third time, she glared at the wall clock, her nails digging into her palms.

"Where's Mr. Roscente?" she demanded as a nurse entered.

The nurse kept her eyes on the IV bag. "He went sailing with Dr. Laurent."

Sophia jerked upright, yanking her IV line. "Where?"

"Santorini Island," the nurse whispered. "They stayed overnight."

A glass shattered in Sophia's grip. Blood dripped from her pale wrist onto the white sheets, blooming like crimson roses.

"Find out their flight details," she rasped. "I need to know when they're returning."

At the VIP airport lounge the next morning, Ethan's phone rang. His expression darkened as he answered.

"Cerebral hemorrhage?" He shot to his feet. "I'm on my way."

Vivian calmly closed her magazine. "Go ahead."

"Wait for me two—"

"No." She lifted her carry-on. "Your first love needs you more, Mr. Roscente."

Vivian walked toward security without a backward glance, her silhouette as sharp as an unsheathed blade.
###Chapter 212

The plane's engines roared as Vivian Laurent leaned against the window, eyes closed in rest.

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente's private car sped down the highway toward the hospital.

In the emergency ward corridor, Sophia Evans stood trembling behind sunglasses and a mask.

She spotted Ethan rounding the corner and immediately removed her shades, revealing swollen red eyes.

"Ethan!" She rushed forward with a sob. "Theo's fever spiked to 104°F. The doctors say he needs hospitalization."

Ethan sidestepped her attempted embrace with a frown. "When did this start?"

"Last night," Sophia sniffled. "He kept crying for you." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "When I said you were busy, he cried harder."

Nearby, a man in a baseball cap discreetly raised his phone, capturing Sophia leaning against Ethan's shoulder.

"He's too young to understand adult matters." Sophia wiped her tears. "I know you're upset with me, but for Theo's sake—"

Ethan stepped back. "I'll take responsibility for Theo."

A shadow flickered in Sophia's eyes. She'd anticipated this—he'd claim the child but reject her.

"Could you stay a few days?" she asked meekly. "The doctor said he needs IV fluids for three days. Seeing you would speed his recovery."

After a pause, Ethan nodded.

Sophia lowered her head to hide her smirk. The cold bath she'd forced Theo into was worth this fever.

The examination room door opened. A nurse wheeled out a pale Theo, his cheeks flushed with fever, an IV already in his small hand.

Ethan grasped the child's burning fingers. This boy, bearing his late brother's likeness, was his sole remaining tie.

"Uncle Ethan..."

The weak voice tightened Ethan's chest. Theo's damp eyes brightened upon seeing him.

"Don't move." Ethan gently restrained the struggling child.

Theo obediently lay still. "Will you stay? I'll be good with the needles..."

From the shadows, Sophia watched with satisfaction. She'd coached her son well—ice cream awaited if he performed. If not...

Tear droplets clung to Theo's lashes as he forced a smile. "I missed you, Uncle Ethan. Please don't go."
###Chapter 213

The hospital room smelled of antiseptic.

Ethan Roscente leaned over to tuck Theo Evans in, his voice deep and gentle. "Uncle's here, Theo. Don't be afraid."

The little boy's eyes were red, his small hand gripping Ethan's sleeve tightly. "Uncle, do you not like me anymore?"

"Of course not." Ethan ruffled his hair. "You're my favorite."

"Then when I get better, will you and Mommy take me to the amusement park?" Theo peeked at Sophia Evans standing by the window.

"Sure."

"You're the best!" Theo suddenly threw himself into Ethan's arms. "I wish you were my dad."

Ethan froze for a second. "I'll always care for you like a father would."

Sophia stepped forward, her tone apologetic. "Ethan, with the company so busy, you really didn’t have to—"

"It's fine." He cut her off. "I’ll arrange for someone to take care of Theo."

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting fragmented shadows across Sophia's face. She smiled softly as she stroked Theo’s cheek, but her eyes were cold.

"He keeps asking about his father lately..." She sighed. "Ethan, I don’t want adult matters affecting him."

Ethan didn’t respond. Instead, he picked up a storybook from the nightstand. "Which story do you want to hear, Theo?"

Meanwhile, in the hospital hallway, a reporter in a baseball cap whispered into his phone. "Got the evidence. Ethan Roscente and Sophia Evans in the pediatric ward..."

Three hours later, social media exploded.

#EthanRoscenteSophiaEvansHospitalMeeting
#SecretAffairConfirmed
#SophiaEvansPregnancyRumors

A series of photos showed Ethan holding a child, Sophia leaning against him. The most damning was a close-up of them embracing, with a red circle highlighting Sophia’s abdomen.

Comments flooded in:

"OMG! They secretly had a child together?"
"This screams shotgun wedding!"
"Look how naturally Ethan holds the kid—he’s definitely a dad!"
"Congrats, Sophia! Waiting for the official announcement!"

At the same time, an international flight had just landed.

Vivian Laurent unlocked her phone. A notification popped up: Roscente Group heir suspected of secret marriage and child with A-list actress...

Her finger hovered over the screen, unmoving.
###Chapter 214

Vivian Laurent unlocked her phone, and the photo instantly filled the screen.

Sophia Evans was nestled in Ethan Roscente's arms, their perfect match painfully obvious.

She let out a cold laugh and swiped the screen with her fingertip.

"Mr. Roscente seems to be enjoying himself."

Ethan was in a meeting when Simon Eisner called.

"Sir, the rumors about you and Ms. Evans are trending."

He opened the news, his brows tightening instantly.

The photo was deliberately suggestive, omitting the moment he had pushed Sophia away.

"Take down all related reports immediately."

"Yes, sir."

"Also issue a statement clarifying that I'm single and Ms. Evans is just a friend."

Ethan stared at the photo, his gaze icy.

He never cared about tabloid gossip before.

But now was different.

He couldn’t let Vivian misunderstand.

Three calls went unanswered.

He switched phones and tried again.

"Who is this?" Vivian's cool voice came through.

"It's me."

Silence. Then the line went dead.

Ethan redialed immediately.

"Make it quick," Vivian snapped.

"You saw the news?"

"Which one? The engagement announcement with Ms. Evans?"

A faint smile touched his lips.

She cared.

"That’s media fabrication. I’ve already had it corrected."

"No need to explain to me." Her tone was flat. "Are we even close?"

"I don’t want you to misunderstand."

A soft laugh drifted through the line.

"Don’t flatter yourself, Mr. Roscente. I couldn’t care less."
###Chapter 215

Vivian's fingers tightened slightly around her phone.

Ethan's explanation had come out of nowhere.

There was clearly nothing between them, so why bother calling to clarify?

"Got it. Anything else?" Her voice was cold and distant.

"Are you home now?" Ethan seemed oblivious to her displeasure.

"Yes."

"Have you eaten? I can send a chef over to prepare something for you."

Just then, Sophia's sickly sweet voice suddenly came through the line. "Ethan, there you are! Who are you talking to?"

The exaggerated tone was clearly meant for Vivian to hear.

Vivian let out a cold laugh. "No need. You should focus on taking care of Miss Evans. Don't contact me again."

"Wait—"

The call ended abruptly.

Ethan stared at the darkened screen, an inexplicable fury rising in his chest.

He turned to Sophia, suddenly finding her pitiful expression nauseating.

"Ethan, did I interrupt something?" Sophia blinked her innocent doe eyes.

"No." He pocketed his phone. "Why are you out here?"

He had stepped out to handle business after Simon called, assuming Theo was still asleep.

"Theo woke up looking for you. He was crying so hard." Sophia bit her lip, her voice soft.

In reality, she had secretly pinched the sleeping child awake and threatened him not to tell his uncle.

"Sophia." Ethan took a step closer. "Did you leak those photos online?"

"What photos?" She feigned confusion. "I've been with Theo the whole time. Haven't even checked my phone."

She had arranged for someone else to handle it, keeping her own hands clean.

Ethan's gaze sharpened. "I've already taken down the trending topic. Keep your distance from now on. Don't give people the wrong idea."

"What wrong idea? Did Miss Laurent get upset?" Sophia pressed urgently. "I can explain—"

"Don't." His voice was icy.

Vivian already distrusted Sophia. Sending her to explain would only pour oil on the fire.

"I'm warning you—don't play games."

Sophia's eyes instantly welled with tears. "Ethan, how could you think that of me?"

"You know exactly what you're doing." Without another word, he turned and headed back to the hospital room.

Inside, Theo's wails were heart-wrenching.

The moment he saw Ethan, the child cried even harder.

"Uncle..." He threw himself into Ethan's arms, his small body trembling uncontrollably.

Beneath his clothes were bruises from the pinching, but he didn't dare speak up.

Sophia stood in the doorway, her gaze cold and venomous as she watched him.
###Chapter 216

"Don't cry, Theo. Uncle's here."

Ethan Roscente knelt down, gently wiping the tears from the little boy's face.

Theo threw himself into Ethan's arms, tiny fingers clutching his sleeve desperately. "Don't go, Uncle."

"I'm not going anywhere." Ethan lifted the child, patting his back soothingly.

Sophia Evans stood frozen in the doorway, watching the scene unfold. She'd never seen this tender side of Ethan before. If he had his own child, she couldn't imagine how doting he would be.

Her mind wandered to fantasies of bearing Ethan's child...

Because of Theo, Ethan extended his stay in the Kingdom of Eudora.

Though the online scandal had died down and Roscente Group issued an official statement, Sophia's fans remained relentless.

"Just friends? Who hugs like that? Give me a break!"

"Some people are just jealous Sophia landed such a catch. The bitterness is palpable."

"Sophia will be Mrs. Roscente soon enough. Keep seething, peasants!"

Sophia's toxic fanbase had long earned their notorious reputation.

At the restaurant, Vivian Laurent dined with Isabella Langley, Lucas Lefèvre, and Finn Deross.

Isabella stabbed a piece of sweet-and-sour pork angrily. "Sophia keeps stirring drama online, and Ethan's no better. First he's holed up with you, then entangled with Sophia again."

Lucas paused mid-bite. "Viv, you and Ethan..."

"You slept together?" Finn's eyes widened comically.

Vivian nearly choked on her tea. "Don't be ridiculous! Nothing happened."

"But you said that night on the island..." Isabella wiggled her eyebrows.

"We shared a room, that's all! He slept on the floor while I took the bed!" Vivian's ears burned. "There was only one room left because of the rain and tourist crowds."

Isabella smirked knowingly. "Alone together all night with a beauty like you, and he didn't make a move? Maybe he's... deficient in that department?"

Vivian bit her lip. She knew firsthand Ethan had no such issues. That night on Santorini Island, she'd felt the intensity of his restraint.

Lucas clenched his fists. "If he dares mistreat you, I'll be the first to—"

"Who could possibly mistreat me?" Vivian served everyone fish. "Eat your food."

As laughter filled their table, a familiar figure entered the restaurant.

Victoria Roscente scanned the room, her gaze locking onto Vivian. A cold smile curled her lips as she strode purposefully toward them.
###Chapter 217

Victoria Roscente strode into the restaurant in her stilettos, her gaze instantly locking onto Vivian Laurent by the window.

She had taken extra care with her makeup today, her Chanel suit accentuating her refined elegance.

"Vivian." Victoria loomed over the table with an air of superiority.

Lucas Lefèvre glanced up, recognizing the Roscente heiress who had caused trouble at the last gala.

"If it isn't the Roscente princess," Lucas set down his fork. "Here to remind us you exist again?"

Vivian continued slicing her steak without even looking up. "State your business."

Victoria scoffed. "The great Laurent heiress, dining in the common area? How... pedestrian."

"Did you buy out the private rooms?" Vivian finally lifted her eyes, amusement glinting in them. "Or do you consider everyone who eats here beneath you?"

"You—" Victoria's face flushed with anger.

"Seems you're quick to label yourself. How self-aware." Vivian took a sip of wine.

Nearby diners had begun casting curious glances their way.

Victoria inhaled sharply and pulled a gilded invitation from her clutch. "My high tea is next Wednesday. Care to grace us with your presence?"

"Pass." Vivian didn't even glance at the card.

"Scared?" Victoria raised her voice deliberately. "All the elite will be there."

Vivian chuckled. "Are you inviting me, Victoria, or setting yourself up for humiliation?"

Isabella Langley snorted. "She's practically begging to be shot down, Viv."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. "Vivian, this is a genuine invitation. About what happened before... I can apologize."

"An apology?" Vivian arched a brow. "That's all your pride allows?"

"What do you want, then?"

Vivian set down her glass, lips curving. "Beg me. If you do it well enough, I might humor you."

Victoria went pale.

Her chest heaved as she stared at Vivian's mocking smile. For the plan, she had to endure this.

"Vivian..." The words ground between her teeth. "Please... attend my tea party."

"Can't hear you." Vivian tapped her ear.

Victoria nearly shouted, "I'm begging you to come! Happy now?"

The entire restaurant fell silent.

Every head turned toward them.

Vivian nodded, satisfied. "Since you asked so nicely... I suppose I can spare some time."
###Chapter 218

"Vivian, I'm begging you." Victoria clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Begging requires the proper posture." Vivian swirled her wine glass, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"What do you want?"

"You're the one begging, not me." Vivian took a delicate sip. "Leave if you're not sincere."

Victoria inhaled sharply. "I sincerely invite you to the High Tea Party. Let bygones be bygones. Please honor us with your presence."

Vivian set down her glass. "Drink this, and I'll go."

She pushed the glass toward Victoria. "But I should warn you—it's drugged."

Victoria's pupils contracted.

Her gaze locked onto the wine, the rim still bearing Vivian's lipstick mark. This woman wouldn't poison herself. It had to be a bluff.

"I'll drink." Victoria grabbed the glass and downed it. "You'd better keep your word, Dr. Laurent."

Vivian gestured to Finn, who handed over the invitation. "I'll be there."

As Victoria turned, a cold smirk twisted her lips. If Vivian dared show up, she wouldn't leave unscathed.

The moment the door shut, Lucas exploded. "Viv, it's obviously a trap!"

"I know." Vivian toyed with the invitation. "She drank 'drugged' wine without hesitation. How desperate."

"Then why agree?"

"How could I refuse such a well-set stage?" Vivian chuckled. "I might even steal the show."

Isabella leaned in. "Did you really drug it?"

"Of course." Vivian arched a brow. "I never lie."

Finn blinked. "When? We didn't see you do it."

"When she turned to grab her purse." Vivian wiggled her pinky ring.

Before Isabella could ask about the drug's effects, the door burst open. Victoria staggered back in, her face flushed and the back of her dress soaked.
###Chapter 219

Victoria Roscente clutched her thighs together, her face pale as she desperately stopped a waiter. "Where's the restroom? Tell me now!"

The moment the waiter pointed down the hall, Victoria bolted like an arrow released from a bow.

She had nearly lost control right then. Just moments ago, she'd been perfectly fine—until the moment she got into the car, when crippling stomach pain struck without warning. The spasms came so violently she couldn't endure them for even a minute.

Squatting in the stall, Victoria was drenched in cold sweat. When she finally managed to steady herself and straightened her skirt to leave—

Gurgle.

The unmistakable sound of her stomach rebelling made her face drain of color. Clamping her legs together, she rushed back inside.

Isabella Langley and her group caught the entire humiliating display.

"Did you slip her laxatives?" Isabella arched a brow.

Vivian Laurent gave a careless nod. "Extra strength. Should keep her occupied all night."

"Consider it a detox."

She had warned Victoria not to drink that tea.

Isabella's eyes gleamed. "If anyone causes trouble at the High Tea Party, we could spike all their drinks. The bathrooms would be chaos..."

The mental image of socialites clutching their skirts while sprinting made her burst into laughter.

Vivian tilted her head thoughtfully. "Not a bad idea."

They shared a grin, picturing the same scene.

Beside them, Lucas Lefèvre and Finn Deross instinctively tightened their legs.

Terrifying. Together, these two women could bring the sky crashing down. One plotted while the other executed—cross them at your own peril.

......

Vivian's group left early, while Victoria endured an eternity in the restroom.

The restaurant was packed, and a line formed outside the bathroom. Every few minutes, impatient knocks forced her to drag her weakened body out to let others in.

"Ugh—who did this?!" someone retched from inside the stall.

Victoria bit her lip hard. Back at the Roscente estate, no one would dare complain about the smell. But now, stranded here, she had to endure the humiliation.

Just two minutes later, the familiar cramps returned. She curled up by the sinks, desperately waiting for a stall to open.

Now she understood Vivian's "kindness."

This wasn't over. The High Tea Party was coming soon, and then...

"Miss? We're closing," a server knocked on the stall door.

Victoria stumbled out on shaky legs. The anti-diarrheal medication she'd sent for had done nothing.

In the car home, her body suddenly locked up.

Pffft—

The suffocating stench instantly filled the vehicle. The driver silently rolled down every window.

"Agh!" Victoria buried her face in her hands.

Never in her life had she been this humiliated. Vivian Laurent, just you wait.
###Chapter 220

Vivian Laurent had been working nonstop lately.

Top hospitals competed to invite her for consultations, specifically requesting her expertise on complex cases. In the operating room, her slender fingers wielded the scalpel with effortless precision. Though surrounded by observing doctors, she remained completely focused.

"Watch this area closely," she murmured, the blade deftly avoiding blood vessels. "This angle provides the safest incision."

She had assigned Finn Deross several simple missions. Before his departure, Vivian personally taught him shooting techniques.

"Remember, seek cover first when in danger." She pressed the pistol into Finn's palm. "Staying alive is priority."

The apartment felt unnaturally quiet without Finn. Vivian lay in bed scrolling through her phone, the screen's glow illuminating her face.

Was Ethan Roscente still in Eudora?

She abruptly sat up and retrieved her laptop from the nightstand. Her slender fingers flew across the keyboard as lines of code rapidly scrolled.

"Interesting." A faint smile touched her lips as she studied Roscente Group's firewall.

The encryption system had become significantly more sophisticated since last time. Excitement flickered in Vivian's eyes as her typing accelerated.

"Triple-layer nesting," she murmured. "Quite the hiding place."

Forty minutes later, the system crumbled under her assault. Alarm sirens blared through Roscente's server room as all systems crashed simultaneously.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Quick response."

She was about to restore the systems when she froze. The encryption style felt... familiar.

"King?" she whispered.

Meanwhile, at Roscente headquarters.

Ethan's phone vibrated incessantly. His expression darkened as he read the security alert.

"Impossible." He immediately accessed his computer. "No one breaches this firewall."

Yet the evidence stared back at him. More startling—the crashed servers were automatically rebooting.

"What the hell?" Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Is this a challenge?"

He dialed Patrick Alpinus without hesitation. A groggy voice answered.

"Any progress tracking Queen?" Ethan demanded.

"Boss, it's 3 AM..." Patrick yawned. "That woman's more elusive than a fox. No trails whatsoever."

Ethan studied the vanishing digital footprints on his screen, his gaze inscrutable.

"Keep digging," he ordered coldly. "I will uncover who did this."
###Chapter 221

Patrick Alpinus had encountered someone even he couldn't trace for the first time.

He'd always been intrigued by Queen, but the elusive figure left no digital footprints to follow.

Recruiting such talent to the police force would skyrocket their case clearance rate.

"Why the sudden interest in her?" Patrick asked curiously.

Not even gender was identifiable, though the moniker "Queen" suggested female.

"She just hacked into our corporate system."

Patrick raised an eyebrow. "Bad blood between you? Why the fixation?"

Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed.

It was peculiar. Queen's repeated targeting defied explanation.

Someone that skilled and mysterious...

An image flashed through his mind.

Vivian Laurent.

He'd never considered it before, but witnessing her multifaceted brilliance made him wonder.

Could Vivian be Queen?

The thought tugged at his lips.

When had she become omnipotent in his eyes?

Before realizing it, he'd dialed her number.

The vibrating phone startled Vivian. Ethan's name on the screen sent her pulse racing.

Why would he call now? Did he discover the breach?

Her fingers fumbled, accidentally disconnecting.

The phone rang again.

She declined.

It persisted.

Finally, she answered. "Yes?"

"What are you doing?" Ethan's baritone voice resonated through the receiver.

His breath seemed to ghost across her ear, warming her skin.

"Sleeping. It's the middle of the night."

"Then why hang up?"

"Do I need a reason?"

"Guilty conscience?" Amusement colored his tone.

"About what?" Her voice wavered slightly.

She was nervous. His firewall had been too tempting to resist.

But why call now? Had he actually figured it out?

Impossible. Her Queen identity was airtight.

A low chuckle traveled through the line.

Ethan didn't press. It was just a hunch—perhaps wishful thinking. No one could excel at everything.

That laugh sent shivers down her spine, like fingertips tracing her neck.

"I'm hanging up." She rushed to end the call.

"Wait. Talk to me."

"About what?"

Ethan hesitated.

Truthfully, he just wanted to hear her voice. The topic didn't matter.
###Chapter 222

"What have you been up to lately?" Ethan Roscente's voice came through the phone.

Vivian Laurent rolled her eyes. "Since when did the CEO of Roscente Group become a census taker?"

"Can't I show some concern?"

"Save it." She fired back without hesitation.

A low chuckle sounded from the other end. Vivian frowned. The man had been laughing too much recently, as if possessed.

"Busy at the hospital? Is Finn still crashing at your place?"

"Ethan Roscente!" She gritted her teeth. "If you're that bored, go micromanage your subsidiaries."

"You could micromanage me instead."

"Like I care about your nonsense!"

Ethan wisely changed the subject. "What would you like to hear then?"

"I'd like to hang up."

"How about a bedtime story?"

Vivian nearly dropped her phone. "Do I look three to you?"

"Temperatures dropped in Country C. Dress warmly when you go out." His tone turned serious. "And stay away from Finn."

Her eyelids grew heavy as she listened.

The voice on the phone gradually faded.

In Country E, under the afternoon sun, Ethan's lips curved upward as he heard steady breathing through the receiver.

He set down his documents gently, unwilling to end the call.

...

Morning sunlight made Vivian squint.

She grabbed her phone. The call duration showed 4 hours and 58 minutes.

"Damn it!" She bolted upright.

Had that man really listened to her sleep? Did he record something embarrassing?

She gnashed her teeth. If Ethan dared use this against her...

A vibration interrupted her thoughts.

A text from Victoria Roscente appeared: 【High tea tonight. Don't be late.】

Vivian replied coldly: 【Relax】

She grabbed a sweatshirt and jeans, dismissing it as another tedious social event.

Until she pushed open the doors of the Roscente mansion—

Under crystal chandeliers, socialites swayed in haute couture while gentlemen sipped champagne.

Her canvas shoes made an awkward squeak against the marble floor.

"Did some waitress get lost?" Someone tittered behind a gloved hand.
###Chapter 223

Vivian Laurent became the center of attention the moment she stepped into the ballroom.

Men's eyes instinctively followed her.

In the corner, Victoria Roscente clung to Bianca Semona's arm.

Bianca had disappeared from public view since the Jade Gambling incident.

She wouldn't have shown up tonight if Victoria hadn't insisted.

Victoria had already revealed their target—a woman named Vivian Laurent.

The mere mention of that name made Bianca's blood boil.

"Ethan won't be coming tonight, right?" Bianca whispered.

Victoria smirked. "Relax. He's overseas."

She'd chosen this timing deliberately.

Vivian wore no makeup, dressed simply in a white shirt and jeans.

Yet she outshone every heavily made-up socialite in the room.

"Dr. Laurent, you finally made it." Victoria flashed a sweet smile.

Bianca immediately caught on, eyeing Vivian with disdain.

"Victoria, is she even supposed to be here?"

Victoria feigned surprise. "Of course she is."

"Then why is she dressed like that?" Bianca scoffed. "Couldn't afford a gown?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"I didn't want to outshine everyone else. Some people might feel inadequate."

Bianca's face stiffened.

The woman before her was undeniably stunning.

"Just admit you're broke." Bianca lifted her chin. "This is AN Atelier's latest collection."

Victoria yanked her arm sharply.

Vivian studied Bianca's gown with amusement.

"AN's designs are quite unique."

Bianca didn't notice Victoria's sudden change in expression.

She twirled proudly.
###Chapter 224

Vivian Laurent arched an eyebrow as she examined Bianca Semona's gown.

"AN Atelier design?" Her tone dripped with skepticism. "I don't recall creating this piece."

Victoria Roscente turned away uncomfortably.

She couldn't bear to watch Bianca embarrass herself before the actual designer.

Bianca remained oblivious.

"You're not AN," she scoffed, tilting her chin up. "This is a limited edition I paid a fortune for!"

Whispers of admiration rippled through the surrounding socialites.

"Oh my god, is it really AN's work?"

"I've been on the waiting list for six months!"

"The tailoring is perfection!"

Bianca basked in their envy, twirling dramatically.

Victoria finally interjected. "That's enough."

Bianca blinked at her. "Why? This is an authentic AN original!" she insisted. "One of a kind!"

Vivian shook her head with an amused smile.

"Every AN piece has a unique serial number," she said calmly. "Check the official website."

The room fell silent.

Bianca's face paled slightly.

"Of course I verified it!" she snapped. "What would you know?"

Vivian's gaze swept across the crowd.

"Shall I make it clearer?" Her lips curved. "I am AN."

Bianca froze.

"I remember every design I've ever created." Vivian took a step forward. "This isn't one of them."

Gasps echoed through the room.

Bianca's face drained of color.

"Lies!" she shrieked. "You're just jealous!"

Vivian regarded her with pity.

"Wake up," she murmured. "You've been scammed, sweetheart."
###Chapter 225

The banquet hall fell silent as Vivian Laurent's words hung in the air.

All eyes turned to her as if she were some bizarre creature.

Bianca Semona's face turned ashen, her fingers twisting the fabric of her dress. "You...you can't possibly be AN!"

"Why not?" Vivian chuckled, shifting her gaze to Victoria Roscente. "She's known my identity all along."

Bianca whirled toward Victoria.

Victoria's expression faltered before she forced a smile. "I have no idea what you're talking about..."

"Is that so?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "How interesting."

Bianca exhaled in relief, regaining her haughty demeanor. "You're clearly an impostor!"

With deliberate slowness, Vivian retrieved her phone.

She logged into the AN Atelier official backend, displaying the verification credentials for all to see.

"Any more doubts?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Several socialites began whispering behind their hands.

"Oh my God, she really is AN..."

"Bianca just humiliated herself."

"To wear counterfeit designs so brazenly..."

Bianca's face flushed crimson. "This proves nothing! It could be fabricated!"

Vivian pocketed her phone with a pitying look. "Must you lie to yourself?"

"You—!" Bianca trembled with rage.

Victoria took a subtle step backward, attempting to distance herself.

Noticing the movement, Vivian's lips curved. "Seems your dear friend won't stand by you."

Bianca finally registered Victoria's retreat, her heart twisting painfully.

She bit her lip hard, refusing to concede. "Stop trying to drive a wedge between us!"

Vivian shook her head. "I gave you every chance."

From her clutch, she produced an embossed business card and placed it on the table.

"AN Atelier welcomes visitors anytime."

The socialites swarmed forward eagerly, leaving Bianca standing alone.

Her gown suddenly felt like a garish mockery, every detail taunting her foolishness.

Vivian gave her one final glance. "Remember—you brought this upon yourself."
###Chapter 226

Vivian Laurent tapped her phone screen lightly, capturing Bianca Semona in a quick snapshot.

"Stay still," she said calmly.

Bianca's face twisted in alarm. "What are you doing? Delete that! This is a violation of my rights!"

A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. "Don't worry, I'll blur your face. Just helping you face reality."

She swiftly sent the photo to her assistant, Amy.

"This gown is a counterfeit. Someone is using my name," she typed rapidly. "Issue a public statement immediately."

Amy replied instantly. "Understood."

Victoria Roscente stood nearby, her gaze dark and fixed on Vivian.

Bianca scoffed. "Pathetic act! Let’s see what lies you’ll spin now."

Vivian pocketed her phone, ignoring the remark.

Two minutes later, murmurs rippled through the banquet hall.

"Check AN Atelier's official website!" someone gasped.

"Oh my god, an official statement!"

"It includes the photo—the one just taken!"

Guests whispered among themselves, their eyes darting between Bianca and their screens.

Bianca's hands trembled as she opened the website. Her face drained of color.

The announcement was clear: This gown is not an AN Atelier design. It is a counterfeit.

"Convinced now?" Vivian arched a brow. "Next time, make sure you buy the real thing."

Bianca's lips quivered. Tears spilled as she spun on her heel and fled the hall.

Victoria rushed after her. "Bianca! I have other gowns—"

"You knew, didn’t you?" Bianca shoved her away. "You set me up!"

Victoria protested, "I warned you—"

"Shut up!" Bianca's voice turned shrill. "I’m always the one humiliated in public!"

She pushed Victoria aside, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor as she stormed off.

Back in the banquet hall, the scandal remained the hot topic.

"AN Atelier’s designer personally exposing a fake—so dramatic!"

"The Semona family just lost all face tonight."

Vivian sipped her champagne, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 227

Victoria Roscente gently patted Bianca Semona's shoulder.

"Bianca, we've known each other for years. Have I ever let you down?"

A cold glint flashed in her eyes.

"The more Vivian Laurent smiles now, the harder she'll fall later."

Bianca's expression softened slightly.

She clenched her fists.

Only public humiliation would satisfy her grudge against Vivian!

"Let's go change first."

Victoria curled her lips.

"The real show hasn't even started yet."

They turned and headed upstairs.

Downstairs in the grand hall, Vivian found herself surrounded by socialites.

"AN! I knew you had extraordinary style at first glance!"

"Please design a gown for me! Name your price!"

"I've been in the lottery for three years! Can't you make an exception?"

Vivian took two steps back under the onslaught.

"I'm sorry, but rules are rules."

She maintained a polite smile.

"The website lottery is the fairest system."

The heiresses refused to give up.

"I'll pay double!"

"My family has connections in fashion! We can promote you!"

Vivian seized the chance to slip through the crowd.

She retreated to a corner and exhaled in relief.

Perhaps revealing her identity hadn't been the best idea.

The Roscente mansion exuded opulence.

Crystal chandeliers cast dazzling reflections.

Antique vases lined both sides of the hallway.

At the center of the grand hall stood a pristine white grand piano.

Its surface gleamed like mother-of-pearl under the lights.

Vivian's fingers twitched with longing.

It had been too long since she last played.

No one noticed.

A black Maybach pulled up silently outside.

The door opened.

Polished leather shoes touched the ground.

A tall, imposing figure emerged from the vehicle.

The light gilded his sharp features with gold.
###Chapter 228

The crystal chandelier refracted dazzling light as Victoria Roscente descended the spiral staircase alone.

She stood gracefully at the center of the grand hall.

"Thank you all for attending today's high tea party," she said coolly. "I hope everyone enjoys themselves."

"Victoria, this piano is exquisite!" someone gasped in admiration.

Her fingertips glided over the crystal keys.

"A limited custom edition. Maestro Fredette personally secured it for me." A faint smile touched her lips. "Just over two million dollars."

A chorus of awed whispers rippled through the crowd.

Maestro Fredette's name carried legendary weight in the music world. The thirty-something prodigy had been hailed as the modern Beethoven, his career unblemished by defeat.

Until that private competition two years ago.

Rumors claimed Fredette had lost to a mysterious opponent and subsequently vanished. The truth remained shrouded in speculation.

As Fredette's youngest protégée, Victoria rarely competed but basked in reflected glory from her prestigious lineage.

Tonight, she had prepared a performance.

But every show needed its stage.

At Victoria's subtle cue, one of her close friends approached the piano.

"May I try?"

Permission granted, skilled fingers conjured a melodious tune. The technique was polished, the foundation evident.

As the final note faded, the friend suddenly turned to Vivian Laurent.

"Miss Laurent, since you're so talented in design, surely you play as well?"

Vivian chuckled.

"I'm afraid my playing would make you all feel inadequate."

The provocation struck its mark.

"Arrogant! You probably can't play at all!"

Victoria interjected smoothly, "Laney, don't embarrass Vivian." She addressed Vivian with saccharine concern, "We received elite training since childhood—quite different from your background. There's no shame in not knowing how to play."

Every syllable dripped venom.
###Chapter 229

Victoria Roscente's words stabbed Vivian Laurent like a sharp blade.

The surrounding socialites' gazes shifted, dripping with condescending disdain.

So what if she was AN Atelier's designer? Just another servant catering to their whims.

Vivian set down her teacup with deliberate calm.

"When did I say I couldn't? I'm just worried you'll be too scared to touch the piano later."

"Ridiculous!" A woman in Chanel screeched. "Do you even know who Victoria is?"

Vivian didn't bother lifting her eyelids.

She truly didn't know Victoria Roscente. But she did know these people were digging their own graves.

"Whether she plays well or not—why should I care?"

"Then prove it in a match!" The Chanel woman challenged.

Victoria smiled in satisfaction.

This was exactly what she wanted.

"Why should I?" Vivian countered.

"Too scared now?" The Chanel woman sneered. "Anyone can talk big."

Victoria interjected smoothly, "Vivian, I can go easy on you."

Vivian nearly laughed aloud.

Go easy on her?

"Fine." Vivian rose. "Since you're all so eager to humiliate yourselves."

Victoria brimmed with confidence.

She was Maestro Fredette's prized protégé, after all.

"Don't cry when you lose," Victoria tilted her chin up.

Vivian leaned lazily against the grand piano.

"Begin."

She felt no anticipation.

How good could Victoria possibly be? Better than her own teacher?

Hadn't that old fool Fredette told his student about losing to her?

Vivian sighed.

She really didn't want trouble today.

But some people just begged to be put in their place.
###Chapter 230

Ethan Roscente stepped into the courtyard of his family's mansion, immediately greeted by a cacophony of voices.

A crowd had formed a tight circle, murmuring excitedly.

His brow furrowed when he caught Vivian Laurent's name.

What scheme was Victoria Roscente plotting now?

His pace instinctively quickened.

Then he remembered - Vivian was no pushover.

A smirk tugged at his lips as he deliberately slowed his steps.

Memories flooded back.

That phone call last night had unsettled him.

He'd booked the first flight back from abroad.

His driver mentioned Victoria hosting a high tea party with Vivian as guest.

So he'd come straight here.

No one noticed his arrival.

He lingered in the shadows, scanning for that familiar silhouette.

At the center of attention, Vivian stood composed.

Her emerald green qipao made her porcelain skin glow.

Victoria hovered by the grand piano, smug satisfaction written across her face.

"A challenge should have stakes, don't you think?" A woman in pink prodded.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Name them."

Victoria jumped at the opportunity. "If you lose, you leave the capital forever and never see my brother again!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Ethan's fists clenched.

He knew Vivian too well.

She'd seize any excuse to escape him.

Just as predicted—

"Deal." Vivian agreed without hesitation.

Ethan's stomach dropped.

"But..." Vivian's tone shifted, "what do I get when you lose?"

Victoria scoffed. "When I lose?"

"There's always a first time." Vivian's fingers grazed the piano keys. "How about this - you'll publicly apologize to me and Sophia Evans, admitting all your years of manipulation."

Victoria's face drained of color.

"Too scared to wager?" Vivian's smile didn't reach her eyes.

"You're on!" Victoria spat through gritted teeth.

Ethan's eyes narrowed.

This had just gotten interesting.

He edged closer.

Needing to see every detail.

Vivian's fingers danced across the keys.

She launched into "Devil's Trill Sonata."

The notoriously difficult piece.

Victoria's expression grew increasingly strained.

The music stopped abruptly.

Vivian rose gracefully. "Your turn."

Dead silence.

All eyes waited for Victoria's humiliation.

Ethan couldn't suppress his chuckle.

His woman never disappointed.
###Chapter 231

"Not a chance!" Victoria Roscente refused without hesitation.

How could she possibly lose to Vivian Laurent? If she couldn't even defeat an amateur, her reputation as the protégé of a piano maestro would become a laughingstock.

"A bet needs stakes," Vivian pressed.

Victoria scoffed. "If I lose, I'll never touch a piano again!"

She was certain of her victory. Even against professional pianists, she had full confidence—let alone someone with no foundation like Vivian.

Vivian smirked. "Add one more condition. If you lose, you'll French kiss a toad for one minute and post the video online."

Victoria's stomach churned. Just imagining the scene made her nauseous.

This was outright humiliation!

Was Vivian trying to force her to back out with this disgusting bet?

Dream on!

Even if she had to swallow a cockroach, she would compete. Because she would never lose.

"Deal," Victoria agreed readily.

Vivian scanned the room. "Everyone here is a witness."

The onlookers exchanged uneasy glances. Vivian seemed so confident—did she actually have a chance?

Why humiliate herself in a clearly unwinnable situation?

Victoria dropped her facade. "All of you will judge. The loser must fulfill the terms!"

Vivian shook her head. "Most of you are Victoria's friends. You'd be biased. Besides, amateurs can't properly evaluate professional performances."

Victoria had prepared for this. "I know several piano maestros. Let's video call them as judges. Professional enough for you?"

"Fine," Vivian agreed.

Victoria immediately made the call. With her connections, summoning a few maestros was effortless.

Three legendary pianists soon appeared on the screen.

"Victoria, when are you visiting? Your mentor and I were just talking about you," one maestro greeted warmly.

Victoria replied sweetly, "I'll drop by soon." She shot Vivian a triumphant glance, flaunting her status.

With the three maestros presiding, the competition began.

"Who goes first?" Victoria demanded impatiently.

Vivian gestured politely. "Since you're in such a hurry, you can start."

"Fine!" Victoria strode to the piano with her chin held high.

She deliberately chose an extremely difficult virtuoso piece. After this performance, Vivian would probably be too intimidated to even touch the keys.
###Chapter 232

Vivian Laurent gazed at Victoria Roscente with calm, unreadable eyes.

She wanted to see how skilled the disciple of Maestro Fredette truly was.

That man had disappeared completely after losing to her two years ago. Pathetic.

Victoria sat gracefully before the crystal grand piano, her slender fingers dancing across the keys.

She'd deliberately chosen a technically demanding piece, the notes flying by in a dazzling blur.

"My God, I've practiced this for ten years and still can't play it properly."

"That finger speed is inhuman. Vivian doesn't stand a chance."

"Truly worthy of Maestro Fredette's student."

The surrounding praise made Victoria's lips curve slightly.

But in her moment of distraction, a single note slipped past.

The tempo in the climax was too fast—her fingers trembled slightly.

Though the mistake lasted only half a beat, Vivian's sharp ears caught it.

"Magnificent!"

"This was the piece that made Maestro Fredette famous, wasn't it?"

Even the judges on the phone praised enthusiastically.

Victoria smirked at Vivian. "Your turn."

She didn't believe Vivian could surpass her.

Ethan Roscente clenched his fists nervously.

Piano was Victoria's forte. Could Vivian win?

Even if she lost...

He silently vowed to find her no matter what.

Yet Vivian remained composed.

"No rush."

Victoria raised an eyebrow. "Afraid?"

"I just want to point out your mistakes first."

Victoria's heart skipped a beat.

Had she noticed?
###Chapter 233

Vivian Laurent curled her lips in disdain. "Is this all Maestro Fredette's prized student can do?"

Victoria Roscente's face turned ashen with rage. "How dare you say that, Vivian? Why don't you try playing it yourself?"

"Play as poorly as you?" Vivian scoffed. "I wouldn't dirty my hands."

Victoria clenched her fists. "The judges praised my performance. Who do you think you are?"

"Just because the judges missed your mistakes doesn't mean they weren't there." Vivian pulled out her phone. "Would you like to hear your performance again?"

The slowed-down recording played. At 0.2x speed, the missed notes and sloppy rhythm were unmistakable.

Gasps rippled through the audience.

The judges exchanged uneasy glances. The Devil's Waltz was notoriously difficult, and they had indeed overlooked those minor flaws.

Victoria paled. "This—"

The head judge cleared his throat. "There may be some imperfections, but the overall execution was impressive."

Victoria seized the lifeline. "See? Just completing this piece is an achievement!"

"For an amateur, perhaps." Vivian adjusted her cuffs with deliberate calm. "But you're Maestro Fredette's protégé. Fifteen years of training, and this is what you produce?"

She locked eyes with Victoria. "I wonder what expression the maestro would wear if he heard his star student butcher the Devil's Waltz into the Out-of-Tune Waltz?"

Victoria's fingers trembled.

Whispers spread through the crowd. Phones lifted, cameras zooming in on her frozen figure.

Vivian turned toward the grand piano. "Let me show you what a real performance sounds like."
###Chapter 234

Victoria Roscente's face flushed crimson instantly.

Her fists clenched tightly. "If you're so good, why don't you play? Let's see how amazing you really are!"

Vivian Laurent walked toward the grand piano with effortless grace.

Under the crystal chandelier, her simple attire stood in stark contrast to the opulent surroundings. Curious gazes followed her every move.

Could this girl really play?

Yet her eyes held unwavering confidence.

Ethan Roscente's heart pounded. If she lost, would she really leave?

Vivian's fingers hovered above the keys.

The room held its breath.

"Wait." She paused abruptly. "Someone prepare that toad."

"How dare you!" Victoria trembled with rage.

She discreetly activated her phone's recording function. The internet would soon witness Vivian's humiliation.

"Make sure you get a clear recording." Vivian scanned the crowd. "Wouldn't want anyone accusing me of cheating."

Her tone was light, as if this were mere entertainment.

"Are you playing or not?" Victoria snapped impatiently.

Music erupted without warning.

Vivian's fingers became a blur. The same passage that had tripped Victoria flowed flawlessly under her touch.

Gasps filled the room.

Those inhuman speeds!

Victoria's face drained of color.

Vivian hadn't been lying. She hadn't lacked skill—only interest.

"My God! Are those even human hands?"
"She actually knows how to play!"

After a brief interlude, the music transformed.

"It's Rachmaninoff's Third!" someone cried out.
"She's insane! Even professionals avoid this piece!"
"Every note pushes human limits..."

The audience sat paralyzed.

Yet Vivian played with liquid ease. Sorrow, passion, mischief—every emotion danced through her fingertips.

The final note faded.

Silence.

The crowd remained spellbound, still lost in the performance's brilliance.
###Chapter 235

Vivian Laurent rose slowly, her fingers lifting from the piano keys.

"How was that?"

The room was so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Someone stammered, "Vivian... who taught you to play like that?"

"Self-taught," she replied casually.

The audience gasped.

"And... what was that transition between the two pieces? It was breathtaking!"

"Improvised," Vivian adjusted her sleeves.

The crowd erupted.

She'd composed that flawless bridge on the spot? How was that even possible?

All eyes turned to Victoria Roscente.

The winner was clear.

Vivian glanced at Victoria's phone. "Judges, it's time to announce the results."

A long silence came from the other end of the line.

"Young lady..." One judge suddenly sounded emotional. "I feel like I've seen you somewhere before."

"Wait!" Another judge interrupted. "We need to bring in someone else."

Soon, a familiar voice came through Victoria's phone.

"Victoria? What are you doing overseas?"

"Maestro!" Victoria exclaimed in delight.

The room buzzed with shock.

It was Maestro Fredette!

"My student is competing?" Fredette cut straight to the point. "Did she lose?"

Victoria paled. "Maestro, the results aren't out yet!"

The three judges exchanged glances.

Was there even any doubt?

"Fredette, your student's quite stubborn," Vivian remarked suddenly.

The crowd froze.

That familiar tone...

"Losing to you is normal," Fredette sighed.

Victoria's eyes widened.

"What do you mean, 'normal'?" Vivian raised an eyebrow.

"If even I lost to you, how could she win?" Fredette stated frankly.

Vivian waved a hand. "Don't say such things with everyone listening!"

The room exploded.

That rumor from two years ago...

It was true!
###Chapter 236

Maestro Fredette admitted frankly, "The skill gap is obvious. Victoria is clearly outmatched."

For two years, he had practiced that piece behind closed doors. Yet he could never capture the emotion Vivian played with.

Time had diluted his obsession. He had long since let it go.

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Perfect timing. Your disciple made a bet with me. The loser has to French kiss a toad, and the video gets posted online. You're in for a treat."

Maestro Fredette: "..."

He'd rather miss such an embarrassing spectacle.

Victoria Roscente finally remembered the wager. Her face turned deathly pale.

French kissing a toad? The mere thought made her nauseous.

What should she do?

Nearby, Ethan Roscente watched Vivian shimmering under the crystal chandelier. A flash of admiration crossed his eyes.

She always delivered unexpected surprises.

Just how many more secrets did this woman hold?

"I...I haven't lost yet!" Victoria made a last-ditch effort.

Though Vivian had outperformed her teacher, the judges hadn't announced the results.

Vivian smiled coolly. "Judges, it's time to declare the winner."

The judges sighed. "Victoria, this lady's skill speaks for itself. We declare her the winner."

"Admit defeat," Vivian said calmly. "Any more excuses would just make you a sore loser."

Victoria's face turned ashen as she glared venomously at Vivian.

This woman had humiliated her beyond measure!

"There aren't any toads here!" Victoria grasped at her final straw.

Vivian had anticipated this. "I had some delivered. Thoughtful of me, wasn't it?"

As she hung up, a waiter arrived with a crate of toads.

The crowd recoiled, especially the troublemaking woman who wished she could vanish.

Thank goodness they hadn't crossed Vivian, or else...

"Plenty of varieties to choose from," Vivian said cheerfully.

The toads' bumpy skin, bulging eyes, and foul stench were revolting.

The sight alone turned stomachs, let alone the thought of kissing one.
###Chapter 237

Victoria Roscente's vision darkened, her knees nearly giving way.

Too bad she hadn't mastered Sophia Evans' talent for fainting on command.

"Victoria, stop stalling." Vivian Laurent dangled the toad in front of her. "Everyone's waiting. Even your mentor is watching."

Panic finally gripped Victoria.

"I concede, Vivian!" Her voice trembled. "I was arrogant to challenge you in piano..."

She bit her lip, resentment flashing in her eyes.

"I owe you one. Whatever you need in the future—"

Vivian's laugh was icy.

"Would you have shown me mercy if I'd lost?"

She thrust the toad forward.

"Just one minute. It'll be over quickly."

Victoria's face turned ghostly pale, sweat beading on her forehead.

Suddenly, her eyes rolled back as she collapsed stiffly backward.

"Victoria fainted!" someone shrieked.

"This has gone too far, Vivian!"

Kneeling, Vivian studied the subtle tremors in Victoria's eyelids.

"I'm a doctor," she announced loudly. "General Surgery at Capital Hospital."

"What should we do now?" a bystander asked.

Vivian smirked.

"Simple. One kiss from this toad will revive her instantly."

She brought the amphibian closer to Victoria's face.

"This specimen's particularly potent."

Victoria's eyes flew open as she shoved Vivian away.

"Get away from me!"

She gagged violently.

Vivian stood, surveying the crowd.

"See? Instant cure."

Murmurs of awe rippled through the onlookers.

Vivian lifted the toad again.

"Now that you're awake, let's resume our wager."

Her gaze pinned Victoria's ashen face.

"Still up for that kiss?"
###Chapter 238

"Ribbit—" The toad suddenly let out a piercing croak. Victoria Roscente's stomach churned violently.

She clamped a hand over her mouth, her face deathly pale.

The grotesque amphibian's warty skin oozed a foul stench. She couldn't bring herself to do it.

Her phone screen glowed, showing the ongoing call.

"Maestro!" Victoria's voice trembled. "Please talk to Vivian for me. I can't—"

Maestro Fredette watched his disciple's pitiful state on screen, brows furrowed.

"Vivian," he said gravely. "As a personal favor to me, let this matter rest."

Vivian Laurent chuckled. "Very well. For you."

Victoria sagged with relief, her knees nearly buckling.

"Th-thank you, Maestro—"

"Thank Vivian," Fredette cut in sharply. "Let today's lesson remind you—there's always someone greater."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms.

She could accept defeat from anyone. Anyone but Vivian Laurent!

"I understand," she forced through gritted teeth.

Fredette shook his head in disappointment. "I took you as my student for your talent. Not to watch you use piano as a status symbol."

For years, Victoria had neglected practice, only flaunting her master's name when convenient.

"Your lack of sportsmanship today was disgraceful." His voice turned icy. "Effective immediately, you are no longer my pupil."

Victoria's head snapped up. "Maestro?!"

The livestream chat exploded.

"No! Maestro, I was wrong!" Panic laced her voice. "Give me another chance!"

The call had already ended.

The three judges exchanged uneasy glances.

One ventured hesitantly, "Ms. Laurent, about next month's International Piano Forum—"

"Not interested." Vivian's refusal was crisp.

The room erupted in gasps.

That invitation was the holy grail for pianists worldwide.
###Chapter 239

"Miss Laurent, the International Piano Association cordially invites you to our tour next month. All expenses will be covered." The voice on the phone brimmed with anticipation.

Vivian tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "I regret to decline. My schedule is fully booked. Perhaps another time."

The caller persisted. "We can adjust the dates to accommodate—"

"Next time." She ended the call decisively.

Crystal chandeliers bathed Vivian in golden light as she stood at the center of the ballroom, radiant as a flawless diamond.

Victoria Roscente lurked in the shadows, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

Those admiring gazes should have been hers.

Those lavish praises should have been directed at her.

Now Vivian had stolen everything.

"Miss Laurent, your performance of 'Moonlight Sonata' was transcendental. Might you share your practice routine?" A socialite fluttered closer.

Vivian smiled. "Eight hours of fundamentals daily. Without exception."

Victoria's chest heaved. Her proudest credential—being Maestro Fredette's protégé—had been revoked by the master himself.

All because of Vivian!

"Release it." Vivian signaled a waiter to handle the toad.

Victoria's venomous gaze followed Vivian's retreating figure before she melted into the crowd.

Near a Roman column, Ethan Roscente lingered. Watching Vivian command the room effortlessly, he turned away.

"Shall we depart, Mr. Roscente?" His chauffeur inquired.

Ethan glanced at the illuminated mansion. "Wait."

Inside, Vivian was besieged by admirers.

"Miss Laurent, may I have your contact?" A suited man offered his phone.

Vivian flashed her wedding ring. "My husband wouldn't approve."

"Your spouse must be extraordinary to deserve someone like you."

She answered with an enigmatic smile.

Outside, Victoria dialed a number. "Execute the plan."

Her lips curled as she glanced back at the glittering ballroom. The real battle had just begun.
###Chapter 240

Victoria Roscente and Bianca Semona stood side by side on the second-floor balcony.

Their gazes pierced through the crowd, locking onto Vivian Laurent with venomous intensity.

Bianca took a delicate sip of champagne, her lips curling into a cold smile. "Victoria, she actually dared to humiliate you. The woman has no sense of self-preservation."

Victoria's nails dug deep into her palms.

The memory of her public disgrace at the piano flashed through her mind, igniting a vicious glint in her eyes.

"Bianca, I need your help."

She retrieved a small blue pill from her clutch, its surface glinting ominously under the chandelier lights.

Bianca's pupils contracted. "Is that—"

"A little something to turn the virtuous maiden into a wanton slut." Victoria's smile turned predatory. "Later, make sure everyone gathers in the first room on the left."

Bianca hesitated. "What if—"

"There are no what-ifs." Victoria cut her off. "I've already arranged for five men to be waiting inside."

Her gaze trailed down Vivian's slender neck.

"I want her begging for it like a common whore in front of everyone."

Bianca swallowed hard before nodding in agreement.

Smoothing her expression into one of practiced elegance, Victoria descended the staircase.

She plucked two glasses of red wine from a passing waiter's tray.

With practiced subtlety, she dropped the pill into one of the glasses.

The wine dissolved the pill without a trace.

"Vivian."

Victoria approached the center of the room, offering the tainted glass with a gracious smile.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "More lessons to impart, Miss Roscente?"

"My behavior earlier was unbecoming." Victoria extended the spiked wine. "Consider this my peace offering."

She deliberately raised her voice for the surrounding guests to hear.

"Let's put our differences behind us."

Vivian accepted the glass but didn't drink immediately.

She swirled the crimson liquid with an enigmatic smile. "How remarkably your tune has changed."

Victoria's pulse quickened, but she maintained her composure. "I genuinely wish to be friends."

She drained her own glass in one dramatic swallow.

"Your turn."

All eyes turned to Vivian.

Vivian studied the dark red wine for a long moment before finally smiling.

"Since it's a toast to reconciliation..."

She slowly raised the glass to her lips.
###Chapter 241

"Fine." Vivian agreed without hesitation.

A flicker of surprise crossed Victoria's eyes.

She hadn't expected such immediate compliance.

This bitch would regret it soon enough!

Suppressing her hatred, Victoria forced a smile. "Let's drink to that."

She elegantly raised her wine glass.

Vivian lifted her own glass, lightly clinking it against Victoria's.

The unnatural warmth against her fingertips confirmed her suspicions.

The wine was definitely tampered with.

It would be stranger if Victoria hadn't drugged it.

Those predatory eyes were practically glued to her drink.

Victoria stared obsessively at Vivian's hand, willing her to drink.

Just as Vivian raised the glass, she "accidentally" bumped Victoria's wrist.

Crash!

The crystal shattered on the floor.

"Did you do that on purpose?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"Just clumsy hands." Victoria gritted her teeth. "Bring another glass!"

She snapped at the servant.

Only Vivian's drink had been spiked anyway.

A fresh glass of red wine arrived promptly.

"Oh my!" Vivian suddenly gasped. "There's a spider in your hair!"

"What?" Victoria shrieked, jumping up in panic.

She frantically patted her styled locks.

Seizing the moment, Vivian subtly switched their glasses.

"Check it now!" Victoria screeched.

The servant inspected and shook her head. "Nothing there."

"My mistake." Vivian smiled. "The lighting played tricks."

Victoria studied Vivian suspiciously.

Seeing the untouched glass still in Vivian's hand, she relaxed.

"Cheers." Victoria raised her drink. "After this, we're friends."

"Naturally." Vivian downed hers in one go.

Triumph flashed in Victoria's eyes.

This was a powerful aphrodisiac she'd acquired at great cost.

Once it took effect, Vivian would become a shameless slut.

The mental image alone made her chuckle.

"Your turn." Vivian reminded.

Victoria smugly drained her glass.

Vivian's lips curved slightly.

The show was about to begin.
###Chapter 242

The ballroom buzzed with elegantly dressed guests clinking glasses.

Victoria Roscente held her wineglass, her gaze fixed on Vivian Laurent across the room.

She took a sip of red wine, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"The drug should take effect soon," she calculated silently.

Vivian suddenly pressed a hand to her forehead. "Victoria, I'm not feeling well."

Victoria's heart leaped with joy as she rushed to support her. "You must have had too much to drink. Let me help you rest."

A strange warmth spread through her own body, but she dismissed it as alcohol.

"The first guest room upstairs is vacant. I'll take you there."

As Victoria turned to leave after opening the door, Vivian grabbed her wrist.

"Don't rush off," Vivian said, her voice suddenly clear. "We should talk."

Victoria fought against her growing discomfort. "About what?"

"About how Sophia Evans used you as her pawn." Vivian chuckled. "The great Victoria Roscente, reduced to being someone else's attack dog."

Victoria's face darkened. "How dare you!"

"You personally drugged the wine, didn't you?" Vivian stood up gracefully. "Pity you drank the wrong glass."

Victoria's legs weakened as realization dawned. "You... switched our glasses?"

Vivian smoothed her dress. "Better late than never. Oh, and those men in the bathroom? Your own handpicked selections."

She paused at the doorway with a radiant smile. "Good luck."

The door clicked shut just as the bathroom door burst open.
###Chapter 243

Victoria Roscente's legs suddenly gave way as she took a step.

A strange heat surged through her body.

She realized with horror that the drink had been spiked.

The drug took effect rapidly, making her skin burn.

"Vivian Laurent!" She gritted out the name through clenched teeth.

The figure at the end of the hallway had already vanished.

Victoria braced herself against the wall, nails digging into her palms.

She knew exactly how potent this drug was.

An unfamiliar hunger coiled deep inside her.

The restroom door swung open.

Several men filed out.

"Need some help, sweetheart?"

The leader reached out to steady her swaying body.

Victoria instinctively pressed closer.

The coolness of his clothes against her skin made her sigh in relief.

"Lock the door," someone muttered.

The metallic click of the lock echoed sharply.

By the time the men surrounded her, Victoria had already torn open her collar.

"Miss Roscente?"

A shocked voice exploded near her ear.

She blinked dazedly at the panicked faces around her.

"Why is it you?"

The men exchanged uneasy glances.

They'd expected another woman.

Victoria's rationality was crumbling.

She grabbed the nearest man, pressing her feverish lips to his neck.

"Give me..."

Her voice dripped with unnatural sweetness.

The men scrambled back in alarm.

"Stop! You need to snap out of it!"

Someone pulled out a phone and started recording.

"This is proof you came onto us."

The camera lens focused on her flushed face.

Victoria shrugged off her jacket, exposing pale skin to the air.

"I order you..."

Her breathing grew ragged.

The men retreated further, phones still raised.

She slithered toward them like a serpent.

The footage captured every obscene movement.

"Move...or I'll kill you..."

Her threat trembled with desperate need.

No one dared touch her. No one dared leave.

Victoria had no idea how disgraceful she looked.

She only wanted release.

The trap meant for another had ensnared her instead.
###Chapter 244

The door clicked shut silently behind Vivian.

She stood in the hallway, a cold smirk curling her lips.

Victoria Roscente had meticulously set this trap. Now she would taste the bitterness of her own scheme.

If Victoria had known her place, she wouldn't have ended up like this.

Vivian was merely restoring order.

Bored with the impending spectacle, she turned toward the opposite room.

Her phone screen lit up as she shared tea party updates in the F4 group chat.

The internet was ablaze.

Her piano performance video had gone viral, even earning Maestro Fredette's personal endorsement.

"Just a casual countermove," Vivian typed dismissively.

Finn Deross immediately responded: "Master! How am I supposed to show off now? What if someone defeats you—"

"Piss off," Vivian replied succinctly.

Lucas Lefèvre chimed in: "Viv's unbeatable. Never seen anyone surpass her."

Isabella Langley interrupted: "Hello? Am I invisible here?"

"You're all legends!" Finn backpedaled. "I'll train harder to catch up!"

Isabella spammed exclamation marks: "Should've gone with you! Viv, give me live updates!"

Vivian's fingers hovered over the screen when hurried footsteps echoed down the hall.

Bianca Semona crouched outside Victoria's door, cheeks flushed.

The unmistakable sounds from within made her tremble with excitement.

She dashed downstairs, shrieking: "Everyone! Vivian's upstairs with men!"

Guests exchanged uneasy glances.

"Impossible..."

"Miss Laurent wouldn't..."

Bianca shrilled over them: "I heard it! Multiple men! She's nothing but a common whore!"

Whispers swelled like tide.

Servants muttered: "Miss Laurent isn't that type..."

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente shifted restlessly in his car.

He flung the door open and strode toward the villa.
###Chapter 245

Bianca Semona stormed up the staircase with a gaggle of socialites, her stilettos hammering against the marble steps like gunfire.

"Listen!" She jabbed a manicured finger at the locked door, triumph twisting her features. "That bitch Vivian is inside."

The unmistakable sounds of intimacy seeped through the wood, staining the cheeks of sheltered debutantes crimson.

"Oh my god, how shameless—"

"I always knew she was trash!" Bianca shrieked. "Playing the ice queen while secretly—"

A disturbance rippled through the crowd at the far end of the hallway.

The sea of bodies parted instinctively.

Ethan Roscente strode forward, his suit jacket slung over one arm, tie hanging loose around his neck. Fresh off a transatlantic flight, he hadn't even bothered to fasten his collar.

"Ethan!" Bianca rushed toward him, eyes glittering.

He looked straight through her.

His gaze locked onto the door like a predator sighting prey, storm clouds gathering in those obsidian depths.

"Vivian's in there?" The question came out glacial.

Bianca shrank back. "Y-yes..."

Ethan's fist crashed against the door.

"Open it!"

No one moved.

He kicked the solid oak. It didn't budge.

"Mr. Roscente, perhaps we should call security—" someone ventured.

"Fuck off!"

At that moment, the door across the hall clicked open.

Vivian emerged rubbing sleep from her eyes, still wearing her performance gown.

"What's all the noise about?"

Silence swallowed the corridor whole.

Bianca's face drained of color. "H-how are you—"

Vivian leaned against the doorframe, yawning. "I was exhausted after the recital and borrowed a room to nap. And you all are...?"

Her gaze drifted to the source of the scandalous sounds. Understanding dawned. "Ah, that's just housekeeping. They've got the radio turned up rather loud."

Ethan crossed the distance in three strides.

He hauled her against his chest, arms banding like steel cables.

"You scared me half to death." His voice shook.

Vivian wheezed against his crushing embrace but found herself inexplicably soothed. She patted his back gently. "I'm fine."

Bianca's scream shattered the moment. "Impossible! I saw you drink the spiked champagne!"

Vivian lifted her head from Ethan's shoulder, eyes turning arctic.

"So it was you." She smoothed her skirt with deliberate slowness. "I never touched that glass."

Turning to the assembled crowd, her voice carried clearly. "Though Miss Semona seems awfully familiar with its contents. One might wonder..."

The implication hung in the air, damning.

Bianca stumbled backward, pallid. "No! It was Victoria—"

Danger flashed in Ethan's gaze.

"Perfect." He released Vivian and pulled out his phone. "Simon, call the police."
###Chapter 246

The air froze instantly.

Vivian stiffened in Ethan Roscente's arms, her nose filled with his familiar icy scent. His arms tightened around her like steel bands, squeezing the breath from her lungs.

Bianca Semona's nails dug into her palms. She stared at the embracing couple, jealousy burning in her eyes. Victoria had been right—this vixen had stolen Ethan's heart.

Why did she have to be named Vivian too?

If she changed her name to Vivian, would Ethan look at her the same way?

"Let go!" Vivian whispered sharply, pressing a hand against Ethan's chest. She could feel the scorching gazes of the crowd prickling her back.

Ethan finally released her, his eyes scanning her body. "Are you hurt?" His voice held a barely detectable tremor.

"Why would I be?" Vivian blinked innocently. "What's all the commotion about?"

Her peripheral vision caught the colorful expressions around them. A cold smirk curled inside her. If they wanted to put on a show, she'd play along.

"How are you here?" Bianca shrieked. She distinctly remembered Victoria saying Vivian was in the first room on the left, but now...

Ambiguous sounds drifted from the opposite room. Bianca's face drained of color as realization struck.

"Miss Semona claimed you were upstairs with a man," someone helpfully supplied.

Vivian feigned surprise. "I felt unwell from drinking. Victoria brought me here." She glanced around. "Where is she, by the way?"

Her words were like a stone tossed into still water.

"Get the key!" Ethan barked. His jaw clenched as he stared at the locked door.

Bianca threw herself against the door. "N-no need! I must have remembered wrong..."

"Remembered wrong?" Vivian chuckled. "You brought all these people up here for a show, didn't you?" She turned to the crowd. "If some girl really is in trouble, delaying help would make you legally liable."

Murmurs rippled through the gathering.

Ethan radiated terrifying coldness. "Move."

Bianca staggered back, her face ashen. She prayed desperately: Please don't let it be Victoria...
###Chapter 247

The door burst open with a deafening crash.

Five disheveled men fumbled with their belts in panic.

They had been hired to defile Vivian Laurent here.

But the woman on the bed was Victoria Roscente instead.

"What the hell?" The lead thug wiped cold sweat from his forehead.

Before they could dress properly, a crowd had gathered outside.

The room reeked of sex and sweat.

The bedsheet was crumpled. Shredded clothes littered the floor.

Victoria lay naked, her face flushed with unnatural heat.

"More..." she moaned, reaching for the nearest man.

"My god!" Society ladies at the doorway covered their mouths.

More people pushed forward for a better view.

"Isn't that the Roscente heiress?" someone gasped.

Bianca Semona turned pale, her nails digging into her palms.

She had watched Vivian drink that wine herself.

Ethan Roscente's expression darkened dangerously.

He handed his suit jacket to Vivian. "Cover her."

Vivian accepted it, her eyes flashing coldly.

Had she not been prepared, she would be the one lying there.

She approached the bed and draped the jacket over Victoria.

"Don't stop..." Victoria grabbed Vivian's wrist drunkenly.

Vivian struck her neck with a precise chop.

Victoria collapsed instantly.

"Who hired you?" Ethan's voice could freeze hell.

The men dropped to their knees.

"Miss Roscente...she wanted us to ruin Miss Laurent..."

One trembling man raised his phone. "We have video proof!"

The footage clearly showed Victoria initiating contact.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

Though he cared nothing for his cousin, the family name was at stake.

"She promised us five million afterward..."

"Told us she'd bring witnesses to catch them in bed..."

The men tripped over each other confessing.

Gasps erupted from the crowd.

This scandal would dominate high society gossip for years.
###Chapter 248

Vivian Laurent feigned shock perfectly. "Miss Roscente... surely you don't mean me?"

Her fingers trembled against her chest. "Victoria came to me with wine, saying we should bury the past. I trusted her and drank it, never imagining..."

Tears glistened in her eyes. "I came to this High Tea Party in good faith, yet she plotted to ruin me. Heaven showed mercy by turning her own scheme against her."

With those carefully chosen words, Vivian absolved herself completely.

Victoria Roscente had reaped what she sowed.

The guests exchanged disgusted glances.

"A Roscente heiress resorting to such vile tricks?"

"Serves her right for drinking her own poison."

"All that aristocratic pretense hides a viper."

Ethan Roscente's expression darkened. The family's reputation demanded damage control.

"If a single word of this leaks..." His razor-sharp gaze swept the crowd. "The Roscente Group will hunt you down."

Silence fell like a guillotine.

Nobody crossed the empire that ruled the capital.

"Your secret is safe with us," a guest hastily assured.

Ethan gave a curt nod. "This event is over."

As the crowd dispersed, Bianca Semona stood frozen.

"Vivian was your original target?" Ethan's voice could frost glass.

Bianca turned ghostly pale. "I... I don't know anything..."

She grabbed her clutch with shaking hands. "It's late. I should go."

Ethan led Vivian into the moonlit gardens.

"You knew about Victoria's plan."

Vivian arched a brow. "Here to avenge her?"

"I merely switched the glasses." Her gaze never wavered. "The drug was hers. The man was her accomplice."

A cold breeze stirred her hair as she delivered her final blow. "I'm not some helpless lamb, Ethan Roscente. If you want war, you'll get it."

Her eyes gleamed colder than the moonlight.
###Chapter 249

Ethan Roscente's voice was low. "I'm not here to accuse you."

Vivian Laurent froze for a moment.

Her clenched fists loosened slightly.

"Are you hurt?" he asked.

She pressed her lips together. "No."

"My driver will take you home." Ethan paused. "Victoria won't let this go."

Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"If she bothers you, call me anytime." He added, "I'm not asking you to tolerate it."

She chuckled coldly. "She's the one who should be hiding."

Her gaze sharpened like a blade.

"If there's a next time, I won't hesitate to end her."

Ethan nodded. "Understood."

He watched Vivian leave before dialing Victor Roscente's number.

Victor was enjoying himself at an exclusive club.

Seeing the caller ID, he sneered and tossed his phone aside.

Until he read the text message.

"Damn it!" Victor kicked open the private room door and stormed out.

The Roscente mansion blazed with lights.

Several men knelt on the floor, trembling violently.

Victoria Roscente lay unconscious, her clothes disheveled.

"Wake her up," Victor commanded coldly.

A bucket of ice water drenched Victoria.

She jolted awake with a gasp.

Her entire body shook uncontrollably.

Fire raced through her veins.

As her vision cleared, she saw:

Ethan's impassive face.

Her father's livid expression.

And—

The filthy men kneeling on the floor.

A scream shattered the night.

Victoria lunged at the men.

Her nails dug deep into their flesh.

"I'll kill you all!"

Her voice cracked with hysteria.

Ethan watched dispassionately.

"Your friends saw everything," he said calmly. "Better think about how to silence them."
###Chapter 250 Ethan's Close Protection

Ethan's warning had intimidated some, but the news still spread like wildfire.

Victoria clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms. Her entire body trembled, vision darkening at the edges.

Everyone knew now.

Her shame, her disgrace—all laid bare under the harsh light.

A hysterical scream tore through the silence.

Vivian!

It was all that damned Vivian's fault!

Madness burned in Victoria's eyes. She wouldn't just make those men pay—she'd make Vivian suffer too.

The halo of a wealthy heiress had shattered. Her life was ruined beyond repair.

...

Vivian returned home, indifferent to the whole spectacle.

A hot bath later, she slipped into bed and fell asleep almost instantly.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains.

Stretching lazily, Vivian headed downstairs feeling refreshed.

Her steps faltered at the sight of a tall figure lounging on her sofa.

"How did you get in?" She frowned.

Ethan dangled a key. "Had a copy made last time I stayed here."

"This is my house!" Vivian's eyes widened.

"I'll call ahead next time." His expression remained unreadable.

"Hand it over." She extended her palm.

"Spare keys are practical." He pocketed it smoothly. "In case you get locked out."

"It's a smart lock!"

"What if the battery dies?" Ethan countered without missing a beat. "Consider it a safety measure."

Vivian made a mental note to change the locks.

"Where's your shadow?" His gaze swept the room, finding no trace of Finn.

"None of your business." She crossed her arms. "Why are you here?"

"Breakfast delivery. And a ride to work." He gestured to the takeout box on the table.

"A wolf bringing gifts?" Vivian scoffed. "Victoria's brother playing nice with me?"

"I'm here for your protection." Ethan's tone turned serious. "Victoria won't let this go."

"Bodyguard duty?" She let out a derisive laugh. "You think I need one?"

"I know you can handle yourself." His gaze darkened. "But Victoria's dangerous right now."

"Appreciate the concern." Vivian turned toward the dining area. "But I don't need a babysitter."

Especially not from the Roscente family.
###Chapter 251

"It's a necessary precaution. We can't afford to wait until something happens."

"Nothing will happen." Vivian's voice was firm.

Ethan frowned. "There's always a possibility."

She looked up at him. "Whose side are you on? As Victoria's brother, shouldn't you hate me?"

"She brought it upon herself." His tone was low. "But Victor won't let this go. You should leave the country for now."

"I don't have time for this." Vivian waved him off impatiently. "Stop causing trouble."

"I'm just concerned about your safety."

"If you're so free, go protect your precious Sophia."

At the mention of that name, Ethan's expression hardened. Those rumors needed to be addressed.

"Vivian, about Sophia and me—"

"The media lied. You've already clarified. I know."

"No, you don't." He stepped closer. "There's nothing between us. We've barely spoken in years."

She scoffed. "Then who were you seeing every day in Eudora?"

Ethan hesitated. He had seen Sophia daily—because of Theo.

"Liar." Her eyes burned with contempt. "Who was it that chased her to the airport and got into that accident? Don't pretend to care now."

"I never had feelings for her."

"Enough!" Vivian grabbed her car keys. "I'm going to be late."

She slammed the car door and drove off. Ethan followed at a distance until she safely reached the hospital.

"Simon," he called his assistant. "Send a team of professional bodyguards to protect Vivian discreetly."

At the hospital, Vivian's colleagues regarded her with admiration.

"Morning. Coffee's on me." She placed the order with a smile.

"Dr. Laurent!" someone gasped. "The internet says you're the founder of AN Atelier? And a piano virtuoso?"

The staff finally learned about the young doctor's astonishing identities.
###Chapter 252 The Heart of a Healer

"Dr. Laurent, how could a medical genius like you be content working as a regular physician at our hospital?"

"Exactly. If it were me, I'd be traveling the world by now."

"Dr. Laurent, we were blind before. Not only is your medical skill extraordinary, but you've achieved so much professionally."

Vivian stood in the hospital corridor, her lab coat fluttering slightly in the breeze. The once skeptical gazes had transformed into looks of admiration.

She adjusted her cuffs with a slight bow of her head. "Medicine is my calling. With passion and perseverance, everyone can shine in their chosen field."

Before the other doctors could continue, Vivian briskly fastened her coat. "Clinic hours are starting."

Today, Ryan Fairsprene volunteered as her assistant. Though still an intern, Vivian recognized his skills surpassed that level.

Her appointment slots filled instantly when registration opened.

"Please come in." Vivian gestured for the first patient to sit.

"Doctor, my back muscles hurt terribly. Pain patches don't help."

After one glance, Vivian immediately picked up the phone. "You need emergency cardiac evaluation. I'll arrange priority admission with the department head."

"But it's just muscle pain?" The patient looked confused.

"Myocardial ischemia can radiate to the back. You're at risk of a heart attack right now." She turned to Ryan. "Escort this gentleman for testing."

Thirty minutes later, Ryan rushed back. "Severe coronary artery blockage! Cardiology said another hour could've been fatal."

Vivian continued writing notes without looking up. "Clinical experience matters. Symptoms often deceive."

"Noted." Ryan nodded solemnly.

The clinic became a medical masterclass. Complex cases Vivian handled with ease, some conditions even textbooks hadn't documented yet she provided precise solutions.

Cheers periodically rose from the waiting area. Cured patients returned with gratitude gifts, family members bowed in tearful thanks.

Watching these reborn smiles, Ryan tightened his grip on the medical charts. He would become a healer like Dr. Laurent - someone who upheld life's fragile hopes.
###Chapter 253

"Dr. Laurent, are you free for dinner tonight?" Ryan Fairsprene stood at the clinic doorway, several pens tucked into his lab coat pocket.

This was his third invitation this month. Vivian had declined the previous two, citing work commitments. Today, he'd deliberately chosen the moment right after her surgery.

Vivian looked up from organizing patient files. "Sure. I'm starving."

Ryan's eyes lit up. He hadn't expected her to agree this time.

"My treat," he quickly added.

She snapped the file shut and tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Can an intern's salary cover it? Let me pay."

"I can afford it!" Ryan's ears turned red. "I've been saving."

Vivian chuckled. "Next time. Let's invite Dr. Clementson today."

Ryan's smile froze, but he quickly recovered. "Okay. I'll ask Dr. Clementson."

Nathan Clementson was doing rounds in the ICU. He declined the invitation. "You two go ahead. I need to monitor the post-op coronary bypass patient."

"Next time then." Vivian shrugged.

In the hospital corridor, Ryan walked half a step behind her, watching her ponytail sway with each stride.

"What do you feel like eating?" Vivian suddenly turned around.

Ryan nearly collided with her and stumbled back. "Anything... is fine."

"Let's do Italian. I know a good place." She pulled out her car keys. "I'll drive."

Neither noticed the black Mercedes parked outside. Ethan Roscente sat inside, fingers drumming the steering wheel as he watched Vivian open the passenger door for the young doctor.

Soft lighting and faint violin music filled the restaurant.

"Two filet mignons, medium rare." Vivian closed the menu. "And a bottle of red."

Ryan fidgeted with his hands. "Do you come here often, Dr. Laurent?"

"Occasionally." She sipped her water. "When I'm in a good mood."

He gathered his courage. "So... is it because of me today?"

Vivian raised an eyebrow but didn't answer.

After their meals arrived, Ryan hesitated several times before speaking. Finally, Vivian put down her knife. "Something on your mind?"

"Dr. Laurent..." He took a deep breath. "Are you seeing anyone?"

Her silver knife clinked against the plate.

Vivian set down her utensils and smirked. "Trying to ask me out?"
###Chapter 254

Ryan Fairsprene's fingers drummed absently against the tabletop. His heart pounded so hard it threatened to break free from his chest.

"I was...asking for a colleague in the department," he stammered, his ears turning crimson.

Vivian Laurent studied the flustered young man before her, the corners of her lips lifting slightly.

"I'm divorced. Not interested in relationships right now."

Her tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Ryan's eyes brightened. Nathan Clementson had mentioned this, but hearing it firsthand still sent a jolt through him.

"Divorce is great!" The words tumbled out before he could stop himself. Realizing his blunder, he quickly amended, "I mean, that bastard didn't deserve—"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You seem awfully happy about my divorce."

"No!" Ryan waved his hands frantically. "I just think...Dr. Laurent deserves better."

Summoning his courage, he asked, "What's your type, anyway?"

Vivian set down her chopsticks and met his gaze directly.

"Currently not interested in men. Being single suits me just fine—why invite trouble?"

Her voice remained light. "A campus heartthrob like you must have girls lining up."

Ryan's smile froze. The unspoken message was clear.

"Dr. Laurent, actually I—"

"Vivian."

A deep male voice cut him off. Ethan Roscente approached with long strides, his tailored suit immaculate.

"What a coincidence," he said without batting an eye.

Vivian rolled hers. This man had followed her for three blocks—"coincidence" was a stretch.

Ethan pulled out a chair and sat, signaling the waiter for another place setting.

"And you are?" His sharp gaze landed on Ryan.

"Ryan Fairsprene. Dr. Laurent's colleague." The younger man forced a polite smile.

Under the table, Vivian pinched Ethan's thigh hard. The man didn't flinch, merely raising his wine glass.

"Thank you for looking after our Vivian at the hospital."

He emphasized "our" with deliberate weight.

Ryan's grip on his glass faltered. The CEO of Roscente Group's presence was suffocating.

Seeing them side by side, their chemistry was undeniable.

Suddenly, everything made sense.
###Chapter 255

Ryan Fairsprene nervously rubbed his hands together. "Dr. Laurent took care of me during my hospital stay. I feel terribly indebted."

Ethan Roscente's lips curved slightly. "Our Vivian has always been exceptional. But thank you nonetheless." He deliberately emphasized the word "our."

Vivian's brow furrowed.

Since when did she belong to him?

The man was clearly staking his claim, as if she were his property.

"Ethan, I didn't invite you to dinner. Please leave."

Ethan remained unfazed. "Fate brought us together. I'm sure Dr. Fairsprene won't mind an extra guest?"

Ryan forced a smile. "Of course not."

"Then let's order two more dishes. My treat." Ethan casually took the menu from the waiter.

The food arrived quickly. Only Ethan seemed at ease during the meal.

Ryan sat stiffly, his anticipated romantic dinner now awkwardly transformed into a trio.

Vivian barely tasted her food. Ethan's presence made the very air feel oppressive.

Yet he kept serving her dishes. "Eat more."

When dinner finally ended, Vivian grabbed her purse. "Dr. Fairsprene, let me drive you home."

She couldn't abandon a patient.

Ryan initially wanted to decline, but one look at Ethan's predatory gaze changed his mind. "Thank you, Dr. Laurent."

"Wait." Ethan's voice cut through.

Ryan tensed. "Is there something else, Mr. Roscente?"

"Having a lady chauffeur you seems improper, don't you think?" Ethan's tone carried hidden meaning.

Understanding dawned on Ryan. "I can drive."

A glint flashed in Ethan's eyes as he tossed his car keys.

Ryan fumbled to catch them, then stared in shock at the Maybach key fob.

"Since Dr. Fairsprene can drive, take my car home." Ethan turned to Vivian with a triumphant smile. "Now I'm without transportation. Surely you won't mind giving me a ride, Dr. Laurent?"

Vivian was speechless with anger.

Ryan gaped.

The audacity was breathtaking.

"Mr. Roscente, this car is too valuable..." Ryan's palms grew damp.

"Don't worry about damages." Ethan waved dismissively. "It's just a means of transport to me."

For the first time, Ryan truly understood the chasm between their worlds.

Ethan had already positioned himself beside Vivian, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Dr. Laurent, I'm in your care."
###Chapter 256

Ryan Fairsprene's knuckles turned white as he clenched his car keys.

He had to admit defeat against this man.

Ethan Roscente exuded the magnetic charm of a mature gentleman, every movement radiating aristocratic grace.

Those piercing eyes held undisguised hostility when they locked onto him.

"I'll take my leave," Ryan finally conceded.

Vivian Laurent watched his retreating figure before whirling around with a scowl.

"Ethan Roscente, have you no shame?"

The man arched an eyebrow, one hand in his pocket. "Care to elaborate?"

"He can drive you home, but I can't?" Ethan took a step closer. "Or is he more important to you than I am?"

Vivian scoffed. "Exactly. He matters more. Happy now?"

Ethan's gaze darkened instantly.

"What does he have that I don't?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "A reckless boy who can't even take care of himself—what could he possibly offer you?"

"I don't need anything from him." She lifted her chin defiantly. "At least he's young, handsome, fit, and considerate."

Each word made Ethan's expression grow stormier.

"Young?" He gritted his teeth. "I'm only twenty-eight."

"As for physique..." His fingers suddenly undid his suit buttons. "Shall we compare right now?"

Vivian stumbled back in shock, her ears burning.

"Have you lost your mind? I have zero interest in seeing your body!"

Ethan seized her wrist.

"I can be clingy too," he rasped. "Just tell me what you like—I'll become whatever you want."

Struggling against his grip, Vivian flushed with anger.

"Let go! Are all men this childish? Must you always compete?"

Her words gave him pause.

He didn't understand his own irrational behavior either.

The mere thought of other men orbiting Vivian made his chest constrict painfully.

"I just..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Want you to know I'm better than any of them."

Moonlight revealed the faint blush on his earlobes.

"If you ever need..." His voice grew hushed. "You can come to me."

Vivian bristled instantly. "As if! Your performance that night was atrocious!"

Ethan's eyes flashed.

He remembered clearly—she had definitely...

The memory ignited something primal within him.

In one swift motion, he dragged her behind a pillar, caging her against the stone with his imposing frame.

"You—"

"Since Dr. Laurent isn't satisfied," he murmured against her lips. "Shall we practice until perfection?"

His mouth captured hers before she could retort.
###Chapter 257

Vivian's breath was stolen without warning.

Ethan's lips crushed down before she could react. His palm cradled the back of her head with bruising force. The kiss was pure domination, as if he meant to devour her whole.

Her fists pressed against his chest, useless.

When his tongue demanded entry, she caught the faint scent of ambergris on him. This madman—daring to do this outside a restaurant.

"Let—" Her protest vanished between their lips.

She jerked her knee upward, aiming for his most vulnerable spot. The contact made her freeze. He was already fully aroused, the scorching heat evident even through layers of fabric.

Ethan groaned, finally releasing her mouth.

"Dr. Laurent," his voice was gravel-rough, "you're playing with fire."

Her ears burned crimson. "Fire my ass!" She shoved him hard. "Touch me again and I'll make sure you're no longer a man!"

A dark chuckle rumbled in his chest. "Let's test that theory, Vivian."

Like hell! She spun and fled. Her stilettos struck the pavement in sync with her pounding heart. Even inside her car, her hands wouldn't stop trembling.

The rearview mirror showed Ethan still standing under the streetlamp, his shadow stretching long behind him.

She stomped on the accelerator.

Finn was organizing gear in the living room when the door burst open. A whirlwind blew past him up the stairs.

"Master?" He stood frozen, half-wrapped bandage dangling from his fingers.

Cold water slapped against Vivian's face in the bathroom. Her reflection showed lips still swollen from that bastard's—

Knock. Knock. Knock.

"Master? Are you okay?"

She shut off the faucet sharply. Only then did she recall seeing Finn earlier.

The door swung open to reveal her apprentice's worried face.

"When did you get back?"

Finn blinked. "...Half an hour ago? I even greeted you."

Now she noticed the bandage on his arm. "You're hurt?"

"Just a scratch!" He straightened immediately. "The smuggling ring mission went perfectly—"

Vivian nodded absently, Ethan's "test that theory" echoing in her skull.

Test what? The kissing or... She shook her head violently.

Next time they met, she'd make sure that bastard learned the meaning of true suffering.
###Chapter 258

"Master, you're finally back!" Finn Deross bounded toward her like an excited puppy. "I sent you over a dozen messages this afternoon. You didn't reply to any of them."

Vivian Laurent hung her bag on the hallway hook. "My phone was on silent."

"I knew it!" Finn leaned closer, then blinked. "Huh? Master, why is your face so red?"

Vivian turned away. "It's hot."

"But it's winter." Finn tilted his head. "Unless...you had dinner with Ethan Roscente?"

Vivian's steps faltered.

"I had dinner with a dog," she blurted out.

Then she remembered Ryan Fairsprene had been present and added, "To be precise, one human and one dog."

Finn's eyes lit up. "So Ethan was there after all?"

Vivian: "..."

Since when had her apprentice become so sharp?

"Master, when did you get a dog?" Finn suddenly asked, head cocked. "You brought a pet to dinner with Ethan?"

Vivian couldn't resist knocking his forehead. "Are you brain-dead? Ethan is the dog!"

Finn rubbed his head. "How was I supposed to know that? But Master, why are you blushing just from having dinner with Ethan?"

Vivian headed upstairs. "Did you finish your assignments? Or are you just here to gossip?"

"All done!" Finn hurried after her. "But I need your advice on something."

He handed her a tablet with a conspiratorial air.

The screen displayed the latest Dark Web bounty: In three days, an exclusive high-stakes gambling event would take place on a luxury cruise in international waters. The ultimate prize was the Stella Maris Necklace.

The necklace featured 128 flawless diamonds and was rumored to have been passed down through European royalty for a century. Currently valued at over $100 million, it was considered priceless.

"I want it," Finn said with rare seriousness. "My mother's birthday is next month."

Vivian arched a brow. "You're taking this mission?"

"No. I'm going to gamble for it myself." His gaze hardened. "I want to win it for her with my own hands."

Waves lapped gently against the cruise ship as crystal chandeliers bathed the casino in daylight brilliance. Finn nervously adjusted his bowtie and glanced at Vivian. "Master, can we really win?"

Vivian smirked. "Getting cold feet?"

"Of course not!" He squared his shoulders. "I just..."

"Remember what I taught you." Vivian cut him off. "Tonight's opponents are seasoned gamblers, but everyone has a weakness."

Her eyes flickered toward Ethan Roscente, who was sipping wine nearby. Sensing her gaze, he raised his glass in salute.

Finn followed her line of sight and gaped. "Why is he here?"

Vivian looked away. "Seems tonight won't be peaceful."
###Chapter 259

The necklace shimmered under the lights as Vivian Laurent's fingertips grazed the cool metal.

"Decent taste," she remarked casually.

Finn Deross leaned closer. "Master, I really want this necklace."

He lowered his voice. "Rumor has it even the legendary gambler Winner will show up at this event."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Oh?"

Since when was she attending some gambling match?

Finn pressed on. "How about we wait for someone else to win it, then you can discreetly—"

"Enough." Vivian cut him off. "When Vivian Laurent takes something, she does it openly."

"So you mean..."

"Winning it fair and square, of course." A glint flashed in her eyes.

Finn sucked in a breath. "You're going to play yourself?"

Those casino veterans were all masters of deception. Wouldn't they just be throwing money away?

"Relax." Vivian smirked. "I could use some extra cash lately."

Finn opened his mouth but thought better of speaking.

Was his master truly capable or just...

"Forced plunder leaves a bitter taste." Vivian lectured. "If you want something, make them yield willingly."

Finn muttered under his breath. "But what if—"

"No what-ifs." Vivian's tone brooked no argument. "What Vivian Laurent wants, no one can take."

The computer screen suddenly flickered.

"Master!" Finn exclaimed. "The Dark Web contract's been accepted!"

They both stared at the "Accepted" notification, their expressions unreadable.
###Chapter 260

Vivian Laurent narrowed her eyes, a playful smile curling her lips.

"What if I accepted it?"

Her fingers tapped lightly on the table, excitement flashing in her gaze. It had been too long since she last played cards. The itch was unbearable.

Memories surfaced of her secret casino visits before the divorce. Those three years, she'd accomplished far more in the shadows than anyone realized.

Now she had Ethan Roscente dogging her every step.

She patted Finn Deross's shoulder. "Apprentice, your master has a gift for you."

Finn's eyes lit up. "Master's making a move?"

"That necklace—I'll win it back for you personally."

"About the invitation..."

"Leave it to me!" Finn thumped his chest confidently. "My uncle definitely has connections."

......

Top floor of Roscente Group.

Ethan Roscente was buried in paperwork, his aura forbidding any approach.

Simon Eisner knocked lightly on the door.

"Enter."

He set down newly delivered documents and presented a gilded invitation.

"Mr. Golden's luxury cruise gala."

Ethan scoffed. "Just an underground casino with a fancy name."

"They say it's quite grand..."

"We'll see."

As Simon retreated, the office door burst open.

Victor Roscente stormed in, face flushed with anger.

"Ethan Roscente! How much longer will you protect that woman?"

Ethan signaled Simon to close the door.

"To what do I owe this performance, Uncle?"

"Victoria won't eat or drink—locked in her room all day!" Victor slammed the desk. "Vivian Laurent must pay!"

Every man he'd sent to capture Vivian had been intercepted by Ethan's people.
###Chapter 261

Ethan Roscente tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, his tone calm. "You're right, Uncle. Those who commit evil should pay the price."

Victor Roscente slammed his hands on the table and stood abruptly. "Stop playing dumb! Hand over Vivian Laurent now!"

"Didn't I already give those thugs to you for punishment?" Ethan arched an eyebrow, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

"I took care of those scumbags long ago!" Victor spat through gritted teeth. "Victoria personally identified Vivian as the mastermind behind this scheme! How dare someone plot against a Roscente heiress—I won't let this slide!"

Greed flickered in Victor's eyes. Under Ethan's leadership, the Roscente Group had flourished while their branch of the family declined. Victoria's incident presented the perfect opportunity to seize power.

"How amusing, Uncle." Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "It was Victoria who hired those men to frame Vivian. Now you're blaming the victim?"

"Bullshit!" Victor trembled with rage. "Victoria would never do such a thing!"

Ethan adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "Victoria's arrogance and bullying behavior—weren't those nurtured by you, Uncle? If anyone's to blame, it's you."

"Ethan Roscente!" Victor roared. "Have you no respect for your elders?"

"What respect do you deserve?" Ethan's gaze turned icy. "For turning a blind eye to the truth? For distorting facts?"

Victor narrowed his eyes viciously. "If you refuse to hand over Vivian today, don't expect any family mercy from me!"

He took an aggressive step forward. "Unless... this was all your doing? You orchestrated Victoria's downfall to monopolize the Roscente empire!"

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet.

Now Ethan understood why Victoria was so malicious—it ran in the family.

"Uncle." Ethan enunciated each word clearly. "Victoria brought this upon herself. If you insist on causing trouble..."

He rose slowly, looking down at Victor with chilling dominance. "Then don't blame me for severing all ties."

"How dare you!" Victor screamed hysterically. "My innocent daughter was violated, and this is how you respond? You'll answer for this today!"

Ethan's eyes turned completely frosty.

It was clear now—this farce had been carefully orchestrated.
###Chapter 262

"What exactly do you want?" Ethan Roscente's icy gaze swept over Victor Roscente. "If Victoria feels wronged, she should file a police report."

Victor slammed his hands on the desk. "Police? Are you insane? This scandal would ruin our family's reputation!"

Ethan tapped his fingers lightly on the polished wood. "I'll say it again—Vivian had nothing to do with this. Instead of wasting my time, you should discipline your daughter properly."

"Ethan!" Victor trembled with rage. "What spell has that woman cast on you? Victoria is your own flesh and blood!"

The office air turned glacial.

Victor suddenly changed tactics. "Fine. I'll convince Victoria to drop the matter. But as her elder brother, you owe her compensation."

A mocking glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Compensation?"

"Make her a manager at Roscente Group. And give her ten percent of the shares." Victor rubbed his hands together. "She needs status in the company."

"Ten percent?" Ethan let out a cold laugh. "Your appetite never ceases to amaze me, Uncle."

Victor bristled. "Why hoard all those shares for outsiders? We've never challenged your position all these years!"

"Roscente Group was drowning in debt when Grandfather handed it to me." Ethan enunciated each word. "And now you dare demand shares?"

Victor's face darkened. "Those were preexisting liabilities!"

"The answer is no." Ethan pressed the intercom. "Simon, show our guest out."

The office door opened immediately.

"Mr. Roscente." Simon Eisner stood at the threshold, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Victor shot Ethan a venomous glare. "This isn't over!"

As he stormed out, new schemes already took shape in his mind.

The Roscente empire would be his—one way or another.
###Chapter 263

Victoria Roscente hadn't left her room for three days.

The untouched meals delivered by the maid remained outside her door, their lids still sealed.

The gaunt reflection in the mirror bore no resemblance to the proud Roscente heiress. Bloodshot eyes stared back from hollow sockets.

Memories of that night coiled around her like venomous serpents. Though she'd personally disposed of those men, the physical imprint refused to fade.

What shattered her completely was knowing every witness had seen her degradation.

She grabbed the sleeping pills from her vanity, pouring a handful into her palm. The image of Vivian Laurent's triumphant smile made her hurl them across the room.

Her phone rang abruptly.

Victoria answered mechanically. Sophia Evans' gentle voice came through. "Are you alright, Victoria?"

Her reply emerged as a ragged whisper. "Sophia..."

"Don't do anything reckless." Sophia sighed. "Vivian's waiting for you to self-destruct."

Each word pierced Victoria's heart like needles. Her fists clenched until nails drew blood from her palms.

"I want her dead." Victoria enunciated every syllable. "I'll watch her burn in hell."

A soft laugh echoed through the receiver. "There's the Victoria I know. Remember, that night was just you hiring male escorts."

Victoria recalled the drug-induced ecstasy with disturbing clarity.

"You took care of the aftermath?" Sophia's tone turned serious.

"Morning-after pill." Victoria grimaced in disgust. "My body isn't a dumping ground for trash."

"Good." Sophia's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "I have a plan. I need your cooperation."

Victoria's dull eyes ignited. "I'll do anything to destroy Vivian."

"Recover your strength first." Sophia's words carried hidden meaning. "The real show is just beginning."

After hanging up, Victoria yanked open the curtains. Sunlight stabbed her eyes, but she refused to blink.

Just you wait, Vivian Laurent.
###Chapter 264

Victoria Roscente and Sophia Evans were both scheming, each looking for an opportunity to deal with Vivian.

Victor Roscente sat in his car, fingers tapping lightly on the steering wheel.

He narrowed his eyes as an idea suddenly came to him.

"Ethan cares so much about that woman..."

He pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Uncle Victor."

Sophia's voice came through the receiver.

"You know Vivian Laurent, right?" Victor got straight to the point.

"Of course I know her!" Sophia's voice turned sharp immediately. "She stole Ethan from me! Now he won't even answer my calls!"

Victor cut her off impatiently. "Three years, Sophia. I cleared every obstacle for you, even got rid of Alexander Roscente. I even arranged for Theo to be your pawn."

"But Ethan's heart is made of stone!" Sophia defended herself tearfully. "I've tried everything..."

Victor let out a cold laugh.

"Was it you behind my daughter's incident?"

"It wasn't me!" Sophia denied hurriedly. "Victoria was the one who couldn't stand Vivian..."

"Remember this," Victor's voice turned dark. "I gave you everything you have now. I can take it all away just as easily."

Sophia immediately softened her tone. "I'll never forget your kindness, Uncle Victor."

After hanging up, Victor turned the steering wheel.

He decided to meet this Vivian Laurent personally.

At the hospital, Vivian was instructing Ryan Fairsprene during a consultation.

"Relax." She handed Ryan a glass of water. "Patients don't get sick according to textbooks. You need to learn to observe."

Ryan was so nervous he broke out in sweat.

Meanwhile, Ethan received a call from his bodyguard.

"Mr. Roscente, Victor is heading to the hospital."

Ethan stood up abruptly, grabbing his suit jacket as he rushed out.

His eyes were as cold as ice.
###Chapter 265
Victor Roscente's Scheme

Ryan Fairsprene took a deep breath and composed himself.

The next patient entered the room.

After a thorough examination, he carefully delivered his diagnosis.

His anxious gaze flickered toward Vivian Laurent.

Vivian remained expressionless.

"Accurate diagnosis," she finally said. "Write up the lab orders."

Ryan exhaled in relief and quickly filled out the forms.

The door burst open.

"Wendy Valentine?" Ryan checked the appointment list.

A timid young woman raised her hand.

Victor Roscente stood in the doorway, his stare locked on Vivian.

"Let's talk outside," Vivian said, rising.

In the hallway, Victor lowered his voice. "We'll discuss this at a café."

"Do I know you?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"I'm Victoria Roscente's father." Victor revealed his identity.

Vivian smirked. "Get to the point."

"You're involved in my daughter's situation." Victor's tone turned threatening. "Making a scene won't benefit you."

A sharp glint flashed in Vivian's eyes.

She knew Victor all too well.

Back in the Roscente family, he'd always been an opportunist.

"Fine." Vivian agreed readily.

At the hospital entrance, Victor pointed to a black sedan.

"I'll take you to a proper café."

Vivian glanced at the vehicle.

"There's one right here."

"People like us don't go just anywhere." Victor's voice dripped with arrogance.

Vivian followed without protest.

A sinister smile curled Victor's lips.

As they neared the car, four men in black suddenly rushed forward.

Vivian was prepared.

Steel glinted in the light.

A scalpel pressed against Victor's throat.

"Don't move." Her voice was ice.
###Chapter 266

The scalpel glinted coldly under the sunlight.

Victor Roscente felt a sudden chill against his neck as the sharp blade pressed against his jugular.

"Mr. Roscente, is this how you invite someone for coffee?" Vivian Laurent's voice was icy.

Victor froze.

He hadn't expected this seemingly delicate woman to move with such lethal precision.

"Don't move." Vivian's gaze swept over the surrounding bodyguards. "Unless you want your boss bleeding out."

The men hesitated, exchanging uncertain glances.

Victor forced composure. "Dr. Laurent, let's talk this through."

"Now you want to talk?" Her lips curled into a humorless smile. "Weren't you just trying to kidnap me?"

The blade pressed deeper.

A stinging pain flared as the skin broke.

"It's a misunderstanding," Victor insisted, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "I only wanted to discuss my daughter's situation."

Vivian's eyes hardened. "Victoria brought this upon herself. That's none of my concern."

"You—!" Victor trembled with rage.

"Call off your dogs first," she ordered.

Gritting his teeth, Victor waved his men back to the cars.

Only then did Vivian withdraw the scalpel.

"Next time you come for me," she wiped the blade casually, "it won't end so easily."

Clutching his neck, Victor shot her a venomous glare before storming off.

——

Inside the clinic, Ryan Fairsprene paced anxiously.

When Vivian entered, he rushed forward. "Are you alright?"

"Of course." Her expression remained unreadable.

She had just settled at her desk when the door burst open again.

"Vivian!" Ethan Roscente appeared, breathless.

Her eyebrow arched.

Were these two coordinating their visits?
###Chapter 267

Vivian Laurent was writing a prescription in her consultation room when Ethan Roscente appeared at the door.

She glanced up briefly before returning to her paperwork.

"Let's talk outside." She closed the medical chart without looking at him.

At the hallway corner, Vivian kept her hands in her lab coat pockets. "What is it?"

Ethan's gaze swept over her. "Did my uncle come to see you?"

"Yes." Her tone was flat.

"Did he do anything to you?" His brow furrowed slightly.

Vivian let out a soft laugh. "What, do I look that fragile to you?"

"He plays dirty." Ethan's voice darkened. "I don't trust him."

She shrugged. "Feeling better now?"

He studied her for a moment before asking abruptly, "Are you free tomorrow night?"

"No."

"What's the matter?"

She arched an eyebrow. "Since when do you keep tabs on my schedule?"

"Do you need help?" He pressed.

"Not necessary." Vivian turned to leave. "My patients are waiting."

Ethan caught her wrist. "Call me if anything happens."

She pulled her hand away and walked off without another word.

Ethan watched her disappear down the corridor, his expression turning icy.

He dialed Simon Eisner's number. "Pull up the hospital surveillance footage."

Thirty minutes later, Ethan stared at his phone screen, his eyes darkening as he watched Victor Roscente intercept Vivian.

"Keep my uncle occupied," he said coldly. "Make sure he has no time to cause trouble."

The next evening, Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the city lights.

Simon knocked and entered. "The gala on the luxury cruise starts at seven, Mr. Roscente."

Ethan suddenly remembered something and picked up the embossed invitation from his desk.

Tonight?

His eyes narrowed.

Was this what Vivian meant when she said she was "busy" yesterday?
###Chapter 268

Ethan Roscente stared at his phone screen, his brow furrowed. Vivian Laurent had mentioned having plans tonight—could she be attending that underground gambling event?

His long fingers tapped lightly against the desk before he suddenly picked up his phone and dialed Finn Deross.

"Hello?" Finn's voice was cautious on the other end.

"Free tonight? Let's grab dinner," Ethan said calmly.

"No!" Finn refused immediately. "I have something important tonight!"

"What's so important?" Ethan pressed without missing a beat.

"Just important!" Finn hung up in a hurry, as if afraid to say another word.

A faint smirk curled Ethan's lips. He picked up the gilded invitation on his desk, his gaze lingering on the mysterious cruise ship emblem.

"Simon, make arrangements," he called his assistant. "I'm going somewhere tonight."

The abandoned dock was swallowed by darkness, save for the dazzling lights of the luxury cruise ship.

Vivian wore a black baseball cap, her face half-hidden behind a mask. Finn handed her a silver fox mask, its intricate patterns gleaming coldly under the moonlight.

"Word is, a lot of high rollers are here tonight," Finn murmured.

Vivian chuckled. "Perfect for stretching my legs."

At the entrance, black-suited guards meticulously checked each invitation. Once aboard, the opulent casino came into view, its crystal chandeliers illuminating the grand hall like daylight.

"Did you hear? Winner is coming tonight," a man in an eagle mask whispered to his companion.

"The legendary gambler who vanished two years ago?" his companion gasped.

Vivian passed by them, the corner of her lips lifting beneath her mask.

"No one's ever seen his real face," the eagle-masked man muttered. "Some say he's a man. Others say she's a woman."

Finn couldn't help glancing at Vivian. Her sharp eyes were fixed on the flow of chips across the tables, calculating.

"The stakes tonight are rumored to be as high as a billion," someone nearby whispered excitedly.

Vivian twisted her wrist slightly, the diamond cufflink at her sleeve glinting. It was a custom micro-communicator, keeping her connected at all times.

In the VIP lounge above, Ethan stood before one-way glass, scanning the bustling crowd below for a familiar figure.

At the center of the casino, the dealer shuffled the cards. Vivian took her seat gracefully, the fox mask casting an enigmatic glow under the lights.

"Your bet, miss," the dealer prompted.

Vivian pushed forward a stack of chips, her red lips parting.

"All in."

The room erupted in murmurs.
###Chapter 269

A faint smile curved beneath Vivian Laurent's mask.

Finn Deross tugged anxiously at her sleeve.

"Master, did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"The news about Winner coming! He's definitely after the necklace. Our chances are slim. Maybe we should just steal it."

Vivian deliberately drawled, "So what if it's Winner? Is he better than me?"

Finn rubbed his forehead.

His master was skilled, but Winner was a living legend in gambling circles.

"Let me educate you, Master. James the Gambling Saint never lost once—until Winner crushed him. Winner has defeated every champion across continents without a single loss."

"Just listen to that name—Winner. So domineering! Master, we shouldn't provoke him."

He sighed.

"If we can't get the necklace, it's fine. I appreciate the thought."

Vivian flicked his forehead sharply.

"Underestimating me? Just wait and see what a real winner looks like."

The luxury cruise ship was already filling with guests.

To warm up the crowd, gambling tables opened early.

Vivian led Finn on a tour of the floating palace.

The first two decks housed the main event areas.

The third offered lounge spaces, while the fourth boasted a private cinema.

Card tables swarmed with mediocre players.

Vivian scanned them dismissively.

Finn trailed behind like a shadow.

"Don't look," Vivian turned his head away. "Bad influence for kids."

"I'm an adult!"

"One gamble and you're expelled."

"I swear I won't!"

After circling the ship, Vivian chose the perfect vantage point—the second-floor balcony overlooking the entire venue.

Guests continued boarding in waves.

Zero moved through the crowd wearing his mask.

Returning to Country C, he'd accepted a Dark Web contract—to steal the necklace.

Normally beneath his skillset.

But since his last visit, he'd sensed something hidden here.

This time he volunteered.

Though the mission seemed simple, an odd premonition stirred.

This voyage might yield unexpected discoveries.
###Chapter 270

Zero's first action upon boarding the cruise was to meticulously survey the ship's layout.

His silver mask glinted as he moved through the crowd.

He brushed past another masked figure—Vivian Laurent—without recognition.

Two steps later, Zero froze.

He whirled around, scanning the sea of faces.

A strange familiarity prickled at his senses.

"Master, there are more people than expected," Finn Deross whispered, close on Vivian's heels.

His voice held tension as he eyed each masked guest like a potential threat.

Vivian's gaze swept the room, her expression unreadable behind the mask.

A commotion erupted at the entrance.

Mr. Golden made his grand appearance, surrounded by admirers.

"Mr. Golden, tonight's grand prize is yours for the taking!"

The gambling king waved a dismissive hand. "With so many experts here, the outcome is unpredictable."

Finn leaned in, eagerly recounting Mr. Golden's rise to fame.

Vivian gave an approving nod at her disciple's thorough research.

Unlike the flashy gambler, Ethan Roscente boarded at the last possible moment.

He'd cycled through three suits before settling on the navy blue with subtle patterning.

His stylist had spent thirty perfecting every strand of hair.

Standing on the deck, Ethan's searching gaze failed to locate Vivian in the throng.

He headed straight for the second-floor observation deck—the vantage point superior.

The ship's horn blared as it departed the harbor.

The signal that tonight's high-stakes game had begun.

Guests exchanged cash for chips, the air thick with greed and ambition.

"Will you play, Master?" Finn murmured. "I brought five million—it's all yours."

A fortune elsewhere, but here? Mere pocket change.
###Chapter 271

"Why bring money?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"Not planning to play?" Finn looked puzzled.

"Of course I am."

She never backed down from a challenge. It had been ages since she'd indulged in this.

Finn's eyes widened. "How can you play without money? My five million might only last you one round."

"One round is enough." A faint smile played on Vivian's lips. "The rest will come from other people's pockets."

Finn fell silent.

His mentor's confidence was staggering. Every person here was a seasoned gambler.

"Confidence is good, Master. But knowing when to fold is crucial. Otherwise, the losses will be brutal."

"The word 'lose' doesn't exist in my vocabulary." Vivian chuckled. "Patience. Let a few rounds weed out the weak."

She needed to study each player's tells and techniques.

Soon, those relying on luck or running low on chips would be eliminated. Then the real masters would remain.

Vivian strolled through the casino. The high-roller tables were packed, especially around Mr. Golden, whose towering stack of chips reflected his hot streak.

Some left dejected. Others wept openly. A few bet everything—only to lose it all.

Gambling destroyed lives.

"Wasn't Winner supposed to show up? Where are they?" someone muttered.

"Let's bet on it! Male or female?"

"I say male! No woman could pull this off."

"I'll take female—probably a bombshell!"

Bets flew. Vivian massaged her temples. Revealing herself wasn't part of the plan.

Noticing higher odds on "male," she considered placing a wager herself.

Meanwhile, Ethan scanned the crowd for Vivian. Had he misread her? Was this not the "big event" she meant?

Just as disappointment set in, a voice cut through the chatter.

"Mr. Golden's on fire tonight. Care for a game?"

Heads turned. "And you are...?"

"You've been talking about me all night. Now you don't recognize me?"

Gasps erupted. Someone shrieked, "It's Winner!"
###Chapter 272

The crowd instinctively parted to form a pathway.

"It's me," the man declared without hesitation.

Finn Deross tugged excitedly at Vivian Laurent's sleeve. "Master, look! It's Winner! That aura—truly worthy of the Gambling God!"

Vivian remained silent.

If he was Winner, then what did that make her?

As for his so-called aura? She didn't see it.

Now she understood the rumors. Someone had been impersonating her, deliberately spreading false information.

The mask concealed the man's face. He wasn't anyone she recognized—certainly not Lucas Lefèvre.

She decided not to expose him yet. She wanted to see what this impostor was planning.

The moment "Winner" appeared, all eyes turned toward him.

He strode confidently toward Mr. Golden, exuding ease.

"Gambling God versus Gambling King—who are you betting on?"

"Is that even a question? How can a mere king compare to a god? Look, Mr. Golden's hands are shaking."

"First time seeing the Gambling God in person. Is he really as legendary as they say?"

"Of course. When he strikes, blood is spilled. He never leaves survivors."

Vivian watched coldly. The audacity of this fraudster, parading around under her name.

This was the downside of a secret identity. If she hadn't been here in person, she wouldn't have known someone was impersonating her.

"Mr. Golden, care for a game?" the man taunted.

But the Gambling King studied him intently. "Are you really Winner?"

"Naturally," the impostor boasted shamelessly.

Mr. Golden narrowed his eyes. "The Winner I met last time was a woman."

"Who said I'm a woman?" The man scoffed. "I occasionally appear in female guise. As for how I do it..." He paused meaningfully. "If you're scared, Mr. Golden, you can still back out now."

Vivian's brow furrowed. Not only was this man impersonating her, but he was also being outrageously arrogant.

She had always kept a low profile, never seeking unnecessary conflict. These reckless claims were tarnishing the name "Winner."

"Scared?" Mr. Golden sneered. "Perfect. I've been wanting a rematch."

The game began.

Mr. Golden, who had been on a winning streak, was visibly tense. Vivian observed the play closely—his hand was strong.

Yet the impostor seemed to see right through his cards, countering every move with precision.

The Gambling King grew increasingly cautious, while his opponent appeared effortlessly in control.
###Chapter 273

The poker table overflowed with chips, each gleaming under the lights. The crowd held their breath as the stakes reached an astronomical sum.

Finn Deross leaned close to Vivian Laurent's ear. "Master, who do you think will win?"

Vivian's gaze remained fixed on the table. "Wait and see."

Most bets were placed on the man calling himself Winner. Beads of sweat glistened on Mr. Golden's forehead under the harsh lighting.

The casino king deliberated over every card, while his opponent played with lightning speed.

Vivian's frown deepened. The unnatural pace suggested he could see his opponent's hand. More suspiciously, he kept shielding his own cards.

"Showdown!"

The dealer's announcement sealed Mr. Golden's defeat again.

The impostor Winner chuckled while stacking his chips. "Better luck next time, Mr. Golden. Though by now, you should be used to losing to me."

The taunt turned the casino king's face ashen.

"Winner! Don't push your luck!"

"Push my luck?" The impostor laughed. "Then prove me wrong. Or step aside—tonight's victory belongs to me!"

"Again!" Mr. Golden slammed the table.

The next round ended identically. The impostor's chip pile towered like a miniature mountain.

Finn gasped. "His prediction skills are terrifying. It's like he can see the future!"

Cheers erupted as bettors calculated their winnings.

Vivian suddenly gripped Finn's shoulder. "He's cheating."

"What?" Finn's eyes widened. "Impossible. Not with everyone watching..."

The cruise's gambling rule was absolute—cheaters would be thrown overboard.

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "That impostor."

"Impostor?" Finn was baffled. Mr. Golden's identity was undeniable. Who else could defeat the casino king repeatedly but the legendary gambler Winner?

Behind her mask, Vivian smirked. She'd already deciphered his trick.
###Chapter 274

"Cheating?" Finn Deross looked utterly confused. "I didn't notice anything."

He had been staring at the gambling table without blinking the entire time.

"Look at the people behind the gambler," Vivian Laurent whispered.

Finn followed her gaze. "There's quite a crowd."

According to the rules, spectators could only watch silently.

"The tall man at three o'clock," Vivian narrowed her eyes. "He's got a pinhole camera hidden in his collar button."

She pointed at the Impostor Winner. "And he's wearing a micro earpiece concealed under his hair. You'd never spot it unless you looked closely."

"The footage gets transmitted to someone who tells him the gambler's cards," Vivian said coldly. "That's how he always knows what's coming."

Finn's eyes widened. "And his card tricks! He moves faster than a magician. No normal person could catch it."

"Professional training," Vivian added.

Finn looked devastated. "The legendary Winner cheats? My whole world is shattered!"

Whack! Vivian smacked the back of his head.

"I said he's fake!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "The real Winner never cheats. His skills are genuine."

Rubbing his head, Finn asked, "You defend him so fiercely. Do you know him?"

"None of your business," Vivian turned away.

Finn persisted. "But they check everyone boarding the ship. How'd they smuggle this equipment onboard?"

Vivian rolled her eyes.

"Did I say something wrong?" Finn looked genuinely puzzled.

"The gear could've been hidden on the ship beforehand," Vivian explained patiently. "Or retrieved from the ocean."

"No one knew he was 'Winner' before he appeared," she said with a cold smile. "By the time he showed up, everything was already in place."

Finn gasped in realization. "That's just..."

He swallowed hard. "They'd get thrown overboard if caught. What's the point?"

"This isn't a one-man operation," Vivian's gaze turned sharp. "It's an entire crew scamming people under Winner's name."

"Between the huge jackpot and that Stella Maris Necklace, it's worth the risk," she frowned. "And tonight, I suspect they're not the only ones after those prizes."
###Chapter 275

Finn's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists.

"How despicable. Should we report them?"

His gaze locked onto the silver-masked man across the table, who was leisurely stacking his chips.

"Where's the proof?" Vivian chuckled. "Those micro cameras are smaller than rice grains. They can be disposed of in an instant."

The gambling king's pile of chips had dwindled to nothing.

The room fell deathly silent.

Every spectator held their breath as the gambling king removed his golden mask. His usually confident face now bore the look of utter defeat.

"As expected of the legendary Winner..."

"Mr. Golden has met his match this time..."

Whispers rippled through the crowd. The impostor Winner lounged back in his chair, tapping the table with idle fingers.

"Any other challengers?"

Arrogance dripped from his voice.

The crowd instinctively took half a step back.

"If there's no one—"

"I'll play."

A cool female voice cut through the silence.

All heads turned. A woman in a black lace mask glided forward, the hem of her gown swaying with each step.

Finn sucked in a sharp breath.

"Master!"

He reached for Vivian's sleeve but grasped only air.

Up on the second-floor balcony, Ethan's wineglass tilted abruptly. Crimson liquid splashed onto his pristine white cuff, yet he didn't even notice.

"It's her..."

His eyes burned into that familiar silhouette.

Zero stood in the shadows, the corner of his mouth curling beneath his mask.

At the table, the impostor Winner narrowed his eyes.

"You're certain you want to play, miss?"

Vivian took the seat across from him without hesitation. Her slender fingers traced the edge of a playing card.

"What's wrong? Scared?"

Her whisper ignited the entire casino.
###Chapter 276

Ethan Roscente's heart leaped into his throat.

Did Vivian Laurent actually know how to play poker?

That was the legendary Winner she was facing.

How could she be so confident?

The casino buzzed with excitement. Countless eyes were glued to the high-stakes match.

Ethan's palms grew damp with sweat.

Vivian had surprised him many times before.

But this was different.

Her opponent was the undisputed king of gambling.

Was she trying to win quick cash because her real estate company was struggling?

Ethan suddenly remembered Triple Six Realty's recent financial troubles.

He made a silent vow.

If she needed money, he would give it to her without hesitation.

What was his was hers.

The thought propelled him down the stairs.

Zero remained by the second-floor railing, his gaze locked on Vivian.

That overwhelming sense of familiarity made his pulse race.

Could it really be her?

Whispers filled the casino.

"Give it up, girl. Even the runner-up lost."

"You're just throwing money away."

"Better donate it to charity."

Vivian's lips curled.

"How do you know before we start?"

"My horoscope said today's my lucky day."

Mocking laughter erupted.

"You? Not even Winner could help you win now!"

The impostor shot her a disdainful look.

"Don't cry when you lose."

"Winner doesn't bully women."

Vivian's eyes turned icy.

"Winner isn't as shameless as you."

The impostor stiffened.

Had she seen through him?

Impossible.

Just as he opened his mouth, a deep voice cut him off.

"Wait."

All heads turned.

A tall, masked man in an impeccably tailored suit strode forward. His commanding presence silenced the room.

He stopped before Vivian.

"Play with me instead."

"I'll let you win."

Vivian instantly recognized Ethan Roscente.

Her jaw tightened.

What was he trying to ruin this time?
###Chapter 277

"Don't touch me." Vivian Laurent shook off Ethan Roscente's hand.

He gripped her wrist again. "This isn't a place for you to play."

"None of your business." She glared at him.

"You can't win against them," Ethan warned in a low voice.

Vivian smirked. "How would you know without trying?"

Whispers spread through the crowd as people speculated about their relationship.

Finn Deross hid behind the spectators, eyes wide with shock. What was Ethan doing at a casino?

The impostor Winner impatiently rapped the table. "Are we playing or not?"

"Yes!"

"No!"

Their simultaneous responses crackled with tension.

"You're overstepping," Vivian snapped, pulling her hand free. "I'm not using your money."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Suit yourself. I'll cover your losses."

"Keep your pity." She eyed him warily. "Don't expect a cut if I win."

The corner of his mouth lifted. Still as stubborn as ever.

Vivian strode to the table and sat across from the impostor.

"Your bet?" the fake Winner asked.

She pushed forward her chips. "This is all I've got."

The room erupted in laughter.

"Five million? That's it?"

"Are you begging for scraps?"

The impostor sneered. "Are you joking, little girl?"

"Scared?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

He scoffed. "Fine. Even small fish count."

Finn fidgeted anxiously. His mentor knew this cheat was using marked cards—why was she playing along?

He'd expected her to expose the fraud immediately.

Ethan noticed Finn's agitation. "Problem?"

"That guy's cheating," Finn whispered urgently. "Mentor told me he's a fake!"

Ethan's gaze sharpened. "You're certain?"

"She said it herself!" Finn wiped his sweaty palms. "Should we call him out?"

Ethan glanced at the table where Vivian calmly stacked her chips.

A slow smile spread across his face. "Let's enjoy the show."
###Chapter 278

Ethan Roscente's lips curved slightly. "No need to say more. Let's wait and see."

"But what if Master loses?" Finn Deross asked anxiously.

Ethan's gaze remained steady. "She won't."

"Why are you so certain?" Finn frowned.

Ethan's eyes locked onto the slender figure at the poker table. That delicate frame held astonishing power.

He believed in Vivian Laurent. Her ability to detect cheating proved she was an expert at this game.

Her absolute certainty about the impostor meant only one thing—she was the real Winner.

Because she was the genuine article, she could instantly spot any fraud.

The rules were simple. First player to discard all seventeen cards won. Seemingly luck-based, yet full of hidden complexities.

The dealer began distributing cards. The match commenced.

Vivian sat with her back to the crowd. She didn't even glance at her own hand, playing purely by instinct.

She casually drew a card and flicked it onto the table.

Her opponent sneered. What could a woman possibly do against him?

He slammed down an eight-card plane combination, leaving only nine in his hand.

Every card meant life or death.

When Vivian's turn came, she simply shook her head.

The man smirked triumphantly. He'd already stacked the deck to ensure Vivian had no playable cards.

Another straight left him with just four cards remaining.

"It's over," spectators whispered. "The Gambling King still has his royal flush. This girl can't even make a single move."

"So reckless to challenge in this arena."

"Does she even know how to play? Leaving everything to chance?"

Everyone assumed Vivian's defeat was inevitable.

The casino staff announced at the perfect moment: "Place your bets! Final call!"
###Chapter 279

"Is there even a choice? Winner will obviously win!" someone shouted. "That woman only has five million in chips. That's not even pocket change. But hey, easy money—I'm betting on Winner!"

The gambling table presented a stark contrast. The imposter Winner's side was piled high with chips, while Vivian Laurent's side stood nearly empty.

Finn Deross rubbed his hands anxiously. He wanted to support his mentor, but his pockets were emptier than his face. Those five million chips were his entire fortune.

Clack! A stack of chips suddenly landed in front of Vivian.

Ethan Roscente stood with one hand in his pocket, his voice icy. "I'm betting on her."

The crowd erupted. A full hundred million in chips glittered under the lights.

"Is this guy insane?" "Who cares? Quick, bet on Winner! We can split that hundred million!" The crowd surged like a tide, chips flooding toward the imposter's side.

Vivian glanced at Ethan through her mask. This man had tried to stop her earlier, and now he was causing trouble. Throwing down a hundred million like it was nothing—what was his game?

The contrast grew more extreme. The imposter's side now resembled a small mountain with over a billion in chips. Vivian's side held only Ethan's lonely stack.

The game continued. The imposter had just played a straight. Now it was Vivian's turn.

She calmly arranged her cards, a faint smile hidden beneath her mask. The hand was perfect—no need for any tricks.

"Four twos." Vivian slammed down the bombs.

Beads of sweat formed on the imposter's forehead. He only held three cards left: the joker bomb and a single card. If he used the jokers now, he'd be at a disadvantage.

He stole a glance at Vivian, searching for any tells. But the mask revealed nothing except those terrifyingly calm eyes.

"Joker bomb!" The imposter threw down his trump cards through gritted teeth.

Vivian spread her hands, signaling she couldn't top it. The imposter followed with a King, leaving just one final card in his hand.

The room held its breath. The outcome seemed decided.
###Chapter 280

The gambling table was surrounded by spectators, all eyes fixed on Vivian Laurent's slender fingers.

"Winner only has one card left. This round is in the bag."

"That girl could have a full hand and still not play them all at once."

"Always bet on Winner!"

The impostor's side of the table was piled high with chips like a small mountain. In contrast, only Ethan Roscente's hundred-million chip sat lonely in front of Vivian.

Her fingertip tapped lightly before flicking out an Ace.

The impostor's expression faltered, forcing him to fold. He forced a smirk, feigning composure. "Just letting you have this one. You can still walk away with dignity if you quit now."

Vivian lifted her gaze, her eyes calm as still water. "Making such bold claims now? Wouldn’t it be embarrassing when you lose?"

"Me? Lose?" The impostor laughed as if hearing the world’s greatest joke. "I have one card left. How exactly do you plan to win?"

"What if I can play my entire hand at once?" Vivian countered.

The impostor scoffed. "If you pull that off, I’ll retire from gambling for good!"

The crowd erupted in laughter.

"Winner just made an oath!"

"Stick with Winner—this round is guaranteed!"

A faint smile touched Vivian’s lips. "Then watch closely."

Her fingers moved like flowing water as cards fell one after another: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

A straight.

The casino fell dead silent.

Then came the 9, 10, Jack, Queen.

Someone gasped.

Vivian’s movements were effortless. When the King landed, only two cards remained in her hand.

Every heartbeat in the room skipped.

The final Ace fluttered onto the table.

Beads of sweat formed on the impostor’s forehead.

"Still up for another round?" Vivian twirled her last card between her fingers, her tone light.

The impostor’s throat bobbed. "The bet was you playing your entire hand at once! You still have one left—that doesn’t count!"
###Chapter 281

The imposter gambler's fingers trembled slightly on the poker table.

Vivian Laurent flicked her wrist, sending the final card gliding onto the felt.

A three of spades.

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

"Three to ace. Straight." Her voice rang clear like ice cubes clinking.

The color drained from the gambler's face beneath his mask.

He stared at that three as if it were a venomous snake poised to strike.

"Beg me," Vivian suddenly smiled. "Beg me to let you off this round."

Her tone was leisurely, yet each word stabbed like a knife.

The crowd began murmuring.

"The Gambling King begging a girl for mercy?"

"If this gets out..."

The gambler's knuckles turned white.

He realized too late—this seemingly harmless girl was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

"I... beg you." The words were ground out between clenched teeth.

Vivian's lips curved in satisfaction.

She retrieved the three with deliberate slowness. "Since the Gambling King asked so nicely—"

Before she finished, four cards snapped onto the table. "Four to ace. You can't beat that."

Then the three of spades fluttered down. "Final card."

The room erupted.

The gambler shot up, his chair screeching across the floor.

"You cheated!"

Vivian blinked innocently. "I said I wouldn't play this three. Never said I wouldn't win."

From the shadows, Ethan Roscente chuckled softly.

He'd anticipated this outcome all along.

The gambler staggered back two steps, his masked face contorted.

Over a billion in chips were being pushed toward Vivian by the dealer.

"One more round!" the gambler suddenly roared.

Vivian shook her head gently. "Sorry. I don't entertain losers."

As she rose, her skirt swirled in an elegant arc.

The gambler ripped off his mask. "Do you know who I am?"

Vivian turned back, disdain flashing in her eyes. "Just another fraud."

The room exploded.

"That's the Gambling Prince's disciple!"

"My God, we've been duped!"

Ethan materialized beside Vivian, offering a champagne flute.

"Enjoying yourself?" he murmured.

She took a sip, mischief glinting in her gaze. "This is only the beginning."
###Chapter 282

Whispers rippled through the casino.

"The legendary Winner actually lost?"

"Who is that woman?"

"Can fortune-telling really be this accurate? Do me next."

"Are they in cahoots?"

Vivian Laurent smirked. "I won fair and square. Show me proof if you have any."

She hadn't cheated this round.

Her luck had surprised even herself.

Even if she had cheated, no one would've noticed.

She turned to the impostor. "Good game."

"Don't flaunt what you don't have. If becoming Winner is so easy, maybe I should take the title."

Her crisp voice echoed through the hall.

Though her face remained hidden, everyone could tell she was young.

Brazen enough to challenge Winner openly.

The impostor's face darkened. "Again!"

"Just a lucky streak. You won't win twice!" His tantrum made him look like a clown.

Losing to a woman was unacceptable.

Luck couldn't last forever.

Vivian remained unruffled. "By all means. I'm looking forward to it."

The second round began swiftly.

She pushed all her chips forward.

Players hesitated—some followed her lead, others stuck with the impostor.

The impostor panicked after his first loss.

Another defeat would cost him his reputation.

He had to cheat now.

Vivian exchanged a glance with Ethan Roscente.

Understanding immediately, Ethan raised his phone as if browsing, secretly recording.

Vivian played calmly as the game progressed.

When he played pairs, she matched.

When he went for straights, she countered.

The impostor dismantled his own hand trying to block her.

Vivian discarded weak cards early, setting up her endgame.

The impostor was already unraveling.

Her final move—two triples with a single—sealed her victory.

Both had cheated this round.

But Vivian's sleight of hand was undetectable.

She'd mastered these tricks before this impostor even learned to shuffle.

Against rule-breakers, she played dirty too.

Her chip tower grew taller.

Sweat beaded on the impostor's forehead.

Two consecutive wins earned Vivian newfound respect.

Winner's performance, however, was disappointing.
###Chapter 283

"Is this so-called Gambling King just a fraud? Can't even beat a young girl."

"Who exactly is she?"

Vivian Laurent leaned back lazily in her chair, fingertips tapping the table. "Ever heard of Buddha? No matter how powerful the Monkey King was, he couldn't escape my palm."

The crowd gasped.

Such arrogance deserved a punch.

More people placed bets on Vivian in the next round.

Sweat beaded on the Gambling King's forehead. "Dare to switch to Showhand?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Your choice. I'll play till the end."

Showhand rules were simple.

Each player got one hidden card revealed last. From the second card onward, the higher hand bet first. After all decisions, the final cards determined the winner.

The cards were dealt swiftly.

The Gambling King had secretly swapped his cards. He revealed them slowly—a straight.

"Locked in!" He gloated inwardly.

The spectators erupted.

"A straight! How can anyone beat that?"

"Damn it! I bet everything on that girl!"

"If she loses, I'll kill her!" Someone roared with bloodshot eyes.

Vivian remained calm.

"Patience. Let him enjoy his moment." She tapped her cards lightly. "I don't want him crying too hard later."

The Gambling King sneered. "Bluffing!"

"Since you're eager to lose..." Vivian flipped her first card abruptly. "Let me oblige."

Five.

Seven.

Four.

Each reveal stirred the crowd.

"Highest is seven? She's done for!"

"I'll close my eyes and pray for a miracle!" Someone covered their face in despair.

Mocking laughter filled the air.

The Gambling King's lips curled in triumph.
###Chapter 284

Cold sweat dripped from the impostor Winner's palms.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he stared at Vivian's royal flush.

"This can't be..." he muttered under his breath.

The crowd erupted in deafening cheers.

"She won! An actual royal flush!"

"Unbelievable luck!"

The impostor's face turned ghostly pale.

His eyes met Vivian's amused gaze.

Those piercing eyes seemed to see right through him.

"Again," he growled through clenched teeth. "This time we play Pai Gow."

Vivian gave a slight nod.

"Your choice."

What followed was a nightmare.

The impostor's chips dwindled at an alarming rate.

Veins bulged on his forehead.

"Impossible..." he whispered. "I clearly..."

Vivian suddenly raised her hand.

"Enough."

Her quiet voice silenced the entire casino.

"Isn't that earpiece bothering you?"

The impostor froze.

"And the marked cards in your sleeve," Vivian continued calmly. She turned toward the crowd. "That gentleman in gray - your button camera needs upgrading."

Gasps filled the room.

"Cheating?"

"I thought he was Winner!"

The impostor leapt to his feet.

"Lies!"

He lunged at Vivian with a snarl.

She sidestepped effortlessly.

"The real Winner would never resort to such cheap tricks."

Her words struck like a hammer.

The impostor staggered backward.

The crowd began murmuring.

"A fraud!"

"No wonder he kept winning..."

Panic flashed in the impostor's eyes.

Everywhere he looked, people stared at him with contempt.

"I..."

His voice failed him.

Vivian stepped closer.

"Now. Let's settle our accounts."
###Chapter 285

"So he was cheating those rounds too?"

"You saw through his tricks all along, didn't you? Winning against a cheater—I'm more curious about who you really are."

"That was incredible. Never seen such an exhilarating game."

The girl's performance was nothing short of stunning. She'd not only won multiple rounds against a cheating opponent but also exposed his methods on the spot. The crowd loved every second of it, their gazes filled with admiration.

The exposed impostor bristled like a cornered cat. "Lies! If I'm not Winner, then who is? You? Just because you won a few hands, you think you can deny my identity?"

Feeling the weight of skeptical stares, he grew increasingly flustered and decided to turn the tables. "Your cards are the problem! You're the one cheating!"

He whirled toward the onlookers, his voice hoarse with desperation. "Look closely, everyone! This woman is the fraud. My skills are legitimate—that's why she won. She rigged the game and now points fingers at me!"

His shouts grew louder, veins bulging at his temples, every inch of him radiating guilt.

Vivian Laurent scoffed. "No need to yell. We can all hear you. If you're innocent, why panic?"

"How would you feel if you were framed?" the impostor snapped, his neck stiff with defiance. But his right hand subtly inched toward his earlobe, attempting to remove the hidden micro earpiece.

Vivian had anticipated this. She seized his wrist and slammed it onto the table. The tiny device clattered onto the surface, its metallic ping ringing through the silence.

Irrefutable proof.

She exchanged a glance with Ethan Roscente, who handed her his phone. She pulled up a recording. "The entire thing's here. Everyone can see his techniques for themselves."

The impostor thrashed wildly, but Vivian held him down effortlessly. "This is a setup!" he shrieked. "You rigged this! You're the cheater, and you're the one denying I'm the Gambling King! What's your game? Don't let her fool you!"

"My goal is simple," Vivian said coldly. "I can't stand frauds tarnishing Winner's name. The real Winner would never disgrace himself like you."

If this impostor hadn't crossed her path, she wouldn't have bothered exposing him.

"As for your accusation that I cheated—show me proof. If you have any, I'll cooperate fully." She released him, looking down with icy disdain. "Right now, you should worry about clearing your own name."

"You—" The impostor paled, trembling like a leaf.

His eyes suddenly widened. "How could you spot my tricks so easily? Unless... you're the real—"
###Chapter 286

The host of the banquet arrived swiftly with security personnel, restraining the impostor.

"I will thoroughly investigate his identity," the host announced, scanning the crowd. "Tonight's incident will be properly addressed."

As the impostor was dragged away, he screamed hysterically, "I admit to cheating! But Winner always wins by cheating! You've all been fooled!"

Vivian Laurent watched the desperate clown with cold indifference.

"You're Winner?" She smirked disdainfully. "Then who am I? Can there possibly be two Winners in the gambling world?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Countless skeptical eyes turned toward Vivian. "You're Winner?"

"The one and only." She sat down gracefully. "I welcome any challenger. No tricks—pure skill."

She had used some tactics against the impostor earlier, but now she would win with integrity.

"My God! The legendary gambler is a woman!"

"Is this real? Another fraud?"

"Are you blind? Didn't you see her technique just now?"

"Oh no... I bet on the fake one earlier. Will Winner hold a grudge?"

Ethan Roscente's lips curved slightly, unsurprised by the outcome.

Finn Deross, however, was stunned beyond belief.

His... master was Winner?

He pinched himself hard. Impossible! She had never mentioned gambling skills before!

No wonder she exposed the impostor. No wonder she was so confident about retrieving the necklace.

He had struck gold!

In the VIP booth upstairs, Zero stared intently at Vivian.

No mistake—she was Shadow.

Only Shadow could move like that. Those flawless missions could only be completed by Shadow.

She was alive!

What had happened these past four years? Why had she disappeared? The organization had been searching for her, and he had never given up.

Zero suppressed the urge to rush down. Shadow had two men with her now. He couldn't act recklessly.

He would wait for her to reveal her identity herself.

At the gambling table, Vivian shuffled the cards with elegance.

"I challenge you!" A man stepped forward boldly.

The crowd held their breath. Some even raised their phones to record.

Vivian's fingers danced, the cards flowing like water.

Without suspense, she won.

One challenger after another stepped up, only to be defeated.

Vivian maintained a perfect winning streak.
###Chapter 287

Mr. Golden adjusted his cuffs, preparing to return to the table.

His friend grabbed his arm. "Are you insane? Didn't you lose enough just now?"

Mr. Golden shook him off. "It's an honor to face the legendary Winner."

"You're out of your mind!" His friend stomped in frustration. "That's real money you're throwing away!"

Slipping on his gloves, Mr. Golden's gaze hardened. "Money means nothing. A chance to challenge Winner is priceless."

He strode to the table and took the seat opposite Vivian.

Behind her mask, Vivian's lips curved. "Long time no see, Mr. Golden."

"Winner," he exhaled deeply. "I look forward to learning from you."

The game began.

Vivian's fingers glided over the cards with effortless grace. She didn't need tricks—her psychological mastery predicted every move.

Beads of sweat formed on Mr. Golden's forehead.

"I concede." After three rounds, he dropped his cards in defeat.

Vivian smiled. "Your generosity."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Even the King of Gamblers had fallen. No one dared challenge the mysterious Winner now.

The priceless diamond necklace finally rested in Vivian's hands. Its brilliance reflected off her mask, shimmering like stars.

The impostors were exposed. They'd hoped to profit by impersonating Winner, only to flee in disgrace when facing the real deal.

"Your cut." Vivian slid a stack of chips toward Ethan.

He shook his head. "I told you—I don't want it."

"Take it." Her voice was light. "We made a fortune tonight. Everyone gets a share."

Her masked laughter danced between them.

Ethan could almost see the mischievous glint in her eyes—like a fox who'd stolen the cream.

His throat tightened as he resisted the urge to rip off that mask.

Tonight, Vivian remained the ultimate victor.

She hadn't just claimed the jackpot. She'd cemented Winner's legend across the casino once more.
###Chapter 288

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent, ignoring the chips on the table. "Being so generous, Vivian. Are you trying to keep me?"

She wrinkled her nose in distaste. "If I wanted a sugar baby, I'd pick a young hunk. Not some dried-up old man like you."

"Old man?" Ethan arched a brow. "You haven't even tasted me. How do you know I'm not good?"

"Last time—" Vivian bit back her words. "Anyway, I only like them young."

Ethan mentally calculated his age. Twenty-eight hardly qualified as old.

"What's so great about youth?" He glanced meaningfully across the room. "Kids like Finn Deross only care about having fun."

Vivian shrugged. "At least they have energy. Unlike someone who always looks like he's sucking on a lemon."

Ethan moved closer. "So you prefer younger men?"

"None of your business." She turned toward the stairs, eager to escape the curious stares.

He matched her stride. "When did you learn to gamble? I never knew you were this good."

"There's a lot you don't know about me." She quickened her pace.

"Like..." Ethan suddenly blocked her path. "You're Queen, aren't you?"

Vivian's pulse jumped. Was this alias about to be exposed too?

"Queen who?" She feigned ignorance.

"The hacker Queen." His tone left no room for doubt. "Stop pretending. It's you."

She threw up her hands dramatically. "In your eyes, I'm that capable? Why not call me the world's richest woman while you're at it?"

"Maybe you are." Ethan chuckled.

"Then go find your Queen. Stop bothering me." She tried to walk away.

His voice dropped to a murmur. "Do I smell jealousy? Are you getting possessive?"

Vivian's eyes widened. How could she be jealous of herself?

"Ex-husband, you're free to chase anyone you want now."

"What if I want to chase you?" His gaze turned unexpectedly serious.

Her heart skipped a beat. What did he mean by that?

"A smart woman doesn't revisit old mistakes," she said stiffly.

Ethan smiled. "Good thing neither of us is particularly smart."
###Chapter 289

Vivian abruptly stopped and turned to face him. "What do you want?"

The masks hid their expressions, but not the tension thickening the air.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

There was so much he wanted to say.

He wanted to tell her that divorcing her was the biggest regret of his life.

"Vivian, can you just—"

Can you give me another chance? He wanted to start over, to truly know the woman he'd once overlooked.

The sound of hurried footsteps cut him off. "Look! Winner is over there!"

Vivian had just cashed out her chips, thinking she'd escaped the frenzy of her fans.

"Move," she hissed under her breath.

If this crowd caught her, her mask would be ripped off in seconds.

No one knew Winner's true identity.

One day she appeared as a woman, the next as a man.

The mystery drove gamblers wild with curiosity.

"Don't let Winner get away!"

They were surrounded.

Panicked, Vivian shoved open a random door.

Ethan followed close behind.

"I saw her go in here!"

"She has to be inside!"

The voices outside grew louder.

Vivian's palms grew damp with sweat.

There was no time to change disguises now.

Ethan scanned the room, then grabbed her wrist. "Here."

Inside the cramped wardrobe, their bodies pressed together.

She could feel the heat radiating from his chest.

"Why did you follow me?" she whispered sharply.

His hand burned against her waist.

She shifted uncomfortably.

"Don't move," Ethan rasped.

"The bathroom had more space," Vivian bit out.

This position was too intimate, stealing the breath from her lungs.
###Chapter 290

Vivian Laurent whispered urgently, "Get out of here. Distract them."

The cramped closet made breathing difficult. Ethan Roscente's presence intensified the suffocating atmosphere. She could hear her own heart pounding like war drums.

"Leave now?" His deep voice vibrated against her ear. "That's practically announcing your hiding spot."

His chest pressed firmly against her back. The heat radiating through their clothes made her skin burn. She blamed the stuffy air.

Ethan suddenly removed his mask.

In the dim light, his sharp profile stood out. The tall bridge of his nose cast shadows. His thin lips pressed together. Those penetrating eyes stared straight into her soul.

Vivian quickly looked away. Thank god her mask still covered her face. Otherwise, he'd see her flaming cheeks.

"Go!" She pushed against his chest. "You're the one who'll give us away!"

He didn't budge. His long fingers hooked around her mask's ties. His other hand captured hers against his chest.

"The closet's tiny." His voice turned gravelly. "Where exactly should I hide?"

Footsteps sounded outside.

"Strange. I swore the Gambling King entered this room."

"Bathroom's clear!"

Vivian held her breath. Someone approached the closet. Her fingers instinctively clutched Ethan's shirt.

"Search thoroughly. We must unmask the Gambling King tonight!"

Every muscle in her body tensed. She unconsciously leaned closer into Ethan's embrace, oblivious to how little space remained between them.

Her delicate fragrance enveloped him. That familiar scent made his Adam's apple bob. The last thread of his restraint snapped.

He yanked off her mask. One hand anchored at her lower back. Then his lips crashed down on hers.
###Chapter 291

"Ethan Roscente, have you lost your mind?" Vivian Laurent's pupils constricted sharply. The warmth of his lips against hers left her frozen in shock.

Outside the dressing room, hurried footsteps echoed. She could even hear people discussing Winner. Vivian held her breath, terrified of drawing attention.

But the man only deepened the kiss, his scorching breath fanning her face. "Be good. Close your eyes."

Her fingers trembled with rage, yet she dared not struggle too violently. Glaring at his handsome face mere inches away, she wished she could bite off his tongue.

The cramped wardrobe grew stifling. Ethan's body burned like a furnace. One hand cradled the back of her head while the other locked around her waist.

Suddenly, Vivian remembered that intoxicating night—the same dominating presence that had made her knees weak then was reducing her to jelly now.

"Mmm..." An involuntary whimper escaped her lips, her eyes turning slightly red.

Ethan's breath hitched, his Adam's apple bobbing. If not for their inappropriate location, he would've taken her right then.

"Sounds like they're heading down the hallway," came muffled voices fading into the distance.

Vivian shoved him away and stumbled out. Wiping her swollen lips, she hissed, "Try that again and I'll neuter you."

"I only kissed you." Ethan leisurely adjusted his tie. "Should I file a request next time?"

"Go find your precious Sophia Evans!" Vivian sneered. "Who wants a secondhand man rejected by his ex?"

Darkness flashed in his eyes. "Jealous?"

"Hardly. My vision's been corrected." She smoothed her disheveled hair. "Turns out I was blind before."

In a flash, he pinned her against the vanity. "Then see clearly now."

Vivian turned her face away. The mirror reflected her flushed ears and Ethan's predatory gaze.
###Chapter 292

Vivian Laurent turned to leave.

Ethan Roscente grabbed her wrist. "The place is swarming with people. You'll be recognized if you go out like this."

He signaled Finn Deross to fetch clothes. "There's a spare set in my lounge. Change before you leave."

Vivian arched a brow. "Which lover did you prepare these for, Mr. Roscente?"

"Just for you." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Given your penchant for trouble, I knew they'd come in handy."

With a soft huff, Vivian called Finn anyway.

Finn arrived promptly with the clothes. When Vivian emerged after changing, the tips of her ears were flushed pink.

"Master, your face is so red," Finn observed curiously.

"It's hot in here." She shot him a glare.

Ethan chuckled, earning himself a sharp look from Vivian. "What's so funny? Move."

As the trio exited the casino, the crowd was still searching for the mysterious Winner. No one noticed the casually dressed girl was the legendary gambler from moments ago.

Vivian swirled her glass. "Where's the necklace?"

"Right here!" Finn patted his chest. "No one's taking it."

He didn't know the real danger lurked in the shadows.

Zero's gaze locked onto Vivian. That familiar face made his breath catch.

Shadow.

Four years. She'd vanished without a trace, only to reappear here. What stung more was the man standing beside her.

His mission demanded he seize the necklace. But for the first time, Zero hesitated.

He couldn't risk alerting her. Not yet.

Shadow was alive—the realization set his blood aflame. But why hadn't she contacted him? How had she been all these years?

His eyes darkened like stormy seas. He needed a plan. One that would make Shadow come to him.

With a final glance at Vivian's laughing figure, Zero melted into the darkness.

There would be time. They would meet again.
###Chapter 293

Dawn broke as the luxury cruise finally docked.

Vivian stood on the deck, the sea breeze tangling her hair. Something felt off—the Dark Web contract showed as accepted, yet the night had passed without incident.

Ethan approached her. "What's on your mind?"

"Nothing," she murmured.

Her gaze swept the bustling pier. An unseen presence prickled her instincts, but the crowd made it impossible to identify friend from foe.

"I'll drive you home," Ethan offered.

Vivian jingled her car keys. "No need. I've got my own ride."

In one swift motion, Ethan snatched the keys and tossed them to Finn. "No one drives exhausted."

Finn fumbled the catch. "Uh...maybe I could hitch a ride?"

Ethan's glare silenced him instantly.

"I'll ride with Finn then." Vivian reached for the keys.

Without warning, Ethan scooped her into his arms.

"Put me down!" She clenched her fists, ready to strike.

He carried her toward the lead vehicle—a sleek black Maybach—and deposited her in the backseat.

"This is kidnapping!" Her voice turned glacial.

The door slammed shut. "To the family estate," Ethan commanded the driver.

Just as Vivian prepared to retaliate, his hand closed over hers. His voice dropped to a velvet whisper. "Just one look. Please?"
###Chapter 294

"Where exactly are we going?" Vivian arched an eyebrow at Ethan.

"Afraid I'll abduct you?"

She scoffed. "As if you could."

Ethan remained silent, simply signaling the driver to proceed.

The capital's neon lights still blazed despite the late hour, painting streaks of color across the car windows.

When familiar streets came into view, Vivian's fingers tightened around her purse strap.

This was the gated community she'd called home for three years.

"What's the meaning of this?" Her voice strained as she stared at the unmistakable mansion.

"I bought it back." Ethan's tone betrayed no emotion.

Vivian remembered clearly—she'd listed this marital home immediately after their divorce.

"Too much money to burn, Mr. Roscente?"

"I wanted to give it to you." He turned to face her. "This place holds our memories."

"Memories?" Her laugh was bitter. "Did you ever spend a single night here?"

The endless evenings alone in this empty house were seared into her memory.

"It's not too late to start now." Ethan's gaze burned into her.

"Suit yourself." Vivian turned to leave.

This house only reminded her how foolish those three years had been.

Ethan caught her wrist. "Give me a chance to make things right."

"Let go." She wrenched free. "We're over."

Her eyes were glacial.

Ethan watched her silhouette dissolve into the night before instructing the driver to follow.

He pushed open the villa's front door.

The hollow foyer remained exactly as Vivian had left it.

Now it was his turn to taste loneliness.
###Chapter 295

Vivian Laurent lay on her bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Ethan Roscente's words echoed in her ears like a curse. What was this sudden act of devotion? Did he actually want to reconcile?

She turned over with frustration.

It was nearly 3 AM before she finally fell asleep.

The next morning, Finn Deross texted saying he was going home to give his mother the necklace.

Vivian's lips curved slightly as she read the message. The kid still thought she didn't know his true identity, even booking his flight in secret.

At the Deross mansion.

Finn froze the moment he stepped inside.

"Uncle..." His voice wavered.

Dominic Atlante sat on the sofa, long fingers tapping the armrest, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Finn swallowed hard and hurried to find his mother.

"Mom, this is for you." He presented the necklace like a prized offering.

Mrs. Deross gasped. "Isn't this the one from the auction? I heard it's extremely rare."

"Your son has skills now." Finn puffed his chest proudly.

His triumph was short-lived when the butler summoned him to see Dominic.

The study was hazy with smoke.

Dominic eyed him through the cigarette haze. "Your mentor... teaches well."

At the mention of Vivian, Finn's eyes lit up. "She's amazing! There's nothing she can't do!"

"Oh?" Dominic exhaled a smoke ring. "Better than me?"

Finn immediately clammed up.

"Is she Winner?" Dominic asked abruptly.

Finn nearly bit his tongue. "N-no! What Winner?"

"Same lying face you made at three when you wet your pants." Dominic smirked.

Finn flushed crimson.

"Uncle, you figured that out yourself," he muttered.

Dominic's eyes gleamed with interest. Any woman who could earn Finn's loyalty was clearly extraordinary.

After their last encounter, he'd been intrigued by Vivian. Now he wanted to meet her properly.

"Does she know who you are?"

"Probably not." Finn sounded confident. "I've been careful!"

Dominic scoffed. With Vivian's intelligence, she'd likely seen through the act long ago.

Perhaps... she'd even uncovered his own identity.
###Chapter 296

Dominic Atlante flicked the ash from his cigarette.

"When are you going back to Vivian?"

Finn Deross pouted. "I just got back three days ago."

"You're just lazing around here." Dominic narrowed his eyes. "At least you'll learn something useful with her."

Finn groaned. "I don't want to take over the family business!"

He much preferred tagging along with Vivian. Those thrilling missions were far more exciting than tedious corporate negotiations.

Dominic recalled the recent reports. Finn had handled several projects flawlessly.

The kid was finally showing promise.

"You don't get a choice." Dominic smirked. "You think the board enjoys endless meetings?"

Finn fell silent.

"Let me know when you leave." Dominic stubbed out his cigarette. "I'll see you off."

"I can go back on my own!" Finn protested. "I'm an adult now!"

Dominic gave him a look. "What's the difference between you at three and thirty?"

Finn agreed outwardly but secretly plotted to sneak away when the time came.

A smug grin tugged at his lips.

Dominic noted the expression. The kid was still too naive.

Vivian would have to toughen him up.

......

Vivian Laurent was cornered by Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre.

"You're playing favorites, Viv!" Lucas whined. "Now you only take Finn on missions."

Vivian shoved him away in disgust. "Stop being gross."

Isabella added with a laugh, "He's been sulking for two weeks."

"He's my apprentice." Vivian shot them a warning glare. "Don't bully him."

Isabella suddenly turned serious. "Do you know his background?"

"Dominic Atlante's nephew." Vivian said it like it was nothing.

"Which Dominic Atlante?" they asked in unison.

Vivian raised a brow. "How many are there?"

The office fell dead silent.

Isabella inhaled sharply. "You stole cargo from Integrity Group..."

"Yep." Vivian flashed a bright smile. "They still have a bounty on my head."
###Chapter 297

"Dominic Atlante is ruthless." Lucas Lefèvre lowered his voice. "They say the blood on his hands could dye an entire river red."

Vivian Laurent tapped the table lightly. "The rumors might be exaggerated, but they're not far from the truth."

"Are you insane?" Both siblings slammed their hands on the table simultaneously.

Isabella Langley set down her coffee cup with a clatter. "Keeping Finn Deross by your side is like carrying a ticking time bomb."

"Finn as a spy?" Vivian burst out laughing. "The boy stutters when he lies."

"What if he's faking it..." Lucas frowned deeply.

"He couldn't keep up the act for three days." Vivian waved her hand dismissively. "If it comes to deception, who's fooling who remains to be seen."

Isabella snorted. "True. That kid's definitely missing a few screws."

Miles away at the Atlante residence, Finn suddenly sneezed.

"But there's been movement on the Dark Web since your Winner identity was exposed." Isabella changed the subject. "Someone put a bounty on that necklace. The contract was accepted, but no action's been taken. That's highly unusual."

Vivian's eyes sharpened. She knew the Dark Web's rules - accepted contracts must be executed, or face astronomical penalties.

"The necklace is already in Mrs. Atlante's possession." Vivian tapped the table. "I went through auction procedures. Two hundred million anonymous transaction."

Money transferred from one pocket to another, perfectly laundering its origins.

"The weather's perfect today..." Isabella suddenly stretched. "How about some horseback riding?"

Lucas glanced out the window. "I'm game."

"Let's bring a young friend." Vivian shook her phone. "An eighteen-year-old girl. My former patient."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Don't tell me it's the Roscente—"

"Don't be ridiculous." Vivian rolled her eyes. "Emily Garnache, heiress to the Garnache Group."

Emily was bored out of her mind at home when Vivian's call came through. She nearly jumped off the couch in excitement.

"Dad said yes!" The girl's bright voice came through the receiver. "Dr. Laurent, wait while I change!"

Thirty minutes later, a pink sports car pulled up in front of the Garnache mansion. Emily bounded into the vehicle like a bird set free from its cage.

"Finally getting out!" Her eyes sparkled. "Dad wouldn't even let me walk in the garden."

Vivian ruffled her hair. "We'll have fun today."

Three cars headed toward the Royal Equestrian Club in the suburbs. Sunlight filtered through clouds, casting dappled shadows on the asphalt.
###Chapter 298

"Vivian, I finally get to see you!" The young girl's eyes sparkled like a cheerful bunny.

Ever since that unpleasant encounter with Natalie during their last dinner, she'd been too afraid to visit Vivian again.

Every time she came, something unexpected happened. She didn't want to cause any more trouble.

Vivian smiled and ruffled her hair. "Come see me anytime you miss me."

"Okay!"

Lucas started the car as the group headed to the newly opened equestrian club.

Isabella had done her research. This place boasted top-notch facilities with various entertainment options besides horseback riding.

She'd made reservations in advance and was excited to bring everyone along.

But they were stopped at the entrance.

"Apologies, we're closed for a private event today," the staff member said regretfully.

"Private event?" Isabella frowned. "Why wasn't this mentioned when we booked?"

"My sincere apologies..."

"Was this booking made before or after ours?" Isabella pressed.

The staff hesitated. "After..."

"Who has that kind of pull?" Isabella narrowed her eyes.

Before the staff could answer, a lazy male voice interrupted. "That would be me."

The smug tone was unmistakable.

Vivian and Isabella turned simultaneously to see Felix leaning against the doorway with an infuriating grin.

"Felix, you bastard!" Isabella's knuckles cracked.

"Who are you calling a bastard?" Felix shot back. "At least I don't give people nicknames!"

"You did this on purpose, didn't you?" Isabella gritted her teeth. "Booked the place right after me?"

Felix admitted shamelessly. "Guilty as charged."

He raised an eyebrow. "Who was it that hung a 'Felix & Dogs Not Allowed' sign at the bar last time? Now you know how it feels!"

This equestrian club happened to be his newest business venture. Talk about bad luck.

Isabella charged at him without hesitation. "Need your ass kicked again?"

Felix took off running. "Tigress! No wonder you're still single!"

"None of your damn business!"

Their chase resembled a classic love-hate dynamic.

Eventually, Isabella caught Felix in a wrestling hold.

"Had enough?" She tightened her grip.

"Fine! Fine!" Felix winced. "Must you always be so rough?"

"Yes."

"Then let me go?"

"Only if you let us in. No more blocking us in the future."

"Deal!"

Isabella released him and winked at Vivian. "Sorted. He's treating us today too."

"When did I—"

A sharp glare from Isabella made Felix backtrack immediately. "Right. Everything's on me today."
###Chapter 299

Isabella Langley nodded in satisfaction and followed them into the equestrian grounds.

Vivian Laurent lingered behind, lowering her voice to Felix Valdemar. "Don't tell Ethan Roscente about me being here today."

If that man found out, he'd come chasing after her again.

Felix chuckled mischievously. "Dr. Laurent, I'm afraid it's too late for that."

The moment he saw Isabella's reservation, he'd guessed Vivian would come and immediately tipped off Ethan.

Vivian sighed, rubbing her temples.

Now she understood why Felix kept getting punched—he absolutely deserved it.

The sprawling equestrian club housed meticulously selected horses, each groomed to gleaming perfection.

Emily Garnache, still recovering from surgery, could only lead a docile pony around slowly.

While Vivian and Isabella were choosing their mounts, Felix sidled up. "Isabella, do you even know how to ride? Wouldn't want you falling off and becoming even more unmarriageable."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Don't jinx it. My suitors could form a line from here to Paris. Even if no one wanted me, I could always marry Lucas, right Lucas?"

Lucas Lefèvre smiled. "My door's always open."

Isabella lifted her chin triumphantly. "See? My fiancé's right here!"

Felix knew they were joking and didn't take offense.

He snorted. "If you can't ride, I could reluctantly teach you."

"With your amateur skills? Save them for impressing other girls."

Isabella pointed to a chestnut stallion. "I want this one. Bring it out."

The staff hesitated. "Um..."

"Problem?" Isabella frowned.

"The horse is fine..." The attendant glanced nervously at Felix—this was the boss's personal mount.

After receiving Felix's subtle nod, the staff said, "Right away, miss."

Isabella went to change into riding gear. Vivian continued browsing—the horses were too tame for her taste.

Her gaze landed on a pure black stallion in the corner. "I'll take that one."

"That one?" Felix's eyes widened. "Dr. Laurent, maybe choose another."

"Why?"

"That beast is untamable. Even I can't handle it." Felix was being honest—only Ethan had ever managed to ride it.

Previous challengers had either been thrown or kicked off.

But Vivian's interest only grew. "Perfect. That's the one."

"Dr. Laurent, this isn't a joke—"

"I know." Vivian's gaze was unwavering. "That's my choice."

Seeing he couldn't dissuade her, Felix muttered to himself: This stubbornness was carved from the same mold as Ethan's.
###Chapter 300

Felix Valdemar waved his hand, signaling the staff to bring the horses over.

"Take a break first." He turned to the waiter. "Prepare some drinks."

In the corner, Chloe Ashcroft reluctantly wiped coffee cups in her uniform. Her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

When her gaze landed on a familiar figure nearby, her entire body froze.

Vivian Laurent.

The woman who had ruined her life now sat leisurely in the equestrian club's lounge.

Chloe's breathing turned ragged. The tray in her hands trembled slightly as she glared at Vivian's flawless profile, her eyes burning with hatred.

Three months ago, she had been the youngest resident physician at the city's central hospital. Now she couldn't even wear a lab coat anymore.

Her family had disowned her. Her savings were nearly gone. The once pampered heiress now survived by serving drinks.

"Your coffee." Chloe mechanically placed the cup on the table, her nails nearly piercing the coaster.

She stole a glance at the thoroughbred Vivian had chosen. A vicious plan took shape in her mind.

Inside the stable storage room, Chloe's hands shook as she drew triple the normal dose of stimulant into a syringe. She would use this horse to ensure Vivian never walked again.

"Vivian, that woman looks suspicious." Emily Garnache whispered after returning from the restroom. "She's lurking around your horse."

Vivian followed her gaze and smirked.

"An old acquaintance."

Near the stables, Chloe struggled with the spirited horse. Each time she tried to approach, the animal snorted threateningly.

"Damn beast!" She cursed through gritted teeth, oblivious to the cold stare behind her.

Emily nervously clutched Vivian's sleeve. "Should we call security?"

Vivian shook her head slightly, amusement flashing in her eyes.

"Let her continue."
###Chapter 301

Vivian Laurent leaned against the fence, her fingers lightly tapping the railing.

Emily Garnache stomped her foot anxiously. "Viv, she's really going to do it!"

"Relax." Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Horses are smarter than people."

Chloe Ashcroft crept toward the stables, a syringe clutched in her hand. She glanced around, making sure no one was watching, her eyes gleaming with malice.

Vivian exchanged a glance with Felix Valdemar. Understanding her silent cue, Felix discreetly led the staff away from the scene.

A sharp whinny of pain pierced the air.

Before Chloe could inject the substance, the enraged horse reared and kicked her three meters back.

"Ah!" She crashed to the ground, the sickening crack of her ribs echoing in the night.

Vivian finally strolled over. "What a surprise, Dr. Ashcroft. Midnight horseplay?"

Emily bit back a laugh, finally grasping Vivian's plan.

"You!" Chloe's face twisted in agony. "You set me up!"

Vivian tilted her head. "Now why would you say that? Though I must admit, administering injections to horses in the dead of night is quite the career change."

"Shut up!" Chloe tried to push herself up but collapsed again, sweat beading on her forehead.

Vivian bent down and picked up the fallen syringe. "Let me guess what's inside. First attempted murder, now animal cruelty?"

Chloe paled. "I—I was just checking on the horse..."

"Oh?" Vivian chuckled. "How thoughtful of you, Doctor. But my horse is perfectly healthy."

She turned and took the reins. The horse nuzzled her shoulder affectionately.

"Vivian Laurent! This isn't over!" Chloe's furious scream faded into the night breeze.

Vivian waved without looking back. Hatred was nothing new—Chloe wasn't even worth remembering.

Sirens wailed in the distance. By the time the paramedics arrived with a stretcher, Chloe had already passed out from the pain.

"Pity." Vivian stroked the horse's mane. "She missed the best part—watching them carry her away."

Under the moonlight, the horse snorted, as if agreeing with its mistress.
###Chapter 302

Vivian Laurent narrowed her eyes at the woman being carried away on a stretcher.

"How did she end up here?"

Felix Valdemar followed her gaze. "Who?"

"The one on the stretcher."

Felix shrugged. "No idea. Her uniform looks like stable staff. You know her? Bad blood?"

The woman had glared at Vivian with pure hatred moments ago.

"No bad blood," Vivian said coolly. "She's the only one holding a grudge."

Chloe Ashcroft could have had a bright future.

What a shame.

Vivian turned toward the stables to pick a horse for riding.

Felix's eyes widened as he watched the temperamental stallion obediently follow Vivian out.

That same horse had kicked Chloe just minutes ago.

"Be careful, Dr. Laurent! That stallion's vicious."

"Hmm." Vivian stroked the horse's mane gently.

The fiery stallion became docile as a kitten under her touch.

Instead of mounting immediately, she fed it an apple.

"Don't bother, it won't eat—" Felix's words died as the horse lowered its head to nibble the fruit.

"Won't eat what?" Vivian offered a carrot next.

Felix's jaw dropped. "It's actually eating from your hand?"

He'd tried countless times before—the stallion wouldn't even sniff his offerings.

"Problem?" Vivian found the horse perfectly well-behaved.

Determined, Felix grabbed a carrot and approached.

The stallion turned its head away in clear distaste.

"Just one bite," Felix coaxed.

The horse snorted, spraying saliva across his face.

Then it affectionately nuzzled Vivian's hand.

Isabella Langley burst into laughter. "Felix, even the horse rejects you!"

"There's something wrong with this horse!" Felix protested.

The stallion suddenly reared, making him stumble backward.

Vivian patted its neck. "Let's go for a run."

She swung onto the saddle with effortless grace.

Felix muttered as she rode away, "Ethan's going to flip when he finds out someone took his prized stallion..."

Ethan Roscente arrived in his crisp suit, still carrying the boardroom's chill.

"Ethan!" Felix called. "Your stallion's been stolen—by Dr. Laurent!"
###Chapter 303

"Let her ride." A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan Roscente's eyes. He hadn't expected Vivian Laurent to tame Stormchaser.

Felix Valdemar shook his head dramatically. "That wild stallion only obeys you. I bet Dr. Luna is face-first in the mud by now. Why else would she be silent for so long?"

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly.

He raised slender fingers to his lips and let out a sharp whistle.

Vivian was galloping across the field, her crimson riding coat billowing like flames. The horse's speed and power left her breathless.

Suddenly Stormchaser skidded to a halt and pivoted.

"Hey!" Vivian lurched forward, caught off guard. "What's going on?"

The stallion bolted back the way they'd come, faster than before.

Gripping the reins, Vivian guessed what was happening.

Stormchaser burst through the trees and headed straight for Ethan, nuzzling his arm affectionately.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Ethan Roscente!"

"He's spirited." Ethan stroked the horse's mane. "I worried you couldn't handle him."

With a fluid motion, Vivian dismounted, her red coat swirling around her.

"Your horse?"

"Yes."

Vivian scoffed. "Fine stallion. Pity about his owner. Why not come with me instead?"

Stormchaser flicked his tail and hid behind Ethan.

Ethan chuckled. "Go play with her."

The stallion obediently walked to Vivian and lowered his head submissively.

"You planned this?" Vivian glared at him.

"Didn't want you to fall."

Vivian covered the horse's ears. "Don't listen to him. Let's go!"

She swung onto the saddle, crimson fabric blazing. "Hyah!"

Horse and rider soon vanished from sight.

Ethan gazed after them, his lips curving unconsciously.

Felix gaped. "Ethan, are you possessed?"

He'd never seen that expression on his friend's face before.

Ethan's icy glare snapped back to him.

Felix exhaled in relief. "That's more like it."

But inwardly he grumbled: All warmth and smiles for Dr. Laurent, but freeze him out with a single look? The blatant favoritism was ridiculous!
###Chapter 304 

Vivian Laurent hadn't galloped so freely in ages. Stormchaser lived up to its name as a prized stallion, its hooves kicking up wind as they raced across the field. She felt like she was flying.

The exhilaration was intoxicating.

When she returned from her ride, she noticed Isabella Langley and Felix Valdemar were nowhere in sight. Only Lucas Lefèvre remained, patiently guiding Emily Garnache's pony at a walking pace.

It was Emily's first time riding. Her palms were sweaty with nerves, but Lucas's presence helped calm her.

"Thanks for staying with me, Lucas. This must be boring for you."

"Vivian asked me to look after you," Lucas replied with a smile. "I ride often enough. Missing one day won't matter."

Vivian observed them from a distance, choosing not to interrupt. Emily deserved to enjoy this rare outing.

As she dismounted to get water, a bottle appeared before her.

"Stay hydrated." Ethan Roscente's fingers were long and steady around the plastic.

"Thanks." Vivian accepted it, noticing the cap had already been loosened.

Ethan studied her. "I'm surprised Stormchaser let you ride him. He's temperamental—only obeys his groom. Even Felix can't handle him."

"Horses understand people." Vivian stroked the stallion's neck, earning an affectionate nuzzle in return.

She fed Stormchaser some hay while Ethan stood silently nearby. He didn't push conversation, aware she might prefer silence.

Just then, Isabella limped into view with Felix trailing behind.

"You did that on purpose! I was riding fine until you showed up. Stay away from me!" Isabella fumed.

Felix sighed. "It was an accident."

"Enough! Stop following me!" Isabella shook him off.

Vivian intercepted them. "What happened?"

"He startled me from behind and made me fall!" Isabella pointed to the scrapes on her knee.

"I said it wasn't intentional."

"Then you were trying to kill me for my inheritance!"

"Like I'd want your pocket change?" Felix rolled his eyes.

"You just wanted to humiliate me!"

"Don't call me that!"

Vivian stepped between them. "Why do you two always argue?"

"Who's arguing with him?" Isabella crossed her arms. "If I'd known this was his stable, I'd never have come!"

"Nobody invited you," Felix muttered.

As their bickering threatened to escalate, Vivian intervened. "We've had enough fun for today. Let's head back."

Her gaze flickered to Ethan's figure, stirring unease. It wasn't dislike—just how effortlessly he disrupted her composure.

This man had a way of dismantling her rationality. Perhaps, Vivian decided, avoiding him was for the best.
###Chapter 305

"Let's go somewhere else. Seeing certain people ruins my appetite." Isabella Langley scoffed, dragging Lucas Lefèvre and Emily Garnache away.

"Like anyone wants to look at you," Felix Valdemar muttered, rolling his eyes at their retreating figures.

Ethan Roscente's gaze remained fixed on Vivian Laurent's disappearing silhouette.

"See that? Isabella's completely unreasonable," Felix complained, moving closer. "We should avoid them from now on."

Ethan didn't respond, his eyes still tracking Vivian.

Felix's stomach dropped. He recognized that look all too well.

"She's long gone, man. Still staring?" Felix smirked. "Don't tell me you've actually fallen for Dr. Laurent?"

Ethan's pulse stuttered.

Fallen for Vivian?

All he knew was he wanted to be near her, to hear her voice. But Vivian always kept him at arm's length.

Ethan swallowed hard. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Who's being ridiculous?" Felix wiggled his eyebrows. "You're the most eligible bachelor in town. If you like her, go for it."

The mention of divorce made Ethan's expression turn icy.

"What? Did I say something wrong?" Felix shrank under his glare.

"She's different."

"How?"

"She's Vivian."

"Yeah, Dr. Luna. The genius surgeon." Felix shrugged. "Just happens to share your ex-wife's name."

To everyone else, the two Vivians were worlds apart.

One was a brilliant, stunning physician. The other had been a plain, unremarkable housewife.

Felix's eyes suddenly widened. "Wait... you don't mean because of the name—"

"She is." Ethan cut him off.

"What?!" Felix nearly jumped. "She's your ex-wife?"

Impossible.

That timid, overweight woman was the same as the radiant Dr. Laurent standing before them?

"Are you absolutely sure?" Felix's voice cracked. "She never even went to college!"

Ethan remained silent.

The woman who'd once feared starving after their divorce was now medicine's rising star?
###Chapter 306
The Substitute

"Absolutely true."

Felix Valdemar's voice held disbelief.

The world had truly gone mad.

"She used to love you desperately, but now she looks at you like a stranger. No wonder she refused to save Sophia Evans. I wouldn't either."

"Sophia is not my lover," Ethan Roscente interrupted coldly.

"I know. But Vivian Laurent doesn't. The outside world knows nothing about your brother's existence—not even Vivian."

"My brother's matter isn't for public discussion," Ethan said firmly.

Alexander Roscente was the Roscente family's unacknowledged illegitimate son. He had never considered himself part of the family.

"Was Vivian an outsider? She was your wife. If you hid things from the person who shared your bed, of course she misunderstood. If you couldn't let go, why divorce her in the first place?"

Ethan remained silent.

Felix pressed on, "Winning her back won't be easy now. Ethan, this must be what they call the 'chasing-your-ex-into-hell' trope."

"Enough!" Ethan snapped.

He left the Royal Equestrian Club shortly after.

For days, he couldn't catch a glimpse of Vivian.

DarkKingdom Headquarters.

News of Zero's failed mission sent shockwaves through the organization.

He was summoned by the director for questioning.

Zero offered an excuse and brushed it off.

As he stepped out of the office, a crisp voice called, "Master!"

"Annika? Shouldn't you be training?"

Annika Heilbronn was the youngest operative in DarkKingdom. At eighteen, she was already ruthlessly efficient.

The organization raised agents from childhood. Annika had been brought in as a child.

Brutal training weeded out the weak. Only the strongest survived.

Four years ago, Zero had stumbled upon Annika moments before her elimination.

Her eyes reminded him of someone.

Against protocol, he spared her.

Over the years, Zero personally trained her. Her eyes grew more familiar—they mirrored Shadow's.

"My shooting and combat skills have been off lately. I need your guidance."

Firearms and hand-to-hand combat were essential survival skills.

Training sessions with Zero were her happiest moments.

"Follow me."

Zero walked ahead.

Annika watched his back, adoration in her gaze.

Without Zero, she wouldn't exist.

She knew of the legend within DarkKingdom—Shadow.

Shadow had vanished mysteriously four years ago. Rumors claimed death by failed mission.

Zero took her in shortly after Shadow's disappearance.

Some said her eyes resembled Shadow's.

Some called her Shadow's substitute.

But Shadow was gone.

She was content being the replacement.
###Chapter 307

Annika jogged to catch up with Zero.

"Master, is something bothering you lately?"

She tilted her head, studying his profile.

Zero abruptly stopped walking.

Annika crashed into his back with a startled gasp.

"Sorry, Master." She rubbed her nose apologetically.

Zero turned to face her. His gaze lingered on her features.

For a fleeting moment, her eyes made him falter.

"It's nothing." He looked away.

The bloodied fourteen-year-old girl from his memories had grown up.

Those hauntingly familiar eyes were why he'd broken his rules to take her in.

Four years later, the resemblance to Shadow was undeniable.

But when the real Shadow stood before him, the difference was staggering.

Shadow's eyes burned with unshakable confidence and razor-sharp intensity.

Her innate dominance was unmatched.

Annika had spirit, but it paled in comparison.

Shadow was the kind of warrior who could rise from the mud, battered but unbroken.

There would only ever be one Shadow.

"Master?" Annika's voice trembled.

His icy stare frightened her—like she was a stranger.

"Resume training." Zero snapped back to reality.

Annika immediately clung to his arm with a pout.

Zero frowned slightly.

Shadow would never do this.

She'd simply say, "I can handle it myself."

At the thought of Shadow, his mind drifted again.

......

Vivian pushed open her front door late at night.

The villa's lights were on.

Her brow arched. Had Finn returned?

The moment she stepped inside, a figure lunged at her.

"Master!"

Vivian gasped as the breath was squeezed from her lungs.

"Let go." She smacked Finn's back.

Finn released her with a cheeky grin.

"Did you miss me?"

"No." Her expression remained blank.

"Liar!" He sulked. "Mom said thanks for the necklace."

He pulled a gift box from his bag.

"This is for you."
###Chapter 308

Finn Deross returned with arms full of lavish gifts.

The living room was now cluttered with exquisite packages—imported delicacies to limited-edition designer bags, each item worth a fortune.

Vivian Laurent's spacious apartment had lost a third of its floor space to these ostentatious offerings.

But what truly caught her off guard was the man lounging on her sofa.

"Miss Laurent. Long time no see."

Dominic Atlante reclined with the ease of someone in his own home.

"Mr. Atlante... Rainier Valence?"

Vivian deliberately used the alias from their last encounter.

Dominic's brow twitched. "Rainier Valence?"

"Your nephew told me that was your name." She turned to Finn. "Isn't that right?"

Finn gave an awkward chuckle. "Uh... yeah?"

He shot a nervous glance at his uncle.

No way was he explaining this was the head of the North American Syndicate.

Dominic's expression remained unreadable. "Indeed. I'm Rainier Valence."

"To what do I owe this visit, Mr. Atlante?" Vivian kept her tone guarded.

Last time he'd come for information. What was his agenda now?

"Finn speaks of you often." Dominic crossed his ankles. "Says the capital is fascinating. I thought I'd see for myself."

Her stomach dropped.

That sounded like a long-term stay.

"The capital has its charms." She forced calm into her voice. "I can recommend excellent hotels and itineraries."

"No need." His gaze pinned her. "I'll stay here. With Finn."

Vivian nearly bit through her tongue.

"Hotels offer more comfort." Her smile strained. "I host frequent gatherings. It gets loud."

Dominic shrugged. "I enjoy lively atmospheres."

"I'm rarely home."

"That's fine."

Her fingers curled into fists.

The man was clearly planting himself here.

"But I'm just a defenseless woman." She feigned vulnerability. "Living with two men hardly seems safe."

Dominic's lips quirked. "What exactly are you concerned about, Miss Laurent?"

"You, Mr. Atlante." Her gaze turned pointed. "Appearances can be deceiving."

"Unnecessary worry." He stood, closing the distance between them. "I'm merely a businessman."

Vivian instinctively stepped back.

"If safety is your concern..." He leaned in, his breath warm against her skin. "We could draft an agreement."

Her pulse stuttered.

"What kind of agreement?"

"A cohabitation contract." His smirk deepened. "To guarantee your protection."
###Chapter 309

Dominic Atlante leaned back on the leather sofa, his long fingers tapping the armrest. "You're overthinking, Miss Laurent. I have no interest in you."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. Where did this man get such confidence?

"This is my territory. I make the rules here." She crossed her arms, refusing to back down.

Finn quickly intervened. "Uncle, let me book a hotel for you."

Dominic gave a slight nod. His trip to this country appeared to be a vacation, but he had other plans. This woman who'd snatched business from his grasp needed to be assessed.

If she proved useful, she'd stay. If not, she'd be eliminated.

Finn arranged the hotel swiftly. Dominic stood, his tailored suit pants accentuating his long legs as he took two steps forward. "Thank you for looking after my nephew, Miss Laurent."

"It was nothing." Vivian smiled, her expression unreadable. "I only hope you'll remember this favor in the future."

"How about dinner tomorrow? My treat."

"No need for the extravagance."

Finn chimed in. "Don't be polite, Master! My uncle's loaded!"

Dominic's piercing gaze bore into her, radiating undeniable pressure. "Are you refusing my invitation, Miss Laurent?"

Vivian met his eyes. They were bottomless pits, sharp as blades.

"Then I suppose I can't decline."

"Seven o'clock tomorrow evening."

"Fine."

After Dominic left, Vivian turned to Finn. "Did your uncle really come all this way just to see you off?"

"He still treats me like a kid." Finn pouted.

Vivian suddenly smirked. "What if I took a contract to steal from your uncle's company right now..."

Finn's heart skipped. "You know about his company?"

"Just a guess." Vivian fiddled with her phone absently.

Finn exhaled inwardly. Good. His cover was still intact.
###Chapter 310

The first light of dawn crept across the sky as Ethan Roscente's private car glided into the company's underground garage.

He adjusted his tie and stepped into the private elevator.

Simon Eisner hurried after him with a tablet. "Mr. Roscente, the board meeting is at ten this morning. At three, we have a video conference with the overseas client."

Ethan rubbed his temples.

Three consecutive days of international meetings had left his eyes bloodshot.

"Any movement from Victor Roscente?"

"Nothing suspicious so far." Simon lowered his voice. "But our people spotted questionable cargo at the docks."

Ethan's gaze sharpened.

As the elevator doors slid open, he suddenly asked, "Does Vivian have any plans today?"

Simon blinked. "Miss Laurent's schedule... Should I check?"

Ethan waved him off.

He knew Vivian was avoiding him.

His impulsiveness at the gallery last time had clearly unsettled her.

Night fell, city lights flickering to life.

Vivian stood in her apartment, selecting an evening gown for her outing.

Her phone lit up with a message from Dominic Atlante: "I'm downstairs."

She hadn't expected the head of Integrity Group to personally pick her up.

Beside the black Maybach, Dominic held the car door open for her.

"Finn isn't coming?" Vivian glanced around.

Dominic smirked. "Miss Laurent trusts me enough to get in my car?"

"Planning to sell me?" She fastened her seatbelt. "Remember to split the profit fifty-fifty."

Amusement flickered in Dominic's eyes.

It had been a long time since anyone dared speak to him like that.

"I'm curious," he said, turning the steering wheel. "Why aren't you afraid of me?"

"Afraid?" Vivian arched a brow. "You don't have three heads or six arms."

The car merged onto the main road.

Dominic suddenly said, "Want to test it?"

"Test what?"

"Take a knife to you." His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather. "See if you bleed."

Vivian laughed. "Then I'd have to expel Finn from my tutelage."

"Be my guest." Dominic kept his eyes on the road. "That kid's thick-skinned. Feel free to bully him."

In the rearview mirror, she caught the faint curve of his lips.
###Chapter 311

The night had fallen, and the city lights began to glow.

A black Maybach pulled up smoothly in front of the Imperial View Hotel. A valet rushed forward, respectfully accepting the car keys.

Dominic Atlante opened the car door for Vivian Laurent with gentlemanly grace. She wore an emerald green velvet gown that made her skin glow like porcelain.

They walked side by side into the grand lobby. The chandelier's light cascaded over them, casting a picture-perfect silhouette.

"I heard their French cuisine is quite authentic," Dominic murmured, leaning slightly toward her ear.

Vivian smiled faintly. "Then I shall savor every bite."

Just behind them, a silver Bentley came to an abrupt stop.

Ethan Roscente was about to exit when a familiar figure caught his peripheral vision. He froze.

Vivian.

Beside her stood an unfamiliar man in an impeccably tailored suit, exuding effortless elegance.

They stood close. The man said something that made Vivian cover her mouth with a delicate laugh.

Ethan's fingers tightened unconsciously on the steering wheel, the leather creaking under his grip.

By the time he regained his composure, they had disappeared through the revolving doors.

"Mr. Roscente?" His assistant Simon Eisner prompted quietly. "Mr. Zhang and his team have arrived."

Ethan took a deep breath, forcing his gaze away.

In the conference room, several business partners sat stiffly in their seats.

"Regarding this project..." Mr. Zhang began, only to notice Ethan's distracted expression.

The man's sharp profile looked even more severe under the lighting. He kept fidgeting with his lighter, his eyes drifting toward the door.

Beads of sweat formed on Mr. Zhang's forehead. He gritted his teeth. "We're willing to concede two additional percentage points."

Silence.

"Three points!" Mr. Zhang's voice trembled.

Ethan suddenly stood up.

The room held its breath.

"I need a smoke." He walked out without looking back.

From the far end of the corridor, the faint sound of piano music drifted.

Ethan stood at the corner, his gaze locked on the ornate wooden door.

A sliver of warm light escaped through the crack. He could almost hear the delicate clinking of cutlery inside.

Who was that man?

Why did Vivian smile at him like that?

Countless questions swirled in his mind. Ethan reached for a cigarette, only to find his hands shaking slightly.

He crushed the cigarette violently in his palm.
###Chapter 312

Ethan Roscente stood at the corridor corner, his hawk-like gaze locked onto the private dining room where Vivian Laurent sat. His long fingers absently traced the cufflinks, knuckles turning white.

Inside the room, Vivian faced Dominic Atlante across the massive round table. With only two occupants, the space felt unnervingly vast.

"Where's Finn?" Vivian arched a brow.

Her fingertips tapped the table as her wary eyes scanned the tableware. Dining with a crime lord made even the water glass seem suspect.

"He's on assignment." Dominic's expression remained unreadable.

In truth, he'd forbidden Finn from coming. The persistent brat had only backed down after one lethal glare.

Vivian smirked and quickly texted Finn. Her phone vibrated instantly: "On a mission, enjoy your dinner."

Dominic ordered with practiced elegance, handing the tablet to the waiter. His refined movements betrayed none of his underworld brutality.

"Keeping busy, Ms. Laurent?" He dabbed his napkin, the question deceptively casual.

"Barely have time to breathe." Her spine stiffened.

"Need assistance?"

"Not causing trouble would be help enough."

Dominic leaned forward suddenly, danger flashing in his eyes. "Some people meddle in others' affairs—steal what isn't theirs. Don't you think they deserve to die?"

Her fingers stilled. The threat was clear. Those arms had been military property—she'd merely returned them.

"Reclaiming stolen goods isn't theft." Her retort was razor-sharp.

Their gazes clashed, plunging the room into icy silence. The waiter nearly dropped the next course.

Then Dominic chuckled low. Both maintained the charade of civility, neither breaching the unspoken truce.

The meal progressed like a duel. Vivian barely touched her food before setting down her fork.

"Thanks for the hospitality." She rose to leave.

Dominic wiped his mouth deliberately. "My pleasure. After all, you're my nephew's... friend."

He emphasized the last word, his smirk loaded with implication.

At the door, Vivian turned abruptly. "Since Finn works under me now, I'd appreciate some... restraint."

Her warning was clear: next time she intercepted his shipments, gloves would come off.

Dominic swirled his wineglass, the crimson liquid mirroring his cold smile. This game had only just begun.
###Chapter 313

Vivian Laurent stood in the walk-in closet, her fingers trailing over rows of neatly hung garments.

Her gaze lingered on a particular drawer.

"Strange..."

She murmured to herself, brows slightly furrowed.

The drawer slid open to reveal empty space.

Vivian turned toward the vanity.

The jewelry box had been thoroughly searched.

"How could it not be here..."

A faint tremor of panic laced her voice.

The bedroom door creaked open.

"Looking for something?"

Ethan Roscente's deep voice came from behind her.

Vivian's fingers stilled.

"Our marriage certificate."

She turned to face him directly.

"Where did you put it?"

Ethan leaned against the doorframe, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows.

"Is it important?"

He arched an eyebrow.

Vivian pressed her lips together.

"Of course it is."

Her fingertips absently traced the edge of the vanity.

Ethan stepped into the room.

"I remember after last using it..."

His words abruptly cut off.

Vivian's heartbeat stuttered.

"Using it?"

She caught the phrasing with sharp precision.

Ethan closed the distance between them.

"The company needed a copy."

His explanation came calmly.

Vivian tilted her head up to meet his gaze.

"When was this?"

Her voice was soft.

Ethan reached out to brush a strand of hair from her face.

"Last month."

His dark eyes held hers.

Vivian took a step back.

"Why didn't you tell me?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

Ethan withdrew his hand.

"It wasn't significant."

His tone remained even.

Vivian drew a slow breath.

"Our marriage certificate isn't significant?"

A slight quiver betrayed her.

Ethan studied her for a silent moment.

"You've been preoccupied with this lately."

It wasn't a question.

Vivian averted her face.

"I just want to know where it is."

Sunlight slanted through the window.

His shadow enveloped her.

"I'll find it for you."

He finally conceded.

Vivian didn't respond.

Only the ticking of the wall clock filled the silence.
###Chapter 314

Ethan Roscente's gaze locked onto the two figures like a hawk.

Vivian Laurent broke the silence first. "Anything else?"

She turned to leave.

The scorching grip on her wrist didn't budge.

Dominic Atlante interjected smoothly. "Forced affection never lasts."

"Who are you?" Ethan scrutinized the unfamiliar man.

Tall and imposing, the stranger carried an air of casual danger.

Tension crackled between the two men.

"Ancient history isn't worth revisiting." Dominic's lips curved with hidden meaning.

Ethan's fists clenched.

"Let go!" Vivian struggled. "We've already signed the divorce papers. There's no marriage certificate!"

That document she'd touched countless times had long turned to ashes.

Dominic added fuel to the fire. "Pathetic, clinging after the divorce."

A flash of pain crossed Ethan's eyes.

"At least we have years of history," he countered coldly. "Where did you crawl out from?"

"Funny. She never mentioned you either." Dominic remained unruffled. "I'll be taking care of her now."

Vivian's eyes widened.

Ethan's voice turned glacial. "Her affairs are none of your concern."

"Enough!" Vivian snapped.

The men stood like drawn swords.

Amusement flickered in Dominic's gaze.

Ethan's knuckles whitened.

Vivian wrenched free. "I'm not some trophy for you to fight over!"
###Chapter 315

Dominic Atlante crossed his arms, a cold smirk playing on his lips. "You've angered her. No wonder you got divorced."

Ethan Roscente's breath hitched.

She still got upset because of him? Did that mean he could still affect her emotions?

"Vivian, I—"

The neighboring private room door swung open. Their business associate poked his head out. "Mr. Roscente, you've been gone so long for a smoke, I thought—"

The man's gaze darted between the three of them before he tactfully retreated.

Vivian finally understood it was just coincidence. She turned to leave.

Dominic followed. "Same direction."

Ethan immediately called Simon Eisner. "Take over the negotiations."

His dark eyes tracked the car carrying Vivian into the distance.

Inside the vehicle, Dominic tapped the steering wheel. "Didn't expect someone as young as Ms. Laurent to already have marriage experience."

"Youthful recklessness." Vivian stared out the window. "Though he wasn't entirely terrible."

At least he'd saved her life once.

"Still love him?"

"That's crossing a line, Mr. Atlante."

"Such tension just mentioning him?" Dominic chuckled. "I'm only concerned about Finn being affected."

"Your romantic history must be far more colorful."

"Curious? Feel free to ask anytime."

Vivian turned away. "Not interested."

The car stopped at her apartment building. In the rearview mirror, a black Maybach flickered in and out of view.

"Not inviting me up for coffee?" Dominic unbuckled his seatbelt.

"Coffee at midnight?"

"Jet lag." He checked his watch. "It's afternoon tea time for me."

Vivian pushed the car door open. "Suit yourself."

Two figures disappeared into the building. Inside the Maybach, Ethan clenched his fists.

She was bringing a man home for the night?

What was their relationship?

His burning gaze remained fixed on the lit window. He kept telling himself: That man would be kicked out soon.
###Chapter 316

Finn Deross lounged on the sofa, watching as Vivian Laurent and Dominic Atlante entered one after another. He immediately pouted.

"You went out without me again!"

Vivian tossed her bag onto the entryway table without looking back. "Make your uncle a cup of coffee."

"On it!" Finn sprang up like a fish leaping from water. Three minutes later, he returned with a steaming cup.

Dominic didn’t want it, but he took a sip anyway.

"I'm going to bed," Vivian said, already heading upstairs. "Finn, see your uncle out."

The living room fell silent.

Dominic tapped the rim of his cup. "Have you met Vivian’s ex-husband?"

"Ethan Roscente!" Finn’s eyes lit up. "The ruthless CEO of Roscente Group. My mentor has impeccable taste."

"Ethan Roscente..." Dominic narrowed his eyes.

Three years ago, Roscente Group had been on the brink of collapse. At eighteen, Ethan took the helm. Everyone expected him to fail, but the young man used iron-fisted tactics to revive the company. Now, he was a titan of the business world.

"When did they get married?"

Finn scratched his head. "Three years ago, I think? Not sure about the details. Why do you ask?"

"Just curious." Dominic stared into his coffee, his gaze darkening.

The clock struck two in the morning.

Finn’s head drooped with exhaustion. "Uncle, should I take you home?"

"No rush." Dominic remained seated, unmoving.

Half an hour later, he suddenly stood and walked to the door.

Finn jolted awake, only to see the man pause at the threshold before turning back.

"I’m staying the night."

"What?" Finn’s eyes widened. "Mentor will kill me!"

"Go to bed." Dominic’s tone brooked no argument.

Finn retreated upstairs, glancing back every few steps. Before disappearing, he called out, "Uncle, make sure you leave before dawn!"

Outside the villa, Ethan’s Maybach had been parked all night.

A long column of ash clung to the cigarette between his fingers. The ember glowed red in the darkness.

The front door remained shut.

The man hadn’t left.

Ethan crushed the cigarette and pulled out his keys—but the lock wouldn’t turn.

She changed the locks for him?

His bloodshot eyes reflected in the car window.

What could a man and woman alone in a house possibly do? Vivian never lacked suitors. A kid like Finn was no threat, and men like Lucas Lefèvre or Ryan Fairsprene weren’t even on her radar.

But this man who appeared out of nowhere...

Ethan slammed his fist against the steering wheel.

She’s just trying to provoke me. He told himself that, but the jealousy churning in his chest refused to be ignored.
###Chapter 317

The first light of dawn filtered through the curtains as Vivian Laurent descended the stairs, massaging her temples.

Her steps faltered when she spotted the figure on the living room sofa.

"Rainier Valence?" She frowned at the tall, lean man.

Dominic Atlante opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and alert—nothing like someone who had just woken up.

"Worked late on documents last night. Thought I'd crash here." He adjusted his shirt collar. "You're not going to kick me out, are you, Dr. Laurent?"

Vivian's eyes flicked to the medical file spread open on the coffee table. She scoffed.

"Don't make it a habit."

Grabbing her bag, she turned to leave.

"Let me drive you." Dominic was already reaching for his car keys.

"No need." She pushed open the door—and froze.

A black Maybach sat beneath the plane tree, its window half-lowered to reveal Ethan Roscente's chiseled profile.

"Seems the CEO has too much free time." Dominic suddenly leaned close, his fingers brushing a stray leaf from her hair.

The Maybach's door flung open.

Without a backward glance, Vivian slid into her own car.

As the engine roared to life, the two men locked eyes across the distance.

Dominic's lips curved into a mocking smile.

Ethan strode forward, the sharp crease of his suit pants cutting through the morning air.

"Quite the leisurely morning, Mr. Atlante."

"Not as dedicated as someone who keeps vigil all night." Dominic leaned against the doorframe. "Though... I imagine the divorce papers are still warm?"

Ethan's knuckles cracked.

"Stay away from her."

"That's my line." Dominic lowered his voice. "After all... she's my attending physician now."

A blizzard raged in Ethan's eyes.

Then he smiled, reaching out to straighten Dominic's crooked tie.

"Still cleaning up your family's mess, I see."

Dominic's expression darkened.

"Three days." Ethan turned away, tossing the words over his shoulder. "Disappear from her sight."

The Maybach tore down the street, crushing plane leaves beneath its tires.

Dominic watched it vanish, slowly shredding the medical report in his hands.

In the hospital corridor, Vivian reviewed a patient's chart.

"Dr. Laurent!" A nurse hurried over. "A Mr. Atlante says he was referred by you—"

She looked up to see Dominic standing at the doorway, a bouquet of lilies in his arms.

At the far end of the hall, Ethan's figure disappeared into the emergency stairwell.
###Chapter 318

Ethan Roscente dialed Simon Eisner's number, his voice icy. "What's Integrity Group been up to lately? I recall they're trying to go legit. Stir up some trouble for them. Make Dominic Atlante crawl back to his turf."

He immediately called Patrick Alpinus next.

The line connected instantly. "Hey, Ethan."

"Are you Interpol agents just for show? Integrity Group's been pulling shady deals left and right, and you still haven't nailed them?"

"Who pissed in your coffee this morning? Dominic covers his tracks. We can't arrest him without evidence."

"He's in Country C right now. I know you have ways to make him leave. Immediately."

Patrick caught the edge in his voice. "What did he do to you? You two usually stay out of each other's way."

"I don't like his face." Ethan's tone was clipped.

"Fine. I'll handle it."

Dominic had just returned to his villa when his subordinate called. "Boss, Interpol's on our tail again. When are you coming back?"

"No rush. Let them investigate."

"Also, one of our branches just got hit. No idea who's behind it."

Dominic smirked. "Just a branch. Write it off."

"Boss, they're coming at us hard. You should return soon."

"I know what I'm doing."

Vivian Laurent spent the entire morning tending to two critical patients.

Cases other doctors had given up on, she found solutions for.

She hadn't eaten since leaving home that morning. By 3 PM, dizziness from hunger clouded her vision.

As she finally looked for food, a nurse rushed over. "Dr. Laurent, a patient has been waiting in your office. Insists on seeing only you."

"Can't Dr. Clementson take it?"

"No. He refuses anyone but you."

Vivian sighed, not even pausing for water before heading to her office.

She stopped mid-sentence upon opening the door. "Ethan Roscente, what are you doing here again?"

"Seeking medical attention." His eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion lining his face. "Heard you hadn't eaten all day. Brought you food."

A gourmet meal box sat on her desk, its aroma tantalizing.

Her stomach betrayed her with a growl.

"Are you here as a patient or to cause trouble?"

"Yesterday, you told me to see a doctor if I'm sick." His gaze burned into her. "Right now, I'm your patient."

Suppressing her hunger, Vivian sat. "What are your symptoms?"

"My heart." He pressed a hand to his chest. "It feels... congested."

She tapped the desk. "Cardiac issues go to Cardiology. This is General Surgery."
###Chapter 319

"Only Dr. Laurent can cure me."

Ethan Roscente stared at Vivian with terrifying intensity. His tormenting symptoms only eased slightly when he saw her.

"If you're faking illness, I'll call security." Vivian frowned, finding this man utterly unreasonable.

Yet Ethan did look terrible. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, bloodshot veins webbed across the whites. His entire body was wound tight as a bowstring. Vivian considered prescribing him a sleeping pill.

Perhaps a good rest would clear his mind.

"Do you know who that man was last night?" Ethan suddenly asked.

Without waiting for her answer, he continued, "Dominic Atlante, leader of the largest North American syndicate. His hands are stained with more blood than you've ever seen. He must have ulterior motives for approaching you."

"I know. The Integrity Group boss." Vivian didn't even look up. "What exactly do I have worth scheming for? Money or my body?"

Dominic: "..."

"Financially, he's as wealthy as I am. As for my body..." Vivian finally lifted her gaze, lips curling in mockery. "We're adults. Why can't we enjoy ourselves? Besides, his muscles are so well-defined..."

"I told you to come to me!" Ethan interrupted sharply, voice rising. "I'm better looking with an equally good physique. Why must you—"

Vivian blinked at his sudden outburst.

She massaged her temples. "You need a neurologist. Ex-husband, we should maintain distance."

"Because of him?" Ethan's eyes darkened. "You're drawing lines since he appeared?"

"It's unrelated." Vivian tapped the desk impatiently. "Are you here for treatment or not? If not, leave."

"I am." Ethan immediately softened. He'd waited so long just to see her a little longer.

"Give me your wrist." Vivian pressed her fingers to his pulse.

Ethan couldn't resist asking, "Did he stay at your place last night? Is he coming again tonight?"

"Don't speak during examination!"

He stayed silent for two seconds before fidgeting. Vivian shot him a warning glare. "One more word and you're out."

The man instantly quieted, obedient as a scolded large dog.

The results came quickly. Ethan was physically fine—just severely sleep-deprived.

"Take this." Vivian prescribed only one sleeping pill.

Ethan returned promptly. "Now?"

"Yes. Water's over there."

He swallowed the pill obediently, then pushed forward an insulated lunchbox. "The food will get cold. Don't waste it."

Vivian was indeed hungry. She accepted the chopsticks and began eating.

Ethan stood nearby watching her eat, his lips unconsciously curving upward.

As the medication took effect, his eyelids grew heavy.

"There's a sofa." Vivian said without looking up.

Ethan staggered over and collapsed onto the couch, instantly falling asleep.

Vivian set down her utensils, gazing at the sleeping man with a soft sigh. "What exactly goes through that mind of yours?"

Staying awake all night outside her door, consumed by such irrational jealousy.
###Chapter 320

Vivian Laurent slipped sleeping pills into Ethan Roscente's water.

She sighed softly as she watched the exhausted man drift into sleep.

The office was silent except for the rhythmic tapping of keyboard keys.

When Ethan woke, city lights already glittered outside the window.

Rubbing his temples, he realized he'd slept the entire afternoon in Vivian's office.

Her coat still lay draped over the sofa beside him.

He strode into the hallway where only Ryan Fairsprene remained on duty.

"Where's Dr. Laurent?" Ethan's voice was rough with sleep.

Ryan looked up. "She left at six."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

She'd abandoned him here alone.

His car sped toward Vivian's apartment, but the windows were dark.

Dominic Atlante was nowhere to be seen either.

...

Vincent Valrose intercepted Vivian at the hospital's back entrance.

Deep wrinkles creased his eyes, his suit rumpled.

"Vivi." He forced a paternal smile.

Her fingers tightened around her bag strap.

"I made your favorite sweet and sour ribs." Vincent took a step closer. "Come home for dinner."

Vivian's laugh was icy. "You forgot I'm allergic to seafood."

Vincent's face stiffened.

"Bring Mr. Roscente along?" he ventured.

Vivian's lips curved. "Sure."

His eyes lit up.

"But..." She adjusted her cuff with deliberate slowness. "Do you really think Ethan would spare you a glance?"

The smile froze on Vincent's face.

"We eat now or never." She checked her watch. "Your choice."

Vincent hurried after her. "My car's right ahead."

Vivian stared at his hunched back, her gaze glacial.

This so-called father didn't even know she hated ribs.
###Chapter 321

Vincent Valrose suppressed the disgust churning in his chest, forcing a fake smile onto his face.

"Vivian, let's not dwell on the past. Didn't you promise to come back for dinner? Let's go inside."

He didn't dare say more, afraid he might lose control of his emotions.

Ever since the Valrose Group was crushed by Ethan Roscente and forced to compensate Vivian for half the losses on her construction site, the entire Valrose family had fallen into crisis.

The threat of a broken capital chain had left Vincent scrambling. That was when he remembered the daughter he'd abandoned years ago.

A quick online search shocked him—Vivian had become the renowned Dr. Luna.

When had this exiled daughter of his studied medicine?

Vivian entered the villa without expression.

Natalie Valrose stood in the foyer, venom flashing in her eyes as her nails dug into her palms.

Vivian paused at the threshold, surveying the home she hadn't seen in years.

She hadn't stepped foot here since Natalie drugged and framed her four years ago.

During her exile to the countryside, she'd been erased from the Valrose family registry.

Memories of her mother's laughter still echoed in her ears.

This villa had been bought by her mother. The company had been founded by her mother. Yet everything had ended up in Vincent's hands.

The cruelest irony? Before her mother's body was even cold, Vincent had rushed to move his mistress Pearl Valrose and their love child Natalie into the house.

......

"What's wrong? Not happy to see me?" Vivian smirked at Natalie.

Vincent quickly intervened. "Natalie, aren't you going to welcome your sister inside? It's been so long."

Natalie snorted and turned away.

"Seems I'm not wanted here." Vivian made to leave.

"Stop!" Vincent barked. "Natalie, get back here!"

"Who wants her here anyway?" Natalie spat through gritted teeth.

Vivian's smile brightened. "I love seeing you hate me so much yet being powerless to do anything about it."

She turned to Vincent. "Isn't that right, Father? After all, I'm the honored guest you personally invited."

Vincent nodded eagerly, ushering Vivian inside with obsequious gestures.

Natalie stared at Vivian's retreating back, flames of fury burning in her eyes.

In the living room, Pearl Valrose sat with aristocratic poise, coldly assessing Vivian.

How dare this bitch—who ruined her daughter's wedding, stole their projects, and nearly bankrupted the Valrose Group—show her face here?

Tonight, she would make Vivian pay for every wrong she'd done to her daughter.
###Chapter 322

Vivian Laurent had barely stepped through the Valrose family's front door when Pearl Valrose's shrill voice cut through the air. "Stop right there!"

The woman eyed Vivian with undisguised disgust before snapping her fingers. "Maggie!"

A middle-aged housekeeper hurried over. "Yes, madam?"

"Fetch the disinfectant spray immediately. We can't have any filthy germs contaminating this house." Pearl's glare could have sliced through steel.

Maggie returned moments later with a spray bottle. Pearl pointed imperiously. "Spray her down."

"But..." The housekeeper hesitated, remembering the master's instructions about tonight's important guest.

Vincent Valrose attempted to mediate. "Pearl, what are you doing?"

Vivian calmly took the bottle from Maggie's hands. "I'll handle this myself."

Before Pearl could react, Vivian strode forward and unleashed a torrent of disinfectant directly at her face.

Pearl shrieked, stumbling backward as the liquid drenched her designer dress. "How dare—"

Another spray cut off her words, sending her into a coughing fit.

"Just disinfecting," Vivian said, shaking the nearly empty bottle. "Some viruses require special attention."

Pearl fled toward the bathroom, too spluttering to manage her usual stream of insults.

Vincent offered an awkward smile. "Your stepmother means well. She's always concerned about your wellbeing..."

Vivian's lips curled. That woman's expression had been pure murder.

"Viv, Pearl often asks about you," Vincent continued with false warmth. "Why not move back home?"

He'd expected polite refusal. Instead, Vivian nodded. "Excellent idea. Which room is mine?"

"Natalie!" The younger Valrose daughter practically vibrated with panic, terrified Vivian might claim her bedroom.

Vincent shot his daughter a warning look before turning back to Vivian. "Take your pick."

Vivian's gaze flickered between them before landing on Vincent. "The master suite appeals to me."

Vincent's smile froze.

Natalie exhaled in relief—as long as her own room remained untouched.
###Chapter 323

Vincent Valrose's face darkened. After a long silence, he finally spoke. "Vivian, I've lived in this room for years. Since when does a father give up his bedroom for his daughter?"

"Does longevity grant you immunity?" Vivian Laurent stroked her chin. "If the court comes to seize this property someday, will you refuse to leave too?"

Her casual remark made Vincent envision the worst-case scenario - the Roscente Group crushing Valrose Realty, his family being evicted from their mansion.

Now that Vivian's status had changed, her words carried imperial weight.

"Let's discuss this reasonably," Vincent immediately backtracked. "I'll have the master bedroom prepared for you. We'll move to the guest room."

He turned and ordered Maggie Flores to start packing.

Pearl Valrose emerged from adjusting her clothes and gasped at the scene. "What are you doing?"

The maid explained, "Madam, Mr. Valrose instructed us to vacate the master bedroom for Miss Vivian."

Pearl's eyes widened. Had Vincent lost his mind?

"Vincent, you're giving our room to an outsider?"

Vivian fanned the flames. "So I'm an outsider now? I'll take my leave then. Though this mansion holds such fond memories. Perhaps I'll bring some investigators to audit the books next time. Who knows what shady contracts they might uncover?"

Vincent immediately snapped at Pearl. "Foolish woman! Step aside!"

He turned back to the servants. "Hurry up!"

A satisfied smile curled Vivian's lips. "Weren't we having dinner? Where is it?"

"This way, please." Vincent practically bowed as he led her, treating Vivian like royalty.

The irony was palpable. The same man who'd once thrown Vivian out now welcomed her back with open arms.

Pearl trembled with rage. Vivian's return had brought nothing but chaos.

As Vivian walked past, Pearl slyly stuck out her foot to trip her.

But Vivian anticipated the move and stomped hard on Pearl's foot.

"Ah!" Pearl shrieked in pain.

Vivian smirked. "My apologies for not watching my step. Though I must ask - why is your foot stretched so far out? Trying to trip me?"

Vincent had warned Pearl not to cause trouble. Vivian was now their golden goose, her status completely transformed.

Fearing further outbursts, Vincent barked, "Escort Madam to her room. She won't be joining us for dinner."

Pearl exploded. "Have you gone mad, Vincent? You'd treat me like this for that little bitch? No wonder she's so ill-mannered - her mother died too young to teach her better!"
###Chapter 324

Pearl Valrose's chest heaved violently. Rage threatened to consume her rationality.

Who did Vivian Laurent think she was? How dare she act so arrogantly in her presence?

That face—an exact replica of her dead mother—made Pearl sick. The memory of that woman stealing Vincent Valrose resurfaced. If not for Pearl's meticulous scheming, the title of Mrs. Valrose would never have been hers.

"Bastard child of a whore!" Pearl shrieked, her carefully maintained face contorting grotesquely.

Vivian's eyes turned glacial. The smile on her lips froze instantly.

"Stay." Her quiet command brought silence to the entire living room.

"Shouldn't guests be offered tea after such a long visit?"

Pearl blinked, then curled her lips into a vicious smirk. She signaled a servant, emphasizing "scalding hot tea."

Steaming liquid soon arrived in a cup, white vapor curling from its surface.

Vivian accepted the teacup. With a flick of her wrist—

"Ahhh!" Pearl screamed, clutching her face as boiling water cascaded down her neck.

"Since your mouth is so filthy, perhaps boiling water will cleanse it." Vivian coldly observed her disheveled state. "A mistress who climbed into bed for status dares lecture others on manners?"

Pearl's meticulously styled hair clung to her face in wet strands. Her makeup had melted into a grotesque mask.

"Vivian! I'll kill you!" She lunged with hysterical fury, nails aimed at Vivian's face.

Vivian effortlessly caught her wrist. A sharp twist.

Pearl crashed onto the sofa, her expensive silk cheongsam crumpling beneath her.

"Try touching me again?" Vivian looked down at her with disdain. "First learn how to be a competent mistress properly."

Pearl's face had swollen red. The searing pain sent her into panic.

"Take me to the hospital! Now!" She clawed at her daughter's arm. "My face can't be ruined!"

Natalie Valrose scrambled to help her mother up, shooting Vivian a venomous glare before leaving.

Vivian remained standing, calmly adjusting her cuffs as if she'd merely swatted away an annoying fly.
###Chapter 325

Vincent Valrose rubbed his hands together with an ingratiating smile. "Vivian, you've already taught Pearl a lesson and got your room back. Surely you're satisfied now?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Do you think so?"

"I'll do anything to make you happy," Vincent lowered his voice. "Just put in a good word for me with Mr. Roscente."

"Tell him I follow your every command. We must invite him for dinner soon."

Vivian nearly laughed aloud. His wife lay battered in the hospital, yet all he cared about was currying favor with Ethan Roscente.

"You're mistaken. Ethan and I aren't acquainted. Feel free to verify that yourself."

"Impossible!" Vincent insisted. "The way he defended you last time—you must be close!"

He still didn't know Vivian was Ethan's ex-wife. The Roscente family had sealed those records tightly.

"Your imagination runs wild," Vivian scoffed. "Ethan Roscente, interested in me? Your schemes are misguided. I've lost my appetite for this dinner. Excuse me."

As she stepped through the Valrose estate gates, an involuntary smile curved her lips.

She'd intended to ignore the Valrose family, but they'd insisted on provoking her.

Natalie and Pearl's clumsy schemes had been child's play to dismantle.

Tonight, she'd sleep soundly. As for the Valrose household? They'd likely spend the night tossing and turning. The thought lightened her steps.

......

In the hospital ER, Pearl moaned in pain.

The doctor's diagnosis required hospitalization—her facial and foot injuries wouldn't heal quickly.

This meant hiding at home, unable to show her face in public.

"That little bitch!" Pearl shrieked. "I should've strangled her when she was five!"

Regret gnawed at her. Showing mercy to Vivian years ago had created this monster.

"If not for my money, she'd have starved in that backwater village! Ungrateful wretch!"

"A dog knows to wag its tail! Who does she think she is? This is the Valrose family—she has no right!"

Pearl's face twisted with rage. She'd meant to teach Vivian a lesson tonight, yet found herself hospitalized instead.

Natalie fanned the flames. "You're right, Mother! Since her return, my engagement collapsed, projects failed, and I've been humiliated!"

"Now even Father obeys her. She clearly wants to seize our inheritance and drive us out!"
###Chapter 326

Natalie's eyes reddened as her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse. "Mom, she's definitely after the family fortune."

Pearl's nails dug into her palms, a flash of venom in her eyes. "Don't worry, sweetheart. That bitch Vivian won't set foot in this house as long as I'm alive."

The next morning, Pearl froze in the doorway of her bedroom. The master suite had been stripped bare—even her skincare products were gone from the vanity.

"Have you lost your mind, Vincent?" She stormed into the living room, her voice shrill. "You're choosing that bastard child over your own wife?"

Vincent looked up from his documents, his expression dark. "You have no idea what's at stake. Vivian is now a VIP guest of the Roscente Group. Offending her means offending Ethan Roscente himself!"

"After all my efforts to bring her back yesterday, you ruined everything!"

He slammed the files onto the glass coffee table with a sharp crack.

Pearl staggered back, her face pale with shock. "You—you're yelling at me? What happened to all your promises when you proposed?"

"Shut up!" Vincent tore at his tie, his patience gone. "Look at yourself. All you've done these years is spend money on useless luxuries!"

He grabbed his suit jacket. "The company's cash flow is collapsing, and you're still shopping like there's no tomorrow. Get out!"

The front door slammed shut behind him. Pearl stood motionless, her meticulously maintained face contorted with rage.

Her trembling fingers touched her cheeks. At fifty, she spent seven figures annually on anti-aging treatments. Everyone praised her for looking decades younger.

"Vivian..." She spat the name through clenched teeth, her nails leaving white scratches on the leather sofa.

That bitch must have poisoned Vincent against her!

Late that night, Vivian emerged from the shower to find Ethan's unread message glowing on her phone. She dismissed the notification and slipped into bed.

The next morning, the aroma of coffee filled the apartment.

Dominic Atlante sat in the living room, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, flipping through a financial magazine. He glanced up with a faint smile. "Good morning, Ms. Laurent."

Vivian arched a brow toward the kitchen. Finn peeked out, holding a plate of scrambled eggs. "Master! I'm taking my uncle on a tour of the city today. Wanna join?"

Her gaze flicked to the front door—the lock had clearly been picked again.
###Chapter 327 

"No." Vivian's refusal was firm.

She knew the capital like the back of her hand. She didn't need a tour guide.

"Come with us, Master. You're free anyway," her apprentice persisted.

"I said no." Vivian remained unmoved.

Finn's eyes gleamed cunningly. "But Uncle Dominic is returning to Riverdale tomorrow. He wants to see the sights one last time."

"Mr. Atlante is leaving?" Vivian's voice noticeably brightened.

Dominic rose slowly. "Miss Laurent seems eager for my departure?"

"Not at all." She couldn't even bother with polite lies. "You must have pressing business to attend to."

Having this notorious crime boss loitering at her place had become neighborhood gossip.

"I'll leave right after our tour if you accompany me," Dominic said smoothly. "Otherwise, I might extend my stay indefinitely."

"Let's go! Right now!" Vivian grabbed her jacket. "Where would you like to visit?"

She practically wanted to shove him onto the nearest flight.

Dominic's lips twitched at her eagerness. Did she despise him that much?

"I'm unfamiliar with the capital. You decide."

"Leave it to me."

The city had no shortage of historical sites. A few landmarks would suffice to satisfy him.

"Aren't you going to explain this architecture?" Dominic gestured at the ancient building.

"I'm no expert." Vivian pulled out her phone. "Shall I find you a professional guide?"

"No need." His gaze held hidden meaning. "We're short on time today. I'll trouble you again tomorrow."

...

Ethan received the news swiftly.

His face darkened, the pen in his hand creaking under his grip.

What spell had that Atlante cast on Vivian? He'd warned her about the man's ill intentions, yet she'd ignored him completely.

First private dinners, then allowing him into her home, and now sightseeing together. What infuriated him most was Vivian's warm smiles for that criminal while treating him with icy indifference.

Ethan yanked his tie loose and dialed Felix.

At the bar, Felix eyed the half-empty bottle before them. "Not much fun drinking alone, Roscente. Want some company?"

"Get your own." Ethan downed his whiskey in one gulp.

"Where's the fun in that?" Felix studied his friend's stormy expression. "Who pissed you off?"

Ethan remained silent, opening another bottle.
###Chapter 328

Ethan Roscente set down his glass with an impassive expression.

Felix Valdemar saw right through his facade.

"Are you really fine?" Felix probed. "This isn't about Dr. Laurent, is it?"

Ethan downed another shot in silence.

"If you can't let her go, then go win her back," Felix advised. "Dr. Laurent is in high demand now. If you wait any longer, it'll be too late."

"I don't regret it," Ethan murmured.

The divorce had been a calculated decision. He'd rather see Vivian flourish in her medical career than remain trapped as Mrs. Roscente.

Felix shook his head inwardly. Ethan might as well have the word "regret" carved on his forehead.

If it were him, he would've been consumed by remorse long ago. A wife like that—brilliant, graceful, and accomplished—who in their right mind would let her go?

"Then why are you drowning yourself in alcohol?"

"I'm celebrating," Ethan said, refilling his glass.

"If you're celebrating, then stop drinking." Felix grabbed the bottle. "I'm not carrying a drunkard home tonight."

The words struck a chord in Ethan.

A glint flashed in his eyes as he threw back the drink in one swift motion.

"Have you lost your mind?" Felix exclaimed. "Your stomach is weak. Have you forgotten who treated you all those years ago?"

The memory brought Felix to a sudden realization.

Back then, doctors had declared Ethan would never walk again—only Vivian had insisted he would recover. It hadn't been empty reassurance, but a professional diagnosis.

"You're not trying to drink yourself into the hospital just to get an appointment with Dr. Laurent, are you?"

Ethan didn't answer. He was gambling—betting that Vivian would come for an old friend who'd had too much to drink.

The liquor burned his stomach, but it couldn't extinguish the stubborn ache in his chest.

He had never missed someone this much.

Every person around Vivian filled him with unbearable jealousy. Why did they get to laugh and talk with her while he couldn't even approach her?

The way she looked at him—always guarded, as if he were some kind of monster—only deepened his frustration.

He poured another shot.

Empty bottles piled up on the table.

When Ethan finally slumped over, Felix sighed in relief. "Should I take you home?"

Suddenly, Ethan grabbed his wrist and shoved a phone into his hand.

"Call Vivian."
###Chapter 329

Ethan Roscente gripped his phone, finger hovering over the call button but never pressing it.

"What are you waiting for?" His voice was slurred with alcohol.

"Ethan, what should I say?"

"Tell her I'm drunk and need a ride home."

Felix Valdemar dialed the number, anxiously watching the screen. Would Dr. Vivian Laurent answer?

Vivian had just finished her date with Dominic Atlante and was reviewing work documents from Isabella Langley. When her phone buzzed with Ethan's name, she rejected the call without hesitation.

"Ethan, she hung up..." Felix said cautiously.

Ethan's eyes darkened instantly. He downed another glass of whiskey and slammed it onto the table.

"Call again."

When the second call came, Vivian frowned. She swiped to answer. "Hello?"

"Dr. Laurent! It's Felix!" He exhaled in relief. "Ethan's wasted. Could you—"

"I'm busy." She cut him off.

"It won't take long! He has no one to take him home—"

"Aren't you there?" she countered.

Felix blurted out, "I'm drunk too! I sent you the address. Please!" He hung up before she could refuse and immediately shared his location.

Ethan stared at the closed VIP room door. As minutes ticked by, his expression grew colder.

At 2 AM, Felix tentatively asked, "Should I drive you?"

"Wait longer."

Another hour passed. Ethan suddenly stood, his jacket knocking over empty bottles.

"Let's go."

"You're giving up?"

"She's not coming." His voice was rough. He staggered toward the exit, forcing Felix to steady him.

Meanwhile, Vivian finally shut her laptop. She checked the time—3 AM.

The phone call replayed in her mind. Ethan must've gotten home by now. With his status, there were endless people lining up to chauffeur him. Why wait for her?
###Chapter 330

Vivian tapped her fingers lightly on the steering wheel.

Ethan's stubbornness meant he might actually stand outside the club all night.

She pressed the accelerator, heading toward the address Felix had sent.

At the club entrance, Felix was struggling to support a swaying Ethan.

"Easy there, boss." Beads of sweat formed on Felix's forehead.

The sharp click of heels echoed behind them.

"Felix? Ethan?"

Felix turned to see a woman in a white dress approaching gracefully.

"Sophia Sherwood?" His eyebrows shot up in surprise.

The woman's red lips curved. "I'm touched you remember me."

"Who could forget the prom queen?" Felix chuckled. "Half the guys in school were after you. You were our campus goddess."

Sophia's gaze lingered on Ethan, her eyes softening.

Ethan frowned and muttered to Felix, "Let's go."

Felix nodded. "We should get Ethan home. We'll catch up another time."

"You shouldn't drive after drinking." Sophia stepped closer. "Let me take you."

Her heavy perfume made Ethan turn his head away.

"No need. Our driver's waiting outside," Felix declined politely.

Sophia had already grasped Ethan's arm. "Don't be shy. We're old friends."

Ethan suddenly doubled over, retching.

"Whoa, easy there!" Felix exclaimed dramatically. "That's an expensive dress, Sophia."

Sophia instinctively stepped back.

Ethan seized the moment to shake off her hold, leaning heavily on Felix instead.

"See how drunk he is?" Felix gave an awkward laugh. "Maybe another time?"

Before Sophia could respond, Felix was already half-carrying Ethan toward the parking lot.

The night breeze seemed to sober Ethan slightly.

"Annoying," he spat coldly.

Felix sighed. "You brought this on yourself, Mr. Popular."

Ethan opened his mouth to retort when a familiar car pulled up nearby.

The door opened, and Vivian stepped out.
###Chapter 331

Sophia Sherwood gave a slight nod. "Alright, you take him to the car first."

"Got it." Felix Valdemar responded briskly.

He helped Ethan Roscente back into the car before turning to walk away. Ethan reached out from inside the vehicle, but his hand closed on empty air.

Under the glow of the streetlamp, Sophia stood with a faint smile. The light cast a soft halo around her, accentuating her delicate features.

Yet Felix couldn't help comparing her to Vivian Laurent. Vivian still outshone her.

"What did you want to talk about, goddess?"

The nickname had stuck since high school. Sophia seemed to relish it, her lips curving in satisfaction every time she heard it.

"Why did Ethan drink so much?" She glanced at the black sedan, her tone intimate.

"Just one of his moods." Felix shrugged. "Think of it as a man's monthly episode."

Sophia covered her mouth with a light laugh. "You always know what to say."

"You thought that back then too?"

"Of course." A flicker of nostalgia passed through her eyes. "You and Ethan were the most unique in our class. He was cold to everyone except you. I used to think—"

"Stop right there!" Felix waved his hands. "Pure brotherhood. Straight as an arrow."

Sophia chuckled. "Just teasing. Does he... have a girlfriend now?"

Her question sounded casual, but she'd been dwelling on the tabloid rumors linking Ethan to a certain actress.

"Currently single."

Her eyes brightened.

"But freshly divorced," Felix added.

"Divorced?" Her smile froze. The answer blindsided her.

Ethan had been married?

The revelation hit like a bucket of ice water.

"Absolutely true." Felix nodded.

Sophia dug her nails into her palm. Getting married at twenty-eight wasn't unusual, but what mattered was that he was single again.

She began plotting her return strategy—joining Roscente Group, slowly closing the distance between them. With her current charm, she refused to believe she couldn't win him over.

"What was his ex-wife like?" Her voice tightened.

What kind of woman could capture Ethan's heart?

Felix thought of Vivian and hesitated. Her brilliance defied simple description.

"That... you should ask Ethan yourself." Sensing piercing eyes on his back, he quickly excused himself. "I should get him home. Let's catch up another time."

Sophia hurriedly said, "Give me your contact info. I'll be staying in the country for a while."

She pulled out her phone, its screen glowing coldly in the night.
###Chapter 332

Felix pulled out his phone with a grin.

"Next round's on me."

He quickened his pace to catch up with Ethan and slid into the backseat.

Ethan massaged his temples.

"That took a while."

"Come on, Roscente. You were pretending to be drunk just to ask about her, weren't you?" Felix nudged him with his shoulder.

Ethan leaned back, eyes closed.

"Not interested."

"Then why ask?"

"A warning." Ethan opened his eyes.

"Sophia Sherwood has high standards."

Felix choked on his words.

He muttered, "Just got her number for drinks. That's all."

"But damn, she's still stunning. Probably single, right? Think I—"

The engine roared to life, cutting him off.

The car stopped in front of an unfamiliar villa. Felix blinked.

"Where is this? You moved?"

"Marital home." Ethan tossed the words over his shoulder as he strode inside.

Felix froze.

The driver whispered, "Miss Laurent used to live here. Mr. Roscente just repurchased it."

Felix sucked in a sharp breath.

Outside the club, Sophia clenched her purse strap.

"Seen enough?"

A man stepped from the shadows, cigarette dangling from his lips.

Sophia whirled around.

"Victor Roscente—he was married?"

Victor exhaled a slow stream of smoke.

"Divorced."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Does it matter?" He flicked ash from his cigarette.

"The Marketing Director position is yours now."

He took a step closer.

"Remember—I can put you there, and I can take you down."

The cigarette glowed in the dark.
###Chapter 333

Sophia Sherwood stood at the entrance of the clubhouse, her fingers absently tracing the edges of her clutch.

She remembered the year they graduated high school when rumors about Roscente Group's impending bankruptcy spread like wildfire.

Without hesitation, she had chosen to study abroad, planning to return when Ethan Roscente hit rock bottom—to become his savior.

When news broke of Ethan's miraculous turnaround, she felt a pang of regret for missing her chance to help him in his darkest hour.

Yet she still took pride in his success.

The year she graduated college, news of Ethan's car accident made her hesitate again.

She refused to waste her youth on a disabled man and remained overseas.

Only months ago, upon hearing of Ethan's recovery and return, did hope rekindle in her heart.

Victor Roscente's appearance was perfectly timed.

He promised to help her get close to Ethan—in exchange for stealing Roscente Group's trade secrets.

Both parties entered this partnership with ulterior motives.

Sophia was lost in thought when a black Maybach pulled up to the clubhouse entrance.

A tall woman stepped out, her hair pulled into a sleek chignon, wearing a tailored skirt suit.

Her delicate features looked meticulously sculpted, every movement exuding grace and confidence.

Sophia's grip tightened around her clutch.

She had always been confident in her beauty, but this woman made her feel threatened for the first time.

Vivian Laurent walked straight into the clubhouse without glancing around, checking her phone briefly.

When asking the attendant for the private dining room, she clearly mentioned Ethan Roscente's name.

Sophia's pupils constricted.

She stared daggers at Vivian's retreating figure, jealousy and suspicion churning inside her.

Ethan had already left—why was this woman claiming to pick him up?

"Another gold digger," Sophia sneered inwardly.

She despised women who relied on their looks to take shortcuts.

Vivian suddenly turned, meeting Sophia's hostile gaze head-on.

She frowned slightly, certain she didn't know this stranger.

"Mr. Roscente and Mr. Valdemar have already left," the attendant informed, making Vivian click her tongue in annoyance.

Clutching her car keys, she turned on her heel and left, cursing herself for meddling.

Watching Vivian walk away, a dark glint flashed in Sophia's eyes.

She pulled out her phone and swiftly photographed Vivian's license plate.
###Chapter 334

Vivian stood at the entrance of the clubhouse, her fingers absently tracing the car keys.

"Could you show me to the private dining room?"

She couldn't resist asking.

The waiter offered a professional smile. "Mr. Roscente has already left. Shall I contact him for you?"

"No need."

Her heels clicked sharply against the marble floor as she strode toward the VIP room.

The door swung open, releasing a wave of alcohol fumes. Empty bottles littered the table, and the ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts.

She exhaled in relief, yet an inexplicable emptiness lingered.

As she turned to leave, a woman caught her eye at the far end of the corridor. The stranger stared at her with venomous intensity.

"Do we know each other?" Vivian walked straight toward her.

The woman's red lips curved. "How quickly the Mrs. Roscente forgets."

Vivian had no patience for games. She turned on her heel and left. In the rearview mirror, the woman remained under the streetlight, her shadow stretching long across the pavement.

At 3:30 AM, Vivian tossed in bed. Her phone screen flickered intermittently, stubbornly devoid of notifications.

Ethan woke to sunlight stabbing his eyes.

His head throbbed from last night's drinking. Groping for the glass on the coffee table, he found it empty.

Felix's message from last night still glowed on his phone: [She didn't come]

Ethan loosened his tie with a bitter laugh. Three years should've been enough to get used to this disappointment.

As hot water dissolved the honey, he suddenly remembered Vivian always insisting on using warm water. His hand jerked, scalding drops splashing onto his skin.

In the corporate elevator, Simon hesitated. "Mr. Roscente, Director Sherwood started this morning."

"Who?"

"Ms. Sophia Sherwood." Simon lowered his voice. "She came with the board's transfer order."

The office door swung open, releasing a cloud of perfume.

Sophia leaned over the files, her body-hugging skirt accentuating every curve. Hearing the door, she turned, silver earrings glinting.

"Long time no see, Ethan."
###Chapter 335
Rule One of the Workplace

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the office.

Lin Ran stood outside the CEO's office of Roscente Group, taking a deep breath.

She raised her hand and knocked three times lightly.

"Come in."

Ethan's cool voice came from inside.

She pushed the door open to find him reviewing documents with his head lowered.

"Mr. Roscente, here are the meeting materials for today."

She placed the folder on the desk.

Ethan didn't look up. "Leave it there."

Lin Ran turned to leave.

"Wait."

He suddenly stopped her.

Setting down his pen, he lifted his gaze to meet hers.

"At the company, remember to address me as Mr. Roscente."

Her fingers tightened slightly.

"Understood, Mr. Roscente."

Her voice was soft.

Ethan studied her face for a moment.

"You may go."

Lin Ran quickly exited the office.

In the hallway, she leaned against the wall to steady her breathing.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

A message from Ethan:

"7 p.m. The usual place."

She stared at the screen for a long time.

Finally, she typed a single word in reply:

"Okay."
###Chapter 336

Ethan Roscente glanced up at Sophia Sherwood still standing in his office.

"Is there something else?"

Sophia tightened her grip on the documents, her knuckles turning white.

"Nothing. I'll get back to work."

Her heels made muffled sounds against the carpet as she walked away.

Ethan returned to the stack of files before him. To him, an additional employee just meant another desk. The Roscente Group valued performance over personal connections.

When the clock struck noon, he finally set down his pen and massaged his temples.

He wondered what Vivian Laurent was doing now. Making rounds? Seeing patients?

He picked up his phone and scrolled to the only contact saved in his favorites. After hesitating, he opened Finn Deross's social media instead.

The latest post was a candid shot. Vivian walked alongside Dominic Atlante on a scenic trail, dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves onto them.

Ethan's pupils constricted sharply.

Meeting again? Where are they off to this time?

He stared at the photo for three full minutes until his knuckles turned white. Why hadn't that nuisance Dominic returned to the States yet?

"Mr. Roscente?" Simon Eisner knocked three times before entering. "Your lunch."

"Leave it there."

"The shareholder meeting is at two. Then the project team at four."

Ethan flipped his phone face down, as if that could erase the image from his mind.

......

Vivian leaned against the scenic railing, catching her breath.

"Mr. Atlante, when exactly are you returning home?"

She'd spent the last two days showing Dominic around half the city, and her legs were ready to give out.

"Tonight's flight."

At this answer, Vivian immediately straightened up, her eyes brightening.

"Then let's hurry and finish the last attraction!"

Suddenly energized, her steps became noticeably lighter.

Dominic gave her a meaningful look.

"Dr. Laurent seems quite eager for me to leave?"

"Of course not," Vivian forced a laugh. "It's just that someone as busy as you shouldn't waste too much time here."

She wouldn't dare say anything that might encourage him to stay longer.

By sunset, the trio reached their final destination. Finn ran around with his camera, insisting on taking numerous "tourist photos" of them.

Dinner was at a trendy restaurant. Finn's eyes sparkled as he scanned the menu.

"This one, this one, and this! All of them!"

"Can you really finish all that?" Vivian eyed the two full pages of selections.

Finn patted his chest confidently. "No problem! I've got a huge appetite! If there's leftovers, we'll take them back for midnight snacks. No waste!"
###Chapter 337

The dinner ended in silence.

Dominic Atlante glanced at his wristwatch and straightened his suit sleeves. "Aren't you going to see me off, Vivian?"

Vivian Laurent didn't look up from her phone. "Finn can do it."

"Thank you for your hospitality these days." Dominic pulled out a gold-embossed business card. "Call me if you need anything."

Vivian glanced at the card and smirked. "I doubt I'll need it."

Dominic leaned closer. "For example... pretending to be your boyfriend? I believe my status qualifies."

"How thoughtful." Vivian tossed the card onto the coffee table.

Finn Deross eagerly grabbed Dominic's luggage. "Uncle, come visit again soon!"

Dominic narrowed his eyes. "Will you miss me?"

"Of course!" Finn replied instantly.

"Then I'll stay." Dominic pretended to set down the suitcase.

"No, no!" Finn waved his hands frantically. "The company needs you! I'll... deal with my longing on my own!"

Dominic scoffed. The kid might as well set off fireworks to celebrate.

"Report Vivian's daily schedule to me," he whispered.

Finn's eyes widened. "Why?"

"To make sure you don't get sold off." Dominic glanced toward the living room.

Finn puffed out his chest. "My mentor would never!"

Dominic frowned. His nephew was hopelessly devoted.

"Either report, or come back to the company with me," he threatened.

The thought of working under his uncle made Finn shudder. "I'll report every day!"

"Uncle, hurry!" Finn pushed the suitcase toward the door. "You'll miss your flight!"

He would never know who his uncle truly cared about.

Ethan Roscente stood in the empty living room.

Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting cold shadows. For the first time, he noticed how silent the mansion was—so quiet he could hear his own heartbeat.

The wine cellar door slammed open.

Ethan strode to the deepest shelf and grabbed a bottle of whiskey. The sound of the cap twisting echoed sharply.

Amber liquid burned down his throat.

One bottle emptied. Then another.

Images flashed through his mind—Vivian smiling at Dominic, their backs side by side.

In Eudora, he'd invited her to the gala, and she'd walked away without looking back. Now she spent every day with that man...

Bang! The bottle smashed against the oak table.

Ethan stood abruptly, sending the bottle crashing to the floor.

He had to find her. Now.
###Chapter 338

The night was ink-black, the wind biting cold.

Ethan Roscente drove alone to Vivian Laurent's apartment building.

The entire complex stood dark, with only a few scattered lights still on.

He stood before her door, his hand hovering mid-air, hesitating.

His heart pounded violently, as if trying to escape his chest.

"Vivian..."

He whispered her name, the sound dissolving into the wind.

On the tenth attempt, his call finally connected.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian's voice was thick with sleep and irritation. "Do you know what time it is?"

"Three twenty-seven," he answered, staring at his watch.

Rustling sounds came through the phone as he pictured her struggling out of bed.

"Are you drunk again?" Her tone was sharp.

Ethan leaned against the cold wall, gazing up at her window.

"No."

"Then what's wrong with you?"

"I need to see you."

Silence filled the line.

He could hear her soft breathing and the sound of sheets shifting.

"You're at my door?" Her voice suddenly became alert.

"Yes."

"Go to hell."

The call ended abruptly.

Ethan stared at the darkened screen, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

This was the Vivian he knew.

He counted the seconds. In less than three minutes, the hallway lights flickered on.

The elevator's hum cut through the silent night.

When the doors opened, Vivian stood before him in fuzzy pajamas.

"Are you insane?" She glared at him.

Ethan drank in the sight of her face.

"I missed you."

Her hair was tousled, pillow creases still marking her cheek.

Arms crossed, she radiated impatience.

"Had your fill? Then get lost."

Ethan stepped forward suddenly.

Vivian instinctively retreated until her back met the door.

"What do you want?"

His gaze landed on the faint pink tingeing her earlobes.

"To confirm something."

"What?"

"If I really..." He paused. "Missed you this much."

Her lashes fluttered slightly.

"Psycho."

She turned to slam the door.

Ethan's hand shot out to stop it.

"You came looking for me at the club yesterday?"

Vivian froze.

"Who told you that?"

"Guessed." His voice softened. "Like I'm guessing now whether you'll let me in."

She gave a cold laugh.

"Wrong guess."

The door shut firmly in his face.

Ethan remained motionless.

Five minutes later, the door reopened.

Vivian threw out a blanket.

"Go be crazy somewhere else. Don't die on my doorstep."

The blanket landed at his feet.

Ethan picked it up, catching her lingering scent.

He smiled faintly.

"Goodnight, Vivian."
###Chapter 339

Ethan Roscente leaned against the doorframe.

The door suddenly swung open from inside.

Caught off guard, he stumbled backward and landed directly on Vivian Laurent.

"Ah!" Vivian gasped, instinctively reaching out to catch him.

His heavy frame made her stagger back two steps.

"Ethan Roscente!" She shoved against his chest. "You're crushing me!"

The strong scent of alcohol hit her nostrils.

She wrinkled her nose. "Have you been drinking again?"

Ethan tightened his arms around her, clinging to her warmth.

"Vivian..."

He murmured her name like a lifeline.

"Let go!" She struggled against him. "What's wrong with you, getting drunk in the middle of the night?"

Ethan didn't budge.

Just as Vivian opened her mouth to protest, his lips crashed down on hers.

The kiss was messy and tasted of whiskey.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Ethan's lips moved with reckless abandon, dominating her completely.

Vivian clenched her fists.

Her mind screamed at her to slap him.

But his iron grip held her captive.

"Mmm—" She turned her face away.

In one swift motion, Ethan scooped her up in his arms.

"Put me down!" She pounded her fists against his shoulders.

He tossed her onto the couch.

As he loomed over her, Vivian lifted her leg to kick. "Don't you dare!"

Ethan froze.

Their eyes locked.

A storm of emotions swirled in his gaze.

Vivian blinked, momentarily stunned.

Then fury took over. "What are you staring at?"

She regretted opening the door.

"Ethan Roscente," she hissed through gritted teeth, "if you ever kiss me without permission again, I'll—"

"Vivian."

He cut her off.

His voice was low and serious.

"I missed you."

Those three simple words silenced the room.
###Chapter 340

Vivian shivered as if a feather had brushed against her heart, sending strange tingles through her body.

Ethan's gaze was too complex for her to decipher.

Was that "I missed you" sincere or just drunken rambling?

His recent behavior had been so erratic that she couldn't read him at all.

"Ethan, sober up!" Vivian tried to push him away.

Had he been drowning himself in alcohol because of her?

Was this some kind of confession?

"I'm perfectly sober." His voice was hoarse. "You've been avoiding me, ignoring my calls, and dating that man. He's no good—he's lying to you..."

The urgency in his rapid words was palpable.

Vivian froze.

She had been avoiding him, but dating? Since when?

"I never—"

She bit back her words.

Why was she explaining herself?

They had no relationship to speak of.

"My life is none of your concern. Focus on your company instead!"

"If I don't interfere, you'll run off with someone else." His voice softened suddenly. "Vivian, please don't go."

The vulnerability in his tone made her heart skip.

Drunk Ethan resembled a sulky child.

"Get off me—you're crushing me!" She shoved at him.

He didn't budge, tightening his arms around her instead. "I missed you so much."

"I heard you!" Her ears burned. "You've said it a hundred times already."

Flustered, she debated calling Finn for help.

Then footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Finn, curious about the commotion, peeked over the railing.

His eyes widened at the sight of two figures tangled on the couch.

His mentor and Ethan—

He sucked in a sharp breath.

Vivian looked up abruptly. When their eyes met, Finn felt a chill crawl down his spine.

Her glare could have murdered him on the spot.

"Sorry, Mentor! I saw nothing!"

He spun around and bolted.

Cursing under his breath, he raked a hand through his hair.

No wonder Vivian always tried to shoo Ethan away—he was in the way.

Now that he'd witnessed this, should he move out?

Should he give them space?
###Chapter 341

"Finn! Stop right there!"

"Finn!"

Vivian's shouts echoed through the hallway. She had intended for Finn to drag the drunk Ethan away, but the boy had bolted like a startled rabbit.

Useless when it mattered most. What a waste of a disciple.

Finn barricaded himself in his room, locking the door securely. He thought his master was furious at him for interrupting her moment—no way he'd show his face now.

Vivian gritted her teeth. Without someone holding her back, she wasn't sure she could control her strength.

"F—"

Warm lips suddenly pressed against hers, cutting off her words. Ethan's kiss was urgent and relentless, leaving no room for protest.

The audacity of this man!

Just as Vivian was about to retaliate, Ethan abruptly pulled back. His lips hovered mere inches from hers, his heated breath fanning across her face.

"Don't say another man's name," he rasped, voice rough. "Especially not his."

Vivian's eyes widened.

What gave him the right? They weren't even—

"You never came last night when I called," Ethan murmured, his tone dipping into something vulnerable. "I waited for you... for hours."

Her heart clenched.

She had gone. He was the one who left first.

"Why should I?" She turned her face away. "You're nothing to me."

"I could be." Ethan suddenly cupped her cheeks, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Vivian, let me be yours."

Her breath hitched.

"Give me a chance." His dark eyes held only her reflection, deep and unwavering. "I'll spend my whole life treating you right. I know you hate me, but don't push me away. Please."

Vivian's pulse stuttered.

Once, she would have given anything for him to look at her like this. Yet the day after their wedding, he had vanished overseas without a word for three years.

And now he dared say such things?

"You're drunk," she forced out, feigning composure.

"I'm perfectly sober." Ethan's thumb brushed gently along her cheekbone. "Vivian... I think I'm falling for you."

His quiet admission struck her like thunder.

Finally, he understood what it meant to care—to want to see her every moment, to protect her, to share his life with her.

This realization had come far too late.

Yet it was undeniably real.
###Chapter 342

"Give me another chance."

Ethan Roscente's deep voice exploded in Vivian Laurent's ear. Her pupils constricted sharply as her fingers unconsciously clenched the hem of her shirt.

This had to be an illusion.

How could Ethan possibly love her?

"You're drunk," Vivian's voice trembled. "Look carefully. I'm Vivian, not Sophia Evans."

She instinctively stepped back until her spine pressed against the cold wall.

"I never loved Sophia." Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Those rumors were all lies."

Vivian's heart pounded violently.

She didn't believe him.

Years ago, Ethan had gotten into that car accident while chasing after Sophia. Everyone knew they'd been inseparable abroad.

"Vivian, give me another chance—"

Ethan suddenly buried his face in the crook of her neck. His scorching breath sent electric currents down her spine. He nuzzled against her like a large dog before gradually stilling.

Vivian froze.

She couldn't distinguish truth from lies with this man. Ethan was too skilled at deception.

"Ethan, you're crushing me!"

She shoved him hard, but he didn't budge. Only then did she realize Ethan had fallen asleep.

The living room glowed dimly.

His long lashes cast shadows across his face. Even in slumber, his sharp features remained devastatingly handsome.

Vivian looked away.

She fled upstairs and locked herself in the shower. The scalding water couldn't wash away the phantom sensation of Ethan's touch.

Sleep evaded her that night.

Every time she closed her eyes, she relived the heat of Ethan's embrace and those three forbidden words.

At dawn's first light, Vivian slipped out unnoticed.

She resolved to avoid Ethan Roscente at all costs.

That man was pure danger.
###Chapter 343

Ethan Roscente opened his eyes to a throbbing pain in his temples.

Squinting, he spotted a steaming glass of honey lemon water on the coffee table.

Undissolved honey crystals clung to the bottom of the glass.

He drained the glass in one gulp, the cloying sweetness coating his tongue.

This was Vivian Laurent's apartment.

Fragmented memories from last night surfaced—stumbling here drunk, vague recollections of holding her, kissing her.

Ethan checked every room but found the apartment empty.

Vivian was avoiding him again.

Footsteps sounded on the stairs.

Finn Deross descended sleepily, then froze when he met Ethan's gaze.

"M-morning," Finn stammered.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Where's that man from your social media posts with Vivian?"

"My uncle? He went back to our hometown." Finn scratched his head.

A barely perceptible smirk touched Ethan's lips.

Straightening his suit, he left for the office feeling refreshed.

His morning productivity soared.

Documents were signed in record time. Meetings concluded with crisp efficiency.

At noon, Felix Valdemar's call interrupted his workflow.

"What?" Ethan continued signing papers without looking up.

"Someone's cranky." Felix chuckled. "Free tonight? Sophia Sherwood wants to have dinner with us."

"Busy."

"Nice!" Felix cheered. "Giving me alone time with her, huh?"

Ethan hung up.

Thirty minutes later, Simon Eisner knocked. "Mr. Roscente, Marketing Director Sherwood is here."

Ethan frowned. "Send her in."

Sophia Sherwood entered in clicking heels, her skirt swaying. "Heard you're unavailable tonight. Did I do something wrong?"

"Not about you."

"I'm new back in town. You and Felix are my only old friends..." Her lips trembled pitifully.

Ethan didn't glance up. "I have plans."

"What plans? Your secretary said your schedule's clear." She pressed.

"Dinner with my wife." He closed a file.

Sophia paled. "W-wife?"

"Hmm."

"When did you get married?" Her nails dug into her palms as she forced a smile.

Ethan looked up coldly. "Since when do I report my personal life to you?"

Sophia gaped wordlessly.

"Leave if there's nothing else." Ethan pressed the intercom. "Simon, escort our guest out."

Sophia stood frozen, staring at this ice-cold man who hadn't changed since university—always indifferent to everyone.
###Chapter 344

Ethan Roscente stared at his phone screen, fingers tapping lightly on the desk.

He dialed Vivian Laurent's number for the third time. Still no answer.

"Still avoiding me," he muttered coldly, tossing the phone aside.

Vivian had just finished her meeting when she noticed three missed calls and two messages.

"Mr. Roscente wants to have dinner?" She scoffed. "Hard pass."

Her finger hovered over the block button briefly before she pulled it away.

The sudden vibration of her phone nearly made her drop it.

"Isabella?"

"Viv! Free tonight? I booked a table at that new private kitchen near your place."

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Perfect timing. I'm starving."

Thirty minutes later, Isabella's red sports car pulled up outside Valrose Realty.

"Hop in!" She rolled down the window.

The restaurant entrance was packed. Isabella circled three times before spotting an empty space.

"Watch this!" She jerked the steering wheel sharply.

A black Maybach suddenly cut in from the side.

"Think you can steal it?" Isabella floored the gas, smoothly sliding into the spot.

The Maybach screeched to a halt, narrowly avoiding a collision.

"Are you insane?" Isabella rolled down her window.

The opposing window lowered, revealing a familiar face.

"Felix Valdemar?" She arched a brow.

Felix's expression darkened. "Isabella Langley! You again!"

"Your name on this spot?" She blew out a mocking whistle. "Take the L like a man."

Just as Felix was about to snap, a soft feminine voice came from the passenger seat. "Felix, what's wrong?"

Isabella and Vivian exchanged glances, ears perking up in unison.

"Nothing." Felix forced his anger down. "We'll find another spot."

As they stepped out, Isabella whispered, "Viv, Felix actually brought a date. That's new."

They reached the entrance just as Felix escorted his companion toward them.

"Hmph!" He lifted his chin arrogantly.

Isabella ignored him completely, her gaze fixed on the woman beside him.

Thick makeup. Overpowering perfume.

Vivian narrowed her eyes—wasn't that the hostess from the nightclub?
###Chapter 345

Felix Valdemar stood at the restaurant entrance, his fingers unconsciously tightening around his suit cuff.

He hadn't expected to run into Vivian Laurent here.

Ever since learning she was Ethan Roscente's ex-wife, Felix had stopped calling her "Dr. Laurent."

But "sister-in-law" didn't feel appropriate either.

"Dr. Laurent, what a coincidence," he finally settled on.

Vivian gave a slight nod. "Here with your girlfriend?"

"No!" Felix waved his hands hastily. "This is my high school classmate, Sophia Sherwood."

Isabella Langley snorted beside them. "As if someone like him could get a girlfriend."

"Isabella!" Felix's temple throbbed visibly.

"What? Am I wrong?" Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Should I remind you about last week at the bar—"

"Sophia, let's go inside." Felix turned abruptly.

This Michelin three-star restaurant never took reservations. Even the mayor had to wait in line.

Isabella tugged Vivian along. "Come on, let's see what table they manage to snag."

Both groups reached the host stand simultaneously.

"Party of two."
"Party of two."

The hostess looked between them apologetically. "We only have one table left..."

"We'll take it," Isabella declared.

"On what grounds?" Felix glared.

"Ladies first, ever heard of it?" Isabella lifted her chin.

"That only applies to actual ladies. What makes you qualify?" Felix sneered.

Isabella's knuckles cracked audibly. "Say that again, I dare you."

"Look at yourself. What man would want you?" Felix shot back.

The hostess watched the bickering pair helplessly.

Meanwhile, Sophia Sherwood's gaze remained fixed on Vivian.

"Miss Laurent, have we met before?" She extended a hand with a sweet smile.

Vivian gave it a light shake. "Perhaps. My memory isn't the best."

Sophia's eyes lingered on the sapphire necklace at Vivian's delicate collarbone.

She recognized it instantly—a limited edition piece from Roscente Jewelry.
###Chapter 346

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the café. Sophia Sherwood stirred her latte with practiced elegance.

She glanced across the table at Vivian Laurent, her red lips curling. "I didn't expect you to know Felix Valdemar. He and I grew up together—along with Ethan Roscente."

She deliberately lingered on Ethan's name with intimate familiarity.

Vivian remained impassive, her fingers lightly tapping the table.

"Is that so."

Sophia's eyes flashed with irritation. "I heard Felix call you Dr. Laurent? Which hospital do you work at?"

"Capital General."

"What a coincidence!" Sophia brightened. "I know several specialists there. Would you like an introduction?"

She leaned in with feigned concern. "It must be tough for an intern like you to get into Capital General."

Vivian took a sip of coffee.

"Oncology Department. You're welcome to visit anytime, Ms. Sherwood."

Sophia's smile froze.

"Very funny, Dr. Laurent." She forced a laugh. "But competition in big hospitals is fierce. For someone at your level—"

Vivian cut her off. "I'm a Consultant Specialist."

"Consultant?" Sophia scoffed. "Lying isn't a good look, Doctor."

She pulled out her phone. "Perfect timing—I know Dr. Zachary Kalmien from Cardiology. Shall we ask for his opinion?"

The call connected. Sophia's voice turned saccharine. "Uncle Zachary, it's Sophia..."

Vivian watched coldly, tracing the rim of her cup.

"What? You need her credentials?" Sophia feigned surprise. "Dr. Laurent, what's your degree?"

"Unfinished." Vivian's tone was flat.

Sophia's eyes gleamed with disdain. "Uncle Zachary, she didn't even graduate—"

"I'm a Consultant Specialist at Capital General." Vivian set down her cup with a sharp clink.

Sophia's smile vanished completely.

"Impossible!" Her voice turned shrill. "Someone like you—"

Vivian stood, looking down at her. "Would you like to see my ID?"

The sunlight haloed Vivian's silhouette. Sophia suddenly found it hard to breathe.
###Chapter 347

"You must be joking." Sophia Sherwood scoffed. "Without even a college degree, how could you possibly work at Capital General? That's a top-tier hospital where the minimum requirement is a PhD."

She found Vivian Laurent's lie utterly ridiculous.

Someone like her wouldn't even get past the hospital's front gate.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "I said I was a consultant specialist. Having hearing problems, Miss Sherwood?"

A deep voice suddenly interrupted from the phone. "Wait, that voice sounds familiar."

"Is that Vivian?" Dr. Zachary Kalmien asked urgently.

Sophia's grip on her phone faltered.

She never expected the renowned cardiologist to recognize Vivian just by her voice.

What shocked her more was how familiar the medical authority sounded with Vivian.

"Hey Zach," Vivian replied casually.

Sophia's eyes widened.

She always addressed him respectfully as "Uncle Zachary," yet he remained stern and distant.

But Vivian called him "Zach"?

"Dr. Laurent, those two critical patients in my department can't wait much longer. When can you spare time to examine them? I've come to find you twice already. Must I make a third trip?"

"Don't be dramatic. Though your relative here was just offering to help me find employment, saying I'm unqualified for Capital General."

"Nonsense! What does Sophia Sherwood know? You're overqualified for my position. If not for the dean's personal request, would you even consider our hospital? Multiple departments are lining up for your expertise!"

"I've been busy lately, but I'll visit your department tomorrow."

"Promise? If you don't show, I'll have to hunt you down at your office." Dr. Kalmien sounded elated.

"Relax. By the way, I'm having dinner out. Want to join?"

"No, no, you youngsters enjoy yourselves. Put it on my tab."

"Save your pension for retirement." Vivian teased.

"Then you owe me dinner next time."

"Pick any place you want."

Their cheerful banter completely excluded Sophia.

The call ended abruptly, leaving her no chance to say goodbye.

She stared at Vivian, lips trembling. "You..."

Dr. Kalmien had treated Vivian like royalty.

How could someone without a college degree deserve such respect?

"Me?" Vivian tilted her head with an innocent smile.

Sophia had tried to flaunt her connections, only to embarrass herself.
###Chapter 348

The restaurant buzzed with tension as Felix Valdemar argued heatedly with Isabella Langley.

Their quarrel came to an abrupt halt.

Felix's attention snapped toward a commotion across the room.

"What's wrong, Sophia?" He strode over, barely stopping himself from calling her "goddess."

Isabella's piercing gaze made him inexplicably guilty.

Vivian Laurent smiled faintly. "Miss Sherwood insisted on finding me a job after learning I'm a doctor."

"What?" Felix's eyes widened.

He stared at Sophia Sherwood in disbelief.

This was the legendary Dr. Luna!

"I was just trying to help," Sophia said defensively. "How was I supposed to know she'd hide her credentials?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "I told you it wasn't necessary."

"I mentioned being a consultant specialist."

"You're the one who insisted on calling for verification."

Sophia fell silent, her nails digging into her palms.

Felix quickly intervened. "Dr. Laurent is quite accomplished."

"World-class," he added.

A flash of resentment crossed Sophia's eyes.

The waiter tactfully interrupted. "Would you like to dine together?"

"No!" Isabella and Felix shouted simultaneously.

They glared at each other.

"Copycat," Isabella sneered.

"You're the one copying me," Felix retorted.

Sophia smiled sweetly. "Why don't we all eat together?"

"Sure." Felix immediately changed his tune.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Viv, let's go."

Vivian nodded. "We'll find another place."

"Wait!" Felix suddenly had a change of heart.

Sophia's smile froze.

This wasn't how she'd imagined things unfolding.

Little did she know, the real twist was yet to come.
###Chapter 349

Vivian Laurent pulled out a black-gold card from her bag and flashed it before the waiter.

The waiter's eyes lit up instantly. He bowed respectfully. "Ms. Laurent, your private dining room is ready."

Isabella Langley linked arms with Vivian and smirked at Sophia Sherwood. "You can have the main hall seats. We prefer somewhere quieter."

Sophia's face darkened. "Wait!"

She grabbed the waiter's arm. "I was told reservations weren't allowed. Why do they get a private room?"

"This is the owner of our restaurant," the waiter explained politely. "Her private dining room is never available to the public."

Felix Valdemar stared at Vivian in shock. This Michelin three-star restaurant belonged to her?

Sophia dug her nails into her palms. She had just humiliated herself on Vivian's turf.

Once seated in the luxurious private room, Sophia slammed the menu down. "Whatever!"

When the food arrived, she sneered, "Disgusting! How dare this place call itself a restaurant?"

Felix took a bite of the signature dish. "I think it's delicious."

He secretly texted Ethan Roscente: Guess who I ran into? Dr. Laurent! This place is hers!

Ethan replied instantly: Did she get the short end of the stick?

"Not a chance!" Felix typed rapidly. Dr. Laurent shut Sophia down with one look.

"Hmm."

Felix rolled his eyes at the single-word response. Ethan's favoritism was painfully obvious.

He glanced across the table. Sophia's flawless makeup couldn't hide her livid expression as she scraped her fork violently against the plate.

This meal was destined to taste like ashes.
###Chapter 350

The dinner between Felix Valdemar and Sophia Sherwood was tense as a drawn bowstring.

Meanwhile, in the adjacent private dining room, Vivian Laurent and Isabella Langley were enjoying their meal in perfect harmony.

Isabella picked up a piece of sweet and sour pork rib, her eyes crinkling into crescents. "Look at Felix fawning over her like a lapdog."

Vivian sipped her juice. "You know him so well. Maybe you two should just get together."

"Ugh!" Isabella nearly choked. "I'd rather stay single forever! Even if every other man on earth dropped dead, I wouldn't touch him with a ten-foot pole!"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Every time Felix comes up, you bristle like a startled cat."

"Because he's insufferable!" Isabella gritted her teeth. "That permanent scowl on his face, and now he's groveling to some plastic surgery disaster. I'll eat my hat if that woman hasn't had work done!"

Vivian stifled a laugh.

"What's so funny?" Isabella demanded. "I'm serious! Her nose implant is practically poking through!"

Vivian waved a hand. "Nothing. I just think you two would make a great match."

"Match my foot!" Isabella slammed her chopsticks down. "I'm going back to spy on them. Maybe that woman's already stormed out in a huff."

Vivian didn't stop her, thoughtfully stirring her soup. Sophia Sherwood had been dropping Ethan Roscente's name all evening.

The way she kept emphasizing their connection, flaunting it right in Vivian's face. Another one of Ethan's admirers, no doubt.

And as usual, Vivian would be left dealing with the fallout.

She ground her molars. Next time she saw Ethan, she'd make sure he regretted this. That man was nothing but trouble.
###Chapter 351

Isabella Langley clicked back to the private dining room in her high heels, unable to suppress her grin.

"Vivian, they've all scattered like frightened rabbits. Not a soul left outside."

"That Felix Valdemar—next time I see him, I'll make sure he regrets crossing me."

The two women finished their meal at a leisurely pace before stepping out of the restaurant together.

A sleek black Maybach waited under the night sky.

A tall, broad-shouldered man leaned against the car, arms crossed. His icy demeanor made passing women avert their eyes.

Isabella squinted. "Isn't that Ethan Roscente?"

Vivian immediately turned to leave. "You're seeing things."

That striking figure, those unforgettable features—how could anyone mistake him?

"Vivian."

Ethan's deep voice carried through the air as he strode toward them.

"I've been waiting half an hour."

She halted. "Why?"

Her pulse quickened. Last night's memory flashed through her mind—Ethan bursting into her home, confessing his feelings while holding her close.

She'd left at dawn to avoid him, only to run into him again tonight.

Was he even sober now?

"Felix mentioned seeing you here, so I came."

Isabella took a tactful step back. "Should I go ahead?"

Ethan didn't hesitate. "I'll take her home."

Isabella studied them both skeptically.

"Not a drop of alcohol," he added. "I'll get her home safely."

After a thoughtful pause, she nodded. "Fine. But if Vivian suffers even a scratch, you and Felix will be tomorrow's trending topic."

Vivian sighed.

Why drag Felix into this?

As Isabella walked away, Vivian turned to leave.

"We have nothing to discuss."

In one swift motion, Ethan pulled her into his arms.

The crisp scent of cedar enveloped her. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.

"Stay. I need to talk to you."

"About what?" She forgot to struggle.

"Did you meet Sophia Sherwood?"

"What, your first love?"

"Nothing connects us." His arms tightened. "I heard there was tension between you. If she tries anything, don't hold back."

Vivian's ears burned. Why did that sound like he was taking her side?

"Who could possibly touch me? They'd need another decade of practice!"

Bullied? Sophia should be the one losing sleep tonight.

Ethan gazed at her spirited expression, warmth flickering in his eyes.

When Vivian met his amused stare, her heart lurched.

She hastily broke free, turning away. "Finished? I'm leaving."

Ethan followed instantly. "I'll drive you."
###Chapter 352

Ethan Roscente was unusually sober today.

Without alcohol clouding his judgment, he wasn't the obsessive madman who would pin her against the wall and kiss her forcefully.

The black Maybach idled at the villa's entrance.

"Vivian." Ethan called out to her as she tried to leave. "I remember every word I said last night."

Vivian Laurent paused mid-step.

"I know it's too late for this." His voice was low. "But I realized something—I think I've truly fallen for you."

The night breeze tangled her hair.

"Give me a chance." His gaze burned into her. "Let me court you properly, like any ordinary man would."

Last night's drunken confession could be dismissed as nonsense.

But now, his eyes were clear, his words deliberate.

Vivian tightened her grip on her purse strap.

"Ethan, the past is the past." She turned to face him. "Three years don't just rewind. We can't go back."

The villa gate slammed shut behind her.

Ethan remained rooted in place.

Even after Vivian showered and stood by the window, towel-drying her hair, his tall figure stubbornly lingered outside.

She yanked the curtains closed.

Her heart raced uncontrollably.

"Don't be stupid," she muttered to herself. "That man ignored you for three years. Why act devoted now?"

Yet by midnight, restless, she peeked through the curtains again.

The driveway was finally empty.

She exhaled in relief.

——

Ethan became an inescapable presence in the following days.

Whether at the hospital's main entrance, side door, or underground garage, his Maybach seemed to materialize everywhere.

Vivian started taking detours.

When her last patient entered the consultation room, she kept her eyes on the chart. "What seems to be the problem?"

"Lovesickness."

Her pen scratched across the medical record.

Ethan sat across from her, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

"Dr. Laurent, care to join me for dinner?"

"Cardiology is on the sixth floor." She coldly slid a referral card toward him.

"I only want you." His gaze smoldered. "My heart malfunctions whenever I see you."

Vivian pressed the intercom. "Security, please."

Ethan rose gracefully.

"I'll wait outside."

At shift's end, a familiar voice echoed down the hallway.

Vincent Valrose was all smiles. "Mr. Roscente, my daughter is truly fortunate to know someone like you—"

"Ethan!" Vivian's heels clicked sharply against the floor.
###Chapter 353

"Vivian, perfect timing. I just invited Mr. Roscente to be our guest, and he's agreed." Vincent Valrose beamed, his eyes crinkling into slits.

Vivian shot Ethan Roscente a glare filled with warning.

Ethan smirked. "I think I should come. After all, we were married for three—"

Vivian lunged forward, clamping her hand over his mouth.

Her heart pounded violently against her ribs. She'd kept this marriage secret from Vincent for years, and now Ethan was about to expose everything.

Vincent stood frozen, his jaw slack enough to catch flies.

"You...you two..."

He felt like he'd won the lottery. Ethan Roscente was his son-in-law? When had Vivian become so accomplished?

"Vivian! How could you keep such important news from your own father?" Vincent's voice trembled with excitement.

Vivian released Ethan and massaged her temples. The damage was done. Knowing Vincent, this would spiral out of control.

"Were married. Now divorced. Want to see the certificate?"

Vincent's smile vanished. His euphoria crashed into despair.

"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" he shrieked.

Vivian's voice turned icy. "Ask him yourself. I left with nothing. Don't expect any favors from me. I don't want to see either of you again!"

She spun on her heel, regretting this visit.

"Vivian!" Ethan realized his mistake too late. He'd wanted to go public, forgetting Vincent's tenacity.

Vincent scurried to Ethan's side. "Mr. Roscente, Vivian's always been willful. Please be merciful—"

"Enough!" Ethan's gaze turned dangerous. "How often were you there when she needed you? Where were you when she suffered? You don't deserve to call yourself her father."

"Harass her again, and you'll regret it."

Vincent turned ashen. Bitter regret flooded him—if only he'd treated Vivian better.
###Chapter 354

Vivian Laurent couldn't bear to look at those two any longer.

Her good mood after work had been completely ruined. Annoyed, she pulled out her phone and dialed Isabella Langley's number.

"Let's grab a drink."

"Perfect timing. I was just bored out of my mind!"

They agreed to meet at their usual bar. As soon as they reached the entrance, Isabella grabbed her arm with a mysterious expression.

"Viv, I've got a big job for you."

"Go on."

"The Queen of Eudora wants to hire you for a consultation."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Royalty?"

"Her daughter is sick. Apparently, she was kidnapped as a child and has been traumatized ever since—can't even leave the house." Isabella lowered her voice. "Name your price."

"I'll take it."

"They're currently visiting C Country."

The two pushed open the bar doors, and deafening music blasted toward them.

Isabella leaned closer to her ear. "Rare to see you initiating a drink night."

"Annoyed."

"Ethan Roscente again?"

"Don't mention him!" Vivian gritted her teeth.

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Drama?"

"I want to strangle him."

A burst of mocking laughter erupted from the dance floor. A crowd had formed a circle, pointing and jeering.

"Look at the freak trying to dance!"

"Her face looks like it got doused in acid!"

"Nice body, though. I’d tap that if she wore a mask!"

Vivian pushed through the crowd. A girl was dancing alone, her curves accentuated by a tight outfit, but her face was marred by hideous scars.

"Shut up." Vivian's voice was ice-cold.

The men turned, eyes glued to her face. "Hey, gorgeous, wanna join us?"

"I'm teaching animals some manners."

"Did we say something wrong?" A guy with bleached hair sneered, pointing at the dancer. "Who the hell comes out looking like that to seduce men?"

"Exactly!" his friend chimed in. "Twisting like that—clearly just begging for someone desperate enough to screw her."
###Chapter 355

Vivian Laurent snatched the glass from the table and flung its contents at the man without hesitation.

"This drink will help wash your filthy mouth."

The man froze in shock before erupting in rage. "You bitch! What makes you different from that ugly freak? Coming to a nightclub just to pick up men?"

A sharp slap echoed through the air.

Vivian gripped his chin and twisted with a sickening crack.

The man's jaw dislocated instantly, sweat beading on his forehead from the pain.

"Only pathetic men judge women by their looks." Vivian's lips curled in contempt. "She's worth a thousand of you trash."

The girl in the center of the dance floor stopped moving, staring at Vivian in surprise.

Vivian snapped her fingers at the bartender. "Throw these three out. Permanent ban."

"Yes, boss."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. No one had expected this young woman to be the owner of Nightfall Lounge.

As security dragged the men away, the dancing girl slipped out unnoticed.

"Follow her." Vivian frowned.

Isabella Langley looked puzzled. "What's wrong?"

"I'm worried she might do something reckless."

Outside, the three men were cursing loudly. "What kind of shithole is this? Those sluts dress like whores begging for attention!"

"That ugly bitch was the worst! How dare she show her face in public?"

They turned to leave when a figure blocked their path.

"Did I say you could go?" The girl's voice was icy.

The men screamed. "Ghost!"

Under the dim streetlights, her face looked eerily distorted.

Recognizing the girl from the dance floor, they leered again. "Did the ugly freak come looking for some fun?"

"Think you can scare us with a toy gun?" One man reached for the miniature pistol in her hand.

A cold glint flashed in her eyes. "You're dead."

She pulled the trigger. The bullet grazed the man's ear.

His legs gave out as he collapsed to his knees, urine soaking his pants.

"Next time, it's your head." She holstered the gun and vanished into the night.

When Vivian rushed outside, she found only three trembling men on the ground.

"Where is she?" Vivian hauled one up by his collar.

"A ghost... she's a ghost..." The man babbled incoherently.
###Chapter 356

A gunshot shattered the night.

The bullet struck the man's thigh with precision. Blood sprayed instantly.

The crowd scattered in panic.

"Ah—"

"It's real! Run!"

The girl smirked and pulled the trigger again.

Two more shots rang out.

The remaining two men collapsed, clutching their legs and howling.

"Did I say you could leave?"

Her stilettos clicked against the pavement as she approached. Moonlight glinted off the cold steel of her gun.

The three men trembled violently. "Mercy! We were wrong!"

"Mercy?"

Her crimson lips curled into a cruel smile.

She pressed the barrel against one man's temple.

He wet himself instantly.

"Stop!"

Vivian Laurent and Isabella Langley emerged from the shadows.

The girl narrowed her eyes. "Interfering?"

"Public murder? You want prison?" Vivian steadied Isabella's shaking hand. "These scum aren't worth your freedom."

A beat of silence.

The girl clicked the safety on and holstered her weapon.

She vanished into the night without a backward glance.

"So badass!" Isabella's eyes sparkled.

Vivian studied the bloodstains. "Call Lucas to clean this up."

"That girl..."

"Find her."

Isabella tapped rapidly on her tablet, her frown deepening.

"No records exist."

"Even you can't trace her?"

"Like... she appeared and disappeared from thin air." Isabella lowered her voice. "Professional assassin? That scar on her face..."

Vivian shook her head. "Unlikely."

"Then how do you explain her marksmanship?"

"Focus on the present."

By the time Lucas arrived, the scene was spotless.

At Nightfall Lounge, Isabella couldn't let it go.

"Who is she really?"

Vivian swirled her drink. "She'll appear when it's time."

"Don't deflect!" Isabella leaned in suddenly. "You and Ethan—"

Clink.

The glass hit the table sharply.

"Let's discuss the mystery girl instead."
###Chapter 357

The first light of dawn filtered through the windows as Vivian Laurent stood outside the operating room.

She had received an urgent call from Dr. Zachary Kalmien the previous night—a congenital heart disease patient required immediate surgery.

"Dr. Laurent, the patient is under anesthesia," a nurse handed her surgical scrubs.

Vivian swiftly pulled on gloves and entered the OR.

Under the surgical lights, her movements were fluid and precise. Each incision was executed with textbook accuracy, like a meticulously choreographed dance.

"Flawless," Dr. Kalmien murmured, eyes fixed on her technique. "This valve repair could be in a medical journal."

Three hours later, the operating lights dimmed.

"Vitals stable," the anesthesiologist reported.

Vivian removed her mask, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead.

"Dr. Laurent, there's another similar case next week—" Dr. Kalmien began hesitantly.

"Send me the file," Vivian cut him off. "I'm needed in General Surgery now."

As she stepped into the hallway, angry shouting echoed from down the corridor.

"Bring Vivian out here! I'm her father!"

Her steps faltered.

At the nurses' station, Vincent Valrose was shoving past security guards.

"Sir, we'll call the police if you continue!" The head nurse blocked his path.

"Go ahead! Let everyone see how the Roscente Group's young madam treats her own flesh and blood!"

Vivian approached with icy composure.

"What's happening?"

"Dr. Laurent!" A relieved nurse rushed forward. "This man claims to be your—"

Vincent lunged at her. "Vivian! I was wrong!"

She sidestepped effortlessly.

"I don't know him," she told security. "He's disrupting hospital operations. Call the authorities."

Vincent's face twisted with rage.

"You ungrateful brat!" He bellowed for the waiting area to hear. "Look how the Roscente heiress abandons her family!"

Murmurs rippled through the gathered patients.

"Twenty years I raised you, and now you're too good for your old man!" Vincent beat his chest dramatically. "Won't even pay my hospital bills!"

Vivian's gaze could have frozen hell.

"The fifty thousand dollars I transferred last week—gone in three days at the casino?"

The crowd erupted in disapproving noises.

Vincent flushed crimson. "That—that was child support!"

"Shall I show the bank records?" Vivian pulled out her phone. "Or should we ask Macau police for their surveillance footage?"

Vincent made a grab for her phone.

Nathan Clementson appeared like lightning, seizing the older man's wrist.

"Security!" Nathan barked. "Remove him!"

As guards dragged Vincent away, his screams echoed down the hall. "The Roscente heiress abuses her father! I'll tell every reporter in town!"

Vivian turned toward her office without a backward glance.

Nathan called after her. "Should I contact Mr. Roscente?"

"Don't bother." Her voice held finality. "Just a pathetic clown."

The office door clicked shut behind her.

Her phone screen illuminated with a new message:

Queen Eleanor of Eudora: Our appointment at seven tonight. Don't forget.
###Chapter 358

Endless Troubles

Vincent Valrose's shouting echoed through the hospital lobby.

Medical staff and patients stopped in their tracks.

"Nonsense!" An elderly woman with a cane snapped. "Dr. Laurent saved my granddaughter's life. She's the best doctor!"

"Exactly!"
"Who do you think you are?"
"How dare you slander Dr. Laurent?"

Patients rallied around Vivian Laurent in an uproar.

Vincent's face darkened.

"You've all been fooled!" He raised his voice. "She's wealthy and powerful now, but she won't even acknowledge her own father! Last time she came home, she kicked us out of the master bedroom!"

Vivian smirked coldly.

"My mother passed away long ago."
"That property belonged to her."
"When you sent me away to the countryside, did you remember I was your daughter?"

Vincent suddenly raised his volume.

"You got married without telling me!"
"Ethan Roscente is my son-in-law!"

The lobby fell silent.

Everyone exchanged stunned glances.

The head of Roscente Group?
Dr. Laurent's husband?

"So you could leech off him?" Vivian's eyes turned icy. "How many people did your illegitimate daughter nearly kill? Should I elaborate here?"

She turned to security.

"Escort him out."
"Take him straight to the police station."

Vincent continued hurling insults as he was dragged away.

Vivian massaged her temples.

This was all Ethan's fault for running his mouth.
Now the entire hospital knew.

Sophia Evans would catch wind of this too.
That woman wouldn't let it slide.

One problem after another.

She pulled out her phone.
Time to give Ethan a piece of her mind.

Roscente Group meeting room.

The atmosphere was tense.

Ethan was reprimanding the project team.

Then his phone rang.

Executives held their breaths.
Who dared interrupt?

Ethan picked up the call.
"Meeting adjourned."

He strode out of the room.

Sophia Sherwood looked up in frustration.
Her hard-won presentation opportunity—
Cut short just like that.
###Chapter 359

Ethan Roscente's phone vibrated during the board meeting.

A faint smile touched his lips when he saw the caller ID. The executives exchanged puzzled glances—their usually stern CEO never smiled.

"Meeting adjourned." He strode out of the room, fingers trembling slightly as he answered. "Vivian?"

Her familiar voice came through. "Ethan, are you free to meet?"

His grip tightened on the phone, knuckles turning white. This was the first time Vivian had initiated plans with him.

"I'm free now." His voice was tense. "Where are you? I'll pick you up."

"No need." Her tone was crisp. "Meet me at Blue Mountain Café below your office in thirty minutes."

The call ended abruptly. Ethan stood frozen, staring at the darkened screen for a long moment.

His secretary gave him a curious look when he turned. He cleared his throat. "Clear my schedule for the afternoon."

Back in the conference room, Ethan announced, "Double bonuses for all employees this month."

Murmurs erupted. The same CEO who had been furious moments ago was now handing out rewards?

Throughout the rest of the meeting, Ethan kept checking his watch. When Sophia Sherwood launched into a lengthy presentation, he cut her off. "Save it for your department head."

"Meeting dismissed." He stood so quickly his suit jacket fluttered.

Sophia watched his hurried exit with narrowed eyes. She followed discreetly and saw him enter the café, taking a seat by the window.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Roscente." She approached with a coffee. "Mind if I join you?"

Without looking up, he replied, "I'm waiting for someone."

The door chimed as it opened. Ethan's head snapped up, his gaze locking onto the figure stepping inside—

Vivian stood in the doorway in a beige trench coat, raindrops glistening in her hair.
###Chapter 360

Sunlight refracted through the café windows. Sophia Sherwood stood in the corner, her nails digging into her palms.

She had just witnessed Ethan Roscente's rare smile after a phone call.

Only Vivian Laurent could evoke that reaction from him.

Sophia picked up her coffee and strode toward Ethan's table in her stilettos.

"Oops!" she gasped, deliberately spilling the entire cup on his suit.

"My apologies, Mr. Roscente!" She hastily grabbed napkins, letting her fingers brush against his chest.

Ethan seized her wrist. "Get lost."

The door chimed as Vivian walked in.

A calculated glint flashed in Sophia's eyes as she collapsed onto Ethan's lap.

"Am I interrupting?" Vivian leaned against the table, arms crossed, her red lips curving.

Ethan stood abruptly, nearly sending Sophia tumbling.

"Dr. Laurent, here for coffee?" Sophia smoothed her skirt. "That was just an accident. I'll have Mr. Roscente's suit cleaned. I used to wash his school uniforms back in high school."

Ethan's expression darkened. "Bullshit."

"I'll wait for you in your office." Sophia shot Vivian a挑衅 look before swaying away.

Vivian pulled out a chair. "Make it quick. Wouldn't want to keep her waiting."

"She's just a classmate. I wasn't involved in her hiring." Ethan spoke rapidly. "She spilled that coffee on purpose."

"Stop." Vivian raised a hand. "I don't care about your little rendezvous."

The server brought coffee. Vivian downed half the cup without looking.

"I came here to yell at you." She slammed the cup down.

Ethan's eyebrow twitched.

"Ethan Roscente, are you out of your mind?" Vivian hissed. "What did I say after signing the divorce papers?"

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Now the entire hospital knows we were married!" Her voice was venomous. "Vincent Valrose showed up claiming you as his son-in-law. I had to send him to the police station!"

The coffee cup cracked under her grip.

"If I hear you spreading this nonsense again," Vivian narrowed her eyes, "I'll tell everyone we divorced because you're impotent."

Ethan suddenly stared at her cup.

"What?" she sneered. "Got a problem?"

"That's my coffee," he said quietly.

Vivian froze.
###Chapter 361

"Vincent Valrose caused a scene at the hospital?" Ethan Roscente's voice was icy.

He had warned that man.

"This is all your fault! If you hadn't told him about our marriage, he wouldn't have gone crazy. You're responsible for this!"

Vivian Laurent unleashed her anger in one breath, finally feeling the weight lift from her chest.

Much better.

"He won't get another chance to harass you." A storm brewed in Ethan's eyes.

Vincent was digging his own grave.

A waiter arrived with a coffee. "Miss, your coffee."

"Mine?" Vivian's eyes widened.

Then whose cup had she just—

Her gaze darted between the empty cup and Ethan. The answer was obvious.

"You didn't drink from this, right?" She clung to a sliver of hope.

"I did."

Vivian gripped the cup, resisting the urge to throw it in his face.

So what if it was an indirect kiss? They'd shared real ones before.

She took a large gulp from the new coffee.

"I'm done here. Leaving!"

She grabbed her bag. She still had to visit the police station and see a patient today.

"Wait." Ethan caught her wrist.

The electric touch made her yank her hand away instantly.

"What now?" She looked down at him with disdain.

Coffee stains bloomed on his expensive suit, but his striking looks remained unaffected.

"Sophia Sherwood and I—there's nothing between us." He explained again.

"Only guilty people repeat themselves."

"I don't want you to misunderstand." His intense gaze was unsettling.

"I don't care." She lied through her teeth.

Despite her words, seeing his earnest expression inexplicably lifted her mood.

"Goodbye."

"Tonight, could we—"

"Busy." She cut him off and walked away without looking back.

Ethan followed her to the door, watching her car disappear down the street.

Did she really feel nothing?

Did he mean nothing to her anymore?

Was she avoiding him, or was she genuinely occupied?

His eyes lingered on the empty road.

Nearby, Sophia Sherwood emerged from the shadows.

Though she couldn't hear their conversation, the way Ethan looked at Vivian was unmistakable.

It was a burning intensity she'd never received.

He was cold to every woman except Vivian—reduced to groveling at her feet.

And Vivian couldn't even spare him a glance.

Ethan was utterly, hopelessly in love with her.
###Chapter 362

Sophia Sherwood stood before the CEO's office door, her stilettos clicking against the marble floor. Her fingers absently traced the edge of the file in her hands.

The elevator doors slid open.

She immediately stepped forward. "Mr. Roscente, about this morning—"

"Ms. Sherwood." Ethan Roscente's icy gaze swept over her. "Explain."

Her lashes fluttered. "The coffee spill was an accident. I only wanted to help—"

"Roscente Group doesn't need employees who overstep." His voice cut through her words. "One more incident, and HR will handle it."

Sophia's grip tightened on the folder, her knuckles whitening. "Understood."

Ethan turned toward his office.

"That Ms. Laurent..." Sophia suddenly spoke up. "Is she a friend of yours?"

He paused mid-step. "None of your concern."

The glass door shut behind him. Sophia stared at her reflection in the polished surface before pulling out her phone.

"Felix, I saw Ms. Laurent today." She chose her words carefully. "She and Mr. Roscente—"

Felix Valdemar's reply came instantly: "You mean Dr. Laurent? Ethan's ex-wife."

The screen's glow reflected in Sophia's narrowed pupils.

Ex-wife.

The word rolled off her tongue, dissolving into a soft laugh. How dare a divorced woman still linger around Ethan?

She scrolled through her contacts, pausing on an invitation to a cocktail event. Next Wednesday, at the Blue Whale Club. A perfect opportunity.

Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows as Simon Eisner entered.

"Valrose Realty's status."

Simon opened his tablet. "Their cash flow has collapsed. Vincent Valrose mortgaged three properties, but the deficit keeps growing."

"Too slow." Ethan tapped the window frame. "Seven days."

Simon nodded. "The banks already caught wind. Collection notices will arrive at Valrose tomorrow."

"Keep him detained longer." Ethan turned, shadows sharpening his jawline. "By the time he's released, I want Valrose's liquidation announcement public."

"Understood."

Outside, storm clouds gathered. Ethan thought of Vivian's pale face, his eyes darkening.

Vincent Valrose would pay for laying a hand on her.
###Chapter 363

The café door swung shut behind Vivian Laurent as she adjusted her trench coat collar. The police interrogation had gone smoothly, and news of Vincent Valrose's detention for medical harassment lifted her spirits.

Dusk settled over the city as she approached the gilded hotel where the Eudoran royal family resided. Security was impenetrable—not even a fly could slip through.

After three rigorous checkpoints, Vivian was escorted to the penthouse suite. The queen sat by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her teacup pausing mid-air at the sight of her visitor.

"You must be...Dr. Luna?"

"Vivian is fine," she replied in flawless Eudoran.

The queen studied the improbably young woman before her. The black turtleneck accentuated her porcelain skin, and those almond eyes held unsettling calm.

"My daughter's condition—" The queen twisted her gemstone ring. "Perhaps examine me first? I've been suffering insomnia and heart palpitations."

Vivian's lips curved. She recognized this test.

"Your complexion is radiant, nails perfectly glossy." Her gaze swept over the monarch like a scanner. "True insomnia causes eyelid swelling, yet yours show no dark circles."

The queen's ears flushed pink. Her royal physician had declared her perfectly healthy that morning.

"However—" Vivian leaned in suddenly. "Loss of appetite recently?"

The queen's grip tightened on her skirt. She'd been nauseated by fish all month—could it be...?

"Not pregnancy." Vivian's fingers found her wrist. "Severe uterine chill. Likely complications from an early miscarriage."

The chandelier crystals trembled. The queen remembered the snowy night twenty years ago—the car crash that took her unborn child and left her womb damaged.

"Modern medicine could—"

"Too risky." Vivian cut her off. "Your current conception chances are below five percent. Even if successful, fetal arrest is probable."

The queen's pearl necklace snapped, scattering luminous beads across the marble floor.
###Chapter 364 

"My physical condition..."

"There are indeed some issues with your health." Vivian spoke softly. "I can prescribe some herbal remedies to improve your constitution, even if pregnancy isn't immediately possible."

The Queen finally lowered her guard. "Thank you, Dr. Luna."

After a moment's hesitation, she added, "My daughter is very sensitive. Please don't show any unusual reaction when you meet her."

"Isn't she physically ill?" Vivian asked, confused.

"She was kidnapped as a child and suffered severe psychological trauma." Pain flickered in the Queen's eyes. "You'll understand when you see her. Remain completely calm, or she'll retreat into prolonged silence."

Vivian nodded, curiosity stirring about the eighteen-year-old girl.

The Queen led her to a locked door and knocked gently. "Fiona, it's Mother."

Silence.

"She seems particularly exhausted today." The Queen's voice trembled with concern.

"Is there a spare key?"

The Queen shook her head. "Only she keeps one."

Vivian produced her tools. "Let me check on her. Don't worry, Your Majesty. I'll heal her."

The lock clicked open.

Darkness swallowed the room like an abyss.

Vivian scanned the shadows with the hallway light. "Are you certain someone's here?"

The Queen moved confidently toward the wardrobe and opened it—

A trembling figure curled inside.

"Fiona, this doctor is here to help you." The Queen's voice softened.

The girl buried her face in her knees, revealing only wary eyes.

Vivian noticed faint markings on her face and suddenly recalled the strange features from last night at Nightfall Lounge.

"May I speak with her alone?" Vivian requested abruptly.

The Queen hesitated. "I must stay."

"Her body is healthy. She only needs psychological counseling." Vivian met the Queen's gaze. "Post guards outside. They can intervene if I step out of line."

After a long pause, the Queen relented.

She'd consulted renowned doctors worldwide, yet her daughter refused to speak. This was her last hope.
###Chapter 365

The queen hurriedly left the room. Vivian Laurent walked slowly toward the wardrobe.

A pair of terrified eyes peeked through the gap in the wardrobe door.

"Stay back!" The girl's voice trembled as she curled into a ball.

Vivian walked past her without hesitation and turned on the bedside lamp.

The door clicked shut softly. Vivian sat on the edge of the bed. "My name is Vivian Laurent. I'm a fashion designer."

Ragged breathing came from inside the wardrobe.

"I'd like to design a dress for you." Vivian's voice was gentle. "May I see you?"

"Liar!" The girl suddenly shrieked. "You're a doctor! Another doctor my mother hired!"

Vivian pulled out a tablet from her bag. "Medicine is my side job. My main profession is designing for AN Atelier."

"AN?" The girl's voice wavered with uncertainty.

Vivian swiped open her portfolio on the screen.

The haute couture gowns made the girl hold her breath. Those flowing skirts and intricate embroideries matched the images she'd secretly saved on her phone.

"The Starlight Collection from last month..." The girl unconsciously leaned forward.

Vivian turned the tablet toward her. "Would you like to see the sketches for the new season?"

The girl's fingers trembled slightly, but she didn't leave the safety of the wardrobe.

"I..." She suddenly covered her face. "I'm too ugly to wear beautiful things."

Vivian opened her photo gallery. "I looked worse three years ago."

A bloated face appeared on the screen.

The girl peeked through her fingers, then gasped. "That's...really you?"

"Hormonal facial edema." Vivian said calmly. "It lasted two full years."

The wardrobe door creaked open slightly wider.

Pretending not to notice, Vivian kept scrolling. "I couldn't even look in mirrors back then."

A scarred hand suddenly reached out and touched the screen.

Vivian held her breath.

The familiar face finally emerged fully into the light—it was the defiant disfigured girl from Nightfall Lounge last night.

But her timid expression now made her seem like a completely different person.

"Your scars..." Vivian suppressed her shock. "They can be treated."

The girl immediately covered her face again. "They can't! Everyone calls me a monster!"

Vivian gently grasped her hand. "Modern medicine can—"

The moment their skin touched, Vivian's heart skipped a beat.

The texture of those scars...felt wrong.
###Chapter 366

Fiona Grandelle stared at Vivian Laurent's face, struck by an inexplicable sense of déjà vu.

She racked her brain but couldn't recall where she'd seen that face before.

Vivian's smile was warm, her eyes devoid of the usual mockery or pity Fiona was accustomed to.

At home, though the servants never said it outright, their evasive glances always made her skin crawl.

But Vivian was different.

Fiona slowly stepped out from behind the closet door.

"Can I really...?" Her voice was barely a whisper.

"Of course."

"But I've always been like this..." Fiona looked down, fingers twisting together.

Vivian spoke softly, "Trust me. I can perform the surgery for you."

Fiona shook her head violently. "It's useless. I had one as a child."

The kidnapping had left more than scars—it left shadows that never faded.

The accident during that surgery had stolen her courage completely.

"Just trust me." Vivian took her hand. "The world outside is beautiful. Have you ever been to a bar?"

Fiona shook her head blankly.

Vivian's eyes flickered.

She'd seen Fiona at Nightfall Lounge just last night.

"I'll take you sometime." Vivian probed gently, "Do you like shooting?"

"Too dangerous." Fiona shrank back. "I've never touched a gun."

The puzzle pieces clicked into place for Vivian.

The same person. Two polar opposite personalities.

One timid as a mouse. The other cold-blooded and decisive.

"Have you gone out since coming to Eudora?"

Fiona shook her head.

She hid in her room all day, afraid of even sunlight.

Vivian was almost certain now—Fiona had dissociative identity disorder.

A sensitive, fragile primary personality.

And a ruthless, dangerous alter.

The woman who'd wielded that gun last night might be someone Fiona herself didn't know existed.

"Would you like to visit me at the hospital?" Vivian changed tack. "There are many people there who need help."

Fiona hesitated.

"Plenty of handsome interns too." Vivian winked.

A faint blush colored Fiona's pale cheeks.
###Chapter 367

The Duchess paced the hallway, her stiletto heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

She glanced repeatedly at the closed door, her fingers twisting a silk scarf in restless agitation.

"Two hours already..."

The butler offered her a cup of tea, but she waved him away.

Inside the room, Vivian Laurent sat across from Fiona Grandelle, a coffee table separating them.

Fiona tapped her fingernails against the rim of her teacup, her gaze distant and unfocused.

"How much do you remember about last night?"

Vivian's voice was soft, almost cautious.

Fiona's head snapped up, her eyes sharpening. "You've been investigating me?"

"Just concerned."

The teacup slammed onto the table, spilling droplets of tea.

"I don't need—"

Her words cut off abruptly as her expression went blank. Her fingers trembled slightly.

Vivian noticed instantly.

"Headache?"

Fiona didn't answer, but the sweat beading at her temples said enough.

Outside, rapid footsteps approached.

"Your Grace, please—Dr. Luna said not to disturb—"

"That's my daughter in there!"

The door burst open just as Vivian tucked away her stethoscope.

"She needs rest."

The Duchess rushed to Fiona's side, finding her asleep, her breathing steady.

"But—"

"Let's talk outside."

In the hallway, Vivian got straight to the point. "How has her sleep been lately?"

"Strange. Sometimes she sleeps for hours but wakes up exhausted."

The Duchess frowned. "And..."

"And what?"

"Objects in her room... they move on their own."

Vivian nodded thoughtfully.

"I'll need to run more tests, but there's a condition."

"Name it."

"No one can know I was here."

Though puzzled, the Duchess agreed.

As Vivian hailed a cab outside the hotel, her phone buzzed.

"Three million just cleared!" Isabella Langley's voice was giddy. "What kind of illness pays that well?"

"That armed girl you saw last night."

"What? That psy— Wait, she's the Duchess's daughter?"

Vivian slid into the taxi.

"More accurately, one version of her."
###Chapter 368 Being Her Role Model

Isabella Langley's eyes widened as her fingers unconsciously tightened around the coffee cup.

"That girl is actually the princess's daughter?"

Vivian Laurent closed the medical chart, her fingertips lightly tapping the desk. "Severe facial scar contractures will require staged surgical repairs."

She paused before adding, "The psychological issues are the most challenging part."

Dissociative Identity Disorder was a ticking time bomb that could detonate at any moment. Vivian recalled those evasive eyes, feeling a ripple of emotion.

"This consultation fee won't be easily earned," Isabella sighed.

Vivian shook her head. "Consider it charity work."

Under the desk lamp late at night, Vivian scribbled furiously. Treatment plans were revised repeatedly until dawn broke.

The next evening, she knocked on the hotel room door with homemade cookies. Fiona Grandelle timidly took a bite, her eyes lighting up.

"The night markets in our country are quite lively," Vivian described vividly. "Candied fruits, sugar paintings, and glowing balloons."

Fiona twisted her fingers together but couldn't resist asking, "Really?"

On the third day, Vivian appeared wearing meticulously applied scar makeup. The princess gasped upon opening the door.

"It's me," Vivian smiled.

Fiona's pupils contracted violently. The scars from photographs now appeared shockingly real before her eyes.

"Want to go out with me?" Vivian extended her hand. "Let those gossips go to hell."

In the mall, lecherous eyes lingered on them.

"Ugly freaks shouldn't be out scaring people," a man deliberately raised his voice.

Vivian pointed her phone at him. "Smile for the camera. Let the internet admire your handsome face."

The man's expression changed instantly. "Just joking!"

"Oh?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Shall I educate everyone about male reproductive health issues then?"

Snickers erupted around them. The man fled after being forced to apologize.

Fiona tugged at Vivian's sleeve, eyes shining.

"Remember," Vivian crouched to meet her gaze, "your worth isn't written on your face."

Three consecutive days of companionship gradually relaxed Fiona. On their last evening, the girl even initiated a hug.

"The surgery will be in Eudora," the princess said gratefully, clasping Vivian's hands. "We'll need your expertise then."

In the hospital corridor, Emily Garnache stumbled backward from a collision.

"Watch where you're going!" Rubbing her shoulder, she only saw a fleeing figure.

Security surrounded the person curled in the corner. Ryan Fairsprene parted the crowd, signaling everyone to disperse.

"Need help?" He maintained a safe distance while crouching.

A trembling voice came from behind the mask. "I'm looking...for Dr. Laurent."
###Chapter 369

"Do you have an appointment with Dr. Vivian Laurent? Her schedule is always fully booked."

The receptionist looked up. Vivian's reputation drew endless streams of patients every day.

"I... know her."

Fiona Grandelle clenched the hem of her shirt, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm Ryan Fairsprene, a doctor at this hospital." A gentle male voice came from behind her. "Let me take you to her."

She stared at the ID badge on his chest for a long moment. The name Ryan Fairsprene was clearly printed, and the photo matched the man perfectly.

Vivian had encouraged her to get out more.

In the last few days before returning home, she had finally mustered the courage to come to the hospital. But the place was too crowded. Every pair of eyes made her skin prickle, and she longed to retreat back into her shell.

Yet this doctor seemed trustworthy.

"Thank you," she murmured.

Inside the office, Vivian was reviewing Emily Garnache's follow-up report.

"You've recovered well. You can resume normal physical activities now."

"All thanks to you, Vivian!" Emily swung her legs excitedly. "I got this limited-edition figurine for you!"

Before Vivian could decline, the office door opened.

Ryan led Fiona inside.

"Dr. Laurent, this young lady says she's a friend of yours."

Vivian stood in surprise. "Fiona?"

"Oh! You're the girl I bumped into in the hallway!" Emily's eyes lit up. "So you're Vivian's friend!"

Fiona lowered her head awkwardly. "I... I'm sorry about earlier..."

"I was the one running too fast!" Emily waved her hand dismissively. "Check out this figurine—isn't it cool?"

A gleaming Thor figurine sat on the desk.

"The newest edition..." Fiona unconsciously stepped closer.

"You like it?" Emily immediately dug through her bag. "Here, take all these collectibles! There's a comic convention next week—we should go together!"

The sudden enthusiasm left Fiona flustered.

Vivian chuckled, coming to her rescue. "Emily, don't overwhelm her."

"Oops, got carried away." Emily stuck out her tongue. "Vivian, I'll head out now. Dad's waiting outside."

She dashed off, leaving a pile of anime merchandise on the desk.

Fiona gazed at the intricate figurines, the corners of her lips lifting slightly.
###Chapter 370

Fiona Grandelle's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

She suddenly realized how many kind people existed in the world. Dr. Vivian Laurent was always so gentle, the girl who gifted her anime merchandise had the sweetest smile, and then there was Dr. Ryan Fairsprene, who had helped her into the office.

After settling Fiona in, Ryan sensed this might involve private medical matters.

"Dr. Laurent, I'll step out."

Vivian stopped him. "Stay. This is Fiona Grandelle. You might need to assist with her case in the future."

Fiona twisted the hem of her shirt, her gaze shy but calm.

"Dr. Laurent, I came to say goodbye," she murmured. "My parents and I are returning home."

A warm smile touched Vivian's lips. "Next time we meet, I'll bring Dr. Fairsprene to visit you. Okay?"

After a brief hesitation, Fiona nodded.

The farewell was quick—Fiona had a flight to catch. Vivian gestured for Ryan to escort her out.

A private car waited at the hospital entrance. Ryan handed her his card. "If Dr. Laurent is unavailable, you can contact me."

"Thank you." Fiona's eyes curved into crescents.

Back in the office, Ryan hesitated before speaking.

"Her medical records." Vivian passed him a file. "She consented to your involvement."

Ryan flipped through the documents, his pupils contracting sharply. "Her face—"

"Childhood trauma," Vivian said gravely. "She needs surgery. I require an assistant."

"I'll do it!" Ryan answered without hesitation.

Vivian studied him. "Aren't you curious about who she is?"

He shook his head.

"Better not to know." Vivian's voice softened. "Her comfort around you is rare."

"I won't let you down," Ryan vowed.

As he left with the file, his steps were lighter. Collaborating with Vivian and helping that timid girl—it felt like a double blessing.

......

Under the glow of city lights, Ethan Roscente navigated a business dinner.

The clients kept pushing drinks, their intentions obvious. But the CEO of Roscente Group was no puppet. By the end, it was they who slumped over the table, drunk.

Sophia Sherwood's shadow loomed behind this setup. She'd asked an acquaintance to get Ethan drunk, hoping for a private moment.

Her plan failed. Ethan hadn't touched a drop, departing with effortless grace.

Sophia clenched her fists. Despite joining Roscente Group, chances to approach him were scarce. Every attempt to "report work" got redirected to her direct supervisor.

Online gossip painted Sophia Evans as the biggest threat. But the real rival was his ex-wife—Vivian.

Sophia's eyes narrowed. In business wars, the smartest move was eliminating obstacles through others' hands.
###Chapter 371

Sophia Evans huddled by the floor-to-ceiling window of her apartment in the Kingdom of Eudora. Her fingers absently traced the screen of her phone. Ever since Victoria Roscente's clumsy scheme had failed, she'd been as jumpy as a startled bird, terrified of angering Ethan Roscente.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

She glanced down at the photo on the screen—Ethan and Vivian Laurent sitting across from each other in a café. His usually cold, sharp features held a softness she'd never seen before.

A second message popped up immediately: "Sophia, did you know Vivian is Ethan's ex-wife?"

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Who the hell are you?" Sophia's voice trembled slightly when the call connected.

"That's not important," the woman on the other end chuckled. "So you really didn't know."

Sophia tightened her grip on the phone. "What do you want?"

"To help you, of course." Sophia Sherwood swirled the red wine in her glass. "Don't you find it... ironic that the CEO is still entangled with his ex-wife after their divorce?"

"Lies!" Sophia's voice rose sharply. "Ethan's ex-wife was an ugly hag!"

A knowing laugh came through the line. "Why don't you check for yourself?"

After hanging up, Sophia immediately dialed a private investigator.

Three days later, the investigative report sat quietly in her inbox.

Vivian's plastic surgery records, hospital registration files, Vincent Valrose's public statement... Each piece of evidence cut into her like a knife.

Her hands shook as she dialed Ethan's number, only to be met with a cold automated voicemail.

"I'm going back to the country." Sophia dragged her suitcase to the door, only to be blocked by two black-suited bodyguards.

"The CEO has instructed that Miss Evans needs rest."

She bit her lip hard and turned back into the room, sending a message to the mysterious number: "How are you going to help me?"

Sophia Sherwood smirked at the message on her screen.

The fish had taken the bait. Now it was time to reel it in.
###Chapter 372

Night had fallen. Ethan Roscente's black Maybach sat parked in front of Vivian Laurent's villa. The entire house was dark, with only the streetlights casting faint golden halos.

He glanced at his watch. The hands had just passed nine.

The distant hum of an engine grew closer. Vivian's red sports car rolled into view. She lowered the window and arched a brow at the man blocking her driveway.

"Move," she said coldly.

Ethan stepped out of his car and approached. "Five minutes."

Vivian scoffed. "Three. Clock's ticking."

"The Valrose Group will declare bankruptcy tomorrow," he cut straight to the point. "The family estate will be seized."

"And?"

"I can buy it." His gaze held hers. "Your childhood is there."

Her fingers tapped lightly on the steering wheel. "Don't bother. That place stopped being mine long ago."

She pushed open the car door. The sharp click of her heels echoed against the asphalt.

Ethan suddenly reached out to stop her.

"Something else?" Vivian frowned.

"I missed you." His voice was low.

The air between them froze. The tips of Vivian's ears burned as she turned to leave.

"Time's not up yet." Ethan caught her wrist.

"Going on a business trip?" Her eyes brightened. "When do you leave?"

His expression darkened. "That happy about it?"

"Absolutely." Her smile was radiant. "Finally, some peace and quiet."

In one swift motion, he pulled her into his arms. Vivian stumbled against his chest, the crisp scent of cedar enveloping her.

"Let go!"

"Just for a moment." His arms tightened. "Or I'll camp outside your door tonight."

She gritted her teeth. "You're impossible."

"Mm." He rested his chin atop her head. "Think of me."

The three minutes were up. Vivian shoved him away and stormed into the villa without a backward glance.

The slam of the door sent sparrows scattering from the garden.

Ethan stood still, his fingertips still tingling from the memory of her hair. He smiled faintly to himself before turning back to his car.

Moonlight stretched his shadow long across the ground.
###Chapter 373

Ethan Roscente watched her leave, a faint smile playing on his lips.

At dawn the next day, Ethan boarded the earliest flight to handle business out of town.

Vivian Laurent didn't go to the hospital. Instead, she headed straight to the Triple Six Realty construction site. After Natalie's previous sabotage, she had become extra cautious. She personally inspected the progress every week, demanding strict quality checks on all materials. Not a single flaw was tolerated.

That same day, Ethan's prediction came true—Valrose Realty declared bankruptcy.

Vincent Valrose had always been at the helm of the company. Natalie, despite her managerial title, was utterly helpless in the crisis. With Vincent detained, she could only watch as the family empire crumbled.

News of Valrose Realty's collapse instantly trended. As a prominent real estate developer, their downfall meant multiple projects were abruptly halted, leaving countless buildings unfinished. The trending list overflowed with enraged homeowners' outcries.

"Valrose, give us back our life savings! We emptied six family wallets for this marital home! My wife is eight months pregnant—she collapsed and was rushed to the ER!"

"Twenty years of mortgage payments left, and now the building is just a skeleton. Between layoffs and this unfinished nightmare, they're pushing us to the brink!"

"$60,000 down payment, $2 million loan. Every morning I wake up to debt with nothing to show for it!"

Furious homeowners stormed the construction sites and Valrose headquarters, surrounding the building in a suffocating mob. Someone shattered the company's glass windows as the scene spiraled into chaos.

When Vincent's secretary was granted visitation, the once-mighty real estate tycoon turned ashen.

"Valrose... is bankrupt?"

It had happened at least six months earlier than he'd projected. By his calculations, their funds should have lasted until year-end.

"Get me out! Now!"

But the cold bars offered no reprieve. With his bail date still pending, he could only pace his cell in impotent rage.

Natalie's situation was far worse. Unable to reach Vincent, the homeowners directed their fury at her.

"Bloodsucker! Give us our money back!"

"No one leaves until we get answers!"

Eggs and rotten vegetables pelted Natalie, leaving her humiliated. She had no idea why the company had imploded so suddenly. Worse, all her assets were frozen—even her villa had been seized.

When another rotten egg exploded across her face, Natalie finally snapped.

"Poor trash! A few million is nothing to you? Go sue if you dare!"
###Chapter 374

Natalie Valois stood at the company entrance, her face deathly pale.

"Was the bankruptcy under my control? What's the point of taking it out on me?" she shrieked hysterically.

The crowd stirred restlessly.

"Blame your own bad luck!" Natalie sneered. "Beating me to death won't bring your homes back!"

The enraged homeowners erupted.

Someone lunged forward, punching Natalie square in the face.

She staggered and collapsed.

"Fraud! Give us back our life savings!"

Blows rained down on her.

By the time police arrived, Natalie's face was covered in blood.

She was rushed to the hospital.

After minimal treatment, she was forced to leave, unable to afford the medical fees.

Standing outside the hospital, Natalie remembered her home had already been seized.

With trembling hands, she dialed Oliver Roland's number.

Thirty minutes later, Oliver's car pulled up.

"Oliver..." She threw herself into his arms, sobbing.

Oliver emotionlessly pushed her away.

"Your company crossed the line."

Natalie's eyes widened. "You're taking their side too?"

"Leave if you don't want to hear it." He turned toward his car.

Natalie hurried after him.

Her fists clenched tightly.

This was her last chance.

Marrying into the Roland family would give her a fresh start.

Meanwhile, Vivian Laurent watched the news unfold.

Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre arrived in a rush.

"Valrose Realty really ruined lives this time," Isabella sighed.

Lucas nodded. "Our company would never pull this."

Vivian studied the photos of protesting homeowners.

She knew Ethan Roscente had fueled the flames.

But Valrose's problems ran too deep.

"Roscente Group just issued a statement!" Isabella suddenly exclaimed.
###Chapter 375
Ethan's Decision

The Roscente Group's announcement came without warning.

The statement was concise: All ongoing construction projects under Valrose Realty would be taken over by Roscente Group to ensure timely completion.

Isabella Langley's eyes widened. "Has Ethan lost his mind? Why would he take on this mess?"

Lucas Lefèvre frowned. "There are over a dozen projects nationwide. The additional funding required is astronomical. What does Roscente stand to gain?"

Their gazes simultaneously shifted to Vivian Laurent.

Vivian was staring blankly at her phone screen.

"Viv," Isabella leaned closer, "do you think Ethan did this for you?"

Vivian's fingers twitched. "Don't be ridiculous."

"I can't think of any other reason," Isabella stated firmly. "Roscente doesn't need the publicity."

Vivian turned away. "His actions have always been unpredictable."

But her heart stirred.

Ethan wasn't the type of businessman who prioritized profit above all else. With Valrose's collapse, ordinary homebuyers would suffer the most. By taking over, he cut off Valrose's escape route while protecting innocent people.

Her phone suddenly rang.

That familiar name flashed across the screen.

After three seconds of hesitation, she answered.

"I didn't expect you to pick up." Ethan's voice carried a hint of surprise.

"Why did you take over Valrose's projects?" Vivian got straight to the point.

A brief silence followed.

"If I didn't," Ethan asked softly, "would you have stood by and done nothing?"

Vivian's breath caught.

The answer was obvious.
###Chapter 376

The news of Ethan Roscente taking over the unfinished building project sent a shiver down Vivian Laurent's spine.

Her fingers tightened around the phone, the tips burning slightly.

Ethan's voice carried amusement through the receiver. "If you're touched, come back and thank me properly."

Vivian's ears grew warm. "Don't flatter yourself."

"Then have dinner with me?"

"Depends on my mood."

After hanging up, Vivian gazed out the window. Ethan's move was brilliant—it solved a public issue while boosting Roscente Group's reputation.

But not everyone was pleased.

Natalie Valrose stared at the news, her nails digging into her palms.

"Bitch!" She hurled her phone against the wall.

To her, this was clearly a scheme between Vivian and Ethan. Valrose Realty went bankrupt while Roscente Group reaped all the benefits.

"This is all your fault..." Natalie's eyes turned bloodshot.

She started her car and tailed Vivian, who had just left the construction site.

Under the night sky, two vehicles entered the main road in succession.

Vivian glanced at the rearview mirror. The silver sedan had been following her for three blocks.

"How interesting." She lightly pressed the accelerator.

The traffic light turned green.

A cargo truck approached from the opposite direction.

Natalie suddenly grinned and slammed the gas pedal.

"Die!"

The silver car shot toward Vivian's vehicle like an arrow.

At the critical moment, Vivian jerked the steering wheel.

The tires screeched against the pavement.
###Chapter 377

Vivian Laurent jerked the steering wheel hard.

When Natalie Valois' car came barreling from the side, she swerved decisively into the adjacent lane.

Her vehicle carved a perfect arc, slotting neatly in front of the semi-truck.

Natalie clearly hadn't anticipated this move.

Her car was already at top speed—braking was impossible.

The truck driver's eyes widened in horror.

Crash—

The deafening screech of metal filled the air.

Natalie's sedan crumpled like paper under the semi's massive weight.

Vivian parked smoothly and dialed emergency services.

The truck driver stumbled out, his face ashen. "It wasn't me! She came out of nowhere!"

Only then did Vivian recognize the face behind the wheel.

Natalie.

One second slower, and she'd be the one lying in a pool of blood.

By the time firefighters arrived, Natalie was unconscious.

Shards of twisted metal had impaled her thigh.

Vivian watched coldly.

That leg would never function again.

Police pulled surveillance footage immediately.

"How long had the victim been following you?"

"Since I left the office."

"What's your relationship?"

"My father's love child." Vivian's voice remained steady. "Valrose Realty declared bankruptcy yesterday."

The cameras captured Natalie's murderous intent with perfect clarity.

It was midnight by the time Vivian finished her statement.

She didn't expect to see Ethan Roscente at the precinct.

He pushed through the doors, his suit jacket damp with rain, looking like he'd come straight from a cross-country flight.
###Chapter 378

Vivian Laurent's pupils contracted as she stared at the man who had suddenly appeared before her.

Ethan Roscente stood in front of her less than twenty-four hours after leaving for his business trip.

His long fingers swiftly checked her arms and shoulders for injuries. Only when he confirmed she was unharmed did the tension in his jaw ease slightly.

He had been in the middle of an overseas meeting when the police called about Vivian's car accident. Documents scattered across the floor as he bolted from the conference room to book the first flight back.

Ethan crushed her against his chest with enough force to bruise. "Thank God you're okay."

The gruesome crash scene photos circulating online had nearly shattered his control.

"Let go!" Vivian shoved against him. "Are you trying to suffocate me?"

He loosened his grip but kept one hand firmly on her waist.

"We contacted your husband," the approaching officer explained.

"You've got the wrong person. He's not—"

"Yes."

"No!"

Their simultaneous answers couldn't have been more opposite.

The officer's gaze flickered between them. "This isn't your husband?"

Vivian shot Ethan a glare. This man kept claiming relationships that didn't exist.

Ethan cleared his throat. "We were married. Now... we're divorced."

Understanding dawned on the officer's face.

"I'll handle this." Ethan guided Vivian to a chair in the waiting area before turning back with an entirely different aura.

He faced the officers with quiet authority. "The surveillance footage clearly shows Natalie Valois attempted murder. I expect justice for my wife."

"Ex-wife," Vivian corrected from behind him.

Ethan ignored her. "Contact me directly for follow-up. Don't bother her."

By the time they finished giving statements, night had fallen. A breeze tousled Vivian's hair as she stepped out of the precinct.

"How was your project?" she asked, glancing sideways.

Ethan's gaze traced her profile hungrily. "How could I focus after hearing you were hurt?"

"Overreacting." She scoffed. "I can take care of myself."

"But I can't stand the fear." His hand closed around hers abruptly. "Let me install a tracker on your phone."

Vivian jerked free. "Planning to stalk your ex, Mr. Roscente?"

Streetlights stretched their shadows long across the pavement. Ethan stepped closer until his silhouette engulfed hers. "Say the word, and you won't be my ex by tomorrow."

"In your dreams." She retreated half a step. "About Natalie—"

"Leave her to me." His eyes turned glacial. "She'll disappear for daring to lay a finger on you."
###Chapter 379

Vivian's pupils constricted sharply.

Ethan's words carried hidden meaning, putting her instantly on guard.

"What are you implying?" She took half a step back, eyes wary. "Listen carefully—whether Natalie lives or dies is her own fate. Don't interfere."

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

"And don't you dare use 'for my sake' as an excuse. I refuse to bail you out of jail."

Ethan suddenly laughed.

"So defensive. Worried about me?"

"Don't flatter yourself." Vivian turned her face away. "I just don't want to be implicated."

He didn't argue, the amusement in his gaze deepening.

"It's late. Let me take you home."

A glance at his wristwatch.

"Get some rest. Don't overthink things."

"Unnecessary." Her brows knitted. "Worry about yourself—I'd hate for you to drop dead from exhaustion."

"Not happening."

Ethan massaged his temples.

"I'm catching a flight right after dropping you off." A pause. "Just wanted to see you a little longer."

Vivian stared at him incredulously.

"You flew for hours just for this brief visit?"

"Couldn't focus without seeing you."

Before she could react, his arms encircled her.

Vivian stiffened, ready to push away—until his weary voice murmured above her.

"Stay still. Just for a moment."

His labored breathing betrayed prolonged sleep deprivation.

Her hands hovered midair.

Finally, she exhaled sharply.

"Three minutes."

Ethan tightened his embrace, face buried in her hair.

When the time elapsed, he released her.

A black sedan waited silently by the curb.

He opened the door, watching until she was safely inside.

Only when Vivian's apartment lights flickered on did he turn away.

She stood by the window, fingers unconsciously twisting the curtain fabric.

Ethan's silhouette gradually dissolved into the night.

Her pulse remained erratic.

She'd resolved to move on, yet this man effortlessly disrupted her equilibrium.

Crossing continents out of concern. Appearing without warning.

Vivian couldn't afford to trust again.

The risk of history repeating was too great.

Moonlight cast cold brilliance through the glass.

She remained motionless for hours.

At dawn, Isabella and Lucas arrived in a frenzy.

"Viv!"

Isabella seized her shoulders, scanning her urgently.

"That lunatic Natalie—has she completely lost it?"

Lucas's expression darkened.

"Self-inflicted disaster. That scourge deserves permanent disappearance."

Vivian poured water calmly.

"I'm unharmed."

Her lips pressed together.

"But she'll never recover from this."

The hospital update was grim.

After overnight emergency treatment, Natalie survived—but with multiple fractures.

Most critically, nerve damage in her legs. Doctors confirmed she'd likely never walk again.
###Chapter 380

Sunlight streamed through the window, stinging Natalie's eyes as she awoke.

The steady beeping of ICU monitors surrounded her. Tubes coiled around her body like venomous snakes.

Pearl Valrose wept outside the ward, her eyes swollen. With her husband still in custody and her daughter hospitalized, Oliver Roland covered all medical expenses.

When nurses announced visiting hours, Pearl fumbled into sterile gowns.

"Natalie!" She collapsed by the hospital bed, tears falling uncontrollably. "Why must fate be so cruel to us?"

Windshield glass had carved a grotesque scar across Natalie's face. Her right arm sat encased in plaster, while doctors feared her left leg might never fully recover.

"Mom..." Natalie's voice came out hoarse. "It hurts...everything hurts..."

Pearl's heart shattered. This was her precious daughter, the apple of her eye.

"What really happened?"

"It was Vivian!" Hatred burned in Natalie's eyes. "That bitch did this to me!"

She'd meant to kill Vivian, yet fate twisted the knife against herself. Surviving meant getting revenge.

"Don't think about that now." Pearl wiped her tears. "With these injuries...who would marry you now?"

Their lavish lifestyle had vanished. They couldn't even afford medical bills, crammed into some dingy rental.

"Does...does Oliver still want me?" Natalie suddenly sobbed. Tears seeped into her wounds, making her gasp.

She tried touching her face but couldn't lift her arm.

"The doctors mentioned reconstructive surgery..." Pearl's eyes darted nervously. "But right now we..."

Leaning closer, she whispered, "Natalie, Oliver is our only hope now."

Natalie stared blankly.

"Once you recover, I'll make sure you conceive his child." Pearl's expression turned venomous. "Then he'll be our personal ATM."

Oliver kept delaying their marriage, still pining for Vivian. Pearl hadn't forgotten.

"I'll make sure he has no other heirs." Pearl gritted her teeth. "You'll be the Roscente family's only future."

Only the hum of medical equipment filled the room. Natalie gazed at the ceiling, a cold smile twisting her lips.
###Chapter 381

Natalie finally quieted down.

When she woke up, the police came to take her statement.

"It was Vivian!" Natalie screamed hysterically. "She tried to kill me! That car crash was her doing!"

"Our investigation shows your vehicle had no prior issues," the officer said calmly, flipping through his notes. "You were the one tailing her and suddenly accelerated. Do you have proof Vivian orchestrated this?"

Natalie gripped the sheets, her knuckles turning white.

She had no evidence.

"It was her!" Natalie shrieked. "She ruined my life! Destroyed the Valrose family!"

"Arrest her now!"

The officers exchanged glances and silently closed their notebooks.

All evidence pointed to Natalie's premeditated revenge.

Valrose Realty's bankruptcy resulted from mismanagement and tax evasion. Ethan Roscente's documents provided irrefutable proof.

"The case has no connection to Vivian," the officer concluded.

"Why?!" Natalie pounded the hospital bed. "You're all taking her side!"

Once the Valrose family's golden girl and corporate executive.

Now a cripple confined to a hospital bed.

Natalie bit her lip until it bled, staining her teeth crimson.

She vowed to recover and return stronger.

Vivian would pay.

......

After days of construction site inspections, Vivian returned to the hospital.

Her phone buzzed.

Fiona Grandelle's name lit up the screen.

"Vivian!" The cheerful voice bubbled through the receiver. "I'm on my way to the capital. Can you pick me up?"

"You're coming to the States?" Vivian stood up in surprise.

"You mentioned a comic convention last time. I wanted to visit." Fiona's voice remained light. "Sent you the flight details!"

Vivian checked the time. The plane would arrive that evening.

"Alone?" Vivian sounded concerned.

"Mom wanted to send bodyguards. I refused." Fiona's tone turned firm. "I need to try being independent."

Hanging up, Vivian smiled warmly.

At dusk, the airport arrival hall.

Vivian paused mid-step near the exit.

Sophia Sherwood stood there in a tight leather skirt, makeup impeccable.

"Dr. Laurent?" Sophia arched a brow, eyes wary. "What a coincidence."

Vivian gave a curt nod and walked past.

The flight arrival announcement echoed through the terminal.

Vivian looked toward the gates, waiting for a familiar figure.
###Chapter 382

Ethan's Surprise

The airport echoed with overlapping announcements.

Vivian stood by the arrivals gate, scrolling through her phone. Her beige trench coat accentuated her slender frame.

Sophia Sherwood approached in stilettos, her gaze sweeping over Vivian.

"What a coincidence," Sophia said, tilting her chin up.

Vivian didn't look up. "Not really. I'm waiting for someone."

Sophia smirked. She'd already learned Ethan was returning today. Who else would Vivian be here for?

"Some people just can't take a hint," Sophia said pointedly. "Still clinging after a divorce."

Vivian finally met her eyes, calm. "Are you describing yourself, Miss Sherwood?"

Sophia's face tightened.

A commotion erupted at the exit. Ethan strode out, his tall frame sharply defined in a black suit.

"Mr. Roscente!" Sophia instantly brightened, stepping forward.

Ethan sidestepped her outstretched hand. "Why are you here?"

"I—" Her eyes darted. "Just seeing off a friend."

Vivian stifled a laugh.

Ethan's gaze snapped to her, pupils contracting. He closed the distance, voice low with restrained delight. "You came for me?"

Vivian shook her head. "Just passing through."

Sophia cut in, "She obviously—"

"Enough." Ethan's icy tone silenced her. "I don't recall inviting you."

Sophia paled.

Vivian checked her watch. "I have plans."

Ethan caught her wrist. "Let me drive you."

"No need." She pulled free. "Miss Sherwood came all this way for you."

Sophia stammered, "I really was just—"

"Meeting friends in arrivals?" Vivian arched a brow. "Did they travel in the cargo hold?"

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes.

Sophia flushed with anger. "And you? Don't pretend you—"

"I have a business meeting at the airport café." Vivian displayed a reservation on her phone. "Need to see the chat logs?"

Ethan's expression darkened.

She turned, her coat flaring in a clean arc.

Sophia seized Ethan's arm. "She's clearly—"

"Leave." He didn't glance back as he pursued Vivian.
###Chapter 383

The airport terminal buzzed with activity as flight announcements echoed through the speakers.

Vivian Laurent stood by the arrivals gate, her gaze fixed on the exit.

"I already told you. I'm here to pick someone up."

Her reply was curt, delivered without turning around.

Sophia Sherwood approached in stilettos, her cloying perfume overpowering.

"What a coincidence. Don't tell me you're here for Mr. Roscente?"

Vivian finally glanced at her, eyes frosty.

"None of your business."

Nearby, Ethan Roscente stood in a tailored suit, watching Vivian intently.

He strode forward with a smile.

"Who are you waiting for? I'll keep you company."

Vivian took a step back, maintaining distance.

"No need."

Sophia immediately interjected. "Mr. Roscente is being kind. Must you be so rude?"

Vivian scoffed.

"This conversation doesn't concern you."

Sophia's face fell as she turned to Ethan with wounded eyes.

"Mr. Roscente, she—"

Ethan frowned sharply.

"Leave."

Sophia bit her lip in frustration.

She'd worn her newest designer dress and perfected her makeup.

Yet Ethan's attention remained on Vivian's bare-faced elegance.

A phone vibrated.

Vivian checked the message from Fiona Grandelle:

"Almost out. But there are so many people..."

Her brow furrowed as she eyed the two obstructing her path.

"Move."

Ethan stepped closer instead.

"I'm curious who you're meeting."

Sophia chimed in with feigned sweetness.

"We can all wait together."

Vivian inhaled deeply, suppressing her irritation.

At the exit, a petite figure in a baseball cap peered around nervously.

Fiona's eyes lit up upon spotting Vivian—then faltered when she noticed the others.
###Chapter 384

Vivian glared coldly at Ethan Roscente.

"Ethan, are you leaving or not?"

Her slender fingers tapped impatiently against the suitcase handle.

"I don't need you waiting here with me."

Ethan remained motionless.

Vivian narrowed her eyes.

"If you don't leave now, don't ever show your face around me again!"

Ethan studied her for a few seconds.

"If I go, will you have dinner with me next time?"

Vivian checked her watch.

She had no time for his games.

"Fine."

She gave a dismissive nod.

Only then did Ethan turn away, satisfied.

Sophia Sherwood immediately seized the opportunity.

"Mr. Roscente!"

Her face lit up with a saccharine smile.

"I didn't drive here either when dropping off my friend."

She feigned distress while glancing around.

"Taxis are impossible to find here."

Batting her doe-like eyes, she leaned closer.

"Could you give me a ride?"

Ethan didn't break stride.

"Not on my way."

Sophia hurried after him.

"How could it not be?"

She eagerly recited the address she'd memorized.

"I live near Riverside Avenue."

A deliberate choice—closer to Ethan's residence.

Too bad she didn't know.

He'd already moved to Roscente Manor.

"Still not."

Ethan tossed the words over his shoulder without looking back.

Sophia's smile faltered momentarily.

She quickly recovered.

"That's alright."

Matching his pace, she tilted her head playfully.

"Have you eaten yet, Mr. Roscente?"

Inching nearer, she added casually,

"I've been craving local dishes since returning from abroad—"

"Already did."

Ethan cut her off.

Vivian observed the spectacle from a distance.

She nearly laughed aloud.

Sophia still hadn't given up.

"Well..."

Scrambling for conversation, Sophia tried again.

"There are some work matters I'd like to—"

"Take them to Marketing."

Ethan shut her down.

"Or Simon."

Sophia finally snapped.

She shot Vivian a venomous glare.

Ethan had walked several steps when he suddenly paused.

A fully masked figure rushed toward Vivian.

Though concealed by hats and scarves, the petite frame suggested a young woman.

Ethan exhaled in relief.

Yet an odd discomfort lingered.

So Vivian really was meeting a friend.

"Vivi!"

Fiona Grandelle embraced her tightly.

"Missed you so much!"

Vivian patted her back.

"Let's get you fed."

She grabbed Fiona's luggage.

"Time to taste my cooking."

Fiona nodded eagerly.

"But..."

She glanced around curiously.

"What were you watching earlier?"

Vivian smirked.

"Nothing important."

Leading Fiona away, she shrugged.

"Just a pathetic clown."

Fiona's palms were damp with sweat.

Vivian quickened their pace toward her car.

Meanwhile, Sophia trudged back after failing to catch Ethan.

Squinting at Vivian's retreating figure, she frowned.

Who was that masked woman?

Why hide her face?

Sophia stared at the vanishing taillights,

her mind swirling with questions.
###Chapter 385
Ethan's Meticulous Scheme

Finn barely caught a glimpse of Vivian getting into a car with an unfamiliar girl.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Master?" Finn answered cheerfully.

"Where are you?" Vivian's voice came through the receiver.

"Just wandering around." Finn chuckled. "Miss me already?"

A brief pause.

"Don't come home for the next few days." Vivian was direct. "We're having a female guest. It's inappropriate with you around."

Finn's face fell instantly.

"Who is it? If it's Isabella, I don't mind at all."

"Not her." Vivian's tone was firm. "Just don't scare our guest."

After hanging up, Finn stared blankly at his phone.

He was contemplating which hotel to stay at when his phone buzzed again.

"Mr. Roscente?" Finn answered, puzzled.

"Did you know Vivian went to the airport today?" Ethan cut straight to the point.

Finn sighed. "Just found out. Master banned me from home. I'm practically homeless now."

A soft chuckle came through the line.

"Stay at my place." Ethan offered unexpectedly.

Finn's eyebrows shot up.

"Seriously?"

"I'll text you the address." Ethan was decisive.

Gazing out the window, Ethan pondered. Who could be important enough for Vivian to personally fetch and make Finn avoid?

Meanwhile, Vivian dialed Ryan's number.

"Come over for dinner tonight." She said simply.

Ryan nearly jumped with excitement.

"Dr. Laurent invited me to her home!" He adjusted his collar repeatedly in the mirror.

"Fiona Grandelle is visiting from Eudora." Vivian explained. "Keep her company."

After hanging up, Ryan left immediately.

Standing before Vivian's villa, he looked up at the grand architecture, a pang of bitterness in his heart.

"Dr. Laurent is so accomplished..." He tightened his grip on the gift bag.

The doorbell rang. Vivian answered, wearing an apron.

"Come in." She stepped aside. "Fiona's in the living room."

Ryan sat down awkwardly.

"I'll finish cooking." Vivian turned to leave.

"Need any help?" Ryan stood hastily.

Vivian shook her head. "I promised to cook myself."

The aroma of food wafted from the kitchen, but an uncomfortable silence settled in the living room.
###Chapter 386

Fiona Grandelle tightened her grip on the suitcase handle and took a deep breath outside Vivian Laurent's house. This was her first time traveling abroad alone, and her first time actively seeking help.

The clatter of cooking utensils came from the kitchen where Vivian was preparing dinner. In the living room, Fiona sat across from Ryan Fairsprene in an awkward silence.

"Dinner's ready." Vivian emerged with the final dish. The table was filled with aromatic, beautifully presented dishes.

Fiona stared at the cutlery in front of her, fingers twisting nervously. She hesitated to remove her mask, her gaze darting away.

"Don't be afraid." Vivian gently pressed her hand. "Dr. Fairsprene has seen many similar cases."

Ryan adjusted his glasses. "Indeed. I've worked in the burn unit for five years and treated at least a hundred severe cases."

The mask slid off slowly. Jagged scars were exposed under the light, the uneven tissue covering nearly her entire face. Even with prior knowledge, Ryan's pupils contracted slightly.

"Scar revision surgery is possible," he said calmly. "Dr. Laurent and I will develop a detailed plan."

Fiona's tense shoulders finally relaxed.

"Try this." Vivian ladled soup into each bowl. "I rarely cook."

She remembered three years ago, when she'd prepare elaborate meals daily for Ethan Roscente. That man would always coldly trample on her efforts.

"This is amazing!" Fiona's eyes sparkled like a child discovering treasure.

Ryan nodded in agreement. "I didn't know Dr. Laurent was such a skilled chef."

"I'll ask Emily Garnache to keep you company tomorrow," Vivian suddenly suggested. "The girl who gave you those collectibles."

Fiona recalled the lively figure and smiled unconsciously. "Sounds great."

On the phone, Emily shrieked with excitement. "I'll come first thing tomorrow! I'll bring my limited-edition cosplay outfits!"

In the following days, the two girls became inseparable. Fiona gradually relaxed, occasionally trying on the costumes Emily brought while looking in the mirror.

"I got us Comic Con tickets." Emily waved her phone. "We'll go as a cosplay duo!"

Fiona smiled faintly. For the first time since her injury, she felt pure joy.
###Chapter 387

Ethan Roscente had been in a foul mood lately.

He stared at his phone screen, where Vivian Laurent's chat window remained stubbornly silent. She had promised to have dinner with him, but now she kept brushing him off with excuses.

"What has your mentor been up to?" Ethan turned to Finn Deross, who was sprawled on the couch playing video games.

Finn didn't even glance up. "No idea. She hasn't contacted me in days."

The young man seemed perfectly content wherever he ended up staying.

Ethan frowned. He didn't want to reach out to Vivian directly and risk annoying her, so he nudged Finn to ask instead.

"Hey, can I move back in yet?" Finn asked when Vivian picked up.

"No. My friend is still staying with me," came her crisp reply.

Ethan's expression darkened at the word "friend." Who could possibly be that important?

Meanwhile, Sophia Sherwood wasn't faring any better.

Every attempt to get close to Ethan had failed. She wanted to cause trouble for Vivian but found no openings. Still new to the Roscente Group, she couldn't afford reckless moves.

"Sophia, you won't believe this," she whispered into her phone to Sophia Evans. "Vivian's playing hard to get with Ethan."

She embellished the airport incident she'd witnessed.

"If this continues, she'll steal him away!"

In the Kingdom of Eudora, Sophia Evans paced anxiously. She finally managed to slip away from her minders and secretly booked a flight to C Country.

The news reached Ethan quickly.

"Understood," he said tersely before hanging up and massaging his temples.

Sophia Evans was intercepted the moment her plane landed.

"Ethan!" Her face lit up at the sight of him. "You came to meet me?"

His expression remained impassive. "Theo needs you. Go home."

Her smile froze. She hadn't expected such coldness.

"I came to see Victoria," she insisted. "She's been depressed lately—suicidal even. I'm here to help her."

At the mention of his cousin Victoria Roscente, Ethan's brow furrowed. Since the incident, she had indeed been withdrawn.

"Behave yourself," he warned. "Don't touch what isn't yours."

Sophia's heart ached as if pierced by needles. "Ethan, why are you treating me like this?"

"It's for your own good," he said coldly. "Some people are beyond your reach."
###Chapter 388

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly. Ethan's words were clearly a warning—if she dared lay a finger on Vivian, he wouldn't let it slide.

What she didn't know was that Ethan was actually saving her.

The last person who tried to harm Vivian, Natalie, was still lying in the hospital's intensive care unit.

"Ethan, I never intended to hurt anyone." Sophia clenched the hem of her dress. "I just want what rightfully belongs to me."

In her eyes, Ethan was her possession. It was those shameless women who kept getting in her way.

She loved him madly. Why couldn't she win his heart?

Seeing her stubbornness, Ethan said nothing more.

With Vivian's capabilities, she didn't need his protection. He knew that all too well.

As Ethan turned to leave, Sophia suddenly lunged forward, wrapping her arms tightly around him from behind.

"Ethan, I barely get to see you." She pressed her face against his back, voice choked with emotion. "Have dinner with me, please?"

It had been so long since she'd been this close to him.

Once, she was the only woman allowed near him. Why wouldn't he even look at her now?

Ethan pried her fingers off without hesitation.

He turned and pushed her away, his gaze icy.

"Sophia," he shook his phone, "how do you plan to explain this time?"

The screen displayed a trending hashtag: #SophiaAndEthanAirportEmbrace. The photo showed her clinging to him moments ago.

Sophia's fans were ecstatic: "Ran into Sophia and Mr. Roscente at the airport! Their hug is so sweet!"

"It wasn't me!" Sophia shook her head frantically. "I didn't arrange this, I swear!"

Ethan smirked coldly. "Oh? So you admit you arranged the previous ones?"

Her face paled. She'd slipped up.

"Ethan, let me explain—"

"Save it." He cut her off. "I'll hold a press conference to clarify our relationship once and for all."

He walked away.

Sophia rushed to block his path. "Why do you care now? You never bothered before!"

Tears streamed down her face as she grabbed his sleeve. "Ethan... is there really nothing left between us?"
###Chapter 389

Ethan Roscente walked away without looking back, his retreating figure resolute.

Sophia Evans stood frozen in place, her nails digging deep into her palms. She stared at his distant silhouette, tears welling in her eyes.

One after another, reports of media outlets refusing to cooperate reached her.

"Mr. Roscente's orders. Please don't make this difficult for us," the editor-in-chief on the phone said apologetically.

Sophia hung up, fury burning in her gaze. She was certain this was Ethan's doing—and Vivian Laurent was undoubtedly the mastermind behind it.

In a secluded corner of Roscente Group's headquarters, Sophia Sherwood murmured into her phone, "Remember, this must be pinned on Vivian Laurent."

A sly smile curled her crimson lips, her eyes glinting with calculation.

"Mr. Roscente is far too busy to bother with such trivial matters," Sophia Sherwood's voice carried an unshakable authority. "You know the consequences of crossing Roscente Group."

The media outlets fell silent, quickly agreeing to comply.

When Sophia Evans arrived at the Roscente residence, Victoria Roscente was curled up on the sofa.

"Victoria!" Sophia gasped.

The once radiant heiress of the Roscente family now looked gaunt and hollow-eyed. She trembled as she threw herself into Sophia's arms.

"It's all because of Vivian..." Victoria muttered incoherently.

Sophia gently stroked her back, her gaze icy. "I'll make her pay for this."

After returning to the country, Sophia secretly investigated Vivian.

"There seems to be someone hiding in her home," the private detective handed her photos. "But they never leave the house."

Sophia narrowed her eyes, a plan forming in her mind.

The next morning, she stood at Vivian's doorstep and lightly knocked.

"Anyone home? I'm here for a consultation."

Inside, Fiona Grandelle cowered in fear. She frantically dialed Vivian's number. "Vivian... someone's knocking..."

Vivian frowned. "Don't open the door. I'm on my way."

When Vivian's car pulled into the neighborhood, Sophia was leaning casually against her doorframe.

"To what do I owe this visit, Ms. Evans?" Vivian stepped out, her expression cold.

Sophia straightened, her red lips curving into a dangerous smile. "I heard Dr. Laurent is an exceptional physician. I came for a consultation."
###Chapter 390

Sophia Evans stood at the villa's entrance, her manicured finger pressing the doorbell.

"Dr. Laurent, I haven't been feeling well lately." She flashed a carefully crafted smile. "The medication you prescribed last time worked wonders. Could you examine me again?"

Vivian Laurent opened the door, her gaze icy.

"My apologies. That was a one-time exception." She rested one hand against the doorframe. "I recommend visiting a proper hospital."

A shadow flickered in Sophia's eyes.

"Doctor, are you rejecting me because..." She deliberately trailed off. "You're jealous of something?"

Vivian let out a soft laugh.

"Your imagination is quite vivid, Miss Evans." Her eyes skimmed over Sophia's meticulously applied makeup. "Perhaps you should consider seeing a psychiatrist."

Sophia's expression stiffened.

"This is my private residence." Vivian's voice turned frosty. "If you continue harassing me, I won't hesitate to call security."

Sophia's grip tightened around her handbag.

"How cold of you, Doctor." She forced another smile as she turned away. "I'll visit another time, then."

The black sedan slowly drove out of the gated community but stopped at the corner.

Sophia stared into the rearview mirror, waiting. Vivian never emerged from the villa.

"Just as I thought." Her eyes narrowed. "Who exactly is she hiding inside?"

Upstairs, the curtains trembled slightly.

Fiona Grandelle remained curled by the window until Sophia's car disappeared from view. Only then did she exhale in relief.

"She's gone." Vivian stepped into the room. "Don't worry."

Fiona nodded, her fingers still clutching the curtain fabric.

Vivian gently took her trembling hand.

"No one will hurt you while I'm here."

Three days later, at the comic convention.

Emily Garnache burst into the villa carrying a makeup case.

"Natalie! Today, I'm going to make you the star of the show!" She spun excitedly. "Just wait until I transform you into the most dazzling cosplayer!"

Fiona nervously twisted the hem of her shirt.

"Are you... sure this will work?"

Emily had already unzipped her kit.

"Trust me!" She brandished a foundation brush. "Stage makeup will completely cover the scars."

Vivian leaned against the doorframe, watching Emily work her magic on Fiona's face.

"Relax." She met Fiona's anxious gaze. "I'll be right beside you the whole time."

Layer by layer, the theatrical makeup concealed the marks. The mirror reflected a stunning stranger.

Fiona stared at her reflection in disbelief.

"Is that... really me?"

Emily planted her hands on her hips triumphantly.

"Of course!" She glanced at Vivian. "Though I'm not sure about later..."

Vivian gave a knowing nod.

"I'll handle any unexpected situations."

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating Fiona's transformed face—a face reborn.
###Chapter 391

Emily Garnache set down her makeup brush, admiring her handiwork with satisfaction. The intricate demon makeup perfectly concealed the scars on Fiona Grandelle's face, leaving only a playful charm.

"Check this out!" Emily held up a mirror.

Fiona instinctively flinched away. She never looked at mirrors, and her room contained no reflective surfaces.

When she finally saw her reflection, her breath caught.

Was that girl who looked straight out of a comic book really her? The hideous scars had nearly vanished, replaced by sparkling eyes accentuated by the exquisite makeup.

"Now put this on!" Emily handed over the prepared cosplay outfit.

Standing before the mirror in full costume, Fiona couldn't recognize herself.

"Perfect!" Emily clapped enthusiastically, noticing both the joy in Fiona's eyes and the trembling of her fingers.

"I... should I really go out like this?" Fiona's voice quivered.

Emily threw an arm around her shoulders. "We've got your back!" She turned to Vivian Laurent. "Your turn, Viv!"

Vivian found herself abruptly seated at the vanity. Thirty minutes later, three distinctly styled anime characters stood ready.

None of them noticed Sophia Evans watching intently from her car beneath the villa's shade trees.

"Vivian's been acting so strange lately..." she murmured before quietly following their car.

At the convention center entrance, crowds swarmed. Sophia had barely stepped out when fans recognized her.

"Is that Sophia Evans? Can I get an autograph?"

She coldly pushed away the proffered phone. "You're mistaken." Slamming her car door, she sneered, "How tasteless."

Meanwhile, Fiona stood transfixed by the spectacle. Everywhere she looked, costumed cosplayers proved she wasn't the odd one out.

"Let's take a picture!" "Your makeup is amazing!" Strangers kept approaching her.

Fiona turned helplessly to Vivian.

"Go ahead." Vivian gave her an encouraging nudge. "That's your favorite character, isn't it?"

With Emily cheering her on, Fiona gathered her courage and approached the cosplayer.

"C-can I take a photo with you?" Her voice barely rose above a whisper.

The cosplayer readily agreed, complimenting, "Your costume looks fantastic too!"

Clutching the freshly taken photo, Fiona's eyes grew moist. Was that radiantly smiling girl in the picture truly herself?
###Chapter 392

Fiona's fingers trembled slightly as she finally gathered the courage to ask the cosplayer for a photo together.

Vivian stood at a distance, her phone camera capturing the moment.

She sent the video of Fiona chatting and laughing with strangers to the Queen.

The Queen's reply came swiftly, her excitement palpable through the message.
"My angel is finally living like a normal girl."

Vivian's lips curved into an unconscious smile as she read it.

After the convention, Fiona glowed with newfound radiance.

"I want to try flying commercial," Fiona suddenly suggested on their way back.

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure?"

"Yes." Fiona nodded firmly. "I want to interact with more people."

Emily immediately raised her hand. "I'm coming too! I heard Eudora has this romantic island called—"

Vivian's expression froze at the mention of "romantic island."

"Vivian?" Emily noticed the change instantly.

"Nothing." Vivian quickly schooled her features.

As they arrived at the villa complex, a black Maybach blocked the road.

Ethan leaned against the car, his tall frame casting a long shadow in the sunset.

"Wait in the car," Vivian sighed.

Fiona studied the man curiously. "Who's that?"

Emily's eyes sparkled. "Vivian's ex-husband. But I bet they'll get back together."

"I see." Fiona nodded thoughtfully.

Outside, Ethan straightened and approached Vivian.

"Got time now?" His voice carried a hint of exasperation.

Vivian crossed her arms. "The mighty CEO has nothing better to do?"

"Cleared three meetings just to see you," Ethan chuckled.

Behind the second-floor curtains, two pairs of eyes peeked out.

"They look good together," Fiona whispered.

Emily nodded vigorously. "Told you!"
###Chapter 393 

The roar of an engine approached from the distance.

Ethan Roscente stood in the courtyard, a cigarette burning between his fingers. He lifted his gaze as the familiar sports car came into view.

His breath caught when the door opened.

Vivian Laurent stepped out in black combat boots, her leather mini skirt swaying slightly. Heavy smokey eye makeup accentuated her gaze, with glitter accents at the corners. A pair of devil horn hair clips sparkled atop her head.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

"You—"

"Why are you here again?" Vivian cut him off with a frown, tugging at her skirt self-consciously.

"To see you." His eyes remained glued to her.

She shifted uncomfortably under his stare. "I'm busy. Call me if it's important."

A glance over her shoulder confirmed Fiona Grandelle was still waiting in the car.

Ethan followed her gaze to the tinted windows. "Friend?" His eyes narrowed. "Aren't you going to introduce us?"

"None of your business." Vivian brushed past him. "Move."

He didn't budge. "About that dinner you promised—"

"Not tomorrow."

"The day after?"

"Business trip." She waved him off impatiently. "I'll call you when I'm free."

Ethan chuckled suddenly. He reached out to touch one of her devil horns. "This look suits you."

Only then did Vivian remember she was still in her Comic Convention outfit. Heat rushed to her ears as she slapped his hand away. "Get lost!"

He stumbled back two steps from her push, but his gaze lingered on her flushed cheeks.

Even after getting in his car, the image replayed in his mind. His phone vibrated with a message from Finn Deross.

"Found it. Called cosplay. Popular with young people."

Ethan frowned at the screen. Thirty wasn't old... was it?
###Chapter 394

Ethan Roscente leaned back on the leather sofa, his long fingers tapping the armrest rhythmically.

Finn Deross hugged his laptop while searching for information, the blue screen light reflecting on his face.

"Comic Convention is basically a costume play event. There's one happening in the capital today." Finn adjusted his glasses.

Ethan's eyes flickered. "Find out what Vivian Laurent has been up to lately."

"Again?" Finn pouted.

Ethan shot him a sharp glare. "Remember who pays your rent."

With a resigned sigh, Finn picked up his phone and dialed Vivian's number.

"Master!" Finn instantly switched to pitiful mode. "I'm starving out here..."

Vivian's voice came through the receiver. "Just hold on for two more days."

"Is your friend still around?"

"She's returning to Eudora tomorrow. I'm going with her for a week."

Finn deliberately raised his voice. "You're going to Eudora?"

Ethan immediately leaned closer to the phone, his brows furrowing.

After hanging up, Finn spread his hands. "Heard that? My master's going to Eudora."

Ethan was already grabbing his jacket and heading out.

Two hours later.

A private jet stood on the tarmac as Ethan studied the flight details, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

Meanwhile, at Vivian's apartment.

"He's gone." Vivian drew the curtains shut.

Emily Garnache and Fiona Grandelle emerged from the basement.

"I'll take you to the airport tomorrow," Vivian said.

The next afternoon.

Outside a Michelin-starred restaurant, Sophia Evans lurked across the street.

Her gaze burned into the heavily cloaked figure entering the establishment.

"Who is that..." Sophia muttered under her breath.

She hurried after them but was stopped by a waiter.

"The private dining rooms are fully booked."

Sophia pointed ahead. "Then how did they get in?"

The waiter smiled politely. "Miss Laurent is our diamond member."

"I'm a celebrity too!" Sophia yanked off her mask.

The waiter remained courteous. "Apologies, but we're truly at capacity."

Sophia clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.
###Chapter 395

"I'm sorry, ma'am. All our private dining rooms are fully booked." The waiter maintained his professional smile.

"Open your eyes wide. I'm Sophia Evans!" Sophia yanked off her sunglasses, her flawless makeup gleaming under the lights.

The waiter hesitated briefly before regaining composure. "Miss Evans, we truly have no available private rooms."

"Is this how you treat VIPs?" Sophia drummed her manicured nails on the marble tabletop. "Shall I call your manager?"

"We do have window seats available in the main dining area if you'd like to wait."

Sophia scoffed and reluctantly moved toward a corner table. She lowered her voice threateningly. "If word gets out about my presence here, expect a lawsuit from my legal team."

"Guest privacy is our top priority." The waiter handed her a menu.

Sophia flipped through the menu impatiently, her gaze fixed on the VIP section upstairs. She needed to uncover Vivian's scheme.

"Miss... Miss Sophia?" A ponytailed server approached excitedly. "Is it really you?"

Sophia's eyes gleamed as she switched to a sweet smile. "Yes, darling. Would you like an autograph?"

"I'm your biggest fan!" The young girl blushed. "Could we take a photo together?"

"Of course." Sophia pulled her closer conspiratorially. "But first, could you do me a tiny favor?"

"What kind?"

Sophia whispered, "My boyfriend Ethan Roscente is being harassed by some gold digger. She's in one of your private rooms upstairs. Could you check what she's up to?"

The server hesitated. "That's... against policy."

"Help your big sister out." Sophia's eyes welled with tears. "We've been together seven years. Should I just watch some homewrecker destroy my happiness?"

"But..."

"I'll give you VIP tickets to my concert next week." Sophia produced a signed photo from her purse. "With a personal dedication. Deal?"

The server bit her lip, glancing between the autograph and the second floor. Sophia pressed her advantage. "Backstage meet-and-greet too. Imagine the likes on your socials."

"Just... one quick look?"

Sophia's victorious smile returned. "Get clear shots of her with that man."
###Chapter 396

Sophia Evans' fan bit her lip nervously, fingers twisting the edge of her apron.

"That private dining room..." Her voice trembled. "It's the owner's exclusive area. I'll lose my job if I go in without permission."

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

"The owner?" She repeated softly, her nails absently scraping against her coffee cup.

Did Vivian Laurent have some special connection with this restaurant?

"Come work at my studio." Sophia suddenly smiled brightly. "Five thousand a month, and you'll get to see me every day."

The fan's eyes instantly lit up.

"Really?" She gasped. "What... what do I need to do?"

Sophia lowered her voice. "Just take one photo for me."

Ten minutes later.

The fan walked toward the private room with forced composure. The manager stood guard like a sentry at the door.

"Manager!" She called out suddenly. "There's a VIP asking for you!"

The manager frowned. "Who?"

"I think..." She whispered. "It's that A-list actor."

The manager hesitated, glancing at the closed door before finally walking away.

The fan's heart pounded wildly. With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone and pushed the door open just a crack.

Click.

She nearly screamed when the flash went off.

Laughter spilled from inside the room. Not from two people, but a whole group.

She slammed the door shut and fled back to Sophia.

"Did you get it?" Sophia grabbed her wrist urgently.

The fan handed over the phone. "There were several people inside..."

Sophia snatched the phone, staring intently at the screen.

The photo was slightly blurred, but clearly showed Vivian Laurent raising a glass with a smile, surrounded by three men and two women.

"This is..." Her pupils constricted sharply.
###Chapter 397

The waiter handed over the phone. The screen displayed a photo of Vivian Laurent and Fiona Grandelle together.

Sophia Evans' pupils constricted sharply.

Fiona's face was covered in hideous scars, as if ravaged by fire. Even in the blurry photo, the twisted marks were unmistakable.

She sucked in a sharp breath.

No wonder this woman never showed her face. With such disfigurement, anyone would hide from the world.

A cold smirk curled Sophia's lips.

She had finally found Vivian's weakness.

A vibration interrupted her thoughts. A message from Sophia Sherwood flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Roscente changed his schedule. He's flying to Eudora tomorrow."

Sophia tapped her fingers lightly against the phone.

Eudora? To see Theo, no doubt.

She immediately dialed the airline.

"Check if there are any first-class seats left for tomorrow's flight to Eudora."

After hanging up, Sophia adjusted her makeup in the mirror.

Staged encounters were her specialty.

As for Vivian...

She glanced at the photo again and scoffed.

Plenty of time to deal with her after returning from Eudora.

Right now, seizing this opportunity was paramount.

Sophia Sherwood soon sent the flight details.

Sophia Evans quickly booked her ticket and began packing.

She imagined "accidentally" running into Ethan Roscente on the plane.

This time, she would make him fall for her again.

Little Theo was the perfect excuse.

Humming, she carefully packed her cosmetics.

The mirror reflected her confident, triumphant smile.
###Chapter 398

Emily Garnache hummed cheerfully as she packed her suitcases. Both large bags were stuffed to the brim. She kept checking her phone for travel guides about the Kingdom of Eudora.

"I'm going to enjoy this trip to the fullest!" She twirled in front of the mirror, admiring her new dress.

Vivian Laurent sorted through medical files, repeatedly reviewing Fiona Grandelle's case history. She glanced at the clock before calling Isabella Langley.

"Please take care of the lab while I'm away."

Isabella's cheerful laughter came through the phone. "Don't worry about a thing. If we can cure the princess, our institute will make headlines!"

"I hope so." Vivian rubbed her temples. "But her alter ego hasn't appeared again. It makes me uneasy."

"You're overthinking it." Isabella dismissed her concern. "That person at the bar might have just been a lookalike."

After hanging up, Vivian stared out the window. A plane streaked across the night sky, its wing lights flickering.

The next morning, Vivian woke with a persistent twitch in her right eye. She pressed her eyelid, an inexplicable unease settling in.

"Sis, look at my new sunscreen!" Emily burst into the room waving bottles.

Fiona Grandelle stood quietly by the door, a fairytale book in her hands. Sunlight danced across her golden hair through the curtains.

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente sat in his car en route to the airport. He kept checking Vivian's flight details on his phone, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"I'll say it's a chance meeting," he murmured, fingers tapping the armrest.

In the VIP lounge, Vivian reviewed medical records. Outside the glass doors, Sophia Evans froze.

Her boarding pass crumpled in her trembling grip as she stared at Vivian's profile. The diamond ring on Vivian's left hand glinted unmistakably.

"So that's how it is..." Sophia's nails dug into her palms. She turned toward the restroom, her reflection pale in the mirror.

The faucet ran as icy water rushed over her shaking hands. Sophia looked up suddenly, her lips twisting into a grotesque smile.

"This time, I won't let you win."
###Chapter 399 

The boarding announcement echoed through the VIP lounge where Vivian Laurent and her companions were enjoying tea.

Sophia Evans seized the opportunity to board first. Ethan Roscente stood at the gate, his gaze locked on the lounge entrance.

In first class, Sophia located her seat. A cold smirk curled her lips as she scanned the cabin.

"Heaven helps those who help themselves," she murmured.

The image of the disfigured girl beside Vivian flashed in her mind, igniting a vicious glint in her eyes.

"Let's see you escape at thirty thousand feet."

......

Vivian emerged from the lounge with Fiona Grandelle and Emily Garnache.

Ethan's imposing figure dominated the boarding area.

"What a coincidence," he greeted.

Vivian frowned. "Are you stalking me?"

Ethan spread his hands. "Business in Eudora."

"Vivi, is this your boyfriend?" Fiona suddenly asked.

Vivian turned in surprise. It was the princess's first time initiating conversation with a stranger.

"He's not," Vivian stated firmly.

Ethan's lips quirked upward, clearly pleased by the title.

Emily tactfully pulled Fiona away. "Let's find our seats."

Once alone, Vivian glared. "Spreading rumors again?"

"Wrongfully accused." Ethan feigned innocence. "I've never met her."

Vivian hesitated. She hadn't mentioned Ethan to Fiona.

"Don't bother me in Eudora," she warned.

"You still owe me dinner—"

"One more word and you'll never get that date!" Vivian spun on her heel.

Fiona's surgery couldn't afford any distractions.
###Chapter 400

"What brings you to Eudora?" Ethan Roscente turned his head to ask.

Vivian Laurent's tone held secrets. This was no ordinary trip.

"None of your business." Vivian coldly averted her gaze.

She couldn't tell Ethan about Fiona Grandelle.

Sophia Evans was back in their home country. Nothing should go wrong.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. Her words stabbed like knives.

Would he have the right to ask if they were still married?

Vivian ascended the boarding stairs first. Ethan followed closely behind.

Sophia hid in a corner, watching them. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

In first class, Emily Garnache sat by the aisle, eyes closed.

Sophia's seat happened to be directly behind her.

A perfect opportunity.

She pulled her hat low to avoid recognition.

After takeoff, Sophia pressed the call button.

"Bring me freshly boiled water." Her voice was hushed.

The flight attendant hesitated. "That temperature could cause burns."

"I want it scalding hot." Sophia's gaze turned sharp. "The hotter the better."

The attendant nodded and retreated.

Sophia stood, pretending to visit the restroom.

Ethan glanced up from his documents. A familiar gait caught his eye.

It resembled Sophia's walk.

But Sophia should be in their home country.

He shook his head and returned to his papers.

Sophia lingered near the lavatory, waiting.

As the attendant passed with the water, she deliberately collided.

"Watch out!"

Boiling liquid splashed toward Fiona.

"Ah—"

Fiona reacted too late. Scalding water hit her face.

Instinctively, she tore off her mask.

Her shocking features were revealed.

Ethan turned at the scream. His pupils contracted.

Every eye in first class locked onto the scene.

The air froze.
###Chapter 401

"Oh my God! That face..."

"It's horrifying. I almost screamed."

The hushed whispers in first class pierced Fiona Grandelle's ears like needles. She curled into her seat, fingers digging into her palms.

"Ahhh—" A blood-curdling scream erupted from her throat.

"Get away! All of you!" Fiona flailed wildly, her nails screeching against the leather seats.

Vivian Laurent moved swiftly to intervene.

"Fiona, look at me!"

But Fiona was beyond reason. She pressed herself against the cold cabin wall as if trying to disappear.

"Your face needs treatment." Vivian kept her voice low. "That liquid might be corrosive."

"Liar! You're all liars!" Fiona clawed at her own face, leaving angry red marks.

Commotion spread through business class.

"What's happening up front?"

"Some disfigured lunatic is causing a scene."

"Is the airline insane? Letting someone like that on board!"

Protests grew louder. Flight attendants tried to calm passengers but found themselves surrounded.

"We demand another flight!"

"What if she attacks someone?"

"People like her don't belong in public!"

Each cruel word struck Fiona like a physical blow. Trembling violently, she dug her nails deeper into her cheeks. Blood dripped onto the pristine white upholstery.

"I'm not... I'm not..." Her whisper drowned in the sea of accusations.

Economy class passengers pushed forward for a better look.

"Let me see the freak!"

"Her face is rotting. Disgusting!"

"The airline owes us compensation!"

Fiona's screams reached a fever pitch. She grabbed a blanket and buried her face in it, her entire body shaking uncontrollably.

Vivian stood nearby, her expression grim. The angry blisters forming on Fiona's exposed neck told her everything she needed to know.
###Chapter 402

Vivian Laurent seized Fiona Grandelle's wrist with sudden force.

"Stop this!"

Fiona's nails had already dug deep into Vivian's hand, drawing blood that trickled down her pale skin.

Vivian didn't even flinch.

"I'm not crazy..." Fiona's voice broke into fragments. "Why is this happening to me..."

The murmur of passengers grew louder.

"Someone like her should be locked up!"

"How did the airline let her board?"

"What if she has another episode?"

Sophia Evans hid behind the crowd, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

She deliberately raised her voice. "With that terrifying face, she shouldn't be in public. Is she contagious?"

The words stabbed Fiona like daggers.

"I'm not sick!" Fiona screamed hysterically.

Vivian acted instantly, delivering a precise chop to Fiona's neck.

Fiona collapsed limply into Vivian's arms.

Vivian carefully settled her into a seat.

"Bring cold water and a towel," she ordered without looking up.

Ethan Roscente immediately went to fetch a flight attendant.

Only then did Vivian lift her gaze, her eyes sharp as blades sweeping across the cabin.

"Sophia Evans."

She crossed the distance in three quick strides.

Slap!

A resounding crack echoed through the cabin.

Sophia's head snapped sideways, her mask dislodged.

"That was for Fiona."

Vivian's voice could freeze hell itself.

The cabin fell into stunned silence.

Everyone stood frozen, shocked by the sudden violence.
###Chapter 403

Sophia Evans' cheek burned with searing pain, her ears ringing. Her eyes widened in disbelief.

"You dare hit me!"

"A slap is too lenient." Vivian Laurent's eyes blazed with fury. "A viper like you belongs in hell."

Fiona Grandelle was gentle and kind, yet she'd encountered this venomous snake.

Vivian didn't know why Sophia was here, but it was clearly premeditated.

That scalding water had been aimed at Fiona—but the real target was Vivian herself.

Beneath Sophia's beautiful face festered a rotten heart.

Vivian raised her hand again.

This time Sophia reacted swiftly, gripping her wrist. "How dare you!"

But Vivian's other hand was already in motion.

Slap!

The sharp crack of the blow echoed through the cabin.

"Another cup of boiling water, please." Vivian's voice was ice as she addressed the flight attendant.

She would make Sophia taste the same agony.

"It was an accident!" Sophia shrieked, rubbing her reddened cheek, tears welling. "I didn't know you were on this flight! I don't even know that woman!"

Her voice trembled. "I just asked for hot water—the attendant spilled it!"

Vivian wanted to strangle this lying creature.

A national sweetheart? More like a cobra.

Sophia must have known Fiona's appearance and set this trap.

Denial meant nothing. Evidence would speak.

"Sophia?" Ethan Roscente returned with cold water, his brow furrowed.

He'd recognized that figure.

"Ethan!" Sophia flung herself at him. "You saw it, right? It truly was an accident!"

Tears spilled on cue.

"I just woke up and asked for water. The attendant bumped into me near the lavatory. How is it my fault?"

"Vivian's framing me! Why would I hurt some stranger?"

Once, Ethan might have believed her—even a little.

Now, that tear-streaked face only reeked of deceit.

The more she played innocent, the guiltier she seemed.

"An accident? You're innocent?" Vivian's laugh was razor-sharp. "Do you think we're fools?"

The trembling flight attendant whispered, "It was my fault... but the lady did knock my arm..."

Her voice faded, face ghostly pale.
###Chapter 404

Sophia Evans clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. "That's a blatant lie! She was the one who didn't hold it steady. Why pin it on me? I don't even know that passenger—why would I spill anything on her?" Her voice was shrill, but her eyes darted nervously.

Vivian Laurent smirked. Who would believe such a pathetic lie?

The flight attendant's eyes were red, her shoulders trembling slightly. Vivian handed her a tissue. "Go rest in the lounge. I'll handle this."

Grateful, the attendant nodded and hurried away. Vivian followed, whispering something to her.

Sophia craned her neck but couldn't catch the words. She only saw the attendant pause abruptly before heading to the beverage station.

"Sophia," Vivian said, returning and tapping the armrest with her fingertips. "Do you really think stubborn denial will get you out of this?"

Sophia gloated inwardly. She had recorded everything on her phone, even capturing Fiona Grandelle's furious outburst in perfect detail. Once the video went viral, she'd claim it was filmed by a fan. Ruining Fiona's reputation while playing the victim—what a perfect plan.

Suddenly, she removed her mask, revealing her swollen cheek. Tears welled up instantly. "Ethan..." Her voice trembled. "I only bumped into the flight attendant by accident, but Vivian insists on framing me..."

Ethan Roscente frowned.

"Stop pretending," Vivian snapped, slapping away Sophia's hand as she reached for Ethan. "Weren't you staking out my apartment last time to track Fiona's movements?"

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "You harassed Vivian?"

"I was just there for a medical consultation!" Sophia sobbed, her tears streaking her mascara. "Why do you always believe her over me?"

Just then, the flight attendant returned with a cup of water. Vivian took it—then flipped her wrist.

"Ah!" Sophia shrieked, leaping up as scalding water cascaded down her neck and into her collar, reddening her skin.

Vivian shook the empty cup. "Oops, my hand slipped." Her lips curved. "But someone as magnanimous as you wouldn't hold a grudge over a little accident, right?"

Sophia gasped in pain, her perfectly styled hair now soaked and clinging to her face, her smudged mascara making her look like a drowned rat.

Ethan turned away, his shoulders shaking suspiciously.
###Chapter 1

The cabin lights glowed dimly as Sophia Evans' scream shattered the silence.

"You did this on purpose!" Her crimson nails nearly grazed Vivian Laurent's nose.

Vivian sidestepped with icy detachment.

Sophia's expression melted into tears when she turned to Ethan Roscente. "Ethan, look what she did to my face—"

"Enough." Ethan stepped back with a frown.

Commotion rose from the economy class as flight attendants calmed startled passengers.

"You always take her side!" Sophia's voice trembled.

Vivian raised her phone. "I'll get the evidence."

Fiona Grandelle lay pale against her seat.

After landing, Vivian brushed Fiona's forehead.

"Stay at my place." Ethan offered a black card.

Vivian looked up. "Do you know who she is?"

He shook his head.

"The princess of Eudora." Vivian enunciated each word.

Ethan's pupils constricted.

"You can't protect her this time." Vivian lifted Fiona.

After a pause, Ethan said, "I won't."

Nearby, Sophia stomped her heels with a screech.

"She'll pay." Ethan turned toward the exit.

Vivian tightened her grip around the unconscious girl, watching him leave.
###Chapter 406

Ethan Roscente frowned at the unconscious Fiona Grandelle, his slender fingers tapping the armrest.

"Are you sure you want to present her to the king like this? What will the royal family think?"

Vivian Laurent bit her lower lip, considering his words. He had a point.

"I have an apartment near the airport," Ethan suggested. "Let's take her there to rest first. We can decide our next steps when she wakes up."

After a brief hesitation, Vivian nodded. "Thank you. I appreciate it."

A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan's eyes. Usually, Vivian met him with cold indifference or outright dismissal. This rare politeness was unexpected.

"There's no need for formalities between us," he said, the corner of his lips lifting slightly.

"Who said we're close?" Vivian retorted, though the tips of her ears turned pink.

Unfazed, Ethan led the group outside. His driver was already waiting at the airport entrance. When Vivian moved to carry Fiona, Ethan stepped in. "I'll do it."

With Vivian's slender frame, she'd likely collapse after a few steps.

Vivian didn't argue. Fiona was unconscious—she wouldn't know who carried her anyway.

At the boarding gate, Ethan turned to the flight attendants, his voice icy. "If I see even a single word about this online, you'll regret it."

Nearby, Sophia Evans gripped her suitcase handle so tightly her knuckles turned white. She watched Ethan shield Vivian as they walked away, her nails digging into her palms.

That bitch had stolen Ethan's heart completely.

But she refused to accept defeat.

Inside the black Maybach, Vivian quickly texted Isabella Langley. "I need you to look into someone. Urgently."

"Who pissed you off now?" came the instant reply.

Vivian wanted Sophia's recent movements tracked. She suspected Sophia had recognized Fiona and deliberately caused the scene on the plane.

With someone as unhinged as Sophia, the only solution was a decisive strike.

"Leave it to me," Isabella replied furiously after hearing the details. "That psycho has a death wish! Always acting all sweet and innocent while pulling disgusting stunts behind the scenes!"

"She's asking for it. Once I have proof, let's see how she wriggles out of this one."

Isabella's rage practically radiated through the screen. Women like Sophia were the worst—venomous snakes hiding behind angelic facades.

Soon, the car pulled into an upscale residential complex.

Emily Garnache had been in a daze the entire time. Sheltered all her life, she'd never experienced anything like this. Even after getting out of the car, her fingers trembled slightly.

Ethan gently laid Fiona on the living room sofa. Vivian suddenly spoke up. "She's wary of strangers. Could you—"

Before she could finish, Ethan understood. No wonder Finn Deross had been kicked out of Vivian's place before.
###Chapter 407

Ethan Roscente tactfully excused himself.

"Call me if you need anything."

Vivian Laurent nodded in acknowledgment.

Emily Garnache returned with a basin of water, a towel soaked in cold liquid. Her eyes reddened at the sight of Fiona Grandelle's swollen cheek.

"Vivian, should I go buy some medicine?"

"Use ice first." Vivian unlocked her phone. "I'll order delivery."

"I'll borrow ice from the neighbors." Emily stood up. "No one lives here permanently. The fridge is empty."

"Be careful."

"Don't worry. I speak Eudoran."

Emily hurried out. Vivian's gaze lingered on Fiona when her phone vibrated.

Isabella Langley's message appeared: "Got it."

Vivian immediately called back.

"That bitch Sophia Evans!" Isabella spat through gritted teeth. "She's been stalking you."

A video arrived on Vivian's phone.

The footage showed Sophia lurking behind them, lingering outside the restaurant. After being denied entry to the private dining room, she bribed a waiter to secretly film them.

"The waiter is her fan. Now he's scared and begging us not to press charges."

"We will." Vivian's voice turned glacial. "But go easy on him. Just teach him a lesson."

"What about Sophia? That bitch must have followed you onto the flight!"

Isabella's fury crackled through the receiver. "Let me handle her!"

"Calm down. This isn't—"

"Sophia Evans?"

A chilling female voice interrupted.

Vivian whirled around.

Fiona had sat up without warning. Gone was the usual timidity in her eyes—only piercing coldness remained.

This wasn't Fiona.

Vivian's chest tightened. The girl from the bar that night had returned—Fiona's alternate personality.

"Fiona, you—"

"Don't call me that." The girl smirked. "That weak, pathetic waste doesn't deserve to share my name."
###Chapter 408

"What's your name?" Fiona Grandelle stared at her reflection in the mirror.

Beneath that familiar face hid an entirely different soul. The prolonged silence had almost convinced her their encounter at the bar that night was just a hallucination.

"Killer." The reflection curled its lips into a cold smirk.

She despised the original owner of this body. That spineless coward who couldn't even fight back—who would cower in a corner after having hot soup thrown at her.

"Killer?" Vivian Laurent arched a brow. The name suited her, just like the lethal precision she'd shown with a gun that night.

The burn scars still marred Killer's face, but they couldn't conceal the sharp edge in her bones. Royal blood ran thick—even disfigurement couldn't erase the innate aura of nobility.

"Sophia Evans, was it?"

Killer's tongue flicked over her canine, eyes glinting with bloodlust.

Vivian immediately seized her wrist. "Don't even think about it."

If this lunatic went on a killing spree now, tomorrow's headlines would be all about royal scandal. Bullets were easy—cleaning up the aftermath wasn't.

"That idiot would just cry when people called her ugly." Killer shook off Vivian's grip. "Waste of oxygen."

"She was just too kind."

"Kind?" Killer suddenly grabbed Vivian by the throat. "If you hadn't interfered—"

The sound of the door unlocking cut her off. Emily Garnache rushed in with an ice pack, beaming as she headed for Fiona. "Here, put this on!"

She was met with a gaze as sharp as a blade.

"Fiona?" Emily froze. She'd never seen her best friend wear such a terrifying expression.

Vivian stepped between them. "She just woke up. Still unstable."

"Don't listen to those idiots." Emily reached for Killer's hand. "You'll always be the most beautiful princess to me."

The moment Killer shoved her away, Vivian hissed under her breath, "Play along if you want to stay invisible."

The glare of the mirror hid the darkness in Killer's eyes. It was true—even the king didn't know another soul lived inside this body.
###Chapter 409

Emily Garnache reached out with concern, her fingers hovering near Fiona Grandelle's face. "Does it still hurt? Should we apply something?"

Fiona's cheeks remained flushed an unnatural shade of red.

Vivian Laurent handed an ice pack to Emily. "Take care of her. I'll handle this."

Killer watched Vivian with narrowed eyes, suspicion burning in her gaze.

She didn't trust this woman. Anyone who could break through Fiona's defenses was dangerous.

"Don't worry," Emily murmured soothingly. "Vivian always keeps her word."

Killer scoffed, amused by Emily's naivety.

Vivian strode out of the room and immediately dialed Ethan Roscente.

"I've sent you the surveillance footage and statements," she said, her voice icy. "Sophia Evans won't get away with this."

Ethan's tone was laced with worry. "Where are you now?"

Vivian slid into her car. "Going to see her."

Meanwhile, chaos reigned in Sophia Evans' mansion.

"Useless! All of you!" she shrieked at the beauticians. "If my face is ruined, you'll pay for it!"

One beautician stammered, "Miss Evans, burns take time to heal—"

"Get out!" Sophia hurled a cosmetic bottle at the door.

She glared at her reflection, her swollen face twisting with rage. "Vivian Laurent, just you wait."

Suddenly, commotion erupted downstairs.

Before Sophia could react, her door flew open.

Vivian stood in the doorway, her expression glacial.

"Perfect timing," she said, her lips curling into a cold smile as she took in Sophia's disheveled state.
###Chapter 410

Sophia Evans had just put on her face mask when a strange noise came from the living room.

She turned sharply, meeting Vivian Laurent's icy gaze.

"How did you get in?" Sophia's voice trembled as she secretly activated her phone's recording function.

This was a high-security luxury residence where even a fly couldn't enter unnoticed.

Yet Vivian appeared before her like a ghost.

"You recognized her at the restaurant, didn't you?" Vivian advanced step by step. "That airplane incident was all your doing."

Sophia retreated half a step, her face stiffening beneath the mask.

"What nonsense are you talking about?" She forced composure. "I don't understand this restaurant and airplane business."

"The waiter already confessed." Vivian's冷笑 was glacial. "The photos are with the police now."

Sophia's heart plummeted.

She hadn't expected Vivian to move this fast.

"The waiter took those photos himself." She lifted her chin defiantly. "Does Ethan know you're slandering me like this?"

Crack!

A slap landed across her face.

The face mask fell away.

"You're insane!" Sophia screamed, lunging forward.

Vivian sidestepped and kicked her to the ground.

A stiletto heel crushed Sophia's hand mercilessly.

"Go kneel and apologize to her." Vivian's voice cut like a blade.

"Never!" Sophia gasped in pain.

Her peripheral vision caught the phone still recording.

A plan formed in her mind.

"You're just jealous." She suddenly burst into tears. "Jealous that Ethan loves me... That's why you're tormenting me..."

Tears streamed down her flawless cheeks.

Vivian gripped her chin. "Let's see how you'll act with this face ruined."

Sophia trembled violently.

She deliberately wailed louder, ensuring the phone captured every sound.

"Do what you want." She sobbed dramatically. "Ethan only has eyes for me anyway..."

Her fingers secretly pressed the save button behind her back.
###Chapter 411

Sophia Evans knelt on the floor, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"It's all my fault. I'll do anything to make you forgive me," she said with a trembling voice. "My acting career depends on this face..."

She subtly adjusted her phone angle to capture the perfect shot.

With some editing, this video would become evidence of Vivian Laurent bullying her.

After years in the entertainment industry, Sophia knew exactly how to manipulate public opinion.

She had ruined countless competitors using the same tactics.

"Vivian, I'll go apologize right now. Please stop tormenting me," Sophia sobbed pitifully.

Vivian stared coldly at her. "You're the one who should apologize. Why does it look like I'm bullying you?"

She demanded Sophia kneel and apologize to Fiona Grandelle.

Whether Fiona forgave her was another matter.

"You're stepping on me so hard..." Sophia whimpered pathetically.

Vivian withdrew her foot, suspicious of Sophia's quick compliance.

Hurried footsteps suddenly approached from outside.

"Vivian!"

Ethan Roscente arrived looking travel-worn.

"What are you doing here?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"I heard you came to see her. I was worried." Ethan's gaze swept over the disheveled Sophia.

"About me or about her?"

Ethan didn't answer, his eyes fixed on Sophia.

The once-glamorous celebrity now looked utterly pathetic.

"How did it go?" he asked quietly.

"She agreed to apologize," Vivian said.

Ethan frowned.

Knowing Sophia, she would never admit wrongdoing so easily.

Seeing Ethan, Sophia burst into louder sobs.

"Ethan..." she choked out between tears.

The man who once doted on her now regarded her with terrifying coldness.

"I've already admitted my mistake. What more do you want?" Sophia sniffled. "Please stop hitting me..."

Ethan strode forward.

Sophia reached out expectantly.

Instead, he bent down and picked up her phone.

The screen lit up, showing an active recording.

Sophia's face turned deathly pale.
###Chapter 412

Sophia's face turned deathly pale as she lunged for the phone. "Ethan! Don't touch that!"

Ethan had already unlocked the screen.

The video recording interface clearly displayed a blinking red dot.

"Explain." Ethan turned the phone toward Sophia, his gaze icy.

Vivian glimpsed the screen and instantly understood Sophia's scheme.

So that was it.

No wonder she'd been putting on that pitiful act earlier—she'd been secretly recording.

Sophia twisted her fingers together. "I just... I was afraid she'd attack me..."

Ethan gave a cold laugh and opened the gallery.

There was the in-flight recording of Fiona Grandelle's profile, captured in perfect clarity.

The most recent video showed Sophia weeping dramatically while pleading, "Please don't hit me."

If this footage went viral with some inflammatory captions, Vivian would instantly become public enemy number one.

"Sophia Evans." Ethan spoke each word with deliberate precision. "Do you take me for a fool?"

He swiftly deleted all the videos.

Now he finally saw the truth.

Those so-called "candid paparazzi shots," those press releases about "forgiving her attackers with grace"—all carefully staged performances.

Even those "scandalous photos" of them together had likely been orchestrated by Sophia herself.

"Ethan, you've got it all wrong, I was just—"

Ethan cut her off with a raised hand. "Effective immediately, I'm withdrawing all support from your team."

"What?" Sophia's head jerked up.

"Not another cent for your expenses." Ethan's sharp gaze pinned her. "If I catch you pulling another stunt—"

He paused meaningfully. "Especially against Vivian."

Sophia grabbed his sleeve desperately. "You can't do this! I'm—"

"Security." Ethan shook her off and took Vivian's hand. "Keep an eye on her."

In the hallway, Vivian yanked her hand back. "What was that about?"

Ethan turned. "Hmm?"

"I came here to settle scores." Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Did you drag me out because you thought I'd hurt her?"

Ethan shook his head. "Do whatever you want with her."

He stepped closer. "Want a public apology? Or..."

Vivian studied the man before her with raised eyebrows.

It seemed he'd finally seen Sophia for who she really was.
###Chapter 413

"Let her apologize first. We'll see how Fiona reacts."

The old Fiona might have laughed it off. But this was Killer now. Sophia had picked the wrong time to provoke her.

Killer's identity worked in their favor. At least Sophia would pay for what she'd done.

"Should I drive you home?" Ethan asked.

Vivian considered refusing, but hailing a cab seemed tedious. Ethan's car was right outside—might as well take it.

"Tell Sophia to crawl here and apologize by tonight," Vivian said coldly from the passenger seat. "Or this isn't over."

Ethan nodded. "I'll arrange it immediately."

......

Inside the villa, Sophia collapsed onto the floor, screaming hysterically.

Her hair was disheveled, making her look like a patient from an asylum.

Jealousy and hatred had twisted her into something monstrous. She writhed on the ground like a venomous snake.

Upstairs, Theo trembled in fear. He'd witnessed everything but didn't dare come down.

Only after everyone left did he timidly approach Sophia. "Mommy..."

He reached out with his small hand, lightly touching her shoulder.

"Get away from me!" Sophia slapped him without turning around.

The three-year-old couldn't withstand the blow. He fell hard, his forehead bruising from the impact.

"Mommy, please stop..." Theo crawled toward her despite the pain.

Sophia's eyes were bloodshot. "I'm not your mother! You should all die!"

Theo burst into terrified sobs. "Mom—"

Before he could finish, Sophia suddenly grabbed his throat.

"H—help..." Theo's face turned crimson instantly.

A vicious glint flashed in Sophia's eyes. This wasn't her child—just a Roscente bastard. She'd raised him for years, and this was how the family repaid her.

Strangling him wouldn't weigh on her conscience.

"Ms. Evans!" A maid rushed in and pried Sophia away in horror.

Theo collapsed, gasping for air.

"Call a doctor!" The maid scooped him up while dialing Ethan's number.

Ethan slammed on the brakes.

"Emergency. I can't take you home." His voice was tense. The maid said Sophia had nearly strangled Theo—had the woman lost her mind?

"Did she kill herself?" Vivian arched a brow.

"No." Ethan unbuckled his seatbelt swiftly.

Vivian moved to exit, but Ethan was already stepping out.

"Take the car. I'll treat you to dinner another time to make up for this." He flagged down a taxi.

Vivian smirked. Who wanted to eat with him? The man's audacity was astounding.
###Chapter 414

Ethan Roscente heard Theo Evans' heart-wrenching sobs before he even reached Sophia Evans' residence.

"Theo." His deep voice carried through the hallway.

The little boy stumbled into his arms, face flushed from crying. "Uncle Ethan..."

Ethan lifted the child effortlessly, patting his back. "Where does it hurt? Tell me."

Theo shook his head between sniffles. "Not hurt... But Mommy..."

He couldn't understand why his mother had suddenly become so terrifying. Those hands around his neck had felt cold—like a stranger's.

"Mommy would never hurt you." Ethan's voice was steady.

Theo buried his face in Ethan's shoulder with a quiet whimper.

Once the boy calmed down, Ethan set him down. "I need to talk with Mommy."

Small fingers clutched his sleeve. Theo looked up with tear-clumped lashes. "Don't be mad at Mommy... She works so hard..."

The plea stabbed Ethan's heart. How could Sophia harm such an understanding child?

"Grown-up problems are for grown-ups to solve." He crouched to Theo's level. "Want to stay at my place for a few days?"

Theo's eyes brightened before dimming again. "But Mommy will be lonely..."

"Mommy has things to handle." Ethan ruffled his hair. "Just one day with me, okay?"

After a long hesitation, the boy nodded.

Ethan settled Theo in another room before pushing open the bedroom door. Sophia sat before her vanity applying ointment, ignoring the intrusion.

"Sophia Evans." His voice turned glacial.

The woman spun around, eyes lighting up. "Ethan! I knew you'd come back—"

"Why hurt Theo?" Ethan cut her off. "Have you forgotten how fragile he was at birth?"

Sophia's expression froze. So this was about the brat.

"My son, my rules." Her sudden laugh bordered on hysteria. "He's lucky I didn't snap his neck."

Ethan's pupils constricted. The woman before him was unrecognizable.

"Theo's coming with me." He turned away. "Contact me first if you want to see him."

This madwoman could snap any moment. His late brother's only heir wouldn't be sacrificed to her deranged version of motherhood.

Where he'd once respected their bond, now he saw only toxicity that would destroy the child.
###Chapter 415

"Ethan Roscente, what gives you the right to take Theo away?" Sophia Evans shrieked hysterically.

"Blood and responsibility." Ethan lifted the child with an impassive expression. "I won't let him stay with a madwoman."

Theo clung to Ethan's neck, tears welling in his large eyes. He peeked at Sophia but flinched at her distorted expression.

"You're insane!" Sophia grabbed a vase from the coffee table and smashed it against the floor. "What poison has that bitch Vivian Laurent fed you?"

Shards flew as Ethan shielded Theo, stepping back.

"Apologize to Vivian." His voice turned glacial. "This is your last chance."

Sophia suddenly stilled, lips curling unnaturally. "Fine. I'll go."

As two bodyguards escorted her out, she concealed a comedone extractor in her sleeve. The sharp needle glinted coldly under the light.

"I'll wipe that smile off her face," she vowed silently.

Meanwhile, in Vivian's apartment.

Emily Garnache fidgeted nervously, stealing glances at the girl called Killer on the sofa. Once vibrant, the girl now sat motionless like a porcelain doll, her breathing barely audible.

"Vivian!" Emily lunged toward the door like a drowning woman grasping at straws. "She's terrifying..."

Vivian patted her shoulder. "Go rest."

Only after Emily reluctantly closed the bedroom door did Killer lift her eyelids. "Finished playing detective?"

Vivian sat across from her. "I've confirmed one thing at least."

"Oh?"

"You're more dangerous than I imagined." Vivian met her gaze unflinchingly. "But I'm not afraid of you."

Killer's sudden smile chilled the room.

"You will be." Her whisper slithered through the air. "Because someone's coming for you with a weapon."

The doorbell rang.
###Chapter 416

Vivian Laurent spoke coldly, "I'll make her kneel and apologize to you. Name your terms."

Killer arched an eyebrow. "You won't let me go to her, but you'll bring her to me?"

"Her coming to apologize shows remorse. You seeking her out would be revenge." Her tone left no room for doubt.

Killer studied Vivian. "How can you guarantee she'll come?"

"She'll come." A frosty smile curled Vivian's lips.

Killer observed the woman before her. Fiona Grandelle had been a fool for trusting too easily. But Vivian was no Fiona.

A knock interrupted them.

Vivian checked the peephole before opening the door. Sophia Evans stood there, disheveled, her nails digging into her palms.

When Sophia saw Killer's scarred face, a flicker of vicious satisfaction crossed her eyes.

Serves her right! Who told her not to wear a mask properly? She even took it off when the hot water was splashed on her.

Hidden in her bag was a sharp comedone extractor. Today, she'd make Vivian taste the agony of disfigurement too.

"Planning to stand there like a statue?" Vivian broke the silence.

Sophia forced tears to her eyes. "I... I came to apologize."

"Then begin." Vivian crossed her arms.

Sophia lowered her head to hide her murderous intent. "I'm sorry, I—"

"Wait." Vivian cut her off. "I said kneel when you apologize."

Sophia's head snapped up. "Vivian! I'm a celebrity! You expect me to kneel?"

Vivian kicked the back of her knees without hesitation.

Sophia collapsed onto the floor, her face pale with pain.

"You agreed to the terms yourself." Vivian looked down at her.

Biting back humiliation, Sophia decided to play along for now.

"I'm sorry... I shouldn't have thrown water on the plane... Please forgive me..." She feigned sobs.

Killer let out a cold laugh. "Forgive you? You're not worthy."

The icy tone sent a jolt through Sophia. This composed woman bore no resemblance to the lunatic from the plane.
###Chapter 417

"What do you want?" Sophia Evans lifted her chin, her eyes filled with disdain.

Killer's voice was icy. "Hold a press conference. Kneel and apologize."

"Dream on!" Sophia scoffed.

She pushed herself up from the wall, her legs no longer numb.

"Vivian, you're only acting tough because Ethan backs you." Her lips curled into a sneer. "Without a man, you're nothing!"

"What if I did it on purpose?" Sophia tore off her mask of innocence. "Just looking at your face makes me sick!"

"Ugly freaks like you should stay hidden at home. Stop embarrassing yourself in public!"

"If my fans knew how you're bullying me, their collective spit alone could drown you!"

Killer's finger hovered over the trigger.

Vivian Laurent regarded her calmly. "Your fans adore the kind, gentle Sophia Evans they see on screen."

"How do you think they'd react if they knew the real you was this vicious?"

"Honored!" Sophia threw her head back with a shrill laugh. "It's their privilege to adore me!"

"Pretending to smile every day is exhausting. What have they ever done for me?"

"Fans who don't spend money don't deserve to make demands!"

Vivian shook her head. "You don't deserve to have fans at all."

"Stop acting so righteous!" Sophia glared at her with venom. "Those idiots chose to worship me. They deserve what they get!"

"Do you know how much this face is worth?"

She suddenly lunged at Vivian. "I'll ruin it!"

Killer's gun pressed against her temple in an instant.

"Move again. I dare you."
###Chapter 418

Sophia Evans' breathing grew ragged.

Her eyes burned with madness as she glared at Vivian Laurent.

"What would you trashy women know?"

In a sudden motion, she yanked a comedone extractor from her purse and lunged at Vivian.

"Die!"

Vivian sidestepped effortlessly, delivering a sharp kick to Sophia's abdomen.

Sophia crumpled to the floor, writhing in pain.

Killer materialized beside her like a phantom.

"Care so much about this face?" Killer twirled the fallen extractor between her fingers.

Sophia's eyes widened in terror. "What are you doing?"

The needle flashed through the air, carving a jagged gash across Sophia's cheek.

A bloodcurdling scream tore through the room.

Blood dripped down Sophia's face as she touched the wound with trembling fingers.

"My face! My face!"

Vivian watched the sobbing woman coldly.

She could've given Sophia a chance.

But the fool chose destruction.

Emily Garnache hid behind the door, hand clamped over her mouth. She'd never seen Killer like this—cold as an unsheathed blade.

Killer tossed the bloody tool aside.

"Time to go." She turned to Vivian.

"Need a ride?"

Killer smirked. "Don't underestimate me."

Vivian nodded as the girl departed.

On the floor, Sophia continued wailing.

Vivian crouched beside her, gripping her chin.

"Know why this happened?"

Sophia's gaze was vacant, the grotesque wound still bleeding.

"Because you're stupid."

Vivian released her, skirt brushing Sophia's ruined face as she stood.

The once-proud beauty now lay in a bloody ruin.
###Chapter 419

Emily Garnache peeked out from the room only after Killer had left.

"Vivian, where's Fiona Grandelle?"

"She went back."

Emily glanced at Sophia Evans lying unconscious on the floor, hesitating to speak.

Vivian Laurent barely spared a look. "Leave her. We're moving. I'll take you to a hotel."

"Okay!"

They headed straight for the hotel.

On the way, Vivian texted Ethan Roscente.

After all, it had happened in his home.

She regretted not recording the incident earlier.

Who would Ethan believe?

Sophia would twist the story, painting herself as the victim.

"Don't worry," Emily suddenly said. "I recorded it."

"You did?" Vivian looked at her in surprise.

Emily nodded. "I heard noises and came out to check. But I only caught the second half—not the part where Sophia knelt."

"That part doesn't matter."

Vivian took the phone and reviewed the footage.

Sophia's vile insults to her fans were crystal clear.

Every cruel word had come from her mouth.

Her fans adored her, yet she trampled on their devotion.

Vivian decided to expose Sophia's true nature.

She edited the key clips, blurring Fiona's face, and sent them to Isabella Langley.

"Leak this to the press. Let the world see."

"Sophia owes her fame to her fans, yet she betrays them. She deserves this!"

Isabella trembled with rage after hearing the recording.

"If she stays in the industry, there's no justice! What happened to her?"

"Her face is ruined. She won't be causing trouble anytime soon."

"Ruined? Show me! Finally, karma!"

Isabella practically danced with excitement.

Vivian sent the full video.

Watching Fiona slash Sophia's face, Isabella clapped in delight.

"Serves her right! She called others ugly—now she's the real monster!"

"Fiona was incredible. The duality between her personas is striking."

Killer was the embodiment of Fiona's suppressed desire for courage.

Years of repression had forged it into a vengeful, obsessive alter ego.
###Chapter 420

Emily Garnache's eyes widened in shock, nearly dropping her phone.

"Personality? What personality?"

Vivian Laurent had the call on speakerphone. Isabella Langley's voice came through clearly.

"This must stay confidential." Vivian ended the call and turned to Emily. "Not a word about Fiona Grandelle."

Emily nodded vigorously, though her mind swirled with questions.

Isabella acted swiftly.

The moment the video went online, it skyrocketed to the top of trending searches.

Sophia Evans' fanbase erupted.

"We stayed up all night voting, scrimping to buy her endorsements, and she sees us as annoying flies?"

"I spent until 3 AM photoshopping those perfect shots. Did she actually believe she looked like that?"

"Mutual love? What a joke! We're just ATMs to her!"

One explosive hashtag after another emerged.

#SophiaEvansInsultsFans
#SophiaEvansLeaveShowbiz
#SophiaEvansImageShattered

The comment section became a warzone.

"She orchestrated that car crash for the lead role in the hit drama!"

"I can confirm! My cousin was a script supervisor and saw her drug a co-star's water!"

"Her assistant's arms are covered in bruises from her pinching!"

The revelations kept coming.

Sophia's official fan club announced its dissolution.

Brands terminated endorsement deals one after another.

Her glittering facade crumbled to dust.

"Every penny we saved became ammunition for her mockery."

"From today, we boycott all Sophia Evans projects!"

Public opinion flipped completely.

The adored superstar became an overnight pariah.

The entertainment industry had no place left for her.
###Chapter 421

Sophia Evans had just stepped out of the hospital when several men in black suits forced her into a waiting car.

The door slammed shut before she could even scream.

The royal family had acted faster than expected.

The King and Queen listened to Killer's vivid account with faces dark as thunder. When they heard how their daughter had been scalded with boiling water, the Queen shattered her favorite teacup in fury.

"Bring that wretch to me," the Queen commanded, her voice icy.

In a dimly lit basement, Sophia found herself chained to the wall.

"Let me go! Do you know who I am?" she shrieked, rattling the chains violently.

The burn on her face throbbed painfully, reminding her of Vivian Laurent's cold expression.

"This must be Vivian's doing! I'll kill her!"

She kicked and clawed at the metal door, her nails screeching against the surface.

"When I get out, I'll make you all suffer!"

Only echoes answered her desperate threats.

Hours later, footsteps approached.

A uniformed guard pushed a cart bearing a silver tea set.

"Please... let me go," Sophia whimpered, switching tactics. "I can pay you—anything you want."

The guard smirked and leisurely poured steaming tea.

Sophia's eyes widened in horror as she remembered the water she'd thrown at Fiona Grandelle.

"No... don't—"

Scalding liquid splashed across her face.

Her agonized screams filled the chamber.

The guard watched impassively as she writhed on the floor. "That was from the Princess."

Sophia curled into a fetal position, the stench of burnt flesh filling her nostrils.

"And this is from Her Majesty."

By the time the second pour came, she had no voice left to scream.
###Chapter 422

Sophia Evans's pleas for mercy echoed through the empty room.

She curled up on the cold floor, drenched in a mixture of blood and sweat.

Her screams grew increasingly agonized.

But this was only the beginning.

The tormentor picked up a glass and filled it with a clear liquid.

"Wounds need disinfection."

The antiseptic splashed onto Sophia's mutilated face.

As the alcohol seeped into her wounds, Sophia let out a bloodcurdling shriek.

She writhed in pain, her nails clawing deep grooves into the floor.

Saltwater and pepper spray followed in quick succession.

When the pepper spray hit, Sophia finally collapsed, unconscious.

Her face was unrecognizable.

Lying there on the brink of death, Sophia felt death's approach for the first time.

Regret consumed her.

If she could turn back time, she would never have provoked that "monster."

......

Queen Eleanor had Sophia secretly detained.

When Killer returned to the palace, she poured out her grievances to the queen.

The queen held her daughter close, tears streaming down her face.

Despite her cold demeanor, Killer felt the warmth of her mother's love.

Fiona Grandelle's body was already weak.

Every time Killer took control, it drained her energy.

This time, she couldn't hold on any longer.

In her mother's arms, Fiona fell into a deep sleep.

Hours passed, but she still hadn't woken.

The frantic queen immediately summoned Vivian Laurent.

Vivian first apologized for the incident on the plane. "Sophia was targeting me. Fiona got caught in the crossfire."

The queen cut her off. "Check on Fiona first. She's been crying and talking in her sleep."

Fiona's condition was dire.

From her lips, Vivian deciphered phrases like "Stay away" and "I'm not a monster."

This ordeal had deepened Fiona's psychological scars.

The planned surgery might have to be postponed.

Vivian worried Fiona would grow to hate herself even more.

Examinations showed no physical damage—just extreme exhaustion.

"Your Majesty, don't worry. Fiona is just traumatized and needs rest."

Vivian prescribed sedatives to help Fiona sleep peacefully.
###Chapter 423

Fiona Grandelle had been submerged in darkness for a long time.

When her eyes finally fluttered open, tears spilled out instantly.

"Mommy... Mommy..." Her voice was barely a whisper.

Queen Eleanor of Eudora immediately pulled her into a tight embrace. "I'm here, my darling."

Vivian Laurent stood nearby, observing Fiona's condition closely.

Those eyes held nothing but terror and fragility—no trace of the cold-blooded killer.

Killer had vanished again.

"They all say I'm ugly!" Fiona suddenly shrieked. "I'm not a monster! I need to hide!"

She shoved the Queen away and stumbled toward the walk-in closet.

Vivian moved to intercept her, but Fiona brushed past as if she didn't exist.

The closet door slammed shut.

Curled into a ball in the cramped space, Fiona finally felt safe.

The Queen's fingers clenched her skirt, knuckles turning white.

"Dr. Laurent, can the surgery still proceed as scheduled?"

The facial reconstruction originally planned for this week was clearly no longer feasible.

Vivian shook her head. "We'll have to wait."

In her current state, Fiona wouldn't tolerate having her face wrapped in bandages.

The Queen's gaze sharpened dangerously.

"I trusted you because you're Dr. Luna," she said in a low voice. "But if anything else goes wrong—"

"I understand." Vivian met her stare unflinchingly. "This is my responsibility."

"Sophia Evans is in my custody," the Queen said coldly. "She'll be released in two weeks."

More than enough time to ensure that face was ruined beyond repair.

Vivian didn't plead for mercy. "She deserves to pay."

A faint sob drifted from the closet.

No amount of coaxing could convince Fiona to come out.

She even refused to take her medication.

Vivian knew better than to force it. Patience was the only option now.

She took up residence in the palace.

When Emily Garnache was brought in, she was speechless with shock.

"Fiona is... a princess?"

But there was no time for astonishment.

Days passed with no improvement in Fiona's condition.

Vivian's frown deepened.

Until Ethan Roscente appeared unexpectedly in the palace grand hall.

"How did you get in here?" Vivian stared at him in disbelief.

This was the most heavily guarded place in the Kingdom of Eudora.
###Chapter 424

Ethan Roscente tapped the table with his slender fingers. "The Roscente Group has deep collaborations with the royal family in Eudora."

His gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent.

Princess Fiona Grandelle was under tight royal protection. The public only knew the king had a sickly daughter but had never seen her face.

"You've lost weight," Ethan suddenly frowned.

In just a few days, Vivian's jawline had sharpened noticeably.

Vivian instinctively touched her cheek. "Have I?"

She hadn't noticed any change in her weight.

"The queen has granted permission for me to take you out for lunch," Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Dr. Laurent, it's time to repay that meal you owe me."

Though he framed it as collecting a debt, his real intention was to give Vivian a break from the suffocating palace.

"I'll contact you when I'm done with my work," Vivian said, lowering her head to organize her files.

Ethan stood abruptly and grabbed her wrist. "We're leaving now."

He pulled her out of the room with firm determination.

Sunlight bathed them as they stepped outside. Vivian realized she'd been cooped up in the palace for an entire week.

The streets buzzed with hurried pedestrians, the air fragrant with the scent of freshly baked bread.

"What would you like to eat?" Ethan slowed his pace.

"Anything," Vivian replied absently.

Ethan had deliberately chosen not to drive, leading her on a leisurely stroll instead.

"Should we take a cab?" Vivian glanced at her watch. "I need to return soon."

"No rush," Ethan said, hands in his pockets. "Food tastes better when you're hungry."

Vivian shot him an exasperated look.

"Fiona's condition won't change in this short time," Ethan said calmly. "You deserve a break."

After nearly an hour of walking, they finally arrived at a reserved restaurant.

Tucked away in a quiet alley, the traditional Eudoran eatery exuded rustic elegance.

To her surprise, Vivian realized she was genuinely hungry.

She took small bites of the local specialties, unexpectedly savoring the flavors.

"Consider the debt repaid," Vivian set down her fork. "Don't disturb my work again."

Ethan chuckled. "We'll see about that."

He barely touched his food, his gaze fixed on Vivian's face.

Watching her eat, he recalled the same focused expression she'd worn while treating his leg injury.

"Vivian," he called softly.

She looked up, meeting his inscrutable stare.
###Chapter 425

"Sophia Evans appearing on that flight was pure coincidence."

Ethan Roscente's knuckles rapped against the desk. "I thought she was tailing me, but she accidentally crossed paths with you instead. I take full responsibility."

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, the Kingdom of Eudora glittered like scattered stardust.

"I misjudged her character before." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Vivian, give me a chance to make it right."

The steak knife gleamed coldly in Vivian Laurent's grip.

"I swear." Ethan suddenly leaned forward, candlelight flickering in his eyes. "I never had feelings for Sophia. If you want, I'll lay out every truth for you to see."

Even his elder brother Alexander Roscente's secret lineage was laid bare in that moment.

Vivian kept her gaze lowered to the dinner plate.

"I don't have time for this right now."

"Then another day!" Ethan's eyes brightened instantly. The clinking of silverware betrayed his eagerness as he added, "My door is always open whenever you're ready."

He fussed over refilling her water glass and serving dishes. After dinner, he insisted on showing her around Central Plaza. Street performers levitated glass orbs, casting prismatic reflections across Vivian's lashes.

"Watch your step."

Ethan's hand hovered protectively behind her back. When the fountain erupted unexpectedly, he instinctively shielded her with his suit jacket from the spray.

The night breeze carried the scent of roses.

Vivian paused abruptly before an antique shop. A medieval copper mirror in the window reflected her faint smile. The realization struck her—it was never palace walls that confined her, but the prison of her own making.

"We're here."

The palace gates shimmered cobalt under moonlight. As Ethan prepared to say goodnight, Vivian's skirt flared like a night-blooming flower as she turned.

"Thank you for tonight."

Her crescent-moon smile startled the doves nesting by the fountain. Long after her silhouette vanished behind gilded doors, Ethan remained rooted in place. Rose petals drifted from his pocket onto the cobblestones where she'd stood.

Passing guards found the Roscente Group heir grinning foolishly at the empty night air.
###Chapter 426

Vivian Laurent returned to her residence and stayed awake all night.

She kept thinking about how to get Fiona Grandelle out of the royal palace.

Fiona's current condition was extremely poor. She wouldn't even see her closest friend.

Vivian suddenly remembered the famous Blue Moon Bay Resort in the Kingdom of Eudora.

Surrounded by ocean, it offered a tranquil environment.

If she could convince the Queen to book the entire resort, perhaps Fiona could relax in new surroundings.

Meanwhile, Sophia Evans curled up in a dark prison cell.

Her festering wounds emitted a foul odor.

That once proud face was now unrecognizable.

"Please..."

She knelt on the floor, kowtowing until her forehead bled.

"I'll do anything for Fiona..."

The guard chuckled coldly. "Begging for mercy now?"

Sophia collapsed in despair.

She remembered her glamorous past.

The expensive perfumes. The flawless makeup.

Now she had lost even basic dignity.

"Just kill me..."

She suddenly screamed and lunged at the wall.

Thud.

The dull impact echoed through the cell.

The guards exchanged glances and immediately called the Queen.

"Take her to the hospital."

The Queen's voice remained calm and controlled.

She never intended to kill Sophia.

Only to make the vicious woman suffer.

An ambulance rushed Sophia to Royal Hospital.

Her skull was fractured. She sank into a deep coma.

Elsewhere.

Ethan Roscente stood in the palace gardens.

Fresh roses filled his arms.

"Uncle!"

Little Theo came running over.

"Why do you keep coming to the palace?"

Ethan crouched down and ruffled the boy's hair.

"Because I'm working on something very important."

Theo tilted his head. "What is it?"

Ethan's lips curved unconsciously.

"Finding you an aunt."

His gaze drifted toward Vivian's room.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, revealing a slender silhouette.
###Chapter 427

"Theo?" Ethan Roscente crouched down to meet the child's eye level.

The boy's small face tilted up, confusion swimming in his clear eyes. "But what about Mom?"

"Your mother and I are just friends," Ethan said gently.

Theo tugged at his sleeve. "But Mom likes you. I want to call you Dad."

Ethan shook his head. "Uncle is enough." He ruffled the boy's hair. "But I promise to care for you like my own son."

"Really?"

"Really."

Ethan studied the child's features—so similar to his late brother Alexander. If only Alexander were still here...

That car crash, disguised as an accident, still haunted him after years of fruitless investigation. No wonder he'd lost control when Vivian was in danger.

Alexander, though born out of wedlock, had always been kind to him. He would've been proud to see his son growing up so thoughtful.

"Uncle," Theo whispered, pulling his sleeve again. "I want to visit Mom. She gets lonely alone."

Ethan's chest tightened. "But I need you here with me too."

Theo looked down. "You'll have Auntie soon. Mom only has me..."

His voice trailed off. Even after Sophia Evans tried to strangle him, the boy still blamed himself.

Ethan swallowed hard. How could he return this gentle soul to that madwoman?

"Your mom's filming on location," he soothed. "It'll take months."

Theo blinked. "Can I call her?"

"The set's too busy. She might not answer."

The boy bit his lip, small hands twisting together. "Tell me when she comes back?"

"Of course."

The lie burned worse than any blade. But Sophia didn't deserve to be a mother.

After settling Theo, Ethan drove to the royal palace. Vivian had been warmer to him lately.

Though she remained busy with Princess Fiona's affairs—today the queen had taken Fiona to their private island, with Vivian and Emily in tow.

So when Ethan appeared at her door late that night, Vivian nearly dropped her files in shock.
###Chapter 428

"How did you get here?"

Ethan Roscente always appeared out of nowhere.

She was certain she hadn't told him about this trip.

"The Queen gave me the address." Ethan leaned against the doorframe. "I came to check on you."

"What's there to see?" Vivian Laurent frowned. "Staring at me won't make me grow three heads."

"Just making sure you're safe." His gaze swept the hallway. "The island is beautiful. We should visit alone sometime."

"Not happening!" Her voice rose sharply.

Ethan chuckled. "There's always time."

The dim hallway lights cast shadows across his sharp profile, illuminated by the glow from her room.

Whenever those eyes locked onto hers, her pulse betrayed her.

"Done staring? You can leave now."

Showing up unannounced at night—definitely up to no good.

"Night travel is dangerous." He didn't budge.

"You didn't take a boat?"

"Exactly why I know it's risky." His expression remained deadpan. "I was terrified."

Vivian scoffed.

As if anyone would believe that.

"Fiona gets agitated around strangers."

"I'll stay out of her way."

Vivian turned to leave. "Suit yourself. I'm going to bed."

"I'll join you." He followed.

"In your dreams!"

"No vacancies on the island." He stated matter-of-factly. "We'll have to share."

She whirled around. "Over my dead body!"

"Remember Santorini—"

"Shut up!" Her ears burned.

That was an accident!

"I need to talk to you."

"Keep it to yourself!"

As she moved to slam the door, Emily Garnache peeked out from the next room. "Vivian? Is that... your husband?"

Ethan's lips curved.

Vivian's eyes widened. "What did you just call him?"

"I—I mean Mr. Roscente!" Emily corrected hastily.

Vivian slammed the door. "Get lost!"

"Mr. Roscente, is something wrong?" Emily asked timidly.
###Chapter 429

Ethan Roscente leaned against the doorframe, his fingers tapping lightly on the wooden panel. "Got a minute? Need to talk."

Emily Garnache looked up in confusion. Their interactions had been limited to polite exchanges at her father's business events.

"Private matter." Ethan deliberately raised his voice, his gaze flickering toward the closed door.

Emily frowned. "What private business could we possibly have?"

He gestured invitingly. "Let's talk somewhere else."

As he guided Emily down the hallway, the door suddenly swung open.

Vivian Laurent blocked their path with a cold expression. "Where exactly are you taking my assistant, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan shrugged. "Just having a conversation."

"Does this conversation require excluding me?" Vivian pulled Emily behind her. "Go back inside."

Emily glanced anxiously between them before hurrying away.

A triumphant gleam flashed in Ethan's eyes. He'd never intended to actually speak with Emily.

"Inside." Vivian turned sharply and reentered the room.

Ethan followed calmly. The simply furnished guest room bore signs of temporary occupancy, with Vivian's unfinished documents still spread across the bed.

"What's your game?" Vivian crossed her arms.

Ethan held up his hands innocently. "Like I said, just talking."

"The Garnache family isn't to be trifled with." Vivian's voice held warning. "Mr. Garnache is notoriously protective."

Ethan chuckled. "I have no interest in Miss Garnache."

His gaze swept over the double bed meaningfully. "Seems tonight—"

"Dream on." Vivian cut him off. "I let you in for business."

Ethan's playful expression vanished. "I'm listening."

"Sophia Evans attempted suicide. She's comatose in the hospital." Vivian watched his reaction closely.

Ethan remained impassive. "Expected."

"That's all?"

"What else?" His lips curled coldly. "She's lucky to be alive. If the princess consents, I'll arrange specialized supervision. A psychiatric facility may be more appropriate."

Vivian nodded. She'd only done her due diligence by informing him.

"Finished?" Ethan arched an eyebrow.

"Get out." Vivian pointed at the door.

Ethan didn't move, his dark gaze pinning her in place. "Sure there's nothing else you want to say to me?"
###Chapter 430

"I'm not leaving."

Vivian Laurent reached out to push Ethan Roscente's shoulder. "Go now!"

Emily Garnache had already returned to her room. There was no point in Ethan going out now.

Her fingers had just touched the doorknob.

Ethan suddenly grabbed her wrist.

"You—"

In one swift motion, Vivian found herself pinned against the door. Ethan caged her in with his arms on either side.

Under the bright light, his deep eyes reflected her image.

"Vivian." His Adam's apple bobbed as his breathing grew heated.

"May I kiss you?" His lips parted slightly.

Last time, Vivian had told him not to kiss her without permission.

He wanted this kiss desperately, but feared angering her.

Vivian's eyes widened. How could he ask such a question outright?

"No—"

Before she could finish refusing, his lips sealed hers.

Ethan had anticipated her rejection.

He remembered her warning about uninvited kisses. This time, he'd asked first.

With her wrist pinned against the door, Vivian couldn't move.

The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her as his kissing skills proved increasingly refined.

No longer was it a forceful conquest, but a tender exploration.

Vivian's legs weakened until she could barely stand.

Her body betrayed her rationality as she began responding to the kiss.

Then his hand slid to her waist.

Vivian jolted awake and shoved him away forcefully.

"Out!" She flung the door open, cheeks burning.

Ethan found himself ejected into the hallway, yet a satisfied smile curved his lips.

Of course he had accommodations. The princess had arranged a guest room.

Working here might be inconvenient, but seeing Vivian made it worthwhile.

He spent most days in his room handling documents, stealing occasional glances at her.

The vacation passed in peaceful bliss.

Meanwhile, no one noticed when Sophia Evans opened her eyes after two days in a coma.

White ceiling. The sting of antiseptic. Burning pain across her face.

She wasn't dead.

This realization ignited a madness in her gaze.
###Chapter 431

Sophia Evans opened her eyes on the cold hospital bed.

She had thought death would bring her peace. But fate had other plans.

Harsh sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating her bandaged face.

A nurse entered and immediately sneered upon seeing her awake.

"You're awake? I'll call the doctor."

"Wait!" Sophia snapped. "What's with that look?"

She knew guards were posted outside. Only one person could save her now.

"What look?" The nurse scoffed. "The look reserved for trash."

Her phone screen lit up with trending headlines:

#Sophia Evans Caught Insulting Fans#
#Sophia Evans Must Leave Showbiz#
#Sophia Evans' Perfect Image Exposed#

"Lies! These are all fabrications!" Sophia jerked upright, wincing in pain.

The nurse threw the phone at her. "See for yourself."

Her follower count had plummeted by millions. The comments section overflowed with vitriol. Sophia's hands trembled.

Without her PR team, her career was over.

"Give me your phone!" She grabbed the nurse's wrist.

Before getting permission, she dialed a memorized number.

"Hello?" A child's voice answered.

"Theo! It's Mommy!" Sophia choked back tears.

The nurse gasped, nearly dropping her medication tray.

Sophia Evans had a child?

The industry's sweetheart, everyone's innocent crush, was actually a married mother?

"Mommy, what's wrong?" Theo sounded worried.

Sophia clutched the phone like a lifeline. This was her last chance at redemption.

The nurse quietly retreated toward the door, pulling out her own phone.
###Chapter 432

"Mommy!" Theo's cheerful voice came through the phone.

"I miss you so much. Uncle Ethan said you're filming abroad and can't take calls." His sweet voice softened. "When are you coming home?"

Sophia Evans gripped the phone until her knuckles turned white. Ethan Roscente had spun such lies to deceive a child.

"Theo, listen carefully," she whispered urgently. "Mommy isn't filming. I'm being held prisoner."

Silence filled the line.

"You're the only one who can save me now." Her words came faster. "Beg your uncle to rescue me. Or you'll never see Mommy again."

Theo's breathing grew ragged.

"Children without mothers get bullied. They call them bastards." A tremor entered her voice. "Do you want that?"

"No!" Theo shrieked. "I want Mommy!"

A cold smirk twisted Sophia's lips.

"Go kneel before your uncle right now." Her tone turned commanding. "Cry and tell him you'll die if Mommy does."

Sobs crackled through the receiver.

"Mommy... I don't want to die..." he hiccuped.

"Now!" Sophia barked. "If I die, I'll haunt you forever!"

Piercing wails erupted from the phone.

Sophia ended the call and tossed the phone to a nearby nurse. Her eyes gleamed with terrifying darkness.

The nurse caught it with trembling hands. Never had she witnessed a mother weaponizing death threats against her own child.

"What are you staring at?" Sophia snapped, her gaze sharp as daggers.

The nurse ducked her head, heart pounding. This woman's true nature eclipsed every vicious rumor online.

"Ha-ha-ha—" Sophia suddenly erupted into hysterical laughter.

The manic sound echoed through the sterile room, raising goosebumps. Tears streamed down her face even as she kept laughing.

The nurse bolted, nearly slamming into the hallway wall. She needed a doctor immediately—this woman had completely lost her mind.
###Chapter 433

Sunlight spilled across the powdery white sand as Ethan Roscente strolled beside Vivian Laurent.

A sea breeze lifted the hem of Vivian's dress.

Ethan's phone buzzed abruptly.

The screen flashed with the name "Theo" in bold letters.

"I need to take this." He strode toward a distant cluster of rocks.

Heart-wrenching sobs crackled through the receiver. "Uncle...I want Mommy..."

Theo's voice was hoarse from crying.

Ethan's grip tightened on the phone. "Don't be afraid. I'm coming home."

His knuckles turned white when he ended the call.

Vivian caught fragments of a child's weeping.

She glanced around but heard only the crash of waves.

Ethan returned with stormy eyes. "An emergency. I have to leave."

Vivian nodded. "Go ahead."

"I'll find you later." He disappeared down the beach.

She watched his retreating figure, words dying on her lips.

Emily Garnache bounded over with an armful of seashells.

"Viv, why did Mr. Roscente leave so suddenly?"

"How many times must I tell you? He's not your brother-in-law." Vivian frowned.

Emily stuck out her tongue. "You two have been inseparable lately..."

Vivian froze.

She suddenly realized Ethan had been shadowing her every move.

"The way he looks at you..." Emily winked. "Like he's courting you."

"Don't be ridiculous." Heat crept up Vivian's neck.

On the horizon, Ethan's yacht sliced through the waves.

"You'd make such a perfect couple," Emily sighed.

Vivian shook her head. "Impossible."

"Why?"

"Some chances...once lost, stay lost forever."

Seagulls skimmed the water as Vivian's gaze turned distant.

Emily pouted. "But you clearly—"

"You're too young to understand." Vivian tapped her forehead.

She couldn't bring herself to trust Ethan's promises again.

"I'll always be on your side!" Emily linked arms with her.

Vivian's chest ached as the yacht vanished into the glittering sea.
###Chapter 434

Ethan Roscente's phone rang urgently the moment he left the island.

The butler's voice was frantic on the other end. "Young Master Theo won't stop crying—nothing calms him down..."

"What happened?" Ethan frowned.

"I don't know. He suddenly started screaming for his mother..."

Ethan hung up and immediately turned the car around. The drive from the island to the city would take at least two hours. Theo had never lost control like this before.

He had told Theo that Sophia Evans was away filming and wouldn't be back for a while. The boy was usually so well-behaved—why the sudden outburst?

By the time Ethan rushed home, Theo was drenched in tears.

"Uncle Ethan!" The boy threw himself into his arms, his face flushed.

Ethan knelt and gently wiped his cheeks. "Tell me what's wrong."

"Mommy..." Theo choked on a sob. "Mommy's trapped by bad people..."

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"Mommy said she's scared..." Theo clutched his sleeve. "Uncle Ethan, please save her..."

"Who told you this?" Ethan's voice was low.

Theo bit his lip. "Mommy told me herself... She never went to film anything..."

Ethan's fists clenched. Sophia had contacted Theo and fed him these lies?

"Theo, your mother is working," he said, trying to soothe him. "She'll visit when she's done."

Theo suddenly pulled away.

With a thud, the small boy dropped to his knees on the cold floor.

"Uncle Ethan..." He kowtowed, pressing his forehead to the ground. "Please bring Mommy back..."

Ethan's pupils contracted. He immediately scooped the child up. "Did your mother tell you to do this?"

Theo shook his head, tears streaming. "I miss her... If Mommy doesn't come back, I don't want to live anymore..."

The words stabbed through Ethan's heart.

He took a deep breath and patted Theo's back. "Alright. I promise."

Theo looked up at him with watery eyes.

"You'll see her soon." Ethan forced a smile, though his eyes remained cold.

Sophia, you've outdone yourself.
###Chapter 435

Theo nodded vigorously, finally soothed. His tiny fingers clung to Ethan's sleeve.

"Uncle, make Mommy come back now."

Ethan ruffled the boy's hair and texted Vivian first.

"Vivi."

The moment those letters lit up her screen, Vivian nearly dropped her phone.

She stared at the nickname for three full seconds. A chill ran down her spine.

Had Ethan lost his mind?

"Get to the point," she typed quickly. "Finished handling your mess?"

The typing indicator appeared.

"Sophia might be released soon."

Vivian arched an eyebrow.

Wasn't Sophia locked up by the Queen? Rumor said she'd been hospitalized after a suicide attempt.

"Whatever." She replied. "Why tell me?"

Had Ethan gone soft on her?

"Giving you advance notice."

The phrase "advance notice" made Vivian's fingers freeze.

It sounded intimate. Like something between lovers.

Her heartbeat stuttered.

"Do what you want." She suppressed the odd flutter. "But if she crosses me again, I won't hold back."

Her phone rang immediately.

"What?" Vivian snapped.

A low chuckle came through.

"Someone's jealous?" Ethan's voice dripped with amusement. "Let me clarify."

A deliberate pause.

"I don't pity her. She means nothing to me."

Vivian gripped her phone, momentarily speechless.

"Okay." She said flatly.

"Releasing her serves a purpose." Ethan continued. "She'll be under surveillance."

Even if freed, she'd remain under house arrest. Theo could visit—but only under Ethan's watch.

"Done?" Vivian asked.

"Yes."

"Then I'm hanging up."

"Wait." Ethan's voice softened suddenly. "I miss you."

Vivian's ears burned. She ended the call with a sharp click.

Right before disconnecting, she thought she heard a child's voice.

That lunatic!

Missing her after three hours? What a joke!

She tossed her phone onto the couch and took a deep breath.

Men's sweet words were poison.

She wasn't falling for it.

Across town, Ethan looked at the disconnected call, lips curving.

Theo looked up. "Why are you smiling, Uncle? Is Mommy coming back?"
###Chapter 436

"Mommy isn't back yet. Theo needs to wait a little longer." Ethan Roscente crouched down and ruffled the boy's hair.

Theo pouted, his eyes instantly welling up with tears.

Ethan had already contacted the Queen. She granted his request and agreed to release the prisoner.

Sophia Evans lay on the hospital bed. Her fractured ribs were healing, and the rest were just superficial wounds. She could be discharged anytime.

Online rumors about her miscarriage ran rampant. The nurse's爆料 had been drowned in skepticism, failing to cause much stir.

On her discharge day, Sophia beamed with joy. Sunlight bathed her face as if the darkness had finally passed.

Her smile froze when she returned to the villa. A dozen black-suited bodyguards stood in the courtyard like an impenetrable wall.

"Where's Ethan? I demand to see him!" she shrieked.

No one acknowledged her demand. The new servants moved about expressionlessly, like robots.

Her phone was confiscated. Internet access was cut off. For two full days, she remained trapped in this gilded cage.

At dawn on the third day, Ethan walked into the villa holding Theo's hand.

Sophia sat at the vanity, applying thick foundation. Bandages covered the festering half of her face—she didn't dare remove them.

In the mirror, she only looked at the intact side of her face. Over and over, she traced her eyebrows and lined her eyes, as if trying to reclaim her former beauty.

"Mommy!" Theo rushed toward her with glee.

Sophia turned abruptly. Her gaze bypassed the child, locking onto Ethan instead.

"Ethan..." Her voice trembled.

Theo hugged her legs, rubbing his face against her dress.

Sophia remained motionless. Her eyes held only the cold man before her.
###Chapter 437

Ethan Roscente looked down at Sophia Evans with cold dominance.

"Sophia, this is your final warning."

His voice was icy.

Sophia shrank back, tears welling in her eyes.

"I've learned my lesson. I won't do it again."

Her words sounded repentant, but her nails dug deep into her palms.

Why did Vivian Laurent get to stand by Ethan's side? She couldn't accept it.

"Mommy!" Theo ran over and hugged her leg.

Sophia looked down at the child, a calculating glint flashing in her eyes.

She knelt down, deliberately showing her bandaged face.

"Theo, Mommy missed you so much..."

Ethan pulled the child behind him.

"Watch your words."

Sophia bit her lip.

This child was her only bargaining chip.

"Uncle..." Theo looked up with pleading eyes. "I want to stay with Mommy longer."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

He knew Sophia's tricks all too well.

"I'll pick you up in one hour."

Sophia hid a smug smile.

She knew Ethan couldn't bear to make Theo sad.

"Mommy got you new toys." She took Theo's hand.

Ethan watched coldly.

This woman's acting skills had become disturbingly convincing.

Two hours later.

"Time to go." Ethan lifted the reluctant Theo.

Sophia followed them to the door with reddened eyes.

"Will you visit Mommy again tomorrow?"

Theo nodded eagerly.

Ethan shot her a warning glare.

Sophia pretended not to notice.

"Uncle, let's come back tomorrow." Theo tugged at Ethan's sleeve.

After a pause, Ethan replied.

"We'll see."

Sophia watched from the window as the black car drove away.

She slowly wiped the tears from her eyes.

A cold smile curled her lips.

"Ethan Roscente, just you wait."

Turning, she picked up her phone and dialed a number.

"Is everything ready?"

A respectful voice answered.

"All set, awaiting your orders."

Sophia hung up with satisfaction.

She stroked Theo's photo in the frame.

"My dear son, Mommy will take very good 'care' of you."
###Chapter 438

Vivian Laurent sat by Fiona Grandelle's bedside, speaking in soft tones.

Fiona's fingers clutched the blanket tightly, her eyes darting nervously.

"The sunshine is lovely today. Would you like to walk in the garden?"

Fiona immediately shook her head, burying her face deeper.

"I... I'd rather not."

Vivian noticed her unconsciously touching the scar on her cheek.

"I've revised the surgical plan. The risks are much lower now."

Fiona jerked her head up, eyes wide with fear.

"No! I won't do it! That's what you said last time!"

Her voice trembled as she curled into herself.

Vivian sighed and gently patted her shoulder.

Queen Eleanor of Eudora watched from the doorway, her heart aching.

"Dr. Laurent, may I have a word?"

In the hallway, the Queen rubbed her temples wearily.

"Fiona has always been like this. I can't bear to force her."

Vivian nodded. "She needs more time."

The Queen suddenly covered her mouth, suppressing a gag.

"Are you feeling unwell, Your Highness?"

"Perhaps jet lag. I've been nauseous lately."

Vivian considered this. "When was your last physical?"

"Last month in Eudora. The royal physician said everything was normal."

Vivian smiled slightly. "Would you like to try these?"

She produced a small packet of sour plums from her bag.

The Queen's eyes lit up as she eagerly opened it.

"Oh my! I've been craving sour things lately!"

Soon, the entire box disappeared.

Emily Garnache passed by with a fruit tray, peering curiously.

"Your Highness, would you like this extremely sour lemon?"

The Queen took the lemon and bit directly into it.

Emily's eyes widened. "Not too sour?"

The Queen smiled contentedly. "Perfect."

Vivian and Emily exchanged glances.

"Vivian... could Her Highness be..."

Vivian nodded. "Most likely."

"But last month's exam showed nothing."

"Early tests can sometimes be inaccurate."

Vivian watched the Queen's retreating figure.

"And with such obvious cravings..."

Emily gasped. "Heavens! This is wonderful news!"
###Chapter 439

Emily Garnache's eyes widened, her teacup nearly slipping from her grasp.

The Queen was pregnant?

Vivian Laurent stepped forward and gave a slight bow.

"Your Highness, I recommend you go to the hospital for a thorough examination immediately."

The Queen's fingers froze around the jujube candy she held.

"Is something... wrong with me?" Her voice trembled.

Vivian's gaze dropped to the Queen's abdomen.

"It might be good news. What you've been hoping for... may have come true."

The candy fell to the floor with a soft thud.

The Queen's hand instinctively pressed against her stomach, her eyes shimmering with disbelief.

"Dr. Laurent, are you saying—"

Just a month ago, Vivian had told her the chances of conception were slim.

"It's just a preliminary assessment. We need a hospital to confirm."

The Queen stood abruptly, not even pausing to grab her coat as she rushed out.

"Take care of Fiona for me."

Emily watched the Queen's hurried departure, her expression troubled.

"Vivian, if Her Highness really is expecting..."

She bit her lip, leaving the thought unfinished.

Vivian shook her head gently.

"At her age, carrying this pregnancy to term will be extremely difficult."

The risks for a woman in her forties were far too high.

Emily's eyes reddened.

"How heartbreaking for her..."

Vivian turned to the window.

"It's her choice to make."

At the hospital, the Queen clutched the test results, her knuckles white.

When she saw the word "Positive," she covered her mouth, tears spilling over.

She was really pregnant!

But the doctor's expression remained grim.

"Your Highness, this fetus..."
###Chapter 440

"Congratulations, Your Highness. You're four weeks pregnant."

The doctor's words made the Queen's fingers tremble slightly.

Her hand instinctively moved to her flat stomach as her eyes welled up with tears.

Ten years.

After a decade of waiting, she'd finally been blessed with a child.

"Dr. Laurent was right..." the Queen murmured, her voice thick with emotion.

She remembered kneeling in the rain the day Lulu died, consumed by despair. Now fate had granted her a second chance.

"I want this child to be born safely," the Queen declared, her gaze steely. "No matter the cost."

The doctor hesitated, clearly uncomfortable.

"Your Highness, your physical condition—"

"Get to the point."

"Medically speaking, we don't recommend continuing this pregnancy." The doctor swallowed hard. "Advanced maternal age combined with uterine complications makes this extremely high-risk."

The Queen stood abruptly, her chair screeching across the floor.

"Risk?" She laughed coldly. "I've stared death in the face. What do I care about risk?"

The doctor froze under her withering glare.

"Schedule my prenatal care." The Queen grabbed her purse without looking back. "I want the best medical team available."

Her footsteps quickened down the hallway.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Vivian Laurent.

"Dr. Laurent, I need you."

Thirty minutes later, in Vivian's office.

The Queen shoved the test results across the desk, her knuckles white with tension.

"Help me," she rasped. "You know better than anyone what this child means to me."

Vivian reviewed the report, her frown deepening.

Paper-thin uterine lining. Hormonal imbalances. Every metric screamed danger.

"Your Highness—"

"Don't tell me to terminate." The Queen cut her off. "I only want solutions."

Vivian took a deep breath.

"If you proceed, you could—"

"I don't care." The Queen's voice was ironclad. "I'd trade my life for this baby's without hesitation."

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the Queen's determined profile.

Vivian suddenly remembered finding her sobbing over Lulu's lifeless body that stormy night ten years ago.

She quietly closed the file.

"Alright. I'll help you."
###Chapter 441

The Queen's fingers dug deep into her palms, leaving crescent-shaped marks on her skin.

"I want this child." Her voice trembled, but her resolve was unshakable. "If fate has chosen me, I won't betray this gift."

She suddenly gripped Vivian's wrist with surprising strength. "Dr. Laurent, I beg you to help me. Money is no object—five billion, ten billion, name your price."

Vivian felt the Queen's pulse racing beneath her fingertips. The desperation in the mother's eyes told her any attempt to dissuade her would be futile.

"Medicine offers no guarantees." Vivian sighed. "But if you insist, we can monitor the fetus's development first."

Hope flared in the Queen's eyes like a drowning woman clutching at driftwood.

Vivian listed every possible complication: deformities, congenital diseases, miscarriage risks, life-threatening labor... Each word weighed heavier on her heart.

The Queen's spine remained rigid throughout.

"I've assembled the best medical team." The Queen caressed her flat abdomen. "I'll suspend all royal duties this year to focus on the pregnancy."

Vivian studied the Queen's red-rimmed eyes, recalling the lab subjects who'd sacrificed everything for motherhood. Humanity's obsession with perpetuating life sometimes bordered on madness.

"One more thing..." The Queen lowered her voice. "Please don't tell Fiona yet. The child is too sensitive."

Vivian frowned. She'd seen Fiona Grandelle during an episode—that fragile girl curled in a corner like a wounded animal.

"Secrets solve nothing." Vivian met the Queen's gaze. "Fiona is stronger than you think."

Salt-laden wind whipped against Vivian's face as she stared at the distant horizon where sea met sky. For a moment, she thought of the mother she'd never known.

Her fingers closed around the pendant at her throat—the only relic from her birth mother. The cold metal refused to warm against her palm.

The Queen's retreating figure shrank to a speck in the distance. Vivian stood on the jagged rocks, letting seawater soak her shoes.

Eighteen years ago, had that woman worn the same joyous expression upon learning of her pregnancy? Or had she immediately started calculating the child's monetary value?

Icy waves licked her ankles. For the first time, Vivian wondered—what did it feel like to be genuinely wanted in this world?
###Chapter 442

The sea breeze brushed through Vivian's hair.

She stood at the edge of the shoreline, bare feet sinking into warm sand.

"Vivian."

Ethan's deep voice carried over the crashing waves.

She turned to find him silhouetted against the sunset.

Golden light outlined his broad shoulders as he stood facing the dying sun.

The horizon burned crimson behind him, painting the ocean in amber hues.

Vivian squinted, her lashes fluttering against the glare.

"What are you doing here?"

She remembered Ethan mentioning urgent documents at Roscente Group headquarters this morning.

His polished shoes left deep imprints as he strode toward her.

The ocean wind tugged at his loosened tie as he undid his suit jacket.

"Nothing's more important than you."

When three steps remained between them, Ethan suddenly reached out.

Vivian stumbled into his embrace before she could react.

His familiar sandalwood scent mixed with sea salt enveloped her.

This time, she didn't pull away.

Ethan tightened his arms, resting his chin atop her head.

"Emily said you disappeared after meeting the Princess."

His voice rumbled through his chest.

Vivian clutched the fabric of his dress shirt.

"Just needed to walk."

Ethan pulled back slightly to cradle her face.

The sunset turned her irises translucent, like liquid amber.

His thumb brushed beneath her eye. "Tears?"

"Sand." She turned her face away.

Ethan didn't press.

Instead, he laced their fingers together and led her toward the water.

When the tide lapped at their ankles, Vivian spoke softly.

"If I ever disappear—"

"I'll search every grain of sand to find you."

Ethan interrupted, tracing the scar on her hand.

The mark she'd earned shielding him three years ago.

Vivian chuckled. "Fool."

She kicked seawater, splashing his trousers.

Ethan suddenly swept her into his arms.

"Hey!"

"Stay with me until the sun's gone."

He carried her toward a flat rock in the shallows.

After token resistance, Vivian relaxed against his shoulder.

The clouds ignited with renewed fire as dusk deepened.

Ethan pressed a kiss to her hair. "I'll always be your safe harbor."

The ocean swallowed Vivian's quiet sigh.

Her fingers secretly curled around his suit button.
###Chapter 443

Vivian Laurent settled onto the beach, her weight creating a small depression in the soft sand.

Ethan Roscente sat beside her, maintaining just an arm's length between them.

"Why are you following me?" She frowned.

His gaze remained fixed on the distant horizon. "I want to watch the ocean with you. So when you're alone next time, you'll remember this moment."

"Not happening."

She intended to erase every memory of him.

"Call me anytime you want to see the ocean again." He turned to face her. "No matter where I am, I'll come."

Vivian scoffed.

She'd heard enough empty promises to last a lifetime.

"Don't make vows you can't keep. Men always talk about 'forever,' but forever doesn't exist."

She'd witnessed too many broken oaths.

"I'm different." Ethan's eyes burned with intensity. "Test my sincerity over time. Then decide whether to accept me."

Heat crept up Vivian's ears.

"Who said anything about accepting you?"

She sprang to her feet and strode away.

Ethan followed at a leisurely pace.

He'd noticed Vivian's unusual mood today and wanted to cheer her up in his own way.

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in twilight hues.

They arrived at the island restaurant.

Emily Garnache was dining in their suite with Fiona Grandelle, leaving the two of them alone.

Ethan kept serving Vivian until her plate overflowed.

"Stop. I can't eat all this."

"Take what you want. I'll finish the rest."

Vivian only picked at her food.

She'd never let him eat her leftovers.

After dinner, Ethan discreetly questioned Emily but learned nothing.

He made a quick phone call before appearing at Vivian's door.

"Vivian?" His knuckles rapped lightly against the wood.
###Chapter 444

The distant sound of waves made Vivian toss restlessly in bed.

Outside her door, the clamor of footsteps and voices shattered any hope of sleep.

She yanked the door open and found herself staring into Ethan's intense gaze.

"What's this madness in the middle of the night?"

Without a word, he seized her wrist and pulled her out of the room.

"Let go!"

She stumbled as he dragged her forward. The moonlit island glowed with lights, the sea breeze carrying its briny scent.

"Where are you taking me?"

Ethan didn't slow his pace. "You'll see."

They passed through a grove of palm trees, and the view opened up. An elegant table and chairs stood on the sand, bathed in warm golden light.

"Drink."

He gestured to the array of bottles—whiskey, brandy, champagne—their contents shimmering invitingly.

"Not interested."

Vivian turned to leave, but Ethan pressed her into a chair.

"Humoring me."

He pulled out insect repellent and sprayed it meticulously over her exposed skin. His fingers brushed her wrist, sending a shiver through her.

"I can do it myself."

"Stay still."

His tone brooked no argument. He lit a mosquito coil, the faint sandalwood scent drifting through the air.

Amber liquid swirled into a glass.

Vivian downed it in one gulp.

"Slow down."

"More."

Ethan had barely poured half a glass when she snatched the bottle from him.

"Since when is the mighty Mr. Roscente so stingy?"

She took a long swig, the alcohol burning her throat.

A strawberry glistened with droplets on the fruit platter. Ethan speared it and held it to her lips.

"Eat something."

She turned her head away and refilled her glass.

Three drinks later, a flush crept up her cheeks.

Ethan watched her silently. This stubborn woman buried her vulnerabilities so deep.

Waves lapped at the shore, moonlight draping over them both.

How he wanted to tell her—

Some burdens weren't meant to be carried alone.
###Chapter 445

Ethan Roscente swirled the amber liquid in his glass, the moonlight catching its golden hues.

"Slow down," he murmured, intercepting Vivian Laurent's wineglass with his own.

Their glasses met with a crystalline chime.

Vivian tossed back the drink in one swift motion, wincing as fire burned down her throat.

Ethan's gaze never left her face.

This moment was rare.

Their usual encounters were all sharp edges and raised defenses—two porcupines bristling with quills.

But tonight, the sea breeze carried the scent of salt and spirits.

When the third bottle was uncorked, Ethan finally spoke. "What's really going on today?"

"Nothing." Vivian stared at the distant waves.

"Your face tells a different story."

"I said it's nothing!"

Ethan raised his hands in surrender. "Fine. If you say it's nothing, then it's nothing."

Vivian poured herself another drink.

She refused to speak that name aloud.

Vincent Valrose was a thorn embedded deep in her heart.

That chapter was closed. She wouldn't waste another breath on someone unworthy.

Yet today, seeing Queen Eleanor cradling her child had stirred something within her.

She would never repeat those mistakes.

Not until she could give a child the love they deserved.

"When are you returning to Eudora?" she asked abruptly.

Ethan tilted his glass. "My schedule's flexible. The question is—when are you leaving?"

"I need more time."

Fiona Grandelle's condition required monitoring until she stabilized.

"We'll go together," Ethan said casually.

Vivian frowned. "Don't rearrange your work for me."

She hated feeling tethered.

Everyone had their own path. No one should alter their course for another.

"Relax," Ethan chuckled. "I have business in Eudora too."

There was also Theo to consider.

The stubborn boy insisted on staying by his mother's side.

Ethan's expression darkened at the thought.

"Mm." Vivian didn't press further.

She refilled Ethan's glass, and their drinks met again under the moonlight.

For the first time that evening, Vivian thought—perhaps this wasn't so bad.
###Chapter 446

Night deepened after rounds of drinks.

Ethan Roscente and Vivian Laurent had consumed quite a bit, leaving only the sound of waves around them.

Vivian was thoroughly drunk, her body limp against the table.

Ethan fought to stay conscious as he knelt before her on one knee. "Get on. I'll carry you back."

She shook her head groggily. He simply took her hand and pulled her onto his back.

When he stood, he realized how light she was—like a feather.

He deliberately slowed his pace, wishing this path would never end.

Under the moonlight, their shadows merged on the beach.

"Ethan." Vivian suddenly slurred his name.

His heart skipped. "Hmm?"

"You bastard... I'm gonna bite you to death!"

Without warning, she sank her teeth into his neck.

Ethan gasped but didn't pull away.

He let her leave deep teeth marks on his skin.

"Why don't you love me..." Her voice cracked with tears. "I love you so much..."

A sharp pain pierced his chest.

"I do." His voice turned hoarse. "I just realized too late."

This was his first time loving someone—clumsy and uncertain.

The invisible wall between them seemed to crumble at last.

"You wanted to divorce me for Sophia Evans..." Her words grew more aggrieved. "That fake saint..."

She bit his shoulder again.

Ethan gave a bitter smile.

Listening to her accusations, he wished he could punch himself.
###Chapter 447

"Never again." Ethan Roscente's voice was low, thick with barely concealed remorse.

Vivian Laurent spoke lightly, but no words could capture the endless nights of waiting and heartache she'd endured.

For six months, she'd cared for him with meticulous attention. What had been going through her mind during those days?

Three years of marriage spent alone in that empty mansion. Not once had he returned.

His extended stay in the Kingdom of Eudora—officially for business expansion—was really because of Theo.

Theo had been premature, confined to an incubator for three months. It wasn't until he turned two that his health stabilized.

Those three years, Ethan had poured everything into Theo, forgetting there was someone else waiting for him at home.

He owed everyone, but his deepest debt was to Vivian.

"Liar." Her arms tightened around his neck.

"It's true." His whisper was almost inaudible.

Drunk Vivian might not remember tonight, but he needed her to know he wouldn't fail her again.

She'd chased after him before. Now it was his turn to protect her.

Ethan carried her into the hotel elevator, reaching her room swiftly.

Finding the keycard in her purse, he unlocked the door.

He laid her gently on the bed, carefully removing her heels.

As he leaned over to pull up the covers, Vivian stirred.

She pushed up unsteadily. Before Ethan could react, their lips met.

His pupils contracted at the soft, wine-scented contact.

"Mmm..." Vivian blinked drowsily, seemingly confused.

When she instinctively tried to pull back, Ethan cradled the back of her head.

The kiss came fierce and hungry, years of pent-up longing unleashed.

He parted her lips effortlessly, claiming her with possessive intensity.

Vivian struggled weakly against his unyielding hold.

This kiss burned hotter than any before. Finally, he could taste her without restraint.

Always before, she'd push him away. But tonight, she'd initiated it.

Drunk Vivian was impossibly pliant, her glazed eyes inviting further conquest.
###Chapter 448

Ethan Roscente's self-control was crumbling.

He cupped Vivian Laurent's nape, deepening the kiss. Her lips were impossibly soft, carrying a faint rose scent that intoxicated him.

The sheets wrinkled beneath their weight.

His fingertips burned. Never had he imagined his famed discipline would shatter so completely before her.

Vivian's lashes fluttered.

Heat radiated through her entire body. Ethan's kiss sent electric currents from her lips to every nerve ending.

"Mmm..."

An involuntary whimper escaped her.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. He abruptly pushed himself up, creating distance.

"Don't—"

Vivian pursued him.

Her fingers clutched his wrinkled dress shirt, fabric bunching in her palm.

Ethan's breathing turned ragged.

He stared at her flushed cheeks, dark tides churning in his gaze.

"Do you realize what you're doing?"

She shook her head.

Only this man could soothe the fire consuming her.

Two buttons popped open on Ethan's shirt.

Vivian's fingertips brushed his scorching skin.

"Damn it."

His curse was low and rough.

He seized her wandering hand, only to find her temperature alarmingly high.

"Vivian?"

Her eyes glazed over.

She began tearing at her own collar, revealing delicate collarbones.

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple.

"Stop."

His warning went unheeded.

The first button slipped free.

Ethan jerked his face away.

His clenched fists showed bulging veins.

The rustle of fabric filled the silent room.

When he looked back—

Vivian had shed every constraint.

Moonlight through the curtains gilded her silhouette in silver.

Ethan's pupils contracted violently.

His last shred of rationality shattered.
###Chapter 449
Vivian's Initiative

Vivian's skin glowed with a delicate pink hue, smooth as satin.

Ethan's breath caught in his throat.

All he wanted was to mark that porcelain skin as his own.

"Vivian..." His voice came out rough and strained.

The sight before him short-circuited his thoughts.

His Adam's apple bobbed violently, mouth parched.

She took his breath away—more breathtaking than any scenery in the world.

He'd gladly spend a lifetime memorizing her face.

Vivian fluttered her lashes like butterfly wings.

Her hazy gaze struggled to focus on him.

Ethan held his breath, letting her study him.

"Ethan..." She suddenly whispered his name.

His heart lurched with wild joy.

"Yes!" The word burst from him like an eager boy's.

Her memories seemed tangled.

"You're divorcing me again..." Her lower lip trembled.

The usually formidable woman now seemed heartbreakingly fragile.

"I'm not—"

"Divorce! Let's do it now!" Vivian jerked upright.

She forgot she wore nothing.

Ethan's arm banded around her waist, hauling her back against him.

She landed in his lap, every inch exposed.

"No divorces." His murmur was velvet-soft.

But Vivian's attention had locked onto his mouth.

Without warning, she crashed her lips against his.

Ethan's last shred of control shattered.

He seized command, devouring her with desperate hunger.

The room's temperature spiked.

Clothing littered the floor.

Ethan couldn't hold back any longer.

Tonight, he'd claim what their wedding night had denied him.

Vivian writhed beneath him.

Her body arched instinctively, seeking relief.

At the final moment, Ethan wrenched back.

"Vivian," he rasped, "do you know who I am?"

He needed her consent.

Even if stopping now might kill him.
###Chapter 450

Vivian Laurent teetered on the edge of climax.

The pleasure came to an abrupt halt.

Emptiness flooded her senses instantly.

"Are you even capable?" She grabbed Ethan Roscente's collar, her eyes red-rimmed.

Those words ignited something primal in Ethan.

His hands tightened around Vivian's waist as he drove into her with renewed force.

Years of gym training had sculpted Ethan's eight-pack abs to perfection.

Every muscle now strained with tension.

The bedroom temperature soared.

It would be a long night.

......

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

Vivian winced.

Her body ached as if she'd been run over.

Her fingers twitched involuntarily.

They brushed against warm, firm skin.

Vivian's eyes flew open.

Ethan's bare chest filled her vision.

Her palm lay flat against his heartbeat.

Further up, his chiseled features looked peaceful in sleep.

His arm remained locked around her waist.

The worst part?

They were both completely naked beneath the sheets.

"Ah!"

Vivian kicked out violently.

Ethan crashed onto the hardwood floor.

He'd barely slept two hours.

Now he stood naked in the morning light.

Every muscle stood out in sharp relief.

Including one very prominent part.

Vivian averted her gaze, ears burning.

"Ethan Roscente! You're dead!"

Her threat lacked conviction.

Ethan rubbed his lower back.

"You were the one who initiated last night."

He made no attempt to cover himself.

"Put some clothes on!"

Vivian clutched the sheets tighter.

"You ripped them."

Ethan pointed to the shredded fabric on the floor.
###Chapter 451

Vivian Laurent opened her eyes, her mind completely blank.

Fragments of last night's memories flashed through her mind—only the hazy intimacy of the room remained clear. She looked down at the telltale marks on her skin and flushed crimson.

"Ethan Roscente!" She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at the man beside her with gritted teeth.

Ethan lazily opened his eyes, effortlessly catching the pillow with one muscular arm. A smirk played on his lips. "Trying to murder your husband, Mrs. Roscente?"

"Who's your wife?" Vivian trembled with rage. "You took advantage of me!"

In one swift motion, Ethan flipped her beneath him. His bare torso displayed well-defined muscles, several scratch marks visible across his shoulders.

"Who was the one clinging to me last night?" His deep voice dripped with amusement.

Vivian turned her face away. "Liar!"

Ethan chuckled, tilting her chin back with slender fingers until their eyes met. His gaze burned with intensity.

"Shall I refresh your memory?" His warm breath caressed her sensitive earlobe.

A shiver ran down her spine. Vivian raised her leg to kick him.

Anticipating her move, Ethan caught her slender ankle. His calloused thumb traced circles on her delicate skin, eliciting another tremble.

"Let go!" She struggled.

"Keep moving," his voice turned husky, "and I won't be responsible for what happens next."

Vivian froze. She could feel his body's unmistakable response against her. Her cheeks burned hotter.

Seizing the opportunity, Ethan captured her lips. The kiss was both demanding and tender, leaving no room for refusal. He pinned her resisting hands above her head.

"Mmph...you—" Her protest dissolved between their joined mouths.

Ethan's skilled lips soon melted her resistance. He deepened the kiss, his tongue exploring every sweet corner of her mouth.

Vivian's breathing grew ragged. Though her mind screamed to push him away, her body betrayed her, responding against her will.

Noticing her surrender, triumph flashed in Ethan's eyes. He released her wrists to trail his hands down her slender waist.

Just as passion overwhelmed them, footsteps sounded outside.

"Ms. Laurent? Are you awake?" A maid's voice called through the door.

Vivian jerked away, hastily pulling the sheets over herself. "I—I'll be right out!" Her voice shook.

Ethan fell back onto the bed, grinning like a satisfied cat. He sat up leisurely. "You worked hard last night. Need more rest?"

Vivian grabbed another pillow and smashed it into his smug face.
###Chapter 452

Vivian Laurent lay powerless beneath Ethan Roscente's crushing weight.

His kiss was an unstoppable force, eroding her resistance with each searing touch.

The sheets had slipped away unnoticed, baring her porcelain skin to his hungry gaze.

Ethan's bare chest pressed against her, his growing arousal impossible to ignore.

"Mmph—" Vivian bit down hard on his lip.

The metallic tang of blood flooded their joined mouths.

Ethan recoiled with a hiss, only to receive a feeble slap across his cheek.

"Bastard!" Vivian trembled with fury.

Ethan merely chuckled, swiping his thumb across the blood at his lip.

"I'll always be here for you, Vivian."

"Don't call me that!" Her ears burned crimson. "We're practically strangers!"

One dark eyebrow arched. "After last night? I'd say we're intimately acquainted."

"You—!" Vivian's face flamed. "If you dare breathe a word of this—"

"Why wouldn't I?" Ethan closed the distance between them. "Unless you want people thinking I'm... inadequate."

"You are inadequate."

The air turned to ice.

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Clearly I didn't try hard enough last night."

His fingers locked around her wrist.

"Let go!" Panic laced Vivian's voice.

"I have a reputation to uphold." His breath scorched her neck. "Especially..."

He nipped at her earlobe. "...when my Vivian has such... misconceptions."

A violent shiver ran through her.

That absolute devil!
###Chapter 453

Morning light filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a soft glow across the room. Ethan Roscente propped himself up on one elbow, gazing at Vivian Laurent asleep in his arms.

His fingertips brushed aside the stray strands of hair from her forehead. A faint smile played at the corners of his lips.

Vivian's eyelashes fluttered. She jerked awake, her eyes flying open.

"Morning," Ethan murmured, his voice still rough with sleep.

Vivian slapped his hand away and rolled to the edge of the bed, dragging the sheets with her. She glared at him like a bristling cat.

Ethan chuckled low in his throat. "Running away?"

"Who's running?" She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at him. "I need to get dressed!"

He obligingly turned his back. The rustle of fabric followed, then the sharp slam of the door.

Alone in the empty room, Ethan reached for his phone and dialed his assistant.

Thirty minutes later, he stood before the mirror, adjusting the tie of his custom-tailored suit. The memory of Vivian's hasty escape made his throat tighten.

In the café, Emily Garnache was video-calling a friend when she spotted Ethan. She fumbled to end the call.

"Mr. Roscente?"

His gaze flicked to the two coffee cups on her table. "Have you seen Vivian?"

Emily nearly choked on her drink. Vivian? The affectionate nickname sent shivers down her spine.

"N-no," she stammered, her eyes darting to a sliver of fabric peeking out from behind a potted plant.

Ethan followed her glance. The shadow behind the foliage immediately shrank back. Amusement flickered in his eyes as he turned to leave.

Vivian emerged from behind a decorative column and plopped into the seat across from Emily.

"What's going on between you two?" Emily pushed a coffee toward her.

Vivian took a large gulp. "He's insane."

"Last night—"

"Nothing happened!" Vivian's voice rose sharply, drawing glances from nearby patrons. She lowered it to a hiss. "I slept in the guest room. He had the master bedroom."

Emily eyed her friend's flushed ears skeptically.

Vivian suddenly stood. "I'm going back to sleep."

"Your room's the other way."

"Feel like using your bed today." Vivian strode off without looking back.

Emily watched her retreating figure, sipping her coffee thoughtfully.

Vivian locked the door behind her and collapsed onto the soft bedding. Staring at the ceiling, her fingers absently drifted to her abdomen.

Fragments of last night's recklessness flashed through her mind. No precautions. No defenses. Like a sudden storm.

She pulled out her phone and searched for the time limit on emergency contraception. Seventy-two hours. Still time. She'd get it tomorrow. Right now, she needed rest.

Ethan stood on the yacht's deck, the sea breeze tousling his hair. Theo's wails pierced through the phone.

"Daddy's coming home," he said before hanging up. Then he texted Emily.

As the setting sun painted the ocean gold, the yacht cut through the waves, leaving the island behind. Ethan glanced back at the shrinking villa, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 454

Emily Garnache pushed open the door to find Vivian Laurent staring blankly out the window.

"Mr. Roscente asked me to tell you he had urgent business," Emily said cautiously, studying Vivian's expression. "He said...he'll visit tomorrow."

Vivian's fingers tightened unconsciously around the curtain.

"I don't care if he comes." She turned her back to Emily. "He can stay away forever."

When Ethan Roscente returned to the mansion, the wall lamps still glowed in the living room.

Theo Evans curled on the sofa, his eyes swollen like peaches.

"Uncle Ethan!" The boy threw himself into Ethan's arms, voice trembling. "I miss Mommy...Can we go to her house?"

Ethan frowned, noticing Theo's shaking.

Sophia Evans' threat still echoed in the child's ears: "Disobey me, and I'll throw you in the river!"

Theo clutched Ethan's sleeve desperately. The bruises from his mother's last beating still burned beneath his clothes.

"How about the amusement park tomorrow?" Ethan wiped Theo's tears. "You'll meet your new aunt."

Theo shook his head violently.

"I want Mommy!" His wails tore through the room. "Don't you want me either?"

Ethan's chest tightened. He recalled Vivian's icy gaze, then looked down at the sobbing child in his arms.

"Alright." He sighed in resignation. "We'll see Mommy tomorrow."

Theo buried his face in Ethan's shoulder, tears soaking the expensive suit. He couldn't mention the cigarette burns. Just like he hid the bruise ointment in his backpack.
###Chapter 455

Ethan Roscente had planned to visit Vivian Laurent the next day. But he changed his mind at the last minute, bringing Theo Evans to Sophia Evans' residence instead.

Theo clung to Ethan's sleeve as they stepped out of the car. The boy peeked at the front door with fearful eyes.

Sophia had been waiting. She had carefully styled the unblemished side of her face while covering the injured part with gauze. Hearing the doorbell, she immediately put on a bright smile.

"Ethan, you're finally here."

She knew he was her only lifeline. Without him, she had nothing.

"Theo wanted to see you," Ethan said coldly.

Sophia crouched down and reached out to the boy. "Come here, sweetheart."

Theo hesitated, looking to Ethan for reassurance.

"What's wrong? Don't you recognize your own mother?" Sophia's voice turned sharp.

Sensing the threat, Theo shuffled toward her reluctantly.

Sophia carried him into another room. The moment the door closed, her expression darkened as she whispered threats into the child's ear.

Soon, she returned to the living room with Theo in tow.

"Ethan, Theo says he wants to go shopping with us," she said sweetly. "Our family hasn't spent time together in so long."

Ethan frowned. "I'm busy."

Sophia pinched Theo's arm discreetly. Tears welled up in the boy's eyes from the pain.

"Uncle Ethan..." Theo sniffled. "I want to go with Mommy and Daddy..."

Seizing the moment, Sophia pressed, "Can't we fulfill our child's wish?"

Ethan shot her an icy glare. "Tell me what you want, and I'll buy it for you."

Sophia's smile froze. She knew today's plan had failed.

Theo watched his mother nervously, afraid she would lash out again.

Suppressing her rage, Sophia forced a gentle tone. "Then... next time, will you take me along?"

Ethan's expression gave her the answer before he spoke.

Her jaw tightened. It didn't matter. She had time. As long as she could still see Ethan, there would be other opportunities.

This game was just beginning.
###Chapter 456

Ethan Roscente texted that he couldn't reach the island.

Vivian Laurent glanced at her phone before tossing it aside.

She didn't care.

Morning sunlight danced on the ocean waves as Vivian finished breakfast in haste.

"Emily, I need to go downtown." She packed her bag quickly. "Take care of Fiona for me."

Emily Garnache gave a thumbs-up. "No problem."

The yacht had just left the dock when her phone rang urgently.

"Vivian!" Emily's panicked voice came through. "Fiona's having an episode!"

Vivian immediately turned the boat around.

Back at the villa, Fiona Grandelle was curled in a corner, trembling violently.

"What happened?" Vivian rushed forward.

Emily pointed to a phone on the floor. "She was fine one second, then collapsed."

The screen still glowed.

Vivian picked it up and froze—Sophia Evans' publicity photo stared back.

That flawless face acted like a key, unlocking Fiona's traumatic memories.

"Fiona." Vivian gently tapped the closet door. "It's me."

Silence.

After a patient wait, she opened the door.

Fiona huddled like a frightened animal.

"That woman," Vivian crawled inside and sat beside her, "is mentally unstable."

Fiona lifted her tear-streaked face.

"Seriously." Vivian's tone hardened. "She's getting torn apart online right now."

She helped Fiona out and pulled up news articles.

Screen after screen condemned Sophia.

"See? She's bullied many people." Vivian scrolled. "Not just you."

Fiona's breathing steadied.

Vivian kept reading when suddenly her finger stopped.

Her eyes locked onto a breaking news headline.
###Chapter 457

A post suddenly surfaced on the forum, claiming Sophia Evans might have a love child.

The post was vague—no evidence, no mention of the child's gender, and no details about the father.

The comment section exploded.

"Rumors? With Sophia's frail health, how could she even carry a child?"

"Exactly. Her schedule is packed. Pregnancy and postpartum recovery would take months. There's no way it wouldn't have leaked."

"Wait, isn't she dating Ethan Roscente? Could it be his?"

Vivian Laurent skimmed the comments before closing the tab. She didn’t believe a word of these baseless claims.

She screenshotted other discussions about Sophia and sent them to Fiona Grandelle.

By the time she finished reassuring Fiona, dusk had settled outside.

Vivian checked the time. Getting the emergency contraceptive would have to wait.

The morning-after pill had a 72-hour window. Only 48 hours had passed. She still had time tomorrow.

But the next morning, a storm raged.

Rain hammered against the windows like bullets. Wind and water lashed the city.

The downpour eased by afternoon, but flooded streets made travel dangerous.

Vivian couldn’t wait any longer.

She braved the storm in a speedboat, struggling to dock in the dark.

Her first stop was the pharmacy.

She swallowed the pill with cold water and exhaled in relief.

Then her brows furrowed—taking it this late would weaken its effectiveness.

"It should still work..." She gripped the pillbox, reassuring herself.

......

During their stay on the private island, Fiona gradually stabilized.

Vivian decided to take her back to the royal palace first.

The surgery was scheduled in two weeks.

Vivian devoted all her attention to Fiona, unaware of the eyes watching her from the shadows.

DarkKingdom Headquarters.

Zero toyed with her phone, the screen displaying a grainy photo of Vivian walking beside Ethan Roscente.

It had been taken on a street in the Kingdom of Eudora, the distance making the image blurry.

Zero had uncovered most of the mystery surrounding "Shadow."

After the mission gone wrong four years ago, Vivian had chosen the most thorough way to disappear—a complete transformation.

From a sharp, lethal agent to a plain, unremarkable housewife, she’d stayed hidden by Ethan’s side for three years.

No wonder they hadn’t found her, no matter how deep they dug.

Now that the divorce was finalized, she’d resurfaced.

"This time..." Zero narrowed her eyes. "You won’t escape."
###Chapter 458

Zero's fingers traced the phone screen absently. Complex emotions swirled in his eyes.

Four years.

She hadn't contacted him once.

Even after her rebirth, she'd left him buried in the recesses of her memory.

Perhaps she'd already moved on, unwilling to even speak his name.

It was time to make her remember.

"Master." Annika's voice came from behind, tentative.

She'd been standing there awhile, watching Zero stare at his phone.

As she approached, she glimpsed the photo onscreen. Her pupils constricted.

That woman... it was the legendary Shadow.

After all these years, he still kept her picture?

Zero locked the screen instantly. His expression smoothed when he turned. "Yes?"

"I just completed an S-rank mission." Annika smiled sweetly. "I wanted to celebrate with you."

She gazed up at him, eyes brimming with admiration.

Zero frowned slightly.

Lately, he'd noticed Annika resembled Shadow more and more.

But Shadow never smiled so obediently. Her eyes had always burned with defiance, arrogant as a queen.

Missions were routine for her. She'd never make a fuss over completing one.

Annika tensed as Zero's gaze grew distant.

He was looking at her, yet seeing someone else.

Shadow again.

Jealousy coiled in her chest like a venomous snake. How could this woman she'd never met hold her master's heart so completely?

"Master?" Her voice rose sharply.

Zero's focus snapped back. His tone turned cool. "Go ahead without me. I have business."

He stood and left without hesitation.

Annika's smile froze. Her nails dug bloody crescents into her palms.

Back in his room, Zero logged into the Dark Web.

With practiced ease, he switched accounts. First, he posted a bounty—50 billion for the assassination of F Kingdom's royal family.

Then he accepted the contract with another account.

The screen's blue glow illuminated his face, etching a predatory smile.

Time to set the hook.

......

Vivian jolted awake to insistent ringing.

She fumbled for her phone. Isabella's name flashed onscreen.

"What's wrong?" She was instantly alert.

"Check the Dark Web!" Isabella's voice crackled with excitement. "Someone posted a 50-billion bounty on the King of F Kingdom!"
###Chapter 459

"Who issued the contract?" Vivian tapped her fingers against the desk.

Isabella's voice came through the phone. "An anonymous post on the Dark Web. Fifty billion bounty for the King of Eudora's head."

"Any takers?"

"Yes." Isabella hesitated. "My analysis suggests DarkKingdom accepted it. The operative is most likely Zero."

Vivian's grip tightened around her phone.

Assassinating a head of state?

The king's security was impenetrable. This mission bordered on impossible. She knew the Dark Web's rules—failure meant tenfold penalty. Fifty billion becoming five hundred. How could Zero possibly pay?

Worse still, capture meant facing international tribunal.

"Our organization never takes high-risk contracts like this," Vivian's voice strained.

"Exactly why it's suspicious." Isabella sighed. "What's his angle?"

"Keep monitoring." Vivian drew a deep breath. "Alert me immediately if anything changes."

"Understood. By the way, how's Fiona's surgery prep going?"

"Ryan's en route." Vivian gazed out the window. "Let's hope everything goes smoothly this time."

The call ended. Vivian sank into thought.

That failed mission four years ago was no accident. She still remembered the searing pain of the bullet through her shoulder. Those icy eyes in the darkness. Someone had betrayed her—yet no traces were ever found.

Now Zero walked the same dangerous path.

She closed her eyes. The boy who'd helped her up during training sessions. The partner who'd taken a knife for her in the rain. Even after leaving the organization, their bond remained.

May fate be kinder to him this time.

......

Three days later, Ryan stood gaping at the gilded palace gates.

"Dr. Laurent, this is..."

"Welcome to the Royal Palace of Eudora." Vivian smiled. "Fiona is the princess here."

Ryan's knees nearly buckled.
###Chapter 460

After their conversation, Vivian Laurent led Ryan Fairsprene to Fiona Grandelle's residence.

Ryan was already aware of Fiona's deteriorating condition.

The room was dim when they opened the door. Vivian called softly, "Fiona, Dr. Fairsprene is here."

Fiona immediately buried her face in her arms.

"Dr. Fairsprene flew ten hours from Country C just to see you," Vivian approached the bed. "He came straight here without even stopping for water."

"I look... terrible right now."

Vivian held her trembling hand. "Dr. Fairsprene isn't a stranger. You two got along well before."

Ryan knelt beside the bed, his voice warm. "I heard you visited an island? I've never seen the real ocean. Will you take me next time?"

He wore a simple white shirt, his hair still carrying traces of travel. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a glow on his shoulders that made him appear radiant.

Fiona slowly lifted her head.

Vivian quietly exited the room, gently closing the door behind her.

With surgery approaching, it was good for them to spend time together.

Whatever Ryan said must have worked—when Vivian saw Fiona again, the girl's eyes had regained their sparkle.

The King had shielded Fiona completely from the outside turmoil.

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente kept appearing like a ghost during Vivian's busiest moments.

Finally, Vivian had enough and dragged him into the garden.

"Are you done yet?"

"Not even close." Ethan's gaze burned. "I just wanted to see you."

"See what?" Vivian turned away. "Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"

"No drinking this time," he stepped closer. "Just looking."

The sight of her made even breathing feel lighter. The mountains of paperwork and exhausting meetings suddenly seemed trivial.

"I'm busy!" Vivian raised her defenses.

Ethan retreated half a step. "Fine, I'll leave."

Then he suddenly pulled her into an embrace.

"Eth—"

"Just one hug." He rested his chin on her head. "I can't come tomorrow. How long will the surgery take?"

"The whole day."

"Can I call?"

"No!"

Ethan released her. "Then I'll text. You don't have to read them."

Vivian glared.

The man was utterly hopeless.
###Chapter 461

The operating room equipment had been personally selected by Queen Eleanor. Vivian Laurent inspected each piece meticulously, confirming everything was in order.

Ryan Fairsprene stood nearby preparing the surgical instruments. Though only a resident, his foundational skills were impeccable.

Fiona Grandelle lay on the operating table, her fingers gripping the sheets tightly. The Queen stood by the doorway, her face etched with worry.

"Dr. Laurent, my daughter's face suffered secondary damage during the last revision surgery," the Queen's voice trembled. "Her recovery depends entirely on you now."

Vivian pulled on her gloves. "I'll give it my all."

The surgical lights blazed to life. The scar tissue on Fiona's face had formed over a decade ago - dark brown keloids crawling across half her face like centipedes.

Vivian picked up the scalpel. This type of mature scar required excision and skin grafting, a procedure most surgeons wouldn't dare attempt.

Ryan watched Vivian's hands with rapt attention. Each incision was executed with flawless precision, as though she were sculpting a masterpiece.

Meanwhile, Sophia Evans was executing her own scheme. She'd timed it perfectly - Ethan Roscente had an important board meeting today.

"Have Theo slip out through the back," she whispered to the nanny, pressing a note into her hand. "Tell them he was crying for his mother."

The news reached Ethan within minutes.

"Young master, Theo is missing!" The butler rushed in, sweat beading on his forehead.

Ethan shot to his feet. "Since when?"

"He said he wanted to find his mother...then vanished when we turned around."

Ethan immediately dialed Sophia's number. Over-the-top sobs answered him. "My baby! I need to find him!"

Amid the chaos, Sophia slipped out of the mansion. Theo waited by the designated fountain, just as planned.

"Mommy!" He ran toward her. "Let's go home..."

Sophia seized his wrist. "Mommy's taking you for ice cream."

She dragged the child toward the shopping district, deliberately choosing crowded routes. Theo stumbled along, his small face clouded with unease.
###Chapter 462

Sophia Evans gripped Theo's small hand tightly, her sunglasses hiding her eyes.

"Say 'Mommy,' sweetheart," she cooed, crouching down to his level.

Theo licked his ice cream cone timidly. "Mommy."

"Louder." She squeezed his fingers.

"Mommy!" Theo shouted.

Passersby turned their heads. Someone whispered, "Isn't that actress Sophia Evans?"

Sophia abruptly quickened her pace. Theo stumbled behind her.

"Wait for me, Mommy!" He stomped his foot in frustration.

"Call me by my full name," Sophia commanded without stopping.

"Sophia Evans Mommy!"

The outburst drew a crowd. Phones appeared, recording the scene.

"My God, Sophia has a child?"

"That boy looks at least three or four years old."

Within thirty minutes, #SophiaEvansLoveChild trended at the top of social media.

Comments exploded.

"I always heard rumors about her having a kid!"

"Who's the father? Not that Roscente Group heir, is it?"

"Showbiz is so shady. Probably some sugar daddy's spawn."

"Wasn't she filming 'City of Desire' three years ago? When did she have time to give birth?"

"Desperate D-lister using her kid for clout."

Ethan Roscente's meeting was interrupted when his assistant rushed in with a tablet.

His face darkened instantly. "Take down every trending post," he ordered security. "Find Theo now."

Meanwhile, Sophia dragged Theo into a bubble tea shop.

"Theo, wouldn't you like Uncle Ethan to be your daddy?" She stroked his hair.

The boy's eyes lit up. "Yes! But he said he needs to marry Aunt Vivian first."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"That Vivian Laurent is evil." Her voice trembled. "She's the reason Mommy's life is ruined."

Theo blinked in confusion.

"When Uncle Ethan has his own children, he'll throw you away." Sophia whispered in his ear. "Everyone will call you a bastard."

Theo's ice cream splattered on the floor.
###Chapter 463

"I'm not a bastard! Mommy, I'm not!" Theo burst into tears, terrified by Sophia's harsh words.

Sophia yanked his arm. "Keep crying and those people outside will say worse things. Your father's dead. You're a fatherless bastard now."

She crouched down, her nails digging into his skin. "Go beg your uncle. Get on your knees and ask him to be your daddy. If he refuses, cry until he gives in."

"But—"

"No buts!" Sophia's voice turned shrill. "Either Ethan publicly claims you as his son, or we both die!"

Theo trembled, shrinking into himself. He didn’t understand why his mother had become so frightening.

The mall buzzed with noise.

"Theo!" Ethan's voice cut through the crowd from behind.

Theo spun around and flung himself at Ethan, sobbing. "Daddy!"

Click. Camera shutters erupted around them.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. He scooped the boy up, his gaze sharp as a blade as it landed on Sophia. "You taught him that?"

Sophia flicked her hair. "Ethan, is it wrong for a child to miss his father?" She reached for his arm. "Our little family hasn’t had a chance to—"

"Enough." Ethan stepped back, avoiding her touch. "Theo, let’s go home with Uncle."

Theo glanced hesitantly at Sophia.

"Daddy..." he whispered pleadingly. "Can Mommy come with us?"

Ethan ignored the question and strode away with Theo in his arms. Sophia chased after them, her stilettos clacking frantically against the tiles.

"Ethan! Theo! Wait for me!"

Camera shutters continued firing around them.

Three hours later, #EthanSophiaSecretMarriage trended at number one.

The comments exploded:
"Proof! The kid called him Daddy!"
"Sophia's playing the long game. That rich wife title is hers now."
"Didn’t Ethan gift her a yacht for her birthday? That’s true love right there."

Photos of Ethan carrying Theo and Sophia chasing after them with teary eyes flooded social media, captioned with "Second Chance Romance" in pink text.
###Chapter 464

Ethan Roscente remained silent throughout the ride, his oppressive aura suffocating the car's interior. Neon lights from outside flickered across his tense jawline, casting sharp shadows.

Theo Evans huddled in the corner of his seat, tiny fingers gripping the seatbelt. He'd never seen his uncle like this—the man who used to coax him gently to take medicine now felt like a stranger.

Sophia Evans gazed absently at the passing scenery, her manicured nails tapping rhythmically against the leather seat. A faint smile played on her lips, but her eyes were glacial.

"Ethan, children will be children," Sophia suddenly purred, her voice dripping with poisoned honey. "Blame me for failing as a mother."

Ethan slammed the brakes.

Tires screeched against asphalt. He turned, his gaze razor-sharp. "Teaching him to call me 'Dad' in public? Staging that 'accidental' mall encounter? Do you think everyone's a fool?"

Sophia's pupils contracted. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms. She covered her face, shoulders trembling. "So this is how you see me..."

"Enough!" Ethan's fist crashed against the steering wheel. The car's perfume bottle rattled violently.

Theo burst into tears. Fat droplets stained his seatbelt, spreading dark patches.

Ethan exhaled sharply, unbuckling to crouch beside the child. "This isn't your fault, Theo."

Sophia seized Ethan's wrist. "You'd believe a child's lies over me?"

Wrenching free, Ethan carried Theo toward the mansion. Moonlight stretched his shadow into a blade cleaving through the night.

When the chandelier flickered on, Sophia saw the blizzard in Ethan's eyes. She stumbled back, heels clicking against marble.

"Simon's handling the trending scandal." Ethan handed Theo to the nanny, his suit jacket slicing the air as he turned. "If I find you orchestrated this—"

Sophia laughed suddenly. Her earrings swayed as she tilted her head. "Investigate then. Dig as deep as you did for your brother's death."

The air froze.

Ethan pinned her against the wall by the throat, veins bulging. Gasping for air, Sophia still smiled, her crimson nails trailing down his cheek.

"Let go," she wheezed. "Unless you want Theo to witness...a murder."

Ethan released her instantly. Sophia collapsed, coughing violently, her silk dress pooling like faded blood.

Footsteps echoed from upstairs. Ethan looked up to see Theo clutching a teddy bear, face ghostly pale.

Schooling his expression, Ethan bounded up the stairs. As he lifted the child, his phone lit up. He sent Vivian Laurent a voice message: "Ignore the news. Wait for my explanation."

Sophia adjusted her collar, watching the nursery door click shut. She wiped fabricated tears, then pulled out her phone. The disappearing热搜词条 (trending topic) reflected in her cold smirk.
###Chapter 465

The operating room lights dimmed as Vivian's fingertips trembled slightly.

Fiona Grandelle's face was wrapped in layers of bandages, like an artwork awaiting unveiling. In two weeks, those hideous scars would vanish forever.

"Dr. Laurent, you've worked hard." Ryan Fairsprene handed her a disinfectant wipe.

Vivian accepted it, the lingering scent of antiseptic clinging to her fingers. "You did well."

Ryan's ears turned faintly pink. "I learned from you."

At the end of the corridor, Queen Eleanor waited anxiously. After a brief update, Vivian entrusted the postoperative instructions to Ryan.

Only when cold water slid down her throat in the break room did she notice the ache in her shoulders. Leaning against the wall, she slowly stretched her stiff neck.

"Vivian!" Emily Garnache rushed over, hesitating.

Vivian arched a brow. "Since when do you stammer?"

Emily shoved a phone into her hands. "You need to see this."

The lock screen was flooded with unread messages. Ethan Roscente's chat sat at the top—just three words: "Trust me."

Scrolling down, Finn Deross's text popped up: "Master, that Roscente bastard isn't worthy of you!" Lucas Lefèvre's voice message seethed: "I'm going to break his legs!"

Isabella Langley had sent over twenty texts, each one cursing Sophia Evans's entire lineage.

Vivian tapped into the trending page. The top hashtag screamed: #SophiaEvansSon. Right below it: #EthanRoscenteLoveChild and #SophiaEvansDreamsShattered.
###Chapter 466

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she tapped open the trending topic.

A flood of discussions filled her screen—all about Sophia Evans being photographed with Ethan Roscente and a child.

"That kid called Mr. Roscente 'Daddy'! Must be his real son!"

"Sophia hid this well. Fans thought she was a single goddess, but her kid's already walking and talking."

"Disgusting. Playing the innocent virgin while secretly having a child. She should be canceled."

Though Ethan had swiftly removed the trending tag, the damage was done. Screenshots and gossip had already spread like wildfire across every platform.

Vivian stared at her phone, her chest heavy as if weighed down by a stone.

"Vivian..." Emily Garnache approached cautiously. "Are you okay?"

"Why wouldn't I be?" Vivian forced a smile. "It's just tabloid gossip."

"But they're saying... it's Mr. Roscente's child..."

Emily hesitated. Everyone knew Ethan had been pursuing Vivian. What did this sudden child mean?

"It doesn't matter." Vivian's voice was eerily calm. "It has nothing to do with me."

She calculated the timeline silently. The child was over three years old. They had only been married for three years.

That meant Sophia had been pregnant before their wedding.

No wonder Ethan had chased her to the airport back then.

Outwardly composed, Vivian dug her nails deep into her palms.

"I'm tired. I need to rest." She stood abruptly and walked to her bedroom without looking back.

The palace was silent in the dead of night.

Ethan stood outside Vivian's door, an unlit cigarette between his fingers. He debated knocking but feared disturbing her.

Inside, Vivian tossed and turned.

Exhausted but sleepless, the cruel words haunted her mind.

She thought she had moved on. Yet seeing Ethan with Sophia's child still made her heart twist.

Turns out, she still cared.

If she had known, she never would have married him. Never would have entangled with him after the divorce.

Ethan Roscente—you're nothing but a liar.
###Chapter 467

The night was pitch black. Sophia Evans paced restlessly through the mansion.

She had searched every corner but found no trace of Ethan Roscente.

Her fingernails dug into her palms as she clenched her jaw.

He must have gone to see that bitch again.

The mental image made her chest tighten with suffocating rage.

She violently pushed open Theo's bedroom door.

The sleeping child was jerked awake by her rough grip.

"Ouch..." Theo's cry pierced the silent night.

Sophia grabbed his collar.

"Stop your whining! Your father's gone to that homewrecker again!"

Her palm struck his back with a sharp slap.

"If he abandons us, you'll be an orphan!"

Theo nodded fearfully, tears soaking his pajamas.

"Call him. Now!"

Sophia snarled the command.

...

Down the palace corridor, Vivian Laurent gently pushed open her door.

Moonlight outlined the tall silhouette of a man.

She gasped.

"You—"

Before she could finish, strong arms pulled her into a warm embrace.

Ethan rested his chin atop her head.

"I've been waiting."

She could feel his rapid heartbeat against her.

"Why didn't you come in?"

His arms tightened around her.

"Didn't want to disturb you."

His voice sounded hoarse.

Only then did Vivian notice the dark circles under his eyes.

"How long have you been standing here?"

Ethan didn't answer, burying his face in the crook of her neck instead.

"About the news—"

Vivian interrupted him.

"I saw everything."

His body tensed.

"Let me explain."

At that moment, his phone suddenly rang.
###Chapter 468

Vivian stood under the dim corridor lights, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Congratulations, Ethan." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "A beautiful wife and a lovely son. You've won at life."

Ethan's breath hitched.

He reached for her, but she sidestepped his touch. The night wind rushed through the open window, scattering the faint scent of her perfume.

"It's not what you think," he said, his voice strained.

Vivian's gaze fixed on the undone button at his collar. The memory of that suspicious scratch on his neck from their last meeting flashed through her mind.

"Theo is Sophia's child," Ethan admitted, his Adam's apple bobbing. "But he's actually—"

A shrill ringtone cut him off.

Vivian arched a brow. "Aren't you going to answer? Maybe your son misses his daddy."

Ethan pulled out his phone. The name "Theo" glared brightly on the screen. The moment he accepted the call, a tearful voice cried out, "Daddy!"

Vivian let out a soft, mocking laugh.

She adjusted her shawl and turned to leave. Ethan grabbed her wrist, his fingers burning against her skin.

"Wait," he rasped.

On the other end of the line, Theo sniffled. "Daddy, where are you? It's so dark in here..."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Is Sophia with you?"

Hidden in the shadows, Sophia clamped a hand over her mouth. Theo paused for two seconds before bursting into loud sobs. "I want Daddy to come home now!"

"I'll be there soon."

When the call ended, Ethan realized Vivian hadn't moved. Moonlight streamed through the glass, casting fractured shadows across her profile.

"Vivi—"

The elevator dinged as it arrived on their floor. Without looking back, Vivian stepped inside. As the metal doors slid shut, he caught the fleeting motion of her hand brushing against her cheek.
###Chapter 469

"No explanations needed, Ethan Roscente."

Vivian Laurent's voice was icy.

"I waited here just to tell you—your personal affairs are none of my business. Whether that child is yours or not, it has nothing to do with me."

She lifted her chin, her gaze resolute.

"We're divorced. The past should stay in the past. Don't disturb my life again."

Ethan studied her stubborn profile, recognizing her anger.

"Vivian, Theo isn't actually my son. He's—"

She let out a cold laugh.

"Not your son? Then why does he call you Daddy? Since when did Ethan Roscente become so charitable, raising another man's child?"

She turned toward the bedroom.

"I said it's none of my concern. Your son is waiting at home. You should go."

The door slammed shut.

Ethan stood outside, knocking lightly.

Silence greeted him.

He sighed. The fragile peace they'd rebuilt had shattered again.

Vivian needed time to cool off. And Theo required attention.

Ethan decided to give her space while he handled matters at home.

The mansion stood dark when he returned.

Only Theo's room held light.

"Theo."

Ethan strode inside.

"Uncle Ethan!"

The little boy reached out for a hug.

Instead of scooping him up as usual, Ethan remained stern by the bed.

"Theodore Evans, tell me why you did that?"

Hearing his full name, Theo shrank back.

"Uncle... I don't understand..."

The child's eyes were red and swollen from prolonged crying.

"You called me Daddy on the phone but Uncle now? Did Sophia Evans put you up to this?"

Theo shook his head violently.

"Not Mommy! I had a nightmare... Everyone called me a fatherless bastard... I was scared..."

Ethan crouched to eye level.

"Theo, liars grow long noses. Tell me the truth. I promise not to be angry or blame your mother."

The boy bit his lip, tears welling.

Torn between fear and guilt, he remained silent.

Ethan didn't press further.

He gently patted Theo's back.

"Sleep now. I'll stay with you."

But fury burned within him toward Sophia. To manipulate her own son—the woman was utterly depraved.
###Chapter 470

Theo's eyelids grew heavy as he drifted into sleep in Ethan's warm embrace.

Ethan lay awake, staring at the ceiling.

Vivian's icy glare haunted his thoughts.

Her cruel words pierced his heart like daggers.

He had worked so hard to earn her trust.

Now he had to start all over again.

Ethan grabbed his phone and typed rapidly.

He detailed Sophia's past with Alexander.

Explained Theo was his late brother's child.

Described why he'd raised the boy all these years.

Finally begged Vivian for a chance to explain in person.

A glaring red exclamation mark appeared upon sending.

Vivian had blocked him.

Ethan gave a bitter laugh.

This was exactly Vivian's style.

But her anger meant she cared, didn't it?

The thought warmed his chest.

He longed to rush to her immediately.

But Theo still slept, tiny fingers clutching his shirt.

At dawn, Theo woke.

He found Ethan hadn't moved all night.

The boy's nose tingled.

Uncle had stayed in the same position just for him.

Yet remembering his mother's instructions, he forced himself to keep pretending.

Ethan had slept barely two hours.

As he led Theo out, Sophia stood waiting in full glamour.

Her designer dress and flawless makeup looked painfully out of place.

"Ethan," she cooed.

His brows furrowed. "You shouldn't be here."

She ignored him. "I made breakfast. Your favorites."

Theo tugged Ethan's hand. "Uncle, let's try it?"

At the table, Ethan barely touched his food.

He fixed Sophia with a stare. "We need to talk."

In the study, Ethan cut straight to the point. "I'm sending you abroad. You'll want for nothing, but never contact Theo again."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

She forced a smile. "You've seen the online hate Theo gets. If people think he's fatherless..."

"What are you implying?"

"Ethan, just acknowledge him as your son. For Theo's sake."
###Chapter 471

Ethan Roscente's gaze was as sharp as a blade, piercing straight through Sophia Evans.

Sophia's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her dress.

"Ethan..." Her voice trembled. "Don't look at me like that."

She took a deep breath, forcing composure. "I know you're angry, but I'm only thinking of Theo. That online bullying will destroy our child."

Ethan let out a cold laugh. "You orchestrated this?"

"How could you think that?" Sophia's expression turned wounded. "I'm just a mother protecting her child."

She delicately wiped nonexistent tears from her eyes. "If you insist on being with Vivian Laurent, I'll take Theo away. Forever."

Ethan's knuckles cracked as his fists clenched.

"Get out!" He growled.

Sophia rose gracefully. "Theo can't live without me. If he sneaks out to find me again..."

She paused meaningfully. "Think carefully. A child's mental health can't be neglected."

With that, she turned and descended the stairs with elegant poise.

Ethan slammed his fist into the wall. Blood oozed from his split knuckles.

That venomous woman.

Now he understood why the princess had dealt with her so harshly.

Sophia didn't deserve to be a mother.

Theo's muffled sobs drifted upstairs.

"Uncle..." The child held up his phone with tear-filled eyes. "They all say I'm a bastard..."

Sophia gently stroked Theo's hair, her lips curling in victory.

"Uncle, can you be my daddy?" Theo looked up with hopeful eyes.

Ethan's chest constricted.

"Theo, remember this—I'll always be your uncle."

"Then am I really a fatherless child?" Theo cried harder. "They curse Mommy...say she's a bad woman..."

Sophia suddenly pulled the boy into her arms.

"It's alright, darling." Her voice quivered with false emotion. "Mommy will take you away from here. Even if we have to beg, I'll provide for you."

She lifted her chin, challenging Ethan. "If we can't survive, we'll die together."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple.

"Sophia Evans!" He spat her name through clenched teeth.

That woman deserved to burn in hell.
###Chapter 472

Theo's face was flushed from crying, his tiny hands clutching desperately at Ethan Roscente's sleeve. "Uncle Ethan, don't make us leave... Will you be my daddy?"

Ethan felt like a blunt knife was carving through his chest.

This was his late brother's only child.

He had raised the boy as his own.

Watching the child's tear-streaked face, Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

Finally, he managed one word. "Okay."

......

Dark circles shadowed Vivian Laurent's eyes.

Fiona Grandelle's surgery had been successful. Now she just needed rest. Vivian had arranged for Ryan Fairsprene to stay in the Kingdom of Eudora for a week of observation.

The bandages would come off in two weeks, revealing the results.

It was time to go home.

Emily Garnache would accompany her. Her father's constant demands meant she'd be dragged back if she delayed any longer.

Queen Eleanor grasped Vivian's hands. "Dr. Laurent, I'm only one month along. I'm so worried—"

"Your vitals are perfectly stable," Vivian reassured gently. "Contact me immediately if anything changes."

Fiona's eyes reddened.

"When you've transformed into a beautiful young lady, come find me." Vivian pinched her cheek. "Be brave."

At the boarding gate, Emily hesitated. "Vivian... You're really not telling Mr. Roscente?"

"No need." Vivian's voice was calm. "We're strangers now."

She'd deleted all their contacts.

Emily gritted her teeth. That man must be blind!

Throughout the long flight, Vivian kept her eyes closed.

Upon landing, Emily suddenly gasped.

"What is it?" Vivian turned.

"N-nothing!" Emily hastily hid her phone.

Vivian extended her hand. "Show me."

The screen displayed a photo of Ethan holding Theo at a public event. The caption screamed: "Roscente Group CEO Acknowledges Love Child."
###Chapter 473

"Since it's nothing, let me see."

Emily Garnache tightened her grip on the phone before reluctantly handing it over.

The screen displayed the latest trending headline: Ethan Roscente, CEO of Roscente Group, publicly acknowledged the child beside Sophia Evans as his biological son.

An accompanying paparazzi photo showed a boy with features unmistakably resembling Ethan's.

Vivian Laurent stared at the screen, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Liar.

That night, Ethan had stood outside her door, swearing the child had nothing to do with him.

Now the whole world knew.

The article also mentioned Ethan had sued over a dozen internet trolls for malicious rumors, shielding the child from public scrutiny.

How laughable.

If the boy truly wasn't his, why go to such lengths?

So all these years, Ethan had been abroad with Sophia and their son.

While she remained clueless, like a fool.

A crushing weight pressed against her chest, making each breath labored.

"Here." Vivian shoved the phone back into Emily's hands.

"Vivian..." Emily hesitated.

"What?" Vivian forced a smile. "I'm fine."

At the airport parking lot, Lucas Lefèvre had been waiting.

"Vivian." His voice carried unspoken complexity.

She yanked the car door open. "Why the long faces? Dinner's on me tonight. Call Isabella and the others—we're drinking till dawn!"

The car headed toward Vivian's restaurant.

The sneaky waiter had been fired, and the place now gleamed with renovations.

Inside the private dining room, Finn Deross rushed forward first.

"Master!" He spread his arms for a hug.

Vivian sidestepped him. "Cut it out."

"I missed you," Finn pouted. "You went to Eudora without me."

"Enough." She flicked his forehead. "I'll be reviewing your recent performance."

The group tactfully avoided sensitive topics, and laughter soon filled the room.

Only Vivian knew her knuckles had turned white around her wineglass.
###Chapter 474

Ethan Roscente stood by the floor-to-ceiling window in the palace corridor, a cigarette burning down to its filter between his fingers. He glanced at his watch. Three hours until dawn.

Light rain fell outside, blurring the night through the water-streaked glass.

He needed to tell Vivian Laurent the truth himself.

About Theo's parentage. About the scandalous headlines flooding every media outlet. He knew she would see them. And she would misunderstand.

Her contact in his phone still showed a red exclamation mark. Every social media account blocked. Emails left unanswered.

When the palace guard passed by for the third time, he hesitated. "Mr. Roscente, Dr. Laurent might already be asleep."

Ethan stubbed out the cigarette. "I'll wait."

At four in the morning, footsteps echoed from the far end of the hallway. His head snapped up—only to see Ryan Fairsprene rubbing his eyes.

"Mr. Roscente?" Ryan blinked in surprise. "What are you doing here?"

"Is Vivian still asleep?" Ethan's voice was hoarse.

Ryan's expression turned odd. "Dr. Laurent returned to Jiangcheng two days ago."

Ethan's pupils constricted. "When?"

"A private jet took her directly back." Ryan checked his watch. "She should be in the city by now."

Raindrops hammered against the glass.

Ethan's knuckles whitened. "Did she leave any message?"

"Just asked me to take care of Princess Fiona." Ryan hesitated. "Nothing else."

As Ethan turned, his elbow knocked over a vase by the window. The shattering porcelain pierced the empty corridor.

His mind flashed to the press conference three days ago. When he'd been forced to acknowledge Theo's identity, the cameras had caught a woman in sunglasses rushing from the audience.

Now he realized—it had been Vivian.

The palace gates clanged shut behind him as he dialed Finn Deross. The call rang seven times before deafening music blasted through the line.

"Where's Vivian?" Ethan demanded.

On the other end, Finn glanced at Vivian dancing wildly in the center of the club. Silently, he closed the VIP room door.
###Chapter 475

"She's...here."

"What's she doing? How's her mood? What did she say?" Ethan Roscente fired off questions in rapid succession.

Finn Deross felt his palm grow damp against the phone.

"Nothing...out of the ordinary?"

"What do you mean 'nothing out of the ordinary'?"

Finn stammered incoherently.

Ethan clicked his tongue impatiently. If Vivian Laurent had returned to the country, Finn would surely be with her. The chaotic background noise through the receiver made his brow furrow.

He initiated a video call without hesitation.

The moment the screen lit up, Ethan demanded, "Where's Vivian?"

"Right here." Finn turned the camera toward the scene behind him.

Deafening music flooded through the speakers. Multicolored strobe lights illuminated the crowded dance floor.

Finn focused the phone on the center of the pulsating mass.

"See? My mentor's having the time of her life. She's perfectly fine—hasn't even mentioned you. Frankly, since you've got a wife and kid now, you should leave her alone. She didn't even make a scene when you cheated during your marriage."

Ethan's pupils constricted violently.

In the swirling lights, Vivian moved like living shadow set aflame. The snug tank top traced every curve as her slender waist swayed to the rhythm. Her striking features glowed under the disco lights.

Hungry male gazes devoured her from every direction.

Ethan's knuckles turned white. He wanted nothing more than to fly there immediately, wrap her in his coat, and carry her home where she belonged.

"Finn, give her the phone."

"Say whatever you need to say in person. I'm not your messenger." Finn scoffed. "My mentor hates half-hearted gestures."

"I'll explain everything when I return. But I can't leave now. Just tell her the online rumors are false—ask her to trust me one more time. And that child isn't my son."

"Can't take responsibility for your own actions?" Finn sneered. "Didn't you publicly claim Theodore Evans as your son? Changing your story now?"

The call ended abruptly.

As the screen went black, Ethan slammed his fist against the wall.

How desperately he wanted to fly to her side.

But Theo was still in the hospital. With Sophia Evans proving unreliable, the boy only had his uncle now.
###Chapter 476

The strobe lights pulsed hypnotically at the center of the dance floor.

Vivian Laurent moved with unrestrained grace, every motion radiating raw energy.

Sweat glistened as it trailed down her flushed cheeks.

Stepping off the dance floor, she felt the tension drain from her body.

"Hey gorgeous, can I get your number?"

"Your moves are electrifying. Let me buy you a drink?"

"Don't leave yet, beautiful. Stay and talk?"

Men swarmed around her like moths to a flame.

Vivian didn't spare them a glance as she strode toward Isabella Langley, still dancing.

She caught Isabella's eye with a meaningful look.

Isabella immediately disengaged, following her away from the pulsating crowd.

"What's up?" Isabella picked up a blue cocktail.

"Got any exciting assignments?" Vivian swirled her drink. "I'm bored."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "What kind?"

"Surprise me." Vivian downed her glass in one go.

"Alright, let me check."

Isabella pulled out her phone, accessing an encrypted site.

"Oh," she added casually, "that mission your former organization took? It failed."

"The royal assassination?"

"Yeah. Complete radio silence now."

Vivian studied her empty glass, lost in thought.

Early next morning.

Isabella sent the mission details.

Vivian began preparations without hesitation.

"Master!" Finn Deross caught up to her. "Take me with you."

After a brief consideration, Vivian nodded.

......

Ethan Roscente gripped his phone, brow furrowed.

Neither Vivian nor Finn were answering their phones.

He paced the room in agitation.

Finally, he dialed Felix Valdemar.

"Ethan?" Felix's voice was thick with sleep.

"I need a favor."

"Shoot."

"Check if Vivian's home."

"On it."

Noon the next day.

Felix stood outside the hospital entrance.

"Dr. Laurent? She's been on leave for weeks," a nurse informed him.

Felix drove to the mansion.

The doorbell echoed unanswered through the empty house.

He circled the property twice.

"Strange..."

Felix pressed closer to the floor-to-ceiling windows, trying to peer inside.

The glare made visibility impossible.

Unaware his every move was clearly visible from within.

Isabella set down her coffee cup.

She observed the suspicious figure lurking outside.

"In broad daylight..."

She yanked the front door open.

"Hey! What are you doing?"
###Chapter 477

A faint scratching sound came from the glass window.

Isabella Langley turned toward the noise and saw a dark figure pressed against the pane.

"Felix Valdemar?" She narrowed her eyes. "Given up being human and taken up burglary now?"

Felix stumbled at the sound of her voice, nearly toppling off the windowsill.

"Isabella?" He scrambled to regain his balance. "What are you doing here?"

Moonlight glinted off Isabella's crossed arms as she smirked. "This is my house. I should be asking you that."

Felix adjusted his collar. "I'm looking for Dr. Laurent."

"She's not here."

"Must you always be so hostile?"

"To you?" Isabella scoffed. "Absolutely necessary."

Felix moved toward the door. "Let me in. I need to speak with Vivian."

Isabella blocked his path. "Who said you could call her that? Don't get ahead of yourself."

Her eyes burned with anger. "Ethan Roscente sent you, didn't he? You're all cut from the same rotten cloth."

Felix's expression darkened.

"Tell Ethan this," Isabella bit out each word, "Vivian doesn't want to see him. If he keeps harassing her, I'll make sure that scheming mistress and her brat regret it."

Felix swallowed hard.

Clearly, Vivian's friend was furious.

"This is between husband and wife," he said carefully. "Stay out of it."

Isabella rolled up her sleeves. "Stay out of it? Ethan cheated for three years and never came home. He's the one who filed for divorce. Now that Vivian's thriving, he wants her back? Dream on!"

"It's more complicated than—"

"Get out!" Isabella pointed to the front gate. "The sight of you makes me sick."

Felix muttered under his breath. "No wonder you're single with that temper."

"What did you say?" Her voice turned dangerous.

"I said women like you love making scenes," Felix took a step back. "Sophia Sherwood would never act like this."

Isabella's lips curled. "Your precious first love?"

"She's refined—"

"Refined enough to string you along for years?" Isabella cut in. "Even a lapdog has more self-respect."

Felix flushed crimson. "Watch your mouth!"

"Don't like the truth?" Isabella yanked the door open. "The exit's right there. Don't let it hit you on the way out."
###Chapter 478

Felix pointed at her sharply. "You..."

He took a deep breath, forcing down his anger. "I'm not here for you."

"Vivian isn't home. Looking for anyone else is pointless."

Felix narrowed his eyes. "She's definitely here."

He stormed into the mansion, searching every corner.

The empty house showed no signs of life.

"Convinced now? Should we tear up the floorboards too?"

Felix's expression darkened. "Where is she?"

"None of your business. Get lost."

After a tense stare-down with Isabella's cold face, Felix finally turned to leave.

For two consecutive days, he kept watch.

The mansion remained silent as a ghost town.

Even Isabella had vanished.

Ethan's voice sharpened when he received the call. "Gone?"

"The entire place is deserted."

"Keep searching." Ethan's tone turned icy. "I'm returning immediately."

Felix had barely hung up when his phone rang again.

"Sophia Sherwood" flashed on the screen.

"Goddess?" His voice instantly brightened.

"Care for coffee?"

"Absolutely!"

At the café, Sophia sat in a white dress, her cascading curls framing her face.

Her red lips curved. "Long time no see."

"How's the adjustment at Roscente Group?"

"Smooth." She stirred her coffee. "Though Ethan still hasn't returned..."

She met Felix's gaze directly. "Are those online rumors true?"

Felix's smile faltered.

"Ask him yourself when he's back."

"When will that be?"

"Uncertain."

Sophia lowered her lashes, masking the calculation in her eyes.

Sophia Evans was already finished.

Vivian and Ethan had completely fallen out.

Now was her perfect opportunity.

If she appeared during Ethan's lowest moment...

She lifted her coffee cup, hiding her smirk.
###Chapter 479

Ethan Roscente tossed and turned in the Kingdom of Eudora.

Each second without Vivian Laurent felt like a dull knife carving into his flesh.

He threw off the covers and dialed his assistant. "Prepare the jet. I'm returning to the States."

After hanging up, he walked to the children's room. Little Theo was gazing at the stars by the window.

"Theo, how would you like to go back to the States with Uncle Ethan?"

Theo's eyes lit up. "Really? Will Mommy come too?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "Mommy needs to stay here to handle some business."

He had already made up his mind. Sophia Evans was a ticking time bomb—she had to remain in Eudora.

"But..." Theo twisted his fingers nervously.

Ethan crouched down. "I promise to buy you the newest Lego set."

Theo exhaled in quiet relief. Finally, no more pinching from Mommy.

Three hours later, the private jet soared into the sky.

By the time Sophia stormed into the airport, only fading contrails remained on the runway.

"Ethan Roscente!" She kicked over a trash can in a fit of rage.

A bodyguard blocked her path with a blank expression. "Ms. Evans, you need to leave."

Inside the cabin, Theo played with a model airplane given by the flight attendant.

"Uncle Ethan, what should I say when we see Aunt Vivian?"

Ethan stared at the sea of clouds outside the window. "Tell her... Uncle Ethan knows he was wrong."

The jet touched down at the international airport at dusk.

Ethan first settled Theo at the Roscente Family Estate.

"Wait here for me."

He drove straight to Vivian's apartment, only to find a thin layer of dust on the doorknob.

The hospital schedule showed: Dr. Laurent—two-week leave.

A construction site guard scratched his head. "The project manager? She hasn't been here since last week."

As night deepened, Ethan stood at a crossroads, gripping the steering wheel.

His phone buzzed. A voice message from Theo: "Uncle Ethan, I found Aunt Vivian's photo in the closet!"

On the back of the photo was a handwritten note: South Mountain Sanatorium, Room 603.
###Chapter 480

Vivian Laurent had vanished.

She was currently overseas on a covert mission.

Like an unstoppable killing machine, she completed assignment after assignment.

Finn Deross was utterly exhausted, yet Vivian remained full of energy.

Working alongside Vivian made Finn realize how much he still needed to learn.

"Uncle Dominic, my mentor isn't human!" Finn exclaimed during his phone call with Dominic Atlante. "She's a walking death machine. I've never met a woman this lethal."

Surprisingly, Dominic didn't interrupt him.

"She's taught me so much. My skills have improved dramatically," Finn continued excitedly.

"How are things between Vivian and Ethan Roscente?" Dominic suddenly asked.

The scandal involving Ethan's son had caused quite a stir. Dominic was curious about Vivian's reaction.

"No idea," Finn scoffed. "But the way she's been overworking herself lately? Definitely because of that bastard. I don't even want to talk to Ethan anymore!"

A faint smile played on Dominic's lips. "Seems my opportunity has arrived."

"What opportunity?" Finn sounded confused.

"Where are you now?" Dominic cut straight to the point.

After getting their location, Dominic immediately ended the call.

He'd long admired Vivian's capabilities. Recruiting her to Integrity Group would make surpassing Roscente Group effortless.

Vivian completed her final mission and prepared to return home.

Patients were waiting for her at the hospital.

The day before her departure, she ran into Dominic in the hotel lobby.

"Mr. Atlante?" Vivian raised an eyebrow.

"What a coincidence," Dominic smiled.

Vivian smirked. "You came looking for me, didn't you?"

"I did get your location from my nephew," Dominic admitted openly.

"Is there something you need?"

"Do I need a reason to visit?"

"You expect me to believe that?" Vivian countered.

Dominic's smile widened. "I do enjoy speaking with intelligent people. Actually, I just wanted to invite you to dinner."

"You flew overseas just for that?"

"Naturally."

Vivian inwardly scoffed but kept her expression neutral. "I'm flattered."

"The honor is mine," Dominic replied with gentlemanly charm.

Seeing no way to refuse, Vivian reluctantly agreed.

"Shouldn't we invite Finn along?" she asked.

"He's already gone ahead to order," Dominic answered.

At the restaurant, Finn waved enthusiastically. "Mentor! Uncle! Perfect timing! The food just arrived. Let me snap a photo for my feed."

He raised his phone, capturing not only the lavish spread but also a sneaky shot of Vivian and Dominic together.
###Chapter 481

Finn tapped his phone screen lightly. The social media post went live instantly.

"Happy travels! Returning home tomorrow!"

The photo showed three figures standing together against a sunset backdrop.

Ethan's phone lit up with a notification—Finn had just updated his feed.

His fingers tightened around the device, knuckles turning white.

"One happy family?" He stared at Vivian standing beside Dominic in the photo, his chest constricting.

So this was where Vivian had been for the past two weeks—abroad with Dominic?

Didn't she know what kind of man Dominic was?

Her relaxed smile in the picture suggested she'd enjoyed the trip thoroughly.

Ethan's gaze burned into the image as if trying to see through the screen.

If they were returning tomorrow, the airport would be the perfect meeting place.

He immediately dialed his assistant. "Pull all flight manifests arriving from the States tomorrow."

...

The restaurant's crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow.

Vivian set down her fork and met Dominic's gaze across the table. "This dinner invitation wasn't just to thank me, was it?"

Dominic swirled his wine glass. "Dr. Laurent, your medical skills are exceptional. I'd like you to join my private medical team."

"I'm afraid I must decline." Vivian maintained her polite smile. "I prefer being an ordinary doctor."

"Ordinary doctors don't cure my nephew's chronic condition." Dominic leaned forward. "Name your price."

Finn kept his head down, barely breathing between bites.

"Finn is young and inexperienced." Vivian's tone remained steady. "There are far more skilled physicians than me."

"But you're the only one I trust." Dominic's voice dropped. "Any conditions—just say the word."

Vivian clinked her glass against his. "I'm not looking for career changes."

She took a measured sip. "Surely you won't hold this against me?"

Dominic chuckled darkly. "Of course not. I'm a law-abiding citizen."

Vivian suppressed a scoff. This man who straddled the line between legal and criminal had no right to that description.

...

Dawn broke as their flight took off on schedule.

Vivian gazed out the window at the clouds streaming beneath them.

Dominic sat across the aisle, his penetrating glances frequent during the five-hour journey.

When they retrieved luggage, he suddenly approached. "Let me help."

"No need." She sidestepped.

"Don't be distant." His voice softened. "You're Finn's mentor."

Vivian wheeled her suitcase briskly toward the exit.

Just before reaching the corridor, an arm snaked around her shoulders.

"Watch your step." Dominic's whisper brushed her ear.
###Chapter 482

"Careful of what?" Vivian Laurent glanced around the empty corridor where only she and Dominic Atlante stood.

Dominic's lips curved slightly. "Nothing."

Just as Vivian was about to press further, she looked up and met a pair of burning eyes at the arrivals area.

Ethan Roscente stood a short distance away, his gaze bloodshot and locked onto them.

"Vivian." His voice was hoarse.

Her breath hitched.

Ethan strode forward and seized her wrist. "We need to talk."

Dominic chuckled. "Can't it be said here, Mr. Roscente?"

Their eyes clashed like crossed blades, sparks flying.

"This is between Vivian and me. None of your concern."

"Just curious—does your wife know you're harassing Vivian at the airport?" Dominic deliberately mentioned Ethan's family, hoping to reveal his true colors.

He calculated that recruiting Vivian, a business prodigy, could propel Integrity Group past Roscente Group.

What he didn't know was that Roscente's success rested solely on Ethan's strategic brilliance.

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "I have no wife. This is a private matter. Stay out of it."

He slapped Dominic's hand off Vivian's shoulder. "Manhandling a woman? How crude."

Turning to Vivian, his voice softened. "Viv, I've searched everywhere for you. Five minutes. Please."

He'd waited at the airport for three days, only for Dominic to interfere.

"No." Vivian's tone was glacial. "Move."

Dominic seized the moment. "Persistent pursuit isn't exactly gentlemanly, Mr. Roscente."

He made to guide Vivian away.

Ethan gripped Dominic's wrist. "Care to chat?"

"With pleasure." Dominic didn't flinch.

Vivian massaged her temples as tension crackled between the two men.

Ethan clearly misunderstood her relationship with Dominic, who kept needling him.

Exhausted, she subtly signaled Finn Deross to keep watch.

Inside the airport café, two formidable men sat facing each other, drawing stares from passersby.
###Chapter 483 Don't Block My Dating Game

Ethan Roscente and Dominic Atlante faced off in the café.

Ethan wore a perfectly tailored suit, his every movement exuding authority. His hawk-like gaze seemed capable of piercing through souls.

Dominic lounged against his chairback, shirt collar slightly open. A roguish smile played on his lips, but his eyes held sharp edges.

"Dominic." Ethan's voice was low. "Stay away from Vivian."

Dominic chuckled. "Ethan, such a busybody."

"I'll always look out for her."

"Even after signing the divorce papers?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "Our affairs are none of your concern."

"Pity." Dominic stirred his coffee leisurely. "Vivian seems to disagree."

Ethan stood abruptly. "Don't even think about pursuing her."

Dominic arched an eyebrow. "Is that a threat?"

"A warning."

Ethan turned and left, his posture rigid as a pine.

Finn Deross emerged from a corner. "Uncle, is Ethan serious?"

Dominic narrowed his eyes. "Emotional men are easiest to handle."

"What about Vivian—"

"Remember. Everyone has a pressure point."

...

Vivian Laurent dragged her suitcase home.

Isabella Langley peeked from the kitchen, apron tied around her waist. "Welcome back, darling!"

The dining table overflowed with steaming dishes.

"I made your favorite sweet-and-sour ribs!" Isabella gestured excitedly. "We just made a billion!"

Vivian collapsed onto the sofa. "Exhausted."

"Should I call some male models for massages?"

"Spare me."

Isabella kneaded her shoulders. "Eat first, then a bath."

"You're the best." Vivian pinched her cheek playfully. "Let's get married."

"No way!" Isabella waved dramatically. "I still need to date younger men!"

"Please. You talk big but never actually date."

"Those men aren't worthy!" Isabella rolled her eyes. "Especially that Felix Valdemar. Sneaky bastard. So annoying."

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "He came again?"

"Yep. Like a damn stalker." Isabella scoffed. "All men are trash."
###Chapter 484

"Felix Valdemar? Haven't heard from him in ages."

"That guy? Probably still simping over his crush. His goddess only has eyes for Ethan Roscente..."

Isabella Langley suddenly fell silent.

She bit her lip in frustration.

"Let's not talk about this. Let's eat!"

She pulled Vivian Laurent to the dining table. Midway through the meal, Isabella abruptly set down her chopsticks.

"Viv, something terrible happened!"

"Hmm?"

"The assassination contract for the King of Eudora failed." Isabella lowered her voice. "The King was prepared. DarkKingdom operatives almost got captured. Now they owe ten times the penalty fee."

"Five billion turned into fifty billion?"

"Exactly. If they can't pay, the Dark Web will expose the contractor's identity and send assassins after them."

Vivian's fingers twitched.

Fifty billion. An astronomical sum.

The organization was notoriously stingy. After years of life-threatening missions, Zero probably didn't even have ten billion saved.

"Why would he take such a job?"

"Probably assigned by the organization." Isabella's gaze shifted. "Just like what they did to you back then..."

Vivian's pupils constricted.

That mission three years ago remained vivid in her memory. The leaked intel had nearly cost her life.

Now it was Zero's turn.

"How much do I have left in my accounts?"

"You can't possibly be thinking..." Isabella gasped.
###Chapter 485

Vivian remained silent.

Isabella stamped her foot in frustration. "Viv, don't be ridiculous! Four years have passed. Who knows what kind of person he's become now?"

"Besides, he's earned the organization so much money. If even they won't help him, why should you care? Five billion isn't pocket change. You've barely made one billion after working yourself to exhaustion these past few days."

"We're not poor, but we're not billionaires either. The Triple Six Realty project lost so much money with all that capital tied up. The few billion you've earned recently is nothing compared to five billion!"

Vivian spoke softly, "Let's prepare the funds. If Zero needs it, give him everything."

Money could always be earned again.

But a life lost was gone forever.

She wanted Zero to survive, to escape that predatory organization.

She couldn't produce five billion immediately, but she wanted to do what she could.

"You're too generous," Isabella sighed. "I'd be overjoyed to have a friend like you."

Vivian said seriously, "The same goes for you. If you ever need money, I'd liquidate everything to help you."

"Don't jinx it!" Isabella waved her hands frantically. "I'd rather never need that kind of help."

The food smelled delicious, but Vivian barely tasted it.

After dinner, she logged into the Dark Web using Finn's account.

There it was - the message: Mission failed. Penalty fee due within three days.

Four years without contact.

Zero probably thought she was dead.

With something this serious, he should have a solution.

Vivian silently prayed: Please let him be safe.

...

DarkKingdom headquarters remained as gloomy as ever.

Zero's room was pitch black.

"Master!" Annika burst in.

A cold voice came from the darkness. "Get out."

"Master, I came as soon as I finished my mission. I have some money here. It's not much, but..." Annika held out a bank card.

"Not needed."

"Master! The organization can't abandon you! You've earned them over five billion these years! I'll go to the Director—"

"Get out!" Zero's voice suddenly sharpened.

Annika thought her master was just in a bad mood.

She didn't know Zero was waiting for someone.

The bait had been set.

Shadow must have seen it by now.

Her continued silence meant she didn't care?

No matter.

The trap was ready.

Knowing Shadow as he did, she would definitely take the bait.
###Chapter 486

Zero's unusual behavior alarmed the highest echelons of DarkKingdom.

The Director personally sought him out, his expression grave. "Explain yourself."

Leaning against the window, Zero spun a coin between his fingers. "I needed money."

"Preposterous!" The Director slammed his palm on the desk. "Five billion means nothing to you. Assassinating a king would've been child's play for someone of your skills."

The coin flashed silver in the air before Zero caught it effortlessly. "I failed."

"The Dark Web has already sent envoys." The Director's brow furrowed. "Do you expect me to hand you over?"

For the first time in his twenty-year reign over DarkKingdom, the Director felt powerless. Though nominally his subordinate, Zero was an untouchable legend within the organization.

"Hand me over." Zero's voice was eerily calm.

The Director's pupils constricted. "Have you lost your mind? Neither the Dark Web nor the Eudoran royal family will let you live."

"It's my burden to bear." Zero met his gaze. "My apologies for implicating the organization."

After a long silence, the Director spoke. "Fifty billion. The organization can lend it to you."

"No need."

The Director sensed something amiss. Was this Zero's way of cutting ties? Yet this young man was the most suitable successor.

Hours later, Zero's phone vibrated.

His account now held an additional five billion.

No note accompanied the transfer.

But he knew exactly who sent it.

The money arrived just in time.

Yet what Zero desired went far beyond this.

......

Vivian Laurent stared at the successful transfer notification, her fingers trembling.

This was all the liquid capital she could mobilize.

With her project's funding stretched thin, she'd nearly drained every available resource.

"Is it worth it?" Isabella Langley asked, concern lacing her voice.

"Money can be earned back." Vivian massaged her temples. "The project will yield returns soon."

"But five billion?"

Gazing out the window, Vivian murmured, "I only fear it won't be enough."

Isabella squeezed her hand. "At least you tried your best."

Late into the night, Vivian tossed restlessly.

Zero's predicament and Ethan Roscente's relentless pursuit weighed on her like twin mountains.

She yanked the blanket over her head.

Enough!

Tomorrow awaited another battle with that difficult client.
###Chapter 487

Morning sunlight streamed through the hospital corridor as Vivian Laurent walked briskly into the General Surgery Department office.

"Dr. Laurent!" Several nurses abandoned their medical charts and rushed toward her.

"Are you trying to eat me alive?" Vivian laughed, dodging their enthusiastic hugs.

The head nurse wiped her eyes. "You're finally back! Our outpatient numbers plummeted this month. Patients went to other hospitals."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "That's quite dramatic."

"It's true!" Resident Dr. Li chimed in. "Patients switched hospitals when they heard you were on leave."

Nathan Clementson peeked out from his office. "Stop scaring Dr. Laurent." He handed her a steaming coffee. "But several department heads have been asking for you."

Before Vivian could take a sip, Dr. Wang from Cardiac Surgery burst in.

"Dr. Laurent!" He grabbed her wrist urgently. "We have an aortic dissection case that could rupture any minute!"

Dr. Zachary Kalmien from Neurosurgery followed close behind. "Our brainstem hemorrhage patient is more critical!"

The two senior physicians argued loudly in the hallway, drawing stares from patients.

"Gentlemen." Vivian raised her hands in surrender. "I'll check the cardiac case first, then neurosurgery in thirty minutes."

She'd barely taken two steps with Dr. Wang when Dr. Li from Orthopedics intercepted them.

"Dr. Laurent, we have a young patient with femoral head necrosis..."

Nathan chuckled. "Looks like you'll be touring the entire hospital today."

General Surgery staff leaned against doorframes, shaking their heads at the spectacle of department heads competing for Vivian.

"Our golden ticket is back," a senior resident murmured.

The head nurse planted her hands on her hips. "Now we'll have endless patient queues again."
###Chapter 488

The operating room lights finally dimmed.

Vivian Laurent removed her surgical mask, her bangs soaked with sweat. She leaned against the wall as she exited, her legs heavy as lead.

The coronary artery bypass graft had lasted seven grueling hours.

Since stepping through the hospital doors at 8 AM, she'd been spinning like a top. Emergency department. ICU. Cardiac surgery. She'd practically circled the entire inpatient tower.

The clock now read 1:13 AM.

Her stomach growled in protest. Vivian realized she hadn't eaten in over eighteen hours.

Pushing open her office door, she froze.

Ethan Roscente sat in her swivel chair, flipping through a medical journal.

"Get out." Her voice came out hoarse.

Ethan closed the magazine and stood. "I brought you dinner."

Several thermal containers sat on the coffee table. The faint aroma of braised ribs made her stomach clench again.

"Not interested." She marched to her desk and began organizing patient charts.

Ethan suddenly knelt, popping open a container lid. Steam rose in a wispy plume under the fluorescent lights.

"At least have some soup." He ladled a portion into a bowl. "Your throat sounds raw."

Vivian stared at the offering and laughed. "What's this act about?"

"I'm just worried about you."

"Worried?" She slammed a chart onto the desk. "Then you should know you're the last person I want to see."

His hand froze mid-air.

Silence swallowed the office. Only the wall clock's ticking filled the void.

Vivian grabbed her lab coat and moved toward the door.

"Five minutes." Ethan's voice stopped her. "Just five."

"Three." She held up three fingers. "Or I call security."

His lips twisted wryly. "Still as stubborn as ever."

"Two."

"At least eat something—"

"One."

Ethan exhaled and headed for the exit. His hand paused on the doorknob. "I'll wait in the parking lot."

"Don't bother." She didn't look up. "I'm staying in the on-call room tonight."

The moment the door clicked shut, she collapsed into her chair. The rib soup still steamed, its rich scent permeating the space.

Vivian studied the bowl for a long moment before finally reaching for it.
###Chapter 489

The operating room lights finally dimmed.

Vivian Laurent removed her surgical mask and rubbed her temples wearily. She glanced at the wall clock—it was already half past one in the morning.

"Dr. Laurent, would you like to go home and rest?" a nurse whispered.

Vivian shook her head. "No need. I'll stay in the on-call room tonight."

She had three more surgeries scheduled for tomorrow morning. Going home now would waste precious time.

Her phone vibrated. A message from Ethan Roscente lit up the screen:

"I'm downstairs at the hospital. Brought you some late-night snacks."

Her fingers hovered over the screen for several seconds before she finally replied: "No thanks. I already ate."

His response came quickly: "Then I'll just bring them up and leave."

Vivian took a deep breath and dialed his number directly.

"Ethan, I've made myself clear." Her voice was ice-cold. "Stop coming to see me."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"I just worry about you—"

"Don't." She cut him off. "Don't come tomorrow either. I won't see you."

Ending the call, she leaned against the wall. Her chest rose and fell rapidly as she squeezed her eyes shut.

She couldn't afford to soften.

That child was like a thorn forever lodged between her and Ethan.

Ethan stood outside the hospital entrance, the night wind tousling his hair.

He stared at his phone screen for a long moment before finally exhaling in resignation.

When he returned to the villa, the living room lights were still on.

A small figure curled up on the sofa immediately sprang up at the sound of the door opening.

"Uncle Ethan!"

He strode over. "Theo, why aren't you asleep?"

The little boy rubbed his eyes. "I was waiting for you."

Ethan ruffled his hair. "Don't wait up for me. I'm often busy with work."

"Were you seeing Aunt Vivian?" Theo looked up with wide eyes. "Does she...not like me?"

Ethan froze.

"Of course not. She's just...very busy lately."

Theo lowered his head. "I know the truth. Mom used to say Aunt Vivian hated us."

Kneeling to meet the boy's gaze, Ethan said firmly, "Listen—adult relationships are complicated. But Aunt Vivian is a good person. She could never hate you."

"Then what's her name?"

"Vivian Laurent." Ethan's voice softened. "She's an incredible doctor."

Theo blinked. "Uncle Ethan, I'm sorry. It's all because of me—"

"Don't say that." Ethan scooped him up. "Come on, let's get you to bed."

Their elongated shadows stretched down the hallway under the dim lights. Ethan glanced back at the window where the night stretched endlessly beyond.

He knew Vivian was somewhere under that same vast sky—watching, remembering, hurting.
###Chapter 490

"It's time to rest. It's late." Ethan Roscente glanced at his watch.

Theo nodded obediently. "Goodnight, Dad."

The next morning, Ethan arrived at the office precisely on time. A mountain of documents demanded his immediate attention.

Sophia Sherwood, having learned of Ethan's schedule, woke up early. She stood by the elevator, nervously twisting a strand of hair around her finger.

Simon Eisner was already stationed outside the office. Sophia gritted her teeth. The man was an impenetrable wall—no tactic had ever worked on him.

The elevator chimed.

"Mr. Roscente!" Sophia instantly brightened with a practiced smile.

Ethan frowned. "What is it?"

"Something important." She seized the opportunity to follow him.

Simon moved to intercept, but Ethan waved him off.

Inside the office, Sophia offered eagerly, "You look exhausted. I'm trained in professional massage techniques—"

"Get to the point." Ethan cut her off.

She pulled a stack of files from her bag. "The marketing department has been struggling. The current director isn't capable."

She stepped closer. "I could do better."

Ethan's gaze flicked over the documents before settling on her face. "That's all?"

"I can bring greater value to the company." She straightened her posture. "Just give me the chance."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting sharp shadows across Ethan's stern profile.
###Chapter 491

Ethan Roscente stared coldly at Sophia Sherwood.

"You want the director position?"

Sophia twisted her fingers nervously. "I just think I'm better suited for this role."

"The company has standard promotion protocols." Ethan's voice was icy. "Sabotaging your superior to climb the ladder is amateurish."

Even if her boss had issues, proper reporting channels existed. Sophia coming directly to him revealed her true intentions.

"I have five years of management experience abroad." Sophia rushed to explain. "My recent projects have been outstanding. Everyone in the office can attest to that."

Ethan raised his hand to silence her. "Enough."

"We have thousands of employees. Should I personally promote each one?" His gaze sharpened. "True competence doesn't require such tactics. You've disappointed me, Sophia."

Her face paled instantly. She couldn't believe Ethan would judge her this way.

"Ethan, you misunderstand—"

"Get out." His dismissal was final.

"Let me explain—"

"I said get out!" Ethan's voice rose abruptly.

Sophia bit her lip as she left, eyes burning with resentment. The more Ethan resisted, the more determined she became to prove herself worthy of him.

Silence reclaimed the office. Ethan massaged his temples as exhaustion washed over him.

Simon Eisner entered with an armful of files. "Mr. Roscente, these require your signature."

The towering paperwork seemed suffocating.

"You look unwell. Should I call a doctor?"

At the mention of doctors, Vivian Laurent's image flashed in Ethan's mind. He waved dismissively. "Unnecessary."

Just insomnia.

"Dominic Atlante is in Country C. Keep close surveillance." Ethan ordered grimly. "Report any suspicious activity immediately."

"Understood."

That underworld figure approaching Vivian couldn't mean anything good. Though she was vigilant, Ethan still worried.

Even with their strained relationship, her safety remained his priority.

Simon continued briefing his schedule. Back-to-back meetings. Endless queues of business partners. Ethan gestured for him to streamline arrangements.

"Noted." Ethan tapped the desk absently.

As he buried himself in documents, his phone rang. Theo Evans' cheerful voice came through.

"Uncle Ethan! Can we go to the amusement park? I promise I'll behave!"

A smile tugged at Ethan's lips unconsciously. Listening to the boy's excitement, a sudden thought struck him—what would it be like to have a child of his own?
###Chapter 492

"You can go, but you must be accompanied." Ethan Roscente's voice carried undisputed authority through the phone.

Theo nodded obediently. "Got it!"

As soon as the call ended, Ethan immediately dialed the private line to the Roscente Family Estate's head butler.

Since taking custody of Theo, he had moved back from Vivian Laurent's old apartment to the ancestral mansion. Its advanced security system and professional staff were better suited for childcare.

"Assign four bodyguards to follow Theo," he ordered sternly. "Maintain constant contact. Notify me immediately of any irregularities."

Only after giving these instructions did Ethan return to work.

Less than thirty minutes later, the butler called again.

"What happened?" Ethan's chest tightened.

"Sir, young master Theo... he went to..."

"Speak clearly!"

"Capital General Hospital! He said he wanted to secretly visit Mrs. Laurent!"

Ethan pinched the bridge of his nose.

He hadn't anticipated Theo would take initiative to find Vivian. With critical project deadlines looming, he couldn't leave work.

"Double the security detail," he conceded. "If Dr. Laurent shows any displeasure, remove Theo immediately."

......

Vivian hurried down the hospital corridor.

She had rotated through three departments without a water break. Just as her lunch break began, Pediatrics summoned her urgently.

"Dr. Laurent!" A nurse intercepted her. "An autistic patient is experiencing sudden abdominal pain but refuses to communicate..."

"I'm on my way."

Vivian turned toward Pediatrics but collided with a small figure at the corner.

"Oof!"

A boy wearing a cartoon-patterned mask fell backward, still clutching a bubble tea. His round eyes blinked up at her.

Vivian immediately knelt. "I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I didn't see you. Are you hurt?"

Theo recognized his long-admired aunt instantly.

"Young master!" Three black-suited bodyguards arrived breathlessly.

Vivian stood. "I'm a pediatrician heading that way. If you're concerned, we can examine him together."

"Okay!" Theo chirped.

He studied Vivian shyly before offering his drink. "Here, this is for you!"

Close call—he'd almost called her "Auntie" aloud.

Theo mentally cheered. First, he'd befriend Vivian. Only after gaining her trust would he reveal his identity. An early confession might scare her away.
###Chapter 493

"Theo, you should drink it." Little Theo stood on tiptoe, holding up a cup of bubble tea with his tiny hands.

Vivian Laurent crouched down and ruffled his soft hair. "I'm an adult. I can't take snacks from children."

Theo shook his head stubbornly. "I bought this just for you!"

Accepting the warm drink, Vivian felt a surge of warmth in her chest. "Thank you, little gentleman."

She examined his scraped knee carefully. "Does it hurt?"

Theo puffed out his chest. "I'm tough!"

Vivian chuckled. "What brings such a brave boy to the hospital today?"

"I came to play with you!" His big eyes sparkled.

She took a sip of the tea—perfectly sweet. Only then did she remember she hadn't eaten lunch.

"Let's go to the pediatric ward, okay?" She took his chubby little hand.

Theo skipped beside her. "You can call me Theo!"

"Because you're the little treasure at home?" She pinched his cheek playfully.

In the pediatric ward, a boy sat motionless on his bed. Vivian knelt to meet his gaze, but he remained unresponsive.

"Autism spectrum," his mother explained, eyes red-rimmed.

Vivian tried various methods, but the boy stayed silent.

"Sis!"

Theo's bright voice broke the tension. He peeked through the doorway, curious.

An idea struck Vivian. "Theo, will you help me with something?"

"Okay!" he answered enthusiastically.

She whispered instructions in his ear. Theo nodded solemnly, as if accepting a critical mission.

Medical staff stepped outside. Theo toddled to the bed and held out his treasured candy.

"Here, big brother. It's super yummy!"

The boy's eyes lifted slowly. Theo chattered about kindergarten adventures, gesturing animatedly.

Miraculously, the boy reached for the candy.

Outside the door, Vivian pressed a hand to her mouth. The two boys leaned closer together, their innocent laughter filling the room.
###Chapter 494

The hospital corridor lights glared harshly.

Vivian Laurent leaned against the wall, absently tapping her fingers on the medical chart. Moments later, the examination room door opened.

Theo Evans shuffled out with his head down.

"Big brother said it hurts here." Theo pointed to his chest. "Because people called him stupid and threw stones at him."

Vivian's brows knitted together instantly.

"They said he was a stray dog. Worse than a mutt." Theo's voice grew smaller. Tears splattered onto the floor tiles. "They used to say that to me too..."

Vivian immediately crouched down and pulled the trembling boy into her arms. The faint scent of milk clung to him.

"Those people are vile." She rubbed soothing circles on his back. "Our Theo is the kindest boy."

Theo buried his face in her shoulder. "Auntie..."

Vivian froze.

"I mean Dr. Vivian is as nice as Auntie!" Theo corrected hastily, ears turning scarlet.

Pretending not to hear, she took his hand. "Come see big brother with me?"

Inside the exam room, a teenage boy huddled in the corner, watching them warily. Theo approached and murmured something. The boy's guarded expression gradually softened.

By the time Vivian finished, her scrubs clung to her damp back. She checked her watch—lunch break long gone.

"Hungry?" She patted her growling stomach. "My treat for cupcakes?"

Theo's eyes lit up before he shook his head fiercely. "I already ate!" His lips pressed tight beneath the mask.

A nurse rushed over. "Dr. Laurent, Bed 3 is crashing!"

Vivian sighed and took a long sip of the milk tea Theo handed her. Sugar flooded her veins, pushing back exhaustion.

"Go save people, Doctor." Theo waved obediently. "See you next time!"

Watching the boy skip away, Vivian smiled unconsciously. She didn't see Theo glance back from the corner, eyes shining with hope.
###Chapter 495

Theo couldn't stop smiling all day after meeting Vivian.

As night fell, Ethan had just stepped through the front door when Theo came bouncing toward him.

"Uncle Ethan!" Theo's eyes sparkled. "I met Aunt Vivian today! She's so pretty and kind."

Ethan crouched down and ruffled the boy's soft hair.

Theo looked up expectantly. "Can I visit Aunt Vivian again tomorrow? She seemed to like me too."

"Of course." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Aunt Vivian will adore you."

Watching Theo's excitement warmed Ethan's heart.

But he knew Vivian had been working nonstop lately and decided to wait a few more days before disturbing her.

At the hospital, Vivian had been on duty for three straight days.

Even Dominic hadn't managed to see her.

Which suited Ethan just fine.

Finally, Vivian packed up her desk to leave.

A tall figure blocked her path at the doorway.

"Dr. Laurent, off work?" Dominic leaned against the doorframe with an amused smirk.

Vivian frowned. "Mr. Atlante, please register at reception if you need medical attention."

"I'm not sick." He straightened up. "I came specifically to see you."

"Me?" She arched an eyebrow. "What's so interesting about me?"

Dominic's gaze burned. "A beautiful woman like you is always worth looking at."

"Spare me the flattery." Her voice turned frosty. "State your business."

"I'm being sincere." He feigned hurt. "Just wanted to be friends."

Vivian had no patience for this. "I'm going home."

"Let me drive you." Dominic followed. "Finn keeps asking about you."

"No need." She stopped abruptly. "Don't you have a criminal empire to run, Mr. Atlante?"

He chuckled. "Work can wait when Dr. Laurent's involved."

Rolling her eyes, Vivian just wanted to sleep.

Noticing her exhaustion, Dominic wisely backed off.

They arrived at the Laurent residence together, where Vivian immediately went upstairs to rest.

Finn stared at them in surprise. "Uncle Dom, why are you with Master?"

"Adult matters aren't for children." Dominic said dismissively.

Finn bristled. "I'm nineteen!"

"Still a kid in my eyes." Dominic gave him a look. "Got a problem with that?"

Finn immediately shrank back. "N-no... When are you returning to the company?"

"No rush."

"What about the business?"

"If it collapses, I could use the vacation."
###Chapter 496

Vivian Laurent woke up naturally.

She stretched lazily and opened the curtains. Sunlight flooded the bedroom.

When she came downstairs after washing up, Dominic Atlante was arranging cutlery at the dining table.

"Mr. Atlante, you're like a bad penny that keeps turning up." Vivian arched an eyebrow.

Dominic didn't look up. "People wait in line just to see me. Yet here you are complaining."

Steaming breakfast dishes covered the table.

Having skipped proper meals for days, Vivian immediately sat down at the tempting aroma.

Today was her day off, perfect for relaxing at home.

The doorbell rang.

Isabella Langley barged in excitedly. Her eyes lit up when she spotted Dominic.

"New boyfriend?" she whispered. "Way hotter than Ethan Roscente."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Finn's uncle."

"What? You mean—"

"Rainier Valence." Vivian cut her off.

Isabella suppressed a laugh at the ridiculous alias.

She stole glances at the infamous crime lord.

Dressed in a tailored suit with gold-rimmed glasses, he looked every inch the business elite.

"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Atlante." Isabella feigned politeness.

Dominic gave a slight nod.

Isabella dragged Vivian into a corner. "Why is he here?"

"Who knows? Maybe he's bored." Vivian shrugged. "What do you want?"

"Upstairs. Now."

As they headed for the staircase, Isabella glanced back.

Dominic's gaze was glued to Vivian's retreating figure.

The moment the study door closed, Isabella blurted out, "The way he looks at you—"

"Like he wants me dead?" Vivian smirked. "I intercepted his three-million shipment last week."

"But he's gorgeous. Beats Ethan hands down." Isabella winked. "Imagine being a mafia queen."

Vivian hurled a cushion at her. "You marry him then."

"No thanks! I value my life." Isabella dodged. "Serious trouble's brewing."
###Chapter 497

Vivian's heart clenched.

When Isabella said something big happened, it was never trivial.

"Zero was captured."

"What?" Vivian's pupils constricted violently.

Zero captured? Impossible!

"His mission to assassinate the king failed. He couldn't pay the Dark Web penalty fee either, so they detained him. Fifty billion is no small amount, but how could someone like Zero get caught so easily? You know the consequences of defaulting."

Those torture methods could make death seem merciful. They could break even the strongest operatives.

"When did this happen? Where is he being held?"

Vivian knew the price of contract breaches all too well. What had happened to Zero?

"He was taken last night. Location unknown." Isabella's expression darkened.

She hesitated. "Fifty billion isn't money we can scrape together overnight. Viv, this isn't your problem. Maybe we should pretend we don't know?"

Vivian could never turn away. Zero had helped her too many times. She wouldn't abandon him now.

Moreover, she grew increasingly certain this was the organization's doing.

"No. Isabella, help me locate him."

Isabella saw right through her. "Are you insane? It's too dangerous!"

"I know the risks. But I have to save him. I owe him."

Isabella sighed. "Fine. If you've made up your mind, I'll back you. I'll start digging. Wait for my update."

"Thank you."

"Since when do we stand on ceremony? But promise me I'll always come first in your heart!"

Vivian chuckled. "Of course. No one compares to you."

"That's more like it. If I ever get in trouble, you'd better come rescue me!"

"Don't jinx it! Nothing will happen to you. I'd rather take the hit myself."

"Love you!" Isabella pulled Vivian into a tight hug.

Having such loyal friends made any risk worth taking.

"That Dominic downstairs... Is he planning to squat at your place indefinitely?" Isabella suddenly asked.

"He doesn't live here. No idea why he showed up today, but it's definitely no good."

"He's bad news. Don't get charmed by him. And absolutely no falling in love!"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Do you really think I'm that easy?"

"Just looking out for you. Though Dominic is ridiculously handsome... By the way, does Ethan know about this?"
###Chapter 498

"What's wrong?" Vivian Laurent looked up as Isabella Langley suddenly leaned in closer.

Isabella lowered her voice conspiratorially. "I heard Dominic Atlante is pursuing you?"

Vivian's pen clattered onto the desk.

"Who started that rumor?" She shot up from her chair, the legs scraping loudly against the floor.

Isabella blinked. "It's all over the hospital."

"Complete nonsense!" Vivian's cheeks burned with anger. "We're not even friends. He just wants to use me to get close to Zero."

Isabella nodded thoughtfully. "What about Ethan Roscente? He's been back for so long without any explanation."

Vivian gave a cold laugh. "He came."

"And?"

"I kicked him out." Vivian sat back down. "I didn't want to hear a single one of his excuses."

Isabella patted her shoulder. "Good for you! Next time I see him, I'll punch him for you."

Vivian forced a weak smile.

Her gaze dropped to her phone. Zero's chat window remained silent.

Please be safe...

...

As Isabella left the office, she nearly collided with Dominic Atlante lounging in the hallway.

She deliberately slowed her pace, giving the notorious man a once-over.

"Hey," she suddenly turned. "Single?"

Dominic raised an eyebrow. "Looking to set me up?"

"What's your type?" Isabella got straight to the point.

"Smart and beautiful." Dominic smirked. "Stupidity affects my work efficiency."

Isabella scoffed. "Are all men this shallow?"

"Aren't women the same?" Dominic shot back. "Can't take your eyes off a handsome face."

Isabella was speechless.

She had to admit the junior nurses secretly reapplied makeup whenever Dominic appeared.

"Fine." She waved a hand. "I'll introduce someone suitable."

As she walked away, Isabella muttered under her breath: That man was clearly referring to Vivian.

...

Vivian eventually returned to the hospital.

"Junior?" Nathan Clementson looked surprised. "Isn't this your day off?"

"Couldn't stand being at home." Vivian quickly put on her lab coat. "Was there a child looking for me earlier?"

Nathan nodded. "About three or four years old. Nearly cried when you weren't here."

Vivian's heart clenched.

Theo!

She rushed out of the department, but the small figure was nowhere to be seen in the hallway.

Standing at the hospital entrance, Vivian watched the endless stream of people.

The evening breeze brushed through her hair, carrying away her last shred of hope.
###Chapter 499

Vivian Laurent stood in the hospital corridor, sunlight streaming through the glass windows and casting a warm glow on her lab coat.

If that person truly wanted to see her, they would come again.

Just as she turned to leave, a familiar small figure caught her eye.

"Theo?" Vivian called out in surprise.

The little boy, wearing a cartoon-patterned mask, beamed at her with crescent-shaped eyes. "Auntie Doctor!" He quickly covered his mouth. "No, no—Doctor Vivian!"

She crouched down to his eye level. "I almost missed you, Theo."

"The nurse said you were off today," he said, tilting his head up. "I thought I wouldn't get to see you."

"Guess it's fate, then." She ruffled his hair. "Are you here for a check-up?"

"I came to play with you!" He waved a thermal lunch bag. "I even brought you food. But since you weren't here, I shared it with the other doctors."

Noticing the disappointment in his eyes, she smiled. "Next time, I'll definitely try your family's cooking."

Theo's eyes sparkled. He adored his aunt more than his own mother. She was gentle, and her smile was the prettiest thing in the world.

"Are you heading home now?" Vivian asked.

He bit his lip and shook his head. The house was always empty—just maids and bodyguards. His uncle was at work, and there was no one to play with.

"Can I stay with you? I promise I'll be good!" He held up three fingers solemnly.

She chuckled. "Alright. But I have work this afternoon, so you'll have to entertain yourself in my office."

"Deal!" Theo jumped in excitement.

In the office, Theo frowned at the thick medical textbook in his hands. Though he couldn't understand the jargon, he thought being a doctor must be amazing.

Just like Auntie Vivian.

When she entered the main office, Ryan Fairsprene was organizing patient files.

"Dr. Fairsprene," she greeted.

He stood immediately. "Dr. Laurent."

"Shouldn't you be resting more?" she asked, noting the dark circles under his eyes.

Adjusting his glasses, he replied, "I heard the patient load is heavy. I wanted to help."
###Chapter 500

"How is Fiona's recovery progressing?" Vivian rubbed her temples. Her packed surgery schedule had left her no time to check in.

Ryan adjusted his glasses. "The skin graft was successful. Though the stitches haven't been removed yet, the wound is healing better than expected."

Vivian exhaled in relief. "That's good. I'll make sure to visit when the stitches come out."

A flicker of hope crossed Ryan's eyes. No one wanted Fiona to fully recover and step back into the sunlight more than he did.

"Going on rounds, Dr. Laurent?" Ryan glanced at the medical chart in her hand.

"To the ICU." She straightened her lab coat collar. "There was a heart transplant yesterday. Need to check on the post-op condition."

Ryan quickened his pace. "I'm heading that way too. Let's go together."

They walked side by side toward the elevators.

......

In his top-floor office at Roscente Group, Ethan stared blankly at his computer screen.

His fingers tapped absently against the desk. Theo should have arrived at the hospital by now. Was letting the boy visit Vivian alone the right decision?

He grabbed his phone and sent a text. The screen remained dark.

"That little rascal..." Ethan frowned and called his security detail. Only after hearing their report did his shoulders relax slightly. At least the two were getting along.

Maybe... Vivian would like Theo? The boy was impossible not to adore.

The clock struck six. Ethan snatched his suit jacket. Time to pick him up—and maybe catch a glimpse of her from afar.

......

In Vivian's office, Theo was engrossed in a copy of Basic Anatomy.

"Pretty lady!" He held up the book as she entered. "What does this diagram mean?"

Vivian's eyebrows rose in surprise. A child his age understanding medical textbooks?

She knelt beside him, pointing at the illustration. "This is our stomach—like a balloon. It digests the food we eat."

Theo's eyes sparkled. "Can I borrow these books? I'll return them next week, promise!"

"Of course." She ruffled his hair, amused by his unexpected passion for medicine.

His smartwatch vibrated. Theo checked the caller ID and reluctantly closed the book. "Uncle's here to get me."

As Vivian helped pack his bag, she recalled the previous "Auntie" misunderstanding. If he already had an aunt, his uncle must be married, right?

......

Outside the hospital, Ethan leaned against his car, gaze fixed on the entrance.

"Uncle!" Theo came running, proudly presenting the stack of medical books. "Look!"

Ethan took them with one hand, using the other to tousle the boy's hair. "Did you have fun with Auntie today?"

"So much fun!" Theo bounced excitedly. "Auntie gave me these!"

Ethan opened the cover to find Vivian's elegant signature. His fingertips lightly traced the inscription.

"Uncle, I want to be a doctor when I grow up!" Theo tugged his sleeve. "An amazing doctor like Auntie!"

Ethan crouched to his eye level. "Medical school means endless studying and experiments. It's hard work."

"I'm not scared!" Theo puffed out his chest. "Auntie said doctors save lives. I want to save people too!"

As twilight fell, Ethan's lips curved into an unconscious smile while watching the hospital lights flicker on.
###Chapter 501

Theo Evans bounced excitedly into the car.

Ethan Roscente ruffled the boy's hair gently. "Wait here for Uncle Ethan, okay?"

Theo nodded obediently. "Hurry back, Uncle!"

Ethan strode into the hospital with long, confident steps, heading straight for the General Surgery Department.

From a distance, he spotted Vivian Laurent laughing with her colleagues.

Her crescent-shaped eyes sparkled when she smiled, revealing two adorable dimples.

Ethan didn't approach. Instead, he leaned against the wall, watching silently.

That intense gaze made Vivian's skin prickle.

She whirled around and immediately recognized the familiar silhouette.

Her heart skipped a beat.

Why was this persistent man here again?

She quickly turned away, pretending not to see him.

But his stare burned into her back like physical touch.

Vivian bit her lip in frustration.

She hurried into her office and slammed the door shut.

Inside, she stared at the wall clock, counting down the minutes.

The moment her shift ended, she gathered her belongings and prepared to leave.

When she opened the door, Ethan still stood in the same spot.

Hands in his pockets, his gaze locked onto her.

Vivian quickened her pace toward the exit.

The steady sound of footsteps followed behind her.

At the hospital entrance, she finally snapped.

"Ethan Roscente!"

The man's eyes lit up as he approached eagerly. "Vivian?"

From the car window, Theo watched the scene unfold with excitement.

Uncle Ethan and Aunt Vivian looked perfect together!

Vivian spoke coldly. "I warned you to stay away from me."

Ethan feigned innocence. "I'm just here to pick someone up."

"Who?"

"You."

Her chest heaved with anger.

This lying bastard!

"Don't let me see you at this hospital again."

His expression darkened. "I just wanted to see you—"

"Enough!" She cut him off sharply. "I don't believe a word you say."

With that, she turned and walked away.

Ethan remained rooted to the spot, watching her retreating figure.

Only when she disappeared from view did he return to the car.

Theo immediately asked, "Did Aunt Vivian forgive you, Uncle?"

Ethan gave a bitter smile. "Not even close."

"Don't worry!" Theo thumped his small chest confidently. "Leave it to me!"

Ethan tousled the boy's hair affectionately. "Then I'm counting on you."
###Chapter 502

Vivian's fingers tightened around the steering wheel.

The sudden ringtone shattered the silence inside the car.

"We've got a lead," Isabella's voice came through the speaker. "We've located where they're holding Liam."

"Coordinates?"

"A secret base near the R-country border." A pause. "It's bad. If we delay any longer—"

"Book the earliest flight," Vivian cut in.

"Shouldn't we strategize first?"

"No time." Her tone left no room for argument. "Just Lucas and I will go. We'll plan midair."

She glanced at the rearview mirror and made a sharp U-turn.

At the airport terminal, Lucas stood waiting, posture rigid.

"Vivian." His gaze burned with determination.

She studied him. "This is dangerous."

"You saved my life." His voice remained steady.

"Your life belongs to you alone." Her brows furrowed. "You always have a choice."

Lucas smiled. "I choose to go with you."

Onboard, Vivian spread out the maps.

"High-security compound." She tapped the satellite image. "We'll need reconnaissance first."

"I can infiltrate as a guard," Lucas suggested.

"Too risky." She shook her head. "We'll intercept an isolated patrol."

"What if they're suicide operatives?"

"Then we switch to identity infiltration." Her eyes turned flinty. "You'll be backup. I'm going in."

Lucas jerked upright. "No! Let me—"

"I know the Dark Web better." Her hand clamped his shoulder. "Trust me."

As the plane cut through clouds, Vivian stared out the window.

What condition was Liam in now?

Her fist clenched.

No matter what, she was bringing him home.
###Chapter 503

The plane descended over the isolated island when Vivian Laurent first noticed the barbed wire perimeter.

Lucas Lefèvre lowered his voice. "This place is even more heavily guarded than intel suggested."

Vivian narrowed her eyes, studying the offshore prison through the window. Cold moonlight reflected off the surrounding waters as searchlights swept across the high walls.

"Split up," she said tersely.

The dock security was suffocating. Every visitor underwent three layers of inspection, down to their fingernails.

Lucas observed from behind the rocks. "They rotate guards every thirty seconds."

Vivian tracked the patrol boats' patterns. "Frontal assault is impossible."

"Should we just blow up the whole island?" Lucas joked darkly.

She shot him a glare. "I need him alive."

Her gaze locked onto a supply boat crewman. The man had Lucas's build and was alone in the warehouse.

"Opportunity knocks." Vivian moved like a shadow.

Three minutes later, the unconscious crewman was hidden in a sea cave. Lucas quickly changed into the stolen uniform.

"Twenty-four hours max." Vivian adjusted his collar.

Lucas nodded and blended into the delivery team.

The waiting stretched endlessly. Vivian studied tide charts when she spotted an eastern blind spot.

"Only five feet deep at high tide..." she murmured.

At dusk the next day, Lucas returned pale-faced. "It's hell inside. Those prisoners...barely human anymore."

Vivian forced calm. "The map?"

His shaking hands sketched the prison layout. "Zero's in this block. Four armed guards rotating shifts."

"The waterway." Vivian pointed to a drainage outlet. "Leads directly beneath the cells."

Lucas inhaled sharply. "That's the sewage tank!"

"Better than bullet holes." She shredded the blueprint. "We move tonight."

The sea wind turned biting. Searchlights prowled the darkness like predator's eyes.
###Chapter 504

Night Rescue

The night hung low as salty sea winds lashed against jagged rocks. Vivian Laurent stood at the submarine hatch, conducting her final equipment check.

Three vials of specialized serums hung from her belt. A custom silicone mask obscured her features - meticulously designed to evade all facial recognition databases.

"Signal activated," Lucas Lefèvre's voice crackled through her earpiece. "Surveillance blackout in thirty seconds."

Vivian took a deep breath and plunged into the frigid water. Her black wetsuit made her indistinguishable from the darkness.

Metallic clangs echoed through the corridor outside Central Control. Before the guard could react, a precise strike to his neck sent him collapsing. Vivian caught the unconscious body and lowered it silently against the wall.

"Alert! Power system failure!" blared the emergency speakers.

The island plunged into darkness. Vivian pressed her wrist device, releasing electromagnetic pulses in concentric waves.

Five minutes until backup generators engaged. Three hundred seconds to locate Liam.

The electromagnetic pulse rendered electronic locks useless. The basement door swung open with ease, releasing a wave of coppery blood scent.

Her flashlight beam illuminated a torture rack. Chains bit into swollen flesh, the wounds already necrotic.

"Liam!" Her voice trembled.

The man raised his head slowly. His cracked lips parted. One eye remained swollen shut, but the other burned with startling intensity.

Three turns of the lockpick released the shackles. Liam collapsed forward into Vivian's waiting arms.

"Stay with me." She pressed a micro pistol into his palm. "We fight our way out."

His fingertip brushed her wrist in silent acknowledgment. That tiny gesture made her eyes burn.

Gunfire erupted down the corridor. Leaning against Vivian, Liam's mouth curved in that familiar smirk. He'd always known she'd come.

Shadow never disappointed.
###Chapter 505

The alarm shattered the night.

Vivian Laurent instantly detected approaching footsteps behind her. Flashlight beams swept through the darkness.

"Halt!" a guard barked.

The light froze on Vivian and Liam Valdemar.

"Intruders! They're—"

Before he could finish, Vivian lunged forward. Her hand struck the guard's neck with surgical precision.

But the alarm had already sounded.

"Move!" Vivian grabbed Liam's arm.

Though weakened, Liam moved with lethal efficiency. He kicked away an attacking guard, pressing his back against Vivian's to form a defensive stance.

Gunfire erupted.

Liam fired with deadly accuracy in the dark, each bullet finding its mark.

"Breakthrough!" Vivian commanded while returning fire.

Bullets whizzed past her ears as she rolled aside with fluid grace.

The thundering roar of helicopters approached.

"Dark Web reinforcements!" Vivian shouted.

Amidst the hail of gunfire, she seized Liam's hand. "Jump into the sea!"

Suddenly Liam shielded her with his body.

"Look out!"

The sickening sound of bullets piercing flesh echoed clearly.

"Liam!" The metallic tang of blood filled Vivian's nostrils.

"Don't look back. Jump!"

They plunged into the icy waters together.

Vivian swam desperately, her arms growing numb. Liam's body became heavier against her.

"Hold on..." She bit her lip until it bled.

A faint light appeared in the distance.

"Viv!" Lucas Lefèvre's voice called out.

Darkness swallowed Vivian's vision.

When she opened her eyes again, the cabin lights stabbed at her retinas.

"Lucas!" She bolted upright.

"Thank God you're awake." Lucas approached with a water glass. "We're almost at our destination."

"Where's Liam?"

"Still unconscious." Lucas grimaced. "I even gave him mouth-to-mouth to save his sorry ass."

Vivian threw off the blanket. "He's injured?"

"Took a bullet to the back. Nearly punctured a lung." Lucas followed her. "But he'll live."

Vivian pushed open the medical bay door. Liam's pale face greeted her.
###Chapter 506

The cabin lights flickered erratically.

Liam Valdemar lay slumped in his seat, his face as pale as parchment. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. His breathing grew shallow, yet his skin burned with fever.

Vivian Laurent yanked the blanket off him.

A gruesome wound came into view—the bullet hole in his right arm surrounded by sickly purple bruising.

"That bullet last night..." Her fingers trembled. It had been meant for her.

"Med kit!" she barked.

Lucas Lefèvre retrieved the emergency pack from storage. Basic medical tools were laid out on the fold-down table—no surgical light in sight.

"No time." Vivian snapped on gloves. "If we wait, he'll lose the arm."

She injected anesthesia into his vein. The scalpel sliced through flesh, releasing a rush of blood.

Lucas passed her hemostats, watching her precise movements. The bullet clinked into the metal tray.

"Lucky." Vivian sutured the wound. "Missed bone and nerves."

When she unbuttoned Liam's shirt, her breath caught.

Beneath the crisscrossed whip marks were unhealed burns. Layers of scars covered his torso like a grotesque mosaic.

"Dark Web's top agent..." Her throat tightened.

The boy who'd always taken missions in her stead now lay broken. Once capable of disarming three armed assailants single-handedly, he now struggled to breathe.

She'd heard rumors about the organization withholding pay, but this? Couldn't they spare five billion for his ransom?

As she tied the final stitch, turbulence rocked the plane. Vivian shielded Liam's injured arm, but blood still seeped through the bandage.

"Four hours till landing," Lucas said, checking the dashboard.

Gently, she wiped sweat from Liam's brow. She remembered the emergency kit he'd slipped into her gear before their last mission. His teasing voice echoed: "You won't need this with me around."

Now it was her turn.

"Contact Nathan," she ordered the moment the plane touched down. "Full trauma workup. Use the private entrance."

At the airport exit, Isabella Langley sprinted toward them in heels. She grabbed Vivian's wrist. "Dark Web's spreading word that Liam's dead."

Vivian clenched her fists, staring at the ashen man on the stretcher.

"Get him to the hospital," she whispered. "Alert everyone. Prepare for hunters."
###Chapter 507

Isabella Langley grabbed Vivian Laurent's wrist.

"Are you insane? The Dark Web has issued a bounty!"

Vivian shook her off with steely determination.

"I know."

Isabella stamped her foot in frustration.

"A ten-billion-dollar reward will mobilize the entire underworld!"

Vivian walked to the window, gazing into the night.

"So what?"

Isabella followed urgently.

"Liam is a ticking time bomb! If he stays with you, he'll expose your location!"

Vivian turned, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"I won't abandon him."

Isabella inhaled sharply.

"Do you even understand how the Dark Web operates? They're untraceable—even by Interpol!"

Vivian gave a humorless laugh.

"And?"

Isabella's eyes reddened with panic.

"They'll stop at nothing to find you!"

Vivian moved to the hospital bed, checking on the unconscious Liam.

"Let them come."

Isabella gritted her teeth.

"You're being unreasonable!"

Vivian adjusted Liam's IV line.

"His injuries are too severe."

Isabella lowered her voice abruptly.

"The Organization already has people searching for him."

Vivian's hands stilled.

"Since when?"

Isabella leaned closer.

"Two hours after we left."

Vivian smirked coldly.

"How efficient."

Isabella seized her arm.

"It's not too late to return him!"

Vivian shoved her away.

"Never."

Isabella paced wildly.

"You're signing your own death warrant!"

Vivian dialed a number on her phone.

"I need a safe house."

A deep male voice responded.

"Meet at the usual spot in three hours."

Hanging up, Vivian faced Isabella.

"I need a favor."

Isabella backed away warily.

"What now?"

Vivian flashed a dangerous smile.

"Distract the Organization's surveillance."

Isabella's eyes widened.

"You're out of your mind!"

Vivian patted her shoulder.

"Consider it repayment for last time."

Isabella stomped again.

"You'll get us all killed!"

Vivian was already packing supplies.

"Trust me."

Nathan Clementson entered abruptly.

"The test results are in."

He handed Vivian a file.

"It's worse than we thought."

Vivian scanned the report quickly.

"Can he recover?"

Nathan adjusted his glasses.

"He'll need prolonged rest."

Vivian closed the file.

"Thanks, Nathan."

Nathan hesitated.

"This patient... he's special?"

Vivian stuffed the file into her bag.

"An old friend."

Nathan took the hint.

"Call if you need anything."

Vivian nodded.

"Dinner's on me next time."

Isabella rushed over suddenly.

"They've tracked us to the hospital!"

Vivian's expression hardened.

"Take the back exit."

She lifted Liam effortlessly.

Nathan blocked her path.

"Use the staff elevator."

The three moved swiftly down the corridor.

Footsteps pounded toward them.

Isabella gripped Vivian's sleeve.

"We're out of time!"

Vivian passed Liam to Nathan.

"Get him out first."

Isabella clung to her.

"What about you?"

Vivian's smile turned glacial.

"I'll entertain our guests."
###Chapter 508

Nathan frowned at Vivian's bandaged wrist.

"You managed to get injured during vacation?"

She stuck out her tongue playfully. "Slipped at the gym."

"That doesn't look like a gym injury." His skepticism was evident.

"Maybe... boxing?"

Nathan shook his head helplessly and flicked her forehead.

"That little boy came looking for you again," he changed the subject. "He always looks so disappointed when you're not here."

Vivian immediately pictured the chubby-cheeked child.

"Theo?"

"Exactly. From toddlers to elderly ladies, everyone adores you." Nathan teased.

She made a face. "Jealous, Nathan?"

"Terribly." He sighed dramatically.

"You're the popular one. Didn't that lady want to set you up last time?"

Nathan pretended to knock her head, making Vivian duck away laughing.

Exhaustion hit her the moment she entered her office.

Vivian slumped onto her desk and fell asleep instantly.

She woke to find a round little face inches from hers.

"Pretty doctor!"

Theo's eyes sparkled like he'd discovered treasure.

"When did you get here?" Vivian straightened hastily.

"Just now." He beamed. "I waited quietly when I saw you sleeping."

Her heart melted. "I heard you've been looking for me?"

Theo nodded vigorously. "Missed you."

"Next time I'm not here, call me." She pulled out her phone. "Do you know your number?"

The child rattled off digits without hesitation.

"I'll take you to Disneyland during vacation," Vivian saved the contact, "but only if your parents agree."

Theo's face lit up. "Can... can I bring Uncle Ethan too?"

Vivian paused.

"Not your mom and dad?"

He shook his head. "Uncle Ethan loves me most."

She thoughtfully ruffled his hair.

This little one seemed particularly attached to his uncle.
###Chapter 509

"Alright." Vivian agreed readily.

Theo jumped with excitement. "This is amazing!"

Now he could bring Uncle Ethan to visit Aunt Vivian whenever he wanted—she'd promised it herself.

Overcome with joy, Theo threw himself into Vivian's arms.

A sharp pain shot through Vivian's injured arm as the impact hit. She sucked in a breath through gritted teeth.

"Sister, are you hurt?" Theo immediately pulled back.

Vivian forced a smile. "It's nothing. Just a sore arm. It'll heal in a couple days."

Theo's eyes darted thoughtfully before he quickly texted Ethan: "Uncle! Aunt Vivian's injured!"

Knowing his uncle would rush over, Theo politely excused himself. "Pretty sister, I should go now."

"Let me walk you out?"

"No need! You should rest." He skipped out the door.

Vivian went to check on Liam's condition.

Despite stable vitals indicating he should've woken by now, Liam remained unconscious. Lucas and Isabella kept vigil by his bedside.

"Why aren't you two getting some rest?" Vivian asked.

Isabella stretched lazily. "I've been lying around so much my bones ache. Lucas is the one who needs sleep."

Lucas shook his head. "I can rest here."

"You don't even know him. Isn't this strange?"

Isabella replied matter-of-factly, "We need to see his reaction when he wakes up. It's important."

Vivian had no rebuttal.

"Suit yourselves. Notify me when he regains consciousness."

After finishing rounds, she returned to her office just as rapid footsteps approached.

"Vivian!"

Ethan burst through the door like a storm.

"What do you want now?" She frowned.

"I heard—" He abruptly cut himself off.

"Heard what?"

He couldn't very well admit Theo had tattled.

Ethan cleared his throat. "Heard you were back at work. Came to check."

"I—"

He interrupted, "Had lunch? Feeling alright?"

"Ate. Perfectly fine."

"Really?" Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Then take your clothes off so I can examine you."

Vivian's eyes widened.

What fresh madness was this?

"You first," she shot back.

"If I strip, you will too?" He arched an eyebrow.

"Get out!" She shoved him, only to wince when the motion aggravated her injury.

Ethan seized her wrist. "You're hurt?"
###Chapter 510

"No." Vivian Laurent tried to pull her hand away forcefully.

Ethan Roscente didn't dare grip too tight, afraid of hurting her.

"That wound is obvious. You need to see a doctor." Ethan's brows furrowed deeply.

Theo had mentioned Vivian wasn't feeling well. Now seeing the injury on her hand with his own eyes, Ethan's chest tightened painfully.

"I am a doctor." Vivian said coldly. "Don't cause trouble in my hospital."

"I'm not causing trouble." Ethan's voice lowered. "You should at least take care of yourself."

His intense gaze burned into Vivian, concern unmistakable in his eyes.

Theo had been running to the hospital constantly these past two days. Ethan naturally knew Vivian wasn't here.

He'd assumed she was with Dominic Atlante—but Dominic was clearly still in New York.

"Where I go is none of your business. Ex-husband." Vivian deliberately emphasized the last word.

Ethan's chest constricted. "Vivian, we need to talk."

"Busy." She pushed past him. "Move."

"You're injured and still working?" Ethan blocked her path. "Can't the hospital function without you for one day?"

"Ethan Roscente!" Impatience laced Vivian's tone.

"I just want to know where you're hurt." His voice softened.

"Just a pulled muscle from working out." She dismissed casually.

"Medicine then. I'll get it." Ethan turned to leave.

Vivian calculated using this chance to slip away.

Ethan suddenly stopped. "I'll have someone deliver it."

Vivian gritted her teeth.

Why wouldn't this man leave her alone?

The past she'd worked so hard to forget kept getting stirred up by him again and again.

"Vivian!" Isabella Langley appeared at the doorway suddenly. "He's awake."

"Really?"

Vivian shoved Ethan aside and hurried after her.

Ethan stood frozen.

Who had woken up?

Who could make Vivian rush off like this?

Dominic was perfectly fine.

He followed quickly but found himself locked outside the hospital room.

Through the glass, he saw Vivian leaning over the patient's bed.

The focused expression on her face—he'd never seen it before.

A sour ache spread through Ethan's chest.

She was injured herself, yet her first priority was someone else.

If he were the one lying in that hospital bed, would Vivian even glance his way?

She'd probably stab him instead.
###Chapter 511

The hospital room reeked of antiseptic.

Vivian Laurent stood by the bed, gazing at the frail figure.

"Liam," she whispered.

The man's lashes fluttered. His pale lips trembled as he struggled to sit up. "Shadow?" His voice shook with disbelief.

"It's me." Vivian dropped all pretense now that the rescue was complete.

"You...really are Shadow?"

Liam's disheveled bangs accentuated his pallor. He reached out with trembling fingers.

"Am I alive? Or is this heaven?"

Vivian had never seen him so fragile—like glass that might shatter at a touch.

"We're both alive." She clasped his hand. "This is a hospital in Canada. You're safe."

Suddenly he pulled her into a crushing embrace.

His face buried against her chest hid the calculating glint in his eyes.

Everything had gone according to plan.

From issuing the assassination contract to accepting it himself, then getting captured intentionally—each step designed to lure out the long-missing Shadow.

He had to know why she'd been avoiding him.

"I thought I'd never see you again." His voice cracked with emotion.

Vivian's heart twisted. Liam had always been too good to her. Had his capture been...

She allowed the embrace but remained clear-headed. Their bond was one of life-and-death camaraderie, sibling affection—never romance.

"I'm sorry for keeping secrets." She spoke softly. "When you're stronger, I'll explain everything."

"Ahem!"

Lucas Lefèvre's cough shattered the moment.

Vivian released Liam. "This is Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre. They helped rescue you."

Liam's gaze flickered over them, his sharpness vanishing instantly.

"Thank you for saving me."

"Don't mention it!" Isabella grinned brightly. "Vivian's friends are our friends too."

She studied Liam covertly. This man was nothing like Dominic Atlante—no agent's edge, just boyish sunshine.
###Chapter 512 

Liam's pale fingers clutched the bedsheet edge. His voice was feather-light. "Shadow, has the Dark Web contract been issued?"

Vivian Laurent paused while adjusting the IV drip.

"You shouldn't take such risks for me." His long lashes cast shadows across his face. "My life isn't worth saving."

Smack—Vivian slapped his shoulder.

"The life I saved isn't yours to throw away." She leaned down, locking eyes with him. "Remember, your life belongs to me now."

A sudden smile lit Liam's face, tiny sparks flickering in his eyes.

"Why did you take the France contract?" Vivian asked abruptly.

"Organization assignment." His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Vivian's brows knitted together. "The Director's ambitions grow daily." She changed tack. "But that's irrelevant now. Focus on recovery first. Afterward, will you return to the organization or—"

"I've decided." Liam interrupted.

His gaze burned into Vivian. "If I survive this, I just want to be ordinary." His Adam's apple bobbed. "Shadow... can I stay with you?"

The room fell silent except for the IV drip's rhythmic sound.

Vivian turned to organize the medicine box. "We'll discuss it after you recover."

As she grabbed her coat to leave, Liam seized her wrist.

"These past years..." His voice held cautious hesitation. "Were you alright? Just five minutes. Please?"

Vivian looked down at his bandaged hand.

"Two minutes." She relented, waving off the two people by the door. "Give us privacy."

......

Outside, Ethan Roscente's polished shoes had worn a path in the hallway carpet.

When he checked his watch for the third time, the hospital door finally opened.

Only Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre emerged.

Ethan lunged forward. "Where's Vivian?"

Isabella crossed her arms, smirking. "Mr. Roscente has spare time?"

Her fingers flicked, sending a silver needle glinting coldly under the lights.
###Chapter 513

Isabella Langley felt fury surge through her veins the moment she laid eyes on Ethan Roscente's face.

How dare this man show his face in front of Vivian again!

"Your audacity truly knows no bounds," Isabella sneered. "Haven't you done enough damage to Vivian already?"

Ethan remained silent.

He understood Vivian's best friend despised him, but seeing Vivian had such loyal protection comforted him.

"Who's in that hospital room?" Ethan frowned. "Why is Vivian alone in there?"

"None of your damn business," Isabella scoffed. "What right do you have to ask about Vivian's affairs?"

She dramatically tapped her forehead. "Oh right, you're her ex-husband. An ex who couldn't keep it in his pants has no business inquiring about Vivian's life."

"Didn't think about consequences when you tricked her into marriage? Now you're having regrets?" Isabella's voice rose with each word. "How do you plan to make up for all the suffering you've caused her?"

Years of pent-up rage fueled Isabella's outburst.

She'd vehemently opposed when Vivian abandoned her promising career to marry Ethan Roscente.

Someone as brilliant as Vivian throwing everything away for a man?

And what did she get in return?

Nothing but repeated disappointments before receiving divorce papers.

Had Ethan not wasted those precious years, Vivian could have achieved so much more.

In Isabella's eyes, Ethan Roscente never deserved Vivian Laurent.

"There were misunderstandings about Sophia Evans and me," Ethan attempted to explain. "That child—"

"Here comes another tall tale," Isabella cut him off. "You're really going to deny paternity now? Don't tell me you'll claim the child isn't yours?"

She despised spineless men who refused accountability.

"The boy isn't mine," Ethan stated firmly.

Isabella trembled with rage. "Ethan Roscente, you're not just a cheat—you're a coward! Denying your own flesh and blood!"

"You admitted the child was yours before. Now you're lying to manipulate Vivian again?" Her fists clenched. "If we weren't in a hospital, I'd punch your lights out!"

She took a deep breath. "Stay away from Vivian. If you harass her again, I'll make you regret it."
###Chapter 514

Sunlight streamed through the window at the end of the corridor. Ethan Roscente stood at the edge of light and shadow, his gaze soft as he watched Vivian Laurent.

Isabella Langley shielded Vivian like a protective mother hen.

"Vivian, are you okay?" Isabella asked nervously, gripping her hand.

Vivian shook her head, her eyes sweeping over the three of them.

Ethan's tall figure cast a long shadow down the hallway. His lips were pressed together, his attention fixed on Vivian.

"I was just worried about you," he said, his voice low.

Lucas Lefèvre scoffed and moved to Vivian's other side.

A cough sounded from inside the hospital room.

Vivian immediately glanced back, her brow furrowing slightly.

"This isn't the place to talk," she murmured.

Ethan noticed her reaction, his expression darkening.

"Is that patient important to you?" he couldn't help asking.

Isabella bristled instantly. "None of your business!"

Vivian sighed. "Ethan, you should go."

Ethan clenched his fist, then slowly relaxed.

"Alright," he nodded. "Call me if you need anything."

Before turning away, he gave the hospital door a long, searching look.

Only when Ethan was gone did Isabella finally exhale in relief.

"Vivian, what was he doing here?"

Vivian rubbed her temples. "It's a long story."

Inside the room, Liam Valdemar leaned against the headboard, listening to the voices outside.

He stared at his bandaged hands, his eyes shadowed.

In the hallway, Vivian turned to Isabella. "You two should head back. I need to stay with the patient."

"Is it the one who saved you?" Lucas asked.

Vivian nodded. "His injuries are severe."

Isabella glanced uneasily at the door. "Do you want me to stay with you?"

"No," Vivian forced a small smile. "Come back tomorrow."

After seeing them off, Vivian pushed open the hospital room door.

Liam immediately softened his expression.

"Did we disturb you?" Vivian asked quietly.

He shook his head. "I'm fine."

She poured him a glass of water, noticing the veins standing out on his hands as she passed it to him.

"Does it hurt?" she asked.

Liam took the cup, his fingertips brushing hers briefly.

"Not when you're here," he said with a smile.

Vivian didn't catch the dark glint that flickered in his eyes.

Outside the window, Ethan stood on the sidewalk below, staring up at the hospital room.

He pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Run a full background check on everyone Vivian has had contact with recently."
###Chapter 515

Ethan Roscente was about to speak.

"What are you waiting for? Didn't you hear Vivian tell you to leave?" Isabella Langley cut him off sharply.

She stood protectively beside Vivian Laurent, her eyes filled with hostility.

For the first time, Ethan felt utterly powerless.

He gave Vivian one last lingering look before turning away.

But he didn't go far.

Across from the hospital, Ethan emptied nearly every shelf at the pharmacy.

Bruise ointments, pain relief creams, circulation patches... Soon Vivian's desk was buried under piles of medical supplies.

...

"That infuriating man!" Isabella slammed her fist on the table. "He's just as bad as Felix Valdemar!"

"The most ridiculous part? He claimed the child wasn't his, but couldn't say whose it was when pressed."

Vivian gently patted her back. "Don't waste your energy on someone like that."

"I'm worried he'll keep harassing you."

"I can handle it." Vivian turned to Lucas Lefèvre. "Take her home to rest."

Lucas shook his head. "I'm not tired."

"That's a doctor's order." Vivian adopted her stern professional tone.

Before leaving, Isabella lowered her voice. "Keep an eye on that Liam Valdemar too."

"After all these years apart, who knows what kind of person he's become now."

Vivian nodded. "I'll be careful."

After seeing them off, Vivian returned to her office.

A wave of exhaustion suddenly hit her.

She yawned, deciding to spend the night at the hospital.

Opening her office door, she was greeted by mountains of medical supplies.

Picking up a random box, Vivian shook her head in disbelief.

"Did he buy out the entire pharmacy?"

She methodically organized the supplies before heading to the on-call room.

The hot shower eased her fatigue but couldn't wash away the drowsiness.

That night, she slept deeper than usual.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains when she finally stirred.

Rubbing her eyes, she checked the time—it was already morning.

"How did I sleep so long?"

After a quick freshening up, she walked drowsily to her office.

"Morning, Dr. Laurent," colleagues greeted her.

Checking the schedule, Vivian found no shifts assigned to her.

"Nathan?" She turned to Nathan Clementson in confusion.

"Injured doctors should rest," he said without looking up.

"I'm perfectly fine." Vivian flexed her arm. "Ryan, need an assistant?"

She winked at Ryan Fairsprene.
###Chapter 516
The Little Spy

Ryan Fairsprene's hands trembled slightly as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

"Having Dr. Laurent assist me... I don't deserve such an honor."

His voice quivered with unease.

Ever since Vivian's pregnancy, Nathan Clementson had strictly forbidden her from operating. No matter how many patients flooded the hospital or how urgent the surgeries became, he adamantly refused to let her participate.

Restless, Vivian could only make rounds, checking on patients—including Liam Valdemar.

After a day of rest, Liam's complexion had visibly improved.

When he saw Vivian in her white lab coat, his pupils contracted sharply.

"Shadow... you're working here as a doctor?"

He feigned surprise.

The truth was, he'd known all along. After their chance encounter during the cruise casino incident, he'd thoroughly investigated her—the renowned Dr. Luna, whose waiting list stretched for miles.

But he had to play dumb, pretending this was his first discovery that Shadow was still alive.

Vivian gave a slight nod. "Call me Vivian. That's my real name."

Her eyes held apology. "I'm sorry, Liam. All these years you've been searching for me, yet I never reached out."

"Vivian..." Liam tested the waters. "May I call you Vivi?"

"Of course."

Isabella and the others called her that. Though Liam was older—the thought of him addressing her as "big sister" was unimaginable.

"What happened these past three years? Can you tell me?"

Liam carefully closed the distance, preparing to swiftly integrate into Vivian's life.

She shrugged. "Nothing extraordinary. Failing that last mission made me realize many things. Life's too short—you have to seize happiness when you find it. I met someone I loved, so I got married."

A pause. "I didn't want to disturb you, so I stayed hidden. Sorry for making you search so long."

Liam smiled tenderly. "Just knowing you're alive is enough. Vivi... it's so good to see you again."

"What are your plans now?"

Liam shook his head. "No concrete ideas yet. I'll focus on recovering first. I might need to trouble you during this period."

"Don't mention it." Vivian waved a hand. "Leave it to me."

"I'm unfamiliar with Seattle. Don't even have a place to stay."

"I'll handle accommodations." Vivian patted her chest. "Won't let you sleep on the streets."

Liam had assumed he'd move into her home, but instead, she immediately tasked Lucas with finding a property.

Vivian was currently strapped for cash. She'd transferred billions to Liam earlier and hadn't had time to replenish her funds—her pockets were practically empty.

Buying a house would likely require borrowing from Isabella.

She spread property listings before Liam. "Pick one you like. I'll purchase it."

"No rush." Liam declined politely. "Let's discuss after I'm discharged."

"Alright. A few more days of observation then."

Just as Liam prepared to continue their conversation, a knock interrupted.

"I'll get it."

Vivian opened the door to find Theo Evans standing there, masked.

"Doctor Vivian!" His sweet voice chirped through the fabric.

"How did you find this room?"

"The other nurses told me."

Theo had an ulterior motive for visiting today.

His uncle had sent him to gather intelligence—the little spy was on a mission.
###Chapter 517

"Are you free now, sis?"

"I just finished my shift. Let's talk in my office." Vivian Laurent took Theo's chubby little hand, leading him down the hospital corridor.

"Who was that patient earlier?" Theo tilted his face up, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

He needed to gather intel for Uncle Ethan. This could be a potential rival.

"An old friend."

"An auntie or uncle? Have you known them long?" Theo pressed further.

Vivian chuckled at his innocent questioning. "An uncle. We've known each other for years."

Theo's heart sank. A long-time male friend? That sounded like serious competition for his uncle.

"Do you like him?" Theo stamped his foot impatiently.

Vivian paused. "Just like you and your kindergarten friends. We're good friends."

Theo suddenly lowered his head, voice muffled. "I don't have any friends."

"Hmm?"

"You're my first friend!" His smile reappeared, though the medical mask covered most of his face. The loneliness in his eyes remained visible.

Vivian's heart softened. The boy always wore that mask—she'd never seen his full face.

"Can I see what you look like, Theo?"

He immediately clutched his mask, shaking his head violently.

No way! He looked too much like Uncle Ethan.

"Alright, whenever you're ready." Vivian ruffled his hair affectionately.

After leaving the hospital, Theo headed straight for Roscente Group.

Sophia Sherwood stood in the lobby when a child strolled in boldly.

Stranger still—the receptionist didn't stop him. Instead, she personally escorted him to the CEO's private elevator.

"Who's that child?" Sophia intercepted the receptionist.

"Mr. Roscente's special guest, Manager Sherwood."

Sophia's eyes darkened. Could this be Ethan and Sophia Evans' love child?

As she watched the ascending elevator numbers, her nails dug deep into her palms.

In the top-floor office, Theo looked around curiously.

Ethan was on the phone with Patrick Alpinus, expression grim.

"Dark Web prison break? When?"

"Past two days," Patrick's voice came through the receiver. "Several high-profile inmates escaped."

Ethan's brow furrowed. The Dark Web was an underground organization even law enforcement couldn't touch. This breakout was no accident.

He spotted the small figure peeking through the doorway and ended the call abruptly.

"Uncle Ethan!" Theo rushed forward, wrapping his arms around the man's legs.

Ethan lifted the boy into his arms, unaware of Sophia's venomous gaze through the glass office doors.
###Chapter 518

"Patrick, the Dark Web really got what they deserved this time." Ethan Roscente's voice dripped with schadenfreude.

Dominic Atlante tapped his fingers rhythmically on the desk. "They had it coming."

"The irony? They can't even report it to the police." Patrick Alpinus laughed louder. "Those filthy rats are scrambling to find their missing people."

Ethan's gaze darkened. "Any leads on who did it?"

"It's bizarre." Patrick lowered his voice. "Their entire prison was emptied without a trace. Not even the surveillance caught anything."

Vivian Laurent's face flashed through Ethan's mind.

Too coincidental.

She'd disappeared two days ago and returned injured. The Dark Web incident happened during the same timeframe.

"Ethan? You still there?" Patrick's voice crackled through the phone.

Knock knock knock—

The office door interrupted.

Ethan looked up to see Theo Evans peeking through the glass door on tiptoes.

"We'll talk later." He ended the call abruptly.

"Uncle!" Theo scampered in, eyes sparkling. "I found out!"

Ethan lifted the boy onto his lap. "Tell me."

"It's a man in that room!" Theo whispered conspiratorially. "He's known Aunt Vivian for years!"

Ethan's fingers stiffened.

A man? Known for years?

A chilling suspicion formed—was this the person rescued from the Dark Web prison?

"Uncle, you look scary." Theo poked his cheek.

Ethan massaged his temples.

If Vivian had done this...just how many secrets was she hiding? Moving freely within the Dark Web defied all logic.

He immediately dialed the hospital's internal line.

"Pull the records for VIP Room 3's patient."

Ten minutes later, the reply came.

"Mr. Roscente, no access. The patient's information is classified—only Dr. Laurent has clearance."

Ethan clenched his fist.

This level of secrecy confirmed his doubts.

Standing before the floor-to-ceiling windows, he stared toward the hospital. Vivian remained an enigma—every time he thought he grasped the truth, it slipped away like smoke.

Now there was this mysterious man.

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. Whoever made Vivian risk herself would pay dearly.
###Chapter 519

Twilight descended as Ethan Roscente closed his files precisely on time. He took Theo's chubby little hand.

"Let's go get some BBQ."

The elevator doors opened to reveal Sophia Sherwood approaching in stilettos.

"Mr. Roscente, what a coincidence!"

She feigned surprise as she bent down toward Theo. "And who is this handsome young man?"

"My son." Ethan shielded Theo behind him.

Whispers rippled through the surrounding employees.

Sophia plastered on a saccharine smile. "Hello there, sweetheart. I'm Aunt Sophia—"

"No!"

Theo immediately hid behind Ethan's legs, his tiny face scrunched up.

This woman smiled like the fox spirit from cartoons. He wanted nothing to do with her.

Ethan gave Sophia an icy glare before striding away with his son.

Sophia dug her nails into her palms as she watched them leave.

——

Saturday dawned bright over the packed surgical outpatient department at Capital Hospital.

Vivian Laurent had just finished examining a fracture patient when she pressed the call button.

The door swung open as she was writing medical notes.

"What seems to be the problem?"

Her pen stilled when she saw Sophia.

"Can't the great Dr. Laurent diagnose patients at a glance?" Sophia crossed her legs, oozing sarcasm.

Vivian closed the chart. "Please describe your symptoms."

"Aren't doctors supposed to observe and diagnose?" Sophia suddenly slammed the desk. "Or are you just a quack?"

Heads turned in the waiting area.

Vivian pressed the emergency button. "Security, we have a disturbance in Exam Room 3."
###Chapter 520

"File a complaint if you want. Get out now." Vivian Laurent's icy gaze swept over Sophia Sherwood, not even granting her a second glance.

This pathetic attempt to pick a fight was laughable. The hospital was packed with patients waiting in line, yet Sophia was here wasting medical resources.

"Dr. Laurent seems quite irritable today." Sophia remained seated, tapping her fingers lightly on the desk. "I haven't finished my consultation yet."

She lowered her voice abruptly. "By the way, Ethan keeps mentioning you lately."

Vivian's hand paused slightly as she flipped through the medical records.

"His son is extremely clingy, always demanding his father's attention." Sophia smiled meaningfully. "The boy looks just like him—same eyes, same nose. A carbon copy."

The air conditioner hummed loudly in the examination room.

"I recommend seeing a psychiatrist." Vivian snapped the medical file shut. "Next patient!"

As security escorted Sophia out, she was still loudly mentioning the Roscente Group's annual gala.

Vivian stared at the computer screen, the cursor blinking on the patient record.

So Ethan hadn't shown up these past few days because he was with his son. She clicked the mouse mechanically, suddenly finding the keyboard glaringly bright.

During lunch break, a colleague handed her coffee. "You look terrible."

"Didn't sleep well last night." Vivian rubbed her temples. She'd been unusually drowsy lately, nearly falling asleep on her feet during rounds.

Before leaving work, she made a point to check on Liam. The young man was in rehab, his eyes lighting up when he saw her.

When she got home, the living room lights were blazing. Dominic Atlante and Finn Deross stood like sentinels, one seated, one standing.

"What's this about?" Vivian kicked off her heels.

Finn rushed over. "Master! Three Dark Web strongholds were just taken down!"

Vivian's bag hit the floor with a thud.
###Chapter 521

"Oh?" Vivian's smile froze on her lips.

Finn took a step closer. "I heard someone raided the maritime prison to rescue a prisoner and got away unscathed. You must've heard about it, Master?"

Vivian picked up her water glass. "Vaguely."

"Do you know who did it?" Finn pressed.

Her fingers tapped lightly against the rim of the glass.

Dominic's gaze swept over her like a searchlight, studying her microexpressions.

"How would I know?" She took a sip of water.

"But you weren't home the past two days." Finn eyed her suspiciously. In his mind, only his master possessed such skills.

Vivian set down the glass. "Check the hospital overtime records if you don't believe me."

She suddenly realized something. "Wait, why am I explaining myself to you? Since when does a master report her whereabouts to her disciple?"

"I'm just curious!" Finn blinked innocently. "Something this big on the Dark Web must involve you. How could you not include me in such an exciting mission? Am I not your favorite disciple anymore?"

Vivian would never admit it, especially not in front of Dominic.

"Accusations require evidence." She narrowed her eyes. "No proof means it's just slander."

Finn fell silent.

But in his heart, he was certain his master was involved.

Vivian pointed at Finn. "You—bedtime."

Then she turned to Dominic. "And you, what are you still doing in my house this late?"

Dominic chuckled. "It's only nine. Still jet-lagged, Dr. Laurent?"

His X-ray gaze seemed to pierce through her.

Some things were better left unsaid.

Vivian gritted her teeth. "Seems the jet lag belongs to Mr. Atlante. Keep loitering and I might just create some problems for Integrity Group."

"Bring it on." He shrugged. "I've been bored lately."

Vivian ignored them both.

As she turned to leave, she noticed the glass on the coffee table.

"What's that?" She pointed at the orange liquid inside.

Finn's eyes lit up. "My special juice blend! Uncle said it's too sour. Want to try, Master?"

Truthfully, even he found it unpalatable and had been looking for someone to share the misery.

In the spirit of not wasting food, he decided his master should experience it too.
###Chapter 

Vivian Laurent stared at the glass before her, its contents a pale yellow liquid.

"Is this drinkable?" She swirled the glass skeptically.

Finn Deross immediately raised both hands. "Master, I wouldn't dare poison you! Besides, someone as skilled as you would detect any toxin."

Vivian took a tentative sip, her eyebrows lifting in surprise.

It actually tasted good.

She drained the glass in one go, licking her lips. "More?"

Finn gaped at her.

He'd tried it earlier—it was sour enough to make his teeth ache.

"Master...you actually like it?"

Vivian nodded. "The lemon flavor is authentic."

Dominic Atlante stood nearby, his brow furrowed.

Finn had tricked him into tasting it earlier, and his mouth still watered from the acidity.

"Miss Laurent has...unique taste buds."

Vivian accepted a second glass from Finn and downed it immediately.

Setting the glass down, she turned to Dominic. "Mr. Atlante, it's late."

The implication was clear.

Dominic chuckled. "Is Miss Laurent dismissing me?"

"I simply think it's unsafe to have a strange man in my home at midnight."

"Strange?" Amusement flickered in Dominic's eyes. "It seems we're not well enough acquainted."

He stepped closer. "Perhaps I should stay the night and get to know Miss Laurent better."

Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Finn, see our guest out."

Finn immediately positioned himself between them. "Uncle, let me walk you out."

Vivian turned and ascended the stairs without another word.

Dominic watched her retreating figure disappear around the landing.

"She's certainly extraordinary."

Finn scratched his head. "Master has always been remarkable."

"No one else could have accomplished what she did." Dominic's tone was complex.

By all rights, such a threat should have been eliminated.

Yet he'd spared her repeatedly.

"Why didn't Master take me along?" Finn muttered.

Dominic gave him a sidelong glance. "Take you? As dead weight?"

Finn: "..."

He was still her apprentice, damn it!
###Chapter 523

Hot water cascaded over Vivian's skin as she stepped out of the shower. She dried herself and slipped into her pajamas.

A yawn escaped her lips. Fatigue washed over her like a tidal wave.

Lately, she'd been inexplicably drowsy, though her medical reports showed nothing unusual.

Shaking her head, Vivian pulled back the covers and settled into bed.

Darkness swallowed the room as the bedside lamp flickered off.

She jolted awake in the dead of night.

In her dream, Ethan Roscente stood bathed in moonlight, waiting for her. The vision made no sense.

Her throat felt parched. Vivian rose to fetch a glass of water.

A sliver of streetlight seeped through the imperfectly drawn curtains, painting a pale stripe across the floorboards.

Her gaze drifted to the window.

A black Maybach sat motionless beyond the gate.

Beside it stood a tall figure, the ember of his cigarette pulsing like a firefly in the darkness.

Vivian ducked behind the curtains.

Ethan.

Her phone screen glared 2:43 AM.

How long had he been standing there?

Why hadn't he rung the bell?

Her fingers twisted the curtain fabric until her knuckles whitened.

She told herself to ignore him.

Yet her legs carried her downstairs against her will.

The night air stung her cheeks before she realized she'd stepped outside.

Ethan was lighting another cigarette.

The lighter's flame danced between his fingers.

When he looked up and saw Vivian, the cigarette tumbled from his lips.

The flame died.

They stared at each other across the shadows.

Vivian could hear her own heartbeat pounding in her ears.

She should hate him.

But her heart betrayed reason.

Ethan stood frozen, afraid this was another illusion.

Until Vivian whispered, "What are you doing here?"

Her quiet words made his eyes redden.
###Chapter 524

The night was deep and silent. Ethan Roscente stood motionless, afraid to disturb the figure before him.

Vivian Laurent's silhouette looked especially fragile under the moonlight. She had rushed downstairs wearing only a silk nightgown.

Ethan closed the distance in three quick strides. Without hesitation, he removed his suit jacket.

He carefully draped it over Vivian's shoulders, his fingertips accidentally brushing against her hair.

"It's freezing. You should dress warmer."

Vivian didn't refuse, standing quietly in place.

Seeing her wrapped in his jacket, Ethan's lips curved upward unconsciously.

"You're really here. Not a hallucination."

His voice held undisguised joy, his gaze warm enough to melt ice.

Vivian stood on the steps, moonlight outlining her delicate profile.

"I know what you want to say," Ethan spoke first. "Just seeing you makes me happy. I'll leave soon."

He paused, his eyes lingering on Vivian's slightly pale face.

"How's your injury? Don't push yourself too hard. Get proper rest."

"You don't need to save the world. Just take care of yourself."

Vivian looked up at him. This talkative man seemed like a different person from her memories.

"Ethan, you..."

Her words trailed off.

She'd intended to coldly send him away, but couldn't bring herself to say the harsh words now.

The night wind tousled her long hair and stirred her emotions.

Ethan's gaze dropped to her slightly parted lips. His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

Reason told him to restrain himself, but longing had already broken through all defenses.

Weeks of pent-up emotions churned in his chest.

That unfamiliar man's sudden appearance, their intimate interactions - everything had driven him mad with jealousy.

"Go back." Vivian turned her face away, nails digging into her palms.

Before she finished speaking, Ethan's arm snaked around her waist.

His scorching kiss descended without mercy, carrying months of suppressed yearning.

Vivian found herself engulfed in his scent, her very breath stolen away.
###Chapter 525

"Eth—" Vivian's protest was silenced as Ethan's lips captured hers.

His kiss was featherlight, restrained—as if afraid to bruise her.

She could feel the hunger he held in check, the readiness to pull away at any moment.

Vivian frowned but didn't push him away.

The kiss deepened, Ethan's control fraying at the edges.

She should be furious. Yet his tenderness left her limbs weak.

Only his arm around her waist kept her upright.

"Ethan... stop..." She finally regained her senses.

He released her, watching as she panted against his chest.

"You—again!" Vivian shoved him away.

"Forgive me." Ethan's gaze burned. "I just... I can't help wanting you near."

Vivian's eyes widened.

How dare he say such things!

"It's been too long, Vivian." He nuzzled her hair like a wounded beast.

"Stop pretending." She turned her face away.

"I'm not." Ethan's voice turned serious. "That boy isn't mine. He's my brother's."

"Lies." She scoffed.

Three years of marriage, and he'd never mentioned a brother.

"I'll explain when you're ready." He smoothed her hair. "It's late. You should rest."

Before she could react, he guided her back toward the building.

Only when she lay in bed did realization strike.

Not only had she allowed that kiss—she'd enjoyed it.

Vivian bolted upright.

Ethan's jacket still draped her shoulders.

That man had planned this.

At the window, she found him still by his car.

His gaze lifted, searing through the night.

Vivian ducked away, pulse racing.

It had to be Finn's drink. Nothing else could explain this madness.
###Chapter 526

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Vivian Laurent finally stirred awake.

Her fingers brushed against a suit jacket beside her.

Ethan Roscente's jacket.

Vivian bolted upright as last night's memories flooded back.

She remembered sleeping deeply yet having a strange dream.

In the dream, Ethan had stood by her bed calling her name.

When she woke, he was actually there.

"Was I drugged...?"

Rubbing her temples, Vivian sensed something was off.

"Morning, Master!" Finn Deross peeked from the kitchen with a breakfast tray. "Made your favorite soup dumplings."

The aroma made Vivian's stomach growl unexpectedly.

She frowned at her unusual appetite.

Normally she ate one dumpling at most. Today she devoured three plus a large bowl of congee.

"Master, are you..." Finn's eyes widened. "Pregnant?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Vivian nearly choked on her congee.

Setting down the bowl, she fixed him with a sharp glare. "What did you put in my water last night?"

"Just regular fruit tea." Finn looked innocent. "The peels are still in the kitchen trash."

Vivian's cheeks flushed.

She remembered last night's kiss—how she hadn't pushed Ethan away when his lips met hers.

"Your face is red. Fever?" Finn reached for her forehead.

"I'm fine!"

Swatting his hand away, Vivian went to change.

She needed to see Isabella Langley today.

DarkKingdom operatives might already be hunting for Zero. The Dark Web investigation progress remained unknown.

She couldn't let Lucas Lefèvre or Isabella get dragged into this.

"Isabella, free for a chat?" Vivian dialed her phone.

"Well, if it isn't Miss Laurent finally remembering me." Isabella's amused voice came through.

Thirty minutes later, Vivian stood outside the CEO's office at Langley Group.

Isabella looked up from her computer, arching a brow. "What an honor."

"Routine inspection." Vivian closed the door. "Checking if the CEO's hiding any mistresses."

"No mistresses." Isabella approached with a smirk. "But I'd make an exception for you."

Leaning close, she whispered, "Had fun with Ethan last night?"

Vivian's ears burned. "You were spying on me?"

"Wouldn't dare." Isabella stepped back, grinning. "But your neck tells quite the story."

Vivian's hand flew to her neck as her heart skipped a beat.
###Chapter 527 

Isabella Langley reclined on the sofa, her fingertips lightly tapping the edge of her laptop.

"Want to compare who has a better figure?" She suddenly arched a brow at Vivian Laurent.

Vivian nearly choked on her water. "Pass. I have zero interest in that kind of competition."

The two exchanged a smile, the tension easing slightly.

Isabella turned the laptop toward Vivian. "The organization has been unusually quiet."

The screen displayed the latest intelligence summary.

"Zero was captured, the Dark Web prison was raided—yet they haven't made a single move." Isabella narrowed her eyes. "This isn't normal."

Vivian quickly scanned the data. "It is suspicious."

"But there's a girl named Annika making waves." Isabella pulled up a file. "She's been searching for Zero relentlessly."

The photo showed a young girl with a stubborn glint in her eyes.

Vivian shook her head. "I've never seen her before."

"She reminds me of you back in the day." Isabella said meaningfully. "Wonder if Zero will tell her the truth."

Vivian closed the laptop. "That's his choice to make."

The Dark Web had launched a full investigation, releasing some surveillance footage. But the masked woman in the footage was too blurry to identify.

"We need to interfere with their investigation." Vivian opened the Dark Web forum.

The page was flooded with wild theories and misinformation. Some even claimed the witness was a blonde foreigner.

"Someone's muddying the waters." Vivian immediately sensed something off.

Isabella leaned closer. "Who would help you? Zero can't even touch a computer right now."

They exchanged a glance, both seeing the same question in each other's eyes.

At the top-floor office of Roscente Group, Ethan Roscente's fingers flew across the keyboard as Dark Web pages refreshed rapidly on his screen.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Come in." He didn't look up.

Simon Eisner entered with two guests. "Mr. Roscente, Mr. Valdemar and Mr. Alpinus are here."

Felix Valdemar strode forward. "Surprise?"

Ethan finally glanced up. "Why are you two together?"

"Ran into each other by chance." Patrick Alpinus grinned. "Drinks tonight?"

"I have plans with my son." Ethan declined flatly.

Felix clutched his chest dramatically. "Three years, and you still only have eyes for that kid!"

Ethan smirked. "Or maybe you just want an excuse to party?"

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the sunset painted the city in gold. No one knew the man in this office was secretly stirring the currents beneath the Dark Web's surface.
###Chapter 528

Felix Valdemar lounged lazily on the sofa. "Patrick rarely comes back. We should show him a good time."

Ethan Roscente kept his eyes on the laptop screen, responding indifferently. "Hmm."

Patrick Alpinus leaned over and frowned at the Dark Web content on Ethan's screen. "Since when did you take interest in this?"

"Just browsing," Ethan replied calmly.

Patrick scrolled through the latest updates. "Are these sources reliable? I've never heard of them."

"Fake," Ethan stated decisively.

Patrick eyed him suspiciously. "How can you be so sure?" His eyes suddenly widened. "Wait... did you plant these false leads?"

Ethan remained silent.

"Why would you do that?" Patrick pressed. "Do you know who broke Liam out?"

Felix looked baffled. "What are you two talking about?"

Ethan closed the laptop. "Nothing worth discussing."

But Patrick persisted. "I already have a suspect."

Ethan tensed. "Who?"

"Shadow," Patrick whispered. "This whole operation reeks of his style. Only Shadow could extract Liam without leaving a trace."

"But Shadow vanished over four years ago. Rumor says he's dead." Patrick rubbed his chin. "Still, I can't think of anyone else capable of this."

Ethan suddenly asked, "When exactly did Shadow disappear?"

"Four and a half years ago," Patrick recalled. "Vanished mid-mission."

The timeline made Ethan's pupils constrict.

Memories of that rainy night flooded back—when he'd found Vivian Laurent drenched and unconscious on a foreign street. Doctors said she suffered from severe malnutrition, her body frighteningly frail.

Background checks showed she was just a discarded heiress. Out of pity, he'd brought her home.

Now, the coincidences sent chills down his spine.
###Chapter 529

Within just one month, Vivian Laurent's body swelled drastically. Pus-filled boils erupted across her face, far more severe than ordinary acne.

The angry red blemishes soon covered her entire visage, making her look as though she'd been scorched by flames.

Three months later, Vivian had ballooned like an overinflated beach ball. Ethan Roscente knew she didn't eat much, yet her weight gain remained inexplicable.

He'd never harbored special feelings for Vivian. The Roscente family could easily afford to keep an idle person around. Besides, she managed to charm the elderly matriarch.

But Vivian's persistent lovestruck gazes irritated him. The old lady's constant matchmaking attempts only fueled his annoyance.

Then tragedy struck without warning. His elder brother died suddenly. While rushing to the airport, Ethan suffered a horrific car crash that left both legs severely injured.

Doctors declared he'd never walk again.

Sophia Evans had always shown interest in him. Yet when faced with a crippled Ethan, she couldn't even bother to visit. During those dark days, only Vivian remained steadfast by his hospital bed.

His temper raged like wildfire. He smashed objects and hurled insults, cycling through countless nurses. Vivian alone endured his fury without complaint, caring for him tirelessly for six months.

To be precise - she healed him for six months. When he finally stood again, his first act was investigating his brother's death. Sophia was nearing childbirth, the matriarch lay dying, and everything converged at once.

With her final breath, the old woman clutched Ethan's hand, demanding he marry Vivian. He couldn't refuse a dying wish.

He flew overseas immediately after the wedding. Upon returning, their third anniversary coincided with divorce day.

Now calculating, exactly four and a half years had passed since their first meeting until the divorce. This timeline matched Shadow's disappearance date perfectly.

Considering Vivian's astonishing hidden identities, Ethan felt certain she was Shadow.

"Boss Ethan?" Felix Valdemar waved a hand before his dazed eyes. "You spacing out?"

Ethan blinked, residual shock lingering in his gaze. "Nothing."

He'd simply pieced together the puzzle. Their seemingly coincidental meetings might have been fate all along.

How fortunate he'd encountered Shadow when she lay injured during a mission. Yet why had Vivian suddenly gained weight? This mystery remained unsolved.

Ethan burned to confront Vivian immediately but restrained himself. He relished this gradual unveiling of her secrets.

Each discovered identity felt like unearthing priceless treasure. He eagerly anticipated meeting more hidden versions of Vivian Laurent.
###Chapter 530

Ethan Roscente set down his coffee cup with a sharp clink against the glass table.

"I've faced that woman before. She was formidable. Pity she's gone now."

Ethan's fingers tapped rhythmically on the table. His voice turned glacial. "Who said she's dead?"

Patrick Alpinus adjusted his glasses. "The person who appeared recently does resemble Shadow. But the Dark Web has launched an investigation. That's dangerous for her."

Only one word registered in Ethan's mind—danger. His knuckles whitened, brows furrowing.

Vivian Laurent was in trouble. Those people wouldn't let her go.

He stood abruptly, his chair screeching across the floor.

Felix Valdemar blinked. "Where are you going?"

"Business." Ethan snatched his car keys and strode out.

Patrick and Felix exchanged glances. "What's gotten into him lately?" Patrick muttered.

"Who knows," Felix shrugged.

Tires screeched as Ethan's car halted outside the hospital. He marched inside, only to learn Vivian hadn't come to work today.

As he turned to leave, his gaze landed on the VIP ward.

Ten minutes later, he stood outside a hospital room holding a fruit basket. Without waiting for permission, he pushed the door open.

Liam Valdemar reclined against the pillows, reading. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across his pale face.

"Wrong room?" Liam's voice was feather-light.

Ethan placed the basket on the nightstand. "No mistake." His eyes were blades.

Liam closed his book. "I don't know you."

"I'm Vivian Laurent's husband."

A smirk. "She only mentioned having a useless ex."

Their gazes clashed like crossed swords. The room temperature seemed to plummet.

Ethan noted Liam's frail appearance belied eyes sharp as poisoned daggers. "Certain people bring her danger," he said lowly. "I won't stand by."

Liam's fingers traced the book's spine. "You worry too much, Mr. Roscente." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "I can protect her."

"Can you?" Ethan's laugh was icy. "A man who can't even protect himself."

Liam's expression darkened. The air between them turned to frost.

Ethan leaned down, his whisper a lethal promise at Liam's ear: "Stay away from her. Or else—" The unspoken threat hung heavy.

Liam tilted his head, lips curling dangerously. "Mr. Roscente, that's my line."

Their eyes locked again—sparks flying, tension crackling.
###Chapter 531

Zero was the first to look away.

"Does Vivian know you're here to see me?"

Ethan Roscente smirked coldly. "You're a grown man. Don't tell me you're planning to tattle?"

"If you're that pathetic, go ahead and call her right now."

He was betting this man called Zero wouldn't make that call.

Zero remained expressionless. "You're overthinking it. I was just curious about your purpose."

He had done his research on Ethan Roscente and knew he was a formidable opponent.

Now wasn't the time to stir up trouble.

"Stay away from Vivian." Ethan cut straight to the point. "Don't drag her into danger."

Pulling Vivian into something this risky—this man clearly had ulterior motives.

Zero's lips curved slightly. "I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you."

"Vivian doesn't belong to anyone right now."

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

Was this a declaration of war?

"She'll always be mine." Ethan's voice was steel.

After leaving the hospital, Ethan headed straight to Vivian's home.

Only to find it empty.

He remembered his little spy.

"Theo, ask your sister where she is."

Theo replied quickly: "Sis is at Langley Tower!"

Ethan immediately turned his car around.

Top floor of Langley Tower.

Isabella Langley watched Vivian smile at her phone. "Who's making you so happy?"

"A little friend."

"Since when did you like kids?"

Vivian's eyes curved into crescents. "He's adorable—like a little mochi ball."

Isabella teased, "If you like them so much, why not have one yourself?"

"Hard pass." Vivian waved her hands dismissively. "Other people's kids are cute enough."

Becoming a mother? Just the thought made her scalp prickle.
###Chapter 532

"Having children is indeed troublesome," Isabella Langley swirled her wine glass. "But I plan to skip marriage and just find a high-quality sperm donor. It'd be a waste not to pass on my excellent genes. You should consider it too, Vivian."

She had always been unconventional—men were optional, but children were non-negotiable.

Vivian Laurent shook her head. Childhood trauma had convinced her that bringing a child into loveless circumstances was worse than having none at all.

"I've never wanted children. Probably never will."

Motherhood had never featured in her life plans. Even during her three-year marriage to Ethan Roscente, she'd taken extreme precautions. An unwanted child would only relive her own painful history.

Isabella sighed. "Accidents happen."

"Not to me." Vivian's tone was final.

She lived with military precision. Aside from two reckless nights with Ethan, she'd never slipped up.

"Ugh!" Isabella made a face. "This lemonade's been steeping too long—it's unbearably sour!"

Vivian had swapped their coffee order for lemon water, which now tasted like battery acid.

Vivian took a sip. "Tastes fine to me."

Perhaps the tartness stimulated her appetite. She suddenly felt ravenous.

"Lunch? What are you craving?"

"Perfect timing." Isabella's eyes lit up. "Let's hit Nightfall Lounge tonight. Life's been so dull lately."

"The lounge?"

"Obviously! With your figure, it's criminal to keep it hidden. I'd wear crop tops daily if I were you."

Vivian chuckled. "Says the woman who looks like a succubus. Let's go—I'm starving."

They stepped out of the elevator and collided with Ethan Roscente.

"Vivian." His gaze burned into her.

Her pulse jumped. "Are you following me?"

"Client meeting." His expression remained neutral. "Just finished. Where are you—"

"Not your business." She cut him off sharply.
###Chapter 533

"Let's go." Vivian Laurent gripped Isabella Langley's wrist and strode away.

Ethan Roscente remained frozen in place, his outstretched hand hovering midair.

His fingers trembled slightly as he watched Vivian's retreating figure.

Memories from three years ago flooded back—when he'd pushed her away instead of holding her close.

Now even a glance from her felt like an impossible luxury.

......

Isabella turned the steering wheel, casting a sidelong glance at Vivian in the passenger seat.

"Lost in thought?" she teased. "Thinking about Ethan?"

Vivian pulled her gaze from the window.

"Why would I?" Her lips twisted wryly. "I'd rather decide what to order for dinner."

Isabella arched a brow. "Drinks tonight?"

"Sure." Vivian answered without hesitation.

She needed alcohol to numb the storm of emotions.

"I'll book VIP seating." Isabella winked. "Might meet some eye candy."

A thought struck her. "Invite your friend too?"

Vivian hesitated. "He's still recovering..."

"Hospital rooms are depressing." Isabella shrugged. "He can sip juice."

Vivian pulled out her phone. "I'll ask Liam."

Liam replied instantly. He'd been itching to escape the sterile hospital walls and jumped at the chance to join Vivian.

Isabella also invited Emily and Erin, planning a lively evening.

......

When Ethan pushed open his office door, Felix Valdemar and Patrick Alpinus were sipping tea.

"Boss?" Felix's eyes widened at Ethan's expression. "You look—"

"Fine." Ethan loosened his tie.

Felix whispered to Patrick, "He definitely saw Vivian."

"Vivian?" Patrick frowned.

"His ex-wife." Felix lowered his voice. "Used to ignore her, now regrets it. Tell me he doesn't have—"

Patrick cleared his throat to cut him off.

As night fell, the trio arrived at the bar entrance—Isabella's territory where Ethan was persona non grata.

Felix produced three face masks. "Wear these."

Strobe lights pulsed inside, bass thundering through the walls.

"Upstairs booth." Felix gestured.

Ethan froze mid-step.

His gaze locked onto a distant figure, pupils contracting sharply.
###Chapter 534

"What are you looking at?" Felix Valdemar followed Blake Roland's gaze, which had landed on Isabella Langley.

"Holy shit! What are the odds? Let's find another bar." Felix immediately hid behind the menu.

This was Isabella's territory. If she spotted them, they'd get kicked out instantly.

He turned to leave when Ethan Roscente grabbed his arm. "We're staying."

Felix groaned.

Boss Ethan and Vivian Laurent—those two just couldn't escape each other no matter where they went.

Before Felix could protest, Ethan was already striding toward the VIP booth like he wanted Vivian to notice him.

Patrick Alpinus tugged Felix's sleeve. "What's going on?"

Felix jerked his chin toward the center of the room. "See the most stunning woman there? That's Boss Ethan's ex-wife."

Patrick squinted. The radiant woman stood out like a diamond among pebbles, her dazzling smile lighting up the room.

His breath caught. "I thought Mrs. Roscente was supposed to be overweight and plain?"

The graceful figure before them completely contradicted the rumors.

"Your intel's outdated." Felix suddenly ducked. "Shit, Isabella's looking this way! Cover me, man!"

"Felix, you mutt!" Isabella's heels clicked across the floor.

The nickname had stuck ever since she'd first coined it.

"Isabella! Have some decency—we're in public!" Felix bristled like a cat.

"Since when do you deserve decency? Manager! Throw these men out!"

Patrick arched an eyebrow. "History?"

"That woman's insane," Felix hissed. "I suggest we retreat immediately."

"Who's insane?" Isabella's laugh was icy. "Birds of a feather—anyone associated with Ethan Roscente is trash. Get out!"

She never played favorites, especially with Ethan's friends. One sighting meant instant expulsion.

Felix suddenly bolted toward the booth. "Vivian, save me!"

Vivian had frozen at Ethan's appearance. The shout snapped her out of it.

Felix hid behind her. "Your friend here runs a business but kicks out paying customers. What kind of hospitality is that?"

His gaze slid to Vivian's new companions. "Making friends? Why not join us? The more the merrier."

He emphasized "Vivian" loudly enough for the entire bar to hear.

Felix subtly elbowed Ethan. This was his golden opportunity to help his boss.
###Chapter 535

Ethan Roscente's gaze locked onto Vivian Laurent.

And the man beside her.

A thirty-something-year-old pretending to be an innocent boy in front of Vivian.

Disgusting.

"I don't mind," Ethan said coldly.

"I do!" Vivian snapped.

She studied him suspiciously.

Was this man stalking her again?

Otherwise, how could it be such a coincidence?

"If you like this spot, Mr. Roscente, we'll move to a private room." Vivian grabbed Liam's arm to leave.

"Unnecessary." Ethan turned toward the neighboring booth.

But his eyes never left Vivian.

Liam subtly pulled her closer.

"That man just now—"

"Not familiar," Vivian cut him off.

The corner of Liam's mouth lifted.

He speared a piece of strawberry cake and brought it to Vivian's lips.

She almost refused.

Then she felt Ethan's burning stare.

Against her better judgment, she took the bite.

The glass in Ethan's hand cracked under the pressure.

Veins bulged on the back of his hand.

Liam pretended not to notice and continued feeding her.

"Even back in the organization, you were always popular."

"Now that you've left, you've made even more friends."

"Shadow, I'm truly happy for you."

He deliberately raised his voice.

Just to make sure that man knew—

He was history.

"Thank you, Zero."

Vivian smiled sincerely.

Her appetite had been unusually good lately.

She accepted every morsel Liam offered.

Ethan's eyes turned bloodshot.

This man was clearly provoking him.

First Dominic Atlante.

Now this one.

He yanked out his phone.

"Theo, find a way to get her out of here."

Theo replied instantly: "On it!"

Moments later, Vivian's phone buzzed.

"Big sis, I miss you so much."

"Can I come see you?"

Vivian frowned at the message.

"Not a good time, sweetheart."

Theo sent a voice message next.

His voice quivered: "But I'm so scared home alone."

"Mom's overseas, and I don't have a dad."

"Uncle Victor isn't here either..."

Vivian's heart clenched.

This child was an orphan?

No wonder he kept mentioning his uncle.

She hesitated, glancing at Liam.

Liam set down his fork gently.

"Something wrong?"

Vivian nodded guiltily.

"There's a child who needs me."

Liam ruffled her hair affectionately.

"Go ahead."

Ethan watched from afar.

He nearly shattered his second glass.
###Chapter 536

Vivian was about to text Isabella that she would leave first.

The private dining room door suddenly swung open.

Sophia Sherwood strode in on ten-centimeter heels, scanning the room with her eyes.

She had deliberately done up her face with heavy club makeup - winged eyeliner and fiery red lips.

"Ethan, what a coincidence."

Sophia walked straight toward Ethan Roscente, her short skirt swaying to reveal generous glimpses of pale thighs.

Felix's eyes lit up. "Sophia! You're joining us?"

"Supposed to meet girlfriends." She flipped her long hair. "Got stood up."

Her gaze flickered pointedly toward Vivian.

Vivian smirked. "Finished your neurology follow-up?"

Sophia's face stiffened.

"Dr. Laurent remains as sharp-tongued as ever." She swayed her hips to sit beside Ethan. "You don't mind, do you Ethan?"

Ethan gave an absentminded grunt.

His peripheral vision stayed locked on Vivian.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Felix, your goddess just sat in your lap."

Felix actually scooted over. "What'll you drink, Sophia?"

"Whatever Ethan's having." She deliberately leaned closer to Ethan.

Ethan abruptly stood.

"Excuse me."

Sophia's smile froze.

Vivian kept scrolling through her phone, lips curling slightly.

Isabella leaned in. "Some people's 'chance encounters' are so poorly staged."

Sophia's grip tightened around her glass.

Tonight, she would make Ethan see this woman's true colors.
###Chapter 537

Sophia Sherwood held her wine glass with a saccharine smile.

"Ethan, let's have a drink? It's rare for old classmates to reunite. Surely you won't deny me this?"

Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness, laced with calculated coyness.

Ethan Roscente's gaze remained fixed across the room where Vivian Laurent leaned close to Liam Valdemar, engrossed in private conversation. Their proximity made his jaw clench.

Crack—

The crystal stemware shattered in his grip.

Amber liquid splattered across his tailored suit.

"I need the restroom." He rose abruptly, his expression glacial.

Felix Valdemar blinked. "What's with Boss Ethan—"

Cold water slapped against Ethan's face in the restroom, doing little to douse the fire in his veins.

Meanwhile, Liam's lips curved into a foxlike smirk as he murmured to Vivian, "This cocktail has... distinctive notes."

She tilted closer to catch his words.

"House specialty. Unavailable elsewhere," she explained.

Liam took a measured sip. "Quite remarkable."

"One glass only. Doctor's orders." Vivian leveled him a stern look.

"At your command, Dr. Laurent." His voice dropped to an intimate timbre that pinkened her ears.

"Purely medical advice," she insisted.

Sophia's manicured nails dug into her palms as she witnessed their exchange.

Striding toward their table on stiletto heels, she forced a smile. "Dr. Laurent, what a coincidence. Join me for a drink?"

Isabella Langley's brow furrowed instantly.

"Get lost." Her retort came sharp as a scalpel.

Sophia clutched her pearls. "Such rudeness!"

"Allergic to fake sweetness. Makes me nauseous." Isabella's smirk was venomous.

Felix rushed to intervene. "Ignore her, goddess. She's—"

Isabella seized his ear in a vice grip.

"Who exactly is 'her'?" she hissed.

"Ow! Mercy!" He flailed, his hand accidentally grazing her cheek.

Both froze.

Isabella released him. Felix scrambled backward like a startled hare.

"Come back here!" She gave chase.

The lounge erupted into chaos.
###Chapter 538

The bar was bathed in dim, flickering lights with deafening music pounding through the air.

Sophia Sherwood held her glass, taunting Vivian Laurent with a smirk. "What's the matter, Dr. Laurent? Too scared to play a simple game?"

Vivian glanced at the dice on the table, her lips curling into a cold smile. "I'm more concerned about how humiliating your loss will be."

Sophia's expression darkened.

"Let me guess," Vivian swirled her drink lazily. "Planning to run crying to Ethan Roscente when you lose?"

Sophia tightened her grip on the glass. "How dare you!"

"Move." Vivian had no patience for this.

Sophia blocked her path. "Stop acting so high and mighty, Vivian. Stringing Ethan along while flirting with other men—how pathetic."

Liam Valdemar's gaze turned icy.

Vivian suddenly smiled. "I suddenly feel like hitting someone."

"What—"

Slap!

The sharp sound of the blow echoed through the bar.

Sophia clutched her cheek, shrieking. "You're insane!"

"Insane?" Vivian picked up her glass and splashed the contents onto Sophia's face. "This is just the beginning."

Alcohol dripped down Sophia's meticulously applied makeup.

"Should I tell everyone about your plastic surgery?" Vivian spoke slowly, deliberately. "The chin implant five years ago, the cheekbone reconstruction three years ago, and—"

Sophia paled. "You're lying!"

"Would you like me to forward your medical records to your company group chat?" Vivian tilted her phone mockingly.

Sophia trembled violently.

Her most guarded secret had just been exposed in the cruelest way possible.
###Chapter 539

You've Misjudged Me

Ethan Roscente stepped out of the restroom to find Sophia Sherwood hastily smoothing her disheveled hair.

The moment she spotted him, her expression melted into pitiful vulnerability.

"Ethan, I just wanted to chat with Dr. Laurent... but she—"

Vivian Laurent didn't even grace her with a glance.

"Zero, I'm leaving." She grabbed her purse. "Tell Isabella."

Ethan ignored Sophia completely, striding after Vivian.

"Vivian!"

In the parking lot, he caught her wrist just as she reached for her car door.

"Ouch—" She winced, shaking him off.

"There's nothing between us," Ethan insisted urgently. "If it bothers you, I'll fire her tomorrow."

"Do whatever you want."

"Where are you going? Let me drive you."

Vivian scoffed. "Go comfort your dear friend."

"What friend?" He practically shoved her into the passenger seat. "You're the only woman I see."

As he leaned over to buckle her seatbelt, the faint scent of alcohol lingered on her.

"Address?"

She gave a residential name—Theo's suggested location, not far from the Roscente estate.

Once the car started moving, Ethan couldn't resist asking, "Who was that man earlier?"

"None of your business."

"The way he looked at you—"

Vivian's stomach suddenly churned.

"Worry about yourself," she pressed fingers to her temple. "Before another love child appears."

Ethan slammed the brakes.

"You've misjudged me completely."

"Really?" Her lips curled sarcastically. "Then explain Miss Sherwood."

"She's just—"

"Just what?" Vivian cut him off. "The great Mr. Roscente never lacks women throwing themselves at him."

His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "You know exactly who's in my heart."

She turned toward the window.

"That man—"

"My senior colleague." Impatience edged her voice. "Far more reliable than you."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"Stay away from him."

"Or what?"

"Because—" He suddenly closed the distance between them. "You're the mother of my child."

"Ethan Roscente!" She shoved him hard.

"Watch out!"

A truck barreled toward them from the side. Ethan swerved violently, the car lurching.

Vivian crashed against his chest.

Amid screeching tires, she heard the steady, thunderous rhythm of his heartbeat.
###Chapter 540

"You've got it wrong. We're just colleagues," Ethan Roscente explained, suddenly smirking. "That tone of yours... are you jealous?"

"Jealous?" Vivian Laurent opened her mouth to retort when a wave of nausea hit her.

She slapped Ethan's arm urgently. "Pull over! Now!"

"What's wrong?" He frowned. "Don't want to be near me?"

"If you don't stop this car, I'll vomit all over you!" Vivian clutched her mouth, face pale.

Ethan slammed the brakes. The moment the car stopped, Vivian bolted out toward a roadside trash bin.

Grabbing a water bottle, Ethan followed. He gently patted her back. "Vivian, what's wrong?"

She retched violently while Ethan waited patiently beside her.

When Vivian finally straightened, he immediately offered water. "Rinse your mouth."

"Should we go to the hospital?" Concern laced his voice.

Vivian shook her head. She'd barely drunk any alcohol tonight—why this sudden sickness?

"Maybe the empty stomach plus car motion," she said weakly.

"You never take care of yourself." Ethan's brow furrowed. "Just like when you brushed off your injury days ago."

"I'm a doctor. I know my limits." Vivian wiped her lips. "Go ahead. I need some space."

"No." His refusal was absolute. "What do you want to eat? I'll take you."

Vivian waved him off. Food was the last thing on her mind.

Remembering Theo at home, she hesitated. "Actually... could you do me a favor?"

Ethan's eyes brightened. "Name it."

"There's a child home alone. His mother's abroad, and his uncle's unreliable." Vivian bit her lip. "Could you check on him?"

Ethan stiffened. So her urgency was about Theo.

"That boy means a lot to you?" he probed.

"Of course." Vivian pulled out her phone. "I'll text him that an uncle's coming."

Ethan discreetly sent a message too. Soon, Vivian frowned at her screen.

"That's odd," she murmured. "Theo says his parent just returned."

Ethan exhaled silently in relief.
###Chapter 541 

Vivian grabbed Ethan's sleeve. "Don't go. That unreliable uncle of yours seems to have already left."

Ethan's lips twitched.

Unreliable?

"Perhaps he had an emergency," Ethan defended himself.

"What could be more important than a child?" Vivian frowned. "Someone so irresponsible doesn't deserve to care for children!"

Ethan listened quietly, letting her vent.

When she finished, he asked softly, "Should I take you to the hospital now?"

"It's too late." She yawned. "I just want to go home and sleep."

Ethan still hesitated. "At least a quick check-up?"

"I'm a doctor," Vivian glared. "Are you questioning my judgment?"

"Wouldn't dare." He surrendered immediately.

His voice softened. "Then let me drive you home. I'll make some porridge for you."

Too tired to argue, Vivian leaned back and closed her eyes.

Ethan slowed the car to a crawl.

But soon, Vivian's brows furrowed again.

He pulled over at once.

"Get out," he said, opening his door first.

Vivian blinked. "You're abandoning me here?"

With a sigh, Ethan knelt before her, turning his back.

"Climb on."

Vivian froze.

His broad silhouette looked exceptionally dependable under the streetlamp.

"The car isn't comfortable. I'll carry you," he murmured.

"That's not—"

"Be good."

After a pause, she relented and wrapped her arms around his shoulders.

Ethan secured her gently, rising with care.

"Tell me if you feel unwell."

He couldn't bear seeing her uncomfortable—even slightly.

Their elongated shadows stretched beneath the amber glow.

The distance wasn't short, but Ethan walked steadily.

He wished the journey could last longer.

Over an hour later, they finally arrived home.

Vivian had fallen asleep against his back.

Seeing the new lock, Ethan hesitated to wake her.

He called Finn.

"Open up," Ethan whispered.

Finn remained wary until hearing his master was drunk, then hurried downstairs.
###Chapter 542
Throwing Up Again

"What's wrong with Master?" Finn whispered.

Ethan pressed a finger to his lips, adjusting Vivian's weight on his back.

Finn tiptoed after them, muttering, "Did you knock her out?"

"She's drunk," Ethan replied in a hushed tone.

Finn's eyes widened. His master had always been able to hold her liquor—how could she be drunk tonight?

Ethan carefully laid Vivian on the bed before heading to the bathroom for a warm towel.

His fingers lingered on her furrowed brow as he gently wiped her face.

From the doorway, Finn watched Ethan's focused profile. The man's usually sharp gaze was now filled with tenderness.

In the kitchen, Ethan frowned at his phone screen. He pulled out a bag of rice and began washing it, following the online instructions.

Once the water boiled, he added the rice, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.

The rich aroma of congee soon filled the air. He had someone deliver light side dishes to accompany it.

At 2 AM, Vivian woke with a churning stomach.

She staggered downstairs, leaning against the wall, drawn by the savory scent.

"Finn?" she croaked.

Ethan peered out from the kitchen. "Awake?"

Vivian froze. "Why are you still here?"

"Made congee." He wiped his hands. "Want some?"

She eyed him suspiciously. "Did you poison it?"

Without a word, Ethan served two bowls, tasting every dish first.

Vivian scooped a spoonful—perfectly warm. When she picked up a shrimp, Ethan immediately peeled it for her.

The moment the shrimp touched her tongue, Vivian's face contorted.

She clapped a hand over her mouth, rushing to the bathroom to retch.

Ethan followed, rubbing her back. "Let's get you to the hospital."

"The shrimp was bad," Vivian rasped after rinsing her mouth, her face pale.

Ethan sampled the remaining shrimp. "It's fresh."

Vivian managed half a bowl before pushing it away. Ethan's brow furrowed at her pallor.

"I'm fine." She waved him off. "Go home—Theo's alone."

Ethan hesitated, but ultimately left after a few parting instructions.
###Chapter 543

Sophia Sherwood clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. She had never suffered such humiliation before. The wine stains covering her dress made her want to disappear.

Ethan Roscente's departure stripped away her last reason to stay.

"Felix, I'm leaving." She forced herself to maintain some dignity.

Felix Valdemar hesitated. "Let me drive you."

He'd witnessed Sophia's entire confrontation with Vivian Laurent. That woman, who resembled Isabella Langley so much, was never one to be trifled with.

"No need."

Sophia turned on her heel without looking back. The sharp clicks of her heels echoed across the marble floor.

In the corner, Liam Valdemar lifted his gaze. His eyes cut through Sophia's retreating figure like blades. He stood up soundlessly.

"Liam?" Isabella called out.

As Vivian's friend, she felt responsible for this silent man. Even though he was the notorious top agent everyone feared.

"Returning to the hospital." His reply was curt.

"Want a ride?"

"No trouble." His refusal was absolute. "Taxi's faster."

Isabella reconsidered. With Liam's skills, he hardly needed protection. "Text me when you arrive."

Liam nodded. As he turned, a cold glint flashed in his eyes.

That woman dared disrespect Shadow.

The palm pistol in his sleeve was already loaded. Before coming to Canada, he'd stashed weapons in multiple safe houses.

Sophia remained oblivious. As she pulled open her car door, Liam's gun sight locked onto her back.

Only 0.3 seconds needed.

"Sophia!"

Felix's voice shattered the silence. He hurried over with her forgotten clutch. "Your bag."

"Thanks."

The interruption forced Liam to stand down. He narrowed his eyes in displeasure and melted back into the shadows.

Sophia started her engine and sped away, unaware she'd just escaped death's door.

Liam holstered his weapon. She got lucky this time.

As Felix turned back toward the bar, he heard Isabella's mocking laugh. "Pathetic simp."
###Chapter 544

"Isabella Langley, who the hell are you insulting?"

"I didn't name anyone. Why are you so eager to claim it?" Isabella arched an eyebrow defiantly.

Felix Valdemar's expression darkened. "You were clearly talking about me."

"So what if I was?" She scoffed. "Haven't I insulted you enough? I just can't stand your disgusting behavior."

"What behavior?" He took a step closer. "Who I spend time with is none of your business. Why do you care so much?" A mocking smirk twisted his lips. "Are you jealous? Could it be...you actually like me?"

"Ugh!" Isabella recoiled in disgust. "Like you? In your dreams! I'd rather fall for a stray dog than waste my time on you!"

Her words stabbed through Felix like shards of glass. What was so wrong with him? Why did she despise him this much?

"Good." He turned away coldly.

They both snorted in unison, deliberately avoiding each other's gaze.

Felix returned to his seat and downed glass after glass of liquor, but the alcohol only fueled his irritation.

On the dance floor, Isabella swayed with a handsome partner, her laughter bright and movements uninhibited.

Felix glared at the infuriating sight and drained another shot.

"What's your deal with her?" Patrick Alpinus asked suddenly.

"Who?"

"The one dancing."

"Don't know her." Felix's reply was clipped.

"You don't know her, yet you can't take your eyes off her? They're practically glued to her body."

Felix finally tore his gaze away. "I was looking at someone else! This place is full of beautiful women. Why focus on her? That woman is completely unreasonable!"

He launched into a rant, listing every single one of Isabella's supposed faults.

Patrick sipped his drink calmly, waiting until Felix finished before stating plainly, "You like her."

"Bullshit!" Felix bristled like a provoked animal. "How could I possibly like that lunatic? Look at Sophia Sherwood—now that's what a real goddess looks like!"

"Then why do you keep provoking Isabella?" Patrick's words struck true. "Like some schoolboy with a crush, too scared to admit it so you pick fights for attention."

"Fuck off!" Felix's face flushed crimson. "I'm warning you—don't spread that nonsense! Especially not where she might hear it. That woman would be insufferable if she knew!"

A faint smile touched Patrick's lips. When had Felix become so transparent?
###Chapter 545

The dance floor pulsed with hypnotic lights as Isabella Langley swayed in her stilettos to the rhythm. She'd just finished a sizzling tango with a handsome mixed-race stranger.

"Did I meet your standards, beautiful?" The man offered her a cocktail with a flirtatious smirk. "I've got an exquisite vintage at my penthouse. Care for a tasting?"

Isabella's crimson lips curved. "Intriguing proposal."

"Like hell!" Felix Valdemar shouldered between them. "You call those amateur moves seduction? Isabella, since when did your standards drop this low?"

She rolled her eyes. "Must you haunt me like a specter, Felix?"

"Call it protective instinct." He planted himself between them. "This playboy reeks of trouble."

Ignoring him, Isabella headed for the bar. A bespectacled executive promptly approached.

Before two sentences were exchanged, Felix materialized again. "Switching targets? This corporate predator's even worse."

"Enough!" Isabella slammed her glass down. "Since when do you police my conversations?"

"Saving damsels from poor choices." Felix crossed his arms.

The entire evening became a cycle—every man Isabella engaged with found Felix intruding. Finally, she stormed out in frustration.

Lucas Lefèvre and the others took their cue to leave.

Felix lingered, agitation coiling in his chest. He couldn't explain why seeing Isabella with other men unsettled him so deeply.

"Is she insane?" Felix muttered to Patrick Alpinus.

Patrick set down his whiskey. "The insanity's yours. I'm leaving."

Ethan Roscente's office at Roscente Group hummed with quiet efficiency.

Simon Eisner stood at attention. "You requested me, sir?"

"Report on Sophia Sherwood's performance." Ethan didn't look up from his documents.

"She proposed two initiatives without tangible results. However..." Simon hesitated.

"Continue."

"Her authoritarian approach has created team conflicts. Worse, she's implying...special relations with you. The rumor mill is spinning."

Ethan's jaw tightened. The thought of Vivian Laurent potentially hearing such gossip decided his course.

"Terminate her with legal severance. Find legitimate grounds." He shut the file. "I won't have her near this company again."

Some risks weren't worth keeping. Nothing could jeopardize what he had with Vivian.
###Chapter 546
Sophia Sherwood Gets Fired

Sophia Sherwood strode into the corporate building in her high heels.

Dark circles shadowed her eyes from a sleepless night.

"The director wants to see you," her assistant whispered.

Sophia lifted her chin and adjusted her collar. She'd always been confident in her professional abilities.

Pushing open the office door, she found the director standing by the window with his back turned.

"Sit," he said, facing her with a grim expression.

Sophia settled gracefully into the chair, red lips curving. "Is this about my promotion?"

The director slid a document across the desk. "The company is eliminating the manager position."

Her smile froze.

"What do you mean?" Her nails dug into her palms.

"The severance package is generous." He avoided her gaze. "Effective today, you're no longer employed here."

"On what grounds?" Sophia shot to her feet. "I demand to see Ethan!"

Her hands trembled as the elevator ascended to the top floor.

Simon Eisner blocked the CEO's office door. "Mr. Roscente isn't available."

"Move!" Sophia's voice turned shrill. "This is Vivian Laurent's doing, isn't it?"

Security dragged her away, her heels screeching against the polished floors.

Outside the hospital, four black-suited bodyguards barred her path.

"Ms. Sherwood, please leave," the lead guard said impassively.

Sophia's grip on her purse strap turned white-knuckled, her manicure threatening to puncture the leather.

The realization hit her—she wasn't even worthy of an audience with Vivian.

Inside her office, Vivian Laurent reviewed medical charts.

A video call notification popped up, revealing Fiona Grandelle's beaming face.

"Dr. Laurent!" The girl spun excitedly. "Look at my face!"

Vivian set down her pen with a warm smile. Fiona's skin now appeared flawless, the horrific scars completely vanished.

"Excellent recovery," Vivian said gently. "Remember to apply the ointment regularly."

"I'm flying to Canada next week!" Fiona's eyes sparkled. "I want to thank you and Dr. Fairsprene in person."

After ending the call, Vivian massaged her temples.

She remained oblivious to Sophia Sherwood watching from the café across the street.

Sophia's glare burned through the hospital's glass doors as her coffee cup creaked ominously in her grip.

"Vivian Laurent..." She ground out the name between clenched teeth. "This isn't over."
###Chapter 547

Vivian Laurent felt genuine joy witnessing Fiona Grandelle's transformation.

The timid girl who once feared mirrors now stood confidently in the sunlight. Vivian could almost see the brilliant future unfolding before her.

As they chatted, Queen Eleanor approached quietly.

"Dr. Luna, may we speak privately?"

Dismissing her attendants, the Queen handed over a document with grave expression.

"These are my prenatal test results. Please review them."

Vivian's fingers hesitated as she took the report. Multiple indicators exceeded normal ranges, indicating high pregnancy risks.

"Your Majesty, considering your age and physical condition—"

"I must have this child." The Queen interrupted, maternal determination flashing in her eyes. "This is heaven's gift to me."

Vivian sighed. "These abnormal readings mean immediate adjustments are necessary, otherwise—"

"I understand." The Queen clenched her dress hem. "My personal physicians are at their wits' end. That's why I came to you. Whatever the cost."

Seeing her resolve, Vivian relented.

"I'll coordinate medication plans with your doctors. But prepare yourself—the coming months will be difficult."

"Thank you!" The Queen exhaled in relief.

"Does Fiona know?"

"Not yet. The timing hasn't been right." The Queen's expression grew complicated.

Vivian didn't press further, carefully drafting a treatment regimen. The Queen promptly paid the consultation fee.

The payment arrived just in time.

Her previous savings had been transferred to Liam Valdemar. Though she didn't know his purpose, Vivian chose not to inquire. Now she could finally arrange post-discharge housing for him.

After settling Liam's accommodations, her bank account emptied again.

"Get me two contracts." She called Isabella Langley.

"You should rest." Isabella sounded concerned. "You've looked exhausted lately."

"Nonsense. I sleep eight hours daily."

"But your dark circles keep worsening..."

"Find me jobs or I'll poach Finn Deross's contracts." Vivian half-joked.

Hanging up, she massaged her temples. Fatigue had become frequent lately, but earning money took priority now.
###Chapter 548

"I'll handle this assignment." Isabella Langley readily accepted the task.

She swiftly rearranged Vivian Laurent's work schedule.

The mission location was overseas, and Vivian decided to properly say goodbye to Theo before departure.

Over time, Theo had become a warm presence in her life. Yet he always wore a mask during their meetings—she'd never seen his face.

Vivian wanted to treat him to a fancy meal, but he declined.

"Theo isn't hungry right now." The boy clearly worried about removing his mask to eat.

"Then how about we go have some fun?" Vivian suggested instead.

"Yes!"

His immediate answer melted her heart.

"You didn't even ask where we're going. Aren't you afraid I might kidnap you?"

"Anywhere is fun as long as I'm with you!"

His innocent words made her eyes sting with emotion.

Disneyland buzzed with excitement. Theo practically danced with joy upon entering.

"Sis, I want to ride that!" He pointed at the towering roller coaster.

Having spent most of his childhood in hospitals due to poor health, theme parks had been an impossible dream.

Vivian knelt to check his condition.

"The doctor said I can't ride..." His voice dripped with disappointment.

"But I am a doctor." She gently squeezed his small hand. "Your health is good now—you can ride."

"Really?" His eyes sparkled instantly.

"Have I ever lied to you?"

"You're the best!"

In Theo's heart, Vivian had now surpassed Ethan Roscente.

As the roller coaster zoomed by, Theo's screams blended with the wind. They rode the carousel and bumper cars until nightfall.

A black sedan waited silently at the park entrance.

"Sis, I have to go now." Theo clung to her reluctantly.

"Okay. We'll play again when I return from my trip."

"Promise!"

He bounded toward the car without mentioning Ethan sat in the backseat.

The one-way tinted window allowed Ethan to clearly see Vivian standing under the streetlamp. Her pale trench coat fluttered slightly in the evening breeze.

Vivian felt an intense gaze on her but saw nothing through the darkened glass.

"That's odd..." She murmured, watching the car drive away.
###Chapter 549 

The black sedan slowly pulled away. Ethan Roscente gazed through the window at the shrinking figure.

His knuckles turned white from gripping his fists too tightly. It wasn't the right time for a reunion yet, but he believed someday he could stand before Vivian Laurent openly.

"Uncle Ethan, I had so much fun today!" Theo Evans excitedly kicked his little legs in the backseat. "Aunt Vivian took me on the carousel and bought me cotton candy!"

A faint smile touched Ethan's lips. "Did she?"

"She was so gentle, always asking if I was tired." Theo counted on his fingers. "We even made plans to visit the aquarium together next time!"

Hearing the word "family," warmth spread through Ethan's chest. Since returning home, Theo had been smiling more often, gradually becoming less dependent on Sophia Evans.

"Uncle Ethan, Aunt Vivian is going on a business trip to the States tomorrow." Theo leaned forward conspiratorially. "For a whole week!"

Ethan's eyes flashed. He immediately sent a message to Simon Eisner.

The next day, Vivian boarded a flight to the States.

Her mission was to steal confidential files from a multinational CEO's phone. Intelligence indicated the target would host a private party at his villa that evening.

"Should we get an invitation?" Isabella Langley's voice came through the earpiece.

Vivian adjusted her wig in the mirror. "Too conspicuous. A server blends in better."

With practiced ease, she disguised herself as a mixed-race woman and infiltrated the waitstaff. Inside the lavish villa, no one noticed this "server" carrying champagne flutes.

The target stood surrounded by guests, his phone barely visible in his suit pocket. Vivian moved closer, planning to create an "accident" during his conversation.

The opportunity came.

A guest gestured animatedly with a wine glass while chatting. Vivian prepared to strike—

"Careful."

A pair of distinctive hands suddenly appeared, steadying the tilting glass.

Vivian's pupils contracted.

Those long, capable fingers wore a wristwatch glinting coldly under the lights. When she looked up, she nearly crushed her tray.

Ethan Roscente!

What was he doing here? Vivian gritted her teeth. Her entire plan was ruined. Worse, the man gave her that infuriating half-smile.

"Thank you." The oblivious guest took back his glass.

Ethan nodded slightly, but his gaze remained locked on Vivian. Those deep eyes seemed to say: Got you.
###Chapter 550

"Mr. Roscente, what a pleasant surprise!" Oscar Valence greeted warmly. "I didn't expect to see you at this gala."

Ethan Roscente stood rigid under the crystal chandelier, his cold gaze sweeping across the room.

"Just passing through."

Vivian Laurent's fingers tightened around her serving tray.

Why was he here?

She had meticulously altered her appearance—contouring her nose to appear taller, deepening her eye sockets, even darkening her skin to a sun-kissed tan. Even her closest colleagues might not recognize her now.

Yet Ethan's piercing stare lingered on her for a full second.

"A martini," he demanded abruptly.

Suppressing the urge to roll her eyes, Vivian turned to fetch the drink.

When she returned with the glass, Ethan frowned.

"I asked for a dry martini. Not this sweetened swill."

Her nails dug into her palms.

She fetched another.

"Where's the olive?" Ethan arched an eyebrow.

Oscar coughed awkwardly.

Taking a steadying breath, Vivian prepared a third attempt—this time carrying an entire tray of assorted cocktails.

Finally satisfied, Ethan selected one and took a slow sip.

"Mr. Valence," he swirled his glass, "I hear you're negotiating an arms deal?"

Vivian's pupils contracted.

That was precisely her mission tonight.

Ethan shot her a knowing glance before engaging Oscar in animated conversation.

Standing rigidly nearby, Vivian gritted her teeth so hard her molars ached.

Her fingers brushed against the powdered sedative in her pocket.

If this man insisted on interfering, she'd simply put him to sleep.

Ethan accepted the drugged drink, the rim already touching his lips.

A faint smirk curled Vivian's mouth.

Just as he was about to swallow—
###Chapter 551

Ethan Roscente raised his wine glass but paused before taking a sip.

His gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent's face, lips curling slightly.

"Why is this little maid staring at me so intently?"

Vivian turned her face away, fingers unconsciously twisting her skirt.

"Please drink quickly."

She prayed the drug would take effect soon.

Ethan suddenly pressed the glass to her lips.

"Perhaps you should taste it first?"

"No!" Vivian jerked backward.

She finally realized—he'd recognized her all along.

"Mr. Valence," Ethan turned, "your maid has quite the temper."

Oscar Valence narrowed his eyes. "Serve Mr. Roscente properly."

The glass tilted during their struggle.

Crimson liquid splashed across Oscar's expensive suit.

"My apologies," Ethan said carelessly. "I'll concede three percent in our deal."

Oscar's expression instantly brightened.

"I'll go change."

Vivian hurried after him. "Let me assist you."

While Oscar changed, she swiftly unlocked her phone.

A notification flashed—file transfer complete.

Mission accomplished.

Vivian exhaled, ready to disappear into the crowd.

Suddenly, commotion erupted downstairs.

"Stop that maid!"

Her pulse spiked.

A strong hand seized her wrist.

Ethan yanked her into a restroom, locking the door behind them.

"Let go!"

"Little liar," Ethan chuckled darkly.

His eyes trailed down her fitted maid's dress.

The outfit reminded him of that night.

The bunny hairclip. Fluffy tail. Blush-pinkened eyes.

Memories flooded back with startling clarity.

"What were you stealing this time?"

Vivian lashed out with a kick.

Ethan dodged effortlessly, pinning her against the wall.

"Feisty."
###Chapter 552

"I don't understand what you're talking about." Vivian Laurent pressed herself into the corner of the restroom, her heart pounding like a drum. She knew it was only a matter of time before she was discovered—she needed to escape quickly.

"Don't understand?" Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes, trapping her against the wall. "Those bodyguards outside aren't looking for you?"

"Of course not." Vivian turned her face away. "Has nothing to do with me."

She shoved at him. "Get away from me."

Ethan didn’t budge. "If they're not after you, why don’t we go out and let Oscar Valence take a look?"

Vivian bit her lower lip.

"Are you insane? Mind your own business."

Ethan smirked. "A little maid with such a temper. Surprising Oscar hasn’t fired you yet." He leaned closer, his breath brushing her ear. "How about working for me? Ten times your current salary."

"Not interested." She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

"Then what does interest you?" He inhaled deeply. "You smell incredible."

The familiar scent sent an unexpected tremor through him. It had been too long since he’d been this close to her.

"Pervert!" Vivian shuddered. "Let go or I’ll scream."

"Go ahead." His tone was indifferent. "Let them see how we're positioned right now."

She took a sharp breath and shoved him hard, trying to bolt.

Ethan caught her wrist in an iron grip, yanking her back against his chest.

"Ethan Roscente! Don’t push it!"

"So you do know me." His smirk deepened. "Planned this encounter, did you? I’ll give you one chance to explain."

"As if!" Vivian abandoned all pretense. "Are you stalking me?"

"Little maid, aren’t you full of yourself?" He arched a brow. "Do we know each other?"

"Stop playing dumb! You always ruin everything for me!"

She refused to believe he hadn’t recognized her.

"Ruin what?" Ethan pressed.

"None of your business!" She struggled. "Let’s pretend this never happened. Go our separate ways."

"Not a chance." His expression darkened abruptly. "Vivian, do you have any idea how dangerous Oscar Valence is?"

Hearing her name, her pupils contracted slightly.

"His danger level doesn’t concern me. I’m leaving."

"The place is swarming with bodyguards. How do you plan to escape?"

"That’s not your problem!" She gritted her teeth.

Her original plan had been simple—remove her disguise in the restroom and change into spare clothes hidden nearby. With enough time, she could’ve slipped over the perimeter wall.

But Ethan Roscente had to be her personal curse.

Not only was her operation compromised, but her identity was blown too.

Ethan was the living embodiment of her worst luck.
###Chapter 553

Ethan Roscente seized Vivian Laurent's wrist.

"I can help you."

Her pupils contracted. "You?"

He retrieved a black garment bag from the bathroom's hidden compartment.

"Change."

Vivian took the bag, her fingertips brushing against the silken fabric.

As she unzipped it, an obsidian evening gown cascaded out.

The dress mirrored the exact tailoring of Ethan's tuxedo.

"You knew I'd come?"

Ethan produced a makeup kit.

"Remove your disguise first."

Vivian stared at the makeup remover, suddenly understanding his plan.

She swiftly wiped away her prosthetic features, washing off the elaborate disguise with water.

The foundation brush glided across her face, transforming her into a sultry vision.

Pins removed, her curls tumbled down like a waterfall.

The mirror reflected a completely different woman.

"Turn around."

Ethan stood with his back to her.

The glass captured the silhouette of her curves.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he shut his eyes against the rising heat.

"Done."

Vivian tapped his shoulder lightly.

When he turned, Ethan's breath hitched.

The black gown accentuated her waist, her crimson lips burning like embers.

They stood before the mirror—twins of the night.

"Surveillance is handled."

He offered black gloves.

"Now you're my date."

Vivian slid them on, lips quirking.

"Looks like Zero's out of a job."

Ethan smirked.

"This is just the beginning."
###Chapter 554

The chandeliers of Oscar Valence's estate glittered like captured stars. Vivian Laurent glided through the crowd on Ethan Roscente's arm, her champagne-colored gown scattering diamond-like reflections across the ballroom.

"Mr. Roscente," Oscar blocked their path with a viper's smile. "Have you seen the maid who served me earlier?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Maid?"

"She stole confidential documents." Oscar's knuckles whitened around his glass. "I'll make her regret breathing."

Vivian's fingers twitched against Ethan's sleeve, though her crimson lips curved into flawless composure.

Ethan shifted subtly to shield her. "You must be mistaken."

Oscar's gaze crawled over Vivian. "And this is...?"

"My wife." Ethan's palm settled possessively at the small of her back, thumb tracing idle circles through the silk.

Vivian nearly cracked a molar.

"Married?" Oscar's drink sloshed.

"Four years." Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead. "She prefers privacy."

Her nails dug into his waist through the tuxedo fabric.

"Strange I've never seen Mrs. Roscente." Oscar's eyes narrowed.

"I reside in Switzerland." Vivian clung to Ethan's arm, stiletto heel grinding into his Oxfords. "Just visiting for this event."

Ethan's smile never wavered, though his breath hitched.

When Oscar finally retreated, Vivian wrenched free. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Security cameras." Ethan caught her wrist, nodding toward a blinking lens. "Play along."

An aide rushed to Oscar whispering, "Records confirm Mr. Roscente's marriage. The photos match this woman exactly."

"Find that damn maid!" Oscar snarled.

Beneath crystal pendants, Ethan caged Vivian against a marble column.

"Release me." Her whisper could frost glass.

"Ten more minutes." His lips brushed her ear, drawing a flush. "My wife is... distracting." His fingers traced her collarbone.

Vivian stomped on his polished shoe with lethal precision.
###Chapter 555

"Vivian, I love you."

Ethan Roscente's deep voice whispered beside her ear, making Vivian Laurent freeze instantly.

His proximity sent warm breath cascading over her skin, stealing her heartbeat for a fleeting moment.

She turned her face away. "Don't joke, Mr. Roscente. There's a line of people waiting to say that to me."

His arm tightened around her waist. "I know how terribly I've behaved. Give me a chance to make it right."

A cold laugh escaped her lips. "How amusing that you're saying this now."

"I swear, Sophia Evans means nothing to me. That child is my brother's—"

Vivian suddenly covered her mouth, her face draining of color.

She shoved Ethan away and bolted for the restroom.

He stood stunned for a second before following swiftly.

Inside, Vivian retched violently over the sink.

"You've been like this too often lately. You need a medical checkup." Ethan rubbed her back, his brow furrowed.

After rinsing her mouth, she reapplied her lipstick. "I'll stop vomiting if you stay away from me."

His gaze burned into her in silence.

As they left, Vivian said coolly, "Consider tonight's favor repaid."

"Let me drive you."

"No."

In one motion, Ethan swept her into his arms. "Oscar Valence might be watching. Do you want him suspicious?"

Her struggles stilled.

Seizing the opportunity, he carried her decisively toward his car.
###Chapter 556

Ethan Roscente practically shoved Vivian Laurent into the car.

After giving the hotel address, she turned to glare at him.

"How did you know I'd be here?" She narrowed her eyes. "Don't tell me this was a coincidence."

Ethan adjusted the steering wheel calmly. "Oscar Valence invited me for business discussions."

"Hmph." Vivian scoffed, gesturing at her flawless makeup and designer outfit. "Then explain this."

His grip tightened on the wheel.

"I knew you'd be here," he admitted. "I just wanted to help."

Vivian turned her face toward the window.

"I don't need your help."

"But I need to protect you." His voice dropped lower. "No matter who you really are."

This was his second confession tonight.

The tips of Vivian's ears burned.

"Worry about yourself," she snapped.

After a tense silence, she suddenly demanded, "How much do you actually know?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Which identity are we talking about?"

The slip was undeniable.

Vivian whirled to face him. "If you breathe a word of this—"

"It's our secret." His lips curved slightly. "Though I look forward to discovering more surprises."

His gaze lingered on her.

This woman never ceased to amaze him.

"Keep dreaming." She crossed her arms. "We're not that close."

"What about that man from the hospital?" Ethan's tone sharpened. "He's dangerous."

Vivian's expression frosted over.

"I've known him longer than you." Each word was ice. "Stay out of my business."

Ethan opened his mouth but remained silent.

Leaning back, Vivian closed her eyes as if resting.

In truth, she was fighting nausea.

These unexplained bouts of sickness were becoming frequent.

A hospital visit seemed inevitable.
###Chapter 557

The night was pitch black, with neon lights flickering at the hotel entrance.

Vivian Laurent had just stepped out of the car when she noticed Ethan Roscente following her.

"What do you think you're doing?" She turned to confront him.

Ethan shrugged. "What a coincidence. I'm staying here too."

Inside the elevator, Vivian stared at the ascending floor numbers.

When she saw Ethan exit on the same floor, she let out a cold laugh.

"Even the room next door?" She arched an eyebrow. "How very thorough of you, Mr. Roscente."

Before Ethan could respond, Vivian swiped her keycard and slammed the door shut.

In her room, Vivian tossed her purse onto the sofa.

Her phone vibrated with a bank notification - a $20 million commission had been deposited.

As she headed toward the bathroom, a knock interrupted her.

A pale little girl stood outside, clutching her stomach.

"Sister... my stomach hurts so bad..." The girl's pants showed traces of blood.

Vivian immediately knelt to examine her.

"Don't be afraid, this is normal." She spoke gently. "Where's your mother?"

"Mom's on a business trip..." The girl bit her lip.

Vivian made a quick decision. "I'll get you medicine and supplies."

The 24-hour pharmacy near the hotel glowed brightly.

While selecting sanitary pads, Vivian suddenly froze.

It hit her - her period was two months late.

The recent nausea, fatigue, and appetite changes...

All the symptoms connected in her mind.

"No way..." she murmured to herself.

That time on the island... she'd taken the morning-after pill, but perhaps too late...

Her hand instinctively touched her abdomen.

At checkout, she inexplicably added two pregnancy tests to her purchase.

Walking back to the hotel, Vivian's steps grew slower.

As a doctor, she knew exactly what these signs meant.

Yet now, she felt just like any other panicked young woman.
###Chapter 558

Vivian Laurent returned to the hotel carrying sanitary pads and painkillers.

She handed them to the young girl next door suffering from menstrual cramps.

After giving some advice, she retreated to her own room.

From her bag, Vivian pulled out a pregnancy test.

The bathroom light glared harshly.

Her fingers trembled as she stared at the two clear red lines.

"Impossible..."

She tore open another box—a different brand.

The result remained the same.

She was pregnant.

The shock made her legs buckle.

Leaning against the sink, Vivian stared at her ghostly pale reflection.

She was only twenty-four.

Motherhood had never crossed her mind at this age.

Least of all with Ethan Roscente as the father.

"What do I do..."

She recalled the alcohol she'd consumed recently. The dangerous missions.

All potential threats to the fragile life inside her.

The biggest problem? She couldn't tell Ethan.

If he found out, everything would spiral out of control.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The sound jerked her from her thoughts.

Vivian hastily tossed the test onto the counter.

Assuming it was the neighbor girl again, she opened the door—

Only to find Ethan standing there.

Rage ignited instantly.

This bastard!

If not for that night...

Her hand flew toward his face.

Ethan caught her wrist effortlessly.

"Viv?"

Furious, she sank her teeth into his forearm.

He hissed in pain but didn't pull away.

Only when she tasted blood did she release him.

Nausea churned in her stomach.

"Get out!" she screamed, eyes blazing.

Ethan didn't budge.

He lifted a takeout bag. "Heard this place was good."

"You haven't eaten."

The sight of his handsome face fueled her anger.

"I'm not hungry!"

She shoved him, but he used the momentum to pull her into his arms.

"Enough. Eat first."

His voice softened to a dangerous tenderness.
###Chapter 559 

"Take it away!"

Vivian pushed the food container aside irritably. She had no appetite right now.

Ethan spoke softly, "Just one bite?"

"Get out!"

"I'll leave after you eat." His gaze lingered on her gaunt cheeks, heart aching. This girl never took proper care of herself.

"Leave!"

All Vivian wanted was solitude.

Yet Ethan wedged through the doorframe, his imposing frame forcing its way in.

The room held only a bed and a sofa.

He strode to the coffee table and unpacked the meal containers.

"Can't even take care of yourself, yet refuse help."

"I'll go after watching you eat."

His deep eyes concealed turbulent emotions.

Vivian gritted her teeth.

Ethan was the last person she wanted to see. If he discovered her pregnancy, he might force her to terminate it.

The Roscente family already had an heir. Why would they want her child?

The aroma of food drifted over, and Vivian suddenly felt hunger pangs.

So it wasn't her appetite improving—there was a little one inside her now.

"Just two bites." She reluctantly picked up the chopsticks.

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted slightly.

Watching her eat was pure joy.

Vivian intended to rush through the meal, but found herself savoring each bite until half was gone.

"Full." She set down the utensils.

Ethan naturally took them and finished her leftovers.

"Plans next? Returning home or—"

"None of your business."

She did have a thorny assignment. Normally she'd accept without hesitation, but now...

What if it harmed the baby? Yet the penalty fee made her wince.

Ethan wisely didn't press further.

After clearing the containers, he suddenly stood. "I'll use the restroom."

"No!" Vivian leapt up, blocking him.

The pregnancy test still lay on the sink!
###Chapter 560

Ethan Roscente had just stepped toward the bathroom when Vivian Laurent blocked his path.

"What's wrong?" He arched an eyebrow at her.

"Use your own bathroom." She crossed her arms. "No outsiders allowed in mine."

Ethan didn't insist. Being permitted to share a meal was already an unexpected concession from Vivian.

"Alright." He nodded. "Get some rest."

On his way out, Ethan gathered the takeout containers.

The click of the door closing made Vivian exhale sharply. She rushed into the bathroom and picked up the pregnancy test with trembling hands.

Two glaring pink lines stared back at her.

Tossing in bed, Vivian couldn't sleep. Her fingers traced her still-flat abdomen where no signs of life were detectable yet.

Her phone rang. Isabella Langley's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello..." Vivian's voice sounded drained.

"Viv? What's wrong?" Isabella immediately detected the strain in her tone.

Vivian bit her lip. She wanted nothing more than to confide in her best friend about this life-altering discovery.

But revealing it would mean the immediate termination of her current mission.

"Just tired," Vivian forced brightness into her voice.

"Mission completed?"

"Yeah. Wrapped up."

"Good." Isabella relaxed slightly. "The next assignment is high-risk. Stay alert."

"I know."

"Rest well then." As Isabella moved to hang up, she caught Vivian's hesitation.

"Isabella, I..."

"What is it?"

"Nothing. Just...miss you guys." The confession died on Vivian's tongue.

"Something's off." Isabella's tone sharpened. "You're hiding something."

"It's really nothing—"

"Tell me!"

Vivian inhaled deeply. "I'll explain everything when I get back. Promise."

After ending the call, Vivian made her decision. If the mission cost her this child, it would be fate's will. If the pregnancy survived...

She squeezed her eyes shut, willing sleep that wouldn't come.

At dawn, she'd leave without giving Ethan any opportunity to interfere. The man might be powerful, but even he couldn't track her every move.
###Chapter 561

The first light of dawn painted the sky when Ethan Roscente arrived at Vivian Laurent's door, takeout breakfast steaming in his hand.

His knuckles rapped against the wood, the sound echoing through the empty hallway.

Silence.

He glanced at his wristwatch and decided to wait.

An hour later, the neighboring door creaked open.

A ponytailed girl rubbed her sleepy eyes. "Mister, are you looking for the pretty lady?"

Ethan's gaze sharpened. "You've seen her?"

"She left with her suitcase before sunrise." The girl tilted her head. "Asked if my stomach still hurt."

His pupils constricted.

In three strides, he reached the front desk, slamming his fist on the marble counter.

"When did the guest in room 606 check out?"

The receptionist flinched. "F-four a.m..."

His phone screen lit up with a lone message from Theo: [Mommy didn't reply]

Not even answering her daughter?

Ethan's knuckles turned white.

He searched every street in the foreign city until sunset.

Defeated, he boarded the flight home.

Outside Langley Corporation, Isabella Langley emerged in stilettos, lips curling at the sight of him.

"Here to turn yourself in, Mr. Roscente?"

His jaw tightened. "What Dark Web contract did Vivian take?"

"None of your damn business." Her scarlet lips smirked. "Heard Roscente Group's stocks are crashing. Focus on saving yourself."

Ethan stepped forward abruptly.

"The mortality rate for S-class Dark Web missions—you know it better than I do." His voice roughened. "Give me the account. I'll transfer twenty million now."

Isabella blinked, then laughed until her shoulders shook.

"You'll never understand her, Ethan."

Her heels clicked against pavement as she walked away without looking back.

"Vivian would rather die on a mission than take a single cent from you."
###Chapter 562

The mission proved far more dangerous than anticipated.

Vivian Laurent's hand drifted unconsciously to her abdomen. The tiny life growing inside unsettled her deeply.

Bullets whizzed past her ears. Her foot slipped, sending her tumbling down the steep mountainside. Jagged rocks tore through her protective gear, leaving bloody gashes across her skin.

During the fall, her arms instinctively cradled her stomach.

The protective gesture startled even herself.

No time to assess injuries. Gritting her teeth, Vivian scrambled up. The pursuers' footsteps grew louder—she had to move.

Only when the aircraft door sealed shut did her tense nerves relax slightly.

Her wounds throbbed, yet medical attention would wait. During the twelve-hour flight, she managed only two hours of fitful sleep.

"Dr. Laurent?"

Nathan Clementson intercepted her hurried steps, his gaze lingering on her pallid lips.

"You look terrible."

As he reached for her arm to examine the abrasions, Vivian jerked away.

"Just fatigue," she dismissed.

After basic first aid, Vivian headed straight to the private suburban hospital.

The OB-GYN hallway echoed with the sound of her own heartbeat.

"Vivian?"

When the nurse called her name, the examining physician glanced up.

"What a coincidence. There's a brilliant surgeon in our field with that same name."

Behind her mask, Vivian's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

The ultrasound wand glided across her abdomen. The tiny flicker on the monitor made her heart skip.

"Fetal development looks excellent. Eight weeks along."

The doctor handed her the results. "Despite your strong constitution, proper nutrition remains essential."

Sunset stretched her shadow long across the pavement outside.

This unexpected life proved more resilient than she'd imagined. Surviving that brutal fall unscathed...

Her fingers absently traced the medical report as Ethan Roscente's stern features surfaced in her mind.

Their fractured relationship was no place for new life.
###Chapter 563

Vivian clutched the medical report and prescription bag tightly as she strode out of the hospital entrance.

Isabella paced anxiously in the apartment, her phone screen flickering between light and dark. She dialed Vivian's number for the third time—still no answer.

The sound of the door unlocking made her head snap up.

"Vivian!" Isabella rushed forward and gripped her shoulders, scanning her up and down. "Your flight landed three hours ago. Where have you been?"

Her gaze dropped to the hospital bag in Vivian's hand. Her pupils constricted.

"Are you hurt?" Her voice rose sharply. "I told you this mission was too dangerous! From now on, you're resting at home. No exceptions!"

Vivian suddenly pulled her into a tight embrace, burying her face against Isabella's shoulder.

"Thank God I have you."

"Damn right!" Isabella patted her back. "Let's go upstairs. By the way, what was it you wanted to tell me last time? And Ethan came looking for you. Did you two—"

"It's nothing." Vivian released her and headed upstairs. "He figured out my identity."

Isabella followed. "So what if he did? It's not like he'd dare expose you—what were you doing at the hospital?"

The bedroom door clicked shut. Vivian turned around. Her pale complexion made Isabella's heart lurch.

"Don't tell me it's..." Isabella's voice trembled. "Terminal?"

Vivian's nails dug into her palms.

"I'm pregnant."

"Pregnant? Well that's not so ba—" Isabella froze mid-sentence, eyes widening. "What did you just say?!"

Vivian clamped a hand over her mouth. "Keep your voice down."

Isabella pried her fingers away, whispering harshly, "Since when? Who's the father?"

Her mind raced. The men in Vivian's life could be counted on one hand. The only one who could possibly...

"Is it Ethan Roscente?"
###Chapter 564

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she whispered, barely audible: "Ethan Roscente..."

"What?" Isabella Langley shot up from her chair, the legs scraping harshly against the floor.

She couldn't believe her ears.

The father could have been anyone—anyone but Ethan Roscente!

"Viv, didn't you two already get divorced? What happened? Did he force you?" Isabella stomped her foot anxiously. She knew Vivian too well—she wasn't the type to act recklessly.

"It wasn't forced." Vivian lowered her lashes. "Just a drunken moment of weakness. Mutual need, nothing more."

"I took the pill, but... I never thought this would happen."

Isabella's temples throbbed as she listened to the full story.

"Does Ethan know?"

"No." Vivian shook her head. "And he doesn't need to."

She knew that man all too well. If he found out, chaos would follow.

"Men are all the same!" Isabella gritted her teeth. "Only caring about their own pleasure, never the consequences!"

Her anger burned hotter, itching to storm over and confront Ethan right then.

"So what are you going to do?" She took a deep breath. "This baby..."

Vivian's fingers twisted the edge of the blanket absently. "I haven't decided yet."

With her recent workload, she hadn't had time to even process the situation.

"Whatever you choose, I'm with you." Isabella squeezed her hand. "If you want to terminate, I'll go with you to the hospital. If you keep it, I'll be the godmother."

"Worst case, we can make Lucas the father on paper. If he dares refuse, I'll break his legs myself!"

Vivian chuckled. "That's practically coercion."

"So what?" Isabella lifted her chin. "Between all of us, we can definitely raise one child."

Warmth bloomed in Vivian's chest. In times like this, sisterhood was the most reliable thing.

"I need more time to think," she murmured. "Don't tell anyone yet—not even Lucas."

"Don't worry, my lips are sealed." Isabella patted her chest. "Get some rest."

Exhaustion crashed over Vivian, her eyelids growing heavy.

"Bella, I'm going to sleep for a bit."

"Go ahead. I'll stay right here."

Vivian drifted off quickly. In her dreams, a small, blurry figure appeared, its tiny voice whispering, "Mommy... don't you want me?"
###Chapter 565

Vivian Laurent jolted awake, her nightgown damp with cold sweat.

Her chest rose and fell rapidly as the remnants of her nightmare receded like tidewater, leaving only a lingering palpitation.

At three in the morning, she padded barefoot to the kitchen for water.

The chilled glass pressed against her palm as she stared blankly into the inky darkness beyond the window.

Her fingers absently grazed her still-flat abdomen—where an unexpected life had taken root.

The thought tightened her chest like a vise.

She knew better than anyone the taste of growing up in a broken home.

The fatherless childhood. The memory of her mother's tear-streaked face. These scars were etched into her bones.

"Baby..." Her whisper cracked with emotion.

If she kept this child, Ethan Roscente would inevitably find out.

But to give it up...

Her grip on the glass turned white-knuckled.

How she longed for the numbing burn of alcohol, but even that escape was forbidden to her now.

———

Dawn light filtered through the curtains when the rich aroma of breakfast roused Vivian.

She followed the scent downstairs to find Isabella Langley emerging from the kitchen with a plate of fried eggs.

"Perfect timing." Isabella winked. "Taste test for me?"

Finn Deross shuffled out of the guest room rubbing his eyes, nostrils flaring. "Smells amazing!"

He bounded to the table, eyes gleaming. "Isabella Langley cooking? Did hell freeze over?"

"Shut up." She shoved toast into his mouth. "This is for Vivian. You're just collateral."

Finn chewed mournfully. "How is a handsome guy like me just collateral?"

Vivian's lips twitched, the shadows in her heart momentarily lifting.

"Oh," Finn suddenly remembered, "Uncle went back to the family estate. Asked me to tell you."

Vivian's lashes lowered as her fork absently prodded the eggs.

"He said..." Finn scratched his head. "Call him if you need anything."

"Mmm." Her reply was barely audible.

Isabella shot Finn a glare. "No talking at the table. Eat."

Finn hunched his shoulders, wolfed down his food, and made a hasty exit.

As the door opened, Ethan Roscente's silhouette appeared in the doorway.

Dark circles bruised his eyes—clear evidence of sleepless nights.

"Is Vivian here?" His voice was gravel-rough.

Before Finn could answer, Ethan shouldered past him into the living room.

"Vivian!"

Isabella's fork clattered onto her plate.

She surged to her feet, eyes blazing. "Ethan Roscente!"

Ethan barely had time to react before Isabella whirlwinded into the kitchen.

The next second, the cold edge of a chef's knife pressed against his throat.
###Chapter 566

Ethan Roscente had barely stepped into the living room when a gleaming kitchen knife came flying toward him.

He sidestepped swiftly, the blade grazing his coat before embedding itself in the doorframe behind him.

"Let's talk this through," Ethan said, frowning as he took a step back.

Isabella Langley grabbed another knife, her eyes bloodshot. "Talk? All men are beasts!"

Ethan glanced toward the dining area where Vivian Laurent sat quietly sipping her porridge, not even lifting an eyelid.

"Did Felix upset you?" he ventured.

"Don't shift the blame!" Isabella hissed through clenched teeth. "You're just as disgusting as Felix!"

Ethan noticed Vivian's knuckles turning white around her spoon.

Suddenly, he realized the problem might lie with him.

"If I've done something wrong, I apologize," he said gravely.

"The one who deserves your apology is Vivian!" Isabella pointed the knife tip at his nose.

Ethan turned to Vivian. "I'm sorry. I was wrong."

The clink of porcelain echoed through the dining room as a spoon hit the bowl's edge.

Isabella sneered. "About what?"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. He truly didn't know.

"Everything that's made you unhappy is my fault," he said, staring at the back of Vivian's head. "Where have you been these days? I've been worried."

"Shut up!" Isabella slammed her knife into the entryway cabinet. "Who gave you the right to call her 'Vivian'? Get out!"

Ethan didn't move.

He saw Vivian's shoulders trembling slightly.

"Is your stomach still hurting?" he raised his voice. "Do you need—"

"Get out!" Isabella grabbed his collar and dragged him toward the door.

As the front door slammed shut, Vivian's spoon finally dropped into her bowl.

Isabella locked the door and returned with red-rimmed eyes.

"Ignore that bastard," she said, adding another spoonful of hot porridge to Vivian's bowl. "The decision about the baby is yours."

Vivian stared at the oil swirls floating on her porridge.

"Thank you," she whispered.

"What for?" Isabella bit savagely into her steamed bun. "When you protected me and Lucas back then, I never said thank you."

A terrible silence fell over the dining room.

Vivian's nails left pale scratches on the tablecloth.

She remembered Ethan's burning palm against her skin that night, her own uncontrollable gasps.

Most of all, she remembered those two glaring red lines on the pregnancy test.

"I'm fine," she said, lifting her bowl as steam blurred her vision.
###Chapter 567 

Vivian Laurent had been recuperating at home for an entire week. That morning, sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains into the living room when Theo Evans appeared at the doorway carrying multiple bags.

"Pretty sister!" Theo chirped in his childish voice, clutching a large bouquet of sunflowers. "I brought chocolates, strawberry cake, and pudding too!"

Vivian accepted the gifts with a smile, noticing the boy still wore his face mask. She reached to remove it, but Theo shrank back.

"My allergies make me look scary," he said, blinking his large eyes.

Vivian crouched to his level. "I'm a doctor. Let me take a look."

"No, no!" Theo stomped his foot anxiously. "I look like a little monster! You'll run away!"

Isabella Langley peeked out from the kitchen. "Well, who's this sweetheart?"

Theo immediately straightened up. "Hello, pretty sister! I'm Theo. Next time I'll bring you roses!"

"Such a charmer," Isabella pinched his cheek. "Are you sure Vivian didn't secretly give birth to you?"

Vivian shook her head in amusement. Watching Theo's energetic movements, her hand unconsciously drifted to her abdomen. Would her own child be this adorable if born?

But the thought of Theo's facial scars sent a pang through Vivian's heart. What kind of damage could irresponsible parents inflict on their children?

After seeing Theo off that evening, Vivian finally returned to work. As she opened her car door, a pungent odor assaulted her senses.

"Look out!"

Vivian instinctively dodged sideways. The liquid splashed against her car door, instantly corroding the metal with terrifying speed. Screams erupted around her.

"Acid! Call security!"

Vivian looked up just in time to see a fleeing figure disappear into the distance. Her heart sank like stone - someone had just tried to kill her.
###Chapter 568

Concentrated sulfuric acid glistened ominously under the sunlight.

Vivian Laurent had just stepped out of the hospital when a blinding liquid shot toward her face.

She dodged instinctively.

The pavement sizzled as black scorch marks appeared instantly.

"Sophia Sherwood?"

Vivian spotted the figure hiding behind a tree.

Seeing her attack fail, the woman turned to flee.

In three quick strides, Vivian seized her wrist and pinned her to the ground.

"Let me go!" Sophia thrashed violently.

"Too cowardly to face the consequences?" Vivian sneered.

She dialed emergency services without hesitation.

Screams erupted nearby—a bystander had been splashed, their arm now searing with chemical burns.

"This is all your fault!" Sophia shrieked hysterically. "If it weren't for you, Ethan would never have fired me!"

Vivian frowned. "I had no part in that decision."

She immediately contacted Nathan Clementson, instructing surgery to prepare for incoming casualties.

"I sacrificed everything for him!" Sophia's eyes burned with venom. "Studying abroad, plastic surgery, working myself to the bone—all to be worthy of him!"

The absurdity made Vivian scoff.

"If you wanted him, you should've fought for him yourself. Attacking me is just pathetic."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

"It wasn't me! She's framing me!" Sophia lied to the approaching officers.

Police escorted both women to the station for statements.

Ethan Roscente arrived in a rush, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Where are you hurt?" He grabbed Vivian's arm urgently.

She winced and pulled away. "Perfect timing. Explain this mess."

Only then did Ethan notice Sophia in the corner.

"Your termination was a corporate decision." His voice turned glacial. "Vivian had nothing to do with it."
###Chapter 569

"You're lying!" Sophia Sherwood screamed hysterically.

Her trembling finger pointed at Vivian Laurent. "She put you up to this! That woman's an expert at playing innocent. Don't be fooled, Ethan!"

"Vivian never mentioned you." Ethan Roscente's voice was icy. "But you—you've targeted her repeatedly, even resorting to such despicable methods!"

He never imagined his childhood friend could be so vicious.

Regret washed over him like a tidal wave. He should've seen Sophia's true colors sooner. She never should've stayed at Roscente Group this long.

"Ethan!" Sophia's voice trembled. "Vivian's the real viper! Even Sophia Evans with all her tricks fell victim to her schemes. Now she's coming after me! I only acted out of—"

"Sophia Evans?" Ethan's eyes narrowed sharply. "How do you know about her?"

Sophia's face paled.

She stumbled backward. "I...I just heard—"

Ethan was already dialing the bodyguard monitoring Sophia Evans.

The woman answered breathlessly. "Ethan! You finally remembered me!"

"Do you know Sophia Sherwood?" Ethan cut straight to the point.

"Who?" Sophia Evans sounded confused. "I've been behaving...wait, someone did contact me recently—"

The truth became clear.

Ethan hung up and looked at Sophia Sherwood like she was a stranger.

"Sophia Evans confessed everything."

Sophia shook her head wildly. "That's not true! I did it for you! Our twenty years of friendship—"

Vivian approached slowly, a glass of liquid glinting coldly in her hand.

"Since you're so fond of acid," she said softly, "why not experience it yourself?"

Ethan turned silently and walked out.

Sophia backed away in terror, handcuffs clanking. "You wouldn't dare! This is a police station!"

She clutched her face—her most prized asset.
###Chapter 570 

"Go ahead and report me. If you're not afraid, why should I be?"

Vivian Laurent's lips curled into a cold smirk, her gaze sharp as a blade.

Sophia Sherwood trembled uncontrollably, her voice cracking. "Vivian, I was wrong. Please spare me!"

Only now did true terror grip her. Regret always came too late after failure.

The empty room held no police, no witnesses. Vivian could do as she pleased.

"Begging now?" Vivian scoffed. "Adults should take responsibility for their choices."

She never pitied fools like this. Stupidity in the heat of passion always demanded payment.

Clearly, jealousy had clouded Sophia's judgment, leading to such clumsy schemes.

"Give me another chance!" Sophia pleaded desperately. "I swear I'll compete fairly. No more targeting you."

As if Vivian would believe such lies.

"Fine," she said carelessly. "Kneel and kowtow in apology. Then I might believe you."

Sophia paled. "Never! Vivian, don't push me too far!"

"Too far?" Vivian tilted the glass in her hand. "I can do much worse."

She feigned throwing the liquid at Sophia.

"No!" Sophia shrieked, her legs giving way as she wet herself on the spot.

The acrid stench filled the air instantly. Sophia's dress darkened with spreading dampness, droplets pattering to the floor.

Vivian blinked in surprise. She hadn't even acted yet.

"How pathetic," Vivian mocked. "The campus queen, reduced to this. Imagine if this got out?"

Sophia shook her head frantically. "Please don't tell anyone! I swear I'll leave you alone!"

She collapsed to her knees. "I'm kneeling! Please!"

At worst, this would be misdemeanor assault with no injuries. If Vivian dropped charges...

Vivian always kept her word.

With a flick of her wrist, she poured the liquid onto the floor. Clear. Odorless. No reaction.

"This..." Sophia gaped.

"Just colored water." Vivian's tone remained flat. "I'm not cruel enough for sulfuric acid."

"As a woman, I understand vanity. But I'll still press charges. Next time..."

She set down the glass and walked away.

Sophia slumped on the floor, gasping. Vivian's presence had been suffocating.

But the true humiliation? Pissing herself over a glass of water.
###Chapter 571

Vivian Laurent stepped out of the police station, with Ethan Roscente close behind.

"You should get checked at the hospital," Ethan said, his brow furrowed.

Vivian halted and turned to face him. "What? Afraid I actually threw acid?"

"That wasn’t acid in the cup," Ethan stated firmly. "You wouldn’t do something like that."

"You think you know me?" Vivian scoffed.

Ethan met her gaze. "You always act with restraint. Fiona Grandelle was behind Sophia Evans' incident."

"This time, I slipped up," he admitted, his voice low. "I’ll handle it."

Vivian pulled her hand free. "You’ve got enough romantic entanglements. Staying away from me is the best protection you can offer."

"I promise—"

"Your promises mean nothing," Vivian cut him off. "You deal with the police. I’m going to the hospital."

Ethan quickened his pace to catch up. "I’ll drive you."

......

The interrogation room reeked of an unpleasant odor.

Sophia Sherwood shot to her feet. "I need to make a call!"

An officer handed her a phone and stood nearby, watching.

"Felix, I’m at the police station," Sophia said, her voice trembling. "Help me."

Half an hour later, Felix Valdemar rushed in.

"What happened?" he asked, wrinkling his nose as he approached. "What’s that smell?"

Sophia lunged toward him, but Felix instinctively stepped back.

"Ethan’s pressing charges against me," she sobbed. "I only wanted to scare Vivian! I didn’t even hurt her!"

Felix’s eyes widened. "You went after Vivian?"

"Please, talk to him for me," she pleaded, clutching his sleeve. "For old times’ sake."

Felix pulled his arm free, his heart sinking. Ethan treated Vivian like she was made of glass—Sophia had just walked into a firing squad.

"I... can’t help you with this," he said reluctantly.
###Chapter 572

"Felix, please help me. For old times' sake."

Sophia Sherwood gazed at Felix Valdemar with tear-filled eyes, her delicate features twisted in distress.

Felix frowned. "I can't get involved."

Though he'd once harbored feelings for her, his moral compass remained intact.

"You've always liked me, haven't you?" Sophia suddenly clutched his sleeve. "If you help me leave this place and convince Vivian Laurent to drop the charges, I'll be your girlfriend."

She'd always considered Felix beneath her, unworthy compared to Ethan Roscente. But desperation made her discard pride.

Felix studied her, struck by how unfamiliar she seemed.

He'd never entertained improper thoughts about Sophia. Those schoolboy affections had faded long ago.

"You're mistaken." He withdrew his arm. "I only ever saw you as a classmate."

Sophia's face darkened. "But you—"

"My loyalty to Boss Ethan is real." Felix cut her off. "But I never expected you'd resort to these methods. You've disappointed me, Sophia."

The dazzle of their reunion had vanished. Now he saw only ugliness beneath her polished exterior.

True beauty wasn't skin deep.

His thoughts drifted to Isabella Langley. Though that spitfire constantly bickered with him, at least she had integrity.

"Felix!" Sophia grabbed him again. "You weren't like this before. I'll do anything if you just—"

"Enough." He shook her off. "Don't make me despise you more."

As he turned to leave, her shriek followed him: "You'll regret this!"

Outside the police station, a familiar figure blocked his path.

"Felix!" Isabella glared at him. "Don't tell me you came to bail that woman out!"
###Chapter 573

"That's not what I meant."

Isabella Langley scoffed. "You'd better not. If you dare bail out that crazy woman who threw acid, you're dead to me."

Felix Valdemar fell silent for a moment.

"She did beg for my help, but I refused. More importantly, why are you here?"

"To watch her suffer, of course."

Felix frowned. "Don't interfere. The police will handle it."

"Since when do you care?" Isabella shook off his grip. "Or are you still protecting her?"

"When have I ever protected her?" Felix snapped irritably. "Are you blind?"

"Me? Blind?" Isabella's voice rose sharply. "You're the one who couldn't see what your precious first love really was!"

Felix's expression darkened.

Just then, a well-dressed young man emerged from Isabella's car.

"Isabella, is everything settled?"

It was her client for the day. She'd been in a business meeting when Vivian Laurent called. The client had kindly offered to drive her here upon hearing the news.

Felix stared at the man, an inexplicable tightness in his chest.

"Who's he?"

"None of your business!" Isabella rolled her eyes.

Felix suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Forget about Sophia Sherwood. Have a drink with me."

"It's noon! Let go!"

"Then let's have lunch."

Isabella snorted. "Since when do we have civil meals together?"

Without another word, Felix dragged her away.

"Let go! Felix!"

"Try touching me again!"

"Ah! Put me down!"

Isabella struggled violently, but Felix effortlessly threw her over his shoulder and dumped her into the passenger seat. She cursed nonstop until he deposited her in a restaurant chair.

Surprisingly, the meal proceeded without argument.

Isabella poked at her steak. "At least you saw her true colors now. Don't take it too hard."

"Who's taking it hard?" Felix glared. "Answer me. Who was that guy?"

Only then did Isabella remember her abandoned client. She scrambled for her phone. "This is your fault!"

After connecting the call, she apologized profusely. "I'm so sorry. Next time's on me."

"Yes, just some lunatic acting up. I'm fine..."

Felix snatched the phone and ended the call, his face stormy.

"Who are you calling a lunatic?"
###Chapter 574

"Isabella Langley, you're spreading rumors about me again!"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Your reputation was already in the gutter before I got to it."

Their heated argument made them completely forget someone was still on the line.

When she finally realized, she quickly apologized and hung up.

Felix Valdemar narrowed his eyes. "New boyfriend?"

"Not everyone has a dirty mind like you."

"Can't I even ask?" Felix felt inexplicably irritated. "Why so defensive?"

He couldn't tell if it was Sophia Sherwood or Isabella affecting him.

Seeing Sophia left him indifferent, but that phone call with the unknown man made him uncomfortable.

"None of your business." Isabella stabbed her steak viciously. "Unlike you, I don't call every woman I meet my girlfriend."

"I've been single for ages!" Felix shot back. "Meanwhile, you change boyfriends faster than outfits."

Isabella nearly slammed the table. "When have you ever seen that?"

Meanwhile, he was the one constantly switching between crushes.

"Hit a nerve?" Felix taunted.

Isabella raised her fist. "Say one more word and I'll—"

"Takes one to know one." He shrugged. "We're two of a kind."

"I am nothing like you!"

The meal descended into chaos, yet something between them quietly shifted.

That afternoon, Isabella visited Vivian Laurent at the hospital.

The other victims had their wounds treated and were all preparing to sue Sophia Sherwood.

"Felix went to see her," Isabella muttered. "If he dares to help her, he'll regret it."

Liam Valdemar appeared suddenly. "What are you talking about?"

He had been discharged but returned for regular checkups.

"Someone threw acid at Vivian," Isabella blurted out.

Liam's gaze turned icy. "Who?"

"That crazy woman from the bar."

His fists clenched.

He regretted not dealing with her permanently the first time.

This time, he wouldn't hold back.
###Chapter 575

Vivian adjusted the collar of her lab coat.

"Let me see the test results."

Liam handed her the report with his new name printed clearly at the top - "Liam Laurent."

She'd given him her surname when admitting him to the hospital. A single character name like "Zero" would draw too much attention, and he didn't have a Chinese name.

Liam showed no objection to his new identity.

Her eyes scanned the document quickly.

"All your vitals are improving. You just need to rebuild your blood and energy levels."

"Understood."

His voice held surprising docility.

Isabella watched the exchange with amusement.

"Who would believe the Dark Web's top assassin could be this obedient?"

With no outsiders present, she spoke freely.

Vivian shot her a warning glance.

"Stop that."

"I'm stating facts." Isabella winked at Liam. "Right?"

The corner of his mouth lifted in an innocent smile.

"I'll always listen to... Vivian."

His near-slip with the name "Shadow" made Vivian's pulse quicken.

"I'm just your doctor."

Her hand drifted unconsciously to her still-flat stomach. Only Isabella knew about the pregnancy.

"Dinner tonight?" Liam's gaze lingered on her face. "I can wait until you finish your shift."

"It's too early." She checked her watch. "Go rest."

"The doctor said I need nourishment." His tone carried hidden meaning. "You could use some too."

"I am the doctor."

Vivian stood to usher them out.

"My shift starts soon. Don't distract me."

Isabella took the hint and moved toward the door.

"Don't overwork yourself. You're not fully recovered either."

Liam rose as well.

"Another time then."

When they'd gone, Vivian exhaled deeply.

She'd specifically requested outpatient duty today to avoid the operating room's demands during her pregnancy.

Meanwhile, Liam was tracking Sophia Sherwood's whereabouts.

The woman remained in police custody. While other victims had accepted settlements, Ethan Roscente had intervened to block any deal for Vivian.

Legally, Sophia would only face brief detention.

Liam's eyes turned icy as he stared at his phone screen.

He'd let the woman live a little longer.
###Chapter 576 

Sophia Sherwood's attempted homicide case was closed as an incomplete offense. Since the victim remained unharmed, she was released after just seven days in detention.

Upon hearing the news, Ethan Roscente immediately gathered lavish gifts and went to apologize in person. But Vivian Laurent kept her doors firmly shut, refusing to see him. Her emotions were in turmoil—every glimpse of Ethan reminded her of the child growing inside her.

Days passed, the fetus quietly developing within her. Vivian remained torn, yet the reluctance in her heart grew more palpable. If not for this inner conflict, she wouldn't have agonized for so long.

"Vivian, are you asleep?" Ethan's knuckles rapped lightly against the door, met only with silence. He lingered outside before finally sighing.

He discreetly arranged for security to watch over Vivian. Though he knew the elite agent Shadow needed no protection, Ethan couldn't shake his unease.

Sunlight stung Sophia Sherwood's eyes as she stepped out of detention. Freedom was hers again, but clarity had come at a price.

Ethan had never cared for her. Felix Valdemar was nothing but a useless coward. And Vivian—that woman should've died! The memory of her own humiliating loss of control made Sophia's teeth grind.

Worse, the incident had left a permanent stain on her record. Not only had her plan failed, but Ethan now despised her even more. Sophia glared at her phone, scrolling through the Dark Web for contract killers.

The doorbell rang.

Alert, Sophia peered through the peephole. A man in a security uniform stood outside, his cap pulled low.

"What is it?" she called through the door.

"Downstairs reported a plumbing leak. I need to inspect your pipes." His voice was deep and smooth.

"Impossible. I haven't been home for days." Despite her words, Sophia's gaze lingered on his striking profile. There was something familiar about him, though she couldn't place it.

After a pause, she opened the door.

The moment he stepped inside, Sophia arched a brow. "You did this on purpose, didn't you?"

Liam Valdemar's pupils constricted. Had she seen through his disguise? Well, at least he could let her choose how she wanted to die.

"I knew it." Sophia smirked, tilting her chin up. "You're just a lowly security guard with a crush on me, aren't you? Using work as an excuse to get close?"

She completely missed the icy glint of murder in his eyes.
###Chapter 577
Sophia Sherwood's Demise

Liam Valdemar's brow furrowed slightly.

This woman was utterly insufferable.

Sophia Sherwood kept prattling on, her eyes filled with undisguised contempt.

"You're not bad-looking, but let me warn you—I already have someone special." She tilted her chin up arrogantly. "A lowly security guard like you couldn't even afford a single meal of mine."

A glacial chill seeped into Liam's gaze.

"You think I'm interested in you?"

"Isn't it obvious?" Sophia scoffed derisively. "Stop pretending. A penniless nobody like you isn't even worthy of—"

Her words died abruptly as her pupils contracted in shock.

She looked down to see a fruit knife embedded in her chest.

Crimson bloomed across her blouse in an instant.

Liam watched dispassionately as she collapsed.

He'd already donned gloves. Now he pressed Sophia's lifeless hand against the knife handle.

This blade had been purchased by Sophia herself.

As a professional operative, murder was second nature to Liam.

He'd spent three days mapping the surveillance blind spots in this neighborhood.

With Sophia recently unemployed, her corpse wouldn't be discovered for at least a week.

By then, decomposition would make suicide the obvious conclusion.

Liam cast one final glance at the body.

Anyone who threatened Shadow would meet the same fate.

Ethan Roscente kept vigil outside Vivian Laurent's apartment all night.

Not once did fatigue touch him.

Being this close to Vivian filled him with quiet contentment.

Young Theo had wholeheartedly supported his decision.

At dawn, his assistant delivered breakfast.

Ethan dared not leave, unwilling to miss Vivian's departure.

The sound of a turning lock snapped him to attention.

"Vivian!"

She opened the door to find him holding breakfast.

"Let me drive you to work?"

"Ethan," Vivian sighed, "what exactly do you want?"

"To make amends." Ethan's gaze held raw sincerity. "When I was injured, you cared for me day and night."

He stepped closer. "Now it's my turn to protect you."
###Chapter 578
A Puzzling Case

"Ethan Roscente, belated affection is cheaper than weeds. Those past events are long over. I have no feelings left for you!"

"Really? Then say it again while looking into my eyes." Ethan's piercing gaze held her captive.

He could clearly see the hesitation in Vivian Laurent's eyes. She still loved him.

If this was about Theo, it was all a misunderstanding. He could call the boy over anytime to clarify—Theo was just his nephew.

When Vivian met his gaze, the storm of emotions swirling in those deep eyes left her speechless.

The sudden ringing of a phone shattered the moment.

"Your call." Vivian turned her face away.

Ethan was about to decline when the caller ID made him freeze. "Detective Chen?"

Vivian's steps faltered at the title.

"What?" Ethan's voice sharpened. "I'll be right there."

He released Vivian's hand. "You go ahead. There's an emergency."

"What happened?" She grabbed his sleeve.

After a brief hesitation, Ethan answered, "Sophia Sherwood, she—"

"What trouble is she causing now? Wasn't she just released?"

"She's dead."

Vivian's pupils constricted.

Dead? Just one day after leaving the police station?

"Detective Chen wants us to assist with the investigation," Ethan said grimly.

"Let's go now!" Vivian yanked open the car door.

At the precinct, Detective Chen pointed to the white sheet on the autopsy table. "Found this morning. We couldn't reach her, so we checked the surveillance. She never left her apartment after returning home."

"Time of death?" Vivian's voice tightened.

"Yesterday morning, shortly after arriving home. Stab wound to the chest. Preliminary assessment suggests suicide."

"But here's the strange part." The detective pulled up phone records. "Right before death, she was searching 'how to hire a hitman.' Doesn't sound like someone planning suicide."

The footage showed no visitors. No signs of struggle at the scene.

A fruit knife protruded from her chest. Only Sophia's fingerprints were on the handle.

"The most puzzling detail," the detective lowered his voice, "the coroner found traces of hallucinogens in her system."

Vivian and Ethan exchanged glances, both thinking of one person—the mastermind who remained at large.
###Chapter 579

Detective Chen's gaze settled on Vivian Laurent. The target of Sophia Sherwood's hired killer was obvious.

Ethan Roscente immediately clarified, "This has nothing to do with us. Vivian was at the hospital yesterday morning—she has an alibi."

"Just routine inquiries," Detective Chen explained. "We're informing you as part of the investigation."

Vivian frowned. "Have you checked the neighborhood surveillance?"

"We did. No leads. The killer didn't infiltrate beforehand—no one entered Sophia's home before the incident."

The forensic report indicated Sophia died from a single fatal stab wound. The angle suggested suicide. Only her fingerprints were found on the weapon.

"Can I see the crime scene and the footage?" Vivian requested.

After special approval, she reviewed the surveillance. The recordings hadn't been tampered with—they were completely blank.

Vivian fell into deep thought. Very few people in the world could pull this off.

That evening during dinner, she brought it up.

Isabella Langley gasped. "She's dead?"

"Karma caught up with her," she muttered, shrugging.

Lucas Lefèvre looked stunned. "How could someone just die like that? Who did it?"

Reactions varied around the table—except for Liam Valdemar, who remained expressionless.

Vivian tapped her chopsticks absently. At the police station, she'd already suspected Liam was responsible. For him, this would be child's play.

Isabella raised her glass. "This calls for a celebration! Boss, bring us drinks!"

She suddenly changed her mind. "Never mind. My stomach's acting up."

Lucas glanced at Vivian with concern. "You haven't eaten much either. Are you feeling unwell?"

Vivian didn't respond, lost in thought. Isabella covered for her. "She's on a diet."

"You're already so thin." Lucas placed a piece of meat in her bowl.

After the meal, Vivian stopped Liam. "Let me walk you out."

"No need. Get some rest," he declined politely.

"Then walk me home," she insisted.
###Chapter 580

"Alright." Liam responded curtly.

He led Vivian toward the parking lot. "Let's drive. I'll take you home."

Vivian shook her head. "Let's walk. It's been a while since we strolled like this. The street is quiet and scenic."

Liam didn't object, falling into step beside her.

"Liam, are you still connected to the organization?" Vivian asked abruptly.

His steps faltered slightly. "Not really. I want out, just like you. This is my chance. Thank you for saving me, Shadow."

"If you're leaving the organization, certain things must stop."

No longer an agent, he'd be an ordinary civilian.

This was Canada—a nation of strict laws. Murder meant execution. Carrying firearms was illegal. Justice prevailed here.

Liam's expression remained neutral. "I've been recovering from my injuries. Haven't done anything."

"Where were you yesterday?"

"At home."

"You didn't go out?"

He shook his head. "No."

A cold glint flickered in his downcast eyes, hidden from Vivian's view.

"Can anyone vouch for that?"

Liam schooled his features, meeting her gaze. "Shadow, you're acting strange. At dinner, you mentioned someone died. Do you suspect me?"

He cut straight to the point.

Vivian held his stare. "So, was it you?"

"Of course not." His denial was firm. "I don't even know who you're talking about."

Shadow was as sharp as ever. But without evidence, she couldn't pin this on him.

He hadn't expected the body to be discovered so soon. By his calculations, it should've rotted beyond recognition first.

"You saw her at the bar last time."

"You really think I did it?" Liam countered.

Vivian stopped walking, her gaze piercing. "Did you?"

He met her eyes without flinching. "No. I didn't know her. No motive, no reason to kill her."

That was precisely what puzzled Vivian.

Liam fit the profile for this killing method. Yet he and Sophia Sherwood were strangers.

Something felt overlooked.

Seizing her silence, Liam pressed on. "I never thought you'd doubt me, Shadow. Next time someone dies, will you automatically blame me?"

"That's not what I meant." Vivian apologized. "If I came across harshly, I'm sorry."

"No need." His tone softened. "I know you're worried about me."

Her expression turned grave. "Canadian law is stringent. Even the Director avoids operations here."

That was why she'd found safety in this country.

Not even Dominic Atlante, a notorious crime lord, dared act recklessly on Canadian soil. She feared Liam might court disaster.
###Chapter 581

"Murder and arson are strictly prohibited here."

Vivian's voice was soft but carried unshakable conviction.

"If you choose to live as an ordinary person, you must abide by ordinary rules."

She was reminding Zero that since he'd decided to leave the organization, he should completely abandon those dark methods.

"I understand."

Zero's response was brief and firm.

Vivian said no more. Though her instincts told her this matter involved Zero, she had no evidence.

More importantly, Zero had no motive.

Surely he wouldn't have targeted Sophia Sherwood just for her sake?

Her conflict with Sophia hadn't reached a life-or-death level yet.

Halfway home, Vivian suddenly hailed a taxi.

"I'm tired. I'll take a cab. You should rest early too."

Without hesitation, Zero followed her into the vehicle.

"I promised to see you home. I keep my word."

Unable to dissuade him, Vivian let him escort her.

As she exited the car, Zero suddenly called out.

"Shadow... no, Vivian."

"Yes?"

"You and Ethan Roscente... is it really over between you?"

Her heart skipped a beat.

Legally, they were already divorced.

But the tiny life growing inside her felt like an invisible thread still binding them together.

"Why do you ask?"

She avoided giving a direct answer.

Zero shook his head.

"Just concerned he might cause you trouble. Call me if you need help."

"Thank you."

Vivian turned toward her apartment complex.

The moment her back was turned, Zero dropped all pretense. His razor-sharp glare sent the driver stomping on the accelerator in panic.

When Zero returned to his residence, he found someone waiting at his door.

"Master!"

Annika rushed forward, eyes glistening with tears.

"I told you not to come here."

Zero's voice was glacial.

"But I was worried about you!"

Annika's voice trembled.

"I saw you having dinner with her. She's alive, isn't she? You did all this for her, didn't you?"

Initially, Annika knew nothing—only that she'd desperately tried to rescue her master.

When news broke about the Dark Web prison break, she'd begun suspecting the truth.

For days she'd searched frantically, finally spotting Zero today.

What shocked her most was seeing that woman in person.

The photos hadn't done her justice—she was breathtakingly beautiful.

What hurt most was the tenderness in her master's eyes when he looked at her, an expression she'd never seen directed at herself.

"Tell no one about this."

Zero's tone turned dangerous.

"Did you leave the organization without permission?"

Annika shook her head.

"I came under mission pretext."

"Good."

Zero's eyes narrowed threateningly.

"Remember—not a word to anyone. Or else..."

Annika's heart felt slashed open.

Or else what? Would her master kill her?

After all these years together, what did she even mean to him?

"Master... will you return to the organization?"

She choked back sobs.

"Can I come with you? I want to remain your apprentice forever..."
###Chapter 582

Annika's fingers trembled slightly.

She finally understood why Master Zero had taken this dangerous mission.

Shadow.

The legendary operative who was supposed to be dead.

Master Zero had never stopped searching for Shadow. This mission was just a ruse. He was gambling with his life to lure out the person hiding in the shadows.

"Go back," Zero's voice was terrifyingly calm. "The organization needs you."

He suddenly reached out and gently ruffled Annika's hair.

The gesture made her eyes burn.

"I'm not a child anymore," she said stubbornly.

A faint smile tugged at Zero's lips. "To me, you'll always be my little girl."

Annika bit her lower lip.

She wanted to ask him what that woman meant to him. But she didn't dare. She was afraid of the answer.

"Master, let me stay for a few days," she pleaded softly. "I need to know you're safe."

Zero hesitated before nodding.

Annika noticed the change in him. The ruthless assassin now had warmth in his eyes.

It made her heart ache.

Because of Shadow.

Only Shadow could make him like this.

"Don't blow your cover," Zero warned.

Annika immediately brightened. This meant she could stay by his side openly.

"There's something I need you to handle," Zero said suddenly.

"Anything, Master."

"I killed someone."

Annika's expression remained neutral. For people like them, killing was as ordinary as drinking water.

"The body was discovered too soon," Zero said flatly. "I staged it as a suicide, but the police aren't buying it. Find a scapegoat."

"Consider it done."

Annika followed Zero into the apartment, her heart racing. She'd been looking forward to this time alone with him.

Meanwhile, at Ethan Roscente's private club...

Felix Valdemar's glass slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor.

"Sophia Sherwood is dead?" His voice shook. "That's impossible!"

Ethan's expression was grave. "Preliminary reports say suicide."

"Suicide?" Felix shot to his feet. "She would never kill herself!"

Patrick Alpinus set down his file, sharpness flashing in his eyes.

"The woman from last time?" he asked.

As an Interpol agent, Patrick's instincts immediately kicked in.

Ethan nodded. "The case is suspicious."

Patrick narrowed his eyes. "I can look into it before my vacation ends."

The three men exchanged glances.

The air grew thick with tension.
###Chapter 583

"If she didn't attempt suicide at the police station, why would she suddenly do it at home?" Felix Valdemar frowned.

Patrick Alpinus immediately pulled out his phone, preparing to contact the authorities for an investigation tomorrow.

Ethan Roscente's brows furrowed deeper.

A bold suspicion flashed through his mind.

Zero.

The elite agent.

For someone like Zero, making a person disappear would be child's play.

But was it really him?

Ethan recalled the way Zero had looked at Vivian Laurent.

That was unmistakably the gaze of a man in love.

A crime of passion?

The thought crossed his mind briefly, but there was no evidence to support it.

"Boss Ethan!"

Felix called his name three times before Ethan snapped out of his thoughts.

"What?"

"You've been spacing out. Didn't you hear a word we said?"

"Never mind." Ethan set down his chopsticks. "I'm leaving."

"You barely touched your food." Felix looked baffled.

"I need to get back to Theo."

Ethan stood and walked away, his tense silhouette radiating unease.

That night, neither Vivian nor Ethan could sleep.

The next morning, Theo eagerly sought out Vivian to play.

Seeing the child's loneliness tugged at her heart.

She decided to take him to Disneyland to make new friends.

Amid the colorful rides, children's laughter filled the air.

Vivian encouraged Theo to join the other kids.

Soon, he was swept up in the joyful atmosphere.

"Miss, you're so pretty!"

A little girl with pigtails tugged at Vivian's sleeve.

Vivian crouched down and gently ruffled her hair.

Watching the carefree children, Vivian suddenly made up her mind.

She would keep this child.

Not as Ethan's son.

But as her own.

She would give him all the love she had, ensuring he never endured the childhood she had.

Tomorrow, she'd register at the hospital for prenatal care.

Just as Vivian was envisioning their future, a chill crawled up her spine.

Theo was gone.

"Theo?"

She scanned the area, but the familiar little figure was nowhere in sight.

She asked every child nearby.

No one had seen where he went.

Cold sweat drenched her back.

The worst possibility surfaced in her mind—

A child trafficker.

She didn't even know how to contact Ethan.
###Chapter 584

The mall buzzed with activity, but Vivian Laurent felt ice-cold.

The surveillance footage was too blurry to trace Theo's whereabouts. Her fingers trembled as she dialed 911—

"Vivian!"

A child's bright voice cut through the crowd.

Her head snapped up.

Theo was being led toward her by a young woman in a white tee and jeans. The girl couldn't have been older than twenty, yet her sharp gaze carried an edge.

What made Vivian's blood run cold were the eyes.

Those peach-blossom eyes—identical to her own.

"Theo!" She rushed forward and pulled the boy into her arms. "Where were you?"

"I went down the slide with a new friend and got lost." He pointed at the young woman. "This sister helped me find you."

Vivian's stomach dropped when she noticed Theo's smartwatch was missing.

"Where's your watch?"

"I don't know when it fell off." His lower lip wobbled. "I tried calling you."

Every alarm in her mind blared.

She subtly shifted Theo behind her, studying the stranger. "Thank you so much. How can I repay you?"

"No trouble at all." The girl's smile was sweet, but her eyes were glacial. "I'm Annika Heilbronn."

The name hit Vivian like a knife to the chest.

Fragmented memories from training camp sharpened into focus—her mentor once mentioned his star pupil. Annika Heilbronn.

"You—" Her throat tightened.

Annika tilted her head, all innocence. "You look pale. Are you okay?"

Theo tugged Vivian's sleeve. "She looks just like you!"

Vivian forced a smile. "What a coincidence."

Then she spotted it—the faint scar on Annika's right hand. The mark of an organization-issued dagger.

Her blood turned to ice.

This wasn't an accident.

Annika had come for her.
###Chapter 585

Vivian paused after speaking.

"If everything's fine, I'll take my leave." Her gaze swept over Theo. "Keep a close eye on the child. Accidents can be messy."

Theo nodded. "Thank you."

Vivian turned and walked out of the mall.

The moment she stepped outside, she froze.

Zero stood a short distance away.

"Master." Her voice tightened.

His piercing stare made her heart skip a beat.

He'd discovered she'd been following Theo.

"Come here." His tone was icy.

They moved to a secluded spot.

"Explain." Zero cut straight to the point.

Vivian bit her lower lip, her eyes instantly welling up.

"I just wanted to see..." Her voice cracked. "What kind of woman could capture your attention like this."

What she didn't say aloud was that this had been a warning.

If Theo dared cross the line, she wouldn't hesitate to make that child disappear.

"Don't play games." Zero saw right through her act.

Vivian pouted defensively. "I helped her find the kid."

But her heart sank.

Her master was actually protecting that woman.

Even though she was Zero's closest disciple.

"Don't let it happen again." His tone softened slightly. "Keep your identity hidden."

"Yes, Master." Secretly, she felt pleased.

This proved she still held a special place in his heart.

"Mission status?"

"Everything's arranged. No traces will lead back to you."

"Hmm."

......

Theo was still shaken.

"Theo, it's my fault for bringing you somewhere so crowded."

"Not your fault!" Theo shook his head. "I was the one who wandered off. But my new friends were so fun!"

"I'll bring you again next time." She ruffled his hair. "By the way, isn't your uncle your legal guardian now?"

"Yep!"

"Can you give me his number? Just in case of emergencies."

Theo's eyes darted thoughtfully. "Okay!"

He actually gave her the butler's number.

This way, he wouldn't expose his uncle while still having emergency contacts.

Vivian dialed the number.

"Hello." An elderly voice answered.

She blinked in surprise.

Theo's uncle sounded this old?

"Hello, this is Vivian. Theo must have mentioned me?"

The butler certainly knew about this "future aunt."

"Miss Vivian. Actually, I'm not..."
###Chapter 586

The butler was about to speak when Theo impatiently interrupted. "Let me do it!"

The boy's interruption made Vivian miss the butler's next words.

With practiced ease, Theo grabbed Vivian's phone. "Uncle, it's Theo. I'm with Vivian. Don't worry."

He ended the call abruptly and shoved the phone back into her hand.

"Sister, can we go to the mall?" Theo blinked up at her.

Vivian crouched down. "Are you hungry? Should we eat first?"

"Not hungry." He adjusted his mask. "Just want to look around."

"Alright, I'll go with you." She firmly held his small hand.

"By the way, Theo... how old is your uncle?"

"Huh?" The boy tilted his head.

"Just curious. His voice sounded mature on the phone."

Theo tensed internally.

The butler was indeed elderly. If he said something too young, she'd suspect something.

"My uncle... is almost fifty."

"Fifty?" Vivian's eyes widened.

Theo was so young, yet his uncle was already middle-aged?

Her mind immediately conjured a dramatic family scenario: If he was called "uncle," then Theo's father must have been at least in his fifties. A plausible age to pass away.

Combined with Theo's mother abandoning him, it painted a classic picture of a gold-digging woman fleeing with the fortune after her wealthy husband's death.

Her heart ached as she pulled Theo into a sudden embrace.

The boy froze momentarily before melting into his future aunt's warmth.

They spent the afternoon at the mall before parting ways.

At their farewell, Theo's private car waited by the curb.

Watching him leave, Vivian planned tomorrow's prenatal checkup.

Since she'd decided to keep the baby, proper care was essential.

She'd barely rested at home when Inspector Chen called.

"They caught the killer?" Her grip tightened on the phone.

"Solid evidence. The suspect confessed."

"Can I come to the station?"

"Anytime."

After hanging up, something felt off.

If the murder was premeditated, why stage it as suicide? Why erase traces?

At the police station entrance, Vivian collided with Ethan Roscente.

His bar-hopping friend stood beside him.

"Vivian!" Ethan's eyes lit up.

She responded with a neutral "Hmm."

"You got the notice too?" He quickened his pace. "They arrested Sophia Sherwood's killer."
###Chapter 587

Vivian Laurent walked ahead without looking back, leaving Ethan Roscente behind.

Ethan quickened his pace to catch up. "Viv, why didn't you let me pick you up when it's such a long distance?"

Patrick Alpinus raised an eyebrow at the scene. The CEO of Roscente Group was trailing after Vivian like an attendant.

In Patrick's memory, Ethan had always been arrogant and dismissive of women. Countless socialites had tried to approach him, only to be met with cold indifference.

Yet now he was fawning over a woman who seemed completely uninterested in him.

...

The three arrived at the police station together. Officer Chen stepped forward, his gaze lingering on Patrick. "You must be Officer Alpinus?"

"Patrick Alpinus." He extended his hand.

Vivian frowned slightly. A police officer?

Officer Chen said enthusiastically, "Headquarters mentioned sending an Interpol agent to assist - someone who's solved many major cases. I didn't expect you to be so young."

"Flattery won't help. I heard the case is already closed?"

"Yes, the killer just confessed."

Vivian's heart skipped a beat. Interpol? Patrick Alpinus?

She suddenly remembered that every time she operated under her Queen alias, there was always a cop investigating her. Her intel suggested his name might be Patrick Alpinus.

"Could you explain the case in detail?" Patrick asked. "I suspect there's more to this story."

Officer Chen explained the killer was a programmer skilled in computer technology. He had killed Sophia Sherwood after she rejected his advances, then used his skills to erase surveillance evidence.

"There's a problem," Vivian suddenly spoke up.

Patrick raised an eyebrow. "What have you noticed, Ms. Laurent?"

"The knife wound angle is wrong." Vivian analyzed calmly. "Suicide and homicide wounds have completely different trajectories. A programmer couldn't precisely control the blade angle. And..."
###Chapter 588

"No fingerprints were found on the knife." Vivian Laurent tapped the desk lightly. "Ordinary people committing crimes of passion wouldn't remember to wipe prints."

"Sophia Sherwood's body was spotless." She continued, "Not even a single bruise. Doesn't look like she was forced at all."

"Even if she didn't resist, the killer should have scratch marks." Vivian looked up at Inspector Chen. "Did you check?"

Patrick Alpinus frowned deeper. These loopholes were too obvious, almost deliberate.

Inspector Chen nodded: "The investigation is ongoing. Despite the confession, there are indeed too many inconsistencies."

Vivian stood to leave. She could only provide limited clues, and staying wouldn't help.

Ethan Roscente was about to follow when Patrick suddenly lowered his voice: "Your ex-wife is quite remarkable."

"Of course." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "She's my wife."

Patrick rolled his eyes. She hadn't even given him a proper glance.

Outside the precinct, Ethan caught up with Vivian: "Viv."

"You're too invested in this case." He chose his words carefully.

Vivian whirled around: "Spit it out."

"I'm just concerned..."

"That I'm protecting the killer?" Vivian scoffed. "Or concerned about Liam?"

Ethan's pupils contracted. She'd guessed his thoughts exactly.

"Does he have an alibi?"

"He says it wasn't him." Vivian tightened her grip on her bag. "Killing someone in Canada? He's not that stupid."

"What if it was for you?" Ethan stepped closer. "I can tell he's into you."

Vivian laughed humorlessly: "You think everyone has a thing for me?"

"It's different." Ethan's voice darkened. "The way he looks at you—like a predator eyeing prey."

That possessive gaze reminded him of wolves in the wild.

Vivian's heart skipped. Liam had been acting strange lately.

"Baseless speculation is meaningless." She turned toward the street. "Prove it if you can."

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his expression unreadable. That dangerous man needed to be investigated thoroughly.
###Chapter 589

"You're overthinking it," Vivian Laurent said calmly.

Ethan Roscente pressed his lips together as he watched her walk away. He told himself not to worry—with Patrick Alpinus on the case, the truth would come to light.

......

The next morning, Vivian went alone to the hospital for her prenatal checkup.

"The fetus is developing well," the doctor adjusted his glasses. "But you're underweight. You need to improve your nutrition."

On the ultrasound screen, the tiny embryo was barely three months along. Yet Vivian stared intently, her fingers unconsciously brushing the display.

She was already planning for seven months later.

She had to keep it from Ethan. Her plan was to go abroad early, find a quiet place to give birth. But disappearing for half a year under his watchful eye wouldn’t be easy.

Just as she was lost in thought, a violent impact struck from behind.

Bang—

Her car was shoved forward, nearly colliding with the vehicle ahead. The airbag deployed instantly. Instinctively, she shielded her abdomen, but her forehead slammed hard against the steering wheel.

In the distance, Annika Heilbronn watched the accident with cold eyes before slipping away into a surveillance blind spot.

"Tough luck," she muttered through gritted teeth.

Traffic police arrived quickly. Vivian declined the suggestion to go to the hospital, only calling Isabella Langley.

"Are you insane?" Isabella paled when she arrived. "What if something had happened? I’ll get you a driver."

Vivian rubbed her temples. "Fine."

"This accident..."

"Probably just bad timing," Vivian cut her off. "Don’t overthink it."

Isabella hesitated. "Be careful."

......

Sophia Sherwood’s case remained at a standstill. Patrick couldn’t shake the feeling something was off, but he couldn’t find a breakthrough.

After two days of rest, Vivian returned to work at the hospital, assisting Ryan Fairsprene as usual.

"Next patient, Han Xia."

The door opened, and a familiar figure walked in.

Vivian looked up—her pupils constricting sharply.

It was the girl from the mall.
###Chapter 590

Annika widened her eyes in feigned surprise. "Oh my! Aren't you that lady from the mall? I had no idea you were a doctor."

Vivian Laurent looked up with a gentle smile. "What a coincidence. You're Han Xia, right? What seems to be the problem?"

"I took a bad fall a few days ago." Annika rubbed her knee with a pained expression. "The pain keeps getting worse. I can barely walk now."

After a brief examination, Ryan Fairsprene said, "Superficially it doesn't look serious, but we'll need an X-ray to be certain."

"Of course, doctor." Annika bit her lip. "But I'm really struggling to walk..."

Vivian stood up immediately. "Let me help you."

"Wouldn't that be too much trouble?" Annika gave an apologetic look.

"Don't mention it." Vivian supported her arm. "You helped me at the mall last time."

Annika studied Vivian's profile discreetly. The woman's skin glowed with porcelain perfection, her lashes thick and dark. She suppressed the jealousy churning in her chest.

"I never imagined you were a doctor." Annika forced sweetness into her voice. "I'm Han Xia. And you?"

"Vivian Laurent."

"What a beautiful name." Annika dug her nails into her palms.

She remembered everything Master Zero had sacrificed for this woman. The entire organization believed Shadow was dead, yet her master never stopped searching. He'd even injured himself to return to Vivian's side.

"You're trembling." Vivian's voice held concern.

"My foot hurts terribly." Annika managed a weak smile.

After the examination, Annika pulled Vivian onto a hallway bench to chat.

"You must still be in school?" Vivian asked.

Annika shook her head. "My family couldn't afford it. I'm working now."

"Being independent is admirable." Vivian's tone was kind.

"Just menial jobs." Annika lowered her gaze. "I envy you, Dr. Laurent. Beautiful, accomplished... you must have many suitors."

"Hardly." Vivian chuckled. "You're quite lovely yourself."

Annika leaned closer suddenly. "We actually look alike. May I call you sister?"

She searched Vivian's eyes for any reaction. What spell had this woman cast to make Master Zero so obsessed?

The medical report trembled slightly in Annika's grip. She needed to proceed carefully—no missteps. Master's warnings echoed in her mind, but resentment coiled around her heart like a venomous serpent.
###Chapter 591

Vivian Laurent studied the unfamiliar girl before her, her brow slightly furrowed.

"Just call me Dr. Laurent," she said calmly.

Annika Heilbronn's eyes flashed with displeasure, though her smile remained sweet. "My apologies. Someone like me shouldn't presume to be familiar with you."

The words carried an edge, but Vivian dismissed it as youthful sensitivity.

"You misunderstand," she replied evenly. "I simply prefer professional boundaries."

Annika lowered her gaze, her voice tinged with hurt. "I know I'm not welcome here..."

Vivian cut her off. "Let me treat you to lunch. Consider it a celebration of your clean bill of health."

Annika's head snapped up, calculation flickering in her eyes. "I couldn't possibly impose—"

"No need." Vivian turned to organize her files. "Meet me at the hospital entrance at noon."

The restaurant gleamed with crystal chandeliers scattering prismatic light across polished surfaces.

Annika's fingers trembled slightly as she scanned the menu prices.

"I'll...just have the greens and tofu," she murmured timidly.

Vivian took the menu and briskly circled several signature dishes.

Annika clenched her napkin. This woman was deliberately humiliating her with extravagance!

"Excuse me," Vivian stood abruptly. "I need to visit the ladies' room."

At the hostess stand, she produced a black card. "Check for table eight, please."

The server blinked. "The young lady already left a deposit."

Vivian's eyebrow arched. This girl was more cunning than she appeared.

Returning to the table, she caught Annika staring at her water glass with an unreadable expression.

"Food's here," Vivian remarked casually, seating herself. "Try the truffle steak."

Annika forced a smile. "You're too kind, Dr. Laurent."

The clink of silverware underscored their silent tension.

Vivian suddenly spoke. "Those calluses on your hands don't look like they're from menial labor."

Annika's fork stilled.

"I did competitive shooting for years," Vivian continued, methodically cutting her steak. "Gun calluses are distinctive."

The restaurant lights dimmed abruptly.

Annika's smile froze in place.
###Chapter 592

Vivian Laurent finished paying and returned to her seat.

She had only wanted the unfamiliar girl to try a new flavor—nothing more.

Annika Heilbronn stared at Vivian, a flicker of disgust in her eyes.

"Dr. Laurent, I heard doctors have a lot of free time?" Annika picked up a piece of meat. "And that surgeries come with generous tips. Is that true?"

She lowered her voice deliberately. "They say your skills are so exceptional that patients are booked until next year. Does that mean you earn even more?"

Vivian's fingers tightened abruptly.

"That's a misunderstanding," she said coldly. "Doctors don't accept gifts. Surgery schedules are based on medical urgency, not money. No matter how many patients there are, priority isn't for sale."

Vivian hadn’t expected such outdated assumptions to still exist.

And she certainly hadn’t anticipated hearing them from Annika.

Annika smirked, plastering on a fake smile.

"Don’t take it the wrong way, Dr. Laurent. I was just curious." She feigned innocence. "You must be an excellent doctor."

Vivian set down her napkin.

"I need to return to the hospital." She stood. "These dishes haven’t been touched—you can take them to-go. The bill is settled. If your leg hurts, take a cab back."

She placed a few bills on the table.

Vivian genuinely wanted to help the girl.

Hearing about her tragic background had stirred Vivian’s compassion.

At eighteen, she should have been carefree, like Emily Garnache and her friends.

A meal and cab fare were small gestures.

But she didn’t realize these acts only deepened Annika’s resentment.

"Fake kindness," Annika muttered the moment Vivian left, slamming her chopsticks down.

She glared at the money, her expression dark.

"Who needs your pathetic charity?"

The more she thought about it, the angrier she grew.

Vivian must have been flaunting her superiority—using petty favors to manipulate people.

Master Zero favored her only because she’d fooled him with her saintly act.

"I can do better than her," Annika clenched her fists.

She resembled Vivian but was younger.

If she mastered Vivian’s tricks, Master Zero would finally notice her.

Annika decided to get closer to Vivian.

She would expose the hypocrite’s true nature.
###Chapter 593

Vivian Laurent had been feeling off lately.

She couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong, but an unsettling sensation clung to her—the distinct feeling of being watched.

That invisible gaze followed her everywhere, sending chills down her spine.

Today at the mall, the familiar prickle of surveillance returned.

She deliberately took the escalator up, slipped into the restroom, then exited through a side door.

She wanted to catch her stalker.

Annika Heilbronn was about to follow when a hand clamped around her wrist.

"Master?" She whirled around in shock.

Liam Valdemar stood behind her, his expression glacial.

"Are you tailing her?" His voice was arctic.

Annika lowered her head in panic.

Words failed her.

"You've been made." Liam cut her off.

"Impossible! I maintained a safe distance." Her eyes widened in disbelief.

For the past two days, she'd been shadowing Vivian.

She'd also been the one creating minor inconveniences—nothing lethal.

Jealousy festered in her chest over Liam's special attention toward Vivian.

"Leave. Now." The command brooked no argument.

"But Master—"

"Go!"

Annika bit her lip and stalked away, resentment burning in her chest.

She knew she'd angered him.

Once certain she was gone, Liam approached Vivian's hiding spot.

Vivian emerged from the shadows, intercepting him.

"It was you?" Her eyes narrowed.

"Is something wrong?" Liam remained impassive.

"Someone's been following me these past days. Was it you?"

"Yes."

"Why?" Vivian frowned.

She'd assumed it was an enemy, not Liam.

"Protection."

"I don't need protection."

Liam shook his head. "It's dangerous. Someone might target you."

"Who could possibly hurt me?" She arched a brow confidently.

"I know you're capable." He paused. "That Roscente nuisance—shall I eliminate him for you?"

Vivian froze.

"He hurt you before." Deadly intent flashed in Liam's eyes. "His son too. I'll handle them both."

"Don't!" She grabbed his arm. "Murder solves nothing."

"Can't bear to lose him?" Liam searched her face.

"That's not the point."

"You're avoiding the truth." His voice softened. "But I'll always stand with you."

Vivian's breath hitched.

Ethan's words about Liam's feelings surfaced in her mind.

The attention from these powerful men unsettled her.

She preferred solitude—no protectors, no complications.
###Chapter 594

Vivian set down her chopsticks and met Liam's gaze directly.

"Liam, it's time you started living for yourself."

Her voice was soft, yet sharp as a blade slicing through their long-standing understanding.

Liam's fingers tapped lightly against the tabletop.

"Protecting you is how I live."

Steam rose between them from the simmering hot pot.

Vivian shook her head, sliding a plate of tender beef into the broth.

"I don't need protection anymore. See? I can cook my own food, earn my own money, solve my own problems now."

His eyes tracked her practiced movements.

"But you needed me before."

The beef darkened swiftly in the boiling broth.

Vivian picked up a slice and placed it in Liam's bowl.

"That was then. Now, I'd rather see you cook a slice for yourself."

Liam stared at the meat in his bowl, silent for a long moment.

"Try it. This place is famous for their beef."

Vivian attempted to shift the topic.

Finally, Liam picked up his chopsticks.

"It's good."

His voice came out rough.

"Right? I specifically chose this restaurant."

A satisfied smile curved Vivian's lips.

Liam suddenly looked up.

"If this is what you want—"

"It is."

Vivian cut him off.

The air between them froze.

Nearby, Annika's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Watching Liam pour Vivian a drink made her eyes burn.

Her always-stoic mentor moved with uncharacteristic tenderness.

Annika's gaze lingered on Vivian's face.

That face...

A mad idea took root in her mind.

If she had that face...

She discreetly snapped a photo of Vivian's profile.

Slipping out of the restaurant, her fingers flew across her phone screen.

"Hello, I'd like to inquire about facial reconstruction."

A polite voice responded.

Annika spoke softly but with conviction.

"Yes, the most natural adjustments possible."

She glanced back through the window.

Liam was serving Vivian food, a rare smile playing on his lips.

The sight pierced Annika's heart like needles.

"Multiple sessions. Tiny changes each time."

Hanging up, she cast one last look at the man who haunted her dreams.

"Master Zero, you'll be mine soon."

Madness flickered in Annika's eyes as she strode toward the nearest plastic surgery clinic.

This time, she'd stop at nothing.
###Chapter 595 

Vivian Laurent was flipping through a magazine on the couch when Isabella Langley's text popped up. Her eyes lit up as she immediately replied, "Sounds great."

She really needed some fresh air. The recent work pressure had been intense, and this was the perfect chance to unwind.

After setting the time, Isabella arrived at Vivian's place a day early with her suitcase. They spent the evening applying face masks and chatting until late into the night.

...

At the Roscente mansion, little Theo Evans had just finished his bath, his hair still damp. Clutching his teddy bear, he sidled up to Ethan Roscente.

"Uncle..." the boy mumbled.

Ethan set aside his documents and ruffled Theo's hair. "What's wrong?"

"I miss Mommy." Theo bit his lip. "She hasn't called me in so long."

Ethan's expression darkened. Though Theo had been getting along well with Vivian lately, Sophia Evans had raised him for five years.

"Mommy's very busy with work overseas," he said gently. "How about Uncle takes you to Disneyland tomorrow?"

Theo looked down, tears welling in his eyes. "Did Mommy abandon me?"

Ethan's heart clenched. He immediately dialed Sophia's number.

The moment the call connected, Sophia's shrill voice came through. "Theo! Mommy misses you so much! It's all that Vivian Laurent's fault for keeping us apart!"

"She's nothing but a homewrecker! Once your uncle marries her, they'll throw you away!"

Ethan snatched the phone away. "Sophia! Have you lost your mind?"

He hung up and pulled the trembling boy into a tight embrace. "Uncle would never abandon you."

Theo sniffled. "I miss Auntie Vivian..."

Something stirred in Ethan's chest as he dialed Vivian's number for the boy.

"Theo!" Vivian's bright voice chimed through the speaker. "Why haven't you come to play with me lately?"

Hearing her voice, Theo's tears turned to laughter. Unconsciously, Ethan's lips curved upward.

"I've missed you too," Vivian said, immediately sensing something amiss. "Are you crying?"

"N-no..."

"Don't lie to me." Her tone softened. "Did that irresponsible uncle of yours bully you again?"

She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "He's already getting old yet still never stays home. Since when is work more important than our Theo?"

Ethan raised an eyebrow. Old?

He was only thirty.
###Chapter 596

Ethan Roscente frowned slightly.

At only twenty-eight, how had Theo Evans labeled him as "old"?

What strange ideas had Vivian Laurent been putting in the child's head?

Theo clutched the phone with tiny hands, his voice sweet and soft. "Uncle Ethan is home with me. He's so nice to me. Vivian, do I bother you when I call so much?"

"Of course not," Vivian's gentle voice floated through the receiver. "I'm always happy when you call me."

Theo's eyes brightened.

Unlike his mother who always seemed annoyed by him, Vivian never made him feel like a nuisance.

"Vivian, will you stay with me forever?"

The perceptive woman immediately caught the sadness in his tone. "Are you missing your mom?"

"Yeah..." Theo's voice dropped to a whisper. "Mom says I'm annoying..."

Vivian's heart clenched.

This poor child had been hurt by his own mother's cruel words.

"Maybe she was just having a bad day. You can always talk to me, okay? Would you like me to tell you a bedtime story?"

"Yes!"

Their conversation lasted much longer than expected.

Eventually, Theo drifted off to sleep listening to Vivian's soothing fairy tale.

Ethan had remained silent the entire time, barely daring to breathe lest Vivian discover he was listening.

He never knew Vivian could be so good with children.

Sophia Evans only ever used Theo as a pawn, but Vivian genuinely cared for the boy.

"Theo? Are you asleep?" Vivian's soft inquiry came through the phone.

Ethan glanced down at the sleeping child in his arms and quietly stopped the recording.

"Goodnight."

That simple farewell from Vivian warmed Ethan's heart in ways he couldn't explain.

All his exhaustion from work miraculously melted away.

After hanging up, he whispered to the silent phone, "Goodnight."

That night, both uncle and nephew slept more peacefully than they had in months.

At 6:30 the next morning, Theo came bouncing onto Ethan's bed.

"Uncle Ethan! Wake up!"

Rubbing his eyes, Ethan checked his watch. "This early?"

"You promised to take me shopping!" Theo's eyes sparkled with excitement. "I want to get Vivian the best present ever!"

Ethan chuckled. "Alright, let's go."

After breakfast, they headed straight to the mall.

Theo tugged Ethan's hand excitedly as they weaved through the designer boutiques.

"Vivian would look so pretty in this dress!"

"Ooh! Do you think she'd like this sparkly necklace?"

The enthusiastic boy practically wanted to buy out the entire mall for Vivian.
###Chapter 597

Sunlight streamed through the glass dome of the shopping mall. Vivian Laurent walked side by side with Isabella Langley through the bustling crowd.

Isabella's arms were already laden with shopping bags, her face glowing with satisfaction.

"You might as well buy out the entire floor," Vivian teased.

Isabella sniffed playfully. "Where's the fun in that? I enjoy picking each item carefully."

Her eyes suddenly lit up as she grabbed Vivian's hand. "Since you've decided to keep the baby, I need to start preparing gifts as the godmother."

"Isn't it too early for that?" Vivian shook her head with a smile.

"Not at all!" Isabella exclaimed excitedly. "I'll buy everything for both boys and girls. Maybe we can catch some Black Friday sales too!"

Vivian gave her an exasperated look. "The ultrasound showed just one baby."

"I don't care. I'm going to be the best godmother ever." Isabella pulled her toward the elevator.

They arrived at the maternity section on the third floor. The dazzling array of products made Isabella's head spin.

"These bottles are adorable!"
"We must get the safest stroller!"
"Oh my god, look at these tiny socks!"

Isabella moved through the store like an explorer discovering new territory. A sales associate immediately approached to showcase various products.

"This imported—"
"Take it!"
"Our newest model—"
"Wrap it up!"

Within half an hour, Isabella had spent nearly a million. She reviewed the lengthy receipt with satisfaction before giving the delivery address.

"Send everything to my place first," Vivian whispered. "Ethan visits often."

Isabella nodded in understanding. "Right, we can't let him find out."

As they exited, the display window of a children's boutique caught Isabella's attention.

"Let's check out the kids' clothes!" She dragged Vivian inside.

The store offered everything from infant onesies to stylish elementary school outfits.

While admiring a tiny suit, Vivian suddenly froze.

Near the window seating area, Ethan Roscente sat watching them.

Vivian's heart dropped. There could only be one reason for Ethan to be in a children's clothing store—

"Vivian?" Ethan spotted her and stood up in surprise.

Isabella immediately stepped between them. "Talk about bad luck. Let's go."

Just then, a dressing room door opened.

"Uncle Ethan, how do I like in this?"

The childish voice made Vivian stop dead in her tracks.
###Chapter 598

Vivian Laurent froze mid-turn, her pupils contracting sharply.

A little boy stood by the dressing room door, his delicate face etched with panic.

The crisp new plaid shirt made him look adorably well-behaved. But what shocked Vivian most was—

That face.

Without the mask obscuring his features, the resemblance to Ethan Roscente was unmistakable.

Her nails dug into her palms as her chest heaved violently.

"You liar..."

Now she understood why Theo always wore a mask. Why he'd claimed to have no father.

It had all been Ethan's carefully constructed deception.

"Miss Vivian..." Theo stood frozen, his large eyes brimming with tears.

Isabella Langley gasped, pointing at the child. "Isn't that the boy who visited your home?"

Vivian's lips curled into a mirthless smile as she shot Ethan a razor-sharp glare. "Bravo."

She pivoted on her heel, stilettoes striking the marble floor with furious precision.

Ethan immediately gave chase. "Vivian!"

Theo stumbled after them on short legs. "Miss Vivian, don't go!"

Isabella stood dumbfounded until a sales associate intercepted her. "Ma'am, the child's clothing hasn't been paid for..."

"What?" Isabella's eyes widened. "I barely know them!"

"Then you'll need to contact them immediately. Otherwise, we'll have to involve the police."

Gritting her teeth, Isabella produced a black card. "How much?"

This debt would be repaid.

——

A dull thud echoed through the boutique.

Theo lay sprawled on the floor, his face scrunched in pain. "Ow..."

Ethan skidded to a halt, whirling back. "Theo!"

Kneeling, he carefully examined the boy's knees, voice tight with concern. "Where does it hurt?"

"My ankle..." Theo sniffled.

The sound made Vivian's steps falter at the exit.

Her medical instincts had her gripping her handbag strap until her knuckles whitened.
###Chapter 599

Vivian's footsteps halted in the mall corridor.

She knew she shouldn't look back, yet her legs turned against her will.

Little Theo sat on the floor while Ethan Roscente crouched beside him, examining his injury.

"Move aside. Let me check."

The cool voice came from above. Ethan looked up into Vivian's furious eyes.

"What are you waiting for? Are you a doctor?"

Ethan snapped out of his daze and quickly stood aside.

Vivian knelt and gently rolled up Theo's pant leg. "Where does it hurt?"

Though her tone was brusque, concern flickered in her eyes.

Theo suddenly clung to her arm.

"I'm sorry, sis. I didn't really get hurt." His eyes welled with tears. "I lied because I didn't want you to leave."

Vivian's head jerked up toward Ethan. "You're really his uncle?"

She'd assumed it was all a fabricated story.

Ethan actually had an older brother? Her investigation files contained no such information.

"Yes, I'm his uncle." Ethan's voice lowered. "Theo is my elder brother's child. Will you give us a chance to explain?"

Vivian's heart skipped a beat.

Those "Auntie" addresses, those comments about her resemblance to Theo's aunt—they weren't just childish nonsense.

"Auntie, please don't go." Theo clung tighter to her arm. "I'll explain everything."

Vivian took a deep breath but still checked Theo's ankle. "You're sure you're not hurt?"

Theo bit his lip hesitantly.

If he told the truth, would Auntie walk away?

"No injury." The boy finally shook his head. "Don't be mad, Auntie."

Only after confirming he was unharmed did Vivian scoop him up.

"Did you pay for those new clothes?"

Ethan smacked his forehead. "Forgot."

Vivian nearly rolled her eyes.

"Go pay." Her voice turned icy. "We'll wait here."

Isabella Langley's angry voice carried from nearby.

"Trying to skip out on the bill? Expecting me to pay? Ethan Roscente, you've got some nerve!"

She stormed over and slapped the receipt against Ethan's chest. "Triple the amount. Now."

Ethan nodded. "Transferring immediately."

Only then did Isabella notice Vivian holding Theo's hand. She exploded. "Why are you still holding that brat? Let his father deal with him!"

Her glare softened slightly when she looked at Theo.

Despite hating Ethan, she had to admit the kid was adorable.

The thought that this might be Ethan's love child made her blood boil again.
###Chapter 600

"They promised me an explanation," Vivian murmured softly.

Isabella scoffed, curling her lip. "Since when can you trust a man's words? He's probably spinning some elaborate lie."

Theo tugged at Vivian's sleeve insistently. "Auntie, Theo and Uncle would never lie to you!"

"Auntie?" Isabella blinked in confusion.

Theo puffed out his little chest proudly. "This is my auntie!"

Vivian decided to hear Ethan out. Even if it was a lie, she wanted to see how he'd weave this tale.

"If we're doing explanations, let's all hear it together. There's a nice café downstairs."

Ethan gave a stiff nod.

The four settled into the café.

"I want that!" Theo pointed excitedly at a coffee illustration on the menu.

Vivian gently stopped him. "Children shouldn't drink coffee. How about juice instead?"

"Then Auntie has to drink juice too." Theo obediently scooted closer to Vivian.

When their drinks arrived, Vivian met Ethan's gaze directly. "Well?"

Ethan's eyes flickered to Theo, pain flashing across his features. "I have an older half-brother who lived abroad. Theo is his son."

He paused. "This was the Roscente family's best-kept secret. My mother... she had a fiery temper. When she found out, she divorced my father immediately."

"My brother was kind to me. Gentle by nature. Then he met Sophia Evans."

"There was never anything between Sophia and me. By family hierarchy, she was my sister-in-law."

"When I rushed overseas years ago, it wasn't to chase Sophia. My brother had a car accident in Eudora. Sophia had just discovered she was pregnant."

Vivian's pupils contracted. This wasn't the truth she'd expected.

"Your brother...?" Her voice trembled.

"Didn't make it." Ethan's tone turned gravelly. "I was in an accident too. Never got to say goodbye."

Those months of leg injuries had made him volatile.

"After my brother's death, Sophia stayed abroad for her pregnancy. Once I recovered, I looked after her. Theo was premature. Fragile. Sophia's health was never strong either."

"Theo is my brother's only legacy. All these years overseas—I was caring for them."

Vivian reeled. Theo was truly Ethan's nephew?

Isabella remained skeptical. "Then why publicly claim Theo as your son?"

"Sophia deliberately let Theo get photographed. The media ran wild with theories—illegitimate child, scandal. The vitriol was unbearable."

"I couldn't let Theo endure that. Claiming him as mine was the only way."
###Chapter 601

Vivian Laurent's heart ached as she looked at the obedient little boy before her.

How could those unscrupulous media outlets attack a child with such vicious words?

"Sophia Evans has always liked you, hasn't she? How did she end up pregnant with your brother's child?" Vivian couldn't help asking.

Ethan Roscente shook his head. "I don't know the specifics."

"So you deliberately arranged for Theo to get close to me?" Vivian pressed further.

"I merely mentioned you to Theo," Ethan explained. "Told him he had a beautiful and capable aunt. The boy wanted to meet you. That time at the hospital—he sneaked out to see you on his own."

Suddenly everything made sense to Vivian.

No wonder Theo always wore a mask—he was afraid she'd recognize his resemblance to Ethan.

"What about the phone number you gave me..."

"The butler's," Ethan admitted.

Vivian fell silent.

No wonder the middle-aged man had sounded so hesitant.

Looking back, all the pieces fell into place.

Ethan's sudden appearance when she injured her hand.

Their "chance" meeting outside her office building.

Theo calling her to the bar that night.

Even during her overseas mission when Theo asked for detailed itineraries...

It had all been orchestrated by Ethan.

"I can testify!" Theo raised his small hand. "Uncle Ethan's telling the truth. My mom is Sophia Evans, but I don't have a dad. Uncle Ethan treats me really well, and so does Aunt Vivian!"

Vivian quickly waved her hands. "Theo, don't call me that. I'm not your aunt yet."

"But you are!" Theo's eyes sparkled. "I didn't get to see you at the wedding, but you take me out to play, ask if I'm hungry, never get annoyed with me..."

Seeing the hope in the child's eyes, Vivian couldn't bring herself to reject him outright.

But this was Sophia's child...

Theo suddenly lowered his head. "I get it. Aunt Vivian doesn't like me. I won't bother you anymore."

"That's not true!" Vivian immediately crouched down. "I don't dislike you, it's just..."

Her heart softened at the boy's crestfallen expression.

Knowing Sophia's personality, she probably wasn't a good mother.

"You can contact me anytime," Vivian finally relented. "But I have one condition."

Theo immediately looked up. "What condition?"
###Chapter 602

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on Vivian Laurent's face, waiting for her to state her terms.

His heartbeat quickened, fearing she might refuse.

Theo's affection for Vivian was undeniable. Losing his playmate would devastate the little boy.

"Stop calling me Auntie." Vivian's tone brooked no argument. "We're divorced. Agree to this, and I'll keep playing with you."

Theo looked helplessly at Ethan.

"But you're my only Auntie," the child pouted.

Vivian crouched to his eye level. "Call me Sister, like before."

"Okay... Sister," Theo mumbled reluctantly.

A smile bloomed on Vivian's face. "Good boy. Let's go shopping for new clothes and treats later."

Now that secrets were out, their outing should proceed smoothly.

"Yay!" Theo clapped excitedly.

Ethan immediately interjected, "I'm coming too."

"I only invited Theo," Vivian said coldly.

"I'll tag along with him," Ethan replied shamelessly.

Isabella Langley cut in sharply, "No way! Even if the kid isn't yours, you're still trouble. Vivian shouldn't spend time with you!"

She resolved to investigate the truth, suspecting this uncle-nephew duo might be conspiring against Vivian.

Ethan sighed. "Treat me as your wallet. Spend however you want."

"Dream on!" Isabella rolled her eyes.

Defeated, Ethan conceded, "Call me when you're done. I'll pick Theo up."

Though he hadn't made progress, at least Sophia's misunderstanding about Theo had been cleared.

He believed their relationship would improve now that the truth was out.

"Bye, Uncle!" Theo waved obediently.

Ethan turned to Vivian. "Theo loved your bedtime story last night. He left a gift for you in the car."

"How thoughtful," Vivian said gently.

Suddenly, Ethan frowned. "Why were you at a children's boutique?"

The store sold exclusively kids' clothing. What would two single women be doing there?

Vivian instinctively covered her abdomen.

Quick thinking saved her. "We wanted to buy Theo clothes. Great minds think alike!"

Theo beamed. "Really? But I have lots of clothes!"

"More won't hurt," Vivian laughed. "We'll get enough for daily changes!"
###Chapter 603

Vivian Laurent held Theo Evans' hand as they entered the mall with Isabella Langley.

Theo bounced happily between them, clutching both women's hands.

Ethan Roscente watched them leave, a faint smile touching his lips.

As long as Vivian didn't reject Theo, that was enough.

The sensitive boy feared nothing more than being unwanted.

Vivian headed straight for the children's wear section.

She selected several new outfits and guided Theo toward the fitting room.

"Do you believe what Ethan said?" Isabella whispered.

Vivian adjusted a hanger without looking up. "Who knows?"

"What if he fabricated the whole story? He was utterly devoted to Sophia Evans back then."

Vivian's hands stilled. "Theo wouldn't lie."

Isabella gave her a knowing look. "You're secretly pleased, aren't you?"

Vivian merely hummed in response.

Theo emerged wearing a new outfit and spun like a runway model.

"How do I look?"

Vivian's eyes lit up. "Perfect!"

Isabella nodded approvingly. "Much better than those stuffy clothes Ethan picked."

After shopping, they went to a restaurant.

Vivian carefully placed a shrimp dumpling on Theo's plate. "Try this."

Theo puffed his cheeks. "Thank you, Vivian!"

"This steamed bun is delicious too." Isabella added one to his plate.

Theo grinned. "Thanks, pretty lady!"

Watching the boy enjoy his meal warmed Vivian's heart.

She decided to buy him a golden locket as a gift.

The trio headed toward the jewelry store, chatting happily.

A shrill voice cut through the air.

"Vivian Laurent!"

Victoria Roscente stood nearby, her face dark with fury.

Her burning gaze locked onto Vivian's hand holding Theo's.

After weeks in seclusion, she'd finally ventured out today.

Of all people to encounter, it had to be Vivian.

And the woman dared to hold Sophia's child!

Victoria's nails dug into her palms.

Sophia had disappeared, her beauty destroyed—all because of this woman.

Now she'd even stolen the child!

Blind rage consumed her.

Victoria lunged forward, her hand swinging toward Vivian's face.
###Chapter 604

Vivian's eyes turned icy cold.

As Victoria swung her hand to slap her, Vivian caught the wrist with precision.

A swift judo throw sent Victoria crashing onto the floor.

Sunglasses and hat scattered everywhere.

Vivian looked down at her with contempt. "Well, if it isn't Miss Roscente. Back for more punishment?"

Her tone dripped with mockery.

Victoria scrambled up, eyes blazing. "How dare you hit me? I'm calling the police!"

Vivian scoffed. "Go ahead. The surveillance cameras captured everything. You threw the first punch."

"Vivian!" Victoria ground her teeth. "This isn't over between us!"

"What exactly is between us?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "I don't recall owing you anything."

Victoria's face twisted with rage. "These past months have been hell! I want to see you suffer!"

"Watch your words." Vivian's voice turned dangerous. "Everything you say is being recorded as evidence."

"Stop threatening me!" Victoria suddenly yanked Theo forward. "Do you know who this is? The little bastard who ruined my mother's face!"

Theo whimpered in pain, tears welling up. "Aunt Vivian isn't bad!"

"She's a bitch!" Victoria jerked his arm violently. "You're coming with me!"

Theo struggled desperately. "No! I won't!"

Vivian seized Victoria's wrist. "Let him go!"

"He's my nephew!" Victoria screamed hysterically.

Theo suddenly ducked his head.

His teeth sank into Victoria's hand.

"Ah!" Victoria shrieked in pain.

Her free hand swung back in retaliation—a vicious slap aimed at the child.
###Chapter 605

A sharp slap echoed through the hallway.

Theo's pale cheek immediately flushed red with the imprint of a hand.

He bit his lip, tears welling in his eyes but refusing to fall.

"Victoria Roscente, have you lost your mind?" Vivian Laurent shielded Theo behind her.

Victoria shook her stinging hand with a cold laugh. "Since when do you get a say in how I discipline my nephew?"

She lifted her chin arrogantly. "Don't think cozying up to a child will get you into the Roscente family. I've seen plenty of gold-diggers like you."

Before she could finish, Vivian retaliated with a backhanded slap.

Victoria staggered back two steps, clutching her face in disbelief. "You dare hit me?"

"That was for Theo." Vivian's gaze turned icy. "Only cowards hit children."

Victoria shrieked and lunged forward.

Vivian effortlessly caught her wrist, twisting it with practiced ease.

Slap!

A second strike landed harder than the first.

"That was to teach you manners." Vivian's voice dropped dangerously low. "One more disrespectful word, and you'll end up like Sophia Evans."

Victoria's cheeks burned. "My father will destroy you!"

"Still hiding behind the Roscente name?" Vivian smirked. "Pathetic."

Victoria trembled with rage, her raised hand frozen mid-air.

"Go ahead," Vivian challenged, staring directly into her eyes.

Under the hallway lights, Vivian's gaze chilled like arctic ice.

"I promise you," she enunciated each word, "if you lay one finger on me, I'll break your entire arm."

Victoria's hand remained suspended.

"Remember this." Vivian stepped closer. "Every action you take against me will be repaid tenfold."

She turned and took Theo's hand, walking away without a backward glance.

Victoria stood rooted to the spot, her palms slick with cold sweat.
###Chapter 606

Victoria Roscente staggered back half a step under Vivian Laurent's piercing glare.

Whispers rippled through the crowd as curious onlookers turned their attention to the scene.

"You'll pay for this!" Victoria hissed through clenched teeth.

Her stiletto heels clicked sharply against the pavement as she stormed away.

Vivian immediately knelt to examine Theo's face.

"Aunt Viv, I'm okay." The boy shook his head, blinking back tears.

But the angry red mark stood out starkly against his swollen cheek.

"Let's get some medicine." Vivian took Theo's small hand in hers.

Isabella Langley hurried toward a nearby restaurant. "I'll fetch ice."

Inside the pharmacy, Vivian carefully selected an anti-inflammatory ointment.

Isabella returned quickly with a bag of ice cubes.

Vivian pressed the cold compress gently against Theo's injured cheek.

"That woman's insane!" Isabella fumed.

"The Roscente family breeds madness." Vivian applied the cream with steady fingers.

"If I'd been there, I would've—" Isabella mimed a violent twisting motion.

Vivian chuckled. "Next time, I'll let you handle it."

"Why does she hate you so much?" Isabella asked.

Vivian glanced at Theo. "Not here."

After treating the injury, Vivian dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

Ethan arrived with thunderous fury darkening his features.

"Victoria did this?"

"Your sister just assaulted your son." Vivian stated calmly.

Ethan scooped Theo into his arms. "I'll deal with this."

As father and son departed, Isabella immediately demanded answers.

Vivian recounted the incident at the high tea party.

Isabella's eyes widened. "She deserved it!"

"Karma always collects its due." She crossed her arms indignantly.

Vivian tucked away the medicine bag. "Enough about her."

Though the golden locket remained unpurchased, Theo's thoughtful gesture warmed her heart.

...

Tension crackled through the Roscente mansion's grand foyer.

Victoria clutched her cheek dramatically. "Ethan, Vivian hit me!"

"Apologize to Theo." Ethan's voice held Arctic chill.

"Why should I?" Victoria shrieked.

"Because you laid hands on my son." Each word fell like a hammer strike.
###Chapter 607

"So what if I hit Theo? He deserved it for biting me!"

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned razor-sharp. "You dragged him by the arm while he screamed in pain. Did you think I wouldn't see the security footage?" The video clearly showed Victoria Roscente violently yanking the child before he retaliated.

"I'm his aunt! Why would I hurt him?" Victoria shrieked. "Ethan, Theo is Sophia's child. Why are you letting Vivian Laurent take care of him?"

"None of your business." Ethan's voice was glacial. "Theo can choose who he sees as a mother. Apologize now, or you'll never see him again."

Victoria clenched her teeth and forced an apology. Theo, ever the gentle soul, forgave her easily.

This only fueled Victoria's rage. Being humiliated by a child was unbearable.

She arranged a meeting with Bianca Semona to vent—the only so-called friend who still tolerated her these days.

Victoria gripped a fruit knife, slamming a plastic doll onto the table. In her mind, it was Vivian. The blade plunged into the doll's chest with savage force.

"Die! Just die!" She hacked off the limbs, gouged out the eyes, and finally twisted the head clean off with a sickening crack.

Bianca feigned concern. "Don't ruin your health over this. You'll only give Vivian more reason to laugh at you."

Internally, she sneered. The once-untouchable Roscente heiress was now a social pariah—no respectable family would marry her after the scandals.

"I can't take it anymore!" Victoria drove the knife through the doll's severed head. "That smug look on her face!"

"Your brother has been..." Bianca ventured carefully. "Why not bring Theo out? I could help watch him."

"You?" Victoria scoffed. "Ethan would never allow it."

"Worth a try." Bianca lowered her voice. "Or would you rather watch Vivian become Mrs. Roscente and kick you out of the family?"

Victoria's eyes darkened. "Fine. But I want Vivian to suffer worse than death."

"Deal." Bianca's smile curled with calculation.

"How's your father's health?"

"He needs a stent." Bianca sighed. "But the chief surgeon is handling it. Should be fine."

Victoria nodded absently. Her mind was consumed with visions of torturing Vivian.

In the shadows, Annika Heilbronn smirked.

Vivian's enemies were multiplying faster than expected.
###Chapter 608

Vivian Laurent had just stepped through the hospital doors when Dr. Lee from the cardiology department intercepted her.

"Dr. Laurent, Chief Wang needs you in the OR immediately. There's an emergency."

Vivian quickened her pace. "What happened?"

"An unexpected lesion was discovered during a bypass surgery. Chief Wang is uncertain how to proceed."

She swiftly changed into surgical scrubs and strode into the operating room.

"Chief Wang?"

Beads of sweat dotted the chief surgeon's forehead. "Dr. Laurent, look at this vascular obstruction. It wasn't detected in the preoperative scans."

Vivian leaned closer, her brow furrowing slightly.

"My hands are shaking, and the residents lack experience," Chief Wang admitted tightly. "You're our only hope."

She took the instruments without hesitation. "I'll handle it."

Her movements were precise and efficient. Within twenty minutes, the lesion was successfully removed.

"Incredible," the residents whispered in awe.

Chief Wang exhaled in relief. "We owe you one."

"Just doing my job." Vivian peeled off her gloves. "The patient is stable now."

Outside the OR, Mrs. Semona paced anxiously.

"Mom, please sit down," Bianca Semona urged, guiding her mother to a chair. "Dad will be fine."

The operating light flicked off. A doctor emerged. "The surgery was successful."

Mrs. Semona burst into tears.

"Bianca, go thank Chief Wang with some fruit," her mother instructed.

Bianca carried a fruit basket to Chief Wang's office.

"You should thank Dr. Vivian Laurent from General Surgery," the chief demurred. "She saved your father's life."

Bianca's fingers clenched around the basket. "Vivian?"

"Yes. Her expertise made all the difference."

Bianca's expression darkened instantly.

She marched to the General Surgery Department and stopped a nurse. "Where's Dr. Vivian Laurent?"

The nurse pointed down the hallway. "That's her right there."

Bianca turned. Her pupils contracted sharply.

The face she despised most was walking toward her.
###Chapter 609

Wasn't Vivian Laurent a fashion designer? At Victoria Roscente's high tea party, she had proudly introduced herself as the founder of AN Atelier while playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.3 flawlessly.

Now she was masquerading as a doctor?

Bianca Semona stood at the corridor corner, coldly observing Vivian discussing a case with a group of physicians in lab coats.

Her grip tightened around her purse strap before she turned sharply.

Even if Vivian had saved her father, she wouldn't feel grateful.

Annika Heilbronn trailed behind Bianca, lips curling into an amused smirk.

This drama kept getting more interesting.

Vivian had saved the person Bianca cherished most - while being the very woman Bianca despised.

She'd overheard their conversation outside the operating room.

The Semona family depended entirely on that patriarch. If their pillar collapsed...

Annika's eyes narrowed.

Making a postoperative patient disappear quietly would be child's play.

This time, not even the Pacific Ocean could wash Vivian clean.

......

Vivian had just removed her lab coat when Nathan Clementson's call came through.

"Free for your senior?"

"What's up?"

"An international oncology summit next week. We want you as keynote speaker."

His voice carried through the receiver. "Your research on targeted cancer therapy could inspire peers."

"Venue?"

"Seattle Convention Center. Details are in your inbox."

"Should I use my real name?"

"Obviously. Vivian Laurent carries more weight in medical circles than Dr. Luna ever could."

A soft chuckle. "I'll prepare proper slides then."

"Appreciate it."

"Since when do we stand on ceremony?" Vivian hung up, rubbing her stiff shoulders.

Dawn broke crisp and clear.

Vivian barely stepped through hospital doors before yesterday's attending physician intercepted her.

"Dr. Laurent! Emergency!"

"Breathe first."

"The postoperative patient... sudden deterioration!"

Vivian froze. "All vitals were stable during last night's rounds."

"Within an hour of ICU discharge this morning - multiple organ failure! Code Blue in progress!"

Her face paled as she sprinted toward the OR.

Never in her career had a procedure gone so catastrophically wrong.

By arrival, the monitor already showed a flatline.

Chief Wang removed his mask with a grim shake. "Time of death - 9:17 AM."

"How do we explain this to the family..."
###Chapter 610

Vivian Laurent stared blankly at the flatline on the ECG monitor beneath the surgical lights.

That heart had been beating strongly in the chest cavity just yesterday.

The surgery had been textbook perfect.

"Time of death, 9:17 AM," the nurse announced softly.

Vivian pressed her fingers against the patient's cold carotid artery. No pulse.

"All post-op vitals were normal. Why the sudden deterioration?" Her hands trembled slightly as she flipped through the medical chart.

Chief Wang removed his glasses and rubbed his temples. "I'll notify the family."

He'd known the Semonas for over a decade. Never imagined this would be how it ended.

"File a police report first." Vivian closed the file. "The family might react... strongly."

The antiseptic smell in the hallway suddenly felt suffocating.

Vivian leaned back in her office chair, gaze fixed on the anatomical diagram across the wall.

Her scalpel had avoided every critical zone with precision.

Where had she gone wrong?

——

"Dad—!"

Bianca Semona's scream shattered the ER's quiet.

Mrs. Semona collapsed onto a hallway bench.

"Mom! Somebody help!" Bianca cradled her mother's limp body, tears splashing onto the ashen face.

The resuscitation room lights flickered on.

Bianca slid down the wall, nails digging into her palms.

Yesterday the doctors said the surgery was successful.

Why couldn't she even say goodbye?

"We need time to determine the cause of death," the attending physician offered tissues.

Bianca slapped them away. "Time? My father had time to wait?"

She grabbed the doctor's lab coat. "It was Vivian, wasn't it? She killed him on purpose!"

"Dr. Laurent followed protocol—"

"Bullshit!" Bianca's shriek echoed down the corridor. "This was revenge!"

The nurses' station phone crashed to the floor.

"I'm calling the police! You're all murderers!" Her trembling fingers dialed 911. "None of you are getting away with this!"

A resident tried restraining her. "Please calm down—"

Bianca shoved him aside and sprinted toward the elevators.

The metal doors reflected her distorted silhouette.
###Chapter 611

Vivian Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. Something felt off—the patient's condition had deteriorated too rapidly. It defied medical logic.

She decided to re-examine the case. The body still lay in the operating room. With the dean overwhelmed, she had to investigate personally.

Vivian rose and headed toward the ICU. She needed all the patient's pre-operative data, cross-referenced with the general ward records. Perhaps a clue lay hidden there.

The moment she pushed open the door, shrill screams assaulted her ears.

"Vivian Laurent! Come out here!"

"You murderer! You killed my father and now you're hiding? Face me like a real doctor!"

Bianca Semona rampaged through the hallway like a deranged woman. Medical staff and security surrounded her but hesitated to restrain her forcefully.

"Don't touch me! I'll call the police!" Bianca flailed wildly. "Make Vivian show herself! Is she guilty? Everyone should know this hospital employs killers!"

An older doctor attempted to intervene. "Please calm down. This is a hospital—"

"My father is dead! How can I calm down?" Bianca shoved him aside. "Would you stay calm if it were your father?"

Vivian approached, brow furrowed. She recognized that face—Victoria Roscente's friend. Their last encounter had ended badly.

So this was the heart patient's daughter.

"Finally decided to show yourself?" Bianca's eyes burned with fury.

Vivian remained composed. "You demanded I come out."

"You killed him! You're a butcher!"

"The surgery was successful," Vivian stated evenly. "His decline had another cause. Request a medical review. If I'm at fault, I won't deny responsibility. But if this is slander—"

"Stop pretending!" Bianca cut her off. "You did this deliberately!"

Vivian met her gaze. "I didn't even know he was your father."

Only now did the pieces connect. She'd merely been the surgeon—post-op care fell to cardiology.

"We have history," Bianca hissed through clenched teeth. "But you killed my father. That's fact. I'll prove it and make you pay."
###Chapter 612

"The hospital will form an investigative committee to thoroughly examine this matter. The police have also been notified."

Vivian Laurent's voice was as precise as a surgical instrument.

"If you doubt the hospital's findings, the authorities will provide the final answer."

She adjusted her lab coat with clinical detachment.

"This is a place of healing, not your personal stage for theatrics. Continue this disruption, and security will escort you directly to the police station."

Bianca Semona's bloodshot eyes burned with fury. "Don't threaten me! You killed my father!"

Her accusation tore through the hallway like a jagged scalpel.

Patients began gathering, their murmurs swelling into a chorus of dissent.

"Dr. Laurent saved my life," an elderly man in a wheelchair declared, pounding his armrest.

A middle-aged woman stepped forward, tears glistening. "She gave me an extra year when my cancer was terminal."

"My grandson's congenital heart defect—" a grandmother cradling an infant trembled, "—gone because of her."

Bianca shook violently under the weight of their testimonies. "What does that matter? My father died the day after her surgery!"

Vivian moved with sudden precision, her lab coat slicing the air.

"Every moment was recorded. Consult any specialist worldwide."

Her gaze sharpened to a surgical edge.

"If evidence shows malpractice, I'll surrender my license and my life."

A beat of silence.

"But if I'm cleared, you'll face defamation charges—public retraction and financial restitution."

Bianca bared her teeth. "Fine! And if anything happens to my mother, you're next."

Vivian's brow furrowed. She'd never even met the woman.

"Security—call the police if she continues."

She turned, white fabric whipping like a dismissal.

In the morgue, Chief Wang stared at the corpse with vacant eyes.

"My patient," Vivian stated, snapping on gloves.

The stainless steel table reflected the dead man's eerily serene expression.
###Chapter 613

The autopsy report showed no toxic substances in the deceased's body.

Vivian Laurent stared at the ECG readings, her brow furrowed. The patient's heart rate had spiked erratically minutes before death.

She pulled up the ICU monitoring data. All vitals had been stable before the transfer to the general ward.

Something had gone wrong during that transition.

Yet surveillance footage showed no one near the ward entrance during that time.

Even Vivian found this bizarre death puzzling.

Dr. Zachary Kalmien's eyes were red-rimmed. The deceased had been his longtime friend, and the sudden loss devastated him.

"Dr. Kalmien, this wasn't medical malpractice."

"Thank you, Dr. Laurent."

"Facing life and death is our daily reality. All we can do is save every life possible."

Dr. Kalmien wiped his face. "You're right."

"Would you like to take a few days off? I'll handle this case."

"No. The hospital is understaffed." He shook his head. "I'm counting on you."

Vivian reviewed the medical records again. She would uncover the truth.

Meanwhile, Bianca Semona was showing the surgical footage to various specialists.

"The procedure followed all protocols." An expert adjusted his glasses. "Dr. Laurent's technique was impeccable."

"Impossible!" Bianca slammed the table. "My father died under her care!"

Another specialist pointed at the screen. "Look at these sutures—textbook perfection."

"Examine it again!" Bianca gritted her teeth. "There must have been violations!"

The specialists exchanged glances.

"Ms. Semona, we understand your grief. But the surgery was flawless."

"Then why did my father die?" Her voice trembled. "She must've done something!"

"Post-op care was also by the book. The cause requires further investigation."

Bianca clenched her fists. She refused to believe this was accidental.

Vivian had known whose life was on that operating table. This was premeditated murder!

For a doctor, killing someone would be child's play.
###Chapter 614

Victoria Roscente's phone screen lit up with Bianca Semona's incoming call. They had just spoken yesterday after her father's successful surgery.

"Victoria..." Bianca's voice was raw with grief. "Dad's gone...Vivian Laurent killed him! She won't even admit it! Mom can barely function..."

Victoria's fingers clenched, nails biting into her palms. "What? He was fine yesterday."

"It was her surgery! Her!" Bianca's scream pierced through the phone.

Flames of fury ignited in Victoria's eyes. The name Vivian Laurent had always been a thorn in her side.

"Stay strong. I'll handle this." Her voice turned glacial. "She'll pay for what she did."

——

Under the surgical lights, Vivian Laurent stared at the flatlining EKG until her eyes burned. Eighteen straight hours on her feet.

She'd reviewed every data point, every report. The patient's sudden death made no sense—his post-op vitals had been perfect.

"Heart attack?" she murmured. "Impossible..."

The police and hospital board had ruled it accidental death. But something felt wrong.

Dawn broke. Rubbing her temples, Vivian decided to revisit the ward.

At the hospital entrance, Theo Evans froze mid-step.

A stark white banner with black lettering hung across the doors: [MURDERER DR. LAURENT PAYS IN BLOOD].

Bianca knelt in mourning clothes, clutching a funeral portrait. Victoria stood beside her like a vengeful shadow.

Theo stumbled back, fumbling for his phone. "Uncle! Aunt Victoria's causing a scene at the hospital! Aunt Vivian's in danger!"

——

Nathan Clementson blocked Vivian's path. "Don't go out there. They're gunning for you."

Dark circles bruised Vivian's eyes. "He was my patient."

"The dean's handling it." Nathan gripped her shoulders. "You're in no state to face them."

Down the hall, the dean's voice carried: "Ms. Semona, we empathize with your loss, but the investigation—"

"Investigation?!" Bianca shrieked. "She killed my father!"

The crowd erupted. Vivian shoved past Nathan and strode into the storm.
###Chapter 615

Bianca Semona remained silent while Victoria Roscente pressed on aggressively.

"We haven't laid a finger on Vivian Laurent. We just want justice."

"My friend's father died under suspicious circumstances, and your hospital calls it an accident? If I stab you right now, can I claim it was an accident too?"

Sirens wailed in the distance. Dean Remetio frowned at the troublemaker. "Madam, what's your relationship with the deceased? Causing a disturbance in a hospital is illegal."

"Illegal?" Victoria's eyes gleamed with malicious excitement. "What about Vivian killing someone? Isn't that illegal? Tell her to come out! Hiding inside like a coward proves her guilt!"

Nathan Clementson pushed through the crowd. "I'm Nathan Clementson, Head of General Surgery. Dr. Laurent is under my department. If you have concerns, address them to me."

"The surgery followed all protocols, and experts have reviewed the case. Continue this disruption, and the hospital will pursue legal action."

Though his voice was calm, every word carried authority.

The Head of Cardiac Surgery stepped forward. "Dr. Laurent's skills are undeniable. I personally requested her assistance for this surgery and supervised the entire procedure."

"With thirty years of experience, I guarantee there were no errors."

Victoria sneered. "A young girl lost her father. How will this widow and orphan survive? Your hospital is protecting a murderer!"

"If Vivian's innocent, why won't she face us?"

"Do you really think I'd hide?"

A cool voice cut through the noise. Vivian Laurent walked forward in her pristine lab coat, composed and unflinching.

"Victoria Roscente, inciting a riot carries legal consequences."

"You killed someone! Shouldn't you face justice?"

"I committed no crime. If you doubt the investigation, report it to the authorities." Vivian met her gaze steadily. "The findings confirm it was an accident, and the hospital will continue monitoring the case."

"Your theatrics here change nothing."

"Vivian! You murderer! Give me back my father!" Bianca suddenly lunged like a madwoman.

Victoria seized the moment to rally the crowd. "A life for a life! That's justice!"

Chaos erupted. Security guards were overwhelmed as Victoria's mob disrupted hospital operations.

"Victoria!"

A thunderous voice boomed through a megaphone. Victoria flinched, turning to see Ethan Roscente striding toward her with the amplifier.

Her bravado vanished instantly. "Brother..."

The fearless heiress cowered before her formidable older brother—the one person whose wrath she dreaded.

And it was clear Ethan hadn't come to defend her.
###Chapter 616

"This is a hospital, not your playground." Ethan Roscente's voice was glacial. "Disperse within three minutes or face the consequences from Roscente Group's legal team."

The crowd erupted into chaos.

Several timid individuals immediately dropped their protest banners and fled.

"Stop!" Victoria Roscente stomped her foot in frustration. "Useless cowards!"

Her gaze met Ethan's and she instinctively took half a step back.

"Doctors aren't gods." Ethan enunciated each word sharply. "If you riot every time they can't perform miracles, who would dare practice medicine?"

Vivian Laurent froze.

How many good physicians had their careers destroyed by such medical disputes over the years?

"Ethan, we're not causing trouble." Victoria forced herself to stand firm. "Vivian killed Bianca's father. We're just demanding justice."

"Until the investigation concludes, who gave you the authority to pass judgment?" Ethan advanced step by step. "Or do you consider yourself more qualified than the police?"

Victoria retreated under his relentless approach.

"Evidence." Ethan demanded coldly.

"Who else could it be?" Victoria's voice trembled. "She's taking revenge on Bianca!"

"I said evidence." Ethan repeated icily.

Victoria fell silent.

"No evidence means slander." Ethan's lips curled into a cruel smile. "Apparently your time in confinement wasn't long enough."

With a flick of his wrist, bodyguards immediately seized Victoria.

"Let me go!" She struggled futilely as they dragged her away.

Bianca Semona tore off her mourning sash, glaring venomously at Vivian. "I'll find the proof!"

The crowd finally dispersed.

Director Wang approached with visible remorse. "Dr. Laurent, I'm terribly sorry—"

"Don't be." Vivian shook her head. "My conscience is clear."

"That's good then." Director Wang exhaled in relief before hurrying off.

Only Ethan and Vivian remained in the corridor.

As he reached out, a dark figure suddenly intervened.

"Shadow, come with me." Liam Valdemar materialized from nowhere, gripping Vivian's wrist.
###Chapter 617

"What's going on?" Vivian Laurent barely had time to react before Liam Valdemar appeared in front of her.

He pulled her into a secluded corner of the hallway.

"I saw everything." Liam's voice was dangerously low. "How dare they treat you like that?"

Vivian shook her head. "Bianca Semona just lost her father. It's understandable that she's emotional."

"But you were the one who tried to save him!" Liam's knuckles turned white. "Her father's time was up. That wasn't your fault. Let me teach her a lesson."

"No!" Vivian gripped his sleeve tightly. "If you intervene, it changes everything."

A flash of fury crossed Liam's eyes. "I can't stand this."

"I'm not bothered by it." Vivian kept her voice soft. "My conscience is clear."

"Ethan Roscente is useless." Liam scoffed. "Can't even protect his own woman."

Vivian frowned. "This has nothing to do with him. He came when I needed him—that's enough."

Liam leaned closer. "You're defending him again."

"I'm just stating facts." She took half a step back. "More importantly, why are you here?"

"Follow-up appointment." His expression remained neutral.

In truth, he'd been monitoring the hospital. He knew Annika Heilbronn's schemes better than anyone.

That patient's sudden death was no accident. Annika had used illusions to trigger the man's worst fears, causing cardiac arrest.

"Go get checked then." Vivian nudged him. "I have rounds to make."

Without warning, Liam wrapped his arms around her in a crushing embrace.

"Remember," he whispered against her ear, "Shadow operatives never take losses lightly. If she dares confront you again, I'll make her regret being born."

Footsteps echoed down the corridor.

Ethan stood at the far end, holding Theo Evans' hand. His gaze turned glacial.

Liam smirked and tightened his hold on Vivian.

"Let go." She pushed against his chest. "And call me Vivian from now on. No more Shadow references."

"Fine... Vivian." He deliberately brushed his lips near her ear.

She patted his shoulder like he was just another comrade.

As she turned to leave, she met Ethan's stormy glare.

Theo broke free from his uncle's grip and sprinted toward her. "Auntie! I memorized all those bad people's faces! When I grow up—"

"It's 'sister.'" Vivian crouched to correct him.

Before she could finish, strong arms yanked her into another embrace.

Ethan's grip was like iron—far more possessive than Liam's had been.
###Chapter 618

"Ethan, the child is watching!" Vivian pushed against his solid chest with all her strength, but he didn't budge an inch.

His scorching body heat seeped through the fabric of his shirt, making the tips of her ears burn. Suddenly she realized—Liam's embrace had been like a spring breeze, while Ethan's felt like wildfire consuming everything in its path.

The baby in her womb gave a gentle kick, as if responding to its father's touch. This realization made her heart skip a beat.

"Let go or I'll make you," she threatened with feigned ferocity.

Ethan's lips nearly brushed her earlobe. "Why did you let him hold you?" His deep voice carried a dangerous edge. "Are you in love with that bodyguard?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" She stomped on his foot in frustration.

"The Semonas won't let this go." His arms tightened around her. "Starting today, I'm your personal bodyguard."

Vivian scoffed. "I don't need deadweight."

"Victoria and Sophia Evans are waiting to kick you while you're down." He turned her shoulders to face him. "You may not care about rumors, but I do."

Dark currents swirled in his obsidian eyes. "I want everyone to know Vivian Laurent is under my protection."

"Just keep your niece in check." She turned her face away.

"Auntie!"

The childish voice interrupted them. Theo ran over and hugged Vivian's legs. "Let Uncle protect you!"

She crouched down to pinch his chubby cheeks. "Call me sister."

"Theo wants to help Auntie fight bad guys!" The little boy waved his tiny fists.

Ethan grabbed the back of Theo's collar. "The driver's waiting downstairs." He arched an eyebrow at Vivian before leaving. "Your bodyguard is on call 24/7."

As the elevator doors closed, Vivian exhaled in relief—only to find Ethan leaning against the wall, his suit jacket slung casually over one shoulder.

"Why are you still here?"

He waved his phone. "Just leased the apartment across from yours."
###Chapter 619

Vivian spun around sharply, her stilettos clicking against the marble floor.

"How much longer are you planning to follow me?" She glared at the man trailing behind her.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the wall with a lazy smirk, one hand tucked in his pocket. "A bodyguard who doesn't guard his charge isn't much of a bodyguard, is he?"

"I don't need one."

"That's not your call to make."

Vivian exhaled sharply and pushed open her office door. Ethan slipped in before she could shut it.

"Out."

"I'll be quiet." He raised his hands in surrender and retreated to lean against the wall. "Won't disturb the CEO at work."

She ignored him, settling behind her desk to review documents. In her periphery, his towering frame remained motionless—a silent sentinel in the corner.

Liam Valdemar ended the call and tapped his fingers against the steering wheel. Ten minutes later, Annika Heilbronn slid into the passenger seat.

"Master Zero!" Her voice dripped saccharine sweetness.

He didn't look at her as he started the engine.

"Why did you kill that man?" His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Annika's smile froze. "What are you talking about?"

"I told you not to touch Vivian Laurent."

"I didn't!" She grabbed his arm desperately. "Master, you have to believe me—"

He shook her off, his gaze glacial.

"Recite the organization's rules."

All color drained from her face. Trembling, she retrieved a folding knife from her bag. The blade glinted coldly in the sunlight.

"I'm sorry, Master..."

The knife sliced across her forearm. Blood welled instantly. She produced a packet of salt next, tearing it open with her teeth.

When the salt hit the wound, Annika let out a piercing scream. She curled into herself on the seat, sweat soaking her bangs.

Liam watched impassively.

"Enough." He handed her a tissue pack. "Bandage it."

Tears blurred her vision as she looked up. "Do you forgive me?"

"Don't let it happen again." He pushed the car door open. "Next time, our master-disciple relationship ends here."

The door slammed shut. Annika stared at his retreating figure, nails digging bloody crescents into her palms.

Why? She'd even gotten plastic surgery to resemble Vivian. Why wouldn't Master Zero spare her a second glance?

The cruelest irony? Her investigations suggested the very man who'd failed Vivian's mission years ago might have been Liam himself.
###Chapter 620

Vivian Laurent had just pushed open the door to the private dining room when she heard Isabella Langley's furious voice.

"Master, come look at this!" Lucas Lefèvre handed her his phone.

The screen displayed a local news headline: "Renowned Doctor Refuses to Save Dying Patient - Family Demands Justice."

The accompanying photo showed Vivian at the hospital.

"This is complete nonsense!" Finn Deross slammed his fist on the table. "The patient arrived too late for treatment. How is this Master's fault?"

Vivian took the phone, her fingertips turning cold.

The article detailed how "Dr. Laurent" had allegedly refused treatment, resulting in the patient's death.

The comments section was exploding.

"Does this woman deserve to be a doctor?"
"I heard she has powerful connections. The hospital won't touch her."
"We demand accountability!"

Vivian placed the phone back on the table calmly. "Let's not dwell on this. We should eat."

"Vivian!" Isabella grabbed her hand urgently. "Someone's deliberately smearing your reputation!"

Vivian shook her head gently. "The truth will come out."

"But—" Lucas started to speak when Finn stopped him.

"Master's right. These people aren't worth our anger."

Vivian took a sip of water, then suddenly felt nauseous.

"I need to use the restroom." She stood abruptly.

Outside in the hallway, Ethan Roscente remained on guard.

Seeing her exit, he approached immediately. "What's wrong? You look pale."

"It's nothing." Vivian tried to walk past him.

Ethan caught her arm. "Are you feeling sick again?"

She pulled away. "Mr. Roscente, remember your place."

His hand froze midair.

Vivian hurried to the restroom, leaning over the sink as dry heaves wracked her body.

The mirror reflected her pallid complexion.

She splashed cold water on her face.

When she returned, the atmosphere in the private room had grown heavier.

Isabella handed her the phone again. "Look at this."

A video played showing the patient's family protesting outside the hospital with banners, wailing for justice.

"Dr. Laurent let my husband die! Give us justice!"

The footage then cut to Vivian's back as she'd rushed away from the hospital that day.

"This is obviously edited!" Finn fumed. "Master was responding to another emergency case!"

Lucas stomped his foot. "This has gone too far!"

Vivian studied the video for several seconds before smiling faintly.

"How interesting."

She picked up her coat. "Let's head back to the hospital."

"Now?" Isabella gasped. "There are reporters everywhere outside!"

Vivian adjusted her scarf. "Perfect timing. I'd like to meet them."

Ethan pushed open the door. "I'll drive you."

Vivian gave him a sidelong glance. "Suit yourself."

As they exited the restaurant, camera flashes immediately blinded them.

"Dr. Laurent! Can you explain the patient's death?"
"Is it true you were on your phone during the emergency?"
"Will the hospital take disciplinary action?"

Vivian stopped walking, her gaze sweeping across each reporter.

"Tomorrow at 10 AM, I'll hold a press conference at the hospital."

She smiled slightly. "All your questions will be answered then."
###Chapter 621

Finn Deross slammed his fist on the table. "How can someone be so shamelessly brazen?"

He turned to Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre. "Don't you think we should teach her a lesson? Let's form a team and give her what she deserves."

Isabella opened her mouth to respond when the door swung open.

Vivian Laurent walked in. "What's going on? Who got you so worked up?"

Finn immediately handed her his phone. "Master, look. Bianca Semona is spreading lies online, claiming you killed her father."

"When her hospital stunt failed, she took to social media to ruin your reputation!"

Vivian's account was renowned for medical science education. She regularly shared disease prevention tips and self-examination methods. Many young followers had discovered hidden health issues through her posts, earning her the affectionate nickname "Dr. Luna."

Now Bianca clutched her father's portrait in a tearful video, portraying herself as a helpless victim while accusing the hospital of malpractice and Vivian of conspiracy.

"Viv, she's lying through her teeth!" Finn pointed at the screen. "Look how fast this is trending—she definitely bought internet trolls. Worse yet, she's dragging Sophia Evans' old scandal into this."

The video showed Bianca sobbing dramatically, accusing Vivian of causing her father's death and colluding with hospital staff.

Suddenly, the video froze.

"What happened?" Vivian refreshed the page to find the content gone.

All related hashtags had vanished from trending lists. Bianca's account displayed a banner: "Banned for spreading misinformation."

"That was fast." Isabella's eyes widened. "Who has this kind of power to resolve everything in minutes?"

Police and hospital statements appeared in quick succession, clearly stating Vivian had no involvement in the patient's death.

"Impressive efficiency." Finn whistled. "Someone powerful must be behind this."

They exchanged glances. None of them had taken action.

An image flashed through Vivian's mind. Could it be... Ethan Roscente?
###Chapter 622

Vivian Laurent's medical expertise had long been widely recognized.

"Dr. Laurent would never harm anyone! She was the one who diagnosed my grandfather's cancer!"

"My sister's rare condition—Dr. Laurent is the only specialist in the country who can treat it!"

"To those slandering Dr. Laurent—may you never find a competent doctor when you fall ill!"

Public opinion online shifted rapidly.

The trending hashtags Bianca Semona had paid a fortune to promote were all taken down by Ethan Roscente within half a day.

"Mr. Roscente, everything has been handled," Simon Eisner reported over the phone.

Standing in the hospital corridor, Ethan's gaze was icy. "Keep monitoring. The moment anything resurfaces, shut it down immediately."

He wasn't just Vivian's bodyguard—he was her most unshakable shield.

......

Inside a private dining room, Vivian finished dinner with her colleagues.

Ethan maintained a discreet distance, silently escorting her home.

Under the night sky, his figure remained stationed outside Vivian's residence.

Bianca's smear campaign at the hospital only intensified.

"Should you take a few days off?" Nathan Clementson asked with concern.

Vivian shook her head. "No need."

The medical summit proceeded as scheduled.

Just as Vivian was preparing to leave with her materials, devastating news arrived.

Bianca's mother had committed suicide.

"Slit her wrists in the hospital bathroom. By the time she was found, it was already..." a nurse whispered in report.

Vivian froze mid-step.

"Don't blame yourself," Nathan said, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "This isn't your fault."

"And Bianca...?"

"She just received the news," Nathan frowned. "You should get going."

At the hospital entrance, Vivian was about to enter her car when Bianca stumbled toward her, eyes bloodshot.

"Vivian Laurent! Give me back my mother's life!"

Her hysterical scream tore through the air.
###Chapter 623

Bianca Semona lunged at Vivian Laurent.

Vivian sidestepped and tripped her with a swift kick.

Bianca struggled to get up, but Vivian pinned her down with one hand.

"Bianca, have you lost your mind? How is your mother's death my fault?"

"It is you! You killed my mother! You hate me, so you want me to be an orphan!"

Bianca screamed hysterically. Losing both parents in just months had shattered her.

"Your mother took her own life. Who suffered the most after your father died? Your mother! And you? Instead of being there for her, you spent your time harassing me."

Vivian's words froze Bianca in place.

She remembered her mother's last unanswered call. When she called back, all she got was a text: "I'm too tired." Soon after, the hospital delivered the devastating news.

"It's all because of you! If you hadn't killed my father, my mother wouldn't have committed suicide!"

Bianca thrashed wildly, but Vivian held her firmly.

"Vivian! You murderer! I'll never let you get away with this!"

Vivian smirked. If Bianca had spent more time with her mother, perhaps the tragedy could have been avoided.

Security guards rushed over at the commotion.

"Keep an eye on her." Vivian handed Bianca over and walked away, getting into her car.

Ethan Roscente had called earlier, saying he couldn't join her due to work. With everything calm lately, Vivian hadn't thought much of it.

Bianca watched Vivian drive off and shoved the guards away.

"Let me go! I'm calling the police!"

She didn't even see her mother one last time before chasing after Vivian in her car.

Why should Vivian walk away unscathed? Bianca had nothing left to lose—she'd drag her down with her if she had to.

As she drove, Vivian frowned in thought.

Bianca's mother's suicide didn't add up.

From what she knew, the woman had been mentally stable and physically healthy. Though deeply devoted to her husband, she wasn't the type to follow him in death.

And she had a daughter. The funeral hadn't even been held yet. With no one to care for Bianca, why would she kill herself so abruptly?
###Chapter 624

Vivian Laurent gripped the steering wheel as she dialed Nathan Clementson's number.

"Was Bianca Semona's mother's death confirmed as suicide?" Her voice remained steady.

Nathan sighed on the other end. "Surveillance shows no outsiders entered the ward. Nurses found nothing unusual during rounds. Her mother had been emotionally unstable lately, though her vitals were normal..."

"But there must be a reason for someone to suddenly choose death," Vivian interrupted.

"What are you suspecting, Vivian?"

Her fingers tapped lightly against the wheel. "A mother who didn't even see her daughter before dying... yet chose to follow her husband in death?"

Her gaze softened as she glanced at her slightly rounded abdomen.

"Perhaps I'm overthinking it."

"Focus on driving," Nathan reminded her.

After hanging up, Vivian immediately called Isabella Langley.

"Isabella, I need you to look into something."

Isabella's cheerful voice answered, "What is it, Viv?"

"Dig into Bianca Semona's parents' relationship. Find out if they were truly so devoted that one would die for the other."

Isabella gasped. "A love suicide? That's dramatic."

"On the surface, yes."

"Leave it to me!" Isabella promised confidently. "You'll have answers by tonight."

The medical summit buzzed with activity.

Security personnel respectfully guided Vivian inside after she presented her invitation.

The auditorium was filled with distinguished elderly physicians, making Vivian stand out as she took the stage.

Her groundbreaking cancer research elicited murmurs of awe.

"According to the latest clinical data, we've discovered—"

The doors burst open before she could finish.

Bianca Semona rushed in, disheveled and hysterical, evading security.

"Murderer!" She pointed a trembling finger at Vivian. "My parents are dead, and you dare stand there pretending?"

The crowd erupted in shock.

Tears streamed down Bianca's face. "She destroyed my family! Now she's trying to silence me!"

She yanked her collar aside, revealing bruises on her neck.

"Look! This is what she did to me!"
###Chapter 625

"It's her!" Bianca Semona pointed at Vivian Laurent on stage, her shrill voice cutting through the air. "She operated on my father last week, and now he's dead. And my mother too—all because of her!"

The auditorium erupted in murmurs.

"She even hired internet trolls to smear me online," Bianca raged hysterically. "She's made my life hell. Now I'm all alone. Do you all think I'm an easy target?"

Medical staff exchanged uneasy glances. Whispers spread through the crowd.

"There was an official statement," a bespectacled female doctor spoke up. "Both the hospital and police confirmed it was an accident. Dr. Laurent isn't responsible."

A male doctor frowned. "If every grieving relative behaved like this, how could any hospital function? Disrupting an academic lecture is beyond unreasonable."

"Exactly!" another voice chimed in. "Do you have any idea how many lives Dr. Laurent has saved? By causing this scene, you're preventing her from treating other patients. Who's responsible for that?"

Bianca's face turned ashen. She'd expected sympathy as an "orphan," but everyone sided with Vivian.

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"You're all bullying me!" she shrieked suddenly, clawing at her own hair. "The whole world is against me!"

Vivian descended the podium with calm steps.

"No one's bullying you," she said softly, yet her voice silenced the room. "You chose to make this scene."

Tears streaked Bianca's makeup.

"After your mother's suicide," Vivian met her gaze unflurriedly, "did you even visit the morgue? All this time you've spent harassing me, you couldn't be bothered to see your own mother one last time."

The words struck like daggers.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Call security."
"How disturbing."
"She should be—"

Bianca shoved through the crowd. "Get away from me! I'm leaving!"

She stumbled into the hallway and collapsed against the wall.

The leaden sky seemed to press down on her.

She bit her lip until copper filled her mouth. Once the pampered Semona heiress, now she was nothing but a stray.

Hatred churned in her chest like a living thing.
###Chapter 626

The hospital morgue was icy cold.

Bianca Semona stood alone at the entrance, her fingers clutching the hem of her shirt. Her parents' bodies lay inside, waiting for their only daughter to claim them.

"Uncle, can you come help me?" Her voice trembled as she made the call.

The sound of clinking mahjong tiles came through the phone. "Ah, Bianca, I'm in the middle of an important business negotiation. Handle it yourself."

"Auntie..."

"Bianca, I'm vacationing in the Maldives. Don't bother me with such unlucky matters."

One call after another went unanswered. Relatives were either out of town or too busy. Even her eldest uncle hung up on her without a word.

She arranged the hearse alone.

She completed the cremation paperwork alone.

At the funeral, only a handful of distant relatives showed up. None of the "close friends" who once surrounded her father made an appearance.

The mourning hall was eerily silent.

Biting her lip, Bianca pulled out her phone to contact work. She had to pull herself together quickly.

"Miss Semona, the project has already been reassigned."

"Sorry, we've found a more suitable candidate."

Each rejection was colder than the last.

She suddenly realized—without her father's influence, she was nothing.

"I still have money," she muttered, checking her bank account.

The balance made her blood run cold.

Those relatives who had eagerly helped her with "her father's paperwork" days ago had been transferring assets behind her back.

Every document she signed had unknowingly handed over her family's wealth.

The wind howled on the rooftop.

Bianca stood at the edge, staring down at the ant-like pedestrians below.

One step forward, and all the pain would end.

"What a waste, to die like this."

The unfamiliar voice made her whirl around.

A young woman stood a few feet away, a faint smile playing on her lips.
###Chapter 627

Bianca Semona stood at the rooftop's edge, the cold wind tangling her hair.

Her eyes locked onto the unfamiliar woman who had suddenly appeared.

Annika Heilbronn leaned casually against the wall, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

"Who the hell are you?" Bianca's grip tightened on the railing.

"Just an audience member," Annika replied, adjusting her cuff with disinterest.

Bianca let out a bitter laugh. "You all think I'm a joke, don't you?"

"No." Annika lifted her gaze. "You turned yourself into one."

The words cut Bianca like a knife.

"If you die, Vivian Laurent will pop champagne to celebrate," Annika took a step forward. "Your relatives are already fighting over your inheritance."

Bianca's fingers trembled slightly.

"You..." Her voice shook. "How do you know this?"

Annika chuckled. "I know far more than you can imagine."

"Won't you avenge your parents?" Annika suddenly closed the distance. "Let those people get away with it?"

Tears spilled from Bianca's eyes.

"I can help you." Annika's voice was serpentine. "Make every single one of them pay."

Bianca jerked her head up. "Why would you help me?"

"Because..." Annika narrowed her eyes. "We share the same enemy."

The wind howled louder across the rooftop.

Bianca's rationality warred within her.

Annika pulled a photo from her pocket. "Recognize this?"

It showed Vivian Laurent in an intimate embrace with the hospital dean.

"This is..." Bianca's eyes widened.

"Evidence." Annika shoved the photo into her hand. "Just the beginning."

Bianca's breathing turned ragged.

"Three days." Annika held up three fingers. "I'll make your uncle beg on his knees."

Bianca crushed the photo in her fist.

"Why should I trust you?" she gritted out.

Annika suddenly smiled. "Because you've run out of options, haven't you?"

The words shattered Bianca's last defenses.

She slowly stepped back from the ledge.

A glint of triumph flashed in Annika's eyes.

The dial tone of that desperate call still echoed in her ears.

She had severed that woman's lifeline herself.

Now, she would mold Bianca into her sharpest blade.
###Chapter 628

Bianca Semona stared at Annika Heilbronn's retreating figure, clutching the slip of paper with the phone number between her fingertips.

She looked down at the hastily scribbled digits, her pulse quickening.

The next morning, her uncle paid an unexpected visit.

"Bianca, these are the shares and property deeds I took from you before." Her uncle smiled obsequiously as he placed the documents on the coffee table. "I've added two commercial properties as well."

Bianca's hands trembled slightly.

She remembered how arrogantly he had seized the last remnants of her parents' estate during his previous visit.

Her aunt's overseas call came right after.

"I'm at the airport now. I'll arrive tomorrow." Her aunt's voice dripped with sycophancy. "I brought gifts for you."

Bianca hung up and stood motionless before the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sunlight washed over her pale face.

Three days later, all her relatives appeared at her doorstep as if by prior arrangement.

They came bearing gifts, smiles, and everything she had lost.

"This is the money your father lent me, with interest."
"These were your mother's favorite jewelry pieces. They belong to you now."
"The company shares have been transferred to your name."

Bianca accepted the documents mechanically, her mind blank.

At the funeral, her relatives wept more bitterly than she did.

They surrounded the gravestone, tearfully recounting the deceased's virtues.

Bianca stood at the periphery, her nails digging into her palms.

Late that night, Annika materialized in her bedroom like a ghost.

"Satisfied?" Annika leaned against the window frame, moonlight outlining her slender silhouette.

Bianca bolted upright. "Who are you really?"

"That's irrelevant." Annika's laugh was light. "What matters is your parents shouldn't have died."

Bianca's breath hitched.

"Vivian Laurent took everything from you." Annika's voice slithered into her ears like a venomous snake. "Your family. Your fortune. Even—"

"Enough!" Bianca interrupted. "What do you want?"

Annika stepped closer, her shadow engulfing Bianca. "I want Vivian to pay."

Bianca looked up into Annika's obsidian eyes.

"You can help me?"

"Naturally." Annika handed her a phone. "Use this to contact me."

The cold metal sent a shiver through Bianca as she accepted it.

"Remember." Annika's form began dissolving. "Tell no one."

Before the words faded, Bianca found herself alone again.

She looked down at the phone. The screen lit up suddenly.

A new message appeared:
"Let Vivian taste loss first."

Meanwhile, Isabella Langley made a breakthrough in her investigation.

"Bianca's father had a mistress. Six months pregnant." Isabella slid photos across to Vivian. "Her mother knew."

Vivian studied the images, brow furrowed.

"Stranger still," Isabella lowered her voice, "her mother's account received two million dollars a week before she died."

Vivian's head snapped up. "Trace the source?"

"Offshore account." Isabella shook her head. "Untraceable for now."

Vivian closed the file and gazed out the window.

The night stretched before them, dark and treacherous.
###Chapter 629

Isabella stirred the sugar cube in her coffee cup.

"The Semonas are wealthy. They don't need that money."

Vivian frowned in thought.

"That's what's strange. Why would she commit suicide without strong motives? And..."

She suddenly fell silent.

"And what?" Isabella pressed.

"Sophia Sherwood also died by suicide," Vivian murmured.

Isabella set down her cup.

"Wasn't that case closed? The killer confessed."

Vivian shook her head.

"It was initially ruled a suicide too. Maybe I'm overthinking it."

Her fingers traced the rim of her cup.

Bianca's mother's death was shrouded in mystery.

No motive. No suicide note. Not even any warning signs.

If it was murder...

Vivian's fingertips trembled.

Someone was deliberately creating conflict between her and Bianca.

But who?

Victoria was the prime suspect, yet she treated Bianca like a sister.

With the body cremated, all evidence had vanished.

"Don't dwell on it," Isabella squeezed her hand. "Focus on your pregnancy now. When's your next prenatal visit?"

Vivian gently touched her slightly rounded abdomen.

The appointment was approaching.

But Ethan hadn't left her side since Bianca's public outburst.

He'd become her shadow.

"I have a business trip tomorrow," Vivian told Ethan.

"I'll book the same flight," he immediately reached for his phone.

"No need." She stopped him. "Attend to your own work."

Ethan nodded silently.

The next morning.

A black Maybach waited at the street corner.

Ethan watched Vivian's car exit the gated community.

He followed at a distance.

Her vehicle merged onto the freeway - not heading toward the airport.

Ethan's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

It stopped outside a private hospital.

Not the Seattle Medical Center where Vivian worked.

Why was she here?

By the time Ethan parked, Vivian had disappeared inside.

He searched every corner of the outpatient lobby.

Nursing station. Waiting area. Hallways...

"Have you seen this woman?" He showed her photo on his phone.

Only received shaken heads in response.

Ethan's pulse quickened.

Was she ill?

Why wouldn't she tell him?
###Chapter 630

Ethan Roscente stood in the hospital lobby, his brow furrowed. He repeatedly questioned the front desk nurse about Vivian Laurent's whereabouts, only to receive polite but firm refusals.

Meanwhile, Vivian was in the obstetrics examination room. The doctor gently moved the ultrasound probe over her abdomen, revealing a tiny life growing healthily on the screen.

"The fetus is developing well. It's already sixteen weeks," the doctor said with a smile. "Make sure to focus on nutrition and rest."

Vivian's fingers instinctively brushed her lower abdomen. This was a secret she had to protect.

As the elevator doors opened, Vivian froze. Ethan stood just a few feet away, his piercing gaze locked onto her.

Her heart pounded. Why was he here? Had he discovered something?

She clutched her bag tightly against her chest, trying to conceal the slight swell of her stomach.

"Vivian!"

Ethan strode forward, blocking her path. His eyes swept over her, searching for answers.

"Are you unwell?" His voice was laced with concern.

Vivian forced calm into her tone. "Just a routine checkup."

"You lied about a business trip for a checkup?" Ethan took a step closer. "What's really going on?"

His breath brushed her face, carrying the familiar scent of his cologne. She turned away, unable to meet his eyes.

"I had stomach issues recently. Just getting it checked." She fabricated the excuse on the spot.

Ethan's expression darkened. He noticed how her hand hovered protectively over her abdomen—and the looser-than-usual clothing she wore.

"Show me the test results." He held out his hand.

Vivian retreated half a step. "There's nothing worth seeing. Just gastritis."

"Then why lie to me?" His voice dropped low. "Do you know how worried I was?"

"You followed me?" She deflected, trying to shift the focus.

"I was concerned Bianca might be harassing you again." His gaze bore into hers. "But clearly, you're hiding something bigger."

Sweat dampened her palms. She needed to leave—now.

"Think whatever you want." She turned to go. "I have things to do."

Ethan seized her wrist. "We need to talk."

His grip wasn't harsh, but it was unyielding. Vivian knew she wouldn't escape so easily this time.
###Chapter 631

"Why should I show you?" Vivian clutched her medical records tightly to her chest.

Ethan reached for them. "Let me check your stomach condition."

"Back off!" She shoved him away and strode toward the hospital exit.

He followed. "The pharmacy is that way!"

Vivian didn't slow down. "The doctor said to monitor first. No medication needed."

Ethan frowned. She'd claimed to have stomach issues—why wasn't she getting treatment?

After dropping her home, he booted up his laptop in the car. His hacking skills were rusty, but answers were necessary today.

The hospital system showed several "Vivian Laurent" visits. None appeared under gastroenterology.

"Strange..." He stared at the screen. What was she really here for? Why no records?

A horn blared. Lucas Lefèvre leaned from a car window. "Ethan Roscente! Harassing Vivian again?"

"I'm protecting her."

"We don't need you!" Lucas glared. "Stay away from her!"

"Not happening."

Lucas drove into the villa garage without another word. He had urgent business with Vivian.

Upstairs, Vivian typed rapidly at her study desk. She had to erase her prenatal records before Ethan found them.

"Done." She hit enter. The encryption program was her own design—unbreakable.

"Vivian!" Lucas called from below.

She opened the door. "What is it?"

Finn Deross peered from the second floor. "Problem?"

"Nothing." Vivian glanced outside. "Is Ethan still there?"

Lucas nodded. "Like gum on your shoe."

"Ignore him." She turned back inside. "Any updates on the property?"

He pulled files from his briefcase. "All here. Quiet location, excellent medical access."

Vivian reviewed them carefully. Her overseas birth plan required perfect timing—these listings arrived right on schedule.
###Chapter 632

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows as Vivian Laurent sat on the sofa scrolling through property listings on her tablet.

Finn Deross leaned in curiously, his nose almost touching the screen. "Master Zero, why are you suddenly looking at overseas properties?"

"To live in," Vivian replied without looking up.

Her finger paused on a Nordic-style villa. White exterior walls, panoramic windows, surrounded by lush woods.

"You're leaving the country? When?" Finn's eyes widened.

Lucas Lefèvre set down his coffee cup. "Isn't it too early to buy a retirement home, Vivian?"

"It's not for retirement." Vivian gently touched her abdomen. "I'll move in a few months."

"But that's right before New Year's!" Finn exclaimed.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Can't celebrate abroad? Perfect for avoiding winter." She turned the tablet toward Lucas. "This one."

Lucas nodded, making a note. His gaze lingered as Vivian briefly hovered over baby product pages.

"Lucas, come here." Vivian stood abruptly.

Finn immediately protested. "Master! What can't I hear?"

"Many things," Vivian said mercilessly.

She knew her apprentice too well. If Finn found out, the entire circle would know within three days.

"Remember, no one can know about this purchase. Not even your uncle." Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Or else—"

"Expulsion from the sect..." Finn mumbled dejectedly but couldn't resist craning his neck.

Vivian led Lucas to the balcony. A breeze swept past as she took a deep breath.

"I'm pregnant."

Lucas nearly dropped the tablet. "Wh-what?"

"Almost four months." Vivian's voice remained calm. "Ethan Roscente's child."

Lucas swallowed hard. "Does he know?"

"No, and he won't." Vivian gazed into the distance. "I'm keeping this baby."

"The villa is for the pregnancy. And the baby supplies..." Her tone softened.

Lucas immediately straightened. "Leave it to me."

"Thank you." Vivian smiled. "Isabella says she wants you both as godparents."

"The honor is mine." Lucas pledged solemnly. "I'll protect this child with my life."

Vivian patted his shoulder. "Don't be so serious. You should think about yourself too—find a nice girl—"

"There isn't one." Lucas cut her off. "My only wish is to protect you."

Vivian shook her head helplessly. "By the way, Ethan followed me to the hospital today."

Lucas's eyes turned sharp.

"He thought it was just a checkup." Vivian lowered her voice. "He must never find out."

"Understood." Lucas clenched his fists. "I'll handle everything."

In the distance, Finn pressed against the glass door, his face screaming "I'm dying to know."
###Chapter 633

Lucas Lefèvre's hurried departure left Finn Deross scratching his head in frustration.

"Lucas!" Finn chased after him to the doorway. "What's so secretive?"

Without turning back, Lucas waved dismissively before speeding off in his car.

Finn looked like an abandoned puppy as he turned pitifully toward Vivian Laurent.

"Master..." He batted his eyelashes, dragging out the word.

Vivian shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.

"Stop looking at me like that." She took two steps sideways.

Finn immediately followed. "Just give me a tiny hint!"

"No." Vivian's tone brooked no argument.

Finn's shoulders slumped in defeat. Another failed mission from his uncle.

The sudden ringtone startled them both.

"Hey, Uncle Dom." Finn answered weakly.

"Any updates?" Dominic Atlante's voice came through the receiver.

"Master bought a property overseas." Finn whispered. "Said she's spending New Year's there."

A brief silence hung between them.

"Give me the address." Dominic demanded abruptly.

Finn scratched his head and recited the memorized location.

After hanging up, Dominic tapped his desk thoughtfully.

Vivian purchasing foreign real estate? That didn't sound like her.

Two days later.

Nathan Clementson stood in the hospital corridor taking Vivian's call.

"Bianca Semona?" He glanced around. "Haven't seen her in days."

Vivian frowned. "No disturbances?"

"None." Nathan confirmed. "She disappeared after collecting her mother's remains."

This was highly unusual. Vivian ended the call with growing unease.

Her phone rang again immediately.

"Vivi!" Fiona Grandelle's cheerful voice chirped. "I'm in Canada!"

Vivian nearly dropped her phone. "You're here?"

"Mmhm!" Fiona giggled. "I told you I'd visit."

Vivian's face lit up. "Come straight to my place! I'll summon Emily too."

"Actually..." Fiona hesitated. "Could...could Dr. Fairsprene join us?"

Vivian smirked knowingly. "Consider it done."

She immediately texted Emily Garnache and Ryan Fairsprene.

Emily replied instantly: "On my way!"

Thirty minutes later, Vivian and Emily waited eagerly at the villa's entrance.

"I'm so nervous!" Emily rubbed her hands together. "Wonder how she looks now."

A black sedan pulled up gracefully.

The door opened, revealing a girl in a baseball cap and face mask.

"Fifi!" Emily rushed forward for a bear hug.

Fiona staggered back two steps, laughing as she returned the embrace.

"Let me see!" Emily reached eagerly for the mask.
###Chapter 634

"The sun is too strong out here. Let's go inside." Vivian Laurent shielded her eyes from the glaring sunlight.

Emily Garnache pulled Fiona Grandelle's hand eagerly. "Quick, let me see your face!"

Fiona took a deep breath and slowly removed her face mask.

The once scar-ridden face now looked flawless. Her porcelain skin glowed like pearls under the sunlight, blue eyes clear as mountain lakes.

"Oh my God!" Emily gasped. "Fiona, you look like a princess from a fairy tale!"

Fiona's ears turned pink. "Don't say that... I'm just glad I can finally go outside like a normal person."

Her fingers brushed against her cheek where scars used to be. No more strange stares from strangers.

Vivian smiled warmly. "Congratulations, Fiona. You're truly beautiful now."

"All thanks to you, Vivian..." Fiona's eyes grew misty. "Without you, I'd still be that monster afraid to look in mirrors."

"Don't say that." Vivian shook her head gently. "I only removed the scars. Your features were always lovely. But remember, appearance isn't everything. Some people won't like you regardless - don't let it bother you."

Emily suddenly interjected angrily. "Exactly! Even someone as perfect as Vivian gets accused of killing patients!"

"What?" Fiona looked at Vivian in shock.

"The Bianca Semona incident." Vivian shrugged calmly. "Grieving families say irrational things. I don't take it personally."

"But..." Fiona bit her lip.

Changing the subject, she asked hesitantly, "Will Dr. Fairsprene be coming today?"

Vivian's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Missing him already?"

"I-I was just asking casually!" Fiona's face flushed deeper. "Does he... not want to see me?"

"Of course not." Vivian patted her shoulder. "He's swamped at the hospital. If you want to see him, we can visit directly."

"Really?" Fiona's eyes instantly brightened.

Emily immediately raised her hand. "I'm coming too!"

When they arrived at the hospital, Fiona unexpectedly ordered afternoon tea for a hundred staff members.

"Someone's using hospitality as an excuse?" Emily teased, poking Fiona's side.

Fiona buried her face in her scarf. "That's not it at all!"
###Chapter 635

Sunlight streamed through the car window, illuminating Fiona Grandelle's delicate profile.

She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear hesitantly. "Vivian, how is... the Queen doing lately?"

Vivian Laurent's fingers tightened slightly on the steering wheel.

"Your mother is well." Fiona's voice remained calm. "The baby is healthy too."

Emily Garnache turned in surprise. "Fiona, you already knew?"

Fiona nodded.

"I'll always be her daughter." She gazed at the passing scenery outside. "She's sacrificed so much for me all these years. I'm genuinely happy she's getting what she wished for."

Vivian exhaled quietly in relief.

She'd been worried this news might hurt Fiona.

"And you?" Vivian asked softly. "How have you been feeling?"

She was really inquiring about Killer's condition.

"I'm perfectly fine." Fiona flashed a bright smile.

It seemed she still remained unaware of Killer's existence. Vivian sighed inwardly.

The hospital entrance was crowded with food delivery bikes.

Medical staff clustered around mountains of takeout containers, murmuring in astonishment.

"Who sent all this?"

"I heard it's for Dr. Laurent."

Vivian pushed through the crowd. "These are thank-you gifts for Dr. Fairsprene."

"Dr. Fairsprene?" The staff exchanged confused glances.

Ryan Fairsprene emerged from the ER, startled by the commotion.

"Dr. Laurent, what's all this—"

Fiona peeked out from behind Vivian. "Dr. Fairsprene!"

Though wearing a mask, her luminous eyes made Ryan recognize her instantly.

"Fiona? What brings you here?"

"I missed you." Fiona whispered.

Vivian nudged Ryan. "Let's talk in my office. I'll handle this."

An elderly woman stopped them in the hallway with a knowing smile.

"Dr. Fairsprene, is this your girlfriend? She's lovely."

Fiona's ears turned scarlet.

"Aunt Wang, she's my patient." Ryan explained helplessly.

"A patient, you say..." The woman chuckled meaningfully. "Well, don't let me keep you."

As her footsteps faded away, Fiona kept her head down, her heart pounding wildly.
###Chapter 636
Worlds Apart

Fiona Grandelle followed Ryan Fairsprene into Vivian Laurent's office.

Her slender fingers lingered at the edge of her surgical mask, hesitant to remove it.

This would be Ryan's first time seeing her face post-surgery.

"What's wrong?" Ryan noticed her hesitation.

Fiona took a deep breath and finally removed the mask.

Ryan studied her face for a long moment.

He reached out unexpectedly, fingertips lightly brushing her cheek.

"The recovery is excellent."

Fiona's face flushed crimson.

"All thanks to you and Dr. Laurent."

Her voice grew progressively softer.

"I was so reckless back then..."

Ryan shook his head. "Dr. Laurent's surgical skills deserve the credit. I just assisted."

"That's not true!" Fiona looked up abruptly. "You stayed with me the whole time, telling jokes..."

"That was part of my job." His tone remained neutral.

Fiona bit her lip. "Could you...stop calling me 'Miss'?"

"Hmm?"

"Just call me Fiona." Her eyes shone with hope.

Ryan nodded. "Alright."

"Then can I call you big brother?" Her eyes sparkled.

Ryan hesitated briefly.

"I suppose that's acceptable, given our age difference."

Fiona clapped her hands gleefully. "Brother!"

She stepped closer. "Promise you'll reply when I message you?"

Ryan retreated half a step. "I might be busy with work."

"I don't mind!" She advanced again. "I'll wait."

Tilting her head up, she pleaded, "Brother, show me around Canada?"

Ryan frowned. "I have a packed schedule..."

"Just after dinner tonight!" She tugged his sleeve. "You promised we'd eat together."

Ryan checked his watch. "I may need to work late."

"We'll wait!" Fiona insisted stubbornly. "However long it takes."

Ryan exhaled heavily.

The memory of Queen Eleanor's generous compensation surfaced.

"Fine. See you after work."

Fiona nearly jumped for joy.

She missed the complicated emotion flickering through Ryan's eyes.

A royal princess.

An ordinary doctor.

The chasm between them was simply too vast.
###Chapter 637

The hospital corridor lights were harsh. Vivian Laurent and Fiona Grandelle sat on a bench, waiting for Ryan Fairsprene to finish his last surgery.

"Hungry?" Vivian checked her watch. "Ten more minutes. He should be out soon."

Fiona shook her head, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse. "I'm fine."

The operating room doors finally swung open. Ryan removed his mask with a tired smile. "Sorry for the wait."

They found a Japanese restaurant nearby. Emily Garnache joined them after receiving Vivian's call.

"The salmon here is exceptionally fresh." Emily placed a slice on her plate. "You have to try it."

Midway through dinner, Vivian glanced at the darkening sky outside. "Emily, I'll have Lucas pick you up."

Emily waved her hands. "No need. I can take a cab."

"Already called him." Vivian flashed her phone screen. "He'll be here soon."

Ten minutes later, Lucas Lefèvre pushed through the glass doors. He carried a beige trench coat. "It's windy outside."

Emily's ears turned pink as she accepted the coat with murmured thanks.

Lucas drove with steady precision. The heater hummed softly while a piano concerto played through the speakers.

"We're here." Lucas parked smoothly. "Need me to walk you in?"

Emily unbuckled her seatbelt. "No, thank you."

Meanwhile, Vivian brought Fiona back to the mansion. Finn Deross emerged from the kitchen biting into an apple.

"Well, well." His eyes lit up. "Who's this?"

Vivian stepped between them. "Don't even think about it. She's already taken."

Finn clutched his chest dramatically. "You wound me."

In her bedroom, Fiona chewed her lip. "I...I don't..."

"Not into Ryan?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Then why are you blushing?"

Fiona buried her face in a pillow. "Someone like him would never like someone like me..."

"Silly girl." Vivian ruffled her hair. "You're shopping with Emily tomorrow. Get some rest."

At dawn, Emily arrived buzzing with energy.

"Hot springs!" she announced the moment she entered. "We're going tomorrow!"

Vivian poured coffee. "This is sudden."

"I saw it on a show last night." Emily's eyes sparkled. "They have these amazing milk baths."

Fiona murmured, "I'm fine with anything."

En route to the mall, Vivian checked the rearview mirror. "Don't turn around. We're being followed."

"Should we call the police?" Emily tensed.

Vivian chuckled. "They're mine."
###Chapter 638

The black Maybach glided into the mall's underground parking garage.

Vivian Laurent stepped out in her stilettos, followed closely by Emily Garnache and Fiona Grandelle.

"Look! AN Atelier's new collection display!" Emily's eyes lit up as she tugged Fiona toward the boutique. "It's sold out online. I wonder if they still have stock here."

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Pick whatever you like. My treat."

"But..." Fiona hesitated.

Emily whispered in her ear, "This store belongs to Vivian. Let's make the most of it today!"

Under the bright lights, the two girls happily tried on the latest fashions.

They each selected an outfit they loved.

The trio moved on to other sections.

When they reached the perfume department, Vivian paused.

AN's flagship perfume store stood directly opposite Victoria Roscente's Vine Perfumes boutique.

Bianca Semona stood in the crowd, her gaze locked onto Vivian.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Everyone, look here!" Bianca suddenly shouted. "The owner of this store is a murderer! She killed my parents and got away with it!"

The internet trolls she'd hired immediately swarmed forward.

"A murderer's store? How horrifying!"

"Expose this unscrupulous business!"

"Do rich people think they're above the law? Are our lives worthless?"

The crowd began to stir.

Bianca watched the growing number of onlookers, a cold smirk twisting her lips.

She wouldn't make foolish mistakes anymore.

If she was going to hell, she'd drag Vivian down with her.

Customers fled AN's perfume store in panic.

"Don't buy her products! They bring bad luck!"

"I heard people who use her perfumes suffer misfortune!"

A trembling sales associate tried to explain, "These are malicious lies! Our owner is innocent!"

She fumbled for her phone to call the police.

A hulking man snatched it away. "A murderer dares to call the cops? Should we show the police your crimes?"

Other staff cowered in corners.

"Stay out of this if you know what's good for you," the man growled. "Or else..."

More people gathered outside.

Bianca stood at the center of the crowd, her face twisted with perverse satisfaction.
###Chapter 639

Sunlight spilled across the marble floors of the shopping mall, reflecting blinding glares.

Vivian Laurent's group stepped out of the elevator.

Emily Garnache suddenly stopped. "Isn't that AN Atelier's flagship store? Why's there such a crowd?"

Fiona Grandelle rose on tiptoes. "Must be a product launch. Your store's always so popular, Vivian."

Vivian narrowed her eyes, peering through the crowd.

Her instincts prickled with unease.

These weren't customers. They looked like troublemakers.

Bystanders gathered in small clusters, murmuring among themselves.

"I heard the owner killed someone..."

"No way. This looks like such a high-end place."

Emily's face flushed with anger. "What vicious lies!"

Before Vivian could stop her, Emily charged into the crowd.

"Shut your mouths! I'll call the police on anyone spreading rumors!"

Emily stood on the steps like an enraged lion cub.

The crowd recoiled from her sudden outburst.

The ringleader shoved her. "Who's this brat? None of your business!"

"It is my business!" Emily stood her ground. "Show proof or it's slander!"

The man sneered. "Proof? Everyone knows Vivian Laurent got away with murder!"

"Bullshit! The police ruled it an accident!"

Vivian remained at the crowd's edge, her gaze locked onto Victoria Roscente's store across the way.

Through the glass display, she spotted Bianca Semona lurking in the shadows.

That woman was like a persistent ghost.

Vivian slipped around to the back entrance.

Bianca was fixated on the commotion, a smug smile playing on her lips.

"Enjoying the show?"

The icy voice made Bianca whirl around with a gasp.

Vivian stood inches away. Bianca stumbled back, knocking over a perfume display.
###Chapter 640

"Ah!" Bianca Semona suddenly screamed.

Vivian Laurent curled her lips in a mocking smile. "Your tricks never cease to amaze me, Miss Semona. Instead of wasting energy targeting me, perhaps you should investigate your mother's death."

"How dare you mention my mother!" Bianca's eyes burned red. "You killed her!"

"The forensic report confirmed it was suicide by wrist-cutting," Vivian stated calmly.

"You drove her to it!" Bianca shrieked hysterically. "If you hadn't murdered my father, she would never have—"

Vivian found the foolish woman before her utterly laughable.

"Do you truly believe your mother committed suicide?" Vivian suddenly asked.

Bianca froze. "What do you mean?"

"Did you know the truth about your parents' relationship?" Vivian spoke deliberately. "Your father kept a mistress. Were you aware of that?"

"Lies!" Bianca snapped. "My parents were the epitome of marital bliss!"

"Clearly, you know nothing." Vivian's lips curled coldly. "Then I suppose you're equally ignorant about your mother rekindling her first love?"

"Shut up!" Bianca trembled with rage. "Stop spreading filthy rumors!"

Vivian produced a business card from her purse. "This is her first love's contact. Tell him you're Bianca Semona. He'll give you the truth."

Bianca stood stunned.

If her mother hadn't died for her father's sake... then how? The forensics clearly showed wrist wounds.

That final phone call. Those cryptic text messages.

"You expect me to believe you?" Bianca forced defiance into her voice.

"Believe what you will." Vivian's tone turned icy. "Use that pig brain of yours. Unless you want your parents' deaths to remain unsolved."

Bianca bit her lip until it bled.

Then—a familiar figure flashed at the edge of her vision. The mysterious woman who'd saved her before!

Clarity struck Bianca like lightning.

This was all Vivian's scheme!

"Help! Murderer!" Bianca suddenly screamed.

Heads turned throughout the crowd.

Seizing Vivian's hand, Bianca pressed it against her own throat while shrieking: "First my parents, now me? Are you silencing witnesses in broad daylight?"
###Chapter 641

"Someone's been murdered! Call an ambulance!" A shrill scream shattered the mall's tranquility.

The crowd erupted into chaos instantly, bystanders pulling out phones to record the scene.

Security chief rushed upstairs with his team just as Ethan Roscente pushed through the gathering crowd. He'd been waiting outside for Vivian Laurent when the commotion drew him in.

"Move aside!" Ethan's voice was dangerously low.

Bianca Semona clutched Vivian's wrist with desperate strength, pressing it against her own throat. Her face had gone deathly pale, lips tinged blue, body swaying unsteadily.

Vivian yanked her hand free. Bianca collapsed to the floor like a marionette with cut strings.

"There's a dead body!" someone shrieked, scrambling backward.

"That woman did it!" multiple voices accused simultaneously.

Emily Garnache emerged from the throng. "Lies! Dr. Laurent would never hurt anyone!"

Ethan crouched beside Bianca, fingers finding her pulse point. "Steady breathing. Normal pulse."

Vivian's lips curled coldly. "She can't even fake unconsciousness convincingly."

Fiona Grandelle trembled. "I saw it—Ms. Semona grabbed Dr. Laurent's hand herself."

"They're in cahoots!" a heckler shouted from the crowd.

Vivian squeezed Fiona's icy fingers. "Don't be afraid."

She addressed the onlookers with measured calm. "I'm Vivian Laurent from Seattle General Hospital's Surgery Department. Also founder of AN Atelier. Verify my credentials if you doubt me."

Murmurs rippled through the gathering:

"The doctor who cured terminal liver cancer?"

"My aunt had surgery performed by her!"

"I heard she turned down a multimillion-dollar offer from Johns Hopkins..."

The tide of opinion shifted subtly. The weight of her medical credentials altered the atmosphere.

Bianca lay motionless on the floor—but her eyelashes fluttered almost imperceptibly.
###Chapter 642

Vivian Laurent's lips curved slightly. "She's not unconscious at all. It's all an act."

Internet trolls immediately jumped in to refute. "Who says it's an act? Everyone saw you choking her until she passed out!"

Ethan Roscente frowned deeply and stepped forward to argue, but Vivian grabbed his arm.

She shook her head subtly, signaling she would handle this.

"I'm a doctor," Vivian said coolly. "Since you don't believe me, let's make a bet."

"What kind of bet?" the troll challenged.

"A bet on whether she's faking it." Vivian's gaze turned sharp. "If I win, you'll apologize publicly, reveal who hired you, and turn yourself in to the police."

The troll smirked inwardly. There was no way Bianca Semona would wake up on her own.

"And if you lose?"

"Do whatever you want with me." Vivian's response was crisp.

"Deal!" The troll raised his voice. "But no violent methods to wake her up!"

Vivian scoffed. "Relax. I just want to offer her some tea."

The crowd exchanged puzzled glances. Could tea really expose a fake faint?

Vivian beckoned to a nearby little boy. "Can you help me with something?"

The boy bounced over eagerly.

She whispered something in his ear, and the child nodded before scampering off.

Bianca's heart pounded as she lay on the ground. She kept her eyes tightly shut, palms slick with sweat.

Soon the boy returned, pinching his nose and holding a disposable cup.

Inside sloshed a pale yellow liquid with a pungent odor.

Ethan's eyes narrowed as he intercepted the cup first.

"Is that...urine?" Onlookers recoiled.

Vivian remained unruffled. "Like I said, just offering her some tea."

Bianca's body went rigid. This bitch actually wanted to force her to drink piss!

But in her "unconscious" state, she didn't dare even twitch a finger.
###Chapter 643

Vivian Laurent knelt on one knee, supporting the limp Bianca Semona.

She glanced at Ethan Roscente with a meaningful look. "Pass me the tea."

Bianca's body trembled slightly, her fingertips icy cold.

Vivian could feel the deliberately suppressed rhythm of her breathing.

The teacup containing pale yellow liquid was handed over. Ethan frowned and turned his face away.

As the rim neared, a pungent odor assaulted their senses.

Bianca's stomach churned, her throat convulsing.

"Since you fainted, this will help moisten your throat." Vivian pushed the cup closer.

The edge touched Bianca's lips.

A slight tilt would send the liquid pouring into her mouth.

Bianca clenched her teeth.

She could endure humiliation, but she would never actually drink this.

"Now." Vivian's voice sharpened.

"Gah—!" Bianca shoved Vivian away and collapsed onto the floor, retching violently.

Vivian rose gracefully, brushing nonexistent dust from her skirt.

The crowd erupted.

"Such convincing acting!"

"Scammers these days are getting more sophisticated."

Bianca glared up from the floor. "Vivian! You dared to trick me into drinking piss!"

"I said it was tea." Vivian swirled the cup. "Care for a taste?"

"Stop playing dumb! If you're so bold, drink it yourself!"

Vivian arched a brow. "If I do, you'll apologize publicly and never harass me again."

Emily Garnache gripped Fiona Grandelle's arm nervously.

Ethan stared at the suspicious liquid, his expression dark.

Bianca's eyes flickered.

She refused to believe Vivian would actually drink it—this had to be a bluff.

"Fine! But if you back out, you must confess your crimes!"

"Deal." Vivian raised the cup.

Just as she was about to drink, Ethan seized her wrist.

"Let me." His voice was low, brooking no argument.

Vivian met his deep, worried gaze.
###Chapter 644

Vivian stared at him. "Do you know what's in this cup?"

Ethan shook his head.

The liquid had an odd color and an even stranger smell—nothing like ordinary tea.

"What if it's urine?" Vivian pressed.

Without hesitation, Ethan replied, "I'll drink it."

The determination in his eyes sent a tremor through her heart.

This man was willing to go that far for her.

She had never believed his sweet words before.

Yet in every crisis, he was always the first to stand in front of her.

Even now, knowing it might be something vile, he stepped forward without flinching.

A bittersweet ache spread through Vivian's chest.

She shouldn’t be moved.

But her heartbeat betrayed her, racing uncontrollably.

"No need." She snatched the cup back and downed it in one gulp.

It was just a special floral tea from her shop.

She had deliberately chosen the variety that most resembled urine in color.

The child's disgusted act was all part of the psychological setup.

With Isabella's flawless performance, the trap was set perfectly.

Bianca took the bait.

Ethan took the half-empty cup and sipped from the exact spot her lips had touched.

"AN signature floral tea," Vivian announced to the crowd. "Detoxifying and refreshing. Feel free to try."

"Impossible!" Bianca shrieked. "She must have drunk urine!"

Vivian was prepared.

She handed the remaining tea to a bystander. "See for yourself."

Someone took a whiff. "It's definitely tea."

The little boy stepped forward. "She just asked me to walk past the restroom."

Bianca paled.

"Your own guilt betrayed you," Vivian said coldly. "Now, it's time to honor your promise."
###Chapter 645

Bianca Semona's face turned deathly pale as she glared at Vivian Laurent.

"You set me up!" she spat through gritted teeth.

Vivian curled her lips in disdain.

"Everyone saw what happened. How exactly did I set you up?"

"You were the one who grabbed my hand and pressed it to your neck."

"I merely offered you tea. It was your own guilt that made you refuse."

Whispers broke out among the onlookers.

"What an actress."

"She falsely accused someone of murder first."

"Now that she's been exposed, she's trying to flip the script."

Bianca's fingers clenched until her knuckles turned white at the murmurs around her.

"What do any of you know?!" she suddenly shrieked.

"My parents are dead! How dare you judge me?"

The crowd fell silent.

Vivian regarded her coldly.

"Using your parents' deaths to play the victim? Are you even fit to call yourself their daughter?"

Bianca trembled violently.

"I'll kill myself! You're all driving me to it!"

Someone immediately pulled out their phone.

"Call the police! This woman's lost her mind!"

Several bystanders blocked Bianca's attempt to flee.

"You're not going anywhere until the police arrive."

"If you actually hurt yourself, we can't take that responsibility."

Bianca looked around in despair.

Not a single person stood on her side.

At last, she realized the game was over.
###Chapter 646

"Move aside!" Bianca Semona shrieked hysterically. The crowd recoiled at her frenzied appearance.

Vivian Laurent clamped down on her wrist. "Trying to leave?"

"What more do you want?" Bianca struggled.

"Apologize." Vivian's voice was glacial. "You promised."

Bianca gritted her teeth. "I won't. What can you do about it?"

"Then you're not going anywhere." Vivian tightened her grip.

Bianca gasped in pain. "I'm sorry!"

"Be specific." Vivian remained unmoved.

"You—" Hatred flashed in Bianca's eyes. "Fine! I'm sorry! I shouldn't have framed you. My parents' deaths had nothing to do with you!"

Vivian finally released her. "Get lost."

Bianca staggered away, her retreating figure pitiful.

The onlookers regarded Vivian with admiration.

"Show's over." Vivian said calmly. "AN Atelier's products are perfectly safe."

The crowd gradually dispersed.

"Viv, you were amazing!" Emily Garnache bounced excitedly. "Did you see Bianca's face?"

Fiona Grandelle nodded vigorously. "She deserved it!"

Vivian smirked. "She thought fainting would earn sympathy."

Ethan Roscente stood nearby, his gaze inscrutable.

"Thanks for earlier." Vivian glanced at him.

"For what?" Ethan arched a brow.

"Don't play dumb." She snorted.

He chuckled lowly. "I'd prefer tangible gratitude."

"Such as?"

"Such as..." He stepped closer.

Vivian raised a threatening hand. "Want a beating?"
###Chapter 647

Ethan Roscente tactfully excused himself, leaving the three women to their conversation.

Vivian Laurent felt an unsettling gaze on her back, but saw nothing when she glanced around.

In a shadowed corner of the mall, Annika Heilbronn glared at Bianca Semona through clenched teeth.

"With your intelligence, you think you can compete against Vivian?" Annika spat in frustration.

Bianca retorted defiantly, "If you were here, why didn't you help me?"

...

During the return trip, Emily Garnache excitedly planned tomorrow's hot spring visit.

That evening, she had a box of swimwear delivered.

"Vivian, this one would look amazing on you!" Emily held up a barely-there bikini.

Vivian touched her slightly rounded abdomen. "I'd prefer something more modest."

She ultimately chose a one-piece, while Emily picked a pink cartoon-print design. Fiona Grandelle selected a conventional two-piece.

"What a waste!" Emily sighed at the box of unused sexy swimsuits. "Vivian, do you have any breast enhancement pills?"

Vivian chuckled. "I'm afraid not."

Emily gazed longingly at Vivian's curves. "When will I grow like that?"

"It's genetics." Vivian pinched her cheek affectionately.

Fiona reassured, "You're still young, Emily."

"I just hope we don't run into that Bianca tomorrow." Emily's tone shifted, her eyes clouding with concern.

Vivian gazed pensively out the window, where phantom eyes seemed to glimmer in the darkness.
###Chapter 648

Bianca Semona didn't show up, but an unexpected guest arrived—Liam Valdemar.

Liam stood before Vivian Laurent, his voice soft. "Can I come with you?"

His long bangs partially obscured his eyes, giving him an air of quiet innocence.

"Viv, who's this?" Emily Garnache studied Liam with curiosity.

Vivian gave a brief introduction. "My friend, Liam Valdemar."

"Wow, another handsome guy! How do you always have such amazing men around you?" Emily couldn't help but exclaim.

Liam smiled faintly. "I can protect you."

"Of course you're welcome!" Emily and Fiona Grandelle replied in unison.

Emily blinked playfully. "So, are you trying to pursue our Vivian?"

"Emily!" Vivian frowned.

"What? I'm just asking." Emily stuck out her tongue.

Liam's gaze settled on Vivian, his tone serious. "I'd like to, but I don't know if she'll give me the chance."

Vivian shifted uncomfortably under his stare.

"Stop joking. We've known each other for years—we're practically siblings." Vivian waved a hand dismissively. "He's just teasing, right, Liam?"

Liam lowered his lashes. "Right. Just a joke."

At the entrance, Ethan Roscente watched the scene with cold eyes. Seeing Liam preparing to join them, his expression darkened further.

"Vivian." Ethan strode forward.

"Hello, brother-in-law." Fiona greeted him politely.

Vivian frowned. "Don't follow us. With Liam here, we'll be safe."

Ethan glared at Liam. "If he can go, why can't I?"

"Because—" Vivian faltered.

Liam spoke calmly. "Vivian and I are close."

"Either way, you're not coming!" Vivian's tone was firm. "If you keep following me, don't expect to see me again!"

Her hand instinctively brushed her slightly rounded stomach.

Ethan narrowed his eyes but finally relented. "Fine. I won't follow."

He turned and dialed Felix Valdemar's number. "Let's go to the hot springs."
###Chapter 649 

Felix Valdemar lounged lazily on the sofa, fingers drumming against the armrest. "Just the two of us at the hot springs? That sounds... awkward."

Ethan Roscente's gaze flickered, realizing they should invite more people. He dialed Finn Deross. "Free tonight? Let's hit the Alpine Resort."

Finn paused mid-training session. "Master Zero is going? Count me in!"

After hanging up, Finn immediately contacted Lucas Lefèvre and Isabella Langley. He specifically warned Isabella, "Felix will be there."

A cold laugh came through the phone. "Oh, I'm definitely going."

"You don't mind being around Felix?" Finn asked cautiously.

Isabella's voice dripped with danger. "He should be the one worried. That lecherous bastard is only going to ogle women. Hope his eyeballs rot."

Finn silently wiped sweat from his brow.

When the group arrived at the resort, Vivian Laurent had just changed. Her eyes widened at the unexpected crowd. "What are you all doing here?"

Spotting Ethan, she glared. "I told you not to follow me."

Ethan feigned innocence. "Pure coincidence. We planned this relaxation trip with Felix."

Vivian gave him an unimpressed look.

"Isabella, Lucas—over here." She beckoned them. "Stay away from those two."

Isabella immediately linked arms with Vivian, shooting Felix a challenging stare.

Felix scoffed. "Since when are we 'those two'?"

"Don't like it? Leave," Isabella snapped.

Ethan calmly trailed behind Vivian, his gaze never leaving her.

In the hot springs area, the women changed into swimsuits Emily Garnache had prepared. When they emerged, the hallway seemed to brighten.

Vivian wore a modest one-piece, yet the curves of her slender figure were unmistakable. Water droplets trailed down her graceful neck, pooling momentarily in the hollow of her collarbone.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. He'd never seen Vivian like this—damp hair clinging to her cheeks, skin glowing like pearls, every step sending vibrations through his chest.

A possessive urge surged—he wanted to hide her away, shield her from every other gaze.

Sensing Ethan's scorching stare, Vivian instinctively covered her abdomen. Thankfully, the loose swimwear concealed her little secret.
###Chapter 650

Felix Valdemar's gaze locked onto Isabella Langley. He'd always thought her intimidating, but never imagined her swimsuit would reveal such a stunning figure.

Isabella instantly sensed his stare and turned to meet his eyes.

"Keep looking and I'll gouge those eyes out," she hissed.

Felix remained silent.

Still the same old tigress. Some things never changed.

"I only glanced."

"Not even a glance! Who gave you permission to look at me?"

"What about them?" Felix pointed at Lucas Lefèvre and Liam Valdemar.

"They're different. You're you!"

"Fine. Then don't look at me later either."

Isabella scoffed. "What's there to see? Even if you stripped naked, I wouldn't bat an eye."

Felix raised an eyebrow. "You said it."

He grabbed Ethan Roscente's arm. "Let's go change, Boss Ethan."

Men changed quickly. Soon they emerged in swim trunks.

Felix deliberately circled in front of Isabella, flexing his toned abs.

"Well? Don't fall for me now," he gloated.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Narcissist! Look at Ethan and Lucas - either could outshine you."

"I'll concede Boss Ethan, but Lucas? That scrawny frame can't compare."

Finn Deross timidly raised his hand. "I'm only sixteen... still growing..."

"I'm clearly the best! Want to settle this properly?"

"Psycho!" Isabella turned away. "Not everyone's obsessed with ogling women like you."

She took Vivian Laurent and the other girls straight to the hot springs without looking back.

Felix deflated like a punctured balloon.

"Boss Ethan... is my physique really that bad?" he asked pitifully.

Ethan gave him a knowing look. "You care so much about her opinion... could it be you like her?"

"Impossible!" Felix bristled. "That tigress? I'd rather stay single forever than like her!"

"You seem pretty desperate."

"Don't joke like that, Boss Ethan!"

"If you don't like her, why care whether she finds you attractive?" Ethan's words struck home.
###Chapter 651

Steam swirled in the hot spring pool. Felix Valdemar's frown deepened after hearing Blake Roland's words.

He slapped the water's surface hard, sending droplets flying.

"Who cares if she looks at me?" Felix muttered under his breath, yet his gaze involuntarily drifted toward the opposite side.

Like Isabella Langley?

The thought had barely formed when he shook his head violently, as if trying to dislodge something filthy.

The men's and women's sections were separated only by a sheer gauze partition.

The delicate fabric swayed gently in the rising steam, offering glimpses of silhouettes on the other side.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the pool's edge, his piercing gaze penetrating the translucent barrier to lock onto one particular figure.

Even through the misty haze, Vivian Laurent stood out to him like the brightest star in the night sky.

"Boss Ethan, you can actually tell who's who?" Felix squinted through the steam.

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Naturally."

Felix scoffed, yet somehow picked out Isabella's unmistakable outline among the four blurred shapes.

That woman carried herself with such audacity - even a curtain couldn't contain her flamboyant energy.

"That damn Felix is definitely peeking!" Isabella suddenly rose from the water in the women's section.

Droplets cascaded down her curves.

Before Vivian could react, Isabella stormed toward the partition.

With a sharp rustle, she yanked the gauze aside.

"Felix Valdemar! What vile scheme are you plotting now?" Hands on hips, water still dripping from her hair.

Felix nearly leapt from the pool. "Have you lost your mind? This is the men's section!"

He sank lower into the water, ears burning crimson.

"Guilty conscience?" Isabella's laugh was icy. "Dare to peek but not admit it?"

"Who's peeking at you!" Felix's neck stiffened defensively. "If anything, you're the one trying to get an eyeful of me!"

He deliberately puffed out his chest, sending water splashing.

Isabella took a disgusted step back. "Please. Male models at clubs have better physiques than you."

"Really? And how many have you seen?" Felix shot back. "Too bad there's only us here. Take it or leave it."

Isabella's fists clenched audibly.

This man was begging for a beating!

After one final glare, she whirled around to leave.

Just before the curtain fell back into place, Felix's taunting voice followed her: "Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Miss Langley!"
###Chapter 652

"I can't be bothered with you!" Isabella Langley turned on her heel and walked away.

Returning to her seat, she immediately complained to Vivian Laurent. "That Felix Valdemar is utterly unreasonable. The man's narcissism knows no bounds."

Emily Garnache suppressed a smile. "I actually think you two would make a good match."

"A match?" Isabella's eyes widened dramatically. "Don't be ridiculous! We're like oil and water. Every time we meet, it's nothing but irritation. All he does is flirt with young girls. He was even obsessed with some manipulative woman before she got what she deserved."

Emily gasped, covering her mouth. "That's quite the scandal!"

"He's got plenty more outrageous stories where that came from." Isabella continued her tirade without restraint.

Felix's voice carried across the room. "I can hear you, you know!"

"Good!" Isabella raised her voice. "Maybe you'll finally realize how ridiculous you are!"

Their verbal sparring held an odd synchrony. Vivian, long accustomed to their dynamic, simply shook her head with an amused smile.

A waitress approached with their drinks.

"Your lemonade, ma'am." The server spoke softly.

Vivian looked up, her pupils contracting slightly. "Annika?"

Annika Heilbronn feigned surprise. "Dr. Laurent, what a coincidence."

"You work here?"

"Just a weekend job." Annika smiled shyly. "I didn't expect to see you here."

Emily leaned forward curiously. "Viv, who's this?"

The moment everyone saw Annika's face, they froze—she bore an uncanny resemblance to Vivian.

"One of my former patients." Vivian offered a brief explanation.

Emily suddenly stood. "Wait here a moment!"

She hurried to the dressing room and returned clutching a wad of cash.

"This is for you." Emily pressed the money into Annika's hand. "I didn't bring much today."

Though she called it "not much," the thick stack equaled an average person's monthly salary. Emily acted purely from kindness, seeing someone her age working hard and knowing she was Vivian's patient.

Annika's fingers trembled slightly.

She stared at the cash, a shadow flickering in her eyes. Was this charity for a beggar? First Vivian humiliated her with a meal, now her friend trampled on her dignity with money?

Rage boiled in her chest. She nearly threw the bills back in the girl's face.
###Chapter 653

"I don't need it." Annika Heilbronn refused coldly.

Emily Garnache smiled warmly. "Don't be shy, take it."

Fiona Grandelle chimed in, "In our country, attendants always accept tips." She turned to grab a stack of bills and shoved them at Annika.

Annika left with a darkened expression. Around the corner, she violently threw the money into a trash bin.

How dare they pity her? This was the ultimate insult!

Returning to the pantry, Annika abruptly stopped.

"Master..." Her cheeks flushed as her voice trembled slightly.

Liam Valdemar wore swim trunks with a T-shirt covering his torso. The terrifying scars peeked through, tracing his powerful muscle definition.

"Why are you here?" Liam's voice was icy.

Annika bit her lip. "I just wanted to see you...and Shadow. I won't cause trouble, just...make friends." She flashed an innocent smile.

"Leave. Now."

"Master!" Annika's eyes reddened. "Walking away now would look more suspicious. I promise not to approach Shadow—"

After a tense silence, Liam turned away. "Remember your words."

Annika watched his retreating figure, nails digging into her palms. She would get close to Vivian Laurent. She would replace that bitch!

Behind the gauze partition, Liam called softly, "Vivian."

"Hmm?"

"Come here."

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes as Vivian wrapped herself in a bath towel and followed Liam to the corner. What was that man planning?

"Ethan's been bothering you lately." Liam's voice carried lethal intent. "Need me to handle it?"

Vivian shook her head. "Ignore him."

"You still have feelings for him?" Liam's gaze darkened dangerously.

No one would lay a finger on his girl. Not while he breathed.
###Chapter 654

"This isn't about preference." Vivian sighed softly. "Liam, we live in a society governed by law, not the DarkKingdom. Everyone has the right to choose their own path."

She couldn't bear seeing him apply the organization's ruthless methods here.

Though Sophia Sherwood's death had another perpetrator, Vivian still harbored doubts about Liam's involvement.

"You're protecting him." His voice turned icy.

Forbidding him from acting clearly meant she still cared for that man.

"You've misunderstood."

"Shadow." Liam suddenly grew serious. "Do you despise me?"

"Of course not."

He lowered his gaze. "If my presence troubles you, I can leave."

"I'm content with my life now. Seeing you well is enough for me."

"Liam, that's not what I meant." Vivian's voice held urgency.

She simply didn't know how to explain. He was accustomed to the DarkKingdom's law of the jungle, but the real world required adherence to rules.

"Truly?" His eyes lifted. "Don't force yourself. Say the word, and I'll disappear."

"Stay." Vivian met his gaze firmly. "You protected me in the DarkKingdom. You'll always be my dearest friend."

Liam stared intently. "Just a friend?"

Her pulse quickened.

"I..."

"From our first meeting, you stood apart." His voice dropped. "Before I could confess, you vanished."

"Shadow, do I have a chance now? I want to shield you forever."

Though unspoken, his feelings lay bare.

Had Vivian looked up, she'd have seen the possessive storm in his eyes.

The confession caught her off guard. She'd never considered Liam in that light.

Instinctively shielding her abdomen, she stepped back. "I'm sorry. I've only ever seen you as family. If I misled you, I apologize."

"We can still be friends, right?"

The corner of his mouth twitched. "Of course."

The icy glint vanished instantly. Truthfully, he'd known four years ago—Vivian's heart held no place for him.

That mission. That "accident"...

Vivian should have died four years ago. If he couldn't have her, then they'd burn together.

Vivian. And Ethan Roscente.
###Chapter 655

Liam's words acted like a key, unlocking long-buried memories in Vivian's mind.

She sat alone on the lounge chair, the sea breeze tousling her hair but failing to dispel the chaos in her thoughts.

Ethan appeared without warning.

The crisp scent of pinewood accompanied his arrival.

"Vivian." His deep voice startled her from her reverie.

Her head jerked up, hands instinctively shielding her abdomen.

The subtle swell beneath her bath towel remained perfectly concealed.

"What did Liam tell you?" Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"None of your business."

"The way he looks at you unsettles me." His knuckles whitened. "Like a leopard stalking prey."

Vivian scoffed. "And you?"

"I'm different." He leaned in abruptly. "I'm courting you."

Heat rushed to her ears.

She turned away, heart pounding.

Both men had confessed, yet Liam's words only confused her while Ethan's ignited sparks in her chest.

"Stay away from him." His voice turned gravelly. "I don't trust him."

Vivian stood abruptly. "I don't need your protection!"

Dizziness struck without warning.

Her knees buckled as she pitched forward.

Strong arms caught her effortlessly.

Ethan's palm pressed against her waist, warmth seeping through the thin fabric.

Their gazes locked, the air between them thickening.

She caught the faint scent of tobacco on him.

His hand hovered mere inches from her hidden pregnancy.

The baby chose that moment to kick.

Vivian froze.

Ethan misinterpreted her reaction.

His eyes darkened as they dropped to her flushed lips, Adam's apple bobbing.

"You've gained weight," he remarked suddenly.

Her heart skipped.

"Softer here." His fingers absently traced circles on her waist.

He leaned closer until their breaths mingled. In his stormy gaze, she saw hunger rising like a tide.
###Chapter 656

Vivian's breath hitched.

Ethan's face was mere inches away, his subtle cologne filling her senses. Every rational thought screamed at her to push him away, yet her body remained frozen under some invisible spell.

His lips descended just as her fingertips barely grazed his forearm.

The kiss was relentless.

Ethan moved like a starved beast, devouring her essence. Four excruciating months had passed since their last embrace on Santorini Island.

Four months of misunderstandings. Every attempt to close the distance had been met with Vivian's defensive thorns.

Now, finally tasting her again, Ethan lost all restraint. He nipped at her lower lip, seizing the moment of her surprise to deepen the kiss.

Vivian's eyes flew open.

She could count each individual lash framing Ethan's intense gaze. His familiar scent overwhelmed her, dragging memories of that rain-soaked night to the surface.

A soft whimper escaped her throat.

The sound drove Ethan wild. One hand cradled the back of her head while the other traced dangerous paths along her waistline. Thank God he didn't venture lower—where the slightest swell had begun to show.

In the shadows, Liam's knuckles turned bone-white.

He watched the entangled pair with murderous intent. Why did Ethan get to touch her like this? He'd known Vivian first, stood by her through the darkest nights.

Yet she wouldn't even let him hold her hand.

"Ah!" Emily's startled shriek shattered the moment.

The girl covered her eyes and spun away. "I saw nothing!"

Vivian shoved Ethan back violently.

Her lips glistened, cheeks burning scarlet. "Don't follow me!" she spat before fleeing the hot springs like the devil himself chased her.

Back in her room, Vivian slumped against the door, struggling to steady her breathing.

Ethan's heat still lingered on her mouth. As her fingers brushed her abdomen, the baby kicked sharply.

"Missing Daddy already?" she murmured.

Please...he couldn't have noticed. Right?
###Chapter 657

Vivian's figure vanished down the hallway, her hurried footsteps resembling a frantic escape.

Ethan's lips curved slightly, a glimmer of amusement flickering in his eyes. The stalemate between him and Vivian had finally shifted.

He rubbed his fingertips, as if still feeling the warmth of her lips. If only he could take things further—make her stop avoiding him.

As he turned to return to his room, a sharp gaze pierced through him.

Liam stood in the shadows, his eyes cold as ice. Clearly, he had witnessed everything.

Ethan ignored him and moved to leave.

But Liam suddenly stepped forward, blocking his path. The air instantly turned frigid.

"Stay away from her." Liam's voice was laced with venom. "You don't deserve to stand by her side."

He had long wanted to eliminate this man. He should have acted before the situation escalated—now, every glance at Ethan only fueled his irritation.

Ethan smirked. "I don’t deserve her? Then do you?"

Their gazes clashed, sparks flying.

Liam's identity as a shadow agent gave him an aura of lethality that would make ordinary men cower. But Ethan didn’t flinch, meeting his stare head-on.

"What can you give her?" Liam pressed forward. "Nothing but pain. You two are over."

Ethan remained unmoved. "Over? That’s for me to decide."

Liam's eyes flashed coldly. "Keep harassing her, and I’ll make you disappear without a trace."

"Try it." Ethan suddenly grinned. "If I vanish, do you really think she’ll turn to you?"

Liam's fist clenched abruptly.

"You knew her before I did, yet you still couldn’t win her heart." Ethan's words struck like daggers. "Forcing her to stay—is that your idea of love?"

"Shut up!" Liam swung his fist without warning.

Ethan dodged effortlessly, countering with a punch of his own.

In an instant, the two men were locked in combat.
###Chapter 658

Liam never expected Ethan to move so swiftly. The crushing punch left his cheek burning. Refusing to back down, he retaliated with a sharp counterattack. Within seconds, the two grown men were locked in a brutal brawl.

The commotion drew Emily's attention. She rushed over in panic.

"Stop it! Both of you!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. Frustrated, she dialed Vivian's number.

Vivian clenched her teeth when she received the call. These two troublemakers were testing her patience. She dropped everything and hurried to the scene.

Though untrained in combat, Ethan had never lost a fight. Liam excelled with weapons but struggled barehanded. Their battle raged fiercely.

By the time Vivian arrived, both men bore visible injuries.

"Enough!" Her sharp command cut through the air.

The effect was instantaneous. They froze mid-strike, exchanging glares before reluctantly separating.

Ethan's lip was split, Liam's eye swollen shut. Neither had emerged victorious.

Vivian took a deep breath, fury simmering beneath her composed exterior. "You're grown men acting like schoolyard bullies. Are you proud of yourselves?"

"Need more time to settle this? By all means, continue. I won't interfere."

The two formidable figures now resembled chastised children, heads bowed in silence.

Ethan ventured weakly, "We were just..."

"Quiet!" Vivian snapped. "Ethan Roscente, since when did brawling become your hobby? Perhaps you should consider professional boxing if you've got energy to spare!"

He ducked his head. "My apologies."

A throbbing headache pulsed at Vivian's temples. She knew this nonsense stemmed from their rivalry over her.

"Next time, I'll be the one throwing punches," she warned, shaking a fist at Ethan.

Despite the scolding, warmth spread through his chest. Her anger meant she cared. The polite distance she maintained with Liam only confirmed it.

"Understood. It won't happen again."

After ensuring both men were stable, Vivian went to fetch medical supplies. She spotted Annika passing by.

"Annika!" she called out.

The young woman turned, masking her distaste behind a neutral expression. "Dr. Laurent?"

"Could you assist me with some ointment? My friends have injuries."

"Friends?" Annika's pulse spiked. Had her mentor been hurt?

"Yes."

"I'll retrieve the supplies."

"Thank you."

Annika returned promptly with the medication. Vivian had changed from her swimwear into casual attire, waiting outside.

She fixed Ethan with a warning glare. "Stay put."

With the ointment in hand, she went to tend to Liam's wounds.
###Chapter 659

Vivian retrieved two tubes of ointment from the medical kit and handed one to Liam.

"Anti-inflammatory." She paused. "Apply it."

Liam accepted the tube, his fingertips brushing against the cool surface.

"And this." Vivian passed him a small mirror.

He glanced up, noticing she kept only one tube for herself.

"Stop fighting." Her voice was soft. "It's not worth it."

Liam's Adam's apple bobbed. Was she worried about him?

Vivian turned toward Ethan, shoving the remaining ointment and cotton swabs into his hands.

"Do it yourself."

Ethan fumbled with the cap, hissing when the swab touched his wound.

"Hopeless." Vivian snatched the supplies back.

Ethan obediently tilted his face up, a foolish grin still playing on his lips.

She pressed firmly on the bruise along his cheekbone.

"Ow!"

"Now it hurts?" Vivian glared. "Do you even know who Liam is? If he'd fought seriously, you'd be dead."

"He threw the first punch." Ethan pouted. "Besides, keeping someone that dangerous close to you is reckless."

Vivian's hand stilled.

"He wouldn't."

"Four years changes people." Ethan's expression turned grave. "You don't know who he is anymore."

"Shut up." She raised the swab threateningly.

Ethan immediately fell silent, though his eyes sparkled.

Her fingertips, cool with ointment, brushed lightly over his injuries.

Ethan held his breath.

Across the room, Liam stood in the shadows.

He watched Vivian's faint frown as she tended to Ethan.

Noticed the unconscious gentleness of her movements.

And saw the undisguised joy in Ethan's gaze.

"Master?"

Annika appeared behind him without warning.

"Your face..." She stared at his injuries. "Did Ethan do this?"

Liam turned away.

Annika followed. "You're just letting it go?"

He didn't stop walking.

Back in his room, Liam tossed the ointment onto the desk.

The mirror reflected a man with split lips and stormy eyes.

Memories from four years ago flashed through his mind—

Vivian collapsing in a pool of blood.

Ethan cradling her broken body, weeping.

Liam's fist clenched slowly.

If he couldn't have her...

Then no one would.
###Chapter 660

"I'm going back to my room." Vivian finished bandaging Ethan's wound and turned to leave without another word.

Ethan silently watched her retreating figure until the door clicked shut behind her.

At dinner time, Fiona was the first to knock on Vivian's door.

"Vivi, why are you always hiding in your room?" Fiona pouted, clearly annoyed. "Everyone's waiting for you."

Vivian rubbed her temples. "I'm not feeling well. You guys go ahead."

"Are you okay?" Fiona immediately grew concerned.

"I'm fine. I am a doctor, remember?" Vivian forced a small smile.

The answer seemed to reassure Fiona. After dinner, Vivian politely declined all invitations and returned to her room alone.

As night fell, a bonfire party started on the beach. Vivian sat in a corner, indifferent to the aroma of grilled meat. Ethan appeared with his comically bruised face, drawing curious glances from the crowd.

"Fell down," he deadpanned.

The firelight softened Vivian's profile. Ethan's gaze lingered on her until the party ended.

Before returning to his room, Ethan stopped by the kitchen to prepare a bowl of fruit yogurt.

A knock sounded at Vivian's door.

"Who is it?" she asked warily.

"Me." Ethan's deep voice carried through the wood.

"What do you want?"

"You didn't eat tonight." He held up the glass bowl. "Brought you a snack."

After a brief hesitation, Vivian opened the door. Ethan's imposing frame filled the doorway, his bruises stark under the light.

"I'm not hungry," she said coldly.

Ethan pushed past her anyway. "Save it for later."

He strode to the coffee table and set down the bowl, making no move to leave.

"You can go now," Vivian frowned.

"I'll wait until you finish." He settled onto the sofa, clearly intending to stay.

Vivian instantly regretted letting him in. But the yogurt smelled enticing, topped with fresh fruit. She took a tentative bite—the perfect balance of sweet and tart.

Before she knew it, the bowl was empty.

"Done." She set down the spoon. "Now will you leave?"

Ethan suddenly grabbed a tissue. "You've got some on your mouth."

Vivian recoiled. "I can do it myself."

"Hold still." He gripped her shoulder. "Returning the favor."

His eyes dropped to her yogurt-stained lips. Just as the tissue was about to make contact, Ethan abruptly leaned in and kissed the corner of her mouth.

Vivian's eyes widened. The liar! He'd promised to wipe it off!

Twice in one day—he'd done it again!
###Chapter 661

Ethan Roscente's lips sealed over Vivian Laurent's in a possessive kiss.

His tongue demanded entry with primal urgency, tasting her sweetness like a starving man.

Too long deprived of her essence, Ethan teetered on the edge of control.

His body responded instantly, hardening with desire.

Strong arms locked around Vivian's slender waist, refusing to relinquish their prize.

The unfinished kiss from earlier now found its completion.

Ethan devoured her with bruising intensity, as if trying to consume her whole.

Vivian's breath came in ragged gasps.

Her traitorous body arched into his embrace.

Months of pent-up desire fueled Ethan's every movement.

Each touch burned with the desperation of a predator claiming its mate.

"Ethan..." Vivian's voice fractured into breathless fragments.

Her weak push against his chest lacked conviction.

Knees buckling, she melted against him completely.

The darkening of Ethan's gaze betrayed his awareness of her surrender.

He guided her backward until the mattress swallowed them whole.

Their mouths remained fused in heated combat.

Ethan's hands slipped beneath Vivian's flimsy nightgown with practiced ease.

Fingertips tracing delicate skin elicited tremors through her frame.

Then - a sudden flutter beneath her ribs.

The baby kicked in protest.

Ethan's palm rested precisely over the gentle swell.

A heartbeat's hesitation, then his exploration continued.

His mouth blazed a trail down her throat.

Rosy blooms appeared along her collarbone.

Vivian's head fell back in abandon.

Ethan worshipped the curves of her breasts with lips and tongue.

A soft moan escaped her parted lips.

Fingers tangled in his hair, pressing him closer.

When his mouth found her rounded abdomen, Vivian tensed.

"Don't..." Her protest emerged half-hearted.

Four months pregnant, her belly curved in gentle prominence.

The baby stilled as if sensing its mother's distraction.

Ethan seemed particularly fascinated by this new terrain.

His lips traced reverent patterns across the sensitive skin.

Glancing up, he found Vivian flushed with arousal.

"Good?" His graveled question vibrated against her skin.

Circles drawn at her waistline teased mercilessly.

Vivian squirmed beneath his ministrations.

"Faster..." She bit her lip in impatience.

Ethan's low chuckle promised retribution.

"The night is young." Deliberate words stretched between kisses.

He intended to brand this pleasure into her memory.

To ensure she knew exactly who could make her feel this way.

So next time, she'd come to him willingly.

###Chapter 662

Ethan's assault came like a tempest, leaving Vivian dizzy and disoriented.

He started with restrained rhythm before completely losing control.

"Gently..." Vivian trembled as she shielded her rounded belly.

Ethan ignored her plea, murmuring against her earlobe, "Viv, I can't hold back."

Pinned beneath him, her slender frame quivered.

The baby remained unusually still, offering no protest.

When their passion subsided, Ethan carried her to the bath.

Warm water cascaded over her skin as exhaustion claimed her limbs.

His palm lingered on her abdomen where their child grew.

"Don't." She slapped his hand away.

Mistaking her resistance for shyness, Ethan chuckled while drying her.

As he laid her in bed, his body suddenly stiffened.

"Did..." He stared at her belly. "Was that a kick?"

Vivian's heart skipped. She kicked at him. "Serves you right!"

Ethan caught her ankle effortlessly. "I'm staying tonight."

When his hand returned to her stomach, she couldn't evade it.

"Ethan!" She feigned anger.

Seeing through her act, he pulled her close. "Sleep."

Exhaustion overwhelmed her, and she drifted off in his arms.

Ethan watched her peaceful expression, tenderness filling his gaze.

Despite numerous rivals coveting her, only he could hold her like this.

This knowledge satisfied him completely.
###Chapter 663

Every muscle in her body ached as if she'd been run over by a truck.

Ethan Roscente had learned techniques from somewhere that kept Vivian Laurent floating on clouds even in her sleep.

She woke first at dawn's early light.

Ethan's arm remained locked around her waist with a grip so tight she couldn't move.

The moment clarity returned, Vivian's expression darkened.

Last night's wanton version of herself had been utterly disgraceful.

She tried to wriggle free but was pulled closer.

"Ethan Roscente!"

She pinched the man's cheek hard.

Frowning in his sleep, he caught her hand and kissed it.

"What's wrong, darling?"

His gravelly voice dripped with satisfaction.

Heat rushed to Vivian's ears.

This man was pure temptation.

"Get out!"

Ethan checked his phone—6:10 AM.

"Sleep longer." He tightened his hold. "We didn't rest until past three."

Vivian punched his chest. "Leave now! What if someone sees you here?"

"Let them." He dragged her closer. "They'll find out eventually."

"Are you leaving or not?" Her voice turned icy. "If not, don't ever come back."

Ethan suddenly propped himself up. "Does that mean I can return tonight?"

"In your dreams!"

"But you enjoyed every second." His voice dropped. "Last night, who was the one begging—"

"Shut up!" She kicked him, cheeks burning. "Your skills were pathetic. Any random guy would've done better."

Ethan's eyes darkened instantly.

No man could tolerate that challenge.

"Pathetic?" He pinned her beneath him. "Then who clung to me all night?"

Trapped under his weight, Vivian's breathing hitched.

Morning light outlined his sharp features inches from hers.
###Chapter 664 

Vivian Laurent shoved against Ethan Roscente's chest with all her strength.

"Get off me!"

Ethan remained immovable, tightening his grip on her wrists instead.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, illuminating the taut muscles of his torso.

Vivian could feel his body's unmistakable response against her.

"Vivi..."

Ethan's voice was rough with sleep and something darker.

He captured her lips in a kiss that contrasted sharply with last night's urgency - slow, deliberate, intoxicating.

Her breathing hitched.

The sash of her robe had come undone, revealing pale skin that glowed in the dawn light.

Ethan's hands traced the curve of her waist, eliciting shivers.

"You're impossible..."

Her protest came out as a breathless whisper.

Ethan chuckled, fingertips brushing the sensitive spot behind her ear.

"Who was the one begging for more last night?"

Vivian glared, but he took advantage of her parted lips to deepen the kiss.

Their bodies pressed together, heat building between them.

Suddenly Ethan stilled, leaving her trembling with need.

"Say please."

She bit her lower lip, cheeks flushing.

"Never!"

He trailed featherlight kisses along her neck, each touch making her arch closer.

"Then we'll stay like this all morning."

Vivian finally snapped, kicking at him in frustration.

"Hurry up!"

Ethan's eyes darkened as he flipped her onto her stomach.

"Your words, darling."

The sudden thrust drew a startled cry from her lips.

She muffled herself against the pillow, terrified of being overheard.

Ethan only increased his pace deliberately.

"Quieter..."

Her plea ended in a whimper.

A knock at the door froze her mid-moan.

"Vivi? Are you there?"

Emily Garnache's voice made Vivian stiffen in panic.

She shoved backward at Ethan.

"Stop...someone's..."

He ignored her, moving with renewed intensity.

"Ethan!"

Tears pricked her eyes.

He bent to whisper against her ear.

"Let her hear."

Then louder, for the door's benefit:

"She's not going anywhere today."

Vivian sank her teeth into his shoulder in retaliation.

Emily's retreating footsteps faded down the hall.

The room filled with nothing but their ragged breathing.

Ethan pulled her closer.

"No more interruptions."

Words failed her as sensation overtook thought once more.

Sweat glistened along Ethan's back as he gazed down at her flushed face.

"Mine."

Any protest was swallowed by his kiss.

In the golden morning light, their bodies moved as one again.
###Chapter 665

Zero spotted Vivian's absence from a distance and strode over. "Why isn't Vivian joining us for breakfast?"

Emily stirred her coffee. "She's not feeling well. Ethan's taking care of her."

"Not feeling well?" Zero's brow furrowed as he rapped on the door. "Vivian, I heard you're unwell?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. This man called Zero always appeared at the worst possible moments to interrupt them.

Suppressing his irritation, he turned to the woman in his arms. "Tell him to get lost."

"You're the one who should leave!" Vivian bit her lip in frustration.

Ethan pressed his hips against her teasingly. "If I go, who'll take care of you?"

"I don't need you!"

His long fingers traced circles on her waist. "Really?"

"Ah!" Vivian gasped. "Ethan Roscente!"

Zero knocked again outside. "Vivian, should I call a doctor?"

She hastily grabbed Ethan's wandering hands. "I'm fine. No need for a doctor."

"Let me check on you?" Zero persisted.

"Really, it's nothing. Ethan's here." Her voice trembled slightly.

At the mention of that name, Zero's expression turned stormy. He detested Ethan Roscente more than anything.

Alone together in a room? Nothing good could come of that. With a cold laugh, Zero turned and left.

Emily took the hint and departed as well.

The interruption killed Vivian's mood completely. She shoved at the man atop her. "Get off!"

Hearing genuine anger in her voice, Ethan reluctantly rose. But instead of leaving, he swept her into a bridal carry. "Let's get you cleaned up first."

The bathroom door slammed shut. Vivian glared at her reflection—her skin covered in love bites. How was she supposed to wear swimwear now?

This was supposed to be a relaxing hot spring getaway, but Ethan had ruined everything.

When she finally emerged, freshly showered, Ethan still lounged in the room. A breakfast tray had appeared on the table.

"Come eat." He crooked a finger.

"Why are you still here?"

"I'll leave after you eat."

Vivian scoffed. "That's what you said last night too."

And what happened? She'd gotten her yogurt—and lost herself in the process.

"Ethan Roscente!" She ground her teeth.

The man smiled indulgently. "Right here."

He'd long since learned Vivian's temperament. With enough shameless persistence, he could always stay by her side.
###Chapter 666

Vivian Laurent spent three days at the Alpine Resort without even stepping into the hot springs once.

Emily Garnache and Fiona Grandelle had the time of their lives, posting daily updates on social media.

Isabella Langley pushed open the door to find Vivian curled up on the sofa, lost in thought. Her cheeks were flushed, her gaze distant.

"Looks like Ethan Roscente took good care of you?" Isabella smirked knowingly.

"Shut up!" Vivian grabbed a throw pillow and hurled it at her.

Isabella caught it effortlessly. "Look at you—like a well-fed cat. Seems like the CEO's skills suit your taste?"

Vivian turned away. "It was just mutual convenience."

"And this?" Isabella's eyes dropped to the slight swell of Vivian's abdomen.

Vivian instinctively covered her stomach. "I'll be leaving the country in two months. By then—"

"By then, Ethan will tear the world apart looking for you," Isabella cut in. "Just like three years ago."

The room fell silent.

Vivian clenched the fabric of her shirt. Three years ago, she'd vanished without a trace—not even her organization could find her.

"Viv," Isabella leaned closer suddenly. "You don’t actually want to run, do you?"

Vivian's lashes trembled faintly.

"You can’t let him go." Isabella struck true. "You're in love with Ethan Roscente."

The words sliced through Vivian's carefully constructed façade like a blade.

On the drive back, Liam Valdemar had already slipped away without a word. Vivian stared blankly at the passing scenery, her chest hollow.

At the hospital, Fiona became the most popular visitor. She brought exquisite pastries for the staff daily, though her eyes always trailed after Ryan Fairsprene.

"Does Dr. Fairsprene hate me?" Fiona slumped over Vivian's desk, golden hair spilling across the surface.

Vivian didn’t look up from her chart. "If he hated you, you’d have been kicked out by now."

"But he keeps avoiding me..." Fiona pouted.

Vivian finally set down her pen. The girl’s feelings were painfully transparent.

"Are you sure you’re just here to keep me company?" Vivian arched a brow.

Fiona’s face burned crimson.

"I—I didn’t—"

"Then why care about his attitude?" Vivian delivered the killing blow. "Fiona, you’re lying to yourself."

The blonde opened her mouth, but no rebuttal came.
###Chapter 667

Sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, casting golden streaks across the room. Fiona Grandelle curled up on the sofa, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress.

"If you like him, just tell him openly." Vivian Laurent's voice echoed in her ears.

Fiona bit her lower lip, her gaze flickering uncertainly. Despite growing up in royalty, she had always been introverted.

"I'm afraid... afraid of ruining our friendship," she murmured softly. "He doesn't seem interested in me that way."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Want me to test the waters for you?"

"How?"

"Don't come to the hospital tomorrow. I'll tell him you're sick," Vivian said with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Let's see how he reacts."

Fiona's lashes fluttered as she nodded in agreement.

The next day, in the hospital corridor, nurses gathered around Ryan Fairsprene, teasing him.

"Dr. Fairsprene, where's your little girlfriend today?"

"She's such a sweetheart. The place feels dull without her."

Ryan's ears turned slightly pink. "Don't say nonsense. She's royalty."

He turned to Vivian. "Dr. Laurent, is Fiona...?"

"She's ill," Vivian sighed. "All alone at home without even a warm meal."

Ryan's fingers clenched abruptly.

Vivian discreetly texted Fiona: "He's worried."

Fiona stared at her phone screen, her heartbeat quickening. But then she reconsidered—maybe it was just his kind nature.

The next morning, Ryan stopped Vivian as she entered the hospital.

"Is she... feeling better?"

Vivian smirked. "If you're so concerned, why not visit her yourself?"

Ryan stood frozen, his hands beneath his lab coat tightening and then relaxing.
###Chapter 668 

Vivian Laurent closed the medical chart in her hands and looked up at Ryan Fairsprene. "Fiona doesn't have many friends in Canada. You should check on her."

After work, Ryan made a detour to a florist and picked a bouquet of white baby's breath.

When Fiona Grandelle opened the door, her eyes instantly brightened. "Dr. Fairsprene?"

"I heard you were sick." Ryan handed her the flowers. "Feeling better?"

Fiona accepted the bouquet, her cheeks turning pink. "It's nothing serious. Dr. Laurent already examined me."

Ryan nodded. "Good. Since you're fine, I should—"

"Wait!" Fiona blurted out. "Have you eaten dinner?"

Ryan glanced at his watch. "Not yet."

"Then... would you like to join me?" She tightened her grip on the flower wrapping. "Dr. Laurent has surgery tonight."

The faint aroma of rice wafted from the kitchen.

Ryan rolled up his shirt sleeves. "Let me cook. Patients should eat something light."

"You can cook?" Fiona's eyes widened in surprise.

"Learned during my studies abroad." He deftly tied an apron. "Any ingredients in the fridge?"

Fiona followed closely behind him. "Dr. Fairsprene..."

"Yes?"

"Can I ask you something?" Her voice was barely audible.

Ryan paused while washing vegetables. "Go ahead."

"Do you... have a girlfriend now?"

The running water stopped abruptly.

"No." He turned off the tap and met Fiona's hopeful gaze.

"Then... is there someone you like?"

Ryan picked up a kitchen knife that gleamed coldly under the lights. "No one."

Fiona's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her shirt.

She suddenly remembered their first meeting—her face covered in scars. Ryan had been just as polite and distant then.

"Let me help with the chopping," she murmured.

When Ryan handed her the knife, their fingers brushed briefly. Fiona jerked her hand back as if burned, and the knife clattered onto the cutting board.

"Sorry!" She scrambled to pick it up, but Ryan stopped her.

"Careful with your hands."

Fiona looked up into his gentle eyes behind the glasses. The words she'd been rehearsing swirled on her tongue before she swallowed them back down.
###Chapter 669 

Vivian Laurent deliberately took several extra turns around the garden, giving Fiona Grandelle ample alone time.

When she returned to the living room, she found Fiona curled up in the corner of the sofa, clutching her phone.

"Did the conversation with Dr. Fairsprene not go well?" Vivian sat beside her.

Fiona shook her head and buried her face in a throw pillow.

"Did you confess? Did he reject you?" Vivian probed gently.

"No..." Fiona's voice was muffled. "I couldn't even muster the courage to say anything."

Vivian sighed softly. She'd noticed Ryan Fairsprene's reservations at the hospital, but hadn't expected Fiona to be too afraid to try.

"How can you be sure he doesn't like you?"

"He said he doesn't have feelings for anyone." Fiona lifted her head, eyes red-rimmed. "And...he's seen me at my worst."

She bit her lip. "This face was surgically altered. What if he thinks...it's fake?"

Vivian was momentarily speechless. She hadn't anticipated Fiona's insecurities running so deep.

"These are just your assumptions." Vivian took her hand. "Why not give him a chance to share his true feelings?"

Fiona twisted her fingers together. "If he rejects me...we won't even be friends anymore."

"What about texting him?" Vivian suggested. "It's less pressure than face-to-face."

After a long hesitation, Fiona finally dialed his number.

"Hello?" Ryan's voice came through the receiver.

"It's me..." Fiona's voice trembled.

"I know." His tone remained gentle. "Is everything alright?"

Fiona dug her nails into her palm. The words "I like you" stuck in her throat, impossible to voice.

"I...just wanted to make sure you got home safely."

"I did. Thank you for checking."

The call ended abruptly. Fiona tossed her phone onto the couch, her eyes growing redder.

"It's okay." Vivian patted her shoulder. "These things take time."

Fiona nodded weakly before heading upstairs. Her slender frame looked as fragile as a falling leaf.

In the bathroom mirror, she studied her delicate features. This expensive face couldn't buy her courage.

She remembered Ryan's gaze—warm yet distant. Perhaps to him, she'd always remain that ugly duckling hiding in the shadows.

Tears splashed against the sink. She wiped them away, but couldn't erase the insecurity rooted in her heart.
###Chapter 670

Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Vivian Laurent opened her eyes to find Fiona Grandelle seated at the vanity.

The face reflected in the mirror was familiar, but the eyes held an unsettling strangeness.

Those eyes brimmed with mockery and sharp edges.

"Killer," Vivian blurted out.

Killer turned, lips curling in amusement. "Good memory."

The voice was the same, yet carried an entirely different aura.

Every syllable cut like a blade.

"Fiona, she..." Vivian trailed off.

This was Fiona's alternate personality.

Whenever the primary persona became overwhelmed, Killer emerged with ruthless dominance.

Vivian had assumed Fiona's dual identity would vanish once her scars healed.

"That coward?" Killer scoffed. "Cries over a confession like trash."

"Don't talk about her like that." Vivian clenched the bedsheet.

Killer rose, looking down at her. "I'm seeing that doctor today."

"Ryan Fairsprene will notice," Vivian warned.

Killer narrowed her eyes. "Cover for me."

When Vivian hesitated, Killer leaned in closer. "If I don't return, this body becomes mine."

The words sent a chill through Vivian.

She understood the implication.

"Fine." Vivian finally relented. "But no reckless moves."

In the hospital corridor, nurses greeted them warmly.

"Dr. Fairsprene, your girlfriend's here!"

Before Ryan could explain, Killer cut in with challenge lacing her voice.

"Aren't you going to pour your girlfriend some water, Dr. Fairsprene?"
###Chapter 671

Ryan Fairsprene stared at Fiona Grandelle's face in a daze.

Though they'd just had dinner together last night, she seemed like a completely different person now.

Vivian Laurent stood silently nearby.

She thought to herself that only Killer could pull this off. With Fiona's timid personality, she'd never have the courage to say such things even in ten years.

Ryan poured a glass of warm water and handed it over.

"They were just joking. Don't take it seriously."

Killer accepted the glass but didn't drink.

"Does this bother you?" She looked straight into Ryan's eyes. "I'm serious."

The tips of Ryan's ears turned slightly red.

"Dr. Laurent must be busy with patients. I should go help." He turned to leave.

Killer grabbed the back collar of his lab coat.

"Come with me."

She dragged him into the fire escape.

In the cramped space, Ryan's back pressed against the wall.

"Do you like me?" Killer cut straight to the chase.

Ryan's Adam's apple bobbed. "I..."

"Two options." Killer interrupted. "Either willingly become my boyfriend, or I'll force you to agree."

Ryan's eyes widened.

"Fiona, you—"

"Think I'm not good enough?" Killer took a step closer. "Or do you still care about how I used to look?"

"No!" Ryan denied hastily.

"Then you don't dislike me." Killer concluded. "It's settled."

Ryan didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Killer suddenly lifted his chin with her fingers.

"Don't misunderstand. This isn't a request." She narrowed her eyes. "No one escapes once I've set my sights on them."

Ryan's breath hitched.

The domineering aura before him was worlds apart from the gentle Fiona in his memories.

"This is too sudden..." he managed to say.

"Reason?" Killer frowned impatiently.

She had no patience for mind games.

"You're too young to distinguish admiration from real—" Ryan tried to reason.

Killer abruptly cut in: "Do you like Vivian?"

Ryan broke into violent coughing.

He had indeed once harbored feelings for Dr. Laurent.

That decisive woman had been like a beam of light illuminating the entire ER.

But Ethan Roscente's presence made him acutely aware of the gap between them.

"Absolutely not!" Ryan denied vehemently.

Killer studied his flushed face and suddenly smiled.
###Chapter 672

Ryan Fairsprene frowned deeply. "There's nothing between Vivian and me."

"Oh?" Fiona Grandelle tilted her head. "I was just making conversation. Why are you so defensive? I simply want to know—did you reject me because you genuinely don't like me, or is there another reason?"

"Fiona, you deserve better." Ryan's tone was sincere. "What you feel for me might just be gratitude. When you meet someone you truly love, you'll understand."

Killer suddenly interjected. "I hope it's just gratitude too."

"What do you mean?" Ryan looked confused.

Killer shrugged. "Exactly what I said. Just letting you know I'm not a bad option either. Think it over carefully. If you change your mind, we can start dating."

She patted Ryan's shoulder before walking toward Vivian's office.

Ryan stood frozen, sensing something off about Fiona's behavior today.

As expected, Killer pushed open Vivian's office door without knocking. When Vivian finally finished her work, Ryan approached immediately. "Dr. Laurent, Fiona has been acting strangely today—"

"Strange?" Vivian didn't look up. "Seems normal to me. Probably just her condition acting up."

Though Vivian covered for her, Ryan couldn't shake his unease. Those ambiguous remarks had left him unsettled.

Vivian suddenly lifted her gaze. "But Fiona does like you a lot, Dr. Fairsprene. Don't miss your chance."

She returned to her paperwork without another word.

Ryan studied Vivian with mixed emotions. So she'd known all along?

When Vivian returned to her office later, she found Killer asleep at the desk. The peaceful expression was a stark contrast to her usual demeanor. Vivian quietly closed the door.

Soon after, Fiona stirred awake drowsily. "Vivian...? Why am I at the hospital? I remember falling asleep at home..."

Vivian recognized the return of the host personality. "You came with me this morning. Said you were tired and took a nap here."

"Really?" Rubbing her eyes, Fiona had no memory of it.

"Mm. Sleep more if you're still tired." Vivian handed her a glass of water.

Fiona shook her head. "No, I'm fine. Just needed some rest."

At lunch, Vivian intentionally invited Ryan. But the moment he saw Fiona, he excused himself. "I have rounds to do. You two go ahead."

Fiona's face fell. "Does Dr. Fairsprene dislike me?"

She remained oblivious to Killer's earlier confession. Vivian quickly reassured her. "Doctors are always busy. Don't overthink it."
###Chapter 673
Fiona's Farewell

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Fiona Grandelle finished packing her suitcase.

"I booked a flight for this afternoon, Vivian."

Vivian Laurent nearly dropped her coffee cup. "So suddenly? Is this because of Dr. Fairsprene?"

Fiona twisted the hem of her dress absently. "Mother hasn't been well. I should check on her."

Vivian noted the girl's red-rimmed eyes but said nothing. Some wounds couldn't be healed with words.

"Does Emily know?"

"I'll tell her now."

Emily Garnache reacted more intensely than expected. She clung to Fiona like a lost kitten.

"I'll visit again soon," Fiona promised, patting her back. "With Eudoran chocolates."

At the airport departure hall, Vivian stared blankly at the boarding gates. Would Killer disappear forever? The thought unsettled her.

Ryan Fairsprene passed Vivian's office for the third time that morning.

"Something you need, Dr. Fairsprene?" Vivian finally called out.

He adjusted his glasses. "Has Miss Grandelle been in recently?"

"She returned to Eudora." Vivian noticed his fingers stiffen.

"When?"

"The day after your conversation."

Ryan's Adam's apple bobbed. Had he been too harsh? Was that crybaby secretly wiping tears on the plane right now?

He remembered Fiona's sparkling eyes, her clumsy attempts with chopsticks. But better men would replace these memories—she deserved better.

"Probably for the best," he said tonelessly.

Vivian studied him. "Does it really not bother you at all?"

Ryan turned toward the wards, his lab coat flaring behind him. Some distances were never meant to be crossed.
###Chapter 674

Ryan Fairsprene gave a bitter smile. "Does it matter if I'm willing or not? Dr. Laurent, I'm just an ordinary man."

"She's like a star in the sky—once dimmed by dust, now shining bright again."

"While I can only stand on the ground, gazing up at her across an entire galaxy."

Vivian Laurent frowned. "I understand what you mean, but not entirely."

"Why make things so complicated?"

"How would you know it's impossible without trying? Everyone has the right to pursue happiness."

"Even Fiona Grandelle was brave enough. Are you saying you lack the courage to even try?"

Ryan lowered his head, his fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of his coffee cup.

"Isn't it even more foolish to chase something with no hope of success?"

"It might only hurt her more in the end."

Vivian took a sip of tea. "What about me and Ethan Roscente?"

"Weren't we worlds apart too?"

"Back then, I was overweight, plain, with no degree, no job, and an average family background."

"Yet I still won him over."

Ryan looked up. "But you two still ended up divorced."

"Because he never loved me." Vivian set down her cup. "At least I tried. I have no regrets."

She patted Ryan's shoulder. "Don't make decisions you'll regret."

After a long silence, Ryan finally nodded. "Thank you, Dr. Laurent."

......

The days that followed were eerily calm.

Ethan appeared frequently at the hospital, while Bianca Semona seemed to have vanished into thin air.

The unnatural quiet unsettled Vivian.

She couldn't shake the feeling that this was the calm before the storm.

With her prenatal checkup approaching, Vivian enlisted Lucas Lefèvre's help.

"You must keep Ethan occupied. He can't find out I'm going to the hospital."

Lucas thumped his chest confidently. "Leave it to me."

He arranged to meet Ethan for coffee.

The two men sat across from each other, the atmosphere thick with awkwardness.

Ethan raised a brow. "Did Vivian send you?"

Lucas forced a laugh. "Just wanted to talk you out of bothering my sister."

"If that's all, save your breath." Ethan lifted his coffee cup.

Exactly what Lucas wanted.

Silence stretched between them as they stared at each other.

The café's background music suddenly seemed unbearably loud.
###Chapter 675

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes as tension thickened the air.

"Cat got your tongue?" He drummed his fingers on the table while staring at Lucas Lefèvre.

Lucas shrugged. "You told me to shut up."

Ethan's fingers froze mid-tap.

"So you came here just to spout nonsense?"

"This isn't nonsense." Lucas's gaze turned sharp. "Vivian's doing fine now. Stay away from her."

A dangerous glint flashed in Ethan's eyes as he chuckled darkly.

"How do you know I can't help her?" His voice dropped to a whisper. "I can give her pleasures no one else can."

Especially when Vivian lay beneath him in the dead of night.

"Stop deluding yourself!" Lucas slammed the table. "She was miserable with you! And you dare chase her when you already have a child? Disgusting!"

"I've explained about the child." Ethan's tone turned icy. "You claim to care for her? Then let her make her own choices."

Lucas clenched his fists. "Of course I want Vivian happy. But never with you!"

"Why not?" Ethan suddenly closed the distance between them. "What exactly is your relationship with Vivian?"

"None of your business." Lucas stood his ground. "But hurt her, and I'll make you pay with your life."

To him, Vivian was like a blood sister.

Ethan paused, his voice softening unexpectedly. "I'd sooner worship her than harm her. We both want her happiness. Your concern should be directed at that Liam Valdemar."

"Badmouthing people behind their backs? How low."

"Consider it friendly advice." Ethan's eyes turned razor-sharp. "People change. That Liam appeared out of nowhere—who knows his true motives?"

Lucas frowned.

"Vivian's too trusting." Ethan pressed on. "You know Liam's background better than I do. A Dark Web fugitive like him doesn't get captured easily."

Lucas fell silent. The wanted criminal's reputation was indeed concerning.

"I'll keep an eye out." He finally conceded. "But don't mistake this for approval. Caring for Vivian won't earn you my acceptance."

Ethan smirked, his coat swirling dramatically as he turned.

"We'll see about that."
###Chapter 676

Ethan Roscente set down his coffee cup with an indifferent gaze. "Your approval means nothing to me."

His eyes swept over Lucas Lefèvre's tense expression before curving into a faint smirk. "Though having you protect Vivian Laurent has saved me some trouble."

Lucas clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

He had to admit—this man had indeed helped Vivian in countless ways.

As the coffee cup emptied, Ethan straightened his suit sleeves and rose. "If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."

A glance at his watch told him Vivian's medical examination would conclude in thirty minutes.

"Wait!" Lucas abruptly stood.

Ethan arched a brow. "Something else?"

"The final payment for Triple Six Realty..." Lucas spoke rapidly. "Vivian said it'll be settled next week."

"Unnecessary." Ethan waved a dismissive hand. "Consider it an investment."

Lucas stubbornly shook his head. "She hates owing favors."

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. "Let her have her way."

Just as he turned to leave, Lucas blocked him again. "Those old shareholders from Valrose Group have been causing trouble lately."

"Noted." Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "They'll be gone by tomorrow."

Time ticked by.

Finally, Lucas' phone vibrated with Vivian's message: 【Done】.

He exhaled in relief. "All clear."

Ethan studied his odd behavior before striding out of the café with a thoughtful frown.

Hospital parking lot.

Vivian Laurent pulled open her car door, fingers trembling slightly.

Only after triple-checking that the medical report was securely locked in her bag did she start the engine.

Around the corner, Felix Valdemar narrowed his eyes.

He pulled out his phone: 【Boss Ethan, Dr. Laurent was at Renhe Hospital】

Ethan stared at the screen, pupils constricting.

Renhe Hospital?

The same facility where he'd had his last gastroscopy.

He immediately called back. "You're certain it was Vivian?"

"Positive." Felix kept his voice low. "She just drove off."

Ethan's grip on the phone turned bone-white.

So that was it.

Lucas' stalling tactics. Vivian's suspicious movements.

Every clue converged into one glaring truth—she was hiding something.

Dark turbulence swirled in Ethan's eyes as he stormed toward the parking garage.

The black sports car roared to life, shooting forward like an arrow released from its bow.

This time, he would uncover her secret—no matter what.
###Chapter 677

Ethan Roscente stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his knuckles turning white.

Lucas Lefèvre's sudden invitation was too deliberate.

He knew Vivian Laurent too well. The more she tried to conceal something, the more suspicious it became.

The hospital. Again.

This was the third time this month.

His fingers tapped absently against the glass. Stomach cancer? Leukemia? Or—

His fist clenched abruptly.

"Uncle!" Theo bounded into the room, bouncing with energy. "When are we going to see Auntie?"

Ethan crouched down and pinched his nephew's chubby cheeks. "Right now."

The doorbell rang just as Vivian was reviewing her test results.

She hastily shoved the papers into a drawer.

"Auntie!" Theo launched himself into her arms.

Vivian lifted the child, but her gaze collided with Ethan's probing stare.

"What brings you here?" She averted her eyes.

Ethan studied the faint blush on the tips of her ears. "Just passing by."

During dinner, his chopsticks reached for the dish in front of her for the third time.

"Lately, you've been—"

"Theo, do you want shrimp?" Vivian abruptly cut him off.

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

The tenth episode of the cartoon played in the background.

Theo's head bobbed sleepily before finally lolling against Vivian's shoulder.

"He's asleep," she murmured.

Ethan leisurely closed his laptop. "It's too late to move him now. He might catch a chill."

Vivian watched his composed movements before suddenly laughing. "Since when did Mr. Roscente become a babysitter?"

"Since someone started lying."

Their eyes locked.

The edge of a test result peeked out from the drawer, two blurred words visible: "Pregnancy."
###Chapter 678

"Sleep with him in your arms," Vivian said coldly.

Ethan looked down at the sleeping Theo in his embrace, a faint smile playing on his lips. "I can't. He's a light sleeper and wakes at the slightest movement."

"Then leave him here and get out." Vivian saw right through his ploy.

The man was clearly using Theo as an excuse to stay. Ever since that absurd night at the hot spring resort, he'd become increasingly bold.

"Theo can't sleep without me." Ethan remained unfazed. "If he wakes up and doesn't see me, he'll cry all day."

Vivian arched an eyebrow.

This man would even make up stories about his own son just to stay.

"Why don't we both stay?" Ethan coaxed. "Theo would be so happy to see you in the morning."

He emphasized "Theo" while his gaze remained fixed on Vivian.

"Dream on!" she snapped.

Letting this wolf through her door? She wasn't that foolish.

Ethan sighed dramatically. "Then I'll have to wake Theo and leave with him."

"Don't you dare!" Vivian glared.

Theo slept peacefully, his rosy cheeks too precious to disturb.

"We stay together or leave together." Ethan resorted to shameless tactics.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "Have you no shame?"

The man being scolded only smiled wider.

"For Theo, it's worth it."

Too tired to argue, Vivian relented. "Sleep downstairs. Don't come up. You're responsible for Theo."

She gently tucked the blanket around the sleeping child, her expression softening. She hoped the baby in her womb would be just as adorable.

As she ascended the stairs, she felt the heat of a gaze burning into her back.

Ethan watched her retreating figure with narrowed eyes. Vivian seemed perfectly normal—so why had she gone to the hospital?

He searched the living room thoroughly but found no medication.

Very strange.

The sound of running water upstairs ceased.

Ethan crept up silently. Vivian's door was firmly locked.

"Vivi?" He knocked.

"What?" came the wary reply.

"We need to talk."

"Say it!"

Ethan swallowed hard, imagining her fresh from the shower. "Face to face."

"Go back downstairs!" Vivian tightened her robe. "We'll talk tomorrow."

A sudden wave of fatigue hit her—probably another pregnancy symptom.

"Fine." Ethan knew when to retreat.

Staying the night was victory enough. He wouldn't push his luck.
###Chapter 679

The hallway was deathly silent.

Ethan Roscente's towering figure remained motionless outside the door.

Vivian Laurent pressed her ear against the wood, listening intently.

Not even the sound of breathing reached her ears.

She exhaled in quiet relief.

Had he finally left?

Her slender fingers curled around the doorknob.

The moment the door swung open, their eyes locked.

"You're still here!" Vivian gasped.

Surprise flickered in Ethan's dark gaze.

He'd only intended to linger outside a moment longer.

The sudden opening caught him off guard.

There she stood, fresh from her shower.

Damp hair was loosely pinned up.

Tendrils escaped to caress her delicate neck.

Her bare face glowed with lingering steam.

The robe's collar gaped slightly.

Revealing the elegant dip of her collarbones.

Ethan's throat moved visibly.

In one swift motion, he advanced.

"Get out!" Vivian scrambled to shut the door.

His hand snapped around her wrist.

Scorching heat enveloped her instantly.

Her back met the cool wall.

Then his mouth claimed hers.

Her struggles gradually weakened.

This kiss was too familiar.

Ethan always knew exactly how to unravel her.

Reason screamed for her to push him away.

Yet her arms wound around his shoulders of their own accord.

As their tongues tangled,

Vivian found the perfect excuse.

Just pregnancy hormones.

She needed her baby's father.

That was all.

But when Ethan swept her into his arms,

The lie crumbled to dust.

The mattress dipped beneath them.

His lips traced every inch of exposed skin.

"Don't..." She squirmed.

His large hand captured her ankle.

Ethan pressed a reverent kiss to her toes.

"They're dirty..." She tried to pull away, flushing.

He held firm.

His mouth blazed a trail up her calf.

Igniting wildfires in its wake.

Vivian bit her lip.

A whimper escaped regardless.

"Ethan..."

Her voice trembled.

He stilled abruptly.

"Vivian." His voice was gravel.

"Give me one more chance."

Fingers brushed her heated cheek.

"I swear you're the only one I'll ever love."

Her hazy gaze met his.

Reason and desire waged war within her.
###Chapter 680

Vivian shoved Ethan away violently.

She had no intention of being tied to this man.

To her, Ethan was nothing more than a convenient tool.

"Why refuse me?"

Ethan's intense gaze locked onto her eyes.

He could sense the hesitation in Vivian.

"No reason."

She turned her face away.

When she tried to pull her wrist free, his grip only tightened.

"I'd do anything for you."

His voice was deep and husky.

"But not commitment."

Vivian's tone left no room for argument.

Ethan knew better than to push.

He leaned in to kiss her, but she dodged him.

"Disgusting!"

Her nose wrinkled in distaste.

"Even your own?"

A low chuckle escaped him.

"Want a taste?"

"Get lost!"

She kicked at him before rolling over and cocooning herself in the blankets.

Ethan gently tucked the covers around her.

His lips brushed her forehead in a featherlight kiss.

Pausing by Theo's room on his way downstairs, he glanced at the sleeping boy.

Excitement kept him awake all night.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Vivian stirred.

The other side of the bed lay empty.

She winced as she touched her aching lower back.

"Bastard..."

After freshening up, she found Theo already seated at the dining table.

"Morning, Aunt Viv!"

The cheerful greeting made her give up correcting the title.

"Where's your uncle?"

She asked absently while pouring juice.

"That irresponsible—"

Before she could finish, Ethan emerged from the kitchen carrying breakfast.

"I'm always ready to take responsibility."

The smirk playing on his lips spoke volumes.

Vivian's retort died in her throat.

She'd meant looking after Theo.

Where had this man's mind wandered?
###Chapter 681

Vivian Laurent couldn't even bother to glance at him.

Ethan Roscente had already set breakfast on the table.

"Theo, wash your hands before eating."

The little boy scampered off to the bathroom. Vivian eyed the spread—plain congee, pickled vegetables, and a fried egg.

"Such a pitiful takeout order?" She pulled Theo into his seat.

"Uncle Ethan made it!" Theo blurted out.

"You?" Vivian arched a skeptical brow.

The CEO of Roscente Group cooking? Who'd believe that? The memory of him nearly blowing up the kitchen last time was still fresh.

Ethan nodded. "First attempt. Bear with it. I'll learn more dishes."

He remembered every detail of how she'd cared for him during his leg injury. Now it was his turn.

He'd risen before dawn, painstakingly following online tutorials. Though the egg edges were charred and the pickles under-seasoned, it was edible.

Something stirred in Vivian's chest.

The ruthless business tycoon had rolled up his sleeves to cook for her.

She lowered her head over the congee, avoiding his intense gaze. "We'll see."

Surprisingly, the light meal suited her palate. With her recent morning sickness, she managed half a bowl—a small victory.

Ethan efficiently cleared the dishes.

"CEO Roscente has so much free time? No company to run?" Vivian watched his busy silhouette.

"Simon's handling it." His tone was casual.

In truth, he worked through paperwork after she fell asleep.

"Maybe let me play CEO for a day?" She teased.

"Done." He dried his hands. "But how about the position of CEO's wife, Ms. Laurent?"

"Pass."

"Then I'll be the CEO's husband?"

"In your dreams!" She rolled her eyes.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains. Since her pregnancy, she'd been lethargic, planning to rest at home today.

Her phone rang abruptly. Fiona Grandelle's tearful voice crackled through. "Vivian... my mother..."

"Slow down. Tell me what happened."

The Queen of Eudora was six months pregnant with a full medical team. Last month's checkup showed no complications.
###Chapter 682

"Vivian, I just received Mother's prenatal report." Fiona's voice trembled noticeably. "The doctor detected fetal abnormalities and recommended terminating the pregnancy. But Mother—"

Vivian immediately set down the medical chart. "What exactly is the situation?"

Her phone vibrated twice as the test results came through. Vivian studied the screen, her frown deepening.

The fetus showed clear cranial deformities and underdeveloped limbs. Worse, all indicators suggested extremely low survival rates even if carried to term.

"How did this happen?" Vivian murmured. The previous checkup had been perfectly normal.

Advanced maternal age already carried risks, and now severe fetal complications posed threats to both the unborn child and Queen Eleanor's life.

"Fiona, this pregnancy—" Vivian took a steadying breath. "We must proceed with surgery immediately."

Muffled sobs came through the phone.

"I know Mother can't accept this." Fiona choked back tears. "Vivian, isn't there any other way?"

Suddenly, the line crackled with interference.

"Dr. Luna! Please save my baby!" Queen Eleanor's desperate voice cut through, bordering on hysteria. "You've monitored this child's growth from the beginning—you understand him best!"

Vivian tightened her grip on the phone.

"Your Majesty, I'm so sorry." Her voice remained gentle yet firm. "Continuing this pregnancy endangers you both."

"No!" The queen's scream pierced the line. "I can feel him moving! He's fighting to live!"

Heart-wrenching sobs followed.

"This child...I've waited over a decade for him." The queen's voice dropped to a shattered whisper. "Doctor, please...think of another solution."

Vivian closed her eyes.

As a physician, she understood the cruelty of this decision better than anyone. As a woman, she felt the mother's agony.

"Your Majesty, please calm yourself." Vivian softened her tone. "Let's conduct more thorough examinations first."

Only broken whimpers answered.

Vivian knew rational arguments wouldn't reach the nearly fifty-year-old queen clinging to this last hope of motherhood.

"I'll come personally." Vivian finally said. "Until then, you must preserve your strength."

Hanging up, Vivian gazed blankly at the window.

The sunset stained the clouds blood-red—like the fading life of that unborn child.
###Chapter 683

Vivian Laurent stared at the medical report, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The condition of Queen Eleanor's unborn child was far more complicated than she'd anticipated.

"Dr. Luna?" The queen's cautious voice came through the phone.

Vivian took a deep breath. "I need to reevaluate the test results."

She heard the muffled sound of the queen suppressing a sob.

"Please. You're my last hope."

Ethan Roscente approached with a coffee cup but stopped at Vivian's warning glare.

"Quiet."

She rapidly scrolled through the latest imaging report sent by Fiona Grandelle.

The fetal abnormalities were worsening.

"Your Majesty, have you been exposed to any radiation recently?"

"Absolutely not!" The queen's voice tightened. "I barely even use my phone."

Vivian's brow furrowed.

This defied standard medical progression.

Ethan slipped out of the study and dialed Simon Eisner.

"Dig up everything on the Eudoran royal family."

The aroma of frying eggs drifted from the kitchen.

But Vivian remained oblivious, completely absorbed in analyzing the data.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up.

"Your Majesty, there's hope."

The sound of shattering glass came through the phone.

"Really?"

Vivian pulled up a 3D model. "Two options."

"First is surgery at full term, but the risk factor is too high."

"And the second?" The queen's breathing quickened.

Vivian typed rapidly. "Intrauterine intervention therapy."

"We can start now?"

"It requires specialized equipment." Vivian paused. "Does Eudora Royal Hospital have it?"

The queen responded instantly, "We'll import whatever we don't have!"

Ethan stood in the doorway holding breakfast.

He saw the spark in Vivian's eyes—that exhilaration she only showed when facing a medical challenge.
###Chapter 684

"The second option is immediate intrauterine surgery to correct the fetal abnormality. This would allow the baby to develop normally afterward."

Queen Eleanor didn't hesitate. "I choose the second option!"

Vivian Laurent gently pressed her trembling hand. "Your Highness, please wait. Intrauterine surgery carries significant risks. The fetus is extremely small, and despite your excellent physical condition, your advanced maternal age multiplies the danger."

She paused. "Whether this procedure is viable depends on my full examination when I arrive in Eudora."

"I'll arrange a private jet immediately!" The Queen couldn't bear waiting another second.

Vivian checked her watch. "Tomorrow. I need to hand over several pending surgeries here first."

The Queen reluctantly agreed. As long as Vivian would come, she could wait.

The moment she hung up, Ethan Roscente appeared beside her. "Going to Eudora?"

"Yes."

"I'm coming."

Vivian frowned. "Why?"

He stated matter-of-factly. "Where my wife goes, I follow."

She rolled her eyes.

"This is a medical mission, not a honeymoon."

"I know. The Queen's fetus has complications."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Are you monitoring me?"

Ethan chuckled. "Just concerned."

"You're not an obstetrician."

"But I'll keep you safe." His gaze burned intensely. "And I should pay my respects to the King."

Vivian knew she couldn't shake him off.

"Theo wants to come too!" The little boy suddenly bounded over, eyes sparkling.

Ethan ruffled his hair. "Good. Time to visit home."

Vivian hesitated.

"Don't worry," Ethan murmured, lowering his voice. "I won't see Sophia Evans. You're the only one in my heart."

She glared. "Not in front of the child."

Kneeling down, she asked, "By the way, Theo, what's your full name?"

Theo blinked his large eyes, about to answer when Ethan interjected, "Theodore Evans."

Vivian froze.

The name... sounded like a combination of hers and Ethan's.

Ethan gave her a meaningful look. "I chose it."

Her ears burned. Quickly changing the subject, she said, "Flight's at 8 AM tomorrow. Don't be late."

"As you command, my lady." Ethan performed an exaggerated bow.

Theo giggled, copying his uncle's gesture. "As you command, Auntie!"

Vivian facepalmed.

These two were equally impossible.
###Chapter 685

Theo tilted his little face upward and said in a childish voice, "My name is Theodore Evans!"

Vivian bent down and gently tapped his nose with her fingertip. "That's a beautiful name, sweetheart."

"Auntie, I want to go to Eudora with you." The boy blinked his large, innocent eyes.

Her heart melted at the sight of his angelic face.

"Of course we'll go together."

She knew Ethan would secretly follow them anyway. Might as well bring Theo along openly.

This trip would last at least two weeks. After performing the Queen's surgery, she'd need to monitor the recovery. The whole process could take up to a month.

She immediately called Lucas and Isabella.

"You're going to Eudora? What about your prenatal checkups?" Isabella's voice was laced with concern.

"The royal medical team can handle my examinations there," Vivian reassured her.

"Is Ethan going too?" Isabella asked sharply.

"Yes."

"How does he even know about this?"

Vivian hesitated. She couldn't exactly say Ethan was standing right beside her.

"You two..." Isabella trailed off meaningfully.

"Don't even think about it!" Vivian cut in quickly. "Reconciliation is absolutely not happening!"

"I didn't say anything. You're the one overreacting." Isabella teased. "We'll handle things here. Just be careful. Don't let Ethan trick you again, and your secret—"

"Got it. Love you!"

"Save it!"

After hanging up, Vivian contacted Finn. He was overseas on a mission.

"If my assignment takes me to Eudora, I'll come find you," Finn said cheerfully.

"Focus on your mission," Vivian laughed while shaking her head.

While packing, Vivian started shooing Ethan away.

He stubbornly lingered until she told Theo, "We have an early flight tomorrow. You should get some rest tonight."

Theo immediately tugged at Ethan's sleeve. "Uncle, I need to pack my backpack!"

Ethan saw through the ploy but played along. "I'll arrange for the royal jet to pick you up tomorrow," he said before leaving.

"That's unnecessary."

"It's on the way." His tone brooked no argument. "It's settled."
###Chapter 686

The crimson wine swirled in the glass as Liam's slender fingers traced its rim.

The doorbell shattered the silence.

He rose to answer it. Annika stood outside, her face masked.

"Master Zero." Her voice was muffled.

Liam stepped aside to let her in.

She removed the mask, revealing swollen cheeks from recent cosmetic work.

"What happened to your face?" His brow furrowed.

Annika's eyes brightened. He'd noticed.

"Allergies." She lowered her head to hide her smile. "Thank you for your concern."

Liam turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"How's the organization?"

"Running smoothly." She followed him. "But the Dark Web is still hunting you. Won't you return? That Ethan Roscente—"

Her nails dug into her palms as she recalled seeing Liam wounded last time.

He stared into the ink-black night.

"Shadow shines brightly in other fields too."

Vivian Laurent was now a medical genius and design prodigy. Her empire spanned continents.

Yet this woman would never belong to him.

"Master?" Annika sensed the shift in his aura.

Liam swirled his wine glass.

"I have a mission for you."

"Name it." She straightened immediately.

"I'll design an operation to draw Shadow out."

Annika paled. "You want me to assist her?"

"No." He turned, ice glinting in his eyes. "I want you to critically injure her."

Her pupils constricted.

"Kill... kill Shadow?"

Liam chuckled. "You couldn't. Just wound her severely. I'll handle the rest."

Her pulse raced. His obsession with Shadow had warped into murderous intent.

He sipped his wine.

Direct action was too risky. If he failed, he could still maintain his facade as Vivian's closest friend.

His fingerprints had been all over that botched mission four years ago.

This time, he'd cage the nightingale for good.
###Chapter 687

Annika Heilbronn accepted the mission without hesitation. This was the opportunity she'd been dreaming of.

"Master Zero, rest assured. I won't fail." Excitement flashed in Annika's eyes.

A lingering question haunted her—had her master already targeted Vivian four years ago?

After that mission, she'd secretly investigated for months. She'd uncovered traces of Master Zero's involvement.

So much for his supposed feelings for Vivian. Annika would be content if Vivian simply disappeared.

......

The next morning, Liam Valdemar arrived early at Vivian's doorstep.

He found her just stepping out with luggage in tow.

"Shadow... I mean, Vivian." Liam called out. "Where are you going?"

The suitcase suggested a trip.

"An impromptu visit to Eudora." Vivian offered an apologetic smile. "Is it urgent? I should've told you earlier."

"No matter." Liam's gaze flickered. His carefully laid plans were unraveling.

If she stayed away too long, everything would collapse.

"When will you return?"

"Undetermined."

"Fine. I'll wait."

Just then, Ethan Roscente's car pulled up nearby. He deliberately stepped out.

"What a coincidence... Mr. Lu."

Liam used the alias "Lu Liam" publicly. Ethan emphasized it mockingly.

"Why are you here?" Liam turned to Vivian. "Is he accompanying you to Eudora?"

Before Ethan could respond, Vivian interjected, "He's just driving me to the airport."

Ethan's chest tightened. Why would Vivian downplay their relationship in front of Liam?

Did she care about this man's feelings?

Acid bitterness spread through him, but his devotion remained unshaken.

Vivian had other concerns—if Liam learned the truth, he'd insist on coming.

The resort clash still fresh in memory, she wanted no repeats.

"Driver Ethan, we're leaving." Vivian shot Ethan a warning glare.

Obediently, Ethan returned to the wheel.

With boarding time approaching, Vivian had to cut the conversation short.

"Call if anything comes up," she told Liam.

He forced a smile. "Go ahead. Stay safe."

"Goodbye!"

Vivian waved and entered the car. Theo Evans, hidden by the rear seats, remained unseen.

Through the rearview mirror, she watched Liam's retreating figure. Something felt unsaid.

Once they'd driven a distance, Ethan finally spoke.

"Calling me just a driver... afraid he'd misunderstand?"

"Misunderstand what?" Vivian looked baffled.

"Our relationship. You didn't want him knowing we're traveling together."

Vivian massaged her temples. "Since when are you this sensitive? This is a medical trip for the Queen, not a vacation. His tagging along would complicate things."

The storm clouds in Ethan's heart instantly cleared. She wasn't protecting Liam's feelings—she found him bothersome.
###Chapter 688

"What's so funny?" Vivian turned her head toward the driver's seat.

Ethan's lips kept twitching upward despite his efforts to suppress them. His fingers tapped rhythmically against the steering wheel.

"Not laughing." He feigned seriousness, tightening his jawline, but amusement still danced in his eyes.

Vivian didn't bother pressing further and returned to scrolling through her phone.

Messages from Fiona Grandelle popped up one after another, each laced with anxiety. Vivian's fingers flew across the screen: "The surgical plan is still being optimized. It's too early to discuss success rates."

"But my mother insists on keeping this baby," Fiona replied instantly. "Vivian, I'm terrified."

The "typing" indicator flickered for a long moment before a single message appeared: "I just want my mother to be safe."

That girl was always like this. Vivian pictured Fiona's doe-like eyes—always hiding her worries behind a facade of maturity.

"Get some rest. See you tomorrow." She sent the final message.

Outside the window, scenery blurred past as Vivian's eyelids grew heavy. Pregnancy had made her perpetually drowsy, even right after waking.

"We're here."

Ethan's voice reached her through the haze. She tried to respond but couldn't form words. The familiar scent of cedar enveloped her as she felt herself being lifted effortlessly.

When she opened her eyes, she was suspended midair.

"Put me down!" Vivian jolted awake, her fingers instinctively clutching Ethan's collar.

His arms didn't budge. "You were out cold." His breath brushed her ear. "The airport's crowded. This is faster."
###Chapter 689

Vivian eyed Ethan Roscente with suspicion, convinced he was lying.

Ethan seemed to read her thoughts and cleared his throat. "Ask Theo if you don't believe me."

Theo blinked his large eyes. "Uncle Ethan did call you, but it was really quiet, like a mosquito."

Vivian sighed and rubbed her temples, resigning herself to the situation.

On the other side of the airport, royal attendants waited by the private tarmac.

The three of them walked toward the jet, with Ethan holding both Vivian and Theo's hands.

The cabin was spacious and bright. Ethan handed her a blanket. "Want to rest a bit longer?"

"No." Vivian signaled the flight attendant. "An Americano, please."

She flipped open the prenatal report, her brow furrowing. The queen's surgical plan needed reevaluation.

Minimally invasive surgery was the best option. Performing open surgery on such a small fetus was too risky.

Throughout the flight, Vivian studied the surgical notes while Ethan tackled a mountain of paperwork.

Theo sat quietly beside them, engrossed in a medical atlas.

The child was exceptionally gifted—barely four years old and already grasping basic medical concepts.

By the time the plane landed, dawn was breaking over the Kingdom of Eudora.

Fiona Grandelle greeted them at the airport, surprised to see Ethan. "Will you be staying at the palace?"

There were plenty of guest rooms available.

Ethan shook his head. "I have an estate in the suburbs." He glanced at Theo, who was practically vibrating with excitement. "This one's too loud."

"Tell me about it," Vivian muttered. "The palace is no place for outsiders."

Fiona hesitated, sensing the tension between them.

"Let's go, Fiona." Vivian pulled her sister toward the car without looking back.

Ethan took Theo to the estate.

The moment they stepped out of the car, Theo looked up with hopeful eyes. "Uncle Ethan, can I see Mom?"

Ethan froze.

"It's been so long." Theo's eyes welled up. "She said she missed me last time."

Kneeling to meet the boy's gaze, Ethan hesitated. Sophia Evans was in no state for visitors.

The deranged woman had been confined for months. There was no telling what she might do.
###Chapter 690

Ethan Roscente crouched down to meet Theo Evans at eye level. "Be good, Theo. Your mother has important matters to attend to recently."

Theo tilted his head. "But Mom's always at home. What could she be doing?"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "She's... preparing for a new job."

"But Mom's face..." Theo touched his own cheek, his voice trailing off.

Ethan remained silent for a moment. "Theo, the adult world is complicated."

"I know." Theo lowered his head. "Mom did bad things. She hurt Aunt Vivian."

Suddenly he looked up, eyes shining. "But I still want to tell her I'm doing well now. Aunt Vivian treats me really nice."

Ethan's heart softened.

This child was too understanding—painfully so.

If only his elder brother were still here...

"Alright." Ethan ruffled Theo's hair. "Uncle will arrange for you to see her."

Theo cheered and threw himself into Ethan's arms.

Ethan's eyes darkened.

He would have someone take Theo to see her, but he himself would never lay eyes on that woman again.

......

Deep within the royal palace.

As Vivian Laurent stepped into the bedchamber, Queen Eleanor rose excitedly.

"Dr. Laurent!"

"Just call me Vivian." Vivian hurried forward to steady her.

The queen's eyes reddened. "You're finally here. First with Fiona's troubles, and now..."

"Fiona and I are friends." Vivian's gaze fell on the queen's swollen abdomen. "Please don't stand on ceremony."

The loose gown couldn't conceal her seven-month pregnancy.

"Could you examine me now?" The queen asked urgently. "I know you just got off the plane—"

Vivian interrupted gently. "I rested during the flight. Shall we go to the hospital?"

The queen nodded in relief.

In the hospital examination room, the ultrasound screen displayed fetal images.

Vivian studied the monitor, her frown deepening.

The situation was more complicated than she'd anticipated.
###Chapter 691

The examination lasted three full hours.

Queen Eleanor clutched the hem of her dress, her voice trembling. "Dr. Laurent, my baby...how is he?"

Vivian handed the ultrasound images to the queen, pointing at a shadowed area. "Look here."

The fetus's limbs were clearly visible, but two areas showed abnormal adhesions.

"Besides the malformation adhesions, the fetal heart rate is unstable." Vivian paused. "Even if delivered, the child would likely suffer chronic illnesses."

Tears spilled from the queen's eyes.

"Six months...he already kicks me." The queen caressed her swollen abdomen. "I can't give up on him."

"The royal family has the best medical resources. Money is no object." She grasped Vivian's wrist. "Didn't Lulu recover too?"

Vivian felt the queen's fingers shaking.

"The surgery would be extremely difficult." Vivian pointed at the image. "Separating this area requires millimeter precision."

The queen immediately offered, "I'll assemble the nation's top surgeons to assist you."

Vivian shook her head. "Your current physical condition isn't suitable for immediate surgery."

The queen's blood pressure and heart rate remained unstable.

"Wait two more days." Vivian closed the medical report. "You must remain calm."

Ethan stood at the corridor's end, his gaze fixed on Vivian.

He watched as she rubbed her temples wearily.
###Chapter 692

Vivian Laurent had just finished her examination when she looked up to see Ethan Roscente standing at the end of the hallway.

"Why are you here?" She frowned slightly.

Ethan strode toward her, the hem of his lab coat swaying with each step. "Just wanted to see you."

Vivian arched a brow. "What's so interesting about me?" She leaned in suddenly. "Or is it just my face you like?"

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"No," he said, his voice low. "I just wanted to come."

He couldn't explain this feeling. Every time he saw Vivian, his heartbeat quickened. There was something about her—an irresistible pull that held his gaze captive.

"Need some water?" Ethan changed the subject.

Vivian shook her head. "No."

"Then let me massage your shoulders." He gestured to the nearby chair. "You've been standing all morning."

She eyed him skeptically. "You know how?"

Ethan chuckled. "Try me and find out."

His long fingers settled on her shoulders, applying just the right pressure. Vivian closed her eyes, savoring the relief.

Nearby, Fiona Grandelle hugged a medical chart to her chest, watching them with envy.

She thought of Ryan Fairsprene—the man who always smiled so gently yet never spared her a second glance. Even sending him a simple text took her half a day of hesitation.

......

Queen Eleanor's surgery was scheduled for dawn the next day.

Late that night, an explosive headline swept across Eudora's internet: Queen's Fetus Diagnosed with Deformity—Suspected Supermale Syndrome.

Public outrage erupted instantly. Some demanded termination, while others hurled curses at the royal family.

The Queen fainted upon seeing the news.

When Vivian arrived at the emergency summons, she found Queen Eleanor lying in bed, tears streaming down her face. "How could my child be a monster...?"

Fiona grabbed Vivian's arm anxiously. "Dr. Laurent, who's behind this?"

Vivian's expression darkened. With the surgery imminent, the Queen's emotional breakdown drastically increased the risks.

She swiftly assessed the Queen's condition while her mind raced.

This was no coincidence. Either it was a political scheme targeting the Queen—or it was aimed at her.

If the latter... One misstep in the operating room would ruin her forever.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. Whoever was behind this wouldn't dare tamper with the surgery directly. Their only option was to break the Queen psychologically.

She gently pressed the Queen's trembling hand. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."
###Chapter 693

The heavily guarded government residence in the Kingdom of Eudora shimmered under the cold glow of crystal chandeliers.

Annika Heilbronn swirled her champagne flute absently, watching the bubbles rise.

"How's the public reaction?" she asked with feigned disinterest.

The suited man across from her bowed slightly. "The people are demanding the Queen terminate her pregnancy. Latest reports say she's fainted."

A crimson smile curved Annika's lips. "Excellent. Keep fanning the flames."

She wouldn't let Vivian Laurent complete the procedure successfully.

If the surgery failed, the Queen's wrath would fall entirely upon Vivian.

"Remember our deal." Annika set down her glass. "You eliminate that child, I eliminate your problems."

Under the ink-black sky, her silhouette vanished through the residence's back door.

Her car sped toward a secluded villa on the city outskirts.

...

Deathly silence filled the villa.

Sophia Evans huddled in a corner, her vacant eyes resembling a walking corpse.

Once a dazzling celebrity, she'd been reduced to a prisoner.

She'd lost everything: beauty, career, freedom.

Even the energy for anger had been drained away.

When the maid departed, Sophia pushed open her bedroom door—and froze.

"Who's there?"

Moonlight revealed a stranger seated at her vanity.

That face made Sophia's blood boil. "Vivian?!"

But she quickly realized her mistake.

Though this woman bore seventy percent resemblance to Vivian, her eyes gleamed like poisoned daggers.

"Relax." Annika smiled. "I'm here to help."

"Get out!" Sophia shrieked hysterically.

Unfazed, Annika produced her phone. "See how well your enemy lives now."

The screen showed Vivian Laurent arm-in-arm with Ethan Roscente, radiant smiles on their faces.

Another photo depicted Vivian with Theo Evans—a painfully wholesome family scene.
###Chapter 694

Annika slammed a stack of photos onto the table.

"Look at these." Her finger tapped the glossy surface. "Vivian Laurent now holds your son's hand, clings to the man who should've been yours, living a life everyone envies."

In the photos, Vivian played with a little boy in a garden while Ethan Roscente stood nearby, his gaze tender.

Sophia Evans dug her nails into her palms.

"Doesn't it bother you?" Annika leaned closer. "Vivian stole everything from you. Don't you want her to pay?"

Sophia violently swept the photos onto the floor.

"Shut up!"

Her scream was raw, eyes bloodshot.

Annika calmly picked up one photo. "Look at Vivian's flawless face. Now look at yours..."

The mirror reflected Sophia's scarred visage.

"What do you want?" Sophia panted like a caged animal.

"To help you." Annika suddenly pressed a gun to Sophia's temple. "If you cooperate."

Sophia laughed hysterically. "Go ahead! Kill me! I've got nothing left!"

"Death would be too kind." Annika holstered the weapon. "If you die, Vivian keeps your son and your man forever."

She whispered in Sophia's ear: "Sophia Sherwood is dead—I avenged you. Now it's Vivian's turn."

"Theo... is in Eudora?" Sophia seized the revelation.

Annika smirked. "Yes. Your son clings to Vivian now. He's forgotten his real mother."

Sophia trembled violently.

Her own flesh and blood, raised for five years, now called another woman "Mom."

"First Ethan, now Theo..." Sophia muttered, hatred igniting in her eyes.

Annika's lips curled in satisfaction. "Do one thing for me, and I'll let you destroy Vivian yourself."

"What?"

"Simple." Annika handed her a phone. "Send Ethan a message..."

Thunder rumbled outside. Lightning illuminated Sophia's contorted face.

Her grip tightened on the phone as Vivian's mocking smile seemed to materialize on the screen.

The woman who stole everything would pay.
###Chapter 695

A cold smirk played on Annika Heilbronn's lips as her gaze swept over Sophia Evans' face.

"That son of yours is nothing but dead weight." Her voice was soft yet cutting.

"Ethan Roscente won't thank you for keeping him. Sometimes the dead hold more value than the living."

Sophia's pupils contracted.

She'd considered this possibility before. Theo was Alexander Roscente's only bloodline. His death would shatter Ethan.

Sophia clenched her fists.

...

Queen Eleanor's scandal continued to spiral out of control online. The royal PR team couldn't contain the fallout.

When the Queen regained consciousness, her fingers dug into Vivian Laurent's wrist like talons.

"My child isn't a monster...right?" Her voice trembled.

Vivian gently grasped her hand. "It's just a common congenital defect. Surgery can correct it."

"Please save him..." Tears streamed down the Queen's face.

"I'll do everything in my power."

The Queen's unstable condition forced postponement of the scheduled surgery.

"I want the procedure today!" The Queen suddenly became agitated.

Vivian shook her head. "Your emotional state makes it too risky. You must protect yourself first to protect your child."

Fiona Grandelle hugged her mother with red-rimmed eyes. "You need to stay strong, Mother."

The Queen stroked her daughter's long hair. "You've suffered so much these years."

Though the palace claimed Fiona had fragile health, vicious rumors never ceased.

Fiona buried her face in her mother's shoulder. "With Vivian here, everything will be alright."

After reviewing the monitors, Vivian confirmed the surgery must be delayed.

Online outrage reached fever pitch.

Some spread rumors the unborn child carried a curse that would destroy the Kingdom of Eudora.

Demands for termination grew louder.

Worse, someone leaked the Queen's prenatal records.

Medical experts analyzed: "This isn't a monster, just typical developmental delays. But post-birth surgery may cause permanent disabilities."

Public opinion overwhelmingly favored ending the pregnancy.
###Chapter 696

"As an obstetrician, I strongly recommend terminating this pregnancy."

"The fetus has extremely low survival chances. Continuing would only endanger the mother."

A comment immediately asked: "Is surgery still possible at this stage?"

"Theoretically yes, but it's highly risky."

"The underdeveloped fetus could suffer limb damage with the slightest error."

"If severed limbs remain in the uterus, the consequences would be catastrophic."

"So this is basically an impossible surgery?"

"Not entirely. Unless... Dr. Luna takes the case."

"Dr. Luna? Hasn't she disappeared for years?"

"True. I wonder if the Queen could persuade this legend."

The discussion shifted to another name.

"Canada has a doctor named Vivian Laurent. They say she can raise the dead."

"Vivian Laurent? Never heard of her. Probably exaggerated rumors."

"I checked recent news. She allegedly caused a patient's death last week."

"Online forums are calling her a murderer."

"A murderer still practicing medicine?"

"Wait... I think I saw Vivian in Eudora recently."

"Would the Queen actually hire a killer doctor?"

"Even specialists can't handle this case. Is Her Majesty insane?"

The online storm rapidly intensified against Vivian.

Fiona Grandelle trembled with anger. "These idiots know nothing!"

She created a burner account to join the fight.

Vivian remained calm. "Ignore them."

"But you are Dr. Luna!" Fiona protested. "How dare they slander you!"

She recruited Emily Garnache for counterattacks.

Vivian shook her head helplessly.

The Queen's pleading voice broke through. "Doctor, please... I can't hold on..."

Seeing Her Majesty's pallid face, Vivian finally nodded. "Surgery tomorrow."
###Chapter 697

Sunlight streamed through the operating room windows but failed to dispel the heavy tension in the air.

Queen Eleanor lay on the surgical table, her fingers clutching the sheets until her knuckles turned white. Her pale lips trembled as she whispered, "Dr. Laurent... I'm scared..."

Vivian Laurent snapped on sterile gloves with practiced ease. "Take deep breaths," she soothed. "Imagine you're lying in a garden."

As anesthesia flowed into the queen's veins, her eyelashes fluttered shut.

The operating theater hummed with activity as Eudora's top obstetric specialists stood ready. A blonde surgeon crossed her arms. "Letting a general surgeon lead this high-risk procedure? This is reckless endangerment of Her Majesty's life."

Vivian adjusted her microscope without looking up. "Medicine knows no borders."

"Arrogant!" The blonde slammed a tray. "Do you comprehend the consequences of failure?"

The surgery commenced. Vivian's slender fingers danced across microsurgical instruments, a sheen of sweat glistening at her temples.

"Too slow," the blonde surgeon muttered. "At this rate, the fetus won't survive."

A shrill alarm pierced the air.

"Blood pressure crashing!" a nurse shouted.

In that critical moment, the blonde "accidentally" jostled the operating table. Vivian's instrument slipped—

Crimson flooded the monitor screen.

"God! The fetal femoral artery ruptured!"

Chaos erupted. The blonde surgeon backed away, pointing. "This... this is malpractice! Dr. Laurent's responsibility!"

Vivian's gaze locked onto the pulsing blood fountain. Her voice cut through the panic like steel. "Fetal vascular repair kit. Now."
###Chapter 698

"The surgery was almost successful until you bumped into Dr. Laurent's arm!" A nurse couldn't help speaking up.

"That's a lie! I never touched her!" The female doctor shrieked in protest. "As the lead surgeon, the failure is entirely her responsibility!"

She glared viciously at Vivian Laurent, determined to pin all the blame on her.

"Enough!" Vivian's sharp command instantly silenced the operating room.

Her decisive order cut through the tension. "Prepare for an emergency laparotomy."

There was no time for blame games now. The Queen and her unborn child's lives hung by a thread.

"A laparotomy?" The female doctor gasped dramatically. "The fetus is barely developed! This is murder!"

Vivian didn't even glance her way. "Remove her."

"You can't! I was personally appointed by Her Majesty!" The woman screamed hysterically.

Without hesitation, Vivian grabbed a surgical gauze and shoved it into the woman's mouth.

"Restrain her." Vivian's icy gaze swept across the room. "Anyone else disrupting this procedure will face consequences."

The muffled doctor thrashed uselessly against the nurses holding her.

Complete silence fell over the operating theater.

Vivian's scalpel made one precise incision across the Queen's abdomen.

Her movements flowed with practiced grace, not a single hesitation.

The tiny fetus, no larger than a palm, was carefully extracted.

Vivian worked alone, refusing any assistance.

Her slender fingers moved with meticulous precision, as if conducting a delicate symphony.

Only the steady beeping of monitors filled the sterile air.

Every witness held their breath, watching the young surgeon perform what seemed like an impossible miracle.
###Chapter 699

The fragile vital signs of the fetus flickered on the monitor.

The placenta still pulsed faintly within the mother's body.

Vivian Laurent's gloved hands remained steady as stone.

"Prepare the microsurgical instruments," she ordered without looking up.

The operating room fell into absolute silence.

Every doctor held their breath.

With precision, Vivian separated the fetus's conjoined limbs.

Her movements were so fast they nearly blurred.

"Hemostat."

"Suture thread."

Each command was crisp and authoritative.

Three hours later.

The fetal deformities had been perfectly corrected.

Vivian gently returned the fetus to the mother's womb.

"It's done."

As she removed her mask, beads of sweat glistened on her forehead.

"That...that's it?"

"Incredible!"

"Dr. Laurent, would you consider taking students?"

Gasps of awe filled the room.

In the corner, a gagged doctor turned pale with fury.

"The Queen will recover upon waking," Vivian said, massaging her aching lower back.

Her hand instinctively cradled her own abdomen.

"Remove it."

Only then did her assistant pull the gag from the protesting doctor's mouth.

"Fraud!"

"You're just hogging the credit!"

The shrill accusations resumed.

Vivian didn't even blink.

"True skill speaks for itself."

The surveillance footage captured everything.

The King's face darkened upon receiving the report.

"Take him for interrogation."

Guards immediately escorted the troublemaker away.

"Dr. Luna, we are eternally grateful."

The King bowed deeply.

The title made every doctor freeze.

"Luna?"

Someone dared to whisper.

Vivian's shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly.

"You're really Dr. Luna?"

The room erupted.

Every gaze burned with newfound reverence.
###Chapter 700

"You've mistaken me for someone else." Vivian Laurent's expression remained impassive.

"But your aura resembles Dr. Luna's so much," the person insisted.

Vivian offered no further response. Their scrutinizing gazes lingered on her.

Inside the operating theater at Eudora Royal Hospital, the medical staff knew Vivian was waiting for Queen Eleanor to regain consciousness.

Suddenly, hurried footsteps echoed down the corridor.

"Dr. Laurent!" A nurse burst in. "Emergency room—car crash victim with cardiac penetration! They need you!"

Vivian glanced at the steady vitals on the queen's monitor before turning away without hesitation.

On the operating table, a metal shard protruded from the patient's heart. The monitor screamed with alarm.

Gloves snapped onto Vivian's hands with lightning speed.

"Clamp."

"Suction."

Her voice was terrifyingly calm.

Six hours later, the surgical lights dimmed. The patient's heartbeat stabilized into a steady rhythm.

Gasps of awe filled the OR.

"My God... It's a miracle..."

Meanwhile, in the VIP suite, Queen Eleanor's eyelids fluttered open.

"Mother!" Fiona Grandelle rushed to the bedside.

The queen smiled weakly. "The surgery... Was it successful? Where's Dr. Luna?"

The two attending physicians froze in shock.

"Dr. Luna went to handle an emergency," one managed to reply.

Satisfied, the queen closed her eyes, oblivious to their stunned expressions.

Their exchanged glance conveyed the same realization—that young woman they'd doubted was indeed the legendary Dr. Luna.

In another OR, Vivian finished her third consecutive surgery.

Twelve hours of intense focus left her swaying on her feet.

As the doors slid open, a tall figure came into view.

Ethan Roscente stood waiting, holding an exquisite food container.

"How did you get in?" Vivian's voice was hoarse.

"I told them I was Dr. Laurent's fiancé." His lips curved slightly. "They let me right through."

Only then did Vivian notice the "Family" badge clipped to his chest.

The container opened, releasing the comforting aroma of freshly baked pastry.

"Exhausted?" He pulled over a chair. "Eat first, then rest against me for a while."

Vivian accepted the cake. Sweet cream melted on her tongue.

In this moment, every ounce of fatigue seemed worthwhile.
###Chapter 701

Vivian Laurent leaned back on the sofa, closing her eyes in exhaustion. She had just completed two surgeries without a moment's rest.

"How is Queen Eleanor's condition?" She forced her eyes open to ask.

Ethan Roscente handed her a glass of water. "She's out of danger. You should rest."

Before Vivian could take a sip, the lounge door swung open. A young doctor stood awkwardly in the doorway. "Dr. Laurent, there's a critical patient in the ER—"

"That's enough!" Ethan rose abruptly. "She's been working nonstop for eight hours!"

The young doctor recoiled, stammering apologies.

Vivian stared at Ethan in surprise. She'd never seen him so protective of anyone.

Her glass barely touched her lips when the door burst open again. This time, five white-coated doctors poured in, their eyes alight with excitement.

"You're Dr. Luna, aren't you?"
"My God, it's really you!"
"Could you advise on this neurosurgical case?"

Vivian nearly dropped her water. She'd always denied this identity.

"You've mistaken me for someone else," she said automatically.

The lead doctor eagerly pulled out his phone. "It's all over the internet!"

Vivian took the device. The screen displayed the trending hashtag: #VivianLaurentIsDrLuna#

Her breath caught. The secret she'd guarded for years had been exposed like this.

The comments section exploded:
"I knew her techniques looked familiar!"
"So she wrote all those medical papers!"
"This is what a true medical genius looks like!"

Vivian massaged her temples. She'd never practiced medicine for fame, yet now she stood thrust into the spotlight.
###Chapter 702

"Oh my god! Dr. Luna is actually Vivian Laurent!" The medical school forum exploded with activity.

A student with the username "MedJourney" posted: "I have Dr. Luna's surgical case notes pinned above my bed. Now you're telling me she's Vivian? This is surreal!"

Thousands of replies flooded the comment section within seconds.

"How do those Vivian-haters feel now? She's literally a certified medical genius!"

"Who cares if she's a miracle doctor? Maybe she used her skills to commit murder!" An anonymous user sneered in the comments.

The remark instantly drew backlash.

"You have no idea what you're talking about! Dr. Luna's 'New Theory on Neural Repair' saved my grandfather's life!"

"Exactly! Her cancer treatment gave my mom three extra years!"

"Keyboard warriors like you should shut up. Let's see if you still dare to slander her when you're begging for her help on the operating table!"

Vivian scrolled through her phone, fingertips gliding lightly across the screen.

She looked up at Ethan Roscente standing by the window.

"Wasn't me." Ethan immediately raised his hands in surrender. "I promised to keep your secret."

Vivian nodded. "Where's Theo?"

"Sent to meet Sophia Evans." Ethan sighed. "The kid's been asking for his mother a lot lately."

He paused. "I assigned eight bodyguards. Nothing should go wrong."

Vivian's brows furrowed slightly.

Sophia's calculating eyes flashed through her mind.

"You should rest." Vivian stood up. "I need to check on the Queen."

The operating room light remained on.

The heart monitor beeped steadily in the background.
###Chapter 703

Vivian Laurent pushed open the hospital room door to find several doctors still gathered around Queen Eleanor's bedside.

Their heads lifted in unison, eyes gleaming with excitement.

"Dr. Luna!"

This time, Vivian didn't correct them. She gave a slight nod. "Why aren't you resting?"

"We were waiting for you," a female doctor said eagerly.

Now that Vivian's identity was confirmed, they had countless questions.

"How is Her Majesty?"

"Stable. All vitals are normal."

Vivian moved toward the bed. "Go get some rest. I'll take over tonight."

Two doctors lingered reluctantly. Before leaving, one blurted out, "You're our idol!"

Vivian offered a polite smile.

Inside the quiet room, Queen Eleanor lay weakly against the pillows.

Fiona Grandelle stood vigil by the bedside. When Vivian entered, the queen struggled to sit up.

"Don't move." Vivian gently restrained her. "Your abdominal wound requires complete rest."

The queen grasped Vivian's hand tightly. "Dr. Luna, without you, my child and I would have—"

"My duty," Vivian interjected softly.

"That doctor has been punished. She'll never hold a scalpel again."

Vivian nodded noncommittally.

"You've performed two consecutive surgeries. You should rest."

"Tonight is critical. I'm staying."

The queen didn't protest further. Having Vivian here brought undeniable reassurance.

Outside, Ethan Roscente waited silently.

Thirty minutes later, Vivian emerged, closing the door quietly behind her.

"Still here?" She arched an eyebrow.

Ethan took her slightly chilled fingers in his. "Keeping you company."

He guided her to a bench. "Theo just texted. He wants to stay with Sophia Evans tonight."

Vivian leaned back against the seat. "Is it safe?"

"The guards report no issues."

The wall clock ticked toward midnight.

Ethan shifted closer. "Tired?"

His shoulder offered steady support.

"No need." Vivian shook her head. "If I get sleepy, I'll find somewhere to rest."
###Chapter 704

Ethan sent Theo a voice message, reminding the boy to get some rest.

As his phone screen went dark, he lifted his gaze to Vivian, warmth shimmering in his eyes.

"Why are you staring at me?"

The intensity of his gaze made her ears burn. She instantly regretted sitting beside him.

"Just want to look at you a little longer."

"Looking costs money."

"How much?"

If time with Vivian could truly be bought, Ethan would empty his entire fortune without hesitation.

But she wasn't a commodity. She was a treasure he feared might melt in his palms.

"Priceless. You can't afford it." Vivian turned her face away.

Ethan chuckled softly. Even the air tasted sweeter when she was near.

"Vivi, want to take a trip?" he asked abruptly.

"Are you insane? It's the middle of the night."

"Not now. Sometime this week."

"Not interested." Her refusal was absolute.

Their last "vacation" had stranded them on Santorini Island—a memory still fresh in her mind.

"Eudora has breathtaking scenery. It'd be a shame to miss it."

"Spoken like an expert. How many women have you taken there?"

"Just you." He held up a single finger. "And that one trip ended disastrously."

"What about Sophia Evans?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

At the name, Ethan's eyes lit up.

"Curious? Have dinner with me tomorrow and I'll tell you."

"Suddenly I don't care anymore."

"Too late. You're stuck with me for dinner tonight."

Vivian fumed. The man had thicker skin than a castle wall.

"You only ate cake earlier. You need real food."

Ethan couldn't bear the thought of her going hungry. A food street stretched near the hospital.

"Fine. You're paying." She relented grudgingly.

With Queen Eleanor asleep, they slipped out unnoticed.

The night breeze carried a chill. Vivian suddenly craved hot noodle soup from her hometown.

But every noodle shop had closed along the street.

"Forget it. Let's go back." She didn't want to trouble him.

Ethan insisted, "Wait for me in your room."

An hour later, he returned with a thermal container clutched to his chest.

"Eat it before it gets soggy."

When Vivian lifted the lid, she froze at the sight of the pathetic-looking noodles.

The uneven cuts. The half-raw poached egg...

"You made this?"

"Every restaurant was closed. Had to learn from scratch."

Band-aids dotted his fingers. Flour dusted his sleeves.
###Chapter 705

"It's my first time cooking. Might not taste great."

Ethan Roscente pushed the lunchbox toward her, his eyes flickering with nervousness. This was the tomato egg noodles he'd practiced making countless times.

Vivian Laurent picked up her fork, twirling the noodles before taking a bite.

The rich tomato flavor burst on her tongue. The eggs were perfectly scrambled, the noodles delightfully chewy.

"Not bad," she remarked casually.

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Mmm. Better than your last attempt with porridge."

He exhaled in relief. "Have more then. What would you like tomorrow? I'll have it prepared."

Vivian ate slowly, putting down her fork halfway through.

"Done already?"

"I'm full."

Ethan naturally took the lunchbox and continued eating with her used fork.

"You—" Vivian's eyes widened.

He chewed unconcerned. "No wasting food."

"I'll get a dog next time," Vivian snapped.

Ethan paused, looking genuinely shocked. "You'd give the dog's leftovers to me?"

"..."

Vivian turned away in frustration. This man was usually so decisive—why was he being so dense now?

A faint smile flickered in Ethan's eyes as he kept eating.

The sudden ringtone shattered the moment.

Ethan checked the caller ID—Theo's bodyguard.

"Report."

Urgent words spilled from the receiver.

Clatter—

The lunchbox slipped from Ethan's grip, spilling sauce on the carpet.

"Get him to the hospital now!" His voice trembled. "Theo cannot be harmed!"

Vivian had never seen Ethan so unhinged. His face drained of color, fingers clenching the phone until his knuckles turned white.

"What happened?" she demanded.

Ethan hung up, his entire body shaking. "Theo's hurt."

"Sophia Evans, she—"

Vivian couldn't believe it. What mother would harm her own child?

Her hand instinctively touched her abdomen. As an expectant mother, she understood that primal bond better than anyone.

"Explain," she pressed.

Ethan was already on his feet, grabbing his coat. "Hospital. Now."
###Chapter 706

Ethan Roscente's hands trembled violently.

"Sophia Evans stabbed Theo seven times." His voice was hoarse beyond recognition. "He's in emergency surgery now."

His eyes were bloodshot, as if they might bleed any second.

That madwoman didn't even spare her own son.

Theo was the last heir of the Roscente family, entrusted to him by his dying elder brother.

"Where is he?" Vivian Laurent stood up immediately.

She had just removed her surgical gown, strands of hair still damp with sweat clinging to her forehead.

"En route to ER." Ethan glanced at his watch. "But you've already worked sixteen hours straight."

Vivian had performed four major surgeries today.

The last one ended less than ten minutes ago.

"Prep OR One." She pressed the intercom without hesitation. "Alert blood bank and mobilize pediatric surgery team."

A flurry of confirmations crackled through the speaker.

"Theo's only five." Ethan punched the wall. "That bitch targeted vital organs."

Vivian rapidly scanned the incoming digital charts.

CT showed two abdominal penetrations and one cardiac graze.

"We have time." She secured her mask. "If there's still a heartbeat, I'll drag him back from death's door."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

The gurney wheels screeched against linoleum.

"Clear the way!"

Medics rushed through the doors with a blood-soaked stretcher.

Theo's pale face was smeared crimson.

The fruit knife still protruded from his abdomen, quivering with each shallow breath.

"BP 60 over 40!"

"HR 140 and climbing!"

"OR Two stat!" Vivian shed her coat while sprinting. "Prep ECMO now!"

Ethan was barred at the OR doors.

His distorted reflection glared from the glass.

"Dr. Laurent..." A nurse offered a fresh scrub suit. "Are you sure you should—"

Vivian already had gloves on.

"Page anesthesia." She strode into the theater without turning. "I want thoracotomy access in twenty."

Under the surgical lights, Theo's body looked heartbreakingly small.

Vivian took a steadying breath and raised her scalpel.

"Mark time."
###Chapter 707

Vivian Laurent whispered softly, "Theo is strong. He'll pull through. I'll use everything I've learned to save him."

Ethan Roscente's fingers tightened around Vivian's wrist, his knuckles turning white. "Vivian..."

She suddenly leaned in and embraced him. "When I come out of that operating room, I'll return Theo to you safe and sound."

The hug lasted only a moment before she turned and strode toward the OR.

As the assisting surgeon, Vivian had already coordinated with the lead physician. But she had just completed three complex surgeries back-to-back without a moment's rest.

Theo's vitals were crashing rapidly. Each stab wound was life-threatening—the deepest had pierced his heart, another had punctured a kidney, and the rest had struck other vital organs.

The kidney damage was especially severe. A transplant might be necessary.

...

Outside the OR, Ethan made a call, his voice icy. "Detain Sophia Evans immediately."

He never imagined Sophia could sink to such depravity. That was her own child—how could she do this?

If Sophia stood before him now, Ethan wouldn't hesitate to snap her neck.

Pacing the hallway, each second was agony. He silently prayed: Big brother, watch over Theo.

This was all his fault. He never should have brought Theo back. Never should have let mother and son reunite.

Inside the OR, Theo's condition was worse than anticipated.

His heartbeat was so faint it nearly flatlined. Time was running out. The heart needed repair, and the kidney required replacement.

Vivian immediately initiated a donor match search. But the cardiac procedure was too high-risk for the on-call surgeon to attempt.

"I'll do it," Vivian stated firmly.

"Dr. Laurent, you've already worked eighteen hours straight—"

"This isn't the time for that debate!" She snapped on gloves. "If I can't handle it, you'll take over."

The hospital had precedent for marathon surgeries. But Vivian's previous procedures had been precision operations—mentally exhausting work.

The surgeon yielded the table. Examining the wounds, Vivian found the blade had missed Theo's heart by millimeters. Another fraction of an inch, and he would have died instantly.

The surgery progressed. Other doctors watched breathlessly as Vivian worked with masterful precision none could match.

Her suturing was flawless. Years of experience allowed her to stitch blindfolded with perfect accuracy.

The cardiac procedure consumed precious time. More troubling—the kidney was severely damaged, yet no matching donor could be found.
###Chapter 708

"The family donor has higher compatibility." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "We must act immediately."

Vivian Laurent clenched her phone. Theo's father had long passed away, leaving only Ethan Roscente and Sophia Evans as potential donors.

Ethan's voice was decisive when he answered. "I'll come for testing immediately. As for Sophia, I'll have her brought here."

The results came back quickly. Ethan's kidneys weren't compatible with Theo.

Sophia arrived in a white dress stained with Theo's blood. She struggled violently until a sharp chop to her neck rendered her unconscious.

"No match." The doctor shook his head.

Vivian stared at the report, her fingertips turning cold. Time was slipping away—Theo couldn't wait much longer.

"How long to source a kidney globally?" Ethan loosened his tie.

"I'll buy us time." Vivian pressed her lips together. "But the transportation must go flawlessly."

As Ethan turned to make international calls, Vivian suddenly stopped him. "What was your brother's blood type?"

"Same as mine. Type O."

Vivian's head snapped up. "Sophia is Type B, but Theo is Type A."

The air froze solid between them. The unbreakable laws of blood type inheritance hung like an iron curtain.

"Are you certain..." Vivian's voice tightened. "That Theo was really your brother's child?"

Ethan's jawline hardened. Theo did bear some Roscente features, but now every detail seemed distorted.

"We'll do a paternity test." He grabbed his jacket. "Now."

The hallway lights glared harshly. Vivian studied Ethan's tense profile. "If Theo isn't—"

"Save him first." He cut her off. "The child is innocent."

Memories churned in Ethan's mind—his brother's dying phone call, missing the birth during his recovery, the fragile infant he'd met upon returning. Each memory now clouded with suspicion.

If this was all a lie... had that fatal car accident really been just an accident?
###Chapter 709

Ethan's fingernails dug deep into his palms.

The truth coiled around his heart like a venomous serpent.

Sophia had known everything, yet chose to deceive him.

Years of lies had eroded his trust like a dull blade sawing through flesh.

"If the child isn't my brother's..." Ethan's eyes burned crimson.

The operating room's red light seared his vision.

Vivian's voice pulled him back. "The blood type mismatch is suspicious. But Theo looks so much like your brother..."

She hesitated. "I suspect he might not be Sophia's biological child."

The theory turned Ethan's blood to ice.

"I need to get back." Vivian checked her watch. "Theo can't wait."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "Do whatever it takes."

Inside the OR...

The heart monitor screamed its shrill alarm.

Theo's pale face sank into the pillow like a shattered porcelain doll.

Vivian gently squeezed his tiny, cold hand.

"Hold on, sweetheart."

Suddenly, Ethan called.

"We found a kidney donor!"

Vivian's eyes lit up.

"A terminally ill child. Perfect match."

Hope flared—then reality crushed it.

"It'll take seven to eight hours to transport."

Vivian watched the monitor's erratic numbers.

"Hurry." Her voice tightened. "I'll stabilize him as long as I can."

Minutes ticked by.

Sweat beaded on Vivian's lashes.

She hadn't slept in thirty-six hours.

Footsteps echoed outside.

Fiona rushed in. "Ethan!"

His lips cracked with dried blood.

"Still waiting."

"Anything you need." Fiona wrung her hands. "Vivian saved our whole family."

The monitor shrieked a new alarm.

"BP crashing!"

"Heart rate unstable!"

Medical staff snapped to attention.

The surgeon's face darkened. "Where's that kidney?"

Vivian checked the clock. "Just landed."

"Too slow!" The doctor barked. "Thirty minutes max!"

Theo's breathing grew fainter.

Vivian leaned close to his ear. "Mommy's here. Don't be afraid."
###Chapter 710

The clock in the operating room ticked relentlessly.

Beads of sweat formed on Vivian Laurent's forehead.

"Dr. Laurent, the child's heart rate is dropping again!" The nurse's voice trembled.

The monitor emitted a piercing alarm.

Vivian's hands remained steady as granite. "Administer 0.5mg epinephrine IV push."

Her eyes flicked to the clock.

Twenty-five minutes until the kidney arrived.

"Has Mr. Roscente been contacted?" Her voice held terrifying calm.

The assistant responded swiftly. "The organ just landed. It's en route now."

Vivian's fingertips turned pale.

She remembered her promise to Ethan Roscente.

Outside the OR, medical staff paced anxiously.

"This is the absolute limit..."

"Dr. Laurent won't give up."

The monitor's waveforms grew weaker.

Vivian suddenly looked up. "Prepare for bypass."

Everyone froze.

"But—"

"Now!" Her command brooked no argument.

The OR erupted into controlled chaos.

The bypass machine hummed to life.

Their final hope.

Seconds crawled by.

"Blood pressure unstable..."

"Continue fluids." Vivian never took her eyes off the monitor.

The OR doors burst open.

"The kidney's here!"

A spark flashed in Vivian's eyes.

"Begin transplant prep."

For three relentless hours,

Vivian's hands never faltered.

When the final suture was placed,

The monitor's lines stabilized at last.

The OR doors slid open.

Vivian stumbled slightly.

Thirty sleepless hours.

Her lab coat clung with sweat.

Yet a faint smile touched her lips.

"The child... will live."

Muffled cheers echoed down the hallway.

When Ethan arrived,

He found Vivian leaning against the wall.

Sunlight streamed through the window,

Painting her in golden light.

In this moment,

She hadn't just performed a miracle.

She'd outrun Death itself.
###Chapter 711

The operating room lights finally dimmed.

Theo was wheeled into the ICU. Though the surgery was successful, the next 24 hours would be critical.

Vivian removed her mask, revealing deep indentations on her cheeks. She leaned against the wall, her bangs damp with sweat.

Ethan rushed to her side and pulled her into a tight embrace.

"Vivian, thank you."

His voice trembled.

During the procedure, Theo had coded multiple times. When the kidney transport was delayed, the child nearly didn't make it.

It was Vivian's quick decision to modify the surgical plan that snatched him back from death's door.

"I'm a doctor," she said softly, pushing him away. "Saving lives is my duty."

She didn't want Ethan to misunderstand her intentions.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I know. But this debt—I'll remember it for life."

"Don't celebrate yet." Vivian massaged her temples. "The risk of post-op infection is high."

"I believe in Theo." Ethan glanced toward the ICU. "Can I see him?"

"Wait for visiting hours." She checked her watch. "Go rest in the lounge."

Ethan noticed the bloodshot veins in her eyes. "You should get some sleep."

"Queen Eleanor still needs her follow-up." Vivian turned to leave.

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Let another doctor handle it."

"You didn't sleep last night either," she countered.

They stood at an impasse.

"Did the test results come back?" Vivian changed the subject.

Ethan shook his head. "Even expedited, we won't know until tomorrow."

"What about Sophia?"

"Locked up at the estate." His gaze turned icy. "We'll deal with her after Theo stabilizes."

Vivian suddenly covered her mouth and bolted for the restroom.

She dry-heaved over the sink, her stomach churning violently but producing nothing.

Ethan followed, handing her a tissue. "Are you—"

"Just exhausted." She cut him off.

In the mirror, her face was ghostly pale.
###Chapter 712
Sudden Crisis

Vivian pushed open the restroom door to find Ethan still waiting outside.

"This is the women's restroom entrance," she frowned. "People will think you're a creep."

"I was waiting for you," Ethan's gaze lingered on her face. "You look pale."

Vivian instinctively touched her cheek. "Must be the lighting."

"You need rest," Ethan said firmly.

"I'll leave after checking on the Queen." She waved him off. "You should rest too. Standing here won't help."

Ethan nodded slightly, warmth spreading through him at her concern.

Upstairs, Vivian found the Queen awake with the King feeding her porridge.

"Dr. Laurent!" The Queen's eyes lit up. "Thank you so much."

Vivian smiled. "Just doing my job."

"I heard someone offended you during the surgery." The Queen's expression hardened. "They'll pay for it."

After examining both the Queen and newborn, Vivian confirmed everything was stable.

"Isn't Mr. Roscente's child also here?" The Queen asked.

Ethan's reputation in business circles extended even to royal connections.

"Just had surgery," Vivian nodded. "Still critical."

"You've been working nonstop since yesterday." The Queen gestured to an attendant. "I'll arrange a car to take you home. Let Mr. Roscente know we can assist if needed."

Vivian thanked her and prepared to leave. Though not feeling tired, logic demanded she rest.

She left emergency contacts with the hospital staff. The moment she entered the car, her phone rang.

"Dr. Laurent! Theodore is rejecting the transplant!"

"On my way!"

When Vivian rushed back, Ethan stood outside the ER receiving a critical condition notice.

"The surgery succeeded!" His hand trembled holding the pen.

The nurse explained, "Organ rejection is common, especially with his existing injuries..."

Ethan's eyes were bloodshot. "Can you save my son?"
###Chapter 713

The nurses exchanged uneasy glances, none daring to make any promises.

The glaring red letters on the critical condition notice burned into Ethan Roscente's vision.

"Sir, you must sign this before we can proceed with resuscitation."

Ethan snatched the document, his pen nearly tearing through the paper.

His hand trembled as he signed.

The surgery had been successful—how could Theo's condition suddenly deteriorate?

Vivian Laurent's exhausted face flashed through his mind.

He gripped his phone but ultimately didn't dial her number.

The operating room lights glared harshly.

Ethan slammed his fist against the wall, blood seeping from his knuckles.

This was all Sophia Evans's fault!

That vile woman!

His assistant rushed over, handing him two sealed files.

Ethan stared at the paternity test reports, his breathing turning ragged.

He tore open the first one—his and Theo's.

A 73% match rate made him shut his eyes briefly.

With shaking fingers, he opened the second report.

The words "No Biological Relation" stabbed into his heart like a blade.

Darkness edged his vision.

All these years of preferential treatment, all his restraint—it had all been a joke.

The hospital room door burst open.

Sophia was berating a nurse when she froze mid-sentence.

"Ethan?" Her voice caught in her throat.

The murderous rage in his eyes turned her blood to ice.

He seized her by the throat and slammed her against the wall.

"Why?" His voice grated like sandpaper.

Sophia's feet left the ground, her face turning purple.

"Theo adored you..." Ethan's grip tightened.

As nurses screamed, Sophia clawed bloody streaks into his arm.

"Do you have any idea..." His eyes burned crimson, "...about that paternity test?"

Sophia's pupils contracted violently.

Finally, she understood the source of his fury.

Mortal terror consumed her.

Oxygen dwindled. Darkness crept in.
###Chapter 714

Ethan Roscente's fingers tightened around Sophia Evans's slender neck, veins bulging across his hands.

His eyes burned with uncontainable fury, as if he wanted to tear this woman limb from limb.

"If anything happens to Theo, I'll make you wish you were dead."

Sophia's face turned crimson as her legs kicked helplessly in the air.

Her nails dug deep into Ethan's hands, but she couldn't loosen his grip.

Just as she was about to lose consciousness, Ethan abruptly released her.

"Speak! Who is Theo's real mother?"

Sophia collapsed to the floor, coughing violently as she gasped for air.

"I... I am Theo's mother..."

Ethan let out a cold laugh and threw a stack of documents in her face.

"The paternity test proves you share no blood relation with Theo."

Papers scattered across the floor. Sophia stared at the report, her pupils contracting sharply.

She never expected Ethan to uncover this truth.

"You've deceived me for years." Ethan's voice was icy. "This is your last chance."

Suddenly, Sophia erupted into hysterical laughter, her makeup smeared across her twisted face.

"That little bastard isn't dead yet? What a pity..."

She lifted her head, madness flashing in her eyes.

"That's right! I wanted him dead!"

"Ethan Roscente, you drove me to this!"

"You imprisoned me here, destroyed my career, ruined my face..."

"I've lost everything. Why should you get to be happy?"

Her screams were shrill, like a dying animal.

"If I'm going to hell, I'm taking everyone with me!"

"Vivian Laurent, you, and that little bastard—none of you will escape!"

Ethan's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked, murderous intent radiating from him.

Just then, the emergency room lights flickered off.
###Chapter 715

Ethan Roscente glared coldly at the deranged woman before him.

"Theo will be fine." His voice was low and controlled. "He has his whole life ahead of him. But as for you, Sophia Evans, your time is up."

He would never allow this woman to harm anyone again.

Sophia threw her head back in hysterical laughter. "He won't survive! I curse him to die today! To never wake up!"

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Ethan never raised his hand against women, but Sophia's venomous words pushed him past his limits.

"Hit me again! Go on!" Sophia pressed a hand to her reddened cheek, eyes gleaming with madness. "Even if you kill me, Theo won't make it! Let's see how you explain that to your brother!"

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"Shut your mouth." His fingers closed around her throat. "You don't get to speak of him."

Sophia's face darkened from lack of air, yet she continued laughing. "Do it... Ethan... Do you have the guts?"

She had lost her mind long ago.

The moment she decided to hurt Theo, she had descended into complete insanity.

"Madwoman."

Ethan released her with a disgusted flick of his fingers.

"Take her away." He ordered the bodyguards. "Make sure she never sees daylight again."

He wouldn't dirty his hands with murder.

But the law would.

Sophia's laughter trailed down the hallway like a demon's curse. Ethan strode away with one thought burning in his mind: Theo must survive.

......

The ER was a cacophony of blaring alarms.

"Blood pressure still dropping!"

"Heart rate unstable!"

Doctors scrambled, sweat beading on their brows.

"Where's Dr. Laurent?" The lead surgeon demanded.

"Still en route."

"We're running out of time..." The surgeon stared at the erratic numbers on the monitor. "At this rate..."

The doors burst open.

"Move."

Vivian Laurent strode in and took the surgical instruments without hesitation.

Her presence instantly steadied the room.

"Status?" Her voice was eerily calm as she worked.

The monitor's numbers began to stabilize.
###Chapter 716

"Dr. Laurent!" The head nurse burst into the office just as Vivian was removing her lab coat.

The shrill alarm of a monitor pierced through the hallway. Vivian grabbed her stethoscope and sprinted out, her long hair whipping behind her.

Inside the OR, the cardiac monitor displayed a flatline. The lead surgeon's forehead glistened with sweat, his fingers trembling slightly.

"Move." Vivian's voice cut through the tension like a scalpel.

She tore open a sterile glove package with her teeth. Her fingers found the precise puncture point in one fluid motion. The moment the needle pierced skin, the monitor emitted a weak beep.

Three hours later.

Beads of sweat clung to Vivian's lashes. Her surgical gown was soaked through. Only when the monitor stabilized into a steady rhythm did her fingers finally release the hemostat.

"Dr. Laurent..." The anesthesiologist offered a glucose solution.

She shook her head. As she turned, darkness suddenly swallowed her vision.

"Thud—"

Ethan Roscente paced outside the ICU. The sound of wheels against linoleum made his head snap up.

"Vivian?"

The figure on the gurney was deathly pale. Ethan seized the nurse's wrist. "What happened?"

"Dr. Laurent worked 36 hours straight. She collapsed right after performing cardiac resuscitation." The nurse winced at his grip. "Preliminary diagnosis is hypoglycemia and exhaustion."

Ethan released her, his knuckles white. He'd texted Vivian to go home hours ago.

In the recovery room, Vivian's lashes cast delicate shadows under the lights. Ethan gently enveloped her icy fingers.

"Run full bloodwork," he suddenly ordered the resident physician.

The resident blinked. "But Dr. Laurent's symptoms clearly indicate—"

"Do it." Ethan's voice turned glacial.

His gaze locked onto the faint needle mark below Vivian's collarbone. Last week's surveillance photos showed her entering the oncology center alone.
###Chapter 717

"Something feels off about Dr. Laurent's physical condition. Can we schedule a full examination?" Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed with concern. "If it's just exhaustion, that's manageable. But we need to rule out other possibilities."

The physician nodded. "Of course. We'll arrange it immediately."

Given Vivian Laurent's immense contributions to the hospital, a comprehensive checkup was the least they could provide.

The tests concluded swiftly, yet the wait for results stretched unbearably long.

Vivian remained unconscious in the hospital bed, her pallid complexion twisting Ethan's heart with anguish.

He should have insisted she rest earlier.

She'd already left the hospital, only to rush back to save an unknown child's life.

Ethan clasped her icy fingers, his eyes reddening slightly.

"Vivian, you must pull through."

Upon receiving news of the situation, Queen Eleanor demanded expedited processing of the test results.

The report arrived shortly.

"Dr. Laurent's coma resulted from hypoglycemia and extreme fatigue. However..." The doctor hesitated.

"However what?" Ethan's voice sharpened abruptly.

"Dr. Laurent is five months pregnant. Weren't you aware?" The physician posed the question cautiously.

Ethan froze as if struck by lightning.

Five months?

Fragments of Vivian's recent behavior flashed through his mind—frequent hospital visits, Lucas Lefèvre covering for her, complaints of stomach discomfort, that subtle rounding of her abdomen...

Now it made sense.

Ethan's hands trembled slightly.

She'd known all along.

And kept it from him.

Which raised the burning question—who was the father?
###Chapter 718

Ethan Roscente's fingers trembled slightly.

His gaze fixed on Vivian Laurent's flat abdomen as his mind raced through the timeline.

Five months ago.

The Kingdom of Eudora.

Princess Fiona Grandelle's surgery.

That secluded island.

Their passionate encounter in his memories.

All clues pointed to one undeniable truth—this child was his.

Ethan's breathing grew ragged.

He had never imagined becoming a father.

Least of all with Vivian as the mother.

"Mr. Roscente?"

The doctor's voice snapped him back to reality.

Ethan shot up from his chair, the legs scraping harshly against the floor.

"I'm going to be a father," he murmured, his voice thick with disbelief.

The medical staff exchanged uneasy glances.

"Dr. Laurent is stable now, but she needs more rest—"

Ethan barely registered the rest.

His thoughts had already drifted elsewhere.

Vivian had been avoiding him.

Her cold words.

Her sharp dismissals.

Now he understood why.

She'd been carrying this burden alone.

Assuming he'd shirk responsibility.

His fists clenched.

Never again would she face anything alone.

"Nutritionist!" He barked at his assistant by the door. "Get the best prenatal specialist immediately. And remodel the estate for pregnancy safety."

The assistant scrambled to take notes.

Ethan returned to the bedside, carefully cradling Vivian's limp hand.

Her fingers felt icy.

He rubbed gentle circles, willing warmth into her skin.

"You knew," he whispered. "Why didn't you tell me?"

Only the steady beep of monitors answered.

Outside the window, dusk settled.

Ethan's bloodshot eyes remained fixed on her face, refusing to blink.

He couldn't risk missing the moment she woke.

When Vivian's lashes finally fluttered, Ethan nearly leaped from his seat.

"Vivian!"

Joy cracked through his controlled tone.

Her eyes opened slowly, finding Ethan's face hovering inches away.

And something unfamiliar in his gaze—

A tenderness she'd never seen before.

"You—" Her dry throat caught the words.

Ethan instantly brought a glass of water, handling her like precious porcelain.

"Easy. Take your time."

His voice held an uncharacteristic softness.

Vivian froze.

This version of Ethan was entirely new.
###Chapter 719

"My throat hurts." Vivian frowned, her voice hoarse.

Ethan immediately stood to pour water.

His grip remained tight around her wrist as he handed her the thermos with perfectly warm water.

"Let go." She struggled slightly.

Ethan ignored her, unscrewing the cap one-handed and pressing the rim to her lips.

"No." His voice was strained. "Do you have any idea how terrified I was?"

The warm water soothed her throat, making her eyelids flutter in relief.

Ethan's gaze fixed on her pale lips, his Adam's apple bobbing.

The words "eight weeks pregnant" from her medical report echoed in his mind, tightening his chest.

"No more late nights." He bit back the urge to interrogate her.

Vivian arched a brow. "I'm a doctor."

"Doctors can't die from exhaustion?" His knuckles whitened around the cup. "Even gods need sleep."

She turned her face away.

Outside, the night was thick and dark. A sudden thought struck her. "Where's Theo?"

"In the ICU." Ethan's expression softened. "Thank you."

She scoffed lightly. "I did it for that 'pretty sister' comment."

"He prefers calling you 'Auntie.'" Ethan chuckled lowly.

"You taught him that?"

"Fate did." His tone turned serious. "The paternity results came back."

Vivian's breath hitched.

"Sophia isn't Theo's biological mother."

Though expected, the confirmation still sent a chill through her fingertips.

"Then his real mother..."

She thought of Theo's grape-like eyes—so unlike Sophia's viperous nature.
###Chapter 720

"We still don't know when that woman appeared by his side. I've sent people to investigate, but the trail went cold."

"I also visited Sophia Evans, but she refused to say anything. She's completely lost her mind."

Ethan Roscente's gaze softened with apology as he looked at Vivian Laurent. "Vivian, I'm sorry you had to endure so much because of this misunderstanding with Sophia."

"Let's not dwell on the past. I'm going to check on Theo."

Vivian started to rise, but Ethan held her down. "You're still recovering. The hospital staff is taking care of Theo. You need to rest and eat something first."

"I've slept enough. Look at yourself, Ethan. Have you seen a mirror lately?"

Ethan's face was pale, with dark circles under his bloodshot eyes. He looked utterly drained, as if he might collapse at any moment.

He ignored her comment and picked up a thermal container. "I had this delivered. It's still warm."

Inside were various nourishing soups—chicken, bone broth, pigeon—along with an assortment of nutritional supplements.

Vivian's appetite vanished at the sight of the greasy liquids. "I don't want any of this."

"Then what would you like? I'll have it made fresh."

"I'm not an invalid. Why all these tonics?"

"Because—"

Because you're carrying our child. The doctor said you need proper nutrition.

Ethan swallowed the words.

"Because what?" Vivian pressed.

"You fainted. The doctor said you need to replenish your strength."

Vivian sighed. "I'm not a child. I'll speak up if I'm hungry."

The smell of the rich soups alone made her nauseous.

"Then tell me what you want," Ethan insisted.

"Nothing right now. You, on the other hand, need sleep."

"I'm not tired."

"Trying to work yourself to death?"

A faint smile touched Ethan's lips at her concern. He pulled her into his arms, resting his chin on her shoulder.

"Then stay with me while I rest?"

"I need to see Theo."

"If you won't sleep, neither will I."

Vivian relented, realizing that if he collapsed, she'd have two people to care for.

"Fine. Just for a little while."
###Chapter 721

"Just a short nap." Ethan Roscente murmured as he pulled back the covers and drew Vivian Laurent into his embrace.

His arms encircled her waist with infinite care, cradling the precious life growing within her.

The five-month pregnancy bump was unmistakable now.

The moment his palm pressed against her abdomen, he felt a faint flutter.

Fetal movement.

His heartbeat accelerated instantly.

He'd noticed something unusual before, but Vivian had skillfully diverted his attention. How could he have been so oblivious?

Vivian also felt the baby's stirring.

She tensed and tried to push Ethan away. "Don't hold me like this."

Fear gripped her - what if he discovered her secret?

"Hmm?" Ethan's eyes opened, locking onto her face mere inches away.

To him, Vivian's delicate features outshone everything else in this world.

"Then how should I hold you?" His voice was husky with sleep.

"Don't hold me at all." Vivian countered.

Instead of releasing her, Ethan tightened his embrace. "No. This is perfect."

He buried his face in her hair, inhaling her unique floral scent.

Vivian sighed in resignation.

This formidable business titan transformed into an affectionate child whenever they were alone.

Knowing Ethan hadn't rested properly in days, she stopped resisting.

Sleep had been the furthest thing from Ethan's mind.

He'd been mentally listing ways to ensure Vivian ate properly and their baby stayed healthy.

But gradually, exhaustion claimed him.

He dreamed of walking hand-in-hand with Vivian and their child, a picture of domestic bliss.

Vivian thought she'd slept enough.

Yet nestled in Ethan's warmth, she drifted back into slumber without realizing.

Two hours passed before she awoke again.

Ethan remained deep in sleep, his breathing slow and even.

Vivian attempted to extricate herself carefully.

Even unconscious, Ethan's arms held her firmly.

It took considerable effort to slip away without disturbing him.

She adjusted the blankets around Ethan.

The lavish meal on the table held little appeal - she managed only a few bites.

After one last glance at the sleeping man, she tiptoed out.

It was time to check on Theo in the ICU.

She dared not hope for miracles - just that the child's condition wouldn't worsen.
###Chapter 722

The ICU lights glared harshly under the sterile ceiling.

Little Theo's frail body lay surrounded by beeping machines, his small face obscured by a translucent oxygen mask. IV tubes snaked into his delicate arms like invasive vines.

Vivian Laurent exhaled as the steady rhythm of the heart monitor finally loosened the tension in her shoulders.

"Give me the last 24-hour vitals." She extended her hand toward the resident.

The doctor handed over a tablet. Vivian's fingers flew across the screen, analyzing each data point until relief flickered in her eyes. Every indicator showed improvement.

She gently cradled Theo's hand—icy against her palm.

"Hang in there, little warrior." Her whisper barely disturbed the antiseptic air. "When you wake up, I'll take you to Disneyland."

As she turned to leave, a featherlight pressure grazed her fingertips.

The unconscious boy had curled his fingers around hers.

Vivian froze.

Protocol demanded minimal ICU visits. Yet her feet refused to move.

"Just a little longer," she murmured, settling back into the chair. A lullaby hummed from her lips, soft as a heartbeat.

Meanwhile, the global medical forum erupted.

An account named "Dr. Luna" had posted a seismic declaration:

"If she's the real Dr. Luna... then who am I?"

Seven words detonated across the internet.

"Holy shit! The actual Dr. Luna exposing an impostor?"

"So Vivian Laurent's been faking it? Knew she couldn't possibly be the legendary surgeon!"

"Hold up—Vivian never claimed to be Dr. Luna."

"Spare me the act! Her entire reputation's built on that stolen identity!"

"I've met the real Dr. Luna. Vivian's just a fame-hungry fraud!"

"Those 'miracle surgeries'? All staged by her PR team!"

The digital mob sharpened their pitchforks.

But in the ICU, Vivian's lullaby never wavered, her fingers still entwined with Theo's.
###Chapter 723

"Vivian Laurent is nothing but a fraud!" A post exploded on Eudora's late-night forums. "She's impersonating Dr. Luna to cover up killing her patient! That poor soul died under her so-called 'treatment'!"

"Vivian only cares about money!" Another comment chimed in. "I waited three months for an appointment, and she refused to see me just because I couldn't afford her outrageous fees!"

"Don't forget she stole Sophia Evans' fiancé!" A third voice added. "How could anyone forget that scandal? Someone like her shouldn't be allowed to practice medicine!"

The post skyrocketed to the top of trending within minutes.

"Bold of Vivian to impersonate Dr. Luna," read the most upvoted comment. "Now that the real one is exposing her, let's see how she wriggles out of this!"

"Pathetic. Dr. Luna is practically a ghost—does she think she can just claim that identity?"

"Can't wait to see Vivian get exposed!"

......

Annika Heilbronn smirked at the flood of hateful comments on her screen. She spoke into the phone: "Turn up the heat. Destroy her completely."

"Don't worry, Miss Heilbronn," a sycophantic voice replied. "Our professional troll team specializes in this. Remember that rival of Sophia Evans we drove to suicide last time?"

Annika nodded in satisfaction. "I want Vivian Laurent ruined."

The moment she hung up, another call came through. She deliberately let it ring three times before answering.

"Made your decision?" she asked lazily.

A trembling female voice responded: "Where are my parents?"

"That depends on you," Annika said, examining her nails. "Cooperate, and they'll be safe."

"But... I don't know anything about medicine!" The girl sounded tearful. "If I pretend to be Dr. Luna, everyone will know I'm a fraud!"

Annika's voice turned glacial. "You'll do as I say."
###Chapter 724

The ICU lights glared harshly white.

Vivian Laurent had kept vigil at Theo's bedside all night. Only when the doctors confirmed his vitals were stable did she drag her exhausted body away.

She froze when pushing open Ethan Roscente's hospital room door.

The man stood fully dressed by the entrance, his long fingers resting on the doorknob.

"Awake?" Vivian instinctively stepped back.

The anxiety in Ethan's eyes dissolved instantly. He seized her wrist. "Where were you?"

"Making rounds." Vivian tried pulling free. "Let go."

"There are monitors in this room." Ethan's gaze sharpened. "You're lying."

The 5 AM hallway stood empty.

Vivian sighed. "I went to see Theo."

"How is he?"

"Stable." She paused. "He'll probably wake tomorrow."

Suddenly Ethan bent and scooped her into his arms.

"What are you doing?" Vivian gasped.

"Sleep." He strode toward the bed. "You look terrible."

She landed gently on the mattress as his strong hand pressed her shoulder.

"I'm not tired."

"Lie down anyway." Ethan pulled up the blanket. "Hungry?"

"Crab roe soup dumplings." Vivian deliberately challenged.

Ethan frowned. "Pick something else."

"I want those."

After a silent moment, he grabbed his coat. "Wait here."

The door clicked shut.

Vivian exhaled, fishing out her phone.

Her pupils constricted the instant the screen lit up.

Dozens of unread messages flashed wildly. Social media notifications skyrocketed.

Her name topped the trending list.
###Chapter 725

Vivian Laurent's fingers tingled as she unlocked her phone, instantly bombarded by a flood of notifications.

She tapped one at random. A hateful message glared back at her.

"Vivian Laurent pretending to be Dr. Luna? Wake up, fans! If she's the real Dr. Luna, I'll livestream eating my keyboard upside down! @VivianLaurent"

"Dr. Luna herself just exposed this fraud. Why are you still simping for Vivian? @VivianLaurent"

Her brow furrowed slightly.

Scrolling down, she found a particularly bold claim: "If she's Dr. Luna, then who am I?"

The comment section erupted.

Amusement flickered across Vivian's face.

The codename "Luna" had always been derived from the character "晚" in her own name.

Now someone dared impersonate her?

Even more ridiculous—people actually believed it.

Her phone kept vibrating.

Messages poured in from Ryan Fairsprene, Nathan Clementson, Isabella Langley, and Lucas Lefèvre.

Nathan's voice message crackled with anger: "How can you tolerate this, junior? Just reveal your identity and shut them up!"

Vivian typed back: "Clarifying now would only muddy the waters further."

"But those research papers and patents bear your name!"

"Senior," she chuckled softly, "I want to see who's pulling the strings behind this."

A pause on the other end.

"Call me if you need anything."

"Thanks, senior."

Isabella's call came through immediately.

"How's the baby situation?" Isabella whispered. "Ethan Roscente hasn't found out, has she?"

Vivian's hand instinctively touched the slight swell of her abdomen.

"Not yet."

If Ethan knew, he would've stormed over already.
###Chapter 726

"How was the Queen's surgery? I've been texting you for days with no response. What kept you so busy?" Isabella Langley's voice came through the phone.

Vivian Laurent rubbed her temples. "The surgery went well, but there were complications. It's mainly about Theo..."

"What happened to Theo?"

"Sophia Evans stabbed him multiple times. He just had emergency surgery and isn't out of danger yet."

"What?!" Isabella gasped. "Is she insane? That's her own son!"

"Turns out she wasn't his biological mother after all."

Isabella fell silent, stunned by the revelation.

"Ethan Roscente seemed unaware too." Vivian gazed out the window. "I can't return until Theo's condition stabilizes."

"You must save him!" Isabella's voice trembled. "I'll take care of Finn Deross. Focus on handling things there."

The hospital door burst open.

"Viv!" Ethan strode in carrying a breakfast bag.

Vivian quickly ended the call. "What's wrong?"

"Someone's impersonating you online." He handed her his phone. "Should I issue a public statement?"

The screen displayed debates about Dr. Luna's identity.

Vivian skimmed it, unfazed. "You rushed here just for this?"

"You knew already?" Ethan frowned. "I can contact the media. The Dean and Queen Eleanor can verify—"

"Not yet." She took the breakfast bag. "I want to see what this impostor is planning."
###Chapter 727

Morning light filtered through the hospital curtains as Ethan Roscente and Vivian Laurent finished their breakfast.

Vivian changed into sterile scrubs and returned to the ICU.

The monitors displayed steady rhythms—Theo's vitals were improving.

"Twenty-four more hours of observation, and he should wake up," Vivian murmured to the nurse.

At dawn the next day, a soft beep sounded from the monitors.

Theo's eyelids fluttered open.

"Aunt...Vivian..." His voice was barely a whisper.

Vivian immediately leaned closer. "Theo! You're awake!"

Her fingers brushed his forehead, cool against his skin.

"Where...am I dead...?" Confusion clouded his gaze.

His last memory was the glint of a knife.

His mother's gentle smile as she promised to stay with him—twisting into something terrifying.

"Don't be silly. My brave boy already beat the illness." Vivian's voice was feather-soft.

Theo's eyes welled up.

"Aunt Vivian...it hurts..." His quiet sob cracked.

She checked the IV pump. "Show me where it hurts."

She couldn't hug the fragile child—only offer clinical comfort.

After adjusting the painkiller dosage, she sat back down.

"Your uncle Ethan has been waiting outside. He'll see you when you're stronger."

Theo nodded weakly, then hesitated. "My mom...she..."

Vivian's expression hardened. "Theo, does your mom treat you well?"

The boy's gaze flickered. "She's...okay..."

"Tell me the truth." Vivian clasped his small, cold hand.

A shrill alarm blared from the monitor.
###Chapter 728

Theo's eyes were red-rimmed, his small hands clutching the blanket tightly.

"She..."

Tears suddenly spilled down his cheeks like broken pearls.

"She always hits me." His voice trembled with sobs. "She pinches my arms and threatens me."

Vivian's heart clenched painfully.

"She wanted me to call Uncle Ethan to visit, but I refused. So she pinched me harder." Theo pulled up his sleeve, revealing dark bruises. "Aunt Vivian, it really hurt."

Her fingers shook as she traced the marks.

"That monster!" She gritted her teeth. "How could she hurt a child?"

"Did you tell Uncle Ethan?"

Theo shook his head, tears soaking into the sheets.

"Mom said I couldn't tell anyone, or she'd send me to an orphanage." His voice quivered. "She said Uncle Ethan wouldn't want me anymore now that he has someone new."

Vivian's chest heaved with rage.

"That's a lie!" She pulled Theo into a tight embrace. "Uncle Ethan would never abandon you."

Theo sniffled quietly against her shoulder.

"Should I tell you a story?" She gently patted his back.

"Okay." He nodded, tear droplets still clinging to his lashes.

Halfway through the tale, Vivian whispered, "Does it still hurt?"

"I'm a big boy." He straightened with childish pride. "It doesn't hurt that much."

Her nose stung with unshed tears.

After Theo fell asleep, she tiptoed out of the hospital room.

Ethan immediately approached. "How is he?"

"He woke up." Vivian took a deep breath. "But there's something you need to know."

"What is it?"

"Sophia has been abusing Theo." Her voice shook. "Beating him was routine."

Ethan's face drained of color.

"That's impossible..."

"Theo told me himself." She clenched her fists. "Those bruises are proof."

Ethan staggered back against the wall.

Suddenly, he remembered how Theo always had tears in his eyes during their visits.

Those weren't just childish whimpers—they were silent pleas for help.
###Chapter 729

"Sophia Evans is insane!" Ethan Roscente's knuckles turned white.

He never imagined a woman could be so cruel as to harm an innocent child.

Regret flooded through him like a tidal wave. He hated himself for not discovering it sooner, letting Theo endure so much pain.

"When can I see Theo?" Ethan's voice was low and strained.

"After he's transferred to the general ward," Vivian Laurent reassured him. "I promise to take good care of him."

Ethan's tense shoulders relaxed slightly. "Thank you."

"If you really want to thank me, promise me one thing." A glint of cunning flashed in Vivian's eyes.

"What is it?"

He was willing to pay any price if she asked.

Vivian twirled her pen playfully. "I'll collect later when I decide. But you must agree when the time comes."

She had already calculated—if her pregnancy couldn't be hidden, she'd use this favor to secure custody.

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

This wasn't like Vivian. She was always direct. This open-ended condition must be related to the child in her womb.

"No," he said firmly. "Unless you tell me now."

"Ethan!" Vivian slammed her hand on the table. "I saved Theo, and you won't even grant me this small request?"

When had he become so sharp?

"Ten favors, but name them now," Ethan countered, refusing to yield.

Vivian fumed.

She couldn't possibly confess unprompted.

"Get out!" She pointed at the door. "That's my condition for now."

Ethan studied her deeply.

"Fine." He turned. "I need to see Sophia anyway. She'll pay a hundredfold for what Theo suffered."

Especially after learning Sophia had abused Theo for so long, his murderous intent could no longer be contained.

Vivian said coldly, "Go ahead."

Sophia was imprisoned in a villa, surrounded by guards.

When Ethan arrived with his men, her gaze remained obsessively fixated on him.

"Here to kill me, Mr. Roscente?" She laughed manically, tears streaking down her face.

Ethan approached in silence.

Sophia looked like a beaten stray, while he remained untouchable.

"Is Theo dead?" she suddenly asked, venom gleaming in her eyes.

Ethan paused mid-step.

"Disappointed?" He smirked. "Theo will live well. You, however, will soon wish for death."

Sophia threw her head back with a crazed laugh. "What a pity. Why couldn't he die young like his worthless father?"
###Chapter 730

Blood for Blood

Ethan Roscente's knuckles turned white.

He stared at Sophia Evans' perfectly made-up face, feeling nothing but disgust.

"Did you give Theo those bruises?"

Sophia casually flipped her hair.

"Kids are tough. What's the big deal?"

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

With a flick of his wrist, four bodyguards closed in.

"What are you doing?" Sophia shrieked, stumbling backward.

Two men pinned her shoulders while the others dug their nails into the tender flesh of her inner arms.

"Agh—"

Sophia gasped in pain.

Ethan watched coldly.

"Does it hurt? Theo is only five."

Struggling to lift her head, Sophia's makeup had smeared.

"Ethan! You'd do this for some bastard—"

Her words cut off as his hand clamped around her jaw.

Leaning down, his voice dripped ice.

"Recognize this?"

From his suit pocket, he withdrew a bloodstained fruit knife.

Sophia's pupils contracted.

The blade she'd used to stab Theo.

"Three wounds." Ethan tapped the flat of the blade against her cheek. "How many should I return?"

Sophia trembled violently.

"You can't... I'm an Evans—"

Ethan suddenly smiled.

Slowly, he rolled up his sleeves.

"Don't worry. I won't kill you."

The blade flashed.

Sophia's scream pierced the air.

"First cut. For Theo's right hand."

Blood dripped down her forearm.

Ethan wiped the blade methodically.

"Second cut. For his abdomen."

Sophia collapsed, her tears streaking mascara down her face.

"I was wrong... I swear—"

Ethan looked down at her.

"Final cut."

Crouching, he pressed the tip to her chest.

"Here. Where Theo almost died."

Sophia's eyes bulged in terror.

As steel broke skin, she shattered completely.

"I raised him for five years! Five!"

Ethan paused.

Studying her twisted expression, he suddenly sheathed the knife.

"You're right."

Sophia barely had time to exhale before his next words froze her blood.

"So you'll live for five more."

Turning toward the exit, his black coat flared like dark wings.

"Three cuts a day. Until the debt's paid."
###Chapter 731

Ethan Roscente watched Sophia Evans' performance with cold detachment, his eyes devoid of emotion.

He raised his hand in signal.

A black-clad man immediately stepped forward, plunging a sharp dagger into Sophia's arm.

"Ah—!" Her shrill scream echoed through the empty mansion.

Blood trailed down her pale arm, staining the floor crimson.

A cruel smirk curled Ethan's lips. He wanted this woman to suffer—unable to live, unable to die.

"Just the first cut," he said coolly.

Sophia trembled violently, her back drenched in cold sweat.

The second blade sank into her thigh without hesitation.

"Ah!" Her legs gave way, sending her crashing to her knees.

Her once-delicate face twisted grotesquely, like crumpled paper.

"Kill me! Please, kill me!" she shrieked hysterically.

Ethan looked down at her, his gaze icy.

"Death would be too merciful."

The memory of Theo covered in blood flashed through his mind, hardening his expression.

One stab. Two. Three...

Sophia's screams gradually weakened until she collapsed unconscious.

"Take her away," Ethan ordered with disgust, turning his back.

The black-clad man dragged her out like a lifeless dog.

Silence reclaimed the mansion as if nothing had happened.

Ethan stood by the window, watching the sunlight outside.

Suddenly, he longed to see Vivian.

At the hospital, Vivian was making her rounds.

A loose strand of hair fell near her ear as she jotted down notes.

Ethan lingered at the end of the hallway, his gaze softening.

She was beautiful when focused.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow around her.

Unconsciously, his lips curved into a smile.

He remembered the ultrasound image he'd seen that day.

That tiny life, growing inside her.

He ached to rush over and gently touch her belly.

But he held back.

He wanted to hear her say it first.

"Just a little longer," Ethan murmured to himself.

Soon, he'd hear those words from her lips:

"I'm pregnant."
###Chapter 732

Vivian Laurent turned and met Ethan Roscente's burning gaze.

He leaned against the doorframe, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"I thought you went to see Sophia Evans," Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"To collect a debt," Ethan's eyes turned icy. "She hurt Theo. I returned the favor."

"Is she still alive?"

"Barely," he said casually. "She'll spend the rest of her life in a hospital bed."

Vivian nodded and returned to organizing her research data.

During dinner, breaking news exploded across the internet.

A young woman named Zoe Chamberlain claimed to be Dr. Luna in a high-profile press conference.

Dressed in white with a saccharine smile, she announced, "I'm a medical student from Canada, born into a family of physicians. But you may know me better as Dr. Luna."

The public went wild.

"Oh my god! The real genius is finally here!"

"That fraud Vivian Laurent should crawl back into hiding!"

"Zoe is gorgeous and kind—this is what a true miracle doctor looks like!"

Zoe generously offered, "For complex cases, contact my assistant. I'll consider taking them."

Wealthy socialites scrambled for her attention.

The most desperate was Mrs. Delmonico, who'd suffered chronic migraines for years without relief.

"Money is no object! Just get me an appointment with Dr. Luna!" she ordered her butler.

Meanwhile, Zoe trembled in a dressing room.

Her manager handed her water. "Relax. If the real Dr. Luna wanted to expose you, she would've done it by now."

"But—"

"No buts!" The manager hissed. "The surgical plans are ready. Just follow them."

Zoe stared at her reflection, forcing the perfectly rehearsed smile she'd practiced a thousand times.
###Chapter 733 

Zoe Chamberlain fled from the media frenzy, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead.

She pushed open the lounge door and froze mid-step.

A strange woman lounged on the sofa.

The woman crossed her legs, tapping crimson nails rhythmically against the armrest.

"Who are you?" Zoe's voice trembled.

Annika Heilbronn lifted her head slowly, lips curling into an eerie smile.

Zoe suddenly found the face hauntingly familiar.

"You're... Vivian Laurent?" The name escaped her lips before she could stop it.

Annika's expression darkened instantly.

"I resemble that bitch?" She sprang to her feet. "Then tell me - who's prettier?"

Zoe retreated until her back hit the door.

She recalled the photos of Vivian circulating online, then studied the twisted face before her.

"I-I don't know Vivian..."

"Liar!" Annika whipped out a silver pistol. "Answer me. Who's more beautiful?"

Cold metal pressed against Zoe's temple.

"You! Of course you!" Zoe's voice shook. "Vivian can't compare..."

Annika's pupils contracted slightly.

"Really?" She leaned closer. "Elaborate."

The pungent perfume assaulted Zoe's senses.

"Your eyes... like gemstones..." she stammered. "And your skin..."

Annika burst into sudden laughter.

The laughter cut off abruptly.

"Recognize me now?" She gripped Zoe's chin.

Zoe's pupils dilated.

"You're the one who made me impersonate Dr. Luna..."

"Clever girl." Annika released her. "Your parents remain unharmed."

Zoe's nails dug into her palms.

"What do you want?"

Madness flickered in Annika's eyes.

"I want Vivian ruined!" She yanked Zoe's collar. "Why does she get everything?"

Zoe gasped for air.

"Keep playing Dr. Luna." Annika whispered against her ear. "Or else..."

She drew a finger across her throat.

Zoe trembled violently.

"Remember," Annika turned toward the exit. "Next time, I expect more... poetic compliments."
###Chapter 734

Zoe Chamberlain's wrist ached from the crushing grip. Annika Heilbronn's eyes gleamed like venomous snakes.

"Will you do it?" Annika's whisper was feather-light yet sent tremors down Zoe's spine.

Zoe nodded frantically, throat constricting. "I...I'll do it..."

Only then did Annika release her. Zoe collapsed onto the sofa, gasping for air.

"How?" Her voice shook.

Annika opened a laptop, the blue glow illuminating her sharp features. "Mrs. Delmonico. Political royalty. She's been suffering from migraines. You'll cure her."

Zoe's pulse spiked. The society matron's mysterious condition was legendary in medical circles—countless specialists had failed.

"But I might not—"

"No mights." Annika cut her off. "You will succeed."

The clatter of keystrokes pierced the silence. Annika had already accepted the appointment on her behalf.

"You go tomorrow. Succeed, and we gain access to her circle."

When Zoe opened her mouth to protest, Annika's glare silenced her.

"Remember," Annika leaned in, breath hot against Zoe's ear, "fail, and your family disappears."

Zoe trembled, recalling the skinned cat left on her doorstep last night.

"My skills aren't—"

"From now on, you're Dr. Luna." Annika tossed her a flash drive. "Everything's in there."

At the door, Annika turned with a chilling smile. "No tricks. I know which preschool your daughter attends."

The moment the door clicked shut, Zoe crumpled to the floor. She remembered those unnervingly steady hands in the surgical videos—the real Dr. Vivian Laurent's hands.

Why did it have to be her impersonating the legendary physician?

The Delmonico mansion blazed with light. By the time the butler led Zoe down the hallway, her blouse clung to her damp back.

"Dr. Luna!" Mrs. Delmonico swept forward, arms outstretched. "I can't believe you came!"

Zoe dug her nails into her palms. The title pricked like needles.

"Please, call me Zoe." She forced a smile.

Mrs. Delmonico's perfectly arched brows lifted. "But Luna's your professional moniker, no?"

The chandelier's glare made Zoe's vision swim.

"I...prefer my given name."

With a thoughtful hum, Mrs. Delmonico guided her toward the study. Framed accolades from prestigious hospitals covered the walls—all addressed to the real Dr. Luna.

Zoe's knees buckled. She barely caught herself from collapsing.
###Chapter 735

"That won't do. You're Night, so I'll call you Night." Madeline Delmonico stubbornly insisted on the title.

Zoe Chamberlain sighed helplessly, reluctantly accepting it for now.

"Mrs. Delmonico, do you have recent medical reports? I'd like to review them first." Zoe asked softly.

Madeline immediately instructed the butler, "Bring last month's medical examination results."

The butler soon returned with a thick stack of documents.

"My headaches are chronic, worsening over the past two years." Madeline massaged her temples. "If Night can cure me, name your price."

Zoe forced a smile. "I'll do my best."

She carefully examined the reports, her frown deepening.

The results showed Madeline was in perfect health—even better than most her age.

This was strange.

After reviewing them three times, Zoe found no possible cause for the headaches.

"Night, what's your diagnosis?" Madeline asked eagerly.

Zoe's palms grew clammy. "Further tests are needed. Let's go to the hospital for a full examination."

At the hospital, Zoe personally conducted a comprehensive evaluation.

"Well? Can you treat it?" Madeline pressed urgently.

Staring at the perfectly normal results, Zoe swallowed hard. "It's treatable, but requires a detailed plan."

Madeline's eyes lit up. "As expected of Night! Other doctors said it was hopeless."

"I'll prescribe pain relief medication first." Zoe maintained her composure.

After leaving, Zoe immediately called Annika Heilbronn.

"Mrs. Delmonico isn't sick at all. I found nothing wrong." Zoe whispered tensely. "Now she wants painkillers. What do I do?"

Annika chuckled. "Simple. I'll give you a special medication."

"What kind of miracle drug is this?" Zoe asked skeptically.

Annika's voice turned sly. "Morphine."

Zoe gasped.

She knew exactly what morphine was—a powerful, addictive narcotic.
###Chapter 736

The doorbell rang as Zoe Chamberlain paced anxiously across the living room.

Her footsteps halted abruptly, fingers trembling slightly.

A courier handed her a small sealed package when she opened the door.

Zoe's pupils constricted at the address label. That woman even knew her exact apartment number.

Inside the package lay several vials of clear liquid.

She immediately dialed Annika Heilbronn. "This is morphine! It's a controlled substance!"

A mocking laugh came through the phone. "Illegal? I've committed more crimes than you've had hot meals."

"They'll revoke my medical license!" Zoe's voice shook.

"Oh?" Annika drawled. "Should I let your parents sample it too? Imagine two university professors begging me on their knees for their next fix..."

"Shut up!"

"Three days." The line went dead. "Either Madeline Delmonico or your parents."

The veins on Zoe's hand bulged as she clenched the vials.

——

Her fingers turned icy when she handed the medication to Madeline Delmonico in the Delmonico mansion.

"A special painkiller." Zoe avoided the older woman's gaze.

Madeline swallowed the pill without hesitation. "Anything Dr. Luna recommends must be trustworthy."

"Wait!" Zoe's protest died in her throat.

"What is it?"

"N-nothing."

The drug took effect rapidly.

Madeline clutched Zoe's hand in delight. "My headache's gone! Dr. Luna, you're a miracle worker!"

Zoe forced a smile.

Her stomach churned as she watched Madeline's euphoric expression.

This wasn't medicine.

It was poison.

And Madeline Delmonico was happily marching toward her own destruction.
###Chapter 737

Vivian Laurent never expected the impostor would dare continue practicing medicine.

She initially wanted to ignore such a clownish fraud.

But witnessing more patients being deceived became unbearable.

"I am the real Dr. Luna," Vivian declared on her social media account.

"Though I've kept a low profile all these years, I never imagined someone would impersonate me so brazenly."

The post instantly went viral.

Since Dr. Luna never had an official account, Vivian had to speak out through her personal profile.

Comments erupted immediately.

"Vivian finally responded? So who's the real Dr. Luna?"

"Zoe Chamberlain seems more credible—she even gave media interviews."

"Dr. Laurent, do you have proof of your identity?"

Vivian found these comments laughable.

If people blindly believed anyone claiming to be Dr. Luna, the world had truly gone mad.

She posted another warning:

"Stay vigilant. Don't trust impostors. No one will compensate you if you're deceived."

Soon after, Capital Hospital issued an official statement:

"Dr. Vivian Laurent is indeed the internationally renowned medical expert Dr. Luna, serving as our special consultant."

Yet two prominent hospitals simultaneously countered:

"We've never heard of Vivian Laurent. Zoe Chamberlain is the real Dr. Luna."

This was clearly Annika Heilbronn's doing.

With her influence, bribing two hospitals was effortless.

Public opinion descended into chaos again.

"Capital Hospital is elite, but the other two are reputable too!"

"I stand with Vivian—she's treated countless complex cases."

"Zoe focuses on medical research while Vivian just does routine consultations."

"Maybe both are fakes?"

Nathan Clementson immediately defended his junior:

"I can confirm Vivian is Dr. Luna herself."

His statement only invited more attacks.

"Oh sure, and I'm Dr. Luna's father!"

"Paid trolls for Vivian? Disgusting."

"Her claiming to be Dr. Luna? Hilarious."

The battle intensified, leaving the truth about Dr. Luna in deadlock.
###Chapter 738
Unpleasant Parting

Annika Heilbronn's hired internet trolls stirred up a storm online.

A tidal wave of vicious insults flooded toward Vivian Laurent.

Liam Valdemar learned of this development almost immediately.

He called Vivian at once, his voice laced with concern. "Shadow, I've seen what's happening online."

Vivian responded calmly. "Just some pathetic attention-seekers."

"Let me deal with that woman," Liam's tone turned icy. "One bullet. Permanent solution."

"Liam!" Vivian frowned. "We live in a society governed by law, not the organization."

"But she's hurting you!" His voice rose sharply.

Vivian sighed. "Killing her would only complicate things further."

Liam's knuckles turned white from gripping the phone.

Fury burned through him with no outlet.

"What about that Ethan Roscente?" Liam suddenly changed tack. "He can't even protect his own woman!"

"What does he have to do with this?" Vivian sounded genuinely puzzled.

Liam scoffed. "A real man would shield what's his."

"Liam!" Vivian's voice turned stern. "This is my personal matter."

Silence stretched between them for several seconds.

"Fine. I won't interfere." Liam bit out the words before ending the call.

He hurled his phone against the wall with violent force.

The screen shattered instantly.

Liam's chest heaved with ragged breaths.

Memories surfaced of countless arguments with Vivian back in their organization days.

He always advocated decisive action.

She insisted on measured responses.

"Sentimental fool!" His fist smashed into the wall.

Plaster dust rained down.

That Zoe Chamberlain was clearly Annika's pawn.

One word from Vivian.

He could make the woman disappear within minutes.

Yet Vivian stubbornly chose the most convoluted approach.

Liam's eyes darkened like a hunting hawk's.

He pulled out a second phone.

Dialed a familiar number.

"Keep close surveillance on Zoe Chamberlain."
###Chapter 739

The call ended abruptly.

He immediately dialed Annika's number.

She picked up with her usual swiftness.

"Master Zero!" Her voice bubbled with barely contained excitement.

"Do you have instructions for me?" Her tone grew noticeably brighter.

"How are you handling the Zoe Chamberlain situation?"

A sudden silence filled the line for a full second.

"Master... I don't quite understand." Annika's voice turned cautious.

"You think you can hide things from me?"

Her breath hitched audibly.

"Master, I was wrong!" She rushed to apologize. "If this displeases you, I'll stop immediately. I just... thought you seemed displeased with Vivian..."

Her words trailed off into a mumble, carrying a performative note of grievance rather than genuine remorse.

"Continue."

Annika froze.

"I... wasn't planning anything major." She tentatively outlined her scheme.

Only a quiet hum responded through the phone.

"You're not angry?"

"Why would I be?"

Her pulse accelerated. Was her master tacitly approving her actions?

"You're the best, Master! I adore you!" The words burst from her lips before she could stop them.

"Never say such things again."

Her heart plummeted.

"But why, Master..."

"Have you forgotten the rules?"

"N-no." Her voice trembled.

First rule of their organization: Absolute obedience. No questions asked.

The call disconnected abruptly. Annika clutched her phone, thoughts churning.

Her master's attitude toward Vivian was perplexing. He seemed to despise her, yet...

This worked to her advantage. As long as her master no longer favored Vivian...

The online storm intensified.

Queen Eleanor personally stepped forward to endorse Vivian, declaring her the true Dr. Luna.

"My daughter's health improved solely through Dr. Laurent's exceptional skills."

The Queen deliberately omitted Fiona's facial disfigurement, citing only general health concerns.

"Even the child I carry owes its wellbeing to Dr. Laurent. Henceforth, any enemy of hers is an enemy of the Eudoran royal family."

Her statement carried undeniable weight.

But Annika had prepared for this. She'd mobilized several influential society matrons to champion Zoe's cause.

"My chronic condition was cured by Zoe Chamberlain—she's the real Dr. Luna."

These women owed Annika favors, now conveniently called due.
###Chapter 740

The battle between Vivian Laurent and Zoe Chamberlain over the true identity of Dr. Luna intensified. Every time Vivian presented evidence, Zoe would immediately counter with fabricated proofs of her own.

The situation grew increasingly absurd. Vivian initially wanted to ignore it, but the imposter's relentless provocations became impossible to overlook.

Isabella Langley voiced her concern. "Viv, you need to prove you're Dr. Luna immediately. More people are contacting Zoe by the day. She's definitely plotting something."

"I'll handle it." Vivian's eyes turned icy. "Investigate who's backing Zoe. This media frenzy is moving too fast to be organic."

Worried about potential victims, Vivian logged into the Medical Summit forum. She posted irrefutable evidence: screenshots of published papers, backend login records, experimental data, and documented surgical cases performed under her Dr. Luna identity.

Predictably, Zoe soon released her own "research records" and fabricated credentials. Though Vivian instantly recognized them as forgeries, netizens struggled to tell truth from fiction.

"This is more dramatic than a Shakespeare play!"

"At this point, I just want to know who the real Dr. Luna is."

"I'm team Vivian. Zoe's clearly copying her."

"Zoe raised doubts first. She seems more credible."

Public opinion became increasingly polarized.

Vivian issued a direct challenge. "Since someone claims to be Dr. Luna, let's settle this with medical skill. A public simulated surgery will reveal the truth."

"No problem," Zoe responded immediately.

Privately, Zoe panicked. "Annika, have you lost your mind? I can't possibly compete with Dr. Luna!"

"You're a doctor too. What's there to fear?"

"Dr. Luna's a prodigy! I'm just average!" Zoe trembled uncontrollably. "I'll be exposed!"

Annika Heilbronn smirked. "Relax. She won't make it to the venue. Absence means forfeiture. Public opinion will side with you then."

She'd already devised a plan. If Vivian couldn't be touched directly, her loved ones would make excellent targets. Any injury among them would force Vivian to divide her attention.

Thinking of how Master Zero would assist her, Annika's lips curled into a sinister smile.
###Chapter 741

Madeline Delmonico had been restless lately.

Since the scandal about the real and fake Dr. Luna had swept through high society, she began doubting whether Zoe Chamberlain, the doctor treating her, was truly the renowned miracle physician.

Zoe's last prescription had worked.

Those black pills miraculously cured her chronic migraines.

But the ease of her relief only made her more uneasy.

"Dr. Luna, how much longer should I take these?" Madeline's fingers trembled slightly as she held the phone.

Zoe's calm voice responded, "Continue the medication. I'll arrange follow-up treatments."

"Understood. Thank you."

Hanging up, Madeline massaged her temples.

At least the headaches were gone.

As for that young girl Vivian Laurent—she was clearly an impostor.

Vivian stood by the hospital window, sunlight spilling over her shoulders.

Zoe had to be working with someone.

No one could orchestrate such an elaborate scheme alone.

But what was the point of impersonating Dr. Luna?

The question gnawed at her.

"Auntie!"

Theo's bright voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

The boy had been moved to a general ward, grinning at her from his bed.

Ethan Roscente stood on the other side, exhaustion lining his bloodshot eyes.

"Does it still hurt?" He gripped Theo's small hand, voice rough.

Theo shook his head. "Not when you and Auntie are here."

Though pale, his eyes had regained some spark.

"Silly boy." Vivian gently ruffled his hair. "Get well soon."

Theo suddenly looked down.

"Uncle..." He hesitated. "Mom, she..."

At the mention of Sophia Evans, the air in the room turned heavy.

Ethan's knuckles whitened.

"Mom didn't mean it," Theo rushed to explain. "I made her angry..."

His innocence was heartbreaking.

Vivian exchanged a glance with Ethan.

"Uncle, Mom's all alone." Theo's eyes glistened. "Please don't blame her?"

The child didn't know.

The woman he desperately defended wasn't his real mother.
###Chapter 742

"Theo!"

Ethan Roscente's expression darkened instantly. "She was never your biological mother."

Vivian Laurent whirled to face Ethan, shock flashing in her eyes.

She hadn't expected him to reveal the truth at this critical moment. Theo had just been discharged from ICU and was still emotionally dependent on Sophia Evans. Could he handle such a devastating blow?

Vivian subtly nudged Ethan's arm with her elbow, signaling him to stop.

Tears still clung to Theo's lashes. "W-what do you mean?"

How could Mom not be his mom?

"Did Sophia ever hit you? Force you to do things against your will? Threaten to abandon you? Tell you nobody wanted you?"

Theo's tears overflowed. "N-no."

"Theodore Evans! Look at me and answer properly—did she or didn't she?"

Ethan rarely lost his temper, especially with Theo.

Being addressed by his full name always made Theo tremble with fear.

He didn't know how to respond. His uncle's piercing gaze terrified him, making fresh tears well up.

Vivian gripped Ethan's arm. "You're scaring him."

Ethan had his reasons. Without pressing hard, Theo would never speak his truth—only swallow his pain silently.

He refused to let Theo become submissive. The boy needed to learn self-protection.

"Answer me!"

Theo finally broke down sobbing. "Y-yes... Mom would pinch my thighs... Said she hit me because I wasn't good enough... Threatened to abandon me if I told anyone..."

Ethan's knuckles turned white.

Hearing those words from Theo hurt more than any blade.

He wiped Theo's tears. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

"Mom... Mom said not to..."

"She's not your mother!" Ethan declared firmly. "You share no blood relation with Sophia Evans. I only recently discovered she wasn't your birth mother."

Theo froze, tears suspended on his cheeks.

"Then... who is my mom?"

"I'll find out," Ethan said with resolve. "From today onward, you don't have to obey her or call her Mom again."

Theo's mind reeled in chaos.

How could the woman he'd called Mom for years not be his mother?

Recognizing the situation's volatility, Vivian pulled Ethan aside. "Let Theo process this alone. He just left critical care."

She quietly closed the door, leaving the boy to grapple with this brutal truth.
###Chapter 743

Vivian pulled Ethan out of the hospital room and shut the door behind them.

Her voice dropped to a hushed whisper. "Ethan, have you lost your mind? Theo just had surgery. He's emotionally fragile right now."

Ethan's gaze drifted past her to the closed door. His voice was low. "He needs to know the truth. He keeps blaming himself for Sophia's mistakes. That kind of guilt will destroy him."

"But he's only five!" Vivian clenched her fists. "How do you expect him to process that the woman he's called 'Mom' for five years isn't his real mother—and nearly killed him?"

Ethan turned to face her fully. His eyes were steel. "That's exactly why he needs to know now. I won't let him grow up trying to please someone who never deserved to be called his mother."

Vivian bit her lower lip. Her hand instinctively moved to her abdomen, where new life stirred. If her child one day asked about their father, what would she say?

Ethan's gaze followed the movement. Suddenly, he pulled her into a crushing embrace.

"What are you—" She struggled, but his arms were unyielding.

"Vivian." His chin rested atop her head. "Not all parents are as heartless as Sophia. If I had a child, I'd love them with every breath in my body."

She went rigid. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears. "What...what are you saying?"

His arms tightened like he wanted to fuse them together. "I'm saying neither you nor our child will ever be alone again. From this moment on, I'll protect you both."

Vivian shoved him away, her face pale. "You know?"

Ethan didn't answer directly. He gently wiped the cold sweat from her temple. "Theo needs you. I need you. No matter what happens, the three of us are family now."

The hallway lights cast deep shadows in his eyes. For the first time, Vivian realized this man understood her far better than she'd ever imagined.
###Chapter 744

Vivian's ears flushed pink as she turned her face away. "I don't need your care."

"Then let's take care of Theo together?"

"In your dreams!"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "What if Theo hears you say that—"

"I'll take care of Theo myself," Vivian interrupted. "But that has nothing to do with you."

"Nothing to do with me?" Ethan leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Auntie?"

Vivian clenched her fists. "Say that again and see what happens."

"Go ahead." His smirk was infuriating.

She seethed.

This man was clearly out of his mind.

Pushing him away, she said, "Theo needs you right now. Focus on him."

"And what about you?" Ethan pressed.

"I have things to do."

She calculated the days—her prenatal checkup was approaching. Getting examined in Eudora was safest, with Queen Eleanor providing cover. Ethan must never find out.

"What things?"

"None of your business."

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

Her evasiveness only confirmed his suspicions about the baby.

"Fine. Go ahead." He feigned indifference.

Vivian hurried off toward the queen's chambers.

"Your Majesty, could you arrange a prenatal exam for me?"

The queen gasped, clasping her hands. "Oh my! Congratulations!"

"Thank you. I...I want to keep this child."

"Leave it to me!" The queen immediately summoned the medical team.

Only after confirming Ethan was occupied with Theo did Vivian feel safe heading to the hospital.

She didn't notice Ethan silently trailing behind.

His chest tightened.

She planned to hide this from him indefinitely.

"The fetus is healthy," the doctor's voice carried from the examination room. "Already five months along."

Ethan pressed against the door, his pulse racing.

Five more months until he could meet their little one.

"Excellent development," the doctor pointed at the screen. "See those tiny hands..."

Vivian's laughter sparkled. "So precious."

Ethan's throat constricted.

How he longed to see their child's face.

Would the baby resemble her more? Or him?

Boy or girl—it would be their greatest treasure.
###Chapter 745

Vivian Laurent finished her last prenatal checkup in the examination room. She adjusted her clothes and gently caressed her rounded belly, a soft smile unconsciously curving her lips.

Ethan Roscente stood at the corner of the hallway, watching her through the glass window from a distance. As soon as he confirmed she was about to leave, he turned and quickly returned to Theo's hospital room.

"Uncle Ethan, why are you back?" Theo looked up from the building blocks he was playing with on the bed, blinking in surprise.

Ethan pressed a finger to his lips. "Remember, if Aunt Vivian asks, tell her I've been here with you the whole time."

Theo nodded obediently, his large eyes full of innocence.

Vivian pushed the door open, exhaustion lingering on her face after the checkup. She sat by the bed and chatted gently with Theo for a while.

"Theo, let me talk to you alone for a moment." Vivian glanced at Ethan, signaling for him to step out.

Without protest, Ethan left the room and closed the door softly behind him.

"Was Uncle Ethan really here the whole time?" Vivian lowered her voice.

Remembering his uncle's instruction, Theo answered without hesitation. "Yes, he stayed with me."

Vivian exhaled, her tense shoulders relaxing slightly. She planned to leave Eudora quietly when her pregnancy reached six or seven months, retreating to her private villa to prepare for the birth.

Outside the room, Ethan leaned against the wall, his gaze dark and unreadable.

When Vivian emerged, he feigned nonchalance. "What was so secretive?"

"Nothing." She avoided his eyes. "Theo's recovering well. You should go rest."

Ethan smirked. "Worried about me?"

"Don't flatter yourself." She rolled her eyes. "I just don't want you collapsing and blaming me."

"Relax, I'm in perfect health." His smile faded. "I booked a hotel nearby. Want to come?"

"I'm going back to the palace." She stifled a yawn. "All I want right now is sleep."

Ethan didn't press further. They walked side by side out of the hospital.

At the entrance, his phone rang. The caller ID showed it was the bodyguard assigned to monitor Sophia Evans.

"Mr. Roscente, Ms. Evans insists on seeing you," the bodyguard said, sounding uneasy.

"Denied." Ethan's voice was icy.

"She claims... someone ordered her to harm Theo. That the weapon was provided to her."

Ethan's eyes sharpened. "Who gave the order?"

"She refuses to say. Demands to tell you in person."

"Then let her rot in prison." He ended the call abruptly.

Vivian glanced at him curiously. "What did Sophia want?"

"She says someone instructed her to hurt Theo." Ethan scoffed. "Who knows if it's another one of her schemes."

Vivian gazed into the distance, sunlight casting shadows across her delicate profile as she fell into thought.
###Chapter 746

Ethan Roscente's trust in Sophia Evans had long vanished.

In his eyes, no one but Sophia would harm Theo.

He had intended to drive Vivian Laurent home, but she declined.

The next morning, they headed to the hospital together.

As soon as they arrived, Ethan's phone rang again—his bodyguard calling.

"Sophia again?" Ethan frowned.

Was she still trying to force a meeting?

He had made it clear yesterday—he wouldn't see her.

"Mr. Roscente, something's happened," the bodyguard said urgently. "Sophia Evans is dead."

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply.

"What happened?"

The bodyguard stammered through an explanation—Sophia's body had been found cold during the morning meal delivery.

"Everything was normal last night. There was just a brief power outage for a few minutes. We checked the circuits and restored power quickly. Sophia was fine then. But this morning..."

It was too suspicious.

Sophia's death meant nothing to him, but dying under such mysterious circumstances...

"I'm on my way." Ethan hung up.

Just yesterday, Sophia had claimed someone was manipulating her and begged to see him.

Now she was dead overnight.

The two events had to be connected.

"What's wrong?" Vivian noticed his tension.

"Sophia Evans is dead," Ethan said grimly.

Vivian paled. "I'm coming with you."

Too many people had died recently.

Sophia Sherwood. Bianca Semona's parents. And now Sophia Evans.

In the car, Vivian frowned. "With so many guards, how could—"

"There was a power outage last night," Ethan tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Something's off."

The basement of the villa.

Sophia's body remained in the position she'd been found.

Her eyes were closed, her face twisted in agony.

"Mr. Roscente." A bodyguard bowed respectfully.

"Find anything?"

"No wounds. The surveillance footage shows nothing unusual."

Vivian carefully examined the body and the room.

The only exit had been guarded. No outsider could have gotten in.
###Chapter 747

Vivian Laurent pulled on gloves and bent over Sophia Evans' lifeless body.

"Initial assessment indicates poisoning." She glanced up at Ethan Roscente. "We'll need lab tests to identify the exact toxin."

"Poison?" Ethan's brow furrowed. "Where would she get poison?"

"Our facilities here are limited." Vivian removed her gloves. "We should call the police. Let the forensic team handle this."

Sirens soon pierced the night air.

The forensic unit worked efficiently, conducting a thorough examination of the corpse.

"No visible external injuries," the forensic examiner reported to Ethan. "We'll need toxicology analysis at the lab."

Officers collected blood samples and stomach contents.

Two hours later, the results came in.

"Detected lethal toxins in the bloodstream." The examiner pointed at the report. "Undigested pill fragments in the stomach."

Ethan's fist slammed against the wall.

"Impossible!" His voice turned hoarse. "She had nothing on her during the search. If she wanted to harm Theo, she would've acted sooner."

Vivian studied the report intently.

"During the power outage..." she murmured. "Someone came in."

Both recalled Sophia's dying words simultaneously.

The surveillance footage played on loop, showing only static images.

"My fault." Ethan's knuckles whitened. "Should've interrogated her yesterday."

Vivian shook her head. "Whoever silenced her wouldn't leave evidence."

Her hand suddenly gripped Ethan's arm.

"Zoe Chamberlain!" Vivian's eyes brightened. "She might be connected to the same person."

Ethan's pupils contracted.

"I'll find Zoe." His tone brooked no argument. "Controlled people crave freedom most."

But Vivian looked troubled. "She's completely under their influence now."

Their gazes fell on the autopsy table in shared silence.

Sophia's pale fingers curled slightly, as if pointing toward an unseen truth.
###Chapter 748

Vivian tacitly approved Ethan's actions.

She searched Sophia's room alone.

Poisoning took time. Why had Sophia left no clues?

Why hadn't she even cried for help?

Something felt off to Vivian.

Kneeling, she spotted faint marks on the floor.

The character "Lu," followed by an incomplete "Ri."

Like an unfinished name.

Ethan approached. "Was she writing your name?"

"Seems so." Vivian frowned.

Why would Sophia write her name before dying?

The search yielded nothing as night fell.

Ethan escorted Vivian back to the palace. "Rest. I'll update you with any leads."

Vivian sent a group message.

Isabella replied: "?"

Lucas: "?"

Finn: "Master, did your love rival die?"

"Fuck off." Vivian instantly replied.

During the video call, she voiced her suspicions.

"Feels like an invisible hand is orchestrating everything."

"Sophia's death, Zoe's appearance—they all seem targeted at me."

"Isabella, dig deeper into Bianca's parents' deaths."

Individually they seemed accidental. Together—suspicious.

Who had that kind of power?

Finn interjected, "Only someone highly placed could plan this."

"Think—when did these events start?"

The question struck Vivian.

Sophia Sherwood's death. Bianca's parents' deaths...

All began after Liam appeared.

Liam certainly had the capability.

Vivian's heart sank.
###Chapter 749

The name sent a chill down Vivian Laurent's spine.

To her, Liam Valdemar had once been a beacon in the darkness.

When the organization captured her as a child, he was the one who shielded her from deadly missions.

Whenever she was bullied, he always appeared in time. Those warm hands had pulled her back from despair countless times.

But now...

Bianca Semona's parents were complete strangers to him. Why would he kill them?

Unless it involved Sophia Sherwood or Sophia Evans...

Vivian's fingers turned icy. Liam had asked her more than once: "Do you want me to eliminate those nuisances for you?"

With his skills, he could certainly make murders look like accidents.

Yet this was the answer she dreaded most.

After the group chat ended, Vivian immediately messaged Isabella Langley.

"Track Liam's recent movements."

Isabella understood instantly. "You suspect him?"

"Who else could pull this off without leaving traces?" Vivian's hands trembled as she typed. "It takes professional training."

"Got it. I'll investigate immediately."

Liam's whereabouts weren't hard to trace. Records showed he'd been active in Canada recently.

He had a solid alibi for Bianca's parents' murder.

Isabella soon reported back: "He has alibis for all cases except Sophia Sherwood's. Sophia Evans' case is impossible—he never left the country."

Vivian exhaled in relief.

"Good. It's not him."

She didn't know how she'd face Liam if he were the killer.

The world needed order. No one had the right to take lives indiscriminately.

Isabella suddenly suggested, "Could it be someone close to him? He has extensive connections in the organization."

"Unlikely." Vivian shook her head. "The organization's hunting him. He wouldn't take that risk."

She paused. "Though..."

"Though what?"

"He supposedly has a protégé. But I've never met them."

Isabella immediately dug deeper.

The organization's records were notoriously secure. This apprentice codenamed "Summer" had all traces meticulously erased.

All evidence indicated she was still overseas on missions.

"Hit a dead end." Isabella sounded frustrated.

Vivian stared at the screen. "Leave it for now. New cases might provide fresh leads."

Night deepened as she gazed out the window.

Was the boy who once protected her truly uninvolved in these murders?
###Chapter 750

Sophia Evans' death remained shrouded in mystery.

No witnesses could account for what happened during those few minutes of power outage.

Vivian Laurent reviewed the surveillance footage repeatedly, confirming no one had infiltrated the scene.

With the security system intact, the homicide case grew increasingly perplexing.

Though Sophia had deserved punishment, the bizarre nature of her demise unsettled Vivian.

"Should we tell Theo?" Vivian looked at Ethan Roscente.

Despite having revealed Theo's true parentage, how could they explain Sophia's sudden death?

Ethan's brow furrowed. "Let's keep it from him for now. That boy feels too deeply—knowing the truth would only hurt him."

Vivian nodded quietly.

Yet news spread like wildfire.

As a former A-list celebrity, Sophia's death instantly dominated headlines nationwide.

"Sophia Evans committed suicide? How shocking!"

"Such a waste—she was so beautiful."

"Was it suicide or murder? The autopsy reportedly shows poisoning?"

"Could Vivian Laurent be responsible? They were enemies."

"Vivian's the prime suspect. Police should investigate!"

These pointed accusations bore Annika Heilbronn's fingerprints.

She had hired internet trolls to manipulate public opinion, deliberately smearing Vivian's reputation.

Media outlets scrambled to cover the celebrity homicide.

The hospital room lay silent.

Ethan opened the door to find Theo sobbing before the television screen.

News of Sophia's death played on loop.

Ethan's chest tightened.

He hadn't anticipated Theo learning the truth this way.

"Uncle Ethan..." Theo choked out between tears, "Is she... really gone?"

Ethan sighed. "Yes. Someone poisoned her. By the time—"

"How could this happen..."

Vivian approached the bed. "Theo, though she wasn't your birth mother, she was part of your life. Everyone faces consequences for their actions. Perhaps this was her fate."
###Chapter 751

Theo bit his lip and nodded, his eyes rimmed red. He understood the finality of death, yet couldn't reconcile how someone who'd been his "mother" for years could vanish just like that.

Vivian Laurent pulled him into her embrace, fingers gently stroking his trembling back.

"Her love will always stay with you. Your uncle and I will cherish you twice as much."

Theo buried his face in her shoulder, tears soaking through the fabric.

Ethan Roscente had doubled security outside the hospital ward. Seeing Theo's gradual recovery eased some of the weight in his chest.

Queen Eleanor's pregnancy progressed smoothly, the fetus developing well. In two more months, the royal family would welcome their newest member.

Vivian packed her luggage, preparing to return home. Zoe Chamberlain, the impostor posing as Dr. Luna, needed to be dealt with swiftly before she caused more harm.

Ethan pressed a hand against her suitcase. "Zoe's background is suspiciously clean. This reeks of a trap."

"Even if it's the devil's den, I'm going in." Vivian snapped the locks shut. "I won't let her hurt anyone else."

Ethan hesitated. He wanted to remind her of the risks during pregnancy, and his deeper fear—that someone might target their unborn child.

"I know my limits." Vivian lifted her bag. "No one's born yet who can take me down."

As the plane pierced through clouds, Ethan dialed Felix Valdemar's number.

Felix arrived at the hospital disheveled. "What happened to Theo? Your call sounded urgent—"

"Stay with him." Ethan fastened his suit buttons. "Bring him home once he's fit for long flights."

"Hey! You—"

Theo's soft voice calling "Uncle Felix" instantly deflated his protest.

"Let's get ice cream, champ."

......

Annika Heilbronn stood in Liam's lab, watching blue liquid swirl inside a test tube.

"Master Zero, a plane crash makes the perfect accident." She rotated the vial. "No evidence survives the ashes."
###Chapter 752

"The plane is too crowded."

Liam Valdemar's fingers tapped lightly on the armrest. He did entertain the thought of destroying Vivian Laurent if he couldn't have her, but sacrificing so many lives was excessive.

The strangers' fates meant nothing to him. Yet Vivian's words echoed in his mind—life shouldn't be taken lightly.

"A crowded flight is the perfect opportunity, Master Zero. It's a gift from fate!"

Annika Heilbronn's eyes glittered with excitement. Though young, her hands were already stained with blood.

Trained by Zero himself, she'd inherited his ruthlessness perfectly. Years in the organization had taught her the law of the jungle.

To survive, she'd done unspeakable things. A few more deaths were just numbers to her.

"I said no!"

Annika lowered her head, her voice suddenly softening. "Master... are you reluctant to see her die?"

"Silence." Zero's tone turned icy. Even with his protégé, some lines couldn't be crossed.

"But Master, look at me." She lifted her face urgently. "I can become what she is—even better. And I'll always be loyal to you!"

Only then did Zero notice the faint resemblance between Annika's features and Vivian's.

"You altered your face?"

"Just minor adjustments," she explained quickly. "Nothing drastic."

"Even if you mimic her appearance, you'll never be her." His voice was cold. "Stop this nonsense."

The words cut deep. Annika couldn't understand his obsession with Vivian, who'd already betrayed their organization.

"Master, I just want you to see me—"

"Enough." He cut her off. "Your move against Sophia Evans was too obvious. Shadow will suspect something. Lay low."

Annika pouted. "It was flawless. I bribed the bodyguard to poison her and cut the power. Even Shadow couldn't see through the misdirection."

Zero shook his head. "You underestimate her."

To him, Vivian's allure had never been just her beauty. It was her brilliance that truly captivated.
###Chapter 753
Undercurrents

Annika Heilbronn stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingertips tracing the outline of her reflection on the glass.

A cold smirk curled her lips.

That fool Vivian Laurent still hadn't discovered the elaborate trap she'd set. Those dead people were merely stepping stones paving her way.

Master Zero was right—now wasn't the optimal time to strike against Vivian.

Her phone vibrated with an incoming message from Zoe Chamberlain. Annika scanned the list of elite names on the screen with satisfaction.

These people all believed Zoe was Dr. Luna.

The plane touched down at Capital Airport. Vivian massaged her stiff shoulders.

Ten hours of flight left her exhausted, but the sight of Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre waiting for her instantly revived her spirits.

"You both came?" Vivian quickened her pace toward them.

Isabella pulled her into a tight embrace. "If you'd stayed away any longer, I would've flown to Eudora to drag you back."

Lucas took her luggage. "You've lost weight."

Vivian gave a tired smile. "Too much going on lately."

From the attack on Queen Eleanor to Theo's accident and Zoe's impersonation—each incident had drained her.

"Let's talk at home," Isabella said, linking arms with her.

In the car, Vivian watched the scenery blur past the window.

"Any progress with Zoe?" she asked abruptly.

Isabella shook her head. "Still investigating. But..."

Her gaze flickered to Vivian's abdomen.

Vivian understood the unspoken question. "He doesn't know," she murmured.

As the car entered the Valrose estate gates, the sight of Liam Valdemar made Vivian freeze mid-step.

"What are you doing here?" Instinctively, her hand moved to shield her stomach.

Liam's hungry eyes roved over her face. "I missed you."

He stepped forward. Vivian retreated subtly.

"I'm tired. We'll talk another time." She turned to leave.

Liam suddenly seized her wrist. "Now that you're back, don't leave again."

Vivian wrenched free, her expression turning glacial. "My affairs are none of your concern."

As she walked away, a dark glint flashed in Liam's eyes.

Annika lowered her binoculars, pleased.

Liam's obsession with Vivian ran deeper than she'd anticipated.

This move had been perfectly played.
###Chapter 754 

"Did you miss me that much after just a few days apart?" Vivian's lips curved with amusement, her tone light.

Zero's deep eyes locked onto hers. "Yes. Very much."

His low, firm voice made Vivian's smile freeze.

Isabella smoothly intervened. "Why don't we go inside? Vivian just got off her flight and needs rest."

"Fine." Zero completely ignored the latter part.

Vivian was accustomed to Zero's persistence. Since she wanted information from him anyway, she led him inside.

"Adjusting well to Canada?" Vivian handed him a glass of water.

"People here are warm. The food is diverse and the scenery beautiful." His defined fingers left faint condensation on the glass.

"That's good."

"No wonder you like it here." Zero suddenly added, "I'm considering settling down."

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Retiring already at your age?"

"Problem?"

"Just seems... premature."

Zero chuckled. "Wasn't it you who told me to quit the business?" He paused. "Though I'd come out of retirement anytime you need me."

"Don't say that." Vivian frowned. "We're friends helping each other, nothing more."

Zero didn't press further and soon took his leave.

Isabella moved closer. "He seems normal. If it's love turning to hatred, shouldn't he be targeting Ethan?"

"Let's keep observing." Vivian seemed thoughtful.

Late at night, Vivian reviewed Zoe Chamberlain's file. The privileged daughter of a medical dynasty had an impossibly flawless resume.

Two days later, at downtown hospital.

Zoe set up her livestream equipment early. Taking deep breaths, she recalled the woman's instructions: "Just follow the plan."

Vivian departed on schedule. Her GPS showed an 8:30 AM arrival.

But fate had other plans.

At a crossroad, an out-of-control truck suddenly sideswiped her car. Vivian swerved violently but couldn't avoid impact.

Amid screeching brakes, her world spun violently.
###Chapter 755
The Sole Survivor

A screech of brakes tore through the air.

A black sedan careened out of control, slamming headfirst into an oncoming semi-truck.

The deafening crash of metal on metal made eardrums throb.

The sedan's front half crumpled like paper beneath the truck's massive frame.

"Someone help! There's a child in there!"

Screams erupted from the gathering crowd.

Vivian Laurent froze mid-step. Through the shattered rear window, she saw a woman shielding a little girl with her own body—impaled through the chest by twisted door metal.

Crimson droplets pattered onto the asphalt.

"Let me through! I'm a doctor!"

Vivian pushed past bystanders, crouching to assess the wreckage. The driver's lifeless eyes stared blankly. The front passenger was unrecognizable.

Only the mother in the backseat still had a pulse.

"We need tools to pry this door open! The girl's alive!"

A passerby thrust a crowbar into her hands.

As the mangled door groaned open, Vivian spotted the faint rise and fall of the child's chest. But the girl's right leg was trapped beneath collapsed seating, a jagged metal edge grazing her femoral artery.

"Any longer and we'll lose the leg."

She directed rescuers to stabilize the wreckage.

When Vivian turned to check the other victims, her stomach dropped.

The driver and male passenger were beyond saving.

The mother's breath came in shallow gasps. "Save...my daughter..." she mouthed, blood bubbling at her lips.

"I promise."

Vivian clasped the woman's icy fingers.

A ghost of a smile touched the dying mother's face before her grip went slack. Even in death, her arms remained curved protectively around her child.

Vivian's throat tightened.

As a mother herself, she understood the weight of this final plea.

This little girl was the tragedy's only miracle.
###Chapter 756

"Doctor! This child won't stop bleeding!" A panicked voice rose from the crowd.

Vivian knelt to examine the injury, her brow furrowed. "How long for the ambulance?"

"Five-car pileup ahead. It's gridlocked," a bystander fretted, wringing his hands.

Vivian studied the girl's ashen face and made a decision. "We can't wait."

She sprang up and pushed through the crowd.

"Hey! Aren't you a doctor? Where are you going?" Someone shouted indignantly.

"What kind of doctor abandons patients?" The onlookers exchanged baffled glances.

"Probably a fraud." A man pulled out his phone. "I'm filming this for social media!"

Vivian sprinted toward the corner pharmacy. Cradling her barely noticeable baby bump, each step sent sharp pains through her abdomen. But medical restrictions could wait—a life was at stake.

The glass door rattled as she shoved it open. Her gaze swept the shelves, seizing止血带, surgical blades, and antiseptic. Her fingers trembled at checkout.

"She's back!" The crowd stirred as Vivian rushed back with her supplies, her lab coat streaked with blood.

"Lay her flat!" Her command brooked no argument.

When she lit an酒精灯 to sterilize the blade, gasps erupted.

"Are you insane?" The phone-wielding man yelled. "Performing surgery on the sidewalk?"

An older woman jabbed a finger at Vivian's youthful face. "You look barely out of med school! Where's your license?"

Vivian tuned them out. Her focus narrowed to the wound, fingertips mapping出血点 with anatomical precision. No CT. No anesthesia. Just her encyclopedic knowledge of vascular pathways.

As the blade parted flesh, she texted Nathan her location. Engine roars echoed through the phone, but the traffic jam remained frozen.

"Ten more minutes," she silently urged the unconscious girl.

The shard embedded in the femoral artery turned every second into a race against death. Sweat beaded on Vivian's temple, but her hand stayed steady in the crimson pool.

Cameras captured her quivering lashes, but not the mental blueprints guiding each millimeter of her incision.
###Chapter 757

Zoe Chamberlain had been waiting in the laboratory for quite some time.

The clock struck 9:15, but Vivian Laurent still hadn't arrived.

Annika Heilbronn's call came right on cue, informing Zoe that Vivian wouldn't be able to make it tonight.

To prevent this showdown, Annika had orchestrated a multi-car accident—three lives meant nothing more than stepping stones to her.

A faint smile played on Zoe's lips. Though unaware of the specifics, Vivian's absence suited her just fine.

She sat gracefully at the lab bench, fingertips lightly tapping the surface as time ticked by.

This livestreamed duel had been dubbed "Medical World's Real vs Fake Prodigy" by netizens, with viewership already surpassing ten million.

At 9:30, the laboratory doors remained firmly shut.

Researchers glanced repeatedly at their watches, whispering among themselves.

Online outrage exploded, all directed at Vivian.

"Can't keep up the act anymore? The impostor's finally exposed."

"I've been waiting for this showdown ever since she challenged Professor Chamberlain."

"Now she chickens out? What took her so long?"

"Academic frauds like her should be banned permanently. Disgusting."

Zoe skimmed the barrage of comments, a glint of triumph flashing in her eyes.

The hospital had called three times in succession, but no one picked up.

In the operating room, Vivian knelt in a pool of blood, hands pressing desperately against a patient's ruptured artery.

Amidst the heart monitor's shrill alarms, beads of sweat formed on her forehead.

"Dr. Laurent, your phone—"

"Not now!" she snapped without looking up.

Zoe checked her wristwatch. "Since everyone's so eager, we'll wait until ten."

The chat erupted instantly.

"Why bother? The outcome's obvious!"

"Unless she got in a car crash, this is pure cowardice!"

"That woman's been faking it all along. Professor Chamberlain's the real genius!"

Trending lists were instantly dominated:
#VivianLaurentChickensOut
#AcademicFraudExposed
#ZoeChamberlainTheRealDeal

Amplified by internet trolls, the entire web condemned Vivian while elevating Zoe to sainthood.
###Chapter 758

Zoe Chamberlain's fingers paused over the glowing comments praising her as she scrolled through her phone.

The internet was ablaze with excitement, everyone convinced she was the legendary Dr. Luna.

An unconscious smile tugged at her lips, a heady rush of satisfaction swelling in her chest.

It felt like she'd truly donned the laurels of a miracle-working physician, basking in the spotlight's glow.

Just as she reveled in this illusion of glory, a sudden notification popped up: "Go check the other livestream! Vivian Laurent is saving someone!"

More messages flooded in like a tidal wave.

"Vivian was late because of a car accident?"

"Oh my God, the scene looks horrific!"

Zoe's hand froze mid-air.

She watched helplessly as her viewer count plummeted within minutes.

Meanwhile, a bystander's livestream skyrocketed from dozens to millions of viewers.

The camera showed Vivian kneeling in a pool of blood, performing emergency surgery on a little girl.

The comments overflowed with awe and remorse:

"So Vivian was actually saving lives. We misjudged her."

"Praying that little girl makes it."

"This is terrifying. Dr. Laurent is so brave."

Zoe's assistant rushed over in panic, shoving a phone in her face.

The screen's contents made Zoe's pupils constrict violently.

She shot to her feet, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

"If Vivian still hasn't shown up, it proves she's guilty." Zoe raised her voice, "We shouldn't waste time waiting for a fraud!"

Her voice trembled slightly.

Someone hesitated, "Maybe Dr. Laurent really had an emergency..."

"What kind of emergency prevents a single phone call?" Zoe snapped. "She's playing everyone for fools!"

She grabbed her purse, ready to bolt.

She had to cement Vivian's "fraud" reputation before the truth came out.

Otherwise...

The thought was too terrifying to complete.
###Chapter 759 

The hospital staff exchanged uneasy glances.

Zoe Chamberlain cut them off with an icy tone. "Wait here if you want."

She grabbed her purse and stormed out, her stilettos clicking sharply against the floor.

The live chat exploded:

"Queen Zoe slays! Who has time for a fraud?"

"Vivian's too scared to show up. What a joke!"

"Open your eyes! Check the news—Dr. Laurent's saving lives at a crash site!"

"Pathetic excuse!"

Zoe's assistant shot her a meaningful look.

Outside the hospital, Zoe turned to the camera with glistening eyes. "I only wanted the truth..."

Her voice trembled. "But Vivian played us all."

"No more games," she declared firmly. "The truth speaks for itself."

The moment the stream ended, Zoe collapsed against her car door.

Her hands shook as she pulled up another live feed.

Vivian knelt in a pool of blood, performing CPR. Her bloodstained hands never wavered.

Zoe's pupils contracted violently.

That woman had orchestrated this horrific crash to stop Vivian.

Her knuckles turned white around the phone.

Defying her would mean...

The thought sent chills down her spine.

Inside the conference room, doctors huddled around their phones.

"It really is Dr. Laurent!"

"Should we call Zoe back?"

By the time they reached the parking lot, her car was long gone.
###Chapter 760

Beads of sweat glistened on Vivian Laurent's forehead as she stood over the operating table.

Nathan Clementson arrived with the medical team in haste.

"Junior!" Nathan rushed forward.

Vivian didn't look up. "Did you bring all the instruments?"

"Everything's here." He swiftly unlatched the medical case.

Under Vivian's skilled hands, the little girl's leg was saved.

But a harsher truth awaited the child—her parents had perished in the car crash.

Sirens wailed in the distance as firefighters cleared the wreckage.

Surveillance footage showed a private car suddenly accelerating as the cause.

Vivian had chosen to treat the girl first—the truck driver's injuries were less severe.

She couldn't resurrect the dead, only fight for those who still had hope.

By the time the girl was loaded into the ambulance, Vivian's hands were stained crimson.

The summer sun made her vision blur after crouching for so long.

Nausea surged without warning. She stumbled to the roadside and retched.

A warm hand steadied her back.

"Thanks," Vivian murmured weakly.

She looked up into fathomless dark eyes.

"Ethan Roscente?" Her eyes widened. "Where's Theo?"

"Still abroad." He twisted open a water bottle and held it to her lips.

Blood coated her fingers, forcing her to drink from his hand.

The water rinsed away the stains but not the metallic scent clinging to her skin.

Ethan studied her pallor. "Stomach acting up again? You need a check-up."

"No." She averted her gaze. "You left Theo alone overseas?"

Droplets trailed down her fingertips, scattering prismatic light in the sun.
###Chapter 761

Ethan Roscente's deep voice murmured near her ear. "Felix has gone to take care of Theo. I've sent extra security there."

His gaze locked onto Vivian Laurent, dark eyes swirling with concern.

"You need me more."

Vivian stubbornly turned her face away. "I'm fine. Theo needs you."

Ethan gripped her wrist. "To me, you'll always be the girl who needs protecting."

His thumb traced slow circles against her inner wrist.

In the distance, an ambulance siren pierced the night.

Vivian pulled free and strode toward the emergency vehicle.

Nathan Clementson was directing paramedics with a stretcher. "Coming to the hospital, Dr. Laurent?"

She checked her watch. 9:15 PM.

Her phone screen lit up with a dozen missed calls.

A nurse's frantic voice came through. "Dr. Laurent, Zoe Chamberlain left. The forums are saying..."

A pause.

"That you're too scared to face her. That Zoe is the real Dr. Luna."

Vivian clenched the phone. "Understood."

The ambulance doors slammed shut, carrying the injured away.

Nathan gave her a quick gesture through the window.

The accident site reeked of gasoline. Firefighters cleared twisted metal wreckage.

Vivian's gaze fixed on a dark red stain on the pavement.

Ethan draped his jacket over her shoulders. "Wait in the car?"

She shook her head, voice barely audible. "That little girl..."

Her fingers trembled slightly.

Ethan enclosed her cold hand in his. "The Roscente Foundation will cover all her expenses."

The night wind swallowed his last words.

Vivian stared up at the police lights staining the sky. "Was this really just an accident?"

Investigators' flashlights swept over the crushed driver's seat.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Every driver gets tested for alcohol and narcotics."

His phone vibrated abruptly.

Vivian's stomach dropped.
###Chapter 762 

The rescue site remained bustling with activity.

Vivian Laurent leaned back in the car seat, finally finding a moment to check her phone.

Her name dominated the trending list.

She never intended to monopolize the headlines, yet somehow, she always ended up there.

A hospital colleague had warned her about the online backlash—Zoe Chamberlain's supporters were viciously attacking her.

But when she opened the trending topics, the top discussions surprised her.

#Vivian's Emergency Rescue
#Vivian's Street Surgery
#True Medical Heroism
#The Truth Behind Vivian's Absence
#The Night Identity Controversy

The comments section was ablaze.

"Between life and death, what does a competition matter? If not for Dr. Laurent, that child wouldn't have made it."

"Performing surgery under those conditions—that's real skill."

"Isn't saving lives a doctor's duty? What's wrong with Vivian's choice?"

Public opinion had completely shifted.

Vivian glanced at Ethan Roscente beside her. "Did you interfere?"

"Just gave it a nudge." He admitted without hesitation.

Those relentless smear campaigns all traced back to identical IP addresses.

He merely fanned the flames of truth.

But the real credit went to the netizens who recognized right from wrong.

Vivian set her phone down. "Drive."

"As you wish."

Ethan swiftly took the driver's seat, his lips curving upward.

Being her personal chauffeur was a privilege he cherished.

"Destination?"

She named the hospital.

Zoe had already left, but Vivian needed to go.

If Zoe loved livestreams, she'd play along.

Zoe had an assistant—so did Vivian.

And her "assistant" was anything but ordinary.

After exiting the car, Vivian tossed her phone to Ethan. "Hold this. Start the livestream."

"My pleasure."

Ethan caught the phone effortlessly, angling the camera toward her.

Her account had long surpassed a million followers.

The moment the stream went live, viewers flooded in.
###Chapter 763

Vivian Laurent strode into the hall, strands of hair tousled across her forehead.

"My apologies. An emergency delayed me."

She bowed slightly toward the camera, her voice crisp and unwavering.

The live chat exploded instantly: "Why bother coming when Zoe already left?"

Vivian's gaze swept across the screen like a blade.

"Her departure changes nothing. I honor my commitments."

She turned to leave.

Ethan Roscente's hand hovered near her elbow. "Mind the steps."

His deep, velvety voice resonated through the live stream microphones.

The chat erupted:
"That voice could melt glaciers!"
"Is that Mr. Roscente's hand?!"
"His cufflinks alone cost six figures!"
"The CEO himself escorting Dr. Laurent? Unreal!"

Vivian ascended the stairs and pushed open the conference room door.

Dean Remetio and several specialists remained seated.

"Dr. Chamberlain insisted on leaving. We couldn't stop her."

Vivian shook her head. "My responsibility."

Her eyes scanned the room. "I demand we proceed with the simulated surgery."

Gasps rippled through the attendees.

"But your opponent withdrew—"

"My word stands." Vivian cut through the protest.

Her lab coat flared as she marched toward the operating theater.

A shrill phone ring shattered the tension.

The answering physician paled.

"Dean! Code Blue in ICU Three!"

"Details!"

"Uncontrollable hemorrhage. Six hours into resuscitation..."

The doctor's hands trembled.

"All vitals are crashing..."
###Chapter 764

"The family gave up on treatment long ago, didn't they?" The chief physician adjusted his glasses.

The head nurse sighed. "Her situation is complicated. Her husband and only son died in a car accident three years ago. The compensation money was snatched by relatives. She's been paying hospital bills by selling her jewelry."

"I heard her nephew visits the ward daily, waiting for her to die so he can inherit her property," an intern added quietly.

Silence fell. Such cases weren't uncommon in hospitals, but each one still weighed heavily on their hearts.

Vivian Laurent suddenly spoke. "What does the patient herself want?"

"She's tougher than anyone." The head nurse's eyes reddened. "Takes her medication on time, never complains even when the pain makes her sweat. Once during a high fever, she kept murmuring about living for her husband and son."

A scalpel twirled between Vivian's fingers, catching the light in a silver arc.

"Prep the OR." She shrugged off her lab coat, revealing surgical scrubs beneath.

The live chat exploded:

"Scripted! No way this is real!"

"Just check the medical records! Faking documents at a top-tier hospital is a criminal offense!"

"Dr. Laurent's right! If the patient hasn't given up, who are we to decide for her?"

"Pfft. All those specialists already declared it hopeless. Why is she showing off?"

Ethan Roscente gripped Vivian's wrist. His frown deepened at the clammy chill of her skin. "You just vomited."

"Vitals are stable." She pulled free. "The patient can't wait."

The camera captured her walking toward the OR. Sweat darkened the back of her scrubs, yet her steps remained measured—precise as if drawn with a ruler.

Ethan suddenly addressed the lens. "She's had a fever since morning."

The comment ignited the chat:

"Operating while sick?!"

"True dedication! How do the haters feel now?"

"Fake heroics! Who takes responsibility if the patient dies?"

As the OR light blinked red, Vivian wiped her scalpel with alcohol swabs. The steel reflected her pale lips.

"Anesthesia ready." Her quiet command made every spine straighten.
###Chapter 765

"Oh my god! That voice is absolutely dreamy!"
"It's definitely Mr. Roscente! Show your face, please!"

Vivian Laurent's phone was still in Ethan Roscente's hand.
She had casually handed it to him before entering the operating room, not even bothering to lock it.

Ethan stared at the screen, his finger hovering over the power button.
In the end, he chose to continue the live stream.

Comments flooded the screen:
"Mr. Roscente, say something!"
"When will Dr. Laurent come out?"

As he leaned in to check, his profile suddenly appeared on camera.
Though it lasted only half a second, it was enough to send the直播间 into chaos.

Viewership instantly surpassed two million.
"It's Mr. Roscente! I took a screenshot!"
"That face could launch a thousand ships!"

The comments quickly derailed:
"So Sophia Evans really committed suicide?"
"Stop spreading rumors! The autopsy report was already released!"

Ethan frowned and spoke directly: "This is Dr. Laurent's直播."
"Since she's not here, let me tell you about the Vivian I know."

His voice deepened:
"Four years ago, when we first met, she had been working in the ER for 36 hours straight."
"Even then, I knew this woman was different."

The comments suddenly quieted.
"It took me a year to truly understand her."
"When she saves lives, there's a light in her eyes."

The operating room light was still on.
Ethan glanced in that direction: "Everyone said today's surgery was hopeless."
"But she insisted on trying."

One comment suddenly appeared:
"Mr. Roscente, do you have feelings for Dr. Laurent?"

He chuckled: "Yes, I'm in love with Vivian Laurent."

The Live streaming room exploded.
"OMG official confirmation!"
"That's the most direct confession ever!"

Trending lists began updating:
#EthanRoscenteLiveConfession
#VivianLaurentEthanRoscente

Inside the operating room, Vivian remained oblivious.
Her full focus was on the scalpel in her hand.

Outside, a storm was sweeping across the internet.
###Chapter 766

The operating room lights glared with sterile intensity.

Vivian Laurent stood at the surgical table, her gloved fingertips growing cold. The patient's vitals plummeted as monitor alarms shrieked against eardrums.

"BP 40 over 20, heart rate 30!" A nurse's voice trembled.

The patient's chest barely moved, their skin mottled blue. Three hours in this state—everyone knew what it meant.

"Prep epinephrine." Vivian's tone held Arctic calm.

"But the dosage—" The anesthesiologist hesitated.

"Now."

Silence swallowed the OR. All eyes turned to the chief surgeon in the corner, who gave an imperceptible nod.

The drug entered the IV line.

The patient convulsed violently. Monitor lines spiked like frenzied snakes.

"Cardiac arrest!" someone cried.

Vivian's gaze locked on the screen. Five seconds. Ten. Twenty. Time stretched into eternity.

"Should we—"

"Wait."

At the brink of surrender, the monitor emitted a single, crystalline beep.

Then another. And another.

"Rhythm restored! BP rising!" The nurse's voice cracked with disbelief.

Muffled cheers erupted. Junior surgeons blinked back tears—they'd witnessed a miracle.

"You..." The lead surgeon faltered.

Vivian peeled off her gloves, revealing slender wrists. She studied the stabilizing vitals before turning to the sink.

"Vivian Laurent." She didn't look back.

The name detonated through the room.

"Dr. Luna?!" someone gasped.

The recent controversy over the real and fake medical prodigy suddenly had its answer. Who else could snatch a death-row patient from the reaper's grip but Night herself?

Water rushed over Vivian's burning fingertips. In the mirror, she saw the surgeons' awestruck stares.

She turned the faucet off. Droplets fell from her pale hands like liquid mercury.
###Chapter 767 

Under the surgical lights, Vivian Laurent gave a slight nod.

"Dr. Luna?" someone asked cautiously.

"That's me," she replied curtly, her gaze already shifting to the medical report.

On the operating table, the patient's EKG showed faint blips.

"We're changing the approach." Vivian flipped through the charts rapidly. "Conservative treatment won't work. We need to address all issues in one procedure."

The other doctors exchanged uneasy glances.

"The risks are too high—"

"Staged surgeries carry greater risks." Vivian cut them off. "Trust me."

The scalpel traced a perfect arc in her gloved hand.

Six hours later, the monitors finally stabilized.

"Success!"

The surgical team emerged still reeling from the experience.

"That's the real Dr. Luna..."

"Without Dr. Laurent, the patient would've..."

The live chat exploded with comments.

"Zoe Chamberlain dares call herself Luna?"

"Skill speaks louder than titles!"

Ethan Roscente paced at the corridor's end.

Spotting Vivian, he strode forward in three quick steps.

"Another three-hour stand."

"Worth it." Vivian removed her mask, revealing exhausted yet satisfied eyes.

Ethan frowned. "You need rest."

"Still have the simulation surgery."

"What more do you need to prove?"

She rotated her stiff shoulders. "Promises should be kept."

Glancing at her watch, she added, "But I could eat first."
###Chapter 768

Ethan Roscente handed the phone back to Vivian Laurent.

Only then did Vivian notice the live stream still playing on screen. "The broadcast is still on?"

"Mhm." Ethan cleared his throat. "The audience was waiting for you, so I chatted with them for a bit."

Vivian scrolled through the feed. "What did you talk about?"

The comments exploded instantly:
"Ethan said he likes you!"
"He admitted it himself!"
"Ethan said he loves you!"

Vivian's head snapped up. "What did you tell them?"

"Nothing much." Ethan avoided her gaze.

She shoved the phone in his face. "Then what's this?"

His ears turned pink. "Just stating facts."

Vivian stared at him.

She regretted giving him her phone. In just half an hour, netizens had already photoshopped their wedding pictures. The chat was flooded with demands for them to "get married on the spot."

The live stream's viewer count kept rising. On camera, Vivian's bare face glowed with a natural radiance, her long lashes curled perfectly—not a single pore visible.

"Dr. Laurent's beauty is lethal!"
"A hundred times prettier than Zoe Chamberlain!"
"Brains and beauty—I'm obsessed!"

Vivian addressed the camera. "We're going to eat now, so we'll end the stream."

The chat erupted in protest:
"Don't stop!"
"Let us watch you eat!"
"Please!"

After a moment's hesitation, Vivian kept the broadcast running.

"What do you want to eat?" Ethan asked.

"Noodles." Her eyes lit up. "You can't get authentic ones in Eudora."

He raised an eyebrow. "Just that?"

"Just that."

The noodle shop near the hospital buzzed with chatter. Vivian ordered tomato egg noodles, then suddenly reached out. "Let me borrow your phone."

Ethan handed it over. Vivian dialed a number.

"Nathan?" A man's voice answered—Nathan Clementson.

Since Vivian's phone was still live streaming, she had to use Ethan's to make the call.
###Chapter 769

Vivian's fingers tightened around Ethan's phone. "How did you recognize it was me?"

Nathan's voice came through the receiver. "I have this number saved."

She raised an eyebrow at Ethan.

The man took the phone back. "I contacted Dr. Clementson when investigating Night's identity."

Understanding dawned on her.

"Senior, how's the little girl?" Vivian cut straight to the point.

"She'll live." Nathan paused. "Thanks to your timely first aid, her leg was saved too. But she's still unconscious. Police are guarding her."

"What about her parents and the driver? Was the accident suspicious?"

"That's for the police to determine." Nathan said. "The bodies went straight for autopsy."

Ethan suddenly interjected. "I have some information."

Vivian quickly thanked Nathan and hung up, tossing the phone back. "Talk."

"The vehicle had no mechanical issues. The driver wasn't drunk." Ethan pulled up surveillance footage. "Look here—"

On screen, the sedan abruptly accelerated toward a truck.

"The timing was too precise." Ethan pointed at the footage. "As if they knew you'd be passing by."

Vivian's pupils constricted. "Targeting me?"

"Just speculation." Ethan pocketed his phone.

She replayed the footage. The sudden acceleration did seem deliberate.

"Dead men tell no tales." She frowned. "The driver's background is suspiciously clean."

Ethan nodded. "Family was questioned—nothing unusual. Minimal social circle, no debts or enemies."

Live stream comments scrolled wildly. Vivian scanned the screen, then narrowed her eyes.

"Wait." She pointed at a specific comment. "That username looks familiar."
###Chapter 770

The live stream chat exploded instantly.

"Is this Zoe's doing?" A comment flashed across the screen.

"What do you mean?"

"She's afraid Vivian will expose her, so she staged the accident!"

"Are you insane? You can't control a car crash!"

"Stop defending Vivian, you stans!"

The comments section erupted into chaos.

Vivian Laurent and Ethan Roscente finished their noodles quickly and rushed back to the hospital.

When she announced she would proceed with the simulated surgery, the doctors were stunned.

"Dr. Laurent, your performance in the last surgery already proved your skills."

Vivian shook her head. "The equipment is ready. Let's begin."

"Don't you need to rest?"

"There's no time."

Ethan took on the role of assistant again, holding up his phone to continue the live stream.

For the first time, the operating room was fully visible to the audience.

A medical dummy lay on the table, monitors displaying simulated vital signs.

Rows of gleaming surgical instruments were neatly arranged.

Vivian swiftly completed sterilization.

"Fractured ribs with a foreign object penetrating the heart." She pointed to the dummy's chest. "The incision must be precise down to the millimeter."

She performed the procedure while explaining emergency medical knowledge.

The live stream audience had an epiphany.

Medical knowledge could be this accessible.

The scalpel glided through the dummy's chest cavity.

"This heart is severely damaged. A transplant is necessary."

The camera zoomed in.

Viewers held their breath.

A heart transplant required a bypass machine to sustain life.

Vivian's movements flowed like water.

Laymen watched for spectacle; professionals watched for technique.

The medical students were awestruck.

Every motion was executed with terrifying precision.

The angle, pressure, and depth of each incision were flawless.

She avoided every potential bleeding point.

Even as a simulation, it made pulses race.

No one realized a human chest could expand so wide.

No one had seen a heart beating outside the body.

No one had grasped how fragile—and tenacious—life could be.
###Chapter 771

The operating room blazed with sterile light.

Vivian Laurent's slender fingers gripped the scalpel, executing flawless incisions on the anatomical model. Her movements flowed with practiced precision, devoid of hesitation.

"Clamp."

"Suture."

Each command was crisp and authoritative.

A cardiac transplant procedure that typically required five to six hours was completed in just one under her mastery. As she tied the final knot, she lifted her gaze to the live-stream camera.

"Procedure complete."

The monitoring screens displayed steady vital signs across all parameters.

The live chat erupted instantly.

[That speed is inhuman!]
[My professor says those techniques belong only to Dr. Luna]
[Zoe Chamberlain should be ashamed!]

Vivian peeled off her gloves with a faint smile.

"This concludes today's broadcast. Remember—the real Dr. Luna only accepts patients through official channels. Anyone contacting you privately is a fraud."

Her expression hardened abruptly.

"As for those impersonating me..."

"Expect a visit from the police."

The feed cut to black.

Ethan Roscente waited by the operating room entrance, watching Vivian shed her lab coat. His eyes caught the faint redness on her fingertips.

"Hands hurting?"

She shook her head. "Minor irritation."

They walked side by side from the hospital, their shadows stretching long under the sunset.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Zoe didn't show today."

Ethan's lips curled coldly. "Guilty conscience."

——

Chamberlain Mansion.

Zoe Chamberlain stared at the darkened tablet screen, her nails biting into her palms.

Every movement in Vivian's demonstration had been surgical perfection. Flawless.

That level of skill...

She could never achieve it in this lifetime.

"Mesmerized?"

The sudden voice made Zoe jolt.

Annika Heilbronn stood behind her, having appeared without sound. The girl wore a black dress, her pallid face twisted in mockery.

"What's your connection to Vivian Laurent?" Zoe blurted.

Annika's expression contorted violently.

"None of your damn business!"

She snatched the tablet and smashed it against the floor.

The screen shattered with a deafening crack.

"That old hag isn't fit to lick my boots!" Annika shrieked. "Who does she think she is?"

Zoe recoiled from the outburst.

She studied Annika cautiously.

The resemblance to Vivian was undeniable—seven parts similarity. But where Vivian carried an icy elegance, this girl...

Was a viper poised to strike.

"Keep staring and I'll gouge your eyes out!" Annika snarled.

Zoe averted her gaze quickly.

One question burned in her mind—

What vendetta existed between these two?
###Chapter 772 

Zoe Chamberlain studied Annika Heilbronn carefully.

At first glance, her face bore seventy percent resemblance to Vivian Laurent's, yet carried an inexplicable stiffness.

Vivian possessed a gentle, jade-like elegance with natural warmth in every gesture.

This woman before her, however, had eyes so sinister they sent chills down one's spine.

"Of course you're more beautiful," Zoe forced a smile. "Vivian can't compare to you."

She'd answered this question too many times.

Annika was like an obsessed lunatic, demanding everyone acknowledge her superiority over Vivian.

"That's more like it." Annika curled her lips in satisfaction.

Zoe hesitated before speaking. "But this car accident... too many innocent lives were lost."

Her fingers tightened around the hem of her lab coat.

As a doctor sworn to heal, she'd become an accomplice to murder instead.

"Just some worthless lives." Annika sneered. "You think human lives are worth anything?"

A cold shiver ran down Zoe's spine.

"I used to be an innocent little girl too," Annika said suddenly, her voice dripping with venom. "The world wronged me first."

She would never forget the day the organization took her.

In this dog-eat-dog world, only by becoming the devil could one survive.

"But Vivian's team is already investigating..."

"Dead men tell no tales." Annika's laugh was icy. "The driver took his secrets to the grave."

She'd chosen this specific day for a reason.

It was that little girl's birthday.

Nothing disgusted her more than seeing others happy.

Zoe trembled uncontrollably.

An invisible blade hung over her head.

"How exactly did you—"

"Shut up!" Annika suddenly grabbed her chin, nails digging deep into flesh. "Keep your mouth shut if you value your life."

"I understand!" Tears streamed down Zoe's face from the pain.

Annika shoved her away. "Remember, your life belongs to me now."

She leaned close, whispering in Zoe's ear: "Screw up this act, and I'll send you straight to hell."
###Chapter 773

A light drizzle fell as Vivian Laurent stepped out of the hospital entrance.

She walked toward Imperial General Hospital with an umbrella, heading straight for the ICU.

Through the glass window, she saw the little girl lying quietly in bed with steady breathing. The heart monitor emitted rhythmic beeps.

A nurse approached softly. "Dr. Laurent, all her vitals are stable."

Vivian nodded, her gaze lingering on the bandages around the child's legs.

The accident scene photos flashed through her mind—the crushed car where the mother had shielded her daughter with her own body.

"Any updates?" Vivian called Lucas Lefèvre.

Keyboard clicks sounded through the phone. "Surveillance shows it was a car with fake plates. Still tracking it down."

Hanging up, Vivian sighed. All she could do was wait.

As night fell, alarms blared in the ICU.

"Dr. Laurent! She's awake!" A nurse rushed over.

Vivian sprinted to the room.

The girl's eyes brimmed with terror. "Where am I? Where's Mommy?"

Vivian reached for her stethoscope. "Easy now. Let me check you first."

"My legs hurt..." The child's voice trembled. "Mommy promised to take me to see fireworks today."

Vivian's hands stilled. It was the girl's birthday.

"Your mother..." Vivian hesitated.

Tears rolled silently down the child's cheeks. "They're gone, aren't they?"

Silence swallowed the room. The heart monitor's beeps grew deafening.

"Daddy promised me a princess dress." The girl stared at the ceiling. "Said we'd go to Disneyland."

Vivian's throat tightened. The accident report flashed before her—the father's hands gripping the steering wheel till the end.

"They loved you very much." Vivian gently held the small hand. "That's why you must live well."

Rain tapped against the window. What should have been a joyous birthday night echoed only with medical equipment.

"Did they die because I wanted to go to the amusement park...?"

"No!" Vivian cut in sharply. "It was an accident."

But the girl had already curled into a ball, burying her face in the pillow.

Watching the trembling figure, Vivian found herself speechless for the first time. No words could comfort this pain.

She remembered how the mother's body had still been shielding her child when rescuers pulled them from the wreckage. That image would haunt this little girl forever.
###Chapter 774

The little girl's sobs echoed through the ICU.

"Mommy...mommy..."

Her fragile voice shattered hearts.

Vivian Laurent instinctively touched her abdomen.

The fetus inside stirred slightly, as if sensing its mother's distress.

She rushed out of the room, pressing against the corridor wall as she gasped for air.

Ethan Roscente strode over and pulled her into his arms.

"What's wrong?" His voice held tension.

The crisp scent of mint clung to him.

Vivian buried her face in his broad shoulders.

"This world is too cruel." Her words came out muffled.

Ethan gently rubbed her back. "The little girl?"

"She woke up." Vivian lifted her head. "Today was supposed to be her happiest day."

"Birthday?"

"She'd promised to visit Disneyland with her parents." Vivian's nails dug into her palms. "Now..."

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"The perpetrator will pay." His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre.

Vivian took a deep breath. "I need to see Zoe Chamberlain."

"Now?"

"Now."

Without objection, Ethan opened the car door for her.

Night enveloped the city as Zoe's apartment blazed with light.

She stared at her phone screen, fingers scrolling compulsively.

The internet overflowed with news about Vivian.

"Dr. Luna..." she muttered.

Jealousy coiled like a venomous serpent around her heart.

Why did Vivian Laurent get everything?

Fame. Status. Love.

Even that man's devotion...

Zoe hurled her phone against the wall.

The screen shattered with a deafening crack in the silent night.

Unbeknownst to her, the elevator ascended steadily.

Vivian and Ethan approached her door.

This midnight confrontation would irrevocably alter three destinies.
###Chapter 775

The apartment was silent in the dead of night. Zoe Chamberlain sat motionless before her computer screen.

Vivian Laurent's profile glared back at her—renowned surgeon Dr. Luna, elite designer AN, founder of Triple Six Realty, piano prodigy... Each title was more staggering than the last.

"How does she deserve all this..." Zoe's grip on the mouse tightened until her knuckles turned white.

A shrill doorbell shattered the stillness.

Zoe jolted violently, her phone slipping from trembling fingers to thud against the carpet.

"Who is it?" Her voice quivered as she glanced at the wall clock—2:17 AM.

That mysterious woman never rang the doorbell.

Barefoot, Zoe crept to the foyer and peered through the peephole.

The security monitor displayed a chillingly familiar face.

Zoe's breath hitched, her heart skipping a beat.

For one terrifying moment, she thought it was the woman who'd been threatening her.

Then recognition dawned—Vivian Laurent.

"Zoe, open up." Vivian's voice penetrated the door.

Zoe trembled violently, fingers digging into the doorframe.

On the monitor, Vivian stared directly into the camera as if seeing straight through her.

The soft click of the lock engaging echoed in the silent apartment.

"You think hiding will save you?" Vivian's laugh was ice-cold. "Do the people in hospital beds haunt your dreams?"

Zoe bit her lip until coppery blood filled her mouth.

"Not my fault..." She shook her head soundlessly, nails carving crescents into her palms.

"Three. Two—"

Vivian's countdown was a death knell.

Ethan Roscente stepped forward abruptly. "Allow me."

He drew his pistol and fired at the lock.

BANG!

Acrid smoke curled from the shattered electronic mechanism as the door swung open.

Zoe staggered backward, knocking over a vase in the foyer.

"Breaking and entering! I'll call the police!" Her scream dissolved into tremors.

Vivian advanced over broken porcelain shards, her elongated shadow stretching behind her in the moonlight.
###Chapter 776

"Call the police? Perfect. Let them decide who belongs behind bars."

Vivian Laurent's icy gaze locked onto Zoe Chamberlain. "That car crash today—you expect me to believe you had nothing to do with it?"

"Lies!" Zoe spat.

That had been the other woman's scheme. What did it have to do with her?

"What's your game, impersonating Dr. Luna?" Vivian advanced, her voice razor-sharp. "You can fool others, but not yourself. Who's pulling your strings? Talk, and I'll guarantee your safety."

Zoe's teeth sank into her lower lip.

She wouldn't take that risk.

The woman who looked identical to Vivian was a psychopath, a remorseless killer. Zoe wanted to live.

Vivian's promises? Worthless. If she died, Vivian wouldn't even find her body.

Not to mention her entire family's lives were in that woman's hands.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Zoe sneered. "If anyone's the fraud here, it's you. Those people died because of you!"

So it was true.

Vivian's pupils contracted. Someone had orchestrated that crash to stop her from reaching the hospital.

Rage burned through her veins.

"Do you know how many lives were lost?" Vivian's voice trembled. "A little girl—today was her birthday. Now her parents are corpses!"

"She's seven! Right now, she's clutching their bloodstained clothes, sobbing until she passes out!"

"Zoe, you're a doctor!" Vivian slammed her palm on the table. "Did you feed your Hippocratic Oath to the dogs?"

Zoe's face drained of color.

Her grandfather's wrinkled hand brushing her hair flashed in her mind. "Yue'er, doctors save lives..."

But now she couldn't even save herself.

"Not my problem," Zoe suddenly grinned, her expression twisted. "Go ahead. Call the cops. See if they arrest me."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"If you're so noble, Vivian, why don't you stop every tragedy in the world?"
###Chapter 777

Vivian stood at Zoe's doorstep, her fingertips turning cold.

"I'll find the real mastermind." She met Zoe's gaze directly. "But until then, you need to stop. Continuing will only hurt yourself and others."

Zoe leaned against the doorframe, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her shirt.

"I've looked into your records." Vivian softened her voice. "Your father was the chief of surgery at Mercy Hospital. Your mother was a pediatrician. You grew up volunteering at the Red Cross—over two thousand hours of service."

Zoe's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

"Someone like you... why would you help them hurt people?" Vivian took a step forward. "Just tell me who's behind this, and I'll let the impersonation of Dr. Luna slide."

"I don't know what you're talking about." Zoe jerked her head up, panic flashing in her eyes. "Leave now, or I'll call the police."

Ethan moved protectively beside Vivian. Her baby bump was clearly visible now—she couldn't afford any risks.

"Zoe." Vivian suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Look me in the eye and tell me your conscience is clear."

"Let go!" Zoe struggled violently. "This is unlawful restraint!"

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "Two choices. You walk out on your own, or I make you walk."

"Where are you taking me?" Zoe's voice trembled.

"The hospital." Vivian released her. "To see the little girl in the ICU because of you."

Zoe's face drained of color.

"No... I'm not going!" She staggered back. "This has nothing to do with me—"

Vivian studied her for a long moment before turning abruptly.

"Let's go."

Ethan arched a brow as he followed her into the elevator. "Got a plan?"

"You know me so well?" Vivian smirked.

"You never leave things half-done."

In the car, Vivian pulled up the hospital surveillance feed. The screen showed a small girl hooked to tubes, crying hysterically. She flipped open her laptop, fingers flying across the keys.

Zoe's phone suddenly lit up, the live feed forcing its way onto her screen. The child's heart-wrenching sobs blared from the speakers.
###Chapter 778

Zoe Chamberlain slammed the door shut with force, deciding to call a locksmith first thing tomorrow.

She collapsed onto the sofa, Vivian's words echoing relentlessly in her mind like a cursed incantation.

She wasn't born evil. Each accusation stabbed her heart like a dagger.

She understood everything Vivian said. But she had too many reasons beyond her control.

Her phone screen suddenly lit up, playing a video automatically.

The emaciated little girl in the footage wailed with heartbreaking intensity.

"Mommy...Daddy...It's all my fault..."

The childish sobs pierced Zoe's heart like needles.

She tried to turn off her phone, but the screen remained frozen.

Zoe hurled the phone against the wall with violent force.

As the screen shattered, the living room TV flickered to life.

The massive screen displayed the little girl's mutilated face in horrifying clarity.

"Ahhh!"

Zoe grabbed a vase and smashed it into the television.

Shards of glass scattered everywhere, but the crying continued through the speakers.

The neighbor's knocking only amplified her agitation.

"Get out! All of you, get out!"

In the suffocating silence, she heard phantom voices screaming from every direction:

"Murderer!"
###Chapter 779

Zoe Chamberlain huddled in the corner, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"It wasn't me! Stay back!"

Her screams were hysterical as the mangled figures of the couple flashed before her eyes. The husband's hollow sockets and the wife's bruised arms reached for her, inching closer.

"Give me back my daughter's life..."

The ghostly wails echoed in her ears.

Zoe flailed wildly, knocking over a glass on the coffee table. Shards scattered, cutting her ankles, but she didn't even notice.

"Ghosts! Help!"

Staggering backward, she toppled a floor lamp. In the flickering light, she saw a little girl standing in a pool of blood, stretching out a tiny hand toward her.

Zoe's eyes rolled back as she collapsed to the floor.

When Vivian Laurent pushed open the door, the metallic scent of blood hit her.

"She scared herself unconscious," Ethan Roscente muttered, kicking aside the broken glass.

A pale-faced neighbor peeked out. "That woman's lost it—screaming about seeing dead people..."

Vivian crouched down, pressing two fingers to Zoe's wrist.

"Psychological trauma," she said, slipping her phone away. The ICU surveillance footage still glowed on the screen.

Ethan hauled Zoe's limp body up with one arm. "Hospital?"

"Yeah."

The hospital hallway at 2 AM was eerily empty.

Zoe was wheeled into an observation room, the steady beep of the heart monitor filling the silence.

"Go get some sleep," Ethan said, draping his jacket over Vivian's shoulders. "I'll stay."

She shook her head, pointing to the lounge at the end of the hall. "There's a bed in there."

"Where do I sleep?" He arched a brow.

"Don’t you have a penthouse?"

Ethan shoved open the lounge door, eyeing the narrow single bed. "I'll take the floor."

Vivian ignored him, lying down without another word.

Ten minutes later, a muffled cough broke the silence.

"Ethan."

"Yeah?"

"Get up here."

The mattress dipped under his weight.

Vivian felt the heat of his chest against her back and immediately warned, "Hands."

His fingers froze mid-reach.

"One move and you're back on the floor."

Ethan obediently withdrew his arm—only to slip it around her waist once her breathing evened out.

Beneath his palm, a tiny flutter pulsed.

He held his breath, fingertips trembling.

Their child.

Moonlight filtered through the blinds, casting dappled shadows over their entwined silhouettes.
###Chapter 780

Vivian Laurent awoke with a suffocating weight on her chest.

Ethan Roscente's arm was wrapped around her waist like an iron band, trapping her against him. His body heat seeped through the thin fabric of her nightgown, dampening her back with sweat.

"Ethan!" She struggled to free herself.

He jolted awake but only tightened his grip. "What's wrong?"

"Let go! I can't breathe!"

Reluctantly, he released her and followed her to the bathroom.

Vivian rushed to the ICU. The orphaned girl had cried all night, her voice hoarse and eyes swollen like peaches.

Test results showed she could be transferred to a general ward.

As Vivian wheeled the bed, the girl suddenly grabbed her hand. "Dr. Laurent, I want to leave... I need to say goodbye to Mom and Dad."

"Just two more days, okay?" Vivian soothed gently.

"Did it hurt... when Mom died?" Fresh tears spilled down the girl's cheeks. "What were her last words?"

Vivian knelt to meet her gaze. "She said you must live well."

"But I want to give her my life..." The girl choked on a sob. "Why couldn't it have been me instead?"

Vivian's throat tightened. She rubbed the girl's back. "Try to sleep. Maybe you'll dream of her."

When the girl finally drifted off, Vivian turned to find Zoe Chamberlain standing in the doorway.

Zoe's face was deathly pale, but twisted with rage when she saw Vivian. "You were the one playing tricks last night!"

"I brought you here to see the consequences of your actions." Vivian held her stare.

"Spare me the act!" Zoe sneered. "You think this would make me repent?"

Looking at the stranger before her, Vivian's heart sank. The gentle girl she once knew was gone—only madness and hatred remained in those eyes now.
###Chapter 781

Zoe Chamberlain's fingers trembled slightly, but she forced herself to straighten her posture.

"What does she have to do with me?" She sneered. "I didn't personally cause her parents' death."

Vivian Laurent's gaze burned like fire. "But you were an accomplice. If you don't reveal who's behind this, more innocent people will suffer."

"I'm not asking you to take responsibility. I just want to prevent more tragedies." Vivian took a step closer. "Tell me, who's pulling the strings?"

Zoe studied Vivian's face and suddenly realized how different she was from that woman.

There was genuine concern in Vivian's eyes.

"You..." Zoe hesitated.

Vivian frowned. "Me?"

Zoe clenched her teeth. This was the biggest hint she could give. That woman looked so much like Vivian—how could she not know?

"Stop playing the savior." Zoe suddenly raised her voice. "You're the one who insisted on claiming the Night identity. Vivian, the more attention you draw, the more people will die!"

Vivian's eyes turned icy. "You're the real killer here! Impersonating Night and swindling people—can you honestly say you've never harmed anyone?"

The image of Madeline Delmonico's pale face flashed through Zoe's mind.

Those "miracle drugs" laced with morphine were slowly killing the socialite.

"Psycho!" Zoe turned and fled, her high heels tapping a frantic rhythm on the floor.

Vivian watched her retreating figure with a thoughtful expression.

When the call connected, Lucas Lefèvre's voice sounded weary. "There aren't enough leads. It's difficult to investigate."

"Keep close surveillance on Zero." Vivian tapped the desk lightly with her fingers. "I need to know his movements these past two days."

"Zero's been acting normally." Lucas hesitated. "Our team has had him under 24-hour watch. He shouldn't be involved in the car accident."

Vivian tightened her grip on the phone.

If not Zero, then who?

She suddenly remembered Zoe's meaningful emphasis on the word "you."

In the darkness, it felt like unseen eyes were watching her through layers of mist.

Who was this hidden enemy lurking in the shadows?
###Chapter 782

Ethan Roscente pushed open the door to find Vivian Laurent standing alone by the floor-to-ceiling window, lost in thought.

He strode directly to her and held a delicate soup dumpling to her lips. "Open."

Vivian parted her lips instinctively as the warm broth burst in her mouth.

"Ethan, you—"

"Finish eating first." He interrupted. "Want to see Theo?"

"Yes!"

The video call connected, showing Theo Evans with rosy cheeks playing blocks with Felix Valdemar.

"Uncle Ethan! Aunt Vivian!" Theo pressed his face to the screen. "When can I come home?"

Vivian suddenly realized it might be time to bring Theo back. His presence would comfort Ethan.

"When the doctors confirm you're fully recovered," she said gently.

Theo immediately turned to Felix. "Uncle Felix can vouch for me!"

Felix looked utterly defeated. "Ethan, you tricked me into babysitting while you're off having fun."

"Consider it an honor." Ethan arched an eyebrow.

"I don't care!" Felix ran a hand through his hair. "I'm growing mushrooms here!"

"Fine. I'll arrange the private jet."

Watching their banter, Vivian thought of the withdrawn girl at the hospital. Perhaps Theo's innocent joy could warm that cold heart.

...

Bianca Semona's nails dug into her palms.

News about Vivian and Zoe Chamberlain flooded her computer screen.

"Why won't she die?" Victoria Roscente smashed a teacup. "My sister's life—"

"My parents died because of her too." Bianca's voice turned icy. "But..."

"But what?"

"Someone's been helping me." Bianca lowered her voice. "All the plans against Vivian...she taught them to me."

Victoria frowned. "Who?"

"She looks—" Bianca's eyes widened as she stared past Victoria.

A languid female voice spoke from behind them. "Talking about me?"

They whirled around.

A woman lounged on the leather sofa, legs crossed. Her face—an exact replica of Vivian's.

"Who are you?" Victoria's voice trembled.

The woman chuckled, tracing a finger along her cheekbone. "Don't you recognize this face?"
###Chapter 783

"Don't ask how I got here." Annika Heilbronn lounged on the sofa, twirling Victoria Roscente's limited-edition lipstick between her fingers. "I just find you two... fascinating."

She tossed the lipstick back onto the vanity. The metallic casing clinked against the glass surface.

Victoria narrowed her eyes. "You look almost identical to Vivian Laurent."

"The enemy of my enemy is my friend." Annika's lips curled. "I can help you eliminate Vivian."

"Why should we trust you?" Victoria sneered.

Annika leaned forward abruptly. "Wasn't Sophia Evans' fate warning enough?"

Victoria's fingers tightened involuntarily on her skirt.

"Fine. What do you want us to do?"

......

The antiseptic smell of the hospital corridor made Vivian Laurent wrinkle her nose. Ethan Roscente's phone vibrated again.

"Company emergency?" she asked softly.

Ethan massaged his temples. "It's nothing."

"Go ahead." Vivian rested a hand on her rounded abdomen. "I'm fine."

After a moment's hesitation, Ethan nodded. "Call me immediately if anything happens."

Watching him leave, Vivian turned toward the hospital room. Through the glass, she could see the little girl sleeping peacefully.

Four more months. She mentally calculated her due date.

The sharp click of heels interrupted her thoughts.

"Vivian!"

Victoria dragged Bianca Semona down the hallway, then abruptly dropped to her knees three steps away.

"Please don't kill me!" Victoria's trembling voice drew curious stares from passersby.

Bianca knelt reluctantly beside her, lips pressed into a thin line.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Psychiatry is on the fourth floor."

As she turned to leave, Victoria lunged forward and grabbed her leg.

"I know you have connections everywhere!" Victoria's nails dug into Vivian's skin. "Even Sophia Evans died because of you. Please spare me!"

Whispers spread through the gathering crowd. Someone discreetly raised their phone to record.

Vivian looked down at the woman who'd once carried herself with such arrogance, now groveling at her feet like a stray dog.

"Let go." Her voice turned glacial.
###Chapter 784

Bianca Semona suddenly dropped to her knees before Vivian Laurent, tears streaming down her face. "Vivian, you've already taken my parents' lives. Why won't you spare this worthless existence of mine? I know you wield immense power—bloodstained hands mean nothing to someone above the law. I only beg to live in obscurity..."

Her wails drew curious glances from passersby.

Seizing the moment, Victoria Roscente threw herself at Vivian's legs, clinging desperately. As Vivian tried to pull away, Victoria dramatically collapsed backward.

"Ah!"
She curled into a fetal position, clutching her stomach, face drained of color.

"Vivian, I came in good faith to apologize, yet you resort to violence..." Victoria trembled as she struggled upright, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Vivian observed the theatrics coldly. "I never laid a finger on you."

Victoria glanced around before lowering her voice. "Beat me all you want if it appeases your anger. Just...don't sell me to those vile places..."

Vivian's brow furrowed.
What nonsense was this woman spouting now?

Without checking, she knew social media would explode. Anyone watching would think Vivian the villain in this performance.

"Victoria, get up!" Vivian's voice cut like ice.

"I won't!" Victoria shrieked hysterically. "Haven't you ruined my life enough? Must you annihilate every last shred of my dignity?"

Her deliberately vague accusations invited wild speculation.

Vivian looked down at her. "Since you insist I've wronged you, explain clearly—what exactly have I done?"

Victoria's mouth snapped shut.

"Shall we call your brother to arbitrate?" Vivian's lips curled. "Or shall I state plainly—I, Vivian Laurent, conduct myself with integrity. Petty schemes beneath someone like you aren't worth my attention."

Her gaze swept over both women. "Sophia Evans' death wasn't my doing. Neither were your parents' deaths. But you..."

Vivian lowered her voice. "Before she died, Sophia mentioned someone manipulating her from the shadows. If anyone approaches you...they're likely your family's true murderer."
###Chapter 785

Vivian's words struck Bianca like a sledgehammer.

Her entire body trembled.

The murderer of her parents?

The accusation was too horrifying to comprehend, yet Vivian's unwavering expression showed no trace of deception.

Victoria discreetly squeezed her hand.

"Vivian, what nonsense are you spouting?" Victoria forced composure into her voice. "We came to beg for mercy, not to hear these outrageous lies."

Vivian's icy gaze swept over them.

"I've never killed anyone." She enunciated each word clearly. "If you're so concerned, feel free to have me watched around the clock."

Before turning away, she cast Bianca one final glance.

"Remember—if anything happens, it's not my doing."

The click of her stilettos faded into the distance.

...

In the hospital corridor, the two women scrambled to their feet.

Victoria's palms were slick with cold sweat.

The internet had exploded. Though their public humiliation was complete, public opinion overwhelmingly condemned Vivian.

"Victoria..." Bianca's voice shook. "Do you think she's telling the truth?"

Victoria suppressed her own terror.

"Don't believe her." She forced a smile. "Vivian specializes in sowing discord."

They parted ways in the parking lot.

Victoria froze the moment she opened her car door.

Annika sat elegantly in the backseat, legs crossed.

"Not bad." Annika chuckled. "More theatrical than I expected."

Victoria's fingers dug into the steering wheel.

"I did everything you asked." Her voice trembled. "You promised to let me go."

Annika suddenly leaned forward.

"Sophia Evans was your doing, wasn't she?" Victoria whirled around. "And Bianca's parents!"

The car fell deathly silent.

Then Annika burst into laughter.

"Clever girl." She applauded mockingly. "No wonder you've survived this long."

Victoria's blood turned to ice.

"Why?" She ground out the word through clenched teeth.

Annika's smile widened, radiant and terrifying.

"Because..." She exhaled softly. "The game has only just begun."
###Chapter 786

"Sophia Evans? She failed her mission and tried to betray me. She got what she deserved." Annika Heilbronn's voice was soft as silk, yet chilling to the bone.

"You..."

"As for your friend's parents," Annika tilted her head with an innocent smile, "how else would your friend learn to hate Vivian Laurent? No hatred, no motivation to work for me."

Victoria Roscente felt her blood run cold. This seemingly harmless girl had blood on her hands.

The most terrifying part? She didn't even bother hiding it.

"Why are you telling me this?" Victoria's voice trembled.

"Hide it from you?" Annika chuckled. "Do you actually think you'd seek revenge?"

Victoria clenched her fists. She knew she didn't have the courage.

"Smart girl." Annika leaned closer, her icy fingers brushing Victoria's throat. "If you breathe a word... Sophia's eyes were this wide when she died."

Victoria stumbled backward. Vivian had been telling the truth all along.

Now she realized - she was already in too deep.

"N-no more." Her face turned ashen.

Annika smiled in satisfaction. "Remember. One word leaks out, and you'll take your secrets to the grave."

Victoria nodded mechanically.

"Pull over there." Annika pointed to a surveillance-free spot.

Victoria's hands shook. This girl even knew the blind spots.

The car swerved to a stop, nearly hitting the guardrail.

Victoria swallowed her fear. She regretted ever crossing Vivian.

Now her only choice was obedience - if she wanted to live.

Back at the Roscente mansion, a figure in the living room made her freeze.

"E-Ethan..."

Ethan Roscente's expression was stormy. He'd barely stepped out before someone targeted Vivian.

"Victoria." His voice could freeze hell. "Did my warning mean nothing?"

"I didn't touch Vivian."

"Really?" His laugh was bitter. "Publicly humiliating her with that kneeling stunt? Embarrassing our family wasn't enough?"

Victoria bit her lip. She'd been a fool.
###Chapter 787

Victoria Roscente's fingers clenched tightly around the hem of her dress.

"Brother, I'm just scared." Her voice trembled slightly. "Vivian Laurent is a liar. Sophia Evans must have been killed by her. I'm her next target—I have to protect myself."

Her reddened eyes lifted.

"Sophia was such a kind person, gone just like that. She bore a child for the Roscente family. Even if she hadn't contributed much, she still suffered..."

Ethan Roscente suddenly interrupted, "Did you know Theo isn't Sophia's biological son?"

Victoria's eyes widened in shock.

"What?" Her voice rose sharply. "That's impossible!"

The image of Theo's sweet smile flashed through her mind. That child had called Sophia "Mom" since birth. How could it be...

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"Not only was she not his mother, but she nearly killed him days ago." His voice burned with suppressed anger. "If not for Vivian, Theo would be dead now."

Victoria staggered back a step.

"No way... Vivian must have deceived you..."

"I ran a paternity test." Ethan spoke each word deliberately. "Sophia hid too many secrets. She wasn't the person you thought she was."

Victoria's lips trembled.

She recalled what that woman had said—that Sophia had been silenced for betraying them.

Had Sophia also tried to kill Theo...?

The thought sent chills down her spine.

"Sophia wouldn't..." she murmured. "She was so gentle..."

But ever since that woman appeared, she'd begun doubting everything.

Footsteps suddenly sounded at the door.

"Mr. Roscente is back," announced a servant.

Victor Roscente entered with a smile, his gaze shifting between them.

"Why didn't you tell me you were coming, Ethan?" He approached warmly. "I would've returned earlier had I known."

Ethan gave a slight nod. "Uncle."

Victoria kept her head down. "Father."

Victor patted Ethan's shoulder.

"You've been neglecting company matters lately." His tone was deceptively concerned. "If you're too busy, you should delegate. The old shareholders are watching closely."
###Chapter 788 

Victor Roscente's murky eyes gleamed with greed.

He had been eyeing the Roscente Group like a starving wolf for far too long.

Ethan Roscente sat on the leather sofa, his long fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest.

"Uncle, at your age, shouldn't you be more concerned about your blood pressure than company affairs?"

A faint smirk played on his lips.

Victor's face darkened.

The memory of that meticulously planned car accident five years ago surfaced.

It should have erased Ethan just like his elder brother.

Yet this bastard had survived against all odds.

"Ethan, I'm just looking out for you," Victor forced a strained smile through gritted teeth.

Ethan stood, adjusting his suit cuffs.

"Last quarter's shareholder dividends were 15% higher than last year. Your retirement fund must be quite substantial now."

He emphasized the words "retirement fund" deliberately.

Victor's teacup slammed onto the table with a violent crack.

Tea splattered across the floor.

"Ethan Roscente! Don't push your luck!"

Ethan looked down at him with icy detachment.

"Uncle, you handed over the company willingly."

His gaze turned glacial.

"Because you nearly bankrupted the Roscente Group."

Victoria Roscente trembled in the corner.

She'd never seen her father lose composure like this.

Victor suddenly grabbed the crystal ashtray.

"Dad!" Victoria gasped.

Ethan didn't even blink.

"Uncle, are you sure you want to do this here?"

He leisurely pulled out his phone.

"Security is just downstairs."

Victor's arm froze mid-air.

With a furious snarl, he set the ashtray down.

"Let's go!"

Ethan watched their retreating figures with a cold smile.

Victoria chased after her father into the elevator.

"Dad, what was that about?"

Her instincts screamed something was wrong.

Victor avoided her gaze.

"Nothing."

She gripped his arm.

"Did you have something to do with Ethan's car accident five years ago?"

The elevator air turned to ice.

Victor violently shook her off.

"Don't be absurd!"

But the sweat beading on his temple betrayed him.

Victoria's face paled.

"Dad... are you hiding something from me?"

Victor hissed under his breath.

"Shut your mouth! Do you want to get us all killed?"

The elevator doors opened.

He stormed out without looking back.

Victoria stood frozen.

A chill seeped into her bones.
###Chapter 789

Victoria Roscente locked eyes with her father Victor Roscente.

"Dad, how much do you really know about Sophia Evans?"

She caught the fleeting shift in his expression.

That wasn't the look of someone hearing shocking news for the first time.

"I know nothing."

Victor's voice tightened.

"You're lying." Victoria pressed forward. "Theo isn't Sophia's child, is he?"

The study's atmosphere turned glacial.

Victor's fingers tapped absently against the desk.

"This conversation ends here."

"Why?" Victoria's voice trembled. "Does this have something to do with Alexander's death—"

"Enough!"

Victor slammed his palms on the desk and stood abruptly.

He strode toward the staircase but paused at the landing.

"Some truths are better left buried."

Victoria watched her father's retreating figure.

The memory surfaced—that rain-soaked night five years ago at Alexander's funeral. Sophia clutching newborn Theo, her wails piercing the air.

Those tears had held too many secrets.

Victor returned to his study and locked the door.

From the bottom drawer, he retrieved a yellowed photograph.

The girl in the picture smiled radiantly, her belly slightly rounded.

The bar singer.

Alexander had died never knowing who really killed the woman he loved.

Victor flicked open his lighter.

Flames licked the photograph's edges, turning the past to ash.

Every move had been calculated—from making Alexander fall for that girl, to convincing the family to accept "Sophia's child."

A flawless scheme.

Pity Sophia proved such a useless pawn.

Victor gazed at the darkening sky through the window.

Time to rearrange the board.
###Chapter 790

Ethan's fingers tightened around his phone.

Less than three hours after he left, Vivian was already in trouble again. This marked the third incident this month—each time trouble found her the moment he stepped away.

"Vivi, I—"

"Don't apologize." Vivian's cool voice cut through the line. "Victoria started it. Not your fault."

His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed the self-blame.

"Alright. Get some rest."

"Wait." Her sudden stop made his breath hitch. "Don't come tomorrow."

The silence stretched between them.

Four years ago, those exact words had left his lips. Back then, he'd found her clinginess suffocating, craving distance between them.

Now the tables had turned, and he finally understood the ache she must have felt.

"Understood." Ethan ended the call softly.

Vivian stared at the darkened screen, an inexplicable weight settling in her chest.

Since when had Ethan become so compliant? That wounded tone made her feel like some cruel tormentor.

Shaking her head, she tossed the phone aside.

Her palm rested on the gentle swell of her abdomen. "Sweetheart," she whispered, "Mommy's in a tough spot."

Her planned departure in one month grew complicated with Ethan's constant vigilance. If she vanished abruptly, he'd tear the city apart searching for her.

But the greater threat lurked in the shadows.

Bianca's reaction today had been peculiar. At the mention of "that person," the jade expert's eyes had darted away like a startled deer.

Who exactly was pulling the strings?

Vivian mentally cataloged every possible enemy. Sophia was dead. If the organization wanted her eliminated, they wouldn't employ such convoluted methods.

She sat bolt upright.

Unless... this traced back to that incident four years ago?
###Chapter 791

Vivian Laurent mentally reviewed all recent events.

The appearances of Bianca Semona, Sophia Evans, and Zoe Chamberlain seemed too coincidental.

Since Liam Valdemar returned, everything felt orchestrated by an invisible hand.

Yet every investigation cleared him of involvement.

Rubbing her temples, Vivian kept working at her computer.

She hacked into Zoe's home security system—no suspicious activity in the footage.

Sophia's surveillance records were equally pristine.

Even Victoria Roscente's cameras showed only Ethan Roscente's visit—nothing else.

No evidence of tampering.

This level of perfection indicated extraordinary skill.

Vivian's instincts whispered this was the work of someone from the organization.

Only specialized training could achieve such flawless execution.

If not Liam, then who?

She hated doubting him, but years had passed—people change.

Dawn broke as Vivian finally found a lead.

Zoe's patient list revealed elite clients.

One name stood out: Madeline Delmonico.

This operation required absolute secrecy.

Vivian dialed Ethan's number.

"Viv?" His deep voice answered.

"Where are you?" she demanded.

"Almost at your place. Bringing breakfast."

His car soon pulled up outside.

"Something urgent?" He strode in with a takeout bag.

Vivian grabbed a sandwich and took a bite.

"Rough night?" Ethan noted her dark circles.

"I need a favor." She dodged the question.

"Name it."

"I'm meeting someone today. Zoe can't know."

Ethan's eyes gleamed. "What's the play?"

"Plant a decoy at the hospital. Escort 'me' there."

She locked eyes with him. "Can you handle it?"

A smirk curved his lips. "With pleasure."
###Chapter 792

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Vivian Laurent finished her breakfast leisurely and grabbed her bag.

Ethan Roscente waited by the foyer, brows furrowed. "I'll drive you to the hospital."

"No need." She shook her head. "Special arrangements today."

She had already asked Isabella Langley to impersonate her at the clinic.

Isabella sat in the hospital office, carefully replicating Vivian's features in the mirror.

"Leave it to me." She flashed an OK sign. "No one will know the difference."

Vivian inspected the makeup and nodded in approval.

"If anyone asks, say I'm in surgery." She adjusted her scarf. "Dr. Wang has been notified."

Ethan gripped her wrist. "It's too dangerous."

"I'll be careful." She gently pulled free.

Applying a quick disguise, she slipped out among the patients with a mask and cap.

The streets bustled with activity.

Vivian scanned her surroundings, ensuring no suspicious figures followed.

Her intel confirmed Madeline Delmonico visited this luxury spa every Wednesday.

Changing into staff attire, she entered with her cap pulled low.

"You're new?" Madeline emerged in a robe, eyeing her skeptically. "I requested Xiao Wang."

Vivian removed her mask. "Mrs. Delmonico, I'm Vivian Laurent."

"Dr. Luna?" Madeline paled. "Impossible! Zoe Chamberlain is Night!"

"Zoe's a fraud." Vivian held her gaze. "She stole my identity."

Madeline staggered back. "Lies! She cured my migraines!"

"Migraines have varied causes." Vivian remained calm. "Symptom relief doesn't make her a miracle worker."

"Then how?" Madeline clutched her robe, fingers trembling. "No other doctors helped!"

Vivian noted the unnatural twitch. "Have you become dependent on certain medication recently?"

Madeline's face froze.

"Let me examine you." Vivian stepped forward.

"Get out!" Madeline shrieked. "Security! An imposter!"

Footsteps pounded down the hallway.

Vivian slipped a note into Madeline's pocket. "My contact details."

She ducked into the adjacent room as guards stormed in.

Through the door crack, she watched Madeline's hand drift to her pocket—but the note stayed hidden.
###Chapter 793

Vivian Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "Lying to you brings me no benefit. I just want to warn you not to be fooled by Zoe Chamberlain."

Madeline Delmonico sneered. "What does she want? Just money. I paid millions in consultation fees. She treats me, we both get what we need."

Vivian shook her head internally. What kind of spell had Zoe cast on this woman?

She took a deep breath. "Even if you don't believe my identity, at least let me examine you. I performed the surgery for Queen Eleanor of Eudora."

Madeline's eyes flickered. That incident had indeed caused quite a stir.

"Perhaps the Queen was deceived too," Madeline retorted stubbornly.

"The surgery was successful." Vivian met her gaze directly. "At least that proves my medical skills are legitimate."

After a moment's hesitation, Madeline relented. "Fine, try. But if you can't find anything, get out immediately!"

Vivian first observed Madeline's complexion, then pressed gently on her temples. "Does this hurt? Is it throbbing or sharp pain?"

"Aren't you the miracle doctor?" Madeline mocked. "Why ask me?"

Vivian's fingers stilled. This patient was truly difficult.

She continued applying precise pressure to Madeline's scalp. Surprisingly, the woman's headache seemed to ease.

"Any other discomfort besides the headaches?"

Madeline narrowed her eyes. "Occasional lower abdominal pain."

Vivian's movements paused. "Have you ever had a miscarriage?"

Madeline's eyes flew open, pupils dilating sharply. This was a secret she'd kept buried for twenty years.

That child had only been two months along. She'd terminated it secretly.

Because it wasn't her husband's.

Her gaze locked onto Vivian's face. "How could you possibly know that?"
###Chapter 794

"I didn't..." Madeline Delmonico denied vehemently.

Her fingers tightened around the handkerchief until her knuckles turned white. This secret must never come to light, or she would lose everything she had.

Vivian Laurent's piercing gaze saw right through the lie.

Madeline had indeed suffered a miscarriage without proper recovery, leaving lasting complications. The symptoms varied—some experienced excruciating abdominal pain, while others suffered debilitating headaches.

"If you say so, then it must be true. But identifying the root cause is crucial for proper treatment." Vivian's tone remained calm. "If you trust me, you could show me your medical reports. This condition might not require medication—acupuncture could suffice."

She paused deliberately. "I'd also like to examine the medicine Zoe Chamberlain gave you."

Madeline's eyes darted nervously. Could she trust this young woman?

Yet Vivian had instantly recognized her miscarriage—a testament to her medical expertise. Refusing cooperation might risk exposure...

"Fine. Let's see what you can uncover. But if you fail, I won't let your unauthorized visit slide."

"Understood." Vivian nodded.

Madeline retrieved a small porcelain vial from her purse—Zoe's precious remedy she carried everywhere for sudden headaches.

"Be careful with it. This is extremely valuable."

Vivian uncorked the vial and inhaled the scent of a single pill. Her expression darkened instantly.

"You take this daily?"

Disbelief colored her voice. How could Zoe dare to do this?

Why would Madeline ingest unverified medication so blindly?

"Yes, it works wonders. Is there a problem?" Madeline tensed at Vivian's reaction.

"For how long?"

"Over two weeks now. The headaches were unbearable before this."

Vivian's voice turned grave. "Do you even know what you're consuming?"

"W-what is it?" Madeline's hands trembled.

"Morphine." Vivian enunciated each syllable. "An addictive narcotic. It merely masks pain while creating dependency."

"Zoe never treated your condition—she hooked you on drugs. This likely contains other additives too. Once addicted, you'd become her puppet, forced to obey her every demand for your next fix!"

Madeline's face drained of color. "No... that's impossible..."
###Chapter 795

"You can have this medication tested at any accredited lab."

Vivian Laurent's voice was firm, her gaze steady.

Madeline Delmonico's hands trembled slightly as she clutched the medicine bottle.

"Impossible..."

She murmured to herself, recalling the unnatural relief she felt after each dose.

"Have you been experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you skip a dose?"

Vivian's question struck like a dagger.

Madeline's face paled.

"These are classic signs of morphine addiction."

Vivian lowered her voice. "I came here secretly to give you a choice."

"Should I tell Zoe?"

Vivian's lips curled coldly. "She'll only accelerate your demise."

Each word landed like a hammer blow.

"Why..."

Madeline's voice shook.

"Control is her only objective."

Vivian remained calm. "Verify the facts first, then decide."

Doubt had already taken root in Madeline's mind.

"Any proof?"

She clung to fading hope.

Vivian listed a series of medical credentials.

"The dean of Capital Hospital can verify my credentials anytime."

The irrefutable evidence shattered Madeline's resistance.

"What should I do?"

Finally, she relented.

"Keep pretending."

Vivian handed her a substitute medication. "Don't alert her yet."

She produced silver needles. "Acupuncture will ease your withdrawal."

Madeline took a deep breath and nodded.
###Chapter 796

"If I don't take this medicine, my headache..."

Madeline Delmonico's fingers trembled. She knew that excruciating pain too well. What terrified her more was realizing she'd become dependent on those pills.

Vivian Laurent sterilized her silver needles. "Let's try acupuncture first. Since you're here for a cosmetic procedure today, no one will suspect anything. I'll prepare new medication after reviewing your test results."

"Yes, yes!"

As Madeline lay down, the needles pierced her scalp. Instead of the expected sting, a soothing warmth spread through her skull.

Within ten minutes, Madeline's breathing deepened.

Vivian retrieved the needles and slipped away unnoticed. She had to stop Zoe Chamberlain before another victim fell prey.

Madeline hadn't slept this soundly in months.

Even with Zoe's medication, she'd wake up drenched in cold sweat. But this time, she slept through till morning.

The miracle? Waking up headache-free, as if a crushing weight had lifted.

"This..."

Her fingertips touched her temples—no more throbbing. Could Vivian be the real Dr. Luna? Were Zoe's pills actually drugs?

That afternoon, Madeline sent the medication for testing.

The results made her hands shake—thirty times the legal morphine limit, laced with hallucinogens.

"Zoe!"

Her nails dug into her palms as she clutched the report. Remembering how she'd publicly endorsed Zoe on social media turned her stomach.

Her phone vibrated.

A message from Vivian: "Don't alert her. She's not working alone."

Madeline took a shaky breath and typed: "Dr. Laurent, the test results are back. Thank you for saving me."

Without Vivian, she might have already...

The reply came instantly: "Healing is my calling. Zoe's impersonation of Dr. Luna has hurt many. I need your continued cooperation."

"Absolutely." Madeline gritted her teeth as she sent it.

Outside, the sunset bled crimson. Her gaze fell on the "miracle cure" bottle on her vanity before she violently swept it into the trash.
###Chapter 797

Vivian Laurent visited more victims.

She discovered Zoe Chamberlain's methods were identical.

All victims had ingested slow-acting poison.

Zoe first gained their trust with ordinary supplements.

Then secretly switched to poison once their guard was down.

The victims only realized the truth after Vivian's revelation.

Furious, they all agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

A glint of determination flashed in Vivian's eyes.

She refused to believe Zoe's backer could control everything.

This battle—she would win at all costs.

......

In the Capital Hospital office, Ethan Roscente paced restlessly.

Isabella Langley looked up impatiently.

"Must you wear a hole in the floor?"

"I'm worried about Vivian."

"You think she's that weak in your eyes?" Isabella scoffed.

"She needs your protection?"

Ethan frowned.

"I just—"

"Just what?" Isabella cut him off.

"She's far more capable than you imagine."

Ethan fell silent.

Of course he knew Vivian's abilities.

She never relied on anyone.

Yet he couldn't stop worrying.

"Spare me the act," Isabella sneered.

"Remember how you treated her before?"

"Who are you pretending to care for now?"

Ethan's gaze darkened.

"She's the only one I've ever loved."

"Please," Isabella rolled her eyes, standing.

"Stay away from her."

"Or else—"

The door swung open before she could finish.

"Dr. Laurent!"

Felix Valdemar poked his head in excitedly.

"I brought Theo—"

His voice died abruptly.

His eyes locked onto Isabella's face.

"You're not Dr. Laurent!"

Isabella gave him a withering look.

"Took you long enough."
###Chapter 798

Isabella Langley curled her lips in a cold smirk. "Open your eyes and take a good look."

Felix Valdemar's pupils contracted as he stared at her in shock. "How did you..."

The woman before him wore a lab coat, her makeup so meticulously applied that she bore seventy percent resemblance to Vivian Laurent. At first glance, one might mistake her for Vivian herself.

"Boss Ethan, this..." Felix turned toward Ethan Roscente.

Ethan cut him off. "Don't ask." He motioned to Theo. "Come here."

The boy scampered over eagerly. Ethan ruffled his hair, noticing the child's complexion had improved significantly.

"Does it still hurt? What did the doctor say?"

Felix answered first. "He's recovering well. The doctor cleared him for discharge."

"Uncle, it doesn't hurt." Theo obediently wrapped his arms around Ethan's leg, suppressing the lingering pain in his body.

Isabella watched the scene with rising fury. "Scumbag!"

Assuming the insult was directed at him, Felix immediately retorted. "Isabella, what the hell is wrong with you? How am I a scumbag?"

"All men are the same!" Isabella spat through clenched teeth. "Filthy animals who can't control their baser instincts!"

Memories flooded her mind—Vivian enduring morning sickness alone, sleepless nights, prenatal checkups, even refusing medication when ill. And the excruciating pain of childbirth, while men only needed one pleasurable moment.

Felix looked bewildered. "You women are the ones who—"

"Shut up!" Isabella snapped. "Men get their kicks and walk away, leaving women to bear all the suffering!"

Ethan remained silent. He understood the subtext of Isabella's words but chose to feign ignorance.

Isabella's anger burned hotter. The backaches of late pregnancy, the bone-splitting agony of labor—things no man could ever comprehend. Yet they became fathers with a single reckless night.

Ethan smiled bitterly to himself. He had indeed neglected precautions. Whatever Vivian decided, he would respect her choice.

But for now, he had to maintain the charade of ignorance.
###Chapter 799

Felix completely missed that Isabella was referring to Ethan, thinking she was targeting him instead.

"That's quite a sweeping generalization," he scoffed. "Some men actually have standards—like me and Boss Ethan."

He admitted he enjoyed admiring beautiful women, but he never messed around.

Unlike Isabella, who cycled through boyfriends like seasonal wardrobes.

"Birds of a feather," she sneered, dismissing their claims outright.

"What's that supposed to mean? You're hardly a saint yourself!"

Their bickering was nothing new to Ethan.

"Say that again!" Isabella raised her fist threateningly.

Felix instinctively flinched. This woman was unhinged enough to actually hit him.

"Uncle Felix, no fighting," little Theo piped up sweetly, holding out a White Rabbit candy. "Pretty lady, have candy."

Despite being Sophia's son, the child was undeniably adorable—rosy-cheeked with sparkling doe eyes.

Isabella had been horrified to learn Sophia tried to kill her own child. How could anyone harm such an angel?

"Thank you, Theo." Her demeanor instantly softened as she accepted the treat.

The tension still lingered when Nathan entered. "Miss Langley, come with me to the OR."

He would lead the five-hour surgery, assisted by Ryan—both trusted allies.

Isabella only needed to sit in the operating room as Vivian's alibi.

"On my way." She hurried after him.

Felix blinked in confusion. "Since when does she do surgeries?"

Ethan decided to come clean. "Vivian had to step out. She's covering."

"That makes sense!" Felix exclaimed. "I've known her for years, and she can't even prescribe cough syrup."

"Keep this quiet."

"You don't trust me?" Felix thumped his chest. "My lips are sealed."

Ethan rolled his eyes.

"Since Theo's back, let's continue his hospital observation."

"Yay!" Theo cheered. He hated hospitals, but this place was different.

Kind nurses and his aunt made it feel like home, not some sterile ward.
###Chapter 800

Ethan Roscente held Theo Evans' hand as they stepped out of the office, heading to complete the hospitalization paperwork.

Felix Valdemar quickly followed. "I'm coming too."

The office door swung open to reveal a tall figure raising his hand to knock.

Their gazes locked, freezing the air between them.

"Mr. Valdemar. Business?" Ethan's voice cut through the tension like ice.

Liam Valdemar—known publicly as Liam Valdemar—stood at the threshold. His eyes lingered on Ethan's face, a flicker of lethal intent passing through them. If Vivian Laurent hadn't protected this man, he would've eliminated him long ago.

"I'm here for Vivian." Liam's tone matched the arctic temperature of the room. "None of your concern."

Ethan silently thanked the stars that Isabella Langley had already left. Liam knew Vivian too well—he'd see through any imposter instantly.

"She's in surgery." Ethan kept his expression neutral. "It'll take hours."

Liam's stare sharpened. "I came for her. Not you."

Felix couldn't stay silent. "She's not here. Waiting won't change that."

Liam's gaze shifted, the weight of it pressing against Felix like a physical force. The younger man shivered—those eyes held the same deadly calm as Ethan's.

"I'll wait." Liam didn't budge.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Suit yourself."

His instincts screamed at the timing of Liam's appearance. This man always had ulterior motives—caution was necessary.

Leading Theo away, Ethan felt Liam stride past them into the office.

While processing the admission forms, Ethan swiftly texted Vivian: "Liam's here. Be careful."

Her reply came fast: "Surgery went well."

His jaw tightened as he typed: "Stay safe."

He knew Vivian too well—six months pregnant yet still charging into danger, keeping his nerves perpetually frayed.

On the other end, Vivian allowed herself a small smile. Pocketing her phone, she quickened her pace back to the hospital.

Her meeting with the informant had yielded crucial intel: Zoe Chamberlain was drugging patients, but the mastermind remained elusive.

Vivian arrived just as Nathan Clementson's surgery concluded. She slipped in unnoticed before making her presence known.

"Isabella," she murmured, "Liam's here. Need you to play along again."

"Easy enough." Isabella grinned. "Let me change first."

After Isabella left, Vivian turned to Nathan. "Thanks for covering, Nathan."

His brow furrowed with concern. "Find anything? What's that impersonator after?"

Vivian shook her head. "Motive's unclear. But she's been feeding patients morphine long-term. Vile methods."
###Chapter 801

"She comes from a prestigious medical family. How could she use drugs to control patients? It's a complete violation of medical ethics!"

Vivian sighed softly. "Perhaps she had no choice. I saw the struggle in her eyes—someone must be coercing her."

Nathan clenched his fists. "We must expose the mastermind. Only by revealing your Dr. Luna identity can we stop them."

The operating room doors slid open soundlessly. Vivian and Nathan emerged side by side, their lab coats pristine without a single crease, as if they'd never left the hospital.

At the corridor's end, Ethan Roscente approached with Theo Evans asleep in his arms. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly upon seeing Vivian unharmed.

"Liam is waiting in your office," Ethan said hesitantly. "Do you need me to—"

"Stay with Theo," Vivian cut him off with a warning glance. "Don't follow me."

She knew exactly what would happen if these two men crossed paths again. Their last "chance encounter" in the hospital garden had nearly demolished the entire fountain.

When she pushed open her office door, the figure by the window turned. Liam Valdemar leaned against the windowsill, a cigarette between his fingers with an impossibly long ash dangling precariously.

"Sorry, the surgery took longer than expected." Vivian removed her mask, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear.

Liam stubbed out the cigarette. His steel-blue eyes looked unusually gentle in the morning light. "Waiting for you is an honor. After all..." His lips curved slightly. "I've waited five years already."

The words pierced Vivian's heart like fine needles. She avoided his gaze. "Don't do this anymore. If one day I disappear—"

"Where would you go?" Liam closed the distance abruptly, his sleeve brushing against her lab coat.

Vivian took half a step back. "Just a hypothetical. Did you need something?"

"Only to share a meal with you." His voice regained its usual lazy cadence. "Like we did in the safe house."

"Too many cases lately." Vivian busied herself with organizing files. "Another time."

Liam watched the crown of her head silently, his knuckles whitening inside his sleeves. Sunlight through the blinds cast alternating stripes of light and shadow across his face.

How many times had it been now? He counted silently in his mind. Each hope raised, each disappointment endured. Like a wound that kept reopening before it could heal.

Children's laughter drifted through the window. Suddenly he remembered years ago, sharing moldy bread with her amidst gunfire. She'd promised then—when it was all over, they'd taste every delicacy the world had to offer.

"I understand." As he turned, his lab coat whispered against the metal door handle.
###Chapter 802

"Not free for dinner tonight either?" Liam's voice was low.

Vivian's fingers paused mid-page turn on the medical chart.

She truly couldn't get away. Patient files from the morning needed organizing, and three special medications required preparation.

"How about... the hospital cafeteria?" She lifted her gaze with the suggestion.

The cafeteria would save at least two hours. Going out would waste most of that time just on travel.

More importantly, things between her and Liam weren't what they used to be. Those unspoken questions weren't ready to be voiced yet.

"Never mind." Liam stood abruptly, his lab coat whipping the air.

He left without hesitation, the sharp click of dress shoes against tile gratingly loud.

The hallway lights stretched his shadow long behind him. Liam clenched the pill bottle in his pocket.

Ungrateful woman. If not for his behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Vivian would have died in that explosion three months ago.

What he needed was a docile puppet like Annika, not an unpredictable variable like Vivian.

......

Silence reclaimed the office.

Vivian stared at the empty doorway, twirling her fountain pen absently.

Liam's reaction was excessive. The cafeteria's mushroom chicken noodles were actually quite good.

Knock knock—

Ethan peeked in just as she zoned out at thin air.

"He's gone?" He deliberately lowered his voice.

"Mhm."

Ethan's eyes lit up as he practically bounded to her desk. "Hungry?"

"Busy." Vivian didn't look up.

"I'll have my private chef—"

"Cafeteria?" she interrupted suddenly.

Ethan froze, his Adam's apple bobbing twice. "Yes!"

He answered too fast, nearly biting his tongue. The cuff of his white dress shirt brushed the desk edge unnoticed.

Vivian finally looked up from her charts. "Seriously?"

"Eating with you," Ethan loosened his tie, "anywhere works."

Even if it meant nibbling steamed buns while inhaling antiseptic fumes.

"Ridiculous." She snapped the folder shut.

"Scold me more?" He leaned over the desk, his dangling tie swaying. "Or tell me to get lost."

Vivian finally cracked a smile.

The man was... she couldn't even describe it. But he inexplicably reminded her of that yellow dog from her hometown that kept wagging its tail even after being kicked away.

Ethan was now clumsily gathering her scattered pens, his cufflinks clinking against the desk.

Different from Liam, she thought.

This one radiated warmth even in his happiness.
###Chapter 803

Sunlight streamed through the hospital curtains as Vivian Laurent walked beside Ethan Roscente after breakfast. Concerned about Theo, she detoured to the pediatric ward.

"Auntie!" Theo bounded toward Vivian like an excited fawn.

Ethan intercepted him with lightning reflexes. "Careful."

His protective hand accidentally brushed Vivian's abdomen. She recoiled instantly. "What are you doing?"

"Didn't want him hitting your injury." Ethan's expression remained unreadable.

Vivian exhaled discreetly. For a heart-stopping moment, she'd feared he'd discovered her secret.

"Theo, let me check your wound." Her voice softened.

The boy obediently lifted his hospital gown. The scabbed incision showed good healing. "We'll run tests tomorrow to monitor internal recovery," Vivian nodded approvingly.

"You're the best!" Theo's eyes sparkled. "I'll protect you when I grow up!"

Vivian sighed. "Could you call me something else? Sister or aunt would work."

"Why?" Theo tilted his head. "Are you getting a new boyfriend?"

Ethan's gaze sharpened on Vivian's face. He'd noticed her discomfort with the title—was there truly another man?

"It just sounds odd," she deflected, avoiding Ethan's stare.

"Does it bother you, Uncle?" Theo appealed to Ethan.

"Not at all." Ethan's tone brooked no argument.

Two pairs of identical eyes pinned Vivian with matching wounded expressions. She surrendered. "...Fine for now. I'll reconsider when I have a boyfriend."

"You're seeking a boyfriend?" Ethan's voice dropped ten degrees.

Vivian lifted her chin defiantly. "Got a problem with that?"

Dark currents swirled in Ethan's eyes. This woman carried his child yet contemplated making another man the father?

"Found one?" Each word sounded forcibly extracted.

"Taking my time." She feigned nonchalance.

Ethan's lips curled. "So that's a no."

"No rush."

"Why look elsewhere?" He stepped closer, his proximity electric. "Wealthy. Handsome. Skilled in...every way." The lowered timbre of his voice made her pulse spike. "Care for a demonstration?"

Vivian's cheeks burned as she averted her gaze. For all her bravado, every ounce of her romantic experience had been learned from Ethan himself.
###Chapter 804

"Have you lost your mind? Talking about such things in front of a child!"

Vivian's face flushed crimson. She shot Ethan a glare before anxiously glancing at Theo.

The little boy remained engrossed in his building blocks, oblivious to the adult conversation.

"Theo didn't hear a thing," Ethan smirked, his roguish charm on full display. "So, have you made your decision?"

"Not a chance!" Vivian hissed through clenched teeth. "I don't do second chances. Get out of my sight."

"Then I'm staying," Ethan declared, sprawling across the sofa. "I'm not going anywhere without you."

Vivian stomped her foot in frustration. Since when had this man become so shameless? And why couldn't she shake him off?

She grabbed her coat. "I have work. No time for your nonsense. Watch Theo."

"Where are you going?" Ethan sprang to his feet. "I'll drive you."

"No need." Vivian didn't turn back. "Medical reports await at the hospital."

"Call me when you're done," Ethan's voice followed her. "I'll be waiting."

Vivian paused mid-step. This man never interfered with her choices, yet always appeared when she needed him most.

She gently ruffled Theo's hair before exiting the ward.

The hospital lab glowed under fluorescent lights. Vivian immersed herself among vials and test results. Today's complex case demanded an immediate treatment plan.

The clinking of glassware echoed in the sterile silence. She meticulously measured ingredients, jotting down data in her notebook.

Compared to terminal cases, these symptoms were manageable—just requiring aggressive medication and careful rehabilitation.

The wall clock ticked past 2 AM. After twenty consecutive hours, Vivian massaged her stiff neck as her vision blurred.

"Age catches up," she muttered. Once capable of working three sleepless nights, now exhaustion crept in.

For the baby's sake, she needed rest. A yawn escaped as her eyelids grew heavy.

She slumped over the lab table, surrendering to sleep.

...

Ethan checked his watch—3 AM. With Theo sound asleep, he headed to check on Vivian.

At 9 PM, he'd glimpsed her focused profile through the glass door. Not wanting to disturb, he'd lingered in silence.

Now the lab stood eerily quiet. Pushing the door open, he found the usually energetic woman curled up asleep at her workstation.

Her petite frame looked fragile under the white coat. Hair spilled across the table like a tired child's.

Ethan's heart melted. He tiptoed closer.

"Vivian," he whispered. "You'll catch cold like this."

Her steady breathing didn't falter.

Noticing her slightly rounded abdomen pressed against the table edge, Ethan frowned. Gently, he scooped her into his arms.

Vivian instinctively nuzzled against his chest in her sleep. Smiling, Ethan carried her toward the restroom.
###Chapter 805

Ethan Roscente bent down and effortlessly gathered Vivian Laurent into his arms.

Her eyelashes fluttered as she slowly opened her eyes.

The familiar icy scent made her relax instead of struggle.

"Put me down..." Her voice was thick with sleep.

"Sleep in bed." Ethan tightened his hold.

Vivian murmured an indistinct reply before drifting off again.

He carried her to the lounge bed with careful steps.

Pulling a thin blanket over her, he dimmed the lights.

His long fingers brushed stray hairs from her forehead as he sat beside her.

Ethan watched her sleeping face, his thumb tracing the cool tips of her fingers.

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

Vivian sat up, glancing around.

Memories surfaced—Ethan had carried her here last night.

After freshening up, she resumed the unfinished work from yesterday.

The office door opened as Ethan entered with breakfast.

"Eat first."

She accepted the sandwich, reviewing medication lists between bites.

"Slow down." His brow furrowed.

He watched her busy hands helplessly.

The prepared medicines needed immediate delivery.

Vivian dialed a number. "Finn, come to my office."

Soon, Finn Deross appeared. "Master?"

"Deliver these to the designated locations." She handed him the list. "Remember—no exposure."

Finn grinned. "Leave it to me."

He expertly packed the medications and left.

Vivian headed toward the ward.

A child's crying echoed from inside.

Sighing, she made another call.

"Theo, I need your help."

Theo Evans bounded over. "What is it?"

"There's an injured girl inside. Can you keep her company?"

He thumped his chest. "No problem!"

Pocketing candies, he pushed the door open. "Want some sweets, sis?"

The girl shook her teary face.

Theo tilted his head. "Candy helps when I'm sad."

"You get sad too?" She sniffled.

His gaze dropped. "When I miss Mom and Dad..."
###Chapter 806

The little girl wiped her tears, staring at the boy half a head shorter than her.

"How...how old are you?" she sniffled.

Theo lifted his face. "Four and a half."

The girl froze. At eight years old, she already felt miserable—yet this little brother had lost both parents before even turning five.

"Your mom and dad..." she asked cautiously.

Theo kicked a pebble on the ground. "Dad was gone before I was born. Mom...she always hit and yelled at me. Later Uncle told me she wasn't my real mom."

Fresh tears welled in the girl's eyes.

"But Uncle and Auntie are really nice to me." Theo suddenly grabbed her hand. "Don't cry, big sister. We have to live well."

The girl stared at him blankly.

"My mom said the stars are people who loved us." Theo pointed at the sky. "They're always watching over us."

The girl's tears turned into a smile as she nodded firmly.

Vivian stood nearby, her eyes burning. Her Theo always knew how to warm others' hearts.

......

Zoe's apartment was shrouded in darkness, curtains drawn tight.

She curled in the corner of the couch, knees hugged to her chest. Despite the heating, her body wouldn't stop trembling.

"Go away...all of you..." She swatted at the empty air.

The voices returned—patients moaning, families wailing, the metallic clang of surgical tools hitting the floor.

"Dr. Chamberlain, why did you kill me?"

"You murderer!"

She clawed at her ears, nails digging into her scalp. Three sleepless nights left her eyes bloodshot, lips cracked and peeling.

Her phone vibrated, startling a scream from her.

Madeline Delmonico's appointment reminder.

With shaking hands, Zoe dialed Annika's number.

"I...I can't do this anymore..." Her words tumbled out incoherently. "Please...let me go..."

A light chuckle came through the receiver. "Of course."

Zoe exhaled in relief, ready to thank her—

"Use your life to end it then." Annika's voice turned glacial. "You know too many secrets."

The phone slipped from Zoe's fingers.

At last, she understood—she'd already fallen into the abyss with no way back.
###Chapter 807

Annika's icy voice crackled through the phone. "Crushing your entire family would be as easy as stepping on ants. If you want to die, be my guest."

Zoe's hands trembled around the phone.

"Tomorrow, do you choose death... or obediently treating those patients?"

Zoe forced the words through clenched teeth. "I'll go! I swear I'll go!"

"Good." Annika's laugh sent chills down Zoe's spine. "No tricks. Now that I've chosen you, there's no escape. Obey, or else—"

The line went dead.

Zoe collapsed to the floor.

Each breath felt like lifting a boulder from her chest.

She was trapped on this sinking ship—jumping overboard meant certain death.

But every time she closed her eyes, she heard the little girl's heart-wrenching sobs.

Face ghostly pale, Zoe mechanically packed her medical kit.

Crash!

The sound of shattering porcelain echoed through the Delmonico mansion.

Madeline Delmonico's rage reduced priceless vases to rubble.

A maid knelt on the floor, trembling violently.

"Dare to lie to me?" Madeline's voice could freeze hell itself. "Tired of living?"

The maid kowtowed desperately. "Mercy, madam! A moment of weakness—it won't happen again!"

Madeline's expression remained glacial. "Drag her out. Feed one hand to the leopards."

Screams echoed down the corridor.

The butler approached at the perfect moment. "Madam, Miss Chamberlain has arrived."

Madeline's gaze lifted—one look made Zoe's knees buckle.

"M-Madam Delmonico..." Zoe's voice shook.

The earlier scene had turned her blood to ice.

"Ah, Night." Madeline's tone dripped disdain.

The alias made Zoe's stomach clench.

If not for Vivian's warning to endure, Madeline would've tossed this fraud into the ocean by now.

Two days of morphine withdrawal had been pure agony.

"Madam, what happened—" Zoe fought to keep her voice steady.

"Just a disloyal servant." Madeline's smile didn't reach her eyes. "I showed mercy, yet she repaid me with deceit."

Her stare pinned Zoe in place. "Two things I despise above all—lies and betrayal. Cross me, and I'll make you beg for death."

Each word stabbed Zoe's heart like a blade.

She stood frozen, sweat soaking through her blouse.

"Night?" Madeline called twice before Zoe snapped back to reality.

"You look pale." Fake concern laced Madeline's voice. "Trouble sleeping?"

Beneath her sleeves, Madeline's nails dug bloody crescents into her palms.

Every ounce of willpower kept her from tearing this impostor limb from limb.
###Chapter 808

Zoe Chamberlain forced a faint smile. "Perhaps I haven't been sleeping well lately."

Madeline Delmonico asked with concern, "Would you like to rest some more before we begin?"

Zoe shook her head. "No need. Since I'm already here, let's examine your condition first. How have you been feeling these past two days? Have you been taking the medicine as prescribed?"

A cold glint flashed in Madeline's eyes.

This woman dared to poison her. Death would be too merciful.

Suppressing her rage, she maintained a calm expression. "I've taken it, but the headaches persist. And I'm needing the medicine more frequently now. Dr. Chamberlain, what exactly is wrong with me? Surely I deserve to know the cause if I'm taking medication indefinitely?"

Zoe visibly panicked.

She had no idea about any diagnosis—those weren't real medicines to begin with.

"The headaches are a chronic condition," Zoe stammered. "Complete recovery takes time. You must continue the medication until we assess your progress."

She deliberately avoided explaining the cause.

Madeline pressed further. "What's the root cause then?"

Zoe fabricated hastily, "It's from exposure to cold in your youth. The wind chill penetrated your brain. Now any breeze triggers the pain."

Madeline smirked inwardly.

Such smooth lies.

But she remembered Vivian Laurent's instructions and didn't expose the deception.

"How many days' worth should I take this time?" Madeline inquired.

Zoe replied, "Let's pause the medication for observation."

This was Annika Heilbronn's order. The fish had been fattened—time to reel it in.

Once the drugs were withheld, Madeline would experience withdrawal symptoms and come begging. Then the price would skyrocket.

"Very well." Madeline pretended ignorance.

Without Vivian's warning, she might have remained in the dark.

Now fully understanding Zoe's scheme, she decided to play along.

The moment Zoe left, Madeline contacted Vivian.

Vivian instructed, "Pretend to suffer withdrawal symptoms where Zoe can see you. Then approach her and note her demands."

"Understood." Madeline agreed.

Zoe believed she held all the cards, unaware that Annika was actually the one being played.

Annika was lost in her delusions.

She considered Vivian utterly defeated, with all these powerful figures under her thumb.

These elites would become her pawns—smuggling drugs and building her empire in Canada.

Though part of the organization, Annika had always harbored ambitions of independence. She needed funding and connections.

Once the network was established, she planned to recruit promising candidates as assassins.

She didn't realize she was the fish caught in the net.

Beyond her sight, Vivian had already set an inescapable trap.
###Chapter 809

Annika Heilbronn's lips curled into a cold smile as she patiently waited for her prey to take the bait.

Little did she know, Vivian Laurent had already set an inescapable trap.

Two days later, Madeline Delmonico finally lost her composure and called Zoe Chamberlain.

"Dr. Night, I can't take it anymore!" Her voice trembled. "The headaches are unbearable. Give me the medicine now!"

Zoe responded with deliberate calm. "Madeline, this medication doesn't come cheap."

"Money isn't an issue!" Madeline said urgently. "I've already paid you millions!"

"That was just the consultation fee." Zoe chuckled darkly. "Now, I want something else."

Madeline's heart clenched.

Just as Vivian had warned - this was clearly a trap.

"What do you want?"

"I hear your husband works at Customs?" Zoe cut straight to the point. "I have some cargo that needs clearance."

"Never!" Madeline snapped.

Her husband did hold a senior Customs position.

But smuggling? That was a capital offense!

Besides, their marriage had been strained for years.

"Don't be so hasty, Madeline." Zoe's voice turned threatening. "The next withdrawal episode won't be so easy to endure."

Madeline's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

Everything was unfolding exactly as Vivian predicted.

"Zoe!" She spat through gritted teeth. "You're no doctor!"

"Correct." Zoe dropped all pretense. "That was a specially formulated narcotic. Impossible to find elsewhere."

"Cooperate, and you'll get all the antidote you need."

"Otherwise..." She let the threat hang.

Madeline finally exploded.

"You bitch!" She seethed. "How dare you trap me like this?"

The days of pretending had been torture.

Now she could finally drop the act.

"You think I'm afraid of you?" Zoe sneered. "Without the antidote, you'll wish for death."

Madeline slammed the phone down.

Her entire body shook with rage and terror.

Outside the window, Vivian's silhouette flashed past.

The real game had only just begun.
###Chapter 810

Zoe Chamberlain let out a cold laugh. "You dare touch me? Then you're finished too. Besides, coming after me is pointless."

She had that mysterious woman backing her.

"What do you mean? Zoe, you're not really Night, are you?" Queen Eleanor's voice trembled. "You've been lying to me all along. Vivian Laurent is the real Night, isn't she?"

The Queen's acting deserved an Oscar.

Seeing no point in pretending, Zoe dropped the act. "That's right. I'm the impostor. Vivian is the real Night. But so what? Everyone believes me now. Nothing Vivian says matters."

She didn't know Madeline Delmonico was secretly recording everything.

This brazen deception showed Zoe's audacity.

People had trusted her because of her medical family background. Who could've imagined she'd fooled so many?

What about all those fans defending her online? How could she face them?

Madeline vowed to expose this fraud.

"So everything was fake? That hospital incident, the major car accident with all those deaths—was that your doing too?" Madeline pressed.

At the mention of the crash, Zoe snapped. "No! That had nothing to do with me! Don't ask me about it!"

Her voice turned shrill as she spiraled into hysteria.

The overreaction spoke volumes. If she wasn't involved, why panic?

Screams erupted through the phone before the line went dead.

Madeline immediately sent the recording to Vivian.

"Irrefutable evidence. We can release this anytime."

The recording captured Zoe admitting she was an impostor and Vivian being the true Night.

"Thank you, Madeline."

"I should be thanking you. Without you, I'd have fallen into Zoe's trap. But withdrawal is agony. Dr. Luna, is there any medication?"

"Drugs can't cure addiction. Fortunately, you weren't on it long. Zoe thought you were already deeply addicted—that's why she acted so hastily."

"I understand. The acupuncture did ease my headaches. But the withdrawal symptoms are unbearable. When can we schedule another session?"

"In a few days. Have you been taking the medicine I prescribed?"

"Religiously."

Madeline wasn't naive. She'd secretly tested every pill.

All doctors confirmed they were safe. Some experts even marveled at the prescription's brilliance.
###Chapter 811

"Madeline Delmonico, we need your help to lure out the mastermind behind Zoe Chamberlain."

"Consider it done." Madeline agreed readily before ending the call.

Zoe's phone rang again.

Her voice was now perfectly controlled, betraying no emotion.

"Have you made your decision?" Zoe cut straight to the point.

"Never! I would never betray my husband!" Madeline declared firmly.

"This is your last chance."

"Zoe, who are you really working for?" Madeline suddenly asked. "Or is there someone else pulling your strings?"

"That's none of your concern."

"Then have your puppet master come talk to me personally! Otherwise, this conversation is over!"

Madeline stood her ground without flinching.

After a brief silence, Zoe replied, "I need to consult."

This response confirmed Vivian's suspicions completely.

Zoe immediately contacted Annika.

"A meeting won't hurt," Annika said casually.

Her only concern was smuggling the contraband and drugs into the country.

They agreed to meet at the Delmonico residence the next day.

Vivian's pulse quickened.

The truth was about to be revealed.

"Should we set up an ambush?" Isabella asked nervously.

"Don't alert the enemy," Vivian shook her head. "This opponent isn't ordinary."

"Then we just confirm their identity?"

"Yes. Have Madeline activate the surveillance."

Vivian frowned slightly.

Could it be Liam?

The thought made her chest tighten.

"We'll know tomorrow!"

Isabella clenched her fists.

Days of exhaustion made Vivian's eyes sting.

Once the real culprit was exposed, she could finally focus on her pregnancy in peace.

Dawn was breaking on the horizon.
###Chapter 812

Vivian Laurent's schedule was packed.

Between her current tasks, she kept thinking about Queen Eleanor's condition.

She had left Eudora shortly after the last surgery. Though unable to personally care for the queen, every medical report still reached her promptly.

The fetus showed stable readings. The queen's health was steadily improving.

This little life would soon enter the world. Knowing how much the queen cherished this child, Vivian believed he would grow up safe and sound.

After hanging up with the queen, Fiona Grandelle immediately approached.

"Viv, is everything okay?" Fiona pouted angrily. "Those online rumors are ridiculous! You saved lives, yet they're accusing you of harming people. And that impostor—how dare they act so arrogantly!"

Mentioning the fake Dr. Luna made Fiona stamp her feet in frustration. The impersonator flaunted superiority in front of Vivian but avoided direct confrontation, resorting only to underhanded tricks.

"Don't worry. I have a plan." Vivian ruffled her hair. "Just focus on taking care of yourself."

"Got it!" Fiona suddenly grew bashful. "Viv...can I ask you something?"

"About Ryan Fairsprene?" Vivian saw right through her.

Fiona's eyes widened. "How did you guess?"

"Mind reading." Vivian winked.

"I...haven't seen Dr. Fairsprene in ages." Fiona bit her lip. "He barely replies to my messages. Does he...like someone else?"

Vivian shook her head with a smile. "He's buried in an important thesis lately—too busy to breathe. I guarantee no other woman is around him."

"Really?" Fiona exhaled in relief.

"When you visit Canada next time, he'll still be the same Dr. Fairsprene." Vivian reassured her.

Fiona fidgeted, twisting the hem of her shirt.

"Believe in yourself." Vivian squeezed her hand. "You're extraordinary. Who knows—you might outgrow him someday."

"Really?"

"Absolutely. Trust me!"

"Okay!" Fiona finally smiled.

Their call lasted much longer than expected. After hanging up, Vivian checked the time—her meeting with Madeline Delmonico should begin soon.

Inside the Delmonico mansion, Madeline's palms were sweating. The hidden camera was in place. She only needed the mysterious figure to appear.

The appointed time came and went. The drawing room remained empty.

Madeline grew uneasy. Had they sensed something? Why hadn't they shown up?
###Chapter 813

Madeline Delmonico paced anxiously across the living room.

The clock's hands had circled several times, eroding her patience. Just as she reached for her phone to call Zoe Chamberlain, a shrill laugh pierced the silence behind her.

"Ha! Looking for me?"

Madeline whirled around.

A stranger had materialized in the Delmonico living room.

Madeline's pupils contracted violently at the familiar-yet-alien face. "V-Vivian...?"

Her breath hitched.

The woman bore an uncanny resemblance to Vivian Laurent—except for the cruel twist in her brows.

Annika Heilbronn lounged on the dining table, legs crossed. "I'm here to kill you, obviously."

Madeline froze, her lungs seizing.

——

Meanwhile.

Vivian and Isabella Langley stared at a computer screen.

The feed from the pinhole camera made both women pale simultaneously.

"Viv...that person..." Isabella's voice trembled. "Isn't that you?"

Had Vivian not been beside her, she'd have sworn the woman onscreen was Vivian herself.

How could two people look so identical?

"That's not me." Vivian's gaze burned through the screen.

The face reminded her of someone—Sophia Evans. But Sophia's resemblance paled compared to this doppelgänger.

——

Madeline's earpiece crackled with a prompt.

She steadied herself. "You're not Vivian Laurent."

Annika smirked. "Of course I'm not that trash." She stroked her cheek. "Is Vivian as beautiful as me?"

Her obsession with her appearance was pathological. She always forced others to acknowledge her superiority.

Madeline's nails dug into her palms as she compared them.

Though their features were similar, Annika's face had an unnatural stiffness, devoid of Vivian's effortless grace.

"Who are you?" Madeline demanded.

Annika crossed her legs. "I heard you wanted to meet me. Let's negotiate terms." Her eyes turned glacial. "Don't even think about refusing—or else—"

"Impossible!" Madeline snapped. "I won't help you smuggle anything."

Annika chuckled. "Fine. I'm sure your husband will cooperate." She adjusted her sleeve with deliberate slowness. "If he refuses...I can always replace him with someone more...compliant."
###Chapter 814

Madeline Delmonico's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"You can't threaten me! My husband is an honest official who's never done anything wrong."

Annika Heilbronn chuckled softly, twirling a teacup between her fingers.

"Honest? That makes him even more vulnerable. Honest people make the easiest targets, don't you think?"

She suddenly leaned in close to Madeline.

"That car accident last month wiped out an entire family of five. Do you really think... it was just an accident?"

Madeline's face turned ghostly pale.

Satisfied with her reaction, Annika rose leisurely.

"You have twenty-four hours to decide. At this time tomorrow, either have your husband waiting for me at home, or..."

She drew a finger across her throat.

Before Madeline could respond, Annika had already vanished around the stairwell.

Stumbling forward, Madeline found the hallway eerily empty.

Her hands trembled as she pressed her earpiece.

"Dr. Laurent... Did you hear that? She's going to kill my husband!"

Vivian Laurent's calm voice responded, "Stay calm. I'll find out who she is."

"She looks exactly like you! She must be your enemy!" Madeline's voice shook.

A brief silence.

"I don't know her. She means nothing to me."

Madeline collapsed to the floor, tears streaming.

"Please, Dr. Laurent, save us! I'll pay any amount!"

Suddenly remembering something, she gasped.

"I can expose your identity online! Prove you're the real Dr. Luna!"

Through the phone, Vivian's eyes flickered.

"Don't act rashly. Wait for my instructions."

The call ended. Madeline buried her face in her hands, sobbing.

Regret consumed her.

If only she hadn't trusted that impostor earlier...

If only she'd believed Vivian sooner...

Now it might be too late.
###Chapter 815

Vivian Laurent reassured her, "Don't panic yet. I'll get to the bottom of this."

"Thanks to your lead, I won't let this slide."

"Thank you, Dr. Luna!" Madeline Delmonico finally exhaled in relief.

After hanging up, Vivian exchanged a glance with Isabella Langley.

"That woman... Have we met her somewhere before?" Isabella mused.

"Summer," Vivian answered instantly.

"The Alpine Resort!" Isabella suddenly remembered.

She recalled the female attendant who had approached Vivian that day—they'd seemed acquainted.

"Investigate," Vivian ordered immediately.

She'd never suspected Summer before. Their encounters had been brief, with no apparent conflict.

The resort's records showed no employee named Summer.

Further digging revealed she'd only appeared that single day.

Clearly premeditated.

Even Summer's injuries at the hospital had been suspicious.

Vivian remembered Summer's sob story about her impoverished background—how she'd even treated her to a meal. Now it seemed even her name might have been fake.

"Fabricated identity," Isabella concluded.

The mall's surveillance footage had already been overwritten. The trail seemed cold.

Then Vivian remembered the child who'd taken Theo.

The kid had admitted to being hired. The description matched Summer perfectly.

"She's been targeting you for a while," Isabella frowned. "Could she be your father's love child?"

"Impossible." Vivian shook her head.

Vincent Valrose had no other daughters.

"Natalie then? Plastic surgery revenge?" Isabella guessed.

Natalie had tried to kill Vivian, only to end up crippled herself.

"She's wheelchair-bound," Vivian dismissed.

Who could it be? The puzzle frustrated her.

This level of elaborate scheming suggested deep-seated hatred.

"Maybe I'm not her real target," Vivian analyzed. "Besides, her skills and background are... unusual."

She'd suspected the Shadow Organization all along.

Why would they come after her?

A sudden thought struck her. She turned to Isabella. "When we rescued Zero... Didn't he mention having a disciple searching for him?"

Isabella thought back. "I think he did."

"What was the disciple's name?" Vivian pressed.
###Chapter 816

Isabella racked her brain but couldn't recall the name of that apprentice.

She rummaged through files until she found the answer: "Summer."

Summer. The season.

Han Xia.

At least one character matched, significantly increasing the likelihood that she was Summer.

If true, all mysteries would unravel.

Since Liam's appearance, strange incidents had occurred one after another.

The mastermind possessed extraordinary abilities—vanishing without a trace while demonstrating exceptional skills.

Only someone trained from childhood within the organization could achieve this.

Especially an apprentice personally mentored by Liam. Their prowess would undoubtedly be top-tier.

The critical question remained: Did Liam know?

Vivian had probed him before. He seemed oblivious. But if it was his apprentice, could he truly be unaware?

"I'll investigate her."

Vivian immediately logged into the Dark Web, searching for Summer's mission records.

Though enigmatic, the Dark Web publicly displayed mission logs. On the Agent Leaderboard, Zero held the top spot, with Shadow close behind.

Despite Vivian's four-year hiatus from missions, her ranking remained solid.

Among the top ten, she recognized most faces—some from their organization, others from rival groups.

Bringing up the rear at tenth place was Summer.

Securing a top-ten position meant formidable skills.

Vivian scrolled through discussion threads and discovered Summer's Chinese name: Annika Heilbronn.

Annika. Han Xia.

The truth emerged. Han Xia was an alias. Annika was her true identity.

After confirmation, Vivian meticulously analyzed Annika's mission records. Though nearly flawless, she spotted inconsistencies.

Blurred photos unmistakably revealed Han Xia's face.

"Han Xia is Summer—Liam's apprentice. What's her endgame? Should we expose her now?"

"Regardless of her motives, confronting her is the only way to stop this. Liam owes me an explanation."

"Do you think Liam's involved?" Isabella pressed.

Vivian hesitated.

"I don't know."

She hoped Liam was ignorant. But with Annika causing such chaos, could the top agent—her mentor—truly remain unaware?

Ethan often said four years could change anyone. She hadn't changed, but others might.

He'd warned that Liam might no longer be the same person. Vivian had dismissed it then. Now, doubt crept in.

She considered Liam a dear friend, someone who'd faced life-and-death situations with her. Though no romantic feelings existed between them, Liam's feelings for her...

Vivian bit her lip, her gaze troubled. She'd always hoped Liam could move on and rebuild his life.

Now, it seemed some things were destined to remain unchanged.
###Chapter 817

The pieces were falling into place.

Sophia Evans' death was likely also the work of this mysterious woman.

Vivian Laurent suddenly recalled a crucial detail from the crime scene. Before dying, Sophia had written half of the character "Lu" on the ground.

Now it made sense. That wasn't pointing to Vivian—but to the woman who shared her face.

Perhaps even Sophia hadn't known the woman's identity, only recognizing Vivian's features in her killer.

Everything clicked.

This Annika Heilbronn must have targeted Bianca Semona and Victoria Roscente too.

She might even be responsible for Bianca's parents' deaths.

Vivian dialed Bianca's number.

"Hello?" Bianca clearly hadn't saved her contact.

"It's Vivian."

The line erupted.

"Vivian? You dare call me? Got a death wish?"

"Bianca, did my last warning go in one ear and out the other? Are you brain-dead?"

Vivian matched her hostility.

"How dare you—"

"Calling you stupid is being kind. Your parents would be rolling in their graves." Vivian cut straight to the chase. "Did a woman who looks like me approach you?"

"How did you—" Bianca caught herself.

She'd slipped up.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

Vivian scoffed. "Planning to warn her? But if you want the truth about your parents' deaths, cooperate. Otherwise, that secret gets buried with you."

Silence stretched.

Vivian knew Bianca wouldn't talk.

Hanging up, Isabella Langley frowned. "You're sure she won't tip Annika off?"

"She's terrified—and desperate for answers." Vivian rubbed her temples. "I'm done being framed. She needs to hear the truth firsthand."

Isabella nodded.

Tomorrow, everything would come to light.

Vivian stayed up all night.

She combed through every file on Annika.

The agent operated with brutal efficiency—every mission reeked of calculated violence.

More disturbing was how Annika deliberately mimicked Vivian's methods.

But the real question was—why such hatred?

They'd never even met.

During Annika's time as "Summer" in their organization, they'd merely shared a passing resemblance.

Yet the surveillance footage from Madeline Delmonico showed Annika's face now eerily mirrored Vivian's.

Clearly, she'd undergone extensive cosmetic surgery.
###Chapter 818

Dawn had barely broken when Vivian Laurent arrived at the Delmonico residence with Bianca Semona in tow.

Madeline Delmonico's tense shoulders relaxed the moment she saw Vivian.

"Dr. Laurent, I didn't sleep a wink last night." Madeline twisted her handkerchief. "What should I do now?"

Vivian gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "Stay calm. Just talk to Annika as usual when she arrives."

Bianca stood nearby, confusion written across her face.

"Vivian, what exactly are you planning?" she finally blurted out.

Vivian shot her a meaningful glance. "You'll learn the truth soon enough."

The two women were instructed to conceal themselves.

Moments later, Annika Heilbronn strode into the parlor, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Madeline, I see you've made your choice?" Annika's lips curled into a cold smile as she surveyed the room.

Madeline forced composure. "I'm still considering—"

"Though you didn't expect to see me here, did you?" Vivian stepped into view.

Annika whirled around, pupils dilating. "Vivian!"

Realization dawned. She'd been set up.

"You're working together against me?" Fury laced Annika's voice.

Vivian advanced slowly. "I prefer to call it exposing the truth."

Annika's expression darkened.

"Annika Heilbronn, Summer, or perhaps you prefer your original name?" Vivian locked eyes with her. "Which do you like best?"

Annika's fingers trembled slightly.

"Stop with the theatrics," she sneered, though her voice lacked conviction.

Vivian remained calm. "Sophia Sherwood's death. Bianca's parents' 'accident.' And let's not forget Sophia Evans..."

"Slander!" Annika snapped.

"All staged to look like accidents with no culprits." Vivian took another step forward. "Who else could orchestrate such perfect crimes?"

Annika's breathing quickened.

"Prove it," she challenged, tilting her chin up.

Vivian produced a file from her bag. "It's all here."

Bianca could no longer contain herself. She rushed forward. "You killed my parents?"

Annika's face drained of color.
###Chapter 819

The scalpel gleamed coldly under the surgical lights.

"Bianca's father's operation was successful." Vivian Laurent tapped the desk lightly. "Too many eyes in the ICU. You didn't dare make your move."

She watched Annika Heilbronn's eyelid twitch.

"Three hours after transferring to the general ward, he flatlined. Perfect timing."

Annika's nails dug into her palms.

"As for her mother..." Vivian chuckled. "That estranged couple would die for each other?"

The monitor's red light blinked rhythmically.

"You left clues deliberately to make Bianca hate me." Vivian suddenly leaned forward. "Even Sophia Evans was your pawn."

Annika's pupils constricted violently.

"Too bad she switched sides last minute. So..." Vivian drew a finger across her throat. "You had to silence her."

The air froze for three seconds.

Hidden in shadows, Bianca Semona bit her lip until blood filled her mouth. She felt no pain.

"Fascinating story." Annika clapped mockingly. "Got proof?"

Vivian pulled out her phone. "Care to hear what your Master Zero has to say?"

Annika's face twisted grotesquely.

"I did it!" She slammed the table, sending IV bottles rattling. "Leave Master out of this! Those trash didn't deserve to live!"

Bianca curled behind the fire extinguisher cabinet. She remembered Annika's gentle handkerchief at her parents' funeral. Those hands had been stained with blood all along.

"Confession?" Vivian pressed record.

Annika suddenly calmed. "You'll never prove it."

Their shadows merged into a monstrous shape on the wall.

Bianca's tears hit the floor silently. She clamped a hand over her mouth, terrified of disrupting this deadly confrontation. Now she understood - even their rooftop "chance meeting" had been another trap.

"Think hiding makes you safe?" Annika suddenly turned toward the fire cabinet.

Bianca's blood turned to ice.
###Chapter 820

"Why do you hate me?"

Vivian Laurent frowned slightly, unable to comprehend the hostility from this stranger. They'd never met before—the name Annika Heilbronn meant nothing to her.

"Because you stole everything that should have been mine!" Annika screamed hysterically. "I've lived in your shadow for four years!"

Her fingers clenched the hem of her shirt until her knuckles turned white.

"Master Zero only took me in because I look like you." Annika's voice trembled. "They all said I wasn't as talented. But I worked harder than you ever did!"

Vivian regarded her coldly.

"For four years, Master searched for you while I was invisible to him." Hatred burned in Annika's eyes. "Now that you're back, he abandoned the entire organization!"

"That's your reason?" Vivian's lips curled in disdain.

"You don't understand anything!" Annika's voice rose sharply. "If not for you, Master would never have changed!"

"Jealousy is an ugly look on you," Vivian said calmly.

"Shut up!" Annika bristled like a provoked cat. "I'm far better than you! You just got there first!"

"Believe what you want." Vivian's tone remained indifferent.

Her gaze dropped to Annika's trembling hands. "So what do you intend to do now?"

"Kill you." The words came through gritted teeth.

Almost simultaneously, Vivian echoed, "Kill me?"

The dark muzzle of a gun pressed against Vivian's forehead.

Madeline Delmonico cowered in the corner, trembling with fear of stray bullets.

Bianca Semona covered her mouth, not daring to breathe.

"You?" Vivian scoffed.

Annika's finger hovered over the trigger. "Let's see who's faster."

The gunshot cracked through the air.

A bullet tore toward Vivian's forehead.
###Chapter 821

The bullet whizzed past Vivian Laurent's temple.

She had anticipated it, effortlessly dodging with a swift sidestep.

"Your marksmanship has declined," Vivian remarked coolly.

Annika Heilbronn's gun hand trembled slightly.

She'd never missed before - these skills were personally taught by Master Zero.

If her mentor knew she couldn't even hit a pregnant woman...

"Don't get cocky!" Annika snarled, firing several rapid shots.

Despite her six-month pregnancy, Vivian moved with impossible agility.

The bullets found only empty air, not even grazing her clothes.

"Seems today isn't your lucky day." Vivian smoothed back stray strands of hair.

Annika's eyes burned with fury. "Vivian Laurent, don't worry - I'll kill you yet!"

Before the words faded, she vaulted onto the windowsill and vanished into the night.

The Langley residence lay in shambles.

Vivian dialed Isabella Langley. "She fled west."

"Leave it to me." Isabella's voice was ice.

Hanging up, Vivian approached Bianca Semona cowering in the corner.

"Heard everything?" She yanked the trembling woman out.

Bianca's face was bloodless, her entire body shaking.

"You'll make a public statement to the media tomorrow," Vivian commanded.

"No!" Bianca shrieked. "She'll murder me!"

Vivian's laugh was cold. "You think hiding will keep you safe?"

Bianca's nails dug into her palms.

She stole a glance at Vivian, warring internally.

"Why... why should I trust you?"

Vivian didn't bother responding, turning instead to the shaken Madeline Delmonico.

"I'll compensate for the damages."

Madeline clutched her sleeve. "Dr. Luna, please protect us!"

Her voice trembled. "That woman is terrifying..."
###Chapter 822

"She can't touch you for now." Vivian Laurent's tone was firm.

Madeline Delmonico exhaled in relief, clasping her hands together. "If we get through this safely, I'll give you anything you want!"

"Don't trust people so easily." Vivian narrowed her eyes. "What if I'm the villain? What if I blackmail you too?"

Madeline stumbled back, her gaze sharpening with suspicion.

Vivian chuckled. "Just joking. But your reaction is perfect—keep that up."

"Dr. Luna has quite the sense of humor," Madeline forced a strained smile.

With Annika Heilbronn gone, there was no reason for Vivian to stay.

"I'm leaving." She turned away. "Install surveillance and hire bodyguards."

"It'll be done immediately!" Madeline nodded frantically.

Bianca Semona rushed after her. "Wait for me!"

She reached for the car door.

"What do you think you're doing?" Vivian blocked her.

"I'm safer with you," Bianca insisted urgently.

Vivian scoffed. "Annika wants me dead. If she can't kill me, she'll go after those close to me. Still sure?"

Bianca paled.

Then she remembered. "You promised to protect me! As long as I cleared your name!"

"Clear it now, and I'll keep my word." Vivian's voice was cool.

"No!" Bianca shook her head. "Capture that woman first!"

"You don't trust me, so why should I trust you?" Vivian smirked. "If you don't speak up today, you're on your own."

Bianca trembled.

She couldn't take that risk.

"I'll do it!" She gritted her teeth. "But you have to guarantee my safety."

"One more thing." Vivian added, "Publicly admit I'm Dr. Luna."

"Fine." Bianca agreed.

The deal was struck. Bianca hastily contacted the media while Vivian had Isabella Langley release the damning recording.
###Chapter 823

The recording detonated across the internet like a bomb.

Zoe Chamberlain's confession rang clear—she admitted to not being Dr. Luna. More shockingly, she'd been controlling patients with narcotics, forcing them to do her bidding.

Madeline Delmonico's voice cut through next: "Vivian Laurent is the real Dr. Luna."

The audio shattered Zoe's carefully constructed facade.

Online chaos erupted.

"Zoe's a fraud? And she drugged people?"

"I can't believe it! She seemed so genuine."

"Where are all the people who vilified Vivian? They owe her an apology."

"How do we know this recording isn't fake?"

"If it's fabricated, why hasn't Zoe denied it?"

As debates raged, Madeline Delmonico stepped forward with a video statement.

"I was Zoe's patient, paying millions in medical fees," she revealed, her face grave. "Until I discovered she'd been feeding me morphine."

The footage showed Madeline's hands trembling. "She blackmailed my husband into smuggling operations. Without Dr. Laurent's intervention, I might not be alive today."

"I stake my reputation on this—Vivian is the true Dr. Luna. That car accident was Zoe's doing to silence the truth."

More victims emerged.

"Zoe used drugs to control us, making us her puppets."

Bianca Semona broke her silence publicly.

"Dr. Laurent, I'm sorry." Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. "You saved my father, yet I—"

"Now I understand. The real villain was someone else entirely."

"Vivian is Dr. Luna—the genius physician who deserves that title."

With the truth exposed, public opinion shifted irrevocably.
###Chapter 824

Public opinion shifted overnight.

Bianca Semona, who had once led the accusations against Vivian Laurent for murder, now stood before cameras issuing a public apology.

Trending lists were instantly flooded with hashtags like #VivianLaurentTruth and #BiancaSemonaApology.

"Where are those who shouted the loudest insults? Care to show yourselves now?"

"The irony—a life-saving doctor framed as a murderer."

"Dr. Laurent saved so many lives. Don't you feel any guilt?"

The comment section erupted.

Yet skeptical voices still surfaced.

"Who's to say she wasn't threatened?"

"Maybe Vivian has powerful backers."

Bianca faced the cameras, her voice steady. "No one threatened me. I simply saw the truth at last."

She bowed deeply.

"I'm sorry, Dr. Laurent."

Public opinion split.

Most netizens chose to believe Vivian.

"Dr. Laurent suffered so much—impersonated and scapegoated."

"Good deeds go punished these days."

"We stand with Dr. Laurent!"

Vivian scrolled through her phone, a faint smile touching her lips.

All she'd ever wanted was justice.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"I did everything you asked!" Bianca's voice trembled. "That madwoman won't let me go!"

"Find Finn Deross," Vivian replied calmly. "Use my name."

Meanwhile, at an abandoned factory on the outskirts...

Annika Heilbronn was cornered.

"Save your breath," Isabella Langley sneered, ripping off her mask. "A counterfeit will always be a counterfeit."

The face that had mimicked Vivian's now twisted in fury.
###Chapter 825 

Annika Heilbronn's wrists were cuffed to the chair, her eyes burning with hatred.

She glared at Isabella Langley, teeth grinding audibly.

"What's so special about that bitch Vivian Laurent? Why do you all protect her?"

Isabella curled her lips in disdain, lifting Annika's chin with one finger.

"You had plastic surgery to copy someone else's face, yet you still have the audacity to act righteous?"

Annika violently jerked her head away.

"You know nothing!"

"Maybe I don't." Isabella took a step back, crossing her arms. "But I do know those who repay kindness with betrayal belong in hell."

Annika suddenly burst into maniacal laughter.

"Hell? I've been living in hell for years!"

Isabella regarded her coldly.

"Then stay there."

The scent of tea greeted Vivian as she pushed open Liam Valdemar's door.

He sat by the window, sunlight casting a soft halo around him.

"Shadow, you're here."

His voice remained gentle, as if nothing had happened.

Vivian didn't move from the doorway.

"You sent Annika."

It wasn't a question.

Liam's hand paused, ripples forming in his teacup.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"She killed seventeen people." Vivian enunciated each word. "All while wearing my face."

Liam set down his cup with a sigh.

"Shadow, perhaps you're overworked."

Vivian suddenly smiled.

"Master Zero... this is the last time I'll call you that."

Liam's expression finally shifted.

"Annika was my apprentice, but she left the organization long ago."

"Really?" Vivian pulled out her phone. "Then explain this."

The screen displayed surveillance footage.

As Liam watched, his face gradually paled.

"I..."

"You used her." Vivian pocketed her phone. "Just like you used me."

Liam stood abruptly.

"It wasn't like that!"

Vivian turned toward the door.

"See you in court, Zero."
###Chapter 826

"Did you truly know nothing about Annika's crimes?"

Liam's brow furrowed slightly. "What has she done?"

"Sophia Sherwood, Bianca Semona's parents, Sophia Evans..." Vivian listed each offense coldly. "She even impersonated Dr. Luna's identity."

Liam's pupils constricted sharply. "She dared to—"

Vivian studied his reaction intently. "You really didn't know?"

"If I say no, you won't believe me." Liam gave a bitter smile. "During our hot springs meeting, she only asked me to return to the organization."

"I refused. Told her to keep my existence secret. I assumed she'd stay quietly within the ranks..."

His voice darkened. "If she's truly crossed the line, I'll discipline her as her master."

"This isn't about discipline." Vivian's tone sharpened. "These are criminal offenses."

Liam's gaze turned shadowed. "I understand. But if she's prosecuted, the organization will discover we're still alive."

"Then..." He paused. "I'll take full responsibility."

"That's not what I meant!" Vivian protested urgently.

Liam raised a silencing hand. "You've always upheld justice. The fault lies with us. The punishment should be ours."

The doorbell chimed abruptly.

Turning, Liam opened the door to find Lucas and Isabella restraining a bound Annika.

Duct tape sealed the young agent's mouth, but her eyes burned with feral defiance.

Isabella smirked coldly. "Keep glaring and I'll gouge those eyes out myself."

"We caught her." Lucas looked to Vivian. "Your call on handling this."

Annika locked eyes with Liam for one fractured second. His gaze was glacial.

She understood instantly—her master must never be implicated.
###Chapter 827

Vivian Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Weren't you boasting about taking my life? Now that your master is here, why don't you seize the opportunity?"

Annika Heilbronn stood rigid in the corner, her spine straight. The ruthless aura around her was unmistakably similar to Zero's.

Liam Valdemar spoke suddenly, his voice icy. "Kneel."

Annika's knees hit the ground with a heavy thud. "Master."

"Vivian told me about your recent actions." Zero's fingertip traced the rim of his teacup. "Annika, you've disappointed me."

"Forgive me, Master." Annika raised her hand and struck her own cheek with brutal force. The sharp slap echoed through the room, leaving her face swollen and red.

Isabella Langley, standing nearby, instinctively touched her own face.

These slaps were nothing to Annika. The real punishments within the organization were excruciating beyond imagination.

"I demand an explanation." Zero's tone held no emotion. "Do you understand what you've done?"

"It's my fault." Annika pressed her forehead to the floor. "I was jealous of Vivian. I thought you abandoned the organization because of her..."

She took full responsibility, making it seem as though Zero had no prior knowledge.

The Annika kneeling now was a far cry from the arrogant woman she'd been moments ago.

"And for that, you killed so many?"

"Master, I accept any punishment." Her voice trembled. "I know the rules—absolute obedience."

Vivian watched coldly. She knew the organization's laws too well—orders from superiors were absolute. Lower-ranking members had no right to defend themselves.

In that brutal world, every trial was like pitting scorpions in a jar—only one would emerge alive.

The organization's punishments were horrifying. Beatings and electric shocks were mere appetizers. In severe cases, limbs were severed. And betrayal? That only ended in death.

"Shadow, I need time to investigate." Zero turned to Vivian. "If her crimes are confirmed, Annika is yours to deal with."

"No!" Annika suddenly lunged forward, clinging to Zero's feet. "Master, please don't hand me over to them!"

Vivian narrowed her eyes. She saw through the act—Zero was protecting Annika. The organization would never allow one of their own to fall into police hands.

Especially since Zero had a special relationship with the Director. He was likely the next successor. Getting Annika out would only be a matter of time.

Annika's desperate performance only exposed their scheme.
###Chapter 828

Vivian gave a slight nod, signaling Isabella to take Annika away.

"Master Zero! Please don't abandon me!" Annika screamed, struggling against the restraints.

Liam stood with his back to her, unmoving.

"I'll continue investigating," Vivian said, locking eyes with him. "If you truly knew nothing, that's for the best."

But if he had condoned it—or worse, ordered it...

Liam gave a bitter smile. "Shadow, you may not think me a good man, but I swear I knew nothing about this. I have my limits. I don't condone murder."

"Good." Vivian turned away. "Get some rest."

Downstairs, Isabella was waiting.

"What should we do with her?" She gestured to the restrained Annika.

"Call the police." Vivian rubbed her temples. "Post guards. Don't let her escape."

With the mastermind finally caught, this ordeal was over at last.

Days of relentless pursuit had left Vivian exhausted. She desperately needed sleep.

Tomorrow was her prenatal checkup. She had to find a way to avoid Ethan.

The bigger problem was arranging to leave the country soon. Her growing belly made staying here too dangerous.

Ethan could discover the truth any moment. And there were always threats like Annika lurking in the shadows.

With a sigh, Vivian pushed open the car door.

A familiar black Maybach was parked at the entrance. Ethan leaned against it, waiting.

Spotting her, he strode forward and opened the passenger door.

"Got her?" His gaze burned with intensity.

Vivian nodded. "Mm."

The internet was already exploding. Night's true identity had been exposed. The mastermind was in custody.

"What's next?"

She hesitated. "That police friend of yours..."

"Patrick Alpinus?"

"Yes." An ordinary officer wouldn't stand a chance against Annika. As an Interpol agent with uncompromising integrity, Patrick might be trustworthy.

But this case involved their organization. The risks were too high.

"I'll contact him." Ethan offered his arm. "Let's get inside."

"Thank you," Vivian murmured.

Ethan paused mid-step, lips curving. "Since when do we say 'thank you'?"

His warm palm cradled her elbow with infinite care, as though she were something precious and fragile.
###Chapter 829

"We don't need thanks between strangers." Vivian's voice was calm.

Ethan's breath hitched.

He knew she was deliberately provoking him, yet each word struck his chest like a hammer.

Every inch of progress he'd made was instantly erased by her cold dismissal.

"Who said we're strangers? You—"

He caught himself just in time.

"Hmm?" Vivian lifted her gaze.

He'd almost blurted it out: How can we be strangers when you're carrying my child?

That would have revealed everything.

"At the very least, we were married once," he amended. "It's only right that I help you."

"Were being the key word." Her tone remained indifferent. "There's no need now."

"The past doesn't dictate the future." Ethan's gaze burned into her. "No one can predict what's to come."

"Ethan Roscente!" She wanted to shake sense into him.

But seeing his stubborn expression, she swallowed her words.

Exhaustion washed over her as she leaned back into the sofa.

"I'll contact Patrick." Ethan stood. "Wait for me."

"Fine."

The phone rang just as Patrick Alpinus had finally fallen asleep.

"Ethan!" He ground his teeth. "I haven't slept in three days—just caught a drug trafficker—"

"I'm delivering you a gift." Ethan cut him off.

"What gift?" Patrick was instantly alert.

"Heard about the domestic serial killings?"

"People die every day." Patrick scoffed. "Local jurisdiction handles those—"

"Sophia Evans is dead."

Patrick's breath froze.

"You caught the killer?"

"Not just her." Ethan's voice turned grave. "Bianca Semona's parents, Sophia Sherwood—likely all the same perpetrator."

"You're certain?" Patrick's voice tightened.

"DarkKingdom operative." Ethan enunciated each word. "Ranked tenth on the Dark Web—Annika Heilbronn."

"Annika?!" Patrick shot upright. "You have Annika?"

Members of that shadow organization were notoriously elusive. Years of investigations had yielded nothing.

And now...
###Chapter 830

"Interested?"

"Absolutely! How could I refuse such a major case? When do we leave?" Patrick Alpinus's voice brimmed with barely contained excitement.

Ethan Roscente replied calmly, "Not yet. Wait for my instructions."

Hanging up, Ethan turned toward Vivian Laurent on the sofa.

She had fallen asleep without him noticing.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting delicate shadows from her long lashes across her flawless face. The interplay of light and shadow only enhanced her ethereal beauty.

Ethan found himself mesmerized.

From every angle, she was breathtaking.

Simply watching her sleep filled him with quiet contentment.

Moving carefully, he picked up a nearby throw blanket and draped it over her.

Vivian's hand rested protectively over her abdomen, as if instinctively shielding something precious.

Ethan's gaze softened.

Time seemed to accelerate.

Suddenly, Vivian's eyes flew open, locking onto his intense stare.

"What are you doing?" She bolted upright, heart pounding.

"Nothing," Ethan raised his hands innocently.

"Then why were you staring at me?"

"Just looking."

Vivian dismissed the argument with a sigh, checking the time. "What did your friend say?"

"It's handled. Need more rest?"

"No." She rubbed her temples, puzzled by her sudden drowsiness.

"Free tomorrow?" Vivian asked abruptly.

"Yes."

"I need a favor."

Ethan arched a brow. "What kind?"

"An important document needs delivering to the neighboring city. I don't trust anyone else with it."

She needed him gone.

Tomorrow was her scheduled prenatal checkup. With Ethan hovering, she'd never slip away unnoticed.

Previously, she'd tried having Lucas Lefèvre distract him, but that plan had too many holes.

Theo Evans could've kept him occupied at Disneyland, but Ethan might just pawn the boy off on someone else and follow her instead.

"No problem," Ethan agreed readily.

An awkward silence settled.

Vivian frowned. "Why are you still here?"

"Can't I stay a little longer?"

"No."

"Actually, there's something else," Ethan lied smoothly.

Even one extra minute with her was worth the deception.

"What now?" Vivian eyed him suspiciously.

Did this man ever have anything better to do?
###Chapter 831

"I was just worried about you. The online backlash is overwhelming. I feared it might be too much for you to handle."

"You've known me for years. Do I seem like someone who'd be affected by this?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.

Ethan studied her for a long moment before conceding she truly didn’t care.

"No."

"I'm perfectly fine. The internet is clearing my name. I couldn’t be happier."

"Hmm."

A faint smile tugged at Ethan's lips.

"What are you smiling about?"

Vivian narrowed her eyes at him.

Ethan usually wore an icy demeanor, his sharp features radiating an unapproachable aura.

But lately, he’d been smiling more—each time devastatingly handsome.

She’d warned herself a thousand times not to fall for it, yet every glimpse of that face softened her resolve.

That face was his ultimate weapon.

"Seeing you happy makes me happy."

"Are you an idiot?"

"Even your insults make me happy."

Vivian exhaled in exasperation.

Talking to Ethan was impossible.

But since he refused to leave, she had no choice but to let him stay.

Meanwhile, Zoe Chamberlain curled into a ball in her apartment.

The relentless online vitriol suffocated her.

She kept refreshing the screen, watching praise for Vivian flood every corner.

"Vivian is incredible! So many hidden talents—a true genius!"

"Who does Zoe think she is, impersonating Dr. Luna?"

"Disgrace to medical students! I’d be too ashamed to live!"

"Murderer! Those innocent lives she destroyed!"

"What kind of parents raise a monster like her? They should disown her!"

Each comment stabbed like a knife.

She wanted to explain, to scream that she’d been forced—but no one would listen.

For the first time in her privileged life, she tasted true despair.

Tears streamed down her face unchecked.

Then her phone rang.

Caller ID: Vivian Laurent.
###Chapter 832

The phone screen lit up with Vivian Laurent's name flashing accusingly.

Zoe Chamberlain stared at the name, her fingers trembling.

The internet was flooded with praise for Vivian, while she had become public enemy number one.

She slammed the reject button and threw the phone onto the couch.

The ringing started again, shrill and relentless like a death knell.

"Vivian!" Zoe snatched up the phone. "Happy now? The whole world worships you while cursing me! But I was forced into this!"

A soft chuckle came through the receiver.

"Poor Zoe," Vivian's voice was terrifyingly calm. "Still making excuses."

Zoe clenched her fist.

"People hate you because you deserve it," Vivian enunciated each word. "Tell me honestly - are they wrong?"

Zoe's chest heaved violently.

"What? Called just to lecture me?" she spat through gritted teeth.

"I'm not your teacher," Vivian's tone turned icy. "Let's meet."

"No!"

"Scared?" Vivian suddenly lowered her voice. "I know about your backer. The one who looks like me."

Zoe's breath hitched.

"Want your old life back?" Vivian's words slithered into her ear like a venomous snake.

Zoe's fingers dug unconsciously into the couch.

Of course she did. But that person terrified her.

"What...do you really want?" Zoe's voice wavered.

"Face to face." A pause. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you."

Zoe stared at the night outside her window.

Meeting Vivian was dangerous. But maybe...this was her only chance.

"Location," she finally said.

After hanging up, Zoe immediately opened a recording app.

If Vivian tried anything, she'd expose this "perfect goddess" to the entire world.
###Chapter 833

Vivian chose the Starbucks below Zoe's apartment building.

Zoe agreed without hesitation.

She hung up and immediately changed clothes to go downstairs.

Vivian, however, was delayed.

Ethan insisted on accompanying her, saying Zoe was emotionally unstable and he didn't trust her to meet alone.

In the end, Ethan drove her there.

Thirty minutes later, the black Maybach parked outside the café.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Vivian spotted Zoe fidgeting in the corner.

She kept checking her phone.

Only when Vivian walked in did Zoe's tense shoulders relax slightly.

Zoe's outfit was bizarre today.

A baseball cap pulled low, sunglasses covering half her face, and a scarf wrapped tightly around her chin.

She looked like a celebrity dodging paparazzi.

In reality, she just didn't want to be recognized.

The online hate was bad enough. If someone pointed fingers at her in public, she might break down.

Two girls at the next table kept glancing her way, whispering. It made her skin crawl.

Little did she know they were just guessing if she was some influencer.

"Ms. Chamberlain." Vivian took the seat across from her.

Zoe's head snapped up, her eyes darting between Vivian and Ethan. "What do you want?"

"Scared now?" Vivian smirked.

"Stop pretending!" Zoe gritted her teeth. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this mess!"

A soft gasp came from another table.

"Oh my god, is that Vivian Laurent? She's even prettier in person!"

"Is that Ethan Roscente from Roscente Group next to her? So handsome!"

Zoe's face darkened. "You did this on purpose? Picked this place so everyone can see how pathetic I am?"

Vivian nearly rolled her eyes.

This woman's paranoia was off the charts.

"You're the one acting suspicious." Vivian stirred her coffee calmly. "If you've got nothing to hide, why the disguise?"

Zoe clenched her fists. "Cut the crap! Why did you call me here?"

Her heart pounded.

If Annika found out she met with Vivian...

Just thinking about that woman's methods sent chills down her spine.

"You once said," Vivian spoke leisurely, "if I was really capable, I should expose the person behind you."

Zoe's pupils contracted.

"Now I've caught her."

"Impossible!" Zoe shot up, her chair screeching.

There was no way someone as powerful as Annika could...

"Her name's Annika Heilbronn, right?" Vivian met her gaze. "She looks just like me."

Zoe froze.

"Today at Madeline Delmonico's place, she slipped up." Vivian pulled out her phone. "Want to see the photo?"

On the screen was Annika, bound and being shoved into a car.
###Chapter 834

Zoe Chamberlain stared at the photo on her phone screen, her fingertips trembling slightly.

The image showed Annika Heilbronn handcuffed to an interrogation chair, her usually sneering face now pale as paper.

"This can't be..." Zoe murmured to herself.

She knew Annika's methods better than anyone. That woman was like a venomous snake, always lurking in the shadows.

"Ready to talk now?" Vivian Laurent's voice snapped her back to reality.

Zoe jerked her head up, eyes bloodshot. "You're lying! There's no way she'd get caught so easily!"

Vivian slid the phone forward. "Should I arrange a meeting so you can see for yourself?"

"No!" Zoe shrieked, recoiling so violently she nearly toppled from her chair.

That nightmare of a woman. She'd destroyed everything.

Once a medical prodigy, the pride of a century-old pharmaceutical family, now reduced to public enemy number one.

"If she's already caught, why come to me?" Zoe's voice quivered.

Vivian met her gaze squarely. "Because you owe the victims an explanation."

Zoe's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Let me guess—you just want the Night identity."

"Correct." Vivian didn't deny it. "But more importantly, that name can't keep being used to harm people."

Zoe's nails dug into her palms.

The Night codename had once been her shield. Now it was her death warrant.

"I won't go public." She bit her lip. "The online hate...I can't take it..."

Vivian's eyes turned sharp. "The people you poisoned suffered a thousand times worse."

Zoe flinched.

"During withdrawal, they felt like ants were gnawing their bones." Vivian spoke each word deliberately. "Yet you lack even the courage to face your mistakes."

"It wasn't my fault!" Zoe clutched her head, sobbing. "Annika forced me—"

"Every victim had a family." Vivian's voice cut like a blade. "When parents watched their children writhe in agony, who should they blame?"

Zoe collapsed against the chair, tears blurring her vision.

"Telling the truth is your only chance at redemption." Vivian offered a tissue. "Your parents' clinic, your grandfather's reputation—they hang in the balance."

"Annika said..." Zoe's voice shrank to a whisper. "If I talked..."

Vivian suddenly grasped her shaking hand. "She can't touch you now. My promise stands—testify, and I'll protect you and your family."

The interrogation room lights cast deep shadows across Zoe's face.
###Chapter 835

Zoe Chamberlain stared at Vivian Laurent with turbulent emotions swirling in her eyes.

Her fingers twisted together unconsciously, knuckles turning white.

"Why should I trust you?" Zoe's voice trembled.

She remembered every terrible thing she'd done—each one enough to make Vivian despise her.

How could Vivian possibly want to help her?

Once the truth came out, she'd be ruined forever.

And Vivian?

That brilliant name would shine again, admired by everyone.

"Suit yourself." Vivian's tone was indifferent.

As she turned to leave, Zoe suddenly grabbed her sleeve.

"They won't let me go..." Zoe whispered, barely audible.

The memory of those powerful figures' cold stares made her shiver.

The look Madeline Delmonico gave her before leaving had chilled her to the bone.

"You know the truth." Vivian paused. "They won't care if you were coerced."

Tears spilled from Zoe's eyes without warning.

She collapsed to the floor, sobbing like a child.

Her perfect makeup smeared, the image of a privileged heiress completely shattered.

"I had no choice..." Her voice hitched. "They threatened my parents..."

Ethan Roscente watched coldly before speaking.

"Apologize or die. Choose."

His voice cut through her last shred of hope like a blade.

Zoe jerked her head up, meeting his icy gaze.

"I...I'll apologize..." she stammered.

Vivian handed her a tissue. "Hand over all the evidence. Make a public statement."

Zoe clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

"You have to guarantee my safety," she said through gritted teeth.

"Done." Vivian's reply was crisp.

With shaking hands, Zoe pulled out her phone and pressed record.

"Remember your promise." Her eyes were red.

Vivian smiled faintly. "I always keep my word."

Looking at Zoe's pitiful state, she sighed inwardly.

This girl should have been saving lives in an operating room.

Maybe this lesson would help her find her way back.
###Chapter 836

Zoe Chamberlain stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling slightly.

Countless supportive comments flooded Vivian Laurent's social media account.

The genuine praise and trust shook Zoe for the first time.

Annika Heilbronn relied on threats and coercion.

But Vivian was different.

Vivian sincerely helped everyone in need.

Zoe took a deep breath and decided to gamble.

She chose to trust Vivian just once.

As Vivian stood to leave, Zoe suddenly called out.

"Wait."

Vivian turned, her gaze calm.

"Aren't you angry with me?" Zoe's voice quivered. "Don't you want revenge?"

Vivian shook her head gently.

"What good would hating you do?"

"You've already faced consequences for your mistakes."

She paused, her eyes resolute.

"I'd rather see you become a good doctor who learns from this."

Zoe's eyes reddened instantly.

She expected a storm of retaliation.

Instead, she received unexpected mercy.

Before leaving, Vivian gave her one last look.

"Don't disappoint your parents' expectations."

The words struck Zoe like a hammer to the heart.

That evening.

Zoe turned on her live stream camera.

She appeared makeup-free, her face pale.

The chat exploded instantly.

"Hello everyone, I'm Zoe Chamberlain."

Her voice was soft but clear.

"I want to publicly apologize to Dr. Vivian Laurent."

Viewership skyrocketed.

"I impersonated Dr. Luna's identity—an unforgivable crime."

She bowed deeply to the camera.

"Worse still, I poisoned patients."

Her voice cracked.

"I betrayed my Hippocratic Oath."

Hateful comments flooded the chat.

But Zoe didn't back down.

"I know apologies change nothing."

"But I swear to spend my life making amends."

She lifted her head, determination in her eyes.

"Please give me a chance to redeem myself."

"I'll prove it through actions."

After the stream, #ZoeApologizes trended at number one.

The internet erupted in debate.

Some condemned her while others advocated for second chances.

Meanwhile.

Vivian watched it all after finishing surgery.

She quietly closed her phone.

A faint smile of approval touched her lips.
###Chapter 837

"Zoe Chamberlain actually came forward to support Vivian Laurent! What a plot twist!"

"Where are all those internet trolls now? Finally realized who the real Dr. Luna is?"

"Vivian just served the most epic comeback! Zoe pretended so hard, only to admit she's the impostor!"

"Open your eyes, people! Vivian is the true miracle doctor! How's that crow taste, haters?"

While the internet exploded, Vivian had already returned home.

Warm water cascaded over her exhausted body as rose petals floated gently on the surface.

Finally, some much-needed rest.

The bathroom door suddenly swung open.

"Get out!" Vivian hurled a bath sponge toward the intruder.

Ethan Roscente sidestepped with feline grace.

"Such hostility?" He leaned against the doorframe, gaze smoldering.

"I thought you left." Vivian sank deeper into the water.

"Had a sudden thought," Ethan said leisurely, unfastening his cufflinks. "Perhaps my darling Vivian requires...special attention."

Rose petals rippled as she shifted position.

"Disappear. Now."

He was already beside the bathtub, looking down at her.

The blush-colored water concealed everything beneath.

"Just offering a massage." He rolled up his sleeves.

Vivian gritted her teeth. "I could neuter you right now."

"Live fast, die young." Ethan bent closer.

His gaze dropped to her flushed lips.

A visible swallow.

"May I kiss you?"

The searing kiss landed before she could answer.
###Chapter 838

Vivian gritted her teeth in frustration.

This man was always so domineering!

She glared at Ethan's handsome face mere inches away, her fists clenched so tightly they turned white.

But Ethan was faster, capturing her wrists in his grasp.

His palms burned against her skin, completely enveloping her clenched fists.

His lips remained pressed firmly against hers.

How could he let such an opportunity slip away?

He knew his methods weren't exactly honorable.

But for Vivian, he was willing to play the villain.

The kiss was deep and lingering.

A soft moan escaped Vivian's lips. "Mmm..."

When had Ethan become such a skilled kisser?

Her entire body burned with heat, making her wonder if he'd drugged her.

Time lost meaning.

Her waist grew weak, her body threatening to slip into the bathtub.

Ethan caught her just in time. "Vivian, want me to make you feel even better?"

His touch was like fire.

Everywhere his hands traveled left trails of scorching heat.

"No!" Vivian stubbornly protested.

But her body betrayed her.

"Let me help you," Ethan murmured temptingly.

"Get lost!" She pushed against him with all her strength.

She wasn't usually this reserved.

But the baby in her womb couldn't withstand such excitement.

If he found out...

She couldn't take that risk.

"Fine, I'll go." Ethan finally relented.

But not before stealing one last kiss.

"Call me if you need anything."

"Just leave already!"

Vivian seethed with frustration.

That bastard had the audacity to tease her and then walk away!

Next time, she'd make sure he experienced this torment too.

After Ethan left,

she tried taking matters into her own hands.

But nothing felt right.

Was there something special about his touch?

Damn it!

Forced to endure the discomfort, she hastily finished her bath.

That night,

she dreamed of Ethan pinning her down, kissing her senseless.

At the most intense moment,

he suddenly stopped.

The emptiness drove her mad.

In the dream,

she reached for him.

They did everything they shouldn't.

Ethan held her close and whispered, "I knew you were pregnant all along."

Vivian jolted awake.

Her body was drenched in cold sweat.

The dream felt too real.

Shame burned her cheeks.

This was all Ethan's fault!
###Chapter 839

Vivian adjusted her collar in the mirror and texted Ethan Roscente: "Did you deliver the items?"

His reply popped up instantly: "Of course. I'd never neglect anything you ask of me."

A faint smile touched her lips as she slipped the phone into her bag.

Unbeknownst to her, Ethan watched from his car as her slender figure disappeared through the hospital doors.

"Simon, handle the delivery," Ethan ordered, his gaze never leaving her.

He knew exactly where she was headed.

The maternity ward's sign gleamed conspicuously under the sunlight.

Inside the ultrasound room, Vivian lay on the examination table, eyes fixed on the screen.

"The fetus is developing well," the doctor pointed at the image. "Significant growth since the last scan."

Vivian gently caressed her abdomen, warmth flickering in her eyes.

"Dr. Laurent, the father..." Dr. Yang hesitated.

Hospital rumors about the Roscente CEO and the renowned surgeon had reached her ears, yet Vivian always came alone.

"He's dead," Vivian stated calmly. "Just treat me as any other expectant mother. First names are fine."

Dr. Yang fumbled, nearly dropping the chart.

After the exam, Vivian left with her report.

Ten minutes later, the door swung open again.

Dr. Yang looked up, her pupils dilating. "M-Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan strode in, his tailored suit and commanding presence filling the room.

"My wife just had her prenatal checkup here," he said without preamble.

"W-Wife?" Her voice trembled.

"Vivian." His tone softened imperceptibly at her name.

Dr. Yang's pen clattered onto the desk.

Vivian's earlier words—"he's dead"—echoed in her mind as she stared at the very much alive CEO.

"I want to see the reports." His tone brooked no argument.

He needed to know everything about their child.

Before Vivian, fatherhood had never crossed his mind.

Now, he ached to witness every moment of this little life's journey.

His gaze lingered on the ultrasound image.

Their child.
###Chapter 840

"I'm sorry, patient confidentiality prevents me from sharing medical records." Dr. Yang adjusted her glasses firmly.

"That's my wife." Ethan Roscente's voice was low. "I just want to see our baby's ultrasound."

He'd never seen the tiny life growing inside Vivian. Didn't know if their child had his features or hers.

"But Dr. Laurent mentioned...the father was..." Dr. Yang hesitated.

Ethan's expression darkened.

Vivian had been spreading that lie everywhere?

"We had a minor disagreement." He massaged his temples. "As the father, wanting to see my own child isn't unreasonable, is it?"

After a pause, Dr. Yang pulled up the scan.

"Twenty-six weeks along. Perfectly healthy." She pointed at the screen. "Though the mother needs more nutrients."

Ethan stared at the grainy image.

A tiny human form, already kicking and stretching in the amniotic fluid. In four months, this little life would enter the world.

An unfamiliar warmth bloomed in his chest.

"May I have a printout?" His eyes remained fixed on the screen.

Once approved, he carefully folded the report into his suit's inner pocket.

"Please don't tell Dr. Laurent I was here." He gave a final instruction before leaving.

Dr. Yang nodded reluctantly.

His phone buzzed the moment he stepped outside—seventeen missed calls from Patrick Alpinus.

"Finally!" Patrick's exaggerated voice came through. "Where's Annika? When do I get to see her?"

Ethan vaguely recalled mentioning it yesterday.

"You're at the airport?"

"Obviously! Come get me!"

Checking his watch, Ethan found himself with rare free time.

Thirty minutes later, his car idled at the arrivals terminal.

"Ethan!" Patrick sprinted over with his luggage, eyes wide. "You're driving yourself? Did Roscente Group go bankrupt?"

He reached for the door handle. "Getting chauffeured by the CEO—now that's an honor."

Ethan slammed the door shut. "Dream on."
###Chapter 841

Ethan Roscente flicked his wrist, sending the car keys arcing through the air.

Patrick Alpinus caught them reflexively, the cold metal startling him.

"Drive," Ethan commanded.

"Me?" Patrick pointed at himself.

Ethan arched a brow. "Should I be your chauffeur?"

Only Vivian Laurent could make him play driver.

He slid into the passenger seat with effortless grace.

Sighing, Patrick took the wheel and started the engine.

"How did you pull off the Annika Heilbronn operation?" Patrick couldn't resist asking. "She's an international agent."

Ethan kept his gaze forward. "Think it was easy?"

"Just who is Vivian Laurent?" Patrick's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

A smirk tugged at Ethan's lips. "My wife."

"Ex-wife," Patrick corrected.

"We'll remarry." Ethan's tone left no room for doubt.

Patrick chuckled. "Who was it that swore he'd never marry Vivian?"

"Shut it." Ethan's ears turned pink.

"Regretting your words now?" Patrick teased.

Ethan turned away. "Focus on driving."

"Where to? Straight to Vivian's?"

"Take a detour first." Ethan checked his watch.

"Two grown men joyriding?"

"Do it." Ethan's voice brooked no argument.

He needed to maintain the illusion of just returning.

At three in the afternoon, they finally arrived at Vivian's residence.

Patrick went straight to the point upon entering. "Where's Annika? I'm taking this case."

Vivian smiled. "She's in the basement."

"Perfect!" Patrick's eyes lit up. "She's connected to multiple transnational crimes."

"Then we'll leave it to Agent Alpinus." Vivian nodded politely.

Patrick waved a hand. "My pleasure. That woman's as slippery as they come."

Ethan stood to the side, his gaze never leaving Vivian.
###Chapter 842

Ethan Roscente grew increasingly clingy toward her.

Vivian Laurent arranged a private meeting with Patrick Alpinus.

She revealed every detail about Annika Heilbronn's background to the Interpol agent.

"She's dangerous," Vivian warned. "Given the chance, she'll retaliate against you."

Patrick's expression remained resolute. "As law enforcement, we're prepared for risks. Annika has blood on her hands—she must face justice."

Vivian nodded. "Then I leave it to you."

"It's my duty."

Annika had been temporarily held by Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre before being officially transferred to Patrick's custody.

The handover was completed swiftly, with Annika secured in detention.

Vivian dialed Liam Valdemar's number.

"Annika's been arrested," she stated bluntly.

Silence stretched before a cold reply came through. "Noted."

The moment the call ended, Liam's face darkened.

"Useless!" He shattered his teacup against the wall.

His carefully cultivated protégé—wasted after years of training—had been exposed so easily by Vivian.

Worse, Interpol's involvement made extraction nearly impossible.

Liam had no choice but to abandon the pawn.

He immediately contacted the Shadow Organization's director.

His initial capture by the Dark Web had been staged—all part of the plan to infiltrate Vivian's circle.

As the heir apparent, betrayal had never crossed Liam's mind.

Yet Vivian had become the greatest threat.

The assassination attempt four years ago had failed.

Now she'd not only survived but grown stronger, with Ethan Roscente as her shield.

Another strike would require meticulous preparation.

With Annika dealt with, Vivian finally exhaled.

She began planning her departure.

But Ethan shadowed her every move.

"Hungry?" He tied an apron around his waist. "I've been practicing new recipes."

Vivian frowned. "Your cooking is terrible."

"Should I order from Michelin then?"

"Not interested."

Ethan coaxed her into eating a few bites, feeling like an overbearing parent.

"The weather's clear tomorrow," he suggested after dinner. "Let's go out."

After days of rain, sunshine finally broke through.

He wanted to lift her spirits.
###Chapter 843

"I'm busy."

Vivian kept her head down as she packed her suitcase, refusing to even look up. The last thing she wanted was to go shopping with Ethan Roscente. Her flight was scheduled for tomorrow.

"The forecast says sunny weather tomorrow. Let's take Theo to Disneyland?" Ethan persisted, moving closer.

"I said no."

She'd rather take Theo alone. After all, this departure would be permanent.

She needed to make Ethan give up once and for all.

"Vivian—"

"Ethan!" She cut him off sharply. "Must you cling to me every single day? You disgust me!"

Her voice rose deliberately as her nails dug into her palms.

Truthfully, her pulse always raced when she saw him.

Ethan was exceptional—that's why she'd fallen for him at first sight years ago. His striking looks were matched only by his formidable capabilities.

But back then, his eyes had never sought her.

Now his devoted gaze frightened her.

She could never forget those blood-soaked days.

"Vivian..." His eyes dimmed.

"Are you deaf?" She turned away cruelly. "I despise you! With all the men in the world, you think I'd settle for you?"

The suitcase zipper screeched.

"Did I do something wrong?" His voice tightened.

"Everything about you repulses me!" She hurled a cushion at him. "Get out! Never let me see you again!"

When the door slammed shut, her tears finally broke free.

This was for the best.

Once her plane took off tomorrow, everything between them would end.
###Chapter 844

Ethan Roscente stood outside Vivian Laurent's door, the third cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter.

His brow furrowed as he stared at the firmly shut entrance.

Just yesterday, everything had been normal. Today, the world had turned upside down.

Even when he'd barged into her bathroom and kissed her without permission, she hadn't reacted this severely.

What had gone wrong this time?

The ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts, yet Ethan couldn't piece together an answer.

Upstairs, the curtains trembled slightly as Vivian watched him through the gap.

Her fingers clenched the fabric until her knuckles turned white.

"I'm sorry..." she whispered silently.

But her decision was made. There was no other choice.

She needed to wrap up her hospital duties quickly.

As a consultant specialist, she didn't have fixed clinic hours to begin with.

"Dr. Laurent, don't take those online comments to heart," Dean Remetio adjusted his glasses. "I'll arrange an extended leave for you to recover."

Vivian shook her head. "That's not why."

"Then—"

"Personal matters. I may need one or two years."

The dean's expression tightened. "That long? How can we help?"

Her lips pressed into a faint smile. "There's nothing you can do."

A pause. "Though I could consult remotely on one critical case each month."

"Perfect!" The dean looked relieved. "The hospital will always welcome you back."

The rooftop wind tangled Vivian's hair as she stood beside Nathan Clementson, his lab coat flapping like a sail.

"I'm leaving for a while, Nathan."

"Where to?"

"Just... traveling."

Nathan chuckled. "Go. Do what you need to do."

He always supported her without question.

"No attempt to stop me?"

"Hospitals can't contain you." His gaze drifted toward the horizon. "You'll shine wherever you are."

Vivian's eyes burned.

This mentor who always stood behind her understood her better than anyone.
###Chapter 845

"Big brother spoils me the most!" Vivian's eyes curved into crescents, dimples appearing on her cheeks.

Nathan handed her a thermos with a smile. "How could I neglect Master's orders? If anything happened to you, the old man would break my legs."

The warmth from the thermos seeped into her palms. "Take care of Master for me while I'm gone."

"Don't worry." Nathan thumped his chest. "He's obsessed with fishing lately—spends all day by the lake. His spirits are high."

Her lips quirked before she lowered her voice. "One more thing. Ethan mustn't know I'm leaving."

Nathan frowned. "Has he been harassing you?"

"No." She shook her head. "This is my decision."

He studied her for a long moment. "Will you tell me why?"

Her fingers absently traced the cup's surface before she spoke. "I'm pregnant."

"What?" Nathan nearly dropped his tea. "You? Pregnant?"

His gaze swept over her slender frame, struggling to reconcile it with motherhood.

"Six months along," she added softly.

Nathan sucked in a breath. "You kept this hidden all this time? Running around in your condition is dangerous!"

"I know my own body." Vivian cradled her barely-there bump, expression softening. "Next time we meet, you'll be an uncle."

He sighed. "The father—"

"Ethan." She cut him off. "But this child has nothing to do with him. Promise me you won't tell him. No matter what."

Reluctantly, Nathan nodded. "Call me if you need anything."

"Obviously." She winked. "I never stand on ceremony with family."

After parting ways, Vivian had barely entered the General Surgery hallway when she spotted Ethan leaning against the wall, feigning interest in a medical chart.

"What a coincidence." His eyes lit up.

She turned on her heel.

"Vivi!" He caught up swiftly. "I really am here for a checkup."

She stopped, eyeing his chart with disdain. "Gastroenterology is on the second floor."

Ethan tucked the chart away with an awkward laugh. "I... might have come to see you."

"Was I unclear yesterday?" She crossed her arms.

"Crystal clear." He raised his hands in surrender. "No disturbances. Just... serendipity."

Vivian took in his faux-innocent expression and snorted.

As if she'd believe that.
###Chapter 846

Vivian Laurent's voice was icy as she spat out the words. "If you understand, then get lost. Stay out of my sight from now on."

She turned to leave, but Ethan Roscente grabbed her wrist.

Pain flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Even if you're sentencing me to death, at least tell me my crime."

"I'm sorry. I was wrong." His sudden apology came in a low murmur.

Vivian paused mid-step, arching a brow. "What exactly were you wrong about?"

Ethan took a deep breath. "I don't know the specifics, but if I upset you, that's my fault."

He stepped closer, his voice strained. "Hit me, yell at me—just don't push me away."

"Viv, I—"

"Enough." Vivian wrenched her hand free. "This pathetic act makes me sick."

As she moved to leave, a mocking whistle echoed down the hallway.

"Well, well. Never thought I'd see the great Ethan Roscente brought to his knees." Dominic Atlante leaned against the wall with an amused smirk.

Vivian's eyes narrowed. This man's sudden reappearance after disappearing for so long couldn't mean anything good.

Dominic strolled over, positioning himself casually beside Vivian. "Should I post this online? How about 'Roscente Group CEO Begs for Reconciliation and Gets Rejected'?"

"What are you doing here?" Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"Visiting Miss Laurent, of course." Dominic shot Vivian a meaningful look. "Seems I arrived at the perfect moment."

Vivian abruptly linked arms with Dominic. "Let's go. No point wasting time here."

Ethan's stare locked onto their intertwined arms, his expression darkening dangerously.

"Still here, Roscente?" Dominic tilted his chin up in challenge. "Didn't you hear? The lady wants private time with me."

He'd been waiting years to see Ethan humiliated like this. Despite being busy with syndicate business, he'd followed every online scandal closely.

Vivian hadn't disappointed.

Ethan's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. "This is between us. Outsiders shouldn't interfere."

"Outsider?" Dominic chuckled before suddenly wrapping an arm around Vivian's waist. "Does this feel like an outsider to you?"

Vivian stiffened but refused to pull away, determined to provoke Ethan.

Ethan's eyes turned lethal. "Take your hands off her."
###Chapter 847

Dominic Atlante leaned against the wall, his gaze playfully sweeping over Ethan Roscente.

"Mr. Roscente, why not let Vivian choose for herself?"

His fingers tapped lightly against his wristwatch, the metal face reflecting a cold gleam.

Ethan's jawline tensed visibly.

Vivian Laurent stood between them, the hem of her dress fluttering in the draft.

Suddenly, she reached out and looped her arm through Dominic's.

"Let's go, Mr. Atlante."

Dominic arched a brow at Ethan, his eyes brimming with the smug triumph of a victor.

Ethan's fists clenched audibly.

He watched their retreating figures, his chest aching as if being carved by a blunt knife.

At the end of the hallway, Vivian immediately withdrew her hand.

"What do you want?"

Dominic suddenly leaned in, his breath brushing her ear.

"Who is Dominic Atlante?" he murmured. "Aren't I Rainier Valence?"

Vivian rolled her eyes.

"CEO of Integrity Group. Had enough of this act?"

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest.

"That shipment of arms—"

"Money or lives?" Vivian cut him off.

Dominic leisurely adjusted his cufflinks.

"Do I look like the villain to you?"

Vivian eyed the faint serpent tattoo peeking from his sleeve.

"Mr. Atlante, that tattoo looks ready to strike."

He abruptly seized her wrist.

"Help me save someone."

Her eyes narrowed.

"Is this what you call 'no violence'?"

His thumb traced the pulse at her wrist.

"Saving a life outweighs building a seven-story pagoda."

Vivian yanked her hand back.

"Your pagoda seems drenched in blood."

Dominic stared at his empty palm, then suddenly laughed.

"Ms. Laurent, you truly are sharp."

He turned toward the parking lot, his black coat billowing in the wind.

"Eight tomorrow night. Old docks."

Vivian watched his retreating figure, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palm.
###Chapter 848

"What game is Integrity Group playing this time?" Vivian's voice was icy.

Dominic's sudden appearance couldn't be a coincidence.

"What if I said I just came to see you?" Dominic smiled cryptically.

"Do I look that gullible?" She arched an eyebrow.

Either he thought her a fool or overestimated his acting skills.

Dominic spread his hands. "See? You're prejudiced against me. I just wanted to check on my troublesome nephew and visit you."

Vivian had no patience for wordplay. "Enjoy your visit. I'm leaving."

"Wait. Join me for dinner tonight?"

"Busy." Her refusal was crisp.

"Right. Someone preparing for an international trip wouldn't have spare time." His tone was casual.

Vivian whirled around, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"Why that look?" Dominic feigned innocence.

"How do you know about my trip?" Her voice tightened.

"I know more than that." His eyes flickered briefly to her abdomen.

One glance told her everything.

He knew it all.

"That traitor Finn!" She gritted her teeth. "I'll disown him!"

"Don't blame him. He's terrible at keeping secrets." Dominic chuckled. "But I promise Ethan won't hear it from me."

"What's your price?" She cut to the chase.

"Must everything be transactional with you?" He sighed. "If you insist, have dinner with me. My silence in exchange."

Vivian hesitated.

Not that she was paranoid—Dominic was dangerous.

Any man who commanded ruthless mercenaries couldn't be trusted.

Spotting movement at the hospital entrance, she suddenly relented. "Fine. Your treat."

"Whose car?"

"Mine." She tossed him the keys. "Play chauffeur for once."

"You certainly know how to delegate." He laughed.

"Pregnancy privileges." She stated matter-of-factly. "Even Ethan drives for me. Consider it an honor."

Dominic was speechless.

Vivian was the first person who dared make him a driver.
###Chapter 849

Dominic Atlante's slender fingers accepted the car keys, the metal glinting coldly under the sunlight.

Vivian Laurent opened the passenger door, her black dress sweeping in an elegant arc.

Two luxury cars departed the hospital in succession, tires crunching over fallen leaves.

Ethan Roscente's knuckles turned white, the steering wheel creaking under his grip.

The rearview mirror reflected his stormy expression.

"Every last Atlante is scum." He slammed the accelerator, the black Maybach launching like an arrow.

Crystal chandeliers in the French restaurant cast prismatic light.

Vivian's pearl earrings swayed with each step, scattering delicate reflections along her neckline.

"Right this way, madam and sir." The waiter bowed respectfully.

Ethan tugged his hat lower, choosing a window booth. Red wine swirled in his glass, highlighting his tense jawline.

Vivian paused mid-menu, her lips curling faintly.

"Salmon with truffle sauce." She closed the menu, gaze brushing past the burning stare nearby.

Dominic suddenly leaned in, his tie grazing her hand.

"Should we make it convincing?" His whisper tickled her ear.

Vivian cupped his face abruptly, the diamonds on her nails glittering.

"Hold still." Her red lips parted.

Ethan's fork clattered against porcelain, drawing stares.

"Such vanity, Mr. Atlante?" Vivian withdrew her hand, wiping her fingers deliberately.

Dominic twisted his signet ring, smirking. "Compared to Mr. Roscente?"

"Him?" She swirled her champagne flute. "Not even one-tenth as detestable as you."

The chandelier flickered, catching the liquid shimmer in her eyes.

Dominic seized her wrist. "Why not turn pretense into reality?"

A silver knife twirled between Vivian's fingers. "Care to test my surgical skills?"

"Feisty." He released her but deliberately overturned his wineglass.

Crimson liquid seeped across white linen like spreading bloodstains.

Ethan stood abruptly, a button popping from his suit.

"Continue?" Dominic mouthed, tracing Vivian's diamond bracelet.

She laughed suddenly, tossing a napkin at his face. "Pleasure doing business."

A waiter passed with a birthday cake, candlelight blurring the space between them.

Ethan's fist smashed against the wall, sending a painting crashing down.
###Chapter 850 

Soft lighting filled the restaurant as piano music flowed through the air.

Vivian Laurent sat across from Dominic Atlante, their elegant dishes arriving promptly.

Dominic picked up a piece of fish with his chopsticks and held it directly to Vivian's lips.

"I can feed myself." She reached for the utensil.

With a flick of his wrist, he evaded her hand. "Open your mouth."

"That's inappropriate."

"Ethan Roscente is watching. Isn't this what you wanted?"

After a brief hesitation, Vivian reluctantly accepted the bite.

From his table nearby, Ethan's knuckles whitened around his clenched fist. Pregnant women needed careful diets—what did this bastard Dominic know about proper nutrition?

"How was my performance?" Dominic arched an eyebrow.

Vivian remained expressionless. "Mediocre."

Ethan didn't even notice the server standing beside him. "Sir? Excuse me, sir?"

"What?" He snapped back to attention.

"May I take your order?" The server offered a menu.

Ethan gestured absently. "This one."

His gaze remained fixed on Vivian as she flashed Dominic an uncharacteristic smile.

"Are you certain, sir?" The server hesitated.

"Yes."

"Anything else?"

"No."

After the server left, he approached the pianist. "That gentleman requested a song."

Oblivious, Ethan only saw Dominic dabbing Vivian's lips with a napkin.

"Thanks." Vivian's body tensed, her combat reflexes nearly sending Dominic over her shoulder.

"Free tomorrow? Show me around?" Dominic suggested.

"Busy." Her refusal was immediate.

"Finn could join you."

"Changed your mind about provoking Ethan?" Dominic lowered his voice. "This is perfect."

Vivian glanced toward Ethan's table before conceding. "Fine."

Satisfied, Dominic continued serving her food. Vivian frowned at the ginger strips in her bowl—Ethan always remembered she hated ginger.

Playing her role, she forced herself to serve Dominic in return. "Try this."

The sound of bending metal came from Ethan's table as his fork deformed in his grip. He blinked at his empty place setting.

"Where's my food?" He summoned the server.

"You didn't order anything, sir."

"I definitely did." Ethan's brow furrowed. Had his memory failed him?
###Chapter 851

"Sir, the piano piece you requested has been completed," the waiter reminded respectfully.

Ethan Roscente frowned. "When did I request a piano piece?"

The waiter looked confused. "The Moonlight Sonata just performed by that lady. You said you were very satisfied."

Realization dawned on Ethan—that piece had been played by Vivian Laurent. He waved his hand impatiently. "Bring me the menu."

He quickly ordered several of Vivian's favorite dishes, pointing to a distant table. "Deliver them there."

The waiter followed his gaze to where Vivian was chatting animatedly with Dominic Atlante. Hesitating, she said, "But that table already has guests..."

Ethan was already striding toward them. The silver fork he'd been holding now lay twisted on his abandoned table.

"Vivian, what a coincidence," he forced a smile, his voice tight. "Mind if I join you?"

"No."

"Absolutely not."

Their simultaneous rejection darkened Ethan's expression. He sat beside Vivian anyway. "Three's a party, right Dominic? You don't mind."

Dominic sliced his steak deliberately. "Your audacity remains unmatched, Roscente."

"Still can't compete with your talent for opportunism," Ethan's murderous glare promised violence. This was his wife—how dare Dominic flirt right before his eyes?

Dominic set down his knife. "Vivian, shall we go somewhere else?"

She dabbed her lips. "I'm finished. Let's head back."

Dominic took her purse. "I didn't book a hotel. Hope you don't mind me staying over tonight."

"Fine," Vivian agreed without hesitation.

Ethan's fist clenched. Staying at her place? He'd barely been invited! Worse still, he overheard them planning a Disneyland trip tomorrow—when he'd suggested it before, Vivian had claimed to hate crowds.

Watching them leave together, Ethan immediately followed. The food he'd ordered arrived untouched as he threw down cash and stormed out.

Pregnant women always got hungry at night...

In the car, Vivian stared out the window. "I've already reserved your hotel."

Dominic chuckled. "Throw me away after use? I just helped you drive Ethan mad."

"You could've refused," she said flatly. "Drop me at the next intersection."

Instead of slowing, Dominic accelerated. "Wonder how much ransom Ethan would pay if I kidnapped you? Ten billion?"

The rearview mirror showed Ethan's car in relentless pursuit.
###Chapter 852

Vivian Laurent's lips curved slightly, her eyes fearless. "Ten billion? Seems my worth is quite high."

She was certain Dominic Atlante wouldn't use her to threaten Ethan Roscente. Even if he tried, she doubted he had the capability.

"Just joking." Dominic's slender fingers tapped the steering wheel. "Your value far exceeds that. I heard you sent Summer, ranked tenth on the Agent Leaderboard, to prison?"

Vivian arched a brow. "You're well-informed, Mr. Atlante."

"Don't misunderstand. Finn didn't betray you." Dominic chuckled. "That boy may be foolish, but he knows how to keep his mouth shut—especially about you. Even I couldn't pry it open."

"Then how did you find out?"

"He's too green." A glint of amusement flashed in Dominic's eyes. "The extra years I've lived weren't for nothing."

Vivian rolled her eyes.

This man couldn't compliment himself without belittling his nephew.

The Atlante uncle and nephew were nothing alike—one a seasoned schemer, the other naive as blank paper.

"So what else do you know about me, Mr. Atlante?" Vivian met his gaze directly. "Do I have any secrets left in your eyes?"

"I'm only interested in you, Miss Laurent." Dominic's gaze deepened. "There are few people in this world I admire, and even fewer women."

Especially women like Vivian, who never failed to surprise him.

Vivian scoffed. "Being admired by you—I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse."

"Definitely a blessing."

As they spoke, Vivian glanced at the rearview mirror. The familiar black Maybach wasn't following.

Ethan hadn't chased after her.

Perfect.

In a week, she'd leave this place. Her new residence was already arranged—a lovely spot facing the ocean.

Before getting out, Vivian made Dominic wait in the car for an hour.

Only after confirming it was safe did she dismiss him. "You can leave now, Mr. Atlante. Strangers aren't allowed inside."

"Are we still strangers?" Dominic smirked. "I thought we'd grown rather close."

Vivian couldn't be bothered to banter. "I need to rest."

"Don't forget our date tomorrow." Dominic turned away. "I'll pick you up in the morning."

"It's just accompanying you for a stroll," Vivian insisted.

"To me, that's a date."

"It absolutely isn't!"

Dominic looked back, his eyes gleaming with determination. "In my world, this counts as a date. See you tomorrow, my companion."
###Chapter 853

Vivian Laurent finished her nightly routine and slipped into bed. Since becoming pregnant, she usually fell asleep quickly.

But tonight was different. The day's events replayed in her mind, keeping sleep at bay.

She just wanted Ethan Roscente to stay out of her life.

Midnight found Vivian still awake. A faint growl came from her stomach.

She threw off the covers and headed to the kitchen.

At the staircase landing, a thermal container on the dining table caught her eye.

Vivian frowned. Who left this?

The mansion stood silent around her, amplifying her heartbeat.

The moment her fingers touched the container, she knew.

Inside held two simple dishes and soup. The presentation was amateurish at best.

No ginger shreds. Undercooked. These culinary failures could only be Ethan's work.

Vivian checked the security feed. Thirty minutes ago, Ethan had sneaked in like a thief.

He'd placed the food here, glanced upstairs, then left quickly.

This time, his car didn't linger.

Her chest tightened. The mighty CEO of Roscente Group, cooking for her.

Each attempt showed slight improvement.

How did he know she'd be hungry? Since when did this oblivious man become so attentive?

The spoonful tasted predictably mediocre.

But every bite carried warmth. Vivian's eyes stung, her heart aching strangely.

She finished everything without realizing.

Returning to bed, sleep felt further away than ever.

...

Morning revealed dark circles under Vivian's eyes.

Dominic Atlante waited in the living room when she descended.

"Seems my advice went in one ear and out the other," he remarked, raising an eyebrow.

Vivian blinked. "What advice?"

Dominic sighed. He'd explicitly told her to rest.

"Brought you breakfast." He gestured to the table.

Vivian shook her head. Last night's snack still sat heavy in her stomach.

"Not hungry? Think I poisoned it?" Dominic joked halfheartedly.

"I had a midnight snack." She answered honestly. "Shall we leave now?"
###Chapter 854

Dominic Atlante didn't insist when Vivian Laurent declined the meal.

"Shall we leave now?"

"Fine."

"Give me the car keys." Dominic extended his palm.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Quite the natural chauffeur, aren't you? Though I'm sure you could've hired a professional driver overnight."

He could've easily arranged for one, yet he chose to drive her himself.

Vivian didn't protest. Having someone else take the wheel was always preferable.

The capital city brimmed with tourist attractions. Last time they visited popular spots, but today Vivian selected a quiet park.

"This is your idea of a date? Rather underwhelming."

"Cut me some slack. I'm not exactly in the mood."

If not for maintaining appearances, she wouldn't have left her apartment at all.

Ethan Roscente would undoubtedly know about her outing with Dominic.

At that moment, Ethan was indeed seething with jealousy. He'd never shared such casual outings with Vivian.

He knew direct appeals wouldn't bring her back.

But someone else could.

Ethan turned his attention to Theo Evans.

Today he resisted following Vivian, fearing he might lose control. Instead, he stayed with Theo, gently coaxing the child to make a call.

"Theo, your Aunt Viv went out with another uncle. She's abandoning Uncle Ethan." He feigned heartbreak.

Theo's eyes widened. "Really?"

"That uncle isn't a good person. Will you help Uncle Ethan bring Aunt Viv home?"

"Okay!"

When the call connected, Vivian immediately recognized Ethan's manipulation—yet Theo's distress still tugged at her heart.

"Theo? What's wrong?"

"Aunt Viv, I miss you so much. Can you come play with me?"

"I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm busy right now."

Sniffles came through the line. "Does Aunt Viv not like me anymore? Did I do something wrong?"

"Of course not! I could never not like you..."

"But I can't sleep because I miss you so much. If Aunt Viv doesn't want to see me, I won't bother you anymore..."

The child's tearful voice melted Vivian's resolve.

"Don't cry. I'll come see you soon."

"Really? Yay!" Theo's mood instantly brightened.

Hanging up, Vivian gave Dominic an apologetic look. "I have to go."

"Running back to Ethan again?"

"It's Theo who needs me."

Dominic's eyes glinted. "Then I'll accompany you."

"But—"

"If it's not about seeing Ethan, my presence shouldn't be an issue?"
###Chapter 855

Vivian Laurent considered the proposal briefly and found it acceptable.

If Ethan Roscente was indeed with Theo, teaching him those words, bringing Dominic Atlante along would be the perfect way to provoke him.

"Fine. But I'm meeting a child later. Mind your manners around him—no inappropriate remarks, no guns, and don't scare him with that intimidating face of yours."

Dominic scoffed. "Do I look like a child-eating monster to you? Am I really that terrifying in your eyes?"

"You have no idea how intimidating you are. Go take a walk outside and see how many kids burst into tears at the sight of you."

The aura of a mafia boss made even adults tread carefully, let alone children.

"And you?" Dominic studied her with interest. "Are you afraid of me?"

"Why would I be?"

She had never feared Dominic. A crime lord was still human—not some supernatural creature.

Amusement deepened in Dominic's eyes. Very few dared to be this bold with him, yet Vivian showed not a trace of fear.

Her audacity was astonishing. More remarkably, her gaze held no timidity—only shrewd calculation.

Almost no one could manipulate him. Yet here was Vivian, openly using him to deal with another man.

And instead of anger, he found himself enjoying it.

The car pulled into the hospital parking lot. Only then did Dominic witness just how beloved Vivian was at this hospital.

Along the corridor to the ward, patients greeted her warmly.

"Good morning, Dr. Laurent."

"You look radiant today, Dr. Laurent."

"Dr. Laurent, my mother made these dumplings specially for you. You must try them."

"Just hearing your voice makes my wound hurt less, Doctor."

The crowd surrounded Vivian, their affection genuine and unfeigned.

She declined politely with a smile. "Thank you all, but I have an appointment. Please give the dumplings to Dr. Clementson for me."

After finally navigating through the crowd, they reached Theo's room.

Following behind her, Dominic regretted not coming to Canada sooner. He should have known—Vivian was like a treasure trove, revealing more wonders the deeper one dug.

The admiration these people held for her came from the heart, completely unrelated to her status.

"Theo!" Vivian knocked lightly before entering.

As expected, Ethan was there, sitting beside the little boy.

"Aunt Vivian!" Theo rushed over and clung to her tightly.

Despite his small size, his embrace was surprisingly strong.

Ethan quickly pulled him back. "Theo, be gentle. Don't be so reckless."

If he accidentally hurt Vivian and affected the pregnancy...

"But I missed Aunt Vivian!" Theo refused to let go, burying his face in her arms.

Vivian's heart softened at the sight of the affectionate child.

How could she possibly say goodbye to such a sweet boy?

If she left abruptly, how heartbroken would Theo be?
###Chapter 856

"You can hug me anytime you want, Theo." Vivian's voice was tender as morning dew.

"Then I'll hug you forever!" Theo clung to her like a koala.

Ethan stood nearby, his lips curving unconsciously.

Theo always knew how to melt Vivian's heart with his childish charm.

"Well, isn't this cozy?"

A lazy male voice drifted from the doorway, freezing Ethan's smile.

Dominic leaned against the doorframe, his shirt collar carelessly open, his gaze locked on Vivian.

"What are you doing here?" Ethan's voice turned glacial.

"Hospitals aren't Roscente property." Dominic strolled toward Vivian. "Our date isn't over, sweetheart."

Theo jerked his head up, face scrunched in displeasure. "Auntie's going on a date with this uncle?"

He burrowed deeper into Vivian's arms. This man smiled like a hungry wolf.

Vivian knelt to meet Theo's eyes. "Adult relationships are complicated. But remember—I'll always love you."

She hooked her pinky with his in their secret promise.

"Then you'll always be my auntie, right?" Theo's eyes shimmered with hope.

Vivian hesitated. "I'll always be family to you, okay?"

Ethan's expression darkened.

She'd never corrected Theo before. Was Dominic changing everything?

An invisible fist squeezed his chest, stealing his breath.

He wanted to lock Vivian away.

Somewhere only he could reach.

The poisonous thought coiled around his sanity.

Pain from his clenched fists anchored him to reality.

"Yay! We're family!" Theo cheered, throwing himself at Vivian.

Ethan watched her fingers card through Theo's hair, his throat working.

What did she mean by temporary separation?

Was she really leaving?

Dominic draped an arm over Vivian's shoulder. "The movie's starting soon, darling."

Ethan's eyes turned lethal.

"Remove your hand." He seized Dominic's wrist.

Electric tension crackled between the two men.

Vivian frowned. "What's wrong with you both?"

Theo clutched her leg fearfully. "Uncle Ethan..."

Ethan released Dominic but kept his dagger-sharp glare.

Dominic rubbed his wrist, smirking. "No need for violence. Vivian and I are just friends."

"Friends go on movie dates?" Ethan scoffed.

Vivian nudged Theo toward Ethan. "Take him home first."

"You're going with him?" Ethan's voice roughened.

Vivian avoided his gaze. "I need to speak with Dominic privately."

Ethan's knuckles cracked audibly.

He scooped up Theo and strode out without looking back.

At the doorway, he paused.

"Vivian." His back remained turned, voice gravelly. "Remember our promise."

Her fingers trembled slightly.

Only when footsteps faded did Dominic speak. "He's quite possessive of you."

"Not your concern." Vivian massaged her temples.

Dominic leaned close, whispering, "Consider switching teams. I'm much gentler."

Vivian recoiled. "Mind your manners."

"Just joking." He shrugged. "But my offer stands. Anytime."

She grabbed her purse. "Cancel the tickets. I'm not in the mood."

Her pulse hammered as she hurried out.

At the corridor's end, Ethan stood holding Theo, his gaze heavy upon her.

She froze.

He hadn't left.

Theo reached for her. "Auntie..."

Ethan closed the distance, seizing her wrist. "We're going home."
###Chapter 857

Vivian Laurent was playing a puzzle game with Theo.

Ethan Roscente approached Dominic Atlante and lowered his voice. "Mr. Atlante, may I have a word?"

Dominic didn't even look up. "No."

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

He glared at Dominic's handsome face, itching to punch him. This sudden intruder clearly had ulterior motives toward Vivian.

Noticing the tension, Vivian looked up. "Anything you can't say in front of me?"

Ethan forced a smile. "Nothing important."

Their planned date was ruined. Theo clung to Vivian, turning dinner into an awkward group gathering.

Dominic shamelessly took the seat to Vivian's right.

Ethan's gaze turned murderous.

"This is a family dinner. Aren't you out of place, Mr. Atlante?" Ethan said through gritted teeth.

Dominic turned to Vivian with unexpected gentleness. "Does my sitting here bother you, Vivian?"

Who would've thought the feared CEO could look so vulnerable.

Vivian gave Ethan a cool glance. "If you're unhappy, you're welcome to dine elsewhere."

Ethan's chest tightened. Vivian always defended others but treated him with icy indifference.

As the waiter served dishes, Ethan picked up a sweet-and-sour rib.

Dominic's chopsticks moved simultaneously.

Both men placed food in Vivian's bowl.

"Try this, Vivian."

She impassively returned the offerings to their plates. "I can serve myself."

Ethan sneered. "Getting ahead of yourself, Mr. Atlante?"

Dominic wiped his hands leisurely. "Do you always decide for others, Mr. Roscente?"

The tension escalated until Vivian set down her chopsticks.

"Combined age of sixty, yet you're acting like children. If you enjoy serving food, serve each other."

Both men made identical disgusted faces.

Just then, Theo placed fish in Vivian's bowl. "Auntie, eat fish!"

Her expression instantly softened. "Thank you, Theo. You eat more too."

She ruffled the boy's hair, completely ignoring the two glowering men.
###Chapter 858

The air in the restaurant was suffocatingly tense.

Ethan Roscente remained stone-faced throughout the meal, the clinking of his silverware unnaturally loud.

Vivian Laurent kept stealing glances at Theo, her eyes brimming with unspoken affection.

"Theo, come here for a moment," she called softly.

The little boy bounded over, his innocent face tilted upward. "What is it, Aunt Vivian?"

Kneeling down, her fingers trembled slightly. "Aunt Vivian has to go away for a while. It might be a long time before we see each other again."

"Huh?" Theo cocked his head. "Where are you going?"

"Somewhere... very quiet." She forced a smile. "Be good and listen to your father."

Ethan's wine glass slammed onto the table.

His brows furrowed at the fragments of conversation he'd overheard.

During the car ride home, Theo pressed against the window. "Daddy, Aunt Vivian said she's going far away."

Ethan's grip on the steering wheel tightened. "What else did she say?"

"Just told me to be obedient..." Theo yawned. "She looked really sad."

The man's sharp profile cut through the darkness.

Watching the restaurant shrink in the rearview mirror, his chest felt weighed down by stones.

In the following days, Ethan conspicuously avoided Vivian.

Standing before the floor-to-ceiling windows, Vivian absently touched her abdomen.

Perhaps this was for the best.

She began packing, methodically transferring her corporate responsibilities.

Only Isabella Langley stormed into her office with red-rimmed eyes. "Have you lost your mind? Just leaving like this?"

"Shh—" Vivian raised a finger. "Don't scare the baby."

Isabella's tears spilled over.

She clutched Vivian's wrist. "Does that bastard know?"

"It doesn't matter anymore." Vivian gently wiped her friend's tears. "This time, I'm living for myself."

At the farewell dinner, Isabella drank herself into oblivion.

"If you dare not come back..." She grabbed Vivian's collar. "I'll fly over and drag you back myself!"

Lucas Lefèvre silently handed over a warm towel. "Sis, keep in touch."

Moonlight filtered through the curtains.

Running her hand over the packed suitcase, Vivian suddenly remembered Ethan's fathomless gaze.

Shaking her head, she carefully placed the plane ticket in her bag.

By this time tomorrow, she'd be on a flight to another country.
###Chapter 859

"I'm coming with you," Lucas Lefèvre declared without hesitation.

He didn't care about anything left behind. As long as he could stay with Vivian Laurent, he could start over anywhere.

"Don't be ridiculous!" Vivian shot him a glare. "Stay put and visit me whenever you want."

Rubbing her reddened eyes, she added, "It's not like we're saying goodbye forever. I'm just going abroad for the delivery. When I return, you'll all get to be godparents—don't forget the red envelopes."

Finn Deross pointed at himself. "What about me? Do I get to be a godfather too?"

"You?" Vivian scoffed. "More like an older brother."

Letting Finn be a godfather would mess up the family hierarchy.

While comforting the sobbing Isabella Langley, she chided Finn, "And you—practice your shooting. Did you memorize what I taught you? Keep your hands steady when firing."

"My uncle never taught me any of this," Finn suddenly realized. "Wait, how did you know he can handle guns?"

He remembered Dominic Atlante had always hidden that skill around Vivian.

Vivian fell silent.

When would this dense apprentice finally connect the dots?

Did Finn still think she was unaware of Dominic's true identity?

Had all the brains in the Atlante family gone solely to Dominic?

"Lucky guess," she brushed him off. "Just focus on training. If you get arrested, don't expect me to bail you out."

"Relax, Master. My uncle's got my back anyway."

Vivian considered this. Dominic might actually be more effective than her in such situations—money solved most problems, and for the rest, brute force worked just fine.

"All of you—behave," she said sternly. "Lucas, Finn, take good care of Isabella. If I come back and find her thinner, you'll answer to me!"

Finn shrank back. "Got it. Just tell her to go easy on the beatings."

Isabella glared. "Maybe if you listened for once!"

"When don't I listen?" Finn mumbled pitifully.

Watching them, Vivian's eyes burned. Her flight was tomorrow—time to leave.

"No goodbyes at the airport," she insisted, fighting tears. "Visit me overseas in a few days."

She hated farewell scenes. This wasn't permanent anyway—they could reunite anytime.

"Viv..." Lucas started but held back.

They'd already arranged for Amy and Ellen to see her off tomorrow. Though Vivian traveled often, this departure felt different—heavier.

"I'll break your legs if you show up!" Vivian threatened. "No tears at the terminal. We'll meet again soon."

Lucas reluctantly nodded. "Stay safe. Keep in touch."

"What could possibly go wrong on a flight?"

Yet the next day, disaster struck.
###Chapter 860

Dawn light filtered through the terminal windows as Vivian Laurent walked alone through the airport, pulling her carry-on suitcase.

The suitcase held only a few changes of clothes. Isabella Langley had already prepared all her living essentials overseas.

She'd deliberately chosen the earliest flight to avoid prying eyes.

Unbeknownst to her, the Roscente family bodyguards had already reported her itinerary to Ethan Roscente.

Meanwhile, Dominic Atlante's private jet sat waiting at the same terminal.

Ethan was in the middle of a cross-continental video conference when his assistant delivered the news.

"Miss Laurent and Mr. Atlante are both at the airport right now."

The fountain pen in his hand dragged across the document, leaving an ink-stained gash.

For days he'd deliberately kept his distance from Vivian, relying on sleeping pills to get through each night.

Now this information shattered his fragile restraint.

"Get the car!" He ripped off his tie and threw it on the desk. "Tell airport security to delay all flights to M country."

The black Maybach ran three red lights in succession.

Ethan's knuckles turned white around his phone.

The screen displayed a photo just sent by his security team—Vivian smiling at the check-in counter.

That smile burned his eyes like acid.

"Faster," he rasped, his voice rough as sandpaper.

When the boarding announcement echoed through the terminal, Vivian was checking her phone.

Isabella had texted that she was already waiting at arrivals.

As Vivian stood up, an iron grip seized her arm.

The familiar scent of cedarwood enveloped her.

Ethan's eyes were bloodshot, his jaw shadowed with stubble.

"You're leaving with him?" His voice shook.

Vivian winced at his crushing grip. "Let go!"

"Answer me!" He pinned her against the glass wall. "How long has this been going on?"

Passengers turned to stare.

Only then did Vivian realize his misunderstanding.

A quiet relief washed over her—he didn't know about the pregnancy.

"My travel plans are none of your business." She pushed against his chest. "I'll call security."

Suddenly he pulled her into a crushing embrace.

"Don't go..." His breath scorched her neck. "These past seven days...I've been a walking corpse..."

The raw pain in his voice made her shiver.

"Every flower shop makes me think of buying you roses. Every patisserie makes me want to bring you macarons..."

His words dissolved into a choked sob.

Vivian's eyes burned unexpectedly.

The final boarding call echoed through the terminal.

Ethan tightened his arms around her. "Please..."
###Chapter 861

"Let go." Vivian's voice was hoarse, her eyes rimmed red.

Ethan's knuckles turned white as he gripped her wrist. "No."

She struggled backward, only to be yanked against his chest.

His scorching breath fanned her ear. "What spell has that Deross bastard cast on you?"

"You're insane!" Vivian winced from his bruising hold.

Bloodshot eyes locked onto hers. "Yes. I lost my mind the moment you chose him over me."

The boarding announcement echoed through the terminal.

Vivian checked her watch. "Five minutes left."

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, Ethan studied her bare face.

The oversized hoodie and loose hair shouldn't have captivated him—yet they did.

"Must you go?" His voice cracked.

She turned away. "We're over."

"But you—"

"That was the past." She cut him off. "Stop lying to yourself."

Ethan laughed suddenly, thumb brushing her damp eyelid. "Then why are you crying?"

Vivian recoiled.

Final boarding call sounded.

"Enough." As she pivoted, cold metal pressed against her nape.

The world tilted. Through the haze, she saw Ethan's desperate gaze.

"Forgive me." He caught her collapsing form, cradling her bridal-style. "This time, I'll keep you—even if I have to chain you down."
###Chapter 862

Vivian Laurent's consciousness struggled in the void.

Her limbs felt leaden. Her eyelids were glued shut as if with adhesive.

Her fingers twitched slightly. Finally, she opened her eyes.

Harsh white light made her squint instinctively.

An unfamiliar ceiling.

An unfamiliar room.

An unfamiliar scent.

She bolted upright. Dizziness washed over her immediately.

"Where am I?" she murmured.

Fragmented memories flashed through her mind—the airport, Ethan Roscente, darkness.

She checked herself.

Her phone was gone.

Her wallet was missing.

Even her watch had vanished.

She staggered to the window.

The thirty-floor drop made her head spin.

Outside stretched a concrete jungle—no fire escapes, no emergency ladders.

The sound of a turning lock froze her in place.

Ethan entered carrying a tray.

"Awake?" His tone was deceptively gentle, as if nothing had happened.

Vivian backed away until her spine pressed against the cold glass.

"Have you lost your mind?" Her voice trembled.

Ethan set the tray down with the grace of a fine dining waiter.

"Eat something." He pulled out a chair. "You've slept a full day."

Vivian stared at his calm expression.

"This is kidnapping." She enunciated each word.

Ethan chuckled softly. "I just want to talk properly."

Vivian lunged for the door.

The handle didn't budge.

She pounded frantically on the metal surface.

"Useless." Ethan's voice came from behind her. "It's a custom bulletproof door."

She turned to see him approaching slowly.

"Why?" Her voice was hoarse.

Ethan reached to touch her face. She flinched away.

"Because I can't lose you." His eyes darkened. "Never again."

The air in the room seemed to solidify.

Vivian heard her own frantic heartbeat.

"Let me go," she said.

Ethan shook his head, producing a silver key from his pocket.

"Not unless you agree to stay." He twirled the key between his fingers. "This door won't open otherwise."
###Chapter 863

Vivian wrenched free from his grasp, stumbling back until her shoulders hit the wall.

"Ethan Roscente, have you lost your mind?" Her voice trembled. "This is unlawful confinement!"

Ethan's eyes darkened like storm clouds.

"I can't watch you leave with Dominic." He advanced toward her. "Stay with me. I'll give you anything you want."

A cold laugh escaped Vivian's lips.

"You think this will keep me here? Isabella and Lucas will notice something's wrong soon enough."

Ethan braced one hand against the wall beside her head.

"I know." His voice was rough. "But even one more minute with you is worth it."

His breath scorched her skin.

"You already despise me. What's a little more hatred?" He chuckled darkly. "Hate me if you must. At least you'll never forget me."

Vivian's eyes widened in disbelief.

"You're seriously disturbed!"

Ethan suddenly seized her wrist.

"Yes, I am." Madness flickered in his gaze. "I've been incurable since the moment I fell for you."

She struggled violently.

"Let go!"

"Never." He yanked her against his chest. "I won't release you this time."

Vivian went still.

"Give me my phone." Her tone turned icy. "I'll pretend this never happened."

Ethan shook his head with a faint smile.

"Do I look that gullible?"

"So you'll keep me locked up forever?" She sneered. "You can't watch me every second."

His fingers traced her cheekbone.

"We'll be inseparable." He murmured. "Even in sleep."

Her pupils contracted.

"You—" Realization dawned. "You're going to drug me again?"

Ethan didn't deny it.

"Don't worry. It's safe." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "I'd never harm you."

Vivian shoved him away.

"Do you have any idea how dangerous drugs are during pregnancy?"

His expression darkened.

"Specially formulated." He produced a small vial. "Harmless to the baby."

The sight of the container made her blood run cold.

"You planned this all along?"

Ethan's smile turned tender.

"To keep you with me? I'll gladly play the madman."
###Chapter 864

"Your so-called love is suffocating me. If you truly cared, you'd let me go!"

"Never." Ethan Roscente's eyes burned crimson. "You won't escape me in this lifetime."

Vivian Laurent shivered under his obsessive gaze.

"Ethan, you need psychiatric help."

"Gladly." His lips curled into a humorless smile. "But you're coming with me."

Her fists clenched.

Words were wasted on this man.

A sharp pang of hunger twisted her stomach. She hadn't eaten all day.

Ethan immediately opened an ornate food container. "Eat first."

The gourmet dishes emitted tantalizing aromas—clearly prepared by a master chef.

"Who knows what you've laced it with." She turned away.

Without hesitation, Ethan took a deliberate bite.

"See? Perfectly safe." His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. "I'd never harm you."

"Not hungry."

He held a spoon to her lips. "Just one taste."

"You make me sick." Vivian's laugh was ice. "Get lost."

His fingers twitched, eyes darkening.

"I'll have the kitchen remake everything." He pressed the call button. "Until you eat."

"You're the problem!" She slapped his hand away. "Must I spell it out?"

Ethan studied her in silence.

Then he chuckled lowly. "We have time."

Leaning in, his breath scorched her ear. "A lifetime is long enough... for you to learn to belong to me."

Vivian froze.

The man had truly lost his mind.
###Chapter 865

Vivian Laurent turned her face away, rejecting the meal tray Ethan Roscente offered.

Ethan sighed and returned the food to the thermal container.

"Want to watch some variety shows?" He picked up the remote, the LCD screen glowing blue.

He deliberately avoided the laptop. Vivian, the hacker Queen, could send a distress signal at any moment.

"I need to sleep." Her voice was icy.

"I'll stay with you." Ethan's fingers brushed through her loose hair.

Vivian clenched the sheets. She wanted to punch that gentle face.

The mattress creaked slightly as she turned her back to him, her eyelashes casting shadows under the light.

Ethan's gaze felt tangible, clinging to her slender silhouette.

She stared at the wall. After twelve hours of forced sleep, she was now alert as morning dew.

The communicator vibrated beneath her pillow. She calculated how long before Lucas Lefèvre noticed her absence—three days max, and this farce would end.

Then she'd sever this absurd connection herself.

"Stop staring at me." She suddenly sat up.

Ethan retreated to the window, moonlight outlining his tense jawline.

"Get out!"

"Not until you eat." He shook the meal box.

By dawn, the fried eggs on the tray had gone cold.

"Trying to starve yourself?" Ethan pressed his hand over her IV line.

Vivian jerked away. "Let me go."

"Glucose or steak?" He pressed the call button.

As the needle pierced her vein, she laughed. "Since when did Mr. Roscente become a kidnapper?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I just—"

"Just what?" She yanked out the IV. "Proving love through captivity?"

Blood droplets rolled down her hand. Ethan reached for gauze with the care of handling fragile glass.

"Are you unhappy with me?"

"Happy?" She pointed outside. "See those iron bars? Even birds know to fly toward the sky."

His pupils contracted violently. Lips parting, he finally just pushed warm milk toward her.
###Chapter 866

Ethan stormed out of the room.

He needed to clear his head.

After finishing his third cigarette at the end of the hallway, he finally pushed the door open again.

Vivian remained motionless against the headboard, eyes closed.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across her face.

Ethan studied her for a long moment.

It was never her exquisite features that captivated him.

It was the woman who'd sheltered him with an umbrella on that rainy night.

These past two days, he'd replayed his actions endlessly.

He'd gone too far.

But letting her walk away now...

His fists clenched involuntarily.

The image of Vivian leaving without a backward glance terrified him.

When he reentered, her eyes were open and watching him.

No anger burned in that gaze.

Only a chilling calm that made his blood run cold.

Two days had visibly taken their toll.

Her cheekbones stood sharper, her refusal to eat or speak carving hollows beneath them.

A fist of panic tightened around Ethan's throat.

"Vivi..."

His voice cracked.

She lifted her gaze.

The look in her eyes pierced him like shards of ice.

"I'll let you go."

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

Vivian's lashes fluttered.

"Conditions?"

Her whisper barely stirred the air.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

"Be my girlfriend."

"One week."

"Just like any normal couple."

"After that, you can leave. No strings."

Her brow furrowed.

She couldn't fathom his obsession.

She was ordinary in every way.

"Three days."

The counteroffer slipped out before she could stop it.

"Five."

Ethan's voice roughened.

"Five it is."

She nodded finally.

"But swear it."

"If you harass me after five days, may lightning strike you dead."

The vow lodged like a stone in Ethan's chest.

Five days. That's all he had left.

"Eat first."

His gaze traced the sharp angles of her face.

"Then I'll return your phone."

Vivian picked up the bowl.

Hunger gnawed at her resolve.

Ethan watched her eat, an unbidden smile tugging at his lips.
###Chapter 867

Vivian set down her chopsticks.

She reached out toward Ethan. "Give me back my phone."

Ethan finally handed it over.

Vivian immediately unlocked the screen.

Her notifications couldn't possibly be this quiet.

Sure enough, she saw over a dozen messages from Isabella.

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian gritted her teeth. "You impersonated me to reply to messages?"

Not just Isabella—he'd even responded to Lucas and Finn's texts.

Every reply perfectly mimicked her tone.

When Isabella asked why she hadn't come home, Ethan had replied that she'd suddenly decided to go on a trip.

Vivian's temples throbbed with anger.

"I was just helping you reply," Ethan said with innocent eyes. "I didn't read anything else."

He lowered his head in apology. "I'm sorry, Vivian."

She quickly scanned through all the messages.

Then tossed her phone aside.

"Five days," she said coldly. "Starting now, you have four days and twenty-three hours left."

Ethan's eyes lit up.

He hadn't expected Vivian to actually keep her promise.

He'd thought she'd call for help the second she got her phone back.

"You're serious?" His voice trembled slightly.

Vivian turned her face away. "I keep my word."

Ethan suddenly smiled.

He cupped Vivian's face and kissed her.

She was caught completely off guard.

"Mmph—"

She clenched her teeth, refusing to let him in.

But Ethan didn't force it.

When he pulled away, his eyes burned with intensity.

"Now you're my girlfriend," he said hoarsely. "Kissing my own girlfriend isn't a crime, is it?"

Vivian wiped her lips harshly.

"Additional clause!" She held up a finger. "For these five days, you can't touch me, kiss me, or—"

Ethan cut her off. "But I want to kiss you."

"Then suffer."

He looked wounded.

The usually formidable CEO now resembled a scolded golden retriever.

"What if I can't hold back?" He leaned in again.

Vivian retreated. "Then we end this early!"

Ethan froze.

He studied her deeply, then suddenly chuckled.

"Fine, I'll endure it," he murmured. "But remember—for these five days, you're mine."

Vivian's heart skipped a beat.
###Chapter 868

"You'll have to endure it. Otherwise I'll revoke your boyfriend privileges immediately."

Ethan Roscente fell silent at once.

These five days together were hard-won. If even this brief period disappeared, he'd truly have nothing left.

"Then keep your distance now."

"Not a chance. You're my girlfriend now. What kind of couple maintains distance? We're going on our first date."

Ethan forced himself not to think beyond these five days. He'd treat each day as the happiest moment of his life. Perhaps by the end, Vivian Laurent might change her mind about leaving.

"I don't feel like moving." Vivian wished these five days would pass in a blink.

Freedom awaited when this brief captivity ended.

"If we're not dating, I don't mind alternative activities."

"What alternatives?" Her guard shot up instantly.

Ethan's lips curved. "Adult activities, naturally. Kissing is child's play, Vivian. We've done far more."

Vivian sprang to her feet. "Fine. Let's go out."

Satisfaction warmed Ethan's smile as he bundled Vivian in warm layers. The autumn chill worried him.

Once she was snugly wrapped, their fingers intertwined as they stepped out. A faint smile lingered on Ethan's lips.

"You went sightseeing with Dominic Atlante but never with me. Today we'll make up for lost time."

He took Vivian to scenic spots where golden leaves danced across lakes. They boated and fished together. Though out of season, Ethan miraculously produced a kite.

Every effort was made to create joyful memories, to make her cherish this day.

Vivian played along, though impending separation loomed beneath their laughter.

Ethan considered ice skating but feared her falling. The idea was abandoned.

"Vivian, let's go skiing together someday?"

Her absentminded "Hmm" sent euphoria through him. "You agreed! You actually agreed!"

"It's just skiing. Why the excitement?"

Ethan's gaze turned solemn. "Promises are binding. I'll hold you to this—you must ski with me someday."

Vivian had no rebuttal.

A casual remark treated as sacred vow. But after the baby's birth, one ski trip wouldn't hurt.

Twilight descended as streetlights flickered to life.

Vivian noticed the snaking queue at a roadside stall selling baked sweet potatoes.

"I want that. Go queue."

"Gladly. But you're coming with me." Ethan's grip tightened.

His icy fingers made her instinctively recoil, but he held fast.

"Can't even buy me a sweet potato alone?"

Ethan's whisper carried vulnerability. "I'd buy you the world. But I fear you vanishing. Holding your hand is my only anchor."

Even with five guaranteed days, the terror of her disappearing haunted him.

Only their interlaced fingers offered fleeting reassurance.
###Chapter 869

Ethan Roscente kept Vivian Laurent's hand firmly clasped in his, as if she might vanish if he let go.

The aroma of roasted sweet potatoes was especially enticing in the chilly wind.

"How am I supposed to peel it like this?" Vivian shook her right hand, still trapped in his grip.

Ethan chuckled. "I'll feed you."

"No way." Her cheeks flushed pink.

The golden skin of the sweet potato cracked at the slightest touch, revealing its honey-colored flesh. Vivian took small bites, her breath forming little clouds in the cold air.

Ethan watched her puffed cheeks, unable to hide the warmth in his eyes.

The night market buzzed with activity, its colorful lights brightening the winter evening.

"This hairpin is adorable." Vivian picked up a strawberry-shaped accessory.

Before she could blink, Ethan had already scanned the payment code.

"What are you doing? I was just looking!"

"Everything you look at should belong to you."

Vivian dragged him away from the stall, afraid he'd buy out the entire street.

The artificial lake reflected neon lights like a spilled palette.

"Let's take a photo." Ethan suddenly raised his phone.

"No!" Vivian hastily covered her face.

The shutter clicked repeatedly as he captured every vivid expression of hers.

On a bench, Ethan tightened his scarf around them both.

Vivian leaned against his shoulder, closing her tired eyes.

"Today was wonderful," he murmured.

The night breeze skimmed the lake's surface, scattering his words. This moment of warmth would be enough to cherish for a lifetime.
###Chapter 870

"Let's go to Disneyland tomorrow." Ethan rested his chin on Vivian's head. "We'll ride the Ferris wheel, eat cotton candy, just like any normal couple."

He rarely spoke this much.

But now, he chattered like a lovestruck teenager, meticulously planning their dates for the coming days.

"Viv, I booked a seaside restaurant." His arms tightened around her. "They say the sunset there is breathtaking."

No response came from the woman in his embrace.

Ethan looked down to find Vivian already asleep against his chest. Moonlight cast delicate shadows through her lashes.

A silent smile curved his lips.

He pulled out his phone, secretly framing them both in the screen. Vivian's peaceful sleeping face glowed softly.

Their first photo together.

Ethan snapped several shots before finally tucking his phone away. Cradling Vivian carefully, he moved without disturbing her dreams.

"Put me down." Vivian stirred halfway, struggling to free herself.

"Almost at the parking lot." Ethan held firm. "Sleep a little longer."

She frowned. "I want to go home."

"I'll take you." He hesitated. "But I'm staying over."

"No!"

"I'll sleep on the couch." His voice dropped. "Just four more days, Viv."

Vivian turned her face away. In four days, this absurd arrangement would end.

As the car entered the gated community, Ethan navigated the winding roads with practiced ease. He'd traveled this route so often, he remembered every speed bump.

"Upstairs is mine. You stay downstairs." Vivian tossed the words over her shoulder as she headed for the staircase.

Ethan stood in the foyer, watching her silhouette disappear around the corner.

Four days.

His fists clenched. Having tasted such sweetness, how could he ever let go?
###Chapter 871

Vivian Laurent lay in bed after her shower, unable to fall asleep.

Moonlight streamed through the window like liquid silver, yet her thoughts were more turbulent than the night itself.

Having slept excessively these past days and napped against Ethan Roscente's shoulder that afternoon, her mind was unusually alert.

Memories always grew sharper in the quiet of night.

Images from today's shopping trip with Ethan kept flashing through her mind.

The same streets and stores that felt dull with Dominic Atlante now came alive with Ethan by her side.

He protected her with quiet vigilance, naturally taking her hand when crossing streets.

That cherished feeling made her heartbeat quicken.

Four more days.

In four days she'd regain her freedom.

Ethan had promised to let her go.

Yet the thought of leaving made her chest tighten inexplicably.

She shouldn't dwell on this.

Ethan's future wasn't her concern.

But his determined gaze always softened her resolve.

A faint sound came from downstairs.

Ethan must still be awake.

Vivian rose quietly, easing her door open.

She just wanted to check on him.

"Vivian?"

Ethan's voice startled her nearly out of her skin.

"I...I was thirsty."

She stammered the excuse, hurrying downstairs.

He must never know she'd come specifically to see him.

That man would become insufferably smug.

Cold water filled her glass.

Before she could drink, Ethan took it from her.

"Cold water harms your stomach in winter."

He expertly added hot water, testing the temperature before returning it.

When their fingers brushed, Vivian's heart skipped.

The cup's warmth reminded her of his palm.

"Thank you."

She drank without meeting his eyes.

The warm liquid soothed her throat and something deeper.

At the stair landing, she glanced back.

Ethan watched her retreat with heartbreaking tenderness.

She fled to her room.

Now sleep felt even more impossible.

Ethan's image lingered stubbornly in her mind.

Give this a chance?

Or cut her losses now?

The question tormented her as she tossed and turned.

Moonlight through the curtains fell as gently as his gaze.
###Chapter 872

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Vivian caught the aroma of frying eggs.

Rubbing her eyes, she descended the stairs to find Ethan bustling in the open-concept kitchen.

The tall man wore a pink apron, expertly flipping pancakes with practiced ease.

"Almost ready," Ethan called over his shoulder, unable to mask the excitement in his voice.

Vivian leaned against the breakfast bar, surveying the lavish spread.

From culinary disasters to Michelin-level breakfasts, his progress astonished her.

"That's enough. Come eat," she said softly.

Ethan approached with freshly made pancakes drizzled in maple syrup and fresh blueberries.

Steamed buns, eggs Benedict, freshly squeezed juice—he seemed determined to serve her every delicacy imaginable.

Tiny droplets condensed on the chilled milk glass as Vivian took small sips.

Ethan's gaze never left her. Last night, he'd nearly jumped off the couch when he heard her footsteps.

"Sleep well?" He feigned nonchalance.

Dark circles lingered under Vivian's eyes. "Fine," she replied, spearing a piece of fruit.

"Any plans today?" Ethan fidgeted with his fingers.

Vivian glanced outside. "Let's catch a movie. Maybe some shopping later."

The mall stood nearly empty during early hours. Ethan shadowed Vivian's every move.

Normally despising crowded spaces, today even the air smelled sweeter to him.

"This would suit you." He paused abruptly at a jewelry counter.

The sales associate brightened, immediately presenting a five-carat diamond ring.

Vivian stopped his reaching hand. "We're just browsing."

"But imagine how stunning it would look on you," Ethan insisted stubbornly.

Over the next thirty minutes, Vivian had to dissuade him from purchasing three bracelets, two necklaces, and a mink coat.

"Window shopping is about the experience, not emptying the store," she sighed.

Ethan pouted like a child denied candy. "I only want to give you the best."

"The best doesn't always mean most expensive." She tugged him away. "I'm hungry. Lunch is on you."

At the Italian restaurant, Ethan barely touched his food.

He watched, mesmerized, as Vivian twirled pasta around her fork, finding even the sauce on her lips endearing.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the sun began its westward descent.

Their three-and-a-half-day countdown ticked steadily away.
###Chapter 873

After lunch, Ethan Roscente took Vivian Laurent to the cinema.

It was their first movie date. The screen played a romantic comedy that blended laughter with tears, making the audience alternate between bursts of laughter and quiet sobs.

Tears glistened at the corners of Vivian's eyes. Silently, Ethan handed her a tissue, gently wiping away the traces of her emotions.

As they exited the theater, Ethan suddenly spoke, "I shouldn't have chosen this film."

"Was it bad?" Vivian's heart tightened.

Did he not enjoy watching movies with her?

"It was wonderful."

Truthfully, he hadn't paid attention to the plot at all. His gaze had remained fixed on Vivian's face throughout the entire film, unwilling to miss even a single frame, as if etching her every expression into his bones.

"But I don’t like seeing you cry," Ethan murmured, his voice low. "I only want to see you smile."

"Who was crying?"

She had merely been moved!

"Right, my mistake."

Outside the cinema, the mall was brightly lit. Passing by the arcade, Vivian's eyes lit up.

"Want to play a few rounds?"

"Whatever you say." Ethan didn’t hesitate.

Vivian exchanged tokens and pointed at the basketball machine. "Two minutes. Highest score wins."

"Any stakes?" Ethan raised an eyebrow.

"What scheme are you plotting now?" Vivian took half a step back, wary.

She feared he might propose something like getting back together.

"Just a small reward." Ethan leaned closer, whispering near her ear, "If I win, I get to kiss you?"

"Dream on!"

"Then play by yourself." Ethan crossed his arms and stood aside.

After a few shots, Vivian lost interest. His intense gaze made her even more restless.

"Fine, let’s do it." She gritted her teeth. "But if you lose, our five-day agreement gets shortened to four."

Ethan's smile froze instantly.

"Are you that desperate to leave me?" His voice trembled. "Is every second with me that unbearable?"

Vivian's heart clenched painfully. She opened her mouth but couldn’t find the words to explain.
###Chapter 874

Vivian pursed her lips, her gaze drifting away. "Is this really the right time for this conversation?"

Ethan took a deep breath, suppressing his turbulent emotions. "My apologies."

"Change the terms," Vivian suddenly curved her lips into a smirk. "If you lose, you give me a shoulder massage."

The memory of those warm hands from their last encounter in the bathroom still lingered. Perhaps this would be her final chance to savor it.

"Deal," Ethan agreed without hesitation.

He'd been craving any excuse to touch her. Winning or losing—either outcome worked in his favor.

The game began.

Vivian moved cautiously, careful not to jostle the tiny life growing inside her. She didn't even dare jump when shooting hoops.

"I win," Ethan announced, his voice laced with triumph.

Vivian muttered under her breath, "Consider it a dog bite."

The man being compared to a dog only laughed harder. If it pleased her, he'd even bark on command.

"I'll owe you," Vivian turned to leave. "Another round?"

"Absolutely," Ethan quickly followed.

The arcade lights pulsed rhythmically as engine roars echoed from the racing simulator section.

"What's the wager this time?" Ethan asked.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "If I win, the previous bet is void."

"Agreed," Ethan's gaze burned intensely. "If I win, you spend the night with me."

"What?" Her eyes widened.

"Just sleeping," he raised his hands in surrender. "I promise not to touch you."

The man was insatiable. Jumping from kisses straight to sharing a bed.

Gritting her teeth, Vivian accepted. She refused to believe she'd lose twice in a row.

On the motorcycle simulators, they were evenly matched. Ethan didn't hold back this time—he knew Vivian despised being patronized.

She'd always been a queen who fought with skill, not pity.

At the final curve, Vivian executed a perfect drift, leaving Ethan half a bike length behind.

"Viv!" Ethan suddenly called out.

"Hmm?"

"Your phone's ringing."

"What?"

That split-second distraction was all he needed to cross the finish line first.

"Tonight then," he grinned like the cat that got the cream.

"You cheated!" Vivian stomped her foot in frustration.
###Chapter 875

Ethan Roscente arched an eyebrow. "The rules never said cheating wasn't allowed. Winning is what matters. Feel free to try it yourself."

Vivian Laurent's cheeks puffed in frustration. "Just you wait!"

She looked like an angry kitten with her round eyes wide and furious.

The sight softened Ethan's heart.

He adored Vivian's fiery, spirited expressions.

"I'll be waiting."

No matter what, he'd always be there for her. Whenever she turned around, he'd remain steadfast.

Vivian's competitive spirit ignited.

As a multi-talented genius, how could she lose to Ethan? Was pregnancy really dulling her intellect?

A new round began.

They traded wins and losses until most of their game tokens remained unused.

Ethan pointed to a corner. "Want to try the claw machine?"

Couples crowded around it, but no one succeeded. The machine was clearly rigged.

Vivian's eyes sparkled. "Whoever grabs the most wins?"

Ethan sighed.

Even a romantic activity became a competition in her mind.

"No competing this time."

"Giving up already?"

"I just want you to win me a souvenir." His voice softened. "You've never given me a gift."

Vivian paused. It was true—she'd never given him anything.

Consider it a farewell present.

"Fine. Which one?"

Ethan scanned the options and pointed to a sparrow plushie tucked deep inside.

"This?" Vivian blinked. "Didn't take you for the cute type."

The round, fluffy sparrow sat in the most awkward position.

"Mm. Reminds me of you."

Vivian's ears warmed. "Watch me."

She focused on maneuvering the claw.

The sparrow's placement made it nearly impossible. After several failed attempts, she snagged other plushies instead.

A group of children gathered around.

"Wow, you're amazing, miss!"

"Can you get that bear for me?"

Their admiration filled Vivian with pride.

Since Ethan only wanted the sparrow, she handed out the extras to the kids.

Soon, she was surrounded by tiny fans.

"Which one do you want? I'll get it for you."

The children eagerly pointed at their favorites.

Vivian patiently taught them how to operate the machine, even letting them try themselves.

Their tokens dwindled fast.

She winked at Ethan. "Time for a refill, Mr. Roscente."
###Chapter 876

Ethan Roscente strode toward the arcade counter with an unusually buoyant step. He handed the manager a black card with effortless confidence.

"Put today's expenses on my tab."

The manager's eyes widened as he accepted the card. He immediately instructed staff to display a "Free Play" sign.

Word spread fast. More customers flooded into the arcade within minutes.

Ethan returned to Vivian Laurent with a bucket overflowing with tokens.

"What do you want to play?"

Vivian took the tokens and distributed them to nearby children without hesitation.

"It's more fun when everyone plays together."

She stopped before a claw machine, her gaze fixed on a sparrow plushie inside.

The claw descended repeatedly, each attempt ending in failure.

"Is this machine rigged?"

Ethan stood behind her, his lips curving upward involuntarily.

"Are you laughing at me?" Vivian turned to glare at him.

He schooled his expression instantly. "Absolutely not."

Determined, Vivian kept feeding tokens into the machine. After countless tries, the claw finally grasped the plushie.

"For you."

She turned to offer it, but Ethan caught her hand instead.

"Let go." The tips of Vivian's ears turned pink.

"Thank you." His voice was low and warm.

This was his first time experiencing a movie date, arcade games, and plushie prizes—all with someone by his side.

"You're welcome." Vivian tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Miss, can I have that?"

A little girl with pigtails gazed up at them with hopeful eyes.

Ethan swiftly snatched the plushie and clutched it to his chest.

"It's mine."

The girl's face fell.

Vivian crouched to her level. "How about I win another one for you?"

"Really?" The child's eyes lit up instantly.

"Of course."

Ethan watched as Vivian patiently guided the girl through operating the machine.

A sudden thought struck him—when their own child arrived, Vivian would make an incredibly gentle mother.

The idea sent warmth flooding through his chest.
###Chapter 877

Vivian Laurent stood before the claw machine, her fingertips lightly tapping the control buttons.

Her gaze remained fixed on the plush toy inside the glass case, more intense than when negotiating billion-dollar contracts.

As a child in the countryside, she could only watch enviously as other children walked by hugging their stuffed animals.

Now she could finally indulge in playing these games to her heart's content.

"Another win!" Vivian cheered as she retrieved her prize.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the adjacent machine, his eyes never leaving her.

The corners of his mouth lifted unconsciously as he watched her childlike excitement.

Vivian shoved the newly won bunny plush into Ethan's arms.

"For you."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Gifting me a prize won with my own tokens?"

"Fine, I'll take it back." Vivian made to grab the toy.

Ethan held it out of reach. "No take-backs on gifts."

He suddenly leaned close to her ear. "Though I'd prefer a different reward."

The tips of Vivian's ears turned pink instantly.

She remembered losing their earlier bet and promising him a kiss.

"W-we can discuss that at home..."

Ethan already had her wrist in his grasp. "I can't wait."

He pulled her swiftly toward the emergency stairwell.

The dimly lit stairs were illuminated only by faint emergency lighting.

Ethan pressed her against the wall, gently tilting her chin up.

"A bet's a bet."

When his lips met hers, Vivian instinctively closed her eyes.

The kiss burned hotter than she'd imagined.

Ethan cradled the back of her head with one hand while the other gripped her waist.

Vivian could hear elevator chimes and passing conversations outside.

Her fingers curled nervously into Ethan's shirtfront.

"Focus." He nipped lightly at her lower lip.

Vivian tried to protest, but he seized the opportunity to deepen the kiss.

His presence surrounded her completely, leaving no escape.

An eternity later, Ethan finally pulled back slightly.

Vivian gasped for air, her lips tingling.

"That...that was more than one kiss..."

Ethan chuckled darkly. "Interest."

His thumb brushed her swollen lips, eyes darkening.

"We'll continue the rest at home."
###Chapter 878

The kiss was deep and passionate, melting their very souls together.

Vivian's legs trembled weakly. Without Ethan's strong arms supporting her, she would have collapsed onto the floor.

Ethan had always surprised her with sudden kisses before. Though Vivian protested verbally, she never truly pushed him away.

But this time, Ethan kissed her with heartbreaking tenderness, pouring all his longing into that single moment.

When their lips finally parted, an unmistakable sorrow flickered in Ethan's eyes.

"Vivian..." His voice was barely audible.

His thumb brushed lightly over her slightly swollen lips as he rasped, "I'm sorry."

All the reproaches Vivian had prepared died in her throat at his apology.

"A bet's a bet. I keep my promises." She steadied her breathing. "Can we go home now?"

"Alright." Ethan nodded.

From the mall to the parking lot, Ethan never loosened his grip on her hand, as if she might vanish the moment he let go.

In his other hand, he carefully cradled the sparrow plushie Vivian had won for him.

Time slipped through their fingers like sand. The second day was ending far too quickly.

At least tonight, he could still hold her in his arms.

Ethan knew these fleeting moments of happiness were stolen against fate's will.

...

The black Maybach glided into the residential area.

Warm light spilled from Vivian's apartment window in the distance.

"That's odd. I remember turning off the lights this morning." Vivian frowned. "Did Finn come back?"

But Finn was still overseas on a mission. He'd texted her just this morning.

As the car parked, Ethan suddenly called out, "Vivian!"

"What now?" She turned to look.

Ethan stubbornly extended his hand. "Hold hands."

"We're at the doorstep already..."

"That's what couples do." He seized her hand without waiting for permission.

Vivian rolled her eyes but allowed him to interlace their fingers.

The smart lock recognized Vivian's face. The moment the door clicked open, four shocked eyes met theirs.

"Vivian?!"

"Isabella? Lucas?" Vivian's eyes widened in disbelief.

Isabella rubbed her eyes and pinched Lucas's arm. "Am I seeing things?"

Lucas gasped. "It's really her."

Vivian's mind went blank.

This was it.

Her secret was out.

Ethan had used her phone to respond to everyone's messages before. When she got it back, she couldn't be bothered to explain.

She'd planned to disappear quietly. Now her carefully constructed lie had crumbled at the worst possible moment.

And if these two found out Ethan had kidnapped her...

Vivian could already envision the bloodbath that would follow.
###Chapter 879

Vivian's fingertips trembled slightly as her gaze darted between Isabella and Lucas.

The documents slipped from Isabella's grasp, hitting the floor with a soft thud.

"Viv, weren't you supposed to be in Paris?" Isabella's voice wavered.

Ethan's thumb traced slow circles on Vivian's palm, making her ears flush crimson.

"Forgot the files?" Vivian forced composure, diverting the topic. "There are backups in the study drawer."

Lucas's stare locked onto their intertwined hands, his brows furrowing deeply.

"Mr. Roscente, delivering someone this late?" Lucas's tone dripped with hostility.

Ethan casually draped an arm around Vivian's shoulders. "Not delivering. Coming home."

Isabella gasped, her purse nearly slipping from her grip.

"Home?" She parroted the word mechanically.

Vivian jerked away from Ethan's embrace. "He's joking!"

"I never joke about Viv." Ethan leisurely undid his cufflink. "She's my girlfriend now."

The air turned glacial.

Isabella's lips quivered. "Since when?"

"Three days ago." Ethan remained unruffled.

Vivian yanked his tie. "We need to talk outside!"

"Viv!" Isabella moved to follow but Lucas blocked her path.

In the hallway, Vivian pinned Ethan against the wall. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Clause Three of our contract." He leaned down, his breath grazing her ear. "Public acknowledgment of our relationship during the agreement period."

"That's for outsiders!" Vivian hissed through clenched teeth. "They're my closest friends!"

Ethan's lips brushed her earlobe. "Your resistance only fuels their suspicion."

Her breath hitched.

"Play along." His voice turned velvety. "Or our deal—"

Vivian shoved him away. "Are you threatening me?"

"A reminder." He straightened his wrinkled suit jacket. "Shall we resume our performance?"

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Five days." She spun on her heel, resolve flashing in her eyes. "Not a second more."

Ethan watched her retreating figure, a predator's smile curling his lips.
###Chapter 880

Vivian stood in the courtyard, the night breeze tangling her hair.

Her gaze lingered on the fallen leaves scattered across the ground as she pondered how to explain things to Isabella and Lucas later.

Those two were sharp—any clumsy lie would be instantly exposed.

What made it worse was Ethan's declaration of her being his "girlfriend," which had dug her into an even deeper hole.

Ethan's voice suddenly whispered by her ear, "I'll agree, but you owe me an extra day. Don't even think of running, Vivian. I'd chase you to the moon if I had to."

Regret twisted in her gut.

She never should have provoked this madman. Who would have guessed that beneath Ethan's icy exterior lay such obsessive determination?

If she could turn back time, she'd rather feed penguins in Antarctica than marry Ethan Roscente.

"Fine. One day," Vivian gritted out.

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Then I'll leave now. But before I go—"

He spread his arms, anticipation gleaming in his gaze.

Just wanting him gone, Vivian gave him a perfunctory hug and tried to pull away.

But Ethan suddenly tightened his arms, locking her firmly against him.

He buried his face in the crook of her neck, inhaling her scent like a man starved.

"Enough already! Isabella and Lucas are waiting!" Vivian stiffened.

"Never enough," Ethan murmured.

"Cut it out. Let go!"

Hearing the chill in her voice, he reluctantly released her.

"I'm leaving," he said, glancing back every few steps.

"Go already." Vivian turned her face away, her cheeks burning.

"Really leaving now." He paused again.

"Are you going or not?"

"It's my car. If you won't get out, does that mean you can't bear to see me go?"

Only then did Vivian realize she was still inside. She shoved the door open in irritation. "Drive safely."

Ethan's expression brightened instantly. "Anything for you."

Watching his taillights disappear, Vivian exhaled in relief.

But the real headache was yet to come—how would she explain this to those two sharp-eyed friends of hers?

The moment she turned around, she met two pairs of accusatory stares.

"Vivian!" Isabella planted her hands on her hips. "You sneak back without telling us, and now Ethan's spouting nonsense? What's going on?"

Lucas narrowed his eyes. "You'd better explain. Did he threaten you?"
###Chapter 881

"It's a long story. Let's go inside first."

Vivian Laurent pulled Isabella Langley and Lucas Lefèvre into the house, shivering from the biting wind outside.

The moment they stepped in, Isabella and Lucas cornered Vivian on the couch like interrogators.

"I did go abroad, but the climate wasn't suitable for pregnancy," Vivian twisted her fingers. "And I have patients waiting for me here."

She deliberately kept her tone casual.

Isabella arched a brow. "You said you loved it there."

Vivian cursed Ethan Roscente inwardly—he must have sent those messages from her phone.

"The scenery was nice, but my patients come first."

"What kind of patient is so urgent?" Isabella's gaze sharpened.

Vivian mentally classified Ethan as a critical case. "A rare condition. Only I can treat it."

"Isn't your pregnancy more important?"

"The due date is still far off. A few days won't matter." Vivian exhaled discreetly.

Isabella leaned in abruptly. "Then why did Ethan Roscente call you his girlfriend? Why did you only tell him you were back?"

The question struck like a dagger.

A thin layer of sweat formed on Vivian's back. "I ran into him right after landing. Pure coincidence."

"And?"

"We made a bet." Vivian grasped at straws. "I lost, so I had to pretend to be his girlfriend for two days."

The living room fell so silent a pin drop would echo.

Isabella scoffed. "Do I look like a toddler to you?"

"It's true!" Vivian doubled down. "Just playing along with his charade."

Isabella seized her wrist. "Did he threaten you?"

"Who could threaten me?" Vivian forced calm.

"Then he has dirt on you?"

Vivian's heart skipped. "What dirt could he possibly have?"

She couldn't reveal Ethan's actions—not with these two hotheads ready to storm his gates. This mess was complicated enough.

"Consider it a vacation." She deflected. "The baby isn't due anytime soon."

Vivian stared fixedly at the carpet pattern, afraid her guilt would show.
###Chapter 882

Isabella Langley sensed something was off.

Vivian Laurent's smile seemed forced.

"I'm perfectly fine," Vivian repeated, her tone measured. "Did you find the file?"

Isabella waved the folder. "It was in the study."

"Lucas, you can head out now." Isabella turned to Lucas Lefèvre. "I'll stay with Vivian tonight."

Lucas nodded. "Call me if you need anything, Viv."

Once he left, silence settled between the two women.

Vivian exhaled slightly—until Isabella spoke again.

"You might fool Lucas, but not me."

Vivian's smile froze.

"Did you come back for Ethan Roscente?" Isabella cut straight to the point.

Vivian's fingers twisted together unconsciously.

"You never stopped loving him." Isabella pressed closer. "The baby is his, isn't it? Are you here to end things for good?"

Vivian relaxed internally.

This misunderstanding couldn't have come at a better time.

"If that's what you think," she murmured.

Isabella sighed. "If you still love him, why not give it another shot? I can tell he still has feelings for you."

"We're not right for each other." Vivian shook her head.

"How so?" Isabella challenged. "Afraid he'll abandon you again?"

Vivian gave a bitter laugh. "Love isn't that simple."

She abruptly changed tactics. "Take you and Felix Valdemar—would you ever get back with him?"

Isabella bristled instantly. "Don't mention that bastard!"

"See? You're no different." Vivian smirked.

"That's not the same!" Isabella nearly stomped her foot. "You and Ethan were mutual. Felix and I are sworn enemies!"

"Really? No feelings at all?" Vivian arched a brow.

"Of course not!" Isabella gritted her teeth. "That playboy falls for every pretty face he sees. Disgusting!"

Vivian's smile turned knowing. "Yet you're always more... animated around him."

"Because I want to punch him!" Isabella clenched her fists. "If murder weren't illegal, I'd have—"

She stopped mid-sentence.

Vivian was giving her that look—the one that said I know better.
###Chapter 883

"Don't worry about Ethan and me."

Isabella's fingers turned pale around her coffee cup. As Vivian's closest friend, she wanted nothing more than to see her happy.

"As long as you're happy, that's all that matters."

Vivian's eyes welled up as she pulled Isabella into an embrace. In this world, few people supported her unconditionally—Isabella and Lucas were her strongest pillars.

"I'm exhausted."

"Go rest." Isabella patted her back. "The guest room is always ready for you."

After seeing Isabella out, Vivian stood by the floor-to-ceiling window. Ethan's car was no longer parked downstairs.

She sighed. What was supposed to be three days had stretched to four.

The next morning, Ethan unexpectedly didn't show. Vivian stared at her phone before finally making the call.

"What are your plans today?"

Ethan's deep chuckle came through the receiver. "I thought you'd be with Isabella."

"I'm coming to see you." Vivian's tone was decisive. "Send me the address."

Only after hanging up did she realize—where exactly was Ethan's "home"?

Her heartbeat quickened as she stood before the familiar mansion. This was their marital home, where she'd spent three lonely years.

She'd sold it without hesitation during the divorce. Yet Ethan had bought it back. And chosen to live here.

Every detail remained unchanged. Vivian hesitated at the doorstep, memories flooding back.

"Not coming in?"

Ethan's voice came from behind. She turned to see him carrying grocery bags, his shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms.

"How long have you lived here?"

"Since returning from abroad." He produced a key. "Care to see inside?"

The interior was frozen in time—even her favorite painting hung in its original spot.

"Don't you find this place too empty for one person?"

His voice carried from the kitchen: "I'm used to it."

The words struck a chord. She remembered waiting in this very house for someone who never came home.

"Any regrets?" she asked suddenly.

Ethan paused. "Every single day."

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting shifting patterns on the floor. Standing at the edge of light and shadow, Vivian found herself at a loss for words.
###Chapter 884

Vivian stood at the villa's entrance, her fingertips chilled by the evening air.

The door swung open.

Ethan's imposing figure appeared in the doorway, a small energetic shadow bouncing beside him.

"Aunt Vivian!"

Theo darted forward like an excited sparrow, wrapping his arms around her legs.

She crouched down to ruffle his soft hair.

"Why haven't you visited me for so long?" Theo pouted, his round eyes brimming with accusation.

Ethan observed them silently from a few steps away.

"I'm here now, aren't I?" Vivian pinched the boy's plump cheeks.

Theo instantly brightened, tugging her hand toward the interior.

"Come see my new toys!"

Ethan followed at a measured distance, maintaining exactly one meter between them.

Vivian glanced back at him.

"Four days left."

Her whisper carried clearly across the space.

He gave a curt nod, his gaze darkening.

Theo led her through the villa, chattering excitedly about each feature.

"Look at this swing set!"

"The glass conservatory shows all the stars at night!"

Familiar details pricked at Vivian's heart. These were all designs she'd personally created.

"Aunt Vivian," Theo suddenly looked up with hopeful eyes, "will you move in with us?"

She hesitated.

"You can have your own room here," the boy added insistently.

Nearby, Ethan pretended sudden interest in the garden view.

Kneeling to meet Theo's eye level, Vivian softened her voice.

"I have my own home now, but you can visit me anytime."

His lower lip trembled.

"Do you..." he fidgeted with his fingers, "...not like Uncle Ethan anymore?"

The question froze her.

"Why would you ask that?"

"Because..." his voice dwindled to a whisper, "other kids' parents all live together..."

Her chest constricted.

"Grown-up relationships are complicated. You'll understand when you're older."

"I'm four already!" He puffed out his small chest indignantly.

She couldn't suppress a smile.

"Then ask me again when you're twenty."

Theo suddenly leaned in, whispering conspiratorially:

"Are you in love with someone else? I won't tell Uncle Ethan!"

Ethan's shoulders visibly stiffened.
###Chapter 885

"I didn't."

Vivian Laurent eyed little Theo Evans warily, convinced the child was Ethan Roscente's tiny spy.

"Really?" Theo tilted his head, pressing further.

"Of course."

"Theo, let's go play downstairs." Vivian took his hand, eager to avoid any more awkward questions.

Downstairs, Ethan leaned against the sofa reviewing documents. Seeing them descend, he ruffled Theo's hair. "Theo, go play in the study."

"Okay, Uncle Ethan!" Theo scampered off excitedly.

The boy had shown an early fascination with medicine. At just four, he could already recognize thousands of Chinese characters. Whenever he encountered something unfamiliar, he'd pester Ethan relentlessly for explanations.

Ethan had specially prepared a complete set of medical primers for Theo and even hired a tutor. The household employed no live-in staff, only part-time cleaners and a cook.

"Had breakfast?"

"Yeah." Vivian nodded.

"What would you like for lunch? I'll cook."

"Don't trouble yourself." She glanced at the wall clock. "Any plans today?"

Ethan closed the file. "Just resting at home."

Vivian arched a brow. "Wasting a whole day?"

"Staying in counts as a date." He chuckled. "If you want to go out, we can leave now."

"Never mind. Home is fine." She rubbed her aching lower back. Two straight days of running around had left her exhausted.

"How about grocery shopping later?"

"Sure."

Around noon, they walked to a nearby supermarket.

Ethan pushed the cart, meticulously selecting ingredients—king crab, wagyu beef, Kurobuta pork... The cart quickly piled up like a small mountain.

"Buying all this?" Vivian stopped his reaching hand.

"Practice." His expression remained deadpan. "Might ruin a few dishes."

"You eat your failures."

"Deal."

Vivian tossed in some snack packs. Their striking good looks drew sidelong glances from passersby. Someone discreetly raised a phone, capturing the scene.
###Chapter 886

Vivian Laurent pushed her shopping cart through the supermarket's fresh produce section, carefully selecting ingredients. Ethan Roscente stood beside her, occasionally leaning down to ask for her opinion.

"These lobsters look good." Vivian pointed at the Australian lobsters in the chilled display.

Ethan immediately picked up the tongs and expertly selected two of the plumpest ones for their cart.

A passing customer secretly snapped a photo of the moment. The image quickly went viral online.

"Oh my god! CEO Roscente personally picking lobsters for Dr. Laurent! This is fairy tale romance!"

"I can't breathe! The way he looks at her is so tender. Who could resist this?"

"I've brought the marriage license office to you. Please get married right now!"

The comment section exploded as netizens gushed over the sweet moment. The photo rocketed to the top of trending searches with the hashtag #EthanVivianSupermarketDate.

Meanwhile, the two subjects remained blissfully unaware as they continued shopping.

Ethan's phone vibrated suddenly with a video call from Simon Eisner.

"Mr. Roscente, I've sent the quarterly reports to your email as requested," Simon's voice came through.

Vivian considerately stepped aside to give Ethan space for the call.

"I'll review them later." Ethan gave a brief response, though his gaze never left Vivian's retreating figure.

Sharp-eyed netizens captured this detail in screenshots, sparking another wave of online frenzy.

At the same time, Dominic Atlante came across the trending topic while scrolling through his phone in his office.

He stared at the screen with a furrowed brow. Just two days ago, Vivian had mentioned going abroad. Why was she suddenly grocery shopping with Ethan?

He immediately dialed Vivian's number, only to hear the automated message that her phone was switched off.

Elsewhere, Liam Valdemar glared darkly at his computer screen.

The image of Vivian standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ethan burned his eyes. He slammed the laptop shut, a dangerous glint flashing in his gaze.

"Shadow, you've made your choice clear," Liam muttered through clenched teeth. "Since you've chosen to stand against me, don't blame me for what comes next."

He picked up another phone and dialed a long-unused number.

"It's me," Liam said in a lowered voice. "Initiate Plan B."

Back at the supermarket, Vivian and Ethan had finished shopping and approached the checkout.

"Let me carry those." Ethan took all the grocery bags without waiting for her response.

Vivian opened her mouth to protest, but Ethan cut her off. "Leave the heavy lifting to me."

Laughing together, they walked toward the parking lot, completely unaware of the camera lens tracking their movements from the shadows.

After returning home, Ethan immediately tied on an apron and began preparing dinner.

"Need any help?" Vivian leaned against the kitchen doorway.

He turned with a smile. "Go relax. Dinner will be ready soon."

While expertly handling ingredients, he simultaneously managed company matters through his Bluetooth earpiece, moving with effortless efficiency.

Vivian watched his busy silhouette, an unconscious smile curving her lips. This man, known to the world as the ruthless business tycoon, was now rolling up his sleeves to cook for her.

Meanwhile, online discussions about them reached fever pitch. New photos surfaced continuously, with the top five trending topics all related to their relationship.

A brewing storm gathered momentum while the couple remained happily oblivious in their domestic bliss.
###Chapter 887

The aroma of cooking filled the kitchen as Ethan Roscente chopped vegetables with one hand while balancing his phone between his shoulder and ear.

"Mr. Roscente, why do I hear running water?" Simon Eisner's puzzled voice came through the receiver.

Ethan deftly sliced an onion into thin strips. "Preparing dinner."

"You're cooking yourself?" Simon nearly bit his tongue in shock.

Ignoring his assistant's astonishment, Ethan focused on the recipe's instructions for heat control.

"Unless there's anything else, I need to hang up. The fish is going in."

The call ended before Simon could respond.

Staring at the darkened screen, Simon couldn't reconcile the image of the ruthless negotiator from boardrooms now wearing an apron in a kitchen.

In the living room, Vivian Laurent's phone vibrated.

A message from Dominic Atlante appeared: "Since when are you and Ethan Roscente so close?"

Vivian frowned and typed back: "What do you mean?"

"Check trending."

She opened social media to find photos of her and Ethan grocery shopping had gone viral.

In the images, her hair was casually tied in a ponytail while Ethan pushed the cart beside her. They were selecting fruits, his head slightly tilted toward her with uncharacteristic gentleness.

The comments section exploded:
"Relationship goals!"
"That look he's giving her—I'm melting!"
"Someone get these two a marriage license!"

Her finger hovered over the screen before secretly saving the photo.

Their first candid picture together.

The clatter of cooking utensils drew her toward the kitchen.

Ethan stood at the stove, sleeves rolled to his elbows revealing toned forearms as he expertly flipped ingredients. The range hood hummed, casting flattering light on his focused profile.

"Need help?" Vivian leaned against the doorframe.

He immediately set down the spatula and approached.

"Go back out," he urged gently, steering her by the shoulders. "Grease isn't good for your skin."

His palms felt warm and dry, carrying a faint scent of fresh ingredients.

Vivian looked up. "I'm impressed by how quickly you've improved."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "For the right person, it's worth it."

Heat crept up her ears. As she turned to leave, his fingers circled her wrist.

"Ten more minutes," his voice lowered. "I made all your favorites tonight."
###Chapter 888

"No need. You keep cooking. I'll just stand here."

Vivian Laurent simply wanted to watch Ethan Roscente for a moment. Nothing more.

But she'd never admit it out loud. No need to inflate his ego.

"Hmm?" Ethan arched a brow, his gaze lingering on her face. What was she staring at? Him, or his cooking?

A bold suspicion flickered in his mind—

"Afraid you'll poison me," Vivian cut in first. "What if you drug me again?"

"Won't happen."

So that's what she was worried about.

Aside from that incident at the airport, he'd never used any sedatives on her again. Though the drug was harmless, he couldn't bring himself to do it.

"Who knows?" Vivian crossed her arms, leaning against the doorframe. "I feel safer keeping an eye on you."

"Suit yourself." Ethan chuckled helplessly, deftly handling the ingredients. He deliberately slowed his movements, ensuring she could see every step.

The spatula flipped, releasing an aromatic fragrance.

Vivian found herself staring at his slender fingers. That five-day agreement—had it been a trap all along?

She realized with a start that she didn't want to leave.

This man was too cunning. He'd woven a net of tenderness, just waiting for her to fall into it.

She couldn't let herself be fooled.

As she turned to leave, Ethan called out to her.

"Taste the seasoning." He picked up a piece of rib, blew on it to cool it, and held it to her lips.

"No."

"Just one bite." His voice softened, coaxing like he was speaking to a child.

Against her better judgment, Vivian opened her mouth.

The meat was tender, perfectly cooked. Far better than she'd expected.

His culinary skills had improved astronomically. From someone who could only make instant noodles, he'd reached this level—all for her sake.

The realization sent a tremor through her heart.

"Another piece?"

"No." She averted her face. "If I fill up now, how will I eat later?"

"What's there to worry about?" He picked up a piece of fish. "Consider it an appetizer."

"I'm not a child."

"In my eyes, you'll always be the little girl who needs looking after."

Vivian's ears burned as she hurried out of the kitchen. This man was too smooth—she needed to stay sharp.

Half an hour later, the dining table was laden with dishes.

Ethan went upstairs to call Theo for dinner. The boy was hunched over a medical textbook, brow furrowed.

"Aunt Vivian, I don't understand this case."

"Which part?"

"Why is aortic dissection treated this way?"

Vivian took the book and began explaining patiently. She didn't notice Ethan standing nearby, his gaze tender as water.

By the time the food was nearly cold, Ethan finally took the book from Theo's hands.

"Eat first." He ruffled the boy's hair. "Save your questions for after dinner."
###Chapter 889

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding the three figures in the dining room with golden edges. Ethan Roscente naturally placed a piece of sweet and sour pork rib on Vivian Laurent's plate before adding steamed sea bass to Theo Evans' bowl.

His gaze lingered tenderly between them. When their child was born, this family would feel even more complete.

"Uncle Ethan, these shrimp are so tender!" Theo mumbled through stuffed cheeks, his eyes crinkling into crescents.

"Eat as much as you like." Ethan ruffled the boy's hair. "Growing boys need to build strength."

"Mm!"

After dinner, Theo rubbed his rounded belly with satisfied hiccups. Even Vivian had eaten half a bowl more than usual, surprising herself at Ethan's rapid culinary improvement.

As she moved to clear the dishes, Ethan intercepted them. "I'll take Theo for a walk in the garden." Accepting effortlessly, Vivian led the bouncing boy outside.

Roses bloomed vibrantly in the garden.

"Auntie Viv." Theo suddenly tugged her sleeve, eyes sparkling. "Can we go to Disneyland tomorrow? With Uncle Ethan too?"

Vivian crouched to his eye level. "What do you want to ride?"

"Roller coasters! The Ferris wheel!" He animatedly gestured before hesitating. "But we can stay home if you're not feeling well."

Warmth flooded her chest. "It's alright, I'll go with you." She whispered conspiratorially, "Our secret—don't tell Uncle Ethan yet."

"Pinky promise!" Theo solemnly extended his little finger.

From the window, Ethan watched the pair in the garden. Sunlight traced Vivian's hair with gold as she bent down, her tender profile holding his gaze captive.

"Uncle Ethan!" Theo spotted him and waved excitedly.

By the time Ethan reached them, the boy had already burst out, "Auntie Viv said yes to Disneyland! You're coming too!"

"Of course." Ethan's eyes met Vivian's as she nodded with a soft smile.

That afternoon, the study carried the faint scent of ink. Theo peppered Vivian with questions about the anatomical model while she patiently explained meridian points. Seated behind the desk with documents on his lap, Ethan's attention kept drifting to the impromptu lesson.

Vivian spoke softly to avoid disturbing his work, yet each time she glanced up, she found his focused gaze waiting.

Theo absorbed knowledge like a sponge, his quick understanding revealing a budding genius. Watching them, Ethan felt an indescribable fullness in his chest.

This ordinary afternoon surpassed every beautiful scene he'd ever imagined.
###Chapter 890

The night deepened, the warmth of dinner still lingering in the air.

Vivian set down her chopsticks and glanced out the window. "It's getting late. I should head back."

Ethan caught her wrist. "Didn't we agree to take Theo to Disneyland tomorrow?"

His thumb traced slow circles over her pulse point.

"Stay. It'll be more convenient to leave from here in the morning."

She shook her head. "No."

A sly glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. "You still owe me that bet you lost last time."

He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "How about tonight?"

Vivian's ears burned. "You—"

Ethan closed the distance between them. "Hmm?"

She bit her lip. "I'll stay, but you have to promise—"

"I promise." His voice was earnest, cutting her off mid-sentence.

"I don't even have a change of clothes."

"They'll be here soon."

Thirty minutes later, Vivian stood beneath the shower spray.

The familiar tiles and corners of this bathroom held three years' worth of memories.

The master bedroom remained unchanged.

Yet the man she'd once longed for now stood just beyond the door.

When Ethan entered, Vivian was seated at the vanity.

He wore only a towel, water droplets sliding from his hair down to his collarbones. The defined lines of his abs disappeared beneath the towel's edge.

Vivian jerked her face away. "Why aren't you dressed?"

"Who wears clothes to sleep?" His innocent expression didn't fool her.

"Go put on pajamas. Now!"

Laughing, Ethan retreated to the bathroom.

He emerged moments later in dark blue silk pajamas, damp hair falling across his forehead. Pushing it back, he revealed those intense eyes.

"Vivi." His voice was soft.

She pretended to focus on her phone.

"Your hair's still wet." He picked up the hairdryer. "Let me."

"I can—"

"You'll get a headache."

Before she could protest, warm air streamed through her locks as his fingers combed through them with featherlight care.

Vivian leaned against the bed, distracted by her screen.

"Vivi."

"Hmm?"

"Can I dry your hair for you every day from now on?"

"Sure."

His hands stilled. "You mean that?"

"What?" She looked up, instantly wary.

The corner of Ethan's mouth curved in triumph.
###Chapter 891

"I'll be the one to dry your hair from now on."

"When did I ever agree to that?"

"Just now."

"That doesn't count! I didn't even hear what you said!"

Ethan Roscente's lips curved into a smirk. "Words spoken can't be taken back."

Vivian Laurent turned to pinch his cheek in frustration. "Ethan Roscente, are you being shameless again?"

"Wouldn't dare." He let her pinch him, his hand resting firmly at her waist. "If you don't like the idea, forget I mentioned it."

"You've never been honest a day in your life."

"Oh?" Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Tell me, where exactly am I dishonest?"

"Every inch of you."

Suddenly, Ethan cupped her face. "Since you've said so, I can't possibly disappoint you."

His lips inched closer.

The kiss came slowly, giving her ample time to pull away.

But Vivian only stared into his eyes, unmoving.

When their lips finally met, Ethan merely brushed against hers. This teasing touch sent her heart racing far more than any passionate kiss could.

A tingling sensation spread across Vivian's lips, like ants crawling over them. Her eyes remained open, tracing the curve of his lashes.

"Vivian, close your eyes."

She obeyed instinctively, just as he deepened the kiss.

Moments later, Vivian shoved him away and burrowed under the covers, pulling them over her head completely.

"I'm going to sleep."

Ethan chuckled lowly, lying down beside her. When he reached out to pull her close, she slapped his hand away.

"Don't push your luck. Our bet only said we'd share a bed—not that you could get handsy."

That kiss had already been an exception. She wouldn't allow anything more.

"I just want to hold you while we sleep."

"No! Stay on your side of the blanket. Cross the line, and I'll kick you off!"

Vivian knew sleep would elude her tonight. How could she possibly rest with Ethan so close?

Lately, insomnia had plagued her, leaving her tossing until dawn. This bed had been hers for three years—she never imagined returning to it.

Amidst her chaotic thoughts, she expected to lie awake until morning.

Yet against all odds, she slept soundly through the night, not waking until the sun was high.

Half-asleep, she vaguely recalled nestling against a warm furnace, instinctively seeking its heat.

Winter nights usually left the sheets cold, but tonight they stayed wonderfully warm. Even the baby in her womb remained unusually still.

Only when morning sunlight touched her face did Vivian realize—

The comforting warmth she'd clung to had been Ethan's embrace.
###Chapter 892

"Ethan Roscente!" Vivian Laurent jolted awake to find herself plastered against the man's chest. "I specifically told you not to cross the line!"

Ethan blinked sleepily, feigning innocence.

"You rolled over to me, Vivian."

"Nonsense!" She automatically denied it, then froze when she saw their actual positions.

Her side of the bed lay completely vacant while she clung to Ethan like an octopus. Worse, her arm was draped possessively around his waist.

"..." Heat rushed to her ears as she hastily withdrew her limbs. "Sorry. I was half-asleep."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "Don't apologize. I didn't mind at all."

Vivian pretended not to hear, stretching conspicuously. "We should get up. We're taking Theo to Disneyland today."

As she moved to rise, Ethan suddenly caught her wrist. "Three days left."

"I know." She shook off his grip. "Which is why we should make the most of them, right?"

Downstairs after washing up, they found Theo already dressed and waiting in the living room.

The boy had recovered well, his facial scars nearly faded as he hugged a toy car while watching the staircase eagerly.

"Aunt Viv!"
"Uncle Ethan!"

His cheerful voice dispelled the morning's awkwardness.

After breakfast, Ethan stopped them at the door.

"Wait."

He returned from the walk-in closet with three paper bags containing matching down jackets.

"Family outfits?" Vivian frowned.

Theo was already bouncing excitedly. "I wanna wear it! Aunt Viv too!"

Ethan smoothly handed over the children's size, which the boy immediately hugged before rubbing against Vivian's legs with pleading puppy-dog eyes.

With a resigned sigh, she ruffled his hair. "Fine."

A triumphant gleam flashed in Ethan's eyes as he produced two cashmere scarves.

"I'll do it myself." Vivian reached out.

Instead, Ethan stepped behind her, his long fingers deftly wrapping the scarf around her neck. His warm breath brushed her ear, making her unconsciously hold her breath.

"Done." He stepped back, admiring his handiwork as she resembled a wrapped dumpling. "Now you won't get cold."

Theo grabbed both their hands, jumping eagerly. "Let's go!"
###Chapter 893

The biting winter wind couldn't dampen the lively atmosphere of Disneyland.

Theo dashed forward excitedly the moment they entered.

"Slow down!" Vivian called after him.

Ethan Roscente quickly caught up. The trio looked like a perfect family.

Children's laughter filled the air around the amusement rides.

"Which one do you want to try?" Vivian crouched to ask Theo.

Ethan had specifically warned them to avoid dangerous attractions earlier. Theo scanned the area and pointed at the bumper cars.

"That one!"

It was perfect for three people.

"Alright, let's do this."

Vivian and Theo shared one car with Theo at the wheel. Ethan took another car to challenge them.

"Uncle Ethan, I won't go easy on you!" Theo declared proudly.

"Neither will I," Ethan replied with a faint smirk.

Their cars chased and collided across the arena. Though young, Theo drove with surprising focus. Despite his words, Ethan deliberately held back—mostly to avoid jostling Vivian.

Theo's laughter rang like silver bells.

After bumper cars, they headed to the water gun zone. Vivian stood outside the play area, snapping photos with her phone. Ethan rarely took pictures, but childhood was fleeting.

These moments would become precious memories.

The pirate ship, carousel, trampoline park... Theo enjoyed every minute, even making new friends.

Not just Theo—Ethan cherished this time too.

He knew only two days remained before their agreement expired.

"Vivian, give me your hand," Ethan suddenly said.

"No need." She kept her eyes on Theo.

"I'm still your boyfriend right now."

"Reminding me the trial period is almost over?" She feigned sternness.

"Can we extend it?"

"No!"

"Are you reminding me... or yourself?" His gaze deepened. "Haven't you wavered at all these days?"

"About what?" She looked away.

"Stay. Let's keep living like this. I promise my feelings won't end with our agreement."

His tenderness made her unable to meet his eyes.
###Chapter 894

"Let's not talk about this now. Theo is still playing over there." Vivian quickly changed the subject, her gaze following the little boy playing nearby.

Ethan chuckled softly. "Don't worry, Theo's having fun."

His tone shifted suddenly. "Vivian, who do you think our future child would take after?"

"Our home will be livelier then. I'll take good care of you all." Ethan's voice carried gentle determination. "Including Theo. I'll learn to be a proper father."

Vivian's heart clenched. Her fingers tightened around the hem of her dress, nails nearly digging into her palms.

Why was he bringing up children now?

Had he discovered something? Impossible. She'd been so careful.

"That day will never come." Vivian stared into the distance, her voice eerily calm. "We ended things long ago."

The sharp pain in her palm kept her grounded. She wondered if the child growing inside her would hate her for this decision.

"We never ended." Ethan's declaration left no room for argument.

The tense moment shattered when Theo came running toward them, cheeks flushed with excitement.

"Auntie! Uncle!"

Vivian's heart softened at the sight of the boy's rosy face. Though not her biological child, her love for Theo was genuine.

"Hungry?" Vivian crouched down, using her handkerchief to wipe Theo's forehead. "Shall we get some lunch?"

They ate at the amusement park's casual dining spot. Theo immediately dragged them to the sandpit afterward.

"This is our house!" Theo declared proudly as he shaped his sandcastle. "Here's me, and Uncle and Auntie... We need to add a baby brother!"

Vivian's breath caught. If not for the child's innocent expression, she might have thought he knew her secret.

"Do you want a brother, Theo?"

"Of course!" Theo waved his little shovel. "I'll protect him! Nobody can bully him!"

"What if it's a sister?"

"Even better!" Theo's eyes sparkled. "I'll be the best big brother ever!"

Vivian couldn't help smiling. She would give Theo a sibling—just not yet.

"Vivian, you..." Ethan began hesitantly.

"Just making conversation." Vivian brushed it off lightly.

As sunset painted the sky, park lights flickered to life. Another day slipped away—leaving only two more days counting down between her and Ethan.
###Chapter 895

The echoes of laughter from Disneyland still lingered in her ears. Ethan Roscente gripped the steering wheel, glancing at the rearview mirror. Vivian Laurent was playing with Theo in the backseat, a faint smile curving her lips.

The black sedan glided into the gated community. Vivian looked up, her brow furrowing at the familiar mansion silhouette.

"Why are we here again?" She pushed the car door open, night breeze brushing her cheeks.

Ethan stepped in front of her. "It's too late."

"I want to go home." She avoided his gaze.

Theo scrambled out and tugged her sleeve. "Aunt Viv, don't leave."

Ethan seized the moment. "The guest room is ready."

Under the streetlight, his chiseled features looked particularly striking. Vivian remembered the warmth of his embrace last night, her ears growing warm.

"Just one night," she heard herself say.

The dining room glowed with soft lighting. Vivian scrolled through photos on her camera. "We took some good ones today."

Theo leaned in, eyes sparkling. "This one's perfect!"

The photo showed Ethan holding Theo before the carousel, his usually stern expression relaxed. Vivian found herself staring at it.

"Let's make an album!" Theo cheered.

"Sure," Vivian agreed easily. "I'll get them printed tomorrow."

Alone in the bedroom, Vivian stood by the window. She knew this room too well—over a thousand nights spent within these walls.

The bed felt plush yet unfamiliar. She burrowed under the covers but couldn't find a comfortable position.

The AC read 26°C. She adjusted it to 28°C, yet her hands and feet remained icy. No amount of blankets could dispel the inexplicable chill.

Tree shadows danced outside. Tossing restlessly, realization struck her.

The warmth from last night was now separated by two walls.

She bolted upright, then forced herself back down. Her mind replayed the solid feel of his arms, the steady rhythm of his breathing.

The pillow carried a faint cedar scent. Pressing her face into it, Vivian heard her own heartbeat loud in the silent night.

The room suddenly felt cavernously empty without him.
###Chapter 896

Vivian Laurent rolled over, pulling the blanket tighter around her.

Without Ethan Roscente beside her, the bed felt unnervingly empty.

She stared at the ceiling, frustration simmering in her chest.

"It's just a man. No big deal," she muttered under her breath.

But the harder she tried to dismiss him, the clearer his image became in her mind.

She grabbed her phone. 1:00 AM glared back at her.

"Damn it!" She sat up abruptly.

The AC in the master bedroom was set too low. The cold floor sent a shiver up her bare feet as she stepped down.

She tiptoed to the guest room door.

A sliver of light peeked through the gap.

Pushing the door open quietly, she found Ethan lying on his back, breathing steadily.

The bedside lamp cast a soft glow on his sharp jawline.

"Sleeping so soundly, huh?" She pursed her lips and crept closer.

Her icy fingers hovered inches from his face—

When his hand snapped around her wrist.

"Ah!" She gasped as she was yanked into a warm embrace.

Ethan's eyes gleamed with mischief in the dim light.

"Sneaking into my room in the middle of the night?"

Vivian struggled against him. "I wasn't sneaking! I just... wanted to check if you were sleeping well!"

His low chuckle vibrated through her as his arms tightened. "Satisfied?"

The heat of his body seeped through his thin pajamas, making her cheeks burn.

"Let me go!"

"Not a chance." He pulled her closer. "You're not leaving now."

He draped the blanket over them both, his fingers closing around her cold hands.

"Why are your hands freezing?" He frowned. "AC too low again?"

She turned her face away. "None of your business."

Ethan pressed her palms against his chest. "Of course it's my business. You can't even take care of yourself."

"Who says I can't?" She glared at him. "I was doing just fine alone!"

He looked down at her pouting face and kissed her forehead.

"Sure, sure. You're absolutely perfect."

Just as she opened her mouth to retort, a sneeze escaped her.

Ethan immediately pulled her tighter. "See? You're getting sick."

His warm hand rubbed soothing circles on her back.

"Sleep. I've got you."

Curled against him, listening to his steady heartbeat, Vivian felt something strange—

The insomnia that had plagued her all night melted away.

As drowsiness finally claimed her, one thought drifted through her mind:

Maybe... having someone beside her wasn't so bad after all.
###Chapter 897

"It's different." Ethan Roscente's voice was deep and tender. "Having me by your side means taking care of you is my responsibility. Isn't it better to have someone who cares about you?"

"No." Vivian Laurent stubbornly turned her face away. "I'm used to being alone. I don't need anyone looking after me."

Yet she made no move to leave. Ethan's embrace was warm as spring, far more comforting than any air conditioner.

"Maybe you'll get used to it in time," he murmured near her ear.

His voice was like a lullaby. Vivian's eyelids grew heavier by the second. Strange—she had been wide awake just moments ago.

"Stay tonight. You'll sleep better with me here."

"Vivi, don't go."

Ethan waited, but the woman in his arms didn't respond. Glancing down, he found her already asleep against his chest.

He was surprised she'd drifted off so quickly and didn't dare move. Even as his arm went numb, he remained perfectly still, afraid to wake her.

Reaching over, he turned off the bedside lamp. Though he longed to study her sleeping face, simply holding her like this was happiness enough.

So Vivian did rely on him after all. His efforts these past few days hadn't been in vain.

Vivian slept deeply that night, though the "mattress" felt unusually firm. When she opened her eyes, she realized she'd spent the entire night sprawled on top of Ethan.

She had clung to him like an octopus. Last night she'd meant to cause trouble—how had he lulled her to sleep instead?

Slipping away before Ethan woke, she cringed at the memory. How embarrassing—she'd slept so soundly in his arms.

Was her insomnia really because she'd been missing him? The thought unsettled her.

Only two days left. After tomorrow, she would disappear for good.

Pulling out her phone, she booked a flight. This time, she'd shake Ethan off completely. The last incident had taught her enough—she wouldn't give him another chance.

Though she'd grown accustomed to his presence these past days, she knew she could quit this dependency. No one was truly irreplaceable.

Vivian Laurent had never needed to rely on anyone.
###Chapter 898

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the restaurant. Vivian Laurent rubbed her sore ankle.

She had just finished a full day at Disneyland and was ready to reward herself.

"That table." Vivian pointed to the last empty corner booth.

"I'm taking that spot!"

Victoria Roscente strode over in high heels, her skirt swaying with each step.

Bianca Semona followed behind, casting a complicated glance at Vivian.

Ever since their misunderstanding was cleared up, Bianca couldn't meet Vivian's eyes directly.

"What a coincidence," Bianca murmured.

Victoria snorted, tapping her manicured nails sharply against the tabletop.

Vivian didn't even look up. "Hmm."

"Should we... share the table?" Bianca ventured.

Victoria yanked her wrist. "Are you insane?"

Vivian leisurely pulled out a chair. "I'd lose my appetite."

"Who are you calling disgusting?" Victoria's voice rose sharply.

"I didn't name anyone." Vivian finally lifted her gaze. "Unless you think so yourself?"

Victoria's lips trembled with rage.

"Some people belong in the trash," she spat through clenched teeth.

Vivian suddenly smiled. "Need me to arrange that for you?"

"Ethan!" Victoria turned to Ethan Roscente. "She's threatening me!"

Ethan was perusing the menu. "Sounds reasonable to me."

Bianca hurried to mediate. "Let's all calm down."

Vivian had already taken her seat, tapping the table lightly. "First come, first served."

A nervous waiter approached with menus.

"I don't mind sharing a table." Vivian opened her menu. "After all, I won't be the uncomfortable one."
###Chapter 899

"If you don't care, why should I?" Victoria Roscente scoffed coldly, taking a seat directly across from Vivian Laurent.

The four of them sat around the dining table in an awkward silence.

Vivian found the situation surreal—she was actually sharing a meal with Victoria and Bianca Semona.

Ethan Roscente slid the menu toward Vivian. "What would you like?"

When Vivian ordered foie gras, Victoria immediately interrupted. "No foie gras. I hate that smell."

"Choosy beggars shouldn't complain," Vivian said without looking up. "Don't eat it if you don't like it." She turned to the waiter. "Two orders of foie gras, please."

Victoria's eyes burned with anger as she glared at Vivian.

Every dish Vivian chose, Victoria objected to. But no one paid her any attention.

Soon the table was filled with Vivian's favorite dishes. Victoria sulked and refused to eat, prompting Ethan to suggest she leave if she wasn't hungry.

Clenching her teeth, Victoria stayed. She'd come here to make Vivian miserable.

Bianca ordered red wine and raised her glass. "Vivian, I owe you an apology for my past behavior. Thank you for your forgiveness."

"I'm naturally magnanimous," Vivian waved her hand dismissively. "But I'll pass on the wine. Consider the matter closed."

She just wanted peace, as long as Bianca didn't provoke her again.

"Refusing even a toast? That's hardly sincere," Bianca pressed.

Ethan picked up the wine glass. "Vivian isn't feeling well. I'll drink for her."

"Ethan!" Victoria stomped her foot in frustration.

"Of course I'd drink for my girlfriend," Ethan stated matter-of-factly.

Vivian massaged her temples. He was at it again. With only six days left on their contract, she'd have a hard time explaining this later.

Victoria and Bianca exchanged shocked glances. Were they really together?

Bianca remembered how dazzled she'd been when she first met Ethan. That radiant man had never even glanced her way.

She'd prided herself as a gemstone appraisal prodigy—until Vivian appeared. This woman's talent left her in the dust.

Perhaps only someone as extraordinary as Vivian deserved Ethan.

Bianca raised her glass again. "To your happiness."

Ethan nodded. "Thank you."
###Chapter 900

Vivian Laurent sat quietly at the dining table, watching Ethan Roscente chat animatedly with their elders. They discussed wedding details as if they were heading to the courthouse tomorrow.

Bianca Semona set down her chopsticks, her plate nearly untouched. Her gaze lingered on Vivian’s radiant presence, bitterness welling in her chest. She knew she could never catch up to Vivian, but at least she could excel in her own field.

Victoria Roscente’s face darkened. She had intended to humiliate Vivian, only to be outmaneuvered instead. Abruptly, she stood and stormed out without a backward glance.

"Victoria!" Bianca hurried after her.

Outside the restaurant, Victoria angrily shook off Bianca’s hand. "You’re just letting Vivian off like that? Have you forgotten what she did to us?"

"We provoked her first," Bianca murmured.

"You’re defending her?" Victoria’s eyes widened in disbelief. "What spell has she cast on you?"

Bianca sighed. "Stop fighting her. We’re no match."

"Ridiculous!" Victoria scoffed. "I refuse to accept that." She strode away in her heels, leaving Bianca no choice but to follow.

Back inside, Vivian savored each bite of her meal.

"Delicious," she remarked casually.

Ethan immediately responded, "We’ll come here every week."

Vivian shot him a look. "I’ll come alone." She wiped her lips and set down her napkin.

"Have more?" Ethan asked, concerned.

"I’m full," Vivian shook her head. "Overeating isn’t good for digestion."

"Let me massage your stomach?" He reached out playfully.

A single glare from Vivian made him retreat. As they left the restaurant, she declared, "Take me home."

This time, Ethan didn’t argue. He drove in silence. But when they arrived, he stepped out after her.

"What are you doing?" Vivian blocked the doorway.

"I want to stay with you," he said, his eyes dimming. "There’s only tomorrow left."

Her heart clenched. He was right—time was running out. She turned and walked inside, tossing over her shoulder, "Do what you want."

She’d already decided he’d sleep on the couch. The man followed like a silent shadow.
###Chapter 901

Vivian thought six days would feel long.

But time slipped through her fingers like sand.

These past days had been unexpectedly light and joyful.

Tomorrow would be their final day.

She tossed and turned in bed until dawn's first light.

When she came downstairs, Ethan had already prepared breakfast.

"Where should we go today?" She rubbed her temples.

Ethan flipped the omelet. "Nowhere. We're staying home."

Vivian froze.

"Really?"

"Mhm."

She nodded and sipped her oatmeal.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding the dining table.

Exhaustion weighed on Vivian as she slumped against the sofa.

Ethan's gaze never left her.

His eyes held too many unspoken emotions.

After tomorrow, she would be gone.

The mere thought tore through his chest like shrapnel.

A phone ring shattered the silence.

Vivian jolted awake seeing Zachary's caller ID.

"Senior?"

"Junior, are you in town? A mass casualty incident downtown—we need you."

"On my way!"

She bolted for the door.

"Drive me to the hospital!"

Ethan grabbed his keys without hesitation.

During the ride, Vivian bit her lip. "Sorry about today."

"Lives come first."

Chaos engulfed the ER.

Vivian scrubbed in and vanished into the OR.

Ethan stayed outside coordinating with families.

Minutes bled into hours.

His frown deepened watching the surgery light.

Vivian hadn't eaten in ten hours.

At 10 PM, the OR doors finally swung open.

She emerged drenched in sweat.

Ethan handed her warm water.

"Eat." He opened the thermal container.

"I need to check ICU."

"Food first." His grip anchored her shoulder.

The aroma of homecooked meals filled the sterile hallway.
###Chapter 902

Vivian's stomach had long gone numb. Only when she tasted the food did hunger awaken within her again.

She hastily ate a few bites before rushing to the ICU.

The horrific car accident had been caused by a sociopathic driver seeking revenge. The man had deliberately run a red light, plowing through pedestrians on the crosswalk and even backing up to run them over again.

Some victims died instantly. Most survivors were in critical condition, requiring intensive monitoring. Vivian needed to personally check on each patient.

Ethan watched her bustling figure with a pang in his chest. Their final day together slipped away amidst the sterile hospital smells. Her attention remained fixed on her patients, as if she'd already forgotten his existence.

At midnight, Vivian was still working in the ICU.

Their agreement had expired, yet Ethan's feet seemed rooted to the ground, unwilling to leave.

At 1 AM, Vivian finally pushed through the doors, her face as pale as paper.

"Vivian." His voice was soft.

She looked up. "Why are you still here?"

"Worried about you. Are you done? Let me drive you home."

"I'm on night shift. Dr. Clementson is short-staffed." She shook her head. "You should rest."

"I'll stay with you."

"How would that help?" Her tone turned cool. "Go sleep in the lounge. Don't get in the way."

Ethan took two steps back, his Adam's apple bobbing. He knew it was time to let go.

"Alright." The word came out strained. "Take care of yourself."

"Goodbye, Vivian."

As he turned, the hallway lights cast his silhouette in stark loneliness. Vivian's fingers trembled slightly, the urge to call him back rising in her throat.

But the lounge sofa couldn't possibly fit two people. Why make him suffer through that?

In the end, she simply watched until he disappeared down the corridor.

Exhaustion crashed over her like a tide, yet sleep eluded Vivian. Though she'd been struggling to keep her eyes open earlier, now she felt unnervingly alert.

Strange. Only two nights sharing a bed with Ethan, and already she couldn't sleep without his warmth. She needed to readjust to solitude quickly.

Yesterday should have been their final day together, yet work had consumed every moment. Ethan must have been so disappointed.

If they'd lasted six days, what was one more? A full week sounded more complete somehow.

Vivian pulled out her phone and made several late-night calls.

At dawn, Ethan's phone rang unexpectedly.

"Vivian?" His voice shook with surprise. He'd thought last night's farewell was their ending, never expecting to hear from her again.

"Are you free?"

"Of course!"

"Come pick me up at the hospital." She paused. "Be my driver for one more day."

"I'll be right there."

Gripping the steering wheel, Ethan assumed this time he'd truly be taking her to the airport—their final goodbye.
###Chapter 903

Ethan Roscente rushed to the hospital in such a hurry that he barely registered Vivian Laurent's request for him to "be her driver for the day."

He never denied her anything. Within half an hour, he sped from his home to the hospital, still clutching a bag of steaming breakfast.

Vivian ate unhurriedly while Ethan trailed behind her like an overeager golden retriever.

Only after settling into the car did she finally speak. "Aren't you going to ask where we're going?"

"I know."

Her brow arched. "You know?"

Had he been having her followed?

Ethan kept his eyes on the road. "The airport, right? You're leaving today. I keep my promises—five days are up, so I'll let you go."

Vivian rolled her eyes.

"Not the airport."

"The train station?" His grip on the steering wheel tightened.

"Seattle. Now."

Ethan drove with practiced ease, arriving at the Seattle marina within an hour.

"A yacht trip?" He glanced at her in confusion.

"Can you pilot one?"

"Of course." Memories of Santorini Island flickered through his mind.

Vivian pointed toward the horizon. "Head that way."

The yacht docked at a secluded island.

Ethan couldn't hold back any longer. "Vivian, what is this?"

"I was too busy yesterday. Owed you a day." She gazed at the ocean. "Consider this me paying up."

Turning to face him directly, she said, "For our last date, I'll make the arrangements."

Ethan's pupils constricted. His heart hammered wildly.

He pulled her into a crushing embrace, voice trembling. "Thank you—"

"Let go!" She thumped his back. "I just don't like owing people."

Ethan cut her off immediately. "I don't care!"

Vivian laughed despite herself. "I wasn't finished."

Teasing him, she added, "What if I told you to jump into the sea?"
###Chapter 904

"I'd jump if you asked me to." Ethan Roscente's intense gaze burned into Vivian Laurent.

"Ridiculous." She rolled her eyes. "What if you start whining about pain afterward? I'd have to take responsibility."

"I never lie to you."

"Sure you don't. Follow me."

Vivian turned toward the luxury resort hotel nearby.

The private island had been transformed into an exclusive getaway, with the only five-star hotel nestled along the pristine beach. Today, the entire property had been reserved for Vivian's use.

"Lunch is ready, sir and madam." A waiter greeted them with a bow.

The two-hour drive had brought them just in time for the meal. Vivian had arranged an exquisite seafood feast in advance.

After dining, she instructed the staff to set up lounge chairs and umbrellas by the shore.

"I'm taking a nap. You go fish."

"Here?" Ethan eyed the calm waters skeptically.

"Of course." Vivian smirked. "What we have for dinner depends entirely on your skills."

"I'll make sure you eat the freshest catch."

It had been ages since Ethan last enjoyed such leisurely fishing. Vivian stretched out on the adjacent chair, basking in the December sun.

The winter light was gentle, lulling her into drowsiness. She yawned, still tired from working late the night before.

Was this considered a date now?

Ethan kept one eye on his fishing line while stealing glances at Vivian.

She lay curled on her side, her face half-buried in the plush collar of her coat. Long lashes cast delicate shadows beneath her eyes as the sea breeze played with loose strands of her hair.

Quietly rising, Ethan fetched a cashmere throw from the hotel and draped it over her sleeping form.

Dappled sunlight filtered through palm fronds, painting shifting patterns across her face. The scene belonged in a painting.

Unable to resist, he pulled out his phone and snapped dozens of photos.

Every frame was perfection.

Just as he adjusted for another angle, Vivian's eyes flew open.

"Ethan Roscente!" She bolted upright.

"Theo misses you..." He fumbled to hide the phone.

"Liar! Hand it over!" She lunged for the device. "How many awful photos did you take?"

"Just...a few." His guilty fingers touched his nose.

In reality, his gallery now held over two hundred new images.

"I must look ridiculous drooling in my sleep. Delete them!"

"You're beautiful in every way." His gaze softened. "I want to remember every moment with you."

"Stop sweet-talking." She glared. "Where are the fish? How many did you catch?"

Ethan: "......"

He'd been too distracted watching her. The bait had been stolen clean.
###Chapter 905

"An empty creel? Planning to starve me tonight?" Vivian propped her chin on her palm, staring at the still water.

Ethan tucked his phone back into his pocket, adjusting the fishing line. "Patience. I'll make sure you taste the freshest catch."

Vivian grabbed the spare rod and deftly baited the hook. Outings with this man always made her worry about going hungry—she had to fend for herself.

"Care for a competition? Let's see who catches more."

Ethan arched a brow. "What's the prize for winning?"

"Always calculating benefits. How crude." She cast her line into the water. "Pure sport. You in?"

"Game on."

The float trembled. With a flick of his wrist, Ethan pulled a silvery fish from the water. "First one." He shook his catch teasingly.

Vivian scoffed. "It's just the beginning."

What followed was nothing short of surreal. Ethan's line kept tightening one after another while Vivian's float remained motionless.

"Did you send the fish your GPS coordinates?" She kicked his folding chair lightly.

Ethan deadpanned, "Must be their aesthetic preference."

Vivian grabbed a handful of bait and scattered it across the water. As the fish swarmed, she finally landed two. By sunset, Ethan led by three.

"Too much to eat." Vivian released most of the fish, keeping only the plumpest two.

The charcoal grill was already prepared. Ethan skillfully scaled the fish, and soon the scent of searing flesh wafted from the iron grate. He deboned a piece and held the tender white meat to Vivian's lips.

Dusk enveloped them, leaving only the sound of waves on this stretch of shore far from city lights. Vivian tightened her sweater but still shivered in the night breeze.

"Cold?" Ethan moved to remove his jacket.

"Don't." She stopped his hand. "Just fetch the blanket."

A cashmere throw, warm from his body heat, settled over her shoulders. Vivian sighed at the starless sky. "Pity there's no starlight."

"It'll come." His gaze lingered on her profile, illuminated by the firelight.

Vivian chuckled. "Since when can you summon stars?"

A sudden shift in the sea wind tousled the strands at her temples. In Ethan's pupils danced twin flames—like stars fallen into deep waters.
###Chapter 906

"Where are the stars?" Vivian Laurent gazed up at the pitch-black night sky.

Ethan Roscente flashed a mysterious smile. "Give me a few minutes."

He stepped aside to make a phone call. Vivian pouted, thinking even this formidable man couldn't conjure stars out of thin air.

Soon Ethan returned, whispering in her ear, "Just wait."

Vivian blinked. "While we wait, let me show you my gift first."

"You prepared something too?" Ethan's eyes lit up.

Vivian pointed toward the distant sea. Suddenly, fireworks shot into the sky, exploding into brilliant bursts of color. The dazzling lights illuminated the entire horizon, their reflections shimmering across the water.

Ethan's pupils mirrored the fireworks' glow. He hadn't expected Vivian to orchestrate such a grand surprise.

The fireworks continued endlessly, painting the night. They stood side by side, immersed in this spectacle meant solely for Ethan.

"Do you like it?" Vivian asked softly.

Ethan nodded like an excited boy. "It's breathtaking!"

He'd never witnessed such magnificent fireworks, let alone imagined Vivian would arrange them for him.

Watching Ethan's moved expression, Vivian suppressed a laugh. This usually commanding man now resembled a child receiving candy.

"Vivi, thank you." Ethan suddenly turned, his gaze deepening as he looked at her.

No firework could compare to the woman before him.

"As long as you're happy." Vivian smiled faintly.

Ethan's eyes remained locked on her face. Without warning, he cupped the back of her head and kissed her fiercely.

"Mmph!" Vivian's eyes widened. She'd been watching the fireworks!

Ethan's kiss was relentless, leaving no room for refusal. He knew this might anger her, but he couldn't control himself.

This was their final moment—he refused to have regrets.

Vivian initially tried to push him away but soon surrendered. Her fingers clutched his shirt collar.

Fireworks bloomed above them as the sea breeze caressed their faces. The moment felt impossibly romantic.

Since resistance was futile, Vivian closed her eyes and returned the passionate kiss.

Let this last embrace become their most beautiful memory.
###Chapter 907

Fireworks exploded across the night sky, painting the city in dazzling colors. Crowds gazed upward, murmuring about which wealthy romantic had orchestrated this spectacle.

On the private island's beach, Ethan Roscente's lips still lingered on Vivian Laurent's. His kiss was tender yet intoxicating, making her forget to breathe.

The abrupt ringtone shattered the moment. Vivian pushed him away as if waking from a dream.

Ethan glanced at the caller ID and declined the call, swiftly typing a message instead.

The air between them grew charged. Vivian tilted her face toward the heavens. "The fireworks are beautiful."

Streaks of light like falling stars blazed across the sky, their fleeting brilliance heartbreaking. Despite meticulous planning, the display ended too soon.

"Thank you, Vivian." Ethan's voice was low.

Her ears tinged pink. "What for?"

"Close your eyes." He suddenly covered them with his palm. "Just for a moment."

"What are you doing?" She obeyed, eyelids fluttering shut.

His hand felt cool yet strangely comforting.

Minutes later, he withdrew his touch. "Open them."

Vivian slowly lifted her lashes—and gasped.

The once-dark sky now shimmered with countless stars beneath a radiant moon. Looking closer, she realized the glittering lights were drones forming an entire galaxy.

Her throat tightened.

She'd casually mentioned wanting to see the stars. Ethan had built her a universe.

Tears spilled unchecked. Ethan stiffened. "Vivian?"

She flung herself into his arms, burying her face against his neck. "Ethan..."

"You don't like it?" Anxiety threaded his voice. Mobilizing every drone in the city had required calling in every favor.

She shook her head, clinging tighter. This constellation crafted just for her outshone any gift imaginable.
###Chapter 908

Vivian clung to Ethan's waist, burying her face against his chest.

She didn't dislike this gift. On the contrary, she adored the sentiment behind it.

He had created an entire starry sky just because of one casual remark she'd made. Few in this world would go to such lengths.

"Hold me a little longer." Her voice was muffled. She rarely showed vulnerability, but tonight she craved the warmth of his embrace.

Ethan gently stroked her back. Unlike fireworks that faded in an instant, these drones would remain suspended in the night sky, waiting whenever she looked up.

He didn't want to let go either. This moment of tranquility belonged only to them.

Above, the drones shifted into different constellations. They stayed entwined until the clock struck midnight.

"It's time to go back," Ethan murmured.

Vivian's legs nearly gave out when she stood, but his steady hands caught her. With travel unsafe at this hour, they had no choice but to stay another night.

"I'll take you home tomorrow." His gaze was tender as he watched her.

Vivian opened her mouth but hesitated.

"Don't say it." Ethan cut her off. He couldn't bear farewells—pretending they'd meet again tomorrow was easier.

"Tonight..." He left the suggestion hanging.

"No." Her refusal was firm. "Your room is next door. No midnight knocks."

Ethan retreated to the adjacent suite with a resigned sigh. After washing up, Vivian found sleep elusive.

Staring at the ceiling, she made her decision. She would leave before dawn to avoid facing goodbye.

This week had been a beautiful dream. But all dreams must end.

At first light, Vivian slipped away silently. She didn't see Ethan standing on the terrace, watching her yacht disappear into the horizon.

He wanted to chase after her but had no right to ask her to stay.

Seven days was too short—too brief to touch her heart.

Like the wind, she was gone before he could hold on.

Ethan gazed at the empty sea and laughed bitterly. She belonged to vast skies, not the harbor of his arms.
###Chapter 909

Vivian Laurent dragged her suitcase out of the harbor.

She took one last look at the city's skyline before slipping into a taxi.

"To the airport," she murmured to the driver.

As the scenery flashed by outside the window, Vivian clenched her phone. Ethan Roscente should still be asleep—the sedative would last until afternoon.

She couldn't bear to imagine his expression when he woke.

The airport bustled with travelers.

Sitting in the waiting area, Vivian absently traced her boarding pass. Two hours until departure—each minute stretched endlessly.

An unsettling feeling crept over her, as if unseen eyes watched from the shadows.

She whirled around, only to see harried passengers rushing by.

"Just my imagination," Vivian scoffed at herself.

The boarding announcement crackled overhead.

Rising, Vivian scanned the area once more before heading to the gate—assured that familiar figure was nowhere in sight.

She didn't notice Ethan Roscente lurking behind a pillar, his gaze locked on her retreating form.

An economy class ticket crumpled in his hand.

"Sir, are you certain about this flight?" The attendant eyed his tailored suit dubiously.

"Certain." Ethan tugged his cap lower.

As the plane ascended through clouds, Vivian stared blankly at the sea of white outside her window.

She didn't see Ethan in the back cabin, gazing at her photo on his phone.

Ten hours later, they landed in a small southern hemisphere nation.

Tropical air heavy with floral scents greeted them.

Vivian inhaled deeply before approaching a waiting car.

"Take me straight to the villa," she instructed.

In the rearview mirror, a black sedan maintained careful distance.

The villa perched on a mountainside.

Dinner awaited—homestyle dishes prepared exactly to Vivian's tastes.

"Would Madam care for appetizers first?" The butler inquired.

Vivian shook her head, spooning soup.

The familiar flavor brought no comfort.

Her phone chimed—a message from Isabella Langley: "Settled in?"

Before replying, a video call request flashed—Theo Evans' distraught face filled the screen.

"Auntie! Uncle's gone missing!"

Vivian's pulse spiked.

"What do you mean?"

"The butler said he never came home last night." Theo whispered, "Grandfather is furious."

Her fingers trembled slightly.

Through the window, only swaying trees broke the inky darkness.

"Perhaps...a business trip," she offered weakly.

After ending the call, Vivian stood motionless before the glass.

Distant headlights flickered along the mountain road.

In his car, Ethan adjusted binoculars—the lit window framing Vivian's silhouette.

Seeing her was enough.
###Chapter 910

The aroma of food filled the dining room, yet Vivian Laurent felt something was missing.

She set down her fork, her fingers absently tapping the table.

"Miss, would you like more?" the maid asked softly.

"No, thank you."

The maid hesitated but eventually withdrew.

The vast mansion was so quiet she could hear her own breathing. Vivian stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the distant city lights.

Three years of solitude should have made her accustomed to this. Yet tonight, the emptiness felt sharper.

She turned and went upstairs. The light in her bedroom remained on late into the night.

Not far away, Ethan Roscente stood beneath the shadows of trees, his eyes never leaving that window.

He dialed Simon Eisner's number. "Buy a property nearby. The closer, the better."

"Mr. Roscente, the company—"

"I'll return in a couple of days," Ethan interrupted.

A brief silence followed. "Understood."

A week passed. Vivian gradually adjusted to her new surroundings.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains as she sat in the garden with a book, though her mind kept wandering.

"Vivi!"

Isabella Langley's voice snapped her back to reality. She looked up to find her best friend standing before her.

"You've lost so much weight!" Isabella gasped.

Vivian instinctively touched her cheek. "Have I?"

Lucas Lefèvre set down the gift he was holding. "You definitely have."

"Maybe it's the change in climate," Vivian said lightly.

Isabella took her hand. "I specifically asked the chef to prepare dishes to your taste. How could you not have an appetite?"

"Really, I'm fine," Vivian smiled. "The baby's healthy."

Isabella's gaze dropped to her rounded abdomen. "Seven months along. You need to take better care of yourself."

"I will."

"And Ethan?" Isabella asked abruptly. "Is he just abandoning you like this?"

Vivian's fingers tightened slightly. "There was never anything between us."

She picked up her phone and opened the chat with Theo.

"Aunt Vivi!" Theo replied instantly. "You haven't come to play with me in so long."

Her fingers paused over the screen. "I've been busy lately."

"Uncle Ethan hasn't come home either," Theo sent a sad emoji. "Are you both really that busy?"

Vivian stared at the message, a sudden tightness forming in her chest.
###Chapter 911 

Vivian Laurent's phone screen lit up with a message from Theo. Her fingers paused mid-air as she frowned. "Ethan Roscente hasn't been home for days?"

Theo's reply popped up instantly. "Yeah, Uncle said he's busy with work. Aren't you together?"

Vivian stared blankly at the screen. The Roscente Group had been unusually quiet lately—what could possibly be keeping him so occupied?

"Have you checked his office?"

"I did. His secretary said he wasn't in." Theo added, "He travels a lot. I'm used to it."

Her heart suddenly lurched. If he wasn't at the office and even Theo didn't know his whereabouts... could he really have...

She immediately dialed Ethan's number, her grip tightening around the phone.

On the other end, Ethan froze when Vivian's name flashed across his screen. His finger hovered over the answer button before he forcibly pulled it away.

The ringing stopped abruptly. Ethan glared at the darkened screen and punched the steering wheel in frustration.

The dial tone made Vivian's pulse quicken. She swiftly contacted a private investigator. "Track Ethan Roscente's movements, especially after he left the island."

She bit her lower lip. That proud man wouldn't do anything foolish, would he?

The report came back quickly: Ethan had indeed departed the island the same day she left, but his subsequent trail had been deliberately erased.

Vivian redialed. This time, Ethan answered immediately. "Vivian."

Hearing his voice, the tension in her shoulders eased slightly. "Where are you?"

"Why the sudden interest?" His tone was cautious.

"Ethan Roscente!" Her voice rose sharply. "Do you think disappearing is funny? Do you know how worried people get?"

A beat of silence. Then, quietly: "You were worried about me?"

"Theo was looking for you!" she snapped defensively. "He was in tears when he couldn't find you."

Ethan sighed. "I told him I was traveling for business."

"Where?" Vivian pressed. "Why can't I find any record of your trip?"

"Just needed some time alone." He hesitated. "Vivian... can we meet?"

She gripped the phone tighter before answering flatly, "We'll see."

Hanging up, she noticed Isabella Langley watching her with knowing eyes.

"You still can't let him go," Isabella said bluntly.
###Chapter 912

"I absolutely did not!"

Isabella Langley took a delicate sip of coffee, her lips curving slightly. "Such a strong reaction. I must have hit a nerve."

Vivian Laurent's fingers stilled, her coffee cup scraping faintly against the table. "I just...don't want his troubles affecting me."

"Excuses." Isabella tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "You even saved his assistant's number. Don't pretend you don't care."

Vivian lowered her gaze to the rippling reflection in her cup.

Only after confirming Ethan Roscente's safe departure had the weight in her chest finally lifted. Perhaps time really could heal all wounds. Once he returned to his lofty position, these memories would fade like morning mist.

...

As the plane pierced through the clouds, Ethan pressed his forehead against the icy window.

He saw Vivian laughing brightly under the sun, surrounded by genuine friends. In a world without him, she thrived more vibrantly than ever.

His first act upon returning to Canada was instructing his secretary to clear all appointments.

The lights in the CEO's office often burned past midnight. Even the cleaning staff knew the handsome, aloof Mr. Roscente had become a man possessed lately. Only when holding little Theo did warmth flicker in his eyes.

"Uncle!" Theo rushed into his arms waving a crayon drawing. "I drew Aunt Vivian in her white dress!"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as he tightened his embrace. "When spring comes...I'll take you to see her."

He didn't dare say forever.

At the late-night business dinner, red wine cast dark reflections in crystal glasses. When a partner raised his glass, Ethan threw back his drink like swallowing shards of glass.

"Mr. Roscente can really hold his liquor!" The room erupted in cheers, oblivious to the blood dripping from his clenched left hand.

Simon Eisner pushed open the private dining room door just as Ethan staggered and grabbed a waitress's wrist.

"Vivian..." Those usually sharp eyes now looked heartbreakingly fragile. "Don't go..."

The terrified waitress shrank back. Simon quickly intervened, but not before capturing the scene on his phone—the video showed the once untouchable man with red-rimmed eyes, desperately tracing the red string bracelet on a stranger's wrist as if it were his last salvation.
###Chapter 913

Simon Eisner's text arrived on Vivian Laurent's phone at three in the morning.

"Ms. Laurent, you should see this video."

The footage showed Ethan Roscente slumped over a bar counter, his suit disheveled and tie loose. He kept murmuring Vivian's name with a voice roughened by alcohol.

Her fingers trembled before she quickly locked the screen.

Moonlight streamed through the window, turning her hands ice-cold. She tossed the phone to the foot of the bed, only to retrieve it five minutes later.

"Not my problem," she said to the empty room.

The next morning at Roscente Group's headquarters, Ethan walked into the boardroom impeccably dressed, as if last night's drunken episode never happened.

Two weeks later, Fiona Grandelle and Emily Garnache appeared at Vivian's villa doorstep with suitcases in tow.

"Viv!" Emily threw her arms around Vivian. "This place is even prettier than the photos!"

Sunlight filtered through palm leaves, casting golden ripples across the pool. Fiona removed her sunglasses, marveling at the three-story glass greenhouse.

"How long are you staying?" Vivian took their luggage.

"Until my dad begs me to come home!" Emily twirled with a grin. "He said one month with you beats half a year at business school."

Fiona traced her fingers along an antique vase in the foyer. "Mom insisted I learn perfumery from you. She says even royal perfumers rave about your 'Snowfall' fragrance."

As Vivian showed them the guest rooms, Emily suddenly leaned against the doorframe. "So...about Mr. Roscente—"

"The study has all your required textbooks." Vivian cut her off smoothly. "Emily, start with Corporate Finance. Fiona, the perfumery lab is ready for you to familiarize yourself with the ingredients."

At dusk, Vivian found Fiona watching the sunset on the terrace.

"Your mother's due soon?"

Fiona nodded, absently stroking her phone's lockscreen—a family photo. "The doctor thinks it might be twins."

Vivian gazed at the distant horizon where a yacht slowly approached the harbor, its deck dotted with waving figures. She abruptly turned and drew the sheer curtains shut.

"Finance lessons in the morning, perfumery in the afternoon." Her voice carried on the sea breeze. "Get some rest tonight."
###Chapter 914

Vivian Laurent had just breathed a sigh of relief, thinking Queen Eleanor would safely complete her pregnancy.

But disaster struck without warning.

At dawn, the Queen slipped on the palace staircase and tumbled down from a great height.

She was already over eight months pregnant, mere weeks from her due date.

The fall caused severe hemorrhaging, putting her in critical condition.

The Royal Medical Team rushed her to the royal hospital immediately.

The King called Vivian personally, his voice trembling as he begged her to come at once.

"I'll arrange a private jet immediately!"

Vivian's fingers shook as she hung up.

She thought fetal abnormalities were the biggest challenge, but this accident proved even more devastating.

The distance between the two countries was vast. Even the fastest jet would take hours.

By the time she arrived, it might be too late...

Why did this unborn child face so many trials?

Fiona Grandelle had just left the palace when she received the terrible news.

She boarded the private jet with Vivian, clutching her hand the entire flight.

"Vivian, Mom and the baby will be okay, right?"

Vivian couldn't promise anything.

A fall down stairs was far more dangerous than a simple trip.

Combined with the risks of the Queen's advanced maternal age, the situation looked grim.

"All we can do now is pray," Vivian said softly.

During the flight, updates from the medical team kept coming.

The Queen required an emergency C-section immediately.

"This baby has suffered so much..." Fiona wept uncontrollably. "Why does our family face so much tragedy?"

"Don't think like that," Vivian squeezed her hand. "There's no such thing as a curse."

When the jet landed, the worst news arrived.

Due to premature birth and severe trauma, the fetus showed dangerously weak vital signs.

The medical team was losing hope.

"Keep trying!" Vivian shouted into the phone. "I'll be there in thirty minutes!"

But those thirty minutes might decide life or death.
###Chapter 915

Vivian Laurent was still holding her scalpel when she received the news. She hastily removed her lab coat and rushed to the hospital with Fiona Grandelle.

The King was already pacing outside the emergency room. The Queen had been stabilized after resuscitation but suffered multiple fractures requiring long-term recovery.

The most critical case was the premature baby. The hospital had exhausted every means to sustain its vital signs, but by the time Vivian arrived, the monitor displayed a flatline.

The attending physician removed his mask and approached the King with a grave expression.

"Your Majesty, we've done all we could... The baby's heart stopped five minutes ago. With current medical capabilities..."

His voice trailed off.

The King seized the doctor's arm, his knuckles turning white. "Impossible! My son can't be gone! Try again!"

The usually composed monarch now had bloodshot eyes, looking like any other desperate parent.

He remembered how the Queen would gently caress her belly every day, how she'd prepared tiny clothes for this child. If she knew...

"The miracle doctor is coming! Just hold on a little longer!"

The doctor shook his head helplessly. "The baby's organs were underdeveloped. Surviving this long was already a miracle..."

The King staggered back as if aged a decade in seconds.

Hurried footsteps echoed down the corridor.

"What's the status?" Vivian strode forward.

"Dr. Luna!" The King clutched at her like a drowning man grasping at straws, his voice trembling. "Please save my son!"

Fiona quickly steadied her swaying father.

Without another word, Vivian headed straight for the resuscitation room. "How long since cardiac arrest?"

"Nearly five minutes," the doctor murmured. "For newborns, survival rates drop drastically after four minutes..."

The King shouted behind her, "You can revive him! You've brought back the dead before!"

Vivian paused. This blind faith weighed heavily on her. She was just a doctor, not a deity.

Inside the resuscitation room, the incubator held a terrifyingly still infant. The tiny body was tangled in tubes, the monitor emitting a relentless monotone.

Surrounding doctors stood helpless, watching this fragile life slip away.

Vivian gloved up and took a deep breath. She couldn't imagine how the Queen would cope with this tragedy upon waking.
###Chapter 916
One Percent Hope

"Get Dr. Laurent here now!"

Hurried footsteps echoed down the corridor as the crowd instinctively parted.

Vivian Laurent strode forward, the hem of her lab coat fluttering with each determined step.

Every staff member recognized the legendary physician. From saving the congenital heart disease child to reviving little Theo who'd been given no chance, to her identity as Dr. Luna being revealed—each event had sent shockwaves through the hospital.

"It's Dr. Laurent!"

"But the infant's heart has stopped for over fifteen minutes..."

Whispers spread among the medical team. Some eyes lit with hope while others shook their heads discreetly.

The King and Queen stood nearby, faces ashen. Though untrained in medicine, the despair on the doctors' faces needed no translation.

Vivian approached the incubator where a heartbreakingly tiny newborn lay.

Queen Eleanor had endured brutal morning sickness, forcing down food only to vomit it back up. What should have nourished the fetus became the Queen's torment instead.

Premature infants were fragile under the best circumstances—this one born to an older mother faced even steeper odds.

The baby's skin held an unnatural purplish hue. No chest movement was visible. Its miniature body, smaller than Vivian's palm, depended entirely on the ventilator's mechanical breaths.

Vivian placed her hand gently over the infant's chest.

Her touch was featherlight—each gram of pressure precisely measured. Too much would fracture those delicate ribs; too little wouldn't restart the heart.

The room fell deathly silent.

Every observer held their breath, eyes locked on Vivian's every movement.

From her bag, she withdrew an antique needle case.

"What's that?" someone murmured.

"Quiet!" came the immediate hushed rebuke.

The silver filaments gleamed coldly under the lights. With a flick of her wrist, Vivian inserted the first hair-thin needle into the baby's tender skin.

A collective gasp rippled through the onlookers.

No one had witnessed such treatment methods before. Yet in this moment, no one dared question. Vivian represented their last hope.

Her left hand maintained rhythmic cardiac compressions while her right manipulated the needles with unshakable steadiness. Beads of sweat formed on her forehead, one hanging precariously at her chin.

Time stretched endlessly.

Each second passed like a century.

One percent chance.

That was Vivian's internal calculation. A sliver of possibility bearing the full weight of a royal family's desperate hopes.

She wouldn't surrender.

While a single spark of life remained, she would fight until the final moment.
###Chapter 917

Silver needles covered the infant's delicate skin like a tiny curled-up hedgehog.

The medical team held their breath, eyes locked on the quivering needles.

Seconds ticked by with no change on the flatlined monitor.

Some staff members began discreetly wiping tears.

Suddenly, a sharp beep shattered the silence.

"Cardiac rhythm restored!"

"My God, this is unbelievable!"

"Fifteen minutes without a pulse and still revived—this is a medical miracle!"

"Dr. Luna truly lives up to her reputation. This is resurrection in every sense!"

Cheers erupted in the operating room.

Vivian Laurent's forehead glistened with sweat, yet her hands never faltered.

"Don't celebrate yet," she murmured, voice low. "The critical phase begins now."

Her slender fingers adjusted needle placements with precision.

Each insertion sent ripples of tension through the observers.

......

Fiona Grandelle gently took the king's arm.

"Father, let's visit Mother."

The weary monarch nodded.

In the royal suite, Queen Eleanor tore at her bedsheets with frantic hands.

"Where's my baby? Give him back!"

Tear tracks streaked her pallid face as nails dug into her palms.

"Where have you hidden him?"

Her violent movements reopened surgical wounds, staining the hospital gown crimson.

"Your Majesty, you mustn't—"

"Out of my way!" The queen shoved nurses aside, hysterical. "I need to see my child!"

Bare feet hit cold marble before agony dropped her to her knees.

"Why won't anyone tell me the truth?"

Her white-knuckled grip twisted the bedframe.

"Has he... has my son..."

The final word lodged in her throat, too terrible to voice.
###Chapter 918

Queen Eleanor yanked the IV needle from her arm. Blood instantly welled up from the puncture site.

She struggled to rise, but collapsed onto the floor from the excruciating pain in her abdomen.

"Your Majesty!" Two maidservants rushed forward in panic.

The Queen curled on the carpet, clutching her stomach as tears soaked the fabric.

King Edward and Fiona had just reached the hospital room door when a dull thud sounded from inside.

Fiona's face drained of color. She shoved the door open and charged in.

"Mother!"

The Queen lay pale as death on the floor, a growing pool of blood beneath her.

The King and Fiona carefully lifted the Queen back onto the bed.

"My baby...where's my baby?" The Queen gripped her husband's sleeve with desperate strength.

The King's Adam's apple bobbed. "Dr. Laurent is performing emergency procedures..."

He couldn't bring himself to voice the grim possibility.

The Queen began trembling violently. "No! My child will be fine!"

"Darling, if...if we can't save this baby—"

"Silence!" The Queen cut him off hysterically. "Dr. Laurent saved Fiona! She'll save my baby too!"

Fiona clasped her mother's hand, eyes red-rimmed. "Mom, please calm down first..."

"Calm down? How?" Tears streamed down the Queen's face. "He's only seven months along!"

She suddenly seized Fiona's shoulders. "Dr. Laurent performed fetal surgery before. Can't she put my baby back inside me?"

The King closed his eyes in anguish.

"Mother, your current physical condition..." Fiona's voice broke.

The Queen went eerily still, her gaze hollow. "Where's Dr. Laurent? I need to see Dr. Laurent..."

She whispered feverishly, "She'll save my baby...she has to..."

The room filled with nothing but stifled sobs.

Everyone pinned their last hope on that young miracle-working physician.
###Chapter 919

"My love, the stairs felt unusually slippery when I fell," Queen Eleanor whispered from her sickbed, her face pale as parchment.

King Edward's brows furrowed. "Are you suggesting foul play?"

"I'm not certain," she replied weakly, shaking her head. "But the slickness wasn't natural."

He rose immediately. "I'll order a full investigation."

If anyone dared harm his wife and unborn child, they would pay dearly.

Eleanor's trembling fingers brushed her flat abdomen, tears glistening. This child had carried all her hopes and love.

From the first day of pregnancy, she'd faced overwhelming pressure. The physicians had warned against keeping the baby, citing grave risks.

Yet she'd insisted. She'd endured morning sickness, battled complications—only to have it all crumble at the final moment.

"I want to see our child," Eleanor struggled to rise. "Perhaps he'll feel our love..."

"Mother!" Fiona rushed to restrain her. "You must rest. I'll watch over my brother and alert you immediately."

The king squeezed his daughter's shoulder. "Thank you."

Fiona shook her head. "Compared to what you and sister endured, this is nothing."

Once alone, Edward gathered his weeping wife into his arms. Silent tears soaked his shoulder.

"Why did our child leave us?" she choked out. "Was I inadequate?"

He stroked her hair. "He knew your love. He'll return to us."

"Even if..." Edward hesitated, "even if we can't keep him, we still have Fiona. She's a blessing."

At Fiona's mention, Eleanor wept harder. "After all she's suffered, now this..."

"Don't dwell on it," the king murmured, kissing her forehead. "Fiona's recovered, and our son will be fine."

She forced a nod, but dread surged like a rising tide within her.
###Chapter 920

At the Roscente Group headquarters in Canada, Ethan Roscente was reviewing documents when his office door burst open.

"Mr. Roscente, urgent news from Eudora," Simon Eisner entered swiftly, his expression grave.

Ethan didn't look up. "What is it?"

"The Queen...she's had an accident," Simon lowered his voice. "She fell down the stairs and went into premature labor. The baby's condition is critical."

A streak of ink bled across the document from Ethan's pen.

His head snapped up. "Where's Vivian?"

"Dr. Laurent is already en route," Simon hesitated. "But Her Majesty's condition is dire. The infant might not—"

Ethan stood abruptly.

His face darkened like a gathering storm.

How dare they treat Vivian like some on-call servant? Pregnant and still being dragged across countries. If anything happened to her...

Worse yet, if the child couldn't be saved, would the Queen blame Vivian?

"Prepare the jet," Ethan grabbed his suit jacket.

Simon hurried after him. "But tomorrow's board meeting—"

"Cancel everything." Ethan didn't break stride. "We leave for Eudora now."

He needed to be there to shield Vivian himself.

...

In the Royal Eudoran Hospital operating theater, beads of sweat dotted Vivian Laurent's forehead as her nimble fingers manipulated silver needles.

The heart monitor showed a flatline with only the faintest flicker.

"Blood pressure still dropping!" a nurse cried.

"Prepare epinephrine," Vivian said calmly. "Give me three more minutes."

Her entire focus centered on each precise needle placement along critical meridians.

Seconds ticked by.

Suddenly—a single strong beep.

"Heartbeat restored!" the surgeon exclaimed.

The operating room filled with an infant's vigorous cries.

Vivian exhaled shakily, her knees nearly buckling.

"That was miraculous!" The lead physician's eyes shone. "Dr. Laurent, you must teach us this technique."

"It's not magic," Vivian wiped her brow. "Just a very determined little fighter."

Her hand instinctively cradled her own belly as she gazed at the newborn in the incubator.

This child would live.
###Chapter 921

Vivian pushed open the emergency room door. Fiona was pacing anxiously inside.

"Vivian!" Fiona's eyes lit up as she hurried forward.

Vivian removed her surgical mask, beads of sweat still glistening on her forehead.

"He's stabilized for now." Her voice was low. "But his condition remains critical."

Fiona exhaled sharply, relief washing over her face. "I knew you could save him!"

"Don't celebrate yet." Vivian frowned. "This isn't over."

She glanced around before lowering her voice. "How's your mother?"

"Still waiting in her room." Fiona bit her lip. "She said...it wasn't an accident."

Vivian's pupils contracted.

"What do you mean?"

"Mother claims she stepped on something..." Fiona's voice trailed off.

Vivian suddenly grabbed Fiona's wrist with bruising force.

"Oh no."

The rumors about the Queen's abnormal fetus during her last prenatal checkup flashed through Vivian's mind. She'd suspected foul play then.

And now this...

"The baby must die." Vivian said abruptly.

Fiona gasped. "Vivian, what are you saying?"

Vivian dragged her back into the ER. The medical staff looked up in surprise.

"From this moment," Vivian's voice turned icy, "announce the resuscitation failed."

The doctors exchanged confused glances.

"That's an order." Vivian scanned the room. "One word leaks out..."

Her gaze locked onto Fiona.

Though bewildered, the princess nodded firmly. "Do as she says."

Inside the incubator, the tiny pink newborn slept peacefully.

Fiona couldn't resist asking. "But why..."

"If we want to save this child," Vivian stared at the infant, "he must first be 'dead.'"
###Chapter 922

"We will keep this secret," the lead physician vowed solemnly.

"By our Hippocratic oath," the other doctors echoed in unison.

Vivian Laurent finally allowed her tense nerves to relax slightly.

She pulled Fiona Grandelle into a corner and whispered urgently, "Fiona, the Queen's fall was no accident."

"If someone deliberately harmed her, saving the baby this time won't stop them from trying again."

"We should let them believe their plan succeeded. Announce the baby's death publicly to lower their guard."

Fiona's pupils contracted sharply, her fingers clutching her dress involuntarily.

"You're right!" Her voice trembled. "Only this way can my brother be safe."

Vivian's gaze burned with determination. "The Queen is being watched. We must stage a convincing performance to make everyone believe the child is gone."

"Remember, even Her Majesty must believe it. The more genuine her grief, the more our enemies will be deceived."

Fiona nodded firmly, tears glistening in her eyes.

As she studied Vivian's resolute profile, overwhelming admiration swelled in her heart.

When they returned to the ward, Queen Eleanor was struggling to rise from her bed.

"My baby?" The Queen's voice was hoarse. "Let me see him!"

Vivian lowered her lashes. After a weighted pause, she spoke softly. "Your Majesty... I'm so sorry."

Fiona turned away, shoulders shaking slightly.

"No!" The Queen's scream tore through the room. "He was kicking just moments ago!"

She grabbed Vivian's lab coat desperately. "You're lying to me, aren't you?"

Vivian swallowed hard. "I wish I were..."

The Queen went rigid, collapsing backward.

"Eleanor!" The King caught his wife, his own eyes red-rimmed.

Vivian moved swiftly to examine her. "It's just a stress-induced faint."

The King's trembling hand brushed his wife's pale cheek. "Perhaps... this was fate's design."

His voice broke. "From the beginning, this pregnancy was fraught with difficulties. Maybe this child was never meant to..."

The monarch couldn't continue, his body wracked with silent sobs.

Fiona bit her lip until it bled, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

How she longed to reveal the truth to her parents—yet she forced herself to remain silent.

Vivian met her gaze with unshakable resolve.

This performance had to continue—until the final curtain fell.
###Chapter 923

"Father..." Fiona Grandelle's voice trailed off.

She studied the King's haggard face, wanting to comfort him but unsure where to begin.

"I'll always be your daughter," she finally murmured.

The King forced a smile and stroked her hair.

"Having you here is enough for me."

The antiseptic scent of the hospital room hung thick in the air. A maid stood silently in the corner. Vivian Laurent's gaze lingered on her briefly but detected nothing unusual.

"Stay with them, Fiona," Vivian said softly.

Fiona nodded. "Don't push yourself too hard, Vivian."

Stepping into the hallway, Vivian was met with a gust of cold air.

...

News spread like wildfire.

The tragic death of the King's youngest son brought secret joy to certain individuals.

Their previous ally Annika had been replaced by Liam Valdemar.

"The heavens smile upon us!" A man rubbed his hands together eagerly. "That child's death came at the perfect moment."

Liam remained half-shrouded in shadows, only his pale profile visible.

"The narrative is prepared," he stated coolly.

The man's eyes glittered with greed. "Just need to fan the flames, make the people believe they're cursed—"

"Patience." Liam's voice carried a serpent's chill. "Vivian Laurent isn't to be underestimated."

The man waved dismissively. "What threat could one doctor pose?"

"She's raised the dead." Liam's tone turned glacial.

That gave the man pause, though his ambition remained undimmed.

"Let public opinion simmer first," he ground out. "I'll make sure he steps down in agony."

A cold smile curled Liam's lips.

"Pleasure doing business," he murmured.

The man missed the flicker of contempt in Liam's eyes.

The game had only just begun.
###Chapter 924

Ethan Roscente's private jet touched down at Eudora International Airport as dawn barely broke.

Without even changing his coat, he drove straight to the downtown hospital.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a familiar figure curled up on a bench at the end of the corridor.

Vivian Laurent rested her chin on one hand, eyelids half-closed, her frame noticeably thinner.

Ethan's breath caught.

He'd imagined her thriving abroad. But this exhausted woman bore no resemblance to that mental image.

Adjusting his black baseball cap and surgical mask, he confirmed his disguise before approaching.

Vivian's head suddenly lolled sideways.

Instinctively, he cupped her cheek.

Her lashes fluttered open. The warmth of her skin against his palm made Ethan jerk back as if burned.

"Ethan?"

His Adam's apple bobbed beneath the mask. "You've mistaken me for someone else."

Vivian chuckled softly.

Did this man truly believe this flimsy disguise would work? She'd recognize him even wrapped like a mummy.

"Fine, my mistake," she teased.

Ethan froze. This wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated.

After a pause, he sat beside her.

"Rest your head here if you're tired." The muffled voice couldn't hide his concern.

Vivian turned away. Twelve straight hours of surgery had drained her, and now her eyes burned unexpectedly.

"Why are you here?"

"Finished company business." His evasion was obvious.

She arched an eyebrow. "Theo says you've been working past midnight every day."

"You've been talking to Theo?" His voice brightened noticeably.

"He insisted on video calls," Vivian clarified.

Suddenly, a large hand cradled the back of her head, guiding it firmly to his shoulder.

"Ethan!"

"Stay still." His arm tightened. "Your patients matter, but what about you?"

She struggled briefly before surrendering.

The familiar scent of pine enveloped her. She inhaled discreetly.

"Ethan," she whispered, "do you believe I can save them all?"

Fractured light from the hallway lamps danced across his glasses as silence stretched between them.
###Chapter 925

"Don't play the savior." Ethan Roscente's voice was low and firm. "Doctors are mortals, not gods."

Vivian Laurent's fingers curled slightly as she stared blankly toward the hospital room.

"What if..." she suddenly spoke, "the Queen's child doesn't survive?"

Ethan's arm instantly tightened around her, pulling her fully into his embrace.

"So what?" His tone carried unshakable conviction. "You've given everything you have."

His chin rested against her hair, his breaths filled with the faint antiseptic scent clinging to her.

"If anyone dares trouble you," Ethan's knuckles brushed her cheek lightly, "even the King himself won't escape my wrath."

Vivian chuckled softly. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Going mad for you is worth it." His voice turned gravelly. "Vivian, try trusting me just once."

She fell silent as exhaustion suddenly overwhelmed her.

Unconsciously, Vivian leaned against his shoulder and drifted asleep. Ethan's arms became a custom-made harbor, allowing her rare moment of relaxation.

Ethan froze, afraid the slightest movement might disturb her peaceful slumber.

When Fiona Grandelle pushed the door open, this was the scene that greeted her.

"Vivian—" Her voice was instantly silenced by the man's razor-sharp glare.

"Let her sleep." Ethan's whisper was barely audible.

Fiona studied the heavily disguised stranger warily. "Who are you?"

Ethan's lips curled coldly. "Tell your parents to keep their schemes away from Vivian." Danger laced his words. "Or I won't hesitate to replace Eudora's monarch."

Fiona's eyes widened in sudden recognition of the voice's owner.
###Chapter 926
The Art of Shamelessness

Fiona Grandelle's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "Our entire family remembers Vivian's kindness. If anyone dares speak ill of her, I'll be the first to object."

Ethan Roscente's cold gaze sliced through her like a blade behind his sunglasses.

"Remember your words," he rumbled in that deep baritone.

Fiona twisted the fabric of her dress. She knew Ethan's hostility wasn't directed at her, but at anyone who threatened Vivian.

That protective instinct made her heart ache with envy.

Ryan Fairsprene's indifferent reply flashed through her mind, leaving a stone of bitterness in her chest.

......

Vivian Laurent blinked awake, disoriented to find her head pillowed on Ethan's shoulder.

She snatched his sunglasses off. "Who wears these in a hospital?"

"Sleep more?" Ethan remained immovable as granite.

"No. You can leave now."

His jaw twitched. This woman changed moods faster than flipping pages.

"I'm taking you to dinner." Without waiting for consent, he swept her into a bridal carry.

Vivian kicked. "Put me down! I'll dislocate your arm!"

"You'll eat even if I have to drag you." Ethan strode toward the exit. "You're skin and bones—"

He bit back the words.

Too close. If she realized he'd discovered her pregnancy, this wildcat would bolt faster than lightning.

"None of your business!" Vivian pummeled his shoulders.

Ethan tightened his hold, weathering her blows without flinching.

Shamelessness was the golden rule for winning your woman—a truth he'd recently embraced.
###Chapter 927

Vivian's heartbeat accelerated abruptly.

Ethan's words sent an inexplicable panic through her.

Had he noticed something?

Ethan suddenly changed his tone. "Of course I'm concerned about you. I'd hate to see you faint from hunger."

"I'm not a child," Vivian frowned.

"I'm just worried about you," Ethan said, his voice low. "How will you take care of yourself without me?"

"I've managed just fine all these years," Vivian retorted sharply.

Ethan shook his head helplessly. "That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean?"

"Fine. Maybe that is what I meant," he conceded.

Vivian's temper flared. "So you do look down on me!"

Ethan fell silent.

Their exchange felt like a twisted tongue twister.

"I just don't want you blaming yourself," he sighed. "What happened with the baby wasn't your fault."

"Perhaps it was fate. Forcing him into this world might not have been kind."

His attempt at comfort only angered her further.

"You don't understand at all!" Her voice trembled. "How much Queen Eleanor and everyone longed for this child!"

"Who says I don't understand?" Ethan countered. "Theo is my child too. I was looking forward to ours."

Vivian froze.

She remembered Ethan once claiming to dislike children.

"Since when did you start wanting kids?"

"Always," Ethan's gaze burned into her. "But only with you. I want our baby."

A sudden flutter stirred in Vivian's abdomen—as if the little one inside had responded.

Her ears burned crimson. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Her fingers instinctively brushed her stomach.

This secret she'd guarded so fiercely...

Now wavered.
###Chapter 928

"I only want children with Vivian. I'll never accept anyone else's."

"Vivian, you can always trust me. Let's get something to eat first, okay?"

Ethan Roscente softened his voice, making Vivian Laurent's heart churn with mixed emotions.

"I'm tired."

The brief rest earlier hadn't been enough. She could sleep for days right now.

"You can rest after eating. I'll stay with you."

"Who asked you to stay?" Vivian muttered under her breath.

Yet strangely, she always slept more soundly around Ethan.

It wasn't just his comforting presence—it was the unshakable sense of safety he gave her. She knew he'd protect her.

"I'm the one who can't stay away. I want to keep you in my sight every moment."

The tender words made Vivian's ears burn.

"Shut up! That's so cringey!"

Ethan chuckled lowly and carried her into the dining room.

The table was laden with all her favorite dishes.

Ravenous, Vivian dug in without restraint.

Ethan handed her a glass of water. "Slow down. Drink something first. Did the royal family not feed you after you saved them?"

"Not their fault. I just had no appetite."

Her mouth full of food, the excuse sounded weak even to her own ears.

Ethan looked pleased. "So your appetite improved after seeing me?"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Don't flatter yourself! I was just hungry!"

As if seeing him would make her hungry—more like lose her appetite.

Her unstoppable eating was really because the baby was hungry.

After a few bites, her phone rang.

Fiona Grandelle.

"Fiona?"

"Vivian! Come quick! It's my mother!" Fiona's voice was frantic.

"What happened to the Queen? I'm on my way!"

Vivian dropped her chopsticks and bolted for the door.

Ethan called after her, "At least finish your meal!"

"I'm full! Ethan, pay the bill!"

At least the man was good for something.

By the time Ethan settled the check and reached the hospital, Vivian had already rushed into the ward.

Queen Eleanor was agitated, her surgical wound bleeding again.

Fiona looked near tears. "I'm sorry, Vivian. Mom woke up demanding to see my brother, and her stitches tore... I didn't know what to do..."

She wanted to tell her mother the truth about her brother's survival but feared disrupting Vivian's plans.

"Dr. Luna! I must see my son!" The Queen ignored her pain, growing more distressed at Vivian's arrival.
###Chapter 929

Vivian Laurent acted swiftly, delivering a precise chop to Queen Eleanor's nape.

"Mother!" Fiona Grandelle gasped.

"She's only temporarily unconscious." Vivian examined the queen's reopened wound. "This needs restitching."

Fiona bit her lip. "Viv, maybe I should—"

She wanted to reveal her brother's survival.

Vivian saw through her hesitation.

"This is your family matter." Vivian prepared the suturing kit. "I'll only offer advice. The consequences are yours to bear."

She left the warning unspoken.

If their hidden enemies learned the truth, both mother and child would be endangered.

Tears welled in Fiona's eyes. "I'm sorry..."

She shouldn't have doubted Vivian's intentions.

Ultimately, Fiona chose secrecy.

After completing the stitches, Vivian sought the king.

"Her Majesty suspects the staircase incident wasn't accidental. Any progress in the investigation?"

The weary monarch shook his head. "Too much time has passed. Evidence was erased."

"Spend more time with the queen." Vivian hinted carefully. "Opportunities may arise."

The king misunderstood. "At her age, we accept reality. Fiona is enough for us."

Vivian redirected. "Monitor online public sentiment."

The king considered this thoughtfully.

Royal duties weighed heavily as he forced himself to remain composed.

Meanwhile, the queen wept endlessly.

And the premature infant lay quietly in the incubator.

Vivian prepared to return home.

Only her departure would convince their enemies of the child's supposed demise.

She remotely monitored the baby's vitals daily.

The condition was improving.

Ethan Roscente already knew her itinerary.

He stood by the window, watching her plane vanish into the horizon.

Liam Valdemar followed covertly.

Under the pretense of assistance, he tracked Vivian's movements.

The Eudoran trip was merely a facade.

His true quarry remained Vivian herself.
###Chapter 930

Vivian Laurent's plane touched down at M International Airport.

She immediately called Fiona Grandelle after exiting the terminal.

"Remember our agreement." Vivian kept her voice low. "Not a single word until the time is right."

Fiona repeatedly promised to keep her lips sealed.

Vivian glanced around. The air in M country carried an unfamiliar scent. Despite having lived here for some time, she never felt as comfortable as she did in Canada.

She went straight upstairs to rest upon returning to the villa. The maid who attended her left to buy ingredients for dinner.

The maid had just reached the supermarket entrance when a shadowy figure cornered her in an alley.

An icy gun barrel pressed against her temple.

"Don't make a sound." Liam Valdemar's voice sounded like it came from hell.

The maid's legs gave out, nearly collapsing to her knees.

"Take...take my wallet..." She trembled as she pulled out all her cash.

Liam let out a cold laugh. "I don't want money."

"Then...what do you want?" Her voice quivered with fear.

"I ask. You answer. Lie to me, and..." The click of the gun's safety being released echoed sharply in the silent alley.

The maid nodded frantically.

"Is Vivian Laurent staying at the villa?"

"Y-yes..."

"Why did she suddenly come to M country?"

"I don't know...I just cook meals..." Tears streamed down her face.

Liam narrowed his eyes, pressing the gun harder.

"Last chance."

The maid broke down sobbing. "Miss Laurent is pregnant...here for prenatal care...that's all I know..."

Liam's hand jerked violently.

"Pregnant?"

His voice rose sharply, eyes flashing with chilling fury.

"How many months?"

"S-six or seven..." The maid cowered.

Liam's knuckles turned white. Six or seven months meant only one thing.

Ethan Roscente's child.

The thought gnawed at his sanity like a venomous snake. He'd given so much, yet never even touched Vivian. And that man had gotten her pregnant.

Rage and jealousy churned in his chest. Liam slammed his fist into the wall, blood oozing from his split knuckles.

"Get out."

The maid scrambled away in terror.

Liam stood motionless, his expression dark and dangerous. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Prepare the jet. I'm returning to Canada."

After hanging up, he stared toward the villa, a cruel smirk twisting his lips.

"Ethan Roscente...you're a dead man."
###Chapter 931

Liam stood by the window, his knuckles turning white.

Sunlight streamed outside but couldn't pierce the gloom in his eyes.

The news of Vivian's pregnancy stabbed through his heart like a dagger.

She had kept it from him.

This realization made his chest heave violently.

After all the times he'd saved her, she couldn't even grant him basic trust.

Very well. He wouldn't hold back anymore.

Liam whirled around and seized the maid's throat.

The maid's eyes bulged in terror as she clawed at his arm.

"W-what are you—" Her voice came out strangled.

With a cold smile, Liam produced a pill from his pocket.

He forced her mouth open and shoved it down her throat.

"Cough! Cough!" The maid turned pale. "What did you give me?"

"Poison." Liam released her, looking down with contempt. "Monthly antidote required. Or you'll wish for death."

The maid collapsed, trembling.

Liam tossed her a packet of powder. "Put this in Vivian's food. Meet me here in three days."

"N-no..." She shook her head. "Dr. Laurent will notice—"

"Tasteless. Odorless." Liam bent closer, his voice icy. "Obey or die."

Tears spilled down her cheeks.

She remembered Vivian's kind smiles, how the doctor never mistreated staff.

"I—"

"Don't even think of asking her for help." Liam cut her off. "Only I have the antidote. If she finds out, you die first."

He strode away, leaving the maid sobbing on the floor.

She stared at the poison, tears dripping onto the packet.

She didn't want to hurt anyone.

But she didn't want to die either.

Outside, the sun still shone brightly.

Yet no light could reach the darkness in her heart now.
###Chapter 932

The afternoon sun cast a golden glow as Vivian Laurent reclined on the wicker chair in the garden, enjoying a light nap.

Mia Lombardi hurried back from the market, her empty basket swinging at her side. Her steps were unsteady, her fingers gripping the basket's edge too tightly.

"Mia."

Hearing Vivian's voice, Mia froze. Her knuckles turned white around the basket handle.

"Ms. Laurent." She kept her head down, her voice barely above a whisper.

Vivian noticed the empty basket. "No fresh produce today?"

"The market... The vegetables weren't fresh." Mia's fingers trembled slightly.

Vivian sat up, studying her. "You look pale."

"I'm fine!" Mia's voice cracked before she caught herself. "Really, I'm okay..."

Vivian watched her thoughtfully. "Life throws challenges at us. If money can solve it, it's not a real problem. Tell me if you need help."

Mia nodded hastily and rushed into the mansion.

Without hesitation, Vivian picked up her phone and transferred a million dollars.

In the kitchen, Mia's phone buzzed.

She stared at the bank notification, counting the zeros in disbelief.

A million dollars.

Ms. Laurent hadn't even asked why before sending this fortune.

Tears blurred Mia's vision. She stepped to the window, watching Vivian resting peacefully in the garden.

"Ms. Laurent..." she whispered.

Vivian opened her eyes. "Hmm?"

"This is too much. I can't accept it..."

Vivian smiled. "Keep it for now. Don't let money become your regret."

But her problem couldn't be solved with money.

Mia bit her lip. That man had ordered her to poison Ms. Laurent—how could she ever do it?

During dinner, Mia nearly dropped the soup bowl, her hands unsteady.

"Take a few days off if you're unwell." Vivian took the ladle from her.

Mia's eyes burned. "I'm fine... Just distracted..."

"My door is always open." Vivian's quiet words made Mia's nose sting.

That night, Mia tossed and turned in bed.

How could she betray someone who treated her with such kindness?

She decided never to meet that threatening man again.

Three days later, excruciating pain wracked Mia's body. Cold sweat drenched her nightgown.
###Chapter 933

Agony crashed over her like tidal waves.

Mia Lombardi curled up in the corner, nails digging deep into her palms. Every inch of her skin screamed as if countless ants were devouring her flesh.

Cold sweat drenched her back.

Vivian Laurent had been too preoccupied shopping with Emily Garnache these past two days to notice her distress.

Was this what poison onset felt like?

Mia bit through her lower lip. She'd thought staying indoors would help her endure it, but the pain surpassed all imagination.

She'd once sworn never to harm Vivian.

Now, survival was all that mattered.

Self-preservation ruled them all.

Trembling, she staggered to her feet and lurched toward the meeting point.

The night hung thick as ink.

Mia waited until her legs gave out. Just as darkness threatened to claim her, Liam Valdemar's silhouette emerged in the moonlight.

"Changed your mind?" His voice dripped with mockery.

Mia lunged forward. "The antidote! Give it to me now!"

Liam dangled a porcelain vial. "Right here."

She grabbed for it, but he easily evaded.

"Not a single drop of the poison I gave you was used." His laugh turned icy. "Defying me?"

"You've been watching me?" Her pupils constricted.

Liam shrugged. "What if I have?"

"Vivian's been kind to me..." Mia's voice shook. "Why hurt her?"

"Kind?" Fury contorted his features. "She never considered kindness when she betrayed me!"

"She deserves death for carrying another man's child!"

Madness churned in his eyes. After all the times he'd saved Vivian, she'd chosen Ethan Roscente.

How dare she?

Mia recoiled from his gaze. This wasn't love—it was twisted obsession.

"Maybe...there's been some misunderstanding?" she ventured.

"Silence!" Liam seized her throat. "Poison her or die."

The vial glinted coldly under the moon.

Mia's vision blurred. She knew no other choice remained.
###Chapter 934

"I'll do it! I'll do it right now!" Mia Lombardi curled up on the floor, her back drenched in cold sweat. Her trembling hand reached out. "Please... give me the antidote..."

Zero let out a chilling laugh and tossed a black pill in front of her.

Mia scrambled forward, grabbing the pill and shoving it into her mouth. The effect was immediate—the agonizing cramps in her abdomen gradually subsided.

"Remember, I'm always watching you." Zero's voice slithered into her ear like a venomous snake. "Try anything funny, and next time won't be so easy."

Mia collapsed onto the floor. When she finally regained her senses, the room was empty.

The setting sun cast long shadows as she returned to the villa. Moving mechanically into the kitchen, her fingers trembled uncontrollably. From a hidden pocket in her apron, she retrieved a packet of white powder and sprinkled it into the freshly made soup.

"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry..." She whispered to the empty air, tears dripping onto the stovetop.

Soon, the dining table was laden with exquisite dishes. Mia had specially prepared Vivian Laurent's favorites—sweet and sour ribs and steamed sea bass.

The doorbell rang.

"Vivian's home!" Emily Garnache's cheerful voice echoed from the foyer.

Mia's heart clenched painfully.

"Everyone, gather round." Vivian called out, her arms full of shopping bags.

Mia stood at the back, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"These are gifts for all of you." Vivian smiled as she distributed beautifully wrapped boxes. "Mia, this one's for you."

It was a smooth white jade Bodhisattva pendant, glowing softly under the light.

"I heard you've been having trouble sleeping. This should help calm your nerves."

Mia's hands shook so violently she could barely hold the gift.

"And these hand creams and aprons," Emily added. "Vivian picked them out specially, saying you work too hard in the kitchen."

Tears welled up in Mia's eyes. She stared fixedly at the floor, not daring to look up.

"Dinner's ready. The food will get cold." Her voice came out hoarse, as if she'd been wandering the desert for days.

Vivian's gaze suddenly settled on her.

Mia stopped breathing.

"You..." Vivian began slowly.
###Chapter 935 

"Thank you."

"You must have worked hard preparing all these dishes, Mia."

Mia's fingers trembled slightly. Had Vivian discovered something?

Her guilt intensified. She had poisoned Vivian's food, yet Vivian was thanking her.

What a despicable ingrate she was.

Mia kept her head lowered, voice barely audible. "Don't mention it, Miss Vivian. It's my duty."

"But Emily and I already ate out. You all should enjoy these dishes. No need to waste them."

"Yes, we've eaten," Emily chimed in.

Mia couldn't decide whether to feel relieved or disappointed.

"Oh...alright."

The plan had failed. But it wasn't her fault—Vivian chose not to eat.

Vivian went upstairs to rest. The day's outing had exhausted her.

As others prepared to eat, Mia suddenly stopped them. "Wait."

"What is it?"

"The food's gone cold. Let me reheat it."

While reheating, Mia secretly disposed of the poisoned dish.

Upstairs, Vivian inquired about Fiona's situation.

The King had identified the mastermind—a high-ranking official from Eudora. This man had long coveted the throne and constantly opposed the King.

Though lacking concrete evidence, the King could no longer tolerate threats to his family. He confronted the official directly.

The scandal erupted. Everyone now knew the royal child had been murdered.

Public opinion shifted dramatically. Those who once considered the child ill-omened now sympathized with the King.

The official dared not act openly but privately cursed the King relentlessly.

The Queen returned home from the hospital to recuperate. Seizing the moment, Vivian prompted Fiona to reveal the truth.

"Father, Mother...I have something to tell you." Fiona had held this in too long.

"What is it?" The Queen asked listlessly.

"Good news. The baby...he's actually alive."

"What?" Both monarchs gasped simultaneously.

"Vivian saved him. But she discovered Mother's fall wasn't accidental—someone wanted to kill the heir. That's why we announced his death."

"He's been recovering at the hospital and is doing well now. The doctors will bring him home soon."
###Chapter 936 

"Fiona, is this really true?" Queen Eleanor's voice trembled as her fingers clutched the hem of her dress.

She had endured too many shattered hopes before. Now she barely dared to breathe.

Fiona Grandelle held her mother's ice-cold hands. "Mom, little brother is safe. Vivian risked everything to save him. Even the doctors called it a miracle."

Tears spilled from the Queen's eyes, streaming down her cheeks.

"Vivian came immediately despite being pregnant herself," Fiona said, her voice breaking. "She insisted on trying one more time. If not for her, brother would have..."

The King stood nearby, his Adam's apple bobbing, eyes rimmed red.

The hospital door opened softly. A nurse entered carrying a small bundle.

"My baby..." The Queen stumbled forward but froze mid-step.

The infant in the blanket was so tiny, his skin a delicate pink as he slept peacefully.

"He...he's really alive?" The Queen hesitated to reach out, fearing this might be an illusion.

The King stepped forward and gently touched the baby's cheek.

The warmth against his fingers made him shudder.

"Our son," the King rasped. "He's really come back to us."

The Queen finally broke down, covering her face with trembling hands as violent sobs wracked her body.

"Mom, brother still needs special care," Fiona said softly. "Vivian said he can't leave until his vitals stabilize."

The Queen nodded frantically, unable to tear her gaze from the child.

"We won't blame Vivian," the King said firmly. "She saved our child. This debt can never be repaid."

Fiona exhaled in relief. "Vivian only kept it secret because she feared someone might harm brother."

The Queen wiped her tears and shakily dialed a number.

"Vivian..." Her voice cracked immediately. "Thank you. My child...my baby is alive..."

On the other end, Vivian Laurent smiled unconsciously at the Queen's weeping.

"It was my duty," Vivian said gently. "Seeing the prince healthy is reward enough."

The Queen clutched the phone tightly. "No, you're our family's savior. Anything you want, we'll—"

"Your Majesty," Vivian interrupted softly. "The prince's life is all the thanks I need."

Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the baby's rosy cheeks.

Finally gathering courage, the Queen reached to hold her son's tiny hand.

The warmth against her palm confirmed this was no dream.
###Chapter 937

"Don't mention it. Emily and I are close friends. This is what I should do." Vivian Laurent smiled gently.

Emily Garnache grasped her hand. "How could I blame you? You only had mine and the baby's best interests at heart. Dr. Laurent, I'm truly grateful."

Vivian shook her head.

Saving two lives filled her with profound joy.

These past two days, Vivian had barely touched her meals, pushing food around her plate before giving up. Mia Lombardi watched with growing concern.

The man's threat hung over her like a guillotine.

She had to complete her mission quickly.

During breakfast, Mia mixed colorless, slow-acting poison into the congee. Only after seeing Vivian take several spoonfuls did her tense nerves relax slightly.

"Mia, is something wrong?" Vivian noticed her strange behavior.

"N-nothing." Mia waved her hands hastily. "I'm just happy to see you eating more today."

"Your cooking is excellent. I always enjoy your meals."

Mia lowered her head, unable to respond. She had indeed been planted as Vivian's personal chef, but guilt now consumed her.

In the following days, poison found its way into every meal.

Emily often dined with them too. With no choice, Mia poisoned both women.

......

After handling urgent business abroad, Ethan Roscente could no longer suppress his longing. He secretly flew back to the States.

The villa Simon Eisner purchased for him stood just blocks from Vivian's home.

He knew this behavior bordered on obsession, but proximity was the only comfort he allowed himself.

They both clearly still cared. Only one fragile layer remained between them.

Yet he couldn't bring himself to face her, choosing instead to watch over her from the shadows.

During a midday video conference, Ethan suddenly heard screams from next door.

"Vivian! What's wrong?"

He terminated the call immediately. "Proceed as planned!"

Before the words fully left his mouth, he was already sprinting toward the door.

Inside Vivian's villa, she clutched her abdomen after just a few bites of lunch.

Excruciating pain crashed over her like tidal waves. Cold sweat soaked through her blouse instantly.

"Vivian!" Emily threw down her chopsticks and rushed over. "Someone help! Call an ambulance!"

The house stood eerily empty. All staff had mysteriously vanished.

Upstairs, Mia trembled violently at the commotion. She clamped both hands over her mouth, too terrified to descend.

The poison must have taken effect.

Frantically, she packed her belongings, desperate to flee.

If discovered, the consequences would be unthinkable.
###Chapter 938

Emily's eyes reddened with panic as her trembling fingers dialed the number.

"Vivian..." Her voice choked with tears.

Vivian struggled to sit up from the couch, her temples damp with cold sweat.

"Help me to the bedroom."

Her lips pressed into a thin line, knuckles whitening from the strain.

Emily fumbled to support her. "We need to get you to the hospital!"

"Wait—"

Before she could finish, the front door burst open.

"Vivian!"

Ethan stood in the doorway, his black trench coat glistening with night dew.

Vivian's pupils constricted.

"How did you—"

He cut her off, crossing the room in three strides and scooping her into his arms.

"To the hospital."

Emily exhaled in relief as she hurried after them.

Ethan's muscles tensed, yet his hold remained gentle, as if cradling fragile porcelain.

"Where does it hurt?"

Emily interjected, "She suddenly had abdominal pain—"

Vivian's nails dug into her palms, sweat dripping from her chin.

"Don't be afraid."

Ethan's voice was low and steady.

He had already arranged everything. The black sedan sped through the night, neon lights streaking past the windows.

Medical staff waited at the hospital entrance with a stretcher.

"Pregnant woman, acute abdominal pain."

Vivian stiffened at his words.

He knew.

He actually knew about her pregnancy.

Her fingers clenched his collar. "You—"

Ethan grasped her icy hand. "Examination first."

His gaze was unfathomable, concealing too many unspoken secrets.
###Chapter 939

Vivian Laurent lay on the examination table, her fingers gripping the sheets tightly. As a pregnant woman, she couldn't undergo X-rays or take painkillers, forcing her to endure the waves of cramping agony.

The doctor's hand trembled slightly as he held the blood collection needle. This was the renowned Dr. Luna from medical circles, now his patient. Beads of nervous sweat formed on his forehead.

"Draw blood for tests first," Vivian said through clenched teeth, her voice strained with pain.

The doctor snapped back to attention and began the procedure. When the needle pierced her skin, Vivian didn't even flinch. Compared to the pain in her abdomen, this was nothing.

While waiting for test results, Vivian's thoughts drifted to the man who'd suddenly appeared. How had Ethan Roscente known she was here? When had he discovered her pregnancy?

She'd thought her secret was safe. Now it was clear he'd known everything all along, silently playing along with her charade.

Outside in the hallway, Ethan paced restlessly, his dress shoes tapping an anxious rhythm against the floor. His worried gaze kept returning to the closed examination room door.

"Brother-in-law, what are you doing here?" Emily Garnache finally asked. She distinctly remembered Vivian saying Ethan didn't know their address in America.

"I never left," Ethan replied in a low voice. He'd been watching over Vivian since the day she left. Had he not arrived today, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

Emily opened her mouth but remained silent. Studying Ethan's tense profile, she suddenly understood the depth of his feelings for Vivian.

"What did Vivian do today?" Ethan turned abruptly, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Just had lunch as usual, then suddenly complained of stomach pain..." Emily recalled. "All the mansion staff were gone, so I called for help."

Ethan's expression darkened. He immediately pulled out his phone. "Detain every staff member at the estate. Not one gets away."

After hanging up, he stared out the window. The setting sun stretched his shadow long across the floor, like an unsheathed sword. Whoever was behind this would pay dearly.
###Chapter 940

The blood test report was handed to Vivian Laurent.

Her pupils constricted sharply as she stared at the abnormal data.

"Poisoning."

The doctor nodded gravely. "Not food poisoning. This was deliberate."

Vivian's fingertips turned cold.

Who could have poisoned her without her noticing?

When had the toxin entered her system?

Her mind raced.

"Analyze the toxin composition," she said quietly. "Don't tell the man outside. And bring that girl in for testing."

Emily Garnache was quickly escorted into the examination room.

"Vivian, are you okay?" Emily's face was etched with worry.

"I'm fine." Vivian handed her a blood collection tube. "Get tested too."

"Poisoned?" Emily's eyes widened. "But I feel completely normal!"

"Just a precaution."

After the blood draw, Vivian asked casually, "What did Ethan Roscente say outside?"

"He just asked about your recent condition." Emily blinked. "Should I call him in?"

"No." Vivian shook her head. "Don't mention the poisoning."

Emily's test results came back faster than expected.

"You've been poisoned too." The doctor pointed at the report.

Emily shot to her feet. "That's impossible!"

She had no symptoms.

How could she be poisoned?

Vivian studied both reports, her gaze turning icy.

The same toxin.

The same dosage.

"What have we both been exposed to recently?" she asked Emily.

Emily bit her lip in thought. "We eat and live together... Skincare products? Perfume?"

"No." Vivian shook her head. "I've already checked those."

The doctor interjected, "Both of you show trace amounts. This appears to be long-term, low-dose exposure."

Long-term?

Vivian's pulse spiked.

"Run tests on everything we've come into contact with over the past three months."

She turned to the doctor. "Could this toxin affect a fetus?"

The doctor hesitated. "At these levels... it shouldn't."

Shouldn't.

Vivian clenched her fists.

"Vivian..." Emily's voice trembled. "Are we—"

"Stay calm." Vivian gripped her hand. "First, we find the source."

The examination room door suddenly swung open.

Ethan Roscente stood in the doorway, his expression dark. "What are you hiding from me?"
###Chapter 941

Vivian Laurent stared at the toxicology report in her hands, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Emily Garnache's blood analysis results were identical to hers.

This was no coincidence.

"Someone poisoned us deliberately," Vivian's voice was icy.

The only people with access to both of them were the household staff.

She immediately called Lucas Lefèvre. "Brother, detain all the mansion staff. Don't let anyone leave."

Hanging up, she turned to Emily. "When we see Ethan Roscente later, tell him we're fine."

"I understand," Emily nodded.

Guilt flashed in Vivian's eyes. "I dragged you into this."

"Don't say that!" Emily protested. "But what about the baby? You're pregnant!"

Vivian gently touched her abdomen, her brow furrowed.

The recent stress had accelerated the poison's effects in her system.

"I'll find the antidote," Vivian said firmly. "I won't let anything happen to you."

"But you can't take medication now—"

"I'm a doctor. I know my limits," Vivian cut her off. "I just didn't expect someone to exploit this."

Admiration filled Emily's eyes. She'd heard about Vivian's miraculous medical skills from Fiona Grandelle.

"Let's go. We shouldn't keep Ethan waiting," Vivian composed herself. "You head back first."

The moment the ER doors opened, Ethan rushed forward.

"What happened? Do you need hospitalization? Are you still in pain?" His questions came rapid-fire.

Emily tactfully excused herself.

Vivian met Ethan's gaze directly. "I should be asking you the questions."

"This is America. Why are you here?"

What was even more suspicious was that he'd not only appeared at the perfect moment but also knew about her pregnancy.

Vivian narrowed her eyes.

This Ethan Roscente had been hiding far more than she realized.
###Chapter 942

"Don't worry about me. Your health comes first." Ethan Roscente's brow furrowed. "Tell me the truth."

"All test results are normal." Vivian Laurent smoothed her clothes. "The doctor said I can be discharged."

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Really?"

"Why would I lie?"

"I'll confirm with the doctor." He turned to leave.

Vivian grabbed his arm. "I am the doctor. Who else would you ask? Let's go home."

"At least get some medication?"

"Do pregnant women take random drugs?" Vivian suddenly raised an eyebrow. "Speaking of which, when you drugged me last time, did you consider our baby?"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "That was specially formulated. Harmless for pregnancy." His voice lowered. "That... was impulsive of me."

"Where's the car?" Vivian changed the subject.

"Outside."

"Let's go."

As Ethan reached the hospital entrance, he suddenly clutched his stomach. "Wait, I need the restroom."

He hurried back, heading straight for the doctor's office.

"What's really going on with Dr. Laurent?" he demanded.

The doctor hesitated. "Mr. Roscente, this—"

"I'm family."

"Dr. Laurent is the specialist here..."

Ethan's gaze darkened as he pulled out his phone. His fingers flew across the screen, pulling up Vivian's test results.

He immediately forwarded them to a specialist at Capital Hospital.

The reply came quickly: Signs of poisoning.

Ethan's pupils constricted. Clutching his phone, he turned and collided with a familiar figure.

"The restroom is that way?" Vivian stood with crossed arms.

"You're poisoned?" Ethan's voice tightened.

The air between them froze.

"Who told you?" Vivian pressed her lips together. She'd specifically instructed the doctor to keep it confidential.
###Chapter 943

"I hacked the hospital system. The doctor had nothing to do with it." Vivian Laurent bit her lip, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt. "I know it was wrong, but I had to investigate your poisoning."

Ethan Roscente's brows furrowed so deeply they could crush a fly. He grabbed her wrist. "Poisoning is serious. You need to be hospitalized immediately."

"I'm fine." She shook off his grip. "Medication could harm the baby right now. What's the point of hospitalization?"

"What if there are complications?" Ethan's voice rose sharply before softening. "Vivian, think about the child if not yourself."

She turned away. "Stop using that tone like I'm some naive girl."

"What other girl would there be?" He let out a frustrated laugh. "There's only ever been you."

She should've known. Once Ethan caught wind of anything, he'd blow a molehill into a mountain. Vivian sighed. "I have a plan. Hospitalization would alert the enemy. Just cover for me with the hospital."

"What plan?" His eyes narrowed.

"Not here." She turned to leave.

In the bedroom, Ethan fluffed the pillows before helping her lie down. Suddenly, his voice took on a wounded tone. "You didn't tell me about the poisoning. Or the pregnancy. Do you really trust me so little?"

Vivian guiltily touched her nose. "They were minor issues. I didn't want you overreacting."

"Then what's your plan?" he pressed.

She abruptly sat up. "Answer me first—when did you know about the pregnancy?"

His ears visibly reddened. Clearing his throat, he murmured, "That time in Eudora."

"Which time?"

"When Theo got stabbed by Sophia Evans. You collapsed after performing multiple surgeries." His voice grew quieter. "The examination showed you'd been pregnant for months."

Meeting her gaze directly, he continued, "You knew all along but kept it from me. This child...is mine, right? Conceived during that Eudora trip?"

Ethan almost laughed at himself. They really were inextricably tied to that kingdom.
###Chapter 944

Vivian's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her shirt.

She never expected Ethan had known the truth all along, silently playing along with her charade.

"If you knew, why didn't you expose me sooner?" Her voice trembled slightly.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

"I was afraid of scaring you," he murmured. "Even more afraid you'd run further away."

Vivian abruptly turned her head, avoiding his burning gaze.

"This child has nothing to do with you," she said through clenched teeth. "Stop deluding yourself."

She had to protect this secret. If Ethan tried to take the baby, she'd rather disappear with the child forever.

"Vivi." Ethan suddenly smiled. "Your ears turn red when you lie."

Vivian instinctively covered her ears.

"These past months...it must've been hard on you alone." His voice softened unexpectedly. "Was the morning sickness bad? Did you sleep well at night?"

Her eyes burned suddenly.

"I don't need your fake concern!" She hardened her heart. "I don't need anyone taking responsibility."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

"I'm not here to take the child," he said quietly. "I just want to take care of you both."

The words felt like a blunt knife twisting in Vivian's chest.

She clenched her fists. "Then why were you following me?"

Ethan admitted frankly, "I've been behind you since the day you left the island."

"You're insane?" Vivian's eyes widened in disbelief.

"Yes, I am." Ethan stepped forward. "For you, I'd do anything."

Vivian stumbled back against the wall.

"You think this is romantic?" Her voice shook. "This is harassment!"

Ethan's gaze was terrifyingly stubborn.

"I don't care what you think," he said hoarsely. "As long as I can see you, I'll gladly be the villain."

Vivian's chest rose and fell rapidly.

"Feelings can't be forced," she said with difficulty.

Ethan suddenly smiled.

"Who said anything about forcing you?" He wiped a tear from her cheek. "Loving you is my choice—it has nothing to do with you."

The words shattered Vivian's defenses completely.
###Chapter 945

Vivian's temples throbbed. Ethan actually thought she was the heroine of this story and believed she had nothing to do with it?

"You think this is romantic? That it would move me?"

Ethan shook his head. "I just want to protect you."

She was too tired to argue. His stubbornness was something she knew all too well.

"Vivian, it's time you told me your plan."

Seeing no way to get rid of him, she relented. "The cause of my poisoning is still unclear. Emily's blood also contains toxins. The culprit is likely one of the villa's maids."

As soon as she finished speaking, her phone rang.

"Viv, all the other staff are accounted for—only Mia, the cook, is missing." Lucas's voice was tense.

Her eyes turned cold. Mia had been acting strangely lately, always urging her to eat more.

"Keep searching! Check airports and train stations!"

Ethan spoke up suddenly. "I know where she is."

Lucas paused. "Who was that?"

"The driver," Vivian lied.

Hanging up, she fixed Ethan with a glare. "How do you know Mia?"

"I had all the staff monitored. Just received word that a girl trying to flee was intercepted."

Soon, Mia was brought back. Her face was pale, her gaze shifty when she saw Vivian.

Though she hadn't confessed, her trembling fingers betrayed her.
###Chapter 946

Vivian Laurent's gaze was as sharp as a blade, piercing straight through Mia Lombardi.

Mia kept her head down, fingers tightly twisting the hem of her dress.

"Mia, where are you rushing off to?" Vivian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Beads of sweat formed on Mia's forehead. "I...I just wanted to take a walk...maybe buy groceries...to cook dinner for you..."

"Dinner?" Vivian let out a cold laugh. "Or poison?"

Mia trembled violently, her face turning ghostly pale. "Miss Vivian...what are you saying...how could I..."

She had already disposed of the leftover lunch. Even the trash had been taken out. There was no way Vivian could find evidence.

"My food has been poisoned for some time." Vivian stepped closer. "Tell me who put you up to this, and I'll let it go."

Tears welled up in Mia's eyes. "Miss Vivian...I really don't know...you've been so kind to me...why would I..."

"Kind?" Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Good salary, easy work. I've treated you fairly. Why betray me?"

"I didn't...Miss Vivian, you can't accuse me like this..." Mia bit her lip hard.

At that moment, Ethan Roscente pushed open the door.

"Want proof?" He smirked and snapped his fingers.

An associate immediately brought forward a food container.

"We found the food you threw away." Ethan looked down at her coldly. "We also pulled the surveillance footage. Care to see it?"

Mia's legs began to shake.

"Toxicology report is right here." Ethan tossed a file onto the table. "You know the penalty for attempted poisoning."

Mia's nails dug deep into her palms.

"I...I really didn't know..." Her voice grew smaller.

Vivian sighed. "Mia, this is your last chance. Name your employer, and I'll protect you."

The air in the room seemed to freeze.
###Chapter 947

Mia's fingers twisted together tightly.

Her chest felt like it was weighed down by a boulder.

Vivian's gentle gaze made her burn with shame.

With a thud, she dropped heavily to her knees.

"Vivian... I betrayed you..."

Tears splattered against the floor.

"I had no choice... That man poisoned me..."

Her voice trembled violently.

"Every attack feels like thousands of ants gnawing at my insides..."

Mia's nails dug deep into her palms.

"He threatened me... Forced me to poison your meals..."

She finally broke down sobbing.

Vivian's brow furrowed slightly.

"You're poisoned too?"

She stepped forward swiftly to help Mia up.

"Let me examine you."

Mia froze.

She hadn't expected Vivian's first concern to be for her.

Slap!

Mia struck her own face hard.

"I deserve to die..."

Vivian caught her hand.

"Stop this."

She retrieved the medical kit.

"We'll do a blood test first."

Ethan took the sample tube.

"I'll rush it to the hospital."

Between hiccuping sobs, Mia described the mysterious man.

"He was about six feet tall... Wore a mask..."

Vivian's expression turned thoughtful.

"Could be using disguises..."

She turned to Ethan.

"Check the surveillance?"

Ethan already had his laptop open.

"On it."

His fingers flew across the keyboard.

Vivian arched an eyebrow.

"You have hidden talents, Mr. Roscente?"

"Just a hobby."

He didn't look up.

Suddenly the screen footage disappeared.

"Footage was erased."

His eyes narrowed.

"Interesting."

Slender fingers continued typing.

Vivian leaned closer to the screen.

"Can you recover it?"

Ethan's lips curved slightly.

"Piece of cake."

The screen's glow accentuated the sharp angles of his profile.
###Chapter 948

The surveillance footage had already been wiped clean. Vivian didn't hold out much hope.

After nearly a month, finding anything would be a miracle.

But Ethan's hacking skills were alarmingly proficient. Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You're quite skilled at this. A computer expert?"

"Passable," he replied casually.

Vivian narrowed her eyes. "Do you know King?"

Or was he King himself?

She suddenly remembered the last time she'd hacked into his company's system as payback. The breach had been patched suspiciously fast.

At the time, Ethan had even probed whether she was Queen.

Who else but King could have identified her so quickly?

Ethan remained expressionless. "Never heard of him."

"Stop lying. You're King."

Vivian's lips curled into a cold smile.

Her most hated rival—the one who kept breaching her firewalls—was standing right in front of her.

"Then answer me first," Ethan countered smoothly. "Are you Queen?"

Vivian hesitated.

Wasn't it obvious?

Mimicking his tone, she said, "No."

"Then neither am I," he replied with equal calm.

Vivian's smile turned sardonic.

With the trail long cold, Ethan closed his laptop. "If someone's targeting you, any suspicions? Judging by height alone, the person isn't short."

"None."

"Then let me share mine." Ethan's gaze sharpened. "It's either Dominic or Zero."

"Certain?" Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Got a grudge against them?"

"Just analysis." His voice remained steady. "Dominic operates openly. If he wanted you dead, he'd come straight at you. So..."

He paused meaningfully. "That leaves Zero."

"Zero never fights fair. Maintains a facade while stabbing you in the back."

Ethan gave her a pointed look. "Especially after you sent his apprentice to prison."

Vivian fell silent.

The enmity between her and Zero wasn't something she liked dwelling on.
###Chapter 949

Mia suddenly remembered something, nervously twisting her fingers. "Vivian, that person also asked me about your secrets. I didn't know what to say, so I mentioned your pregnancy. His reaction... was strange."

"Shocked?" Vivian narrowed her eyes.

That reaction said everything. It couldn't be Dominic.

Dominic already knew about her pregnancy and had obtained her address from Finn. He wouldn't go through such elaborate measures.

"Dominic is ruled out," Vivian stated firmly.

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "So sure?"

His tone carried clear displeasure. Why did this woman always defend Dominic?

"He knew about my pregnancy," Vivian said bluntly.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. "Dominic knew?"

The whole world knew except him—the actual father.

"Now isn't the time for this," Vivian quickly analyzed. "Based on the timeline, the person acted after I returned from Eudora. This place is well-hidden. The only way they could've found it—"

"—is by following you," Ethan finished, his gaze turning icy.

"I was in Eudora, not Canada. That means this person was also in Eudora." Vivian's voice lowered. "They must know what happened there. Even if they weren't the mastermind, they're involved."

Ethan stood. "Investigate Liam's movements in Eudora. No disguise is perfect."

He turned to retrieve files. Vivian remained seated, her fingertips cold.

If it really was Liam...

She had always considered him a life-and-death ally. Ethan had warned her repeatedly about Liam's danger, yet she chose to trust him.

When had things changed?

Was it after she rescued Liam and they disagreed? Or when he relentlessly pursued her after she left the organization?

A more terrifying thought surfaced: What if Liam had known about her existence from the start? What if that so-called rescue was just a trap to draw her out?

And if she traced it further back... the car accident four years ago—could that also have been...?

Vivian abruptly cut off her thoughts. These were just speculations without proof.

She suddenly realized she might never have truly understood Liam.

She saw him as a close friend. But what had he seen her as?

Annika was Liam's protégé. Could Liam truly have been unaware of her actions?

Or was it not ignorance... but his control all along?

A cold sweat broke out on Vivian's back. The human heart was more terrifying than any devil.

Especially Liam—the current director of DarkKingdom, ranked first on the Dark Web's agent leaderboard. The most infamous and ruthless top agent.
###Chapter 950

"We've confirmed Zero was spotted in Eudora." Ethan Roscente slid an encrypted file across the table to Vivian Laurent. "He used a fake identity, but surveillance caught a blurry profile."

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the dossier.

"More suspiciously," Ethan lowered his voice, "he met secretly with Eudora's Deputy Health Minister the day before the Queen's incident."

Silence stretched between them.

When no response came, Ethan turned to find Vivian gazing blankly out the window.

"Vivian?" He gently touched her shoulder.

She startled. "Hmm?"

"You're pale." Ethan frowned. "Should I call a doctor?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine."

Her thoughts lingered on Zero—the man who'd once saved her life now seemed determined to end it.

"I suspect the Queen's premature delivery wasn't accidental." Ethan's voice turned grave. "Zero may be involved."

Vivian nodded mechanically.

Mia Lombardi suddenly dropped to her knees. "It's all my fault, Vivian! Punish me however you see fit!"

Vivian helped her up. "This isn't on you."

Turning to Ethan, she said, "Don't alert him yet. Let Mia keep pretending to poison me."

In the lab, Vivian studied the blood sample containing the toxin extracted from Mia. She needed to develop an antidote quickly.

A memory flashed—ten years ago in a damp basement.

Bruised and broken, she'd curled in a corner. Young Zero offered a handkerchief and half a cold meat bun.

"Eat." His voice had been soft then. "Only the living have hope."

That Zero still had light in his eyes.

Now...

Vivian tightened her grip on the test tube. The glass reflected her pallid face.

Zero, what do you really want?
###Chapter 951

Vivian Laurent sat by the bay window, lost in thought.

The sunlight streamed in beautifully, yet failed to pierce the chaos in her mind.

Ethan Roscente approached with a cashmere blanket and draped it gently over her shoulders. "It's getting cold. Don't catch a chill."

"I'm fine."

He took her slightly cold fingertips, frowning. "Your hands are freezing, yet you still insist you're not."

His warm palm enveloped hers as he murmured, "Someone like him isn't worth your thoughts."

"You know what I'm thinking about?" Vivian lifted her gaze.

Ethan's thumb brushed the back of her hand. "Zero, isn't it?"

"You considered him your closest friend, yet he betrayed that trust." His eyes darkened. "I envy the place he once held in your heart."

"But the Zero you knew no longer exists."

He leaned in abruptly, his nose nearly touching hers. "I'm not like them. I would never hurt you."

Vivian turned her face away. "Why should I believe you?"

"What could I possibly want from you?" He chuckled lowly. "At most, I'd want you—"

"To trick you into becoming Mrs. Roscente."

"Stop joking!" She pushed him, only to be pulled tighter into his embrace.

Ethan's hand rested on her slightly rounded abdomen. "Does the baby miss Daddy?"

A faint flutter pulsed against his palm.

His eyes lit up. "The baby just kicked me!"

"That means they dislike you." Vivian tried to pull back.

Ethan followed, pressing closer. "Should we get a paternity test after they're born?"

"You—!"

Vivian was speechless. She had fled to this secluded island to avoid him, yet he'd still found her.

"It's natural for babies to be shy around strangers." He kissed the top of her head. "Daddy will stay with you both every day from now on."

"Who said you could call yourself Daddy?"

Ethan's expression turned serious. "Vivian, I won't let you run away this time."

Sunlight cast shadows over his lashes as she saw the unwavering determination in his eyes—like starlight refusing to fade.
###Chapter 952

Vivian's silence confirmed Ethan's suspicion.

Her lowered lashes fluttered slightly, betraying her unease.

Ethan's gaze darkened as his well-defined fingers brushed her cheek.

"Vivian, you can't escape me."

His deep voice carried unshakable certainty.

She instinctively stepped back, only for his arm to lock around her waist.

Ethan pulled her flush against him, his embrace crushing as if to fuse their bodies together.

"Let go..."

"Never."

His chin rested atop her head, voice muffled against her hair.

"I searched for you so long. Do you think I'd let you go now?"

She could feel the vibration of his chest, his heartbeat loud against her ear.

"Ethan, are you serious?"

"Shall I carve out my heart to prove it?"

"Psycho."

She scoffed, but couldn't suppress the smile tugging at her lips.

"One last chance."

Vivian finally relented, her fingers unconsciously clutching his shirt.

Ethan froze, light gradually dawning in his eyes.

"Really?"

"Three-month probation. Fail and you're out."

She kept her expression stern but startled when his handsome face suddenly closed in.

"What are you—"

"Sealing the deal."

His warm lips captured hers in an inescapable kiss.

Vivian pounded his chest in protest, only for him to deepen the kiss while trapping her wrists.

"Demerit!"

"Dock my points. I'll make them up."

Ethan licked his lips smugly, mischief dancing in his eyes.

His expression turned serious. "Come home with me."

"It's too cold here. Not good for the pregnancy."

His long fingers traced her noticeably thinner face with aching tenderness.

"Theo keeps asking for you."

At the mention of their child, Vivian's gaze softened.

"Isabella won't stop pestering me either."

Ethan pressed his advantage, listing all the benefits of returning.

Vivian grew thoughtful.

She did miss familiar faces.

But Zero's threat loomed large—was home truly safe?

"I'll cook for you personally. Balanced nutrition guaranteed."

Sensing her hesitation, Ethan pressed on.

"24/7 personal protection, hm?"

His warm breath teased her sensitive earlobe.

Vivian's ears burned as she pushed his face away.

"Stop that."

"How about this?"

Suddenly he knelt on one knee, taking her hand.

"Come home with me. Please?"
###Chapter 953

"This food is inedible. I can't swallow a single bite!"

"I took cooking classes to improve. Let me order fresh ingredients. You need proper nutrition—you're so thin it breaks my heart."

Ethan Roscente gently traced Vivian Laurent's cheekbone with his fingertips.

His frown deepened at the hollow feel beneath his touch.

Her face had lost all its softness.

"Nonsense, I've actually gained weight," Vivian turned her face away.

"Stubborn as always." Ethan shook his head. "Rest now. I'll prepare dinner. We're taking the private jet home tomorrow."

"Fine. But we're bringing Mia with us. Once the toxicology report comes in, I'll need to formulate her antidote."

Ethan tapped her forehead lightly. "Focus on your own recovery first. Purge those toxins completely—for your sake and our baby's. Nathan can handle Mia's treatment. His medical skills are competent enough."

Vivian considered this before nodding.

Her senior colleague was indeed capable.

At eight months pregnant, mobility became increasingly difficult.

"We're going to my place, not yours. No arguments."

"As you wish, my queen."

Ethan massaged Vivian's aching lower back while coordinating their return.

The Zero organization remained unaware—their charade could continue back home.

Strangely, despite days of sleeplessness...

The familiar scent of Ethan's cologne made Vivian's eyelids grow heavy.

She drifted off against his shoulder without realizing it.

Her breathing gradually softened.

"Viv—"

Emily Garnache froze mid-step at the sight.

Ethan pressed a finger to his lips.

The girl retreated upstairs on tiptoe.

Silence enveloped the villa, broken only by their synchronized breathing.

Ethan studied Vivian's sleeping face.

Thank God he'd arrived in time.

Cradling her head gently onto a cushion, he rose and headed to the kitchen.

Only meals prepared by his own hands could ease his mind now.

He should've become her personal chef sooner—before the poisoning.

The aroma of sautéing ingredients soon filled the air.

Vivian twitched her nose in sleep before blinking awake.

She rubbed her temples.

How peculiar.

After nights of insomnia...

Why did she always sleep so soundly in his presence?
###Chapter 954

The clatter of cooking utensils came from the kitchen.

Vivian turned toward the sound and saw Ethan emerging with steaming dishes.

"You're awake?" His eyes crinkled with warmth. "Wash up for dinner. Emily said you barely ate at lunch."

The savory aroma in the air stirred her appetite.

Vivian instinctively touched her stomach.

"I'll get Emily." She headed upstairs.

Ethan disappeared back into the kitchen to serve the rice.

Emily's bedroom door was slightly ajar.

"Emily, dinner's ready."

The door swung open as Emily bounced out.

"Vivian!" She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "When you were napping earlier, the way Ethan looked at you—wow!"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Hmm?"

"Like you were the most precious treasure in the world!" Emily gestured dramatically. "I've never seen anyone gaze so lovingly."

The tips of Vivian's ears warmed.

"You're exaggerating."

"Am not!" Emily pouted. "When have I ever lied to you?"

They walked downstairs together.

Emily suddenly sighed. "I envy you two. When will someone love me like that?"

"You're still young." Vivian chuckled. "Your time will come."

"But I don't even know what liking someone feels like." Emily kicked at the steps dejectedly. "Tell me, Vivian?"

Vivian paused mid-step.

"It's..." Her gaze drifted toward the kitchen. "Your heart races when you see them. You miss them when they're gone. Yet you feel nervous together."

Emily tilted her head. "Like how Lulu feels about Dr. Ji?"

"Something like that." Vivian pinched her cheek playfully. "Should I introduce you to someone? Lucas isn't bad."

"Vivian!" Emily stomped her foot. "Stop teasing me!"

Laughing, they entered the dining room.

Ethan was setting the table.

"What's so amusing?" He glanced up.

Emily stuck out her tongue. "Secrets!"

The table was laden with aromatic dishes.

"You cooked all this?" Emily's eyes widened.

Ethan nodded. "Your sister hasn't had much appetite lately."

"Exactly!" Emily immediately tattled. "She's been eating like a bird these days!"

Vivian shot her a warning look.

Ethan placed a bowl of soup before Vivian. "Drink this first. It'll warm your stomach."
###Chapter 955

"Not at all. I've always had a big appetite." Vivian grabbed her chopsticks and started devouring the food, cheeks puffed up like a chipmunk.

Emily had been inseparable from Vivian these past days and knew exactly how little she usually ate. It always took constant nagging to get her to finish half a portion. Today was clearly an exception.

"Try the shrimp, Viv. It's really tender." Emily added another portion to her bowl.

Vivian demolished the first bowl and immediately went for seconds.

Seizing the moment, Emily winked at Ethan. "She hasn't eaten this well in ages. Your cooking really suits her taste."

Ethan's gaze lingered on Vivian's slender wrists, his brow furrowing. No wonder she was so thin—she'd been skipping meals. He silently vowed to cook for her every day from now on.

After two full bowls, Vivian leaned back with a contented sigh.

"I'm stuffed."

"Garden walk?" Ethan handed her a cup of digestive tea.

She accepted the cup and strolled outside. The garden roses bloomed vibrantly in the twilight.

"Have you thought about names yet?" Ethan asked casually. "Boy or girl?"

"We didn't check the gender." Vivian gently rubbed her belly. "Isn't it nice to keep it a surprise?"

Ethan nervously rubbed his hands together. "About the surname..."

"Obviously mine!" Vivian's eyes widened. "Don't even think about scheming!"

"What if it's twins—"

"Not happening!" She cut him off. "The ultrasound showed one baby. Besides, this is my child. What's it got to do with you?"

Ethan pouted. "Then maybe next time—"

"Who said there'd be a next time?" Her ears turned pink. "You're still on probation! Don't push your luck!"

"I think I've been doing pretty well."

"That's not for you to decide!" She kicked a pebble in frustration. "The baby isn't even born yet and you're already planning the next one?"

Ethan suddenly leaned closer. "At least let me help choose the name?"

"Why should I?"

"I am the father." He batted his eyelashes pitifully. "You pick the formal name. Just let me choose a nickname?"

Vivian couldn't help laughing. "Nothing weird!"

"I promise it'll be unique!" Ethan was already mentally flipping through dictionaries.
###Chapter 956

The morning sun filtered through the clouds, casting golden light across the private tarmac.

Vivian Laurent walked side by side with Ethan Roscente toward the waiting jet. The aircraft's door gleamed with a cold metallic sheen in the dawn light.

Before boarding, Vivian dialed Fiona Grandelle's number.

"How are the Queen and the baby doing?"

Fiona's cheerful voice came through the line. "My brother is recovering well in the hospital's special care unit. The royal family decided to keep it quiet for now. Our parents want him to live a normal life, away from all the drama."

"And your mother?"

"Mom's mental state improved tremendously after learning my brother survived. I'll be staying to care for her, so I won't be able to visit. But don't worry, I'm still taking those jewelry design classes."

A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. "Take care of your family, and yourself too."

After hanging up, she called Isabella Langley.

"What? You're coming back already?" Isabella's surprised voice crackled through the phone. "I thought you were staying longer."

Vivian glanced at Ethan. "Plans changed. Ethan knows everything now. I'll explain when we meet."

"Should we pick you up at the airport?"

"No need. Just meet us at my place."

The jet sliced through the clouds, leaving a white contrail across the azure sky.

Vivian stared out the window at the rolling sea of clouds, her fingers absently tracing patterns on the armrest. Though their trip to M country lasted mere weeks, it felt like a lifetime of upheaval.

Ethan's hand covered hers. "What's on your mind?"

"The meaning of this journey." She withdrew her hand. "We nearly died, yet nothing's changed."

When the plane touched down at Canada International Airport, the sunset painted half the sky crimson.

The terminal echoed with emptiness, their footsteps the only sound breaking the silence. Emily Garnache tactfully walked ahead, giving them space.

A black sedan Ethan arranged waited by the curb.

"Take Emily home first," Ethan instructed the driver.

Inside the car, Ethan took Vivian's hand again. "Vivian, about us—"

"There is no 'us.'" She cut him off sharply. "Remember, I'm only giving you a chance to make amends."

Ethan smirked. "Understood. But I assume we can tell your friends? I'll stick to the facts."

Vivian scoffed. "Your promises mean nothing."

Darkness had fully descended when the car entered the gated community.

Isabella and Lucas stood waiting at the doorstep. The moment Isabella spotted Ethan, she rushed forward. "Vivian! Why are you with him again?"

Ethan spoke first. "We have a special relationship now. Might be getting remarried soon."

Vivian elbowed him hard enough to draw a pained grunt.

"Don't listen to his nonsense." She shot Ethan a glare. "He just accidentally discovered my secret."

Isabella nodded knowingly, her gaze dropping to Vivian's flat stomach.

Lucas interjected, "Vivian, are you staying this time?"

"Probably." She sighed. "The cat's out of the bag anyway."

Isabella linked arms with her. "You mentioned something happened over there. What was it?"

Under the porch light, their four shadows stretched long across the steps.
###Chapter 957

Vivian Laurent recounted the incident in detail.

Isabella Langley's eyes widened. "Poison? Are you sure it was Zero?"

"I can't say with absolute certainty, but all evidence points to him."

Vivian's brow furrowed slightly as her fingers absently traced the rim of her teacup.

"Should I send someone to investigate further? Or confront him directly?" Isabella suggested.

Vivian shook her head. "It's not time to reveal our hand yet. Once we break cover, there's no going back."

She gently touched her rounded abdomen. "Let's wait until the baby is safely born. I'm just worried something might happen in these next two months."

"The Queen conceiving at her age was already high-risk, then she went into premature labor." Isabella's expression darkened. "If you hadn't intervened, the child wouldn't have survived."

She grasped Vivian's hand. "You're a target now too. So many people are watching your pregnancy like vultures."

"That's why I came back." Vivian smiled faintly. "With you and Lucas here, who would dare touch me?"

Isabella snorted. "Easy to say, but you still need to be careful. Speaking of which... what about Ethan?"

"He knows everything." Vivian lowered her gaze. "I gave him a chance, but haven't made a final decision yet. Consider it... an opportunity for us to start over."

She paused. "At least for now, I feel at ease when I'm with him."

Ethan's cooking always made her eat more than usual.

Stranger still, she slept more soundly with him nearby. That long-lost sense of security made her wonder if she'd been drugged with sleeping pills.

"What a lucky bastard!" Isabella gritted her teeth. "Getting a wife and child handed to him. I wish the baby wasn't his!"

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became—she wanted Ethan to experience raising another man's child.

Unfortunately, the DNA results were indisputable.

"Let's not talk about this." Vivian changed the subject. "I need to contact Nathan and have him examine what poison Mia was given."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "After she tried to poison you, you still want to save her? I would've dealt with her already!"

"The attack was aimed at me. Mia was just a pawn." Vivian sighed. "She's not inherently bad. I can't just let her die."

"Fine, fine." Isabella waved a hand in resignation. "Have it your way."
###Chapter 958

Vivian finally returned to her cozy home.

She sank into the sofa, completely relaxed.

Ethan had specifically arranged for Theo to visit.

"Aunt Vivian!" Theo called out cheerfully as soon as he entered.

This time, Vivian didn’t correct his form of address.

She smiled and beckoned him over. "Come here, let me take a look at you."

Theo dashed toward her, arms wide open, ready to throw himself into her embrace.

Ethan swiftly intercepted him. "Careful. Your aunt has a baby in her belly now."

Theo tilted his head, confused. "A baby?"

"Yes. You’re going to be a big brother," Ethan said, ruffling his hair.

The little boy’s eyes instantly lit up. "Really? I’m getting a baby brother or sister?"

He spun around excitedly in place.

"Aunt Vivian, don’t worry! I’ll be the best big brother ever!" He thumped his chest proudly.

Vivian’s smile softened. "Such a good boy."

She pulled Theo close. "No matter what, I’ll always love you just as much."

Theo nodded vigorously. "I know! Uncle Ethan and Aunt Vivian are the best!"

He nuzzled against her affectionately. "Aunt Vivian, I missed you so much."

"You’ll get to see me a lot more now," Vivian said, pinching his cheek playfully.

Ethan stood nearby, watching the heartwarming scene unfold.

A faint smile tugged at his lips.

In the past, work had consumed his entire world. Only now did he truly understand what happiness meant.

......

Tensions simmered beneath the surface at Roscente Group.

Ethan’s reduced presence at the company had emboldened certain individuals.

Victor Roscente quietly rallied shareholders, stoking discontent.

"Mr. Roscente has been neglecting his duties lately."

"The company is thriving, yet he barely shows his face."

"This is unacceptable."

Whispers filled the boardroom as shareholders exchanged disapproving murmurs.

Simon called Ethan. "Sir, the situation here is deteriorating."

"Handle it as usual," Ethan replied coolly. "Buy out any dissenters at market price."

"But Victor’s faction—"

Before Ethan could respond, Vivian’s voice cut in. "Go to the office."

She took the phone from him. "Simon, make sure he gets there immediately."

After hanging up, she fixed Ethan with a firm look. "Don’t make me lose respect for you."

Ethan chuckled helplessly. "As you command, my dear wife."
###Chapter 959

"Don't worry about me. The company needs you more right now."

"With so many people taking care of me here, what could possibly happen? But if someone takes advantage of your absence at Roscente Group, don't blame me for distracting you from work."

Ethan Roscente chuckled, his fingers gently brushing through her hair.

"Relax. Roscente Group will only belong to our Theo—or perhaps our future son. Victor Roscente has been coveting it for years, yet he's never succeeded."

Vivian Laurent turned her face away, though the tips of her ears betrayed her with a faint blush.

"Stop teasing and get to the office."

Ethan knew she wasn't truly upset. Before leaving, he pressed a kiss to her forehead.

"Wait for me."

Isabella Langley immediately scooted closer, eyes gleaming with curiosity.

"Viv, what exactly do you see in him?"

Vivian gazed at the plane leaves drifting outside the window, her expression distant.

"Maybe... I owed him from a past life."

The moment Ethan left, Vivian's smile vanished.

"Isabella, help me investigate the organization's mission records from recent years. Focus on the incident four years ago—when I was nearly killed."

The orange in Isabella's hand nearly slipped from her grasp.

"You suspect the organization is compromised?"

"No. I suspect Zero." Vivian's nails dug unconsciously into her palm. "I trusted him completely before. But now... I have to re-examine everything."

"You think... he orchestrated that mission?"

Vivian's breathing grew uneven.

"Zero arranged that final mission, yet the execution was delayed by two weeks. At the time, I'd just been drugged by Natalie—my physical condition deteriorated, my weight skyrocketed..."

She paused, her voice trembling.

"If I hadn't gained so much weight that it altered my appearance... in my severely injured state..."

Isabella seized her icy hands.

"I understand. I'll look into it. But Zero is meticulous. Any evidence is probably long gone—"

"Which is why we must be careful." Vivian tightened her grip. "We can't alert him."

Isabella gave a solemn nod before turning away, sharp determination flashing in her eyes.

Alone in the lab, Vivian stared absently at the liquid in the test tube.

The poison sample left by Mia Lombardi lay quietly on the workstation. A slow-acting toxin, its symptoms wouldn't manifest for three months.

If not for her heightened sensitivity due to pregnancy...

Her fingers brushed over the slight curve of her abdomen, a tender smile touching her lips.

"Thank you, little one."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden halo around her.

"Mommy will protect you."

Two more months. She counted silently, her gaze hardening with resolve.
###Chapter 960

Vivian Laurent's fingertips brushed lightly over her abdomen. The prenatal test results made her frown—the poison's effect on the fetus was far worse than she'd anticipated. One misstep could lead to fetal demise.

She quickly composed herself, folding the report and tucking it into her bag. Ethan Roscente could never find out. Given his temper, he'd storm Zero's hideout without hesitation.

Emily Garnache's antidote was showing progress, but Mia Lombardi's condition remained critical. Vivian paced the lab, her eyes fixed on the eerie blue glow emanating from a test tube.

"Viv, dead end." Isabella Langley pushed through the door, tossing a stack of documents onto the table. "Every trace has been wiped clean."

Vivian flipped through the papers, the rustling loud in the quiet room. "Expected." She shut the file. "But I have another lead."

"Who?"

"Annika Heilbronn."

Isabella shot to her feet. "Are you insane? She wants you dead!"

Vivian tapped the desk thoughtfully. "She's been with Zero for years. She must know something."

"But she's overseas, and Patrick Alpinus has her under tight surveillance—"

"Which is why we need Felix Valdemar's help." Vivian picked up her phone. "He's close with Patrick."

Isabella's face flushed crimson. "I am not asking that arrogant bastard for anything!"

Vivian had already dialed. Felix's cheerful voice crackled through the speaker: "What's up, sis?"

"Isabella needs a favor." Vivian winked at her fuming friend. "She's too shy to ask directly."

Felix's booming laugh filled the room. "Knew she missed me! Be there in ten."

Isabella hurled a cushion at the wall. "That bastard!"

Thirty minutes later, Felix barged into the lab. His gaze lingered on Isabella as he smirked. "Missed me?"

"In your dreams!" She spun on her heel to leave.

Vivian blocked Felix's path. "I need Patrick's contact. Don't tell Ethan."

His grin faded. "Trouble?"

"Personal matter." She handed him a teacup. "Consider it a favor to Isabella."

Felix studied the cup before pulling out his phone. "I'll give you the number—but I'm coming with you."

Vivian arched a brow. "Why?"

"To keep certain people from getting scammed again." He glanced pointedly at the door. "Besides, Annika's no pushover."

Outside, Isabella pressed her ear against the door. At his words, she kicked the wall in frustration—then hopped on one foot, cursing.

Vivian sighed at their antics. "Fine. It's settled."

Her fingers flew across her phone screen, the cold glow illuminating her face. This path to Annika would be anything but smooth.
###Chapter 961

Felix Valdemar rushed over the moment he got the call.

His flashy red sports car screeched to a halt outside the villa.

"Isabella! Isabella!" His voice carried across the courtyard before he even stepped out of the car.

Isabella Langley pushed open the door with a frown. "Felix, are you trying to summon spirits?"

Felix bounded up the steps two at a time. "You're the one who called me. I didn't want to keep you waiting."

He craned his neck to peer inside. "Dr. Laurent said it was urgent. Where's my tea?"

Isabella cracked her knuckles with a cold smile.

Felix immediately took two steps back. "Hey now, words not fists!"

"Since when are we civilized?" Isabella grabbed his collar and yanked him inside.

Felix stumbled into the living room like a scrawny chick. "Easy! This shirt costs a fortune!" He straightened his collar with a pout. "No wonder you're still single with that temper."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Who says I'm single?"

Felix froze mid-adjustment.

"What? You have a boyfriend?" His voice shot up an octave. "Since when?"

Isabella flopped onto the sofa. "None of your business."

"Of course it's my business!" Felix hopped in agitation. "Who is he? What does he do? Where does he live?"

"Playing detective now?" Isabella hurled a throw pillow at him.

Felix dodged nimbly. "I'm just looking out for you. There are so many scumbags out there—"

"And you're the king of them." Isabella smirked.

Felix leaned in with a huff. "With that temper of yours, who else would put up with you?"

"Looking to die?" Isabella grabbed a fruit knife from the coffee table.

Felix yelped and dove behind Vivian. "Dr. Laurent, save me!"

Vivian shook her head as she poured tea, exasperated by their antics.

"Isabella, put the knife down," she said wearily.

Isabella snorted and stabbed the knife back into the fruit platter.

Felix peeked out from behind Vivian. "You know who her boyfriend is, don't you, Dr. Laurent?"

His eyes shone with eager intensity, like an overexcited husky waiting for treats.

Vivian pressed her lips together to hide a smile and handed him a teacup. "Have some tea first."
###Chapter 962

Vivian's eyes widened in surprise. "Isabella has a boyfriend?"

She hadn't heard anything about this from Isabella.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Don't listen to his nonsense."

"Since when is this nonsense?" Felix raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you just admit it yourself?"

"You believe everything I say?" Isabella scoffed. "Since when did the great Felix Valdemar become so obedient?"

Seeing them about to argue again, Vivian quickly intervened. "Isabella, Felix is just concerned about you. Let's talk calmly."

Isabella huffed and turned her face away.

The tension in Felix's expression eased slightly, and an inexplicable sense of satisfaction bubbled up inside him.

He always knew someone as hot-tempered as Isabella would never find a partner.

If this girl really couldn't get married, he might as well take her in as a favor.

"Then why did you lie about having a boyfriend?" Felix pressed.

"None of your business," Isabella snapped. "Worry about yourself."

"So there isn't one?"

"Whether there is or isn't has nothing to do with you!"

Listening to their bickering, Vivian suddenly understood something.

She cleared her throat. "Felix, actually, I asked you here today because I need a favor. You're close with Patrick Alpinus, right?"

"Of course," Felix said proudly, tilting his chin up. "Patrick, Ethan, and I grew up together."

"I need his help with something. Could you connect me?"

"Easy." Felix agreed without hesitation. "But why not ask Ethan directly?"

"He's been too busy lately." Vivian smiled. "I didn't want to disturb him."

Felix pulled out his phone. "I'll give you his number."

"You could’ve just told me over the phone. No need to come all this way."

"It’s no trouble." Felix glanced at Isabella. "I also wanted to see Dr. Laurent."

Vivian couldn’t help but laugh. "To see me, or to see my dear Isabella?"

"Vivian!" Isabella bristled. "Don’t say nonsense! I’m not close with him at all!"

Felix immediately jumped in. "Isabella Langley, are you heartless? We’ve known each other for years!"

"Knowing each other doesn’t mean we’re close!"

"Dr. Laurent, tell me, isn’t she ungrateful?"

"Who are you calling ungrateful?!" Isabella grabbed a throw pillow and hurled it at him.

Vivian watched their playful scuffle and quietly stepped aside.

She dialed Patrick’s number. It rang several times before he answered.

"Officer Alpinus, it’s Vivian Laurent."

"I remember," came his amused voice. "Ethan Roscente’s wife, right?"

Vivian pressed her lips together but didn’t correct him this time.
###Chapter 963

"Detective Alpinus, I need a favor." Vivian's knuckles whitened around her phone.

"Is this about Annika's case?" Patrick's voice came through the receiver.

"Yes." She took a deep breath. "I need to see her."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Annika's being held in a maximum-security overseas prison." His tone turned grave. "Visitation isn't permitted under protocol."

Her fingernail traced the edge of her phone case.

"But considering your assistance during the arrest..." Patrick's voice softened. "I'll request special visitation clearance."

"Thank you." Some tension left her shoulders.

"However..." He hesitated. "Does Ethan know about this?"

Her lashes fluttered.

"Don't tell him." She lowered her voice. "He's preoccupied with the multinational acquisition."

Hanging up, Vivian turned to find Isabella twisting Felix's ear.

"Viv!" Isabella released him immediately. Felix hopped on one foot, clutching his reddened ear.

"All set?" Isabella approached.

Vivian nodded. "Waiting on Detective Alpinus's arrangements."

Isabella frowned. "In your condition..."

"What condition?" Felix rubbed his ear, inserting himself between them.

Isabella shot him a glare.

Vivian rested a hand on her abdomen. "There won't be another chance after delivery."

Felix's gaze dropped to her stomach. His eyes widened.

"Dr. Laurent, you're..." He sucked in a sharp breath. "Is that Ethan's?"

Isabella smacked the back of his head. "Obviously!"

Felix rubbed his skull, stunned. "Does Ethan know?"

A bitter smile touched Vivian's lips.

That was precisely what worried her.
###Chapter 964

"Get out of my way!" Isabella Langley shoved Felix Valdemar aside impatiently.

Felix stepped back obediently and pulled out his phone to call Ethan Roscente.

The moment the call connected, he blurted out, "Boss Ethan! Did you know Dr. Laurent is pregnant?"

A brief silence followed.

Of course Ethan knew—he was the father. But how did Felix find out?

"Did you go see Vivian?" Ethan's voice turned icy.

Remembering Vivian's warning, Felix stammered, "Not exactly... I ran into Isabella and saw Dr. Laurent looking like she was about to deliver. The baby's yours, right?"

"It is." Ethan confirmed without hesitation.

Felix exhaled in relief. "Good."

Then it hit him. "Wait—you're going to be a dad and didn't tell me? That's not cool, Boss Ethan!"

"I just found out myself." Ethan lied smoothly.

Felix sounded skeptical. "Alright... But damn, you work fast!"

"Didn't I get married faster than you too?"

"Yeah, you're always one step ahead." Felix quipped without thinking, "Even divorced faster than most."

Ethan's expression darkened. "Screw you."

"Okay, okay. As long as you know." Felix quickly changed the subject. "I was worried you might be in the dark."

"I'm tied up with work. Since you're with Vivian, keep an eye on her." Ethan paused. "Notify me immediately if anything happens."

Felix suddenly hesitated. "Uh... Sure..."

"Problem?" Ethan's tone turned dangerous.

"No!" Felix backpedaled. "Dr. Laurent is more than capable. She doesn't need me babysitting her."

He glanced furtively at Vivian, who had explicitly forbidden him from telling Ethan.

"Even the smartest people slip up. Just watch over her."

"Got it." Felix agreed, stealing another look at Vivian.

She was speaking quietly with Isabella.

"Are you really going? I still don't like this." Isabella frowned.

"Then come with me." Vivian reassured her. "We'll leave Ethan out of it. Happy now?"

Isabella finally nodded. "Much better. It's been ages since we worked a mission together. Let's see what Annika Heilbronn and her organization are really after."

Her expression darkened. "And that bastard Zero! You saved his life—he'd be dead without you!"

Vivian's eyes turned shadowed. "Isabella... I'm starting to think it was all a setup."

"You mean... he took that mission deliberately, got captured on purpose, just to draw you out?"

"Before revealing my identity, I crossed paths with Zero a few times." Vivian analyzed. "He probably suspected me but wasn't certain. So he played along... knowing I'd intervene."
###Chapter 965

Isabella Langley frowned, her fingers unconsciously tapping the desk.

"If what you're saying is true, the situation is more complicated than we imagined."

Vivian Laurent gently touched her rounded belly, determination flashing in her eyes.

"I need to meet Annika Heilbronn in person. She might be our breakthrough."

Isabella nodded in agreement. For the past two months, the Zero organization's activities had escalated. They thought the fake doctor incident was over, but new troubles had emerged.

"I'll go with you. Let's arrange the trip now."

Patrick Alpinus's call came at the perfect moment. He could arrange their meeting with Annika.

The next morning, they boarded an international flight. Vivian texted Ethan Roscente, telling him she was going on vacation with her best friend so he wouldn't worry.

At the airport exit, Patrick had been waiting for some time.

"Do you need to rest at the hotel first?"

Vivian shook her head, her long hair swaying in the breeze.

"We rested on the plane. Let's go see Annika directly."

Patrick looked slightly surprised but took them straight to the prison. During the drive, he studied Vivian through the rearview mirror.

"Annika's tight-lipped. We haven't gotten any useful information from her. She's truly worthy of being in the top ten of the Agent Leaderboard."

A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. If only Patrick knew the second-ranked agent "Shadow" was sitting in his car.

"Our conversation can't be recorded."

Patrick frowned. "That's against protocol."

Vivian's gaze sharpened like a blade.

"Protocols are flexible. If you insist on recording, I have ways to make sure you hear nothing."

She paused, her tone carrying undeniable confidence.

"I caught Annika. I can take her from you and return her without you noticing."

Patrick's grip on the steering wheel tightened. Mrs. Roscente was far from ordinary.

"I'll turn off the recorder, but you have to tell me your real identity."

Vivian chuckled, a flash of mischief in her eyes.

"I'm Vivian Laurent. Feel free to investigate if you don't believe me, Officer Alpinus."

Patrick gritted his teeth. He'd already dug into Vivian's background and found nothing. Even Ethan Roscente remained tight-lipped.

Who was this woman?

The police car entered the prison gates. Officers saluted as they passed.

"Captain Alpinus."
###Chapter 966

Patrick Alpinus rose swiftly through the police ranks. As the youngest homicide captain, his case clearance rate remained unmatched.

Under the interrogation room's harsh lights, Vivian Laurent stood out. Patrick narrowed his eyes—this woman was dangerous.

Annika Heilbronn's shackles clanked as guards led her into the visitation room. When she saw Vivian through the bulletproof glass, she lunged.

"You bitch!" Annika slammed against the glass, her knuckles turning white.

Two female officers restrained her. Patrick noted the invisible currents between their eerily similar faces.

Vivian twirled a pen lazily. "Why so emotional? Weren't we sisters?"

"Captain!" Annika whirled toward Patrick. "She's Shadow! The top hacker on Interpol's most wanted list!"

Patrick's pupils contracted. His grip tightened on the notepad.

Vivian chuckled. "Proof? I could say Captain Alpinus is Zero." She paused meaningfully. "Wouldn't that make for an interesting promotion?"

Annika paled instantly. "I... I was lying."

But suspicion had taken root. Patrick dismissed the guards while secretly planting a bug beneath the table.

Vivian bent down, retrieving the tiny device. "Captain, you dropped something." She rolled the bug between her fingers.

Patrick accepted it impassively. Outside, he activated a backup listening device.

A red light blinked from the signal jammer in the corner. Clenching his fist, he headed straight for the archives.

Vivian Laurent's file would reveal everything.
###Chapter 967

The air in the visitation room turned icy.

Vivian Laurent guided Isabella Langley to sit at the metal table.

Annika Heilbronn wore an oversized prison jumpsuit, silver strands already visible in her hair. Her face—so similar to Vivian's—was etched with fine wrinkles, her eyes clouded like a woman twice her age.

"Vivian, you dare show your face!" Annika's nails screeched against the table surface.

Vivian crossed her legs, lips curling. "I haven't broken any laws. Why wouldn't I come?" She leaned forward. "Master Zero can't visit this place. Give up already."

Annika's pupils contracted violently.

"What do you want?" she hissed through clenched teeth, looking ready to tear Vivian apart.

Vivian smoothed her sleeves with deliberate slowness. "To see how you're doing." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "And to inform you—your master's position in the organization is... precarious now."

"Liar!" Annika slammed both palms on the table.

Isabella flinched backward.

Vivian's laughter tinkled like broken glass. "I know you want me dead." She locked eyes with Annika's bloodshot gaze. "Because you're jealous Zero chose me."

The words stabbed like daggers.

"He doesn't love you!" Annika's voice cracked with hysteria.

Vivian reclined in her chair. "He confessed his feelings personally." She ran her tongue over her lips. "You copied my face hoping he'd love you instead, didn't you?"

Annika's breathing turned ragged.

"Shall I share our intimate moments?" Vivian's gaze turned suggestive. "He cooked for me. Held my hand. Even stole a kiss while I slept." Each revelation drained more color from Annika's face.

Isabella pinched her own thigh under the table.

"We'll be together soon." Vivian delivered the final blow. "You'll have to call me 'Master's Wife' then."

Annika lunged, only to be yanked back by her handcuffs. "Lies!" she howled like a caged beast. "Master would never love a bitch like you!"

Vivian's victorious smile bloomed.

Every whispered confession was fabricated. But watching Annika unravel made the performance worthwhile.
###Chapter 968

Vivian's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms. "You're lying! Master Zero only feels hatred for you—he'd kill you with his own hands if he could!"

A shadow flickered through Vivian's eyes, yet her lips curled into a sweet smile. "How adorable you look when lying. Did you see him take a bullet for me? Stay up all night brewing medicine?"

"All lies!" Annika slammed her palm against the glass partition. "He's wanted you dead since your Shadow days!"

Isabella gasped, instinctively clutching Vivian's arm.

Vivian gently stroked her abdomen, her smile widening. "Such a pity. This child inside me will have to call him Daddy."

"Shut up!" Annika's eyes burned crimson. "He'll never claim that bastard! Getting close to you was just part of the kill mission! That failed operation? His design!"

The glass reflected Vivian's suddenly pale face.

"The Dark Web incident was another trap." Annika laughed hysterically. "He let himself get captured, waiting for you to rescue him! Vivian, you've been his pawn from the beginning!"

Isabella felt Vivian's hand tremble.

"You thought he was still that Zero who protected you in training camp?" Annika's voice dripped venom. "The top-ranked agent on the leaderboard fed his heart to dogs years ago!"

Vivian's nails pierced her palms, blood trickling between her fingers.

Ethan's warning echoed in her ears. The boy who once wiped blood from her face had died in the passage of time.
###Chapter 969

Sunlight streamed through the glass window, casting shadows from Vivian's lashes across her face.

Her knuckles turned white as she clenched her fists.

"Impossible..." Vivian's voice trembled slightly. "Liam wouldn't do this to me..."

Annika watched her reaction with a cold smirk.

"Why not?" She leaned closer, whispering in Vivian's ear. "Your last mission went wrong because my Master Zero arranged it."

Vivian's head snapped up, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes.

"He's wanted you dead for a while." Annika's smile turned cruel. "Did you really think he considered you a friend?"

Vivian's heart sank.

All those smiles had been fake. Every act of concern—just a facade.

She remembered how meticulously Liam cleaned his dagger after each mission, with the same ease as someone eating or drinking.

Killing came as naturally to him as breathing.

"Seems..." Vivian murmured, "I was too naive."

Annika lifted her chin triumphantly. "At least you know now."

Suddenly, Vivian laughed.

The sound made Annika's spine stiffen.

"Thank you for telling me." Vivian's tone turned almost cheerful. "I was planning to test the waters anyway."

Annika's face darkened.

"What do you mean?"

Vivian adjusted her cuffs leisurely. "I'm pregnant. But the child isn't Liam's."

Annika's pupils contracted violently.

"You lied to me?" she shrieked.

Vivian's gaze turned icy.

"Liam wants me dead?" She chuckled. "Let's see who dies first."

Realization dawned on Annika—she'd been played.

She thrashed wildly but couldn't break free.

"Vivian! You bitch!" Annika screamed hysterically.

Without looking back, Vivian waved dismissively as she walked away.

"Give Liam my regards."

The door clicked shut, cutting off Annika's curses.

In the hallway, Vivian's expression hardened completely.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

"Confirmed." Her voice was clipped. "Liam was involved in that mission."

A pause on the other end.

"Should we move?"

Vivian squinted at the sunlight through the window.

"Not yet." Her whisper was lethal. "Let him live a few more days."
###Chapter 970

The truth was out. There was no point staying any longer.

Vivian Laurent and Isabella Langley turned to leave. Behind them, Annika Heilbronn's hysterical curses echoed through the air. "Vivian, you lying bitch! I hope you die horribly! My master will personally end you!"

Madness burned in Annika's eyes.

She wished Vivian would vanish from this world immediately.

Why did Vivian have everything? Why did fate always favor her?

Vivian kept walking without looking back.

But as she stepped over the threshold, she suddenly paused.

Slowly, she turned. Her icy gaze pierced straight through Annika. "Hate me all you want. But remember—some words can be spoken. Others cannot."

"If I'm here, do you really think your master is far behind? Go ahead. Test me."

Vivian's voice was soft, yet it hung over Annika's head like a guillotine blade.

When Vivian's figure finally disappeared, Annika let out a piercing scream.

She refused to accept being manipulated like this.

But she didn't dare take the risk.

Vivian's threat coiled around her heart like a venomous snake.

What if this was a trap?

What if Vivian was using her to lure out the entire organization?

She wouldn't let Vivian win!

...

Outside, Patrick Alpinus leaned against the wall.

Though he couldn't hear the conversation inside, he wasn't idle.

He dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"What is it?" Ethan's voice carried exhaustion, clearly occupied with pressing matters.

"Ethan, Vivian is Shadow, isn't she?" Patrick cut straight to the point.

A noticeable pause.

"Shadow? I don't know what you're talking about." Ethan played dumb.

"Cut the crap! Shadow—ranked second on the Agent Leaderboard! We've discussed this countless times!" Patrick gritted his teeth. "How long have you known? Keeping this from me all this time!"

"I genuinely don't know." Ethan continued dodging. "I have work to do. I'm hanging up."

As a husband, protecting his wife was his duty.

Especially when the other party was a cop.

"Wait!" Patrick snapped. "This is obstruction of justice!"

"Justice?" Ethan scoffed. "What crime has my wife committed? Got any proof?"

His tone suddenly shifted. "What did you find out?"

"Nothing." Patrick denied.

"Bullshit!" Ethan pressed. "We grew up together. You're keeping things from me now?"

"You're the one who's been hiding things!" Patrick shot back. "I've been investigating the Dark Web while you've been shielding Shadow!"
###Chapter 971
Terms of Exchange

"Patrick Alpinus, Shadow retired from the organization long ago. Her missions never involved casualties." Ethan Roscente's voice was low.

Patrick tapped his fingers lightly on the desk. "I understand. I just need to confirm Vivian Laurent's identity. I won't act rashly."

He knew better than anyone that without concrete evidence, any move would be futile.

"Your source?"

Vivian had sworn him to secrecy, but Patrick answered without hesitation. "She met with Annika Heilbronn today."

"What?" Ethan shot to his feet, sending documents scattering across the floor.

"She specifically asked me not to tell you." Patrick added, "Pretend you never heard this."

"What was the purpose? Who accompanied her? What did they discuss?" Ethan fired off questions like bullets.

"She detected the recording device. Isabella Langley was likely with her." Patrick narrowed his eyes. "Now it's your turn to answer me."

Ethan cleared his throat. "No."

"Are you messing with me?" Patrick's voice turned icy.

"You asked if it was, and I said no." Ethan feigned innocence. "What's the problem?"

Patrick clenched his phone.

He should've known better than to trust Ethan's slippery tongue.

But the truth was already obvious.

The call disconnected abruptly.

Vivian approached him. "Thank you for the convenience, Detective Alpinus."

"Finished your discussion?" Patrick pocketed his phone, his gaze sharp.

"Very smoothly." Vivian smiled faintly.

"How about dinner?" Patrick suggested. "My treat as your host."

Vivian shook her head. "Another time. Tonight's on me."

She needed time to process today's revelations.

"I'll arrange accommodations." Patrick left no room for refusal. "This area isn't safe. If anything happens to you, Ethan will have my head."

Vivian didn't argue. "I appreciate it."

"Drop the 'detective'—too formal." Patrick suddenly stepped closer. "Should I call you Vivian... or Shadow?"

His smile was pleasant, but his eyes cut like knives.

Isabella broke out in a cold sweat.

Annika's words had completely exposed Vivian's identity.
###Chapter 972 

"Shadow is quite an intriguing codename." Vivian Laurent toyed with her teacup, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Officer Alpinus, are you giving me nicknames now?"

Patrick Alpinus's piercing gaze locked onto her. "Vivian, after all this time, you're still pretending? Shadow, ranked second on the Agent Leaderboard—that's you."

"You have quite the imagination, Officer." Vivian set her cup down gently. "I'm just an ordinary designer."

"Ethan Roscente confessed everything." Patrick dropped the bombshell abruptly.

As the Interpol Agent, he excelled at interrogation tactics. Sudden revelations often caught suspects off guard.

"Oh?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Confessed what exactly?"

Outwardly composed, she cursed Patrick internally for breaking his promise. He'd sworn not to involve Ethan, yet here they were.

"He identified you as Shadow and specifically asked me to go easy on you." Patrick advanced step by step.

"You'd believe anything Ethan says?" Vivian stood, grabbing her handbag. "Then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. My answer remains unchanged—arrest me if you have evidence. Now if you'll excuse me."

She took Isabella Langley's arm and strode out.

Patrick quickly arranged their hotel suite and sent them off with an escort. Returning to interrogate Annika Heilbronn proved fruitless.

"You identified Vivian as Shadow earlier, now you're retracting?" Patrick slammed the table.

Annika smirked. "Did I? Where's your recording?"

The interrogation hit a wall. But Patrick wasn't discouraged—his real target had always been Zero, the top-ranked agent.

That bloodthirsty demon and his shadowy organization were the true objectives.

And Patrick had prepared accordingly.

Back in the lavish suite, Isabella locked the door immediately. "Viv, what do you make of Annika?"

"Patience." Vivian scanned the room before crouching beside the nightstand. Her fingers closed around a tiny listening device.

She held it up with a cold laugh. "Officer Alpinus, is this your professional ethics? Bugging a lady's room?"

Isabella gasped. "That's despicable!"

Vivian addressed the device directly. "If you want answers, ask me properly. Eavesdropping isn't very gentlemanly."

On the other end, Patrick's face stiffened. His meticulously hidden equipment had been discovered impossibly fast.
###Chapter 973

Vivian Laurent rolled the tiny earpiece between her fingers before slipping it into her ear.

Patrick Alpinus's voice came through immediately. "This was a misunderstanding. I didn't expect the person who booked the room to do this. I've already warned him."

A faint smile touched Vivian's lips. "Officer Patrick, planning a next time?"

"Absolutely not."

"Then I'll flush this earpiece down the toilet?"

Silence stretched on the other end before Patrick's restrained reply came. "Fine."

Vivian tossed the device into the toilet without hesitation and pressed the flush.

Isabella Langley clapped her hands in admiration. "Viv, you're incredible! I never would've thought of that."

"He was too eager. Suspiciously so." Vivian scanned the room. "Aside from the earpiece, it's clean. Patrick wouldn't go as far as installing cameras in a woman's room."

Isabella shuddered. "We almost walked right into that. If we hadn't noticed and said something compromising..." She lowered her voice. "Viv, he knows you're Shadow. Shouldn't we do something?"

"Unnecessary." Vivian shook her head. "I'm not his target."

"Then who is?"

"Possibly Zero. Or the organization. Or the Dark Web." Vivian's expression remained calm. "All my missions are clean. He has nothing on me."

Isabella exhaled in relief. "Good. But..." Her tone shifted. "What about what Annika said? Do you believe her?"

Vivian's eyes darkened.

"I think it's true." Her voice turned icy. "Zero wants me dead. And he's been planning it for a while."

Isabella slammed her palm on the table. "Ungrateful bastard! If you hadn't risked your life to save him years ago, he'd be rotting in a Dark Web grave!" Her hands trembled with rage. "And this is how he repays you? All his declarations of love—this is what they amount to?"

"He doesn't understand love." Vivian's voice was flat. "Compared to him, at least Ethan Roscente would never hurt me."

Isabella gritted her teeth. "So what now? Confront him, or..." She drew a finger across her throat.

"We're not assassins." Vivian gave a bitter smile. "Even if killing were an option, who could actually take him down?"

"Not even you?"

"Maybe in the past." Vivian rested a hand on her abdomen. "But pregnant? No chance. He didn't earn the top spot on the Agent Leaderboard for nothing."
###Chapter 974

Zero was the most dangerous assassin in the organization. His strikes were ruthless, and he never missed a target. No matter how difficult the mission, he always escaped unscathed.

That time he was captured by the Dark Web? It was all part of his plan. If he didn't want to be caught, no one could get near him.

Back in the organization, Vivian might have been his equal. But years away from the killing game had dulled her edge. What chilled her more was realizing Zero had wanted her dead for years.

She didn't understand. She'd never competed for power, only survival. Why would Zero want her eliminated?

"Vivian!" Isabella's voice snapped her back to reality.

She blinked. "What?"

"What's our next move? How do we take down Zero?"

Vivian considered. "We could partner with Patrick Alpinus. He's been investigating the Dark Web. He'll be interested."

"But we only get one shot," she added. "If we fail, Zero will never trust me again."

Isabella frowned. "Too risky. Will Ethan Roscente approve?"

"I don't need his permission." Vivian's tone was steel.

"What if Zero plans to kill you? You're eight months pregnant. You can't move like before..."

Vivian knew the dangers. But she had no choice.

"Maybe..." Isabella hesitated. "Pretend to be with him? He likes you, doesn't he?"

Vivian scoffed. "I can't do that."

She drew clear lines. How could she play nice with someone who wanted her dead? Especially when she felt nothing for Zero.

"Life never goes as planned," Vivian sighed. "All I wanted was peace, but trouble keeps finding me."

Only eighteen months since her divorce, yet it felt like half a lifetime. Eight months pregnant, and she hadn't stopped running.

Would she even get a quiet postpartum recovery? She doubted it.
###Chapter 975

Isabella Langley rolled her eyes. "Ethan Roscente is nothing but bad luck. Ever since you met him, trouble follows you everywhere."

Vivian Laurent chuckled. "That's quite the stretch."

"Let's regroup first." Vivian massaged her temples. "We need a solid plan to deal with Zero."

Isabella suddenly sat upright. "Don't push yourself too hard. You're carrying a baby, remember? How's the Queen's child doing?"

"Fiona Grandelle says the development is progressing well." Vivian's expression softened slightly.

"What about Fiona? Her second personality..." Isabella trailed off hesitantly.

Vivian sighed. "It's stable for now, but remains a concern."

Isabella collapsed onto the couch dramatically. "I'm exhausted. When can we retire already?"

"Planning retirement in your twenties?" Vivian laughed.

Isabella's eyes sparkled. "Once I save enough, I'll buy an island and hire a bunch of young hunks to wait on me!"

"You could do that now." Vivian teased. "Unless you're waiting for Felix Valdemar?"

"Bullshit!" Isabella bristled. "That bastard makes me want to punch him every time I see him!"

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "He's actually quite interesting."

"Interesting?" Isabella scoffed. "If I married him, I'd spend every day either hitting him or on my way to hit him!"

She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at the couch. "I'd never end up with that jerk in a million years!"
###Chapter 976 

Isabella couldn't stop talking about Felix Valdemar. She rambled on without realizing two hours had passed.

"That man is insufferable!" Isabella smacked the couch cushion in frustration. "I don't know what I did to deserve his constant harassment!"

She counted off on her fingers: "Stealing my projects, flaunting his achievements, always making sarcastic remarks!"

"But I gave as good as I got." A smug smile appeared. "I sabotaged three of his dates and reclaimed two projects."

Vivian rested her chin on her hand, watching with an amused expression.

"What's so funny, Viv?"

"Nothing." Vivian shook her head. "You two are quite entertaining."

Isabella frowned. "What do you mean?"

"You claim to hate him, yet your whole face lights up when talking about him." Vivian pointed out. "That's not how real hatred looks."

Isabella froze.

"Take Sophia and me." Vivian said quietly. "We'd gladly erase each other from existence. But you—do you truly want Felix gone?"

The question hit Isabella like cold water. She'd never considered it before.

If Felix really disappeared...

All their heated exchanges, their competitive banter, those moments of rage followed by instant retaliation...

"I... I don't know." For once, Isabella was at a loss for words.

Vivian stood and ruffled her hair. "Think about it. I believe Felix cares more than he lets on. I'm turning in."

Silence filled the room. Isabella stared absently at the sunlight outside.

Back home, it was midnight. Almost unconsciously, she picked up her phone and dialed Felix's number.

At that moment, Felix was entertaining clients at an upscale club. Cigarette smoke filled the private room, with hostesses seated beside each businessman.

His phone rang with a distinct tone—the custom ringtone he'd set exclusively for Isabella.

Felix's expression changed instantly.
###Chapter 977

Felix pushed his glass aside and stood up from the noisy private dining room. The hallway lights were too bright. He pulled out his cigarette case and headed toward the club entrance.

His phone screen lit up then dimmed again. By the time he stepped outside, Isabella's missed call had already ended.

He called back. Hesitant breathing came through the line.

"Hello?" Isabella's voice held suspicion. "Why are you calling so late?"

"You called me first." Felix's words slurred around the cigarette between his lips. "I was going to ask what you wanted."

Background music leaked through the receiver. Isabella pounced immediately. "Partying at a nightclub again?"

"Business meeting." Felix emphasized. "Legitimate work."

"Please." She snorted. "Let me guess - red dress on your left, black stockings on your right, and now you're hiding in the restroom to take this call?"

Felix whirled around. The streetlights illuminated empty pavement.

"Are you spying on me?" He lowered his voice.

"I'm overseas!" Isabella hissed. "With Vivian, remember?"

The reminder clicked. "Right, you went to see Patrick. So what's the emergency? Helping Dr. Laurent is fine, but you're on your own."

"Felix!" Her shout made his ear ring. "You're asking for death!"

"With that attitude, I'll bring popcorn to watch when you crash and burn." Felix leaned against the wall, his cigarette tip glowing in the dark.

Their bickering continued, yet somehow stretched to thirty minutes. Topics jumped from weather to food before circling back.

"How's it going over there?" Felix asked suddenly.

"Concerned about Vivian or me?" Isabella countered sharply.

Felix hesitated. He flicked ash. "Can't I ask casually?"

"It's... fine." She paused. "Some complications."

"What complications?" He straightened. "You okay?"

"Of course I am." She scoffed. "Mostly Vivian's situation... Wait, why should I tell you?"

Felix chuckled. "What secrets could you possibly have? Though if you come back injured, I'll never let you live it down."

"Dream on." The line went dead.

Night wind carried away the smoke. Felix stared at the darkened screen, his lips curving upward against his will.
###Chapter 978
Divine Opportunity

The night breeze carried a chill as Felix Valdemar stood outside the club, having talked on the phone for nearly an hour.

He barely noticed the cold, engrossed in his playful banter with Isabella Langley on the other end of the line.

"Are you in some kind of trouble?" Felix suddenly asked.

The click of high heels approached from a distance.

A heavily made-up woman sashayed toward him, her overpowering perfume assaulting his senses.

"Felix, I've been waiting for you~" she cooed, pressing herself against him.

Felix shoved her away violently. "Get lost!"

He hurriedly spoke into the phone, "Isabella, listen—I don't even know this woman!"

Isabella's cold laugh echoed through the receiver. "Quite the lively nightlife you have, Felix."

"It's not what you think!"

The woman clung to him again. "Felix~"

"Shut up!" He flung her off in a rage.

The call had already disconnected.

Felix's expression darkened. "Who sent you?"

The woman stumbled back, frightened.

Without another word, he turned and dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"Boss Ethan, where are you?"

"Airport."

Felix's eyes lit up. "Going to see Patrick Alpinus?"

A brief silence followed.

"Flight's delayed by an hour," Ethan replied coolly.

Felix immediately spun his car around.

He sped through the streets, pulling strings to secure a last-minute seat on the same flight.

When he found his seat, Ethan was resting with his eyes closed.

"Boss Ethan," Felix whispered, "why the sudden trip?"

Ethan opened his eyes, his sharp gaze sweeping over him. "I should be asking you that."

Felix reeked of alcohol, his tie hanging loosely around his neck.

"I... just felt like taking a spontaneous vacation."

Ethan gave him a knowing look but didn't press further.

The plane began taxiing toward the runway.

Gazing out at the dark night sky, Felix allowed a faint smile to curl his lips.

This was nothing short of divine intervention.
###Chapter 979

Felix fell silent.

He stammered for a long moment before finally muttering, "I was just passing by."

Ethan's sharp gaze pierced through him. "To see who? Patrick or someone else?"

"Just... looking around." Felix scratched his head. "Fine, assume I went to see Patrick. No—assume I came to keep you company."

He grew more animated. "You'd be bored alone. It's livelier with me around."

Ethan scoffed. "I'm not bored."

His tone shifted. "Are you hiding something from me? What did Vivian want with Patrick? I heard she met Annika too?"

Felix's eyes widened. "What? She saw Annika?"

His stomach dropped.

Dr. Laurent had explicitly told him to keep this from Ethan.

"I don't know anything," Felix said quickly, waving his hands.

Ethan massaged his temples. "Then what do you know?"

"I promised Dr. Laurent I wouldn't tell."

Ethan snorted. "Patrick already said Vivian is with him now."

Felix relented. "She just asked for Patrick's number."

He hesitated. "When I asked why she didn't go to you directly, she said you couldn't know."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

Why wouldn't Vivian come to him?

"Isabella called me tonight," Felix blurted suddenly. "She never reaches out first."

Ethan gave him a knowing look. "I thought you didn't like Isabella."

"W-who said I went for her?" Felix stammered. "I was visiting Patrick!"

Ethan didn't bother calling him out.

With Victor's recent scheming, he had enough headaches already.

He hadn't seen Vivian in days.

"Boss Ethan," Felix suddenly asked, "why didn't you tell me you're going to be a dad?"

"Why would I?" Ethan said flatly. "It's not your kid."

Felix clutched his chest dramatically. "We're like brothers!"

His eyes lit up. "Can I be the godfather?"

"The actual father isn't even settled yet," Ethan said coldly. "Vivian still wants the baby to call Lucas 'Dad.'"

The thought made his blood boil.

"When's the due date?" Felix asked eagerly.

"Two months."

"So soon?" Felix groaned. "My parents are going to start nagging me about marriage!"

Ethan rolled his eyes. "Not my problem."
###Chapter 980

Felix Valdemar thought he could walk side by side with Ethan Roscente.

But the man suddenly accelerated, leaving Felix far behind.

They only exchanged a few pleasantries before the plane took off.

After the long flight, they finally arrived at their destination.

The time difference turned night into day. Stars now filled the sky outside the window.

Vivian Laurent had napped earlier and felt refreshed. She ordered room service before knocking on Isabella Langley's door.

The door swung open, revealing Isabella's displeased expression.

"Who dared upset our precious Isabella?" Vivian teased, pulling her toward the dining table.

"It's that bastard Felix!" Isabella gritted her teeth. "Flirting with girls in the middle of the night!"

Vivian handed her cutlery, eyes twinkling with mischief. "Why do you care if he's chasing skirts?"

Isabella paused mid-bite. Why was she so bothered?

"All men are trash!" She stabbed angrily at her food.

Vivian chuckled. "Lucas Lefèvre is decent. Doesn't smoke or drink, and he's even-tempered."

At the mention of Lucas, Isabella's tone softened. "True. Whoever marries him will be lucky."

"So why does Felix's behavior upset you?" Vivian pivoted sharply.

Isabella nearly choked. "I'm not upset!"

Vivian pulled out her phone, displaying a stranger's photo. "Know him?"

Isabella shook her head.

"Notorious playboy. Cheated on his pregnant wife with countless mistresses." Vivian's voice remained calm.

"Scum!" Isabella spat, then resumed eating indifferently.

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Not even mad about that level of trashiness?"

"Why should I care?" Isabella shrugged.

Vivian pocketed her phone with a knowing look. "Strangers can be scum and you don't bat an eye, but Felix flirts and you explode. Isabella, you're jealous."

Isabella's ears burned. "Don't be ridiculous! I just think he's unreliable."

"You're not marrying him," Vivian blinked, "so why does his reliability matter?"

Isabella had no retort.
###Chapter 981

Isabella's chopsticks poked absently at her food.

The meal suddenly lost all its appeal.

"You're right. It's none of my business." She shoved a piece of meat into her mouth but tasted nothing.

A heavy weight pressed against her chest.

What was that bastard doing right now?

Probably wrapped around some other woman...

"Vivian, you're not eating either?" She looked up at her friend across the table.

Vivian forced down a mouthful of rice. "Still adjusting to the time difference."

They lapsed into silence.

Only the clinking of cutlery filled the dining room.

The dishes remained largely untouched.

"Ding—"

Vivian's phone suddenly chimed.

Emily's smiling face appeared on the screen.

"Vivian! Where are you guys?" The girl's cheerful voice rang out.

Vivian adjusted her expression. "We're handling some business overseas."

"I'm coming too!" Emily's eyes lit up. "I'll book a flight right now!"

The call ended before Vivian could respond.

Isabella shook her head. "That girl..."

The doorbell chose that moment to ring.

Both women froze.

"It can't be..."

Vivian approached the door. Her fingers tightened around the handle when she saw through the peephole.

The moment the door opened, Ethan pulled her into a crushing embrace.

"Vivian."

His voice trembled noticeably.

Felix stood behind him, looking sheepish. "They dragged me along!"

Isabella's chopsticks clattered to the floor.

"Felix?!"

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Felix bristled. "Isabella! Say that again, I dare you!"

Vivian struggled in Ethan's arms. "Let go... I can't breathe..."

He loosened his grip slightly but refused to release her completely.

Isabella's gaze swept over Felix.

So much for being in another woman's bed.

The weight in her chest suddenly lifted.
###Chapter 982

"Who invited you here? You're not welcome!" Isabella crossed her arms, her eyes filled with disdain.

Felix walked right past her, his gaze locking onto Vivian. "Dr. Laurent, be the judge. Is this attitude appropriate?"

He secretly sighed in relief. That strange phone call from Isabella earlier had made him think something serious happened.

"My attitude?" Isabella scoffed. "Some people really lack self-awareness."

"What did I do?"

"Get lost, player!" She pointed at the door. "Don't dirty Vivian's place."

Felix looked genuinely confused. "Since when am I a player?"

"Stop pretending! Didn't some girl call you 'Brother Felix' all sweetly this afternoon?" Isabella wrinkled her nose in disgust. "Coming straight here after rolling out of some woman's bed? Disgusting."

"That was a business meeting!" Felix pulled out his phone. "I'll send you the club address. Check the surveillance yourself. If there's no evidence, you'll have to call me 'Brother Felix, I was wrong' in front of everyone."

"In your dreams!" Isabella's tone was defiant, but doubt crept into her mind. Could this really be a misunderstanding?

Vivian peeked out from Ethan's embrace. "Isabella, it might really be a misunderstanding. Felix isn't that kind of man."

Felix's eyes lit up. "Dr. Laurent understands. Maybe I should start calling you Sister Viv too?"

Vivian massaged her temples. "Felix, you're several years older than me."

"Age doesn't matter." Felix said seriously. "'Sister Viv' is a title of respect. If you take me under your wing, this tigress won't dare bully me anymore."

"Who are you calling a tigress?!" Isabella bristled.

"The shoe fits." Felix raised an eyebrow.

As their argument threatened to escalate again, Vivian gave Ethan a helpless look.

"Let them bicker." Ethan tightened his arm around her shoulders. "We can talk privately."

"Did you finish handling your company matters?" Vivian looked up at him. He'd arrived much sooner than expected.

"No." Ethan lowered his head, his warm breath brushing her ear. "But wanting to see you overpowered everything else."

The tips of Vivian's ears instantly turned pink.
###Chapter 983

Vivian's breath hitched.

Her heart pounded violently against her ribs, threatening to break free.

Ethan's feelings had come so suddenly, yet with such cautious tenderness.

If it were her, she would never abandon work and fly across continents for anyone.

But Ethan had come.

"Did...you eat?" she finally managed after a long pause.

"Just something quick on the plane."

"There's leftover room service if you and Felix are hungry. I can heat it up." She hesitated. "Though it's really not great."

Ethan's brows immediately furrowed.

"You haven't been eating properly?"

"I had a little," she murmured in defense.

Ethan was already unbuttoning his suit jacket.

"I'll have ingredients delivered. I'll cook for you."

Vivian quickly stopped him.

"It's too late for that. Besides, I'm not hungry."

Ethan's gaze was unyielding.

"You need to eat."

"I really don't want to!"

"For the baby, then."

Vivian sighed.

"Fine. Heat up the leftovers, and I'll have a few bites with you. I'm too tired to wait for you to cook."

A small lie.

Only then did Ethan relent, turning toward the kitchen.

Isabella immediately sidled up to her.

"Viv, you've got him wrapped around your finger," she whispered. "Who would've thought Mr. Roscente would cook for you?"

Vivian rolled her eyes.

"He offered."

"I know." Isabella clicked her tongue. "Anyone else wouldn't even get a glass of water from him. Is this really the same arrogant Ethan Roscente?"

She shook her head, watching his tall figure move in the kitchen.

Such was the magic of love.
###Chapter 984
Double Standards

Felix Valdemar leaned over the dining table, eyes gleaming at the freshly reheated dishes Ethan Roscente had prepared. He pulled out his phone and snapped several photos of the spread.

"Gotta document this rare occasion when Boss Ethan cooks," Felix grinned. "If he ever pisses me off, I'm sending these to everyone in our circle."

Vivian Laurent blinked. She'd grown accustomed to seeing Ethan bustling around the kitchen, especially after he'd mastered cooking.

Watching Felix take pictures, Vivian quietly pulled out her own phone and captured Ethan's tall, well-proportioned silhouette.

Even from behind, his long legs and perfect physique were mesmerizing.

Isabella Langley scoffed. "You're one to talk. Look at Ethan—now that's what a proper man looks like. Meanwhile, you can't even make instant noodles right."

"What's wrong with me?" Felix retorted. "I'm doing just fine."

"Only because you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth," Isabella shot back. "Without servants, you'd have starved ages ago."

Felix shrugged. "Being born lucky is a skill too."

Ethan emerged with the final dish and gestured for everyone to eat.

Isabella eyed the feast without appetite—she and Vivian had just finished dinner. But when she turned, Vivian was already seated at the table, chopsticks in hand.

Pregnancy cravings were understandable.

Ethan suddenly extended his palm. "Phone."

Confused, Felix handed it over.

Ethan swiftly deleted the photos before tossing the device back. "One more unauthorized shot and I'll sue for肖像权violation."

"That was out in the open!" Felix protested. "Besides, Vivian took pictures too!"

Vivian's chopsticks stilled.

Ethan's eyes flickered with surprise. "You did?"

"Just one," she murmured, ready to delete it.

Instead of anger, Ethan's voice softened. "Take as many as you like. Tell me how you want me to pose."

"Such double standards!" Felix gaped.

Ethan arched a brow. "Got a problem with that?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Let the lovebirds do what they want. Finish up and get lost—we need rest."

Vivian took a bite, surprised by the improved flavor. Had Ethan tweaked the dishes?

After dinner, Ethan moved to clear the table.

Vivian stopped him. "It's late. Let housekeeping handle it tomorrow. Aren't you exhausted?"

"Dead tired!" Felix cut in. "Boss Ethan didn't sleep the entire flight—just worked on documents."

"Where are you staying?" Vivian asked.

Ethan paused. They hadn't booked hotels—or rather, he'd never planned to stay elsewhere.
###Chapter 985

Ethan Roscente lied without blinking. "The hotel is fully booked."

Felix Valdemar's eyes widened. "When did you check? Where am I supposed to stay?"

"Flying for over ten hours exhausted me." Ethan massaged his temples. "Vivian, let's share the room tonight."

Vivian Laurent's lips twitched.

This man was absolutely doing this on purpose!

Felix jumped up. "What about me? You expect me to bunk with Isabella?"

"Dream on!" Isabella Langley hurled a throw pillow at him. "I'll break your legs if you touch my bed!"

"Like I'd want to! I wouldn't take you even if you paid me!"

Vivian was about to refuse when she noticed the dark circles under Ethan's eyes.

She sighed. "You rest first. I'm not tired yet."

Ethan scooped her up bridal-style. "We'll sleep together."

"Ethan!" Vivian struggled in his arms. "You're getting bolder by the day!"

Felix groaned. "What about me? Isabella won't take me in!"

"The sofa's yours." Ethan didn't even glance back.

The suite's couch was indeed spacious.

"Guess this'll do." Felix collapsed onto it. The plane noise had kept him awake the entire flight.

Isabella snorted and retreated to her room.

Felix fell asleep instantly, dead to the world.

Inside the bedroom, Ethan deposited Vivian onto the bed.

"I'm taking a shower."

As water ran in the bathroom, Vivian pinched her cheek.

Not a dream.

He'd really come.

The water stopped.

Ethan emerged with only a towel around his waist.

Droplets trailed down his abs, his Adonis belt faintly visible.

Vivian's face burned crimson.

"You're naked!"

Water dripped from his hair onto his collarbone, unbearably sensual.

Even after having a child together, she still couldn't handle him.

As a doctor, she'd seen countless naked bodies.

Only his made her weak.

Ethan shook his damp hair innocently. "Came in a hurry. Didn't pack spare clothes."

"What about tomorrow?" Vivian covered her eyes. "You can't stay like this!"

She was about to refuse sharing the bed when Ethan pulled back the covers.

"My assistant will bring clothes tomorrow." He lay down. "We'll make do tonight."
###Chapter 986

"Who said I wanted your sacrifice? I've changed my mind—go sleep on Felix's couch!" Vivian turned her face away, deliberately avoiding Ethan's dangerously attractive physique.

Ethan deliberately moved closer, his deep voice laced with amusement. "Vivian, are you blushing?"

"Who's blushing? I've seen more male models than you can imagine, many with better bodies than yours!"

"Oh?" Ethan chuckled instead of taking offense. "Which models have you seen, Vivian?"

Rather than being angry, he proudly flexed his sculpted torso.

Vivian was so irritated she wanted to smack him away. Instead, she yanked the blanket over herself, cocooning tightly.

Moments later, she felt the mattress dip as Ethan slid under the covers, his warm body pressing against hers.

"You didn't even dry your hair before getting into bed?" Vivian abruptly threw the blanket off.

"Didn't want the hair dryer to disturb you."

"I napped this afternoon—I'm wide awake now. Go dry your hair immediately. Don't get my pillow wet."

"If it gets wet, I'll replace it tomorrow."

"Do it now!"

A glint of amusement flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Vivian, are you worried about me?"

"I'm worried about the pil—"

Before she could finish, Ethan closed the distance, capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

Vivian's eyes widened, staring at his devastatingly perfect face up close.

The fresh mint from his toothpaste lingered between them as the kiss deepened—dominant yet tender, making her instinctively shiver.

Ethan cradled the back of her head with one hand while the other traced slow circles along her waist. A tingling sensation shot through her, and she tried to pull away, only to be held tighter in his arms.

When they finally broke apart, both were breathless.

Ethan reluctantly released her, his gaze darkening as he took in her flushed cheeks, swollen lips, and dazed eyes. He swallowed hard, forcing down his rising desire.

"Vivian," he murmured hoarsely, "why did you suddenly visit Annika? Was it about Liam?"

Vivian stiffened, surprised he had guessed so accurately.
###Chapter 987

One Less Rival

Vivian Laurent met Ethan Roscente's gaze squarely. "Yes," she answered crisply.

She had no intention of hiding the truth.

"Annika told me many things." Vivian paused. "Ethan... perhaps you were right."

A flicker of dazed regret crossed her eyes.

"Zero approached me with an agenda from the very beginning." Her fingers clenched unconsciously. "He's long ceased to be the person I remembered."

Ethan listened in silence.

Though bitterness churned in his chest, he didn't interrupt. This was the first time she'd truly opened up to him.

"When we first met, he was still young." Her voice carried the warmth of memory. "Back then, there was still light in his eyes."

Ethan exhaled inwardly.

Zero—his romantic rival—was officially out of the picture.

Vivian continued recounting stories even Isabella Langley had never heard.

"That organization—" Her voice suddenly tightened. "It was hell on earth."

Childhood images flashed through her mind—the frigid training grounds, bloodstained floors, the desperate wails of children.

"The only way to survive was to step over others' corpses." Her fingertips trembled slightly.

Ethan grasped her hand.

Warmth spread from their joined palms.

"I want to destroy that place." Vivian looked up abruptly, her gaze steely.

Her eyes burned with conviction.

"Now that I'm carrying our child, I understand even more..." She caressed her abdomen gently. "Every child deserves a happy childhood."

Ethan studied her stubborn profile.

He knew he couldn't stop her.

"I'll go with you," Ethan declared resolutely.

Vivian froze.

"If you want to blow up the Dark Web, I'll hand you the explosives myself." The corner of his mouth quirked, but his eyes remained deadly serious.

It was his promise.

And his way of loving her.
###Chapter 988

Ethan's tenderness was impossible for Vivian to resist.

She had always believed herself strong enough. Accustomed to walking alone with support from friends like Isabella and Lucas, she now realized how beautiful it felt to have someone by her side.

Burying her face against Ethan's chest, she listened to his steady heartbeat. Their hearts beat so close together that even their breaths synchronized.

"How did you figure out about Liam?" Vivian whispered.

"Instinct." Ethan tightened his embrace. "The way he looked at you made me uneasy. Knowing he met you before I did drove me mad with jealousy. Thankfully, I'm the one standing with you now."

Vivian chuckled, lightly patting his cheek. "I asked about Liam, and here you are praising yourself."

Her fingertips traced the contours of his face, from brow to jawline, each feature etching itself into her memory.

"Why mention him?" Ethan caught her hand. "Anyone who dares bully my wife isn't worth our breath."

"Who's your wife!" Vivian's ears burned crimson.

Though married three years, they'd never used such intimate terms before. Their past distance now felt like a dream.

"You are now, and always will be." Ethan's voice held certainty. "Actually, I should thank Liam."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "For what?"

"If he hadn't forced you to take that final mission, we'd never have met. You'd never have fallen for me at first sight."

"Ethan!" Vivian pinched his cheek. "Have you no shame?"

"Am I wrong?" He leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. "You've always liked me. Vivian, I like you too."

The sudden confession made her heart skip.

"The Ethan I knew was an unattainable flower." She turned away. "Since when did you become so smooth-talking?"

"Only for you." His low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "Besides, when have I ever been smooth? Get to know me better—you'll find I have many virtues."

He seized the opportunity for self-promotion. After Vivian's mention of scoring him, he intended to impress.

"I don't want to." Vivian pouted. "You're nothing but flaws."

"At least this face isn't bad?" Ethan deliberately moved closer. "Keep looking—it might earn me points."

Never had he imagined relying on his looks to please her. Yet if it meant holding her gaze longer, he'd gladly do so.
###Chapter 989

"I'm tired of looking at your face!"

"Then what kind do you prefer? I'll get plastic surgery." Ethan Roscente leaned closer, mischief dancing in his eyes.

Vivian Laurent arched an eyebrow. "I like pig heads. Would you get that done too?"

"That sounds tedious." Ethan caught her hand and pressed it against his cheek. "Just hit me instead. You can see a pig head whenever you want. The swelling goes down, and it's reusable."

Vivian burst into laughter.

She'd never seen this side of Ethan before. When had the cold, aloof man learned to joke like this?

"Confess. Where did you learn these sweet-talking skills?"

"Hmm?" Ethan blinked innocently.

"Tell me! Have you used these lines on someone else before?"

"That's slander!" Ethan immediately raised his hand in oath. "There's no one else but you in my eyes. If I'm lying, may lightning strike me!"

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead, terrified she'd bring up Sophia Evans again.

"Relax, I was just teasing." Vivian poked his forehead.

Ethan pulled her into his embrace, resting his chin atop her head. "Vivian, let's stop doubting each other. If we'd just talked sooner, we wouldn't have wasted so much time."

His voice grew muffled. "Like this time—you went to see Patrick Alpinus without telling me."

"I didn't want to interrupt your work."

"You're more important than anything." His arms tightened around her.

Vivian's ears burned. A simple embrace left her throat parched.

"Get me some water." She nudged him.

Ethan rose immediately. He started toward the door shirtless until Vivian grabbed him.

"Put on a robe! What if you run into Isabella? How embarrassing."

Ethan obediently slipped into a bathrobe. Only Felix Valdemar slept in the living room, snoring thunderously.

When he returned with water, Vivian curled against the headboard. The warm lamplight caught her delicate sips, making her resemble a lazy cat.

Ethan's throat moved. Suddenly, he felt desperately thirsty too.
###Chapter 990

"Vivian, I'm thirsty too." Ethan Roscente's deep voice cut through the darkness with startling clarity.

Vivian Laurent handed him the water glass. "Get your own water. And take my cup out while you're at it."

Her lips still glistened from her recent drink, catching the warm glow of the bedside lamp in a way that made his throat tighten.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

Without warning, he leaned in to capture that lingering moisture. His tongue demanded entry past her lips with practiced ease, yet carefully avoided any pressure against her rounded belly.

Eight months along.

Restraint was necessary now. After the baby came, after Vivian recovered—they'd have all the time in the world. But tonight, even this chaste contact sent his pulse racing.

"Mmm...Ethan—" Vivian gasped against his mouth.

She could feel the leashed desire thrumming through him like a caged predator. The arms encircling her trembled with tension, yet maintained perfect control.

A sudden apprehension about postpartum life flickered through her mind.

Somehow her arms had wound around his neck. The kiss deepened, stretched—until her lips tingled with delicious numbness.

When they finally parted, her eyes shone with the dazed vulnerability of a startled doe.

Ethan abruptly covered her eyes with one hand.

"Sleep." The word emerged roughened beyond recognition.

They settled together beneath the covers. His chin rested lightly against her hair, breathing in the subtle fragrance of her shampoo.

Guilt pricked at Vivian. She'd kept him talking so late, and he had an early meeting tomorrow.

"Ethan." Her whisper feathered against his chest.

A drowsy hum vibrated through him in response.

Vivian fisted the fabric of his pajama top. "Goodnight."

His entire body stiffened for one telling instant.

The first time she'd ever said those words to him. Two simple syllables that burned through his ribcage.

"Goodnight, Vivian." His arms tightened possessively, laughter threading through the words. "Sweet dreams."

In the darkness, his smile remained unshakable.
###Chapter 991

Vivian Laurent woke from her nap with unusual clarity, unable to recall when she'd drifted off.

She only remembered staying up late talking with Ethan Roscente until she noticed exhaustion lining his brow and bid him goodnight.

Morning light filtered through the sheer curtains when she realized Ethan still held her tightly against him.

His breathing remained steady, lashes resting against his cheeks in deep slumber.

The dark circles beneath his eyes made her chest tighten. Between corporate burdens and caring for her, even the strongest man would wear thin.

Sunlight sculpted Ethan's features with striking definition, maturity only enhancing his arresting presence.

Memories of last night's searing kisses surfaced as her fingers ghosted over the elegant curve of his lips.

Those same lips that claimed hers with breathtaking dominance.

Just as she lost herself in thought, warm lips captured her wandering finger.

She jerked back instinctively, but Ethan's grip tightened around her wrist.

Her gaze collided with his sleep-heavy eyes.

"Go back to sleep," she feigned composure.

Ethan hadn't slept enough. After their farewell last night, he'd tossed restlessly until dawn.

"A mischievous kitten started playing with me," his voice rasped with sleep. "Should teach her a lesson."

Heat flooded from Vivian's ears down her neck.

For all her worldly experience, Ethan reduced her to blushing helplessness with just one smoldering look.

"You wouldn't dare," she challenged weakly.

His low chuckle vibrated against her skin. "Of course not. Why don't you explore further?" A deliberate pause. "Where else would you like to touch?"

"Pervert!" She swatted his chest.

"I meant my face or hands." He blinked innocently before whispering against her ear, "Unless... you had more intimate places in mind?"
###Chapter 992

"You're overcomplicating things. I wasn't thinking anything. Time to get up!"

Vivian's cheeks flushed pink. She could never win a verbal sparring match against Ethan.

She quickly rose and hurried toward the bathroom.

Hotels weren't like home. Changing clothes here was always inconvenient.

Ethan's clothes were still with Patrick and hadn't been delivered yet.

While Vivian changed, he called Patrick. "Where are you? I'm waiting here completely exposed."

Two seconds of silence passed.

"How is that my fault?" Patrick sounded exasperated. "You didn't pack spare clothes for your business trip. I'm doing you a favor by running this errand."

"Less talking, more moving," Ethan urged.

Patrick chuckled. "What's the rush? I thought you'd be eager to show off your physique to Dr. Laurent."

"I wouldn't mind," Ethan glanced toward the bathroom, "but she's not giving me the opportunity."

The call ended just as Vivian emerged, dressed and avoiding Ethan's gaze as she walked straight to the living room.

Felix was rubbing sleep from his eyes on the couch. "Morning, Dr. Laurent," he yawned.

"Morning." Vivian nodded, checking her phone.

A message from Emily popped up: Boarded the plane.

Vivian raised an eyebrow. The girl worked fast.

She quickly replied with the hotel address, noting she'd arrange for pickup.

The doorbell rang as she sent the message.

Patrick stood outside holding two paper bags—clothes and breakfast.

"Thanks." Vivian took the food.

Patrick placed the clothes by the bathroom door where water was running. "Thought you were in a hurry to get dressed?" He knocked on the frosted glass.

"Almost done," Ethan's voice carried over the shower sounds.

By the time Ethan finished and joined them, everyone was seated at the dining table.

Patrick looked at Felix. "Couldn't give me a heads-up about your sudden arrival?"

"Last-minute decision." Felix shrugged. "Didn't Boss Ethan tell you?"

Patrick nodded, then turned to Vivian. "Any plans today?"

Vivian shook her head. "Already met the person I came to see."

She set down her chopsticks and met Patrick's gaze. "But do you have time to talk, Inspector Alpinus?"

Patrick's eyes lit up. "I'm all yours."

This was exactly why he'd come. Collaborating with "Shadow" would be a major breakthrough in taking down the DarkKingdom organization.

The elusive crime syndicate had evaded justice for years. Now, finally, an opportunity had arrived.
###Chapter 993

Only five people remained in the room.

Felix Valdemar rubbed his eyes, gazing at the others with confusion.

Ethan Roscente and Isabella Langley exchanged a glance.

Vivian Laurent's eyes lingered on Felix, her lips parting slightly before closing again.

"Felix, are you tired?" Ethan suddenly asked.

Felix immediately became alert. "Boss Ethan, you're not trying to get rid of me, are you?"

Isabella scoffed. "We're discussing confidential matters. Should you really be here?"

"What secrets can't I hear?" Felix stomped his foot impatiently. "Dr. Laurent, I swear I won't breathe a word!"

Ethan sighed. "Vivian, he's been with me since childhood. He's trustworthy."

Felix raised three fingers. "I swear! If I leak anything, may lightning strike me!"

Vivian gave a slight nod.

Her gaze shifted to Patrick Alpinus.

"The answer to yesterday's question is yes." Vivian's voice was barely above a whisper.

Felix looked baffled. "What question?"

Isabella glared at him. "Shut up!"

Patrick's breathing noticeably quickened.

Though he'd suspected as much, hearing it confirmed still shocked him.

"Would you like to know what Annika and I discussed?" Vivian continued.

Patrick's Adam's apple bobbed. "May I?"

"I approached you for cooperation in the first place," Vivian said calmly.

Patrick instinctively leaned forward.

Ethan yanked him back by the collar. "Keep your distance!"

"I just wanted to hear better—" Patrick protested.

"Need me to repeat it for you?" Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Having trouble with your hearing?"

Patrick reluctantly straightened up.

He stole a glance at how protectively Ethan hovered near Vivian.

If the day ever came when he had to take Vivian away...

Patrick didn't dare finish the thought.

"Sit properly!" Ethan warned again.

His gaze remained fixed on Vivian's slightly rounded abdomen.
###Chapter 994

Patrick Alpinus had reached the limit of his patience. He couldn't wait another second to uncover the truth, even putting aside his rivalry with Ethan Roscente for now.

"Ms. Laurent, please continue," he urged.

Vivian Laurent took a sip of tea before speaking. "I went to see Annika for one reason—to confirm whether Zero truly wanted me dead."

Patrick's pupils constricted sharply. "Zero wants to kill you? That's impossible."

In his understanding, Zero and Shadow were the most seamless duo in the intelligence world, with a flawless track record. Some even whispered they were lovers.

Vivian's lips curled into a cold smile. "See? Even you don't believe it."

"That's not what I meant..." Patrick frowned. "But why would he do this?"

"That's exactly what I want to know." Her gaze turned icy. "Zero claims ignorance about Annika's actions, but she confessed he ordered it. And..."

She paused. "He already poisoned me once when I was abroad. By the way, you've actually met Zero before—during your vacation in Canada."

A memory flashed through Patrick's mind—the man standing beside Vivian at that bar. He'd introduced himself as Liam Valdemar?

He sucked in a sharp breath. The truth had been right under his nose all along.

"Don't blame yourself." Vivian saw right through him. "Even if you'd known his identity then, you couldn't have captured him. His skills...you're no match for him, not even ten of you."

Patrick's face darkened. Harsh, but true.

"So that prison break on the Dark Web..." He suddenly connected the dots.

"Was my doing." Vivian admitted freely. "But I gave you the coordinates. You arrested plenty of people—call it even."

Patrick gave a bitter laugh and raised his thumb. "Impressive."

Ethan Roscente's lips quirked upward unconsciously, as if the praise had been directed at him.

Felix Valdemar looked utterly lost, but Isabella Langley silenced him with a single glance.

Vivian continued, "Zero has wanted me dead for a long time. Sophia Evans' death, Bianca Semona's parents, Sophia Sherwood—he's behind them all. He'll keep killing unless..."

Patrick nodded in understanding. "You want to team up to capture Zero. But capture alone isn't enough—we need irrefutable evidence to eliminate him permanently."

His fists clenched, battle flames igniting in his eyes. This time, he wouldn't let the criminal escape justice.
###Chapter 995

Vivian Laurent gave a slight nod, her gaze resolute.

Patrick Alpinus tapped the table with his slender fingers. "This requires meticulous planning. How much intel do you have on DarkKingdom?"

He needed to eliminate not just the threat of Zero, but to dismantle the entire DarkKingdom organization. Vivian's assistance was crucial.

She shared all the intelligence she'd gathered. Patrick understood they must proceed with caution to avoid alerting their targets.

After over an hour of intense discussion, they finalized a preliminary strategy.

Felix Valdemar stood dumbfounded nearby. He finally grasped that this seemingly delicate woman wasn't just a top surgeon and racecar driver—she was also the legendary agent who struck fear into criminals' hearts.

No wonder Isabella Langley was equally formidable. Anyone who could stand beside Vivian Laurent was clearly extraordinary.

The realization that Ethan Roscente could handle such a woman made Felix silently tip his hat in respect.

Isabella waved a hand before his glazed eyes. "Earth to Felix!"

He snapped out of his daze, regarding Vivian with newfound reverence.

"Dr. Laurent—no, Ms. Laurent!" He stepped forward eagerly. "Are you still taking apprentices? I swear I'm sharper than Finn Deross!"

Vivian smiled faintly. "Not currently." Her gaze slid meaningfully toward Isabella. "But you could ask her."

Felix immediately recoiled. "Hard pass."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Apprenticing under you would be suicide."

"Only if you ask for trouble," she retorted. "Which you inevitably do."

Felix pouted, turning back to Vivian with undisguised admiration. What a shame to miss this opportunity.

Vivian checked her watch. Emily Garnache should be arriving soon.

"Let's have lunch together. My friend should be here shortly."

Felix thumped his chest. "My treat—order whatever you want!"

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Viv, let's bankrupt him!"

"With your appetite?" Felix scoffed. "You couldn't dent my wallet with an army behind you."

Patrick interjected, "This area isn't safe. How long are you staying?"

Vivian remained composed. "Two days max, then we're returning. Ethan, you can head back first if work demands it."

Ethan clasped her hand. "Everything's arranged."

Vivian checked her phone. Emily had texted about landing thirty minutes ago but hadn't arrived. The call went straight to voicemail.

"Strange..."

She should've been here by now. Another hour passed with no sign of her.

Vivian frowned. This wasn't like Emily—she never disappeared without explanation.
###Chapter 996

Vivian's heart dropped.

Her finger hovered over the phone screen as a growing sense of dread tightened in her chest.

Emily Garnache was the treasured heiress of the Garnache Group. If anything happened to her, how could Vivian face Mr. Garnache?

She dialed Emily's number again.

Still no answer.

"Uncle Li, did you pick her up?" She switched to calling the driver.

"I've called over a dozen times with no response," the driver said, puzzled. "I assumed Miss Garnache was still collecting her luggage."

Vivian's grip on the phone tightened.

Emily hadn't been picked up.

A living, breathing person had vanished into thin air at the airport?

"Something's wrong." Her voice turned tense.

Ethan Roscente immediately noticed the shift. "Emily's missing?"

"She's not responding." Vivian rapidly swiped through her phone. "The driver never saw her."

Isabella Langley frowned. "With this many people at the airport, where could she have gone?"

"Start investigating." Vivian's fingers flew across the screen.

Patrick Alpinus understood instantly. "I'll pull the surveillance footage. Get a team ready."

Patrick already had his radio out. "We'll need her photo and last known location."

A red dot suddenly blinked on Vivian's screen.

"Got a location," she said, eyes locked on the display. "Her phone signal stopped at the west parking lot. It hasn't moved."

"Airport security requires clearance for surveillance access—" Patrick began explaining the protocol.

Vivian already had the live feed pulled up.

Patrick's eyes widened.

This was high-definition footage only accessible through the airport's internal system.

Ethan chuckled. "Forgot to mention—she's Queen."

"What?" Patrick nearly bit his tongue.

The same Queen who'd hacked into the police database and left a taunt about their pathetic firewall?

The legendary cyber phantom who'd sent entire cybersecurity departments into panic?

And now he was being told this delicate-looking girl was that infamous digital wraith?

Patrick felt his worldview shatter.

"Found her." Vivian froze the footage.

The timestamp showed Emily walking alone toward the parking lot an hour ago.

And trailing behind her—the faint silhouette of a figure in a baseball cap.
###Chapter 997

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes, savoring Patrick Alpinus's shocked expression. It reminded him of his own reaction when he first discovered Vivian Laurent's multiple identities.

"You...you're Queen?" Patrick's voice trembled.

Felix Valdemar scratched his head in confusion. "Who's Queen? Is she famous?"

"Of course my Viv is amazing!" Isabella Langley lifted her chin proudly.

"Nobody was complimenting you. Why are you so smug?"

"Praising Viv makes me happier than praising myself!" Isabella rolled her eyes. "Felix, you should feel honored to even know us. Countless people would kill for a chance to meet Viv."

For once, Felix didn't argue back. Anyone who could impress Ethan Roscente and shock Patrick Alpinus was undoubtedly extraordinary.

"Check the surveillance first." Patrick quickly regained his composure. "I've already dispatched teams to search. Don't worry, Ms. Laurent. Your friend is my friend too."

"Thank you." Vivian took the tablet, her fingers trembling slightly. "She means everything to me."

The footage clearly showed Emily Garnache retrieving her luggage and walking alone toward the parking lot. Suddenly, several shadowy figures rushed out, covering her mouth and dragging her into a vehicle. The entire abduction took less than ten seconds.

"This is outrageous!" Isabella slammed the table. "A broad daylight kidnapping?"

"This area has always had security issues." Patrick frowned. "They must've targeted lone travelers. I have some leads—leave this to me."

He strode out briskly.

Vivian stood abruptly. "I'm coming too!"

Ethan gripped her shoulder firmly. "Don't act rashly. You're unfamiliar with this place—you'll only complicate things."

"But Emily got kidnapped because of me—"

"Trust Patrick." Ethan's voice remained steady. "Your expertise is in digital tracking. Assist with the investigation. I have connections here too—we'll provide full support."

Vivian clenched her fists. Ethan was right. Staying calm was her best course of action now.

"Please be safe..." she prayed silently in her heart.
###Chapter 998

The phone's GPS showed Emily Garnache's location near the airport.
They had clearly thrown her phone on the roadside intentionally.

Inside the car, Emily remained unconscious.
She curled up in the backseat, her face pale.

A thug with a pockmarked face toyed with an exquisite watch.
"Know how much this is worth?" He grinned.

His lackeys exchanged glances.
"Boss, how much could some cheap watch be worth?"

"Vacheron Constantin Malte Limited Edition. At least two million." The man waved the watch smugly.
His men gasped.

"This girl's covered in luxury goods." His greedy eyes roamed over Emily's unconscious form.
"Just this necklace could feed us for three years."

The car headed toward a secluded estate in the suburbs.
The compound was heavily guarded, with sentries at every corner.

A bucket of ice water splashed onto Emily's face.
The freezing shock jolted her awake.

A splitting headache made her vision blur.
She found herself tightly bound to a chair.

A dozen hulking men stood before her.
Their leader, a scar-faced brute, stared at her with cold eyes.

Emily trembled violently.
"What...do you want?" Her voice cracked with fear.

The men leered openly.
Her soaked white blouse clung to her body.

"Nice figure." Someone whistled.
Several men stepped forward eagerly.

Emily spotted the guns at their waists.
Terror flooded through her.

"Get away!" She shrank back desperately.
"Don't touch me!"

Scar-face reached for her with a sinister grin.
Emily squeezed her eyes shut in despair.
###Chapter 999

"That voice is absolutely bewitching. Don't be scared, sweetheart. We'll make you feel real good soon."

"Get away from me! Don't touch me!" Emily Garnache's tears soaked through her clothes.

The leering faces made her stomach churn with disgust.

"How else are we gonna untie you if we don't get close? Look at that delicate skin. Your crying is breaking my heart."

The men's greedy eyes slithered over her body like venomous snakes.

Just as the most repulsive one reached to touch her face, a bald man barked, "Duke! Boss said hands off!"

Duke Massies sneered. "Victor's my own brother. What's wrong with having some fun?"

"Last time you raped that girl, we almost got caught!" The bald man gritted his teeth.

Duke reluctantly withdrew his hand. "Fine. We'll wait till we get the ransom. Then we'll all take turns with her. Maybe knock her up and bring home a rich wife!"

Emily trembled violently.

She'd never even held hands with a boy, let alone be defiled by these animals.

If they truly violated her, she'd rather bite off her own tongue!

"Don't cry, baby," Duke licked his lips. "Stick with me and you'll live like a queen."

The bald man warned again, "Duke!"

"What's your problem?" Duke exploded. "You want a piece too?"

The vulgar words pushed Emily to the brink of collapse.

She bit her lip until it bled.

Vivian would come for her.

The invincible Vivian Laurent would never abandon her to this nightmare.
###Chapter 1000

Scar Lowell's laughter cut off abruptly.

The crowd parted as a burly middle-aged man sauntered forward. A thick gold chain hung around his neck, a cigar pinched between his fingers.

"Boss!" the men chorused.

Duke Massies rubbed his hands together eagerly. "Look at this girl, boss. Not only is she loaded, but she's gorgeous too. After we get the ransom, can I—"

Smack!

Victor Lowell slapped the back of Duke's head. "Always thinking with your dick! That'll get you killed someday!"

Duke chuckled, rubbing his head. "Live fast, die young, right?"

Victor ignored him, narrowing his eyes at Emily Garnache. The Vacheron Constantin Malte Limited Edition on her wrist glinted coldly under the dim light.

"Name, girl." Victor exhaled a smoke ring. "Judging by that outfit, Daddy's got deep pockets. We only want money, not your life. Cooperate and—"

"My father's broke!" Emily's voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes.

She needed to stall. Vivian Laurent would come for her once she realized she was missing.

Duke suddenly leaned in, his scar twisting grotesquely in the light. "Broke? That watch costs over two million! And that purse is limited edition!"

Emily shrank back.

"Boss," Duke wheedled, "this brat's lying. Let me teach her some manners—"

"Get lost!" Victor kicked him aside, turning a cold smile on Emily. "Stalling? Daddy won't get here in time, and my boys won't be gentle."

Emily's mind raced. "I have millions in my account! Take it all—just let me go!"

"Millions?" Duke barked a laugh. "We want billions!"

"My family doesn't have that kind of money..." Emily's voice faded.

Raucous laughter erupted around them.

"Cops?" Victor sneered. "What are they gonna do?"

Emily swallowed her fear, clutching her stomach. "I...I'm starving. Can I eat first? I'll call for the ransom after—"

She needed time. Even a brief reprieve would give Vivian a chance to rescue her.
