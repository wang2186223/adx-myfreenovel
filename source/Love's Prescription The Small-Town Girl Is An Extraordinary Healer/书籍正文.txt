###Chapter 1 Shocking News


By the time March rolled around, Shoildon was buzzing with one jaw-dropping news afteranother.

Word spread first that Isaac Bennett-the eldest son of the city's wealthiest and most influential family-had been in a devastating car crash, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

Another shock followed quickly: the prestigious Bennett family had chosen to bind themselves to the newly risen Willis family/ through marriage.

The biggest stir came from the pairing itself-the groom, none other than the now-disabled Isaac, and the bride, the Willis family's eldest daughter, a young woman raised far from the city's refinement in an isolated rural backwater.

Miles away from the glittering skyline, Verena Willis, the name on everyone's lips, remained in Trisas, the rural place she'd always known.

The chime of an incoming message broke the silence of the modest living room where she sat.

One glance at the screen showed a message from her assistant.

The text read, "Evelyn, I've got a patient with an extremely rare case. They've been waiting for you for six months.When can you come take a look?"

The screen dimmed as Verena pressed the power button, her delicate fingers lingering over the device.In her clear eyes, sorrow flickered.

Around the world, people knew her as Evelyn Rowe-the miracle-working healer-but fame meant nothing when she couldn't save the person she loved most. Her grandmother had slipped away the moment she picked up her scalpel, unable to wait any longer.

From behind her came the muffled edge of her parents' voices, their quarrel leaking through the thin walls of the house. "Alec, the company is drowning in unfinished business, and Kaia's eighteenth birthday party is right around the corner. Tell me, which is more important-a pile of work and a major family celebration, or a dead person? Besides, we need Verena back in the city so she can learn proper manners. If she acts like some country hick girl after joining the Bennett family, it'll be the Willis name everyone laughs at!"
"Stop calling her a country hick girl. She's your daughter!"
"If she weren't my daughter, do you think I'd bother making the trip to fetch her?"
Verena stifled a small laugh as their bickering went on.

The two people arguing in the room were not strangers but her own parents, Alec Willis and Laura Willis.
Once,they had been ordinary employees, clawing their way up inch by inch until success finally came.
Back in those early years of scraping by, they had no time for a child, so her grandmother, Shawna Willis,had taken her in when she was only a month old.
Even with their hectic schedules, her parents had still managed to think of her now and then, sending word or a token of affectionwhen they could.
The change in their priorities began the moment their business took off and they launched their own company. At seven years old, Verena gained a younger sister, Kaia Willis, and from that day forward, her arents' interest in her began to fade. As the Willis fortune grew, they slid seamlessly into the ranks of high ociety.
aura would call from time to time, but her conversations were never about Verena's schooling or health.stead, she would go on about Kaia, the younger sister she called the family's lucky charm, as if Laura's ly mission was to brag about the child who supposedly brought them prosperity.
hor narents came back to Trisas for a visit. sunuori, Laura became pregnant again and gave birth to a son. From that point on, all of their attention went to Kaia and the boy. Money arrived regularly, but they themselves stayed away for fifteen years.
If Shawna hadn't passed away, Verena was certain her parents would have gone on ignoring them entirely.

···

Only after the funeral rites were done did Verena agree to travel to Shoildon with them.
They spoke warmly, as though eager to have her close, but she understood what was really at play. After all,it was easy enough to learn the news in Shoildon with a quick search online.

Laura broke the silence as they neared the Shoildon residence.

"Verena, keep in mind-if anyone asks about your education, you tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine with a master's degree and that you're about to start your internship..."
In her mind, Laura had never pictured Verena as anything more than a small-town clinic doctor.Trisas,after all, was nothing but a secluded mountain town in her eyes.
Since Verena had never attended college-or so she believed-Laura assumed she'd only picked up a few simple skills from the local medics.

The few comments she'd overheard from Shawna about Verena studying medicine had been enough for her o settle on that assumption.
corith's medicine program was ranked first in the country, and Laura had no qualms about using its name prop up her own image. Heaven forbid anyone discover that her eldest daughter's practice was in some ural backwater. That, she thought, would be humiliating.
erena sneered at Laura's vanity, knowing Laura had never cared to truly understand her. In all her life, Laura had never once asked about her education. Once, Verena missed two of the exams due
to illness, resulting in low scores. When Laura later learned her scores were low, she had concluded her daughter was unfit for higher learning.
Even when Shawna tried to tell them the good news of Verena's admission to a top-tier university,both parents brushed it aside, mentioning work matters before abruptly ending the call.
After that, Verena and Shawna stopped trying to share anything meaningful with them.
Verena looked Laura in the eye and said evenly, "I never studied at Acorith College of Medicine."
The bluntness made Laura's lips press together. In her eyes, Verena's refusal to play along wasn't strength -it was stubbornness.
Of course she knew Verena had never been a student there; that was the whole point of telling her to lie.Compared to Kaia, who might not match Verena's beauty but had achievements to show for herself, Verena was nothing but an embarrassment.
Before she could scold her, Alec's pointed cough from the front seat forced her to bite back the words.Letting the matter drop, Laura shifted her focus with a softened tone, the indulgence in it clear.
"Anyway, your sister's used to being spoiled. Try not to provoke her, alright? She gets upset easily and refuses to eat when she's in a mood."
Verena couldn't help finding it all a little ridiculous. Almost eighteen and still carrying herself like a pampered child, Kaia was the very picture of being spoiled.
Their exchange ended as the car rolled to a stop in front of a lavish villa that all but flaunted its wealth.Verena stepped out first, taking in the grand facade.
From the entrance, a girl in a cute T-shirt and short skirt came dashing toward them-Kaia, in all her youthful eagerness.
"Dad, Mom, you're finally back!" Kaia's voice rang out, bright and eager. The brightness dimmed when her gaze landed on Verena. Her eyes lingered, scanning Verena from head to toe.

Clad in aplain cream hoodie and pale yellow pants with clean white sneakers, Verena's look was ordinary at first glance. Yet her delicate features, flawless skin, and calm, distant aura gave her a beauty that couldn't be ignored.Nothing about her spoke of years spent in some remote countryside.

Kaia knew exactly who she was looking at-her full-blood sister-but the two had never shared a home.

Life in Shoildon had made Kaia the untouchable little princess of the Willis family, the jewel in their parents'eyes. This sudden reappearance of an elder sister left her with a subtle, uneasy knot in her chest.

"Oh, Kaia, honestly. How can you come outside wearing so little? Aren't you freezing?"

Laura's eyes went straight to the thin fabric Kaia wore before she quickly slipped off her own coat and draped it over her.

With a giggle, Kaia leaned against her mother. "Ha-ha, Mom, it's really not cold at all."

It was a scene warm enough to melt the chill from the air-but Verena had never been part of such moments.

Laughing together, Kaia and Laura headed inside, leaving Verena standing where she was, as though her arrival had already been forgotten.

As she walked, Kaia's eyes found Verena for a brief moment, casting a lingering, unreadable look over her shoulder.

At the sight of his younger daughter, Alec's expression softened, and he turned to bridge the gap.

"That's your sister, Kaia. She's done very well for herself. Scored high marks on her college entrance exams and already secured her spot at Acorith College of Medicine..."
###Chapter 2 Kaia's Insincerity


Alec paused as something seemed to click in his mind. He remembered a conversation from years ago with his mother, when she casually mentioned that Verena had never taken any college entrance exam.

A long, weary breath escaped him. "You'd be so much better off if you were more like Kaia."

Verena didn't even bother dignifying that with a reply. The comment was absurd enough to amuse her. They could recall every tiny quirk Kaia had, yet when it came to something as important as her education, no one had cared to ask. They simply assumed she fell short in comparison.

···

The Willis family home felt like foreign ground to Verena. It was strange to think this place was meant to be hers, yet she was stepping inside for the very first time.

Laura guided her down the hall toward a bedroom, her voice tinged with concern, and offered a reassuring smile. "If there's anything here that doesn't suit you, just tell me, alright?"

Verena kept her tone even. "Thanks, Mom."

"Sweetheart, you don't have to be so polite. I am your mother."

When Laura lingered in the doorway instead of leaving, Verena asked, "Was there something else?"

Laura and Alec had spent years clawing their way into high society, seizing their break the moment it appeared.Still, they were newcomers, and many in those circles saw them as outsiders. The Bennett family,on the other hand, was adynasty-wealthy,well-connected,and deeply rooted in prestige.

So when the Bennett family suggested a marriage alliance, Laura wasn't about to refuse. She could already picture the benefits, envisioning all the doors it would open.

But Isaac's accident had left him permanently disabled, and Laura couldn't imagine giving her precious younger daughter to him. That was when she decided to bring her eldest home. For a brief moment, staring into Verena's calmn, unflinching gaze, Laura felt the sting of guilt. She hadn't been there to raise her, and there was no real bond between them. The guilt was genuine, but the detachment was stronger.

Even so, she told herself this was an opportunity for Verena. A girl from a small,remote place, who had struggled in school and now worked as a doctor in a quiet town like Trisas, could only benefit from marrying into the Bennett family. Disabled or not, Isaac represented wealth, comfort, and security.

"You need to get some rest for now, Verena. There's someone I want you to meet later tonight, and I'll be the one taking you."

Laura didn't say who, but Verena didn't need to ask. It would be Isaac. She had already read about his accident online. The thought made her want to laugh and shake her head all at once. Expecting anything different from these parents had been foolish. Children who grew up feeling like afterthoughts learned to carry both bitterness and resignation.

"Alright." Verena gave a simple nod, though her agreement had nothing to do with Laura. She had come to Shoildon with only one purpose in mind-Isaac. A quiet thought crossed her mind, wondering what state he might be in now.

Laura's lips curved slightly when she saw no resistance. "Good. Get some rest, then. I'll leave you be."

Just as she was about to head out, she turned to Verena and said, "When you see him tonight, if anyone asks about your schooling, tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine wit a master's degree. Don't worry about them finding out otherwise-I'll take care of it."

Once the door clicked shut, Verena stretched out on the bed. Raising her right hand, she noticed the faint tremor in her fingers.

Six days had passed since she failed to save Shawna on the operating table. The scalpel had slipped, and her right hand hadn't stopped shaking since. For a surgeon, such trembling was the surest path to ruin.

Her mind churned with thoughts until sleep crept in, pulling her, into an unsettling dream.

In another room, Kaia lounged across the sofa, her phone lighting up with group chat messages. Everyone wanted to know-was her sister beautiful? The question soured Kaia's mood. Calling Verena pretty felt like an understatement. Even in simple clothes,she had the kind of beauty that caught and held the eye. Her complexion was smooth, unblemished, almost too refined for someone who had spent years in a remote backwater. Next to her, Kaia felt like the girl-next-door-sweet and harmless, but lacking genuine allure.

The questions kept coming, so Kaia finally typed back. "She's alright, not ugly."

She knew the answer was a blatant lie, yet the words had slipped out on instinct.

By now, everyone in Shoildon had heard whispers about the upcoming marriage between the Bennett family and the Willis family.

The city's wealthy young people were curious about the woman Isaac-once a man of unmatched promise-was set to marry.

Seeing Kaia's lukewarm reply, the group went quiet. Not ugly... It was the kind of phrase that hinted the woman was plain at best. Poor Isaac, they thought.

Among those reading was Bobby Bennett, Isaac's younger brother.

A sharp curse left his lips before he turned toward his mother, Danica Bennett.

"Mom,I get that my brother's legs aren't in the best shape... but does that mean you have to set him up with someone who can't do anything? Kaia says her sister's not exactly attractive."

The comment struck Danica with a dull ache. Like any mother, she wanted her son to have a worthy match.

Still, Isaac's condition went far beyond his injured legs. Certain aspects of his health as a man had been permanently damaged. As the matriarch of the Bennetts, she couldn't let whispers about the family spiral out of control. The safest route was to choose a bride who posed no threat-Verena Willis, the eldest daughter of that family.

"This is my decision, and you have no say in it," she said, masking her emotions with a cool tone.

Bobby's jaw tightened in anger.

Unmoved,Danica turned away and started up the staircase, uninterested in soothing his temper. A message from Laura had just arrived, asking her to set up a meeting between Verena and Isaac that evening.


Stepping into Isaac's dimly lit room, she crossed to the window without pause and yanked open the curtains.



Harsh daylight spilled across the floor,driving away the gloom.

Isaac was stretched out on the bed, his eyes shadowed but unblinking, his face as sharply defined as ever.

Knowing he was awake, Danica spoke plainly. "You'll be meeting a girl tonight. And you will marry her."

"If that's the plan, why waste time with a meeting? Just register the marriage and be done with it," Isaac answered,his voice flat.

A mixture of compassion and unspoken indignation churned in Danica's chest. No one outside the family knew that the accident had taken not just Isaac's health, but also her husband's life. With her son in this state,she dared not announce her husband's death, fearing it would shake the company's stability.

"Don't fight me on this. It's only polite to meet her first."

When she left the room, the shadows seemed to close in around Isaac again. Pain and self-disgust clouded his eyes. In his mind, his father's death was a burden he would always bear.

By the time dusk settled in, Verena was woken by a few knocks on the door before it opened. It was Kaia.

With a tone that wavered between forced cheer and thinly veiled condescension, Kaia said, "Verena, you're about to marry into the Bennett family. Congratulations. They're the top family in Shoildon."

Years of studying abroad had sharpened Verena's instincts, and Kaia's insincerity was as plain as day.

One look was enough to know Kaia disliked her.

In silence, Verena continued folding her quilt, patiently waiting to hear the rest of what Kaia had to say.
###Chapter 3 She's Not Good Enough For You


As Verena stayed silent, Kaia added, "The Bennett family might have a good name, but lsaac is already crippled. People say that when a man's legs are paralyzed, his sexual function is often affected too.l honestly don't want you marrying into that family."

While her words sounded concerned, Kaia's real hope was that Verena wouldn't become part of the Bennett family. Even with Isaac's health problems, he was still someone Kaia had once cared for. And if Verena married him, her life would undoubtedly turn out better than Kaia's.

Verena understood exactly what Kaia was trying to do, so she spoke plainly. "If you don't like me, that's fine.You don't have to pretend you're worried because..."

Verena stopped mid-sentence when she caught the flicker of surprise in Kaia's eyes, and then continued as if it meant nothing, "The feeling's mutual. I don't like you either."

That blunt truth left Kaia momentarily speechless. She hadn't imagined Verena would tear away her false concern so openly.

It was only after Verena had stepped out of the room that Kaia found her voice again. She stamped her foot in anger and snapped, "Who do you think you are? So arrogant! You're nothing but a country bumpkin from a backward place."

Verena had only reached the doorway. Hearing the insult, she turned back, remained just outside, and faced Kaia. "Your parents are from that same backward place. Should I let them know you think everyone from there is a bumpkin?"

The words left Kaia frozen in place. Verena's sharp, unyielding stare made her feel as though every hidden thought had been uncovered.

Her dislike for Verena deepened. This time, though, she didn't argue back and stormed off in a huff.

Kaia had just descended the staircase when Laura appeared before Verena. A shadow darkened Laura's expression.

Verena could guess the reason. Kaia must have run to her, claiming she'd been bullied by her older sister.

"What did you say to Kaia?" Laura asked, her tone sharp and accusing, as though she had already taken Kaia's side. It was clear she hadn't considered there might be another side to the story.

Such blind judgment was something Verena found hard to tolerate.

With a faint, mocking smile, she asked, "And what did she tell you?"

"I'm the one asking you!" Laura retorted.

Her temper spiked at Verena's question in return, certain that growing up in a rural backwater had stripped her eldest daughter of proper manners.

"She called me a country bumpkin, so I reminded her that if that's true, then you and Dad would be bumpkins too, because yo both grew up in the same place."

"Ridiculous! Kaia would never say something so disrespectful." Laura's fury deepened. "It's bad enough you angered your sister, but now you're making up lies? You've got some nerve, Verena."

The whole thing struck Verena as absurd. Laura pressed her for an answer, yet refused to believe her when she gave it. Was Laura only interested in hearing what matched her own opinion?

Verena wasn't the type to back down and had a way of provoking people further. Laura's refusal to believe her made her say, "If you've already decided I'm lying, then so be it. You believe Kaia no matter what. But you won't ever get an apology out of me. If I'm such a problem, I'll just go back to the countryside and let Kaia marry Isaac herself."

She knew exactly what Laura was aiming for and used it to shut her down.

"You!" Laura was genuinely provoked, but she held her temper in check, reminding herself of the real reason she had brought Verena to Shoildon.

She couldn't make sense of how different her daughters had turned out. Kaia was accomplished and sweet-tongued, always winning her over. Verena, in contrast, was unremarkable, stubborn, and dishonest.Years apart had made her feel like a stranger.

"Get your things together. You're coming with me to the meeting. And change your clothes. I'll have one of the servants bring you an outfit."

Verena's decision to come to Shoildon had nothing to do with her unfairly biased parents. The moment she saw the news, she had recognized Isaac.

She didn't care about dressing up to see himn. So when she came downstairs, she wore exactly what she had on before.

Laura, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, looked visibly unhappy. "Why didn't you change?"

"I don't feel like it," Verena said in an unhurried tone.

"You..." Laura could only glare, her patience wearing thin.

It dawned on her that Verena was not as submissive or easy to control as she had assumed.

Still, her priority at the moment was securing the marriage arrangement with Isaac.

"Alright, fine. If you won't change, then let's just go..."



Over in the chat group of the wealthy young people, Bobby kept directing questions at Kaia.

"Kaia, what kind of work does your sister do?"

Even though they shared the same group, Kaia usually had little reason to speak with Bobby.

Her thoughts raced the moment she saw him reach out to her first.

Not wanting Bobby to feel overlooked, she replied quickly, "My mom told me she works as a doctor in a small town."

Bobby's brows drew together slightly. Adoctor? If that was true, then at least she might be able to care for his brother. Thinking along those lines, he grudgingly accepted the idea of Verena being unattractive.Kaia knew her mother had planned to spread the claim that Verena was a master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine.

Kaia had poured years of effort into getting into Acorith College of Medicine and earning people's admiration, so the thought of Verena reaping such recognition without working for it irritated her.

With a hint of mischief in mind, Kaia put on an air of casualness and added, "But she never attended university. She probably just picked up a little from the local doctors."

"What? She never even went to university?" Bobby's surprise was obvious.

The title of "doctor" now felt suspicious to him.

Irritation welled up in Bobby. Isaac had graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in the world.It was bad enough to marry someone plain-looking, but to have her be undereducated as well...

Unable to keep it in any longer, Bobby sent a message to Isaac. "Please, don't marry Verena Willis. She's not good enough for you. Her sister said she never even went to college. Looks aside, she doesn't have much education."

Isaac was seated in a private room at Spice Restaurant, already waiting.

The setting there was elegant and calming.

Neither Isaac nor Danica, however, had the mood to enjoy the view beyond the window.

For Danica, this meeting was purely a business arrangement.

For Isaac, it was nothing more than a reminder of his own shortcomings.

When his phone chimed, Isaac glanced at the message from Bobby. His striking features stayed impassive.

Danica caught sight of Bobby's message as well.

She shut her eyes for a brief moment before saying, "Isaac, please don't resent me. I have no other option."

In her mind, the only way to stop the damaging rumors about him was for him to marry and quietly adopt a child, passing it off as his own.Isaac's lips curved in a faint, bitter smile. Resentment was a luxury he couldn't claim. In his eyes, he was the reason his mother had lost her husband.

Even so, Isaac sent Bobby a reply. "Watch your tone."

Bobby's temper flared when he read it. In a moment like this, Isaac was still telling him to be polite. Did Isaac even understand the real issue?

At that time, Verena and Laura reached Spice Restaurant.

Verena was tall and wearing flat shoes; Laura, teetering in high heels, had to hurry to match her pace.
###Chapter 4 Showing Off Something For Sale


As she walked, Laura whispered to Verena, "No one needs to know you never made it past secondary school.Just tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. That's the story. Got it?"

Verena had no desire to bother her with a reply.

Upon reaching the reserved room, Laura fixed her hair and straightened her clothes while Verena raised her hand and knocked.

The moment Danica heard someone knocking at the door, she knew the eldest daughter of the Willis family had arrived. This was the marriage arrangement she had personally set in motion. Now, as Isaac was about to meet Verena, emotions twisted inside her.

There was a time when Isaac had been her greatest pride. If that accident had never happened, he would be standing next to the most accomplished woman, not someone without much education.

Conflicting thoughts tugged at Danica. She couldn't bear the idea of others looking down on her son,yet she disliked the Willis family for trading their daughter's future for money.
"Come in," Danica instructed, her voice leaving no room for hesitation.

At once, Verena turned the handle and stepped into the room.

The eyes of both Danica and Isaac immediately settled on her.

Verena's outfit was plain-a loose sweatshirt with comfortable pants.Her hair was tied back, though a few strands brushed against her forehead. Minimal makeup left her features untouched, but her beauty was impossible to overlook. Among Shoildon's most polished ladies, she would still draw attention. She carried herself with a calm assurance that made her presence hard to ignore.
For a brief second, Danica just stared, surprise and admiration flashing in her gaze.

Isaac's brow furrowed instead. "So... you're from the Willis family?"

Danica's words came out with a hint of uncertainty, and Laura edged her way inside from behind Verena.Wearing an eager smile, she responded, "Good evening, Danica. That's me. Laura."

Laura guided Verena forward with a bright smile. "This is my daughter, Verena Willis."

Danica's look of surprise was impossible to miss, and Laura felt a wave of satisfaction. Verena carried Alec's features, and that face was something worth showing off. It comforted Laura to know her eldest daughter still had qualities that made her proud.

"Verena, is it?" asked Danica.

She studied the young woman's striking beauty and the confidence she carried. Nothing about her matched Bobby's claim that she was"110t exactly attractive." If this was considered.unattractive, then Shoildon would have no beautiful women left.

A flicker of satisfaction passed through Danica's.eyes. She was relieved to find the woman didn't match Bobby's unflattering description.

She still wanted a daughter-in-law who was easy to control and wouldn't go around exposing Isaac's issues in bed, but she also hoped the girl wouldn't be plain-looking. Appearances mattered, and whoever married into the family had to look the part.

Reading the satisfaction in Danica's expression, Laura felt a quiet surge of pride. Verena was her own flesh and blood, and when it came to looks, se easily outshone Shoildon's most polished ladies.

"Yes. Danica, this is Verena," Laura repeated warmly.

"Please, have a seat..." Danica's voice softened slightly.

While the two mothers traded polite remarks, Verena's attention shifted to Isaac seated across from her.

He wore a simple black shirt and sat in a wheelchair with a light blanket draped over his legs.

Catching her eyes on his legs, Isaac's fingers tightened over his knees, but his expression stayed steady and distant, as if her glance carried no weight.

 When their gazes locked, Verena showed no sign of discomfort. Instead, she gave him a poised smile. Even in a wheelchair, he was exactly as she remembered. He was cool, unyielding, and commanding in presence.

As they looked at each other, Danica motioned for Laura and Verena to take their seats.

Laura praised Verena like she was describing a rare gem, stressing her merits in case Danica harbored any doubts.

Danica felt entirely satisfied with what she saw.

Still, she couldn't help but find something unpleasant about the way Laura kept pushing her daughter forward. It felt less like introducing a future bride and more like showing off something for sale.

The reality was that lsaac's legs were already in a poor condition, and even though the Bennett family remained wealthy and influential, he wasn't the best choice for a husband.

By lowering Verena's position so much, Laura gave the impression she didn't care if her daughter ended up looked down upon or mistreated, as long as the marriage into the Bennett family happened. To Danica, such a mother was hard to respect.

With Verena and Isaac saying barely a word between them, it fell on Danica and Laura to keep the conversation going.

After several minutes of small talk, Danica finally asked Verena, "Miss Willis, your mother told me you hold a master's degree from Acorith College of Medicine. Is that right?"

This detail mattered to Danica. Having a doctor in the family would make caring for lsaac far more manageable.

The moment the question left Danica's lips, Laura grew tense. She feared Verena would stubbornly deny it,so she gave her daughter a discreet nudge under the table.

Laura thought no one would notice, yet both Danica and Isaac caught the movement.

A faint line formed between Danica's brows, while Isaac's cold, impassive gaze remained unchanged.

Verena raised her head, set her utensils down with steady hands, and gently dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering, "No."

Danica's face lost some of its warmth, and Laura's expression shifted sharply.

Inwardly, Laura fumed. Damn it, Verena was still as rigid as ever. Why couldn't she think on her feet? Did she have to embarrass her like this?

Her anger nearly boiled over, but she forced herself to hold it in andprepare a way to salvage the situation.

Before she could speak, Verena added, "I graduated from Pine Hill University."

Laura's eyes widened, and her face went through several changes. Pine Hill University was one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, and the revelation left her momentarily stunned.

Verena, on the other hand, stayed steady, her expression showing no hint of disturbance.

Laura's frustration nearly boiled over. She had always known Verena had grown up in a less refined place,but she hadn't expected her to be so bold in making up stories.

Claiming a degree from Acorith College of Medicine was already stretching the truth, yet now she dared to say she had graduated from Pine Hill University? Did Verena really think the people here would believe such a thing? Her lie had no shred of credibility.

Danica's surprise showed in her eyes. She looked from Verena to Laura's stiff, uneasy face, and in that moment, something clicked. The realization brought a deeper crease to her brow.

Isaac kept his gaze on Verena, and she responded with another gentle smile. It was warm, inviting, and carried the freshness of early spring.

That single smile lightened Isaac's mood in a way he couldn't explain. He quickly turned away, his brows knitting together as a strange wave of self-consciousness washed over him-not because she was outstanding, but because her kindness made him feel small in an ufamiliar way.

"Attending Pine Hill University is certainly impressive. You must be very talented," Danica said, her tone cold and detached.

Graduates from Pine Hill University stood among the most gifted people in the world, and calling them merely talented hardly did them justice.

Laura realized Danica had already caught on to the lie, but she forced herself to press forward. "Ha-ha, yes,it's very impressive. I must have gotten things mixed up... confusing it with the school Kaia will be attending."

The exchange left the dining table steeped in uncomfortable silence.

Without any more hesitation, Danica said, "I'm very pleased with Verena, and I'm sure lsaac is as well.Regarding the marriage agreement..."

"Mom," Isaac chimed in, stopping her before she could finish.

 ###Chapter 5 | Want To Help You


Danica sent Isaac a pointed glance that carried a silent warning.

Isaac paid no attention to her look and said, "I'd like a word alone with Miss Willis."

Since Isaac had spoken, Danica held back any further comment. She already knew his intentions. If only he would simply cooperate. Most likely, he was planning to convince Verena to back out.

With a slow exhale, Danica kept her poise. "It seems Isaac wants to speak privately with Verena and know more about her. Laura, let's step outside for a bit, shall we?"

She understood that Laura was eager for this marriage to happen.

Danica's words served as a subtle nudge to Isaac not to interfere with the agreement.

The response caught Laura off guard. She hadn't expected Danica to be so lenient after Verena's outrageous lie.

Feeling pleased, Laura replied, "Yes, they could use some time alone."

She gave Verena's shoulder a light pat, her voice holding a note of caution. "Verena, remember to take care of Isaac. He's your fiancé now."

Verena lifted her glass for a sip, a faint smile curving her lips. Her dislike for Laura hadn't changed, yet the thought of Isaac being her fiancé brought a quiet thrill to her heart.

When the two women stepped out, Isaac spoke. "My legs are useless now. They'll stay this way for the rest of my life."

His deep, slightly hoarse voice carried the weight of someone who hadn't spoken much in a long time,and his cool, detached tone made it sound almost void of emotion..

Yet Verena understood that his words were a warning, meant to remind her of the kind of man she was about to marry. What else?" she asked, her clear eyes fixed on him like a mirror that reflected everything.

Isaac hesitated. His throat tightened, and a shadow crossed his gaze as he thought of the unspoken truth.Then he forced himself to lay it bare. "I can't function like a normal man anymore. I can't give you happiness or the life of a normal marriage."

Isaac understood that his mother's intentions went beyond silencing gossip; she also hoped to steady the company's position. Even so, neither reason justified binding a woman to him in marriage. Becoming his wife would mean giving up her own happiness and future. In his mind, he was already a ruined man,and there was no need to pull someone else down with him.

At those words, Verena walked around the table until she stood directly in front of him.

From where he sat, Isaac had to lift his gaze to meet the eyes of anyone around him.

Verena lowered herself into a crouch so she was looking up at him instead.

It was the first time since the accident that Isaac wasn't forced to look upward at someone.

"Can I touch your legs?" Verena asked.

There was no hesitation in her tone. Her clear eyes held no judgment or avoidance, as though she were speaking to any other man and not one paralyzed from the waist down. Unlike the rest of his family, she didn't treat his injuries as a forbidden topic.

Since the accident, every relative who looked at him carried pity and regret in their eyes. They didn't speak the words aloud, but their glances said it all. He was crippled, no longer a complete man.

Most people knew that paralysis often meant a loss of sexual function, and he was no exception. Rumors about his body had spread, and the cruel truth was that they matched reality. The wound they left was sharper and more suffocating than any blade to the chest.

Isaac fixed his deep gaze on Verena. "Do you realize what you're saying?"

She nodded, her expression steady. "Yes, I do."

They had been strangers until this moment, yet lsaac felt an odd sense of familiarity when looking at her. He couldn't explain the reason. Driven by instinct, he gave his answer. "Okay."

With his consent given, Verena's eyes curved with a soft, genuine smile.

For a brief moment, Isaac's focus wavered.

When her fingers touched his leg, he could see the movement, yet no sensation reached him.

He followed the sight of her slender fingers as they began at his knee and slowly traveled upward.

To an outsider, the gesture might have looked like she was trying to flirt, but Isaac knew better. He was a man living with paraplegia, completely powerless and without feeling below the waist.

Her hand stopped on his thigh, tapping lightly before she looked up.an you feel that?"

Isaac gave a small shake of his head.

Her touch resumed, inching closer toward the base of his thigh, until Isaac reacted on instinct and caught her hand.

"What are you trying to do?" His voice was edged with warning.

Verena let out a quiet laugh, pulling her hand back without resistance.

"Isaac, I want to help you."

"Help me?" he repeated with a mocking twist to his tone. "Help me with what exactly?"

"I want to help heal your legs."

The statement landed like a sudden crack of thunder in the still air.

It sounded ridiculous, yet something in her unwavering expression sparked an unfamiliar flicker of hope inside him.

When reality set back in, Isaac let out a bitter laugh at himself, Countless experts had studied his condition and found no cure, yet here he was letting the words of a woman he barely knew stir something in him.

"Do you realize how cruel a joke like that is to someone who's disabled?" Isaac asked. In his mind, even open contempt would have been kinder than offering a false hope.

Isaac slowly loosened his grip on her hand.

"I'm being serious," Verena said, her gaze locked firmly on his.

Her reason for coming to Shoildon was solely because of Isaac, and she had no intention of abandoning that purpose halfway.

He regarded her with a chill in his eyes. "Then tell me why you want to help me. And what makes you think you're capable of it?"

Verena faltered for a brief moment. She had already realized that Isaac had no memory of her.

"Do you really not remember what happened in Clokron's Dragon Quarter?"

In Isaac's mind, there was no doubt he had never seen her before. She was a woman of striking beauty-someone whose presence would command attention anywhere. If they had crossed paths, there was no way he could have forgotten her.

He gave a slow shake of his head. "I've been to Dragon Quarter plenty of times, but I've never once seen you there."

A quiet sigh escaped Verena. So that was it. Maybe it had something to do with the recent accident.

She wasn't certain of the specifics of his condition and would need to look into it before deciding anything.

Without the accident, Isaac couldn't have forgotten her. No one forgot the person they once pursued-unless they had lost their memory. And for him, amnesia seemed the most likely explanation.

"Isaac, I don't know the full extent of your condition yet. Once I've reviewed your medical files, I'll give you a clear answer. But... could you at least not shut me out right now?"

Isaac's eyes stayed on her, his silence stretching between them.

Looking into those eyes that seemed to pierce through him, he felt his usual resolve weaken for the first time. After what felt like a long pause, he spoke unexpectedly. "Alright."

A beat later, he added, "If you can heal my legs, I'll give the Willis family everything they're asking for. But my condition makes marriage impossible. A life with me would be a life spent alone."

Verena froze, and then realization struck her. Her eyes flicked almost instinctively toward his crotch. "You..."

The glance made Isaac's face heat with shame. When their eyes met again, the clarity in her gaze made him feel a rare and uncomfortable urge to turn away.


###Chapter 6 Don't Turn Me Away


Isaac's hands tightened around the armrests of his wheelchair, drawing on nearly all his strength before he managed to suppress the wave of self-loathing inside him. When he finally spoke, his voice was steady and cold. "Just as you thought, I have every condition that comes with being a cripple."

The meaning in his words was unmistakable, and Verena grasped it instantly.

When she met his gaze, it felt as though a shadow had settled over his eyes.

An ache spread through her chest without warning. It was hard to believe that the once proud and refined heir of the Bennett family had come to this.

His refusal had nothing to do with rejecting an arranged marriage-it was rooted in a deep and consuming sense of inferiority.

Without thinking, she closed her fingers around his hand. "Isaac, don't turn me away."

Once,those words had belonged to him. Now, she was the one saying them.

The resolve in her gaze was fierce, so fierce it felt like heat on his skin.

Since the day of the accident, he had shut the door on every show of concern, unwilling to endure the pity that always followed.

No one he had pushed away had ever insisted on staying-not even his mother.

Something he couldn't name moved through him, and he found himself saying, "Alright."

Her smile broke across her face in a way that was soft yet luminous. "Then it's settled."

For a moment, he let himself get lost in that smile, and the reason he had requested a private talk with her slipped from his mind entirely.

It struck him then that this woman he barely knew had already managed to pull down the barriers he held against everyone else.

Matters he would stubbornly stand his ground on with anyone else seemed to bend whenever she was involved, and somehow those moments had turned into talks of engagement and marriage. His plan had been to convince her to walk away from the arrangement, yet this was where they had ended up.

...

The conversation between Verena and Isaac about the marriage lasted less than twenty minutes before they reached a decision.

When the meeting concluded, both families went their separate ways.

The moment Laura sat down in the car, the polite smile she had been wearing crumbled.

Thinkingback to Danica's subtle hints during the meeting made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

Her patience finally gave way, and she scolded Verena, "You shameless girl! Did you forget what I told you?I said you should tell people you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine, but you went and said Pine Hill University instead. Do you honestly have no idea how to tell a more convincing lie?"

Verena cut her off mid-sentence. "I told the truth."

Her eyes stayed steady, without the slightest trace of guilt for being called out.

For a split second, Laura almost believed her. But she knew the truth-Verena had never attended college and only held a high school diploma.

Watching her daughter stubbornly stand by her claim only fueled Laura's anger and contempt. To her, it was proof that rural life had left Verena with an unruly and brazen nature.

"Kaia spent three years working hard to get into Acorith College of Medicine. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to enter a top university? Especially one like Pine Hill University." Laura's voice sharpened as she shot Verena a sidelong-glance. "Now look at the mess you've made. You told such a huge lie you can't even maintain it. Didn't you see Danica's reaction when you claimed Pine Hill University? Who would believe something so ridiculous? You've dragged the Willis family's name through the mud with your constant lying!"

Verena felt no surprise at Laura's opinion. To Laura, she would always be nothing more than an uneducated,ill-mannered girl from the remote countryside. A mother who never even tried to understand her child had already failed in that role.

When Laura brought up Kaia as a comparison, Verena could only find it amusing. Kaia had spent three years working hard to get into the college that now wanted to invite Verena as a lecturer. If Laura knew that, her temper would likely explode.

Verena responded sharply, "You think calling myself a Pine Hill University graduate is a lie, but claiming I went to Acorith College of Medicine isn't?"

As she looked at her mother, whatever expectations she had once held for her vanished completely. Her voice turned sharp and cold. "Don't forget, you're the one who taught me how to lie. You're the compulsive liar here,not me."

Laura froze, caught off guard by the bluntness of the retort.

She drew in a breath to scold Verena for her disrespect, but Verena cut her off. "I don't care to hear any more. You wanted a marriage arranged with the Bennett family. Now it's done. You're satisfied, I'm satisfied,and there's nothing else to talk about."

The car pulled up to the Willis Villa just then, and Verena stepped out without giving Laura a chance to reply.She headed straight for the front gates.

Watching her daughter's back disappear, Laura's irritation swelled to its peak. To her, Verena was nothing but an ignorant, uncultured hick with no sense of manners. Such defiance toward her own mother had to have been encouraged by that meddlesome Shawna in the backward place she came from.

If Isaac hadn't been crippled in both legs, and if Laura hadn't wanted to protect Kaia's future happiness,she would never have agreed to bring Verena back from such a dreadful place. In her mind, only the children raised under her own roof counted as real family. The Willis Villa spanned four floors. The first was the living room, the second held the family's bedrooms,the third was used for storage, and the fourth was reserved for guests.

The whole thing bordered on ridiculous. There were only five people in the family, yet Verena's room had been tucked away at the far end of the third floor, right beside the storage closet.

On the second floor, the spare room had been set aside solely as Kaia's study.

If not for the arranged marriage, there likely would have been no intention to bring Verena back at all.

For that reason, Laura's behavor came as no surprise to Verena, though it still left her with a bitterness she couldn't quite name.

As she began making her way upstairs, the sound of footsteps echoed from above.

When she lifted her gaze, a tall young man was descending the staircase. He wore a relaxed hip-hop outfit,and though his face held traces of youth, it was undeniably handsome.

Verena had never seen him before, but the easy manner in his stride and his casual clothing made it obvious. This was her younger brother, Luka Willis.

At the same time Verena spotted him, Luka's eyes also fell on her.

Her hair was tied back in a simple ponytail, and her clothes were plain, yet her beauty was striking.In that instant, Luka knew without doubt she was his eldest sister.

He had once heard through the chatter in the wealthy young people's group chat that Verena was supposedly unattractive, a rumor that had left him feeling embarrassed.

Now, seeing her in person, he could only conclude those claims were pure fantasy.

Her finely shaped features were bare of makeup, yet her face still radiated a quiet elegance, and there was an undeniable cool detachment in her eyes.

That same glint in her gaze mirrored something in his own, leaving Luka certain she was family. He found himself wondering who had started the rumor about Verena being unattractive in the first place. At the start, Luka had no particular feelings toward Verena, but neither did he oppose her. Still, the fact that she had caused trouble for his cherished sister, Kaia, left a mark.

With a sharp little scoff, Luka dismissed the thought. Beauty meant nothing if she had already offended Kaia.

###Chapter 7 What Was She Planning


Luka recalled Kaia's earlier complaints about Verena, and the irritation he felt toward her only deepened.

Kaia had tried to kindly remind Verena to mind her manners in front of others, yet Verena had brushed off her good intentions and even turned on her.

Since childhood, Luka and Kaia had been inseparable, and he had never tolerated anyone treating her poorly.

With that thought, he slid his hands into his pockets and continued to head down the stairs at an unhurried pace.

Verena's eyes rested on Luka for no more than two seconds before she looked away. If Kaia didn't accept her as anything more than an outsider, there was no reason to expect warmth from a brother she had never known.

In her mind, it made no difference how much they disliked her, so long as they kept their distance.Unfortunately,KKaia and Luka seemed to share an unspoken agreement to find ways to provoke her.

When Verena walked past Luka, she noticed his foot suddenly jut out into her path.

A low, amused scoff escaped her. So this was his plan, to make her stumble and perhaps send her tumbling down the stairs.

Before he could succeed, she planted her foot firmly on top of his, stopping him mid-motion. His foot had already been moving forward, and the unexpected weight forced his balance forward. Seizing the moment,Verena gave him a push from behind.

Unprepared,Luka lurched forward and tumbled down the steps, a startled cry tearing from his throat."Ah!"

The sound of his voice rang through the stairwell as he rolled to the bottom.

From the landing above, Verena turned and looked down at him, her expression cold.

Kneeling on the floor, Luka clutched the railing, the sharp sting in his knees leaving him too weak to get up.

Just then, Laura walked in through the door, and the scene that met her eyes stopped her in her tracks.

"Luka!"

She rushed forward in a panic, bending to help Luka to his feet.

Right as Luka opened his mouth to curse, Laura's voice reached him, and he instantly changed to a pitiful tone. "Mom, Verena pushed me down the stairs."

Laura had already been irritated with Verena's behavior earlier in the day, and now, knowing she had shoved Luka only stoked her fury. She had endured Verena's unpleasant attitude for the sake of the marriage alliance, but her son was her world. Anyone who dared hurt him would have to answer to her.

Her eyes flashed as she fixed Verena with a hard glare. "Why did you push your brother?"

Verena took in Luka's fake display of grievance with a faint smirk, thinking how well the two siblings played their parts, even using the same tactics.

Verena answered Laura's question with a shrug. "He made the first move and tried to trip me, so I simply turned it back on him. Figured he should learn what it feels like."

Her tone stayed even, not rushed, as though she was just stating plain fact rather than defending herself.

Luka was only fifteen, and her composure made him uneasy, worried that Laura might actually believe her.

Clutching at Laura's arm, he changed the subject with a voice that wavered as if holding back tears. "Mom,Verena really did push me down the stairs on purpose. I didn't try to trip her. My leg hurts so much...could it be broken?"

Lately, word had spread all over Shoildon that Isaac had lost the use of both legs. Everywhere Laura went,people were shaking their heads and mourning how far the golden boy had fallen.

Because of that, when she heard Luka complain about his leg, her alarm spiked.

She quickly tried tosoothe him. "Don't worry, l'Il get you to the hospital right away." Verena's indifferent expression, however, only made Laura's anger boil over.

Once she had called for an ambulance, Laura turned sharply to Verena.

"So you've barely set foot in this house and you're already flexing like you own the house? If I let this slide,you'll forget who's in charge around here, and that's not happening."

With that, Laura stormed up the stairs, her hand raised high, ready to strike Verena across the face.

Right before the slap connected, Verena caught Laura's wrist, forcing it firmly downward.

Laura's eyes widened in disbelief. "How dare you..."

She started to speak, but Verena's grip tightened, making Laura draw in a sharp breath from the pain.

Locking eyes with her, Verena spoke in a slow, measured tone. "I already told you-he tried to trip me first,so I pushed him down the stairs. Laura Willis, I never expected fairness from you, but don't think you can treat me like prey just because of other people. If you want me to marry Isaac and get everything you're hoping for, then you'd better not push me too far. Otherwise, you can send your precious younger daughter instead."

Once the words were out, Verena let go, and Laura stumbled backward. She almost lost her footing but managed to grab the railing in time.

Without another glance, Verena walked up the stairs.

Laura remained frozen, staring at Verena's cold, unyielding figure, her mind replaying the piercing look in her eyes.

That clear gaze held a fierce determination that made Laura feel as though she was facing a stranger.

Before Kaia's birth, every phone call with Verena had been met with timidity and obedience.

She had always believed her eldest daughter was easy to control. What unsettled her now was not just the defiance-it was the unfamiliarity that came with it.

If Verena's earlier refusal to change clothes or lie as instructed hinted at her unwillingness to be manipulated, her most recent words revealed something deeper. There was cunning and calculation behind them.With only a few sentences, Verena showed she understood Shoildon's social undercurrents and the exact reason she had been brought back from the countryside. For her to know their intentions yet still return,what was she planning?

Laura began to wonder if bringing Verena back from the countryside had been a mistake. What if sending er to marry into the Bennett family ended up destroying the advantages Danica had promised them?

Shame burned in her chest, tangled with frustration. Laura had convinced herself that a girl raised in a ackwater would be too meek to cause trouble, and that she would be too ignorant to understand her chemes. After all, Laura herself had come from that same place, and her early years in the city had been othing but a blur of nerves and uncertainty.

ut Verena saw through everything. The girl's insight left Laura feeling exposed. At the same time, she felt a ense of odd guilt. Verena was still her daughter, and no one knew her prejudices better than she did.

nen another thought struck. Was it not a daughter's responsibility to lighten her mother's burden?arrying into the Bennett family would secure Verena a future wrapped in luxury and influence. Yet, instead showing gratitude, the girl dared to talk back with the kind of defiance shaped by too much time spent ound Shawna.

ka, on the other hand, wasn't trying to untangle any complicated feelings. He just stood there, stunned by rena's tone. To him, it was proof of what Kaia had said all along-that Verena was nothing more than a ty, ill-mannered country girl with no real worth.

###Chapter 8 She Told The Truth


At the Bennett home, the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted through the air as Danica lounged on the sofa,chatting casually with Isaac.

"Verena is pretty," Danica said, pouring the coffee with practiced ease. "Still, growing up without her parents around and never getting a proper education leaves its mark."

Danica had never cared much about a person's bank account, yet schooling was another matter entirely.The Bennett family held one of the highest standings in Shoildon, and while Verena's family history didn't trouble her, the gap in education could invite friction.

She thought back to the dinner at the restaurant, where Verena had claimed she was a Pine Hill University graduate.That memory brought a faint crease to her brow.

"Maybe she dressed up the truth a little," Danica added with a faint shrug. "No matter. Once she's married in, we can smooth things out."

She slid a cup toward Isaac, who accepted it and let it rest on his lap without taking a sip.

"She told the truth," he said, his deep voice breaking the quiet between them.

The coffee pot halted midair before Danica set it down. "What are you talking about? And how are you so sure?"

Isaac didn't bother with an immediate reply. His eyes lingered on a droplet clinging to the rim of his cup,watching it tremble before sliding down.

Memories from earlier flashed in his mind, the way Verena had knelt slightly to meet his gaze, her slim hand resting lightly on his useless legs, her voice steady as she said, "I want to help you."

This was the first time he had ever seen her, a complete stranger until now. Still, there was something quietly steady about her that drew him in and made her seem trustworthy.The honesty in her gaze and the sincerity in the way she carried herself left little room for doubt. When she said she graduated from Pine Hill University, it felt impossible to question her. Lying just didn't seem like something she'd do.

Across from him, Danica noticed his distant expression. It struck her that Verena had spoken to him in private earlier. Maybe something she had told him made him believe her.

Danica wasn't surprised by his sudden silence. Since the accident, Isaac had become the kind of man who measured his words, speaking only when necessary before letting the conversation dissolve into silence.

She tried to speak, but the words slipped away before they could form, leaving her with nothing but a sigh.At this point, whether Verena had told the truth or not no longer seemed to matter. Once the girl became part of the family, she would be shaped into the kind of daughter-in-law they expected.

Skepticism came naturally to Danica when she thought about Verena's claim. The moment she mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University, Laura's startled reaction had been impossiblé to miss.

Given Laura's love of flauntingany scrap of prestige, a daughter with that kind of degree would have been paraded in front of everyone long ago. The idea that she could have allowed such an outstanding daughter to stay in the backward place was laughable.

What puzzled Danica more was how Verena had managed to sway Isaac, a man far too sharp to be easily fooled.


...

Night settled in as Verena lay in bed, her gaze fixed on Isaac's name in her contacts.

Impulse overrode hesitation, and she tapped into the chat, typing out a quick message. "Are you home?"

Isaac read the text, brows drawing together, and then sent back a single word."Yeah."

A small, knowing smile tugged at Verena's lips. There had been a time when he filled their chats with long,eager lines instead of clipped answers.

Her profile photo sat as a blank white square, while his was a stark black. Vith most men, that kind of short reply could pass for arrogance or a sign they wanted the conversation ver.


ut Isaac wasn't most men. This was simply who he was, reserved with anyone who didn't matter to him.

is nature was no mystery to Verena. She had always known him that way.

e asked without hesitation, "Could you send me your medical records?"

le request made Isaac's grip on his phone tighten slightly.

e Bennett family had turned to some of the most respected doctors in the field, yet none had succeeded estoring his ability to walk.

hough his hope had never completely died, the constant string of disappointments had worn him thin.

eyes dropped to the blanket draped over his legs, and a crease formed between his brows. Was it worth ing the heartbreak again?

ore he could decide, the phone buzzed in his hand.

short words lit up the screen. "Trust me."

ething in those words settled into his chest like a quiet ember, giving off a warmth he hadn't felt in a time. Could she really help him stand again?

brushed the edae of the armrest as a thought formed. After so many failed attempts, maybe one The quiet gave Verena space to think. Staring at the ceiling, she let old memories creep in before sending another message. "Do you really not remember me?"

Back then, she had almost been ready to say yes to him, but life had pulled them in different directions.

Isaac paused at the question, and his mind wandered back to their private conversation at Spice Restaurant,when she had also asked if he remembered what happened in Dragon Quarter, Clokron.

The name stirred nothing. His brow knitted as he searched his memory, finding no trace of her.

He replied at last, "Sorry, I don't remember much. Have we met before?"

The moment she read his question, Verena felt a quiet sense of confirmation sette in. It was exactly what she had expected.

The accident had stolen pieces of Isaac's memory, but to him, nothing felt missing. He assumed their paths had crossed before and that she was simply a stranger he hadn't remembered meeting.

To her, it felt as if his memory had selectively erased her alone, leaving a strange gap only they could navigate.

His case was a bit complicated, and the therapy would take time.

"Forget it. We'll talk another time," she responded.

His medical history demanded her attention far more than any question about the past. Whatever was wrong with his legs was the real priority; everything else could wait.

Isaac's eyes lingered on the messages she had sent, his lips pressed into a flat,unreadable line.

···

Later that evening, Kaia swept in from outside.

Two servants trailed behind her, each struggling under stacks of books so tall they nearly blocked their view -every one ofthem written by respected medical authorities from around the globe.

Clutching her thickest and most treasured volume to her chest, Kaia stepped inside with a satisfied gleam in 
her eyes.

The moment Kaia spotted Laura sitting on the sofa, she rushed toward her, eager to spill her excitement.

"Mom, look at this!" Kaia's voice carried a mix of pride and excitement. "I finally got my hands on the latest release by my idol, Evelyn." She flipped it open and tilted it toward Laura. "Their research is brilliant.The way they see the world of medicine is unlike anyone else. Honestly, I think the person might be a true genius."

Her tone shifted into something wistful. "It's just... no one knows who the person really is. Aside from a name, we don't know their nationality, gender, or even what they look like. Meeting them someday would be incredible."

Kaia's academic excellence had been a constant source of pride, never once causing Laura to worry.

Laura reached over and patted herdaughter's head, smiling warmly. "Kaia, you're so hardworking and well-mannered."

The company would one day belong to her son Luka, so Laura had no plans to involve Kaia in its operations.All she wanted was for her daughter to make a name for herself in a field of her choice and bring prestige to the family.

Her smile faded as another thought intruded. "Not like Verena, who seems to live for provoking me."

If Luka's injuries had been more serious, Laura would have made sure Verena paid the price.

Kaia listened in silence, a faint satisfaction settling over her as her mother spoke.
###Chapter 9 We Should Work Together To Stop It


Kaia liked Isaac, yet her feelings never clouded her judgment enough to consider marrying a man with a disability. She would never agree to be his wife, and she wouldn't stand by if anyone else tried to marry him either. That was the root of her resentment toward Verena.

With a quiet sense of satisfaction buried deep inside, Kaia put on an act of worry and asked, "Mom, what did Verena do to make you so upset?"

Laura, more than ready to let out her anger, began telling Kaia about the falsehoods Verena had told in front of the Bennett family.

"That's Pine Hill University we're talking about! Did she think it was some random, insignificant school?Claiming she was enrolled there only makes it look like we're lying. She ruined my reputation today, and the more I think about it, the more it infuriates me. And if that wasn't enough, she even pushed Luka down the stairs. If Luka hadn't come out of it unhurt, I would have really let her have it."

Kaia could hardly believe what she was hearing. Verena truly was living in a fantasy. She was just a girl from a backwater place, with nograsp of reality and no ability to tell a convincing lie.

Pine Hill University? Did she honestly think everyone else was that gullible?

Biting back her laughter, Kaia offered Laura a few words of comfort before heading back to her room.She opened the group chat for the young people from the elite families, a habit she had before ending the night.

The moment she clicked in, she noticed that Bobby had tagged her name directly.

That small action made her feel as if she had gained the Bennett family's special attention.

Scrolling upward, she saw that someone in the chat had brought up Bobby first, asking him about Isaac and Verena's first meeting.

Bobby's answer was vague, but it was obvious he did not approve of the idea of Verena becoming his sister-in-law.t after that, Bobby tagged Kaia and asked, "Do you know what's going on with your sister? What's she


I's hopes for Verena to end up with Isaac were no secret to Kaia, yet the thought of it happening was thing she would never accept.

she passed along what Laura had told her earlier, she left out the part about pretending to be from h College of Medicine. Instead, she told the group that Verena had gone so far as to ĉlaim she was a ate of Pine Hill University.

st to make fun of it was Slater Lyons, Bobby's closest friend. "Pine Hill University? Did I really just at? That's one bold lie."

g that message, Bobby's patience thinned at once. He questioned what kind of woman his mother sen for his brother. In his mind, lacking looks was forgivable, but being poorly educated and lying as e nothing was far worse.

take long for the group chat to erupt with ridicule.

t of embarrassment touched Kaia as the insults piled up. Instead, she let a small, pleased smile her face.


kept up her carefully built image of a gentle and kind young woman.

a message in Verena's defense. "She only said that because she didn't want people to look down he's actually a good person with no bad intentions. The city's new to her, and it's not easy to ase, don't speak a step in to shut down the idea of the marriage between their families.

And she was right. Bobby grew angrier with each comment he read. If Verena were allowed to marry Isaac,it would spell disaster for his future.

At one point, Bobby had thought that if she stayed in line, he could learn to put up with her. But after realizing she was a skillful liar, he became sure she would only cause trouble. Isaac, who rarely cared about anything and lacked her slyness, could be taken advantage of easily. Bobby would not let that happen.

Bobby didn't hesitate before pulling up Kaia's profile in the group chat and sending her a friend request.

When the notification appeared on her phone, Kaia almost doubted her own eyes. Could it really be that Bobby from the Bennett family had taken the first step to contact her?

Rather than fading quickly, her shock mingled with a sense of excitement.

In Shoildon's social circles, her family might be considered among the wealthy, but they were barely on the bottom rung, while the Bennetts sat securely at the top. Bobby's presence in the group was purely due to his friendship with Slater, and he had never bothered to interact with the rest of them.

Fighting to keep her composure, Kaia tapped "accept" without delay, and then typed a polite question as if the request meant little to her. "Mr. Bennett, was there something you wanted to discuss?"

Without missing a beat, Bobby responded, "Why don't we meet in person?"

The simple message sent a rush of thrill through her. Though she had once been drawn to Isaac, Bobby was just as much a catch. Now that Isaac's disability had changed everything, the idea of Bobby showing interest in her was something most women she knew would envy.

Playing at hesitation, Kaia chewed lightly on her lip before replying, "Mr. Bennett, are you sure this is a good idea? It feels rather sudden."

Bobby nearly scoffed at the screen, already guessing what she must be imagining.

With one hand, he typed out his real reason for reaching out. "You don't want Verena marrying Isaac, right?Then we should work together to stop it." From the way Bobby had reached out, Kaia had first assumed he might have taken a personal interest in her.

It caught her off guard to realize he disliked Verena enough to want to join forces in stopping her marriage to Isaac. What she hadn't anticipated was Bobby's willingness to work with her, and that discovery brought a spark of satisfaction. The chance to block Verena from marrying Isaac while drawing closer to Bobby felt like a perfect victory on both fronts.

Kaia wanted nothing more than to agree to Bobby's proposal. Still, she knew she had to keep up the illusion of being a caring sister to Verena. If she let her open dislike show, that would shatter the gentle,innocent image she had worked so hard to craft. Men tended to admire women who seemed sweet, soft-spoken, and kind.

"This marriage was arranged by our parents. We can't just undo it. Besides, marrying your brother is the best thing that could happen to Verena. As her sister, I should be glad for her, not stand in her way."

Bobby had never spoken with Kaia one-on-one before, but whatever goodwill he might have had toward her evaporated after only a few minutes. He'd seen enough manipulation in his life to recognize when someone was pretending.

Each word of her message was laced with insincerity and hypocrisy. If she truly cared about Verena's happiness, she wouldn't have paraded Verena's humiliations in the group chat for everyone to see. Verena had her flaws, but Kaia was just as bad,maybe even worse.

###Chapter 10 You Really Are Kind-Hearted


Bobby had no patience for people who hid behind self-righteousness to mask their manipulation. If Isaac's future happiness hadn't been on the line, he wouldn't have wasted a breath on someone as foolish as Kaia.

For the sake of his goal, he swallowed his distaste and didn't call her out. Instead, he played along and tried to convince her.

He typed out a long message. "Do you really think marrying lsaac is the best thing that could happen to your sister? She grew up far from the city's pace, never went to college, never stepped into elite circles. In a family like mine, she'd be out of her depth before the first dinner party. When the conversation turns to business or high society, she'll have nothing to say. And don't forget-Isaac may be in a wheelchair,but his mind is as sharp as ever. He's still the same strategist who dominated the business world. They're not equals, and being with him won't give Verena a shred of happiness."

Kaia didn't give a thought to Verena's well-being. Her only objective was to break the engagement.

She wished she could meet Bobby now and discuss the plans to stop this marriage. Still, she knew she had to mask her eagerness, play the part of the reluctant participant.

When his message went unanswered, Bobby recognized the ploy instantly. Kaia was dangling hesitation to draw him in. He pressed anyway, guiding her toward joining forces. "She claims a degree from a prestigious university, but it's a lie. People will talk. And if word gets around that the Willis family stooped to disgraceful tricks just to push her into the Bennett family, you won't just damage her reputation-you'll drag your whole family's name through the mud in Shoildon."

The barb landed exactly where Bobby intended. He'd offered Kaia a neat escape from her fake benevolence, and, just as he expected, her reply came back almost instantly.

"That's true. Verena's far too timid-marrying into the Bennett family would only see her pushed around.And because of her bold lies, the Willis name would be tied to rumors of using shady tactics. Worse still,your Bennett family would end up being the laughingstock." Bobby scanned her message, his lips curling in silent disdain. Fool. Who in their right mind would dare mock the Bennett family? Only moments ago she'd been insisting Verena would be lucky to marry into their ranks,and now she was parroting his words without hesitation. Her sudden agreement told him everything-Kaia was willing to join forces with him.

Another message came through before he could finish the thought. "Although I know this isn't right,for Verena's sake and for the Willis family's dignity, I'll work with you."

A humorless chuckle escaped Bobby. Kaia had a knack for wrapping her schemes in silk, making herself look noble while pretending her hands were clean.

If it weren't for his determination to keep Verena away from Isaac, he wouldn't waste a single word on her.

"You really are kind-hearted to a fault," Bobby replied, the sarcasm tucked neatly behind a smooth tone.

Kaia's cheeks warmed when she read it. Was that a compliment? Many had praised her before, but never someone of Bobby's rank. She'd heard he was proud, even dismissive, and rarely spoke well of anyone.Could he actually be interested in her?

Kaia lingered over the message, her thoughts tumbling ahead of her.

With Isaac confined to a wheelchair, Bobby stood as the Bennett family's brightest heir. His tone almost hinted at interest-didn't it? If Isaac couldn't be won, then Bobby would make an excellent prize instead.

Feeling a rush of satisfaction, she responded wit a feigned modesty, "I'm honored you'd say that. My concern is only for Verena-it's not about being kind. She's my sister, after all. If I won't think for her, who will?"

Bobby didn't even bother responding. What a ridiculous woman.

Switching back to business, Kaia asked, "So, where and when should we meet?"

Still undecided, Bobby sent a short reply, saying, "I'll let you know."

"Alright," Kaia answered, punctuating it with a cutesy emoji.

Without a glance at it, Bobby tossed the phone onto the table and headed straight for lsaac's study. A firm rap of his knuckles sounded against the heavy door.

Isaac sat behind his desk, eyes scanning a stack of documents. At the knock, he didn't even glance up."Come in," he said, his tone flat and detached.

The latch clicked, and the door swung open almost immediately.

Bobby strode in without hesitation, his voice brimming with urgency. "Isaac, did Verena tell you she graduated from Pine Hill University? Don't buy it-she's justa-"

"Get out," Isaac interjected, his voice like ice.

He knew exactly where Bobby was going with this and had no interest in hearing the rest.

The sharp dismissal threw Bobby off balance, but he tried to push through. "Isaac-"

One glance from Isaac stopped him cold.

The slight furrow of Isaac's brows and the glint in his eyes carried a silent, unmistakable warning.

Bobby had feared that look since they were kids. When Isaac got serious, backing down wasn't just smart-it was instinct.

Bobby swallowed his frustration and walked out without another word.

Isaac's gaze lingered on the door long after it shut, his expression unreadable.

Out in the hallway, Bobby replayed the exchange in his mind-lsaac's cold indifference, Kaia's manipulations. If Kaia could be that rotten and she was Verena's sister, then Verena couldn't be much better.

A low, derisive laugh slipped from Bobby's lips. The Willis sisters-one a hypocrite, the other a fraud.Disabled or not, Isaac deserved better than either of them.

Bobby was determined to stop this marriage from happening. Resolved, he chose a meeting spot, set the time, and sent Kaia a short message telling her to meet him tomorrow.

Morning came, and a gleaming red sports car rolled smoothly along the main road, its driver locked on the traffic ahead.

Halfway through a turn, a muffled ringtone buzzed from the inside pocket of his jacket.

Bobby took out his phone, checked the screen, and pressed it to his ear. "Mom, what's going on?"

"Don't 'what's going on' me," Danica retorted immediately. "Why aren't you at the office?"

There was no way Bobby was going to explain where he was really headed, so he kept his tone light."Taking a day off.Got something important to handle."

"Important?" she scoffed. "The only 'important' things you do are eat, drink, and waste time. Get yourself back to work."

Bobby's lips twisted in a dry smile. Same old script. In her eyes, he'd never been anything more than an idle boy who knew nothing but how to enjoy himself.

Telling Danica he was out digging for ways to sabotage the marriage alliance wasn't part of Bobby's plan,but the constant nagging scraped against his nerves.

His patience snapped. "I'm doing this for lsaac's future, whether you see it or not. Maybe you don't care,but I do. Verena isn't beautiful, she isn't properly educated, and she's completely unfit to be by his side.I don't know what scheme you've got in motion, but disabled or not, Isaac is still the Bennett family's eldest son. He deserves a wife who matches him in every way, not someone far beneath him. How can you ignore what he wants-or what's best for his life?"

The heat in Bobby's words was met with nothing but silence on the other end.
###Chapter 11 Only Such A Woman Was Worthy Of Isaac


A faint, bitter smile tugged at Danica's lips. Isaac was her son, and pretending she didn't care was impossible. But what good was caring when she understood, better than anyone, that the car accident had cost him more than just the use of his legs?

She closed her eyes, the doctor's words still echoing clearly in her mind-the day she found out the crash had also left Isaac with sexual dysfunction. The mix of helplessness and heartbreak had left her feeling empty inside.

News of Isaac's leg injury alone had already sent the media into a frenzy. If news of his sexual dysfunction ever spread, there was no predicting how cruel the rumors would get, or how fast public opinion could turn against their family.

Yes, she had two sons, but their strengths were painfully mismatched. Isaac had the talent to lead but couldn't produce an heir, stripping him of the right to inherit the company. Bobby had the ability to continue the bloodline but lacked the strategic mind for leadership.

That day, Danica vowed to herself that no one would ever learn about Isaac's condition. Determined to secure Isaac's future and keep the company stabe, she acted fast, arranging a marriage planned down to the finest detail. The Willis family was the match she chose.

If she followed Bobby's advice and sought a match with a lady from a powerful, equal-status family, she couldn't be certain they wouldn't one day use Isaac's secret against them. Women from those circles often came with sharp minds, deep schemes, and dangerous family backing. The Willis family, on the other hand,was easy to handle in both power and intellect.

And Verena, raised in a backward region, was either blissfully unaware of the manipulations of city life or too inexperienced to take part in them. A bride like that would be the easiest to control. Even if Verena eventually learned about Isãac's condition, Danica was confident she could ensure the girl stayed silent.

This was something Danica had no intention of letting Bobby find out. Letting out a slow sigh, she said, "You're still too young. Even if I explained, you wouldn't grasp the whole picture. Just concentrate on preparing yourself for the company. Isaac's issues are between him and me.Don't get yourself involved. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting to attend to."

Before Bobby could get a word in, she ended the call.

Glaring at the ended call, Bobby felt irritation churn inside him. Every conversation played out the same.She talked to him as if he were a child, leaving him feeling small and dismissed.

Frustration burned in Bobby's chest, and he spat out a curse before tossing his phone aside.

Unexpectedly, the phone struck the steering wheel, jolting it just enough to send the car swerving off course.

Suddenly, his heart jumped as he spotted a pedestrian right in his path. Bobby then jerked the wheel at the last second, barely avoiding them.

Right as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the car smashed into the roadside barrier.

The airbag burst open, but the sudden swerve sent his head hitting the window.

Bobby felt a warm trickle slide down his temple, and within moments, his vision blurred and faded to nothingness.

Shouts erupted as nearby pedestrians rushed toward the wreck. Someone was already dialing for an ambulance.

Verena, bored and out for a drive, slowed when she spotted several cars stopped ahead. She rolled her window down, curious about the commotion.

Suddenly, a voice rang out over the noise of traffic. "Is there a doctor here? Please! Someone's been in an accident!"

An accident? Verena's brow furrowed.

She unclipped her seatbelt in one swift motion and pushed through the gathering crowd. The wrecked vehicle was a red Ferrari. Through the cracked glass, Verena spotted the driver slumped unconscious behind the wheel.

Turning to the bystanders, she said firmly, "The front's taken a bad hit. There's a chance the fuel line's damaged, and it might catch fire. We have to get him out right now."

At her words, a few sturdy men immediately moved forward to assist.

"Lay him flat," Verena instructed. "And avoid putting pressure on his chest."

Once the man was clear of the car, she dropped to her knees beside him, unbuttoning his clothes layer by layer until she reached his undershirt.

She quickly lifted his eyelids, checked his breathing, and immediately started CPR.

When two complete cycles failed to get a response from the injured man, she continued without pause.

Her composure and precision mirrored the calm efficiency of a trained emergency responder, easing the fear of those watching.

Finally,faint movement flickered in Bobby's eyes.

Verena noticed it instantly, exhaling a quiet breath of relief. He was coming back.

In his haze, Bobby felt like he was stuck in a nightmare. Every heartbeat sent a fresh wave of pain through his skull. A calm, steady voice urged him toward awareness, cool in tone but strangely captivating. Curiosity pulled at him, and with effort, he pried his eyes open.

When Bobby's eyes finally opened, Verena gave him a warm smile. "Good, you're awake. How are you feeling? Any pain or discomfort?"

Her voice was calm and held a soft concern.

Bobby simply looked at her, blinking like he'd momentarily forgotten how to speak.

Thinking he was still groggy from regaining consciousness, Verena asked again,"Other than your head,do you feel pain anywhere else?" Her voice filled Bobby's ears, soft and reassuring, while his gaze stayed fixed on her.

One clear thought settled firmly in his mind-this was exactly what he imagined a perfect sister-in-law should be! Beautiful, elegant, kind, and offering just the right touch of care. Only such a woman was worthy of Isaac.

Verena noticed his unwavering gaze and assumed the accident had left him dazed.

The wail of an approaching siren broke the moment, and the ambulance pulled in beside them. Without drawing attention to herself, she eased back into the crowd.

Bobby wanted to call out, to ask her name, but the paramedics quickly lifted him onto a stretcher and into the ambulance.

From the sidewalk, Verena watched the vehicle speed away. A faint crease appeared between her brows.Was it just her imagination, or had that young man's face looked strangely familiar, like someone she'd seen before?


···

The moment the hospital called, Isaac ordered a driver to take him there without delay.

When he reached the ward, he found Bobby lounging on the bed, casually munching on a banana.

As soon as he spotted Isaac, Bobby hurriedly tossed the fruit aside. "Isaac, you're here."

Isaac didn't answer right away. Instead, he turned to his assistant. "Step outside for now. I'll call if I need you."

With a respectful nod, the assistant slipped out, closing the door behind him.

Rolling his wheelchair forward, Isaac stopped directly in front of Bobby. His eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the bandage wrapped around Bobby's head. "What happened?"

A pang of guilt flickered through Bobby. Ever since the accident that had taken their father's life and left Isaac in a wheelchair, the family had been overly cautious about driving. If Isaac knew he'd been in another accident,he'd worry for sure.Forcing a grin, Bobby waved it off. "It's nothing,just a scratch."

Isaac stayed quiet, his gaze locked on Bobby, unblinking.

Bobby could feel the truth clawing at his throat, and lying to Isaac was impossible.

Looking away, his eyes shifted uneasily. "I just accidentally crashed into the roadside barrier and ended up with a mnild concussion. Nothing serious, just a minor accident."
###Chapter 12 Show Her Respect


Isaac's voice rumbled low, carrying more frustration than he intended. "How many times do you plan on gambling with your life?"

Understanding the concern beneath the reprimand, Bobby dropped his gaze. "I'm sorry for making you worry. Mom's already had enough to bear... We shouldn't give her more to lose sleep over."

Earlier, during the ride to the hospital, Isaac had already pressed for details and confirmed Bobby's injuries weren't serious.

Since that severe car crash, Danica hadn't slept soundly once. He refused to pile more strain onto her.

"Get some rest. I'll arrange for someone to bring you home later," Isaac said evenly. "Leave Mom to me.I have work to deaI with at the company, so I'll head out now."

As Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair toward the door, Bobby's mind flashed back to the aftermath of the accident. His hand shot out, gripping Isaac's arm. "You absolutely can't marry Verena!"

Isaac's jaw tightened. He didn't want to hear it. Given Bobby's condition, he kept his irritation in check. "Let go," he instructed flatly.

The lack of reaction made Bobby's pulse jump. "I'm telling you the truth-Verena's no good. The Willis sisters are both trouble. One family doesn't raise two entirely different kinds of people. The ones who lie easily are the ones with the deepest schemes."

Recalling the elegant stranger he'd seen that day, Bobby leaned forward urgently. "Don't marry her.I already found the perfect woman for you! She's beautiful, kind... she saved me during the crash. Looked about your age too. From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one who could match you. Too bad I didn't get her contact before the medics hauled me off."

With unshakable certainty, Bobby finished his pitch. "Isaac, just go to the Willis family and call off the arrangement. You should marry that incredible woman instead. I'll track her down for you, no matter what. So,what do you say?"

To Isaac, the suggestion sounded nothing short of reckless-naive, even childish.

A faint chill settled in his eyes as he fixed Bobby with a steady stare. "Who taught you to speak about a woman like this behind her back?"

The weight of Isaac's glare robbed Bobby of his next words.

"The arrangement with the Willis family stands," Isaac said, voice cool and resolute. "And I don't want to hear another word of this nonsense."

Turning his wheelchair toward the door, he paused as though remembering something. Without fully facing Bobby, he added, "And for the record, Verena isn't the liar you make her out to be. She will be your sister-in-law, so you'll show her respect. In this family, we don't slander people in their absence."

Isaac's tone carried enough authority to leave Bobby momentarily frozen. Only when the door clicked shut did he release the breath he'd been holding.

Well, this was rich. What kind of game had Verena played to get lsaac on her side after meeting him only once?

The thought only fueled Bobby's resolve. No matter what it took, he would not allow Verena to marry Isaac.Now that he'd found someone who truly matched his brother, there was no way he'd back down.

···

Autumn's breath swept through the streets, scattering golden leaves until they lay thick over the pavement like a gilded carpet.

Muted colors dulled the scenery, giving the city a quiet, almost somber air.

Inside a warmly lit private dining room, two figures sat facing each other-a man and a woman separated by decades in age.

The man, nearing sixty, wore his years in the silver streaks along his temples and the faint creases at the corners of his eyes. Across from him sat Verena, poised and elegant, her hair flowing in a silky cascade down her back, her frame slender and composed.

A genial smile tugged at the man's lips. "Evelyn, ever since we said goodbyes to each other in Clokron, I've been trying to arrange another meeting. It seems this busy bee finally decided to grace me with her presence."

This was Wendell Branson, a distinguished professor at Acorith College of Medicine.

Their acquaintance began in Clokron, where they had collaborated on medical work.

Recognizing the teasing note in his voice, Verena lifted her cup, her expression warm."It's true-personal matters have kept me away. I owe you an apology, Professor Branson."

In those early Clokron days, Wendell's opinion of her had been far from favorable. Her aloof manner and quiet reserve had struck him as a sign of inexperience. But after the ordeal in Dragon Quarter, his view shifted completely. He no longer merely respected her-he admired her. Talented physicians of her age were exceedingly rare, and she was one of the few who stood out beyond doubt.

With a satisfied glint in his eyes, Wendell lifted his cup, letting it gently meet Verena's in a soft chime.

"Evelyn, we've known each other long enough for me to skip the pleasantries," Wendell said warmly."I'd like to extend an official invitation for you to deliver a lecture at our college."

The offer made Verena pause, her thoughts drifting for a moment. Shawna's death on her operating table still lingered like a shadow in her mind, and the occasional tremor in her hand reminded her it hadn't fully passed. Added to that, she'd been pouring her energy into analyzing Isaac's condition, leaving little room for anything else.

Verena's voice held a trace of regret as she responded, "Professor Branson, I truly appreciate the honor.But right now, I have a critical patient who needs my full attention. You understand that preparing for a lecture demands complete focus and precision. At present, I'm overwhelmed. Once this treatment is complete,if your invitation still stands, I'll gladly accept and give it my all.".

Wendell's smile deepened, his tone laced with good humor."Very well, I'll hold you to that. And if you dare refuse me then, I'll tell the whole world that the celebrated young doctor is making a fool of an old man." Verena gave a small nod, her voice steady. "You have my promise."

That answer seemed to genuinely please Wendell. "Alright then. Enjoy your meal. I'll step out for a moment."

Leaving the private room, Wendell made his way toward the restroom.

On the return walk, a voice rang out behind him.

He turned to see a young woman in a blue dress hurrying toward him, her face lighting up.

"Professor Branson, it really is you!" Kaia exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.

Wendell recognized her immediately as one of his most engaged students from Acorith College of Medicine.
"Kaia. I didn't expect to see you here. Are you having a meal here?"

Thinking of Bobby, she nodded with a shy smile. "Yes, I'm here with a friend."

She then asked, "And you, Professor? Are you dining alone?"

"I'm with..." Wendell hesitated for a couple of seconds, remembering Evelyn's preference for privacy.Guessing she wouldn't want to be mentioned, he said, "...someone I look up to."

Kaia's eyes widened. "Someone you look up to? That must be someone truly remarkable!"

Wendell smiled faintly. "Extremely. In fact, one of the most talented young professionas I've ever known."

Eager to continue the conversation and leave a good impression, Kaia quickly said, "That reminds me.I recently bought several medical books, and one of them was by my idol, Evelyn Rowe. Some of the terms and advanced theories are a bit beyond me. Would it be alright if I messaged you later for guidance?"
###Chapter 13 Young Role Model


When Kaia revealed that her idol was Evelyn-the same woman he was dining with-Wendell let out a warm laugh.

Kaia was always active in class. Her genuine love for medicine was impossible to miss, and that spark amused Wendell.

"You're welcome to ask me anything that confuses you,"said Wendell, leaning forward slightly. "Medicine isn't for the faint of heart, but your energy tells me you can handle the challenge. In fact, I've got something you'll want to hear."

Her eyes lit up instantly. "What's that?"

"Evelyn will be giving a lecture at our university this year. Only two hundred seats are available, but I can make sure one of them has your name on it."

The news hit her like a rush of adrenaline. "Are you serious? Evelyn's really coming here to speak?"

"Completely serious," Wendell replied with a certain smile.

Kaia couldn't hold back the excitement that burst out of her before she had the chance to stop it. "Professor Branson, this is incredible! Thank you, thank you so much! Meeting Evelyn has been my dream for as long as I can remember. She's the greatest physician alive in my book."

Wendell brushed her gratitude aside with a light wave. "Save your thanks. I can't keep my role model waiting.Goodbye."

Kaia gave a quick nod, though her curiosity flared. Who could possibly inspire a man like Wendell?

The question tugged at her until she found herself trailing after him at a careful distance.

She watched him disappear into a private dining room, and her gaze stretched toward the doorway.The figure inside was undeniably a woman, and shockingly young. Could someone like that truly be Wendell's 
role model?

Drawn by intrigue, Kaia edged closer to the door. The woman sat turned slightly away, long hair cascading down like a curtain that hid her face completely. No matter how she craned her neck, Kaia couldn't get a proper look.

"The food's gone," said Wendell from inside, his tone light with amusement.

Kaia had just started to lean in for a clearer look when the door shut in front of her. Curiosity lingered, and she still hoped to catch a glimpse of the woman Wendell looked up to. Even so, the thought didn't trouble her for long. What truly mattered now was that she was finally about to meet the person she had admired for years.

Despite the feminine ring of the name Evelyn, Kaia had always pictured the famed medical author as a man -tall, refined, and striking, with the kind of presence that turned heads.

Her mind still busy painting that picture, she pulled out her phone on the way to the restroom and began typing with excitement. "Two incredible reasons to celebrate! Just found out that my lifelong idol, Evelyn Rowe, will be giving a lecture at our school, and Professor Branson has reserved me a spot."

The post took off in seconds, her notifications filling with reactions.

"No way! Are you talking about the legendary surgical genius Evelyn Rowe?"

"Isn't the mysterious doctor supposed to be impossible to track down? Kaia, you're unbelievable! How did you find this out?"

"Evelyn's my inspiration too! I wish I'd gotten into Acorith College of Medicine. Please stream it for us!"

Kaia's chest swelled with pride as the comments poured in. Evelyn's name carried weight, and knowing she was part of that moment made her glow.

Elsewhere in the restaurant, Wendell leaned toward Verena with a grin. "You'll never guess who I bumped into outside-a female student who practically thinks you hung the moon."

"Is that so? Why didn't you bring her over to get my autograph?" Verena teased, one brow raised. Wendell let out a laugh as he gestured toward her. "You're so good at disappearing, I wouldn't even know where to find you if I brought someone by."

Verena took a slow sip of water, entirely unbothered.

After leaving the restroom, Kaia stepped into a different private room.

Smoothing her hair back, she offered a polite smile. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting,Mr.Bennett."

Across the table, Bobby sipped lazily through a straw, not even acknowledging her apology.

Unfazed, Kaia leaned forward slightly. "Speaking of waiting, what happened last time you invited me out?1was there for quite a while."

"Something came up," he said flatly, brushing it aside. "Let's just talk business."

Her brows knitted for a brief moment at his tone, but she quickly smoothed her expression. A man of his standing was bound to carry a certain detachment, she reasoned.

Forcing a pleasant nod, Kaia asked, "All right. What's your plan?"

Bobby said indifferently, "If I had one, we wouldn't be meeting here at all."

When it came to rival companies, Bobby could dream up strategies in his sleep. But taking down a woman who had no real defenses? That wasn't something he had an easy answer for.

Kaia's teeth caught her lower lip as she feigned uncertainty. "Let me think..."

From the moment Bobby brought up the idea of teaming up, Kaia had already begun shaping the perfect setup in her head. Her birthday celebration was just around the corner, and it would be the ideal stage. If Verena happened to get caught stealing something during such a grand affair, the consequences would be swift and irreversible. The Bennett family would never let a woman with a stain like that marry into their family, and the marriage alliance would unravel effortlessly.

Kaia had already pictured the scene where Verena would be publicly embarrassed, and the thought filled her with anticipation.From the beginning, she struggled with the idea of sharing her parents' attention with someone else. The moment she met Verena, she found her cold detachment infuriating. What made things worse was that Verena showed no interest in trying to win her over, not even pretending to be agreeable. That quiet defiance only deepened her resentment.

Still, if anything devious was to happen, she knew better than to let herself appear behind it.

Her brows drew together as she played at thinking hard. "Honestly, I've got nothing. Maybe I should ask a friend of mine. She's never short on ideas."

Bobby saw right through her little act, though he let it slide without a word.

"Fine," he said simply, his tone unreadable.

With phone in hand, Kaia tapped at the screen with exaggerated purpose.

A moment later, she gave a bright little gasp. "She wrote back already!"

The truth was, her inbox was as empty as her performance was rehearsed.

With mock seriousness, she glanced at the screen andthen announced, "She thinks we should set Verena up. Something like making it look like she stole something. The Bennett family wouldn't stomach that in a daughter-in-law, right? Especially when she's already lied to you about her education. That would give your family every reason to call off the arrangement."

Bobby leaned back, his gaze steady and deliberate as it rested on her.

That look chipped at her confidence, and she softened her voice. "You probably think this is too low, don't you?If you want, I'll tell her to forget it."

Bobby watched the way she acted, all sweetness and flair, and sneered inwardly. The whole performance struck him as nothing but a polished lie.

Yet his answer was plain. "If the result works in our favor, the rest doesn't matter."

Their discussion wrapped up quickly after that, and Bobby wasted no time coming up with a reason to leave. Once outside, he reached for his phone and dialed a familiar contact.

Slater answered without hesitation, "What's up?"

"I need an update," Bobby said. "Have you found anything about the woman who pulled me out of trouble that day?"
###Chapter 14 Keep Warm
Bobby's hopeful expression deflated when Slater let out a weary sigh on the other end of the line."It's not that I'm unwilling to help," Slater said, his tone edged with frustration. "But you're giving me nothing solid to work with. Long hair, pretty face, soft voice... you just described half the women walking around downtown.And without cameras in that area, I'd be hunting for a ghost."

A wave of disappointment washed over Bobby. He'd set his heart on finding that perfect sister-in-law,but with so little to go on, he knew Slater couldn't work miracles.

"Fine, fine. Dinner's on me another day. I'll handle it myself," Bobby muttered, forcing a casual tone before ending the call.

...

For the past few days, Verena had buried herself in Isaac's medical records, combing through every detail with painstaking care.

Countless late nights had passed before she finally pinpointed a treatment plan she believed could work.

Closing the thick medical journal in front of her, she pressed her fingers to her temple, easing the dull ache in her head. With her free hand, she reached for her phone on the desk and opened the chat with Isaac.

She typed a short message.e you free?"

When Isaac read the notification, he didn't answer right away.

Since he sent his medical records to her that day, she hadn't reached out once, and he hadn't chased after a reply.

He had only been waiting, quietly, for news he told himself would never come. In his mind, the promise she'd made was nothing more than a moment's kindness. Surely, after seeing the bleak truth in his records, she would have let the matter drop. Seeing her name light up his screen sent an odd, unshakable ripple through Isaac, one he couldn't quite put into words.

His reply came clipped and restrained. "Need anything?"

A brief silence had stretched before Verena finally saw his message. Even in two short words, there was a chill in his tone, a wall he kept firmly between them.

Leaning back in her chair, she tapped out a response. "I've gone over your case thoroughly these past days.Because of your legs' unique complications, surgery will be extremely difficult-and I'm not in the right state to perform it now. But I can begin treatment using traditional medicine."

His brow lifted at that. "Traditional medicine?"

The reaction didn't surprise her, but she guessed he might be uneasy. Her fingers moved quickly over the keys. "Don't worry. My strength lies more in traditional methods than in modern procedures. For your condition, stabilizing it with traditional treatment before surgery gives us the best chance. I'm confident I can achieve a 70% success rate for your recovery."

Isaac's gaze sharpened instantly.

Seventy percent?

That wasn't a casual claim. Doctors were often cautions when talking about success rate, and if she was stating seventy percent outright, it meant the odds of failure were slimmer than most would dare to promise.

Other doctors had never been so bold-most gave him no more than a 30% chance. Yet here was Verena,speaking of 70% as though it were within reach. The number filled him with a strange mix of disbelief and a flicker of hope.

Was she simply reckless, or did she truly have the skill to back it up?

His hands shook slightly as he typed his answer. "Alright. Tell me when you're free, and we'll meet."

Verena replied quickly, "Okay."
 
The send button had barely been tapped before something occurred to her. "By the way, I haven't joined a hospital since returning to the country. When it's time for the operation,the hospital..."

Isaac quickly responded, "That's nothing for you to worry about. I'll see to the arrangements."

At her desk, Verena shifted in her seat, the cool air from the cracked window brushing against her skin.Outside, night had fallen, and the wind whistled low andsharp through the opening.

Clad in only a thin knit sweater, she hugged herself against the chill before rising to latch the window shut.

The movement brought an uninvited memory-Isaac's arms wrapping gently around her from behind, his voice low and cautious. "Verena, it's freezing. Don't push me away... let me keep you warm."

A lighthearted warmth threaded through his words, softened by the hint of teasing.

Much had shifted since those days.

Once, he had managed to win a place in her heart, only for their paths to separate. Then came the accident -a single moment that reshaped the course of his life entirely.

If not for Shawna's critical condition pulling her back home, and the headlines about him flashing across her screen, she might never have learned that his vanishing act had been the aftermath of a devastating car crash.

With that in mind, Verena let her fingers dance over the screen, typing with a sly curve to her lips. "My fiance, the air's turning cold. Keep yourself warm, especially those legs. Use gentle heat therapy, massage them often,keep the muscles working. Don't make me fret over you."

The message reached Isaac mid-thought. His grip faltered, and the pen slipped from his hand, clattering onto the desk before rolling to the floor.

After the accident, his family had cocooned him in silence, skirting around the subject of his injury. Even his last personal doctor, following Danica's orders, avoided speaking the wordin his presence, careful never to graze that raw nerve. The more delicately they tiptoed, the more he felt like something fragile-an artifact too brittle to endure a single crack. But Verena didn't flinch from it. She spoke plainly, giving him steps to care for himself as if nothing set him apart. With her, he felt like any other man. And yet... was she growing a little too at ease with calling him her fiance?

Isaac's gaze darkened slightly, his eyes fixed on the single word fiance as if trying to read between its letters.

"Alright. I'll keep that in mind."

A faint thought tugged at him-had he been too dlistant with her? His thumb moved almost on its own,pressing out another line. "Make sure you stay warm too."

Verena had stepped into the shower after sending the last message. She hadn't expected anything more from him. Yet, stepping out with damp hair and steam curling around her, she spotted two unread messages lighting up her phone-both from Isaac.

The corners of her mouth lifted as she read them, pulling forth a memory of him from before the accident stole pieces of who he was.

People always described Isaac as aloof, untouchable-a man who kept the world at arm's length. But with her, he'd been almost boyishly compliant.

If she was upset, he'd bow his head without hesitation, murmuring, "Alright. I get it. I won't make you upset again."

Shaking herself back into the present, Verena reminded herself of what truly mattered now. His legs came first. Everything else could wait its turn.

...

The evening of Kaia's birthday arrived.

The Willis Villa gleamed under layers of opulent decoration, every corner dressed for grandeur.Down in the sprawling room, a swirl of young socialites filled the space, their laughter and chatter weaving through the music. From the third floor, the sound of laughter floated up in bursts, but Verena ignored it entirely. Slipping into fresh clothes, she left through the villa's side door, heading for the garage.

The sleek black vehicle waiting there was courtesy of Alec.

Whatever existed between Alec and Laura toward her, affection wasn't part of it.

Still, Alec's stance was different from Laura's-where Laura thrived on taking from her, Alec's actions were steeped more in guilt than malice.

Moments later, the black vehicle eased through the villa gates and onto the road.

Meanwhile, a silver Cayenne approached from the opposite direction, Bobby at the wheel.

He wouldn't have bothered showing up for Kaia's birthday if it weren't for the need to block any potential alliance between the two families.

His grip on the steering wheel was relaxed, his pace unhurried.

A passing car caught his attention. At first, it was just a glance-until the half-lowered window revealed the face of a stunning woman at the wheel. His pulse jumped. That face...

"Hey!" Bobby called out, jerking the wheel in a sudden turn before flooring the accelerator to close the distance.

The pursuit didn't go unnoticed. Verena's brows drew together-she couldn't recall crossing anyone who'd have reason to follow her.

A glance at the rearview mirror showed the silver vehicle closing in, irritating her instantly.

With a flick of her wrist, she cut the wheel sharply, sending the black car veering into a new route without hesitation.

###Chapter 15 Failed Plan
The villa district wasn't packed with cars, but the streets split off in every direction.

Verena pressed harder on the accelerator and guided the wheel through turn after turn.

Bobby kept his eyes on her car as it slipped smoothly through each curve. He could tell she'd already spotted him.

She was almost gone from view. His foot hovered over the gas, but he hesitated. That severe crash had scarred their family, and he couldn't risk repeating the past. Still, if he stayed cautious,the perfect woman for his brother would get away.

That tug-of-war in his head cost him precious seconds. By the time he realized it, her car had vanished, and he'd steered straight onto a blocked-off road under construction.

"Damn it!" he exclaimed.

Over at Willis Villa, the party buzzed with chatter.

"Kaia, the clock's ticking. Shouldn't you already be up there kicking off the party?"

"Yeah, didn't you promise you'd choose a partner for the opening dance once things got started? We're dying to find out who the mystery man is."

Kaia's friends' voices carried a playful urgency.

She knew she should be on stage, but Bobby still hadn't shown up. She wanted everyone to see that he'd made the effort to come for her birthday.

Keeping her tone light, she said, "Just a little longer. There's one guest I'm still waiting for."

Her friends exchanged curious glances. "Who could possibly be that important?"

A warm flush spread across Kaia's cheeks. One of them grinned knowingly. "Oh, I see that blush. Don't tell me this 'guest' is more than just a casual acquaintance?"

Inside, Kaia's heart agreed, but she kept her smile composed.

She leaned closer to the young woman who just spoke and deliberately said in a hushed but teasing voice,"Don't spread such rumors. That guest is Bobby Bennett."

The words hung in the air for a beat before gasps and raised brows broke the quiet.

"Seriously? Bobby's actually coming?"

"Wait,did I hear you right? Bobby never shows up to birthday parties unless it's for Slater."

"Kaia, just spill it. What's going on between you two?"

The cluster of women watched her with eager eyes, their curiosity as obvious as their envy.

In her mind, Kaia heard Bobby's voice again, praising her for her kindness. She had never been certain about his feelings, but the way her friends were talking planted a hopeful thought.

Men liked gentle, genuine women. Bobby wasn't one to fake his words. That had to mean something...right?

Her face warmed, the heat creeping into her cheeks.

Thirty minutes had slipped by, yet there was still no sign of Bobby anywhere.

The same women who had envied her earlier now leaned close to whisper.

"Strange. She was so sure Bobby wouuld be here, but it's been forever."

"Do you think he ditched her?"

"Shh, lower your voice before she hears."

Kaia was standing close enough to catch every word. The anticipation she'd carried all evening curled into embarrassment.

Her fingers tightened around her glass. Pushing down the sting, she moved gracefully from guest to guest, raising her glass with the same practiced smile.

One gulp drained her wine. With her smile stilI fixed, she slipped onto the balcony and pulled out her phone.

Meanwhile, Bobby remained stranded on that half-finished road.

The place was nearly deserted, and the darkness only made it harder to find his way.

Bobby finally called for someone to pick him up. But before he could even pocket his phone, it lit up with another call.

Before Bobby could even say hello, an urgent voice rushed through the line. "Mr. Bennett, the party's starting any minute. When can we expect you?"

Getting the chance to meet the woman he thought could be the perfect sister-in-law should have been a win, yet he'd ended up chasing her straight onto a road closed for repairs. Losing sight of her and winding up lost had already soured his mood, and now Kaia's call pressed him for answers.

"I won't be making it," he said sharply. "If you still want to move ahead with the plan against Verena,have Slater take over. Call him yourself."

To anyone looking in from the outside, Bobby and Slater were nearly inseparable. So when Bobby had agreed to show up for Kaia's birthday, Slater had casually decided to go too.

Her stomach dropped at his words. Was he really bailing? After she'd told everyone he was coming? The thought of facing the guests now made her skin prickle.

Kaia fought to keep her temper in check and spoke in a calm tone. "Mr. Bennett, is there something pressing that's holding you up? We made an agreement to work side by side, yet the plan hasn't even begun and now you're pulling away?"

Rather than explain, Bobby ended the call without another word, unwilling to waste more time.

The flat tone on the line made Kaia's grip on her phone tighten. Heat rose to her face and her breathing grew uneven, the sting of frustration sharp in her chest.

But she forced herself to remember the bigger picture-Verena's wedding to Isaac needed to be stopped, and that mattered more than her pride right now.

Pushing the anger down, she pulled up Slater's contact and hit call.

The call went through without delay, and Kaia spoke without preamble. "Hi, Slater, this is Kaia. Are you around?"

In truth, his familiarity with her was minimal. Most of what he knew came from Bobby, and nothing in those accounts made her seem like someone he could fully trust.

Slater had never approved of Kaia, yet politeness kept his tone steady as he said, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis.My grandfather suddenly fell ill, and I need to stay with himn. I can't leave right now, but I'll make sure someone delivers a gift on my behalf."

Normally, receiving a gift from someone of Slater's influence would have been enough to make Kaia's evening. Tonight, however, was about more than her birthday-it was the perfect chance to deal with Verena, and his absence was a blow.

"Alright, I understand," she replied, though the stiffness in her voice betrayed her disappointment.

The call ended, and her jaw tightened. So muchfor help-at the moment she needed allies the most, they all had somewhere else to be. Looked like she'd have to handle this herself.

Taking the stairs two at a time, she headed for the last room at the far end of the third-floor hall.

Her knuckles rapped against the door, and her voice carried through it. "Verena, it's me. The party's started -come downstairs."

Not a single word came back to her.

A twinge of unease crept in. She twisted the handle and stepped inside.

The quiet inside the room felt heavy. She called Verena's name again as she crossed the space, but the silence stayed unbroken.

Though part of her already suspected the truth, she moved methodically, unwilling to overlook even the smallest hiding place. The bathroom was empty. So was the wardrobe. Not a single sign of anyone.

Hands curling into fists, she turned to leave, spotting a servant walking past in the corridor.

"Have you seen Verena?" she asked sharply.

The servant shook her head. "No, Miss.I haven't."

Kaia's temper flared. Not seen Verena? As if she could simply vanish without notice.

Kaia wondered when Verena had left and how she had missed it.
###Chapter 16 Stop Bothering Me


"Alright. Go finish your work," Kaia said, her words clipped and cold.

The moment the servant disappeared down the hall, her restraint shattered. Fists tightening in midair, she swept the stack of files off Verena's desk without even glancing at them, the papers scattering as she stormed out.

She returned to the ground floor living room still wearing the same hard expression.

Laura had just wrapped up chatting with a group of guests when she spotted Kaia's look. Concern etched her face as she crossed the room.

Her hand rested lightly on Kaia's cheek. "Sweetheart, is something bothering you? You don't seem like yourself.Are you alright?"

It wasn't sickness draining the color from Kaia's face-it was the heat of her anger.

Her teeth pressed into her lower lip as she forced the emotion down, but her eyes began to glisten,reddening until they looked ready to spill over.

Just as expected, the sight of her in that state threw Laura off balance. "Honey, what happened? Did someone give you trouble? Just say the word and I'll take care of it."

A small sniffle escaped as Kaia answered in a trembling voice, "No one's bullying me, Mom. I'm just... really disappointed."

"Disappointed?" Laura asked, brows knitting. "About what?"

Drawing in a steadying breath, Kaia lowered her voice."It's my eighteenth birthday. I was so happy, because for the first time, my friends and the whole family were here to celebrate. I went upstairs to bring Verena down so we could cut the cake together, but-"
 
The rest was carried away by a tear that finally broke free. Laura's mouth tightened. "So? She refused to come?"

Kaia's head moved slowly from side to side. "I knocked, but no one answered. When I opened the door... she wasn't even there."

Laura's frown grew more pronounced, and Kaia pressed her teeth into her lip, doing her best to mask the quiet hint of triumph tugging at her mouth. Her tone turned soft and uncertain. "It's my eighteenth birthday,a huge milestone for me, bout Verena didn't even show up. Mom... do you think she can't stand me? Did I mess up so badly she's going out of her way to stay away?"

Tears slid down her cheeks, completing the picture of wounded innocence.

The sight made Laura's heart ache, and she pulled Kaia into her arms.

"No, sweetheart, of course not. You're wonderful-anyone would like you. This isn't about you. It's Verena's fault. She grew up in a backwater place and still hasn't adjusted to city life."

Even in their quiet corner, a few guests glanced over at the scene.

Laura's hand stroked Kaia's shoulder. "Don't cry, people are watching. Go and mingle with the guests. I'll talk to Verena myself."

With a quick dab at her eyes, Kaia nodded. "Alright, Mom. But please don't be too hard on her. Maybe...maybe something more important came up."

That hint of generosity softened Laura's expression, though it sharpened her annoyance toward Verena.

Laura's tone sharpened with irritation as she spoke. "She's got nothing going on all day,so what could possibly matter more than showing up for your eighteenth birthday?"

Kaia caught the look on Laura's face and knew Verena was in fora scolding. The sting from her earlier setback began to fade.

After a few more soft words between them, Kaia straightened her posture and returned to the party, her smile back in place.

Once she was gone, Laura stepped outside to the quiet of the backyard, pulling her phone from her pocket to make a call.

Out on the road, Verena glanced at her ringing phone, the caller ID confirming exactly what conversation was waiting for her.

The moment Verena picked up, Laura's voice came fast and sharp. "Where are you? It's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Why aren't you here? Get back right now!"

With one hand steady on the wheel, Verena gave a quiet, amused chuckle. "Can you explain why I'm supposed to care about Kaia's birthday party?"

That answer nearly made Laura snap-Verena had never been one to obey her.

"She's your sister! How can you act like it has nothing to do with you? It's not often we're all together for Kaia's birthday, and you just slipped away like it didn't matter. What's going on with you? Do you really need a personal invitation before you'll bother to come?"

Verena let out a cold, disdainful scoff at that. So this was what Laura called a family celebration? The truth was laughable. All Laura wanted was to parade her around like some prized token-to show everyone that the Willis family had opened their arms to the girl raised far from privilege. That kind of story, if told the right way,would polish the family name like nothing else.

Exposing Laura's motives wasn't worth the effort.

A sharp laugh escaped Verena's lips before she spoke. "So now you remember me because it's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Funny, because where were you when it was mine? Where was the family then? Or did I stop counting as family back then?"

Laura went quiet. A flicker of guilt pricked at her, but it was gone almost as quickly as it came.

Verena had a clear sense of what was running through Laura's mind, but she also knew that any flicker of guilt would fade quickly, especially with Kaia and Luka nearby, soaking up all her affection.

Verena's voice turned cold. "I told you before, stop bothering me. What I said before was a threat,and I mean it. Keep pestering me over these petty things, and I'Il make sure you don't get anything you're after." Verena ended the call without waiting for a reply.

Verena's words left Laura frozen, too shocked to form a response. It wasn't until the dull,mechanical tone buzzed in her ear that the full weight of Verena's rudeness hit her. That tone, that attitude-who did she think she was, speaking to her like that?

Laura's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white, her face clouded with fury. I it weren't for the party already underway and guests mingling throughout the place, she would've ordered someone to haul Verena back for a proper scolding.

...

Elsewhere, barely a mninute after ending the call, Verena's phone lit up again.

Expecting Laura to continue her tirade, she glanced at the screen and saw a different name-Barrie Lyons,a former patient.

She answered without hesitation, "Mr. Lyons, what's going on?"

The reply came in an older, slightly hoarse voice. "Dr. Willis, are you still overseas?"

"I'm not," Verena responded plainly. "I'm back. In Shoildon, actually."

"That's excellent news. I'm in Shoildon too," Barrie replied, the relief clear in his tone.

He wasted no time getting to the point. "The old problem with my right leg started acting up again. The pain hit so hard earlier I almost lost consciousness. I had a doctor come to the house, but nothing he did made a difference. I've finished the medicaton you prescribed. If it's not too much trouble, would you be able to come by?"

Verena had no real obligations that evening. She simply needed to breathe away from the suffocating atmosphere of the Willis Villa. So availability wasn't the problem. And when it came to her own patients, she never hesitated-no matter the hour, she always made it a priority to reach them as soon as possible.

"Of course," she said. "Send me your address, and I'll head over now."

Barrie dictated the location, and Verena keyed it into her GPS.

Her foot pressed harder on the gas, the car picking up speed.
###Chapter 17 Beautiful Yet Untouchable


Less than an hour later, Verena pulled up outside a sprawling private estate where a middle-aged man stood waiting at the gate.

The moment she stepped out, the man walked briskly toward her. "You must be Dr. Willis, right?"

When she nodded to confirm it, he said warmly, gesturing for her to follow, "Great, this way."

They moved through the corridors and entered a room lined with gleaming display cases, each one filled with medals and awards. An elderly man lay propped on a bed, sweat beading his forehead as a younger man helped him sip water.

"Bring the medical kit-now," Barrie instructed as soon as he spotted Verena.

His gaze shifted to the younger man. "Slater, get a chair for Dr. Willis."

Slater grabbed a chair without delay, but when he turned around and was about to gesture for Dr. Willis to sit, he froze, his attention caught entirely by the woman before him.

The first thing that stuck him was how effortlessly beautiful she was-delicate features framed by an air of quiet confidence. The second was disbelief. Could this poised young woman really be the famed Dr. Willis his grandfather often praised?

He gave a quick blink, forcing himself back to the moment before offering her a courteous smile. "Please,Dr. Willis, take this seat."

"Thank you," Verena replied, her tone warm as she accepted.

The smile she gave him felt like the first breath of spring air after a long winter.

A simple curve of her lips shouldn't have left an impression, yet it stirred something faint in his chest.

While he steadied himself, theservants entered with the prepared medical instruments. Verena reached for a pair of scissors, glancing at Barrie. "I'll need to cut the fabric above your knee to examine the injury "Do whatever you must," Barrie said firmly, not flinching despite the sweat sliding down his temple.

With a swift and steady motion, she sliced the trouser leg cleanly up to the thigh, her movements practiced and precise.

The damage beneath was impossible to miss-skin swollen tight, bruises blooming around the wound.

It wwas the same leg that had carried a bullet wound from Barrie's youth, a reminder of the battle that left him with a burden he would never fully escape.

The injury had happened years back, but the pain never truly left him. As the seasons shifted from autumn to winter, it flared with such intensity that sleep became a rare luxury, whether it was day or night.

Gasps rippled through the room the moment everyone caught sight of the swollen knee.

Concern etched itself across Slater's face as his gaze lingered on the injury.

Without letting her expression shift, Verena leaned closer for a precise look. "I'm going to begin with the treatment. It might sting, so try to hold still."

A dry chuckle escaped Barrie. "I've endured worse in my time. This willbe nothing."

"You still carry the grit of a soldier, Mr. Lyons," Verena replied, the praise genuine in her tone.

Their history as doctor and patient meant Barrie knew what kind of tools she might need and had them prepared.

Though the world knew her for her surgical skill, her deepest strength lay in the art of traditional medicine.

One of the driving forces behind her studies in Clokron had been the desire to unite the best of both traditional and modern medicine, giving her patients every advantage in recovery.

From the medical bag, she drew out an assortment of silver needles, each chosen for a specific point, and placed them with flawless precision.

From the corner, Slater watched the confident rhythm of her hands, the quiet focus in her eyes,and couldn't help but be struck by how capable she seemed.

Once the final needle was in place, Barrie's face had turned ashen, and the veins along his forehead throbbed visibly beneath his skin.

"My grandfather looks like he needs water," Slater said, his brow knitting in worry.

Still jotting notes onto a prescription pad, Verena responded flatly, "That won't be necessary. This reaction is expected. He'll be fine in a moment."

Her words proved true. Within minutes, the strain in Barrie's face eased, color returned, and the chill in his leg was replaced by a spreading warmth.

"Only you can take away this pain, Dr. Willis," Barrie remarked, relief clear in his voice.

Slater exhaled slowly, the tension leaving his shoulders, though amazement still lingered.

His eyes shifted to Verena, who sat with her head gently bowed, completely focused on jotting down the prescription. A few loose strands framed her face, and there was something quietly captivating in the way she moved. It made it nearly impossible to pull his gaze away.

Many women had caught Slater's eye before, yet none carried the kind of presence Verena did. What he felt wasn't the fleeting thrill of attraction, but something sharper, weightier-an awareness that she stood on a level far above his reach.

It wasn't the pull of romance; it was the quiet reverence a person might feel when looking at the moon,knowing it was beautiful yet untouchable.

Twenty minutes passed before Verena began removing the silver needles from Barrie's leg with practiced care.

"The medicine's ready," she said, her tone calm but deliberate. "This time, Mr. Lyons, you need to stick to the plan. Your condition's been dragged out far too long. We might not be able to heal it completely, but we can take most of the pain away. Take the medicine, rest properly, and in this weather-keep warm at all times." Barrie, who once commanded the room like a general, now looked almost shy.

"Thank you, Dr. Willis. I'll take your advice seriously this time," he said with a sheepish chuckle.

The change in him caught Slater off guard. He wasn't used to seeing his grandfather defer to anyone.

Seeing Barrie's sheepish look, Verena offered a light smile. "It's getting late. I should be going."

Just as she was getting ready to leave, Barrie turned to Slater and spoke without hesitation."Make sure you settle the payment with Dr. Willis."

She shook her head, still smiling. "There's no fee. I didn't provide the medicine or the tools. Just spent some time on the treatment. Besides, after everything you've done for our country,helping you is an honor."

A man like Barrie, a soldier who had fought and bled for his country, was someone she held in the highest regard.

Her words seemed to warm him even more.

"You're young, yet your skills are outstanding, and your manner is even better," he said with genuine admiration.

Then his eyes shifted toward Slater, mischief creeping into his voice. "If my grandson were as capable as you, I'd have encouraged him to try to win you over."

Slater's cheeks flushed the moment he heard those words. "Come on, Grandpa, where did that even come from?"

Used to handling moments like this with grace, Verena offered a steady, courteous reply. "Your grandson is devoted and respectful. I'm sure the woman he marries will be someone truly special."

Barrie had already braced himself for her refusal to give his grandson a chance, but even so, a faint sense of regret settled in. A granddaughter-in-law like her was simply out of reach.

###Chapter 18 Ideal Sister-In-Law VS Traditional Medicine Doctor


After Verena walked out, Slater's curiosity got the better of him. He turned to his grandfather and asked,"Grandpa, this Dr. Willis seems incredible. Who exactly is she?"

Instead of answering directly, Barrie posed his own question. "When you first laid eyes on her, did it cross your mind that someone so young might not be capable?"

Slater gave an awkward scratch to his nose but admitted with a nod that he had thought so.

A proud smile spread across Barrie's face as his eyes lit up. "She's the surgeon who gave me my new heart in Clokron."

Shock spread across Slater's face. "You mean she really did that?"

Remembering how deftly Verena had handled the traditional treatment earlier, Slater tilted his head. "But isn't she a traditional medicine doctor? How could she manage a heart transplant?"

Barrie laughed softly and spoke with weight in his voice. "She's a rare talent."

It wasn't often that Slater heard such praise from his grandfather. The more he thought about it, the more respect he felt for the striking Dr.Willis.

As the night wore on, Slater applied medicine to Barrie's wound. Once the treatment was finished and his grandfather had drifted into sleep, he stepped quietly from the room.

That was when his phone buzzed with a call from Bobby.

Without any small talk, Bobby asked, "Why weren't you at Kaia's birthday party tonight either?"

He had just arrived home and called Kaia, planning to check on the outcome of the night. Instead, she told him that neither he nor Slater had been there, and worse, Verena had been absent too, which meant the plan had fallen apart.

Kaia's voice trembled over theline, carrying the sound of hurt and frustration. Bobby wasn't overly concerned about the failed attempt. Since Verena wasn't marrying Isaac immediately,there would be other chances to make sure the wedding never happened. What he truly wanted to know at that moment was why Slater had stayed away.

Once Bobby gave Kaia a few words of comfort, he ended the call and immediately rang Slater.

As he walked back to his room, Slater explained why he hadn't shown up at the party. "I was on my way out the door when my grandfather started feeling worse again. I couldn't leave him like that, so I stayed with him instead."

Knowing the seriousness of the old man's health, Bobby's voice grew concerned right away. "How is he doing now?"

Slater thought of the calm, dignified face before answering, "Relax, an incredible doctor stopped by and used a special kind of traditional treatment. He's doing fine now."

Relief washed over Bobby's voice. "Glad to hear that."

Only then did Slater realize something about Bobby's earlier question. "Hold on. You asked me why I weren't at Kaia's party EITHER. Does that mean you weren't there either?"

A long sigh came through the phone. "Don't get me started," Bobby retorted. "On my way to the WVillis Villa,I ran into the woman I consider my ideal sister-in-law, but I ended up losing track of her."

That statement left Slater confused. "Your ideal sister-in-law? I thought you couldn't stand Verena. Since when did she become your ideal sister-in-law?"

A short, dismissive scoff came from Bobby. "I'm not talking about that liar."

His thoughts drifted back to the day of his car accident. In his hazy state on the ground, he had opened his eyes to see a striking face and heard a soft, reassuring voice.

"I mean the gorgeous woman who pulled me out of that wreck,", he continued.

The memory of that moment and what happened tonight had him grinning like a man hopelessly smitten."You know what happened? She drove past me tonight with her hair down, and for a second,I saw her through the half-lowered window. She looked incredible. Even as she broke away from my pursuit, all I could think was that I'd never seen anyone so effortlessly cool. If you'd been there, you would've felt the same.There's something about her that just pulls you in. She's stunning. That's exactly why I keep saying she's perfect to be my sister-in-law!"

By the end, his tone brimmed with enthusiasm, pride spilling into his words as though she were already part of his family and he was boasting to his closest friend.

Slater narrowed his eyes in doubt. "That sounds over the top. Is she really as impressive as you claim?"

Thinking of the woman who had treated his grandfather, Slater let out a laugh before Bobby could reply.With a hint of rivalry in his tone, he said, "That woman you keep calling your ideal sister-in-law doesn't even come close to the traditional medicine doctor I met tonight. She's thoughtful, well-spoken, and carries herself with real grace. Her skills are no joke-just a few needles and some herbs, and my grandfather was finally able to rest. And honestly, she's beautiful too."

Bobby gave a dismissive snort. "No way. The woman I've set my sights on is far more beautiful. You must not have seen many real beauties to think otherwise."

A sly grin crept into his voice as he teased, "Slater, has your sense of beauty gone downhill lately?"

The moment his taste was mocked, Slater responded instantly, "Look who's talking. I'm willing to bet that your so-called ideal sister-in-law is just a plain-looking nobody."

Bobby's eyes went wide as he practically yelled into the phone. "Don't you dare insult my ideal sister-in-law!"

Slater kept pushing. "Who even is your sister-in-law? She doesn't know you, yet you're bold enough to claim her as your family."

The heat rose in Bobby's face, turning it a deep red, and his neck stiffened as he argued back without holding anything in.

Neither willing to back down, the two young men, barely past their teens, bickered like schoolboys until the argument fizzled out without a winner. Verena had spent the night studying Isaac's condition, working until nearly dawn before finally falling asleep.By the time she opened her eyes again, the clock was edging toward noon.

Her phone lay beside her pillow, and she picked it up to send a message to lsaac.

"Do you have time later today? I'd like to sit down with you and talk through the specifics of your treatment."

Isaac was on his way to a press conference when her message came through.

Reading her words made him pause for a moment, his mind turning to the thought of surgery.Other doctors weren't positive about his leg condition. He wondered if going under the knife was even possible.

A swirl of emotions moved through Isaac, tinged with unease, yet the pull of anticipation was impossible to ignore. More than anything, he wanted to walk again and return to living as he once had.

Dropping his gaze, Isaac let his long thumb tap across the keyboard. "I'm available. If it works for you, we can meet right now."

When Verena read his reply, she could clearly see the depth of his desire to regain the use of his legs.

She answered simply, "Of course."

Not long after she sent her message, Isaac followed up with a list of restaurants offering various cuisines.

Verena picked one from the list and responded, "See you soon."

Once the message was sent, she set her phone aside and climbed out of bed to freshen up.

Isaac pocketed his phone and gave the driver a clear order. "Take us back and drive straight to Milo's Gourmet."

With a respectful nod, the driver replied, "Yes." He then steered the car into a U-turn at the intersection.

Though uncertain, the assistant seated up front still spoke up. "Mr. Bennett, should we just forget about the press conference..." Isaac's tone remained light. "There are plenty of people handling it. They don't need me there just for appearances."


What he said was the truth. His attendance at the event served no real purpose beyond ceremony.
###Chapter 19 Familiarity


The past weeks had drained Isaac, leaving him running on barely four hours of sleep from the night before.Events like this hardly seemed worth his time.

Reading his mood, the assistant simply replied, "Understood. I'll let them know."

Roughly an hour later, Verena's car rolled up to the venue.

The restaurant radiated charm-every corner was dressed in elegance, with subtle touches of romance that softened the air.

A waiter greeted her at the entrance and led her toward a secluded private room.

Pausing at the door, he knocked, and then pushed it open with a polite announcement."Mr. Bennett,your guest has arrived."

Verena stepped inside, and the door closed quietly behind her.

From his wheelchair, Isaac's gaze followed her every step.

Her white dress brushed her ankles, a camel shawl resting gently on her shoulders, while her hair spilled down her back likea glossy waterfall.

There were no designer tags or ostentatious brands on her, yet she carried herself with a presence that made society's most polished women seem ordinary. The old saying came to mind-true elegance was born from beauty, figure, and poise. She possessed all three in abundance.

For the briefest moment, something familiar stirred in Isaac's mind... but before he could pin it down, the feeling slipped away.

Seeing Isaac's gaze fixed on her, Verena smiled warmly and greeted him, "Mr. Bennett, it's been a while."

That smile of hers hit him harder than expected, and for a fleeting second, Isaac felt like a thief caught in the act of staring. Inclining his head, he said evenly, "Please, take a seat, Miss Willis."

Verena didn't bother with pleasantries. She sat down and spoke with clarity. "I've reviewed every detaii of your medical records. It's not as severe as it seems. Just set a date, and we can start treatment."

His fingers tightened slightly on the armrest before he asked, "You're the first doctor to sound this certain.Are you absolutely sure?"

She could tell his doubt wasn't directed at her, but at the disappointment he'd endured. Hope was a fragile thing for someone who had been let down too many times.

Leaning forward, she laced her fingers beneath her chin and met his eyes. "You told me you'd trust me. So why hesitate now?"

Her voice carried a gentle lilt, almost coaxing.

Isaac blinked, his gaze sliding away as though her eyes were too much to hold.

Her lips curved in amusement. "What's wrong? Do you truly not believe me?"

His head lifted instinctively, only to find her watching him with a brightness that seemed to outshine the rest of the room. He turned away almost instantly.

After a short pause, his voice dropped to a quiet, "Sorry."

Something about his own reaction unsettled him. Other women never rattled his composure, yet around Verena, the steady ground he stood on felt uncertain-like he was in unfamiliar territory with no map to guide him.

Catching the way he avoided her gaze, Verena remained silent for a moment, and then let out a soft,playful laugh.

Isaac's eyes lifted toward her, catching the curve of her smile.

A faint crease formed between his brows. "You..."

"What's with the solemn face, Mr. Bennett?" she asked, her tone light. The sound of her laughter held an unfamiliar warmth, so unlike her usual composed reserve, carrying an ease that felt almost inviting.

Realizing she was poking fun at him, Isaac's lips curved in a faint, reluctant smile.

When the waiter arrived with their food, the mood shifted into something more casual, their conversation flowing lightly.

Isaac kept his answers brief, letting Verena guide most of the exchange.

They hadn't gotten far when the waiter, stepping back after setting down a plate, accidentally brushed the edge of the thin blanket over Isaac's knees with the walkie-talkie clipped to his pocket, sending it tumbling to the floor.

The man immediately murmured an apology, but Verena was already on her feet. "Don't worry about it, 1'lI handle it," she said quickly.

Isaac's gaze followed her as she bent to retrieve it and walked toward him, a subtle frown crossing his face.

Knowing Isaac cared about cleanliness, Verena had stopped the waiter's intention to pick up the blanket and put it back on his legs.

She shook out the blanket neatly and set it on the chair beside him, her movements smooth and deliberate.

Isaac had just opened his mouth to refuse when Verena knelt gracefully at his side.

Without a word, she slipped the shaw from her shoulders and spread it carefully across his legs,her fingertips lingering as she smoothed the fabric, grazing his thighs in fleeting touches.

He, however, felt no sensation in his legs-only a strange mix of unease and familiarity as he studied her closeness. Why did it feelas though this level of tenderness belonged to a deeper bond? Was it merely because she was his future wife?

"This blanket is far too thin. Make sure you swap it for something warmer when you're home," Verena murmured.

When he looked up again, she was back in her seat, the table between them once more. His eyes drifted toward her hands, and his voice came quietly. "Thanks."

Her gaze swept over him, a faint crease forming on her brow. "Why's your face suddenly flushed?"

That made him blink, caught off guard.

She ddn't look away, noting the warm tint across his cheeks and the slight haze clouding his eyes.

Rising, Verena stepped to his side, gently pushing back his hair to rest her palm against his forehead.

As she leaned in to check his temperature, her body closed the space between them.

Isaac's spine went rigid as a faint, soothing fragrance drifted into his senses, his line of sight now framed by her flawless features.

A sharp thud of awareness struck his chest.

Lowering his gaze, he felt his pulse quicken beyond reason.

Without the shawl on her shoulders now, the elegance of her silhouette beneath the snug knit dress became more obvious.

A knot formed in his throat, and he almost turned away-until her firm voice cut in, "Stay still."

Though her tone carried an edge, it oddly wrapped him in a sense of comfort.

Isaac's head dipped instinctively, eyes closing as his fingers clamped hard around the wheelchair's armrests.



"You're running a fever," Verena murmured with a slight frown, pressing the call button on the table.

She had assumed his flushed face was from embarrassment, but clearly, it wasn't.

A waiter appeared moments later.

With calm politeness, she suggested, "Please bring some fever medicine."

The server nodded and departed without delay. When the medicine arrived, she scanned the instructions, poured a glass of water, and extended both toward him. "Here, take these."

"Thank you." Isaac studied the pills inhis palm before asking quietly, "Why do you..."

The question hovered on his tongue-why did she care about him so much?

Halfway through forming the words, his gaze locked with the lively light in Verena's eyes. A quiet chuckle escaped him, and he gave a small shake of his head. "Forget it."

After he swallowed the pills, she leaned back slightly and asked, "Have you decided on the hospital for the operation? Once we finish the first stage of treatment, surgery will still be necessary." 
###Chapter 20 What Makes You Trust Her This Much


With a small nod, Isaac said, "I've already chosen one. It's a private hospital that belongs to the Bennett family."

Verena took note of how unwell he seemed. "That's good. The privacy there will be secure," she said. "WNe'll stop here for today. Just let me know once you've decided on the exact date for the treatment."

Almost without hesitation, Isaac answered,"A week from now."

Once the time was set, the two went their separate ways.

When Isaac settled back into his car, his observant assistant immediately noticed that the "blanket"covering his lap was not the same as before.

"Did something happen, Mr. Bennett?" the assistant asked.

The stare from the front seat was hard to miss. Isaac opened the file resting on his lap and gave a short cough. "It's nothing."

Catching the strain in his voice, the assistant asked, "Are you feeling sick?"

Without looking up from the file, Isaac replied in a steady tone, "I've got a fever."

"I can run out and get some medicine right now," the assistant suggested.

"I already have some," Isaac said. "Just keep this from mny mother."

Since the accident, Danica had been quick to worry whenever his health showed even the slightest decline.

The assistant knew better than most how protective Danica had become.

"Understood," the assistant replied with a nod.

The mention of medicine brought Isaac's thoughts back to the restaurant, to the moment he nearly asked Verena why she treated him with such care. What was the reason behind her concern? Part of him assumed it was nothing more than a fiancée's obligation. Perhaps the Bennett family had something she wanted.

Yet beneath those guesses lingered a faint, unshaped hope-though even he could not say exactly what it was.

Out of nowhere, Isaac remembered the two questions Verena had asked him in the past. The first had been on the day they met, when she wanted to know if he recalled anything about Dragon Quarter in Clokron.

The second had come through a message, where she asked if he truly did not remember her.

A strange, hard-to-name feeling surged through him, clouding his thoughts.

He shut the file in front of him, leaned back against the seat, and pressed his fingers to his brow in an effort to clear his head and push aside the thoughts he didn't need.



That afternoon, Isaac's phone rang. It was his friend, Cayden Moore.

Cayden said, "Stop by the hospital tomorrow. I'll go ahead and run a few tests while you're there."

A master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine, Cayden had built an impressive reputationin his field.


Following the car accident, the Bennett family had called in other renowned doctors to examine Isaac, but Cayden was the one who had consistently been at his side.

With only a week left before the scheduled treatment with Verena, Isaac felt that Cayden deserved to know the situation as both his doctor and his friend.

He chose to be upfront about it and said, "I'm scheduled for surgery next week."

"What? Hold on-what are you talking about?" Cayden's voiçe jumped in alarm. "What kind of surgery?What exactly do you mean?"

Isaac answered, "I found a doctor who believes she can treat my condition with a decent chance of success.She says it's around seventy percent, and I'm willing to take that shot."

"Say that again?" Cayden's disbelief was clear, as if he couldn't trust his own hearing. "Seventy percent?Who would dare make that claim? Even I can only be thirty percent confident with your case."

The frustration in his voice lingered before he paused, and then spoke more carefully. "Isaac, I get that you're eager to get back on your feet, but this isn't something you can rush. Don't let desperation push you into a reckless decision."

From his wheelchair, Isaac stared out at the view from the office building.

"I understand," he said quietly. The memory of those eyes, so familiar they almost hurt to remember, rose in his mind. "But I want to trust her."

Cayden's curiosity burned to know who had convinced Isaac of something so far-fetched. "Tell me her name.Which world-class doctor is it?"

"Verena Willis," Isaac answered.

The name made Cayden search his memory. He was familiar with countless renowned physicians across the globe, yet this one drew a blank.

"Who exactly is she? I've never heard of her. What's her story?" Cayden asked further.

Isaac hesitated. Her background? Should he tell Cayden she was the eldest daugter of the Willis family,or admit she was his future wife?

The image of Verena kneeling before him flashed through Isaac's mind, her voice soft as she said, "Don't turn me away." He paused, his throat tightening for a moment, and then quietly answered, "She's my fiancée."

That single word froze Cayden in place, leaving him silent for a few moments.

"What did you just say?" he asked wth a frown. "Isn't your fiancée the eldest daughter of the Willis family who didn't grow up with her parents?"

Cayden normally tunedout that kind of news, but beca use Isaac was a friend, he'd picked up a few things Cayden continued, his voice rising, "Isaac, have you even heard what people are saying about her? She never attended college, so where exactly did she learn how to practice medicine? She's even been lying about graduating from Pine Hill University. And you've only had one meal with her, haven't you? What makes you trust her this much?"

Isaac barely drew in a breath before Cayden interjected, "Absolutely not. A woman like that cannot be trusted.Wait before you do anything reckless. I'll dig into her background myself."

Isaac started to reply, but the call had already ended. His forehead tightened in an involuntary frown.Cayden's logic was hard to argue with. After all, he had met Verena only once. Why did he trust her so much? Yet the way his friend dismissed Verena left an unpleasant weight in his chest.

Respected as a promising young physician, Cayden was often invited back to his old university to give lectures.

When his last class wrapped up that afternoon, he had intended to begin gathering information, only to spot Kaia walking down the corridor.

The sight made his eyes brighten. As Verena's sister, she might be the perfect source to question.

He strode toward her and called out, "Kaia."

She was moving alongside two other women, heading for their next lesson.

The sound of Kaia's name made her companions exchange curious glances in her direction.

A flicker of pleasure crossed Kaia's face. She was well aware that Cayden was one of Isaac's closest friends.Though his status didn't rival Isaac's, it still far exceeded her own.

At their university, Cayden held the quiet admiration of many female students.

She slid a stray lock of hair behind her ear and offered him a warm smile. "Professor Moore, is something the matter?"

Cayden inclined his head slightly. "I need to ask you a question. Are you free right now?" Kaia looked at her friends. They traded looks full of envy before slipping away to give them space.

Their reactions made Kaia feel a surge of pride, and she replied with a warm smile, "It's my pleasure to help you,Professor Moore."

Cayden wasted no time. "Did your sister Verena study medicine?"

The question left her momentarily speechless. He had stopped her just to bring up Verena? First Bobby, and now Cayden. People she had once admired from afar and never dreamed of approaching were suddenly seeking her out, all because of her sister.
###Chapter 21 I'm Here To Pick Up Miss Verena Willis


Kaia seethed inwardly. If these people wanted to know all about Verena, then she would paint them a picture of just how "outstanding" Verena was. For a split second, she did not feel so let down.

She straightened up right away, and then spoke with an offhand tone. "Verena is, more or less, a doctor.From what I've heard, she spent some time at a little clinic back in the village, picking up old remedies from a village healer who never went to school for it. Treating something as minor asa cold is probably her limit."

Cayden's brow furrowed as he processed that. A tiny clinic in the village? Taking care of nothing but a cold?Someone practicing folk medicine thinking she could perform surgery?

As Kaia spoke with that doubtful note in her voice, Cayden wondered how lsaac could have fallen for anything so outrageous. The whole story sounded likea farce to him. For Verena to claw her way into the Bennett family, she seemed willing to say anything. Pretending to have a fancy degree was one thing,but acting like she could perform actual surgery was going too far.

When he had thanked Kaia, Cayden turned and walked away.

As she watched him disappear into the distance, Kaia's lips curved into a sly smirk.

She had no idea who he would pass this information along to, yet the thought of Verena being dismissed as incompetent filled her with deep satisfaction.

After all, she wasn't even bending the truth. Verena really had been nothing more thana village-trained healer in a remote place.


···

When the meeting ended, Isaac's assistant handed him his phone. "Mr. Bennett, Mr. Moore tried calling four times."

Isaac tugged at his tie and accepted the phone. "Alright. You can go now." After the assistant walked out, Isaac dialed Cayden's number.

The moment the call connected, Cayden spoke in a rush. "Isaac, listen to me, you cannot allow Verena to operate on you. I just discovered she used to work in a small clinic. She learned everything from a self-taught healer in her village and never went through proper medical training. I've studied your case for months, and even then I only have a thirty percent chance of success. Yet she, who never even set foot in a real medical school, claims she has seventy percent. Isaac, don't you think that's strange?"

With a grave tone, Cayden added, "Besides, a surgery of this scale isn't something to hand over to just anyone. Isaac, you have to take responsibility for yourself. Your condition has already gone through too many failed procedures, and you know better than anyone how dangerous another attempt could be. I've studied several different approaches, but none promise success. And with medicine advancing every day, if the timing isn't right, we can still wait. But if this operation goes wrong and causes permanent damage, you could..."

Cayden almost told Isaac he could end up bound to a wheelchair for life, yet the words caught in his throat.

Isaac understood anyway. He sat frozen with the phone in his hand, letting Cayden speak without interruption.

Cayden continued, "Verena's entire experience comes from a tiny clinic, and she might not even know how to handle a scalpel properly in an operating room. You must not let her be the one to operate on you."

Suddenly recalling another option, Cayden interjected, "Isaac, you've heard of Evelyn Rowe, the famous surgeon overseas, haven't you? The mysterious doctor is one of the top authorities in this field. I reached out to them on your behalf, but because of certain complications, they haven't replied yet. Just give me two more days, and I'll find a way to get through to them."

Isaac understood that Cayden's concern was genuine. He bowed his head and stayed quiet for a long moment.

Cayden had made sense.

His faith in Verena had no solid ground. Maybe it was only because she had been the one to crouch beside him and speak after his injury. "Cayden, I appreciate it. I'll think it over again."

The following day, Verena opened a message from her assistant, Julianna Ford.

The message said, "Evelyn, I need your help. Do you remember that special patient you turned down before? He hasn't stopped hounding me since last night. He keeps insisting that only you can do that surgery. Could you at least check into it?"

Verena froze for a moment. To carry out surgery...

Verena remembered the day Shawna had been stretched out on the operating table, and just as she lifted the scalpel, Shawna passed away.

From that day forward, each time she tried to hold a scalpel, her right hand began to shake uncontrollably.

Nearly a month had passed since Shawna's death, and she had been struggling to step out from under that shadow.Yet every time she picked up a scalpel, her hand trembled without her control, a fatal weakness for any surgeon.

Verena let out a quiet sigh and answered, "It isn't that I'm unwilling. The truth is, I simply can't hold a scalpel right now.I need time to get past this, and I already have a special patient waiting for me."

After pausing to think, Verena added, "Just refuse him outright. If he pesters you again, give him my contact info and tell him to talk to me himself."

With no alternative, Julianna passed along her words exactly as they were.

Upon reading the reply, Cayden was overwhelmed with frustration and a sense of helplessness.

His connection with Julianna was the only reason he had been able to reach Evelyn. Since Evelyn had rejected him so firmly, how could he possibly keep begging?

Still, adding Evelyn to his contact list seemed like a smart move, and perhaps it might open a door later.

Yet after sending the friend request..

An hour slipped by. Another two hours went by.

Then three hours dragged on.

By ten hours, there was still nothing.

···

Time moved swiftly, and soon the day of Isaac'streatment arrived.

On the evening before the treatment day, Verena saw a message from Isaac pop up on her phone. "I'll be sending a driver for you in the morning."

Verena answered, "Alright."

After pausing for a moment, she added, "Don't be nervous. Stay calm. It's just an early-stage treatment."

Isaac sat in his study, his gaze drifting blankly toward a tree outside the window.

When he saw Verena's message, he laid his hand on his lifeless legs, lowering his eyes as his thoughts sank.

At dawn the following morning, Kaia returned from her run to see a glossy black luxury car waiting at the villa gates.

Kaia's beauty often made her stand out in Shoildon's circle of wealthy ladies. Before she even came of age,wealthy young men had already chased after her, and once the ceremony ended, even more suitors appeared.

The moment her eyes landed on a luxury car in front of her home, she assumed another admirer had come calling.

Kaia couldn't tell a thing about engines or brands, but the car's shine was striking enough to catch her attention.

With a bright smile, she brushed her hair into place, hurried across the drive, and knocked against the glass.

The driver rolled the window down, and Kaia folded her arms, acting like she was annoyed. "Would you mind not parking outside my place? I've said it before-I already have feelings for someone.Please let your boss know he should stop trying to reach out."

While acting indifferent, she stretched her neck for a quick glance inside, but the back seat was empty.

Unmoved by her assumption, the driver answered without emotion, "I'm here to pick up Miss Verena Willis."

Her grin vanished at once. "What did you just say?"

Using the exact same tone, the driver repeated, "I said I'm here for Miss Verena Willis."

Her chest swelled so tightly it felt as though it might burst wide open.

Her hands slipped to her sides, and she pulled on a strained smile. "Fine.I'll bring her out."


 ###Chapter 22 Spare Me The Act


At the dining table, Laura slowly swirled her spoon through her coffee.

When Kaia stepped inside, Laura's face brightened. "You're home. Sit down and eat something with me."

Hiding her irritation, Kaia moved closer and spoke quickly. "Mom, I spotted a car out front when I got back.At first, I figured it was Wayne Happer trying to drag me to lunch again. But when I asked, it turns out the driver was here for Verena."

"Verena?" Laura's brows knitted together. "She barely set foot in Shoildon. Who would even know her?"

After a pause, her frown deepened. "Probably some worthless acquaintances."

Kaia noticed the dismissive tone, bit her lip, and then let out a sudden smile. "I thought the same thing. Still,it doesn't sit right with me."

Her voice grew sharper, and her brow tightened. "If it's just casual friends, then fine. But what if she ends up tangled with the wrong kind of men? Don't forget, she's Isaac's future wife. One wrong rumor could wreck her standing. Think of how people will talk about the Willis daughters if this gets out."

At those words, Laura slammed her cup onto the table, splashing hot coffee across the surface.

Her voice turned cold as she snapped, "If she dares to fool around and ruin the alliance between the Willis family and the Bennetts, I'll see to it she pays dearly for it!"

Kaia hid the smirk tugging at her lips and placed a gentle hand on Laura's wrist. "Mom, I'm only speculating.Maybe Verena isn't that type of girl."

Laura narrowed her eyes, clearly certain that Verena was the type of woman she had suspected.

Upstairs on the third floor, Verena gathered her things, grabbed the medical kit, and stepped out of her room.

As she came down, she caught sight of Laura and Kaia sharing breakfast together, a picture that almost seemed warm and ordinary.

Her eyes rested on them for only a moment before she quickly turned away.

"Hold it right there," Laura barked, freezing Verena just as she reached the door.

Verena stopped in her tracks without glancing back. "What is it you want from me?"

A dark scowl spread across Laura's face. "Running out this early-who exactly are you sneaking off to meet?"


For a brief moment, Verena looked taken aback, but she quickly turned around, her eyes landing on Laura before drifting toward Kaia.

Kaia tried to meet Verena's stare with ease, yet the weight of that unwavering gaze broke her composure.Her throat tightened as she looked away in discomfort.

A sharp laugh slipped from Verena as her eyes returned to Laura. "If you're going to accuse me,at least make the lie believable. Having a voice doesn't give you the right to spit out garbage."

The table rattled as Laura struck it, rising to her feet and jabbing a finger at Verena. "This is the respect you show me when I'm trying to guide you?"

"Guide me? What authority do you think you even have?" Verena retorted.

Laura's rage only deepened when Verena dismissed her so openly in front of Kaia.

"I'm your mother. That alone gives me every right to discipline you," Laura snapped.

To Verena, the claim was nothing but a joke, and she laughed outright, the sound edged with scorn.

"Oh, so you do remember that I'm your child too. For a while, it felt like you were only a mother to Kaia and Luka. When it comes to me, nothing I say ever matters, but the moment they speak, you take every word as the truth."

With that, Verena turned a sly smile on Kaia. "Save your plotting. The car outside belongs to Isaac, not some 'wrong kind of men'. You're too young to be tossing around filthy ideas-try keeping your thoughts, and your She was teasing Kaia deliberately, repeating the same things she had told Laura. Just before coming downstairs, she had happened to overhear part of their conversation.

The blunt strike drained the color from Kaia's face. She clung desperately to her image of obedience before Laura, holding back any retort, and let tears spill instead.

Verena cut her off before the tears could even fall. "Spare me the act. I'm the one being slandered here, and I'm not weeping. You're the one making things up-so why are you crying? Do you really feel wronged, or do you just think I don't have the right to call you out? Pathetic."

With a short, dismissive laugh, Verena turned away, walking off without giving either of them another second of her time.

The sting of Verena's words left Kaia speechless on the outside, but her chest burned with fury.

Laura, on the other hand, felt an uneasiness she couldn't shake. She knew she played favorites, yet even with that awareness, she couldn't stop herself. And now, Verena's defiance stirred not just guilt but also an echo of resentment, perhaps because it reminded her too much of Shawna, her late mother-in-law.

"Mom..." Kaia noticed the flicker of guilt in Laura's expression, and dread took hold-what if that guilt made Laura soften toward Verena and give her more attention?

What Kaia couldn't see was that Laura had already sensed her fear and understood her intention,yet even so, Laura's instinct remained the same: to stand firmly on Kaia's side.

...

Medical kit in hand, Verena stepped into the car, and before long, the ride brought her to the location Isaac had sent.

When the car stopped, the driver addressed her with quiet respect. "Miss Willis, Mr. Bennett is already inside the hospital waiting for you."

Her gaze lingered on the private hospital towering before her, and for a moment she stayed silent. She had messaged Isaac before, telling him that they would begin with a traditional approach before surgery.For the traditional treatment, they didn't need the equipment of a hospital, so why would he choose to meet her at a hospital today?

Setting her questions aside, Verena walked straight toward the top floor, making her way to the VIP ward where Isaac was waiting.

In the end, Isaac chose to place his trust in Verena.

Since Evelyn couldn't be found, Cayden grew uneasy about leaving Isaac in the hands of someone who appeared untrained in medicine, so he came along to watch closely.

Although he offered to help Verena, he had already decided in his mind that he would take over the operation if necessary.

Inside the ward, the two men sat in silence until a knock sounded against the door.

"Come in," Isaac called out.

Cayden's eyes stayed locked on the door as it swung open.

Through the doorway stepped a young woman in a simple V-neck sweater and faded jeans. Her frame was slender but carried a quiet elegance, and her face was striking enough to draw every eye. With no makeup at all, her natural beauty shone, most of all in the clarity of her gaze.

For a heartbeat, Cayden was caught off guard by herpresence, and only when she greeted them did his attention drop to the medical kit in her hand.

His surprise slipped out in his voice. "You're Verena Willis?"

In response, Verena gave a courteous nod, her gaze shifting briefly from Cayden to Isaac.

The sight left Cayden astonished. Who had ever claimed she was plain? Anyone making that claim had clearly never stood in the same room with her.

Still, this was no time to focus on appearances. Isaac's condition came first, and the presence of a traditional medicine kit only deepened Cayden's doubts. Isaac shared in the confusion, his brow furrowing. "Wasn't today meant to be the surgery?"

Verena glanced at Cayden briefly before addressing Isaac directly. "I recommended we start with traditional methods first and hold off on surgery until the timing is right," she said calmly. "Doesn't that sound wiser? If you'd like, I can show you our chat history."

###Chapter 23 Isaac Is My Fiancé


Verena realized at last why the hospital had been chosen for the first day of the treatment-it was because Isaac had assumed the surgery would happen immediately.

Checking their old messages, Isaac scrolled through his phone and discovered the mistake. In his eagerness, he had latched onto the word "surgery" and paid no attention to her earlier explanation.

"I was careless," Isaac admitted, lowering his voice. "I misunderstood."

Cayden exhaled in quiet relief at hearing there would be no surgery just yet, though the worry in his eyes never faded. Turning to Verena, he pressed his doubts.

"Miss Willis, as far as I know, your experience with traditional medicine only comes from the small clinic at your hometown. Do you truly believe you can handle Isaac's condition? This isn't something trivial."

Even though she intended to begin with traditional methods, which were more conservative, Cayden's distrust was obvious.

Verena knew Cayden didn't trust her, and she understood why-trust was never given freely to a stranger.

She kept her composure and answered evenly, "You don't need to worry. I would never risk misleading someone from the Bennett family. I wouldn't make promises unless I was certain of them."

Cayden, trained in modern medicine, had only a shallow knowledge of traditional practices. If Verena was determined to rely on them, there was little room for him to object.

Sensing both men's unease, Verena shifted her gaze toward Isaac and allowed a small smile. "Isaac is my fiancé.If I would harm anyone, it certainly wouldn't be him."

Her words landed harder than either expected.

Isaac's head lifted at once, his throat working as he swallowed. The word "fiancé" had rolled from her tongue without any deliberate sweetness, spoken so naturally it almost startled him. He had always thought of their arrangement as nothing more than a transaction. But now, hearing it so simply from her lips, the title carried a warmth he hadn't anticipated.

Isaac finally looked away from Verena and addressed Cayden, saying, "I know you're worried about me,Cayden, but I've decided to place my trust in Miss WVillis."

Positioned between the two, Cayden glanced from lsaac on one side to Verena on the other. They were bound to marry sooner or later, and as someone outside their alliance, it wasn't wise for him to interfere too much. More importantly, as long as no hasty surgery was involved, he had no reason to push back.

After a brief silence, Cayden cleared his throat. "If you've chosen to trust her, then as your friend, I'll stand with you."

At that, Verena opened her medical kit and looked at Isaac. "Shall we begin the treatment?"

His hands clenched around the wheelchair's armrests, but he gave a firm nod. "Go ahead."

Verena's lips curved in a soft smile as she crouched in front of him. She pulled back the blanket covering his legs, reached into her kit, and retrieved a pair of scissors.

Before Isaac fully grasped her intent, the scissors cut through the fabric, and she slid the pant leg up to his thigh in one swift motion.

Caught off guard, Isaac stiffened at the sudden exposure.Heat crept into his chest, but he forced himself to look away, reminding himself this was simply part of the treatment.

Verena didn't miss his unease. In fact, she noticed something else-despite six months of inactivity, his legs still held strong lines of muscle, the kind that came from years of dedicated training. It hadn't been long since the injury, and traces of his old athleticism remained.

With a small laugh, she said lightly, "You know, your legs are actually quite impressive."

The comment startled Isaac. Impressive? His head turned sharply toward her, searching her expression for mockery. But there was no trace of it-only a steady, admiring gaze, as if she were looking at something genuinely remarkable. 
When his eyes met hers, Isaac felt his heartbeat falter for a moment.

He tried to mask the rush in his chest with humor. "Tell me, is 'impressive' really the kind of word you use for a man's legs?"

Her lips curved in amusement. "Then maybe I should say they're beautiful instead," she teased, playing along.

The odd stirring returned to him, a flutter that unsettled his composure.

Sensing it was time to pull back, Verena let the banter end there.

She lowered her hands onto his legs, pressing gently several times before rising to her feet. She said to Cayden, "Could you move him onto the bed?"

"Of course," Cayden replied without hesitation.

He assisted Isaac onto the bed, while Verena took a seat beside the bed, set her kit on her lap, and carefully chose a silver needle.

Cayden folded his arms across his chest, watching in silence.

Between her fingers, the slender needle gleamed. She positioned it with practiced precision, and then pressed the tip against a point on Isaac's leg and drove it in smoothly.

One of Cayden's brows lifted; her technique looked nearly identical to that of seasoned traditional doctors he had seen before.

Flat on his back, Isaac fixed his gaze on the ceiling, his expression unreadable.

As her hand pressed on a pressure point, Verena asked quietly, "Do you feel anything?"

Isaac gave a slight shake of his head. "Nothing."

Without hesitation, she drew another needle and set it into a different spot.

"And this one? Any feeling?" she asked again. His eyelids lowered as he answered softly,-"No."

Another needle went in, followed by her steady question. "What about now?"

Isaac kept his lips pressed tight, wanting to respond but unable. His lifeless legs seemed to mock him,reminding him of how far beyond saving he might already be.

Isaac stayed silent, his fists tightening hard against his sides instead of answering Verena's question.

When he only shook his head, she could see the shadow of disappointment settling over him.

Her hand came down softly on his clenched fist as she spoke in a steady voice. "I'm only asking so I can understand the extent of the nerve damage. The fact that you can't feel anything right now doesn't mean it's hopeless. Your case is unusual, but there's no need to be afraid. We can work through it step by step."

Isaac's eyes lowered to the delicate hand resting on his own. Warmth seeped through his skin, traveling upward until it reached his chest and lodged in his heart.

Those words seemed to wrap around him like a balm, making his throat tighten as he murmured, "Thank you."

Verena answered with a small smile, "You've thanked me enough already. You don't have to be so polite."

Then she returned to her task, sliding more needles into place as part of the treatment.

After every insertion, she checked for his response, repeating the question with care.

Even though his answers never changed, he found himself calmer, more willing to face the truth of his condition.

About half an hour later, she began removing the needles. "This process takes time," she explained. "You'll need two or three sessions each week. I've already written a prescription. Your assistant can buy the herbs from a shop that specializes in traditional medicine. I'll message you updates as your recovery progresses."

From the side, Cayden had observed every step. The confidence in her technique and her composed manner forced him to admit he might have misjudged her abilities.Still, something about her unsettled him. Her voice carried a note that tugged at his memory, stirring an odd sense of familiarity.

As Verena packed away the last of the needles and finished her instructions, Cayden finally spoke up. "Miss Willis, have we met before?"

###Chapter 24 I'll Be The One To End It


Verena studied Cayden for a moment, curiosity flickering in her eyes. After a brief pause, she confirmed her answer. "No, we've never met."

Cayden's brow tightened with a faint crease. The sound of her voice stirred something in him, but he struggled to recall where he had heard it before.

Once she denied the connection, he didn't press further. Instead, he gave a short nod and stepped forward to help Isaac back into his wheelchair.

"You seem fine enough," Cayden remarked. "But I just received an urgent call from the hospital, so I'll need to leave."

Isaac nodded and said, "Go on."

As Cayden walked out, silence settled over the room, leaving only Isaac and Verena behind.

The quiet broke when Isaac's phone buzzed loudly on the table.

Glancing at the screen, he picked it up. "Mom? What is it?"

On the other end, Danica's voice came firm and clear. "I have news for you. The wedding with Verena has been scheduled for next month."

Isaac's expression tightened, his dislike for her domineering tone written plainly on his face.

Not giving him a chance toreply, Danica pressed forward. "You should remind yourself of the bigger picture.I'm well aware you don't care for Verena, but the Bennett family cannot afford your resistance. Remember your position-you're a Bennett.That means sacrifices. Even if it feels unfair, you'll endure it for the family's sake."

Her words slammed shut any room for argument.

Isaac swallowed hard, answering in a low voice, "I understand."

He was not the kind of man who accepted destiny without a fight, nor did he ever follow his mother's commands without thought.

His marriage with Verena was nothing more than a name on paper, and before he met her, he had every intention of rejecting the Willis family's daughter. However, once he finally laid eyes on her, he felt an instinctive urge not to resist. What drew him in was not her appearance, but a feeling he found impossible to define.

With a slight turn of his head, Isaac quietly observed Verena as she gathered the medical kit.

When she noticed his eyes on her, Verena's lips curved into a calm smile. "I heard your mother just now. She thinks you don't care for me, but insists you should keep the family's interests above your own."

Raising the kit into her arms, she gave him an easy smile. "Do you feel marrying me is unfair to you?"

Her hand landed lightly on his shoulder. "Relax. You don't have to like me, and I won't force anything on you.If you truly feel trapped by this arrangement, I'll be the one to end it when the moment arrives."

The ease in her tone made it seem as though the matter didn't bother her in the least, which was only natural given how little they knew each other.

But Isaac's chest tightened unexpectedly, as if her words had struck somewhere tender.

"I.." He tried to speak, but his throat closed around the words, leaving only silence behind.

Isaac thought about telling her that he didn't feel any dislike toward her. Yet saying that aloud would suggest there was some affection between them, and that was unthinkable considering how little time they had spent together. What mattered more was the reality that he was in no state to give his heart to anyone.A man bound by crippled legs and plagued by other failings-how could he possibly have anything to give in love? Romantic feelings were never meant for him.

Verena picked up on the sudden gloom in his expression, and it brought back a memory-how he used to follow her around with unwavering determination. She'd get fed up sometimes and tell him to leave her alone for good. What was it he used to say in return? Ah, yes. "In this life, it's only you. Once we're married,you'll see me every day. There won't be any staying away."That bold promise lingered for a moment in her thoughts before fading away like a passing dream.

Watching him sit with his head lowered, she found his quiet despair almost too heavy to endure.

Walking closer, she bent over and ran her fingers playfully through his hair. "I'm only teasing. I'm not upset.Besides, feelings can grow, can't they? We've got time to understand each other and see where things lead."

Her head tilted slightly, her smile gentle, as if she were comforting a child.

Isaac's lashes trembled while his gaze lingered blankly on the woman in front of him.

The purity in her eyes and the softness of her smile stirred a faint familiarity, though he couldn't place when or where he'd seen something like it before.

Heat from her palm grazed his hair, leaving a tingling trail that rippled through him.

A lump rose in his throat, and he wonderedif he imagined it. Her touch felt effortless, almost too familiar,as if closeness came naturally to her.

The thought, however, was pushed aside at once. In his condition, who would willingly draw near? More likely, she only valued the title that came with being tied to the Bennett family.

Part of him wanted to protest-that not every kind of love could be forced to grow.

But when he looked into her eyes, whatever argument he had formed slipped away before he could speak.His hand curled slightly against his leg, and with his eyes lowered, he gave a slow, instinctive nod. "I get it.You're not wrong."

Hearing his reply, Verena straightened up and spoke with calm sincerity. "Let's stop here for today. If anything feels off after you get home, please promise me you'll let me know immediately."

The concern in her voice left him pressing his lips together before he answered in a low tone, "Alright. I will."

Her eyes lingered on his unruly hair. His unexpected compliance drew a small smile from her. "Good boy."

Her hand brushed through his hair once more, a playful gesture like a reward, before she gathered her kit and walked out.

Left alone in his chair, Isaac's eyes drifted to the empty doorway. His hair stuck up awkwardly in the middle,leaving him looking a little ridiculous.

Inside the Willis Villa, Alec and Laura lounged on the sofa with the financial news playing, while Kaia busied herself at the counter preparing coffee for them.

Verena had just turned toward the stairs when Laura called out to her, "You're back already?"

With only a brief look in Laura's direction, Verena kept her tone flat. "I'm heading upstairs to rest."

As Verena turned to walk away, Laura chimed in, "The wedding date with the Bennett family has been settled. You and Isaac need to choose a day soon to have your pre-wedding photos taken."

"I'm aware," Verena replied curtly.

A reminder wasn't necessary; Verena would not have forgotten.

Laura's unease grew at Verena's constant detachment. What if this stubborn girl stirred up problems that jeopardized the Willis projects the Bennetts had backed after the marriage?

Holding back the unease twisting in her chest, Laura softened her voice and said, "Verena, are you still upset with me? I only said those things because I didn't want to see you misled. That's the reason I spoke so harshly. You have to believe that everything I do comes from a place of care."

She did feel a flicker of guilt for the accusation she'd thrown at Verena that morning, but compared to what was at stake, that guilt barely registered.

Verena, however, couldn't stop the quiet scorn rising in her mind. Laura had shown no hesitation when it came to pointing fingers. And now that sherealized she was in the wrong, she conveniently wrapped her actions in the excuse of concern. Hiding behind the words"everything I do comes from a place of care"didn't make her accusation any less calculated.

###Chapter 25 Their Love Had To Remain Hers


Verena looked at Laura and gave a quiet laugh. "I don't waste anger on just anyone. Only the people who matter get that side of me. So relax. Why would I be upset with you?"

The way she spoke made it sound like Laura's presence was of little importance.

Across from her, Laura's eyes fixed on her daughter, and her expression stiffened beneath layers of carefully applied makeup. All morning she had wrestled with guilt over how she had wrongly accused Verena,and waiting here was her way of making amends. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with dismissal. Was Verena really suggesting she didn't matter? She was still her mother. But then, considering Shawna had been the one to raise Verena, it wasn't surprising. To Laura, the girl standing before her was nothing but a thankless child who threw her kindness away.

Kaia had been quiet until now, but after hearing Verena's cutting remark, she rose and slipped an arm around Laura's shoulders.

"How could you talk like that, Verena?" Kaia asked, frowning at her. "Mom's already trying to make things right with you. Don't you think it's disrespectful to speak to her this way?"

Her words weren't meant for comfort. They were meant to make Alec see Verena as insolent enough to deserve punishment.

Verena met Kaia's gaze with a cold stare. "Politeness depends on who I'm dealing with. And with the two of you, there's no need for it."

Her glance shifted to Alec, who opened his mouth as if to say something but held back. Without another word,she turned and walked upstairs.

For a moment Kaia stood frozen, unable to form a reply. When her thoughts finally caught up, anger took hold of her. She hated herself for always losing ground in arguments and never being sharp enough to outtalk Verena. Growing up the way she did had made Verena quick with insults, but that was all she had. On second thought, Kaia felt a flicker of relief, realizing her sister's only skill was a sharp tongue and nothing more.

Breathing hard from frustration, Laura pressed her hand against her chest. She looked over at Alec, who sat unmoving on the sofa. "Can you believe this? Just look at what's become of her! How could she claim I'm not worth basic respect? I am still her mother!"

While Laura raged, Alec's eyes stayed fixed on the floor. Regret flled him far more than anger whenever he thought ofVerena.

Long ago, he had planned to bring Shawna and Verena to Shoildon, but Laura's constant objections always got in the way. It was only after Shawna pasśed away that Verena finally came to live in his home.

Those lost years left a distance between them, and Alec had tried to bridge it as a father. Still, the gap was too wide. He and Verena had spent so long apart that it felt impossible to truly reach her now. When he heard Verena speak so coldly to Laura, he couldn't find it in himself to blame her. He only blamed himself for falling short as a father.

Interrupting his thoughts, Laura's sharp voice demanded attention. "Why won't you say anything? Look at the kind of person she's become under your mother's guidance!"

Alec drew a slow breath and met Laura's gaze. His words came out steady. "You keep saying you're her mother, but was there ever a moment you actually tried to teach her the right way?"

A hintof offense crossed Laura's face. "What are you suggesting? Do you really not remember who stood beside you back when you had nothing? I had no time to teach our eldest daughter properly because I had given you my full support back then. Are you seriously blaming me for this now?"

Hoping to avoid an argument, Alec softened his voice. "She just came to the city, so it makes sense she's unfamiliar with how things work here. As her mother, you're supposed to lead her forward, not just criticize her. You keep saying she's rude and unrefined, but let's not forget, we left her to live wih my mother for more than twenty years. If Verena had grown up with us, she would have been a different person."

Kaia almost opened her mouth to tell Alec about Verena's rudeness and the way she had shoved Luka down the stairs. But when she noticed the heavy guilt in Alec's eyes, she forced herself to keep quiet.

Her gaze flicked between Alec's troubled face and Laura's contemplative look, and a bitter sense of grievance welled up inside her. Why did Verena's return seem to steal all of their attention?

That grievance soon turned into unease. If her parents kept focusing on Verena, would their love eventually belong only to her?

The thought unsettled her even more when she remembered that Verena was set to marry Isaac, which would surely bring her even greater favor at home.

Grinding her teeth, Kaia made up her mind. She would never allow that to happen. Their love had to remain hers, and their focus should never wander to anyone else.

"Dad, Mom, don't let Verena's issues take over your thoughts anymore," Kaia steadied Laura on the sofa and gave a bright smile. "I actually have some good news to share with you."

As Laura quietly questioned whether she had been too harsh with Verena, Kaia's cheerful voice suddenly drew her attention back.

"What kind of good news?" she asked.

Alec was curious too, so he turned his eyes toward Kaia.

Now that both of them were paying attention, Kaia's smile grew warmer. "Not long ago, when I was eating out with a friend, I happened to meet one of my professors."

Then, with a touch of pride, she added, "You remember-the one who's always been especially fond of me."

As always, Laura remembered every detail about Kaia.

She leaned closer with a smile and asked, "You're talking about Professor Wendell Branson, aren't you?"

Kaia nodded eagerly. "I stopped to greet him, and he ended up sharing something with me."

She let the pause linger on purpose, letting their anticipation build, and then went on with a bright smile."This year, our medical school is bringing in Dr. Evelyn Rowe, the world-famous physician, to give a lecture. Since Professor Branson knows how much I admire Evelyn, he saved me a place right away, worried I might miss the chance."

Laura's eyes widened in surprise. "Is that true? Didn't you once tell me Evelyn rarely makes public appearances? If your school managed to invite Evelyn, they must have gone to great lengths.And your professor holding a seat for you clearly shows how highly he thinks of you."

She wrapped her arms around Kaia and praised her warmly. "Kaia, you really are remarkable."

Enjoying every bit of her mother's affection, Kaia smiled with deep satisfaction.

Alec was pleased that his younger daughter had earned her professor's favor. And the name Evelyn stirred his curiosity.

Life is inseparable from illness, aging, and death, and regardless of how much power or wealth a person possessed, the opportunity to build ties with a doctor of Evelyn's reputation was far too valuable to overlook.

Although Alec had heard of Evelyn before, he realized he knew almost nothing about the doctor beyond the name.
###Chapter 26 | Want To Meet Verena

Alec leaned forward slightly and asked, "What kind of achievements has Evelyn made in medicine?"



Kaia's eyes lit up at her father's interest, and she answered with enthusiasm, "Evelyn's incredible, Dad!A few years back, in Clokron, they led a groundbreaking heart transplant that shook the entire medical community. That operation alone made Evelyn famous, and since then, many of Evelyn's successful high-risk operations have been written into medical textbooks. Every medical student looks up to that legendary doctor."



The mention of Evelyn made Alec thoughtful.Years of dealing with society's elite had taught him how much they valued their health. Forming a connection with someone like Evelyn could open doors in ways money and power couldn't.



With that thought in mind, Alec rested a hand on Kaia's shoulder and instructed, "When the lecture is over, make sure you get Evelyn's contact information.Don't let a chance like this pass you by."



Even without his reminder, Kaia had already resolved to do just that. To her, Evelyn wasn't only a famous doctor-they were her greatest inspiration.


She gave a cheerful nod and said with a smile, "You don't need to worry, Dad. I'll definitely take the opportunity."



...



Shock ran through Bobby when he learned Isaac and Verena's wedding date had already been set. He had assumed there was still time to derail what he considered a mismatched marriage, but his mother and the Willis family had moved faster than expected.



If he didn't act quickly, Verena, the girl he believed to be deceptive, would officially become part of the Bennett family. He was determined to see her in person and decide for himself what sort of woman she truly was. In his mind, she couldn't possibly be beyond his ability to control.


Acting on imnpulse, Bobby hurried into his room,grabbed his phone, and dialed Kaia's number. Though he had never thought much of her, she was his only link to Verena in this urgent moment.


The call connected not long after.


It struck Bobby that they hadn't spoken once since the last birthday party. When Bobby's call lit up Kaia's phone, the memory of being left hanging at her birthday party rushed back,souring her mood. Still, his decision to reach out stirred a faint hope that he might finally be giving her some thought.



Kaia's voice was soft as she asked, "Mr.Bennett,what can I do for you?"



Instead of polite chatter, Bobby got straight to the point. "I want to meet Verena."



The words hit Kaia like a shock. Her face stiffened,and after a stunned pause, she stammered, "Wha... what did you just say?"



The idea sounded so unbelievable that she questioned whether she had heard him correctly.


Bobby repeated himself without hesitation, "Let Verena know | expect to see her tomorrow. If not,just pass along my number."



Kaia struggled to understand what she had just heard.What reason could Bobby possibly have for wanting to meet Verena? No matter what drew people near her or what their intentions were, they always seemed to be asking about Verena in the end. It had happened with Cayden before, and now it was happening again with Bobby. Forcing herself to keep calm, she asked in a tentative tone, "Why exactly do you want to meet Verena, Mr.Bennett?"



His brows drew together in irritation. "I don't owe you an explanation. Just give her the message."


Kaia's mind raced. The last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena, especially since she had once sent a message in the group chat, hinting that Verena wasn't attractive, and everyone had believed her. If he saw Verena in person, that lie would unravel instantly


"That's a shame," said Kaia flatly, spinning the lie without a hint of emotion. "Verena hasn't been around much lately, and even I barely run into her. She keeps to herself most of the time. Our family hardly speaks with her, so I doubt she'd be open to someone she doesn't know. I don't have any way to reach her,either."



The way Kaia spoke made Verena seem cold and full of herself.



Doubt crept into Bobby's mind as he listened to KCaia.He figured Verena might be distant, but it seemed unlikely that Kaia didn't have a chance to speak with her sister at all.



Rather than press the issue, Bobby picked up on Kaia's unwillingness to help and decided not to question her motives any further.


Bobby's voice was flat. "Alright, if you're not interested in helping, I'll just handle it on my own."



That was all he said before he ended the call.



The moment she heard his words, Kaia felt panic rising in her chest. Someone like Bobby, with his influence,wouldn't struggle for long if he set his mind on finding Verena. The chance of them meeting seemed impossible to avoid. If Bobby ever saw Verena and thought she was beautiful, he might stop objecting to the marriage with Isaac altogether.



As these thoughts spun in her head,Kaia's anxiety only grew. Even though her feelings for lsaac had faded after his accident, she hated the idea of Verena ending up with the man she once wanted but could never have. The thought alone was unbearable, and she simply couldn't allow it to happen.



Worry twisted Kaia's expression as she gnawed at her lip and tried to come up with a way to keep Bobby and Verena apart.



Suddenly, Kaia's eyes landed on the steaming bowl of soup a maid had just brought to the bedside table, and an idea sparked in her mind.



Since Bobby had never met Verena, he wouldn't recognize her. If something happened to ruin Verena's appearance before their meeting,Bobby would surely turn away in disgust and refuse to accept her as a future sister-in-law.



The image of a scarred Verena flashed through Kaia's mind, and she burst out laughing at the thought



The following morning arrived.



Verena finished washing up and headed downstairs,making her way to the dining room for breakfast.


Kaia had already been lingering in the kitchen for more than thirty minutes, waiting for just the right moment. She scooped up a bowl of steaming soup with extra care when she heard footsteps approaching.


After Verena took her seat at the table, Kaia moved slowly toward her, balancing the bowl.



Verena took a small bite of the bread the maid had handed her and noticed a flash of pink in her peripheral vision. That shade of pajama belonged to Kaia alone, making it clear who had been lingering in the kitchen the entire time. She wondered what ridiculous scheme Kaia might be brewing now.



One eyebrow lifted, Verena kept a close watch on Kaia without turning her head.



Without warning, Kaia tripped and came stumbling in Verena's direction. In a split second, Verena set her bread aside and sprang out of her chair to avoid the collision.



Her quick move made the chair scrape loudly against the floor.



Kaia was so startled by the sudden noise that she backed away, completely forgetting the bowl she was holding.



Hot soup sloshed over the rim, burning her hand and making her cry out as she dropped the bowl. Some of it even splashed up onto her neck.



Tears filled Kaia's eyes while she clutched her burned hand,blaming Verena for startling her on purpose.



She gave Verena an angry glare, clearly about to start yelling.


Before she could speak, Verena interjected coldly,"Not a great feeling, is it, Kaia? Burns pretty badly when your own scheme turns against you."
###Chapter 27 Surveillance Footage
Tears welled up in Kaia's eyes as the pain hit her, and her gaze grew red wen Verena called her out so bluntly. She pressed herlips together, determined not to admit a thing. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Honestly, I don't get it."


Verena looked at Kaia's face, taking note of the features they had in common. This was her sister,after all.


Still, Verena couldn't ignore the fact that Kaia wanted her disfigured.



Before coming to Shoildon, Verena had assumed that her sister, whom she had only met once, likely didn't think much of her. She never imagined that Kaia would actually hate her this deeply.



Trying to keep her feelings in check, Verena kept her tone cold and held Kaia's gaze. "Kaia, you don't like me, and I don't like you. We're both well aware of it.I haven't gone after you, so don't think you can start with me. As long as you behave yourself, I'll let you do whatever you want. I'm not interested in fighting for anything you want. But if you ever try something
against me again, I promise I'll make you pay dearly."



Kaia found it impossible to tolerate the way Verena looked down on her. She had grown up beside their parents,spoiled by them,while Verena had lived out in the countryside, so why did Verena always act so high and mighty?



By now, Alec and Laura were both at work, and Luka was out somewhere with friends. With nobody around to back her up, Kaia felt completely alone.



Holding her hand over her scalded neck, Kaia glared at Verena and warned,"Do you really think I won't tell Mom and Dad that you're bullying me? That you spilled hot soup on purpose just to hurt me?"



With her patience gone, Kaia didn't bother to act like the good sister anymore.



Verena faced Kaia's empty threat with a faint smile. "If you have time to complain, you should hurry up and go to the hospital. If you're slow, you might actually end up with scars."



There was a challenge in the way she spoke her final words.



Kaia,who cared more about her looks than anything else, lost all color in her face the second she heard the word "scars."
Several drops of hot soup had splashed onto her face as well.



She shot Verena a furious glare and gritted her teeth."You're evil. You really are the worst."


Anger boiled inside her, but Kaia forced herself to focus on getting to the hospital first.


She gave quick directions to the driver, and soon she was on her way tothe hospital.



After doctors reassured her that her face would be fine, Kaia stretched out on a plush VIP bed, snapped a picture of herself, and posted it online with a simple caption: "At the hospital."



Within minutes, a few of her so-called friends from her circle of rich acquaintances sent messages to her in the group chat, pretending to be worried. "Kaia,what happened to you? How did you end up like this?"



Kaia let the questions pile up and waited until her phone buzzed with nearly a dozen messages before deciding to answer.



Kaia finally replied, "Don't worry, it's nothing serious.Verena just came to live with our family. We're not really close. I wanted to do something nice and made her some soup, but when I handed her the bowl, she bumped it and the soup ended up all over me."

Because people in the group already looked down on Verena for faking her academic background, not many were willing to defend her.



After reading Kaia's message, one of the group members quickly commented, saying, "You're telling me that was an accident? She definitely meant to do it!"



Someone else jumped in right after. "Of course she did. She's jealous that you're so pretty and probably wants to ruin your face."



Watching the flurry of reactions, Kaia felt pleased with herself, but she kept up her sweet and innocent act."Please don't misunderstand her. Verena can be difficult, but I really don't think she did it on purpose."



To make her message seem even more pitiful, she added a sad-faced emoji at the end.


When Bobby read through the group chat, his eyebrows knitted together in doubt. He wasn't convinced by what Kaia said. After all, these two were sisters, so it seemed unlikely things would get so ugly.Besides,after talking to Kaia a few times, he knew she was good at putting on a show and couldn't be trusted.



Someone else in the group shared his doubts and tagged Kaia. "You can try to explain, but people are still going to question you. Doesn't your house have cameras in the dining room? If you show the recording it'll be clear whether Verena meant to do it or not."



Other people quickly chimed in with agreement."Exactly, just upload the video."



Kaia had already seen this coming. She had spent her ride to the hospital editing the footage so it would look the way she wanted.


Still, she couldn't let herself seem too eager to share it.



She responded in the group, "Okay, I'll go look at the recordings now."



After a few minutes, she picked the video she had already prepared and sent it into the chat.



In the video, a woman with long hair sat at the dining table, her back turned toward the camera. Moments later, another woman appeared, wearing a pink nightgown and holding a bowl of soup. It was clear the one in the pink nightgown was Kaia, and the woman seated with her long hair flowing down could only be Verena.



The footage showed Kaia standing about three feet from the table. As Verena pushed her chair back and rose to her feet, her arm swept out and hit the boWl,sending hot soup splashing across Kaia's arm. With the way the video was shot, it looked like Verena did it on purpose.



Of course, Kaia knew the truth. Verena never made contact with the bowl at all; she had only lifted her hand while getting up.



But Kaia had cut out the key section of the recording



After seeing the video, everyone in the group sent messages to comfort Kaia, believing Verena did it on purpose.



When Bobby finished watching, his frown grew even deeper, and a mix of emotions clouded his face. Kaia was far from innocent, but anyone willing to hurt her own sister was no better.



He had always thought Verena was just a compulsive liar who wanted to outshine everyone else. After he saw this, she struck him as jealous and vindictive. If Isaac really ended up marrying her,the entire Bennett family would be thrown into chaos. He could not let that happen. As long as the marriage hadn't taken place, there was still time to stop it.



Determined, Bobby threw off his covers, got out of bed, and stormed toward Isaac's study.



He didn't pause to knock. Instead,he marched right in and blurted out, "Isaac, I'm serious. You can't marry  someone like Verena. You have no idea how cruel she can be. She almost ruined her sister's face. If you go through with this,our family will never know peace. If you don't believe me, I have the video to prove it..."



"Enough!" Isaac slammed his folder on the desk, and the sharp sound made Bobby jump.



In a cold, steady voice, Isaac replied, "I've told you before, Verena is going to be your sister-in-law.I won't let you talk about her like that."



Isaac folded his hands in front of him and stared Bobby down. "Or do you think now that Dad's gone,what I say doesn't matter anymore?"
###Chapter 28 He's Lucky To Be Marrying Me
Isaac had never spoken to him that way before.Bobby wanted to defend himself, but when he met lsaac's piercing stare, he suddenly felt like a little kid who had missed the point entirely.



His fingers twisted the edge of his shirt, and he dropped his gaze. "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac," he mumbled.



Isaac understood him well enough to know what was really going on. Bobby was not being defiant for the sake of it. He simply could not bring himself to accept Verena as part of their family.



With a quiet but forceful voice,Isaac said, "Look at me."



Reluctantly, Bobby pressed his lips together and looked up to meet Isaac's eyes.



Isaac's face was unreadable. His gaze was intense,and it made Bobby feel small under the weight of it.



He admired Isaac, but whenever lsaac put on that stern look, Bobby always broke into a cold sweat.


Every instinct told Bobby to look away, but he could not muster the nerve. He swallowed hard and waited in tense silence.



After a pause, Isaac's voice cut through the air."You're old enough to know better. It's time you focused on your classes. I expect you to help me with company business when you can. As for everything else, leave it alone. If I catch you speaking badly about Verena again, you'll find out exactly how harsh I can be."



Bobby wanted to protest. He wished he could say he only wanted to protect lsaac, that Verena was dangerous, and Isaac was fooled by that woman.



But with Isaac sitting right there, so intimidating,Bobby could only bite back his words and give a silent nod.



He stepped out of the study, but his frustration bubbled up the more he thought about it. He ran a hand through his hair and let out a long sigh.



That was when voices drifted up from downstairs,as the servants greeted Danica.



A spark of hope lit up in Bobby's eyes. Isaac might have lost his objectivity when it came to Verena, but Danica certainly had not. She had always hated women who acted out of jealousy. If she found out about this, maybe she would be the one to call off the  arrangement.


That idea brought Bobby's spirits back to life,hope flickering in his eyes.


Bobby rushed down the stairs and nearly tripped as he hurried into the living room to find Danica.



She had just come in from outside and was settling onto the sofa, still holding a glass of water. She hadn't even taken a sip before Bobby's sudden entrance startled her, making her cough.


"Are you alright, Mom?" Bobby asked as he moved beside her, gently patting her back.


Danica tried to catch her breath, and then shot hima sideways look. "What on earth has you in such a rush?"



Bobby responded immediately, "Mom,you can't let Verena marry into our family. I thought she just liked to exaggerate, but now I see she's really got a manipulative side. Please, before the wedding, go talk to the Willis family and call off this arrangement.You'd be saving Isaac from a terrible mistake."



He said everything in a single breath, leaving Danica staring at him in disbelief. She blinked a few times before answering, "Have you gone crazy?"



The question caught Bobby off guard. He grabbed her shoulders and spoke with even more urgency. "I'm being serious, Mom!"


Danica said nothing for a moment. She had weighed Isaac's engagement to Verena carefully, thinking it was the best decision for their family.


Seeing Bobby act so impulsively made her lose patience. She brushed his hands away and snapped,"How many times do I have to tell you not to meddle in Isaac's life? Are you even listening when I talk to you? Right now, your job is to work with lsaac and learn how to manage the company, not run around causing trouble. Tell me, when was the last time you even showed up at the office?"



Her scolding stung, and Bobby looked away, refusing to meet her eyes. "I don't care about running the company," he muttered to himself.



Hearing that, Danica's temper snapped. "Then what do you care about? Tell me. What actually interests you?"



With her voice rising, Bobby fell silent. Danica crossed her arms, glaring at him with obvious disappointment."You and Isaac grew up under the same roof, but he turned out responsible and hardworking, and you-well, you're just a headache. Go on, get out of my sight!"


Before she had even finished, Bobby had clenched his fists and stormed from the room. No one ever listened  to him. Would it really hurt them to watch a simple video? All they ever did was yell at him.



...



A black sedan sat parked right at the front gates of the Willis Villa, with the driver standing patiently nearby.



From her seat on the sofa, Laura glanced up and spotted Verena making her way downstairs. "Verena,you need to keep your eyes open during the photoshoot today. I don't want you doing anything that gives people a reason to laugh at us."


Since Verena had spent her childhood far away from city life,Laura constantly worried she might embarrass the family when faced with all the luxury, especially the wedding gowns and sparkling jewelry.


Luka interjected, "You probably don't recognize any of those brands, so it's best if you just watch Mr.Bennett and follow his lead. If he picks a dress, just go along with it. Don't make a scene by choosing the wrong one."



Both Laura and Luka already knew about Kaia's accident and her trip to the hospital. Under normal circumstances, Laura would never have ignored what happened, but today's event was simply too important. Noticing the irritation on Luka's face, Verena gave a calm smile and said, "This is my wedding, and I'm the one at the center of it. I'll wear whichever dress I like.Your opinion has nothing to do with it."


Laura's face tightened. "Don't be ridiculous. Who do you think the wedding is really about? Isaac is the center of attention, not you. If you do something to upset him, he could easily call off the entire wedding."


Before Laura could say anything more, a smooth,deep voice drifted in from the entryway. "Mrs. Willis, it sounds like you don't have mnuch faith in me."



All three of them turned to see who had spoken.


Isaac had just arrived, seated in his wheelchair, with his assistant guiding him through the door.


Laura's demeanor changed instantly. She forced a bright smile and greeted him. "Mr. Bennett, what a surprise. We weren't expecting you today."


Kaia came down the steps just then, and the sight of Isaac made her heart race. His condition didn't take away from his presence or his good looks. Even while sitting in that wheelchair, he looked every bit out of reach.



Verena stood there, caught off guard as she met Isaac's eyes. She only snapped out of her daze when lsaac moved beside her and gently took her right hand in his.


"Today's for the pre-wedding shoot. Verena is my fiancée, so it only makes sense that I came to pick her up," Isaac said, turning his attention to Laura.


His tone was courteous, but the chill in his gaze was unmistakable. There was not a hint of warmth in his eyes, only a depth that was impossible to read.


Laura froze for a split second, surprised by how directly Isaac referred to Verena as his fiancée. It was clear he had no plans to call off the wedding. Her face lit up with a practiced smile. "You're absolutely right.It's a real honor for Verena that you came for her yourself."



Hearing Laura's comment and recalling what he had overheard on his way in, Isaac frowned slightly. Laura seemed to have no problem talking down to her own daughter.



He was about to speak up when Verena beat him to it."I'd say Isaac is lucky to be marrying me, too. There's no need to put your daughter down."


For a brief moment, lsaac looked surprised. Hlis eyebrows arched in amusement.



Laura's smile vanished. Kaia stared at Verena with wide eyes, shocked that she would say something so bold.



In Kaia's mind, the Willis family could never compare to the Bennett family. She wondered how Verena could possibly be so fearless-how could she say that marrying her was lsaac's stroke of luck?
###Chapter 29 Liar



Laura glared at Verena, ready to lash out, but Isaac spoke up first. He nodded and said quietly, "She's right. Honestly, I do feel lucky to be marrying Verena."



Laura could only stare at him, completely thrown off by his response.



Kaia also turned to look at lsaac, unable to hide her shock. There was even a small, amused smile on his face.



Neither Verena nor Isaac lingered at the house. They said their goodbyes and headed out together.


Once inside the car, Verena looked over at Isaac. She was practically glowing, her eyes full of curiosity.


For a while, Isaac pretended to focus on the scenery outside, but eventually, he couldn't ignore her gaze any longer.



He finally turned and asked, "What's with that look?Why are you staring at me?"



That seemed to snap Verena out of it. She blinked and said,"Oh. I just wanted to know if you meant what you said back there." Isaac gave a slight frown. "Which part are you talking about?"



"All of it," she replied, her tone playful.


In reality, he had only spoken a couple of sentences,but the meaning behind them lingered



When Isaac fell quiet, Verena pressed her hands into the seat and leaned a little closer.



They were both sitting in the back, and Isaac's height made him look even more imposing.


As soon as he noticed her moving closer,he instinctively leaned away.



Verena wasn't going to let him get away that easily.She looked up at him, grinning. "Weren't you supposed to send someone to pick me up? What made you decide to come in person?"



He had sent her a message last night saying the driver would be there in the morning.



Verena had assumed it would be just the chauffeur.She hadn't expected him to show up too.



Isaac really meant to let the driver handle it and meet her at the bridal shop. But when the driver was ready to pull away this morning, he changed his mind on a whim and got in, not bothering to think too hard about it.



"| was just passing by and thought we could go to the bridal shop together," he said, pretending it meant nothing.



"Oh," Verena blurted out, dragging the word slowly though her tone made it clear she didn't believe a word of it. The Bennett Mansion and the Willis Villa were nowhere near each other, and only someone completely clueless would buy his excuse. If he had gone out of his way to come for her, could it mean that feelings he didn't remember were starting to rise back to the surface without him even noticing?



That thought made Verena's smile grow a little wider.


She sat up straighter, and then closed her eyes,settling back as if she wanted to rest for the ride.Isaac noticed her quiet confidence and almost asked if she still doubted his motives. For a moment, he wanted to clear things up, but then he thought better of it. Even if she questioned him, he honestly did not know how to explain his own actions.



Their car rolled to a stop not long after.


A thick winter fog drifted over the streets, making the whole morning feel soft andstill.


Isaac waited in his wheelchair while his assistant moved to help, but Verena stepped forward and placed her hands on the chair's handles. "I'll take care of this."



The assistant hesitated, glancing at Isaac for direction.Isaac gave a small nod, so he simply followed behind,watching the two of them.



Inside the bridal shop, a team of staff members stood by the door, ready to greet them.


As soon as Verena pushed Isaac inside, the staff all bowed politely.



Warmth filled the space, and bright lights danced across glass cases, making every wedding dress look even more dazzling.



A young sales assistant stepped forward, her smile directed at Isaac. "Good morning, Mr. Bennett." Then she turned to Verena, her eyes lighting up."And this must be Mrs. Bennett. She's absolutely stunning."


For a second, Isaac hesitated at the name. Mrs.Bennett?



He almost corrected the assistant, wanting to explain they weren't married just yet, but Verena only gave a small, polite smile. "Thank you," she said, her voice gentle.



Isaac glanced over and noticed her smile. It was warm and sincere, and she did not seem at all bothered by being called Mrs. Bennett.



When Isaac didn't reply, the sales assistant quickly added, "Mr. Bennett, would you like to see our wedding dress styles? | can-"


Isaac cut her off, his tone even. "I'm not particular.Your job is to help Mrs. Bennett with anything she needs."



Verena arched her eyebrow in silent amusement.



The sales assistant forced a quick smile, and then nodded."Yes,absolutely."



Verena took her time looking through the racks and picked out several wedding dresses. Meanwhile, the sales assistant chose a few matching suits for lsaac.


In the end, Verena settled on an off-the-shoulder gown with a flowing train. The back was laced with smooth white ribbons that needed to be tied. Right then, the sales assistant left to find a suit for lsaac.



Once she finished changing, Verena pulled the curtain aside.



The soft sound caught Isaac's attention. He glanced up and stopped short, unable to look away.



There stood Verena, her long hair pinned up with care, and the pale dress brought out the soft glow of her skin.



She wore only a touch of makeup, but it gave her cool, elegant features an unmistakable charm.



When Isaac just stared at her in silence, Verena grinned and called out, "Are you so dazzled you forgot how to speak?"



He shook himself from his thoughts and cleared his throat.



Her smile widened.She had always known how shy he could be. "Come help me out," she remarked.



Without thinking too much, Isaac rolled his chair over to her.



When he reached her, Verena turned away, tilted her head back, and said, "I can't tie up the back of this dress. Give me a hand, will you?"



To make it easier, Verena bent her knees and lowered herself a little.



Isaac glanced down and took in the graceful lines of her shoulders. Her back was smooth and delicate,and a tiny black mole on her left shoulder blade caught his eye, making her look even more intriguing-and somehow oddly familiar. For a moment, Isaac froze. Verena noticed and reached back, placing the ribbons directly into his hands.



She teased him gently,Ir. Bennett, are you going to help or not?"



That snapped him out of it.



He started working on the ribbons, but his fingers were awkward and cool as they brushed against her bare skin. The heat from her back sent a shock through him,and he immediately pulled his hand away.


He fumbled for words. "I, um, maybe the sales assistant should do this part."



He backed his wheelchair away, suddenly too nervous to meet her eyes.


Watching him pull away so quickly, Verena suddenly remembered how she once told him to stop shutting her out. He had promised her back then. Yet here he was,doing the same thing all over again.


She straightened and spoke in a quiet voice. "You're such a liar."



Though she barely spoke above a whisper,Isaac still caught what she said. His gaze dropped, fixated on his unmoving legs. He found himself spiraling, thinking about how she'd let him touch her just now. The problem wasn't her, and deep down, he knew it. For someone like him, feeling broken and less than whole, there were certain things he would always feel were out of reach.



Experience had taught him that nothing in life comes for free, and he couldn't fool himself into believing this marriage was about love. Since she never voiced any complaints, there had to be something else she wanted-and that wasn't him.



The sight of Isaac's brooding silence left Verena with a heavy heart. It was easy to see how much pain he was hiding, and she understood it would take time before he'd be himself again. Pushing him for more wouldn't help either of them.



A gentle smile found its way onto her face as she spoke. "I'll just wait for the assistant, then."


Isaac looked over, surprised to find only kindness and understanding in her eyes. There was no hint of annoyance about his refusal, just a warmth that made himn feel oddly forgiven.



With Verena standing there so at ease, lsaac grew restless, unsure whether he was allowed to reach for what he wanted-almost like a child who didn't know if he was allowed a treat. It surprised him how deeply she'd managed to get under his skin, considering how little time they'd known each other.



He couldn't help watching her for a moment longer,and then looked away.


A moment later, Verena broke the silence. "But..."



Isaac's head snapped up at the sound of her voice.



Closing the curtain, Verena caught his eye. Mischief sparkled in her gaze as she spoke with quiet conviction. "You said you wouldn't shut me out. I'll let you off the hook for now, but next time, you better remember your promise."



Before Isaac could think of a reply, she slipped behind the bright white curtain, the fabric falling quietly in her wake.
###Chapter 30 My Fiancé Gets Embarrassed Too Easily
Isaac froze, his ears filling with the sound of his own heartbeat. Something unfamiliar stirred inside him,sharp enough to crease his brow. It wasn't anger-more like a restless curiosity about this feeling he couldn't quite name. Each time he pushed Verena away,his chest only grew heavier, as if his steady logic slipped for a moment.



His fists tightened as he stared at the curtain drawn tightly in front of him. Without fully thinking it through,he wheeled himself forward, an impulse driving him closer.



His hand caught the fabric, and he pulled it aside.



Verena stood just beyond the opening, her back to him as she adjusted the train of her gown.



The gown's ribbons spilled loose down her spine,the silk strands falling in graceful disarray that somehow felt both elegant and chaotic.



Isaac swallowed hard, his throat working as he forced his eyes away. Still, he moved into the fitting room,stopping only when he was behind her.
Slowly,he lifted his hands to gather the ribbons.



The gentle tug made Verena think the shop assistant had returned to help her.


A small smile curved her lips as she said without glancing back, "Thank you. My fiancé gets embarrassed too easily."



Her voice carried a sweetness she didn't even try to hide, the kind that gave her simple words a note of quiet affection.



Isaac's grip on the ribbons grew firmer. It wasn't the words themselves-it was how carefully she chose them. She never pointed out his limitations, never said a thing about his chair. Instead, she had simply excused him as shy.


Isaac blinked, and then answered quietly, "You're welcome."



The sound of his voice made V/erena whip around in surprise. "You?"she asked.



A warm glow filled her face as her eyes brightened and a sincere smile spread across her lips, soft and unguarded.



Isaac blinked, his lashes trembling slightly as the weight of his earlier behavior settled in-it struck him  then just how overly sensitive he had been.


He closed his mouth into a firm line, lifted his eyes to meet Verena's, and said, "I might be feeling a little shy right now, but there are things we'll need to adjust to,since we're going to be married."



Verena hadn't expected Isaac to come to that kind of understanding so suddenly, and the shift in him caught her off guard.



She tilted her head slightly, her eyes glinting with curiosity. "Do you really believe that?"


Isaac paused for only a moment before answering, "I do."



A smile touched Verena's lips as she replied, "Then I'll count on you, my sweet fiancé."


Those last two words were spoken so lightly they might have passed unnoticed, yet they struck something deep inside Isaac. Just hearing her call him that brought him an odd sense of calm.



"You keep drifting off into your own world," Verena teased,her tone carrying a hint of playfulness.



Her words snapped lsaac back. Only then did he realize she had crouched in front of him, patiently waiting for his help. "My apologies," he said quickly, gathering the loose ribbons to tie them.



He moved with as much care as he could manage, but his fingers brushed against her skin as he worked.



"Your hands are freezing," Verena remnarked with a soft laugh.



Isaac froze, worried his cold fingers brought her discomfort. He was about to pull back and suggest letting an assistant handle it, but Verena spoke again,her voice carrying quiet concern. "Do you have trouble sleeping at night?"



Her question caught him off guard.


After a beat, he gave a small nod. "Yes."


The truth was that the accident had scarred him mnore in spirit than in body. Ever since that day, restless nights and endless nightmares had haunted him. He hated the weakness he carried, hated even more that his survival had come at his father's expense. From then on, sleep had felt heavy and hollow,never bringing him any comfort.


Verena noticed the faint crease in his brow and chose not to press further. She could already guess why he lived with insomnia. Isaac tied the final ribbon just as the sales assistant stepped into the room.



She gave lsaac a small bow and apologized, saying,"I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, Mr. Bennett. There was a mix-up with the stock."



Isaac pressed his lips together before he responded in an even tone, "That's alright."



Not long after, both he and Verena changed into their wedding outfits, and the staff led them to the location for the photos.


Roughly thirty minutes later, their car rolled to a stop.As they stepped out, the photographer welcomed them with a broad grin. "Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett."


Verena sized him up. He was young, with a slight belly,and when he smiled, his eyes curved into cheerful slits,giving him a clumsy but likable appearance.



She returned the smile and nodded politely."We'll be counting on you today."



The process of taking pre-wedding photos turned out to be detailed and slow.



Once the session started,the photographer positioned them carefully, giving instructions step by step. He arranged them so that Verena stood holding a bouquet, her eyes lowered in a soft smile, while Isaac,seated in his wheelchair, was to wrap one arm around her waist and look at her with affection.



A staff member handed the bouquet to Verena, and she moved to stand at Isaac's side.


"Mrs. Bennett, you look stunning. Let's see a smile,"the photographer remarked warmly, showering her with compliments as he adjusted her pose and waited for just the right angle.


Then his attention shifted. "Mr. Bennett, put your arm around your bride's waist."



Isaac's gaze fell on Verena. The gown she wore revealed the sides of her waist, covered only by a thin sheer layer. Placing his hand there would be almost the same as touching her skin.



He stayed still for several seconds, unable to move.



The photographer peeked up from his camera and chuckled. "Mr. Bennett, are you that captivated by how lovely your bride is?"



Verena's eyes slid toward Isaac, amusement flickering in her expression.



Catching her look sent a sharp jolt through him. He quickly turned away and lowered his head.



After more urging from the photographer, he finally raised his arm and rested it on her waist. Because of his seated position, he had to reach higher than felt natural.



The photographer snapped several shots and then checked the screen. Verena's pose was graceful,her smile effortless, but lsaac's hand looked stiff and awkward in the picture. His eyes, instead of showing warmth, were far too serious, leaving the photo without any real trace of romance.



The photographer turned to Isaac with a grin. "Mr.Bennett, these are pre-wedding photos, not a board meeting. You've got to soften up. Let your eyes do the talking-make it look like you adore her so much the camera can feel it."



To demonstrate,the photographer widened his eyes in an exaggerated way, and then squinted dramatically,even making circles with his hands to mimic glasses.



Verena let out a laugh at his performance, while Isaac's long fingers tightened slightly before he answered, "Alright. I'll try."


His reply seemed to reassure the photographer, who went back to arranging them for another pose.



But when he checked the next picture, he groaned. "Mr. Bennett, you look ready to give a speech in front of a crowd, not vow eternal love."



The image told the story. Verena's face glowed, her posture graceful and easy, while Isaac sat rigid.His jaw was set, his eyes fixed with too much resolve. Instead of tenderness, the picture carried the weight of a formal portrait.



They repeated the process again and again, but the results barely changed. The stiffness lingered in every frame.



The photographer's booming instructions slowly wore down to a hoarse murmur, his patience draining.


Isaac couldn't remember the last time he felt this out of place. Since the accident, he had never faced a camera while seated in his chair, and now the weight of it pressed heavily on him. Looking at Verena so effortlessly radiant only made him feel like an intruder in his own wedding photos.



His chin dropped, and both hands pressed tightly against his motionless legs.


Standing close, Verena caught the change in him. As the photographer stepped away to sip his water, she touched Isaac's shoulder and bent down until her lips were near his ear. "Forget about the camera," she whispered. "Just focus on me."

###Chapter 31 Verena Kissed Him
When the photographer came back, he asked Isaac and Verena to shift into a different pose.



He decided on a pose that felt straightforward and did not require much interaction between them.



"Let's try to get the feeling right this time," he said aloud. "Mrs. Bennett, I want you to sit on Mr. Bennett's lap and loop your arms around his neck."



At the mention of "lap," Isaac's brow tightened. His legs might hold steady enough, yet the weakness in them meant that even the smallest slip could send her tumbling.



Catching on to his discomfort, Verena chose not to bring up his legs and instead teased lightly, "Relax, I'm not that heavy."



His eyes lingered on her, and a quiet warmth stirred inside.She clearly understood his concern had nothing to do with her weight.



Words were about to leave his lips when the photographer cut in, saying, "Mr. Bennett, if you think she might slip, hold her back and steady her head with

your hands."


Before he could even register the instructions, Verena had perched sideways on his lap, her toes brushing against the floor.



Since Isaac had no sensation in his legs, he never noticed that Verena was hardly placing her weight on him.



She slipped her slender arms around his neck, and her skin felt both cool and soft against him.



The brush of her skin sent a sudden tension through him, and his hands moved instinctively to steady her back. His legs gave him nothing, but his chest could not ignore the warmth pressing against it.



Balancing with the help of her legs, Verena leaned close enough that her upper body pressed against his.


When he lowered his eyes, he caught the sweep of her lashes, the sharp line of her nose, and the bold color painted across herlips.



So close to her now, lsaac breathed in a gentle fragrance, a sweetness that seemed to drift through the very air around them.



"That's it, wonderful!" said the photographer as he kept giving instructions. "Now lean in a bit closer."
At his words, Verena tugged Isaac's head lower toward her.



Leaning in, Isaac found himself staring directly into her eyes.



Not content yet, the photographer pushed them further, saying, "Closer. Closer than that."


On this attempt, Isaac leaned in without waiting,and before Verena could guide him, he was already close.A smile spread across her face, delighted by his initiative.



Verena's expression struck the photographer as flawless, and he nearly clicked the shutter right then.Yet when his eyes shifted to lsaac, he spotted the stiffness in Isaac's posture.



The photographer clicked his tongue thoughtfully and said, "Let's try something else. Touch noses for me,show a little more closeness."



Verena gave a small nod and lifted her chin, brushing the tip of her nose against Isaac's.


The moment Verena leaned closer, the photographer snapped the shot.



Her shift made Isaac's lashes tremble, and the hand resting at her back gripped more firmly without him

 realizing it.



A faint wince crossed Verena's face as the pressure brushed against a bruise from earlier.



He quickly eased his hold and met her eyes with regret. "I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?"


She gave a calm shake of her head, unbothered. "It's nothing. Let's keep going."



Holding her position steady, Verena stayed still while Isaac's thoughts drifted. "Did I hurt you..." The words echoed in his mind as if he had spoken them to someone once before.



Catching his faraway look, Verena angled her head and, to her own surprise, pressed her lips against his.



When her warm lips touched his cool ones, a fierce spark rushed through Isaac's thoughts like a sudden current.



In that instant, Isaac forgot how to think or move,and only the steady throb in his neck reminded him that Verena had kissed him.



Watching the scene unfold, the photographer's face lit with satisfaction, and he snapped the shot at once.



"These turned out better than l imagined." He stepped back,eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he studied the shots one by one.



At the sound of the photographer's praise, Verena eased back a little from lsaac.



While pulling back, she caught sight of something amusing. Isaac's ears burned red with shyness, yet his expression showed no trace of anger.



The look on his face tempted Verena, and she decided to tease him.



Following her playful impulse, she leaned in close,smiling as she whispered gently into his ear, "You were the one who got distracted, so I had to think of something. Otherwise, the photographer would grow impatient. And hey, we're getting married soon, so this shouldn't be that big of a deal, right?"


Her words came in a softened tone, and she tilted her head,looking straight into Isaac's eyes with a spark of mischief.



A visible swallow moved along lsaac's throat as her gaze held him, and he quickly lowered his eyes. His voice, rougher than he noticed, came out as he murmured, "Sure... it's fine."


Verena accepted his answer with a nod, let her teasing drop,and smiled while lifting herself from his lap.



After holding that posture for so long, her legs had gone numb, and her soles tingled sharply as though pierced by countless tiny needles.



Isaac saw the way she shifted her legs and caught the strain on her face, yet he chose not to ask about it.



Once that moment passed, the rest of the shoot moved along with unexpected ease, free from the serious look the photographer had stressed earlier.



By the time the session ended, the clock had slipped past ten in the evening. Isaac brought Verena home before telling the driver to continue on to the Bennett Mansion.



Inside the car, lsaac took the contract from his assistant's hand, but not a word on the page would stay in his mind. Instead, the memory of Verena's kiss kept replaying, the delicate warmth still lingering on his lips.



Caught in that memory, Isaac's fingers drifted up and brushed his lips without him realizing it.


The assistant repeated Isaac's name more than once,but no answer came back.



Through the rearview mirror, the assistant noticed Isaac's fingers resting against his lips.


In a louder tone, he called out, "Mr. Bennett,are your gums hurting?" Startled out of his thoughts by the sudden volume,Isaac pulled his hand back and gripped the contract,saying, "No, I.. only noticed a problem with the contract."



"What?" The word "problem" sent a jolt of tension through the assistant. As he turned to look, his mouth hung open in disbelief. "Mr. Bennett, you... the contract is upside down."



When Isaac glanced down and saw the words printed upside down, he quickly adjusted the pages,as though snapping out of a dream.



Noticing the shock on his assistant's face, Isaac cleared his throat and mumbled with unease, "Today ...the photo shoot wore me out a little."


The assistant could hardly believe it. Wore him out?



Never before had he heard lsaac, the tireless workaholic, confess to exhaustion.



Though surprised, he gave a nod, silently recognizing the effort Isaac had made.







After they finished taking the pre-wedding photos,Verena started getting busy with other things. 
During her time overseas, she began taking patients suited for traditional treatments. Along with the newcomers, she still kept in touch with her longtime patients for regular follow-ups


On this particular day, Barrie was scheduled for his follow-up visit.



Her errands kept her out until late in the afternoon,after which she drove straight to the Lyons family's residence.



At the same time in the Willis Villa, Laura stood behind Kaia in the dressing room, resting her hands firmly on the girl's shoulders. With a tone both earnest and serious, she said, "Kaia, tonight marks Mr. and Mrs.Lyons' thirtieth wedding anniversary. Many powerful guests will be at the party. When you attend,you must build connections with them. Do you understand?"

###Chapter 32 Do You Happen To Know Dr. Willis
The Lyons family had nothing to do with the Willis family, so Kaia couldn't believe it when Slater suddenly sent her an invitation.



When Kaia saw the invitation, she didn't know what to think. Laura, however, immediately guessed that Slater might be interested in Kaia.



The idea excited Kaia, though she could only remember one embarrassing moment when he skipped out on her birthday party. Aside from that,they hardly spoke. Maybe Slater only reached out because he was close with Bobby, and since she had been interacting with Bobby a lot recently, he felt it natural to include her too. Whatever the reason, Kaia didn't mind. As long as the connection worked in her favor,she welcomed it.



"Mom,you don't need to remind me. I already know what I'm doing," said Kaia, proudly adjusting the pearl necklace in front of the mirror. She turned slightly and asked, "How do I look?"



Laura's eyes softened as she watched her daughter dress so carefully. "You look beautiful, sweetheart. The prettiest of them all."



Laura stood behind her, fixing a few strands of Kaia's hair before another thought came to her.



"Oh, isn't Slater's grandfather Barrie in poor health?Since you're studying medicine, you could show him a few ways to take better care of himself.Maybe even send some health supplements. His son and daughter -in-law are known to be very devoted. If Barrie takes a liking to you, it could open doors for us."



In Shoildon, the Lyons family didn't hold as much power as the Bennett family, but they were still influential. If the Willis family managed to win their favor, their standing in the city would rise quickly.



Kaia fully understood the value of her mother's suggestion and knew exactly why it mattered.


She turned to her mother with a confident smile."You don't have to worry, Mom. I've already taken care of everything. Just relax."



Pleased that Kaia grasped her intentions, Laura brushed her fingers across her daughter's cheek. "You really are thoughtful."



Then Laura's smile faded as she thought of Verena."Your grandmother spoiled Verena too much. I can't count on her anymore." Noticing that Laura had completely lost faith in Verena, Kaia didn't bother to offer false comfort anymore. She simply held her mother's hand and said sweetly, "But you still have me,right?"



Laura's pride swelled at Kaia's words. Even if Verena was beyond saving,she still had her younger daughter.From childhood, Kaia had always been exceptional.She was even considered a lucky star, since the family became millionaires shortly after her birth.



As she grew older, Kaia stood out in her studies, and it seemed likely she would one day become a respected doctor who brought honor to the family. It was proof that children thrived when they grew up beside their parents. The difference between Kaia and Verena made that obvious.








Even on her way to the Lyons estate, Kaia clung to the hope that Slater might like her.


It wasn't until Slater gave her a polite nod and told someone to show her to the party venue that Kaia understood she was nothing more than one guest among many.



"Do you want me to send these gifts to your grandfather?" asked Slater's assistant, gesturing toward the stack of boxes Kaia had brought.

 Slater had never thought well of Kaia, and the only reason he invited her was to ease his guilt for skipping her birthday party.


What he truly couldn't stand was the way Kaia tried so desperately, and so insincerely, to force a connection with him.



Slater glanced at the boxes, and then waved dismissively. "Put them in the warehouse. After the party, let the servants divide them up."



The assistant nodded and quickly ordered the staff to move the boxes into storage.



The Lyon family's estate had two main buildings. The party was held in the front building, while the back was kept more private.



Kaia quickly grew bored at the party since everyone already seemed familiar with one another, leaving her with no chance to join in.



Frustrated, Kaia slipped out of the party with a glass of red wine and strolled onto the small briddge that led toward the back garden.



Then she caught sight of a white figure ahead and stiffened. Was that Verena? What was she doing here?



Her eyes went wide, and without thinking, Kaia  followed after her.



She trailed behind until she realized Verena was making her way toward Barrie's quarters.



Kaia's thoughts raced. It couldn't be true. What connection could Verena possibly have with Barrie?



Even though she struggled to believe it, a ripple of worry spread through her chest.



She hurried her steps, trying to close the gap between herself and the woman ahead.



Just a few steps later, a familiar voice called out behind her, "Who are you sneaking after? You look way too suspicious."



Bobby shifted his gaze to where Kaia was looking.Ahead of them, a woman in a white dress with long hair walked away, her figure strikingly familiar.



Kaia's nerves spiked again. Bobby had mentioned that he wanted to meet Verena. If he realized the woman ahead of them was her, everything would fall apart.He might decide Verena was good enough to be his sister -in-law and stop trying to break the marriage arrangement. Worse still, all the lies Kaia had told him about Verena would collapse the moment he saw her face. She couldn't let that happen.



Thinking fast, Kaia spun around and pulled out her

  phone. "I'm not following anyone. I was just looking around. Anyway, didn't you say you wanted to meet Verena? I can give you her contact info so you two can talk<.”



Her words caught Bobby off guard, though he still looked skeptical. "You're serious?"


Kaia nodded quickly. "Of course. Why would I lie about that?"



Bobby pulled his phone from his jacket pocket."Alright then. I'll trust you on this one."


Once he sent the friend request, Bobby held out his phone for her tosee."This the right one?"



Kaia gave it a quick glance, and then smiled as she nodded. "Yeah, that's her."



Satisfied with her answer, Bobby slipped his phone back into his pocket and walked off without another word.



The moment he left, Kaia pulled out her phone. She switched to her alternate account and accepted Bobby's request.



There was no way she'd let Bobby meet Verena, so she wasn't foolish enough to give him a real number.


In fact, she hadn't even added Verena on any chat app  herself.



By the time midnight drew near, the party had finally come to an end.



In Barrie's room, Verena had just completed another round of treatment for him.



Barrie had been feeling much stronger recently, and tonight he leaned against the headboard with a cheerfuL expression.



"I'm really sorry for taking up so much of your time,Dr. Willis," Barrie said apologetically.


Verena gave a calm smile. "Please don't say that. It's part of my responsibility."


After exchanging a few more words with him, Verena excused herself and left the room.



By then, most guests had already drifted out of the front building. After saying goodbye to Slater, Bobby was ready to head out as well.



Just as he turned to leave, he stopped short. A woman in a white wool coat and faded denim jeans passed by.Her skin was luminous, her lashes curled delicately,and her profile was striking. What caught him most was her cool, almost untouchable air. That was...



"Hey!" Bobby shouted as he rushed after her. Verena came to a stop, her brows knitting as she turned to the young man blocking her path. "Who are you?"



"I'm the one you pulled out of that wreck. You saved me after the crash," said Bobby, his voice rushing with excitement.



At his words, Verena finally recalled the incident.


She gave a small nod. "So, what is it? Are you feeling unwell, or do you need something from me?"


Bobby nodded eagerly, words rushing to the tip of his tongue but refusing to come out. "I've got something to tell you, but... give me a moment to find the right words."



"Do you happen to know Dr.Willis?"

###Chapter 33 Should I
Compete With You



Bobby was about to speak when Slater came over and asked if he knew Dr. Willis.



"Dr. Willis?" Bobby blinked in disbelief, his eyes flicking to Verena before he turned to Slater. "Wait-are you saying she's the one who treated your grandfather?"



Slater gave a firm nod. "Yeah. That's her."



Bobby stared at Verena, stunned. "You're not just gorgeous-you're talented too?"



Noticing the awe on Bobby's face, Slater asked curiously, "Wait,do you actually know her?"



Bobby swallowed hard and gave a quick nod. "She's the doctor who pulled me through after my car accident."



Leaning closer,Bobby whispered with barely contained excitement, "She's exactly the kind of woman I'd want as my sister-in-law."



Slater let out a short laugh. "What are the odds of that?"
All of a sudden, every argument they'd had felt meaningless.



Catching their exchange, Verena gave Bobby a warm smile. "It was nothing, really. I'm just glad to see you doing well."


That easy smile left Bobby frozen in place.She really was everything he imagined-beautiful, graceful, and impossible to ignore.


When Slater caught Bobby grinning like a fool, he gave him a teasing shove.



Bobby snapped out of his daze, suddenly remembering something important. "Oh, right, Dr.Willis." His voice grew urgent. "If you were able to treat Slater's grandfather, then your skills must be remarkable. I need your help. My brother's legsare paralyzed... do you think there's any chance he can be treated?"



Bobby had been tempted to blurt out that she should be his sister-in-law, but he knew he'd only get yelled at for that. Instead, he took the long way around,hoping lsaac would eventually see for himself how kind and extraordinary the doctor truly was.



Noticing his desperation, Verena gave him a calm smile. "It's hard to explain in words. Every case is different, and I can't say anything for sure until I see the patient myself."


By coincidence, she happened to be studying Isaac's condition at that very time.



Bobby's brow creased as he asked, "Have you ever treated someone with leg paralysis?"


Verena answered calmly,"I've worked on two cases like that before. And I'm currently treating a patient with leg paralysis."


His words rushed out. "And did they recover?"


Verena gave a small nod. "It took years of treatment and steady recovery, but in the end, both of them walked again."



The moment her words sank in, Bobby lit up, all thoughts of his earlier schemes vanishing. "Dr. Willis,please-you have to help my brother."


Verena's voice stayed steady. "I'll need to examine him first before I can say anything."



Even though surgery still weighed on her mind as a difficult barrier, she knew she had to keep pushing herself to face patients directly.



Bobby held out his phone eagerly. "Can I add you on the chat app? I promise I won't bother you with random messages." After a moment of thought, Verena nodded."Alright."



The second she agreed, Bobby broke into a wide smnile.



Once she added him, Verena slipped her phone back into her pocket. "When you're home, ask your brother if he's willing to meet me. If he agrees,we can set up a time."



Bobby nodded over and over. "Alright, alright-I'll talk to him for sure."



With a slight press of her lips, Verena offered a calm smile and said, "Well then, I suppose it's time for me to go."



The moment Verena mentioned leaving, Bobby cheerfully waved her off and kept smiling until she disappeared through the front gates.



Slater, unable to watch any longer, shoved Bobby's hand down. "Seriously? She's already gone, and you're still standing here grinning like an idiot."



Bobby folded his arms and lifted his chin with pride."What do you expect? She's smart,gorgeous, and the perfect sister-in-law. I could smile at her all day without getting tired of it."



Slater couldn't stand that smug expression on his face. He let out an exaggerated gasp. "Oh, right-I never told you. My grandpa once said I should go after Dr.Willis myself. So what now? Should I compete with you to see if she'd rather be my girlfriend or your sister-in-law?"



Bobby's temper flared. "Dream on! She's already destined to be my sister-in-law. You don't get to challenge Isaac. And if you try... I'll-"


He jabbed a finger at Slater, paused dramatically for a few seconds, and then blurted out his so-called threat. "I'll cut you off as a friend!"



Once upon a time, Slater never would've been able to measure up to Isaac. But now, with Isaac bound by his disability, things weren't the same anymore.


After throwing out his so-called threat, Bobby didn't bother waiting for a reaction. He wasn't angry-just in a rush to get home.



Left standing in the chilly night, Slater shook his head as Bobby stormed off. "Unbelievable. I was joking,and he's already acting like we're about to break up as friends."




...



Back home, Bobby sprawled across his bed, his eyes fixed on the ceiling Phone in hand, his gaze stayed locked on the new contact he'd just added-Dr. Willis.



Her profile picture was nothing but a white backdrop,simple yet giving off a calm, reserved vibe.



Still, Bobby was convinced she carried both wisdom and grace.



With that thought in mind, Bobby tapped her profile,erased the name "Dr. Willis," and proudly renamed it "Perfect Sis-in-Law."



He admired the change for a moment, and then went back to his homepage looking pleased with himself.


Earlier that day,he had gotten Verena's number from Kaia and added her as a friend. Her profile now sat just beneath the one he labeled as Perfect Sis-in-Law.



When his eyes landed on the golden profile picture,Bobby let out a mocking sneer. "So tacky. No sense of style at all."



He opened her chat and quickly sent a message,saying, "Verena Willis,I want to meet. Tell me when you're free."



Whether Verena was right for lsaac or not, her past lies about her education and her attempt to disfigure her sister had already filled him with disgust. Normally,

 he wouldn't have bothered with someone like her. But since she was about to join their family, he had no choice but to meet her face-to-face. He was determined to uncover who she really was and how she managed to fool lsaac so completely.



He sat there with his phone in hand, eyes fixed on the screen as he waited for her reply.


Meanwhile, over at the Willis Villa, Kaia sat before her vanity, her makeup still perfect, yet her expression was clouded with frustration.



Anyone could tell her mood had soured completely.


A knock came at the door, and Laura's voice followed."Kaia, who did you meet today? Tell me everything."


Kaia bit her lip as she unclasped her necklace. "Mom,not tonight. I'm exhausted and just want to sleep."


Laura longed to hear about her daughter's social wins,but after Kaia's response, she had no choice but to drop the subject.
###Chapter 34 Bobby Confronts Verena
Laura gave a small nod before saying, "Alright, get some rest. We'll catch up tomorrow."


Once the sound of footsteps vanished down the hall,Kaia flung the pearl necklace to the side without hesitation.



When Kaia returned home earlier, Laura had noticed something was weighing on her and asked if the evening had gone poorly.



Instead of explaining, Kaia had shaken her head,claimed she was tired, and quickly used that excuse to head upstairs.



The truth was different. Kaia wasn't tired at all, but she couldn't figure out why Verena had appeared at the Lyons family residence. What baffled her even more was the sight of Verena inside Barrie's quarters. Barrie held status and influence, yet Verena, who had no place in that circle, dared to show up there?



An uneasy feeling pressed against Kaia's thoughts. She tried piecing it together, but no matter how long she turned it over in her mind, she found no answer. At last, she told herself she must have been imagining

  things. After all, someone like Verena couldn't possibly have ties to Barrie.



With that idea to cling to, her nerves finally began to settle.



Kaia pulled out her phone, intending to check the wealthy young people's group chat, hoping to see if anything new had been shared.



When the chat app loaded, she realized she had signed into her alternate account, where one unread message was waiting.



Since that account remained private, she instantly knew Bobby was the one who had sent it.


She tapped into their conversation and read his note about wanting to meet Verena, which curved her lips into a smirk. The sharpness in his words revealed just how little regard he had for Verena.


That thought made Kaia laugh, though it still didn't satisfy her. What she really wanted was to see Bobby push with everything he had to put an end to Verena and Isaac's wedding.



It was clear to Kaia that Bobby's pride left no room for anyone trying to tell him what to do.



Her eyes dropped to her phone as her fingers danced quickly across the screen. Once she reread the message for accuracy, she hit send without hesitation.



When Bobby's phone buzzed, he snatched it up, sat bolt upright in bed, and gawked at the screen in shock.



The words on his screen made him read them twice."You need to stop speaking to me with such disrespect. I'll be your brother's wife soon, and as Isaac's brother, the least you can do is show me courtesy."



Rage surged through Bobby as he reread the message.He knew he had been sharp with her on purpose, and even if his tone wasn't polite, who gave her the right to call him out? She wasn't even married into the family yet, and she was already strutting around like she owned the place. If she behaved like this now,what kind of arrogance would she show once she officially joined the Bennett family?



His thumbs flew across the screen as he responded,"You're not Isaac's wife yet. I'll speak to you however I damn well please, and it's not your concern."



The moment Kaia saw his response, a slow, satisfied smile curled across her lips. Bobby was already losing patience, and that was exactly what she wanted. If she kept pressing, his resentment toward Verena would deepen, and he'd soon be desperate to block the marriage altogether.

 She leaned back and began typing again. "Do you think I enjoy wasting my time on you? If you weren't Isaac's brother, I wouldn't bother at all. Once I marry him, I'll be part of the Bennett family, which makes it my responsibility to correct you. If I don't straighten you out now, people will say members of our Bennett family have no manners. That shame won't just fall on you-it will stain all of us."



The message sent Bobby into a fury. She was already tossing around phrases like "our Bennett family," as though she had a claim to it. She hadn't even joined the family yet, and still she dared to posture like a rightful Bennett.



Fingers pounding against the screen, Bobby snapped,"Listen carefully. Don't try to play teacher with me.Unless I decide otherwise, you'll never be my sister-in -law, not now, not ever. And don't forget, the wedding hasn't even happened yet. You act like it's guaranteed, but if you fail to step into the Bennett family, don't come crying about it later."



When the message was sent, Bobby closed the app and flung his phone carelessly onto the nightstand.



Each time Bobby thought about Verena beside Dr.Willis, it only made him more determined to steer Isaac toward marrying the doctor. After just a handful of conversations with that cold and cunning woman, he caught himself wanting to march over and ask Dr.Willis to marry lsaac on the spot. A woman like her,kind, elegant, and lovely, was exactly what lsaac needed.



It drove him crazy wondering how two people sharing the same last name could be so completely opposite.



Silence filled the room as Bobby's fist crashed against the mattress. Forget Verena-what mattered nowN was finding a way to bring lsaac and Dr. Willis together. He had no doubt that once they met, lsaac would be captivated.



Of course, Bobby understood his brother well enough to know that a direct suggestion would be rejected outright. But if he disguised it as a medical consultation, Isaac might agree without resistance.That way, his condition could be treated while their bond quietly deepened-a flawless plan.



The image of Isaac healthy again and standing beside Dr. Willis played vividly in Bobby's mind, fueling his resolve like fire.



Jumping to his feet, Bobby shoved on his shoes and strode quickly out of the room.



At the same time, Kaia studied Bobby's latest message,her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.



His sharp response confirmed he was seething, and Verena's reputation in his eyes was beyond repair.


The thought brought a smug smile to Kaia's lips as she hummed a light tune on her way to the bathroom to wash off her makeup.


As long as Bobby blocked the marriage, her lie would remain safe, because Verena would never get the chance to cross paths with him.



Inside the Bennett Mansion, Bobby made his way down the hall until he reached Isaac's door.



Remembering how badly Isaac had snapped at him the last time he barged in, Bobby decided to knock politely this time.


Isaac's voice called out, "Come in." Bobby placed his hand on the knob, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.



There he found Isaac propped against the headboard,a thick book resting in his hands.


With a forced laugh, Bobby strolled closer and teased,"So,buried in a book again?"


Setting the book down on the blanket, Isaac lifted his eyes and said, "Alright, what do you want?"


Dragging a chair from the desk, Bobby sat near the bed and grinned. "What else could it be?I just felt like  talking."



Most people might have believed him, but lsaac knew better. Bobby never came by at this hour unless something was on his mind.


After lifting the book again, Isaac resumed reading and said,"If you don't have a point, then get out."


Snatching the book from lsaac's hands, Bobby blurted out, "Okay, okay-I'lL say it."


Isaac kept his calm, watching Bobby in silence.



Meeting Isaac's steady gaze, Bobby's mouth tightened as he hesitated.



What he wanted was to rant about Verena's arrogance,but the memory of lsaac's harsh scolding last time made him switch tactics instead.



"So here's the thing-I came across an incredible doctor recently." Bobby's eyes sparked with enthusiasm as he leaned forward. "You wouldn't believe it. Every other doctor failed with Barrie's illness, but she actually managed to stabilize him!"

###Chapter 35 Why Not Just Give Her A Chance
Bobby leaned forward eagerly and blurted out, "Isaac,I've already added her on the chat app. Why don't you set up a time to meet her? I swear, with her skills, she could fix your legs for sure!"



He was too caught up in his own excitement to notice the faint crease forming on Isaac's brow.



The mention of Barrie's so-called recovery pulled a smirk from lsaac. Dozens of renowned doctors had failed, and yet this one was supposed to succeed?



Picking up his book, Isaac flipped the page and said evenly, "That won't be necessary. I know my own condition better than anyone. No matter how capable she is, it makes no difference for me."


While he spoke, an image of Verena surfaced in his thoughts.Why was it only her that stirred hope in him,only her he felt he could believe in?



His lips pressed into a thin line before he added, "I'm already in treatment. You don't need to involve yourself in this."



Up until now, Cayden had been the one overseeing  Isaac's treatment. So when Isaac mentioned being in treatment, Bobby immediately assumed Cayden was still handling it. He vaguely recalled Cayden once admitting that the surgery carried no more than a thirty percent chance of success.



It wasn't that Bobby distrusted Cayden's abilities, but faced with the promise of a doctor who appeared even more remarkable, his loyalties naturally shifted.


After all, Dr. Willis had claimed she'd successfully cured two patients with leg paralysis-and if that was true, then surely she was the better choice.



Realizing Isaac wasn't going to agree easily, Bobby decided to pour on the charm and persuasion.



"Isaac, I'm asking you to believe me. This doctor isn't ordinary. Think back to Barrie's illness a few years ago -every specialist, here and overseas, refused to take the risk of that impossible heart transplant. But she did it,and she pulled it off flawlessly. Please, just meet her once. Maybe she really can change everything for you."



When Isaac kept his eyes locked on the book,showing no sign of giving in, Bobby grew frantic and yelled,"Don't you even want the chance to walk on your own again?"



For just a second Isaac's hand stilled on the page, but then he calmly turned it and kept reading.


Catching himself, Bobby slapped a hand over his mouth and murmured, "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac."


Trying to recover, he added, "I only meant she's exceptional. If she could handle Barrie's case, she can handle yours too. Why not just give her a chance?"


Isaac had tolerated Bobby's endless peading,but the refusal to drop the subject left him weary,and a dull ache began to settle in his temples.


At last, Isaac closed the book, fixed him with a cold,unblinking look, and said, "Barrie's illness is different from mine, so don't compare them. Your praise for that doctor is just the view of an outsider, and it means nothing to me. I have no reason to meet her,and I won't be accepting her treatment."


Then his voice turned firm as he instructed, "That's enough. It's late. Go back to your room."



Bobby had clung to the hope that lsaac might finally say yes,but the blunt refusal knocked the wind out of him. A wave of sadness and frustration washed over him, because in his heart, everything he said had only been for lsaac's sake.


Bobby kept his frustration to himself. If Isaac didn't want him stepping in, then fine-he'd stop wasting energy on someone who clearly didn't want the help. Let him pick whichever doctor he wanted, and if he had someone in mind to marry, then so be it. That was his business now.



Resigned to it, Bobby sighed out a flat "okay" before dragging himself back to his room.







In the days that followed, Verena spent her time shuttling between the Lyons estate and the Willis Villa.


At last, after two long weeks of treatment,Verena pulled out the final needle from Barrie's leg and smiled. "Congratulations. From here on out, you won't need these sessions anymore."



Before Barrie had a chance to respond, Slater's eyes lit up with joy. "Are you serious, Dr. Willis? My grandpa truly doesn't need the treatment anymore?"



Verena gave a confident nod, and Slater immediately bowed in gratitude. "Thank you so much,Dr.Willis."


She steadied him by the shoulders and smiled. "His progress is thanks in part to the care you've given him."


"Indeed." From the bed, Barrie clasped Slater's hand,his dim eyes filled with warmth. "You've grown thin looking after me like this."



Placing his firm hand over Barrie's frail one, Slater met his gaze with devotion. "Grandpa, I don't feel tired at all. Nothing matters more than your health."


As Verena watched the tender exchange between grandfather and grandson, her thoughts drifted to her own grandmother, Shawna. If only Shawna were still alive... Without her, Verena had no real family left in this world.



A tightness formed in her throat, but Verena forced the memory away with a steady blink.


Turning back to Slater, she instructed, "His condition is stable,but small problems remain that need medicine.I'll write down the prescriptions, and you can handle preparing them for him."


Slater gave a firm nod. "Alright, I'll take care of it."



Devoted as ever, Slater personally took charge of preparing every dose of Barrie's medicine.



When Verena handed over the prescriptions and finished her instructions, she added warmly, "That's everything for now. I won't be coming for the treatments anymore, but if your grandfather feels unwell, just call me. Unless something unusual keeps me away, I'll come without hesitation."



Overwhelmed with gratitude, Slater kept thanking her again and again for helping his grandfather recover. Once Verena departed, Slater carried the herbal medicine she prescribed into the kitchen and began preparing the brew himself.


As the herbs simmered, Slater pulled out his phone and snapped a quick picture of the steaming pot


Grinning with pride, he uploaded the photo with a caption:"These remedies are working-Grandpa's legs are finally improving. Couldn't be happier!"



Back at the Willis Villa, relaxing on the sofa, Kaia scrolled idly through her phone until Slater's update appeared, sending a rush of excitement through her.The herbs and supplements she had sent to the Lyons estate had actually taken effect.


Pride swelled in her chest, and a smile tugged at her lips. Even the remedies she had chosen so casually were helping Barrie heal-it almost felt like proof she had a natural talent for medicine.



Scrolling back to reread his post, Kaia's grin widened until she let out a laugh. Everyone knew how devoted Slater was to his grandfather, so if Barrie's recovery was tied to the herbs and supplements she gave, then surely Slater would start viewing her differently.



From the couch nearby, Laura shifted her gaze from the TV when she heard Kaia laughing and asked with curiosity, "Kaia, what's on your phone that's got you so cheerful?"



With her cheeks warm from excitement, Kaia eagerly passed the phone to her mother and said, "Mom,you've got to see what Slater posted."



Peering at the screen for a moment, Laura's eyes went wide in surprise. "Goodness! Is that the same herbal medicine you sent over before?"
###Chapter 36 Since When Do You Care About Me
With a smug lift of her brow, Kaia remarked, "What else do you expect? Others hand out jewels or overpriced trinkets, but I'm the one who gave herbs and supplements."



At those words, Laura's face glowed with pride as she cupped Kaia's cheeks. "That's my daughter.Absolutely extraordinary!"



Satisfaction welled up in Laura's heart. She had always believed Kaia brought fortune to the family. After all,it was only after giving birth to Kaia that their fortunes rose,giving them the means to invest and step into high society.



Even with the Bennett family offering them advantages through marriage, Laura could sense Danica's condescension toward them.



In Laura's mind, whatever benefits came from the Bennetts would never last forever.



What she longed for were lasting gains, and winning the Lyons family's respect while widening her circle was far more valuable. Praise from a parent always struck deep, and Kaia's eyes curved with pride as satisfaction spread across her face.



From this moment, Laura grew more certain of one undeniable truth.



Gripping Kaia's shoulders, Laura spoke with fiery enthusiasm. "Kaia, do you see it now? Society is full of pretty socialites, but respected doctors are rare.The higher a family climbs, the more they obsess over their health. That's why you must master medicine.Once you do, powerful families will line up for your attention."



Her imagination ran wild with images of the most powerful people bending over backward to win her favor, and the very thought filled her with glee.



Catching Laura's meaning, Kaia nodded eagerly.She said sweetly, "Mom, you don't have to worry. I'll take medicine seriously. Just think, if it weren't for the herbs and supplements I picked out, Slater's grandfather would probably still be stuck in bed.Clearly, I've got a real gift for this."



Laura's heart swelled with relief at Kaia's words, but before she could respond, Verena stepped in from the doorway.



The sight of the cozy scene between mother anddaughter didn't surprise Verena anymore; she had grown desensitized to it.



She was about to slip by without a word when Laura's voice cut through the room.



"Where did you run off to this time?" Laura asked.



Before, Laura wouldn't have cared where Verena had gone. Yet with Kaia filling her with pride today, she couldn't help but measure one daughter against the other. How could her two daughters be so completely different?



The more she compared them, the more bitterness and resentment churned in her chest.



Stopping in her tracks, Verena shot Laura a sidelong glance. "Since when do you care about me?"



Laura shot up from her seat, clearly put off by Verena's tone. "Who do you think you're trying to impress with that superior act? Save it for someone else who'll actually put up with it."



Laura's gaze drifted proudly to Kaia. "See the difference? Kaia has always been thoughtful and obedient. She's in college now, and every teacher sings her praises. Just recently, with a few herbs she picked out, she even managed to help someone recover." Then she turned, pointing a sharp finger at Verena."And you? You failed to get into college, and then wasted time trailing after some self-taught village healer, picking up nothing but a foultemper.At your age, you're still a nobody. You can't even greet your own mother properly-forget skill, you don't even have basic manners."



Silent,Verena fixed her gaze on Laura. Each word felt like a needle pressing into her skin, hitting the rawest part of her.



From the day her younger sister was born, she had sensed Laura's dislike. Still, she had never imagined that, in her mother's eyes, she meant absolutely nothing. She had told herself she wanted nothing from her parents, that nothing could wound her anymore.But why then did the chill inside feel so sharp?



Her throat constricted, and she forced a faint curl of her lips. In a near whisper, she said, "Ye5, I am rude,because after | turned seven, I no longer had a mother."



The year Kaia was born, Verena had just turned seven,and from that moment, a mother's affection vanished from her life.



Laura remained rooted in place after hearing those words, her mind blank, and it was only after Verena disappeared upstairs that she slowly returned to Kaia caught sight of the odd look on Laura's face, a look she despised whenever it was connected to Verena.



Biting her lip, Kaia moved closer and clutched her mother's arm. "Mom, with Verena's attitude, do you honestly think she is fit for joining the Bennett family?"



The moment she heard the question,whatever mix of emotions had been on Laura's face gave way to a firm,unyielding look.



Casting a cold glance toward the staircase, Laura remarked, "Suitable or not, she has to marry into the Bennett family."



Kaia understood all too well that profit always outweighed everything else in Laura's eyes. Her question hadn't been to get the answer she wanted but only to shift Laura's focus. The last thing she wanted was to watch her mother show guilt toward Verena.



With the moment behind them,Laura and Kaia settled back on the sofa, slipping easily into their familiar bond.



As Laura turned her attention back to the television,Kaia busied herself by boasting about her newest triumph to her circle of shallow friends. Inside the group chat with her friends, KCaia eagerly sent a message, saying, "Girls, I've got some good news to share."



Almost immediately, a friend replied in excitement,"What happened? Spill it!"


Kaia snapped a screenshot of Slater's update,dropped it into the chat, and added, "See this? The herbs and supplements I gave actually worked, didn't they?"


One of the women who also followed Slater reacted in shock. "Seriously? Those herbs in his post came from you?"


With pride swelling in her chest, Kaia answered,"That's right. I am studying medicine after all. I simnply chose some herbs and supplements that suited his grandfather's condition, and to my surprise, they worked."



At the end of her message, she tacked on a shy little emoji.



The chat quickly filled with envy, her friends gushing again and again about how amazing it was to be studying medicine.



Then one of them asked, "Kaia, after helping them like that, the Lyons family has to invite you to dinner,don't they?" Another one quickly added, "Dinner is just the beginning. With the Lyons family's influence, your position in society is sure to climb, Kaia."


Reading their chatter, Kaia couldn't hide her wide grin as she responded, "Please, I didn't help Slater's grandfather just to get a free meal."



Even as she denied it, her thoughts were already drifting into daydreams. After all, with the help she'd given, it was only natural that the Lyons family would invite her to dinner. And dinner with the Lyons family meant more than food-it meant an opening.




...


Back in her room, Verena showered, settled at her desk, and reached for her phone to send lsaac a message.
###Chapter 37 A Husband Reporting To His Wife

Verena sent a message, saying, "Just a gentle reminder. Don't forget you have treatment tomorrow morning."



At that moment, Isaac was tending to the plants on his balcony when the message came through.



Placing the watering can aside, he reached for his phone and answered, "Alright. I'll remember."



From experience, Verena knew he was the type tocut conversations short. Perched on the edge of her bed with a towel in hand, she rubbed her damp hair and asked, "Still awake? What are you doing right now?"



Without giving it much thought, Isaac opened his camera, took a quick photo, and sent it with the note:"Watering plants."



She had expected no more than a curt reply, so the photo caught her off guard, giving her the odd impression of a husband reporting to his wife.



Opening the picture, she saw rows of neatly kept plants on the balcony, evidence of the attention he had given them. The shot was simple and unplanned, yet it showed his legs and one arm draped over the armrest of his wheelchair.



Even with nothing fancy about it, the photo carried a quiet charm that was hard to explain.


Reading the short explanation beneath the photo,Verena suddenly pictured him standing in front of her,giving his answer in that plain, steady way of his.


A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and she began typing a teasing reply on her screen.



After pressing send, Isaac found himself unexpectedly unsettled.



To his surprise, he caught himself waiting for her response with unusual anticipation.



From a reasonable standpoint, it was nothing more than an ordinary conversation.



What he failed to notice was how the firm and unshakable man he was in business had turned hesitant,second-guessing himself.


At that moment, his phone buzzed, and any thought  of pulling back his message vanished as he hurried to open it. What arrived was a voice message from Verena,saying,"I was only asking casually. What, do you think I won't believe you? You even sent a picture.Honestly,it feels like a husband reporting to his wife, worried she won't trust him, so he has to send proof."



When the voice note finished playing, Isaac pressed his lips together. The casual way she spoke of "husband" and "wife" set his ears burning.


A second voice message soon arrived. "In that case,I enjoy it. I hope you'll keep this little habit, Mr. Bennett."


Hearing her playful tone, Isaac's fingers clenched tighter around the phone, and a faint glimmer of a smile lit his deep eyes.


Because her voice carried such softness and teasing closeness, Isaac found himself at a loss for words.His fingers lingered above the screen, unable to type a reply.



As nearly five minutes slipped by with no answer,Verena realized he was most likely retreating into silence once again.



Letting out a soft sigh, she chose to stop pressing him.


She tapped out a short message and sent it. "Alright then. I was only teasing. Don't feel pressured.Sleep well.Goodnight."


Once the message was delivered, Verena set her phone aside and slipped into bed.



As Isaac read her words, he could almost picture her smiling,full of warmth and patience.



His mind drifted back to the bridal shop,where he had turned down her request, and she had smiled then too,saying it was fine.



It struck himn that she seemed to hold limitless patience when it came to him.



All at once, Isaac's chest tightened. He pressed a hand against his heart, sensing a peculiar wave of emotion rising inside.


He struggled to name it, for the feeling was both heavy and suffocating yet oddly filled with joy.


The swirl of emotions consumed him until they fused into a single, vivid memory.



He remembered their first meeting,when Verena had crouched down, lifted her eyes to his, and whispered,"Don't turn me away."



Pulling himself out of the memory, Isaac finally typed out a message to her.



Yet no answer came to him immediately. By the next morning, Verena opened her eyes and found Isaac's message waiting.


His reply was brief. "I'll do my best. Goodnight."


Reading those words, Verena's lips curved into a gentle smile.


To her, it felt as though he was making an effort to bridge the distance between them.



Her playful remarks the night before had not gone wasted.



Rising from bed, Verena drew open the curtains,allowing warm sunlight to pour into the room.



The brilliance outside told her it would be a lovely day.


Once she had freshened up, Verena got into her car and headed out.


This particular day marked Isaac's scheduled treatment.




Upon reaching the hospital, she found Isaac waiting for her.



Placing her medical kit aside, Verena glanced around and noticed Isaac was the only one there.



She tilted her head slightly and asked, "Wasn't Dr. Moore supposed to be here today?"


Even though Cayden had stopped resisting her involvement, he had still attended every session until now.



That was why his absence caught Verena off guard


Isaac massaged his temples and said, "He's occupied with an important surgery today."



Noticing the faint crease in his brows and the tiredness in his face, Verena knelt before him and asked, "What's wrong? Did you not sleep properly last night?"


At the mention of the night before, Isaac lowered his gaze, stole a quick look at her, and then turned aside,murmuring uneasily, "About last night... I'm sorry."


With her brows lifting in puzzlement, she asked,"What do you mean by that? Why would you apologize?"


At her words, Isaac turned his eyes toward her.


Sounding both surprised and careful, he asked, "You're really not angry?"


After thinking it over, Verena realized he must have believed she was upset because she hadn't answered his message the night before. Finding his concern a little amusing, she said, "I was already asleep by that time. I only noticed your message when I woke up this morning."



Tilting her head with a sparkle in her gaze, she added,"So that's the reason you couldn't sleep properly?"


While she talked, Verena studied him closely,catching every subtle change in his expression.



Isaac shifted his eyes away from her piercing stare,uncertain of how to reply.



Deep down, he knew she had hit the mark.



He had no explanation for why it mattered so much to him whether she was upset.



If he thought about it logically, he should have known that someone as patient as her wouldn't grow angry over a slow reply.



When his silence stretched on, Verena laughed lightly."Alright then. Let's get started with the treatment."



Saying this, she stepped forward, ready to help him onto the bed.



Using his hands to roll the wheelchair back,Isaac said,"No,that won't be necessary. My assistant will help me."



During earlier sessions, when Cayden was there,it had  always been him who helped Isaac onto the bed.


Verena reached out and brought the wheelchair to a stop,cutting off his movements.



Looking straight at him, she said, "Isaac, since we're about to be married, helping you onto the bed is something I'll be doing sooner or later. You don't have to push me away."


Helping him onto the bed...


Color rose slowly across Isaac's face.


He understood her words carried no hidden meaning,spoken simply and sincerely.


Still,his thoughts ran wild against his will.


Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Verena caught his hesitation and smiled, believing he questioned her strength. "I can handle it. Just trust me."


For Verena, such a task was hardly worth mentioning.



Back in Clokron, she had once hauled an injured Isaac on her back through two entire streets.



Determination glimmered softly in her dark eyes.


For a moment, Isaac's mind emptied, and he simply nodded his consent. Once he gave in, Verena lifted his arm, draped it around her neck, and steadied it on her shoulder.



Using both hands, she braced his upper body and gathered her strength to raise him.


Once on his feet, Isaac loomed above her slight frame.Guiding him toward the bed, Verena strained with effort, and faint veins surfaced across her forehead.



Seeing her struggle, Isaac felt a sharp ache pierce his chest.



What if...



If he never regained his strength,would she be forced to carry his weight like this forever?



As his thoughts slowly cleared, Isaac realized he was already lyingon the hospital bed.
###Chapter 38 Don't Cry



Once Isaac was settled on the bed, Verena pulled a pair of scissors from her kit and neatly snipped open the hem of his suit trousers.


For the procedure to work properly, his trousers could not press against his thighs, or it would reduce the effect.



Before her eyes, his evenly built legs came into view.


Even after multiple sessions, Isaac still flushed with embarrassment whenever his legs were exposed to her gaze like this.



The beginnings of atrophy were already visible along his legs.



Shutting his eyes, Isaac pressed his fists tightly against the sheets at his sides.



Catching sight of his withdrawn posture, Verena remained silent,reaching instead for the silver needles to start the treatment.



Following her usual routine, she questioned Isaac a bout the sensations he felt with each needle she placed. The responses, however,were the same as before.


Still, Verena reminded herself this was only the beginning, and her confidence in curing him remained firm.



Within half an hour, the session came to an end.



While pulling out the needles one at a time, Verena repeated her usual reminder. "After treatment, don't let yourself get cold. Stay away from drafts or cool air,and watch your diet carefully. Avoid spicy or overly stimulating food."



When her hand moved toward the needle near the root of his thigh, her fingers unintentionally brushed against Isaac's skin.



Her eyes flicked upward, landing on his crotch,still covered by the dark gray fabric of his trousers.


From years of practice, Verena knew that patients with paralysis in the lower limbs often struggled with sexual dysfunction as well.


Back when she first reunited with Isaac after returning to the country, he had admitted that he was unable to function as a normal man.



She longed to raise the matter, but judging by lsaac's fragile state of mind, she knew another time would be more fitting.



Isaac might have lost sensation in his legs, but his eyes missed nothing. The directness of her gaze was impossible to overlook. Had she finally discovered the truth of his condition?



A crushing heaviness pressed against lsaac's chest,leaving himn unable to put his inner turmoil into words.In a rush, he ignored his condition and tried to push himself upright from the bed's edge.



Harsh reality struck when his arms gave out just as he managed to raise himself slightly, sending him collapsing back onto the mattress.


The sudden noise jolted Verena from her thoughts,and believing he only wished to rise, she quickly assisted him into his wheelchair.



"You should just call me next time," she remarked gently.


With his head lowered, lsaac murmured softly,"Thanks."



His assistant guided him into the changing room to put him into a clean pair of suit trousers.



In that moment, Isaac was overcome with a sense of humiliation. Even changing his trousers required another's hand. His fingers clenched tightly around the wheelchair's armrest. How could he possibly think of marrying her while trapped in such a condition?


When he didn't come out after some time had passed,Verena stood at the door and called out softly,"Isaac."


Isaac rolled out from the changing room, his voice deliberately casual as he asked, "What is it?"


Verena's eyes drifted toward him; dressed now in black trousers, his long legs still appeared striking despite the chair beneath him.



Her eyes shifted upward, lingering for a moment just beneath his waist.


Her initial plan had been to restore his legs first, to rebuild his confidence before tackling the deeper issue. Yet now, that approach felt like taking too much time. These issues could be treated at the same time.


Deciding it was wiser to face the problem head-on rather than delay it, Verena asked bluntly, "How serious is the damage to your male function?"


The sharp screech of the wheelchair brakes filled the room, jolting lsaac's body forward from the sudden halt.



Isaac's hand went rigid on the wheel, and after a pause,he lifted his head and asked hesitantly, "What did you just say?" "Stay calm," Verena said casualy, adopting her professional tone. "I'm asking because I need a clearer picture of your condition. In cases like yours,sexual dysfunction is common, but most of it can be treated. So whatever | ask next, I want you to answer honestly.It will affect how much I can help you regain."



Her voice carried no judgment, only calm professionalism, though she failed to see how deeply such words could wound a man's pride.



Isaac attempted to remind himself she was only his doctor. The reality, however, was harsher-she was also his fiancée. Both of them knew his issues, yet hearing such a question spoken aloud made him feel as if every fragment of his shame had been dragged into the open.



Though Isaac understood these questions were standard procedure, speaking about them in front of her tore at him with unbearable pain, as though his chest were being ripped apart. Every word felt like a cruel reminder that he was not only crippled but possibly impotent. Whether recovery was even possible remained unknown, but already he had begun grasping at fragile hopes.



For a long stretch, Isaac said nothing, and then gave a slow nod. When his voice finally emerged,it was low and strained. "Go ahead, ask." Once she saw his consent, Verena drew out a pen and flipped open her notebook.



Her first question was simple. "Do you often use sleeping pills?"



Isaac paused, and then gave a short nod."Occasionally"




From the night of the accident six months ago, Isaac had not known a single night of restful sleep.


He only swallowed two pills on the nights before a critical event or work obligation, hoping at least to function properly the following day.


Beyond that, his nights were either shattered by nightmares or consumed by vivid memories of the crash, memories that clung to him like a shadow and ate away at his mind. At times,he drifted into a hollow daze; more often, he simply lay awake. Again and again, he had to remind himself that his father's death was the weight he carried.


When the word "occasionally" reached her ears,Verena frowned and set her pen still for a moment.She understood his temperament far too well, and she knew he would never take sleeping pills unless an important event waited for him the next day. She suspected that on all the other nights, he chose to torment himself with memories instead. Once she finished writing down his answer, Verena lifted her gaze and asked, "Do you ever struggle with erectile dysfunction?"



Her voice remained steady, carrying the weight of a question spoken as though it were no more than a passing detail.


To Isaac, however, the words cut sharply, and hearing them from her made it sting all the more.



His hands clamped down on the wheels of the chair,and the veins on the back of his palms rose in strained ridges.



By then, Isaac no longer had the courage to form a single word.



He gave a firm nod, dropped his head low,and kept his eyes far from Verena's.



From above his bowed figure came the faint scratch of her pen moving across the page.



Isaac felt his heart sink like a stone. He thought that from the very start, he should never have clung to hope for his condition. He regretted ever agreeing to the marriage arrangement, for it had given Verena the chance to treat him and filled him with expectations he never should have carried. Verena had finished jotting down the information and prepared to ask another question,but when she lifted her eyes, she caught sight of Isaac's bowed head and the pitiful way he sat before her.



Although the room was filled with warmth, he sat in his wheelchair wearing only a thin white shirt. Sunlight filtered in from outside and stretched across his narrow frame, giving him an appearance so fragile and delicate it almost seemed unreal.


At that moment, Verena realized that her questions,which had seemed routine to her, had burdened him with unbearable shame.



The realization struck her heart with pain, and an overwhelming urge rose within her to pull him into her arms.



"Isaac." Verena spoke his name, and when his gaze lifted, she bent down so her soft lips could graze his lowered eyelids with the lightest touch.


Isaac sat in shock, his body frozen as though bound by stillness.



Verena drew herself upright and said in a quiet voice,"You promised you would trust me. So why are you so sad now? Your condition didn't come only from the accident. It's tied to your emotions and your state of mind. I told you that I would heal you, and I meant it. Have you stopped believing me?"


While speaking, she knitted her brows together and stole glances at Isaac's expression from the edge of her vision.



When she caught the faint shift in his expression,Verena lowered her head as if showing weakness. "Is it that you doubt me because I once worked as a doctor in a small town? Do you also see me as someone from a backward place, without knowledge,just like the ones who look down on me?"



By the time her words faltered with the edge of tears,Isaac grew unsettled, unable to bear the thought of her crying. In a rush, he blurted out, "No,I never thought that."



Recognizing the worry on his face, Verena refused to let him off so quickly. She kept her head lowered and made her shoulders tremble in a show of helplessness



Watching her like this left Isaac with the feeling that his heart was suspended in emptiness,reaching for something always just out of reach.



His hand lifted with hesitation, as if he meant to wipe away her tears. His voice caught as he said, "Don't cry.I believe you. I always will. You're going to be my wife Why would I ever look down on you?"


When his fingers stretched forward, they were caught gently in her slender hand.
###Chapter 39 You Seem To Be Enjoying It
Before Isaac could react, Verena lifted her head in one swift motion.



Her smile shone brightly, like sunlight breaking through a spring morning haze



With her head tilted slightly, her eyes curved with delight as she said, "'It's good that you think this way."



Her words came like a feather's touch, light and teasing, as she leaned in once again, brushing a kiss across the corner of Isaac's lips.



A tide of emotion crashed through Isaac.



She kissed him like she had done that many times,every gesture unforced, every glance assured.


His heart seemed to falter for a beat, while a faint fragrance clung to the air between them, leaving his mind stripped bare, unable to muster a single thought in return.



His lashes quivered, his gaze fixed yet vacant, staring at the woman before him as if spellbound. 
Noticing his daze, Verena's lips curved higher.Dissatisfied with his stillness, she leaned closer once more.



All he could see now was her face magnified in his vision-those fluttering lashes, the delicate arc of her features.



Her hand intertwined with his, and her lips found his again.



This was her third kiss of the day.



Was she simply exercising the privileges of being his future wife?



Or could it be... she truly cared for him?



Though Isaac entertained both thoughts, the latter rang louder in his heart.


Once planted, the idea grew like ivy, winding deeper into his mind.



His throat tightened; he swallowed hard, no longer holding back the frantic rhythm of his heart as he slowly closed his eyes.



But just as he surrendered, her lips left his.



When she saw him close his eyes, Verena's smile deepened. She leaned near his ear, her voice low and playful. "You seem to be enjoying it, don't you?


Her tone was deliberately laced with allure, threaded with a hint of mischief.



Isaac snapped back to his senses, eyes flying open,only to find her face inches away,her cheek nearly brushing his.



Meeting her gaze, he felt his heart skip, and then darted his eyes aside, clearing his throat instead of answering her teasing words.



That was when he noticed his hand was still laced with hers, fingers locked together.



His fingers were defined, smooth, and slender, yet they still seemed plain against hers.


Her hand, soft and delicate, wvith slender proportions and faint pink joints, reminded him of fine porcelain,flawless and fragile.



Verena,unaware of the thoughts lingering in his silence, tilted her head, forcing him to meet her eyes once more. Her lips curved as she teased, "Why aren't you answering me?"



Unable to retreat any further, Isaac's ears flushed red,his Adam's apple bobbing nervously.



"I..." His husky voice had barely formed when his phone vibrated from his suit pocket, cutting him off.



Their gazes locked; Isaac looked at Verena with a question in his eyes.


Amused by his expression, Verena released his hand,rose to her feet, and nodded. "Go ahead, answer it."



Isaac clenched his slightly damp palm, pulled out his phone with his other hand, and accepted the call.


The voice on the other end spoke first. "Hello, Mr.Bennett. I'm calling from Weaving Love Bridal Shop.The photos you and Mrs. Bennett took are ready.When would you like to come in with your wifeto select them?"



"Is it the bridal shop?" The room was quiet enough for Verena to overhear.



Isaac nodded, tilting the phone slightly aside. "They're asking when we want to choose the photos."



"Are you busy this afternoon?" she asked.



Isaac hesitated briefly, already sensing what she was leading toward. Then he shook his head. "Only minor tasks-I can leave them to my assistant."



Her lips curved. "Since neither of us is occupied, let's go today." With a slight smile, lsaac gave a short grunt of agreement before telling the staff member, "We'll be there shortly."


He quickly delegated his tasks to his assistant,leaving the driver to take the assistant back to the company.


And so, Isaac rode in Verena's car to the bridal shop.


When they arrived, the staff greeted them warmly.


The same young sales assistant who had initially been dismissive toward Verena last time now hurried forward, offering her a glass of water.



Though Verena remembered the slight, she let it pass,accepting the glass casually and taking a sip.



Seeing her calm demeanor, the sales assistant exhaled in relief.



Verena and Isaac settled onto the sofa, reviewing the photos displayed on the computer.


The staff member handled the mouse with care,pausing at each image for their input.


They viewed several shots, most showing lsaac's solemn face.


"Mrs. Bennett, what do you think of this one?" the staff member asked respectfully. 
Verena studied the photo, unimpressed. "Next."


The staff member scrolled down



"And this?"



She furrowed her brows slightly, raising her chin."Next."



They had selected three earlier, but nothing had pleased them since.



Though both were strikingly attractive, Isaac's expression remained stiff in most shots.



After nearly a dozen more images, Verena's eyes lit up.



In the displayed photo, her arms were looped around Isaac's neck, her body angled on his lap.


She tilted her face upward, while he leaned down,their lips touching lightly, noses nearly brushing-an intimate scene frozen in time.



The staff member, waiting for judgment, held the mouse still.



After gazing for a long moment, Verena's lips curved as she pointed, telling the staff member, "This one's my favorite. Make it large and frame it; I'll hang it in our bedroom."

  Her words sent Isaac's heart into a stutter.



The photo had captured the exact moment she kissed him spontaneously.



He hadn't expected it to turn out so vivid, so genuine -like a portrait of love itself.



And what surprised him most: Verena had claimed it as her favorite.



His mind replayed the sensation of her kiss that day,heat rising to his ears.



So,she liked such closeness,did she?



His shyness ebbed as he looked more closely, noticing a detail missed before.



She hadn't been sitting fully on his lap-a slight ggap remained.



Since his legs couldn't feel anything, he had thought she had truly sat upon him.



But clearly,she hadn't.



The memory surfaced: after the photo was taken,Verena had risen with an awkward stretch of her legs.



Only then did Isaac realize-she must have been balancing on her toes for too long, until her feet went numb.



Quietly, without a word, she had spared him discomfort. In the smallest of details he had overlooked,she had been thoughtful of his condition.



His heart stirred again, beating wildly as if it had slipped its cage, unable to settle back where it belonged.


While he drifted in these thoughts, two photos had already flickered past on the screen.



Then Verena seemed to recall something, turning her face toward him. "Oh, I forgot to ask your opinion.What do you think of this photo?"



Isaac had never been close with other women,though in his world of fame and fortune, many had approached him. Whether their gestures had been intentional or casual, he had always seen through them.


Now,looking at Verena-her innocent eyes meeting his with unguarded sincerity-an unfamiliar tide rose in his chest, carrying unspoken thoughts he could neither voice nor contain.



Just as Verena thought he might retreat into silence or deflect with indifference,. Isaac smiled softly."You're my future wife, Verena; you decide."



His voice carried justenough weight to reach the ears of those nearby.


Several female staff covered their mouths, whispering with envy. "Oh my, he's so gentle."


Verena froze,momentarily stunned. Warmth rushed to her cheeks, pulling her back to reality



As her gaze lingered in Isaac's bright eyes, she quickly pressed her lips together and turned back toward the computer, leaving him only her profile.


Isaac's eyes flickered with a newfound realization.



His gaze rested on the faint blush coloring her cheeks.


So-she could be shy as well.


By the time the sun had lowered its light, the selection of wedding photos was complete.



Isaac's assistant was already waiting at the entrance of the bridal shop. When everything was wrapped up,Verena and Isaac each departed in their own cars.



Some days later, Verena sat reviewing her freshly completed manuscript for a medical book.


Stretching her limbs, she felt her phone buzz across the desk.



The screen lit up with a name: "Gavin Reid." Gavin was one of her assistants.



Unlike Julianna, he was still a medical student, and his family carried notable influence in Shoildon.



In truth, he had been sent by his father to study under her guidance.


Yet despite those circumstances, Gavin and Verena shared a natural ease in working together.
###Chapter 40 Who Are You With
With a light laugh, Verena lifted her phone and accepted the call.


Before she could speak, an enthusiastic voice burst through the line. "Evelyn, I'm back from overseas!|just landed at Shoildon Airport. Do you have time to come get me? Let's go out for a meal; it's on me."


Securing the files from her desk inside the drawer,Verena answered, "Alright, wait there for me."


Once the call ended, she made her way to the garage and started her car.



The Willis Villa stood far from Shoildon Airport, a drive that took nearly forty minutes.



Inside the sprawling terminal, crowds of travelers bustled about.



Even among the masses, Verena's eyes landed on Gavin right away.



He was impossible to overlook, with his tall build and striking looks setting him apart As she walked from the entrance toward him, several young women attempted to draw his attention with admiring glances.



Gavin spotted her the moment she entered the hall,though one person after another approached him before he could move.



Just as he was about to head in Verena's direction,a blue-eyed blonde lady stopped him with a question.



Keeping his manners, Gavin remarked, "I'm sorry, but my friend is here to meet me. If you're trying to find the restroom, the staff can help you."



After speaking, he stepped past the lady and went directly toward Verena.



Verena cast a glance at the lady he had brushed off and teased, "It's been a while, but clearly you charm hasn't worn off."



Looking a little embarrassed, Gavin scratched his head and replied, "Evelyn, don't tease me like that."


Verena corrected him lightly, saying, "Here, just call me Dr. Willis."



Realizing he was a little shy, she chose not to tease him further. With a nod toward the exit, she said,"Come on, let's go. Didn't you promise me a meal?" Gavin arched a brow and replied, "Of course. You think I'd go back on my word? Let's go."



...


The Fortune Garden Restaurant ranked among the finest places in Shoildon, famed for its luxury and exclusivity, and often filled with the city's elite.



Without influence and deep pockets, an ordinary person would need half a year's pay just to afford a single drink there.



Outside, the entrance gleamed with a golden signboard, and a long red carpet extended thirty feet from the steps, lined with attendants greeting every guest.



A waiter guided them to a table reserved for them on the first floor.



Their seating was in the main hall, separated only by flower arrangements.



Gavin had hoped to secure a private room, but every one of them had already been booked.


Passing her handbag to the server, Verena looked at Gavin with a smile. "You've certainly gone big the moment you got back."

 Grinning broadly, Gavin replied, "Taking you out deserves nothing less, Dr. Willis."


Service moved swiftly in the upscale restaurant. As soon as a dish was set down, Gavin gestured toward it and said, "This one's their signature. Try it."


Lifting the serving spoon, Verena placed a portion of fish onto her plate and sampled it.


After nodding in approval, she remarked, "They've turned the fish into something delicate, free of any strong smell, yet rich in flavor. No wonder this place has such a name in Shoildon."



Then, as something came to mind, Verena asked, "By the way, are you done handling things over there?"


Gavin gave a shake of his head. "I managed most of it,but Julianna is finishing the rest."


With curiosity in her eyes, Verena asked, "So why did you come back so suddenly?"


Verena knew him too well; Gavin was never the type to leave things unfinished without a pressing reason.


Just as she had expected, he answered with sincerity,"There's someone here who matters a great deal to me. If I don't return now, I might lose my only chance."

 Her brow arched slightly, surprise flickering across her face for only an instant.



"So it's the girl in that photo you keep tucked in your wallet?" she asked.



That image was still clear in her mind; the girl looked sweet and innocent.



At the mention of the girl he admired, Gavin's features softened, and a rare gentleness settled over him.



He gave a small nod and admitted, "Yes. She's the one."


Turning the conversation back to her, Gavin asked,"And you? Word is you're marrying Mr. Bennett. You came back for him, didn't you? I remember how long he chased after you, and everyone thought it was hopeless. Looks like he finally won."


His words stirred memories of Isaac, who, despite constant doubt from others, had never stopped pursuing her and had given more than anyone else.



Her eyes grew tender without her even realizing it.



Without the slightest hesitation, Verena answered,"Yes. He's the reason I came back."



The thought of lsaac curved her lips into a gentle  smile, one that lit up her face with striking beauty.



Unaware of it herself, that glowing smile drew the gaze of a man seated on the second floor of the restaurant.



Isaac held his phone to his ear, listening to his secretary, though his eyes never left the sight below.


"Mr. Bennett, regarding the project..." his secretary remarked.



Isaac barely registered the words; all he noticed was Verena reaching over to fix the man's tie.



His lashes trembled as he swallowed the surge of bitterness, answering in a cold tone, "Some matters don't require you to check with me every time."



Ending the call abruptly, Isaac lowered the phone and set it aside.



From his place above, Isaac kept staring at the sight unfolding beneath him.



Across the table sat two figures, both youthful and striking in appearance.



Verena's radiant smile held such warmth and charm that Isaac found himself unable to turn away.



Across from her, the man carried himself with easy poise, his good looks enhanced by the cheer and confidence he projected.



Instead of continuing to watch, lsaac bent his head and seized his motionless legs with desperate force.



Though he urged his body to respond, no spark of feeling stirred in his legs.



What answered him instead was a sharp ache in his chest that refused to relent.



In that instant, Isaac understood just how wide the gulf was between himself and men who still stood whole.



To his eyes, Verena seemed to belong far more naturally at the side of that young man.



For a moment, he lifted his gaze, but it quickly sank again before he spun his chair and rolled away.



Overhead,the faint sound of wheels reached Verena's ears,instantly familiar.


With a fork in hand, she froze and lifted her head without thinking, her eyes sweeping the room.


Gavin noticed her distraction and asked, "Dr. Willis, did you just see someone you know?"



Finding no familiar face, Verena gave a small shake of  her head. "No. I thought I did, but | was wrong."


Her finger drifted toward Gavin's tie as she said,"Don't forget to give that tie back later."



The tie had once been lsaac's, and he had left it in her place.


It never crossed her mind that Gavin would arrive wearing it.



With a sheepish grin, Gavin explained, "Julianna told me to bring it for you. She said you needed it right away. I didn't have the space to pack it because I was rushing, so I decided to wear it instead."



Verena gave an exasperated roll of her eyes, thinking she had never met anyone quite so annoyingly straightforward.



Back inside the private room, lsaac listened as his business partner kept going on and on.



Instead of absorbing any of it, Isaac let the words slip past him.



No matter how hard he tried, his mind kept circling back to Verena, picturing her sharing laughter with that good-looking stranger at the table.



A sudden thought struck him-he, her fiancé, had never even shared a simple meal at the same table with Verena.



Admitting it to himself felt strange, but lsaac realized this unfamiliar ache in his chest was nearly driving him out of his mind.



Without thinking, he set his wine glass down with enough force to send a sharp clink ringing through the air.


Startled by the sudden noise, his business partner paused mid-sentence, worried he had overstepped after a few drinks and started to apologize.Before he could finish, Isaac interjected, "I'm sorry. There's something I need to take care of. Please excuse me for a bit."



Feeling a sudden urgency, lsaac grabbed his phone,opened the chat app, and tapped the contact pinned to the top of his chat list.



For a few moments, his fingers hovered above the screen, frozen. Then he finally typed a message,saying,"What are you doing right now,Verena?"


Just as she was halfway through her meal,Verena's phone buzzed with lsaac's message, and a mix of confusion and delight crossed her face.



Not once since his memory loss had he reached out like this, asking about her first. Setting her fork aside, Verena's lips curled into a smile as she responded, "I'm just having a meal."



Trusting in her honesty, lsaac found himself asking another question. "Who are you with?"


Phone in hand, Verena arched an eyebrow at the sudden burst of questions-especially the edge in his tone that didn't sound like him at all.


Unsure why he was acting so strangely,she frowned a little but still answered truthfully, "I'm with a friend."



Once she hit send, Verena waited but no new messages arrived from Isaac's side.


The silence left her baffled. Even though Isaac never said much in their chats, he was always the one who wrapped things up.



But this time, the conversation simply stopped with no word from him.



Remembering the faint echo of wheels rolling overhead earlier, Verena's eyebrow lifted in sudden realization.



Could it be that Isaac was in the same restaurant after all?


 
If that was true, it might explain why he was acting so of charaacter.



Without wasting a second, Verena turned to Gavin and said, "I'm really sorry, but something urgent just came up. Next time, let me know what your favorite dish is,and dinner's on me."



After grabbing the bag the server passed to her, she made her way upstairs in a rush.
###Chapter 41 You're The Only One | Choose
Gavin's eyes followed Verena's fading silhouette, his mind reeling. Was she truly walking away without another word?



Upstairs,the second floor held rows of private rooms,usually reserved for the wealthy and influential to hold their serious negotiations.



Once she climbed the stairs, Verena moved down the long corridor until her eyes landed on Isaac's assistant posted outside a door.



That sight confirmed it-Isaac was definitely inside.



Without hesitation, she quickened her steps toward the room.



The plush carpet absorbed the sharp click of her heels,rendering her footsteps nearly noiseless.



Not until Verena stood right at the doorway did the assistant finally notice her presence.



At once, he nodded in respect. "Miss Willis."



Then, he politely asked, "What brings you here?"
Offering only a small nod, Verena ignored his question and shifted her gaze toward the closed door. "Is Isaac inside?" she asked.



He confirmed with a nod. "Yes, Mr. Bennett is currently discussing a business deal with a partner."


Then he added cautiously, "Would you like me to let him know you're here?" | Choose scandal reporter."



Without hesitation, she added, "Go ahead and enjoy your food,then head home. Don't wait around for me.Think of this meal as my treat."



Almost at once, a simple OK emoji popped up on her screen.



Sliding her phone into her handbag, Verena patiently waited for the meeting inside to end.



Within the private room, the business associate checked his watch and realized their discussion had stretched close to four hours.



The atmosphere around lsaac carried such an oppressive weight that every passing minute felt longer than it was. At first, the negotiations had gone smoothly, but once Isaac stepped outside for a phone call and returned with a storm locked behind his eyes,the atmosphere never lifted. His reputation for being aloof and commanding suddenly felt understated-the pressure in the room bordered on suffocating.



At last, after offering one compromise after another,the man saw lsaac give a faint nod of approval. His endless persuasion throughout the afternoon had finally paid off.



Rising to his feet, the partner reached out for a handshake,which lsaac accepted with cold composure before responding evenly, "You may go now."



Taking the cue, the partner smiled politely. "In that case, I'll take my leave, Mr. Bennett."



Silence reclaimed the room, yet lsaac's mind refused to quiet. He kept replaying the image of Verena adjusting that man's tie.



Ties and belts-those were touches reserved for someone close, someone trusted. Even though Verena had clarified in the message that the man was a friend, and he warned himself not to read too much into it, the thought gnawed at him all the same.



With his head bowed, Isaac's eyes lingered on his useless legs, a shadow of ridicule flickering within. The man she had been with earlier was whole, strong,walking freely-everything Isaac no longer was.


While Isaac sank deeper into his thoughts, the quiet creak of the door breaking open drew his attention.



Believing it must be his assistant, Isaac didn't bother to look up, murmuring in a subdued tone, "Give me a little time alone."



Instead of the expected polite reply, a warm, melodic voice chimed in, "So even I'm not allowed to enter?"



That gentle tone carried both lightness and ease. A jolt ran through his spine, and a dull ache pressed at his temple.



Raising his head abruptly, he found Verena only a short distance away, her head slightly tilted as a playful smile curved her lips.



"How..." His voice caught, the word slipping out in disbelief.



For a moment it felt unreal, and he blinked to steady himself,half afraid she would vanish if he looked away."How did you even know I was here?" he asked at last.



"Well," Verena replied. Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she borrowed the very line he had once used while pursuing her. "Maybe I just felt it. You were thinking of me, weren't you? So of course I came."



Her playful words slipped out as naturally as breathing,yet each one stirred his chest like pebbles tossed into still water, unsettling his guarded calm. His jaw clenched,and an unfamiliar warmth rose to his cheeks.



"I..." The denial hovered on his tongue, yet he knew uttering it would betray the truth that she had indeed occupied his thoughts.



When Isaac didn't seem to remember this playful line he had once used, Verena felt no real disappointment,for she had prepared herself for this ever since his treatment began.



"Fine, I'll stop teasing you." Watching his silence stretch on, Verena's face brightened as she explained,"I actually came to clarify things. The man downstairs is both my assistant and my friend. He arrived back from overseas today, so I collected him from the airport, and we shared a meal together. And besides that..."



With a knowing smile, she looked directly at Isaac and added, "He returned because of the woman he loves.So please don't misread the situation, or else he might refuse to come to our wedding."



When Isaac realized Verena had sought him out just to clear things up, it was as if fireworks burst inside his chest, chasing away every shadow of doubt. The weight pressing on him disappeared, leaving behind a joy so fierce he struggled to contain it. Yet with her sincere gaze on him,he found himself unable to show that happiness openly.



He swallowed hard and turned his head to the side,holding firm as he murmured, "I didn't misunderstand anything."



He couldn't-he simply couldn't let his emotions slip through.



"Is that so?" Verena arched a brow at his awkward and then chose to humor him with a soft reply."That's fine then."



Quiet settled over the room, and once more Isaac let his eyes fall to the floor.



The hush was broken by the sound of light footsteps steadily nearing him.



Before he even raised his head, gleaming silver stilettos came into view against the ornate red carpet beneath him.



Verena halted before him, lowered herself to her knees, and guided his hand to her cheek with gentle intention.



"It doesn't matter if you misunderstood or not," she whispered. "I explained because I want you to understand that no matter how impressive someone else might seem, they mean nothing to me. You are the only one I choose, and I couldn't bear the thought of you being hurt by jealousy or sorrow."



The softness in her voice carried the patience of someone calming a sorrowful child, and at times her cheek brushed lightly against his hand.



To Isaac, it felt as though she was shattering every unspoken boundary, for who could lace such tender sweetness into words spoken with such innocence? A lump rose in his throat, and faint moisture shimmered in his eyes.



Again and again his lips moved without sound, and at last all he managed was a faint nod in silence.


From the look in his eyes, Verena understood that every word she had spoken had settled deep within him.







Upon arriving back at the Willis Villa, Verena slid her car into the garage, and the moment she entered the living room, Kaia's voice rang out to meet her.


"I'm honestly amazed. Who would've thought my dear sister kept such surprising talents tucked away?"Kaia remarked, letting every word drip with sarcasm.



Experience told Verena that whenever Kaia came looking for her, trouble usually followed. Wanting no part of it today, she moved to pass by, but Kaia stretched out her arm to block the way.



Verena turned toward Kaia,her brow pulling tight



Losing wasn't something Kaia ever liked to own up to,least of all when Verena was watching



Meeting Verena's steady stare, Kaia responded with a frown of her own.



Kaia had no idea that her baby-faced looks didn't carry the weight that Verena's calm,sculpted features did, and the fierce look she tried to pull off ended up looking more silly than serious.
###Chapter 42 Have You Been Following Me
Verena fixed Kaia with a cool gaze, her tone indifferent. "If you've something to say, say it plainly.I've no patience to waste time circling words with you."



Kaia folded her arms, her eyes cutting sideways like a blade, a sneer curling her lips. "No patience for me,yet you suddenly find boundless energy for private talks with another man?"



"What exactly are you suggesting?" Verena's tone stayed steady, as if untouched by Kaia's provocation.


Kaia could not stomach Verena's aloofness-always so distant, always carrying herself as if the world could not touch her.



With a sharp motion, she pulled out her phone and thrust it forward, showing Verena a photo sent by a friend who had spotted her at a restaurant.



"Verena, you play your cards well. One hand engaged to lsaac, and the other hand holding secret meetings with a man-smiling, chatting, looking far too comfortable."



Her smugness lit her face like a cruel lantern. "Tell me,

 if lsaac saw this photo, would he still cherish the thought of marrying a woman so false-hearted? With his position, do you think he'd stomach betrayal?"



Verena took the phone and glanced at the photo-her and Gavin, seated together. The angle was cunning, capturing them as if they were a young couple on a tender date, laughter shared without restraint.



She had already clarified things with Isaac. What gnawed at her was how Kaia had come to possess such a photo.



"Have you been following me?"



At the frost in Verena's gaze, Kaia shivered despite herself.


Snatching her phone back, she crossed her arms, and then stepped closer, her face twisted with defiance.


"So what if I did? If your conscience is clear,why tremble? This time, my friend simply happened upon you whispering sweet nothings with another man. But I'd wager you've been roaming about with plenty of them, haven't you? Hah-just as Mom says, that old hag from your backwater roots truly ruined you-"



Her words cracked off mid-sentence, for a sharp slap resounded, striking her cheek and leaving a vivid red mark. Kaia's eyes flew wide in disbelief.



"You... you actually dared to hit me?" Her chest heaved, fury blazing. "That old hag-"



Another slap split her lip before she could finish.



Clutching her burning cheek, Kaia staggered, utterly provoked. "That old hag, that old hag-"


Two more slaps rang out, each echoing through the living room like thunderclaps.


The force nearly toppled her, but before she fell, a hand seized her collar.



Verena dragged her close, brow furrowed, eyes sharp as steel. "Kaia Willis, hate me all you want-I don't care."



Her voice dropped, colder still. "But hear me well: my grandmother is not yours to scorn. Speak one more word against her, and each time I'll strike without hesitation."



With that, Verena shoved Kaia hard, sending her sprawling to the floor. "Don't test me again."


Even after, there was no relief in her chest. She turned from Kaia and climbed the stairs in haste.



Shawna had carried her worries for Kaia and Luka even  to her deathbed. What a bitter fate, to be burdened with such ungrateful kin.



Kaia sat crumpled on the floor, her cheek aflame,tears brimming as she stared up at Verena's retreating figure. Anger boiled within her, shaking her body,yet fear crept beneath it. Verena's cold mask had cracked,revealing something fierce, almost unhinged.



It was not that Kaia had not thought to strike back;but Verena's grip had been iron,leaving no chance.


Her fists clenched tight, hatred blazing. So what if Verena turned mad? In their parents' hearts, Kaia told herself,she would always outweigh her.


That evening, Alec and Laura returned from the company to find their beloved daughter greeting them with a swollen face.



At the sight, Alec's brows drew together.



Laura rushed over, her eyes wet with worry.	 heavens,Kaia,what happened to your face?"



"Mom,it was Verena..." Kaia bit her lip, shoulders trembling as tears streamed. "I spoke a few words when she came home. She claimed I meddled where I shouldn't, and then struck me again and again before shoving me to the floor."



Her sobs were pitiful, her voice woven with grievance "Verena?" Alec frowned,doubtful.


In his eyes, Verena had always been the quiet one never the sort to throw her weight about.


Seeing the hesitation, Kaia pressed on, her voice pleading. "Dad, it was truly her. Go upstairs and ask her yourself if you doubt me."



Tonight, she was determined-Verena would pay. Her parents had always cradled her in affection. Surely,they would not let her be wronged in silence.


But Kaia misjudged. Alec, seasoned by years of business, had his eyes on the larger game. Even if Verena had struck Kaia, she was about to enter the Bennett family through marriage. Trouble now would be poison in the well.


His voice came low, reluctant. "Verena's wedding with Isaac is at hand. Let's leave this matter for another time."



"So what if she marries Isaac?" Laura cut in, her face drawn with disdain. "I care nothing for the Bennett family's backing! Today, she dared raise her hand against Kaia in this very house, spitting on us all. Such insolence cannot go unanswered!"



Her fury boiled over; thoughts of currying favor with the Bennetts vanished like mist. All she wished was to storm upstairs and remind Verena who truly ruled this household. Verena's conduct had long been a thorn in her side, fueling a steady undercurrent of dissatisfaction.



Laura made to ascend, but Alec caught her arm.



Though his heart ached for Kaia, his mind weighed interests more heavily. He had not thrived in business by letting anger steer the ship.



He exhaled deeply. "Remember our alliance with the Bennett family through marriage. Verena's wedding is too near. Stirring conflict now would only sow weeds in our own path. The fewer storms,the better."



"Hmph, the Bennett family?" Laura sneered, voice dripping scorn. "Yes, we need their support, but don't fool yourself-Danica despises us. Were it not for Isaac's crippled legs, our family would never have had this chance. Do you think we'd be chosen otherwise?"



Her gaze shifted to Kaia, softening with pride. "With Kaia,we are hardly grasping at straws. She has already won the favor of the Lyons family-she healed Barrie Lyons' leg with her herbs and supplements. Their family may not rival the Bennetts outright, but they are close. To the Bennetts, we are beggars; to the Lyons family, Kaia is a benefactor. Now, tell me,which is the wiser path?"
 ###Chapter 43 Severing Ties
Laura gently clasped Kaia's hand. With a soft determination in her voice, she said, "Kaia, you don't need to be afraid. I'll make sure your pain means something."


Alec blinked in shock. "What did I just hear? Are you seriously talking about Barrie Lyons from Shoildon?"


Tilting her chin with quiet pride, Laura replied, "Who else besides the influential Lyons family could deserve Kaia's talent?"



Alec dropped his gaze to the floor and sank into thought.



Rumors from countless business events drifted back to him. Everyone knew Barrie's leg injury had left him nearly crippled.



Living with such relentless agony in old age was nothing short of tragic.



Yet somehow,Kaia had managed to restore him?



The Lyons family's reputation for paying back favors was legendary.


If Barrie's suffering had finally ended because of Kaia  the Willis family would stand to gain more than anyone could imagine.


That realization settled over Alec, and he finally loosened his grip on Laura's arm.



Just as Laura started toward the staircase, Alec called out, "Verena deserves to be punished, yes. But don't go overboard. The Bennett family may not hold the same weight for us later on, but it would be foolish to turn them into enemies."



Only a couple of dismissive grunts left Laura in response.



Dragging Kaia with her, she marched straight up to the third floor. Outside Verena's room, she pounded hard against the door.



"Verena! Come out here right now!"


Inside, Verena froze at the sound. She already knew Laura was coming to punish her for Kaia's sake.



The door swung open, and Laura's hand immediately slashed through the air in an attempt to strike.



Verena's reflexes took over. She caught Laura's arm and shoved it aside.



Unfazed,Laura swung again with her other hand, only to have Verena block the attack a second time. Still unwilling to give in, Laura lifted her arm for another blow. But this time, Verena seized her wrist,twisted sharply, and forced her into a lock that stopped her cold.


Laura's voice broke into a pained cry. "Let go of me!l said let go right now!"


At last, Verena loosened her hold and fixed her mother with a blank stare. "Tell me, what is it you really want?"



Kaia rushed to Laura's side and clutched her hand, her eyes darting to the red welt forming on her wrist.


"Mom, are you hurt?" she asked anxiously.


Rage burned hotter in Laura's chest than the sting in her arm, the defiance mattering far more than the mark.



She leveled a hateful glare at Verena. "Shameless girl!It wasn't enough for you to torment your sister; now you dare strike at your own mother?"


Verena's gaze didn't waver. "You came at me swinging without cause. Should I just stand still and take the blows?"



Laura gave a bitter laugh. "Don't forget who l am.l gave you life. If I decide to discipline you, then you 
have no choice but to accept it."



For a mother to speak such words to her child was almost beyond belief.



A faint tremor passed through Verena's lashes, and then her lips curled into a cold smile. "If that's how it is, stop calling me your daughter. I never once saw you as a mother anyway."



The defiance cut Laura like a blade.



She drew in a deep breath and gave a sharp nod. "So be it. If you refuse to recognize me, then I'll cast you off myself. From this moment on, you are no longer my daughter. Pack your things and get out of this house!"



Her hand thrust toward the stairs, her eyes glinting with icy disdain, untouched by grief or regret.



Get out? Verena let out a short, mocking laugh.


This house had never carried the warmth of a home for her anyway.



She strode past them without hesitation and spoke over her shoulder. "If we're breaking ties, let's make it absolute.From today, you are not my mother, and | am not your daughter. Remember this, Mrs. Willis-whatever I achieve in the future belongs to me alone.The Willis family has no claim on it." What Laura had truly wanted was a daughter who bowed her head.



There was something about the way Verena held herself that turned Laura's stomach.



As she listened to her speak, Laura couldn't hear anything but pride swelling in a voice that hadn't earned it.



She couldn't believe that Verena dared to talk about achievement in the future and warn them not to claim on it. If Verena hadn't been born as her daughter, she wouldn't be standing there at all, wrapped in privilege that was never really hers to claim.



In Laura's eyes, it was because of her upcoming wedding with Isaac that Verena dared to talk like that.



Pushed past the edge of reason, Laura retorted, "The Bennett family wants a daughter from the Willis family.You're not mine, so stop dreaming about marrying into that family."



Beside Laura, Kaia stood stunned. She hadn't believed Laura would actually cut Verena off at such a decisive moment.



A quiet smile tugged at Kaia's lips nonetheless,for this was exactly the outcome she had long desired. Now, Verena was no longer a rival for affection,no longer a daughter of the Willis family, and most importantly, no longer a candidate to marry lsaac.



Her wish was fulfilled.



The sound of Laura's frigid words trailed after Verena,halting her steps and drawing a dry laugh from her throat.



Laura seemed convinced that stripping her of status and denying her a marriage into a wealthy clan was the sharpest blow she could deal.



Yet Laura had never truly understood her daughter's heart.



Verena turned with a cold expression. "All right then.But don't fool yourself into thinking the Bennett family are yours to manipulate. When the consequences come, you won't be able to shoulder them. I'll be watching when it happens."



Neither Laura's glare nor Kaia's shocked face slowed her. She walked out firmly, without glancing back.



Kaia's mouth fell open. She had expected begging,perhaps desperate pleas for forgiveness, not this calm rejection.



In Shoildon, countless women longed to marry into the Bennett family, yet few had the chance.



Verena might've had a pleasant face, but without influence or real ability, women like her had no place standing beside a family as prominent as the Bennett family.



Becoming Isaac's bride as the daughter of the Willis family was the best thing that had ever happened to her.



And yet, Verena just let it go-no sorrow, no hesitation,nothing at all?



Neither Kaia nor Laura could stomach the way Verena carried herself, as though she were somehow above them both.



Confusion flickered across Kaia's face, while Laura's eyes remained fixed in disbelief at the spot where Verena had disappeared.



In her mind, Verena should have been nervous,maybe even desperate, instead of leaving with such ease and composure.



That very expectation had driven Laura to threaten her.



Yet the reply she had received left Laura feeling, if only for an instant, like the tables had turned and she was the one standing on uncertain ground. By the look on Laura's face, Kaia understood her mother hadn't truly meant to sever ties; the threat had been meant to intimidate, not finalize.



Verena, however, held too much pride, and unless Laura reached out to mend things, there was no chance she would ever agree to a marriage with the Bennett family.



Afraid Laura might later regret her words and try to smooth things over, Kaia chimed in quickly, "Mom,don't take her too seriously. She's probably just lashing out in anger. There's no way she would actually throw away the chance to marry into the Bennett family."



The thought gave Laura pause, but soon she nodded.After all, who would willingly give up such a good marriage?



A sharp snort escaped her. "That girl is stubborn to the bone. Let's see how long she pretends to stand firm."



To Laura, Verena's defiance was nothing more than a performance she expected to collapse in time.

###Chapter 44 She'll Crawl Back Before Long
As Verena walked down the staircase and crossed the living room, Alec stopped her with a call of her name."Verena!"



When she turned back, her face showed no expression as she stood waiting for his words.



Verena understood that Laura had only been able to come upstairs and confront her because Alec had allowed it.



If that had not been the case, he would not have stayed seated earlier while the commotion went on upstairs.



The realization left her with a bitter sense of irony.


For a time, she had believed Alec might be the only one in the family who still showed her some regard,even if it was out of his sense of guilt.


Feeling guilty,she believed,would have meant that he cared in some small way.


Now she saw that her thoughts had only been wishful assumptions. Alec rose from his seat and stepped closer, noticing that while her face stayed calm, her eyes carried both sadness and disappointment.



The expression struck him with a force he hadn't expected.



With sudden panic creeping into his chest, Alec asked in haste, "Verena, it's already late. Where are you planning to go?"



The tenderness in his tone gave the impression of a father speaking out of deepconcern for his child.



For a fleeting moment,Verena nearly allowed herself to believe it.



The false calm in Alec's manner only deepened the irony pressing against her.


With steady eyes fixed on him, Verena spoke with deliberate clarity. "Alec Willis, beginning today,you and Laura Willis are no longer my parents. Wherever l choose to go will never concern either of you."


Her clear gaze carried a cold sharpness, though a faint crease appeared between her brows.



Alec paid no attention to the change in her expression,for the weight of her words had already shaken him. For Verena to cut ties so firmly, Alec could only assume that Laura had spoken far too harshly upstairs.



No matter if Verena's actions came from sudden defiance or a real attempt to escape, Alec knew he could not afford a single misstep during the critical Bennett family alliance.



"Did your mother speak too cruelly to you?"



"So you knew she went upstairs to stir up trouble for me? I was under the impression you didn't."



With a sharp glance, Verena added, "The two of you as parents make me sick. If I had any choice in the matter, I would have never wanted to belong to this family."



Her words left Alec shaken to his very core, his body rooted in stunned silence as he watched Verena walking out of the lavish villa.


Coming to his senses, he rushed forward to the door and called out after her, "Verena, wait..."



From the staircase came a voice asking, "Why are you running after her?"



When Alec turned, he saw Laura and Kaia making their way down the steps. With arms folded and anger etched on her face, Laura walked toward him.



"Let her leave. Don't stop her," Laura said coldly toward the door. "I want to see just how far she'll manage without us behind her."



Alec felt frustration build at Laura's cold indifference.



Though he agreed Verena's stubbornness needed discipline, he never intended for Laura to drive away the Bennett family's future daughter-in-law without weighing the consequences.



With his face darkened, Alec asked Laura sharply, "I told you only to discipline her lightly. What did you say to Verena that pushed her to leave?"



Noticing Alec leaning toward Verena's side, Laura turned her anger onto him.



"She told me outright that she doesn't recognize me as her mother, so why blame me for her walking away?"



Laura's frown deepened, and her voice sharpened as she snapped, "Your eldest daughter is something else,Alec. She bullies Kaia and even had the audacity to strike me, her own mother. Truly, you must be proud of the child you brought up."


Catching Alec's inclination to defend Verena, Kaia hurried to nod in support. "It's true, Dad. Verena shows no respect for Mom. All Mom did upstairs was say a few words to correct her, and Verena twisted her hand right away. Look for yourself."



Kaia lifted Laura's wrist toward Alec, presenting it like a silent accusation.



When his eyes dropped, a vivid red mark stood out against Laura's wrist.


The faint crease on his brow gave Kaia her chance,and she sniffled theatrically before crying out,"It's bad enough that Verena bullies me, but to treat Mom this way is unforgivable!"



Laura's anger eased at her younger daughter's show of loyalty, and she stroked Kaia's hair with approval."You truly do think of me, Kaia."



Alec's eyes lingered on the mark, and the silence stretched heavy between them.



It had never crossed his mind that Verena would defy her parents so openly.


Laura, encouraged by Alec's silence, added, "I told her clearly that if she denies me as her mother, then I'll deny her as my daughter. From now on she has no ties to the Willis family, and she can forget about marrying into the Bennett family." Alec's temper flared the moment Laura brushed things off with her stubborn attitude.



Pointing at her in frustration, he could barely force out a word. "You... you..."


His chest rose and fell heavily as he glared at her."Haven't I warned you over and over? We can't afford any trouble with Verena and the Bennett family.You went and scolded her. What happens if she really refuses the marriage arrangement? How do we explain that to the Bennett family?"



The alliance promised great rewards, but a single misstep at this stage would give the Bennett family every reason to turn against them.


Kaia shrank back quickly, startled by the sudden fury in her father's tone. She had never witnessed him this enraged.



Laura flinched at first, her shoulders drawing in, but she quickly lifted her head high and let out a mocking laugh. "Do you honestly believe she has that kind of strength? She followed us from Trisas to Shoildon because she wanted to rise above he place in life, to shed her insignificance and turn herself into a woman of society. Without the Willis family behind her, she is nothing, and she can forget about ever marrying into wealth. Don't trouble yourself. This is only her rash temper speaking, and she will crawl back before long After what she did to Kaia and me, do I not have every right to vent my anger?"


Alec considered what she said, and it began to sound convincing.



To the Bennett family, Verena's standing in society mattered far more than who she really was.


If marrying into wealth was truly her goal, she would never dare to run away and cut ties.


Accepting that logic, Alec let Verena go without chasing her.


In the end, he believed it was only a matter of time before she came back.







Instead of driving away, Verena left the Willis Villa on foot because the car sitting in the garage had been a gift from Alec.



She refused to keep anything that tied her to the Willis family.


The villa stood in a secluded part of town, and at that hour, there wasn't a single car she could hail.


After a brief pause to think, Verena pulled out her phone and called Gavin. Three rings passed before the line clicked.


"Dr. WNillis, what do you need?" Gavin's voice came steady through the receiver.


Her tone dropped to something faint and weary."D you have time right now?"


Her weary tone pressed on him so heavily that Gavin answered at once, "Yes, I do."


She let out a quiet hum before asking, "Can you come get me and take me to a hotel?"



He didn't hesitate. "Of course. Just text me the address, and I'll head over."



A small smile broke across her face as she thanked him.Once the call ended, she shared her location.
###Chapter 45 | Miss You
While she lingered at the roadside, waiting for Gavin,Verena felt a dampness on her cheek.


She reached up to touch her face, only to feel water sliding down the back of her neck.


What began as a light mist quickly swelled into fat drops that smacked the ground in sharp bursts.


With nothing but open space around her, there was no protection from the storm.


The scene struck her as almost laughable, like a plot pulled straight from a soap opera.


Looking up at the dark sky, she let out a small laugh at her own thoughts and murmured, "I'm really not shattered over this. Ever since Kaia came into the world, I've known I wasn't the one who mattered most,so I've been bracing for moments like this. Don't try to twist it into something dramatic, understood? The rain's coming down so hard my clothes are already drenched."



A set of headlights finally cut through the downpour,and Gavin's car rolled to a stop. He stepped out holding an umbrella and made his way toward her.



His face showed regret the instant he saw how soaked she was. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting."



She smiled faintly and gave her head a quick shake."No. You got here just when I needed you."



Once she climbed into the car, Gavin circled around to the driver's side.



With a half-hearted smile, she said quietly, "I'm afraid I'm about to ruin your seat."



Noticing how forced her expression seemed, Gavin chose his words with care. "You look... sad.Something's bothering you, isn't it?"



Her lips curved at his careful tone, and she answered with a shake of her head, "It's not worth worrying about. I saw it coming, and they aren't worth my tears."


The steady way she spoke made Gavin think that whatever loneliness he thought he had sensed earlier was only his imagination.



He could sense deep down that the situation carried more weight than it appeared.


Rather than press her, he shifted the topic and asked, "Did you book a hotel room?"


Verena's head moved in a slow shake. "Take me to the one you're staying at."


Gavin's lips pressed together in a small nod. "Okay."


Turning the wheel, he guided the car forward, and the tires cut through the rain-soaked night.



The storm eased off quickly, and by the time they arrived at the hotel, the rain had stopped.



At the front desk, Gavin secured a suite, and then placed the key in Verena's hand as he walked her to the door.



After thinking for a moment, he suggested, "How about I buy you a drink?"


With her chest feeling tight, Verena gave him a soft smile. "Alright."



He called the front desk and placed the order for drinks,and soon they were delivered.


Even though the idea had been his, Verena was the one who drank far more than he did.



From the moment they settled in, she kept quiet,lifting glass after glass without a word. Before long, she abandoned the glass entirely and drank straight from the bottle.



As Gavin watched her drown herself so recklessly, he wanted to intervene but held back.



Once the final bottle ran empty, he sprang up and pulled it from her grasp. "That's enough. Go shower and get some rest."



He then called room service to clear away the bottles and glasses before making his way out.



The soft click of the door closing left the room in silence.



On the floor, Verena leaned against the sofa with her cheeks burning red.



There was no mistaking it-she was drunk.



Her mind,before the alcohol dulled it, kept circling back to Luka's hateful stare, Kaia's endless schemes both open and hidden, Laura's cutting voice, and Alec's shallow imitation of a father's love.



Why did the people who should have been her greatest support care the least?


She yearned, just like anyone else, for the tenderness of parents and the steady comfort of family.

 Sadly, the only person who had given her true love had already passed away.



And the one who once held her close had since let her fade from memory.



Once the liquor began to cloud her head,Shawna and that man became the only figures she could think of.



Isaac...


Out of nowhere, the ache of missing lsaac pressed heavily on her.



She felt an urgent need to see him right away.



Acting decisively and quickly had always been her way,and even drunk, she clung to that instinct.



Her fingers stumbled across the table until they reached her phone, where she scrolled to lsaac's name and pressed to call.


The line rang again and again with no answer, but she stayed on the call, unwilling to give up.


Over at the Bennett Group offices, the building had emptied out, except for the light still glowing in the CEO's office.



At his desk,Isaac continued working, his hands flying over the keyboard as he dealt with company affairs. Just outside, his assistant waited at the doorway,fully aware that lsaac often lost all sense of time when buried in work.



Isaac didn't like being interrupted when he was working, and the assistant was well aware of that. Still,the phone kept ringing without a break, and eventually,the assistant couldn't ignore it any longer.



He paused at the entrance, eyes fixed on the name flashing across the phone screen, fingers curling tight at his side. After a moment's silence, he knocked twice and stepped inside.



Isaac didn't look up right away. When he did, his expression was hard, his eyes sharp. "What is it?" he asked.



The assistant stepped forward holding the phone. "Mr.Bennett, Miss Verena Willis has been calling repeatedly,so..."



As soon as the name "Miss Verena Willis" reached his ears, Isaac stretched out his hand to take the phone."Why didn't you hand it over sooner?"



There was a brief pause before the assistant answered,"You once told me you dislike interruptions while you're working."


That was true; Isaac had made that clear before. Without another word, he accepted the call from Verena.



Before he could speak, a gentle female voice drifted through. "Isaac, I miss you."


Soft and slightly nasal, the voice clung to him like a kitten in need of affection. The sound stopped him cold, and color rose along his cheeks.



A slight tremor passed through his hand, and for a second the phone nearly slipped before he caught it again.



With the office wrapped in silence, the assistant at his desk heard Verena's voice clearly.



The words startled him, for the Verena he recalled had always carried hersef with cool elegance.



That she could sound so tender in private was something he had never imagined.



Seeing his assistant's distracted expression, Isaac pressed his lips into a line, covered the receiver, and said,"Leave now."



Realizing he had overstepped, the assistant hurried out and closed the door behind him.



When the door clicked shut, Isaac uncovered the receiver again.



Verena's faint murmur continued, repeating the same phrase over and over.



For a moment, Isaac's thoughts stalled; this was not the woman he was used to.



Normally,she would never act in such a way.



Quietly,he asked, "Verena, what's happening with you?"


Her reply came with a girlish giggle. "Isaac, I really miss you... I'm sitting alone in a hotel room; will you come and be with me?"



Her words dragged slightly, slurred with drink, yet laced with playful sweetness.



A tight swallow moved through Isaac's throat twice.



Never before had he witnessed her with so little guard around her.



Oddly enough, the sensation of being needed by her brought a quiet sense of satisfaction.



Lowering his eyes, Isaac's lashes quivered faintly as he replied,"Fine."



Once the call ended, he gave orders to his assistant to have a car made ready Meanwhile, Verena forwarded the hotel's address and,for the first timne that evening, thought to freshen herself up.


She slipped out of the damp clothes clinging to her body and stepped beneath the shower spray.


When she finished drying off, she pulled on the bathrobe provided by the hotel.


Her head swam with dizziness, the alcohol heavy in her body, though her mind stayed sober.


And like many who drank too much, a reckless boldness stirred within her.



Verena had barely settled onto the bed when the sound of the doorbell reached her ears.

###Chapter 46 Sleep Beside Me Tonight
Isaac reached the floor where Verena was staying,instructing his assistant to remain downstairs while he rolled toward the door whose number she had sent him.



The moment he pressed the doorbell, it swung open from within.


The first thing that caught his eyes was a pair of long,slender legs.


Isaac froze, and then slowly lifted his gaze to find Verena leaning lazily against the doorframe, wrapped in a bathrobe.



Her cheeks were tinted with a faint flush,softening her usually cool demeanor with an almost dangerous allure.



The air was heavy with the scent of alcohol.


In that instant, Isaac realized things might not be as romantic as he had pictured in his mind.


His brows drew together, his voice carrying concern he himself barely noticed. "Verena, what happened to you?" Worry shone clearly in his eyes, but she only smiled lightly. "Come in first, and I'll tell you."



Her tone was gentle, her voice almost syrupy.



Isaac didn't care about keeping any distance; it felt as though he were under her spell as he maneuvered his wheelchair into the room.



With a soft click, VVerena shut the door, and then turned and promptly seated herself on Isaac's lap.



Startled, Isaac stiffened, instinctively trying to push her to her feet.



Yet she looped her arms around his neck, pressing a finger against his lips. "Shh. Don't ask about that now,alright?"



Her slightly hazy eyes melted away the last of his resolve.


In a quiet voice, he asked, "Then... what do you want to talk about?"



"What should we talk about..." She seemed to truly think it over, her gaze roaming across his face before it lingered on his thin lips.



Her mouth curved into a sly smile as her finger trailed from his lips down to his chin, tipping it up."How about flirting with you?"



Her playful tone, sweet and teasing, brushed against his ears as her warm breath fanned his cheek.



Isaac was certain she was drunk.



Verena squinted at him, noticing the flush creeping over his ears.



As though she had uncovered some delightful secret,she teased softly, "Do you want to know how I'll flirt with you?"



Before lsaac could muster an answer, she leaned closer, whispering, "Your ears are red."



Then,with parted lips, she captured his heated earlobe,her damp tongue gliding across it.


Isaac's arm muscles twitched uncontrollably,his hands clutching the wheelchair's armrests in a desperate bid for restraint.



The sensation of her moist lips, the warmth of her breath, and the delicate fragrance clinging to her freshly bathed skin collided all at once against his nerves.



He tipped his head back, taking a deep breath as though wrestling with the tide rising within him. But Verena wasn't satisfied. Once upon a time,a single kiss from her would have sent him reeling with joy.


With mischief in her eyes, she cupped his face, turned it toward her, and brushed her lips against his.


A feather's touch.



Isaac's heart pounded in disarray, his eyes darkening with emotion. "Verena,you're drunk."



She pressed herself tightly against his chest. If she were sober, she might have heard the thunderous chaos of his heartbeat.



"Really, Isaac?" Verena murmured, her head sinking onto his shoulder. "I've teased you so much, yet you won't react. My heart might just shatter."



Her voice was husky, threaded with tenderness,carrying his name like a plea.



"Verena, could you please get up?" he asked,shifting uncomfortably.



Her hair brushed against his Adam's apple, sending an involuntary shiver through him.



"Alright," she agreed softly.



Isaac blinked in surprise, not expecting her to comply so easily. When he looked at her, she tilted her head back, smiling faintly. "Let's go to bed together. I'll help you in,and youI can sleep beside me tonight, alright?"


Sleep beside her...


With her drunken smile and dreamy eyes locked on his,Isaac's brows furrowed. He placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and reminded her, "Do you even know what you're saying? I am not like other men."



It was as much a reminder to her as it was to himself.



His gaze clung to her, shadowed by complex emotions and a touch of melancholy.


She was so perfect, yet he felt like a hollow shell. His legs were still unhealed, his body betrayed by dysfunction, and the road to recovery was uncertain.How could he dare hope?



Sensing the sorrow flickering in his eyes, Verena pressed her finger gently over his lips. "Isaac, I won't allow you to speak of yourself that way, nor will I let you belittle my abilities."



She leaned her forehead against his, smiling with quiet certainty. "I promised to heal you-every part of your body."



Her words carried a sharper meaning, sinking deeper.


Isaac stared at her radiant smile, and, as always, herpresence lit up the shadows clouding him. His gaze lingered; their closeness left him suddenly aware that her white bathrobe had slipped from her shoulders baring smooth, delicate skin.



The sight was laid bare before him.



He quickly turned his face aside, leaning back as if to retreat-only tocollide with the crescent-moon curve of her eyes. She smiled impishly, like a sprite caught mid-trick.



Verena continued to hold his gaze, unwavering.



The silence grew thick, the air pulsing with sparks of unspoken tension.



Then,lowering her head, she twined her arms tightly around his neck and pressed her lips to his. This time it was no fleeting brush. She nibbled, sucked, and kissed with heated persistence. It was exactly the way Isaac used to love.



Her sudden fervor left Isaac reeling, fearing he might be swept away. Yet the sweetness on his tongue filled his mind with joy so pure it felt like a rare gift-hers alone.



All reason slipped away



He was no longer passive. One hand cradled her head the other locked around her slender waist, tightening as he deepened the kiss.



Verena was taken aback, pulling back to speak, only for him to chase her lips instantly.



"Mmm-"



This was no gentle peck; it burned with passion



Though it was hard to keep up, Verena reveled in the familiar heat.



It was as if lsaac had never lost his memory.



The kiss deepened, his lips prying hers apart with a hunger that demanded surrender.



She tilted her head back, responding with equal fire.



In the hushed room, the sound of their kisses rang out.



Bodies pressed close, breaths tangled,as though they wished to fuse into one.




...



The night ebbed away.



When Verena's eyes fluttered open, vision clearing,a dull headache from drink throbbed at her temples.She turned over-and there lay a handsome face beside her.

###Chapter 47 Come Over At Any Time
Verena could hold her liquor well; not a single memory from the night before had slipped away.


In the end, it was she who had helped Isaac onto the bed.



When sleep claimed him, he looked unlike the man he usually was.


The tightness in his brows loosened, his breathing steady as the tide.


At rest,his face carried an air of warmth, as if he were someone easy to approach. But in truth, he never was.



Verena studied his features, her eyes gentle and clear as water.



She leaned her chin on her palm, her fingers slowly tracing the arch of his brow, gliding down to his high nose bridge, finally coming to rest on his firm,straight lips.


Isaac stirred awake, his lashes lifting to the sight of Verena's luminous face-bare of makeup, yet strikingly beautiful. Her head was slightly lowered, her fingertip brushing against his lips, as though... she was about to lean in and kiss him.



A softness appeared in Isaac's gaze. He tilted his head forward,wishing to close the distance between them.



But Verena suddenly whispered, "Isaac, I can't marry you."



His body stilled. His lashes quivered as if caught in a storm.



He parted his lips to speak, but no sound emerged.The silence pressed on his chest like a boulder,making it hard to breathe.



For the first time, lsaac tasted what it meant to be struck by a cruel revelation.



Was it because of his condition?



Because he was not like other men?



Because he had failed to give her what she wanted last night?



Catching the flicker of anguish in his eyes, Verena knew immediately he had misunderstood.


She hurried to explain, "Yesterday, I quarreled with my mother." At her words, the storm in Isaac's expression calmed a little. "She was partial to my sister and lashed out at me without reason. I fought back. Then she furiously declared I was no longer her daughter and cast me out of the Willis family. Your family wants the daughter of the Willis family. But I'm not that anymore,so I can't marry you as such."



Isaac's brows knitted tightly as he asked, voice tinged with urgency, "Were you hurt?"



Verena smiled faintly and shook her head. "No. She didn't succeed. I twisted her wrist, though-it turned red."



Even after such treatment from her own mother, she could still summon a smile.



It was a calm too brittle, a facade anyone could see through.



Watching her, Isaac felt a stab of pain and an urge to gather her into his arms.



"Isaac," Verena called softly.



"Yes?" he responded, his tone gentle.



"I never lied to you," she said, her voice quiet yet steady. "Before our first meeting, Laura thought | was a disgrace from the rural backwater. She told me to pretend I was a graduate from Acorith College of Medicine. But I told you all the truth-that I had graduated from Pine Hill University. None of you believed me. On the way back, Laura scolded me,saying | overreached. But the truth is, I really did graduate from Pine Hill University. It's normal if strangers doubt me, but even my parents don't know."



Isaac's mind drifted back to their first meeting.



She had sat at the dining table, declaring her truth with steady eyes. He had believed her then-those eyes left no room for deceit.



Instead of interrupting her, he just stayed silent,knowing she needed to say it all aloud.


Verena gave a bitter laugh. "Isn't it ironic? She's my biological mother, yet she knows nothing about me.Kaia, the daughter she adores, got into Acorith College of Medicine, and Laura treasures her like gold.But my studies? She never cared. Once, when I was a child, I caught a high fever and missed two of the exams, and my results slipped. From then on, they branded me as hopeless. They never asked again.They thought I didn't even take the college entrance exam. But the truth is, I had already been admitted early to Pine Hill University. They never knew-never bothered to know. My likes, my schooling, even whom I care for-they remain blind to it all. Yet Kaia's every move is known. As for Luka, they treat him as their pride and heir. Only me... I've always been invisible."


Her words struck lsaac like a knife, his heart aching with every syllable.



"My grandmother Shawna raised me. She alone cared.But she has passed on." Tears welled in Verena's eyes at the memory.



"Later, they brought me from the countryside to Shoildon, only for the sake of the marriage alliance.Kaia despises me most, but her hostility never mattered to me. What mattered was when she insulted Shawna last night. I couldn't stand it-I hit her.Hard enough to swell her face and bloody her mouth.I don't regret it. After that, Laura and I quarreled. She cut me off. Now, I'm no longer a daughter of the Willis family. So, Isaac, I can't marry you."


Without a word, Isaac drew her into his arms, holding her tightly.



In a low, steady voice, he vowed, "Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Only I have the right to decide who my wife will be."


Time passed, and Isaac eventually called his assistant to drive him to the company.


Verena helped him into the wheelchair, guiding him toward the bathroom to freshen up. Soon after, breakfast was delivered by the hotel staff.



They sat opposite each other. Verena reached across for the strawberry jam on Isaac's plate. "You don't like strawberries. Let me take this."



She spread peanut butter on his toast and handed it to him.



Isaac raised a brow in surprise. Not even his mother knew he disliked strawberries.



"How did you know?" he asked.



Verena lifted her gaze, her voice soft yet serious. "I know everything about you."



There was no playfulness in her tone, only sincerity.


Isaac was taken aback, at a loss for words.



Her calm acceptance of his silence showed she wasn't disheartened.



Deep down, she believed he would one day remember her.


Midway through breakfast, lsaac asked, "Are you planning to stay here?"



"Yes," Verena replied with a nod. A sudden thought crossed her mind, and her lips curved playfully. "If you're free, you can come over at any time."



Better to marry lsaac as the woman he loved than as the Willis daughter bound by duty


"Ahem... ahem..." Isaac choked on his water. Verena quickly handed him a napkin.



He thanked her, lifting his gaze to meet hers.Her eyes shimmered with unspoken meaning.



It was a silent reminder of last night.



Isaac's mind replayed the chaos of those moments.His ears reddened, and a flush crept down his neck.



The air thickened with awkwardness.



To be precise, it was Isaac who felt flustered.



Meanwhile, Verena's gaze lingered on him-steady,intent, and far from innocent.

###Chapter 48 Deeply Touched
Isaac's phone suddenly rang, breaking the awkward tension,and he picked it up at once.



From the receiver came the respectful tone of his assistant, Jacob Howard. "Mr. Bennett, I'm already outside the hotel."


Isaac's reply was calm and measured. "Alright. I'll be down shortly."



After hanging up, he turned toward Verena. "I'm heading to work now."


Verena's lips curved in a gentle smile. "Of course.Have a great day."


Isaac rolled his wheelchair toward the door, yet just as he was about to leave, Verena's soft voice stopped him. "Hold on a moment."



He paused and turned, catching sight of Verena walking over. She lowered herself to crouch in front of him.



He was about to ask what was wrong when she carefully lifted his tie and dabbed at it with a paper napkin.



Only then did he notice the corner of his navy tie had been touched by water.


His gaze fell on her intent expression, and his dark eyes brimmed with a feeling he could neither name nor deny.



When it came to him, she always caught the smallest of details, things even he overlooked.


"All set." Verena's smile bloomed, pulling Isaac back from his thoughts as his eyes rested on her face.



As she straightened his slightly rumpled tie, her voice softened like a spring breeze. "No matter how busy work gets, promise me you'll take care of yourself.Rest when you're tired."



Her eyes were clear as glass, filled with a warmth that seemed to seep into his chest.


For a fleeting instant, the scene resembled that of a wife sending her husband off to work.



Isaac's eyelashes quivered; his heartbeat leapt against his ribs, quick and unsteady.



In that moment, he had to admit one truth: he was deeply touched. "Mr. Bennett, there's a document for you to review."


By the time lsaac gatheed his wandering thoughts, he was already seated in the car.


Yet the storm in his chest had not calmed.



He glanced at the file Jacob held out from the front seat,but did not take it. Instead, his voice was low and steady. "Head to Willis Villa first."


The driver inclined his head. "Yes, sir." Then the wheel turned,altering their course.


Jacob quietly put the document away. But as he shifted, his eyes caught the sight of Isaac's tie-slightly crumpled, the corner dampened.



He blinked, startled. In the past, Isaac never tolerated even the slightest trace of disarray.



Had something shifted since last night?



Jacob remembered waiting nearly half an hour at the hotel entrance, only for lsaac to call and instruct him to return home.



"Jacob."



Hearing his name, Jacob straightened immediately "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?"



Isaac held his phone, lips pressed thin, his gaze lowered. "Next time Verena calls, no matter how busy I am,bring the phone to me at once."



Jacob froze for a beat, and then nodded quickly."Understood, Mr. Bennett."



For a second, he wondered if his eyes had deceived him.



Was Isaac...smiling?



It was hard to believe, not because he never smiled,but because the warmth in it resembled a man hopelessly in love.


Isaac pulled up Verena's number in his contacts, edited it, and pinned it at the very top.







The car drew to a halt outside Willis Villa.



"Mr. Bennett, would you like me to announce your arrival first?" Jacob asked cautiously.



Isaac's eyes narrowed on the villa gates, his brows knitting. His reply was cold as steel. "Unnecessary."


For the Willis family, empty formalities were not required.



Jacob nodded. "Alright." Then he moved to wheel Isaac forward.



At that hour, Alec had just finished breakfast and was preparing to leave for the office, while Laura,Kaia,and Luka were making their way downstairs.



The first to spot lsaac was Alec, who had just reached the living room entrance.


Surprise flickered in his eyes, but he quickly approached with a smile. "Mr. Bennett, when did you arrive? If you had told us earlier, we would have prepared coffee."



Laura and Kaia exchanged a quick glance.


Then,Laura rushed over.


Kaia,regretting her choice of pajamas, wished she had dressed better.Straightening her hair, she followed.



Only Luka remained at the table, eating his breakfast leisurely, his demeanor of a spoiled heir untouched.



He had heard that Verena left home yesterday, and the news secretly pleased him.



"Good morning, Isaac. Please sit!" Laura's smile was warm as she barked an order at the servant. "Don't just stand there-bring our finest coffee..."



"Don't bother," Isaac interrupted, his tone flat.



Where others plastered on smiles, his face remained unreadable.


Though seated in a wheelchair, the air around him was as commanding as a general on the battlefield.



Sensing something amiss, Alec's smile faltered."Mr.Bennett, is there something you wish to discuss?"



His first thought was Verena.



"There is indeed," Isaac answered. "It concerns my fiancée."



The Willis family exchanged startled glances.


Laura frowned, suspicion rising. "Isaac, what do you mean by that?"



Isaac's gaze lifted to her, a cold gleam flickering beneath his lashes.



Under that look, Laura's eyelids twitched, and a shiver ran down her spine.



"Isaac,why are you staring at me like that?"


His lips curved faintly, yet the smile carried an edge."I'm simply curious how you managed to drive my fiancée out of her own home."



The smile might have been polite, but the weight behind it pressed like a storm.



Kaia's heart froze-he was here for Verena



Alec thought bitterly that he should have foreseen Verena would bring Isaac into this.



He frowned at her lack of restraint.


But what mattered now was calming Isaac.


"Well, the truth is, Verena was just..." Alec was cut off by Laura, who shifted her tone to disdain. "So what if she was driven out? A daughter bold enough to challenge her own mother hardly deserves a place at home. Don't worry, lsaac. I only asked her to stay outside for a while. She'll return before the wedding.She grew up in a small village, accustomed to a carefree life. Without proper discipline, she'll only bring trouble to the Bennett family in the future."



Laura spoke as though even allowing Verena back was a gift.



Alec's face flushed crimson with fury.



Foolish woman!



But with Isaac present, he could not let his anger show. Isaac did not so much as glance at her. His voice was steady, his words striking like thunder. "You may see Verena as unimportant, but to me, she is one of a kind."



The declaration left the Willis family dumbstruck.



They knew all too well who lsaac was, the brightest heir of the Bennett family in Shoildon.



Even with his legs paralyzed, his shares and influence stood unshaken.



No one had imagined he would speak with such sincerity, such unmistakable affection.



At the table, Luka finally set down his glass after gulping milk, stunned.


He had never expected his eldest sister's charm to run so deep-deep enough to rattle Isaac himself.



Verena had truly turned the tide.

###Chapter 49 Her Supposed Infidelity
Laura pressed her lips together. Could it be that Isaac had come here to defend Verena?



The thought left her stunned. After all, Verena and Isaac had only met a handful of times.


Why,then,was Isaac suddenly showing such concern for Verena?



His deliberate appearance today to discuss these matters must have been triggered by something Verena said once she had left home.



The more Laura thought about it, the more her teeth clenched. Her dislike for Verena, already sharp, grew keener still.



Alec's face darkened; his expression carried the weight of regret.


Had he foreseen things spiraling to this extent, he would never have allowed Laura's reckless outburst the night before.



Isaac's visit-whether born of care for Verena or of concern for the Bennett family's reputation-meant one thing: their treatment of Verena had clearly displeased him.



Unlike Laura, who was carried away by resentment,Alec valued the family's standing far above Kaia's grievances.


"Isaac,you've mnisunderstood. We did not drive Verena out. She quarreled with her mother yesterday and stormed off in anger. In truth, we-"


"Mr. Bennett," Kaia broke in before Alec could finish.



Isaac's clear concern for Verena pricked her heart like a thorn.



He was the man she admired, and she could not endure watching Verena-someone she dismissed as insignificant-draw his attention.



Isaac turned his cold eyes upon Kaia.



She stepped forward with a strange smile tugging at her lips. "Mr. Bennett, your feelings for Verena may run deep, but there's something you likely do not know."



Her words stirred the curiosity of Alec, Laura, and even Luka.



Isaac's expression, however, remained as still as stone. Ignoring his frostiness, Kaia unlocked her phone,opened an album, and held the screen out toward him.



Alec and Laura leaned forward at once; even Luka,usually detached, walked over and craned his neck to see.



The image revealed Verena dining opposite a young man.



Their posture and gestures hinted at intimacy.



Verena leaned forward with playful ease, tugging lightly on the man's tie, while he scratched his head in shy embarrassment.


Both were young, striking, and their interaction appeared affectionate.



Anyone seeing the photo would take them for a budding couple.



Kaia caught the shock flickering across the others ' faces, and a cold glint of triumph flashed in her eyes.



With this, she was certain Isaac's regard for Verena would wither.



Luka snorted aloud, his scant tolerance for Verena plunging into outright disdain.



Who would have guessed she was so unruly? Engaged to the heir of the Bennett family, yet still bold enough to stir scandal elsewhere.



To marry into Shoildon's most powerful household should have been a crowning glory, but she still reached out for fresh excitement.



Alec's brows knitted tightly as he stared at the photo,his face a storm of surprise, anger, and shame.



Never had he imagined that his seemingly quiet and well-behaved daughter would carry on like this in private.



If outsiders got wind of it, the entire Willis family name would be dragged through the mud.



Laura,however, remained unnervingly calm, as though she had always known Verena's true colors.



Folding her arms, she inwardly praised Kaia for her move.



Losing the Bennetts as an ally was no small loss, but since Isaac clearly meant to defend Verena, why not turn his anger upon the very woman he sought to protect?



Besides, they still had the Lyons family to rely on.



If Isaac's fiancée was seen to be dallying with another man, his pride was  bound to take a blow. Surely, he would not let Verena off unscathed.



Verena dared to beg lsaac for help. Thinking of this,Laura was eager to see him teach her a brutal lesson.



A sneer tugged at Laura's lips.



Hah! Verena had dared to threaten her with such arrogance the night before.



Now she would reap what she had sown.



How bold would she remain once Isaac discovered her supposed infidelity?



"Mr. Bennett," Kaia said, her tone louder now, "I happened to capture this by chance. As for whether my sister has further entanglements with the man in the photo, I cannot say. But I felt you deserved the truth. You show her such devotion, yet she treats you like this, clearly unworthy of your care. With this evidence in hand, Mr. Bennett, do you still wish to stand by Verena?"



Kaia knew Isaac's physical state meant her hopes of marrying him were futile.



So,she dropped the pretense of being a dutiful sister and spoke without disguise.



Isaac let her finish her gloating speech, and then cast a single, unhurried glance at the phone. The profile in the photo was unmistakably Verena's-smooth forehead, curled lashes, a delicate nose, lips tinted with natural color.



Her skin glowed; her beauty was undeniable.


Even in this moment, Isaac found his gaze lingering upon her, admiring her beauty.



And as for the man sitting across from her...



The scene was not unfamiliar. He recognized Verena's outfit,remembered the playful tug on the tie



It was from the Fortune Garden Restaurant yesterday.He himself had been there.



He recalled how Verena had noticed his unease and quietly gone upstairs to reassure him.



Jealousy was never his way



Instead,memory stirred warmth within him.



Verena had soothed his fragile emotions, spoken with patience, and even kissed him.



While Isaac remained silent, Kaia mistook it for suppressed fury. Her lips curved into a smile of victory,relishing her own malice.



Yes-surely he would punish Verena for such shamelessness.



After all, what man could tolerate betrayal, least of all one as remarkable as lsaac?



Her hope was simple: that lsaac would call off the marriage arrangement in front of Alec, driving Verena into utter disgrace, making her lower her head and beg for mercy from the Willis family.



The thought set Kaia's pulse racing.



She kept her eyes fixed on Isaac, desperate not to miss a flicker of reaction.



Alec, Laura, and Luka also watched him, breath caught in their throats.



The room lay in silence, the air heavy as though frozen.



Just as the Willis family braced for lsaac's judgment upon Verena, a soft chuckle escaped him.



"If I recall correctly, Miss Willis, you are a student at Acorith College of Medicine, are you not?"



His question, utterly unrelated, left the family exchanging puzzled looks.

###Chapter 50 Chilling Threat

Kaia didn't know why Isaac suddenly shifted the topic,but hearing him bring up her elite school filled her with pride. Smiling with confidence, she nodded and said, "That's right, I'm studying at Acorith College of Medicine."



"A student from Acorith College of Medicine has fallen so low? How laughable. You followed your sister around, snapped pictures of her with another man,and showed them to her fiancé-and Miss Willis,even if any of it istrue, shouldn't your first thought as Verena's family be to stand by her?"


Isaac's stare cut straight into her, laced with sarcasm,and the cold sharpness in his eyes made her shiver.


Kaia stiffened where she stood, her face flickering through different emotions. Why was his anger turned on her? Shouldn't he despise Verena for supposed infidelity? Instead, his cold ridicule was aimed at her.


What she faced from him was entirely different from the reaction Kaia had imagined.


Kaia's once-bright smile collapsed into stiffness,and she blinked awkwardly before saying, "Mr. Bennett, I don't understand what you mean. My only intention

was to stop you from being misled."



"Not understanding doesn't matter." His voice was low,and his narrowed eyes glowed with danger. "But remember this. Secretly taking pictures is useless. I know my fiancée better than you do."


He already knew the Willis family dismissed Verena,and his words were chosen to strike them deliberately.


"And even if Verena really is that kind of woman,my feelings don't change," he added. "She's the only one I want. As long as she's willing to remain by my side,I'll overlook her flaws. Do you hear me?"



The declaration stunned everyone in the room,leaving Isaac the only one unfazed.


Alec's eyes widened as he stared at him, disbelief etched into his face. He wondered if the crash six months ago had damaged more than Isaac's legs. If nothing was wrong with lsaac's mind, there was no way he could have stood by Verena's side after seeing the photo and pushed back against eveything being said about the way she lived.



Of course, Alec kept those doubts to himself. What weighed heavier was the regret pressing in on him. If he had realized earlier how deeply lsaac cared for Verena,then regardless of Danica's opinion of their family,he would have done more to shield Verena.


Luka couldn't shake the feeling that lsaac's accident had scrambled something in his head. It was the only way to make sense of the way he spoke-like every word was soaked in blind loyalty.



Grinding her teeth, Laura struggled to make sense of it. What spell had Verena cast that could make lsaac so blind to her faults?



Kaia's complexion drained of color,her gaze burning with envy and bitterness. Isaac showed no fury toward Verena's betrayal. Instead, he twisted Kaia's accusations into shameful overreach. What did Verena possess that earned such unwavering love? She wasn't well educated, she lacked refinement-was her beauty alone enough to blind him?


Unable to hold her composure any longer, Kaia bit down on her lip until it stung. "Mr. Bennett,the photo isn't mine. A friend captured it while eating out, l...l Swear-"



Her voice cracked, breaking into sobs halfway, her shoulders trembling as though the weight of injustice crushed her.



Laura tugged her closer, pulling her under a protective arm.



"Isaac, must you take this so harshly? Kaia already told you she didn't take that picture. And even if she had, she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." Hearing Laura bring up his mother, Isaac easily saw through Laura's scheme.



Danica had always disapproved of the Willis family's behavior, yet she tolerated them for the sake of the marriage alliance. Laura clearly wanted to lean on that authority to sway him.



Isaac's brow tensed as he spoke slowly, each word deliberate. "Verena isn't just the woman I plan to marry. She makes her own choices. I didn't choose her so I could fix her or change her. I chose her because I want her to be happy. And no one-neither you nor my mother-gets to decide who she should be."



The Willis family gaped, stunned silent, unable to believe the level of protection Isaac gave Verena.


When faced with their disbelief, he added without hesitation, "The moment she becomes my wife, I'll sign over half of my shares to her name."



From behind his parents, Luka let out a sharp breath.Half? That was an amount beyond comprehension.



Alec,meanwhile, stood stiff as stone, haunted by one dreadful realization that wouldn't let go-lsaac's devotion to Verena was unwavering, and they had made the mistake of turning against her. Shock swept across Laura's and Kaia's faces, their voices colliding in disbelief. "What did you just say?"



The revelation struck like thunder-Isaac intended to hand over half of his company shares to Verena?



Their stunned expressions meant nothing to him. He already knew they dismissed Verena as unworthy,hoping she would walk away empty-handed. He was determined to prove the opposite-that she would thrive without any help from the Willis family.



He lifted his eyes, his gaze locking onto Laura with a chill that didn't waver. "One more thing," he said, his voice low. "I don't let things go easily. Whatever you put my fiancée through..."



A brief silence stretched before he deliberately shifted."I don't know how much my mother's generosity has bought you, nor do I care. But from me... I'm not sure if you can find any favors. What I can promise is this -I have the power to erase your family overnight."


The look in his eyes was glacial, deep and merciless,like the heart of winter itself. His presence filled the room,pressing down with a weight that felt inborn.


Laura's complexion drained of color, her jaw twitching as though the words cut straight into her.



Cold sweat trickled down her back despite the season's chill, each drop reminding her of the danger before her.



Her courage faltered, and for the first time, she lowered her eyes, a sharp pang of regret twisting inside her.
###Chapter 51 There Is Only One Solution
If Laura had realized earlier what was at stake, she would never have treated Verena in such a reckless manner.



Regret gnawed at her as she thought back-she should have heeded Alec's warning and avoided stirring the pot before Verena married into the Bennett family.



How had she let matters escalate into a quarrel with Verena? And to such a bitter extent?



Alec swallowed hard,desperate to salvage something from the wreckage. "Mr. Bennett, this is all a misunderstanding. You can rely on us-we'll bring Verena back home immediately."



"I don't care what you do." Isaac's cold voice cut like ice. "But mark my words-the one l intend to marry is Verena, not some so-called daughter of the Willis family. Don't dream of wielding your family name to press down on my fiancée."



Alec now fully grasped Verena's weight in Isaac's heart. What else could he possibly say? Without sparing him a glance, Isaac instructed Jacob to take him to Bennett Group.



Jacob gave a brisk nod and wheeled Isaac out of the villa.



That short visit had made one thing blindingly clear: Verena held a place in Isaac's life that no one could shake.



The moment Isaac left, Alec's anger erupted like a dam breaking.



"See the mess you've caused!" he thundered, pointing a trembling finger at Laura, his whole body quaking.



Laura stiffened her spine, casting aside her earlier fear,and retorted with steel in her voice, "What did I do? It was Verena, that stubborn girl, who stormed off on her own. How is this my fault?"


"You're still arguing?" Alec's face burned crimson as he lifted his hand toward her.


"Well,well... are you going to strike me now?" Laura's voice rose with sharp sarcasm. "Wasn't it you who allowed me to go upstairs to discipline Verena? And now,with things gone awry, you wash your hands clean and lay all the blame on me?"


Her words pierced Alec to the quick "I did let you discipline her, but I never told you to throw her out!" His face tightened,breath heavy."And Kaia-you used to be obedient. How did you turn so reckless the moment your sister came to live with us?"



"Dad... how can you say that?" Kaia's eyes widened,stunned by his sudden scolding.



Meeting his cold, furious gaze, Kaia parted her lips,only to feel a surge of anger and resentment twisting inside her.



She had never imagined Isaac would defend Verena with such ferocity, shattering her plans and leaving her humiliated.



Her resentment turned not only against Verena but also against Alec for his fickle nature.



Kaia had long known her father measured worth by profit.



Whoever shone brighter and promised greater gain would receive his favor.



Thus, she had trained herself never to stumble, never to err.



Yet she had not foreseen that lsaac's cutting words would overturn Alec's treatment of her compared to Verena. Hatred flickered in Kaia's eyes, though she clenched her fists to keep it hidden.



She despised Verena. She despised Alec. To the very marrow.



Seeing Alec's wrath turn toward Kaia, Laura rushed to shield her, protesting anxiously, "What does this have to do with Kaia? I won't let you speak to my daughter that way."



But Alec, recalling Isaac's warning, trembled with fury and shouted, "So Kaia is your daughter, and you conveniently forget that Verena is also your daughter?"



"Yes, Verena is my daughter-I haven't forgotten,"Laura snapped. "But so what? Sooner or later,she'll marry into the Bennett family and stand against me.She already disrespects me without shame-why should I treat her with kindness?"



Alec's chest heaved as he saw the cold indifference in her eyes. She still hadn't grasped the gravity of the matter.



His voice cracked with rage. "If you know she's marrying into the Bennett family, can't you see how easily they could crush us without even lifting a finger?Have you lived in comfort so long that you've forgotten the hardships we clawed through to reach this point? Teaching Verena a lesson is one thing,but you dared to drive her from our home!" He sucked in a breath and shouted, "Laura, how can you be so heartless!"



"You think I'm the villain?" Laura sneered, rolling her eyes. "Alec,weren't you the one who allowed me to teach Verena a lesson? Without your approval, would I have dared? Now that it's gone awry, you pretend to be righteous and throw all the blame on me. Stop acting like a saint!"



After decades together, Laura knew every crevice of Alec's mind and laid his hypocrisy bare with a few words.



Humiliated before his children, Alec's fury boiled over.



He ground out between clenched teeth, "You shameless liar!"



Laura shot back instantly, "Liar? Then what are you?A cunning fox? Or a hypocritical pretender?"



Pushed past his limit, Alec raised his hand, ready to strike her.



But Kaia and Luka rushed forward, pulling them apart



Laura, clutched by Kaia, snapped coldly, "Let go, Kaia I want to see if he truly has the guts to hit me."



"Madwoman! Lunatic!" Alec spat, straining against Luka's grip as if to lunge again.



"Enough! stop causing unnecessary drama!" Luka's voice thundered across the room, cutting through the chaos.



Alec and Laura froze, and once Alec ceased struggling,Kaia released her hold on her mother's shoulders.



All three turned to Luka.



Luka took in the sight-his father's disheveled suit, his mother's tousled hair.


His frown deepened. "Dad, Mom, I know you're furious about Verena, but don't forget Isaac's words before he left. He said plainly he will only marry Verena-not a daughter of the Willis family. The meaning is crystal clear. Whether she returns home or not, his decision stands. But now that she's stormed out in anger, if we fail to win her forgiveness before the wedding,she will turn Isaac against us. And the Bennett family can topple us as easily as snapping a twig."



Luka exhaled, speaking with calm reason."The priority now is not to quarrel but to devise a strategy to mend this. Otherwise, all our shouting will only hasten our downfall."



The other three Willis family members had been swept away by emotion, blind to reason. Only Luka, standing a step outside the fray,kept his head cool and pinpointed the crux of the matter.


Hearing his clear analysis, Alec felt a sting of shame,though he masked it.



Straightening his back, he smoothed his collar and forced composure.



Clearing his throat, he nodded stiffly. "Luka is right.We cannot afford to offend Isaac. The urgent task is to fix this matter at once."



Laura, too, steadied herself after Luka's sober reminder.





The four Willis family members sank onto the sofas,their minds heavy with worry as they pondered a way out.



After a long silence,Alec finally broke it.this moment, there is only one solution."

###Chapter 52 Apologize To Verena
The sting of Alec's earlier words lingered, and Laura and Kaia sat stiff with anger.



When he spoke, their eyes drifted toward him,curiosity momentarily breaking through their own thoughts.



"So,what exactly are you thinking, Dad?" asked Luka.



After drawing in a steady breath, Alec looked straight at Laura. "You need to bring Verena home and give her a proper apology," he said firmly.


Laura shot to her feet, her voice sharp with disbelief."Did I hear you right? Why should I be the one going after her? I'm her mother, and she ought to apologize to me. Who gave that girl the right to turn things upside down?"



In that moment, Alec couldn't stop himself from recalling how the wives of other powerful families always carried themselves with composure and grace.



"Why are you making this harder than it is?" said Alec,his voice edged with frustration. "You're the one who hurt her. What's so impossible about going after Verena and setting things right?"



The calm certainty in his tone only fueled Laura's temper. To her, Verena's running away wasn't all on her shoulders, so why should she be forced to clean up the mess alone?



Her frustration grew heavier with every thought, until she shouted, "Listen to me, Alec. I will never bend to that girl. Not now, not ever!"


Noticing her fury spiraling out of control, Luka tugged her gently back to her seat. "Mom, please. Tae a breath and let's at least hear Dad out."



Kaia steadied her mother with one hand and tapped her chest in a soothing rhythm. "Momm, Luka's right. We don't have a clear solution yet, so let's hear what Dad has in mind."



Every word of Luka's earlier reasoning had already sunk deep into Kaia's mind.


Even though Kaia's heart burned with dislike for Verena and she longed to see her cast aside, the idea of losing everything terrified her more.


Since Verena mattered deeply to lsaac,crossing her meant challenging the Bennett family itself-a risk that promised disastrous consequences.



Much as she despised the thought, Kaia knew Isaac's warning had been right all along. Destroying the Willis family would take lsaac little effort, and Kaia knew it.



Her place in society meant everything to her, and she would cling to it at any cost. From the start,she had been sheltered like a delicate flower, never knowing the weight of the outside world. Poverty was a fate she could never imagine enduring.



Anyway, she wasn't the one to swallow her pride and apologize to Verena.



Only after her children pleaded with her did Laura's temper ease slightly.



Settling back onto the sofa, she crossed one leg over the other and raised her chin high before cutting her gaze toward Alec. "You know Verena. That girl has a mind of her own. Even if I show up at her door, I can't promise she'll agree to come back."



Regret gnawed at her for ever dragging Verena into the city, since all it had done was stir up chaos in her life.



Recognizing the seriousness of the moment, Alec brushed aside her cold attitude. "Yes, Verena's stubborn. But don't forget-it was you who cast her out. That's the reason she bolted. Arguments between mothers and daughters never last forever. If you swallow your pride and speak from the heart, she'll come back with you."


No sense of maternal warmth stirred in her chest,since Verena had never once felt like a daughter she could call her own.



Laura kept her silence, and Alec's voice turned sharp."You made this mess, so you're the one who fixes it.Isaac already warned us. If the Bennett family steps in,we'll be ruined in no time. Go and face Verena, or stay here enjoying your luxuries until you're shoved back into a life of dirt and fields."



He spelled out the threat in plain terms, aware that nothing frightened Laura more than being dragged back into poverty. He was certain she grasped the weight of his warning.



As his words sank in, Laura's face shifted, the bravado slipping from her features.


In moments, the glamor she wore like armor crumbled,leaving her looking worn and fragile.



A heavy fear pressed into her chest as Alec's warning echoed in her mind.



The thought of Isaac exacting revenge for Verena's sake filled her with dread.



Never again would she allow herself to live in some crumbling, shabby house. The memory of living in poverty had worn her down long ago, and the fear of reiving it haunted her still.


Losing her status and prestige felt more unbearable to her than death itself.



Death seemed kinder than being forced back into that harsh,meager existence.


At last, reality struck her down, and she felt utterly defeated.



Only a short while earlier, she swore she'd never bow to Verena, yet now reality left her with no choice but to think again.



"Fine. If it means keeping this family afloat, I'll swallow my pride," she said through gritted teeth.



The moment Laura gave in, a collective sigh of relief slipped from the others.



In the end, the person who created the problem had to be the one to undo it.



"But where exactly is Verena? How am I supposed to track her down if I don't even know where she's hiding?"Laura snapped.



"That part isn't your concern," said Alec. "I'll have Larry handle the search." Her brows pinched together before she mumbled,"Alright then."



Once he finished delegating, Alec checked the time on his watch.



Isaac's sudden appearance had already thrown his entire schedule off balance.



"It's late already," said Alec, rising to leave."I'll head to the office. Stay alert for Larry's updates."



···



By the time midday rolled around, Larry Marsh finally sent Laura a message, revealing Verena's location along with a room number.


When she saw the name of the luxury hotel, doubt and unease twisted in her stomach.



How on earth could Verena possibly afford a place like this?



The memory of the picture on Kaia's phone came rushing back, and Laura's cheeks burned with shame.



How could she ended up with a daughter bold enough to act so shamelessly?



If word of this ever spread, she'd be the center of ridicule. Still, this wasn't the moment to dwell on shame.Laura ordered the driver to ready the car without delay.


When the car pulled up to the hotel, Laura stepped out by herself and headed straight for the elevator.



Reaching the door to Verena's room, she lingered,her thoughts colliding in a storm of doubt and pride.



The idea of lowering herself before Verena left a bitter taste, made worse by the cruel words she had used to cast her out.



Laura's fingers curled into tight fists as she forced her lungs to steady with slow, deliberate breaths.



Surely Verena would gloat at the thought of being begged to return, wouldn't she?



In her mind, there wouldn't even be a need for persuasion-Verena would fall in line and come back without protest.



Laura convinced herself Verena had run crying to Isaac,hoping he'd send them to fetch her. Riding on that certainty, she jabbed the doorbell.


Across the room, Verena leaned over her desk,grinding herbs she'd picked up earlier, mixing them into ointment meant to ease Isaac's injury. The sound of the bell brought back her promise to Isaac that morning-he was always welcome to drop by.



Thinking of Isaac's shy yet serious look, Verena let a smile spread and hurried to answer whoever was at the door.



A playful comment slipped out as she imagined Isaac behind the door. "You really do as you're told,Isaac..."


But as soon as she opened the door, Verena's smile disappeared completely.



Verena froze for a second, but then she quickly pulled herself together. "What are you doing here?"


"You already know why I came," said Laura, folding her arms as her voice stayed flat. "I shouldn't have said those things to you. You've made your point.Don't you think it's time to come back home?Wandering around like this-what kind of example is that?"



"Back home? Oh, that's funny," said Verena, her tone light as if she had just heard a joke. "Mrs. Willis, you've got the wrong idea. That isn't my home, and you're not my mother."



Laura instantly recognized how she was throwing her earlier words back at her. The stubborn look on Verena's face made Laura's chest tighten. How could the two daughters she gave birth to be so opposite?


Kaia had always been bright and obedient. But this one was useless, lost in her own fantasies.



If it weren't for Isaac, Laura wouldn't care if she ever saw Verena again.


She forced a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes "Verena, I was only angry when I said that. You shouldn't take it to heart. I've been worried sick about you. You can't be resting well in some hotel. Be a good girl and come back with me. The whole family's waiting for you."
###Chapter 53 Sharing A Night Together Makes A...

Laura's sudden change of tone left Verena knitting her brows in puzzlement. After all those years of cold neglect, without a shred of guilt, this abrupt sweetness reeked of suspicion.



In a flash, Verena recalled what Isaac had told her that very morning. The picture became clear-Laura's new approach must have been stirred by Isaac's warning.Otherwise, with Laura's temperament, she would never have come seeking her out. To Laura,she had never truly been a daughter at all.


The whole family was waiting for her? Verena mused with a faint smnirk. How bitterly ironic those words sounded.



With a small, wry smile, she said, "Last night, you made it plain you didn't recognize me as your daughter and told me to leave. Surely, those words are still fresh in your mind. There's no need for pretenses. What's spoken can't be unspoken-you own it, and so do l."



The reminder of the previous night's exchange darkened Laura's face. This obstinate girl was unearthing past grievances, even after she had ference stooped so low as to ask her to return home. Did Verena expect her to fall on her knees in apology?



Still,Laura forced a gracious smile, coating her words with honey. "Verena, they say quarrels between mother and daughter never last. Look, even when you struck my hand,I never took it to heart. Why cling to trifles? They were words said in anger, nothing mnore ..."



Verena answered with a soft chuckle.



Laura mistook it for yielding and felt a swell of triumph.As she thought, Verena feared abandonment; a few kind words, and she was halfway convinced. All their fretting had been needless.



But her joy was short-lived. Verena's smile faded,her voice cutting cold. "I never regret my words. While it may be true that grudges between mother and daughter should not linger, in my eyes, you lost the right to be my mother long ago."


Without another glance, Verena closed the door.Years of disappointment had eroded her patience.Besides, Laura's sudden visit was no act of concern-it was simply spurred by Isaac's warning.


The heavy thud of the door slamming shut struck Laura like a slap across the face. Wait-was this... a refusal to return to the Willis family home? 
Her features twisted with fury, her simmering anger now blazing. In her mind, it was always the child who sought forgiveness from the parent, never the other way around. She had already lowered herself by coming here, yet Verena dared to show her such disdain.



Seething, Laura pounded on the door and shouted,"Open the door, Verena! Open it now!"


Verena,unmoved,ignored the storm outside.



With silence behind the door, Laura's temper boiled over. She struck it again and threatened fiercely,"Have you forgotten the marriage alliance with the Bennett family? Do you not wish to marry lsaac and live a life of comfort? Isaac may care only for you,but his mother won't. If you're no daughter of the Willis family, she'll never agree! Go back now-there's still a chance!"



Even with the hotel's soundproof walls, Laura's shrill voice pierced through, revealing the depth of her agitation.



Unruffled, Verena lifted the receiver and called the front desk.



"Hello, how may I help you?" came a sweet voice.

 
Verena answered calmly, "There's someone outside my door causing a disturbance. Could you please take care of it?"



"Certainly, we'll be right there," the staff member replied courteously.



Verena thanked her and ended the call.


Soon after, hotel security arrived. Laura, hoarse from yelling,was approached by a young woman in uniform.



"Ma'am, we've had a complaint about a disturbance.Please leave at once," she said,gesturing to the exit.



Laura's brows knitted. A complaint? No doubt from that ungrateful girl.



She longed to retort, but her eyes caught the two burly guards standing behind the young woman.Clearly, they were not to be trifled with.



Swallowing nervously, Laura cast a venomous glare at the closed door, as though she couldpierce through and strike Verena down with her stare. That insolent brat had the upper hand this time!



"Do you know who I am? How dare you try to throw me out?" she barked, clinging to her Willis status.



But the young woman, smiling politely, replied,"No matter who you are, if you disturb our guests, you must leave." 
Realizing defiance was unwise, and fearing the guards might actually drag her away, Laura turned and left,her pride bleeding into silent rage.



At last, the corridor grew quiet.


Verena leaned back in her chair, staring up at the ceiling.



What exactly had Isaac said to provoke Laura's visit?


She could only guess, but the Willis family always put their interests first. Isaac must have warned them with sharp words, threatening their standing.


The thought of Isaac shielding her brought a soft smile to her lips.


She lifted her phone and sent him a message.



Feigning innocence, she typed, "Laura came to reconcile today,wanting me back home. Did you say something to them?"


In his office, Isaac was reviewing Willis Group's business reports when his screen lit up.



He glanced at it, saw Verena's message,and without hesitation replied, "Yes, I gave them a warning."



Lying on her bed, Verena broke into a wide grin at his candid admission. She loved that mix of seriousness and hidden shyness in him, so she decided to tease.



Instead of typing, she sent a playful voice message,her tone laced with charm. "Sharing a night together makes a difference, doesn't it? You're already standing up for your fiancée."



Her words-sharing a night together-slipped out softly, tinged with coquettish delight.


Isaac listened, and his heartbeat thundered in his chest.His ears turned crimson. Though nothing truly intimate had happened, last night's closeness had been charged enough to set histhoughts ablaze.



Her teasing was too vivid,difficult not to picture.


He pressed his lips together, steadying himself,and then recorded a reply, his tone restrained. "If you ever need anything, you can always come to me."


After a pause, worried she might misunderstand,he hastily added, "Not because of last night."



Hearing his hurried clarification, Verena burst into Laughter. Shy yet stubbornly dignified, he was undeniably endearing.


 
Glancing at the clock, she noticed it was nearly lunchtime. 
She tapped and sent him a video call request.



Isaac, seeing her avatar pop up, froze for a moment.


Reflexively, he adjusted his tie before accepting.


When the video connected, their eyes locked. Silence hung between them.



Verena studied him, waiting to see if he would break it.


Isaac,however, was still caught on her earlier teasing,momentarily tongue-tied.


At last, he cleared his throat and spoke.


"You..." He paused, gathering composure. "Did you want to talk about something?"



Through the screen, Verena noticed the faint curve at the corner of his lips. He was pleased, but still trying to mask it under his stern facade.



Her brow arched slightly-she hadn't realized he had this side to him.



Relaxing back, she twirled a strand of hair around her finger.



"Nothing in particular," she replied lazily, her voice dipped in playful lilt. "I just wanted to see whether my stern fiancé blushes when I tease him."

###Chapter 54 Touching Your Adam's Apple Through T...
Isaac could sense that Verena was teasing him deliberately.


For a moment, he paused, his fingers curling lightly against his knee.


He placed the phone on the stand before him, his figure looking slightly distant in the frame.


When his silence lingered, Verena smiled and urged gently, "Come a bit closer."


That way,she could see him more clearly.


But Isaac didn't move, so she coaxed again, "Come on,just a little closer."



Her voice carried a softness, almost sweet enough to melt the edges of his restraint, sending a subtle tingling through his heart.


His lips parted faintly, though no words came out. Still,he obeyed-bringing the phone nearer until his entire face filled the screen.



Verena fixed her gaze on him, unashamedly so. She  had to admit-he was strikingly handsome. The depth of his eyes, the bridge of his nose, and the lines of his features seemed carved with intent.



She made no effort to conceal her stare. As she herself had said, after sharing a night together,something had shifted between them.



Heat rose to Isaac's ears beneath her burning gaze.



Just as he was about to retreat from the camera,Verena suddenly laughed.


"Oh, your face isn't red," she said, eyes glimmering,"but your ears are."


Her tone rose with a playful lilt, laced with a subtle charm.



Isaac avoided her eyes, his gaze sliding downward-only to catch sight of something unintended. His pupils widened in surprise.



Verena, staying in the hotel room, was dressed in a thin robe. While she lay on her stomach on the bed,her movement caused the neckline to slip open,revealing a generous curve of her tender, rounded breasts.



Isaac's breath stalled. The image consumed his thoughts, pulling him back to the memory of last night-her warmth, her scent, the weight of her leaning against his chest.


Realizing where his mind was drifting, he frowned slightly, lips pressed tight as if to guard against temptation.



His Adam's apple shifted visibly as he tore his gaze away from the sight.



From the corner of his eye, he noticed Verena reaching toward the camera, as if trying to touch him through the screen.



In a low, husky voice, he asked, "What are you doing?"



Verena, bold as ever, answered without a trace of shyness, "I'm imagining touching your Adam's apple through the screen."



On his side, Isaac's head was tilted slightly upward,exposing the clean lines of his neck. His Adam's apple,prominent and smooth, rose and fell in view,tantalizing under her gaze.



Her straightforwardness left Isaac blushing,yet instead of discomfort, another thought slipped in-did she like it?



Watching her fascinated expression, he felt a quiet sense of peace. For a man like him, having something she liked was already more than enough. After a brief daze, Verena recalled something and said,"Oh, in a couple of days, it's time for your treatment again. I don't feel like going out lately, so why don't you come over instead? Just have your assistant bring the medical kit."



Isaac's expression stiffened for a beat, and then he nodded."Alright."



Seeing his shyness creeping back, Verena smoothly changed the subject.


She glanced behind him and asked, "Are you still working at this hour?"



Snapping back to himself, Isaac answered, "Yes."


"And have you had lunch?" she asked again.



He shook his head."Not yet."


Verena frowned lightly, her tone tinged with genuine concern. "Then eat something first, and get back to work afterward."



Her words carried the warmth of care.



Isaac looked at her deeply, his gaze softer than usual.He cherished such a warm feeling.


"Did you hear me, lsaac?" she pressed, seeing him lost in thought. He pursed his lips and answered gently, "Okay, I'll eat right away."


Satisfied with his compliance, Verena eased.



Before ending the call, she reminded him, "Remember,come to the hotel in two days. And don't go to the wrong place."


Glancing at the call duration, Isaac lowered his head and let out a quiet chuckle.



After a pause, he pressed the intercom. "Jacob, bring in the lunch."



A crisp "Yes" came through.


Soon after, Jacob entered the office lounge, carrying the meal.


Once he laid it out, lsaac took the fork and began eating.



Watching him, Jacob felt puzzled. Barely ten minutes ago, lsaac had dismissed lunch, claimning he wasn't hungry. What changed his mind so suddenly?



When the meal was done, Isaac returned to his desk."Jacob," he called.



"Yes, Mr. Bennett?" Jacob stepped forward. Flipping through a stack of documents, Isaac asked casually, "Isn't Willis Group opening a high-end club in the city center soon?"



Jacob blinked, momentarily taken aback, and then nodded."Yes."



Leaning back in his chair, Isaac tapped his fingers against the armrest in steady rhythm.



After a brief silence, his voice came slow and deliberate. "Tell Beckett the Willis club doesn't meet fire safety standards. It poses a major public hazard.He'll know what to do."



Jacob was stunned. Beckett Clark oversaw safety and enforcement.



At first, Jacob didn't quite grasp Isaac's aim. But once the order was spoken, clarity struck-lsaac was shielding his future wife.


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood. I'll contact Beckett immediately."




...



Beckett wasted no time. After receiving Jacob's message,he personally led a team to the site.


Sure enough, safety risks were found. The club was promptly sealed off.



By afternoon, the much-anticipated club was shut down before it could open.


When Alec heard, he nearly toppled from his chair.Rage and panic flooded him, his chest tightening with such force that he hurriedly swallowed a few pills for relief.



His brows knitted deep, his mind spinning in confusion.He had secured every connection, checked every detail before announcing the launch. Fire safety had been accounted for-so how could it collapse overnight?



The blow came like a thunderclap, leaving his thoughts in fragments.



Desperate, Alec snatched up his phone to call a friend,hoping for help-or at least guidance.



After three rings, the line connected.



"It's me, Alec," he blurted before the other could speak.


After a brief exchange of greetings, he rushed on,"Didn't I tell you a few days ago about Willis Group's new club? Out of nowhere today, we received an order to halt operations for rectification. Your network runs deep-can you find a way to help?" "Well..." the voice on the other end trailed, troubled With a sigh, he added, "Alec, it's not that I won't help.I can't. Beckett Clark himself intervened this time.Who dares go against him?"



Alec's face drained, his eyes tightening with dread.


"Alec, did you offend someone lately?" his friend speculated. Then he paused, thoughtful. "Wait. Aren't you supposed to be forming an alliance with the Bennett family? If that's the case,no one in Shoildon should risk targeting you. So how could you have provoked this? Besides, with Beckett on close terms with lsaac, he wouldn't normally deny you that courtesy."

###Chapter 55 Trying To Visit Barrie
At those words, Alec's eyes tightened in suspicion.Isaac-it could only be him!


In an instant, Alec grasped the truth, his body stiff and unmoving. Yes, without question, it was Isaac-it had to be.



The realization struck Alec that Isaac had made a move against the Willis family for Verena.


Yet what stunned him most was the speed of it. He had assumed it was only empty words, but lsaac had already taken action.


Dropping his elbows onto the desk, Alec buried his head in his hands, refusing to accept what was happening. More than ten years ago, on little more than a whim, he had poured in all his savings and struck gold with his investments. Wealth came overnight, yet he clung to the same business he had always known. In reality, no serious challenge had ever crossed his path.



For several years, the club had been his focus. He had poured his heart into it, only to watch everything unravel within hours. The Bennett family's pressure crushed his progress, forcing every plan to a halt. No -he had to find a way out, and quickly







Sometime after ten that night, a sleek black car rolled into the grounds of Willis Villa.



From the doorway, Laura watched Alec step out of the car while she reached for his briefcase. "Why did you come back so late tonight? Kaia and Luka finished their dinner long ago and are already asleep."



Normally, Laura paid him little attention, but tonight was different. Not bringing Verena along left her unsettled, and the unease made her unusually watchful.



"Are you hungry?" she asked, and then quickly turned toward the housekeeper. "Warm up the food."



"What's the use of reheating anything? Just the sight of you fills me with anger!" Alec barked.



Each time Alec dwelled on the company's problems that stemmed from Laura, fury surged through him Most men dreamed of marrying a virtuous wife, yet he was stuck with one who brought nothing but frustration and letdowns.



Laura's neck grew rigid under his shouting, and the smile on her face faltered. "Alec, why are you this upset?"



Alec's features contorted with rage. "You really want to know why I'm furious? If you hadn't picked a fight with Verena and cut ties with her, she wouldn't have run off, and Isaac wouldn't have shown up to demand payback! Because of you, our club that was about to open is now facing closure!"



"Closure?" Laura repeated, her brows knitting together in confusion. "What in the world is going on?"



After drawing several heavy breaths, Alec leveled a resentful glare at her. "Isaac sent his people to act on his command. He's backing Verena. That club was the product of years of my effort, and now, thanks to you,it's ruined."



Casting his eyes toward the living room,he asked,"Didn't you promise to apologize to Verena and bring her home? Then where is she now?"



Realizing there was no escaping the question, Laura averted her face with clear irritation.



"I went there,but she flatly refused to return with me.Instead, she summoned security and had me thrown out,leaving me utterly humiliated. I shamed myself for nothing. If you want her back so badly, then you go get her."


Alec had clung to the hope that if Verena came back, she might persuade Isaac on his behalf. Laura's words shattered that final chance, and his fury flared even hotter.



"Is your pride worth this much? Even now, you stay stubborn! Do you have any idea how much money vanished in a single afternoon? If the club stays closed,every last bit of our investment will disappear.Do you understand how many workers depend on us for their paychecks? When they come demanding their wages,then you'll learn what true humiliation feels like!"



To drive the point home, Alec made the situation sound even worse, hoping Laura would finally realize how serious things had become.



At last, Laura sensed the full weight of the problem,pressing her lips together to cover the panic stirring inside her. A spark of realization soon flickered in her eyes.



"Oh, of course!" Laura spun toward Alec, her earlier grim look replaced by sudden excitement. "How could we overlook something this important? Kaia healed Barrie's leg, practically giving him his life back! That was no small favor, and he owes us for it. With us in such dire straits now, how could he possibly refuse to help?"



The moment he heard her words, Alec felt a rush of relief, as if he had stumbled across a lifeline in the middle of his despair. Clarity washed over him at once.


With renewed energy, he exclaimed,"Yes,how could that slip our minds? Barrie treasures loyalty and gratitude. Since Kaia gave him such a favor, he'll be sure to repay it. Tomorrow morning I'll have the butler deliver a formal letter requesting an audience with him."



Early the following morning, Alec ordered his butler to take the letter he had prepared the night before straight to the Lyons family home.



Restlessly pacing through the living room, Laura murmured, "It's been so long since the letter was sent.Why hasn't there been any response?"



"Stop pacing back and forth in front of me. You're making me dizzy," Alec said with a frown from the sofa. "It hasn't even been that long since the letter went out. Sit down and be patient. Surely Barrie will want to read it thoroughly before responding, don't you think?"



Even as he spoke calmly, Alec's own nerves gnawed at him. He was more anxious than Laura and had already put business matters aside just to remain at home waiting for Barrie's reply.


Meanwhile, in the Lyons family's back garden, Barrie sat at a table enjoying breakfast, while his son Fletcher Lyons seized the rare chance to share the meal with him.



Their light conversation paused when the butler approached them.



Offering a slight nod to Fletcher, the butler handed Barrie a letter. "The chairman of Willis Group has written to you,requesting a visit."



"Alec Willis?" Barrie asked in surprise, taking the letter and scanning it quickly. "Our families rarely cross paths, so why is he suddenly reaching out to me?"


"What else could the reason be?" Fletcher remarked,handing Barrie a slice of cake. "Willis Group poured hundreds of millions into that club downtown,and just yesterday Beckett shut it down for failing fire safety regulations. He must be out of options and turning to you for help."



News of the closure had already spread through Shoildon like wildfire by yesterday afternoon.



Barrie, however, enjoyed the quiet of his own quarters in his old age and seldom paid attention to outside matters.



Setting the invitation down on the table, Barrie bit into the cake Fletcher offered. "How could a club of that size, backed by so much money, fail something as basic as fire safety checks?" Within business circles, greater sums of money always demanded stricter precautions. Everyone knew that being exposed by the simplest mistakes was the last thing they could afford.



Fletcher gave a knowing smirk. "Passing or failing safety checks depends entirely on Beckett."



Barrie dabbed his mouth with a handkerchief,confusion flickering in his eyes. "What did Alec do to offend Beckett?"



In on the truth, Fletcher shook his head with a faint smile. "It wasn't Beckett. The order came from lsaac."


Yesterday afternoon, when people close to Beckett asked about the details, Beckett openly admitted the command came from lsaac.



Had Isaac wanted his role kept secret, Beckett never would have revealed the truth.



By making it public, Beckett signaled that Isaac intended everyone to know he was the one behind Willis Group's club closure.



Fletcher's words only deepened Barrie's confusion."Isn't Isaac going to marry the Willis family's eldest daughter? Why would he act against them?"


Barrie struggled to make sense of it. Refusing to support his future father-in-law's business was one thing, but giving orders to sabotage Alec outright-what kind of logic was that?



Fletcher paused in thought,remembering when Slater had once said the Willis family's eldest daughter was unattractive and ill-tempered. He had scolded Slater then for spreading gossip, yet even now he couldn't help feeling pity for lsaac. Such a bright young man,but after that car accident...
###Chapter 56 Repaying Dr.Willis
With a quiet sigh, Fletcher guessed aloud. "Maybe Isaac is unhappy with his fiancée and feels powerless in this marriage arrangement. He could be using this as a chance to push the Willis family into canceling the engagement."



Having watched Isaac grow from a boy into a man,Barrie wore a grave expression.



At such a young age, Isaac had already lost his ability to walk and was now bound to a marriage with a woman he despised.



Not only did Isaac feel burdened, but the entire Lyons family pitied his situation.



Fletcher voiced his doubt next. "Alec needs to be sharper. Doesn't he check into relationships before seeking favors? Why would we interfere with someone Isaac is trying to deal with?"


After a short pause, he added, "Still, Alec isn't stupid.He rose to fortune almost overnight and built Willis Group into what it is today."


Following a moment of thought, Barrie said to the butler, "Get in touch with the Willis family and learn what you can."



The butler answered with respect, and then went off to search for the Willis family's number and place the call.



Inside the Willis Villa, Laura looked over at the wall clock. "It's already nine o'clock, and we still haven't heard back. Do you think Barrie is avoiding the trouble because he doesn't want to return the favor?"



Alec answered in a low, firm tone, "Nonsense! Barrie is known all over Shoildon for his integrity. You think everyone stoops to your way of thinking?"



Even as he mocked her, his eyes flicked to the clock,and his fists tightened.



The cup of coffee in front of him sat untouched,long since grown cold.



Truthfully, unease was gnawing at him.



His train of thought broke off when the landline suddenly rang



Alec and Laura froze in surprise, and then rushed toward the ornate round table to answer the call.


The screen displayed no name at all, only a short string of numbers. When Alec answered the call, he spoke cautiously."Hello, Alec Willis speaking."


On the other end, an aged, gravelly voice replied,"Good morning, Mr. Willis. This is Morris Fowler, the butler of MMr. Barrie Lyons."



At that, Alec looked over at Laura, and the nervous tension weighing on them both immediately lifted.


Alec answered warmly,, Mr. Fowler, I've heard of you. You've been with Mr. Lyons since your youth,skilled in so many things, and still impressive even in your sixties."


The praise flowed easily, masking Alec's eagerness beneath a layer of flattery.


"That's very kind of you, Mr. Willis." Morris, long used to such words, skipped over them and asked directly,"Mr. Lyons has seen your letter. What is the matter you wish to discuss with him?"


Laura, standing beside Alec, gave his elbow a small nudge, urging him to bring up the request without delay.


Still, Alec understood that men like Barrie had no patience for empty pleas without proper justification.


So,he chose to lean on sentiment and bring up Kaia's name.



"It's nothing too serious," Alec said with a gentle smile and a note of concern. "I only wished to ask how Mr.Lyons' injured leg is doing. The weather is cold now,and he ought to take care of his health."



Morris knitted his brows, puzzled by Alec's sudden concern over Barrie's condition.



At that moment, Alec let out a regretful sigh. "If I had realized sooner that my daughter could heal Mr.Lyons ' leg, I would have sent her years ago and spared him all that needless suffering."


Of course, Alec twisted the truth, fully aware that Kaia had not been capable of such work at the time.



That detail hardly mattered now. What counted was that he sounded sincere and that Morris remembered it was his daughter who had brought recovery to Barrie's leg.



In the end, the Lyons family remained indebted to the Willis family.



Once the call ended, Morris wasted no time and stepped quickly outside.



When Morris repeated Alec's message, Barrie grew quiet, lost in thought as he  considered the possibility.Dr.Willis had chosen to remain somewhat anonymous, revealing only her family name.



A moment later, Moris put forward a new idea. "That physician shared the surname Willis. Is it possible she's Alec's daughter, Mr. Lyons?"


Barrie's eyes brightened with understanding,his jaw slackening a bit. "My recovery hasn't been publicized.If this information reached them, there's a great chance Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter."


Turning his focus to Fletcher, he asked, "Can you tell me how many girls are in the Willis family?"



Knowledgeable about the household, Fletcher answered without hesitation, "They have two daughters. The older one is Isaac's fiancée. She grew up out in the countryside and reportedly didn't finish her last year of high school. The younger daughter is studying medicine and is said to be quite skilled."



Confirmation dawned on Barrie, and he smacked the table with a burst of excitement. "There it is! If the younger daughter's studying medicine, she must be Dr.Willis who healed my leg."



Determined, Barrie continued, "If Alec's daughter is the doctor who treated me, I owe her more than I can say. The Willis family deserves my help with their club problems-even if lsaac objects. Now, help me up!"Bracing himself with his cane, he insisted, "I want to speak to the Willis family myself. Take me inside."



The shared enthusiasm was clear as Fletcher quickly guided Barrie indoors.



Over at the Willis Villa, Alec felt surprised to hear the Lyons family calling back so soon.



As soon as he answered, an exuberant voice from the other end cut in before he could introduce himself."Mr. Willis, I owe you thanks. You've raised a remarkable and considerate daughter."



Though pride was unmistakable, Alec managed a humble reply. "Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Lyons.She certainly has a mischievous side."



Barrie responded warmly, "Don't sell her short, Mr.Willis. Your daughter is exceptionally well-mannered.It's a shame my grandson isn't good enough for her.Otherwise, it would be an honor if she joined my family."



Even though Alec heard Barrie's wish, he remained cautious about reading too much into it, focusing instead on the business at hand.



For Alec, the business matter came first.



Alec had only just begun to bring up the issue with the club when Barrie's strong voice interrupted him. "I'm aware of the problems regarding your club. Give me some time,and I'll take care of it."



Gratitude spread across Alec's features. "Your support means everything, Mr. Lyons. Thank you."


Without missing a beat, Barrie added, "Will you be available the day after tomorrow? If so, myfamily and I would like to pay a visit and show our appreciation."



Laura nearly let out a cheer, unable to contain her happiness.


Having one of Shoildon's most respected families come to visit would lift the Willis family's status to a new level.


Matching Laura's excitement, Alec nodded again and again, taking a deep breath to calm himself. "You are always welcome, Mr. Lyons. It's an honor for our family."



The phone call left Alec and Laura practically bursting with excitement, their energy lasting until Kaia finally returned from school later that day.


As soon as she stepped inside, Laura hurried over,cradled Kaia's cheeks, and planted a kiss on her forehead."You really are a wonderful daughter, Kaia.Every bit of love I've ever given you was worth it."

 ###Chapter 57 Don't Tell Me You Are Actually Jealous
Kaia's eyebrows knitted together,confusion flickering across her face. "Mom, what's gotten you all worked up?"


Laura could barely contain her excitement,her whole face lighting up. "You won't believe it-Barrie Lyons called this morning. He's not only stepping in to fix the club mess, but he said he'd drop by in two days to thank you himself for curing his leg!"


"Seriously?" Kaia blinked in surprise, and then broke into a wide, unstoppable smile. "He's coming here?"


Laura laughed and tugged her over to the couch."Why would I make that up? If you're doubting me,ask your dad."


Looking at Alec,Kaia immediately noticed the change.He seemed lighter, a genuine smile softening his features.


"She's telling the truth," Alec admitted, his tone gentle."Barrie couldn't stop praising you-said you're considerate, remarkable, and well-mannered."


Ever since Kaia's birth, Alec had considered her a lucky us charm. When fortune smiled on the family, he was sure she brought the blessing. That certainty faded over the years, but hearing Barrie's praise brought the old feeling rushing back.



To Alec, Kaia was the best thing that ever happened to them.



Laura squeezed Kaia's hand, still brimming with pride."And that's not all. Barrie even joked that it's a shame his grandson isn't good enough for you, or he'd love for you to marry into their family. That's how highly he thinks of you."



Compliments piling up, Kaia couldn't hide her delight.She smoothed her hair, chin tipping up with newfound confidence. "Honestly, I've never been short on admirers. If all my admirers from school lined up, we'd have a traffic jam on the block. And I'm no less than Slater. To say Slater is not good enough for me isn't exactly wrong."


Her playful confidence seemed to lift everyone's mood,leaving the whole house buzzing with pride.


"That's true," Laura said with a warm smile, reaching up to smooth Kaia's hair. "But keep this in mind-humility and manners go a long way, especially with families like theirs. They notice those things. When Barrie visits,be sure you look your best." Her mother's advice rang true, and Kaia knew exactly what was at stake. The Willis family and the Lyons family lived in different worlds, and she understood how much appearances mattered. "I get it, Mom. You don't have to worry. I'll keep my eyes and ears open,and I won't speak unless I need to."



Alec and Laura exchanged a proud glance, grateful for a daughter who never made life difficult.



Their thoughts drifted-almost involuntarily-to Verena.





Compared to Kaia, their other daughter always seemed determined to go her own way.



A complicated look passed over Alec's face. Only last night, he'd argued with Laura about bringing Verena home no matter the cost. Now, after the call from the Lyons family, he hadn't brought it up once. If Verena wanted to walk out of their lives, maybe it was time to let her.



Laura's happiness was impossible to miss-her smile stretched wide, pride sparkling in her eyes.



Why should she worry about Verena having Isaac? The Lyons family's support meant far more, and now their own future felt secure.



Even if the Bennett family was out of reach, Laura doubted Verena could cause trouble from a distance.



Feeling bold, she grabbed her phone and shot off a quick message to Verena.	"You're really underestimating both your father and your sister. Just because you have Isaac doesn't mean we're powerless.Don't count us out so quickly."



With a sigh, Verena gave a quick glance at Laura's message, her lips curling in a smirk.


Yesterday, Laura played the part of the doting,humble mother; today, she strutted around as if she ruled the world.If that wasn't a warning sign, Verena didn't know what was.



No response felt necessary. She locked her phone screen, dropped it onto the coffee table,and decided Laura's theatrics could wait for another day.


Half an hour passed before lsaac showed up at her door.



Jacob arrived just a step behind, setting the medical kit down on the table, eyes darting between his boss and Verena, as if waiting for a signal.


Verena flipped open the case, methodically checking every supply inside. "Jacob, you'll want to wait in the car this time. We might be a while."


Uncertain, Jacob lingered, looking to lsaac for guidance.



A brief silence hung between them before lsaac caught Verena's steady gaze, the intensity in her eyes making him look away



"You can wait outside, Jacob," Isaac said. "I'll call when we're finished here."



As soon as Jacob disappeared down the hall, Verena gently pushed Isaac's wheelchair into the bedroom.



Warm,floral notes filled the air, wrapping them both in a sense of quiet intimacy. Isaac's attention drifted to the neatly made bed, the memory of their night together flashing in his mind.



He could still recall how easily his hand had circled her slender waist-how small and delicate she'd felt,held close beneath the sheets.



Whenever she lay against him, it was as if she weighed nothing at all.



Every detail about her drew him in, except for that wild,unpredictable spirit that kept slipping through his fingers.



"Isaac."



A sudden rush of warmth danced along his ear as Verena's breath tickled his skin, making him go rigid Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac realized she'd come up behind him, her hands now resting firmly on his shoulders, her upper body pressed close.



He shifted, catching a glimpse of her elegant fingers,splayed over his shirt.


The moment sent a rush of memories through him-too vivid, too intimate. For once, the ever-composed Isaac felt thrown off balance.



"What..." His voice cracked,rough around the edges."Uh...what is it?"



Verena picked up on his nervousness with ease.


"Maybe I should be asking you," she murmured, her tone playful. "I must have said your name three times,and you didn't even blink. What's got you so distracted?"



Isaac fumbled for a reply. "It's nothing, just..."


She cut him off with a sly smnile, leaning in even closer, her words a secret meant only for him."Nothing? I'm guessing you were replaying that night in your head. The way you held my hand-how close we were?"



Her body pressed softly against his back, sending his pulse racing. So near, Verena could see the blush spreading across Isaac's cheeks and all the way to the tips of his ears.



"Relax, I'm just messing with you." Verena straightened, her hands slipping away. "Let's get started with your therapy."



Isaac's shoulders eased as he let out a shaky breath,looking every bit the guilty kid caught in the act.


Even now, her voice close to his ear kept replaying that night in his mind-the teasing, the laughter, and how powerless he'd felt against her charm.



Helping him settle on the bed, Verena carefully rolled up his shirt and reached for his belt buckle.



A look of alarm flashed across Isaac's face as he caught her wrists, voice a little breathless. "Wait-what are you doing?"



Tension rippled across his abdomen, muscles taut with anticipation and nerves.



With a calm glance, Verena answered, "I need to start your treatment."



Realizing he might be overreacting, he averted his gaze, his voice low. "I don't remember ever needing to undress for this before..." Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Things have changed. We used to focus just on your legs, but today's therapy targets a new area."



Color rose in his cheeks, but he still didn't release her hands. "Is that really necessary?"



"It is. I need access to your lower abdomen," Verena replied plainly.


For a moment, Isaac hesitated, clearly torn.



"Are you sure we can't do this another way?" he mumbled,almost hopeful.


She let out a gentle laugh,exasperation mingling with affection. "Isaac, trust me-if you want to get better,you'll have to let me do my job."



His hand still trapped hers, so Verena leaned in,locking eyes with him. "Are you planning to avoid intimacy forever, or are you actually going to let me help you?"



Heat rushed to Isaac's cheeks, and his grip slackened at once.



Taking the opportunity, Verena deftly unfastened his belt.



The faint click echoed between them, prompting lsaac us to snatch her wrists again, flustered. "I can handle this part myself," he muttered.



She let him take over, watching as his black trousers slipped just enough to expose his lower abdomen Quietly, Verena dipped her fingers into a jar of herbal ointment-a formula she'd painstakingly perfected these last few days, meant to target his condition.



His skin was hypersensitive to the touch, and even the cool, light pressure of her fingertips sent a shiver through him.



Verena leaned in close to make sure the ointment stayed put, the ends of her hair brushing his stomach and making him twitch with a mix of embarrassment and anticipation.



After smoothing the ointment, she rolled over a heat lamp,angling it toward him and switching it on.


While the medicine did its work, Verena crossed the room,picked up a small gift box, and carried it back to Isaac. Inside was a dark, elegant necktie.



"This is for you," she said, placing the tie in his hand.



It wasn't new-just something he'd left behind long ago in Clokron, after a night spent at her place when he refused to leave her side.



The night before, Gavin had managed to return the tie, slipping it back into Verena's hands.


Isaac turned the fabric over in his fingers,remembering how,at Fortune Garden Restaurant,he'd watched her tug the tie of the man she was with.



The color, the pattern-everything matched the one he held now.



The thought nagged at lsaac-had she given that tie to the man?



His gaze dropped, a faint frown shadowing his face



Even knowing the truth, he couldn't shake off the sting of jealousy.



Turning the tie over in his hands, he muttered, "You hand these out to everyone, or am I special?"



Verena caught the low rumble of his voice and looked over,brow raised. "What's that supposed to mean?"



He glanced away, voice even softer. "It's nothing.Forget it."



Verena's laughter was light. "You're seriously going to act like that? Why on earth would you think I'm giving ties to half the city?"


For a moment, Isaac stayed quiet, fingers tracing the fabric. Then, almost reluctantly, he spoke up."|saw you at the restaurant. The guy sitting across from you had a tie just like this. Did you give him one too?"



His last words sounded almost wounded-more boyish than he meant to.



Verena's smile widened as she leaned in, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Isaac, don't tell me you're actually jealous."

###Chapter 58 It Belongs To You Alone
Jealous?



Isaac's brows knitted faintly. He could not tell if what he felt was truly jealousy, yet every time he saw another man near Verena, a sharp pang twisted in his chest.



To make matters worse, Verena gifted him a tie that looked exactly like the one worn by that other man.


Isaac lowered his gaze, lips sealed in silence. Verena could see through him; whether he admitted it or not,there was a trace of jealousy in his heart.


She gently took the tie from his hand and explained patiently, "This tie was custom-made in Clokron There is no duplicate, no stock left behind.I asked my friend to bring it home for me, but finding it inconvenient, he casually wore it around his neck.That was the scene you stumbled upon in the restaurant."



Placing the tie back in his palm, she added softly,"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."


After all, the tie had always been his. Isaac, ever meticulous, had always worn ties designed by professionals with exacting care.


But since his memory still lay shrouded in amnesia,Verena left it at that, offering only a brief explanation.


Isaac looked down at the tie once more, her words echoing in his mind-"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."



What she had said so casually struck a deeper chord in him.



To Isaac, it sounded as if Verena had chosen it exclusively for him, a token meant to bind the two of them.



The thought stirred a sudden wave inside him, so strong he had to draw in a quiet breath to steady himself.



"Thank you," he murmured, a faint curve on his lips betraying his inner delight.


Verena caught his smile and tilted her head playfully."So, are you happy now? You're satisfied so easily,aren't you?"


Before he could reply, she leaned in and brushed a feather-light kiss across his cheek. "You're welcome.I'm just glad you're happy." 
Then, as though nothing had happened, Verena switched off the heating lamp, removed the ointment from his abdomen, and busied herself with quiet efficiency,leaving Isaac to wonder if that fleeting kiss had been real or merely an illusion of his longing



When the treatment was complete,Verena helped him sit upright and reminded him gently, "Don't take a bath once you're home tonight. If you feel uncomfortable, you may use a damp towel to wipe yourself down, but take care not to let water touch your abdomen."



Isaac nodded as he settled back into his wheelchair."Alright, I understand."


Verena didn't try to detain him further. Isaac called Jacob, who soon arrived upstairs and wheeled him toward the elevator.



...



Back at the Bennett residence, Isaac found Danica waiting on the sofa, her eyes fixed on him with a look of discontent.



From her expression alone, lsaac could already guess what was coming.


Sure enough, he had barely turned his wheelchair when Danica rose and demanded, "The Willis family's 
club was shut down. Was it your doing?"


Isaac stilled his wheels and answered without hesitation, "Yes. It was me."



Earlier,when Danica learned that someone influential had moved against the Willis family, she casually dispatched people to investigate-after all, the Willises were meant to become her in-laws.



To her astonishment, the culprit turned out to be none other than her own son, who had personally instructed Beckett to close the venue.



Danica was dumbfounded then, and now, hearing him admit it so calmly, her shock mingled with anger.


"Didn't you already agree to marry Verena? Why,then,are you still striking against the Willis family? Call Beckett this instant. He only listens to you. Tell him to remove the restrictions immediately and let the venue resume its operations."



"Impossible," Isaac rejected without pause. "I agreed to marry Verena for her sake, not for the Willis family.I acted because they bullied her first. Verena is my fiancée, and I will not stand by while she suffers."


His unwavering tone left Danica briefly at a loss for words. "So you're already protecting her to such an extent? Don't forget-even with a few quarrels,Verena is still their daughter, their very flesh and blood. By moving against the Willises now, outsiders will say you don't truly want this marriage, that you're creating excuses deliberately."



Isaac's eyes narrowed, his expression composed and unshaken by her arguments.


"Rest easy. I will not let her suffer. On our wedding day, I'll make sure everyone understands just how much I care for Verena."



His certainty both startled and unsettled Danica.



For the first time, she could see clearly that her son was deeply taken with Verena.



It wasn't his affection that disturbed her, but his disregard for the Bennett family's standing.


Verena,it seemed, was not the pliant woman Danica had imagined.


Unable to contain her anger any longer, Danica snapped, "And what do you expect to accomplish by this? Are you intent on dragging the Bennett family's name through the mud? Before the marriage arrangement, I promised the Willises certain benefits.Now, the wedding hasn't even taken place, the benefits haven't been granted, yet you've already struck at them. What will people say? That the Bennetts are ungrateful?" Danica's true concern was crystal clear-what others thought of the Bennett family. The Willis family's plight was merely secondary.



Isaac knew this better than anyone.



It was that very obsession with appearances that had driven her to arrange his marriage hastily, lest others discover the illnesses he carried beyond his crippoled legs.



His gaze turned cold as he answered slowly, "What others think is theirs to carry. I have no need to live by their judgments. All I know is this-if anyone dares harm the woman I care for, they must face the consequences."



Danica fell silent, stunned into speechlessness.


It was one matter for him to act against the Willises,but to shield Verena with such fierceness was another altogether.



Only then did Danica grasp that she had underestimated her future daughter-in-law. "People say Verena is a country girl, unsophisticated and harmless. Clearly, everyone was mistaken. She has tricks up her sleeve. In such a short time, she's managed to sway you enough to disregard your own family's reputation. It seems Bobby was right after all.I dismissed his words before,but now I see-if she can turn against her own parents, she will no doubt throw this household into chaos once she becomes your wife."



Danica paused,and then declared with iron resolve, "I arranged this marriage to secure a woman who would be compliant, one I could manage easily. Verena is nothing of the sort. Since you've moved against the Willis family, then so be it-we will cancel this marriage."



At that word "cancel," Isaac's head lifted sharply, his dark gaze locking onto hers.



Danica's heart gave a tremor under the weight of his eyes.



Since the accident, lsaac had rarely looked at her directly.



When speaking, he usually kept his gaze lowered,fixed on the ground.



But now-for the first time since that day-he looked at her straight on, and in his eyes burned a storm of anger.

Chapte 59 Danica Requested To Meet Verena
Isaac spoke with a voice as steady as stone. "I agreed to this marriage not for the sake of the Willis family,and certainly not for you. I did it only because it's Verena. Whether in the past or now, no one-not even you-can keep me from marrying her."


Danica's face darkened with anger as she warned coldly,"Do you truly believe I cannot stop you?"



Isaac's composure never faltered. "With your influence, you could end this marriage in a thousand ways. But Mother, if you dare to do so, then from this moment on, I will live without a mother."



His words struck like a hammer. Danica grasped the meaning and felt her heart reel in disbelief.



A storm of anger and astonishment surged within her.She looked down at lsaac, her frown deepening."Would you really cut the bond between us over a woman?"



From where he sat, lsaac heard her voice. His fists clenched and released, yet his tone remained calm. "lt isn't only about Verena. The instant you chose to harm her, you trampled on my feelings. And since you do not care for mine, why should I care for yours?"


Raising his voice, he commanded the butler, "Take me back to my room."


At once, the butler came forward and escorted him into the elevator.



Danica,left behind in the silence of his words, sank heavily onto the sofa. Her mind spun with disorientation.



Since the accident, she had never seen Isaac speak with such force. It was as though the man she once knew before the tragedy had returned.



Her frown deepened; doubt gnawing at her heart.


Was the marriage with the Willis family truly a wise arrangement?



As these troubled thoughts circled, a voice from the stairwell broke her reverie.



"I warned you Verena wasn't decent, but you wouldn't listen.And now look-she's driven my brother to this."Bobby leaned against the railing, arms folded, gazing down at Danica.



Still shaken by her clash with Isaac, Danica snapped,"Enough! Hold your tongue." Bobby gave a mocking scoff, pretending indifference.

"Doesn't matter to me."



With that, he turned and went upstairs.



Yet once alone in his room, Bobby unlocked his phone and fired off a message to "Verena". "Congratulations.You've finally earned my mother's dislike. She no longer agrees to this marriage, so stop dreaming about being Isaac's wife-stop dreaming of becoming Mrs. Bennett."



Though he had heard every word lsaac spoke downstairs, he still sent the message, hoping to unsettle that woman he despised.



He could not fathom how his usually sharp brother had fallen for such a facade.







Fresh from her shower, Kaia noticed the new message on her alternate account.


Her eyes lit with excitement, and pride flickered across her face.



She had done nothing, yet Verena seemed on the verge of being cast aside by the Bennett family.



Now, with the Lyons family backing her and Verena rejected by the Bennetts, Kaia felt her fortunes soaring higher than ever.


Smirking, she lifted her chin with arrogant grace and replied to Bobby, "Whether your mother approves or not doesn't matter, so long as Isaac does."



Reading the reply, Bobby's face darkened.


Her words dripped with arrogance,and yet-he could not deny the bitter truth. If his brother chose to rebel,even their mother could not stop him.







Meanwhile, as Verena prepared the herbal ointment for lsaac, her phone rang.



She glanced at the caller ID, her brows lifting in surprise.



Danica?



During their earlier arranged meeting, under Laura's subtle persuasion, she and Danica had exchanged numbers. But they had never spoken since, and Verena had nearly forgotten she had her contact.



Why was Danica calling now?


Curious, Verena answered with polite warmth. "Hello,Mrs.Bennett. This is Verena. How may I help you?" Before dialing, Danica had steeled herself to speak with severity.


Yet hearing Verena's voice-gentle, courteous,almost smiling-gave her pause.



How could one lash out at such composure?


Suppressing her misgivings, Danica forced a smile. "If it's convenient, let's meet. I'llsend the address."


Verena's brows knitted faintly. The only subject between them was Isaac.



And if Danica sought her alone, it could hardly bode well.



Even so, she had no intention of shrinking away.Rather, she wanted to know Danica's true purpose.


So she answered evenly, "Very well, Mrs. Bennett. I'lL see you soon."



After hanging up, Verena freshened up quickly and left the hotel to hail a cab.


Danica had chosen a stylish café, where soft jazz played and the air felt tranquil.


Once Verena confirmed her name, a server guided her to a reserved window booth. By the time Danica appeared with her assistant,Verena had already finished half her coffee.



Verena rose gracefully, offering a polite nod."Good day, Mrs. Bennett. It's nice to see you again."



In truth, Danica had arrived earlier but lingered outside for twenty minutes, waiting to gauge Verena's patience.



By rumor, a woman of Verena's temperament would have been restless by then.


Yet what greeted her was a composed, courteous young woman, whose manners could not be faulted.



This unexpected poise unsettled Danica, compelling her to look closer.



Verena wore a white wool coat over a soft turtleneck,paired with slim jeans that shaped her figure.



Her subtle makeup brightened her smile, softening her already gentle features. She looked approachable,even disarming


Danica sighed inwardly. Outwardly, Verena looked every bit the perfect daughter-in-law of the Bennett family-except for the suspicion that her heart hid deceit. Casting aside such thoughts, Danica sat and forced a faint smile before asking bluntly, "Did you instruct Isaac to move against the Willis family?"


Move against the Willis family?



Her words confirmed what Verena had guessed



So Isaac had already taken steps.



Was it because of what he had promised her that day?



A warmth stirred in Verena's heart, touched by the knowledge that, memory or not, lsaac had always stood by her whenever she was wronged.



Though he had never spoken of his plans, she could see the reason clearly.



When she told him she had been cast out of her family, Isaac had vowed to handle it for her.


She had not expected him to act so swiftly.
###Chapter 60 What Did My Mother Tell You
Verena never asked Isaac to move against the Willis family, but he only did it for her sake.


For that reason, she offered no denial and gave Danica a small nod. "In a sense, yes."


When Danica pressed her lips together, Verena added with a faint smile, "Still, I doubt you asked me here only to talk about this matter."


Her voice carried a steady calm, revealing her knack for anticipating others' intentions while keeping her emotions firmly in check despite the sudden probing.


This level of composure was exactly what Danica respected most when dealing with people in business.


Danica studied her for a long moment before laughing lightly. "I don't know what kind of dispute exists between you and your family, but since your marriage to Isaac is already certain, have you thought about how others will judge you if he acts against your family? And how they might criticize him?"


Though spoken indirectly, the meaning was clear to Verena. "Are you suggesting I stop him?"she asked Danica inclined her head, looking satisfied. "You're quick to see my point."


In her mind, Verena's words meant agreement,and she assumed Verena would soon persuade Isaac to relent.


Verena lifted her cup, breathed in the coffee's scent,and then set it down again before meeting Danica's eyes with a serene smile. "Thank you for saying that.But the fact you came to me shows you've already argued with lsaac about this. I understand your concerns, yet lsaac is acting for my sake. I would never be ungrateful enough to stand in his way. So I'm afraid I won't stop him."


Danica's expression tightened, doubt clear in her eyes.She suspected Verena was using lofty words as a mask,hiding her real intentionto weaken the Willis family.To her, it was astonishing that someone so young could already be this calculating.


Danica's fingers curled more firmly around the cup handle as she said, "I never expected you to be this stubborn. Keep in mind, if lsaac truly destroys the Willis family, you'll be left with nothing to depend on in Shoildon."



When she finished speaking, Danica searched Verena's expression for a flicker of panic. In her eyes, the Willis family had always been Verena's foundation, both before and after her marriage.


The mention of "depend" drew a hint of amusement from Verena. From the age of seven, she had lived without her parents' affection. Alec and Laura had left her in Shawna's care, offering her only the bare minimum,nothing more.



Her move to ShoiIdon had been for one reason alone,to tie her to the Bennett family. Every word they ever spoke to her revolved around praising Kaia and Luka while pointing out her shortcomings.



Depend? In truth, she had never once known what it meant to rely on her parents.



Verena kept her expression soft and steady, her tone balanced between humility and confidence as she replied, "You're reading too much into it. The Willis family has never been my foundation-neither in the past,nor now, nor in the future. The only support I've ever truly had is myself."



A light laugh slipped from her lips as she added, "No,that isn't entirely true. I have lsaac now as well."



Danica looked at her in open surprise. Sitting tall with her slender back straight, Verena spoke with a calmness and poise that carried quiet conviction,persuasive without the slightest hint of agitation.


During the entire ten minutes they spoke, Verena never once faltered, carrying herself with composed elegance and flawless delivery.



A flicker of surprise passed through Danica as she took in the depth of Verena's character. She had expected Isaac's wife to be pliable and easily managed,someone incapable of exposing his vulnerabilities after marriage. Yet what parent wouldn't feel pride in seeing their son matched with a woman both intelligent and beautiful?



With her feelings tangled, Danica lifted her coffee,drank slowly, let out a quiet sigh, and rose from her seat. "Forget it. I'm old now. There are plenty of matters I'd rather not get involved in. The two of you can manage your own business."


Verena rose as well, giving her a courteous smile."Goodbye, Mrs. Bennett."



While returning to the Bennett Mansion, Danica's assistant kept glancing at her from the front seat,clearly holding back his words.



Noticing his hesitation, Danica said, "Go ahead, say what's on your mind."



Given the opening, the assistant finally spoke his doubts. "Will you truly overlook the Willis family's troubles and allow Miss Willis and Mr. Bennett to act without restraint?" Standing behind Danica in the coffee shop, he had caught every word exchanged between the two ladies.



"Act without restraint?" Danica repeated with a faint smile, her gaze drifting out the window. "Isaac is nothing like Bobby. He never makes a move without certainty. We're only speaking of the Willis family. If neither lsaac nor Verena is concerned, why should I risk discord with my own son over them?"



Business had always been Danica's compass, and she knew well what truly mattered.


Still unsatisfied, the assistant furrowed his brows."Didn't you intend for Miss Willis to stop Mr. Bennett from striking against the Willis family? Why back away now?"



Danica gave him a brief glance before responding,"Do you think I care so little for lsaac? He is my son.I won't damage our relationship for the sake of outsiders. Meeting Verena was only to measure her attitude toward Isaac's actions against the Willis family."



Understanding dawned at last, and the assistant nodded slowly.



That exchange had shifted Danica's perception of Verena entirely. The young woman was neither gullible nor easily swayed, and she was nothing like the ignorant figure painted by rumor. Following his most recent quarrel with Danica, Isaac ordered Jacob to keep watch over her schedule,making sure Verena would not be dragged into anything troublesome. The moment anything unusual occurred, it was to be reported to him at once.



The instant Isaac learned that Danica had scheduled a private meeting with Verena, his gaze sharpened.Without hesitation, he opened his contacts and dialed the first name on the list.


The line rang over and over without response,and by the time he lowered the phone slightly, sweat had already dampened his palm.



Isaac ended the call and immediately tried again,repeating the attempt again and again, only to meet silence each time.



At that same moment, Verena stood in the hotel corridor, searching through her bag for her key when her screen lit up, showing a list of missed calls.



Looking closer, she realized there were eight of them,every single one from lsaac.



Without delay, she pressed to return his call.


Just as Isaac was about to leave the office, with his car waiting below, his phone began to ring.



He stopped his wheelchair at once, grabbed the phone,and asked directly, "What did my mother tell you?"


Verena pushed open her hotel room door, only to hear lsaac's voice come through, carrying a faint edge of anxiety.



After hanging the key on the back of the door, she sat down at the desk, surprised by his tone."You already knew?"


Isaac confirmed it without hesitation before asking her, "What exactly did she say?"



Verena caught the tension in his voice and let a playful smile spread across her face. "You've been that concerned about me? You actually called more than once. Were you planning to show up at the hotel if I didn't pick up?"
###Chapter 61 Going To See Dr. Willis




Verena let out a regretful sigh. "Had I known, I would have ignored the calls, just so you'd come seeing me."



Isaac felt a sharp tingle in his ears at the sound of her soft tone, yet his chest tightened with urgency.He swallowed before saying in a hushed, firm voice,"Verena, I'm asking you something serious."


Realizing his concern was genuine, Verena dropped the teasing and said reassuringly, "Relax, your mother only asked me out for coffee. She didn't make things difficult."


Isaac struggled to accept that Danica would call Verena out without some serious purpose. Her calm words only stirred up a storm of uneasy possibilities in his mind.



He hesitated, and then asked with deliberate seriousness,"Did my mother... tell you to leave me?"

For a split second, Verena stood speechless. It dawned on her that lsaac was probably imagining one of those soap opera scenes where the male lead's mother marched in, tossed a check on the table, and snapped at the female lead, "Take it and stay away from my son!"


She laughed lightly and teased, "Isaac, have you been glued to soap operas lately?"


The easy, genuine laughter spilling from her lips showed Danica hadn't upset her in the slightest.Seeing she was mocking him, lsaac rubbed his eyebrow and mumbled, "I don't watch that stuff."


It was true he never watched such shows,but his nerves often pushed his mind toward unnecessary thoughts.


Verena lowered her gaze with a smile. She hadn't expected Isaac to worry for her this deeply, even without remembering their shared past, and the realization left her quietly content.


Isaac finally exhaled, relieved that his mother hadn't given Verena trouble."By the way," Verena said suddenly, recalling something. "I was wondering if you noticed any changes in that area when you woke up this morning."


The sudden shift in topic left Isaac taken aback for a brief moment.



Realizing she meant his condition, he pressed his lips together before answering simply, "No."


Verena went silent at his reply. With his situation,there should have been at least some small sign after the first use of the herbal ointment. Why was there none at all?



She asked again, "Did you feel even the slightest burning sensation?"


Isaac felt a chill run through him at her careful question.


He answered quietly, "No."


The call fell into silence, and Verena's voice did not come through. The room around him was so still that he could almost hear the pounding of his own heart.


Frustration pressed down on his chest until it was hard to breathe. Clenching his jaw, he blurted out,"When you worked with other patients, did they see results after only one treatment?"


Verena's shoulders sagged as she gave a grave reply."Yes."


She picked up on the sudden quiet on the other end and could tell lsaac was starting to worry, so she chimed in to ease his mind, "You don't need to be anxious. Everyone's body reacts in its own way..."


With near desperation, Isaac asked, "Have you ever had another case with no response at all, the way l am now?"



Verena's brows drew together. The word "yes"hovered on her lips, yet she couldn't bring herself to lie to him.



Tightening her fist, she lowered her voice and said,"No." Isaac said nothing, completely tuned out from whatever Verena was saying on the other end of the line. There wasn't a soul he could turn to. A flood of emotions such as shame, fear, uselessness, and a rising panic twisted through him like thick vines,tightening with every passing second as a bitter taste crept into his mouth.



Isaac lowered his head, the corners of his eyes rimmed with red, tears shining but refusing to fall.Had he been a fool to hope from the very beginning?He had swallowed countless pills, endured needle after needle, even gone under the knife, and still nothing had changed. Maybe he should never have started this endless road of treatment at all.


To him, staying by Verena's side while bound by his condition felt like he was only holding her back.


Isaac lowered his gaze, forced down the tightness in his throat, and quickly said, "Sorry, I've got something to handle. I'll contact you another time."


Verena parted her lips to respond, only to be met with the abrupt busy tone on the line. ···


Inside the Lyons family home...


"Slater, get changed into proper clothes. Put on something formal," Barrie said as he poulled his grandson toward his bedroom.



Slater had managed only two bites of his banana when Barrie snatched it away and threw it aside.


He wrinkled his brow in puzzlement. "Why, Grandpa?Isn't what I'm wearing good enough? Who are we meeting that makes you dress so formally? You're even in a suit."



Ever since his retirement, Barrie had preferred loose,casual wear and rarely bothered with such formal suits.


When Barrie mentioned the meeting two days earlier,he had told Slater only that they would see someone today, but he never revealed who it was.


Seeing Barrie dressed up so seriously and calling for the entire family to join, Slater's curiosity grew  sharper.


Barrie kept tugging at his grandson's clothes as he explained, "We're going to meet your grandfather's lifesaver, Dr.Willis."


"Dr. Willis!" Slater's eyes sparkled, and he asked with excitement, "Why didn't you tell me before? Where is she living? Is she also in Shoildon?"


His excitement rang too loudly, and Barrie gave him a push into the room. "You'll know once we arrive. For now,get yourself ready."


After shutting the door behind Slater, Barrie turned and spotted Fletcher approaching with his wife.


Fletcher was dressed in a dark suit, while Marietta Lyons wore a coordinating outfit that made her look elegant and proper.


Barrie's eyes went to Fletcher as he asked, "ls everything prepared?"


Fletcher gave a confident nod. "Rest assured. Allthe gifts you requested have been arranged exactly as you wanted."


Barrie's face lit with satisfaction as he gave a nod of approval. Turning to the butler, he said, "Call the Willis family and tell them we're on our way."


With a slight nod, the butler said, "Yes." He then turned and walked inside to place the call.


The Lyons family's household was already full of movement, but over at theWillis Villa, the pace was even more relentless.


"Careful there, scrub the corners of that flower bed properly."


"Start on the stair railings-wipe them with a damp cloth first, and then dry them off thoroughly."


"Remove those coffee beans and replace them with the premium batch."


From the living room, Laura's voice echoed as she rattled off one order after another.


Even though the servants had already scrubbed the villa spotless the previous day, Laura demanded it be cleaned all over again.


"Laura." Alec came down the staircase while fussing with his tie. "Come see-how does this outfit look?Do you think the tie is too bold?"


Laura stepped over, fixed his tie with her hands, and smiled. "No, this looks refined. Today's just a private gathering, so there's no need to be overly formal."


Alec grinned in relief at her answer. "Good, good,then I'll wear this."


Laura, brimming with excitement, quickly asked,"And what about my outfit today?"


She stood there in a fine dress draped with an elegant shawl, radiating both affluence and poise.
###Chapter 62 Something They Both Cared About





At Laura's question, Alec broke into a hearty laugh,the creases around his eyes deepening. "You're absolutely dazzling."


When it came to something they both cared about,they looked like newlyweds still wrapped up in the glow of their honeymoon.


Both understood that today marked a turning point for their standing in Shoildon. After all, Barrie's decision to visit their home with his family was no ordinary honor.


Word in Shoildon never stayed secret for long, and they were certain the elite circles would soon buzz with news of this visit.



The butler approached quickly, voice laced with respect. "Mr. Willis, Mrs. Willis, I've just been informed by the Lyons family's butler that Mr. Barrie  Lyons and his household are already on their way."


Excitement flashed in Alec's eyes as he met Laura's gaze, and then motioned to the butler. "Quickly,make sure the refreshments are ready."


A slight furrow appeared on Laura's brow. "I'll see what's keeping Kaia. Why isn't she downstairs yet?"


Alec gave a quick nod. "Yes, bring her down right away."


They couldn't have been prouder of Kaia. Without her talent, a connection with the Lyons family-especially on such favorable terms-would have been unthinkable.


Clicking up the stairs in her heels, Laura's excitement got the better of her, and she pushed open the door without a knock.


"Kaia, why are you still dawvdling? Barrie and his family will be here any minute," Laura exclaimed.


As she approached the vanity, Laura's eyes gleamed with pride at the sight of her daughter.  Kaia wore a pale blue strapless gown draped with a white fur coat, her look both graceful and striking.


"My goodness, you'd outshine anyone no matter what you wore," Laura said warmly as she smoothed Kaia's sleek hair.


Lifting a perfume bottle, Kaia spritzed her wrist and dabbed it behind her ear, a smug smile tugging at her lips. "Mom, people have admired me since I was little. Haven't you gotten used to it by now?"


Laura's eyes shone with satisfaction. "Yes, yes, your beauty is endless. But hurry now. Barrie is an elder,and it wouldn't be right to make him wait."


With her chin tipped upward, Kaia muttered,"Alright."




Still, inside, Kaia dismissed Laura's caution. Elder or not, she had saved Barrie's life. Was there any need to tremble before him?


The man struggled with long-term illnesses, and she had practically pulled him back from the brink. Even if she carried herself with a touch of arrogance, who could fault her? Yet she understood why Laura pressed for humility-their family's position still couldn't measure up.







A sleek black vehicle belonging to the Lyons family eased around the bend and rolled into the driveway of the Willis Villa.



From the entrance of the main house, the Willis butler spotted the vehicle and hurried back inside to deliver the news.



With excitement in his voice, he announced to Alec,"The Lyons' vehicle has just pulled in-our guests are here."



Springing from the sofa, Alec turned to Laura on the sofa and Kaia, who had just stepped down the staircase. "Come on, let's greet Barrie and his family properly. We have to show them respect."


Laura rose to join him, but Kaia walked to the sofa and sat down, smoothing her hair with one hand and resting the other on her lap. "You two go ahead. I'l stay here."


Laura's face showed bewilderment, while Alec assumed Kaia was growing arrogant because of Barrie's regard for her.


With a faint scowl, Alec warned, "Kaia, this won't do.Even if you treated Barrie's leg, you must stilI act with humility before someone older."


Kaia pushed out her lower lip. "That's not what I meant, Dad. I just don't want it to look like I'm desperate to butter up the Lyons family. Go on without me.I'll wait here."


Though Alec felt like continuing the lecture,he cut himself short with the Lyons family at the door."Forget it," he muttered, striding outside with Laura.


Inside the vehicle, as the driver looked for a spot to park, the Lyons family of four carried on a lively conversation.


From the inside pocket of his suit jacket,Fletcher drew out a sleek black-gold card and looked at Barrie, saying, "Dad, I wasn't around when Dr. Willis  treated you, but Slater was inconsiderate and failed to thank her properly. Since we're going in person this time, I intend to do it right."


Slater immediately protested, his eyes flicking to the card. "Inconsiderate? That's unfair, Dad. If you want to thank Dr. Willis, money isn't the way. She's not like the others-she's more like those legendary doctors from novels who couldn't care less about riches.Grandpa once tried to offer her a generous sum. She turned it down, saying she'd been paid her fee and didn't need anything else."
###Chapter 63 Dr. Willis Is Alec's Daughter





Slater let out a dreamy sigh. "If Dr. Willis actually liked me, marrying her would be a good choice to thank her properly."


Laughter erupted from Barrie as he turned to Slater and said, "That's not going to work on me. I'm wise to all your frivolous behavior, you brat. There's no way I'd let Dr. Willis end up upset."


Slater grabbed at his chest with an exaggerated look of pain. "Grandpa, how could you accuse me like that?"


At that moment, the driver pulled the car to a stop and swung open the rear door.


Marietta reached over with a smile, giving Slater a pat as he sat by the door. "That's enough nonsense.Out you go." Slater straightened up and unfolded his long legs as he climbed out. When his eyes landed on the building ahead, a strange familiarity hit him,especially when he spotted the fountain close by.



Assuming his memory hadn't failed him, he was pretty sure he had seen that same spot before in one of Kaia's posts online.


Slater blinked in shock. "What are we doing at the Willis family'shouse?"


Barrie leaned against his cane with a chuckle. "You mean you didn't know? Dr. Willis is Alec Willis'daughter."


Slater froze in astonishment. "Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter?"


The Willis family had two girls. One was Kaia, the one he was familiar with.



The other was Verena, who had only just come back from the countryside.


Since he already knew Kaia, that left only one possibility...


Hold on a second!


Could the eldest daughter of the Willis family, the one who had come back from the countryside,actually be Dr.Willis?


Slater's mind spun in a storm of disbelief,overflowing with exclamation marks and question marks.


If Dr. Willis truly turned out to be Verena,then he had already badmouthed her more than once behind her back.


Impossible! Anyone who had spoken ill of Verena must have been spreading lies.


Slater resolved on the spot that he had to apologize to Dr. Willis without delay.


"Mr. Lyons, at last you've arrived." A lively male voice cut into Slater's thoughts, and when he lifted his head, Alec and Laura were already waiting near the car."You're looking as strong and spirited as ever, Mr.Lyons," Alec said to Barrie with a broad smile.


Barrie chuckled in good humor. "That's kind of you,but I'm getting on in years-I can't go anywhere without this cane."


Fletcher stepped forward, offering his hand. "Mr.Willis, I've heard a great deal about you."


A spark of surprise flashed in Alec's eyes-this was the CEO of the renowned Avalon Group, a man he seldom had the chance to meet. Yet today, Fletcher was greeting him with such warmth.


Alec clasped his hand without hesitation. "I've long wanted to meet you, Mr. Lyons. It's truly a pleasure to at last."



Laura reached for Marietta's hand with familiar warmth, speaking as though they were longtime acquaintances. "So the final scarf from S&F found its way to you, Mrs. Lyons. It suits your delicate skin beautifully. I'm glad it wasn't mine-it would have been wasted on me." This was Marietta's first time meeting Laura, and she thought her manner a touch excessive.


Even so, because Laura was the mother of the doctor who had saved Barrie, Marietta let the familiarity pass without complaint.


With a pleasant smile, she answered, "I actually own another scarf just like this one. If it pleases you, Mrs.Willis, I'll have it sent over."


Laura gave no clear response but shifted the subject toward Slater instead. "Slater really is impressive. It's no wonder the girls in Shoildon admire him so much."


Caught off guard by the mention, Slater cast Laura a conflicted glance. If Dr. Willis ever learned the things he'd said about her, the shame would be unbearable.


He came to a firm conclusion that he needed to apologize before she learned the truth on her own.Lost in thought, Slater gave a half-hearted greeting to Laura and said, "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Willis."


Slater kept stretching his neck, trying to get a glimpse into the house, and Alec caught on right away. With a teasing grin, he said, "Slater, looks like you're pretty eager to catch sight of my daughter,aren't you?"


A faint flush crept over Slater's cheeks as he rubbed the back of his head. "I guess I am a little eager."


Naturally, his nerves were high-after all, he had spoken poorly of Verena more than once, and the weight of guilt pushed him to hurry with an apology.


Watching the young man's flustered behavior, Alec gave a satisfied nod.


Inside, Laura was thrilled, convinced that Slater's blush was proof of affection for Kaia.


He might not hold the same brilliance as the Bennett brothers, yet the Lyons family's influence in Shoildon could not be questioned.


Should Kaia marry Slater, his straightforward personality would ensure he remained completely under her sway.


And with Kaia credited for Barrie's recovery, the Willis family's standing in Shoildon would be unshakable.


Holding back her rising joy, Laura said brightly,"Enough waiting outside, let's head in."


The moment the words left her mouth, Slater bolted straight inside.


Pointing at Slater's back, Barrie murmured,"That boy never knows how to slow down."


Alec, aware of Slater's eagerness to see Kaia,chuckled and said, "He's still young-recklessness suits him."


Inside the house, Slater spotted Kaia seated quietly on the sofa.


Kaia's eyes caught his; she smiled softly and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.


Instead of greeting her, Slater began pacing about,stretching his neck as though hunting for someone.


Puzzled, Kaia's brows furrowed as she asked,"Slater, what are you trying to find?" He shot her a quick look but kept silent, still scanning the room.


His indifference deepened Kaia's frown, a trace of irritation flickering in her gaze.


This time, her voice sharpened as she repeated, "Tell me, what exactly are you searching for?"


Finally stopping, Slater turned to her and asked directly, "Where is your elder sister?"


Verena?


A flicker of disdain crossed Kaia's expression before she smoothed it over.


Sitting upright, she replied with a sharp edge, "She isn't home."


Confusion clouded Slater's face as his brows drew tight. "Not home? What reason would she have to be away?"


Watching his obvious concern at the mention of Verena, Kaia's irritation flared, and she snapped,"She's hardly that important. Why should it matter whether she's here or not?"


Slater's tone sharpened as his voice rose. "Of course it matters. The reason we came here today was to meet your sister. How could you say she isn't important?"


His words echoed across the living room, reaching Barrie, who was just stepping through the doorway.


With two firm taps of his cane, Barrie's stern voice cut through the air. "Slater, lower your voice. Where are your manners?"


Slater cast a frustrated glance at Kaia before leaning close to Barrie and whispering, "Grandpa, Dr. Willis isn't here."



Dr. Willis? Alec and Laura, standing near Barrie,caught the words clearly.


A sharp pang of unease struck Alec the moment he heard it.



Laura, on the other hand, brushed it off and beckoned Kaia to her side. Pulling her daughter close, Laura smiled warmly at Slater. "You really do spoil my Kaia. She's still in medical school, not yet a doctor. But she's bright and skilled, and if your grandfather ever needs medical help,you can count on her."

###Chapter 64 A Misunderstanding




Kaia had basked in praise all her life, yet today's compliment struck her heart like a long-awaited triumph.


It felt sweeter than all the others, a mixture of joy and relief, as though she had finally found a steadfast ally in Barrie. She even wondered if those rich ladies who once looked down on her for her modest background would still dare to sneer.


Her heart fluttered, but on the surface she wore calm composure.


Stepping forward with a gentle smile and a well-mannered tone, Kaia addressed Barrie.


"Indeed, Mr. Lyons. I heard before about your serious leg ailment. Had I known earlier that the herbs and supplements I prepared could help, I would never have waited until your son and daughter-in-law's wedding anniversary to send them. I would have delivered them right away, sparing you so much pain."




Her lips curved gracefully, yet she remained unaware of the strange looks exchanged among the Lyons family at her words.


Barrie's brows drew together, his gaze shadowed with regret.


Like fire erupting from a mountain, Slater burst out."Herbs and supplements? What are you talking about? My grandfather's leg was healed through Dr.Willis' careful treatment, step by step. Stop dressing yourself in borrowed robes! Those so-called herbs and supplements you speak of were passed on to the servants the very night they arrived."


He paused, and then shot Kaia a scornful glance."So you really believed it was you who cured my grandfather's leg?"


The mockery was sharp, and the Willis family's faces turned ashen, drained of color.


The truth was plain: Kaia had not cured Barrie. It was nothing more than a misunderstanding.


The Willis family had clung to the false notion that a few boxes of herbs and supplements could undo decades of suffering. They had mistaken wishful thinking for reality.


Alec looked at Kaia with a heavy expression, the weight of disappointment clear in his eyes.


Kaia herself stood pale and shaken, disbelief flickering across her face.


Her brows trembled as she recalled the sight of Verena at Barrie's residence that evening.


Could it be that Verena was the very Dr. Willis they now spoke of? The healer who had restored Barrie?


Kaia's heart resisted the thought. To her, Verena had only learned a few skills from a self-taught practitioner in the backwater place.


Yet reality pressed in-uncomfortable, undeniable.They shared the same surname, and Verena had indeed been at the Lyons home that evening. The thought made Kaia's chest tighten; her hands clenched so hard that her nails cut into her palms.


If Verena truly was the one who healed Barrie,Kaia resolved to bury it deep.


Even if she had to swallow her pride and shoulder the blame herself, she would never allow the Lyons family to find out Verena was the Dr. Willis they spoke of.That, she decided, was a price worth paying.


Biting down hard on the inside of her cheek, Kaia forced herself to bow before Barrie.


Her voice trembled wvith contrition. "Mr. Lyons, I truly apologize. After I sent the gifts, I saw Slater's post online and mistakenly believed I had been the one to cure your leg. It was my mistake, and I am deeply sorry."


From their exchange, Barrie pieced together the truth.




Though disappointment touched him, his good manners kept his face composed. He gave Kaia a measured glance but withheld any reply. Instead, he sighed softly and turned to Alec."Mr. Willis, since Dr. Willis isn't here, let's not trouble you further."


Then, signaling to Fletcher and the others, he added,"Let's head home."


Embarrassment weighed heavily on Alec, but he still had one matter he dared not leave unspoken.


With a forced smile, he followed and said, "Mr. Lyons,about the club..."


Barrie, without turning, raised his hand in dismissal."Mr. Willis, not today. There's no need to see us out."






The ride home was cloaked in silence.


Slater leaned his arm against the window, his brows drawn as he wrestled with his thoughts about Dr.Willis' whereabouts. He hadn't seen her since she completed the final treatment for his grandfather.


He had hoped to thank her face-to-face, but today's visit had been fruitless. Her phone was disconnected, the number invalid.


Oddly enough, he felt a trace of relief that the Willis family had mistaken Kaia for the healer. At least that proved Dr. Willis wasn't one of them-just a woman who happened to share the surname.


And since Bobby's influence had long soured his opinion of the Willis family, Slater found comfort in that fact.


Fortunately, Dr. Willis had no ties to them at all.
###Chapter 65 Seeing Isaac





Inside the Willis Villa, the family gathered in the living room.


On the couch, Alec, Laura, and Kaia sat in tense silence, shame and irritation plain on their faces.


What had begun as a hopeful plan had collapsed into disaster. The problem of the club remained unsolved,and worse, they had made a fool of themselves in front of the Lyons family.


The more Alec dwelled on it, the harder it became to restrain his temper.


His gaze fixed on Kaia, stripped of the warmth it once carried.


"Do you see what mess you've caused? You rushed in without knowing the truth and snatched the credit for yourself. A little praise has gone to your head, and now you believe you're brilliant, don't you? Did you really think a handful of herbs and supplements would heal Barrie's leg? How unfortunate that I have such a stupid daughter."


Running a hand through his hair, Alec let out a sharp breath before saying firmly, "This won't work. We must bring Verena back at once-she's the only one who can fix this. Laura, tomorrow you'll apologize to her properly and make peace with her."


Laura's face darkened at his demand. The memory of her last humiliating apology was still raw, and she had no desire to suffer through it again.


Unable to stomach Kaia's humiliation, Laura snapped back, her voice laced with sarcasm. "You never fail to strike when the timing hurts most, Alec. What kind of father tears down his own daughter like this? You were the one praising Kaia's wit before, and now you turn against her. None of us could have foreseen this outcome. She only wanted to help you,even if she was reckless about it. You claim she isn't clever-are you saying Verena is any better? They're both your children, so if blame is handed out, it should fall on both. At least Kaia doesn't drag trouble into this house." 
Laura let out a bitter laugh and added sharply, "And donn't forget the reason the entertainment venue was closed in the first place. That's on Verena, the one who grew up in the rural backwater under your mother's care."



The moment Verena's name was spoken, Alec froze as a sudden idea surfaced.


He realized then why Barrie had confused Kaia with the doctor who treated his leg-the physician carried the same last name, Willis.


Back in the countryside, Verena had actually practiced medicine.


A startling possibility formed in Alec's mind.


For a few moments, Alec said nothing, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. Finally, he turned to Laura and asked, "Could it be that the doctor Barrie spoke of was Verena?"



The question caught Laura off guard, and her expression  faltered with shock. After a pause, she murmured, "That would be too much of a coincidence, wouldn't it? Are you saying Verena might have that kind of ability?"


The couple looked at each other, uncertainty weighing heavily in their eyes, while Kaia sat frozen,staring at them without blinking.


Kaia couldn't shake the sting of Alec's harsh words as they echoed again in her head.


She balled her fists,and the bitterness in her eyes revealed just how deeply her resentment ran.


As Alec and Laura spoke, a sobering truth dawned on her.


She understood then that her ambitions would only come to life if she carved her own path.


In Laura's eyes, her worth lay only in how much honor she could bring to the Willis name.


No matter the gentle tone or the outward kindness,when it truly mattered, Laura always placed Luka above Kaia.



She k<new the family fortune was destined to end up under Luka's control.


Alec measured his children by usefulness alone,giving approval only to the one who could profit him most.



When she pictured Verena marrying into the Bennett family, jealousy burned hot inside her chest.


It was for that reason she couldn't stomach the idea of Verena living happily.


What she feared most was being branded the most worthless member of the family.


Her cheeks quivered as she forced a smile, and then she turned to Alec and Laura. "Dad, Mom,really?Verena never even made it into college. Everything she knows comes from tagging along with some backwoods healer in the countryside. Even top specialists failed with Mr. Lyons' leg. If I couldn't treat him, then Verena definitely couldn't either."


Laura, who had wavered a moment ago, quickly found comfort in Kaia's reasoning. "Kaia's right.Verena doesn't have that kind of talent. She never studied in college, and she's never even touched proper medical training. At best, she knows how to treat a cold. The name Willis is too common; it could be anyone else. You're just clutching at straws, Alec."


She shot him a sharp glance, her tone cutting.


Nothing seemed more ridiculous than thinking Verena was the doctor responsible for Barrie's recovery. Her bragging about being a Pine Hill University graduate was just as laughable.







Once he got home, Slater immediately picked up the phone, eager to unload the day's fiasco on Bobby.


"You won't believe what a ridiculous thing happened today, Bobby. Can you even guess?"


His voice rose with energy. "We went to meet Dr.Willis. But when I got there, I realized it was Kaia's family. For a moment, I thought, wait-could this Dr.Willis actually be that Verena Willis I've never met?And then you won't believe what followed." At the sound of Verena's name, Bobby leaned in,eager. "So what happened?"


With a chuckle, Slater shook his head. "Verena wasn't there, but Kaia was. The funniest part? She actually convinced herself she cured my grandfather's leg. As if! Dr. Willis has nothing to do with their family, let alone being Verena. They thought Kaia was the doctor. Can you believe that?It's laughable."


Kaia's name didn't hold Bobby's attention, so he brushed right past it.


He smirked at Slater. "You can't be serious. How could anyone even compare my perfect sister-in-law with that sharp-tongued Verena? Come on, they're nothing alike. No way Dr. Willis is her."


At that very moment, Verena-the one they were talking about-sat at the desk in her hotel room.


Piles of paperwork lay before her, most of it business carried over from abroad.

 
When the last page was in order, she rolled her neck, flexed her wrists, and glanced at the time on her phone.


It struck her then that lsaac hadn't reached out since their last conversation, and each time she tried calling, his assistant had picked up instead.


Their most recent talk about his health still lingered in her mind; his tone had been heavy, as if weighed down by feelings he couldn't voice.


She wondered if he had slipped back into overthinking everything.


The decision came quickly-she had to go see him in person.


Acting on impulse, Verena swapped into fresh clothes, took her keycard, and headed down to the hotel's underground garage.


Waiting for her in the dim lot was her newly bought silver-gray car.


She slid behind the wheel and drove straight toward the Bennett Mansion. 
When she arrived at the mansion, she parked stepped out, and walked up to the front gates.


Andres Cruz, the Bennett butler, appeared from inside and asked with courtesy, "Miss, may I ask who you're here to visit?"


She greeted him with a calm smile. "My name is Verena Willis. I've come to see lsaac."



The mention of her name made Andres pause, his eyes narrowing as he studied her carefully.


What he saw was a young woman whose gaze carried warmth and quiet composure.


The poise in her manner, coupled with her quiet elegance, clashed sharply with the cold and selfish reputation the rumors had spread.


Years of experience told Andres right away that such rumors about her were nothing more than empty talk.
###Chapter 66 Committed Myself To You





Andres smiled at Verena. "Please allow me to go in and announce your arrival, Miss Willis."


Verena gave a slight nod. "I appreciate your help."


Andres turned, entered the house, and went upstairs,halting before lsaac's door.


He knocked twice-silence answered.


He knocked again, yet the room remained still.


Just as he raised his hand to try once more, a voice,cold as steel in winter, cut through the silence. "Who is it?"



The words were few, but the chill in them pierced like ice.


Andres instantly sensed Isaac's fou mood.


With due respect, Andres answered, "Mr. Bennett,Miss Verena Willis is here to see you. She's at the gates. Shall I invite her in?"


Verena?



She was at the gates?


Isaac's head, which had been bowed low, suddenly lifted, his gaze locking on the closed door before him.


He had spent the whole day in that room, doing nothing but staring at his crippled state.


When Verena's name was mentioned, his heart thundered, and then clenched painfully as if gripped by an unseen fist.


At that moment, he understood his feelings with painful clarity.


He liked Verena-and he knew she felt something for him,too.


Yet he also knew that no emotion ever sprang up without roots.



He admired her character, treasured the way shetreated him differently from how others did to him.


He liked her gentle, intelligent manner, the kind that drew admiration wherever she went.



But what about him? What reason could she possibly have to love him?


He was a man bound to the wheelchair,shackled by personal challenges. What could she see in him besides his name and background?


It wasn't that lsaac lacked self-respect; it was that her sudden affection felt too abrupt, too fragile.


If his legs could ever be healed, he would not mind her initial intentions.


But that hope was a distant star-barely within sight.


What right did he have to expect Verena to stay with him for a lifetime?


The weight on his chest felt like a millstone,suffocating him with every breath.


He lowered his head again, eyes shimmering faintly,  his throat swollen with unshed words, each one painful to release. "Tell her I'm already asleep."


Andres caught the strange note in lsaac's voice.Though he longed to persuade him, experience told him not to meddle.


So he simply nodded. "Got it, Mr. Bennett. I'll inform Miss Willis right away."


As Andres' footsteps retreated, Isaac closed his eyes, battling the storm of bitterness within.


His hands, resting on his useless legs, slowly curled into fists.



They trembled under the strain, veins rising against the skin.



After a long struggle, he resisted the burning urge to call Andres back and let Verena in.


Before Andres could head downstairs with the message, Bobby appeared and blocked his way.


Andres turned, puzzled. "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?" Moments earlier, Bobby had been on the phone with Slater. Heading for water, he had spotted Andres outside his brother's door.


He had approached, overheard their exchange, and quickly muttered to Slater, "Something urgent has come up-we'll talk later."


He had cut the line without waiting for an answer.


Stopping Andres, Bobby threw a glance at lsaac's firmly closed door before asking quietly, "Is Verena outside?"



Although uncertain why Bobby brought her up,Andres nodded honestly. "Yes, she is."


Bobby broke into a sly grin. So Isaac had finally seen Verena's true colors.



"My brother's clearly awake, yet he tells you to say he's asleep. Do you know what that means? It means he's tired of her and doesn't wish to see her. Unless absolutely necessary, he won't even give her the time of day. That's why he made up an excuse to avoid her." Wearing mock regret, Bobby leaned closer and whispered, "Just go to the gates and tell V/erena straight out that my brother doesn't want to see her,and she should leave."



Andres frowned. Something about Bobby's reasoning felt wrong.


He hesitated. "Mr. Bennett, isn't that a little improper?"


"What's improper about it?" Bobby clicked his tongue. "Andres, you're old enough to know when to adapt."


Seeing Andres still uneasy, Bobby thumped his chest confidently. "Just do as I say. If anything comes of it,I'll take responsibility."


Andres finally yielded. "Alright. I'll follow your instructions, Mr. Bennett."


As Andres walked downstairs, Bobby whistled lightly and strolled back into his room.


Outside, Andres bowed slightly and, as Bobby had ordered, told Verena, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis. Mr.Bennett said he doesn't want to see you. Please leave."



Verena's eyes narrowed. She didn't believe Isaac had uttered those words.


Then again... perhaps he had. Isaac was not one to speak harshly, but in a moment of despair, he might say those words to turn her away.


She remembered the hoarseness in his voice that day on the phone, and a sharp sting pricked her nose.


Blinking, she steadied herself and looked at Andres."Forgive me, but I must intrude."


She slipped past him and dashed into the house.


As she passed, Andres heard her murmur, "I want to hear lsaac say it himself."


Still stunned, Andres watched her pause midway and ask, "By the way, which room is Isaac's?"


Faced with her resolve, he recalled Isaac's strained tone and pointed upstairs. "The room at the far left on the second floor."



Verena smiled gratefully. "Thank you."


She hurried upstairs and found the room.


Knocking firmly, she called, "Isaac, open the door!"


Inside, Isaac's spine went rigid, but he made no move, thinking his ears deceived him.



"I'm Verena, Isaac. Open the door." Her voice was muffled by the heavy wood, but it carried through.


Slowly, Isaac lifted his head, eyes fixed on the sliver of light beneath the door, as if confirming reality.


His room was dark, and the faint glow outside cast a small shadow.


Verena was truly there.


She was at his door.


Isaac dropped his gaze again and said nothing.


Verena, realizing his deliberate stillness, spoke firmly. "lsaac, have you forgotten everything we talked about? Just because you face difficulties, you retreat? You think by shutting me out, I'll simply give up?"


Isaac's eyes stayed locked on the faint shadow beneath the door. He longed to tell her to leave,yet his throat closed with emotion.


Before her, he could not summon a single harsh word.




Verena stood before the sealed door, her gaze steady, her tone unwavering.


"Listen to me, Isaac. I've already committed myself to you. If you won't open this door, then I'll wait right here.I can outlast you, no matter how long it takes."
###Chapter 67 Do You Truly Have The Heart To Wound Me





Committed herself to him...


When lsaac heard those words, his heart tightened suddenly, a sharp pang cutting through his chest as though something inside was being torn apart.


He remembered Verena once telling him, "You're the only one I choose."


Wherever, whenever-she had always given him a clear, unwavering answer, with the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.


Verena was braver than him, carrying a courage he could only admire from a distance.


Isaac's fingers curled slightly, his Adam's apple rising and falling as he swallowed the bitterness that pressed at his heart.


With a faint push, he rolled his wheelchair forward.  Verena caught the sound of wheels moving and knew at once that Isaac was coming to open the door.



She let out a small sigh of relief.


Click!



The door swung open from within.



"Isaac,you-"


"You should leave now." Isaac cut her words short before they could fully form.



Frowning, Verena lowered her gaze to him.


There he sat, in his wheelchair, hands gripping the wheels, head bowed, his back slightly hunched.


Loneliness and desolation clung to him like a shadow.



Staring at his lowered head, Verena spoke with quiet firmness. "If you've got something to say, then look me in the eye when you say it."



Isaac's hands tightened on his lifeless legs. With visible effort, he raised his heavy eyelids. The door stood open, letting the light from the hallway spill in, faintly brightening the darkened room.


At the doorway, Verena stood outlined in that light,her hair shimmering as strands caught a golden glow.


She looked radiant, like the sun breaking through on a winter morning-so dazzling that lsaac longed to draw near and hold on.


His Adam's apple moved again. Forcing calm into his tone, he spoke softly. "Yes, I am retreating. As you said, my condition has made me timid. But the reason I chose to let you go... is because I've come to realize many things."


Verena pressed on, her voice steady, "And what things are those?"


Meeting her gaze, Isaac deliberately said in a distant tone, "You know I'm crippled, unable to father a child. Yet you still insist on marrying me, on loving me. Isn't it because of my family background and power?" With those words, he lost the courage to keep looking at her. He deliberately turned his wheelchair away.


He expected her anger-expected her to flare up, to lash out at such a cruel accusation. But silence followed instead.



Isaac wondered, was she too furious to even speak?


Of course. What girl wouldn't be offended when accused of such motives?


His jaw tightened, a suffocating ache spreading in his chest, as though the very air threatened to choke him.


In truth, he wanted to tell her he loved her, regardless of her intentions.


But deep down, he felt he did not deserve her.


Hearing his words, Verena chuckled lightly, her understanding of him sharp enough to pierce straight through his disguise.


She could tell in an instant when his words were  deliberate, not genuine.


Smiling faintly, she said, "You're saying all this just to provoke me, hoping I'll walk away without looking back, and never reach out to you again, isn't that right?"


Isaac froze, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.After all those words, wasn't she supposed to be furious?



Why...was she smiling instead?


She stepped closer with light movements, stopping behind him.



Then she wrapped her arms around his neck,bending down to embrace him.


"Your words cut deep, Isaac. But tell me-are you really willing to let it end like this?"


Her lips nearly brushed his ear, her voice low, tender,yet deliberately stirring. "Do you truly have the heart to wound me, to drive me away, let me belong to someone else-hold another man, kiss him, and be with him as I am with you?"


Her hand glided to his face, fingertips grazing his skin before lingering on his burning earlobe.


Her voice was gentle, yet her words carried the sting of a blade wrapped in silk, slicing him little by little.


Isaac's breath hitched. Each word weighed on him like chains.


Did he have the heart to do such a thing?


No...he did not.



Even the thought alone was enough to drive him to madness.



Verena tilted her head, watching his jaw tremble, his eyes rimmed in red.


Through his lashes, his dark eyes shone with wetness-like he had been holding back tears.


Her heart trembled at the sight, and she tightened her hold on him, her voice now soothing as a lullaby."Then let go of these needless fears, Isaac.Please?"  Her lingering voice brushed against his ear, sending warmth coursing into his once-cold limbs.


Being held so tightly from behind-this was a feeling he had never known before.


And though a trace of the night chill still clung to Verena,Isaac felt warmer than ever.


It was as if his restless heart, long wandering,had finally found a harbor where it could rest. 
###Chapter 68 Shackles





Isaac longed to nod and agree with Verena, to promise her that he would try to let go of his fears.


Yet deep down, he knew such a promise was a lie he could never keep.



His worries were not idle fancies-they were storms that lived within him.



His life had veered off course in that single heartbeat of the car accident.


Even now, he could still see it clearly: his father lying in a pool of blood, that dreadful sight engraved in his mind like a scar carved in stone.



His father had shielded him, and before darkness swallowed him, lsaac heard the frantic cries of strangers.



"This young man's legs are bleeding heavily!" "If the ambulance doesn't come soon, he'll lose both legs!"


"Forget the legs-if he survives, it will be a miracle."


"How pitiful!"


The voices grew faint as lsaac sank into unconsciousness.


When his eyes opened again, an entire month had slipped away.


He woke beneath a stark white ceiling, the pungent sting of disinfectant filling his lungs, his dizzy head throbbing in protest.


His lips were parched, the corner of his mouth cracked and raw. He moistened them with his tongue, intending to rise from bed for a sip of water.


But as he threw aside the covers, a chilling realization struck-his legs refused to obey.


Frowning, he pushed himself up with his arms,summoning every ounce of upper body strength to move. The bandages around his head were blotched with blood, and sweat trickled down his jawline as his trembling arms bore the strain.


Still, his legs lay motionless, as though they had been erased from his body.


At that moment, Isaac sensed the cruel truth, though his heart refused to accept it.


Clutching the edge of the bed, he tried to roll off. But after lying still for a month, his body was too frail.He collapsed to the floor, knocking over the glass of water on the nightstand.


The glass shattered, and his palms pressed into the shards. Crimson spread across the pale floor in an instant.



The sight tore open an old wound-his father's bloodied face on that fateful day.


Isaac choked back a sob, not from the sting in his hands, but from the lifeless weight of his legs.


His face drained of color, sweat soaking his hospital gown.


The most terrifying part was this: all his strength had been spent simply getting out of bed, and now he could not move at all.


Blood streamed from his palms, yet his lower body lay unresponsive, a dead weight.


For the first time in his life, Isaac tasted the bitter truth of helplessness.


"Mr. Bennett!" The door flew open, and a young man in a caregiver's uniform froze in shock.


He quickly set down the basin of water he carried and rushed to lsaac's side.


Danica had hired him as Isaac's private caregiver. He had only stepped out for a moment, never imagining disaster would strike in those few minutes.


He pressed the call button and struggled to lift Isaac back onto the bed.


Moments later, a doctor strode in, followed by two nurses. "Mr.Bennett, you're finally awake," the doctor said with a relieved smile.


The nurses worked quietly, tending to his wounds and wrapping his hands in bandages.


Isaac leaned against the headboard, jaw clenched.


He closed his eyes halfway and asked in a hoarse voice, "Doctor, how long until my legs recover?"


"Well..." The doctor hesitated, regret darkening his face. At last, he sighed. "At present, it's unlikely they will recover."


Isaac's chest heaved, emotions surging like a storm.His eyes snapped open. "What did you say?"


The doctor lowered his head, his compassion plain.


Isaac stared blankly, unable to move, unable to breathe. At last he muttered, "I want surgery. Do the surgery...please, do it."


"Mr.Bennett, the surgery was performed a month ago. Your legs are in the best state they can be." "I want surgery! Do the surgery again!"


Deaf to reason, Isaac flung back the covers,attempting to rise.


"Hold him down! Quickly!" the doctor barked.


The two nurses and the caregiver pinned Isaac back to the bed.



"Isaac!" Danica burst into the room, breathless from rushing over. Seeing her son restrained, she turned to the doctor in alarm. "Dr. Loftus, what's happening?"


Alick Loftus pursed his lips, answering gravely, "Mr.Bennett has just woken up. He cannot accept his condition and is emotionally unstable. Please, Mrs.Bennett, talk to him."


Danica nodded, her voice soft but firm. "I understand. Thank you."


With her consent, the doctor signaled the others,and they quietly left the room.


Now only mother and son remained. "Isaac, you're finally awake."


Danica stepped forward, stroking his hollowed cheeks. Her nose reddened, tears brimming.


Isaac turned his bloodshot eyes toward her, his voice broken."Mom...I want surgery."


He was pleading like a child. Danica's heart twisted,but she forced herself to speak the truth. "Isaac, the doctors operated the day of your accident. But the nerves in your legs were too severely damaged...This is already the best they can be."


"No. My legs will recover. I want surgery. I want surgery." His words spilled out like a chant, as though repeating them could rewrite fate.


"Isaac, calm down first."


"My legs will get better. My legs will get better." He tried to get up again, his body trembling, his voice unrelenting. Danica reached to hold him back, but he pushed against her.


"My legs will get better. My legs will..." Smack! The sharp crack of a slap rang through the air.





Danica drew in a deep breath, raising her voice to break through his delusion.


"They will not recover. Dr. Loftus is the most trusted doctor in this field. The fact that your legs weren't amputated is already a blessing. You'll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair."


Boom! Isaac's mind went blank, his heart collapsing into silence.



In that instant, he tasted despair as bitter as gall.


"And what about Dad?" The question slipped from his lips-the question he had feared since waking.


Danica's face faltered, grief and resentment flickering in her eyes.


At once, Isaac understood.


He sank back onto the bed, his gaze empty, staring at the ceiling as though carved from stone. 
The room fell still, silence weighing heavier than words.





Danica's heart trembled at the hollow look in his eyes. Panic clawed at her-had her words broken him completely?


Regret surged through her chest. She softened her tone, whispering, "Isaac, if the doctors here can't help, we'll seek treatment abroad. There may still be hope."


Isaac shut his eyes, retreating from memories too heavy to bear.


For six long months, the greatest doctors had failed him.



Each time, he clung to the hope of a miracle, only to have it shatter in his hands.



He dreaded the thought of Verena in aother man's arms, yet he lacked the courage to gamble on chance.



She had told him she was seventy percent certain of success.


But what of the other thirty percent-failure, ruin,despair?




She had healed two others with similar impotence,yet unlike them, lsaac's body betrayed no sign of progress.


Those twin burdens-his crippled legs and impotence-clung to him like shackles, binding him to despair.
###Chapter 69 Familiar Profile





Isaac felt crushed under the tangle of emotions inside him, the pressure on his chest stealing the air from his lungs.


His hand lifted slowly, fingers curling around Verena's wrist as he spoke in a low voice."Verena,I need time. My life isn't like other men's. I'm crippled,and worse, I can't even give you what a husband should. I don't know what my future holds. If I never recover, asking you to stay with me would be selfish."


He understood it wasn't only unfair-it was dangerous. The deeper their bond grew, the harder it would be for him to walk away later compared to now.


Verena caught on to his meaning at once. Memories of her work in the operating room filled her mind-every surgery began with patients or their families signing consent forms, documents filled with warnings of potential risks.Even when the procedure was simple, people would dismiss it lightly, insisting it was only routine, that nothing would go wrong.Yet deep down, no one was ever truly calm. Faced with the list of dangers,families always imagined the worst. Nobody wanted to be the unlucky one, the tragic exception.


No one else could ever feel the same dread or grief for the patients and their families. To outsiders,surgery appeared ordinary. A person went in, came out in one piece, and life moved along as if nothing had happened. But until it was their turn, no one really knew what that fear felt like.


And Isaac's situation wasn't routine at all-every specialist had told him he couldn't be cured.Expecting him to believe in her felt like asking too much,especially since even she wasn't fully certain.


A sigh slipped from her lips as she sank to her knees beside him, her eyes locked on his with quiet determination. "Isaac, I'll wait. But I need you to let me try. I'll give everything I have to treat you. Until the day I admit defeat, don't speak of leaving me.Those words cut too deeply." Her fingers tightened tenderly around his hand. In a hushed tone, she asked, "Do you honestly want to see me hurt like that?"


When Isaac lowered his gaze, he met her clear,unwavering eyes-gentle yet unyielding in their stubborn resolve.



It struck him then that he was powerless against her;the smallest glimpse of vulnerability from Verena shattered all his resistance.


His mouth opened as if to speak, but no words came,leaving him in silence.







Instead of heading back to her hotel after leaving the Bennett Mansion, Verena steered herself toward a bar.


Sliding onto a stool at the counter, she ordered herself a drink.



The liquor scorched her throat, yet her thoughts lingered only on lsaac's wordless face, the memory pressing on her like a stone.


Shoildon's most popular bar surrounded her,boasting the best sound equipment and state-of-the-art lights.


Thunderous metal beats rattled the walls as streaks of dim neon washed over the crowd.


On the pulsing dance floor, beautiful men and women moved with wild energy, fueling the electric atmosphere.


Weighed down by family troubles, Kaia chose to blow off steam by going out with her friends.


Once she'd danced with a string of men and worked up a sweat, she waved her friends off and sank into a seat with a drink in hand.


While tipping her glass back, her eyes drifted toward the counter across the room.


Her eyes narrowed as she spotted a familiar figure-Verena.



Was she alone? A sly smile curved Kaia's lips. With Verena here, she had the perfect outlet for the grudges from home.


Clutching her drink, Kaia started toward the counter with deliberate steps.


Halfway across, she caught sight of a man slipping onto the stool next to Verena.



Kaia halted, folding her arms with a smirk, eager to see what scene would play out.


Perched on her high stool, Verena drained the rest of her glass in a single gulp, coughing as the burn clawed at her throat.



"So it is you, Verena." A warm, clear voice sounded from the seat next to her.



When she turned her head, she found Gavin, sharp-featured and smiling faintly, seated beside her. She frowned. "Gavin, you came here too?"


Gavin poured more liquor into her glass and teased lightly, "What's wrong? Only you get the right to drink your troubles away?" At his words, Verena let out a small laugh. "Then tell me, what are your troubles?"


Instead of answering, Gavin angled his face away,frustration written across his expression, refusing to speak.


Watching him clam up, Verena had little trouble figuring it out. Gavin had wealth, success, and family behind him, so what else could drag him to a bar but heartbreak?


Remembering the reason for his return, Verena ventured a guess. "She hasn't answered you, has she?"


Gavin hesitated, and then gave a short, dismissive scoff. "Close enough."


Shifting the focus, he asked, "What about you?Who's got you drinking tonight?"


Her turn came, and the question caught her off guard. Staring into her glass, she admitted quietly, "I went to see lsaac today. He told me he wants to end things. Gavin's brow furrowed. "He used to dream about marrying you, didn't he? Why would he suddenly back out? And aren't you two already planning your wedding?"


She took a slow sip, a bitter smile tugging at her lips."He doesn't remember me. He remembers everything else-but not me."


One eyebrow lifted in shock. "Why not just tell him the truth about what you two had?"


She shook her head, a sigh slipping out. "That would only make things worse. I met him in Clokron, and his family knows nothing about me. A few of his friends do,but they've kept quiet out of worry for his health.His mind must have buried me on purpose, shutting me out as a way to shield himself. It's his illness pushing me away."


Deep down, she sensed that Isaac still cared, but not with the same strength as before. He had chosen to erase their memories because facing her after learning the truth of his condition was unbearable.His heart couldn't let go of her, but his mind had made the choice for him.


For that reason, Verena had never rushed to tell him everything. Besides, love couldn't be forced. If he learned their shared past from her mouth, it would feel like listening to someone else's story. The story only mattered if he recalled it on his own.


Her narrow shoulders sagged as she tipped her glass back and drained it.


By the time their talk dragged on, she'd lost track of how many glasses she'd had. The liquor only magnified the sorrow she'd been holding back, until she slumped forward on the counter, her eyes dazed and unfocused.


Seeing her unravel like this for the first time, Gavin reached over and patted her back, bending close so his voice could rise above the blaring music. "Don't worry. He loves you too deeply for it to disappear.Memories have a way of returning."


From across the room, Kaia's eyes went wide. She fumbled for her phone and quickly snapped photos of Verena with Gavin. At last, she thought smugly, that shameless Verena had given her something to use against her.


With a curl of contempt on her lips, Kaia snapped three shots, each framed to make the moment look far too intimate.



Just as she was about to hunt down lsaac's number and forward the pictures, she froze, recalling how fiercely he had once stood up for Verena. To Kaia,he was nothing more than a besotted fool.


After weighing her options, she chose Bobby as the better target and attached a sly message. "Curious about what Verena's been up to?"


Bobby already carried resentment toward Verena,and if he saw her leaning close to another man in a bar...


The idea lit a sly spark in Kaia's eyes. Even if Verena clawed her way into the Bennett family, her days there would be anything but smooth.


Satisfied with herself, Kaia slipped back into her seat,lifted her drink, and settled in to watch the storm she 
had set in motion.


Just as Bobby stepped out of the shower at the Bennett Mansion, three photos from Kaia popped up on his phone.


One glance left him frozen in surprise.


Bathed in neon light, the pictures revealed a man and woman seated at the counter with their backs to the camera. The man's features were hidden, but the woman leaned forward, her profile faintly visible.


Bobby's brows drew together. Could that really be...Verena?


His gaze locked on the curve of her back and the glimpse of her profile, a jolt of recognition striking him hard. He had seen her before-it was almost like looking at Dr.Willis.
###Chapter 70 Something Extraordinary





Good heavens! Could it truly be Dr. Willis?


The thought struck Bobby like a bolt out of the blue,leaving him utterly dumbfounded.


He enlarged the photo again and again, scrutinizing every detail with disbelief. Though the picture was taken from behind, he was convinced that the woman Kaia mentioned-Verena-was none other than Dr.Willis.



There was no point wasting time guessing.He would uncover the truth once he went to the bar.


Without wasting a moment, Bobby called Kaia, his excitement barely held in check.


On the table, Kaia's phone lit up. When she noticed his name on the screen, the corners of her lips curled into a satisfied smile.


She answered leisurely, pressing the phone to her ear, her voice sweet and composed."Hello?"


Before she could say anything further, Bobby's anxious tone rushed in. "Kaia, which bar is she at?Send me the address this instant."



Kaia complied without hesitation, forwarding the location to him. "Done. Check the message."


Bobby gave the address a quick glance, hurriedly changed clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed downstairs. His voice was edged with urgency as he gave instructions. "You're still at the bar, right? Do whatever it takes to keep Verena there. Don't let her slip away. I'm on my way."


The tremor in his voice revealed how unsettled he truly was.


Kaia, however, felt a surge of satisfaction.


Clearly, Bobby was desperate to catch Verena in the act.


If Bobby confronted her, Verena's proud and unyielding nature would ensure an inevitable quarrel. And should someone "accidentally" record the spectacle in that bustling bar, word would spread like wildfire. Alec and Laura would not only be crushed by Verena's disgraceful behavior but also feel deeply humiliated.


In that moment, Kaia would shine as the only daughter worth relying upon.


As for the Bennett family, no matter how much lsaac might shield Verena, if both Danica and Bobby turned against her, then-even if shemanaged to marry into the Bennett household-her life would be nothing but walking on thorns.


In every sense, it was a plan that killed two birds with one stone.


Her eyes glittered with a triumphant gleam,her smirk impossible to conceal.


She added softly to Bobby, "Of course. I'm not just helping you. She's still my sister, and I don't wish to watch her stumble down such a foolish path."


Bobby dismissed her pretentious words without comment and hung up, tossing his keys to the driver."Aurora Bar. Quickly!"


The driver caught the keys and bowed his head respectfully. "Yes, Mr. Bennett."


Moments later, they were on the road, the car speeding through the night.


Bobby's abrupt hang-up did not bother Kaia in the slightest. She was already savoring the image of Verena's downfall, and the mere thought was intoxicating.


Meanwhile, in the back seat of the car, Bobby kept staring at the photos Kaia had sent, each passing glance strengthening his conviction-Verena was Dr.Willis.



Nervous sweat dampened his palms.


Unable to contain his emotions, he dialed Slater.


After a few rings, the call connected.


An irritated voice greeted him. "Really, Bobby? Do you ever check the time before calling?" Anyone woken from a dream would sound irritable.


Yet Bobby paid no attention to Slater's annoyance,blurting out his excitement. "Listen, Slater! You won't believe this. I've stumbled on something extraordinary. Verena might actually be Dr. Willis!"


At first, Slater thought Bobby was merely ranting and was ready to snap back, but the next words left him stunned.



"What nonsense are you spouting at this hour? Are you sure you're alright?" Slater chuckled in disbelief."I was at the Willis residence just days ago and eliminated that possibility with my own eyes. And now you expect me to believe Verena is Dr. Willis?What is this, some kind of early/ April Fool's prank?"


Bobby, anticipating his skepticism, swiftly forwarded the three photos.


"I'm not joking. I'm on my way to the bar right now.These were just taken. Look carefully at the woman-this is no mere coincidence."



Slater opened one of the pictures absentmindedly- aordinary and froze.


For a long moment, silence reigned, until Bobby,thinking the call had dropped, called his name.Suddenly, a startled curse burst from Slater's lips.


"Good heavens! That silhouette, that profile-it does resemble Dr. Willis." Slater zoomed in repeatedly,nearly convinced it was her.


After all, someone with Dr. Willis' elegance and striking figure was far too rare for mere chance.


Bobby arched a brow. "See? I told you l wasn't spinning tales."


Slater leapt out of bed. "Where are you now? Wait for me-I'm coming to0."


Bobby glanced out the window. "I'm just passing your street. I'll pick you up."


Slater hurriedly threw on some clothes. "Fine. I'll be waiting downstairs."


When the call ended, Bobby clutched his phone tightly, his chest swelling with a storm of emotions. If Verena truly was Dr. Willis,then all this time he had been speaking ill of her... Oh no!


Inside the bar, Kaia brushed off the advances of a few men and declined her friends' invitation to dance.


She remained seated, her gaze locked on the two figures by the counter, as if afraid they might vanish should she glance away.


As she sipped her drink, her eyes lingered on Verena with a mocking glint.


Across the room, Verena still leaned against the counter, unresponsive, while Gavin wore a troubled look. It was clear that none of his comforting words had reached her.


He scratched his head and finally offered, "Verena,believe me. With the way lsaac feels about you,he can't possibly cast you aside for good. You just need to raise the stakes, and he'll surely return to you."


Verena, drunk and weary, lifted her heavy head, her voice raspy. "Raise the stakes? I can't bring myself to pressure him. And I've already raised them enough by claiming I would be with other men if he let go,yet he still forced himself to ask me to leave."


Gavin clicked his tongue and leaned closer, lowering his voice. "You still don't understand. Men may act tough, but when it truly matters, they discover their limits. Words alone won't break him-you need action. Give me your phone, I'll help you."


Before Verena could object, Gavin had already taken her phone, unlocking it with her fingerprint. He opened the camera, leaned in close, and with a sharp click, captured a picture of himself beside her-her face and his half-body illuminated by the colorful lights of the bar.


The photo radiated an intimacy that words alone could not conjure.


Verena snatched her phone back, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. "What do you think you're doing?"


"Helping you raise the stakes, of course," Gavin replied, his tone brimming with strategy. "Here's what you'll send: type 'I'm drunk. Are you certain youdon't want to come pick me up?'-and attach this photo."
 
 ###Chapter 71 It's Working





Verena's thoughts were a little clouded, though she hadn't entirely lost her clarity.


She understood full well what Gavin's words implied.After lingering on the photo for a moment, she opened the chat app and began typing a message to Isaac.


As her fingers flew across the screen, Gavin leaned closer, stealing a glance. He broke into hearty laughter, teasing, "Well, who would've imagined Dr.Willis had such a sly streak?"


He said this because Verena had embroidered the story, making it appear even more dramatic than Gavin's original version.


Verena only smiled faintly in reply to her friend's playful remark.


Then she carefully reread the message she had drafted. "Isaac, your attitude today really wounded me. I'm drunk now. Are you sure you won't come to get me? If you don't, I might just do something reckless."



Content with her words, she pressed send-and attached the photo as well.


Placing the phone face down on the counter,Verena told herself that if lsaac refused to show up, she would indeed act recklessly. She didn't mind barging into the Bennett Mansion again, determined to "torment" him with her presence.


Meanwhile, inside the Bennett Mansion, the door at the far end of the second-floor hallway remained firmly shut. The room lay wrapped in darkness. The bed was untouched, and the curtains were left open,allowing a narrow stream of moonlight to spill onto the floor.


By the window sat lsaac in his wheelchair, staring into the night with a distant gaze, utterly lost in thought.


The window wasn't completely closed, and the cold wind crept through the gaps. Outside, tall trees swayed, their shifting shadows crossing his face, deepening the lonely silhouette he cast.



Isaac hadn't known restful sleep for nights on end.Each time he lay down, memories surged like an endless reel: the sight of his father bleeding after the accident,the weight of his own disability, the torment of his dysfunction, and the thought of Verena-forever beyond his reach. He could only endure the endless nights until dawn, and then bury himself in work to silence the torment.


All at once, the phone on the small table beside him buzzed twice.


At such an hour, he hadn't expected a message from anyone.


His fingers twitched, and Verena's image leapt instantly to his mind.


He picked up the phone, and at the sight of her name,his brows drew together.


Opening her chat, he scanned her words, his eyes narrowing at once.


Below the message was a selfie she had sent.


The neon lights behind her revealed clearly that she was in a bar.


Her cheeks were flushed, her lips tinged with a deep rose, and her bright eyes blurred slightly, carrying the disarming charm of intoxication.


The scene struck him like déjà vu-he had seen her drunk before in that hotel, and he recognized that look. By her side was a man, his face concealed,but his broad shoulders and attire betrayed his gender at once.



The word "reckless" from her message rang in his head, and a sharp ache spread across his temples.His thoughts darted back to that night in the hotel,when she had kissed him while drunk. Would she repeat such recklessness with another man?


The pain in his chest was like a knife's thrust, forcing him to cut short the images before they spiraled further. He realized then how fragile his composure truly was. Just the sight of a man leaning near her in that picture was enough to rouse a storm of jealousy.If his mind ran loose, he knew he could lose all reason.



Isaac's eyes fixed on the photo, his once calm features darkening, his gaze cold and sharp as if he could pierce straight through the figure partly captured in the frame.


Reason told him this was the moment to step back,yet his heart was deaf to such counsel. Fire burned in his chest, and with a bitter smile, he admitted he had once again surrendered to her.


"You promised me time to think. And this... this is your idea of patience," he murmured bitterly.


Consumed by jealousy, he could no longer think straight. His voice broke into a roar. "Andres, prepare the car!"


At once, Andres approached the door, asking respectfully,"Mr.Bennett, where shall I take you?"


Isaac froze briefly, realizing Verena hadn't shared the bar's address.


His throat tightened. With trembling fingers, he hurriedly dialed her number.


Back at the bar, Verena and Gavin were deep in conversation when Gavin motioned to her phone and said with a sly grin, "See? It's working. Amnesia or not, Isaac is still lsaac."


Verena's eyes lit with sudden joy as she picked up the phone and answered.


Before she could utter a word, Isaac's low, strained voice surged through the receiver. "Where are you?"


Just as Verena was about to reveal her location,Gavin leaned in mischievously and spoke in a hushed tone near the speaker. "Hey, beauty, are you alone?"


Verena shot him a sharp look, while Gavin only raised his brows knowingly and spread his hands.


Catching on quickly, Verena pressed her lips together and answered, "Yes, I'm alone."


The playful exchange was the last straw for lsaac. His hand clenched the phone so tightly his knuckles turned pale, his voice taut with urgency. "Verena,where are you? Tell me now."


Before she could respond, Gavin plucked the phone from her hand and switched it off.



"What are you doing?" Verena demanded, frowning.


"This," Gavin explained calmly, setting the phone aside, "is how you force a man's hand. A desperate bid to win you back. We'll make sure he never dares push you away again."


Verena blinked, turning over his words, and realized they weren't without reason.


Back in the mansion, lsaac froze as the line went dead. A sudden rush of panic seized him, and he quickly dialed again.


"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.Please try again later," the mechanical voice repeated.


His jaw tightened, his brow furrowed deeply. He redialed again and again, only to hear the same response.


For the first time in his life, Isaac cursed aloud. The thought of Verena being drunk and exposed to unwelcome advances was unbearable.


In desperation, he dialed Jacob. The assistant answered at once.


Without giving him time to speak, lsaac ordered hurriedly, "Check the photo I just sent you. Find the bar. Quickly."


On the other end, Jacob opened the photo, his memory sparking-he had visited that very bar before.
###Chapter 72 What Are You To Him





The moment the car slowed, Bobby and Slater flung the doors open and sprinted toward the bar.


Bobby went ahead and shoved open the heavy soundproof door. A blast of music crashed into them,while colorful lights flashed across the crowd of customers.



Inside, the lighting was low, yet they spotted Verena right away at the counter across from the entrance.


Verena leaned against the counter in a slump, her face tense with discomfort. The sharp smell of alcohol filled her nose, and her stomach turned uneasily.


She made an effort to sit upright and muttered a few broken words under her breath.



Gavin thought she was talking to him, so he bent closer. "Huh? What's wrong?" he asked. Verena eased off the stool with a faint scowl. "think... I'm gonna be sick," she whispered.


The blaring speakers drowned her words, so Gavin leaned even nearer. "What did you say?"


"I said I'm gonna vomit!" Verena shouted in his ear,gagging as soon as the words left her mouth.


The meaning finally clicked, and Gavin grabbed hold of her arms. "Whoa, easy! Please, don't ruin my clothes!"



From where Bobby and Slater stood, the scene looked different. They saw her slip from the stool,and before she could walk away, a man across from her pulled her into his arms. His back faced the door,his face hidden, his wide shoulders in plain sight.


Exchanging a sharp glance, Bobby and Slater narrowed their eyes and edged closer.


Then Verena lifted her head. When they caught her face clearly, both men froze. It really was Dr. Willis!


Bobby's eyes stretched wide, and he grabbed his head with both hands. He had told himself in the car to be ready, yet standing here in front of her was still too much. Thinking about it had been one thing.Seeing it unfold with his own eyes was something else. He could hardly process that Verena was Dr.Willis, and every cruel word he had hurled at her before now echoed in his mind.


No one could have imagined it. The woman he had despised and tried to push away with all his might was the same one he secretly wished would join his family as his sister-in-law. The thought left him feeling completely ruined.


Heat crept across Bobby's face in raw embarrassment. It was a good thing Dr. Willis didn't know he was Isaac's brother. If she'd known the man she once saved was the same one who'd gone on to treat her so coldly, and that he was her future husband's brother, she wouldn't have hesitated to slap him.


His lips parted on reflex, but not a sound came out.The idea of lsaac  tearing into him was terrifying enough, yet remembering the cruel things he had spat at Verena made him feel like ending himself was not far-fetched.


Beside him, Slater stood frozen in the same shock.The words "holy crap" lit up in his head like a neon sign. His jaw dropped so wide it could have fit an egg, and he gawked at Verena in disbelief. After all the times he had brushed aside the possibility, here it was-the truth. Dr. Willis truly was Alec's daughter.What a pointless chase that had been.


Since her call to Bobby earlier, Kaia kept flicking her eyes toward the bar's entrance, worried she might miss his arrival.


When Bobby entered with Slater at his side, Kaia's lips curled into a smirk. She hadn't expected him to bring company, but the thought pleased her. The more people around, the better the show would be.


Kaia rose to her feet, prepared to greet them, yet froze when she realized they had both come to an abrupt halt.


Tracing Bobby's gaze, Kaia spotted Verena in the arms of the man at the counter. The dim glow madethe scene appear almost intimate, like that of a couple.


A spark of excitement flickered in Kaia's eyes as she took in the sight. The timing couldn't have been better. With Bobby watching it unfold for himself, he had no choice but to believe Verena was disloyal.


Trying to hide the grin tugging at her lips, Kaia rushed to Bobby's side and clung to his arm. "Mr.Bennett,Verena..."


Bobby didn't so much as look at her and brushed her aside with a sharp wave. "Step away, don't get in my line of sight."


Her voice broke off in shock. She pressed her hand to the spot where he had shoved her and asked in disbelief, "Mr. Bennett, why are you..."


His sudden wide-eyed stare toward the counter drew her eyes in the same direction. There she saw Verena pressed close against the man, his head angling down for a kiss. They were kissing right there.


Gavin caught Verena every time she lurched forward, struggling desperately to steady her. Her body sagged uncontrollably, and after fighting the urge for several moments, she lost the battle.


Clutching his arm, she shook her head in weak defeat. "I can't do it anymore, Gavin. I really feel like I'm going to be sick."


Panic made Gavin's voice spill out in a rush as he tried to lead her forward. "No, no, Verena-Dr.Willis!Just a little longer, please. I'll get you to the restroom right away."


Before he could even finish the words, a sharp draft of air swept behind him. He moved on instinct,shifting sideways and turning to look, but he wasn't fast enough. A fist slammed straight into his face.The sudden sting forced him to drop Verena as his hand flew to his eye, and he stumbled several steps back in pain.


With no one steadying her, Verena reeled backward and braced herself against the counter. Her vision blurred, her mind foggy from drink, and she could hardly process what was happening. By the time she focused again, she saw Gavin pinned hard against the floor.


On top of him, Bobby straddled his chest and drove his fists repeatedly into Gavin's face.


Bobby's teeth clenched in fury, his voice tearing out of him with every blow. "You dared to touch my future sister-in-law? You think you can bully Dr.Willis? I'll beat you down for this, you bastard!"


The alcohol clouded Gavin's mind, and being attacked so suddenly left him dizzy and lost. Instinct alone guided him as his hands gripped Bobby's shoulders, flipping him over in a burst of strength to fight back. The struggle turned into a messy tangle on the floor, fists flying without thought. Even when they rolled apart and pushed themselves back to their feet, the fight refused to end, their bodies crashing against each other in unrelenting anger.



Slowly, Verena's senses sharpened, and she finally realized that Gavin had been dragged into a full-blown fight. When she saw Bobby about to slam a punch toward Gavin's stomach, panic shot through her. She darted forward and threw herself in front of Gavin, arms spread wide. "Touch him again and I swear I'll call the police," she shouted.


Slater, who had stood frozen for too long, finally snapped out of his shock. He rushed forward to grab Bobby's arms, pulling him back even as Bobby strained to lunge forward again. "Bobby, get a hold of yourself! Calm down!"


From her spot a short distance away, Kaia kepot her eyes fixed on the chaos with growing confusion.This was not how she had imagined the scene at all.Instead of turning his anger toward Verena, Bobby had attacked the stranger with a fury that carried the unmistakable air of a man protecting his own family.


The sound of Verena's voice made Bobby freeze,his eyes widening at her in disbelief. Did she actually threaten to call the police on him, just to protect this man? Did that mean she truly had something to do with him? For a brief moment, Bobby couldn't decide which version of Verena was real. Was she the refined,thoughtful Dr. Willis? Was she the arrogant woman who acted superior and lectured him in those messages? Or was she this woman standing here,entangled with some questionable man?


His brows drew together in puzzled frustration, and Bobby asked, "Dr. Willis, why are you protecting himm?Why would you help a man like that? What are you to him?"


Verena's gaze lingered on Bobby, and in that instant she remembered-he was the same boy she had pulled from a wrecked car.


Her lips parted as if to answer, but a heavy surge of nausea climbed up her throat and stopped her short.


She leaned her elbow on the counter and propped her head, her face twisted slightly in discomfort as she stared back at Bobby. "You jumped in and attacked my friend without reason. Naturally, I have to step in for him."


Kaia broke through the crowd in a hurry and called out,"Verena."


One eyebrow arched, and Verena shot Kaia a glance that carried more indifference than interest.


From the tone Kaia used and the timing of her arrival,Verena immediately sensed there was trouble stirring beneath the surface.



Sure enough, Kaia's expression tightened, arranging itself into a mask of false concern, as if to say she was only trying to help. She spoke with mock indignation. "How could you treat Bobby so harshly just because of another man? He's Isaac's younger brother,you know."


Because the bar thundered with noise, everyone had to raise their voices to be heard.


Kaia placed heavy stress on the words "another man," practically shouting them as if she wanted the entire room to notice, deliberately drawing attention to Verena's supposed closeness with Gavin.


Bobby's head turned instinctively toward Verena at Kaia's words, his eyes narrowing with suspicion as he studied her face.


Right at that moment, a violent churn rose in Verena's stomach. She clamped a hand over her mouth and lifted her other hand, signaling for them to stop.


"Wait a second," she remarked, before turning quickly and hurrying toward the restroom.
###Chapter 73 Dr. Willis Is Single





After Verena left, the group sank into silence.


"Oh." A playful voice broke through the hush.


Bobby, Slater, and Kaia all turned to Gavin, confusion written across their faces.


Gavin touched his throbbing lip, forced a crooked smile, rolled up his sleeves, and fixed his eyes on Bobby. "So-you're Isaac's brother, are you? Well, I'm not one to let debts linger. That punch you gave me earlier... I believe it's time the scales were balanced,don't you think so?"


Without another word, Gavin lunged and threw a punch.


Bobby realized too late; the blow landed squarely on his cheek.


Already irritated by Kaia's sharp remarks, Bobby's temper now ignited like dry tinder struck by flint. He ground his teeth. "You think justice is that simple?You hit me, and I'll see to it you pay the price."


With that, Bobby kicked at Gavin.


But Gavin was ready, stepping aside with ease.


Bobby, unfazed, balled his fist again, swinging with renewed fury. The two men collided once more, fists flying in a storm.


Slater, the only one clinging to reason, pushed forward to break them apart, his hand reaching for Bobby's shoulder. "Stop it, enough! Didn't you hear?He's Dr. Willis' friend, don't-ah!"


His cry tore the air. Bobby's punch, dodged by Gavin,had landed squarely on Slater's face instead.


Slater felt fire blaze through his left eye. Wincing, he steadied himself and reached for Gavin. "We're on the same side-stop this, stop-damn!"


He cursed under his breath, staggering back, his right eye already swelling into a dark bruise.


Seeing another punch aimed his way, Slater barked, "Damn it! If I'm the one getting hit, then I'm hitting back!" He tightened his fists and retaliated.


And so, the three of them spiraled into a chaotic scuffle.


The bar's patrons, well-accustomed to such nightly storms, paid little mind. Some even watched with mild amusement, as if the brawl were nothing more than tonight's entertainment.


"Look at that-people with disabilities come to bars too?" A woman's mocking voice cut across the noise.


Heads turned toward the entrance. There, half-shadowed beneath dim lights, sat a man in a navy trench coat, confined to a wheelchair yet radiating a presence that made the air heavier. His features were veiled, but his authority was unmistakable.


"Would you believe it? Still comes to a bar for fun despite the chair," someone scoffed.


"Keep your voices down," another muttered. "Didn't you notice the men behind him? Those aren't just bodyguards-they're wolves in suits." As if to prove the point, one towering figure in a black suit turned his gaze their way. His eyes, sharp as blades, sent a chill through the crowd, and in an instant, the onlookers fell silent, retreating into their drinks and dice games.


Kaia heard those patrons' words and turned toward the door. Her brows drew tight. Could it be lsaac?


Soon, her suspicion was confirmed-lsaac was indeed here, and the sight left her cold.


Isaac, for his part, paid no heed to the whispers. He'd heard too many to care. His thoughts clung only to Verena. His eyes, cold and unwavering, swept ahead -where three figures wrestled by the counter.


The bodyguard closest to lsaac caught sight of one of the fighters and leaned in, his voice low. "Mr.Bennett, isn't that your brother up ahead?"


Isaac swept his gaze across the room. Verena was nowhere in sight, yet one jacket among the three brawlers was all too familiar-it matched the photograph Verena had sent him earlier. His eyes narrowed, a shard of cold light flickering within. "Break them apart," he ordered, his tone like steel.

"Bring me the man in the brown jacket."


The bodyguard bowed slightly. "Yes, sir."


The fight was stillraging when Bobby lifted his leg to strike Gavin again-only to find himself hauled into the air by his collar,feet kicking helplessly.


Slater lunged at Gavin, teeth bared in desperation,but he too was seized by the collar, dangling as though gravity itself had forsaken him.


"Hey! Who the hell-" Bobby's curse halted the moment his eyes rose to the man holding him.Recognition lit his face. "Oh, it's you, Hawley! You came to back us up!"


Slater, too, recognized the bodyguard instantly-Hawley Aston, the Bennett family's most trusted guardian. A surge of relief and confidence flooded both men. Surely Hawley would deal with Gavin on their behalf.



Yet their hopes dissolved in an instant. With effortless strength, Hawley held them aside as if they were no more than rag dolls. He tossed Bobby and Slater away without ceremony, and then turned on Gavin. Before Gavin even grasped what had happened,Hawley had lifted him off his feet and carried him off like a hawk clutching its prey.


Gavin thrashed in resistance, but against a former mercenary like Hawley, his struggle was as useless as a moth battering against glass.


Hawley stopped before Isaac and spoke with military crispness."Mr.Bennett, I've brought him."


Isaac's hands tightened on the armrests of his wheelchair, his voice colder than the bite of winter."Where's Verena?"


Before Gavin could shape an answer, Bobby burst forward, seizing the chance to complain. "Isaac, it's this man! You must let Hawley teach him a lesson. He didn't just hug your future wife-he kissed her!I saw it with my own eyes!"


In his rush, Bobby twisted the truth, confusing wanted to kiss with kissed-yet in his mind, both sins weighed the same. Gavin was guilty either way. Isaac's grip hardened, his gaze cutting into Gavin like twin blades.


Gavin opened his mouth to deny, but then paused.He recalled his exchange with Verena. He had already done enough to stir lsaac's jealousy; now he wished to test whether lsaac's trust in her ran deeper than suspicion.


Drawing himself upright despite his bruises, Gavin smoothed his dlisheveled clothes and spoke with calm, deliberate poise.


"So what? Dr. Willis is single. A gentleman has every right to pursue a lady. The way I pursue her is my affair. As long as Dr. Willis herself raises no objection,the rest of you-who matter little in this-have no right to pass judgment."
###Chapter 74 Jealousy





Gavin's words sliced through lsaac's chest like a thousand unseen blades, as though each syllable tried to pierce the very core of his heart. Jealousy swelled inside him, a black hole swallowing the last fragments of reason, leaving only darkness in its wake.


Isaac fixed his eyes on Gavin, his memory sharp as ever. Even beneath the bruises that marred Gavin's face, he recognized him-the same man who had once sat across from Verena at Fortune Garden Restaurant.



Just friends? The thought rang hollow. Could such closeness truly be brushed off as mere friendship?Ha-people often doubted whether men and women could walk that line without stumbling. Now, the answer seemed clear: no.


Though Isaac could not untangle the truth in Gavin's words, Bobby's account of Gavin's earlier behavior toward Verena was already more than enough to inflame him.


Isaac's eyes blazed with jealousy and deep-rooted anger, a storm begging to be unleashed on Gavin.


Bitterness, regret, envy-one after another, the feelings circled him like vultures, tearing at his sanity without rest. His sharply cut jaw clenched tight, and his gaze gleamed with the ferocity of a predator,coiled and ready to strike.


His voice struck like ice against steel as he demanded, "Who gave you permission to touch her?"


Gavin flinched beneath that piercing gaze, fear chilling him for a heartbeat before his easy mask returned.



He laughed lightly, feigning ease, tilting his head in mock amusement. "Ah, Mr. Bennett, you have quite the sense of humor. Didn't you turn Dr. Willis away yourself? Or are you forbidding her from developing feelings for someone else?" Developing feelings?" Isaac echoed, teeth clenched, his face clouding like a storm on the horizon.


Gavin, savoring the chaos, decided to pour oil onto the flames. "Truth be told, I've admired Dr. Willis for quite some time. She isn't only beautiful-her mind and skill are rare treasures. Now that she's said she's single, tell me, what man wouldn't seize such a chance? Don't you think so, Mr. Bennett?"


Every word Gavin spoke was a spark to lsaac's fury.His eyes narrowed, cold as frost. This man knew his surname-his very identity. That could only mean Verena had spoken of him. But what had she said?That he had driven her away step by step? That he had rejected her until she stood alone, ripe for another's pursuit?


Isaac lowered his gaze, fury shadowing his brow, but sorrow weighing heavier. That little deceiver-only hours ago she had promised to wait, to give him time. Yet within the span of a night, she called herself single to another man. Isaac suspected Verena had done it on purpose. She was a sly fox, skilled in the art of reverse psychology,weaving snares with calculated ease. And yet, he had walked into her trap willingly-for the mere thought of it being true was a burden too heavy to bear.


Meanwhile, Verena had rinsed her face after vomiting and stepped out of the restroom, only to find Gavin restrained by a burly man. Before she could ask,Gavin's mocking words floated to her ears.


Her brows drew together in mild annoyance. What nonsense was he spouting this time?


She moved closer, nudging him lightly on the arm."What exactly are you rambling about?"


Caught off guard by her return, Gavin's face twisted as if his good intentions were being misread.Leaning close, he whispered, "Don't spoil it. I'm helping you."


Still lightheaded, Verena tilted her head, murmuring back, "Helping me with what, exactly?"


They bent toward each other, whispers passing between them, their closeness resembling cO- conspirators plotting a secret pact.


From a short distance, Isaac's hand clamped the armrest so hard that his knuckles cracked audibly.


That nearness-heads brushing, hair mingling-drove him to the edge. Jealousy slithered through his chest like venom, slow yet merciless, pushing him toward the brink of collapse.


He fought to hold back the rising tide of fury, his voice finally breaking the tension-low, steady, and edged with fire. "Verena."


###Chapter 75 Don't Bite





Bobby and Slater dared not meet Isaac's eyes. They felt like strangers at their own table, out of place and unable to grasp the gravity of the moment. So, they simply melted into the background, hoping not to stir the storm.


Kaia had drifted several steps back, anchoring herself at the farthest corner. The scene was slipping beyond her expectations, and her palms grew clammy with nervous sweat.


When Isaac called her name, Verena turned. Beneath the flickering lights, she caught the raw fire of jealousy burning in his eyes. Her own gaze softened,and she offered him a quiet, reassuring smile.


His arrival was both foreseen and unforeseen. She had expected him to come, yet not with such speed,as though he had raced against time itself.


When he saw Verena rooted in place, Isaac's browsknitted faintly. His voice dropped low. "Come here."


Verena had just gathered herself to step forward when Gavin's hand clamped onto her shoulder.


With a cold snort, he sneered, "Mr. Bennett, do you think this is fair? You pushed Dr. Willis away, and now you want her back. You think you can just cast her off when it pleases you and summon her when it suits you? Why should she bow to your whims?"


Isaac did not waver. His eyes locked on Verena,desperate to catch even the smallest ripple of emotion.



Yet, Verena's calm gaze met his without a word.


Her eyes were so crystalline that lsaac felt his very thoughts laid bare under their clarity.


All that had unfolded left him in dread. He could not stomach the image of Verena with another man,nor endure even the thought of her sharing closeness with someone else. The mere notion that another might desire her gnawed at his soul with claws of jealousy.  
Torn between insecurity and jealousy, it was jealousy that rose triumphant. He no longer cared for frailties of body or shadows in his mind. All he craved was Verena by his side. With her, everything else could fade to dust.



Those watching expected Isaac, stung by Gavin's barbed words, to turn away in anger.


Instead, he bowed his head and murmured, "I was wrong. If you will not come to me... then I will come to you."



He steered his wheelchair forward, halted before Verena, and reached for her hand. His eyes lifted to hers. "Will you come back with me?"


His heart thudded wildly, his expression taut with fear that she might never forgive him for the wounds he had carved with cruel words.



Verena studied him. His eyes, deep as hidden waters,his voice tinged with plea, and the tremor at the end of his words betrayed his unease. She could never resist him when he softened. She knelt, wrapped her arms around his neck, and whispered, "Isaac, Gavin only wanted to mislead you.He already has someone he loves, and so do l. We merely crossed paths here by chance. I told you before, as long as you turn back, I will always be here -my word unbroken."


The last line was a mirror of his own promise to her,now returned like an echo.


Isaac gazed at her. Her eyes were brimming with tenderness, as though her pupils held a sky littered with stars. His heart melted.


His throat tightened as he asked in a husky voice,"Then...will you come with me?"


A playful curve touched Verena's lips. "I've been waiting for you to come and fetch me."


His taut expression eased, and at last, a faint smile broke across his face.


Verena guided Isaac out of the bar. Once they entered the car, the driver and bodyguard moved to join them, but Isaac stopped them. "Wait outside for a while. I have something to discuss with my fiancée."



They exchanged knowing looks and nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."


They withdrew, granting the couple their privacy.


Isaac raised the half-lowered window and turned toward Verena's sparkling eyes.


Her smile warmed him like sunlight breaking through clouds.



Her hand still rested in his, and Isaac's thumb traced gentle circles on its back.


"Why are you so happy?" he asked softly.


Verena shook her head, her cheeks tinged pink from drink, her eyes glistening. Her voice stretched languidly. "I like it when you call me your fiancée.Say it again."


It dawned on Isaac then-she hadn't fully sobered.


The heater hummed. She had shed her coat, now clad in a blue cashmere sweater and fittedjeans that framed her figure with effortless grace.


His Adam's apple bobbed, his chest heaved, and his eyes grew heavy with unspoken longing.


He drew her hand gently, pulling her closer, and then folded her into his embrace.



His breathing deepened as he whispered again,"Fiancée...my fiancée."


From the instant he had seen her at the bar, the urge to hold her close had burned within him, though circumstance had forced restraint.



Caught unawares, Verena tumbled against his firm chest.



"Isaac, you-" Before she could finish, his lips hovered close, his intent unmistakable.



Startled, she pressed her free hand against his shoulder. She had just thrown up earlier.


The subtle fragrance on her was broken, and Isaac glanced at  her delicate hand holding him back. His lashes lowered as he blinked slowly.


"Why push me away?" His tone carried grievance,like a child robbed of his cherished toy.


Verena's hand slipped down as she explained gently,"It's not that. I just... threw up."


The implication was clear-she feared she might not smell pleasant.


Isaac blinked, briefly stunned.


"You rinsed your mouth?" he asked.


Verena nodded. A small smile touched his lips.


"Then it's fine," he murmured, leaning in once more.


Realizing he was serious, Verena pressed against him again, pleading softly, "No, not now. We'll have plenty of chances later, won't we?"


Isaac's gaze lingered on her reddened lips, his Adam's apple rising, his eyes sliding down her delicate neck. They narrowed with a heat that defied words. As Verena leaned back in persuasion, her slender neck arched, exposed in the dim glow.


"Fine, no kissing," Isaac conceded. Yet before she could relax, he suddenly drew her onto his lap,seating her astride,face to face.


Startled, Verena gasped, only to hear him murmur,"This much is allowed, yes?"


"Mmm..." she groaned faintly.


His warm lips brushed her neck, sending sparks that raced down her spine.


Before she could recover, he nibbled lightly at her skin, part playful, part possessive.


"Isaac..." Verena clung to his shoulder, her body trembling as sparks coursed from her back to her mind, leaving her weak and pliant against him.


In the dim light of the car, Isaac lifted his head at the sound of her voice. "What's wrong?"


His breath skimmed her chin, light as a feather,stirring her heart with an aching itch. Her cheeks flushed, she pinched his burning earlobe and murmured, half-coaxing, half-complaining,"Don't bite."



"Alright, no biting," Isaac agreed at once, and then lowered his head to press his lips to her collarbone.



His tongue traced her skin, slow and deliberate, his lips drawing firmly at intervals.



It was no bite, yet it unsettled her far more.



Outside the car, the driver and bodyguard exchanged looks. The driver squinted toward the vehicle.



"Did the car just move?" the driver muttered.



The bodyguard, sharp-eyed from years as a mercenary, gave it a glance. "No."



The driver frowned. "Strange. They sent us away,and it's been so long-yet no sign of movement?"



The bodyguard pressed his lips together, impassive."Better not to meddle in Mr. Bennett's business.Orders are orders."
 
    


Inside the bar, after Verena left with Isaac, the group stood rooted, still reeling from the turn of events.


No one had expected it to end this way.


Bobby and Slater traded bewildered looks. "What just happened?" Bobby asked, baffled.


Slater shrugged, palms up. "Don't ask me. I'm just as lost."



Seeing he had no role left to play, Gavin decided the night had reached its end. All he wanted was sleep-and a clear head in the morning.



He chuckled dryly and told the two, "I'll settle today's account with you later. I'm leaving."


It sounded less like farewell and more like a verdict.


As Gavin's figure faded into the distance, Bobby's mind turned over the events. Something didn't add up. Gavin hardly seemed invested in Dr. Willis at all-and he knew she was Verena, Isaac's fiancée. Then the realization struck like a bolt. Bobby's eyes widened. He hadn't connected Verena and Dr. Willis because Kaia had once said in their group that Verena was unattractive.



He turned sharply toward Kaia and demanded,"Didn't you tell us before that Verena wasn't attractive?"



He frowned. Was this what Kaia had called unattractive?



Slater too shot her a questioning glance.


Kaia froze where she stood, as though her shoes had been nailed to the floor. She had been so eager to expose Verena's supposed flaws that she had forgotten the last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena's true beauty.


Kaia's face drained of color in an instant.
 ###Chapter 76 Warning





Kaia stiffened under the sharp stares of Bobby and Slater, a shiver crawling up her spine.


Her lips quivered as she forced herself to defend."When Verena first came to the city, she didn't care much about appearances, and she wasn't as attractive as she is now. When people in the group chat asked me about her, I just said she was alright.I never called her ugly. Those rumors were made up by others.How can you pin that on me?"


She tried to sound reasonable, as though she were the victim of false blame, but panic pressed at her chest.



Bobby caught every crack in her story and gave a slow, mocking grin. "Do you think I'm that easy to fool? If it were my sister, I'd never stand by while outsiders insulted her. And you expect me to believe Verena could ever be described as just 'alright'?Even without effort, she outshines most. If the gossip 
didn't come from you, then why didn't you step in to stop it? Tell me, Kaia, are you really acting like a sister here, or were you quietly pushing this along?"



His relentless questioning tore through the fragile wall she'd tried to build.


Kaia's throat tightened, and she squeezed her fists to stop her nerves from showing.


"Mr. Bennett, you're being unfair. Verena is my sister,and I would never scheme against her. The reason l stayed quiet was..."



Kaia's words faltered, and she scrambled to justify herself. "Because explaining would only spark more fighting, and that fighting would spread even further.I didn't want all of this trivial gossip reaching Verena and upsetting her."



"So you think it's nothing serious?" Bobby's tone cut like a blade as his eyes narrowed. "Accusations of falsifying her degree, being selfish, arrogant, and unrefined-are those trivial to you?"


His voice dropped lower, leaving no room to escape. 
"Kaia, stop pretending. You dragged me to this bar tonight because you wanted me to see Verena with another man and stir up trouble. You wanted her branded as unfaithful so her reputation would crumble. After that, you expected me to bring the story back to lsaac or my mother. And while lsaac might keep calm, you know my mother's nature. If she believed what she heard or saw, she'd make Verena's life miserable the moment she married into our family. You'd just stand there and watch it unfold,pleased with the chaos. Isn't that the truth?"


Kaia's lips parted, but not a single defense came out.Every accusation matched the thoughts she'd buried inside. Beads of sweat gathered on her forehead,her legs turned to jelly, and the color drained from her face. The carefully polished image she had fought so hard to maintain in high society was the last thing she wanted to see crumble.



Bobby shot her a frigid look and spoke with unwavering firmness. "I don't care if it's jealousy or something else driving you, but this ends here. From now on, watch yourself and stop creating problems. If you insult my future sister-in-law again, you'll regret it."


The exchange left Slater stunned. The idea that someone could despise her own sister to this degree was beyond him.


Disgust flickered across his face as he glared at Kaia."Back at the Willis Villa, when I mentioned Verena,your outburst suddenly makes sense. You can't handle seeing her shine. And if memory serves me right, you even bragged that a few random supplements you tossed together healed my grandfather's leg. The more I think about it, the funnier it sounds."



Heat rushed to Kaia's cheeks, and she sank her teeth into her lip, furious that he had stripped her bare so mercilessly.



A sharp laugh escaped Slater as he moved closer,towering over her. "Let me clear things up for you.The one who healed my grandfather was indeed from the Willis family, but it sure wasn't you. It was Verena.Your sister. Shocking, isn't it?" Kaia had long wondered if Verena was responsible for Barrie's recovery. As long as no one confirmed it,though, she clung to the fantasy that she might guess wrong.


That fantasy shattered the instant Slater spelled it out. The truth gutted her. Why Verena of all people?She had no prestigious training, only the rough skills of a countryside healer. Kaia, on the other hand,studied medicine at a renowned university. How could Verena possibly have better medical skills than her? The thought was unbearable.



Color drained from her face, and her legs buckled as she stumbled backward.



Earlier, she had barely kept her lies afloat. Now, with Slater's brutal words cutting deeper than ever,her last defenses collapsed. Broken and humiliated,she spun on her heel and rushed out of the bar in near hysteria.







The Willis Villa still blazed with light, though the night had slipped wvell past midnight.

 In the living room, Laura sat curled on a sofa,clutching her phone. She had dialed Verena again and again, each call met with silence, yet she refused to give up.


Since the club incident, Alec had buried himself in work at the company and rarely came home.


Whenever he did stop by to grab something, Laura tried reaching out. Sometimes she got nothing more than a cold stare. Other times, his foul mood exploded, and he berated her as an unfit mother who couldn't even get her own daughter to answer the phone.


The bitterness she carried threatened to spill over,but she swallowed it back. If the family was going to have any future, then she had no choice but to bow to Verena.


Isaac dropped Verena off at the hotel, and then instructed the staff to prepare something to clear the alcohol from her system. He didn't leave until she had finished it.



Sleep tugged at her eyelids, and she made no effort to ask him to stay.


The stench of liquor clung stubbornly to her, so she dragged herself into the bathroom, craving the relief of a hot shower.


As her clothes came off, the mirror betrayed her with a glimpse of several crimson marks scattered along her collarbone and neck. Isaac used to leave those when they were together in bed...


The memory seared her cheeks red. She slapped them lightly, desperate to stop her mind from straying down that path.



A sudden vibration rattled against the countertop,pulling her attention to her phone.



Laura's name flashed on the screen, and without hesitation, Verena hit decline.


When the call cut off, the display lit up with more than twenty missed calls-all from Laura.


The reason behind Laura's relentless attempts had been clear for days now.Verena decided she had no energy to deal with it.She either silenced the phone or flatly rejected the calls.



With the phone tossed aside, she stepped beneath the running water.


Meanwhile, Laura heard nothing but the busy tone and exclaimed through clenched teeth, "Ungrateful brat!"


Her temper nearly drove her to hurl the phone across the room.



Days of unanswered calls had left her feeling insulted and powerless.



Across town, Kaia stumbled out of the bar and into a taxi. Life felt as though it had slipped out of her control, and her empty eyes reflected the chaos as she numbly pushed open the front door upon arriving home.



The sound reached Laura, who turned toward the entrance. The moment she saw Kaia step inside, her face lit up with sudden hope, as though salvation had walked in.


"Kaia, you're finally home." She rushed over,consumed by her own worries, oblivious to Kaia's ashen face and hollow expression. "I need you to do something for me."
###Chapter 77 Stop Mentioning Her In Front Of Me





Laura let out a quick explanation, her voice sharp with irritation. "I tried calling Verena again, and she hung up on me. That ungrateful girl refuses to let go of her grudge. I've already dialed her number more than twenty times, yet she still won't answer. I don't think I can bring myself to keep trying anymore."


Before Kaia could get a word in, Laura grabbed her hand with a smile and added, "But you're not like me.You're her little sister, and you've never given her a reason to be upset. Verena won't turn against you.Besides, you've always been clever with words and know how to win people over. So why don't you call her? Use a softer tone, say something nice, and ask her to talk Isaac into sparing us. After all, the two families will soon be tied together by marriage, so shouldn't we leave some space to work things out?"


The stress of the situation had already stolen Laura's  sleep for several nights.


Caught up in her own plotting, she didn't even notice the dark look tightening Kaia's features.



Kaia cut her eyes toward Laura, her jaw rigid with frustration. Just hearing Verena's name was enough to make her want to crush her, let alone lower herself to beg for Verena's mercy.



Her eyes burned with a bloodshot glare, and the fury rising inside her roared to life.



Snatching her hand free of Laura's hold, she burst out in a trembling voice, "Verena, Verena, Verena!What makes her so special that everyone keeps talking about her? The others are obsessed, Dad is too, and now even you! Ever since she showed up, all of you only see her. Do I even count as your daughter anymore?"


The living room went still for several seconds,her voice echoing off the wide walls.


Her words quivered, her tone almost breaking apart.  Laura froze, startled by the sudden fury, her smile stiff and unnatural.



Kaia had always been spoiled, but she had also been mild and obedient since she was young. Laura had never once seen her younger daughter rage with such raw anger.


Laura's face filled with shock as she asked, "Kaia,what has gotten into you?"


Kaia balled her fists, drew in a sharp breath,and spoke through clenched teeth. "I don't want to hear Verena's name again. Stop mentioningher in front of me."



She pushed past Laura without another glance and stormed upstairs to her room.



Laura stood frozen in place, truly stunned by Kaia's outburst, her eyes fixed blankly ahead as she struggled to recover. Something about her younger daughter felt changed, though she couldn't pinpoint what it was. All she knew was that Kaia no longer seemed like the girl she used to be. ···


Slater came back home from the bar that night and made his way directly toward Barrie's quarters.


He was eager to share with Barrie everything that had unfolded earlier in the day.



Surprise flickered across Slater's face when he saw the back garden still lit up, since Barrie was usually in bed by this hour.


When he drew closer, Slater spotted Barrie seated at the patio table, joined by Fletcher and Marietta.



Taking a seat beside them with a confused look, he asked, "Dad, Mom, why are you still awake?"


"You rascal, finally back from your outings."Marietta's tone carried mock annoyance, yet her eyes brimmed with affection. As she reached out to smooth down Slater's untidy bangs, she explained,"We were having a discussion with your grandpa."



Even though Barrie kept to himself most of the time,Fletcher and Marietta often turned to him for advice  whenever company matters grew complicated.


"Oh, I get it." Slater showed little interest in the details of their talk, but he straightened his posture and said firmly, "It's good you're all here together.I have something very important to tell you."
###Chapter 78 You've Got More Than One Daughter





Fletcher burst into laughter the moment he heard Slater speak. "And what could be so important for you?"


Slater let out a click of his tongue, pretending to be wounded. "Dad, you make it sound like l've got nothing better to do than fool around."


With his smile lingering, Fletcher asked, "Alright then,what's this big secret you're keeping?"


Slater rubbed the back of his neck, hesitating before admitting, "Fine, maybe it's not exactly the kind of thing you'd call big."


That confession made his parents and grandfather laugh even harder.



Straightening up, Slater spoke with a sudden gravity."But what I'm about to say will definitely surprise you."


The laughter faded at once, and every eye turned toward him in expectation.


Slater leaned in a little, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. "The doctor who cured Grandpa's leg, Dr. Willis, is actually Alec's daughter."



Shock rippled across the table, leaving them speechless for a moment.



Barrie narrowed his eyes, the astonishment written clearly across his face.



Fletcher's gaze met his wife's, both of them struggling to believe what they'd just heard.


Marietta leaned forward, doubt filled her voice."Slater, are you absolutely sure? When we visited the Willis family, they told us Dr. Willis wasn't Alec's daughter. Why are you saying otherwise now?"


Slater chuckled at her skepticism. "Mom, that day only Kaia was at home. Naturally she wasn't the doctor. Remember, the Willis family has two daughters."


Her words trailed cautiously. "So you mean..."


"Yes," Slater confirmed, his eyes gleaming with admiration. "The real Dr. Willis is Kaia's elder sister,Verena Willis."


Barrie remained silent, lost deep in thought as the revelation settled over him.



Fletcher frowned in doubt. "You mean the one engaged to lsaac? She doesn't seem to have a favorable reputation. Maybe Isaac's dislike for her is what drove him to strike at the Willis family and stir up all this trouble."


Stories about Verena had already reached Fletcher's ears. What he'd heard wasn't just unfavorable-it was downright disgraceful. Still, as a well-educated man, he chose his words cautiously to leave her some dignity.


Slater's voice rose in protest. "Not have a favorable reputation? That's all Kaia's doing. You don't know how conniving Alec's younger daughter is. She's a compulsive liar who floods the internet with her nonsense, trying to ruin Verena's name. She tells everyone Dr. Willis is unattractive, arrogant,dishonest, and useless."


He then turned toward Barrie and said, "Grandpa.Mom and Dad haven't met Dr. Willis, but you and l have. Do you honestly think Kaia's smears make sense? Just her looks alone-how many women in Shoildon can match her? And her personality? She's gentle to the core. As for her skills, they're beyond doubt. Anyone bold enough to operate on you has to be at a professor's level at least."



Barrie sat in silence, his expression serious as he reflected. Rumors had never mattered to him anyway.All that counted was that Dr. Willis had proven herself to be one of the best physicians in Clokron.


Slater leaned forward, continuing firmly, "And let's clear up another falsehood. The talk about lsaac being unhappy with her? That's absolute nonsense."



Thinking back to what he'd witnessed earlier atthe bar, Slater allowed a smile. "If anything, Isaac looks more than pleased with Dr. Willis."


Fletcher's expression tightened with uncertainty."SO everything I've heard about her...are you saying none of it's true?"



Slater thumped his chest with confidence. "That's right, Dad. You can believe me-those stories are nothing but gossip."


Marietta leaned in and asked sharply, "Then tell us,how exactly did youlearn all this?"


Every eye at the table shifted to Slater, waiting for his explanation.



Slater went on to recount what had unfolded earlier that night.


When he finished, the group grew quiet until Barrie finally let out a weary sigh. "What are we supposed to make of this? Should we still be stepping into Alec's club issues?"



After a moment of thought, Barrie tapped his cane against the ground, his thick white brows knitting ìtogether. "Alec is Dr. Willis' father, and Dr. Willis herself saved me. If that's the case, I can't simply turn a blind eye."



Fletcher noticed the hesitation in his father's voice and spoke carefully. "Dad, if Isaac moves against the Willis family not because he dislikes Verena, then he must have another reason. Why don't we ask Beckett to hold off on shutting down the Willis Group's club for a couple of days? We can wait until we hear Isaac's side before deciding what to do. How does that sound?"



Barrie rolled the bead at the top of his cane between his fingers, and then gave a firm nod. "We'll do it that way."



The following morning, inside the CEO's office at Willis Group, Alec sat behind his desk. Days of sleepless nights had left him thinner, with heavy shadows beneath his eyes. He looked more exhausted than ever.



Before one crisis calmed, Bennett Group swooped in and took several key projects right out from under him.



Problems were piling up everywhere, and Alec struggled to keep the company afloat.


By dawn, he was already on the phone, calling old partners and anyone with influence still left in his contacts. Whether it meant leaning on friendships or lowering himself with flattery, Alec refused to miss a single chance to fight for Willis Group's survival.


Alec forced a stiff smile as he spoke into the phone."Have you eaten yet? If not, let me treat you. And if meeting is a hassle, I can always send breakfast over."



The voice on the other end was rude. "Forget it, Mr.Willis. Let's not waste time. If this is about your club,then don't bother calling again."



A twitch crossed Alec's face. "We've been partners before. Couldn't you at least-"



The call cut off before he could finish.


"Hello? Hello?" Alec pressed the phone back to his ear, but the line was dead. HHe tried calling back, only to be ignored.


Even those who once called themselves friends wanted nothing to do with him when things turned bleak.



His complexion drained, Alec quickly moved to dial the next number.


"Hey, are you free this week? Let's grab a meal. Pick any place you like-"


The voice on the other end cut him off, speaking briskly. "Alec, don't bother with small talk. I know the issues of your club have got you stressed, but there's nothing I can do."


His knuckles tightened on the edge of the table."When you launched your company, I was the one who stood as your guarantor. Now that Willis Group is in trouble, you can't just turn away like this."


The man on the other end answered, "Of course l remember what you did for me, Alec. But things are different now. Beckett is carrying out lsaac's orders.l may know Beckett, but not nearly well enough to sway him."


Alec heard the dismissal beneath the polite tone.Realizing there was no use dragging it out, he muttered a few half-hearted thanks before hanging up.


A wave of anxiety gripped Alec so tightly that his vision blurred, and he quickly reached for a bottle of pills, forcing a few down.


Just then, his phone buzzed. For days he had been the one dialing number after number, so the sight of an incoming call felt almost strange.


Without bothering to check who it was, he snatched up the call.


"Alec, I've got some good news for you," a cheerful voice remarked.



Hope flickered in his chest as he asked quickly "What news?"



"You've been worried about your club being shutdown, right? I had a friend close to Beckett dig around, and they just told me the Lyons family stepped in. They convinced Beckett to ease up and lift the lockdown for now."



Shock and joy hit Alec all at once, and he shot to his feet. "The Lyons family? Are you sure this is solid?"


"Of course. You think I'd play around with something like this?" The caller reassured him.



The certainty in the voice left Alec convinced. The problem wasn't gone completely, but for now,he had some breathing room. At least Isaac hadn't slammed the doors shut permanently in one decisive move,which was exactly what Alec had been dreading.



Relief spilled out of him in a long exhale. "You're right, I overreacted. Thank you for this. I owe you a big meal soon."


After ending the call, Alec pressed his fist against his forehead, confusion creeping in. He had thought the Lyons family wanted nothing to do with him, maybe even held a grudge. So why step in now? Whatever their reason, he knew he needed to call them himself-both to thank them and to understand what game they were playing.


Alec dialed the Lyons family's private number.


Inside the Lyons residence, Slater was halfway through breakfast with Barrie when the house phone began to ring.



"Who's calling so early?" Slater murmured as he tore off another bite of bread.



The butler checked the screen and answered, "It's Alec Willis."



Slater arched a brow, already guessing the reason behind the call.


"Hand it to me," he said, reaching for the phone.


Barrie shot him a warning look. "Slater, don't fool around."



"| won't," Slater assured quickly. "But Alec deserves to hear the truth." With that, he accepted the phone and hit the answer button. Alec's voice came through, formal and steady. "Good morning. Is Mr. Barrie Lyons available?This is Alec Willis, CEO of Willis Group."


Slater leaned back in his chair, answering casually,"My grandfather's right here. Say what you need-he can hear you."


"Alright," Alec replied, hesitation creeping into his tone. "A friend told me the lockdown on our club was lifted for now. Did Mr. Barrie Lyons make that happen?"



Slater straightened his posture, responding clearly,"Yes. My grandfather did intervene."


Alec opened his mouth to thank Barrie, but Slater cut in before he could. "If you want to thank someone,thank Dr. Willis. You're fortunate to have such a daughter."


A small crease appeared between Alec's brows. Dr.Willis...


The thought slipped out before he could stop  himself. "Could it have been Kaia..."



"Hold on!" Slater chimed in sharply. "Don't go assuming Kaia is the one behind everything good.Last I checked, you've got more than one daughter."
###Chapter 79 Unbelievable Facts





Slater spoke plainly, and Alec immediately sensed the weight behind his words. A deep crease formed between his brows as a startling thought struck him -could it really be Verena?


Silence lingered on the line, and Slater could almost hear Alec wrestling with the idea.


A sharp laugh carried through the phone as Slater chimed in, "Come on, Mr. Willis. You've already guessed it. The truth is exactly what you're afraid of.It wasn't Kaia who healed my grandfather's leg. It was Verena Willis. If you're desperate to hand out thanks, direct them to your eldest daughter instead of pretending Kaia deserves the credit."



Normally, Slater wouldn't waste his time picking apart a wealthy family/'s private squabbles. But when it came to Dr. Willis, he made an exception.


Hearing that name spoken with such certainty jolted 
Alec. It was as if someone had splashed ice water over him. His hand clenched the phone so tightly that it shook.


Disbelief twisted his mouth as he muttered, "No...that can't be right. Verena? How could that be possible? Isn't this some mistake? She grew up tucked away in a forgotten little town, learning scraps of medicine from a village doctor. Don't tell me she was capable of curing a condition even the top hospitals couldn't fix. That's absurd..."


"What nonsense about some village doctor and a few scraps of medicine?"


A flicker of amusement crossed Slater's face at Alec's refusal to accept the obvious. No matter how plainly he laid it out, the man clung to denial like it was a lifeline.


A harsh laugh slipped out, dripping with contempt."So that's what you've convinced yourself of? Just idle gossip picked up from people who don't know the first thing about Dr. Willis? I've heard those stories too, but they're nothing but blind ignorance. The real irony is this-those strangers have an excuse. You don't. You're her father, and yet you can't even name a single skill your daughter has. Tell me, Mr. Willis, what kind of father looks away so carelessly?"


Without pausing for an answer, Slater pressed harder, his voice as sharp as glass. "In Shoildon,everyone's heard the praises sung for Kaia. They boast about her spot at the nation's top medical university, her studies under a famous professor. But here's what no one talks about. Back in Clokron,years ago, Verena was the lead surgeon who opened my grandfather's chest and gave him a new heart.That's the woman you've been overlooking."


Alec's eyes widened in disbelief. Surely this couldn't be real.


In his sudden panic, he stumbled backward,bumping into his chair before collapsing into it.


His brow furrowed deeply as he blurted out, "That makes no sense. Your grandfather's heart surgery was far too dangerous for any local doctor to even consider. How could Verena have handled something like that? And wasn't she always stuck back in our hometown? When did she even have the chance to go overseas?"


The questions spilled out one after another, directed at Slater, but just as much at himself.


Finding Alec's frantic denial almost entertaining,Slater chuckled. "Mr. Willis, she's your daughter. If you don't even know what she's capable of, why on earth would I be the one to tell you?"


Without another word, he ended the call.


A flat tone rang through Alec's ear as the line went dead. He stayed frozen for a long moment, phone pressed against him as if hoping the voice would return.


Finally, he slammed the device onto the desk,dropped his elbows to it, buried his fingers in his hair,and bowed his head low. Everything he thought he knew about his eldest daughter had just unraveled.

 
Only then did it hit him-he had lived like a man walking blind. He had never truly tried to understand Verena. Before she was seven, he and Laura had spent most of their time away working, coming home only on holidays, treating family time like a rare luxury. When she reached that age, Kaia was born,and his business took off, pulling his attention even further away.


As the years went by and the family finally settled in Shoildon, Kaia quickly became the apple of their eye.Then Luka was born, completing the picture-perfect family of four. With a cherished son and a celebrated daughter, Verena became little more than a shadow.


When they did call her, the conversations were shallow, filled with praise for Kaia's kindness or Luka's cleverness, but never once did they ask Verena about her own life.



The memories twisted his expression into something bitter and pained. His chest tightened with the weight of it all.


He remembered bringing Verena into Shoildon, only to hear Laura constantly boast of Kaia's brilliance while treating Verena like a burden. As he thought back now, Verena must have seen the absurdity of it all, standing silent while her own mother dismissed her.


And yet, minutes ago, Slater had revealed the truth-that the daughter they ignored, the one pushed aside, was the very doctor who had performed a heart transplant and restored Barrie's health.


The blow landed harder than he could bear, and Alec struck his forehead with a clenched fist.


Regret poured through him, thick and merciless, as though something priceless had slipped forever from his hands.







After Kaia's explosive outburst the night before, she had gone out of her way to avoid her mother.


Confusion lingered at the back of Laura's mind, but she was far too distracted to think about it.


Her attempts to reach Verena that day had failed one after another, each call ending without an answer.


The irritation gnawed at her until her body felt heavy with fatigue.


Later, after rinsing off in the shower, she sat before her vanity, smoothing skincare across her face while deciding she'd try Verena's number one final time before turning in.


The sound of the door unlocking startled her just as she reached for her phone.


When she looked over, Alec stepped inside, and her surprise slipped into her voice. "Alec? What brings you home tonight?"


Not once since the closure of the club had he returned during the evening.


Alec offered no reply. Instead, he set his briefcase down and sank heavily onto the sofa in their bedroom.



Laura walked toward him cautiously. "Did you have dinner yet? I can ask the staff to fix you something if you haven't."


His head moved in a firm shake, but his lips remained sealed.



It took her a moment to realize that his silence wasn't ordinary. As she drew closer, she caught sight of the storm clouding his features-his forehead creased,his brows drawn into a knot, and faint new lines had carved themselves into his skin.


Being someone who knew how to read faces, she lowered her tone and asked carefully, "Alec, what's happened? Did more trouble come up with the club?"


His answer came slowly, his voice heavy with exhaustion. "No. That part's been taken care of."



Laura didn't catch what he'd mumbled, so she leaned in."What was that?"



Alec finally raised his eyes to meet hers. "The matter with the club-it's been taken care of."



For a second she just stared, stunned, before her whole face lit up. "Are you serious? That's incredible

 news!"



She slipped onto the sofa beside him and clasped his arm."Then why do you look like the world's ending?You nearly gave me a heart attack with that expression."


No hint of joy touchned Alec's face. His hands dug into his knees as he murmured darkly, "It was Verena who solved it."



Shock flickered across Laura's eyes, but it quickly melted into smug satisfaction.


"Hmph. That ungrateful girl. I thought she'd abandoned us altogether since she ignored all my calls. But clearly she's worried about her future with the Bennett family and realized she still needs our backing."



She brushed her fingers through her hair with a self-satisfied air.since she showed some sense this time, I'll overlook her rudeness and pretend she never avoided me."


Alec turned his head sharply, shooting her a look. The way Laura spoke of Verena carried such disdain it was as though the girl were something dirty clinging to her shoes.


That tone stirred a memory in Alec. Years ago, when he had tried to bring his mother and Verena from their small rural town to Shoildon, Laura had stopped him every time with one excuse after another.


She had said, "They're comfortable with country life.City living would only trouble them." Then, another time, "We're too busy with work, and Kaia and Luka need us. We don't have the energy to care for them too." And finally, "Verena's a country girl.People here would only look down on her." Only now did it hit him -those excuses had never been truths, just deliberate barriers she put up.



The more he thought about it, the hotter his anger burned. If not for Laura's schemes, Verena would have been here years ago, and by now she might already hold a place of honor in Shoildon society.And the Willis family's standing might've skyrocketed. With that bitter realization weighing on him, Alec jerked his arm free from her grasp and leveled a cold stare at her. "Don't fool yourself. Verena didn't directly step in. The problem was resolved because she once gave Barrie a new heart and healed his leg.Barrie stepped in for her sake."


Laura shot to her feet, her eyes wide. "What did you just say?" 
###Chapter 80 We Owe Verena





Laura's shock quickly turned into outright denial.She shook her head again and again, blurting, "No, that's impossible! Verena never even went to college. She only learned a little medicine from a village doctor.There's no way she could carry out a surgery like that. Alec, you don't really believe Verena can slice someone open and cure them, do you?"



Every timne Verena's name left Laura's mouth, a glint of scorn flashed in her eyes.



Annoyance rising, Alec slammed his fist against the coffee table, his expression severe. "Slater himself confirmed it, and Barrie heard every word when l spoke with him. Do you understand who the Lyons family is? Do you honestly think they would bother lying to us?"



Laura faltered, her lips trembling. "That has to be a joke,right?" Deep down, she still clung to disbelief.


Alec lost his temper when he saw she'd rather dismiss it as a joke than admit Verena's skill.


He shot to his feet, pointing a finger right at her face as his voice boomed, "Do you realize how terrifyingly powerful the Lyons family is? Compared to them, our family is nothing less than ants underfoot. They wouldn't waste their time deceiving us!"


The sound of his voice reached her,low and steady,and it struck something final in Laura. Whatever comforting lie she'd been clinging to slipped through her fingers.


Verena's strengths weren't the problem. What unsettled her was the truth buried beneath it all. She had placed all her hopes in the wrong child. The daughter she'd cherished, praised, and protected with everything she had turned out to shine far less than the one she'd cast aside. And now, to recognize Verena's worth felt like dragging her own failures into the light, like confessing she'd been blind all along.


Her knees gave out, and she sank into the sofa, Her mind suddenly recalled her conversation with Verena when she'd just arrived in Shoildon, before the Bennett family ever met her.


Back then, afraid Verena would humiliate her without a proper degree, Laura had ordered her to lie to the Bennett family, to say she was a graduate of Acorith College of Medicine. But Verena refused, boldly telling them she came from Pine Hill University instead.



The memory of her own face, flushed with fury and disbelief at that time, came rushing back. Yet now...


Her fingers dug into the armrest as she forced the words out. "Could it betrue... that Verena really did graduate from Pine Hill University?"


The name alone made Alec's breath catch. His head buzzed as he stared at her in shock.



"What are you talking about? Say it clearly!" His eyes widened, and he gripped her shoulders hard,demanding, "When did she ever tell you she was from Pine Hill University? Why didn't you tel: me something so important earlier?"


Alec's grip bit into Laura's shoulders, sending pain down her arms, but the weight of his questions made panic burn far more than the ache.


"... when she first mentioned it after coming to Shoildon, she sounded like she was making up wild stories, so l dismissed it. And honestly, even if I had told you then, you wouldn't have believed a word of it either."



Rage twisted through Alec, his teeth grinding hard.He shoved Laura aside and hissed through clenched jaws. "Foolish woman!"


Without another word, he stormed straight toward the study.


Inside,Alec dropped heavily into the office chair, his brow locked in a hard knot. For the first time, he saw how blind he had been to his eldest daughter. Verena had never concealed the truth, but their arrogance had kept them from seeing her worth. They had brushed her off as useless, refusing to hear her out. Gossip spread outside, painting her as selfish and deceitful, and he let it seep into his own mind. Time after time, he blamed her in his mind for disgracing the Willis family, even regretting her return. And when Laura had driven her out, he had let it happen without protest.


A long sigh escaped him as he buried his face in his hands, guilt pressing down until it was almost unbearable. Everything he had worked for could have been within reach if only he'd shown Verena a fraction of care. Instead, he had destroyed it with his own hands.



Then his thoughts snagged on a new question, and his movements stilled. Where had all those rumors about Verena come from? Hardly anyone had known of her existence before. Why would strangers target her so viciously?


Lifting his head, Alec reached for the computer with trembling fingers.


He dug into the night, searching relentlessly, until one group chat screenshot stopped him cold. His fists curled tight as he enlarged the image to be certain.



The chat was filled with the wealthy young people of Shoildon.


But what froze his blood was the familiar profile picture attached to one of the names. His own younger daughter, Kaia.


A bitter laugh pulled at his mouth, sharp with disbelief. The girl who had always acted gentle and dutiful was in fact the one who had started all the rumors about her sister.


The realization churned his stomach with fury, and for a moment, he wanted nothing more than to confront her. But sanity clawed him back. For now,making peace with Verena mattered most. As for Kaia-her reckoning would come later.


After Alec stormed away, Laura lay restless in bed,unable to find sleep. When she finally turned over with the thought of making warm milk, a shadow by her bedside jolted her into a scream. Her hand flew to the lamp switch, flooding the room with light, and she froze once she saw who it was.



"Alec, you nearly gave me a heart attack." She pressed herself against the headboard, trying to steady her breath.


His eyes lingered on her in icy silence. The longer he stared, the more unsettled she felt, until at last he spoke. "We owe Verena. Tomorrow, you're coming with me to give her a proper apology."






At the Bennett Mansion...


Flat on his back, Bobby held his phone above him,staring at his chat with Verena.


His thoughts tangled as he scrolled through their conversations, every word stirring an unease he couldn't shake. The way Verena wrote, the tone-he couldn't help but picture Kaia behind the screen.


Then it struck him like a blow. "That's right... Kaia was the one who gave me Verena's contact."


He bolted upright, clawing at his hair in frustration. 
How could he have been so gullible? Kaia was never reliable-half her words were lies. Yet he'd swallowed them whole without a second thought.


If Dr. Willis and Verena were one and the same, but he somehow had both numbers, then one of them had to be fake.



Determined to clear it up, Bobby snapped a screenshot of Verena's profile and forwarded it to the Dr. Willis account, adding a question: "Dr. Willis, is this one yours, too?"


The reply came quickly. "No."


Bobby dropped his phone and buried his face in his hands.


Damn it. That meant the Verena he had been messaging all this time was most likely Kaia pretending.


For the first time, doubt gnawed at his own intelligence. Knowing Kaia's talent for scheming, he had still sided with her against her sister without once checking the facts. What an idiot he had been. Even if he hadn't said those cruel things directly to the real Verena, it didn't erase the truth-he had spoken ill of her.


And worse, in his petty attempts to oppose her, he had made himself look utterly foolish.


The more he replayed it all, the heavier the shame sat in his chest, until he wanted to tear his hair out.


No, he couldn't let it end this way. He had to talk with Verena and explain, to show her he wasn't the complete fool he had acted like. She had to see he wasn't beyond saving.


No wonder Isaac had lost his temper with him every time he spoke ill of Verena.
###Chapter 81 A Meeting Between Bobby And Verena

Bobby leaned over and grabbed the phone he had tossed aside earlier.

His thumbs began flying across the keyboard.

Verena sat at the hotel room desk, wrapping up her work when her phone vibrated once.

One glance at the screen showed a message from Bobby.

"Dr. Willis, are you free tomorrow morning? I need to talk to you about something important. Can I come by?"

Curiosity flickered across Verena's face. The truth was, she and Bobby weren't close enough for private meetings yet.If anyone else had sent that message, she might have told them to text her or just call. Still,Bobby wasn't just anyone-he was lsaac's younger brother. Spending time with him felt a little like previewing her future family.

Her lips curved into a small smile as she responded, "Sure, let's have breakfast together."

That single reply had Bobby grinning from ear to ear, his excitement practically spilling over. Without hesitation, he snapped a screenshot of the chat and forwarded it to Slater.
"Look at this! Did you see that? My future sister-in-law literally said she's taking me out for breakfast!"Bobby wrote.

Slater responded immediately, "What the hell, man? Tell me the truth-what did you do to Dr. Willis?"

Instead of answering, Bobby fired off a cute nodding emoji to Verena, and then ignored Slater completely,enjoying how worked up his friend would get.

A moment later, he hopped off the bed and pulled open his closet, already thinking about what to wear.Meeting his future sister-in-law deserved nothing less than a strong first impression.
The following morning arrived. With his schedule lighter than usual, Isaac asked the driver to take him straight to Verena's hotel.
Only a couple of days had passed since they'd seen each other at the bar, but for him, it already felt far longer.
When they neared the hotel, Isaac had the car stop at the restaurant nearby.

He remembered Verena once mentioned that this place served a great breakfast.

Rolling himself inside, Isaac was quickly greeted by a waiter who guided him to a quiet corner and placed a menu in his hands.
His eyes skimmed the list of dishes, but before he could order, a voice drifted through the partition. "Dr.Willis, I'm not late,am l?"

From the other sidecame Verena's gentle reply. "No, I just arrived."

Isaac's fingers curled against the menu. Bobby... with Verena? Why were they meeting?

A frown creased his forehead as confusion settled in.

Noticing his silence, the waiter leaned in and suggested politely,our signature breakfast might interest you."
Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac closed the menu and lowered his voice. "I'm sorry, something urgent came up. I'll have to leave."

Unfazed, the waiter kept his professional smile. "Of course. We'll be happy to serve you next time."

As Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit, he glanced sideways. Through the semi-transparent partition, he caught sight of Bobby and Verena seated across from one another.
His gaze lingered on Bobby, dressed in a sharp suit with neatly styled hair-a look he rarely bothered with unless the event demanded it.

Though Isaac's face stayed composed, his eyes stayed fixed on the pair. They were completely absorbed in conversation, never once noticing him watching.
lsaac's hands pressed harder against the wheels before he pulled his eyes away and rolled out of therestaurant.
Once he was back inside the car, the driver glanced at him through the rearview miror. "Mr. Bennett, shouldwe go straight to Miss Willis' hotel now?
Lifting his gaze only slightly, lsaac gave him a faint look before turning toward the window. "No. Take mehome."
Their eyes met briefly, and the driver shivered, though the car's heater was running strong.He quickly nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."
Moments later, the car pulled away from the curb and left the restaurant behind.
Verena cut into her breakfast, noticing the young man across from her stealing quick glances
Bobby nearly got caught and ducked his head at once.
A laugh slipped from Verena as she asked, "Why are you sneaking looks at me like that?
She added playfully, "Don't tell me it's because l skipped makeup today and look awful.
Bobby shook his head with force. "Not at al! My perfect sis... um... Dr. Wilis, you're honestly the mostbeautiful woman l've ever met- swear l'm telling the truth!"
The words "perfect sister-in-law" nearly spilled before he bit down and stopped himself.
Verena hesitated for a moment, and then let a small smile form. "| believe you." For a few seconds, Bobby couldn't take his eyes off her. Her quiet warmth left him feeling guilty
Inside, his thoughts spiraled. This was the same woman he had gone out of his way to reject, yet she was sokind, so patient-and she had even saved him. Stil, he had slandered her to her future husband and mother-in-law. What kind of monster did that make him?
at most In his mind, a shadowy figure seemed to hover above, tallying up every one of his mistakes. Groaning, Bobby dragged his hands through his hair as his face turned bright red right there at the table.
###Chapter 82 Was The Patient Actually Isaac


With his jaw tight and shoulders squared, Bobby forced himself to meet Verena's gaze, drawing on every ounce of nerve he had left.

"Dr. Willis, I owe you the truth." His expression was grave. "The real reason I came here today was to apologize."

Verena didn't stop to react, but a brief flicker of surprise passed over her striking features as she kept eating.

"I made a mistake before," Bobby admitted, voice steady but regretful. "I judged you unfairly and repeated things I shouldn't have. For that,I'm sorry."

Her brows lifted as she glanced at him. "Oh? And what exactly did you say about me?"

The question broke open the dam, and Bobby's words spilled out faster than he could stop them.

"Let me explain," he began, leaning forward as if pleading his case. "When I first learned you would marry Isaac, I figured I'd ask your sister Kaia about you. But before I even got the chance, I saw a group chat where people were already gossiping about your looks. I thought to myself that Isaac deserved someone with good looks. Right at that moment, Kaia chimed in, implying that you were unattractive and bad-tempered."

He paused briefly, glancing at V/erena's unreadable face, and then went on. "After that, she made you out to be a clueless country girl who never went to college and didn't belong in the city. J-ater, when she sent a surveillance video to the group chat, we were convinced you had plotted to ruin her appearance."

Bobby hurried to add, "But now I know Kaia twisted everything on purpose."

A long breath slipped from Bobby as his shoulders sank. "At the time, I honestly believed you were that kind of woman. I couldn't stand the thought of someone like that marrying Isaac, let alone becoming part of our family. That's why I went behind the scenes and reached out to Kaia. She didn't want youin Isaac's life either, so we teamed up to break off the engagement. But I let myself get played. Kaia handed me an  account and told me it was yours. She pretended to be you and chatted with me using that account.In those conversations, she painted you as loud, crass, and completely unfit. That's where my opinion of you came from, and I texted back a lot of harsh words. It was only last night that I confirmed that account wasn't yours at all."

Some wounds, he knew, didn't heal just because excuses were offered.
"Dr. Willis, I truly regret it," Bobby pressed on, his lips tightening. "I let myself be deceived by Kaia, believed rumors without checking facts, and ended up hurting you."
His head dropped, shame pushing his gaze to the table. "What's worse, I repeated her lies to lsaac and my mother, exaggerating them just to sabotage your engagement.I went too far."
His voice dwindled until it was barely a whisper, his forehead nearly touching the table as the weight of his guilt bore down.
The restaurant stayed quiet, every word sinking into Verena's ears. For a moment, she was surprised-but then her lips curved into a small, almost amused smile, as though she were unbothered.

"Kaia never had a good word for me from the start," she said evenly. "So it doesn't shock me that she spread rumors."

Bobby's head jerked up, brows furrowed, his voice rising. "You're not angry?"

His desperation was plain, his sincerity almost painful, but Verena only smiled and shook her head gently."Why waste energy on people who don't matter? The only thing that matters is that Isaac trusts me."

There was no bitterness in her voice, only a quiet grace that left her looking composed, untouchable, and dignified.
Unlike Kaia's bitter description of her, Verena showed none of that smnall-minded spite, which left Bobby feeling ashamed of himself.

Heat climbed across his face and neck until even his ears flushed red.

Clutching the edge of the table, his knuckles taut, he blurted, "Dr. Willis, I've said awful things about you to both lsaac and my mother. l tried in every way l could to tear the two of you apart. You have every reason tohate me. lf it helps, you can hit me or yell at me-'ll take it, as long as it eases your anger.. as long as youdon't despise me forever.
The remorse in his voice was impossible to miss, though Verena remained calm, her anger nonexistent
"There's no need for that," she replied with quiet seriousness. "People are complicated, and it's natural tohave selfish thoughts, You judaed me throuah Kaia's words, and that was your mistake, but it doesn't shockme."
Her eyes softened as she continued, "Still, Bobby, since l'll be your sister-in-law, let me remind you ofsomething: never rely on gossip to define a person. You only understand someone through time and youiown judgment."
She turned her gaze aside, a faint laugh threading through her words. "And lsaac? From the very start, hisfeelings toward me haven't changed. That means whatever you told him didn't shake him. in fact, youhelped without meaning to-you tested his loyalty for me.
Her remark carried a touch of humor.
The warmth in her smile made Bobby's heart stumble. The way her entire presence shifted when she spokeof'lsaac-so gentle, so genuine-explained everything. Of course she was the right match for lsaac.
But her lightness only deepened his shame. That was real grace, the kind he lacked. Compared to her steadiness, Bobby felt like a clumsy child, painfully immature.
Overcome with embarrassment, he lowered his head again until his forehead nearly touched the table.
Verena'watched him with amusement, and a sudden laugh slipped out.
For the first time, she thought lsaac's younger brother was oddly entertaining-enough to stir a small envyin her heart.
Then Bobby jerked upright, as though struck by a thought
"Oh, right!" he eclaimed. "Dr. Wilis, when you said you were treating a patient with leg paralysis at Slater's place-was it actually lsaac?" When she nodded, his eyes lit up. "So tell me, how is he now? Can his legs really recover?"Verena answered plainly, "it's still the beginning of treatment, so there's no final conclusion yet. But restassured, l'll give it everything l have."
Remembering how she had restored Barrie's leg, Bobby felt certain she could do the same again. Herpromise eased him instantly, and the weight pressing on his chest finally lifted.

###Chapter 83 Where Did You Go
After everything was made clear, Bobby and Verena ate their breakfast in silence.
Though Bobby still carried a trace of awkwardness and shame, sharing a private breakfast with his flawless sister-in-law felt like standing face-to-face with a childhood idol. Naturally, he was thrilled. Once he returned, he would surely brag about this encounter to Slater.

When breakfast was done, they went their separate ways.
Verena returned to the hotel, while Bobby drove back home.

The moment he stepped into the living room, Bobby caught sight of Isaac sitting squarely on the sofa,positioned directly toward the entrance, as though he had been waiting.
A flicker of surprise darted through Bobby's mind. At this hour, Isaac was usually buried in work at the company-why was he still at home?
Before Bobby could open his mouth to greet him, Isaac spoke first. "You're back."
Bobby's lips parted but froze midway, as though strung with silent questions. Had he heard correctly? Isaac showing concern for him? That was something new. Isaac had never cared about his comings andgoings.Even if he stumbled home at dawn after a wild night, Isaac never uttered a word. So why now...
Bobby shifted uneasily, stealing a glance outside as if expecting the skies themselves to signal an unusual omen.

Snapping out of it, he asked carefully, "Isaac, did you need something from me?"
Isaac's gaze lingered briefly on Bobby's overly formal suit, and then slid away. Without answering directly,he gestured at the seat beside him. "Sit."

Bewildered, Bobby obeyed.
Isaac lifted a cup of coffee from the table, his fingers curving in a deliberate grace. He blew across the Fun Merge surface, took a sip, and lowered his eyes. The rising steam blurred his vision, pricking faintly at his eyes.
After a pause, Isaac asked in a voice that seemed calm, almost casual, "Haven't seen you at the company lately. Something troubling you?"
Unlike Isaac's steady tone, Bobby's heart lurched. Troubling him? If Isaac ever discovered that each missed day at the office was spent dealing with his fiancée, Bobby's life would not be worth a dime.
Wanting no part in that danger, Bobby shook his head with all the force he could muster. "No, no, no,nothing at all."
He dared not even entertain such thoughts anymore-better to bury them where they belonged.
Isaac rested his fingers on the table's edge, tapping lightly. Each hollow thud sounded like a slow drumbeat.His gaze lifted, calm but probing.

"Out so early today. Where did you go?"

Bobby felt another chill crawl down his spine. What kind of perilous question was this? Why was Isaac cornering him with words that felt like a knife's edge between life and death?

Thinking of the harsh remarks he had once made about Verena, Bobby dared not confess he had just met her.

Scratching his head, his face flushed crimson, he stammered, "Just... personal matters. Isaac, please don't ask."

If Isaac pressed further, Bobby would have no courage leftto face either him or Verena. After all, hadn't he once warned that if Isaac truly married Verena, he would regret it? And yet-ironically-the one regretting now was him. Wasn't this like swallowing his own pride wwhole?
Bobby's halting reply was a far cry from his usual lighthearted manner.
Isaac's tapping ceased. He studied Bobby's awkwardness-the reddened face, the restless hands.

He knew Bobby's character too well, as his brother had stuck close to him since childhood.
And this expression-lsaac had seen it once before, when Bobby first entered high school and secretly admired a girl.

The resemblance now was uncanny.

Suddenly, Isaac remembered Bobby's strong opposition to his relationship with Verena. And considering his own condition now...

Isaac's Adam's apple shifted as he clasped his hands on his lap, his voice turning grave. "Bobby, I've always told you: the things you should not do, never do; the thoughts you should not harbor, never let them take root; and the desires you cannot force, never force. Before you act, you should consider whether your action will wound others."

The abrupt weight in his tone left Bobby startled. But he quickly concluded Isaac was simply scolding him for his past recklessness. With a forced cheer, he nodded. "I understand. I'l remember your words."

Isaac's brows drew together slightly as he searched Bobby's eyes, as though confirming his sincerity. After a long moment, he looked away, expression unreadable.

Silence thickened across the room.

Bobby admired Isaac more than anyone, yet feared him more than anyone too-especially when he wore that calm,impenetrable mask.

The stillness pressed in, leaving Bobby restless beneath its weight.

Feigning ease, he rose to his feet. "Isaac, if there's nothing else, I'll head to my room."

As he watched his brother's retreating figure ascend the stairs, Isaac narrowed his eyes.

Moments later, his cold voice drifted through the room. "Andres, prepare the car."



After breakfast with Bobby, Verena returned to the hotel and immersed herself in her work.

She was carefully sorting through her materials when the doorbell rang. A flicker of curiosity flashed in her eyes. Not long ago, she would have immediately thought it was isaac. Butever since Laura's uninvited appearance, she could not be sure whether the visitor was friend or foe.
Marking her place on the document, she rose to open the door
The instant the door swung open, a firm hand seized her wrist, and before she could draw breath, she waspulled into lsaac's lap,
Startled yet delighted, Verena gasped, "What are you-mph!"
Her words were swallowed by the cool press of his lips
He guided her hand to his shoulder, circling her waist with one arm, while his other hand skillfully turned the
wheelchair into the room and shut the door with finality.
The entire movement flowed with unbroken rhythm, not a beat wasted.
Though startled at first, Verena quickly melted into his embrace, her arms winding around his neck as shereturned his kiss.
It was urgent, yet tender, stirring a hunger that grew the more she yielded
lt was less a kiss than a search for solace.
Looking down from where she sat, Verena saw him gazing upward, lips pressed with unwavering devotion.lsaac parted her lips, gently catching her tongue between his teeth, drawing from her a shiver and a faintwhimper before he let go
The room was warm with the hotel's heating, and Verena, having come in from outside, wore only a light outfit.
Breaking from her lips, saac lowered his head, his nose brushing against her collarbone and bare shoulderHer slender frame and loose clothing made her seem even more delicate, as though one careless breathmight shatter her.
He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, and then stiled-calming himself as though resisting the pull of impulse
###Chapter 84 Let's Register Our Marriage Tomorrow

In Isaac's eyes, his action was born of jealousy. Utterly absurd.

Yet he had to admit to himself, the green-eyed monster had taken hold of him. He envied his own younger brother, of all people.

Bobby possessed the kind of background and capability that matched his own, along with the advantage of a strong and healthy body. Standing side by side, Bobby seemed far more fitting for Verena. Any woman weighing her options would almost certainly pick Bobby. And yet...

Isaac's arms tightened, holding Verena as though she were his anchor in a storm.

He would never permit anyone to steal her away-not even his own brother. That was a line he could never allow to be crossed.

His lashes, thick and unyielding, drooped and brushed against Verena's skin, leaving her itching, while his uneven breaths fanned over her bare shoulder, summoning tiny goosebumps.

Verena instinctively drew back her shoulders, her slender fingers tracing idle circles in his hair.

Her voice, husky yet soft, broke the stillness. "Isaac, you're different today... what's troubling you?"

She knew him well enough to sense it. That kiss earlier had not belonged to the lsaac she had grown accustomed to after his memory loss. Something had stirred him.
Isaac raised his head and brushed her lips with his own, his breath deep, steady, almost deliberate. Instead of replying, he countered, "Do you have feelings for me?"
His tone was serious, the kind of question not asked in passing.

Verena's lips curved faintly, her eyes carrying quiet mirth. "Why such a sudden question?"

The light in Isaac's eyes dimmed; her answer had evaded him. With deliberate care, he tilted her chin upward,his gaze lingering on her lips-rosy, moist, and impossibly tempoting. Narrowing his eyes slightly, his breath deepened. "Forget it," he murmured. "Whether you do or not, it's
enough that l love you."
And before another word could rise between them, he kissed her again.
This time, it was no gentle touch. He claimed every breath she drew, fierce and demanding, as though he
could tether her soul to his.
He held her so tightly their chests pressed together, each heartbeat a drumbeat of longing. Every motionevery inhalation revealed the cracks in his armor-his deep-rooted insecurity.
At last, their mingled breaths slowed, and silence reclaimed the room.
Verena, lips tingling and numb, gasped for air, her chest heaving before she steadied herself.
When she had gathered her composure, she gently lifted lsaac's head from her shoulder. "lsaac, truly...
what's happening with you?"
At first, she was only curious about his unusual behavior. Now, she needed an answer.
Isaac lowered his gaze, unwiling to unveil the truth. "it's nothing," he said softly. "Jjust some work matters
wearing me down."
His eyes glimmered faintly as he spoke, and Verena frowned. She could see right through it
Work matters wearing him down? For lsaac, who thrived on work like air? That excuse wouldn't convince asoul.
Her lips pressed into a thin line. "You...
Before she could continue, lsaac cut across her words. "Because of your family affairs, our marriage wasdelayed once before."
She blinked, unsure why he suddenly raised the subject, And then he declared, "Let's register our marriagetomorrow."
Not a request. A decision carved in stone. Verena studied him in disbelief, searching for a trace of jest-there was none.
"So suddenly?" she asked.
At that, a flicker of unease flashed through his eyes, his voice stiff. "You don't want to?"
Though caught off guard by his abruptness, once she collected herself, she nodded. "Of course I do."
The following morning, Isaac was already waiting outside Verena's hotel.
After dressing and gathering her documents, she was about to leave when a message from him lit up her phone: "Remember to bring the documents."
Ever since leaving her the previous day, he had been sending the same reminder, as though chanting a mantra, terrified she might have second thoughts.
Standing by the elevator, Verena typed back, "I know. If you scroll through our chat, you'll see you've reminded me more than twenty times already."
When she stepped outside, a black car waited by the roadside.
The driver, spotting her, hurried forward to open the door.
Verena offered a smile of thanks. Once she was seated, Isaac's first words were, "The documents?"
Half amused,half exasperated, she pulled them from her bag. "Why don't you hold onto them yourself?"
He accepted them, and only then did his tension seem to dissolve, a faint smile tuggingat his lips.
The car rolled forward toward the courthouse.
Isaac picked up her ID card, eyes resting on the photo. ID pictures often betrayed their owners-washed-out faces,awkward expressions. But hers was different. Her features were refined, her complexion smooth as porcelain. Dressed in a black jacket, she looked spirited, though the fit was slightly oversized, broadening her shoulders unnaturally-a borrowed garment, no doubt.
His gaze lingered. Verena noticed. Did he remember something? "Something on your mind?" she asked.

Isaac lifted his head, earnest as ever. "Very beautiful."
Verena blinked, taken aback, and then tilted her head. "That's all?"

Sensing her dissatisfaction, he hesitated before adding, "I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you."
Her laughter slipped out softly. He hadn't remembered the past. She nodded, saying nothing more.
Isaac frowned, unsure if her reaction was delight or disappointment.
She turned her gaze toward the window, catching sight of the card in his hand. That very card had been obtained under his insistence. On that day, she'd shown up in only a white blouse. Because ID photos required dark clothing, Isaac had wordlessly stripped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Seeing him scrutinize the photo a moment ago, she had thought he might have recalled a fragment of that moment.But perhaps... memories required patience.

Soon, the car drew to a stop before the courthouse.

They got out, Verena pushing his wheelchair forward.
Inside, the hall was quiet, with few people about. Following the staff's guidance, they filled in their forms.

Just as the final step approached, Isaac caught hushed voices behind him.

"Isn't it strange, marrying a man with a disability?" a man whispered.
His companion nudged him sharply, murmuring, "Shh, they'll hear you," before the two stifled laughter.
###Chapter 85 Public Declaration


Verena bent down beside Isaac, brushed a quick kiss across his cheek, and teased, "Snap out of it, dreamer.We're almost up."

The sound of her voice pulled him from his drifting thoughts, and when he turned toward her, a quiet smile spread across his face.

Their paperwork was finalized soon after.

An attendant handed over their marriage documents, and the pair left the courthouse with them clutched in their hands.

Verena lifted her copy proudly and nudged Isaac to raise his as well so they could snap a picture together.

Grinning brightly, she announced, "From this moment on, Mr. Bennett, you belong to me as my husband."

A strange haze lingered over Isaac as they left the courthouse, the reality of it sinking in slowly.

Everything felt unreal until Verena's playful declaration grounded him. Maybe their choice had been sudden,but there was no part of him that regretted it.

His head dipped, and a genuine smile curved his lips.

When he looked back up, Verena was already tapping away on her phone. He chuckled and asked, "What are you plotting now?"

Verena held her phone close to his face with a sly grin, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I'm telling the world,obviously."

On the glowing screen was her newest post: "Married to Mr. Bennett," with the proud photo of their marriage documents beneath it.

There was a light in Isaac's eyes, warm and full, and his chest tightened with something sweet, as if his heart had softened into syrup, slow and thick and impossible to resist. Pointing at the screen, he cleared his throat lightly. "Mind sending me that picture?"
Catching his meaning at once, Verena slipped the phone into her pocket, her expression deliberately puzzled. She pretended to frown and asked, "And what exactly do you need it for?"
The question caught him off guard, though it only took a second to realize she was toying with him.
A faint blush touched his face as he blinked and answered softly, "I want to post it myself."
His words slipped out so softly that the awkwardness in his tone was impossible to miss.
Heat rushed to Isaac's ears, and the sight of it sent Verena into a fit of laughter she couldn't contain.
She slipped behind him, leaned close enough for her breath to brush his ear, and whispered, "I already sent it over. Take a look at your phone."
Then, without waiting for a response, she gave the wheelchair a gentle push forward.
Pulling out his phone, Isaac saw a fresh notification waiting for him with her name attached.
Since he had silenced his device earlier in the courthouse, the message had gone unnoticed until now.
Tapping it open, he found the photo she had taken, and for the first time, he composed a social media post of his own.
His update read, "Fromn this moment, Verena, I am your husband."
The photo of their marriage documents stood proudly beneath the words.
Within moments, Shoildon's upper circles lit up with activity.
In the exclusive chat for the Shoildon's socialites, screenshots of Isaac's post spread like wildfire.
"Kailee, didn't your husband just strike a deal with Bennett Group? Were you aware of this?"
"You're kidding!"
"The Bennett family announced an alliance not long ago, and now they're officially married? That was fast!"
The chat turned into chaos, so much so that Kailee White's reply vanished under the flood of messages.

It wasn't until after the group chat was temporarily muted by the administrator that the group members noticed her reply. "I'm not really sure. My husband told me the wedding got pushed back, but obviously there's more to it than that."

When the group chat was unmuted again, the flood of messages started all over.

Inside the group chat for Shoildon's businessmen, new messages popped up one after another.

"Anyone else see the news about Isaac tying the knot?"

"I did! Thought my eyes were playing tricks from staring at reports all day."

"His decision makes no sense to me."

"Didn't he just move against the Willis family? I figured the wedding was canceled-so how did the registration suddenly happen?"

"The Willis family doesn't measure up to the Bennett family at all. Their eldest daughter is just a puppet.No way Isaac would want her."

"You're getting it wrong. The fact that he posted the marriage himself proves he values the Willis family's eldest daughter."

Meanwhile, in the wealthy young people's group chat, Isaac's post was screenshotted and sent around nonstop.

Shock filled the thread, with half the group dropping nothing but strings of exclamation marks.

"Kaia, can you believe it? Verena actually signed with Isaac!"

"Are my eyes broken,or did that really happen?"

"The girl from that nowhere town actually managed to land him."

"A country nobody ended up as Isaac's wife, and I can't even figure out why. What do I lack compared to her? And of all things, this is the very first post he's ever made! Ugh!" "Doesn't matter. She's probably nothing special to look at."

"Can you believe it? The golden boy ended up picking that woman. What a disgrace!"

Kaia scrolled through the flood of messages without typing a word.

Reading the insults aimed at Verena should have thrilled her, but Isaac's public declaration gnawed at her pride. Rage flared so strong she nearly hurled her phone, because deep down she knew lsaac was serious about this marriage. The certainty of it ate her alive with jealousy.

Across the chat, Slater's eyes narrowed as he read the comments, and he blurted out, "Unbelievable. Kaia's lies really kicked up a mess. How dare they drag Dr. Willis through the dirt?"

Closing the app with finality, Slater wasted no time and dialed Bobby directly.

The line connected before the first ring even ended.

"I'm losing it right now!" Slater exclaimed.

"Me too!" Bobby's voice echoed his frustration in perfect sync.

"Tell me, are wegoing to defend our goddess or not?" said Bobby quickly, his words tumbling out in a rush.

Slater didn't hesitate. "Damn right we are. Every single one of those people trashing Dr. Willis is going to regret it. And Kaia? She won't get away with it either."

Bobby's tone sharpened. "So, what's the plan?"

"Simple," Slater retorted. "Didn't you brag yesterday about snapping that gorgeous side profile of Dr. Willis?Hand it over. I need it now."

Bobby had guarded that picture the day before, brushing off Slater's demands. But now that it could serve a purpose, he sent it without complaint.

The moment the photo appeared on his screen, Slater's fingers flew across his keyboard, hammering out the words for a bold social media post.

"People keep underestimating Verena, but I've had enough of the nonsense. Time to clear the air. The truth is simple-Dr. Verena Wilis was the one who healed my grandfather's leg. Kaia's claim that she did itherself? Utter fiction. And honestly, who in their right mind would fall for such a lie?
Let's be real--those who act like fragile saints in front of others often have the darkest secrets. Reputationmatters, and l don't need to explain further. This so-called kind and gentle girl? She slanders her own sisterspreads lies, and pretends she's innocent, Tell me, Kaia, doesn't your conscience scream at you?Here's another thing. Some of you have been calling Verena unattractive, unpolished, just a country girwithout brains or background., Yet world-class specialists failed to solve my grandfather's condition, and shepulled it off. Does that sound lilke ignorance to you? Don't make me laugh. And about her looks-there's nodebate. Take one glance at this photo and you'll understand exactly why l call her a goddess."Slater attached the stunning side-profile shot of Verena and, with no hesitation, pressed the publish button
###Chapter 86 i'm Not Buying That Story
When lsaac announced his marriage online, it had already sent shockwaves through high society, setting off
a flurry of excited chatter among the elite.
So the moment Slater made his own post, the conversations exploded without missing a beat
"Wow, can you believe this?"
'ls this actually happening, or did someone mess up the details?
'I'm so stunned by this announcement, l almost dropped my phone!'
"ls something in the air today? lsaac just posted about his wedding, Kaia's innocent act got blown apart, andthe truth came out that Verena puled off a miracle for Barrie's leg. it's like every secret dropped at once!"
"Hold up, you're saying Verena really fixed Barrie's leg?"
"For ages, everyone claimed nothing could be done for Barrie's condition. Who knew Verena had this kindof talent?"
"Hang on, let's not overlook what's right in front of us. Take another look at that photo-is that reallyVerena? ls this the 'just alright' girl Kaia talked about? lf that's 'alright, sign me up!"
"Anyone calling Verena 'alright' clearly needs their eyes checked. Kaia must not have been payingattention."
'Now it all makes sense. No matter what rumors people spread about Verena, saac never budged. lf i foundsomeone with her looks and ability, i'd want to marry her, too!"
'So if that's how things are, then Kaia's been misleading us the whole time. Someone who can cure Barriecan't be just a small-town practitioner. On top of that, Verena is obviously gorgeous, and Kaia tried to makeus think otherwise. And honestly, who believes Verena never went to college? i'm not buying that story at
all "Imagine a sister starting rumors about her own family. It's wild how you can think you know someone and be so wrong!"

"Damn! I just remembered something huge!"

The comment sections exploded with replies, filled with question marks and demands for more information.

"Come on, out with it! Don't leave us guessing!"

The message came through instantly. "Didn't Kaia claim in the group chat that Verena was pretending to be a Pine Hill University graduate, calling her a liar? Now, with everything coming to light, it really makes you wonder who's telling the truth. If Verena managed to cure Barrie, maybe she did graduate from Pine Hill."

People jumped in, agreeing right away. "Honestly, you might have figured it out!"

Scrolling through Slater's post and the flood of incoming comments, Kaia felt her mood sour instantly.

By choosing to share it online, Slater had dragged her into the spotlight and left her to face the fallout like a criminal paraded before a crowd.

Every secret she'd tried to keep was now exposed in front of everyone, and Kaia, whose pride relied so much on her reputation,could barely stomach it.

Slater's decision to air the truth so brazenly left her in disbelief, her dignity stomped on in public.

Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles paled, resentment flaring in her eyes despite the color draining from her cheeks.

A sudden string of notification chimes interrupted her thoughts as so-called friends reached out.

Each message she read stung a little more, reminding her how quickly these people clung to whoever seemed powerful at the moment.

"Did you see what Slater posted? Is it true or not?"

"You weren't jealous enough to start rumnors about Verena, were you?"

"Why haven't you said anything about Slater's announcement, Kaia?" Kaia clenched her teeth so tightly the grinding noise cut through the silence like a warning.

The ones who once rushed to praise her, clinging to thin friendships and chasing approval when they believed she had saved Barrie, had now changed their tune the second things went wrong. Not one of them stayed loyal. They were nothing but hypocrites dressed up as friends.

Anger surged through Kaia as her grip tightened around her phone, her entire body shaking. The fury boiled over, and she snapped, "You wretches!"

Without a second thought, she shut off the screen and threw the phone to the floor with as much force as she could muster.
###Chapter 87 Come In And Take A Bath


Kaia's chest rose and fell in sharp bursts, every breath ragged and loud. Fury widened her eyes, and her fists clenched so tight that her nails pierced skin she no longer felt. The fire in her gaze burned far hotter than any pain her body registered.

Hatred thundered inside her, echoing like a storm without end. Verena's name pounded through her mind-over and over, relentless.

Each repetition carried the same venom, as though uttering the name alone could erase Verena from existence. It was always the same. Whenever Verena entered her world, something precious was stolen away.

Her hatred had no limits.

Verena had stolen their parents' attention with ease. Verena had been the one to heal Barrie's injured leg.Verena had won Isaac's affection without even trying, while Kaia had hidden her love for him for years. Why had he given his heart so freely to her rival? And now, Slater's defense of Verena's reputation had sealed her humiliation, parading Verena's brilliance while reducing Kaia to a pitiful joke.

A wave of helplessness swept over her, and she collapsed onto the bed, clutching the sheets with desperate strength.

Her teeth sank into the inside of her lip, the sting of blood flooding her mouth with bitterness.

Through the rage, her eyes gleamed with a dangerous resolve. She would never surrender.

If Verena's claim to fame was curing Barrie's leg, so what? Against Evelyn Rowe,the world-renowned medical legend, Verena's so-called brilliance would crumble.

Wendell had assured her that when Evelyn arrived at Acorith College of Medicine to give a lecture, a seat would be kept aside with her name on it.

No price was too high, and no effort too great-Kaia had resolved that she would claim the role of Evelyn's final apprentice. Once that happened, she would shine across the medical world just as Evelyn had. And really, what did Verena's degree from Pine Hill University matter then?

Bloodshot eyes gleamed with obsession, and Kaia's lips stretched into a smile that carried nothing but malice.



Her mind spun with ambition. Years of training under Evelyn would give her the credentials to pursue a doctorate at PineHill University itself, and the glory of being Evelyn's chosen student would crush whatever spotlight Verena held.

Kaia muttered to herself, "Those mocking me today will kneel and beg for my recognition someday."

.-.

Isaac slipped his phone into his pocket after uploading the post.

Verena guided him into the waiting car. The driver swung the door closed, climbed into his seat, and opened his mouth to ask for directions when Verena spoke first. "Take me back to the hotel, please."

"Understood," the driver replied with quiet respect, turning the wheel as the car eased onto the road.

From the back seat, Isaac's voice cut through, edged with the faintest irritation. just registered our marriage, and you still want to return to the hotel?"

Anyone else might have missed the shift in tone, but the driver had worked under him long enough to notice.

Without hesitation, he pulled over and stayed silent, making himself invisible.

Isaac pressed into the seatback, his eyes settling on Verena. His brow creased, and the hand on his lap tightened into a fist.

Amusement flickered across her face, and a laugh slipped free. That tiny habit of his, clenching his hand whenever anger or frustration stirred, had never left him, not even after losing his memories.

Isaac's eyes narrowed the moment her laugh rang out. To Verena, his look carried a silent protest that said, "We're already married, and you're still planning to walk away? Given my state,how could you laugh at me like that?"

Her amusement faded quickly as she steadied herself against the seat and leaned in toward him. "The registry gave us papers, yes, but that isn't a wedding. If I moved into your house right now, it wouldn't sit right.What would your mother think of me?"

Those words, full of reason rather than rejection, softened the edge of his mood.

His gaze dropped, taking in the liveliness of her expression. Almost without thought, he reached up, lifted her chin lightly, and said with a teasing curve of his lips, "So you're worried about my mom's opinion?"

The gesture caught heroff guard, leaving her lips parted in brief surprise.

Recovering quickly, Verena flashed a sly smile, her eyes glinting with playful charm. "Of course I am.Caring about her means I'm caring about you."

Her tone was bright, the kind of sweetness that tugged at his chest as if daring him not to give in.

Isaac fixed his eyes on Verena, the look heavy with curiosity that burned deep. Her playful manner was obvious, carrying the edge of a flirt. Could it be that beneath all the things she held close, there was also a real place in her heart for him?

Realization struck him hard, a rush of warmth igniting beneath his calm exterior. She cared about him-enough to care about how his family might see her.

The thought amused him, and his eyes gleamed with quiet laughter.

He let go of her chin and turned toward the window, pressing his fist lightly to his lips as though that could keep the laugh inside.

Verena tilted her head, catching the smile he couldn't quite hide. With a playful poke at his arm, she said,"Why bother holding it back? If you're happy, then laugh. Don't make me drag it out of you."

His lips betrayed him, curving upward even as he tried to resist.

Clearing his throat, Isaac caught her hand before she could poke him again. His voice lowered, tender but firm."What happens in my home is up to me. No one else gets a say. When you're with me, don't waste a thought on my mother or anyone else. Do as you like."

After a sort silence, his voice shifted. "Forget it. I've got a place in the Seraphina Villas. I live there alone.How about coming there with me?"

Traditional expectations never carried much weight for Verena. Since the papers were already signed,sharing a home seemed natural. MMore importantly, she had something planned for him tonight.

Her decision came after a moment's thought. "Alright, but we'Il need to swing by the hotel first. I want to grab mythings."

Seeing her agree instantly eased the tension in Isaac's mood.

"Good," he said with a short nod before turning forward and instructing the driver. "Take us to the hotel first."

The driver acknowledged the order and guided the car smoothly into the traffic.

Back at the hotel, Verena packed while the staff gathered her luggage and brought it downstairs.

Her belongings were simple-a single suitcase and a few pieces of medical equipment.

With everything loaded into the trunk, the driver pulled away, steering them toward Seraphina Villas.

Located in the finest district of Shoildon, the villa sat quietly apart from the city's noise, an oasis surrounded by luxury.

The room carried an understated sense of luxury, and the wide spotless windows, gleaming in the light,revealed the touch of frequent professional care.

"If something about the place bothers you, let my assistant know. Adjustments can be made anytime," Isaac said evenly.

Verena turned back to him with an easy smile. "That won't be necessary.It already feels perfect to me."
 
Then her expression shifted with sudden curiosity. "Where's the bathroom?" Isaac pointed casually toward the hall. "Straight ahead, then left."

He directed her to the guest bath, assuming she would prefer more space before settlingin fully.

With a small nod, Verena carried a bag toward the bathroom, its contents hidden from his view.

Alone in the living room, Isaac poured himself a glass of water and drank slowly. Minutes passed in silence,and he finally leaned forward to call out when her voice drifted from behind the bathroom door."Isaac,come in and take a bath!"
###Chapter 88 Kiss Me If You Want


A sharp clink rang out as Isaac's grip slipped, sending the glass tumbler toppling onto the coffee table with a noisy crash. Water splashed out, soaking into his trousers and leaving a dark, unmistakable patch.

Color rushed to Isaac's cheeks as he scrambled to retrieve the glass. He cleared his throat, pretending nothing was wrong, and answered Verena, "N-no, that's alright. I'll take a bath on my own later."

Marriage paperwork might have been finished, but that did not make it easy for lsaac to let go of his self-doubt or bare his vulnerabilities so quickly, even for something as simple as a shared bath.

The house wNas quiet, which made it easy for Verena to catch every/bit of the scene outside the bathroom.

A suspicion grew in her mind that lsaac had missed her meaning entirely, and she decided to have some fun with him.

Moving toward the bathroom door, she folded her arms and leaned against the frame. Her lips curled in a teasing smile as she watched him closely, her eyes bright and mischievous.

"Isaac, the bath is ready. We just got married today, and you're already planning to leave me hanging? Isn't that just a little bit heartless?" she said, her voice softening as she stretched out the last part like a playful complaint.

From the very beginning, Verena always seemed to know the perfect way to keep him off balance. That was what Isaac believed.

Isaac knew his own body's limits better than anyone. Even though Verena had seen the damage to his legs countless times, he still felt uneasy about letting her see all of him. There was more to it, too. Living with the reality of his condition, he dreaded the idea of exposing his physical shortcomings, especially when it came to intimacy. The thought only deepened his sense of shame.

"Isaac, come on, don't leave me waiting. The water is going to turn cold soon. Are you really going to let me shiver in here?" Verena called out, her tone playful yet persistent. Refusing her seemed impossible, but Isaac wanted to protest. Looking up, he caught sight of her open expression and gentle concern in her eyes. In that moment, every argument vanished, and he realized there was no way he could turn her down.

Isaac set his jaw, drawing in a breath for courage, and guided his wheelchair toward the bathroom.

Verena caught sight of him coming closer, one eyebrow arching upward while her lips curled into a mischievous grin.

When Isaac rolled inside, the scent of herbs greeted him, sharp and comforting. Steam drifted above the bath,hinting at the heat within.

For a moment, Isaac stared in confusion, and then the truth dawned on him and his cheeks reddened in embarrassment.

"Is this for treatment?" he asked, his voice quiet.

Laughter sparkled in Verena's eyes as she nodded, her face all wide-eyed innocence. "Of course. What else did you think I asked you to comein here for?"

Isaac's ears burned as he pressed his lips together,staying silent.

Amusement flickered in Verena's expression as she circled behind him, her arms slipping around his neck.Cool fingertips crept under his suit jacket, stopping at the first button of his shirt, playing with it teasingly.

A gentle chill passed through the thin cotton and settled on Isaac's chest, sending his Adam's apple moving up and down as he swallowed.

Every muscle in Isaac's body tensed, his neck stretching as he tried to block out the cold touch against his warm skin.

Verena leaned in close, her lips grazing the edge of his ear as she spoke with a light laugh in her voice."Surely you didn't think I invited you in here for something romantic, did you? Isaac, I just moved in, and you're already misbehaving?"

The first button was undone, and her hand inched further, starting to undo another button, but Isaac caught her hand and pulled her down so she landed squarely on his lap.

"Enough, Verena. You have to stop teasing me," he said, his breath growing heavier, voice low and warning.

Finally, seeing his face flushed and serious, Verena softened.

Her forehead rested gently against his as she whispered, "You don't need to hold back, Isaac. Kiss me if you want. It'll help you heal, you know."

No explanation was needed. Isaac understood perfectly what she meant about his health.

Isaac's grip tightened around her wrist as he brought his other hand up to cradle the back of her head.Suddenly, he leaned in, his lips claiming hers in a kiss that started soft but quickly grew deeper.

Before long, the bathroom was filled with the sound of their breathing, each moment more heated than the last.

After what felt like ages, quiet settled around them.

Breathing hard, Verena slumped against his shoulder, her mind spinning with disbelief. She had only told him not to hold back his feelings-she hadn't expected him to take her so literally.

Isaac's arms slid around her waist, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head, eyes lowered in affection.

Once she gathered herself, Verena moved to help Isaac out of his clothes, supporting him as she guided him into the waiting tub.

Steam rose from the water, which was tinged with the rich brown color of medicinal herbs, hiding anything beneath the surface from view.

That detail allowed Isaac a moment of relief, easing some of the self-consciousness he felt.

After soaking in the bath, heat colored Isaac's cheeks and sweat clung to his skin.

Verena lifted him gently, wrapping him in a soft robe as he reached for the wheels of his chair to leave.She placed a gentle hand on his arm to stop him.

"Hold on, you're not done yet. The herbal bath is just the start. You need a massage next, and after that, a special treatment. Let's begin with your legs."

Taking a seat nearby, she loosened the robe and began working her hands over his legs, her fingers skillfully pressing and kneading each spot.

Her touch moved up from his ankle, pausing at key points that might help his body heal and regain strength.

Even though his legs were numb, watching her careful, attentive movements made Isaac's throat tighten, his Adam's apple moving twice as he gripped the sides of the chair.

Sweat dotted his forehead by the end of the massage. Once finished, Verena rolled his chair toward the elevator and together they rode upstairs.

As the doors opened, she glanced his way and asked, "Which one is our room?"

Hearing her say "our room" sent a small shock through Isaac. The simple words made it clear-she had no plans for separate bedrooms.

A subtle smile threatened to break through Isaac's tightly closed lips. Her words made it clear she had forgotten his warning from the very first day they met. Deciding not to bring it up, he chose to let it slip from his mind as well.

A nod toward the far end of the hall signaled the answer. "Our room is at the very end," he remarked.

Verena, walking just behind him, missed the way happiness flickered across his face.

They entered together, and Verena moved quickly to help lsaac onto the bed before reaching into her medical kit for a set of needles, ready to begin the special therapy.

Throughout the treatment, she checked in as always, asking him what he could feel.

As usual, Isaac shook his head. However, this time, with warmth lingering from the herbal soak, he failed to notice the faint burning that flickered through his legs.

Once the last needle was removed, Verena neatly packed away her tools.

Isaac grabbed his phone. A glance at it revealed a long list of missed calls waiting on the screen.
The number surprised him-more than a dozen, and every one came from Bobby.Isaac's brow creased as he stared at the notifications
Opening the chat app, he found message after message piled up from Bobby, nearly twenty in all. Each onerepeated the same thing: "You and Dr. Willis got married!"
Isaac pressed his lips together again, puzzled by Bobby's excitement over the news.Casting a look at Verena, lsaac's eyes danced with amusement as he typed his reply to Bobby, "She's yoursister-in-law now. You'd better get used to it."
Bobby could hardly believe what he was reading. lsaac was clearly acting smug about itDeciding to push back, Bobby responded deliberately, "Not happening.Two words summed up his rebellious mood. Only behind the safety of the screen could Bobby get away withthat attitude. Deep down, he knew his place-timid in person, but unexpectedly daring when hiding behind screen.
###Chapter 89 Let's Sleep


As evening drew its curtain, a family helper arrived to prepare dinner. After the meal, she quietly tidied the kitchen and slipped away.

In the master bedroom stood a computer desk, a perfect spot for working before drifting into dreams.

Verena held two books on neurology, their spines bent and corners worn-clear footprints of constant use by their owner.

Pointing toward the desk, she asked softly, "Isaac, may l use your computer?"

Isaac,leaning against the headboard with a book in hand, nodded with calm ease."Suit yourself."

Verena answered his nod with a smile, and then seated herself at the desk, meticulously sorting out medical cases akin to lsaac's condition.

Time ticked away unhurriedly, the room hushed except for the rustle of turning pages and the steady tapping of keys.

Isaac's book lay open on the very first page, while the sound of flipping paper came from Verena's corner.

His gaze lingered on her back, absentminded, as though his thoughts had wandered far.

The house had a proper study, yet she had chosen to remain here, in the same room with him.

He sat reading at the bedside, while she worked earnestly within his sightline.

The moment carried the air of a dream-a fleeting glimpse of what ordinary couples might call daily life,something Isaac once thought beyond his reach.

And yet, by grace or chance... the quiet murmur of paper and the rhythmic clatter of keys testified that it was no mirage.

A faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes softening as they rested warmly on Verena. Just then, Verena stretched her arms overhead, stood up, and was about to turn around.
Startled, Isaac, as though caught red-handed, dropped his gaze and buried himself in the book, pretending to read.
Fresh from her plunge into intricate medical notes, Verena failed to notice Isaac's sudden shift in demeanor.
Rubbing her neck, she murmured, "I'Il go take a shower. If you're tired, go ahead and sleep."
"Okay," Isaac replied quickly. Only after his word left his lips did he realize she had already stepped into the adjoining bathroom.
Take a shower...
Soon after, the steady sound of water reached him.
A thought flared in Isaac's mind, and with it came a rush of heat; his ears burned crimson.
He couldn't help the imagination. Until now, no one else had ever set foot inhis private bathroom.
And now... someone who stirred his heart had entered.
The rooms at Seraphina Villas were smaller than those at the Bennett Mansion. On this quiet night, the sound of running water seemed as though it poured right beside him.
He could even picture whether Verena was rinsing shampoo or washing with body wash each time the water paused.
Isaac swallowed, closed his eyes, drew in deep breaths, and then exhaled slowly befóre reopening them.
He looked down again, only to see the corner of his book crumpled, though he couldn't recall when his hand had done it.
Then,without warning, the bathroom door swung open, and steam drifted out like a light veil.
Verena emerged, her hair already dried. Silken strands cascaded down her back, and she wore a light set of pajamas.
Carrying a fresh fragrance with her, she walked to the bed. Isaac drew in another breath, realizing only now how agreeable his own body wash smelled.
"You're still awake? What's so captivating in that book?"

Her voice reeled him back from his thoughts. Isaac looked up to see Verena leaning forward to peek at his reading.

As she drew closer, he hastily smoothed out the wrinkled page with his hand.

Her slight bend brought her long hair spilling over her shoulders, brushing against his nose, her breath warm upon his arm-sending an involuntary shiver through him. Isaac had never been this near to another woman,nor had he felt a tension that strung every nerve taut.

Abruptly, with a snap, he shut the book.
"Oh, nothing special-just skimming. Let's sleep," he said quickly, placing the book on the bedside table before lying flat, steadying himself with both hands.

 ###Chapter 90 How Many Relationships Have You Been In Before
Verena arched an eyebrow in slight puzzlement, brushing the thought aside like dust on a shelf.
She slipped into bed from the far side, switched off the lamp, and asked lightly, "I've grown used to sleeping with a night light on. WouId that bother you?"
She knew Isaac never minded a light in the past, but that was before memory loss rewrote parts of him.Since time had passed, she thought it wise to confirm whether his old habits still held.

Isaac paused, caught unprepared by her question. Darkness had always been his ally; when waking from a nightmare, the blackness convinced him the terrors were nothing but shadows that would scatter with the dawn.

After a brief silence, his answer came low and steady."I don't mind."
"I guessed as much." Verena's brows lifted as she smiled and lay down beside him.

The heater hummed, filling the room with warmth. Their clothes were light, and when Verena shifted, Isaac's arm brushed against the lingering heat of her body.
The mingling of coolness and warmth made for a paradoxical harmony that unsettled him.

His breath caught; he fixed his eyes on the ceiling, lying still as if life had pressed pause.
Though his body was stiff, his thoughts tumbled restlessly.
The girl he cherished lay right beside him.

He could feel the delicate press of her fingers against his arm and inhale the faint fragrance of her hair.His throat worked, his teeth bit the inside of his cheek, and his breathing grew heavier without his notice.Seeing his blank gaze pinned to the ceiling, Verena understood his unease. With playful intent, she propped herself on her elbow, leaned closer, and asked, "Can't sleep?"
Her hand came to rest on his chest, her forehead brushing his chin, her breath fanning gently as if testing
his composure.
That sudden nearness made lsaac hyperaware-the warmth and softness pressing into him turned everybreath into a labor.
Awkward tension crept between them
When he still offered no reply, Verena reached to caress his cheek tenderly. "Why so quiet?
Her palm, soft as velvet, stroked his face as though he were a treasured companion.
Isaac lowered his eyes to study her intently
He was a storm of nerves, yet she was calm, almost serene.
Any ordinary girl, lying so close to someone she admired, would flush or falter.
But Verena remained composed.
Even sharing a bed, she carried herself with poise, still teasing him without hesitation.
To lsaac, it hinted at someone well-versed in matters of love.
A frown touched his brow as a sudden realization struck-he had never once asked about Verena's romanticpast.
At first, he found it needless. After al, their union began from mutual interests of their families
But now, curiosity gnawed at him.
Instead of replying to her teasing, lsaac murmured, "Can l ask you something?'Verena's eyes lit with interest. "Of course."
He hesitated inwardly. Would prying into her past make him appear insecure?
Would she mistake him for being improper, too narrow-minded?
And yet silence felt unbearable. She was not only the woman he liked but also the one he called wife.

He could not pretend indifference.

After wrestling with himself, he finally asked, hesitant yet firm, "Verena... how many relationships have you been in before?"

The room slipped into silence.

Isaac's fists tightened, a sheen of sweat dampened his palms. His gaze locked on her as though his very heartbeat awaited her reply.

Regret pricked him instantly-what if she disliked the question?

Catching his solemn expression, Verena chose to break the tension with a touch of humor. She teased lightly, "Three or four, maybe."

###Chapter 91 First Love

"Three or four?" Isaac repeated,a hint of disbelief making his voice climb.
His reaction gave away just how startled he felt.
Verena,quick to read between the lines, caught on to his question before he even finished asking about her dating history.
Jealousy had always been Isaac's trademark.
Choosing mischief over honesty, Verena decided to play with him, curious about what emotions she might stir up.
She watched as his brow knitted in disbelief, fighting back a smile while she kept the game going.
With a breezy nod, she replied, "That's right." She tossed in, almost carelessly, "But none of them lasted long. They were just temporary flings."
Isaac was shocked. Temporary flings! Did that mean those past relationships never mattered to her? And was he, in her eyes, just another fleeting chapter?
The thought left Isaac torn-on one hand, he was relieved there hadn't been real feelings before him; on the other, he wondered if she'd ever allow herself to care deeply for anyone at all.
And given his condition, he was unlike any of her former boyfriends.
He felt his eyes sting, turning his face away so she wouldn't see the emotion.
For a few moments, neither of them spoke. Verena looked up just in time to notice him angled away, hair falling over his eyes and hiding what he felt.
Knowing how possessive he could be, she could guess he was sulking.
Even so, she acted as if nothing was wrong, biting her lip and leaning gently into his arms. "Does it bother you that I've dated around?"

Her words came out fragile, as if she'd just been wounded.

A tight line formed across Isaac's mouth as he held back whatever he wanted to say.

Though he was the one hurting, all it took was that soft hint of pain in her voice for his heart to melt.

Something about it only drew him in closer.

Isaac wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, and his slightly trembling hands gave away the storm he tried to hide.

He rushed to reassure her before she could misunderstand. "No, that's not it. It's all about jealousy, and I'm jealous because I care about you-that's all."

For the first tie since his memory loss, Verena heard him put his feelings into words, jealousy and all.

His love ran deeper than she'd ever guessed.

Warmth flooded her chest, and her lips curled up in a tender smile."I get it," she whispered.

After a quiet pause, Isaac rested his chin on her shoulder and, unable to hold back, asked in a stubborn whisper, "So, none of those men ever truly mattered to you?"

Hearing the caution in his voice made Verena laugh. "I was only messing with you. There weren't three or four relationships at all."

The admission caught Isaac off guard. He'd braced himself for the worst, but as her words sank in, his tense expression softened, and relief washed over him.

A quiet joy spread through him, deeper than he expected-he couldn't keep from feeling pleased inside.

That was when it hit Isaac just how much he wanted Verena all to himself.

But the happiness was short-lived.

Meeting his gaze with a secretive smile, Verena continued, "Actually, it was just one." She let the words hang, the look in her eyes loaded with meaning. Isaac, caught up in the revelation, missed the nuance completely.

Stunned, he could only process the reality-one relationship, not several. That single truth struck him harder than any number ever could.

Having one person who mattered most changed everything.

His mood dropped, and his reply barely carried above a whisper. "Was that your first love?"

She let her fingers wander gently across his brow, tracing down to his temple, answering softly,"You could say that."

A flicker of memory crossed her features. Teasing, she added, "We never made it official, but the feelings were always there."

Those words-feelings always there-stuck with him.

Sadness clouded Isaac's eyes. Bitterness burned at the back of his throat, a tightness settling in his chest.

He couldn't help but wonder: if fate had brought them together sooner, would she have ever belonged to someone else?

Maybe, if they had met earlier, they would have been each other's only love.

But he knew there was no changing the past.

An ache flared in his chest, spreading like wildfire, and his limbs turned heavy.

He tried to play it off, muttering, "Alright, I get it," before falling silent and convincing himself he'd let it go.

Sharing abed with a woman, a light still burning, was a first for him-and surprisingly, it brought comfort.

He expected unease, but sleep came easily. For once in a long time, nightmares left him alone.

Verena woke with the sun, freshened up, and noticed Isaac stirring. She crossed the room to offer him a hand out of bed. Catching her by the wist, Isaac gently stopped her. "Don't trouble yourself, Verena. I'll have Jacob help me instead."
He couldn't stand letting her see any sign of weakness.
Typically,Jacob arrived a good thirty minutes before Isaac woke, always sanding by to help him out of bed and handle the morning routine.
"You might have to adjust today," Verena said with a gentle smile. "Jacob's waiting downstairs. I asked him to giveus some space this morning."
A flicker of surprise crossed Isaac's face. Before he could speak, she added in a soft, reassuring tone,"We're married now, Isaac. Let me take care of you."
Her kindness made his heart flutter.
Suddenly, the shadows of her past didn't matter so much. Whatever love she'd known before didn't change the fact that he was the one sharing every sunrise with her now.
She helped him into his wheelchair, waited while he got ready, and then guided him toward the elevator so they could head downstairs together for breakfast.
Midway through their morning, Isaac's phone started ringing-Cayden's name lit up on the screen.
Isaac didn't bother stepping away and took the call with Verena nearby. "Morning, Cayden. What's going on?"
On the other end, Cayden's enthusiasm was hard to miss. "Isaac, you won't believe what I just learned. After Slater made that post, I contacted the Lyons family. Turns out, Verena really did fix Barrie's leg! Who knew she had it in her? She really did graduate from Pine Hill University after all."
Cayden let out a happy laugh. "Looks like everyone who doubted your choice owes you an apology.Your wife is a real gem."
The pride in Cayden's voice was unmistakable.
Isaac found himself grinning at the mention of "wife," a new lightness filling his chest. His mood visibly brightened.

Across the table, Verena spread jam over her toast. Isaac couldn't stop looking at her, lost in thought until she noticed and glanced his way, confused.

He shot her a warm smile and answered Cayden, "Told you, she never needed to pretend."

Verena, seeing he was on a call, simply took a slow bite, her curiosity unspoken.

Sensing Isaac's protectiveness, Cayden admitted, "Alright, I take back what I said before. If Verena can heal Barrie's leg, she's more capable than any of us gave her credit for. Makes me hopeful about your own recovery."

Isaac's reply was soft and noncommittal."Mm."

A beat later, Cayden's excitement bubbled up again. "By the way, Stevie's back from Clokron this afternoon.He wants to take us out to dinner tonight to celebrate his return. Leonardo will join us, too."

###Chapter 92 | Want To Hide You
Stevie Wagner had been rooted in Clokron ever since high school.

Meanwhile, Cayden and Leonardo Gibson had remained in Shoildon, while lsaac had only returned from abroad half a year ago.
Once upon a time, the four of them were inseparable-bright stars sharing the same sky. Yet now, as lsaac lowered his gaze to his legs, a faint sorrow flickered in his eyes. Of them all, he alone felt out of step, a broken chord in their melody.

A gathering? Since the car accident, he had avoided every private get-together. Outwardly, he wore indifference like a cloak, meeting curious stares-subtle or direct-without flinching. But deep within, he could not fool himself; he knew he no longer stood shoulder to shoulder with the others.

Isaac opened his lips, prepared to decline his friend's invitation.

But Cayden, reading his thoughts, sighed gently and said, "We're friends-true friends, unlike anyone else.And besides, didn't you just announce your marriage online yesterday? Such joy ought to be shared.Shouldn't you celebrate with those who care for you?"
Isaac's brows eased slightly, his gaze drifting toward Verena across the table.

Sensing no objection, Cayden pressed on, "If your wife is willing, bring her along to dinner."
That single word "wife" stirred Isaac. The furrow at his brow finally loosened.

Shifting his phone aside, he turned to Verena and asked, "A friend of mine is returning to the country this afternoon. Tonight, we're holding a small dinner for him. They all know about our marriage and would like to meet you. Will you come with me? If gatherings make you uneasy, just say so. I won't mind."

He hesitated ever so slightly before adding that last line, and in his tone, a cautious undertone lingered.
He watched her quietly, as if bracing for her reply, yet secretly hoping for something more.
 Verena caught te weight of his emotions and sighed inwardly. Time and hardship truly reshape a person.The once proud, unshakable Isaac now wore his sensitivity like a fragile shield.

She refused to let this softer side of him be overshadowed by doubt, so she flashed him a bright, easy smile and agreed without hesitation, "Of course-no problem at all."
Isaac froze for a heartbeat, and then a smile tugged at his lips.
After breakfast, Isaac left for the office, while Verena retreated to the bedroom, immersing herself once again in her medical books.
By six in the evening, Isaac returned to Seraphina Villas to collect her.
He waited in the living room until the crisp click of high heels drifted down the staircase.
Glancing up, his eyes lit ever so slightly.
Verena descended gracefully, draped in a champagne-colored coat over a beige dress. Nude heels gave length to her step, and with today's careful touch of makeup, she seemed sculpted with elegance.
"Lost in my beauty?" she teased, waving her hand in front of him.
Isaac caught her hand, and before reason could intervene, the words slipped out. "I want to hide you."
Verena's lips curved into a playful smile. Leaning closer, she whispered against his ear, breaking the spell,"Careful-locking me away is a criminal offense."
Caught off guard by her comment, Isaac was momentarily stunned before he laughed and said, "I was just joking."
They exchanged a glance and both smiled.

...
As night fell, Shoildon's streets bloomed with light. In the city center, a restaurant glowed beneath warm yellow lamps, its sign reading "Bronze Rose."
Inside, rustic charm met refinement, while bursts of laughter from a private room carried into the hall. "Stevie, after all these years, still no wife?"
"I've been buried in work, you know that."
"Work? More likely you just can't decide which lady to bring back."
Their teasing drew a ripple of laughter.
The man at the head of the table-the star of tonight's gathering-was none other than Stevie Wagner.Clad in a light suit, his cheeks flushed crimson under their banter.

His eyes flicked toward the black velvet box before him. Clearing his throat twice, he steered the talk elsewhere. "By the way, what's the story with Isaac's social media post? We never even heard he was dating, and suddenly-he's married?"

###Chapter 93 What's The Deal With His Wife


"Also, what's the deal with his wife?" Stevie added.

Though he had been living abroad, distance hadn't cut him off from the whispers back home.

He had caught fragments about Verena, yet the full story still eluded him.

Cayden exchanged a meaningful glance with Leonardo, who gave a small nod, urging him to speak.

Scratching his head, Cayden said frankly, "It's a marriage arranged by their families."

In their circle, family-arranged marriages were as ordinary as breathing.

What sounded absurd to outsiders was, in truth, business as usual for people of their standing.

Stevie gave a slow nod, and then pressed, "When did they meet?"

Cayden took a sip of coffee before replying, "If memory serves, about two months ago."

"Two months ago?" Stevie's voice sharpened. He reached for the box on the table, rolling it between his fingers with unease.

That necklace-Isaac had asked him to commission it more than half a year ago, a gift intended for the girl he fancied.

Yet before fate could take its course, Isaac had suddenly returned from overseas and entered an arranged marriage instead.

So what now? Hand the necklace over or keep it hidden?

What a tangle!

Stevie's thoughts spun like a compass without a north. How had he landed in such a muddled drama?

As he wrestled with it, the door to the private room swung open. "Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, this way, please," came the clear, melodious voice of a waitress.
At the sound, all three men instinctively looked up.
Their eyes flickered past Isaac but settled-unanimously and inevitably-on Verena.
Cayden had seen her before, though then she'd worn casual clothes and almost no makeup.
But today was another story. She was carefully dressed, every detail considered.
His gaze lingered longer than he realized.

For Leonardo and Stevie, it was their very first glimpse of her, and they were caught unprepared-left momentarily stunned.

The champagne-colored wool coat skimmed gracefully over her frame, her hair spilled like silk across one shoulder, and her smile, though faint, carried warmth. In her eyes glimmered a touch of cool reserve,paradoxically making her all the more approachable, as though the frost concealed an unspoken fire.
Among the three, Cayden was the first to recover.
He stood up with a ready grin. "Come in, take a seat. We've been waiting. You owe us a drink later."
Leonardo followed quickly, returning to his senses.
Stevie sat anchored at the head of the table, with Cayden and Leonardo on his left. The right side remained vacant.

As Verena wheeled Isaac closer, Stevie, like a man concealing a guilty secret, hastily'scooped up the box on the table and slpped it into his pocket.
It was the very necklace Isaac had once commissioned from the famed designer in Clokron, Sophia Dixon.But just as the necklace was finished, lsaac had suffered his accident, and Stevie-bound by work confidentiality-had been unable to reach anyone.
When his duties were done, he'd meant to hand it to Isaac in person.
Who could have foreseen how much would unravel in the meantime?
Now, with circumstances as they were, presenting the necklace felt utterly out of placeStevie pushed the box deeper into his pocket, securing it as though to bury his own uneaseVerena guided lsaac to the chair beside Stevie, and then bent gracefully to drape a blanket over lsaac'slegs.
The simple gesture made the three men exchange glances-admiration and quiet surprise glinting in their
eyes.
Of everyone at the table, Verena was the stranger.
And yet, in front of his closest companions, lsaac clasped her hand. His voice softened, carrying both prideand warmth. "Allow me to introduce my wife, Verena."
At once, Cayden rose with an easy laugh, extending his hand. "Dr. Willis, who would've thought that the nexttime we crossed paths, you'd already be my best friend's wife? l hope you won't hold a grudge for my pasimissteps."

###Chapter 94 Was This Really How Arranged Matches Worked
With a gentle smile, Verena took Cayden's hand and held it firmly. "Dr. Moore, you only had Isaac's health in mind.Why would I take offense? There's nothing wrong with being careful."
Leonardo also stood up to greet her. "My name's Leonardo Gibson. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."He carried himself with a maturity that gave him a steady presence.
A faint smile touched Verena's lips as she inclined her head in response. "Nice to meet you, Leonardo."
Afterward,Leonardo chuckled and tapped the shoulder of the man at his side. "Here's the star of tonight's gathering-Stevie Wagner, back from his time overseas."

Caught off guard, Stevie froze for a second, and then jumped to his feet in a hurry. "Hi, Verena. I'm Stevie Wagner.Glad to meet you."

The words spilled out in a stiff rush, and his jerky movements made him look like a clumsy puppet, which drew laughter from the others at the table.

"You're still terrible at meeting new people, Stevie," Cayden teased with an easy grin.
Stevie's hand went to the back of his neck, and his reddened face gave him the awkward air of a shy student.

Reaching out without hesitation, Verena returned his handshake and smiled warmly.good to meet you as well."

Soon afterward, the servers brought in the dishes, and the four old friends slipped into lighthearted conversation.

The talk about a drinking penalty was nothing more than Cayden joking, since everyone knew lsaac's health didn't allow him to drink.

For the most part, Verena ate quietly, though she joined in whenever the topic turned toward her.  The three men filled the air with lively chatter, while Verena and Isaac focused on their dishes and, almnost in unison, served each other food.

Their hands paused when they realized what they'd done. Their gazes met for a heartbeat, and then both lowered their eyes and laughed softly.

The trio across from them couldn't miss it. They traded looks, each one buzzing with unspoken meaning.
Stevie leaned back with suspicion clear on his face. Was this really how arranged matches worked? First the blanket, and now sharing food? That level of closeness seemed far too much.

Cayden turned toward Leonardo, clearly searching for an answer.
Instead of helping, Leonardo only lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, as if to say he was just as clueless.When the meal was nearly finished, Verena rosefrom the table and excused herself to the restroom.

No sooner had she left than Stevie edged closer to Isaac and murmured, "I almost kept this to myself, but since you commissioned it, I'll hand it over."

Both Cayden and Leonardo stayed wrapped up in their own conversation, too distracted to notice the quiet exchange happening beside them.

Isaac's gaze dropped to the black velvet box that Stevie was holding out.
"What are you talking about? When did I ever commission this?" he asked with confusion.

Believing Isaac had forgotten, Stevie explained patiently, "It was a month or two before your accident. You called me and said you were chasing after a woman you truly loved, and you wanted me to find someone who could design a necklace just for her."
His expression softened as he continued, "Things didn't go as you hoped, but you already paid for it. What you choose to do with it now is up to you."

With no room for refusal, Stevie pressed the box into Isaac's hand.

Isaac froze, his gaze fixed on the box for what felt like ages, bewilderment and astonishment flickering in his eyes. A woman he had truly loved... had there ever been one? Stevie could be reckless and unpredictable at times, yet he wasn't the kind of man who would deceive himn, much less make light of something so serious.

Trying to force the memory to surface, Isaac furrowed his brow. Yet the harder he searched, the emptier his mind became. When had he ever been in love with a woman? Why couldn't he remember a single detail?

Shaking his head firmly, Isaac pushed the thought aside. "No. I never asked you to order this."

Stevie froze in disbelief, his voice pitching higher. "Isaac, don't mess with me. I've still got the proof of that transfer."

Opening his banking app, he shoved the screen toward Isaac and said with a teasing grin,"Look at this.Did you really forget? You wouldn't stop saying she was the only one for you."

The record left no room for doubt.

Meanwhile, Isaac's thoughts were completely blank.

Verena's cheerful voice chimed in as she walked back toward the table, "What are you two whispering about?"

Isaac's shoulders tensed. On instinct, he slid the small box into his pocket.

Stevie parted his lips, ready to brush it off, but Isaac interjected quickly, "Nothing important. I was just asking about his time overseas."

With an easy smile, Verena accepted the answer. "Alright then, carry on."

Stevie snapped his mouth shut and shot lsaac a side glance. Quick thinking, he thought. Isaac always managed to cover himself well. Still, the man hadn't actually asked him anything about life abroad.

By the time their gathering wrapped up, the clock had already passed ten.

It was late when they finally reached home.

Verena slipped into the bathroom for a shower, while Isaac wheeled himself quietly into the study.

Taking out the box, he lifted the lid. Resting inside was a crystal necklace, its flawless shine revealing a piece of craftsmanship far from ordinary.

Instead of admiring it, Isaac sat there frowning. If Stevie's story was real, how could he have no recollection at all? If he'd once been in love with someone, he would have told the girl honestly before agreeing to the marriage arrangement with the Willis family. Responsibility wasn't something he ever avoided. Yet his mind offered nothing, not even a trace of memory. And still, Stevie had no reason to lie. Between the bank record and the necklace, the evidence couldn't be denied.

Isaac pressed his hands over his face, and then stared blankly at the ceiling. Confusion clouded his eyes,and not even he could piece it together. He understood he should be honest with his wife about matters of the heart, yet he couldn't bring himself to let Verena see this strange part of his past.

Morning arrived, and Isaac left for work earlier than usual. Verena also rose at dawn, enjoying a rare stretch of quiet while tending to the flowers in the garden.

That calm was soon broken, as uninvited visitors showed up without so much as a warning.

The housekeeper, Rhonda Walker, hurried across the garden and called out, "Mrs. Bennett, your parents have arrived. They're waiting in the living room."

Verena's face remained calm. She had already expected this moment would come.

"Alright. Go on back to what you were doing," she replied evenly.

Rhonda gave a quick nod before returning to her chores.

Setting the pruning shears aside, Verena let out a faint sigh and headed toward the living room.

She hadn't even stepped inside when Alec's voice drifted out.

"Luka had a sudden fever the other day, so it delayed us. Now that we're finally here, be sure you speak nicely,alright?"

Laura seemed to grasp the seriousness this time. With less of her usual bite, she bobbed her head quickly."I get it, I get it. Don't worry. With the two of us together, she's coming home."

Leaning casually against the doorframe, Verena crossed her arms and studied the couple lounging on the sofa. A bitter smile tugged at her lips. Their little act could rival any Shakespearean performance, and real life seemed to be their favorite stage.
She stood tall and called out, "Why are you here?"
Her cold tone sliced through the room, and Alec and Laura instantly forced smiles as they rose to greet her."Oh, Verena, I've missed you terribly!" Laura exclaimed.
To Verena, the words dripped with hypocrisy. She couldn't help but think Laura ought to fear divine punishment for such insincerity. Then again, someone like her clearly had no conscience to trouble her.
Laura reached for her hand with false affection. "You've gotten thinner."
Verena pulled her hand away without a word and calmly wiped it clean with a tissue.
Their smiles faltered. Laura's eyes flashed with anger, though she quickly masked it.
Acting as if he hadn't noticed, Alec kept a gentle expression. "Please don't be upset with us, sweetheart.Just come back home with us. I'm begging you."
His voice cracked as though he might break down in tears, and his eyes glistened with sorrow.
Compared to Laura, Alec's performance nearly fooled Verena-it was that convincing.
Verena crushed the used tissue in her hand, and then tossed it into the trash with deliberate aim.
"Sweetheart?" Her lips twisted into a sharp smile as her gaze hardened. "What gave you the idea I was that close to you?"
###Chapter 95 Their Love Was Unreliable And Transient
Alec caught the sting of sarcasm in Verena's words, his facial muscles twitching as though struck by asudden chil. Though embarrassment gnawed at him, he stubbornly wore a mask of kindness and sincerity.
"Verena, l know why you refuse to come home. That troublesome girl, Kaia, has been spreading rumorsabout you, making others whisper behind your back. l am well aware of all the bad things she has done toyou."
At that moment, Laura didn't bother to shield her once-cherished younger daughter. She quickly nodded inagreement. "Exactly! Your sister is reckless and immature. Once we return, we'll make sure to discipline herproperly."
With a thunderous expression, Alec unleashed a torrent of harsh words at Kaia. "| never imagined that giricould wear suc a convincing mask, Before we brought you back, she always seemed obedient. But themoment you appeared, her narrow heart was laid bare, and now she has become nothing more than ajealous villain.
Seeing Verena remain silent, Alec assumed he had struck a chord, Pretending to wrestle down his anger, hesoftened his voice as though offering comfort. "Verena, don't worry. When you come home with me, !'lmake sure to give her a stern lecture right in your presence, and she will apologize."
Like actors reading from the same script, Alec and Laura steered the conversation until Kaia bore the fullblame for拓 every wrong.
Vena dar eyes stayed fixed on them, her gaze as cold and sharp as a blade, carrying disdain and achilling detachment.
In that moment, she finally understood the roots of Kaia's hostility
The love Alec and Laura dispensed was like shifting sand-unreliable and transient, here one moment andgone the next.
When Verena had first arrived in Shoildon, everyone treated her as a simple country girl, looking at her with indifference.

Alec and Laura were no exceptions.

In their minds, her worth was limited to one thing-replacing Kaia to marry Isaac, thereby completing a marriage of convenience with the Bennett family.

So when Kaia aimed her arrows at her, even though Alec and Laura knew the truth, they turned a blind eye.

Even when quarrels broke out between the sisters, their instinct was always to shield Kaia first.

But times had changed.

Now they realized that, beyond the marriage arrangement, Verena had other values greater than Kaia's.With thatrevelation, they shifted their stance with practiced ease-flattering Verena, appeasing her, and harshly chastising the very daughter they once swore to protect.

Their love was indeed no more solid than smoke in the wind.

No wonder Kaia felt fear and insecurity. She dreaded that Verena's appearance in their lives would steal what little affection remained in their parents' wavering hearts.

Thus,she tried every trick in the book to push Verena away.

Growing up under such a roof, Kaia was, in Verena's eyes, both pitiful and pathetic.

"You two truly are willing to stop at nothing to get what you want." The mocking smile on Verena's lips faded, replaced by sheer disgust in her eyes. "Words like insincere and filthy fall short of describing you.You're not bringing me back to the Willis family for my sake. You only realized the closure of the club was Isaac standing up for me. Then, when you saw Slater's social media post clearing my name,you finally understood I hold value-considerable value. That's why you're now willing to disparage Kaia just to win me back. If not for these two incidents, no matter how much Kaia wronged me, you'd still be twisting yourselves to cover for her instead of pretending to fight for me. Kaia turned out this way because of you both."

At those words, Alec and Laura were visibly flustered.
###Chapter 96 Just You And Me

Alec reacted swiftly, clutching his chest with theatrical flair. "Verena, how could you see me in such a light?I am your fath..."
Verena cut him short. "You two have been unsettling me for quite some time. I have no interest in watching your little play. Rhonda, please show them out."
Without granting them another glance, Verena turned on her heeI and made her way upstairs.
Rhonda stepped forward and spoke with a touch of awkwardness. "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, please leave."
The villa was Isaac's property, and Alec and Laura knew better than to stir up trouble or drag Verena down as though it were their own household.
They exchanged a fleeting look-frustration written plainly on their faces-yet, swallowing their pride, they had no choice but to retreat in defeat.
The uninvited visit spoiled Verena's mood for gardening, so she drifted into the study in search of a book.As she settled into the chair, her eyes caught a black velvet gift box tucked beneath the desk.
Curiosity tugged at her; she reached for it and gently lifted the lid.
Inside lay a delicate women's necklace.
A flicker of surprise crossed Verena's eyes, and then softened into a smile.    
Had Isaac prepared this for her?
Was there a hidden occasion she had overlooked?
She quickly checked her phone's calendar. Valentine's Day was far ahead, and her birthday had long since passed.
Unable to unravel the mystery, she closed the box and quietly set it back in place.
 She resolved to wait and ask him when the time came. Yet,after that day, Verena found herself watching and waiting for lsaac to offer the gift, but time slipped by,and he never did.
Her curiosity gnawed at her like a silent pest.
One evening, as she sat before the vanity, she remarked casually, "Isaac, don't you think my neck looks rather bare? My outfit doesn't seem to shine as much."
Hearing her, Isaac lifted his eyes from the documents in his hands to glance at her.
She wore a fitted top with a V-shaped neckline, her hair swept into a bun, leaving her graceful neck exposed.
Isaac shook his head, answering with calm honesty, "Not at all. It looks beautiful."
Verena paused, realizing he had missed the hint, and pressed on. "Don't you think a little addition would make it look even better?"
Isaac blinked,momentarily taken aback, before asking in earnest, "What shouldladd?"
Verena almost blurted out "a necklace" but held her tongue.
At first, she had thought he was keeping a surprise from her, but now it seemed he had completely forgotten about the necklace she had discovered.
She only shrugged with a light smile. "Never mind. It's nothing."
With that, she let her hair fall loose and rose to take a shower.
Isaac, however, sat puzzled, murmuring under his breath, "Is she upset?"
He replayed her words in his mind, pondering them until the realization struck-her gentle hints were a plea for a gift.
Reaching for his phone, Isaac dialed his assistant. "Jacob, there's an auction at the Shoildon Art Center tomorrow, isn't there?"

The following morning, just before leaving for work, Isaac told Verena, "I'll come home early tonight and take you out for dinner."
"With your friends?" Verena asked, assuming it was another of his social gatherings.
Isaac shook his head, his gaze bright with anticipation. "Just you and me."
"I see." Verena teased, tipping his chin with her finger and a playful smile, "A candlelit dinner, then?"
A soft gleam of mischief lit up her beautiful eyes.
Isaac's cheeks warmed, and moistening his lips, he gave a quiet
.--
By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, they arrived at a fine restaurant.
It was elegant, refined, with a violinist weaving tender notes into the air.
Once Verena settled into her seat, Isaac slid a black velvet box across the table.
"I saw this at the auction and thought it would suit you. I hope it pleases you."
Verena's lips curved into a smile-so hints did bear fruit after all.
But when she opened the box, her expression faltered for the briefest moment.
Inside lay not a necklace, but a silk scarf.
Isaac noticed her hesitation and asked, his voice cautious, "You don't like it,Verena?"
Verena concealed her inner bewilderment, her lips curving into warmth. "I like it very much. So long as the gift is from you,I cherish it all."
###Chapter 97 Tattoo
Verena was a bit confused. isaac did not hand her the necklace he had kept in the study. instead, he choseto buy her a scarf.
But why?
Verena trusted him enough to believe he wouldn't allow another woman into his lifeShe reasoned that perhaps the necklace had been meant as a gift for a relative.Leaving her guesses aside, Verena rose, moved before lsaac, and knelt down. "Would you mind helping mewith this?"
"Alright." lsaac took the scarf, folded it with care, and wrapped it softly around her neck, tying it into a neatbow.
Verena remained kneeling before him, and naturally, his gaze lowered.
When they entered the restaurant, Verena had removed her coat, showing a slightly loose sweater beneath.
As she bent, the collar slipped a little, uncovering the elegant lines of her collarbones.
Just as lsaac was about to shift his gaze away, something caught his eye and made him freeze.Beneath her collarbone, close to her heart, was a tattoo-a single initial, ".."
isaac's expression faltered, his brow knitting
Who did that "|" belong to?
He recalled her mention of a first love, and it felt as though someone had struck his chest with a heavy blow.it seemed she had not erased her first boyfriend from memory.Verena had once confessed they had loved each other deeply Though she had called it the past... if it were truly just history, if every feeling had faded, who would still carry a tattoo carved for an old flame?
Keeping an initial etched into one's skin surely spoke of lingering affection.
And the truth stood plain-the mark remained, unremoved, near her heart.
Did she still think of her first love?
Isaac fixed his gaze on the black letter, frozen, his breath catching in his throat.
A tide of jealousy surged within, leaving him suffocated.
If anyone had the right to ask about it now, it was him.
Yet his broken body made him feel unworthy even of jealousy.
If fate decreed he never recovered, and she had not truly fallen for him, would that not, in its twisted way, be better?
His mind drifted back, retracing every step of their journey.
And then a troubling thought struck him-her affection had come so suddenly.
Were her feelings for him real, as she claimed?
If so, why bear another man's mark still? Did her heart continue to wander back to that shadow?
"Is it not done yet?" Verena's gentle voice shattered Isaac's reverie.
He lowered his lashes, hiding the storm in his eyes."It's done."
Verena glanced at the scarf and smiled. "Thank you. It's beautiful."
Isaac forced a faint, stiff smile. "I'm glad you like it."
He chose not to ask about the tattoo.
Or perhaps, he lacked the courage to do so. Verena returned to her seat, brushed her fingers against the scarf at her neck, and thought of the necklaceshe had glimpsed in the study.
Her curiosity lingered, yet she trusted lsaac had his reasons and chose silence.They ate quietly, each prisoner to their own thoughts
At Willis Villa...
since the day Slater posted that clarification, Kaia had shut herself inside her room, refusing to step out.
der phone buzzed from time to time, pricking at her nerves.
very call that came was either meant to mock her or to sneer with false sympathy.innoyed, Kaia switched her chat app to Do Not Disturb, but she dared not do the same with her number, forear she might miss something vital.
et every ring seemed only to draw so-called friends eager to witness her fall
efore she could calm herself, the phone rang once more.
lready agitated, she tore several pages from the book in her hand, unable to hold her temper.
he picked up the phone, meaning to turn it off, but her hand paused at the sight of the caller ID.
was an international call.
drian?" Kaia frowned, whispering in disbelief. "isn't he in Clokron? Why would he call now?"en Slater's post came to mind, souring her face. Could Adrian Carter have heard and joined the chorus ofckery?
... he had been in Clokron for years. He couldn't possibly be so quick to hear gossip.
er a breath of hesitation, Kaia answered.
vely mal闬寡 鬢釡揄凑oice burst through. "Kaia, guess who?" Not knowing if he was aware of her plight, Kaia kept her composure and smiled faintly. "It's Adrian."
She seized the chance to probe. "Aren't you busy? What made you call?"
"I just got back from Clokron," Adrian replied warmly. "I's been ages since we met. Don't you miss me?Won't you join me for a meal?"
At the mention of meeting, Kaia's instinct was to refuse, fearing he might know about the post and wish to ridicule her face-to-face.

But just as she prepared to decline, a spark lit in her mind.
Of course!
Adrian had just returned from Clokron, and he too was a graduate of Pine Hill University.

Her heart leapt with sudden excitement. "Adrian, I've missed you. How time flies! It's been so long I nearly forgot-what year was it you went abroad?"
Adrian,thoughtful, gave her the year and sighed. "Hard to believe i's been seven years."
Kaia made a mental note and replied, "It really has been a while. Adrian, are you free tomorrow? Let's meet in the afternoon. It's on me."
Adrian agreed without hesitation. "Alright."
Feigning busyness, Kaia said, "Adrian, I have things to attend to. Let's talk more tomorrow."
Whenthe call ended, she opened her door and walked downstairs, intent on finding Laura to ask something.But as she reached the staircase, voices rose from the living room-Alec and Laura were quarreling bitterly.Kaia halted,listening.
Laura's voice seethed with resentment."Verena, that ungrateful girl, is too petty! Even when we begged her,she still refused to come home. How can she hold grudges against her own parents?"
Alec snorted, pointing a trembling finger at her. "This is your doing. You knew she was sensitive, yet you provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side.
###Chapter 98 As If Victory Was Already Hers


Shock rippled through Laura as her gaze landed on Kaia, who had rushed to stand between her and danger.

A look of astonishment crossed Alec's face; Kaia's sudden intervention had clearly caught him off guard.

Even so, Alec refused to show a hint of embarrassment at the situation. His hands clasped behind him; his stern demeanor remained unchanged.

After a moment, Laura shook off her shock, stepped forward, and drew Kaia close in a tight hug. She let her frustration spill out at Alec. "How long will this go on, Alec? Ever since Verena came here, this family has been falling apart. I've tried everything-I've humbled myself, lost my pride, and still, nothing changes. If that's how it is, I'm done. From now on, you deal with it."

She didn't wait for a response. Laura led Kaia away and guided her upstairs.

Inside Kaia's bedroom, Laura gently traced the outline of Kaia's puffy cheek, sorrow filling her eyes. "Why would you throw yourself in the middle of that? You know your father's temper."

Kaia knew firsthand how harsh Alec could be. Yet, unlike him, Laura's care was real-she was the one most likely to soften if Kaia reached out.

Laura would stay by her side, no matter what Alec chose to do for his own benefit.

Kaia couldn't afford to lose both, so she kept one close just in case things fell apart.

Kaia took one look at how Laura reacted and figured stepping in had been the right call.

Tears pricked Kaia's eyes, and her nose tingled as she sniffled. "If I hadn't gotten between you, you'd be the one hurting, Mom. I just couldn't let that happen."

Laura's own tears threatened to fall, but she managed a warm,gentle smile.silly girl. At least I know all the love I gave you wasn't wasted. Let's do something about that swelling."

She soon returned with ointment in hand. Dipping a swab into the cream, Laura carefully applied it to Kaia's face. The sting made Kaia flinch, but she didn't regret standing up for her mother.

Trying to ease the tension, Laura spoke softly. "Try not to blame your father. He thinks he's protecting us.The club's closure has kept him up every night."

Kaia's eyes, still red, met her mother's. She nodded quietly."|get it, Mom. I'm not mad at him. Maybe Verena didn't help us because we never really included her. Honestly, I'd feel out of place too."

That confession made Laura pause for a beat.

She hadn't forgotten the scandal stirred up by Slater's post about Kaia. But seeing her daughter's sincerity,Laura dismissed the incident as unimportant.

Her voice was calm. "We gave her a home and every chance to succeed. She's got no reason to resent us."

A faint smile touched Kaia's lips as she changed the subject. "Mom, do you remember when Verena took her college entrance exams?"

While tending to Kaia's cheek, Laura's thoughts wandered back to Verena's school days. She hesitated,recalling, "You know, I don't think she actually sat for the exams. Why are you asking?"

Kaia's eyes reflected regret as she spoke. "Everything that's happened to Willis Group is really on me. When Verena first came home, I was afraid of losing your affection, so I kept my distance. My mistakes led us here,and I want to make things right. I also need to learn about her history-maybe then I can fix what I've done.Don't worry, Mom. I'll talk to her and ask her to stop targeting us."

Laura reached over, pride shining in her expression. "You're being so thoughtful, Kaia. That makes me proud. Your father will be pleased when he hears this." After thinking for a moment, Laura recalled the timing. "It was the year Luka got seriously ill. Seven years ago."

The moment Laura mentioned the year, Kaia nearly leapt from her seat.

That put Verena in Adrian's graduating class.

In her mind, Kaia quickly connected the dots. provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side. Adrian passed the phone back and shrugged. "That's not for sure. The university is massive, and each department is full of students. There's no way to know everyone in your year."

Noticing the disappointment on Kaia's face, Adrian tried to reassure her. "Let me reach out to a buddy of mine-he knows more schoolmates than me."

Grateful for the offer, Kaia nodded. "That would help a lot. I'll send you her picture right now."

Adrian forwarded the photo, and then quickly dialed his friend.

"Wesley, I just texted you a photo. Take a look-do you recognize this girl from back then?"

On the other end, Wesley Seymour's voice sounded rough, like he'd just woken up after a wild night. "Give me a sec."

A few moments ticked by before Wesley let out a low whistle. "Whoa, where'd you get a stunner like this?"

Rolling his eyes, Adrian clarified, saying, "She's not someone I know personally. I'm asking for a friend."

Wesley's enthusiasm faded. "Ah, I get it. Sorry to disappoint, but she doesn't ring a bell."

As Adrian hung up, Kaia leaned in, anxious for the answer. "Did he recognize her?"

He shook his head. "Nope. If a girl like that had been around, especially with my friend's reputation, he would have noticed her for sure."

Hearing this, Kaia felt a surge of satisfaction she hadn't experienced in ages.

Even if Verena truly healed Barrie, a lie about her academic background would stick like a stain that couldn't be washed away.

All Kaia needed was a sliver of doubt-a few hundred people out of a thousand-casting shadows on Verena's story.

As for a grand wedding? What a joke.

Verena wanted to marry into a rich family smoothly? Things weren't going to fall into place that easily.

If Verena's secret came out on her wedding day, it would be the perfect scandal.

A sly smile curled on Kaia's lips, her confidence blooming as if victory was already hers.

###Chapter 99 Verena's Love Life


Leaning in a bit, Kaia asked, "So... that means she wasn't a Pine Hill student, right?"

Adrian paused, clearly thinking it over. "I can't say for sure. My friend's got connections everywhere, but the campus is packed with gorgeous women-he couldn't know all of them."

Then he turned the question back on her. "Why are you so interested in this girl, anyway? Is she that important?"

Kaia said quickly, "She is-honestly, it's crucial. Adrian, you're plugged in with so many people. Could you help me dig up more about her?"

He mulled it over before giving a nod. "Alright, here's what l'Il do. I'Il contact someone from school and see if they can send over our med school's complete roster from that yea. We'll check for her name."

Relief filled Kaia's voice. "That's really helpful,Adrian. Thank you!"

Meanwhile, at a Shoildon restaurant, two men sat facing each other in a private dining room, deep in business talk.

One, older with silver streaks at his temples, watched everything with alert, calculating eyes-the look of a seasoned executive.

Across from him, a younger man in a wheelchair hid every thought behind a calm, unreadable face.

Rising from his seat, the older man-Jeffry Turner-offered a hand and an overly polite smile. "Mr. Bennett,Turner Group is honored to join forces with your company. Here's to a thriving alliance."

Isaac waited, his eyes resting on the outstretched hand just long enough for Jeffry's smile to falter, before finally accepting the shake.

"To a thriving alliance," Isaac replied evenly.

Jeffry's smile quickly returned as he straightened. "Well, I'll get out of your hair now, Mr. Bennett. Wouldn't want to take up more of your valuable time."

Right on cue, his assistant hurried over to hold the door as Jeffry left.

As soon as they were gone, Jacob, who had been standing quietly behind Isaac, couldn't help but remark,"That Jeffry is slick. He's always out for his own interests. If he didn't have that tiny link to your mother,he'd never land a partnership like this."

Isaac let out a small, knowing laugh, hands folded in his lap. "After forty years in the industry,Jeffry knows the game. He won't lift a finger unless there's something in it for him first."

Jacob nodded, impressed. "You always stay three steps ahead, Mr. Bennett."

Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit. "Let's get back to the office."

Out in the hallway, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar face.

It was Gavin-Verena's friend who had just returned from overseas.

He started to call out, maneuvering his wheelchair forward, but at that moment, a young woman emerged from the elevator.

Gavin greeted her wvith a bright grin and gently guided her into another room.

Jacob inclined his head, quietly pressing, "Mr. Bennett, the elevator is ready for you."

Isaac looked at his assistant and replied, "Go on ahead, Jacob. Wait for me downstairs-l've got something to do first."

Without questioning further, Jacob nodded. "Of course,sir."

Isaac steered himself down the hall, stopping right outside the room Gavin had entered.

He waited patiently, letting the minutes pass. At last, about thirty minutes later, the door swung open.

Gavin, heading out toward the restrooms, froze when he spotted Isaac waiting. Surprise flashed across his face."Were you waiting for me?" Isaac met his gaze and gave a quiet nod.

Gavin instantly guessed this wasn't a chance encounter-and he doubted Isaac was here to invite him to a meal.

He cut straight to the point. "This is about Dr. Willis, isn't it?"

Isaac offered a slight nod, admitting, "You and Verena go way back. I'd like to understand her history."

Gavin narrowed his eyes, his mind quickly turning. He recalled his last talk with Verena at the bar and knew Isaac's memory was patchy at best. Was this sudden interest in Verena's past because something had changed between them?

A flicker of anticipation shot through Gavin. "Alright-let's find a spot to talk."

As they headed down the hall, Gavin sent a text. "Ran into someone. I'll be a while, wait for me."

Reaching the end of the corridor, he stopped and faced Isaac. "Go ahead-whatever you want to know, just ask."

Isaac hesitated, fingers tightening against his wheels. He wanted to hear about Verena's past, to piece together the woman he was falling for, but doubt crept in.

Was it right to probe into her life without telling her? The urge to know more fought against the worry that he might be crossing a line, and the uncertainty made him pause, caught between curiosity and concern.

Thoughts spun through Isaac's head, emotions tangled in a silent war. In the end, after a long pause, he couldn't bring himself to do something that might upset her. He let out a quiet breath and said, "Never mind,it's not important."

Gavin's eyebrows shot up in protest; he was not willing to let it go that easily. "Seriously, Mr. Bennett? You waited outside my room, guided me here to talk, andI even texted my friend to hold off for you. Now you say it's not important? Are you having a laugh?"

Isaac didn't elaborate, simply nodded and said, "Sorry."

Gavin huffed but decided to keep the conversation going. Leaning against the wall, he crossed his arms and put on a thoughtful face. "Alright, if you're not talking, l'll take a stab at it myself. What could possibly have you so curious about a woman's past? Let's see..."

Drawing out his words with a mischievous glint, Gavin asked, "This is about her love life, isn't it?"

Isaac met Gavin's eyes, a cold spark flickering in his own, but said nothing.

The look on Isaac's face told Gavin he'd hit the mark, and his joking manner instantly faded. He straightened, saying in a more serious tone, "Okay, you don't have to say it. You're curious about Dr. Willis'romantic past."

For a moment, Gavin hesitated. He remembered Verena's words about keeping Isaac's memory loss under wraps for the time being-it might complicate things if he found out.

Still, as far as love went, Verena's history only included Isaac.

So,how should he phrase it... Suddenly, an idea struck Gavin.

With a sly grin and a bit of theatrical flair, Gavin said, "Dr. Willis once had someone who chased after her with everything he had. This guy was completely devoted-he learned to cook just so he could make her different meals every day. And you know what? She ignored a whole parade of impressive admirers just to be with him. They were everyone's idea of the perfect couple..."

Isaac broke in, voice cool and measured. "Did his last name start with an 'I'?"

That question threw Gavin for a loop. An "I"? Why ask that?

Hold on a second!

Gavin remembered seeing a small tattoo just beneath Verena's collarbone: a single letter, I.

It had been a topic of teasing before, and Verena claimed it stood for lsaac-something Gavin and the others had never let her live down.

Realization dawned. Isaac must've seen that tattoo and thought it was connected to the man in her past.

The pieces fit, and Gavin barely managed to hide his amusement. This could get interesting.

###Chapter 100 Are You And Isaac Keeping Secrets From Me


Gavin couldn't forget the punch lsaac's brother had landed on him in that bar. Since the younger brother had stirred up trouble, wasn't it only fair that lsaac, as the elder one, carried some of the blame? And besides, Verena had been insistent-Isaac must never learn the truth about his memory loss.

Gavin convinced himself that what he was about to tell Isaac was for his own good.

Holding that thought, he swallowed his amusement and gave a small cough before saying,"Well,you can think that way. After all, one of the initials of his name is indeed T."

The remark offered little clarity, and the mischief in his tone was obvious.

Isaac felt his heart sink, and as if punishing himself, he asked, "Were they truly in love?"

Enjoying the tension, Gavin leaned into the story. "Deeply! That man adored Dr. Willis, and she nearly gave up everything for him."

At those words, Isaac lowered his eyes. Verena almost sacrificed everything for another man? The woman he knew was rational and steady. Without powerful feelings, she would never have risked so much.

A hollow laugh escaped him.

In that moment, Isaac realized he was torturing himself. Knowing she had once given her heart away,he still insisted on uncovering the details. Hadn't he vowed to only care about her present and her future? For now,it was him by her side, not that man. Whoever he was, he belonged only in her past.

Isaac gripped the wheelchair tightly, his restrained voice edged with self-mockery. "I don't want to hear any more. I don't want to know."

He turned the chair and rolled into the elevator.

Inside, with no one else around, Isaac bowed his head. His back curved slightly as a wave of helplessness washed over him. He already knew Verena had loved someone before, yet he still couldn't stop himself from digging into what should have been left alone.

In the reflection of the elevator's mirror, Isaac caught sight of himself and let out a faint, crooked smile. He had waited outside Gavin's room for so long, obsessed with digging into her past. Was it just jealousy fueling him, or did he secretly doubt that Verena could ever choose a man like him?

How could a woman who once loved so fiercely move on so quickly? And this time, the person she chose wasn't even an ordinary man. For her to accept everything about him without question, she must have had her own reasons.


...

Since the day she started living with Isaac, Verena made it her routine to check on his health every single day.

Over the last few weeks, she noticed that her treatments were beginning to stimulate his nerves. The changes weren't striking, but they were still far better than before.

Her priority now was to get control over her shaking hand so she could schedule Isaac's surgery as soon as possible.

To practice, Verena asked someone to bring her a lab mouse. She laid out the surgical tools carefully and carried the animal into the study.

With gloves pulled on and a mask covering her face, she stared at the scalpel waiting on the tray, and her mouth went dry.

She swallowed,lifted the scalpel, and waited, holding it tightly without moving for a long moment.

When no response came, Verena finally let out a breath of relief. To her gratitude, her right hand held steady.

With a spark of confidence returning, she pinned the sedated mouse in place and guided the scalpel with her right hand, the sharp edge gradually slicing through the thin layer of skin.

But the moment her cut reached the abdomen, her fingers began to shake uncontrollably. Her grip tightened around the handle as she struggled to keep it from slipping.

Sweat dampened her forehead. When the tremor finally lessened, she forced herself to continue the operation.

When the scalpel pressed into the organs, a wave of dizziness struck Verena, coldness creeping up her spine until it spread through her whole body.

A memory burst before her eyes-Shawna lying on the operating table, suffering and frail, while she stood frozen with a scalpel in her hand, unable to save her. She had been forced to watch as her grandmother slipped away.

Verena's breathing grew shallow and uneven, her chest rising and falling as she fought to take in air.She told herself this fear had to be conquered, that she needed the strength to lift the scalpel again.

Clasping her right wrist with her left hand, Verena forced her body to remain steady.

Dissecting a lab mouse was considered the easiest procedure for any medical student.

In the past, she had been able to complete one in under five minutes.

On this day, nearly forty minutes dragged by.

Weakness set into her limbs as she leaned against the wall, her complexion pale and her eyes blank as they settled on the scalpel she still held.

Her trembling hadn't stopped, and during the procedure she had nearly sliced into the mouse's organs.

It ended up being the poorest operation she had ever performed.

Not long after, Stevie arrived unexpectedly.

Rhonda, the housekeeper, noticed him and said politely, "Please wait here. I'll let him know."

Stevie motioned for her to stop. "No need. Just keep doing your work."

Then he yelled toward the upper floor, "Isaac, come down here! There's another thing I need to give you." The noise carried through the house, prompting Verena to step out of the study. She went downstairs, saw Stevie standing in the living room, and answered, "Isaac isn't here."

When Verena appeared, Stevie froze in place, unable to react at first.

It was obvious he had forgotten that Isaac already had a wife.

Awkwardness flickered across his face. Then, his eyes fell on the scalpel in Verena's hand, the fresh stain of blood making it all the more unsettling.

He edged back a step and murmured, "Verena, what are you..."

"It's nothing," Verena said quickly, slipping the scalpel behind her back.

There was no way she wanted Isaac to hear about her struggles in surgery, not when it could shake his confidence even further.

Her eyes shifted to the object Stevie was holding, and she redirected the moment. "Isaac isn't home right now.Is that meant for him? Leave it with me, and I'll make sure he gets it."

Realizing what he had in his hand, Stevie hurried to tuck it behind his back."NO,really, it's nothing important. I'll hand it to him myself; no need to bother you."

The evasion didn't escape her. Verena arched a brow and asked,"So it's something I shouldn't see? Are you and Isaac keeping secrets from me?"

Stevie stiffened, biting down on his words. Fine. That was between husband and wife-he wasn't going to get dragged into it.

He set the item down on the table and remarked, "I'll just leave it here. Goodbye, Verena."

Turning on his heel, he bolted from the house as if something was chasing him.

Verena's gaze lingered on the small box on the table, her mind unsettled. What could possibly make Stevie this tense?

"Rhonda, please carry this up to my room," she said evenly. "Of course," Rhonda replied at once.

Upstairs, Verena washed her hands thoroughly with disinfectant before sitting at her desk and lifting the lid of the small box. Inside lay a ring.

Between her fingers, she held a rose-shaped diamond ring-her favorite flower crafted in stone.

Her gaze shifted to the inside of the band, where the letter"E"had been engraved.

It was the initial of Evelyn-her other name.

A ring.

A necklace.

Stevie had just returned home.

And she recalled Stevie mentioning he hadn't spoken to Isaac for nearly eight months.

In that moment, the truth dawned on her. These pieces must have been prepared for her by Isaac before his memory loss.

At the same time, Stevie rushed away from the house and pulled out his phone to call Isaac.

"Isaac, I screwed up badly. Please don't be angry. I had no idea your wife was living with you. When I came by with the gift, I accidentally gave her the ring you bought for another woman."

Isaac's voice hardened. "What did you just say?" He pinched the bridge of his nose, not bothering to inquire about the ring. He added, frustration thick in his tone, "You never fail to mess things üp."

The call ended before Stevie could argue.

Back at his desk, Isaac clasped his hands together, elbows braced on the surface, and lowered his head. A nervous weight pressed against his chest; he was worried Verena might misunderstand when she saw the ring.

Raising his voice with authority, Isaac instructed, "Jacob, get the car ready."
###Chapter 101 A Ring


Soon after, the car rolled to a halt outside the villa.


Jacob assisted Isaac out and into the wheelchair,but before he could offer any more help, Isaac propelled himself ahead.



Inside the house, Isaac scanned the living room, but Verena was nowhere in sight, so he went straight for the elevator and made his way up to the second floor.


He found the bedroom door ajar and entered without hesitation.


Inside, Verena sat in an office chair, her attention buried in a book. When the sound of wheels reached her,she glanced over and greeted him. "Back so soon,Isaac?"



Her composure gave nothing away, as if the day had been utterly uneventful.


If not for the box sitting next to her hand, Isaac might have believed Stevie's earlier call was just a trick of his imagination.



Tension showed in Isaac's grip on the armrests, his eyes clouded with worry. Regardless of her feelings for him, Isaac didn't want any confusion or distance between them.



He didn't know if Verena had already peeked inside the box or how he'd explain the necklace and the ring.



After an uncertain pause, he finally asked, keeping his voice gentle, "Did Stevie stop by today?"



Each word was measured, his gaze watching Verena for any flicker of a reaction.



Noticing his barely concealed nerves, Verena offered a small, knowing smile. "He did," she replied evenly.


"Did he mention anything to you?" Isaac pressed,unable to hide his concern.



A wave of unease swept over him-what if Stevie had revealed more than he should in front of her?



Only after the words slipped out did Isaac realize he was being obvious.



He looked away, his lips pressed thin, unable to meet her gaze.



Verena,amused by how unsettled he seemed, let a playful spark light her eyes.



She leaned her cheek into her palm and answered with an easy drawl, "Nothing much." Just as Isaac began to relax, she added, unhurried and soft, "But he did leave something behind-said it was for you."



A knot formed in Isaac's throat, and a flash of panic flickered in his dark gaze.



Choosing to ignore his unease, Verena casually lifted the box from the table, popped open the lid, and knelt down at his feet.



She smiled at him, twirling the ring in her fingers."Isaac,who knew you had such a romantic streak? You really didn't need to go to all this effort. Next time you have a gift for me, just hand it to me yourself.That means more to me than anything."


For a heartbeat, Isaac was too startled to respond, and then he realized her mistake. "Actually, I..."



Verena cut him off, her eyes shining as she studied the ring. "This is wonderful, Isaac. Thank you."


She tilted it closer to the light, admiring the design."The diamond was carved into the shape of a rose,right? It's gorgeous."



Her joy was so bright that Isaac's protest faded away.He found himself unable to break the moment.


He only wished her happiness could last like this. As he fell silent, Verena arched a brow and extended her hand,holding the ring out to him."Will you do the honors?"



He accepted the ring, and although his movements were stiff, he slid it onto her finger.



But before the ring made it all the way, Verena pulled her hand back. "Wait, Isaac. Isn't this one a little loose?"


His hands went still, and for a moment, he drew a blank, frozen by uncertainty.



A wave of nervousness hit him, stronger than anything he'd felt before-a childhood fear of being caught red -handed.



Verena's tone shifted as she inspected the band. "Hold on, what's this?" She peered closely. "Check out the inside-there's something carved in here."


She lifted the ring to his eye level. "Look, the letter 'E.'"



Her gaze sharpened with suspicion. "What's that supposed to stand for, Isaac? There's no 'E'in the initials of my name."
###Chapter 102 She Won't Suffer Any Injustice
When Verena pressed for an answer,Isaac was left speechless.



He wanted to clear things up, but couldn't find the words-after all, he had no idea what the engraved "E" actually meant himself.



He met her gaze, his face blank, lips parting as he stammered, "I..."



Nerves crept into his voice, so faint it nearly vanished between them. Sensing his unease, Verena decided not to push any further. She suddenly raised her voice in mock realization. "Oh! That makes sense now!"



Isaac blinked, watching as her eyes danced with mischief. "'E' must be for the last letter in 'LOVE,'right? Isaac, I never guessed you'd be so clever about this stuff!"



He was still frowning, about to say more, when Verena closed the distance and kissed his cheek. "It's a wonderful present-thank you."



Joy lit up her eyes, and her voice came out in a gentle hush. Isaac caught the glow in her smile, held back what he was going to say, and let the mystery behind the letter "E" stay just that.



He offered a smile in return, even if it felt a little stiff."If it makes you happy, that's all that matters."



...



At Bennett Group, after wrapping up a meeting,Isaac made his way back to his office, where Jacob appeared at the door with a gentle knock.


"Yes?" Isaac replied, his thumbs pressing lightly at his temples, eyes closed as if collecting his thoughts.



Handing over the phone, Jacob reported, "Mr.Bennett, you missed a call from Mr. Barrie Lyons about ten minutes ago."


Isaac's eyes opened and he nodded, replying, "Thank you."



With the office empty once more, Isaac dialed Barrie's number.



It didn't take long for the line to connect, Barrie's raspy voice coming through. "Isaac, is that you?"


"It's me, Mr. Lyons." Isaac's tone was respectful. "How have you been these days?" Barrie, always fond of Isaac's manners, let out a soft chuckle. "I'm doing well, thank you."



After a brief exchange, Barrie's voice turned serious."Isaac, there's something I need to ask you."



"Go ahead," Isaac replied.



"Did you tell Beckett to close Alec's club?" Barrie asked directly.



A brief flash of uncertainty passed through Isaac's eyes. Barrie rarely involved himself in affairs outside his own business; today's call was a clear break from the norm.



He answered honestly, "I did."



"But why?" Barrie's question carried both confusion and concern. "Isaac, I'm not trying to interfere, but Dr.Willis is not just Alec's daughter-she's also my savior.Now that her family's in trouble, I can't simply look away. I know you're a fair man, so I have to ask-did Alec wrong you in some way? Otherwise,why would you move against the Willis family?"



His voice softened, almost pleading. "Your wedding to Dr. Willis is just around the corner. If word gets out,people will talk-they'll say you hold a grudge against your fiancée's family, or that you're trying to humiliate her. Alec may have his faults, but he's still her father. No matter what's happened, targeting her family this way only breeds bitterness between you two."



Listening,Isaac realized why Barrie had reached out.



He replied with genuine appreciation, "Thank you for caring about Verena, Mr. Lyons."



He continued, voice steady, "Alec's never slighted me personally. But he's wronged my wife-and that's all that matters to me. Any so-called bitterness isn't a concern. I've always been open with Verena about my actions against her father."



Barrie fell silent, confusion written on his weathered face.



Was Slater right? Was Isaac truly this devoted to Verena?



Could it really be that the entire Willis family faced Isaac's wrath because they had crossed Verena?



Barrie found himself at a loss, unable to make sense of Isaac's motives.



When the silence stretched, Isaac decided to close the conversation. "Don't trouble yourself about the club,Mr. Lyons. I'll make sure it's taken care of."



He added with quiet confidence, "And as for the person who saved your life-rest easy. I'll make sure she won't suffer any injustice."
###Chapter 103 Revenge Plan
Isaac's blunt response left Barrie with nothing more to say.



Letting out a quiet sigh, Barrie replied, "Alright then,I'll stay out of it."



He ended the call after that.



Still holding the phone, lsaac ran his finger slowly along its edge as Barrie's words echoed in his mind.



Barrie had made a point-since his wedding to Verena was just around the corner, it would be unwise to stir up unnecessary attention. The issue with Alec's club could wait until the ceremony was over.



As the upcoming wedding crossed his mind, lsaac's hand paused, and a flicker of determination lit his eyes.



Before, he might have left every detail in someone else's hands. This time was different. It was his marriage to the woman he loved, and he wanted to shape it himself. He intended to be part of the planning, to make sure Verena had a wedding that was unforgettable and uniquely hers.


With that decision firm in his mind,Isaac set his phone on the desk and reached for the office phone."Jacob,step in for a moment."



Within minutes, Jacob knocked at the door and came inside.



"Mr. Bennett, what do you need from me?"



"I want you to contact the wedding planner and set up a meeting for this afternoon. I'll be discussing the details with them directly."


"Yes, sir. Wait, what?" Jacob blinked at Isaac, unsure if his ears had deceived him. Danica had dismissed the wedding arrangements as something minor, ordering that the planner's outline be followed without interference. It seemed almost unbelievable that Isaac had summoned him just to announce that he wished to go over the wedding arrangements with the team himself. Isaac taking such a deep interest in the wedding was something he didn't see coming.


Noticing his hesitation, Isaac asked, "Did I say it unclearly? Should I repeat myself?"



The question was plain, without a trace of force behind it.



Jacob shook his head at once. "No, Mr. Bennett, I understand. I'll reach out to them right away."


Isaac inclined his head. "Good. I appreciate it." For a moment Jacob just stared. The small smile forming on lsaac's lips stripped away the usual distance and sternness that always surrounded him.



In that instant, Isaac looked more like a man basking in the joy of marriage than the cold figure people rarely approached.


Jacob almost couldn't believe it.







Days had slipped by since Kaia last saw Adrian, and she still had no word on the investigation she'd asked him to pursue.



Her patience snapped, and she typed out a quick message. "Adrian, are you free to meet this afternoon at the usual place?"



Silence stretched for five minutes, which was out of character.



Normally Adrian replied immediately,or at the very least within a few minutes of hearing from her.


It took nearly thirty minutes before her phone buzzed with his short reply. "Alright."



Kaia blinked at the one-word reply, startled by how blunt it was. Adrian used to jump at any excuse to talk to her, worried he might lose the chance if he didn't.


Still, she pushed the thought aside. What mattered most now was finding out if Verena really had a degree from Pine Hill University-or if she had faked it.


That afternoon, Kaia showed up thirty minutes early,just as she had before.



When Adrian finally arrived and sat across from her,Kaia leaned in eagerly. "Adrian, how did it go? Did you uncover what I asked about?"



Instead of answering right away, he studied her with an unreadable look.



In the past few days since his return, he had heard from friends about the things Kaia said in the group chat and the social media post Slater had written. Piece by piece, he had managed to put the whole story together.


Long ago,his parents had worked with Alec, and from their very first dinner, Adrian had fallen for Kaia.Even after moving abroad, his feelings hadn't changed, and the moment he came back, she was the first person he contacted.



In his memory, Kaia had always been gentle and kind,but the things he learned about her left him shaken.



His fingers locked tightly together on the table as he finally spoke, his voice weighted. "Kaia, just tell me the truth. Verena's your sister, isn't she?"


Her smile stiffened at once. Adrian added, "So why are you digging into her past? Do you plan to expose that she never graduated from Pine Hill University? Were you going to announce it at her wedding?"


His stare cut into her, sharp and unrelenting, carrying the unspoken accusation that she was far from the innocent woman she pretended to be. To him, she looked calculating, even ruthless.


Kaia's first instinct was to deny it, yet she forced herself to stop hiding and face it head-on.


"So you already figured it out." She dropped the act and admitted bluntly, "Yes, that's my plan. Because I can't forgive her for stealing everything that should've been mine!"



Adrian's brows drew together, his face dark with concern.



Kaia grabbed his hand and held on tightly, her eyes brimming with tears. "Adrian, I need your help. I've been against Verena for a reason. She hurt me in ways you don't know, and I want what's fair."


Her voice broke as she continued, "From the very first day she came into my life, she struck me just to prove she was in charge. My parents turned a blind eye, hoping she'd marry into the Bennett family, so they ignored my pain completely."


Looking up through wet lashes, she locked eyes with him. "Adrian, do you think I enjoy doing this? My parents only care about Verena now. If I don't fight back, I'll end up with nothing at all."



Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, her sobs breaking her words.



The sight tore at Adrian's heart. This was the girl he had admired for years, and seeing her cry shattered his anger toward her.



He squeezed her hand with quiet reassurance, his voice softening. "Kaia, I'm sorry. I judged you without knowing the truth. I let rumors cloud my view of you,and I shouldn't have."



Seizing the moment, Kaia nestled against him,her tone carrying a wounded softness as she pleaded,"Adrian,I need your help."


Feeling her cheek pressed to his chest, Adrian stiffened,his mind going blank for a moment.


After collecting himself, he lifted a hand and gently patted her back. "Alright.I'll help you."


Out of his sight, a smile tugged at Kaia's lips. His response made it clear-whatever he uncovered couldn't have favored Verena.



Even if Verena had managed to fix Barrie's leg, it could easily be dismissed as luck. That alone didn't prove she had a degree from Pine Hill University.


Adrian exhaled slowly, pausing before putting a little space between them.



From the chair beside him, he picked up a folder and handed it over. "This is the complete student list from every department that year. I checked through it several times, and Verena Willis doesn't appear anywhere."


Looking down at the folder, Kaia's face lit with satisfaction. It was exactly what she expected.



In her eyes, Alec and Laura had always been opportunists; if Kaia herself had inherited their traits,Verena was bound to be the same.



Kaia's eyes glimmered with pride. She would make sure Verena face shame and rejection before the whole world on her wedding day.
###Chapter 104 A Devoted Husband
 Both Slater and Bobby clearly thought the world of Verena, didn't they? Kaia seethed inwardly.Slater even went so far as to post on social media to mock her,just todefend Verena.



Kaia wondered how their faces would look when Verena's lie was exposed on her big day.



As soon as she got home, Kaia wasted no time sharing her discovery with Alec and Laura. "Dad, Mom, you've both been fooled by Verena. She never graduated from Pine Hill University. I'm telling the truth. I had it checked-her name doesn't exist in their records."



Laura's eyeswidened in disbelief. "Whatare yousaying?"


Alec, on the other hand, barely flinched.



He shot Kaia a measured look, reading her intentions with practiced ease.


With a dismissive snort, Alec stood up from the couch."You really expect me to believe you just like that?Even if Verena lied about her education background,what difference does it make?" He stepped closer,his words deliberate and heavy. "I'm telling you this, Kaia: I won't allow you to drag our family's reputation through the mud. There won't be any scenes at Verena's wedding. Try anything, and you'll answer to me."



With his warning delivered, Alec turned away and headed upstairs without another word.



The real reason Alec wasn't in a rush to look into Verena's education background was simple-she was his own child. If this got out, the Willis family's standing would take a hit, and so would his personal reputation.



Years spent building his public image couldn't be risked now.



Laura, who had started to question further, caught sight of Alec's stern face and thought better of it.


She gave Kaia's arm a gentle squeeze and murmured,"Your father's under a lot of stress lately. Don't add to it."



She then followed Alec up the stairs.



Left alone in the living room, Kaia stared after her parents as they disappeared from view. Her hands curled into fists, trembling from frustration. She held still for a moment, and then let out a laugh laced with sarcasm.



Once again, they were talking down to her like she hadn't heard it all before.



Ever since her name had been dragged through the mud online, Alec hadn't openly confronted her, but the cold shoulder was unmistakable. He kept his distance,barely even speaking.



Kaia knew he was biding his time, waiting for the club mess to quiet down before finally dealing with her.



All her effort to uncover Verena's secret had been a desperate attempt to win back their approval.



If nothing else, she wanted Alec and Laura to see she was not the one deceiving them-it was Verena.



Yet the only thing she received for her effort was a stern warning not to ruin her sister's wedding.



He cared so much about appearances that he'd do anything to prevent Verena from being shamed in public.



But what about the humiliation she had suffered?


All those people from their social circle had shown up just to see her fail-had Alec ever once stepped in to defend her?



Why should she be expected to protect his dignity, or Verena's, when no one ever shielded hers?


Absolutely not.



Kaia made up her mind right then: she had no intention of following his orders.



They could have their turn on Verena's wedding day -let them feel the sting of embarrassment for once.







That morning,Jacob arranged a meeting with the team from the wedding company.



After finishing a meeting at Bennett Group that afternoon, Isaac left for his appointment with them.



News that Isaac would be handling wedding details himself had the entire staff buzzing with anticipation;everyone waited out front, eager to make a good impression.



A sleek black limousine glided to a stop moments later.



Lined up in neat rows, the staff gave respectful bows as the manager hurried forward, anxious not to miss a beat. Once the vehicle was parked, Jacob assisted Isaac into his wheelchair.



With practiced hospitality, the wedding company manager greeted Isaac warmly and escorted him into a private VIP suite.



Inside, the walls were filled with displays-photographs of famous weddings, wealthy couples,and global icons, all serving as inspiration.


Isaac took a measured look around before letting his attention drift back to the task at hand.



Isaac didn't have to say a word-the manager picked up on his lack of enthusiasm for the wedding styles displayed around them.



She brought over a stack of thick albums and set them down with a soft thud. "These were put together by well-known designers from around the world, Mr.Bennett. You're welcome to flip through them, and if you've got something else in mind, I'd be happy to hear it."



Isaac turned a few pages, and then looked up and set the record straight. "My opinion isn't the one that matters."



Catching on immediately, the manager replied, "So,it's the bride's wishes we'll follow, correct?" A faint light flickered in lsaac's eyes, and a subtle smile touched his lips. "Exactly."



A few young employees nearby exchanged whispers,clearly smitten.


"Wow, Mr. Bennett always seemed so distant, but he's actually so sweet to his wife."


"When I got married, my in-laws made every choice.I couldn't stand anything they planned. Hearing this just makes me jealous."



"If only I could meet someone like him..."



The manager was quietly impressed-the Bennett Group CEO was actually a devoted husband.



Maintaining her professionalism, she pressed on, her voice friendly. "What sort of wedding does your bride envision? Does she have favorite flowers, or a particular style-maybe classic, rustic, or romantic?"



Isaac opened his mouth to answer, but the words never came.



Only then did it hit him-he had no idea what Verena actually liked.


Setting the album aside, Isaac told the manager, "I'm sorry. I'll need to check with my wife before making  these choices."


The manager blinked, caught off guard for a moment,but quickly composed herself. "Of course, Mr.Bennett. Please take all the time you need."



Pulling out his phone, lsaac found Verena's number and called her directly.



Meanwhile, several staff members nearby traded whispers, the mood shifting from admiration to skepticism.


They were holding a wedding ceremony, but the groom didn't know his bride's favorite things.How strange.



Speculation buzzed through the room-maybe lsaac wasn't as devoted as he seemed.



Was it just for show?



Across town, at Seraphina Villas, Verena enjoyed a peaceful afternoon, tending to the plants with a rare lightness in her step.



When her phone vibrated, she wiped her hands,checked the screen, and grinned. She answered it and spoke cheerfully. "Hey, honey! Worn out from work?Need your sweet wife to give you a boost?"


She didn't realize Isaac was nowhere near his office. The playful endearment made Isaac's heart skip, and he tightened his grip on the phone, clearing his throat before replying, "I could use that."


Regaining focus, Isaac moved to his rea reason for calling. "Can I ask-what's your favorite flower?"


Verena arched a brow,half-expecting he was planning a surprise bouquet.


Catching sight of the ring on her finger, she smiled to herself and answered,"Roses."



Isaac, so wrapped up in worrying about the ring's origin, hadn't even noticed the rose-shaped diamond on it.



He continued, "What sort of style do you prefer for an event-romantic, classic, or maybe rustic?"



Verena paused, surprised that picking flowers came with so many options.


Stll, she answered honestly, "Romantic, I think."
###Chapter 105 Miranda Brown
 Following that phone call, Verena realized Isaac hadn't sent her any flowers.


She couldn't help but wonder if he was secretly planning something special for her.


Curiosity tugged at her about whatever "surprise"Isaac might be plotting, but Verena chose not to bring it up.



She figured the truth would reveal itself soon enough.



Time sped by as the wedding approached, and suddenly it was just one day before the ceremony.



Verena scrolled through her contacts, only to remember that most of herclosest friends either lived overseas or were already settled down with families.


Every detail for the big day was set, except for the bridesmaid, a worry that had lingered for days.


Over breakfast, Verena looked at lsaac and asked,"Did you already pick your groomsmen?"



Nodding,Isaac caught the worry in her voice and quickly assured her, "Don't stress about it. If we need to, we can always hire professional bridesmaids." Verena answered without much thought, "Alright."


Even so, a part of her still wished her dearest friends could stand by her side for the wedding.



Just then, the sound of her phone buzzing snapped her out of her thoughts.



Verena answered the call without glancing at the screen.



"Verena! Seriously,what is wrong with you?"



A blast of noise from the other end nearly made Verena's ears ring, forcing her to hold the phone at arm's length.



Recognizing the voice, she asked, "Miranda? What's going on?"



Miranda Brown's frustration was obvious. "Are you kidding me right now? My best friend's about to walk down the aisle, and I have to find out from Gavin, of all people? Do you even consider me your friend anymore? If I hadn't caught up with him, I'd still be clueless. So, were you really going to keep me in the dark forever?"



Back in college at Pine Hill University, Miranda and Verena had met at a campus mixer. Even though Miranda majored in Computer Science and Verena was  in a different department, the two quickly became close friends.



Miranda had become the CEO of a famous global tech company,recognized all around the world.



After Verena came back home, their demandng jobs made it hard for them to keep in touch.



Realizing she should have reached out to her close friend, Verena offered a regretful explanation. "I just thought you had so much going on at work, and l didn't want to bother you. Besides, the wedding's pretty far from you, and I figured it'd be tough for you to come all this way."



Miranda let out a loud scoff. "Don't give me that excuse! No amount of work would ever keep me from your wedding!"



A laugh slipped from Verena before Miranda continued,"I already grabbed the first available flight,and I'm at the airport now. Unless something goes wrong, I'll be back in the country tonight. And just so you know, I'm officially claiming my spot as your bridesmaid. You promised, remember? No backing out now."



Miranda was a bundle of restless energy, yet she and Verena had one majorthing in common-they were both devoted to their work. No matter the occasion, Miranda would tackle every deadline before making time for anything or anyone else.



Verena honestly hadn't imagined Miranda would drop everything and fly across the globe just to stand beside her as her bridesmaid.



A wave of gratitude warmed her, and she broke into a gentle smile. "Of course you'll be my bridesmaid.Travel safe, okay?"


Miranda answered, "Got it. I'll see you tonight!"


When the call ended, Verena found herself grinning,her spirits noticeably lifted.



Across the table, Isaac couldn't help but hear every word,thanks to Miranda's booming voice.



He glanced up and asked, "Was that your friend calling from overseas?"



Verena nodded, still smiling."Yeah, she'll be here by tonight."
###Chapter 106 Encounter At The Airport
At 6:00 PM, a sleek black car waited near the entrance of Shoildon Airport. Kaia sat in the front passenger seat,eyes glued to her phone,while Adrian kept watch over the flow of people spilling out of the airport.



Eventually, Kaia set her phone aside and glanced over."Adrian, how much longer until your friend shows up?We've been here almost thirty minutes."



Earlier that day, Adrian's friend had called to say he'd be flying in tonight and wanted to catch up over dinner. Coincidentally, Kaia had invited Adrian out for a meal as wvell.


Trying to play fair, Adrian considered asking Kaia to join them, though he worried she might not be interested. In the end, he explained the situation,politely turned her down, and left the decision up to her.



To his surprise, Kaia didn't mind at all. She even volunteered to tag along to the airport and welcome his friend together.



Adrian couldn't have been happier. The woman he cared about was open to blending into his circle of  friends, so he didn't hesitate to bring her along.



Adrian glanced at his watch. "Not much longer now.The flight should land in about ten minutes."



He turned to Kaia, checking on her. "Are you hungry?Want me to grab you a snack while we wait?"



Her lips curved into a warm smile as she shook her head. "Don't worry about me, Adrian. Let's wait until your friend arrives; then we can all eat together."


Inwardly, Kaia admitted she'd never be this patient if it weren't for the fact that Adrian's friend was also a Pine Hill University top student.



Watching Kaia's gentle, easygoing personality,Adrian's heart twinged with emotion. She must have been through a lot, or she wouldn't be so invested in going against Verena.



Adrian's thoughts were interrupted as he looked out the window and noticed a familiar figure. Wait, was that...



He squinted, fixating on a spot near the terminal doors.Gliding through the crowd was a striking woman,her white suitcase rolling behind her. Her height and effortless poise made her impossible to miss.



In a heartbeat, Adrian knew who she was. Miranda?She was back in town too? "Adrian. Adrian?" Kaia called Adrian a few times, but he didn't seem to hear her. She followed his line of sight and spotted the woman he couldn't take his eyes off, a fashionably dressed, confident young woman.



Even though Kaia understood Adrian cared about her,watching him get so absorbed by another woman's presence, especially one so beautiful, sent a small pang of discomfort through her.



She quickly masked her feelings, placing a light hand on his shoulder and putting on her most pleasant tone."Adrian, you can't seem to look away from that stunning lady.Is she your friend?"



"Huh?" Adrian glanced over, understanding that Kaia was referring to Miranda, and offered an awkward smile. "Not exactly. Someone like her is way out of my league."



"Way out of your league?" Kaia echoed in disbelief."Adrian, don't sell yourself short. You're one of the best people I know."



Adrian explained, "We actually attended the same university and even majored in the same field, but she was a year ahead of me. She made a name for herself early on, and everyone in our department admired her.During my freshman year, she gave an unforgettable seminar that really inspired us. Now, she's the CEO of  AuroraNexus, which is a huge name in tech."



"AuroraNexus?" Kaia repeated, her eyes widening in awe. "That's the sixth-ranked conglomerate in the world,right? And she's so young,too!"


Her amazement drew a small,proud nod from Adrian."Exactly. That's why l've always looked up to her.She's honestly extraordinary, proving that women can excel just as much as anyone in the tech industry."



As the words "AuroraNexus CEO" echoed in Kaia's mind, a new idea started to take shape. If she managed to build a solid connection with someone of this woman's caliber, the thought of crossing the Bennett family or even Alec and Laura wouldn't bother her in the slightest.


After composing herself, Kaia offered to Adrian,saying, "If she means so much to you,why not take this chance to say hello?"



Adrian rubbed the back of his neck, looking a little embarrassed. "Truth is... we aren't exactly close.Wouldn't it seem odd to just walk up and greet her out of the blue?"



"Come on, why not?" Kaia encouraged him. "It's not every day you run into someone you admnire so much.You'll regret it if you don't at least introduce yourself.Besides, we're only going to say hi, not intrude on her  time."



Adrian glanced at Miranda, who was steadily making her way toward them. He hesitated, but Kaia's enthusiasm finally won him over.


He swung open the car door and stepped out. "Alright then, let's go say hi."



A bright smile lit up Kaia's face as she hurried after him.



"Hey,Miranda!" Adrian called out as he hurried over to Miranda.



Miranda paused, turning to see who was calling her name, her gaze settling on Adrian with a hint of curiosity.



Face-to-face with someone he admired, Adrian felt all his confidence drain away, rubbing his head with a shy grin.



"You're back in town, Miranda? I was your junior at the university."



For a split second, Miranda's face went blank as she studied Adrian. A flood of confusion rushed through her thoughts. Who on earth was this guy? Frustrated,she realized she had absolutely no memory of him.



Still, Miranda kept her composure and greeted him with a practiced, pleasant smile. "Yeah, what a small  world. It's been ages, hasn't it?"



Adrian's eyes widened in surprise. "So you actually remember me, Miranda?"



Of course, Miranda had no clue who he was,but she couldn't bring herself to admit it and risk offending him.


Miranda let out a friendly laugh, improvising smoothly."Outstanding people are hard to forget. And who could overlook such a bright, promising junior?"



Adrian hadn't expected Miranda to speak so highly of him, leaving him both stunned and thrilled. For a moment, all he could do was stand there grinning like an idiot.



While Adrian and Miranda slipped into conversation,Kaia stood quietly at his side, slowly realizing they'd forgotten all about her.


Kaia had more on her mind than a simple greeting.



She tugged gently at Adrian's sleeve, turning an enchanted look on Miranda. "Adrian, your senior is gorgeous! I can totally see why you look up to her."


It was at that moment that Miranda realzed Kaia was right there with them. After all, who didn't enjoy hearing a compliment about their appearance?



Miranda's polite smile was replaced by a look of  genuine happiness.



"You sure know how to make someone feel special.Those compliments could lift anyone's spirits."Miranda glanced at Kaia, and then shifted her gaze to Adrian,her eyes now holding a hint of playful meaning.



Kaia shook her head, still beaming. "I mean every word.You really are stunning. The moment you walked through the crowd,you caught my eye."


Adrian caught Miranda's expression and quickly stepped in with introductions. "Miranda, this is my neighbor,Kaia."



Miranda shifted her focus back to Kaia and smiled warmly. "Well,you're absolutely lovely yourself."



As she spoke, she pulled her phone out of her bag to power it on.



Kaia was genuinely impressed by how down-to-earth Miranda was. For someone leading such a massive company, she was refreshingly approachable and kind.



The moment her phone flickered to life, Miranda saw a flood of missed calls from Verena.



A jolt of panic hit Miranda. Shoot, she'd completely forgotten to turn her phone back on,and Verena had been trying to reach her over and over.
###Chapter 107 Are You Nervous
Not wanting to keep Verena waiting, Miranda grabbed her suitcase and got ready to head out. "Let's catch up another time. Dinner's on me when we meet again."



Kaia chimed in with a cheerful grin, "Oh, there's no way we can let you pay, Miranda. You're Adrian's senior, after all. We should be the ones treating you.Why don't you share your number with us? That way,we can plan something when you're free. We won't keep you any longer-looks like you've got somewhere to be."



Adrian's eyes widened in surprise as he glanced at Kaia,clearly moved by her efforts.



He hadn't expected Kaia to go this far just to snag his idol's contact details.



Miranda, meanwhile, was caught off guard by Kaia's directness.



Her offer had just been a polite gesture, never expecting them actually to take her up on it.


Now that the subject was out in the open, it felt awkward to turn them down. She figured she could always come up with an excuse to cancel later if she needed to.



"Alright,sure."



Miranda rattled off her phone number, and Kaia repeated it back to make sure there were no errors.With that settled, Miranda headed out.


Kaia's grin wouldn't quit; she'd actually gotten Miranda's number.


As the head of one of the world's most powerful companies, Miranda was hardly the type to hand out her number carelessly. Kaia figured that, on top of her connection through Adrian, Miranda must really want to be friends with her.



At the thought of it, Kaia's confidence soared.She felt ready to take on Verena.



If she could build a connection with someone this influential, then even if her parents turned their backs on her, Kaia believed she'd still have a future ahead.



One thing was certain: no matter what happened,she'd never end up worse off than Verena.



Outside the airport, a sleek silver-gray car sat parked by the curb. A young woman in a wool coat leaned against the car,looking relaxed.



Verena's eyes stayed glued to her phone, scrolling absently as she waited.


Miranda spotted Verena instantly after stepping out of the airport.



Dragging her suitcase, she rushed over and wrapped Verena up in a big hug.


"Verena, I've missed you like crazy!"


Right as Verena was about to redial Miranda's number,she found herself nearly tackled by an overenthusiastic Miranda.



So much excitement poured out of Miranda that she put most of her weight on Verena, forcing Verena to brace herself to stay upright. Miranda's arms clung so tightly around her neck that Verena almost gasped for air.



With a quick shove, Verena finally freed herself,taking a deep breath.



She couldn't help but scold, "Why are you still so wild?You should at least try to look the part of a CEO once in a while!" Miranda,never one to care about appearances,tossed an arm around Verena's shoulders and lifted Verena's chin with her fingers. A playful grin tugged at her lips as she teased, "Oh, Evelyn! You get prettier every year. Don't make me beg for a kiss."



Verena laughed and gave Miranda a gentle nudge on the head. "Cut it out! We're not overseas anymore.Don't call me Evelyn here."



Miranda nodded, glancing around as she whispered with a hand over her mouth, "You're right, that name's off-limits here. Fame brings its own headaches,huh?You're talented, so people line up for your help, and a few just to stir up trouble. Feels like you need bodyguards at this point. Trust me, I get it."


Verena just shook her head with a smile and gestured to the car. "Come on, let's go."


Miranda tucked her suitcase into the trunk and hopped into the passenger seat, ready for whatever came next.



"So, what's the plan? Are we heading to your place?"Miranda asked.



Before Verena could reply, Miranda continued, "How's life at home? Are your parents and siblings nice to you?"



After all these years, Miranda had uncovered every  secret and subtle dynamic within Verena's complex family.



Verena navigated through traffic, only answering once they merged onto the main road. With a light laugh,she replied, "Honestly? Things are a mess. We've cut ties."



"What?" Miranda was well aware that Verena wasn't close to her parents, but she never imagined things would fall apart this badly.



"Was it really necessary to go that far?" she asked,her voice dropping.



Both hands tightening around the wheel, Verena kept her gaze straight ahead, her face unreadable. "I'm not the cold one here--it's them. My parents only saw me as a way to climb up the social ladder. All they ever did was use me. My siblings are no better. They've always targeted me. Of course, I wish I had a real family,but not like that."



Miranda focused on the word "targeted," puffing herself up like a bodyguard. "You mean they went after you? Tell me what happened! Next time I see them, I'll set them straight, just watch."



She flipped her hair back, putting on a show like she was ready to march right up and defend Verena.



As the car rolled to a stop at a red light, Verena  reached over and flicked Miranda on the forehead."You're sweet for offering,but really,I can deal with it."



Miranda knew her friend didn't like people meddling in her private business.



Letting out a sigh, she finally backed down.



With the green light, they rolled forward, city lights blurring past.


"So, if you've cut your parents out, where are we actually going?" Miranda wondered aloud.


Verena shot her a playful look. "What, you think just because we're not headed to my parents' place, we've got nowhere to go? I'm about to get married-the bride's supposed to leave from her own home, right?No way I'm staying at a hotel or crashing at the Willis place. I bought myself a villa. That's where you're staying tonight."



Isaac had offered to let Verena use one of his houses for the occasion, hoping to make things easier on her.


But Verena turned him down. She wanted her wedding to be special, something unforgettable, not just another event.



Besides,she'd already hung Shawna's memorial photo in her new place. Home was wherever Shawna's spirit lived.



Miranda let out a low whistle and flashed a dramatic thumbs-up. "Only the legendary doctor,Evelyn,could just buy a villa in Shoildon like it's no big deal. No wonder you're such a hotshot!"



Verena just shook her head, unable to keep a straight face. "Come on, cut it out. Last I checked, you're the CEO of AuroraNexus. Who's richer, really?"



They hadn't seen each other in ages, so the drive to the villa was filled with laughter and stories.



Once they arrived, the maid had already prepped a warm meal. After they'd eaten and both had a shower,it was close to midnight.



Never one to change, Miranda insisted on squeezing into Verena's bed after drying off.



Verena made a show of complaining, but the truth was, she was glad to have her best friend by her side.


As the night quieted down, Miranda reached over and poked Verena's arm. "Tomorrow is your big day. Are you nervous?"



The bedside lamp bathed the room in a gentle,golden glow, making the whole scene feel soft and serene. Verena spent a few seconds gazing up at the ceiling before giving a slight shake of her head. "Honestly? I'm not sure."



It was the truth; she genuinely didn't know.



By all logic, nerves shouldn't have even crossed her mind. She'd already weathered more trials than most people could imagine.


Still, the thought of tomorrow sent her pulse into overdrive, fluttering in a way she wasn't used to.


For a split second, lsaac's face drifted through Verena's thoughts.



Was Isaac feeling the same?



Would Isaac be lying awake, nervous about tomorrow,too?



"But what about-"



Buzz...Buzz...



A sharp buzzing sound cut Miranda off.



Verena glanced at her phone on the nightstand and instantly broke into a soft smile at the name lighting up her screen.



Clutching her phone, she slipped out of bed. "Give me a sec,Miranda. I need to answer this."



Miranda just waved her hand dismissively, grinning. "No need to explain. Your face says it all. It's your man,isn't it? Go on, take your call."
###Chapter 108 Are You Lonely And Restless
That morning, before lsaac had left for the office,Verena had told him she would be staying at her new villa with her friend for the night.


She hadn't expected him to call at such an hour.



Verena darted to the open-air balcony to answer,her lips curving playfully. "We really do share a telepathic bond,don't we?"



Isaac had been lying in bed for quite some time, but sleep refused to come. He picked up a book from the bedside table, turned its pages, and stared at the words for nearly half an hour-yet not a single sentence sank in. Every page only mirrored Verena's face.



After wrestling with his thoughts, he finally chose to call her. He hadn't truly hoped she would pick up, yet,to his surprise, she did.



Leaning back against the headboard, Isaac sounded a little taken aback. "Were you thinking of me too?"



Verena didn't reply directly. Instead, she parried with a question of her own. "And you? What was it tha  kept me in your thoughts?"


As her voice poured through the receiver, Isaac absentmindedly toyed with the corner of his book. "I was wondering if you were nervous."



Resting against the railing, Verena smiled."Funny,my friend just asked me the very same thing."



His curiosity sharpened. "And what was your answer?"



She dodged again, throwing the ball back into his court."Are you nervous?"



Isaac didn't chase her evasions. He let the silence stretch a moment before admitting with a faint smile,"A little."



Verena's grin grew wider at his words, echoing her own heart, her eyes shimmering beneath the bright moonlight.


She teased him lightly, "It's all right. If nerves get the better of you tomorrow, just hide behind me. I'll take the lead. I don't mind being the woman who calls the shots."



Her cheerful laughter rippled through the line, and Isaac couldn't help but be carried along by her joy.


After a spell of lighthearted chatter, Verena grew playful again. "So, how's it going without me tonight? Darling,are you lonely and restless?"



Suddenly,silence fell.



Verena frowned, thinking he might have hung up,but a glance at the screen showed that the call was still connected.Why no sound?



At last, after a good ten seconds, Isaac's low voice reached her. "Tomorrow night, I won't be."


He knew full well she didn't care for him as much as he longed for, but still he couldn't resist her teasing and sweet words.



Before Verena could gather her thoughts, he added,"Get some sleep. Goodnight."



It wasn't until the busy tone echoed in her ear that she snapped back to herself. Wait... what had he just said?Tomorrow night, he wouldn't be.


With her cheeks burning, Verena pressed her hands to her face, wondering if those bold words had truly come from Isaac. Since when had he grown so smooth-tongued?



Meanwhile,Isaac lowered his phone and placed a palm over his chest.



The simple question Verena had tossed at him had sparked a blaze there, and the fire refused to die down.  What unsettled him most was his own heartbeat,hammering so hard it seemed almost loud enough for her to hear.



In those long seconds of silence, he truly feared that Verena might have caught the frantic rhythm of his heart.



He sat still against the headboard,waiting for the storm in his chest to quiet.



The room was utterly silent.



Then, after a long pause, his voice-low and hoarse -slipped into the stillness. "Calm down...stop beating so fast."



Otherwise,the groom who stood before her tomorrow would look less like a young man in love and more like a weary,worn one.







The next morning, Verena finished breakfast with Miranda, just as the makeup artists arrived promptly at seven.



With their skilled hands, Verena and Miranda changed into their wedding gown and bridesmaid dress.



Miranda gave Verena a long look, admiration sparkling in her eyes. "Girl, you look breathtaking." Verena raised a brow and shot back with candor,"You're just as breathtaking."



Each woman had her own artist, which sped up the process considerably.



The villa had been transformed the day before-balloons brightened the ceilings, roses lined the paths,and every corner seemed drenched in festivity.



In the middle of this, Gavin arrived.


"You're here so early?" Verena asked in mild surprise.



Pouring water into their glasses, Gavin answered, "Of course. I'm here to back you up."


"Did you bring what I asked for?" Miranda pressed.


"Wouldn't dare forget it." Gavin slipped a small folded piece of paper from his jacket and handed it to her.


Unable to move much while her makeup was underway, Verena glanced at Miranda through the mirror."What is it?"



Miranda's reflection offered only a mysterious smile."You'll find out soon enough."



That smile set Verena on edge. With such secrecy,trouble was sure to follow. By nine, both were ready.



Since the wedding gown was cumbersome, Miranda helped Verena upstairs to the bedroom,with Gavin trailing behind to carry the train.



The three chatted until Miranda checked the time."The groom should be here any minute. Gavin, go see if they've arrived."


"On it." Gavin nodded and stepped out.


Moments later, he burst back in, excitement spilling over as he shut the door.



"They're here! Just reaching the front gates!"


Hearing this, Miranda swiftly pulled Verena's veil over her face.



Then came footsteps outside.


Three sharp knocks, followed by a lively voice."Beautiful bride, we've come to take you to the ceremony. Come with your handsome groom!"



Verena immediately recognized Stevie's tone.



The groomsmen joined him, chanting in chorus,"Beautiful bride, we've come to take you to the ceremony.Come with your handsome groom!" Miranda called back through the door, "The bride won't walk out so easily. Not a drop of sincerity yet,and not even a glimpse of her."



As she spoke, Gavin braced himself against the door.



Stevie,prompted by Cayden, bargained from outside."At least let the bride say a word to the groom!"



Verena chuckled quietly, imagining Isaac keeping his silence,letting others do the clamoring.



Miranda crossed her arms with a smirk. "We're the bride's guardians today. If you want her voice, you'll have to get through us first."


"Guardians or not, at least let us see the bride!" Slater demanded,pounding the door.


"Exactly, this isn't fair," Bobby chimed in.



Gavin loosened his grip, leaning casually against the frame.



Half in jest, he said, "Bobby, this door won't yield so easily. I still remember those punches you gave me last time. Unless Isaac makes it up to me, neither he nor you will see the bride."


Verena knew Gavin was bluffing; he wouldn't truly bar the way. Besides, the groomsmen would find a way  around it, so she stayed quiet.



Miranda, however, blinked in surprise and turned to Verena. "Hold on-what's this about? Gavin got beaten up?"



Her tone grew excited.


Verena chuckled. "I'll explain later."


Just then, Isaac's amused voice sounded from the other side. "I'll compensate-with interest."



Something thin and rigid slid under the door.



Gavin bent to pick it up and blinked. It was a bank card.



"Wow, that's generous!" Gavin exclaimed,stunned."I was only teasing; no need for lsaac to get so worked up,right?" ###Chapter 109 So Cheesy



Miranda's eyes went wide as she glanced at Verena."Is your man really that desperate to see you?"



Verena let out a laugh. "Yes. Now quit stalling and let him through."



Miranda threw on an exaggerated pout, pretending to be jealous. "Alright, alright, you're already taking his side."



Gavin accepted the bank card-a token of the groom's sincerity-and hurried to open the door.



The moment the door swung open, Isaac rolled his wheelchair into the room at top speed, his groomsmen hustling in right behind him.


Verena sat at the edge of the bed, every inch the flawless bride,her gown flowing gracefully around her,and her makeup so impeccable that it captured everyone's attention.



Bobby was the first to find his voice, openly awestruck."Seriously, Verena, I've never seen a bride look this stunning."


Slater clutched his chest like a lovesick fool, sighing dramatically. "Man, I really blew it. I should've had the guts to chase after you when I had the chance."



Bobby shot a look at Cayden and the others, smirking."You guys hear that? Somebody needs to teach this guy a lesson."



The celebration brought out everyone's playful side,even Cayden and his friends, who were usually the picture of maturity, jumped right in to join forces with Bobby,grabbing Slater by the arms and giving him a round of playful kicks.



The room erupted in laughter and good-natured chaos, the air buzzing with excitement.



Off to the side, Miranda and Gavin couldn't help but crack up at the spectacle.



Isaac spared a glance for the rowdy crew behind him,and then focused all his attention on Verena, seated on the bed.



His favorite people were right there, but the woman he cherished most was front and center.



Even if her heart wasn't fully his yet, Isaac was grateful for this moment. He made a silent promise that he'd do whatever it took to earn her love.



Amid all the laughter and commotion, Isaac slowly rolled his wheelchair toward Verena. He stopped right in front of her, holding out his hand "Verena, come with me."



With a warm smile, Verena started to reach for him,but another hand caught hers first.



"Wait a second."



The room went quiet as every man turned to look.Verena and Isaac both glanced up at Miranda.



A puzzled look crossed Verena's face. The thought flashed through her mind that Miranda was gearing up to put lsaac on the spot.



Isaac shot Miranda a slightly puzzled look, recognition flickering in his eyes.



Wasn't that Miranda Brown, the CEO of AuroraNexus?



They'd met once at a party, and Isaac always kept track of impressive young leaders.



So this was one of Verena's friends?



Noticing Isaac's stare, Miranda shot back a fierce glare,her inner monologue snapping, "Yeah, I know l'm good-looking. No need to gawk."



Pushing her thoughts aside, Miranda set her jaw and addressed Isaac directly. "You've cleared Gavin's hurdles, but you haven't even faced the bridesmaid's  challenge yet."


Familiar with Miranda's knack for stirring up trouble,Verena reached over and squeezed her hand."Miranda,please, don't start any trouble now."



Miranda was gearing up for a comeback when a calm,deep voice broke in. "Alright. Tell me what it'll take to pass."



Miranda's lips curled into a sly, mischievous grin at Isaac's response.


From somewhere seemingly out of thin air, Miranda pulled out a folded slip of paper, smoothed it out, and handed it to lsaac.



She held up a finger with mock seriousness. "Here's the deal. Read every single word on this page, no skipping,no editing. Then you're good to go."



Bobby and the rest of the crew crowded in for a peek,each of their faces morphing into various stages of disbelief as they scanned the text.



Bobby gave his scalp a good scratch. "Oh man,this is so cheesy!"



Slater tried not to laugh. "This is giving me secondhand embarrassment."



Leonardo eyed Isaac, clearly concerned. "Does Isaac even know how to say stuff like this?"


Cayden nudged Stevie, giggling.an you picture Isaac actually reading this out loud?"



Stifling a laugh behind his hand,Stevie chimed in on Cayden's comment, "If he read that out loud, then the mysterious, stoic image I had of him would be completely ruined."



The whole conversation floated over to Isaac, but he didn't flinch. He simply gave the paper a scan,taking the challenge seriously.



Seated opposite Isaac, Verena couldn't make out what was written on the paper. The comments from Bobby and the rest only deepened her sense of dread.



She tugged on Miranda's sleeve, unable to hide her curiosity. "What did you write?"



Miranda just grinned, keeping it mysterious. "You'll find out soon enough."


Isaac finished reading, and then lifted his eyes, a small,knowing smile playing at the corners of his lips.



This was nothing he couldn't handle.



He turned to Verena, his tone soft and full of warmth."Verena." Verena's attention snapped to Isaac, curiosity piqued.



"Starting today, you're my wife. And from this moment on, I swear I'll stick to the 'seven secrets of a happy marriage.'"



A puzzled look flickered in Verena's eyes.



Isaac leaned in a little closer, gently taking her hand and flashing a laid-back grin. With a soft, playful tone,he recited. "Number one: Always tag along when my wife heads out. Number two: Listen up whenever my wife gives an order. Number three: Agree, even if my wife's in the wrong. Number four: Stand by patiently while my wife gets ready. Number five: Don't blink when my wife goes shopping. Number six: Keep my cool whenever my wife's mad. And number seven: Never, ever forget my wife's birthday."



A chorus of "Whoa!" echoed through the room.


Bobby called out, "Isaac, that was seriously so cheesy!"



As soon as lsaac finished, the groomsmen burst into laughter, hooting and hollering like a bunch of monkeys.



Verena couldn't stop herself from laughing, her giggles slipping out before she could even try to hide them.She never would have guessed Isaac, usually so reserved and proper, could pull off something this cheesy with such an easy smile.



Miranda was nearly in tears from laughing so hard,fanning her cheeks as she declared, "Okay, you win!Go on, your bride's waiting."
###Chapter 110 Alumna



At Miranda's words, the group of friends and family gathered close, surrounding Verena and Isaac as they descended the grand staircase.



The newlyweds got into their wedding car, followed by a convoy so long it seemed to stretch like a dragon across the road.



The ceremony unfolded at the ShineHaven Grand Hotel.



"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the bride and groom!"



With the emcee's booming voice, a waiter pushed open the heavy doors. Verena wheeled Isaac along the plush carpet, entering slowly as dreamy,romantic music floated through the air.


The vast hall glittered under the lights. Every table flanking the carpet was filled to capacity. Petals blanketed the floor, fresh roses adorned the room,and reporters stood in neat rows, waiting for the perfect shot.



The splendor and romance were just as Verena had always pictured. Halfway down, Isaac turned his head slightly and asked in a quiet tone, "Are you satisfied?"



His question struck a chord in Verena, making her suddenly realize something. She asked, "So you planned all this? No wonder the roses are everywhere.You called last time because you didn't know what l liked."



Isaac gave no clear answer-neither a nod nor denial.



Leaning in, she whispered at his ear, "I'm more than satisfied."



The tender moment between them was immediately captured by cameramen nearby, and naturally, the guests noticed it too.



In a corner, Kaia stared at the couple on the carpet,her fists clenching tight. Verena's every move was like a calculated step on a chessboard-she had crushed Kaia into the mud, leaving her ridiculed, while she herself soared to the summit of admiration, bathed in envious stares.



At last, Verena and Isaac reached the stage. After completing the formalities, the emcee raised his microphone toward Isaac. "Now, we invite the groom to recite his wedding vows."



This,in fact, was Isaac's own request. Taking the microphone, Isaac turned to Verena and spoke steadily. "Before I met you, I never imagined loving anyone so deeply. After meeting you, I never imagined loving anyone else. From this moment forward,you are my wife-sharing both my triumphs and my trials. I hereby declare half of my personal assets will belong to you. Your thoughts are my thoughts; your opinions, my opinions. Whoever disrespects you, disrespects me."



Verena hadn't expected such a vow. Isaac was never one to flaunt wealth or status, but this was clearly his proclamation to Shoildon's elite-that he cherished her as his wife and demanded their respect.



Her eyes brimmed with tears. Bending down, she slipped the ring onto his finger.


"I've heard your vows. I'll be the best wife I can be,and together we'll walk hand in hand through every season of life."



Their smiles met like sunlight breaking through clouds.


When Isaac finished, a stir rippled across the hall.



Everyone present understood-the first half of Isaac's vow was meant for Verena, but the second half was a declaration to the entire gathering, perhaps even to the city itself. And when Isaac openly promised to transfer half his personal fortune,shock spread like wildfire.Aside from Bennett Group,he held countless enterprises-wealth others couldn't amass in generations. And yet,he offered it away so easily?



"Wasn't it said Isaac despised this marriage and even struck against Willis Group? How could he give away such a fortune? Is that what dissatisfaction looks like?"



"Yes, that was the rumor. What's the truth here?"


"But if he truly loves Verena, why move against Alec -her own father?"



As the murmurs swelled, Alec's and Laura's faces turned pale.



At one table, Luka chewed his food carelessly,muttering, "Isaac must be out of his mind."



Kaia's fury mounted; she ground her teeth,clutching her glass until her knuckles cracked.



At another table, Barrie gazed at the couple on stage with a face full of quiet satisfaction.


After the ceremony, Isaac and Verena changed their attire and began making the rounds, toasting guests.



From the sidelines, Kaia seethed as she watched the couple,glowing with joy amid the crowd. She ground her teeth in resentment. Why? Why should Verena have both Isaac's love and devotion? The thought gnawed at her like a stone in the shoe.She could not accept it.



Thinking of her plan, Kaia let out a cold scoff. Verena could laugh all she wanted now. The higher she was lifted, the harder she'd fall. When she shamed Isaac before all of Shoildon's elite, Kaia wondered if Verena could still keep that smile.



From across the room, Slater, while chatting casually,caught sight of Kaia's bitter expression-as though she were hatching a plan.



Excusing himself, he approached her with a glass of wine in hand.



Without concealing his bite, he asked, "Jealous,seeing Verena happy despite all your schemes?"



Kaia shot him a glance, lips curving. "Yes, I'm jealous."


With that, she swirled her wine and turned away as though dismissing him.



Slater blinked, expecting venom but receiving composure instead. Something felt wrong.



His frown deepened-was Kaia truly plotting something? Meanwhile,Kaia,glass in hand, drifted toward a cluster of elites, taking up a spot easy to overlook. She and Verena had fallen out, so Verena surely wouldn't toast her directly. But the couple couldn't skip the others,could they?



And so it happened-Verena and Isaac drew near.



After toasting a few acquaintances, Adrian took a glance at Kaia and suddenly stepped forward, raising his glass before Verena.



"Mrs.Bennett, I hear you're also a Pine Hill University graduate. What a coincidence. Congratulations, my alumna."



Verena looked at Adrian, sensing his hostility,and asked curiously, "Alumna?"



Adrian replied with a smile, "Yes, I'm a Pine Hill University graduate, too. But it's a pity-a gorgeous fellow student like you attended university in the exact same year as me, and yet l've never once caught sight of you or even heard a peep about you."



His words carried an implication that made others feel there was more to it.


Just then, a young woman burst from the crowd,seizing Verena's arm. "Verena, it's really you! I never thought you'd do so well-marrying into wealth!" she exclaimed.



Verena looked at her in puzzlement. "You are?"


"Don't you remember? We studied at the same community college, old schoolmates. We even joined activities together. Back then, we always joked you'd land a rich husband because of your beauty. And now you really have!" Her voice rang loud and clear,drawing attention all around.Gasps spread through the hall.



"What's going on?"



"Wasn't Verena a Pine Hill UJniversity graduate? How does community college come into it?"



"It must be false. Why would lsaac marry someone from a community college?"


"But first it's Pine Hill, then community college-what's true anymore?"



"What's to doubt? Likely she lied, ashamed of her education."



Listening to the murmur, Barrie's eyes narrowed.Leaning on his cane, he asked Fletcher, "Who's behind this trick?"



Fletcher scanned the room,replying,"I'll find out." Meanwhile, Verena, still held by the woman,stood calm as a lake untouched by wind, her face betraying no ripple of emotion.



Isaac, however, fixed Adrian with a cold stare, his thoughts running deep as the tide.
###Chapter 111 Allow Me To Introduce Myself As Your Senior

The entire hall remained alive with murmurs and hushed conversations.



"Everyone was fooled by the Wills family's trickery,weren't they? I doubt the Willises ever thought their secret would be dragged into the light in such a humiliating fashion."



"That's the reason people dismiss Verena as nothing more than a small-town girl. Dishonesty clings to her,and no one can tell anymore when she's lying or telling the truth."


"The Willis family has brought disgrace on themselves. Their lie about Verena's educational background was exposed at the wedding, and the shame doesn't just stain Verena. It smears the entire family name." "Climbers like them never shed their rough edges.They lack refinement, and their children carry the same flaws."


"Willis Group's standing in the business world wil surely take a blow after this."


"Bankruptcy seems to be where this family is headed now."


Every whisper around Laura pierced deeper, and the words "climbers" and "boankruptcy" stripped the color from her cheeks. Right then, her hatred for Verena festered, though her resentment burned even hotter for the one who had chosen to expose Verena's lies.


Anger coursed through Alec as well. His cheeks flushed red, his mouth pressed shut, and his eyes glared with fire.


While Laura drowned in humiliation, Alec sensed something deeper. He remembered Kaia claiming Verena had lied about her education a few days earlier.The thought made his chest rise sharply. Even if Verena had never gone to Pine Hill University,even if the lie was true, humiliating her before everyone was still cruel. The shame didn't fall on Verena alone but smeared the Willis family as a whole. He had warned Kaia not to create trouble during the wedding, but she ignored him and brushed aside his words.


His temper pushed him toward confronting her,though he forced himself to hold back and wait for events to unfold.


Grinding his teeth, Alec wrestled with his anger and fought the urge to shatter the wine glass in his hand.


Bobby and Slater listened to the crowd, and the worry on their faces grew clearer with every word.


With a deep frown, Bobby looked at the strange woman, baffled. "Who let this woman in? What on earth is going on? How can someone just barge into the wedding?"


Slater looked just as stunned. Remembering the bitterness on Kaia's face from their earlier talk, a  thought struck him, and he blurted out, "Wait, could that lunatic Kaia be behind this?"



Bobby's face hardened as he seized Slater by the collar. "What did you just say about Kaia?"


Caught off guard, Slater stammered, "I don't know for certain, but let's go find out."


Spectators crowded around Verena, and the number of onlookers swelled as more pressed in to see the scene.



Isaac glared coldly at Adrian, about to speak, when Verena laid a calming hand on his shoulder.


When Isaac lifted his eyes to her, Verena answered with a tranquil smile that told him she could manage it herself.


At her signal, Isaac gave a slight nod.


Through the throng, Verena directed her gaze straight to Kaia standing at the rear.


Verena's eyes glinted with cold detachment as they  locked with Kaia's taunting grin.


Turning her attention back to the woman in front of her, Verena remarked deliberately, "You say we went to the same community college. So tell me, which one? Where is it? And what year was | supposedly admitted to that college?"


Step by step, Verena advanced as she spoke, her composed manner pressing heavily on the woman before her.


The woman had only been told to repeat the prepared lines, with no real details to rely on.


Unease spread across her face as her eyes flickered nervously, and she blurted out, "It was Lanteglos Community College, and you attended college in 2014."


At the reply, Verena let out a light, careless laugh.11SO1Lanteglos Community College, 2014..."


After a brief pause, she shifted her gaze to Adrian."This man claims he went to the same school l did.  Strange, isn't it? On my wedding day, without me inviting anyone, two supposed alumni just happen to show up."


With a faintly amused smile tugging at her lips,Verena went on, "I never said which year I attended university, yet you insist we were classmates. Tell me,sir, what year did you attend university?"


Verena's pointed words tied Adrian to the woman,hinting at their collusion. The logic held, because Verena had not revealed the year she attended university, leaving no reason for Adrian to know it.


The reaction unfolded as expected, with the crowd looking puzzled and unable to make sense of the situation.


Adrian understood that the ruse could not last, since their arrival looked far too coincidental. Still, that meant little to him, because his only aim was to expose Verena's lie, no matter whose plan it had been,


Without hesitation, he answered, "I attended university in 2016, majoring in Computer Science."


"2016," Verena repeated softly. "That explains why you've never heard of me."


A calm smile spread across Verena's face as she spoke with deliberate clarity. "Since you're unfamiliar with me, allow me to introduce myself as your senior.I am Verena Willis. I was admitted to Pine Hill University in 2015, majoring in Clinical Medicine."


The specifics left Adrian stunned for only a moment before Verena added, "As it happens, one of my friends was also in your department. I'll call her over,and she can explain just how large Pine Hill University is, with so many students that not knowing a name is hardly surprising."


Right then, Miranda came back from fixing her makeup behind the scenes. Spotting the cluster of people, she caught bits of the ongoing talk as she approached.


When she saw Verena trapped in the crowd, Miranda forced her way forward and asked, "What's  happening here?"
###Chapter 112 Genuine Graduate Of Pine Hill University
"There you are, I was about to call you," said Verena as she turned to Miranda. "This man insists he's from Pine Hill University, yet strangely, he acts as though he doesn't even understand how vast the campus is.He claims not knowing me is proof I never graduated from there. And before I had the chance to respond,another woman jumped in, saying | was her classmate at some community college. Can you step in and confirm that I truly graduated from Pine Hill University?"


With wide eyes, Adrian fixed his gaze on Miranda."Miranda?"



The thought that Miranda could really be Verena's friend was something he struggled to accept.


The moment Miranda appeared, the distinguished guests grew restless. The younger heirs were too inexperienced with family businesses to recognize her. The older executives had dealt with overseas corporations for years, so they knew who she was right away.


A wave of astonishment rippled through the crowd.


"That's Ms. Brown!"



"Hasn't she settled overseas? What's she doing here?"





"Hold on, is Verena's friend actually Ms. Brown?"


"Could Ms. Brown really have come all this way just to attend Verena's wedding?"


"Who is this Ms. Brown anyway?" one of the newly rich businessmen asked in confusion.



"Are you serious? You don't know who she is?"someone nearby responded. "Surely you've heard of AuroraNexus,"



"Of course, everyone knows it's the sixth largest conglomerate in the world." "Her full name is Miranda Brown. She graduated with honors from Pine Hlill University and today she's the CEO of AuroraNexus."



"What? She's that young?"


Someone else shook his head with a sigh of respect."Her age doesn't mean a thing. Her ability is far beyond anything we could ever compete with."


By listening carefully to Verena, Miranda caught on that Adrian and the woman were intentionally stirring up trouble for Verena.


Miranda laid a protective hand gently on Verena's shoulder.



"So, the claim is that Verena didn't graduate from Pine Hill University, isn't it?" she asked, throwing a glance toward Adrian. "Showing off about schools may not be admirable, but certain truths must be made clear. Otherwise, there will always be people ready to misjudge and belittle my closest friend."


Miranda fixed Adrian with a cold look full of disdain. "Listen closely. Verena is a true graduate of Pine HHill University. She's not only my fellow alumna but also my dearest friend. If you dare to look down on her,you insult me as well. If you stand against her, then you stand against me."


The moment she finished, the crowd erupted into a stir.



The intent of Miranda's words was unmistakable.She was openly pledging her support for Verena, and by tying their friendship to Pine Hill University, she hinted that Verena could never have been a mere community college graduate. Without that shared background, Verena would never have even crossed paths with her.


"Could Verena actually be a graduate of Pine Hill University?"


"If Ms. Browvn herself says so, then it has to be true."


"Then how do we explain those two who came forward before?" "I think this must have been part of a setup!"


As Miranda's declaration sank in, the elite guests broke into murmurs among themselves.


The ones who didn't know the truth of the matter were quickly influenced by the opinions and gestures around them.



Slater and Bobby had never doubted Verena, so the question of her degree barely crossed their minds.What they were truly trying to take in was the shocking revelation about Miranda.


Slater blinked hard, snapping his mouth shut before blurting out, "Unbelievable, the stunning bridesmaid we were talking to is really the CEO of AuroraNexus!"


Bobby looked just as bewildered. "Who could have guessed?"


Laura gripped the hem of her dress with force, a wave of relief washing over her at the news that Verena was cleared. Thankfully, that troublesome girl wouldn't be pulling them down. Yet as Miranda's  words lingered, an unspoken regret flickered in her gaze. Verena truly had luck on her side. Had she realized just how capable Verena was, she never would have treated her so poorly.


The moment Miranda came into view, Alec pushed himself up sharply from his chair. Hiseyes narrowed,uncertain if he was seeing correctly, but the whispers around him confirmed she really was the CEO of AuroraNexus, twisting his expression into something conflicted.



"We're glad to hear your daughter's name has been cleared, Mr. Willis. You must be relieved."


"That's right, Mr. Willis. You absolutely need to uncover who attempted to ruin such an important event."



The businessmen's demeanor flipped in an instant.Only minutes before, they had kept their distance from him because of Verena, yet now they forced smiles and lifted their glasses as though none of it had ever happened.  Alec didn't wish to answer, but with a rigid smile, he responded, "Of course, certainly."


While the words left his mouth, Kaia's remarks from a few days ago echoed in his head, and a sudden realization struck him.


Kaia's complexion turned ghostly, her lips fading into a purplish hue as allvitality drained from her.


From within the crowd, she felt the change in the air and stumbled backward a few steps, her legs trembling so badly she nearly collapsed.


Her retreat continued, yet her gaze clung desperately to Verena.


"Why?" Kaia asked, her voice so faint she could barely hear it herself.


Nothing could explain how things had ended up like this. Miranda was meant to be Adrian's connection,not Verena's. After all the effort Kaia put in to get Miranda's contact information, finding out now that Miranda belonged firmly on Verena's side felt like a  cruel twist.



The disappointment was suffocating. Why did Verena find everything so easily, while Kaia was left empty-handed, no matter how hard she tried?
###Chapter 113 Kaia Was The Mastermind
Kaia burned with anger, desperate to demand an explanation from Verena for the cruel deception. Why go through the trouble of pretending to be useless,only to throw the truth back at her in the most humiliating way?


Her parents said Verena quit school. They insisted she was undereducated. Yet now she stood as a proud graduate of Pine Hill University, linked arm in arm with the CEO of AuroraNexus. The whole thing felt like a bitter joke.


Even so, Kaia swallowed her rage. She lacked the standing to challenge Verena, and she knew it. The odds were stacked against her, so she used the growing commotion as cover and started edging her way out of the crowd.


All the while, Slater never took his eyes off her. The instant he noticed her retreat, he closed the distance in a few strides, caught her by the arm, and smirked."Cause a scene, then think you can just slip away?Not so fast," he said.


Her panic had already left her unsteady, and his sudden grip knocked the strength out of her legs.She lunged for the table tokeep herself upright,but in doing so, she yanked the tablecloth down. In an instant, she landed on the floor as glasses toppled and wine splashed across her. Humiliation soaked her more deeply than the red stains on her dress.


The shattering glass silenced the room, every eye now locked on her.


From across the hall, Adrian rushed forward the moment he saw her fall. He bent down quickly and reached for her arm. "Kaia, are you hurt?" he asked,worry etched in his voice.


Verena watched from her corner, idly swirling her wine with a satisfied smile tugging at her lips. "So,this gentleman has ties to my sister. That explains why he went to such lengths to accuse me," she said, her tone sharp enough to cut through the air.


Adrian's hand faltered, his words dying before they could leave his mouth.



Verena's pointed remark left no room for doubt,forcing everyone around them to face the truth.


Whispers filled the air as curious glances turned toward Adrian and Kaia, and the tension grew heavy.


Meanwhile, the woman who had earlier boasted about being Verena's old schoolmate began to inch backward. Hoping to avoid notice, she slipped toward the edge of the crowd, praying to vanish before anyone thought to question her again.


The moment she tried to slip away, Verena's sharp eyes caught her, and she yanked her back to stand face-to-face with Kaia.



Kaia had stirred up trouble for her time and again,and Verena was determined not to let her escape the consequences this time.


With a tone as sharp as ice, Verena sneered,"Who put you up to this? Who told you to drag my name through the dirt?"


Her questions were aimed at the woman, while her glare stayed locked on Kaia, a chill radiating from Verena's eyes with every word.


The woman cast a nervous look at Kaia, her expression torn between fear and loyalty, but her lips stayed tightly sealed.


That silence only hardened Verena's resolve. She twisted the woman's wrist until a cry of pain broke free.



"You heard what everyone said earlier," Verena remarked, her voice cutting through the crowd."My closest friend happens to be the CEO of AuroraNexus. Think about it. Do you really want me as your enemy-or someone far less powerful?"


Isaac, watching from the sidelines, felt a deep crease form in his brow. A wife should lean on her husband when things turn ugly. Yet in this moment, Verena chose Miranda instead of him. Shouldn't hebe the  one she trusted most?


His gaze dropped, frustration weighing heavily in his chest.





The name AuroraNexus alone made the woman pale -that was why she had tried to flee earlier. Although she didn't know the company, the wary glances from the wealthy guests had told her she had picked the wrong target. She had realized Verena was not someone she could afford to cross.


Fear loosened her tongue at last. "I'll confess! I'll confess!" she blurted out, her body trembling.


Backing away, she pointed toward Kaia, stammering,"It was... Miss Kaia Willis. She ordered me to ruin your wedding. She said to claim you came from some unknown college like me. She promised one hundred thousand dollars once I finished the job."


Gasps rippled through the hall, and the guests quickly began whispering among themselves.


"So Kaia was the mastermind all along." "How could she do this to her own sister on her wedding day?"


"You must not know their story. They were raised apart, so there's no bond between them. Kaia probably wanted to drag Verena down below her."


"That's right. And don't forget Slater's post. Every rumor about Verena's so-called fake background and her supposed arrogance came straight from Kaia.Let's be honest-none of us even knew Verena before this, so who else could dig up those details besides her own family? Kaia clearly doesn't care about her sister. She just wanted to destroy her."


Color drained from Alec's face as the crowd whispered around him.


Nearby, a few of the city's elite couldn't resist piling on.


One of the influential men clicked his tongue and sneered, "At the end of the day, this is nothing but family shame.Having sisters who turn on each other says a lot about the way the Willis family raised astermind them."


Another man barked out a laugh. "Raised them?More like trained them to compete in secret and choke on jealousy."


"Ha-ha..." The group around them erupted in laughter, their voices echoing with cruelty.


Pain twisted inside Alec as their mockery cut into him like blades. His hands clamped down on his knees,but the pressure in his chest left him struggling to breathe. He couldn't stand the humiliation a second longer.


On unsteady legs, Alec rose and strode toward Kaia.


The gossip unsettled Laura, and she hurried after him. "Where are you going?" she asked, her voice tight.


Alec shot her a cold look. "To clean upo the disaster,"he said flatly.


Forcing his way through the gawking crowd, Alec stopped in front of Verena. He straightened his back and addressed the guests with a heavy voice. "Everyone, my younger daughter's reckless behavior caused tonight's chaos.I ask for your understanding and hope you'll forgive her."



Then he addressed Verena, saying, "Your sister humiliated you on a day meant for joy. I'll be taking Kaia home, and I promise she'll answer for this."


Kaia's arm was seized in his grasp, and he pulled her harshly toward the exit.


Behind them, Laura rushed forward, Luka following right after.


Adrian's body tensed at the sight and he started to move, but a voice stopped him cold. "Mr. Carter."


Adrian turned around immediately, only to meet Isaac's unyielding gaze, sharp enough to pin him in place.


Isaac didn't have to stand to make people uneasy.Just sitting there, he carried himself with a quiet authority that kept everyone on edge.


Adrian remembered his father's warning well-Isaac Bennett never forgave insults and carried a reputation for decisiveness.


The thought left Adrian uneasy, and he swallowed hard before asking, "What do you need from me?"


Isaac raised his chin and spoke coldly. "We're not finished here. Your father and I have always kept our business apart, and l've always seen him as a man who deserves respect. I won't move against the Carter family because of your actions today. Still,you crossed a line. Shouldn't you be offering my wife an apology?"


Miranda's presence made Adrian think twice, and the realization hit him-she would never align herself with someone undeserving. If Verena lacked integrity,Miranda would never have called her a friend.


That clarity pushed Adrian to bow his head before Verena. "Mrs. Bennett, I acted poorly. It was a careless mistake, and I hope you'll pardon me." No trace of forgiveness showed in Verena's eyes.After a short glance, she spoke evenly. "Whatever connection you may share with Kaia, let me offer you this-be mindful of the company you keep, or you'll bring harm not only to others but to yourself."
A slight pause followed before her smile returned."And since you were never invited tonight, Mr. Carter,I'll have to ask you to leave."
The whispers around the room grew louder, and embarrassment weighed heavily on Adrian. He mumbled another apology, and then walked away with his head lowered.
###Chapter 114 Are You Let Down By Me
By the time the last guest left and the wedding wound down, the clock had already pushed past ten.


Once they returned to Seraphina Villas, both Verena and Isaac showered. Later, Verena settled at her vanity, carefully going through her skincare routine.


When Isaac wheeled himself out of the bathroom,she helped him ease onto the bed so he could rest.


His eyes swept the space around him. Festive decorations filled the bedroom, new linens brightened the bed, and above the headboard,a framed wedding portrait stared back at him.


Every detail pressed the same truth into his mind-this was their wedding night.


A sudden tension crept into his expression, his lips pressing thin as unease clouded his gaze. Tonight should have been the night for intimacy,but his condition made that impossible.


His gaze dropped to the new blanket covering his legs.


When Verena finished her routine, she noticed Isaac's slumped posture and troubled face.


Confused, she walked over, took his face between her hands, and tilted it up. "Why the long face?Today's supposed to be a celebration. Smile for me,"she said softly.


Her skin carried the faint fragrance of her lotions,and Isaac breathed it in as he murmured, "Are you let down by me?"


Verena frowned slightly. "Let down? What are you talking about?"


It took him a moment before he confessed, voice low."We're married now. This is supposed to be a romantic night for intimacy. But with my health...I can't give you what you deserve." Before he could say more, Verena cut him off with a laugh. "Honestly, who still clings to that idea? Just because it's our wedding night doesn't mean we have to do anything. And between you and me, I'm exhausted after the long day. I don't think either of us has the energy for more."


She leaned closer, pressing her forehead against his."So quit worrying. I'm fine with things just as they are."



A faint twitch passed through Isaac's brows as he dropped his gaze, his eyes settling blankly on the deep red of Verena's lips.


Did she truly mean that... or did she simply not want any real intimacy with him?


Would her answer be the same if the man before her wasn't him but the first love she once cherished?


That thought looped in lsaac's head until the pressure in his throat forced him back into the present. No-that wasn't right.


Verena belonged to him now, his wife by choice and by law. Not even the shadow of the man she once adored could take her away.


"Are you getting drowsy?" Verena asked as she suddenly let go of him.


Isaac blinked a few times, forcing the conflict from his expression so she wouldn't catch on.


He gave the smallest shake of his head. "Not exactly."





Her gaze lingered on him, and a sly smile tugged at her lips. With one finger, she traced down the edge of his collar until it hooked around the final button."Then maybe we ought to find something else to pass the time."


A pulse throbbed against his temples, and for a moment he had no words.


Hadn't she just said she was too exhausted for anything? Why change her mind so suddenly?


Before he could voice the question, Verena hopped from the bed with a burst of laughter. "Never mind.You don't need to give me an answer.Since you've got too much on your mind to rest, I'll just give you another treatment session instead. Wait here-I'll fetch the medical kit."


Not giving him the chance to argue, she darted out of the room and soon came back with the slim medical case in hand.


Isaac remained slow to react until the first silver needle pierced his skin, sending a sharp jolt along his nerves.



So this was what she had meant by "something else"-it was tending to his health.



**.


At the gates of Willis Villa, the car rolled to a stop.Alec climbed out first, dragging Kaia behind himas her cries of pain cut through the night, proof of the strength in his grip.


Startled by the sudden uproar, Laura and Luka exchanged uneasy looks. Snapping at the servants who lingered nearby, Laura yelled, "What are you standing around for? Leave at once!" Luka, however,hurried after Alec to see what was happening.


Seething with rage, Alec dragged Kaia into the living room and shoved her forward with such force she stumbled.


Thrown off balance, Kaia nearly crashed to the floor.


"Dad..." Kaia called out, but a sudden slap cut through the air and struck her cheek hard. The sound rang out, sharp and unforgiving. Her face flushed with heat as pain rippled through her in an instant.


With his hand still trembling, Alec jabbed a finger toward her, his voice rough with fury. "I told you not to cause trouble at Verena's wedding. You didn't listen. Now you'll pay for it."

 
Panicked, Kaia spun to run upstairs, but his hand caught her hair and yanked her backward.


Fueled by anger, Alec dragged her down and threw her onto the sofa, his palm striking her again and again before she could even raise her arms.


Her ears rang until the room seemed to vanish, tears spilling over bruises as her hair tangled wildly across her face.


Laura and Luka burst in at that moment, horrified by the sight.


Laura rushed forward to seize Alec's arm, while Luka bent to help Kaia up from the cushions.


When Kaia finally lifted her head, her face was so swollen and bruised Luka could barely recognize her."Kaia..." he whispered in shock.


Seeing her daughter's condition, Laura's voice cracked as she screamed, "Stop, Alec! Stop it before you kill her!"


Alec's chest rose and fell heavily as he wrenched his arm free , shoving Laura aside so she collapsed to the  floor.



"Kaia ended up like this because you kept shielding her. Do you even see what we've done? We've seriously offended Verena and the entire Bennett family. If you keep standing up for her, she'll drag this whole family down with her."


His voice thundered through the house, each word ringing in Laura's ears. Fear gripped her so tightly her teeth chattered, and though she wanted to defend Kaia,she knew Alec spoke the truth.


The Bennett family was far beyond their reach.


And Verena had become someone they could never afford to cross.
###Chapter 115 I'm Still Crazy About Him

Luka wasn't troubled by Laura's worries. His mind was fixed on the fact that his sister had been brutally beaten.


When Alec's fists tightened and it looked like he might lash out again, Luka stepped between them,placing Kaia behind his back. "Dad, don't do anything rash! Please try to calm down. I get that you're furious, but we need to find out the truth first.There's a real chance Kaia's being framed here-someone else might be behind this..."


Kaia cut him off, her voice clear. "No. I'm the one who did it."


Lying to Alec would only make things worse. She was done pretending.


With her face red and swollen, Kaia glared at her father, her eyes burning with resentment. "What now? You planning to kill me or something? Your entire life revolves around keeping up appearances.You never cared about any of your daughters, not really."


Her words struck Alec like a slap, landing exactly where it hurt most.


His features twisted with rage, and he spat out,11|S that so? Then I'll do as you say-I'll beat my ungrateful daughter to death right now."


Before he could lift his hand a second time, Laura and Luka stepped in and held him back.



"Get your hands off me! Let go!" Alec yelled;his voice rough as he fought against the two holding him down.



Kaia flashed him one last look of defiance, pushed herself up from the sofa, and bolted for the door.Alec's voice chased her down the hall. "If you're so bold, don't ever set foot in this house again!"


Without the slightest pause, Kaia bolted from the villa. She raced out into the open, but in a place this  remote, there wasn't a taxi in sight.


Her breath came in ragged gasps as she finally slowed, her chest burning.


At least her phone was still with her. With trembling hands, she dialed Adrian.


"Kaia?" The sound of his voice felt like a lifeline in a storm.


Her words broke apart as she said, "Adrian, my father nearly beat me to death. I just managed to get away,and I have nowhere to go. Can you come for me?"


Adrian's reply was hesitant. His mind flashed back to Isaac's warning at the wedding.


With his father still holding the reins of the family business, Adrian had no room for error-especially now, with every move being watched to gauge whether he was fit to take over. Crossing Isaac could cost him more than pride. It could put the entire company at risk.


The silence stretched before Adrian finally spoke, his voice low. "Kaia, I'm sorry. I just can't step in this time."



The line went dead.


The steady beep on the other end left Kaia frozen,her mind reeling with disbelief.


He had never once gone against her wishes-Adrian had always done as she asked.


How could this be happening?


Desperate, she dialed his number again, but this time, all she reached was his voicemail.


Kaia's fingers clenched the phone so hard, her knuckles lost all color. Though her teeth had broken the skin on her lip, she didn't feel a thing.


Numb to everything except the burning hatred that filled her chest, she pinned all the blame on Verena.


In her mind, Verena was the one who had driven everyone she loved far away.


A sudden crack of thunder tore through the sky,and within seconds, the rain came down in sheets,giving her no time to find shelter.


Drenched to the bone, Kaia's hair clung to her skin and her makeup ran down her cheeks, leaving her looking like some haunted specter in the downpour.


Thunder rolled again, louder this time.


It wasn't until that moment that Kaia thought to find Cover.



The storm made it almost impossible to see, and after a few steps, she lost her footing, tumbling into a puddle and scraping her hands and knees. Rainwater mixed with fresh tears on her face, hot and cold running together.


Blood welled from her scraped skin, and as she watched it trickle down, Kaia's eyes turned glassy and red, veins standing out.


It hit her then-she truly had no one left. She was utterly alone. The day after the wedding, Verena found a message from Miranda waiting-she was asking if she could drop by and spend some time together.


Reluctantly leaving her bed, Verena freshened up and went downstairs, finding Isaac already at the breakfast table.


With a warm smile, she said, "Good morning."


Isaac looked up, a faint smile on his lips. "Why not sleep a little longer?"


The maid handed Verena a slice of toast, and she replied, "A friend's dropping by today."


"Miranda, right?" he guessed.


She gave a brief nod.


Breakfast had barely ended when Miranda appeared.


After a quick nod in Isaac's direction, she led Verena upstairs without another word.


Miranda wandered through the master bedroom,taking in every detail before giving an approving sigh. "Nice place. It's your favorite theme."


Spotting the crisp new linens on the bed, she shot Verena a playful grin and nudged her.11SO,did you have fun last night?"


With a sharp glare, Verena snapped, "Don't pretend you don't already know."


Only Miranda had been entrusted with Isaac's secret,so her teasing was all in good fun.


Laughing, Miranda held up her hands. "Okay, I'll drop it."





Meanwhile, Isaac was downstairs flipping through the business section of the newspaper. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the maid making her way toward the staircase.



"Where are you headed?" he called out.


Pausing with polite composure, the maid said, "I'm on my way to deliver a fruit platter to Mrs. Bennett and Miss Beckett." Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair over. "I'll take it. Let me bring it to them myself."


It seemed only right for him to look after his wife's guest.



Upstairs, Miranda and Verena were deep in conversation when Miranda suddenly grinned as a memory popped into her head. "Hey, what about your first boyfriend? You were so head-over-heels,always saying he was the only one who had your heart. He seemed flawless-so what went wrong?Why did it end?"



Just as Isaac lifted his hand to knock, Miranda's words from inside caught his ear.


His hand paused, hovering in the air, a surge of nerves making him hesitate.


For a moment, he worried what answer might come,even as a part of him held out hope.


He wished more than anything to hear what his heart longed for. A beat later, Verena's answer came through the door,light and teasing. "I could never forget him. I'm still crazy about him, to be honest."


Miranda burst into laughter, shaking her head."You're impossible!"


Their giggles echoed in the room, and Isaac's heart fell as he listened from the hallway.


Dropping his gaze, he turned his wheelchair from the hallway and headed into the elevator, descending to the lower floor.


After the laughter faded, Verena's tone grew earnest."If I'm being honest, my first love is lsaac. But he doesn't remember any of it now."
###Chapter 116 What Do You Want
 "What? Isaac?" Miranda's voice shot up before she quickly covered her mouth,lowering her tone. "Does Isaac even know that your very first love was him?"


Verena shook her head gently. "He doesn't know at all. His memory has gaps, and if I suddenly revealed the truth, it might weigh too heavily on him in his current state."


Drawing in a steady breath, she shrugged lightly. "It's alright. There's no rush. After all, we're married now,and I'll help him rediscover me bit by bit."


Miranda paused, and then nodded. With Isaac by Verena's side, there was time enough for memory to return.


"But tell me-can lsaac's condition actually be cured? It's not that I doubt you. Your skills are remarkable, but there are exceptions to every rule.What if he never recovers?" Verena, sensing her friend's worry, spoke with calm assurance. "Don't trouble yourself. I'm confident in his case. I've been treating him with traditional remedies and therapy-methods that restore balance from within. Once the risks are lowered, we'll move on to surgery, which will greatly raise the chances of succesS."


At the mention of surgery, Miranda's mind went back to that late-night call after Shawna's passing, when Verena had confessed her right hand trembled every time she held a scalpel.


She had recognized then that it was more than physical-it was psychological.


Looking closely at her friend, Miranda asked with concern, "If you're going to operate, can you even handle the scalpel now?"


Verena's brows drew together faintly at the question,but she forced a small smile. "I'm working through it.The trembling isn't gone completely, but it eases with each attempt. By the time the surgery comes, I'll have crossed that mental barrier." Miranda knew some wounds healed only with patience and strength from within.


"Alright then. Do what you must. I trust you." She exhaled, and then added softly, "I actually came today to tell you-I'm leaving tomorrow."


"So soon?" A hint of reluctance laced Verena's tone."Can't you stay just a few more days?"


Miranda chuckled."Oh,come on. I flew back just for your wedding. Now that it's over, mountains of work are piling up at the company."


Realizing her friend's schedule was packed, Verena relented. "Then promise me you'll take care of yourself. Don't just work endlessly-remember to rest."



Miranda, never one for long, teary farewells, slipped an arm around Verena's shoulders and teased,1"A you're already missing me, aren't you? How about knock your husband unconscious and we run off together?" Verena, used to her antics, played along with a grin.

"Don't just talk big-let's see you follow through!"


For a heartbeat, Miranda faltered, recalling Isaac's anxious expression when he came to fetch Verena on the wedding day.



"If I truly ran off with you, wouldn't your husband hunt me down?" Clicking her tongue,she shook her head. "Forget it. I value my life far too much."


Her words drew a soft laugh from Verena.


After the laughter faded, Miranda's tone grew earnest. "We walk different paths, and distance will always be between us-that's life. Don't worry about me, I'll look after myself. But as for you, don't let anyone trample on you. Hold on to that confidence you showed at the wedding. If anyone dares cross you, I'm just a call away. And if Isaac ever dares to wrong you, I'll be on the next plane, ready to give him a tongue-lashing he won't forget."



She clenched her fist to punctuate her words. To Verena, Miranda was more than a friend-she was family. Her heart warmed with gratitude.


"Thank you, Miranda," she said sincerely, a smnile breaking across her face.


Time slipped away quickly when shared with an old friend.





Glancing at her watch, Miranda sighed. "I'd better head back now."



"Stay for lunch at least?" Verena tried to keep her longer.





But Miranda picked up her handbag. "No, thanks.I have a video meeting to attend later."


"Alright," Verena conceded, "I won't hold you back if you're busy."


As they went downstairs, Miranda spotted Isaac in the living room. Verena's words about him being her first love and his amnesia echoed in her mind, stirring both pity and a quiet approval of him. She greeted him politely, "Mr. Bennett, I won't trouble you further. Until next time."


Isaac's gaze lingered briefly on Verena walking alongside Miranda, before he quickly looked away.


He inclined his head slightly toward Miranda, his voice cool and measured. "Take care, Miss Beckett."


"I'II see her out," Verena said.


Isaac merely nodded, not meeting her eyes.


Miranda had come by car, so the two women chatted beside it for a few more moments.



Inside, Isaac wheeled himself to the window,his eyes tracing Verena's silhouette in the distance.


Her smile glowed like sunlight, yet his mind echoed with her earlier words. "I could never forget him. I'm still crazy about him, to be honest."


His chest burned; bitterness gnawed at him.


Isaac had believed that man was only her past,while he was her present and future. He thought she would at least deny those feelings, especially under the roof they now shared.


But instead, she had spoken with startling candor.


Her openness felt like a knife twisting in his chest.


Isaac stared at her bright smile, his lashes quivering,his heart'ablaze with suffocating pain.


"Verena, how should I treat you?" he whispered.


When Verena returned after seeing Miranda off,she found Isaac gazing blankly out the window.


"Isaac?" she called softly.


He gave no reply.


Perplexed, she called again, "Isaac?"


Still no answer. She stepped closer, her voice laced with concern. "What are you thinking about? l've called you several times. Didn't you hear me?"


He startled from his thoughts, eyes falling instinctively on her lovely face. The words slipped out before he could stop them. "What do you want?"


Deep down, he wanted to know why Verena came close to him.What was it that she truly wanted?


"Huh?" Verena leaned nearer, confusion written in her eyes. "You're asking what I want? Why ask something like that?"


When he realized he had spoken too rashly, panic flickered across his gaze. Isaac feared she would glimpse his hidden doubt and walk away.


Forcing composure, he caught her hand, giving it a light squeeze as he shook his head. "I only meant-tell me what you like. I'm not a romantic man, but l want to give you everything I can."


Looking into his dark, unfathomable eyes, Verena broke into a smile. She leaned close to his ear,her voice soft yet teasing. "Isaac, you sly man. You say you're not romantic, but everything you do tells a different story."
###Chapter 117 Are You Avoiding Me
Silence fell as lsaac turned his head, watching her through lowered lashes. Verena could not help but study him, her gaze drifting from the sharp cut of his cheekbones to the strong line of his nose, and finally to the way his lips pressed together.


A faint shimmer danced in Verena's eyes. She savored every second at his side, warmed by the feeling that everything around them felt perfect.


Drawing in a quiet breath, she rested against his chest, tilting her head until their faces hovered dangerously close.


Right before their lips could meet, Isaac shifted abruptly, turning his face away from hers.


Caught off guard, Verena blinked; she then reached out and gently guided his chin back toward her."Isaac, are you avoiding me?" she said, her voice edged with hurt. He could not look away from the honesty in her eyes,his lips drawn into a tense line.



She was the person he cared for most,yet something inside him would not let him accept her touch so easily.



Maybe it was jealousy gnawing at him, or that sick feeling of doubt. What if, even when her lips brushed his, her mind wandered to another man?


The thought alone was enough to drive him out of his mind.



Yet every time he faced her, the words dissolved before he could voice his doubt.


A quiet fear haunted him, whispering that if he questioned her, Verena would walk away for good.


Losing her was the one thing he could not allow-not even in his worst nightmares.


In a sudden burst of impulse, lsaac caught her wrist and drew her closer, almost desperately. A gasp escaped her as she landed right in his lap, her surprise written across her face.


Without thinking, she looped her arms around his neck. "What's going on, Isaac? Talk to me," she said.


Instead of answering, lsaac held her tightly, pressing his face into her shoulder as if he could hide from the world there.


His head dipped, and Verena's fingers wandered to the ridge at the base of his neck, her touch featherlight.


Her cool fingertips brushed his skin, sparking a shiver that ran down his spine and made his whole body tense.


He drew in a shaky breath, clinging to the comfort of her familiar scent.


Reality stung-he knew deep down that her heart belonged elsewhere, and he was just a fleeting comfort.


Still, he could not bring himself to let her go or shatter the fragile illusion they shared.


For now, he would settle for this fragile closeness,pretending for a moment that he was the one she truly loved.


He could not help but scoff at how ridiculous it all was-how far he had fallen.


None of it mattered in the end.


As long as she remained with him, Isaac was willing to ignore the rest of the world.


The faint trace of her perfume sent his heart racing,every breath leaving him a little more unsteady.


Every feeling inside him screamed with the need to keep her close, to never let her slip away.


Warm breath danced across the thin fabric of her shirt, sending a wave oftingles along her skin.


Giggling, Verena gave his shoulder a soft push and said, "Isaac, stop that! You're making me squirm."


As soon as her playful tone reached him, Isaac pulled back, meeting her gaze with affection.


He breathed out her name, barely more than a rough whisper. "Verena..."


He almost never spoke her name so softly, and for a fleeting second, she wondered if he had regainedhis memory.



She found herself lost in his face, caught off guard by how striking he looked in that moment.


A gentle tremor flickered in his lashes. His dark eyes,bright and vulnerable, watched her with an intensity that left his cheeks burning and his lips parted, silent but hungry for more.


Without thinking, Verena's throat tightened as she tried to steady herself.


Something about him right then was utterly irresistible.





She saw no point in holding back now-not when everything in her urged her to close the distance. Unable to fight it any longer, she pressed forward,closing the gap between them.


But before she could reach him, lsaac claimed her mouth first.


A startled gasp slipped from her lips, but she melted into his kiss, responding with a hunger of her own.


His kisses had always been tender, but now there was a new kind of urgency in the way he moved.


There was fire behind every touch, a possessiveness that left her breathless and wanting more.


Each kiss seemed to steal the air from her lungs,the closeness almost overwhelming.


Blinking through the haze, she caught a glimpse of his flushed cheeks and trembling lashes.


Noticing her sudden pause, lsaac tugged gently at her lower lip with his teeth, teasing her before pulling away just enough to leave her wanting.


A rush of warmth pulsed through Verena as her grip tightened around his shoulders, the fire of his touch burning right through the thin fabric.


Lost in one another, their lips met again and again,neither willing to let the moment slip away.


A sudden shift in Isaac's crotch made her pause,her breath catching mid-kiss.


A jolt of realization brought a playful thrill, and she drew back, breathless, whispering, "Wait, Isaac-hold on."


Before she could move further, Isaac shot her a defiant look and leaned in, murmuring, "Don't make me stop now.I want more."


He trailed urgent kisses along her jaw,coaxing her head back and drawing a shiver from her spine.


Every protest faded beneath his fierce kiss, and she surrendered, letting him take the lead. She decided to tell him what she found after the kiss.


Yet, there was no sign of restraint in him; lsaac's hunger only seemed to grow. Her hands pressed against his shoulders with more force, and she broke free just long enough to gasp."Isaac, seriously. Give me a second,will you?"


Her tone was thick with desire, but her plea landed sharp between them.


Rejection left lsaac's mind racing, confusion and longing flashing through his eyes.


Why pull back now, after everything?


She claimed she cared for him-so why the hesitation?





How could her lips and her heart speak so differently?


Why promise him closeness, only to retreat?


In that instant, his mind could only fixate on her rejection; he completely forgot all the times Verena had taken the initiative and they had kissed passionately.


Jealousy flared as he tipped her chin up, his voice rough and certain. "You're not getting away from me,Verena. Not now, not ever."


The words had barely faded before he captured her lips in a desperate,heated kiss.


Limbs entwined, clothes rumpled, they tumbled deeper into each other.


Halfway through, Isaac stilled, his eyes falling to the mark just beneath her collarbone.



There, inked boldly on her skin, the black letter "l"seemed to mock him-a sign that someone else still lingered in her story.


A sharp ache flickered in his chest. Driven by a wild,jealous need, he gripped her shoulders and rained frantic kisses over the mark and the skin around it.


She drew in a quick breath, wincing, as she threaded her fingers through his hair. "Easy, Isaac. You're going to leave a mark."


Every ounce of control gone, he pressed his lips around the mark, leaving flushed,red trails blooming across her neck.



Annoyance flickered in Verena's eyes as her fingers threaded through his hair, desire coloring her cheeks.
###Chapter 118 Your Body Is Responding




Fortunately, Verena's mind stayed clear, like a candle that refuses to flicker in the wind, able to tell what mattered and what did not.


She clenched her teeth, summoned her strength,and pushed Isaac away once more. Afraid he might try again, she quickly blurted, "Isaac, listen to me.I need to examine your body."


Isaac, dismissive and suspicious, believed she was merely looking for an excuse to spurn his closeness.


Breathing heavily, his voice carried a note of displeasure. "Is this really the moment for a checkup?"


Even as he spoke, he leaned forward again, eager to continue.


Verena, quick on her feet, covered his mouth and sighed, "Don't you see? Your body is responding." Isaac froze, caught off guard. His thoughts stalled,and he looked at her in bafflement.



Seizing that pause, Verena slipped from his grip,rose from his lap, and crouched beside him.


Lifting his shirt, she revealed his lean abdomen and pressed her fingertips against a few pressure points.


As her hands moved, her eyes shifted toward his crotch.



Within moments, the swelling that had been there subsided.



Verena didn't feel let down; instead, her lips curled into a bright grin.


Though brief, that flicker of change was like a light at the end of a long tunnel.


Looking up at Isaac with joy, she declared, "This is wonderful! It proves my revised treatment plan is working. It's a good sign. Stay here a moment-I'll fetch the medicine and apply it again." With that, Verena dashed upstairs, her steps almost dancing.


Isaac sat there, dazed, watching her cheerful figure vanish from sight.


He lowered his gaze, staring at his abdomen, eyes filled with confusion and disbelief.



Had he really responded?


Was it not a trick of his imagination?


Could there truly be hope of recovery-of becoming whole again?






Since that small but telling reaction, Verena devoted herself even more to refining her formulas, working tirelessly to craft a stronger ointment.


Isaac had even arranged a medical room for her within their home.


One day, as usual, Verena locked herself inside,weighing herbs, mixing medicines, and poring over her notes when Rhonda knocked, announcing that Danica had arrived.


Verena froze for a heartbeat.


Isaac's mother?


They had crossed paths only occasionally, and always with others around.


The last time they met alone, the subject had been Isaac.


Why was Danica here now, and by herself?


Verena's brows knitted with faint doubt, and she told Rhonda, "I understand. I'll come down shortly."


After the maid left, Verena went to the bedroom,slipped out of her loungewear, changed into something more formal, and descended the stairs.


As soon as Danica saw her, she quickly put down her coffee.


With a warm smile, she beckoned, saying, "Verena,come over here!" Verena was slightly taken aback by the familiar tone,yet her face betrayed nothing.


Smiling politely, she approached and greeted, "Good day,Danica."


Danica's smile deepened, fine lines showing at the corners of her eyes. "Good day,my dear."


She drew Verena down beside her on the sofa,and then reached into her handbag and produced a red velvet box.



"Verena, I want you to keep this." Danica opened it,revealing a jade bracelet.


"What is..."


Danica gently slipped it onto Verena's wrist as she explained, "This piece has been passed down through three generations. Take it as a blessing from me, as your mother-in-law."


Verena gazed at the lustrous jade. Though she knew little about jewelry, the quality spoke for itself-it was no ordinary piece. Understanding the meaning behind the gesture,she did not refuse. With a warm smile, she said, "Thank you,Danica.It's truly beautiful."


Then, recalling something, she added, "By the way,Isaac isn't home. Shall I call him back?"


Seeing her poised and graceful manner, Danica felt a quiet relief.


She shook her head and smiled faintly. "No need.I came especially for you."


Verena maintained her composure, her tone gentle."Is there anything you want to discuss with me?"


Danica cleared her throat, her gaze carrying a touch of apology. "Verena, I wronged you before.When we first met, you mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University.I assumed you were lying and, if it weren't for the challenges lsaac and the Bennett family were facing, I'd have opposed the marriage. Only now do l realize I misjudged you. I owe you an apology."


Verena blinked in mild surprise, and then smiled softly. "Danica, there's no need. My mother's words created that misunderstanding. Before the truth surfaced, you were only looking out for lsaac. As a mother,you acted out of duty."


Her words were frank yet generous, the kind of response not everyone could manage.


Danica's fondness for her grew deeper.


When she learned Verena had cured Barrie's leg, she had been stunned. Once the truth was confirmed,shame replaced her prejudice, and gratitude filled her heart that Isaac had married Verena.


If only Verena could restore Isaac as well.


Danica placed her hand gently over Verena's."Verena, I know you healed Barrie. You're truly remarkable."


Her voice trembled, emotion catching in her throat."All I ask is that you try to heal lsaac's legs. You can't imagine how much he has endured. When the accident happened, his father died beside him. He spent a month in a hospital bed, and when he finally awoke, he had lost both his father and the use of his legs. From that moment, he changed-withdrawn,silent, shutting himself in his room day after day. And I, in my grief, selfishly blamed him for his father's death. The weight he carried was unbearable. But since you came into his life, he's softened. He no longer hides away; his gaze has light again. He's becoming more like the boy he once was."


By then, tears streamed freely down Danica's face.


Her words painted a picture of lsaac's suffering during the months Verena had not been by his side.


Sorrow welled in Verena's eyes. She clasped Danica's hand and said earnestly, "Isaac is my husband. Even without your request, I would give my all to heal him. Don't burden yourself with guilt. Every heart falters under grief. It is only human to break.I believe Isaac will understand you."


Danica wept until her nose flushed red. Through her tears, she asked in disbelief, "Truly? He won't hold it against me?" Sensing her low spirits, Verena shifted the topic gently. "Danica, I have good news. Isaac's sex function has already shown signs of progress."


Though embarrassed to discuss such matters with her mother-in-law, she chose honesty.


"From the beginning, I realized his problem wasn't just physical but deeply psychological. In the following treatments, I incorporated certain stimulating medicines."


Her fingers brushed her cheek, and her voice dropped slightly. "Yesterday, when we were close, l noticed a reaction. It was fleeting, but it proves the treatment is working."


When her words faded, silence lingered in the room.


Moments later, Danica gripped Verena's shoulders,eyes alight. "Really? Verena, is that true? Has Isaac truly improved?"


Her excitement tumbled out in repeated questions,while Verena smiled and nodded. "Absolutely. I wouldn't deceive you about something so important."


Danica's joy overflowed. When she first arrived, she carried only the faintest glimmer of hope, knowing countless renowned doctors had declared Isaac's chances slim.



Yet now, Verena had given her a gift more precious than anything she could have dreamed.
###Chapter 119 Kaia Was Missing





Excitement danced across Danica's features as she processed the good news. Then, she remembered the uproar Kaia had caused at the wedding, trying to set her own sister up.


Most people that day had seen only the surface, but Danica saw through the act, reading the tension with practiced eyes.


Someone who could plot against her own flesh and blood probably never showed her older sister any kindness to begin with.


It was hard to miss the hands-off approach of the Willis parents-rules bent and broken, and no one seemed to care.


What truly stood out was how Verena stayed cool under pressure, shutting down every accusation with calm and skill, like she'd faced this kind of drama before. When Danica decided to form an alliance with the Willis family through marriage, Kaia had been the only name she heard. It was only after chatting with Laura and Alec that she discovered there was an older daughter, one who'd spent years out of sight,raised in the countryside.


That was the moment Danica understood: the Willises weren't telling her everything.


She could still picture Laura's eager smile as she finally brought Verena forward, like showing off something for sales.


It all clicked now-back then, Danica hadn't questioned why the Willis family brought Verena into the picture. But the truth was obvious: the Willises refused to risk Kaia's future and instead offered up the daughter they'd always neglected, just to k<eep their end of the deal.


These thoughts pushed Danica to squeeze Verena's hand, her voice low with regret and new respect."Verena, I mean this-I can't thank you enough for helping Isaac. I misjudged you. You knew what you were signing up for and still said yes. That wasn't fair to you. I'm sorry for all of it. From now on, I promise you have my support. If your family ever makes things hard for you, you come to me. I'll have your back, no matter what."


It was the least Danica could offer, a small step toward making things right.


Whatever else happened, the fact that Verena had given her son hope for a real future would always matter most.


Verena answered with a gentle smile, her voice steady, "You don't need to worry about me, really.I chose this path for myself. Being with Isaac was my decision; no one forced me."


Her words floated out softly, but there was no doubt in the strength behind them.


A wave of relief washed over Danica, who could only look at Verena in wonder.



For the first time, Danica was certain she'd made the right call forming a marriage alliance with the Willis family.


They spoke a little longer, but soon Danica glanced at the time, knowing she had to go.


Without protest, Verena walked her to the door,quietly seeing her out.


Hardly a moment after Danica disappeared, the sound of Isaac's car pulling up echoed through the drive.


Jacob gave lsaac a hand into his wheelchair, and then lsaac moved across the walkway until he was right beside Verena.


"Did my mom just leave?" Isaac asked, watching her with curiosity.


He'd caught a glimpse of Danica's favorite car rolling out of the estate.



It was obvious to Verena that Danica timed her exit so lsaac would not catch even a hint of their talk about his condition. Verena gave a little nod. "She just stopped by for a quick chat, that's all."


There was no reason to add more worries to lsaac's condition, so Verena left out every detail about Danica's questions.


A note of unease slipped into lsaac's voice. "She didn't put you through the wringer, did she?"


For a second, Verena wondered just how intimidating Danica must appear from Isaac's perspective.


As she guided his wheelchair into the living room,she flashed him a reassuring smile. "You're stressing for nothing. It was just regular small talk."


Isaac's eyebrows knitted together."Are you sure?You'd tell me if she was giving you trouble, right?"


She let out a quiet sigh, and then knelt down to look him in the eye.


"Isaac, do you really want to see a rift between me and your mom?" She lifted her wrist so he could see the gleaming jade. "See this? Your mother just gave me her prized bracelet as a welcome."



His eyes dropped to the smooth, green stone resting against her skin, and for a heartbeat, he went quiet.


That piece of jade wasn't just jewelry. It carried the weight of family tradition-every daughter-in-law received it as a mark of acceptance. Danica guarded it like it was priceless.


A warmth softened lsaac's gaze as he took in the sight of that bracelet on Verena's wrist.



...



One week had slipped by since V/erena walked down the aisle. Kaia had vanished just as long-no one had seen her since the wedding.



Kaia had stormed out that night and simply never bothered to come home.



The night Kaia disappeared, Alec was too furious to chase after her. Laura and Luka shrugged it off,convinced she was just crashing at a friend's place. But after seven days had passed, Laura came home from the office, and Luka dropped his bag after school, only to find the house just as empty-Kaia's room looked untouched, not a trace of her anywhere.
A worried frown creased Laura's brow. "Where is she? How long does she plan to stay away?"
Luka's shoulders slumped. "Maybe she's still mad and hiding out at a friend's place."
Laura's voice grew sharp. "She should at least pick up the phone. It's not right to disappear for days."
Because of Kaia's drama, several business partners were already backing out, all of them tossing out words like "integrity" and "reputation" as an excuse.
Lately, Laura found herself buried in work at the office, while Alec was so swamped that he hardly made it home before midnight.
With chaos at the company piling up, Kaia's absence seemed less like a coincidence and more like a perfectly timed escape. Laura's patience snapped as she said to Luka, "You know most of the people Kaia runs with. Start dialing and figure out where she is. Tell her she needs to show up here by tomorrow morning-and I don't want her wandering anywhere else until I let her."


"Got it."


He scrolled through Kaia's contact list, exhaling slowly as he made the first call.


"Hey, Marianna? Luka here. Has Kaia been crashing at your place?"


A voice crackled through. "Nope. I'm not even in the country-I'm out on vacation."


Luka ended the call, and then tried the next number,barely pausing between dials.


"Hi, Saniya. It's Luka. Did Kaia come to see you a week ago?"


"A week ago? Wasn't that when the thunderstorm hit? Why would she show up in that mess?" Luka pressed, "Any idea who she's been hanging around with lately?"


"No clue.Sorry."


"Alright. Thanks anyway," Luka replied, voice tight,before moving on.


One call after another, he.found himself getting nowhere. Most of Kaia's so-called friends were just party buddies; beyond club nights and group chats,they didn't seem to care about her whereabouts.


Still, Luka refused to quit, running through the last few contacts in her list.


He finally reached the last one. "Hey, Mckenzie, it's Luka-Kaia's brother. Have you heard from her at all?"



"No,nothing."


Just as he was about to say thanks and hang up,Mckenzie's voice turned sly. "By the way, I heard Kaia stirred up trouble at Verena's wedding. Seriously, she sabotaged her own sister? That's messed up." Luka gripped his phone tighter, refusing to let his anger show. "I'm being respectful here, so keep the gossip to yourself."


Mckenzie just chuckled, not backing down. "Relax,I'm not trying to start anything. But if Kaia's missing,maybe think about who she's pissed off lately.Who knows, maybe someone snatched her."


A cold spike of fear shot through Luka at the word "snatched."


"Thanks for your time," he said, and then cut the call short.



When he put the phone down and didn't dial another number, Laura walked over, eyes full of worry. "Did you find her? What did everyone say?"


Luka's hands trembled. "She's gone, Mom. I think Kaia's really missing."


Laura's face went pale as a sheet. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 120 You've Chosen The Wrong Person
Just then, Alec returned from the company.


Catching sight of Luka with Laura, he frowned and asked, "What are you two doing here?"


Laura, flustered, quickly explained, "Alec, Kaia is missing. It's been a week now, and she hasn't come home. I asked Luka to call her friends, hoping she might be staying with one of them, but no one has seen her. Alec, where could Kaia have gone? Do you think something has happened to her?"


A shadow of worry crossed Alec's eyes. It was the first time Kaia had run away, and never had she vanished for so long.


Yet, what weighed heavier on him than her disappearance was the Bennett family/'s silence.


A week had passed since Verena and Isaac's wedding. Despite the uproar Kaia had stirred, the Bennett family had shown no reaction.


The club was still under restrictions, but there was no hard crackdown either, leaving Alec unable to read Isaac's stance.



The ambiguity gnawed at him like a riddle with no answer.





The more he thought, the more restless he became.


With a deep frown, he waved his hand. "She can go wherever she pleases. She stormed off in anger;if trouble finds her, she brought it on herself."


With that, Alec strode upstairs.


Tears welled in Laura's eyes as she turned to Luka."What should we do? It seems your father has washed his hands of Kaia."


Luka swallowed, the last phone call echoing in his ears-someone might've snatched Kaia. Verena's image flashed unbidden in his mind.  He gritted his teeth and patted Laura's hand gently "Mom, don't worry. I'll search for her tomorrow. I'll bring Kaia back,I promise."



The next morning, lsaac had already gone tothe company. Verena was taking her breakfast at the dining table.


Soon after, Rhonda came forward to announce, "Mrs.Bennett, your brother is here."


Luka?



Verena paused mid-bite. "Send him in."


Moments later, Rhonda ushered Luka inside.


Verena stayed seated, giving him a calm glance.

"Would you like something to eat?"


Facing his eldest sister, with whom he shared little closeness, Luka shifted uneasily.


He shook his head. "I've already eaten."


Verena only nodded, having asked out of courtesy.  She gestured at the seat across from her. "Sit."


Luka obeyed, lowering his head, nervously tugging at the edge of his shirt, yet saying nothing.


Verena, unhurried, continued her meal. Only when she had nearly finished did she ask, "Well then,speak. You came this early-what is it?"


Though suspicion lingered in his heart, Luka knew he had to take small steps.


"Kaia has been missing for a week. We haven't found her, and Mom is so worried she can't sleep. Verena,you have wider connections. Could you heIp us look for her?"



Verena gave a sudden, mocking laugh.


When all was well, Luka barely gave her a glance.Now that Kaia had vanished, he had come bowing his head,asking politely for help.


What irony.


Startled by her scoff, Luka looked up. Verena leaned  back in her chair, arms folded.


"Are you sure you've come to the right person?"


Her domineering stance stirred Luka's irritation.Kaia was her sister by blood, yet with Kaia missing,Verena appeared cold as stone.


He frowned. "What do you mean by that?"


Verena lifted a shoulder carelessly. "Isn't it obvious?Whether Kaia lives or dies, what does that have to do with me? If you're here for my help, let me be plain-you've chosen the wrong person."


Luka's fists clenched, his eyes full of reproach.


He had hoped that by softening his tone, she might show a shred of compassion. He hadn't expected such a heartless reply.



"You really are cold. Even a stranger would show more concern for another's life than you do for your own sister..."


Verena cut him off sharply. "Shall I list what Kaia has done to me? She smeared my reputation in our circle,making me out to be worthless. She tried to ruin my wedding before all eyes, determined to crush me. Do you know what would have happened to me if the truth hadn't come to light?"


Luka froze, lips opening and closing without sound.


Verena went on, unflinching. "She schemed against me, hoping I'd fall. And now you ask me to look for her? She never wanted me to have peace, so why should I wish her any?"


Seeing how resolute she was, Luka tried to shield Kaia with words. "Kaia only went astray, making things hard for you in a moment of confusion. But wasn't it because you gave her a hard time when you first came to Willis Villa? It was unfair to her...



Clang!


Verena slammed her utensils onto the table, the sound jolting Luka in place.


"Who made life hard for whom first? Who provoked  whom first?" Her gaze was cold as ice. "In front of you all, she plays the doting sister. In front of me, she goads and plots. In your eyes, Kaia is the gentle sister, and I'm nothing but a stranger carrying the title of eldest. But in my eyes-before you tried to trip me at the staircase, you were my only brother. Before Kaia turned against me, she was my only sister. Now,to me, you both are nothing."



Her words lodged in Luka's throat like a stone. He looked at her, his eyes stung by the absence of warmth in hers.



"Have you thought only of Kaia's unfairness? What about mine?"


Verena gave a bitter smile. "You both grew up with every privilege-fine schools, a life cushioned in our parents' love. All I had was Grandma to lean on. For a single word from Kaia, you attacked me without knowing the truth. Did you ever stop to consider my feelings? Since neither of you ever cared for mine,why should I care for yours?"  Luka froze, shaken, his thoughts in turmoil.


He had never truly reflected on her words before.


Memories stirred-memories of distance, of never questioning why he and Verena had remained strangers despite sharing the same blood.


Yes, they had the same parents, yet their liveshad been worlds apart.


He and Kaia enjoyed every luxury, while Verena had grown up in the countryside.


Each time their father suggested bringing Verena and Grandma to Shoildon, their mother would grow furious, raising storms until the idea was abandoned.


Only now did Luka see the unfairness clearly.


Guilt swept over him as he mnuttered, eyes clouded,"I'm sorry."


But apologies that come too late heal nothing.


Verena's reply was as cold as steel. "I don't accept it." Luka pressed his lips tight, wanting to argue further.


After a long silence, he finally asked, "Does Kaia's disappearance have anything to do with you?"
###Chapter 121 You're Evelyn





"Do you think I arranged something to happen to her?" Verena asked, her brows knitting slightly.


Luka dropped his gaze, cheeks reddening with shame. He didn't need to say a word-his silence gave him away.


A soft laugh slipped from Verena. "How ridiculous.With everything l've worked for and the future waiting for me, why would I risk it all on someone so worthless?"



Her eyes cut towvard him with icy disdain before she turned her head aside. "I won't stoop to anything illegal. That's not who l am."


Only then did Luka understand-Kaia's disappearance had nothing to do with Verena.


He rose slowly, giving her a stiff nod. "Then I won't take up any more of your time." His steps were heavy as he left, unease weighing him down. If Verena wasn't behind it,then what had really happened to Kaia?



···


Far away, in a villa in Shoildon, Kaia sat curled tightly on a bed far too large for her small frame. Her bloodshot eyes were hollow and unsettling.


"You're still refusing to eat?"


Katelyn Fuller walked closer, her voice carrying a chill. Kaia didn't even bother to lift her head."Whether I eat or not has nothing to do with you."


Katelyn didn't so much as flinch at Kaia's defiance.


Her crimson lips curved into a smile as she leaned closer, whispering near Kaia's ear, "You still don't get it, do you? Starving yourself, sulking in the dark,feeding your anger-it's the weakest path you could take. If you really want revenge, you have to stay alive, sharpen your mind, and turn rage into strategy.Build plans so flawless they cut your enemies down <###Chapter 121 You're Evelyn                                   110281-1010227
in one strike. That's how you win."
She straightened, picked up a bowl of porridge from the bedside table, and held it out. "Eat."
Kaia's glare hardened. She slapped the hand away,her voice like ice. "I don't need your kindness. Don't think I can't see through you."
The porridge splattered slightly, lukewarm and sticky against Katelyn's skin, leaving a faint mess.
Unbothered, she set the bowl aside, calmly wiping her fingers with a tissue. "Oh? Then why don't you explain what you think I'm after?" she asked with a slow, deliberate ease.
Kaia scoffed, "You're not fooling mne. You're trying to use me as your pawn against Verena-just another step to get close to lsaac. Do you really take me for an idiot?"
Everyone in Shoildon already whispered about Katelyn's obsession with Isaac.
Kaia, having grown up in the city, was well aware of it. Katelyn folded her arms, her smile twisting into something sharper as she looked down at Kaia."Smart lady."


It was praise in words only-the scorn behind it was clear as glass.



"I know you're laughing at me for being foolish. Fine,I'll admit it-I'm not clever," Kaia admitted,her lips twitching with stubborn defiance. "But after losing to Verena again and again, do you really think I'd be dumb enough to challenge her outright? She's got Isaac behind her now, and even the CEO of AuroraNexus in her corner. You don't cross people like that. I won't, and neither will you. Otherwise,why bother with me at all instead of striking at her yourself?"



Katelyn didn't flinch at the accusation. Calm and composed, she shook her head. "You're half right.I do intend to use you against Verena, but not because I fear her. I can't afford to let lsaac suspect I'm moving against her. Do you want to know why you've lost to her every time?" Kaia clenched her jaw, saying nothing. With a smirk,Katelyn added, "Because your tricks were sloppy.Every scheme y/ou tried was transparent, easy for Verena to dismantle. If you'd taken the time to plan properly, you wouldn't have fallen so hard."


Kaia's tone stayed flat. "Maybe so. But it doesn't change the fact that I'm finished. I'm no match for her, and I'll never bring her down."


Leaning closer, Katelyn's eyes gleamed. "So you'll just accept defeat? If you work with me, I'll give you resources, guidance, everything you need. I'll make sure Verena never forces you to bow your head again."


The conviction in Katelyn's words carried weight, and against her will, Kaia felt a spark of temptation. She hated her failures, hated Verena even more.Yet even with the offer dangling before her, doubt still gnawed at her-because facing Verena again seemed impossible.


Kaia's eyes narrowed on Katelyn, suspicion and hesitation warring inside her. At last, her defenses slipped, and she asked quietly, "What exactly can you give me?"


The question told Katelyn all she needed to know-Kaia was wavering.


She slid onto the bed beside her, closing the gap,her voice dropping to a coaxing murmur. "You've always idolized Evelyn, haven't you? The miracle doctor everyone praises, admired at home and abroad."


The name alone sent a spark through Kaia's dull gaze, her hopelessness cracking into sudden light.


Not missing a beat, Katelyn leaned in, feeding that spark.



"But being her fan isn't enough. You should stand at her side as her apprentice. Learn everything she knows. Become greater than her. Then crush Verena in her own field. Strip away her glory. And when the time comes, I'll help you topple her support from Isaac and the AuroraNexus CEO."



Every word rolled off Katelyn's tongue like a spell, weaving possibility into Kaia's ears.


For the first time in ages, Kaia felt her pulse quicken with something close to hope, as if Evelyn might walk into the room any second.


The despair weighing her down gave way to burning desire. She wanted more than survival now-she wanted to rise as the most renowned doctor alive,praised by the elite. She wanted the Bennett family to choke on their arrogance, Alec and Laura to drown in regret, and Verena-oh, especially Verena-to kneel before her and beg for mercy in front of the world.


The thought consumed Kaia until she could no longer hold back. She seized Katelyn's arm, her voice trembling with excitement. "You can really take me to Evelyn? You can truly make that happen?"


Katelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.′′Of course. I don't make promises I can't keep."


Even so, Kaia tried to rein in her eagerness, forcing a sliver of doubt into her tone. "But why should I believe you? You claim to know Evelyn-but do you?Don't think you can trick me. Our professor has met Evelyn, so l'd know if you were lying."


Katelyn tilted her head, a soft "Oh?" escaping her,her voice touched with curiosity. "And which professor would that be?"


"Professor Wendell Branson," Kaia answered firmly.


At the name, Katelyn's gaze dropped for a brief moment, the corner of her mouth twitching as she etched it into memory. Wendel Branson. Good.


Now she knew exactly who had contact with Evelyn.Mixing fact with fabrication was her art, and a mere professor was hardly an obstacle she couldn't bend to her advantage.


Lifting her eyes again, Katelyn's voice rang with confidence. "I'd never stoop to lying to you, Kaia. Not about this."



Kaia, seeing no flicker of dishonesty in Katelyn's face, pushed further. "Really? Then tell me-where is Evelyn now?"


Katelyn's lips curved as her eyes narrowed, a sly gleam flashing before she answered, "Right in front of you."


The words jolted Kaia. She stared at Katelyn in disbelief, her voice rising. "You're saying you're Evelyn? Don't be ridiculous. Evelyn's a man!"


Unshaken, Katelyn held her gaze, her smile calm and unnervingly confident. "And what makes you so certain? Who ever told you Evelyn was male? Have you seen a single report confirmingit?"


Kaia faltered. In truth, she hadn't. There had never been a clear account of Evelyn's identity-only vague descriptions. Her own admiration had led her to imagine Evelyn as some refined, scholarly man.


"Kaia," Katelyn called out smoothly, leaning in as if sealing the claim. "Believe me. I am Evelyn. The world calls Evelyn a legendary phy/sician for good reason. Some say I live in seclusion, others whisper about mystery-but none of that erases the fact that I've healed countless patients and built a reputation recognized everywhere. Why would I risk telling a lie so easy to expose?"
###Chapter 122 Public Opinion Effect





Katelyn's calm certainty left Kaia little room to doubt.A woman as cunning as her would never risk a lie that could be shattered so easily-if she wasn't truly Evelyn, the real one would step forward to expose the fraud.



The figure Kaia had idolized for years now stood before her, and the awe inside her chest swelled until it drowned everything else. She couldn't say if anyone alive could defeat Verena, but if Evelyn was involved,Kaia believed it was possible.


Her gaze softened into adoration as she clutched Katelyn's hand, her voice trembling with devotion."You're really Evelyn? I can't believe I'm meeting you -after all these years, and we've even crossed paths before without me knowing. This is incredible!"


"In this country, just call me Katelyn," Katelyn replied,her smile perfectly composed, though her eyes betrayed nothing. "We'll have plenty of time together, so there's no need for such excitement."


Hearing that, Kaia's joy overflowed. She nodded over and over, grinning wide. "Of course, of course. I get it -you don't want to attract attention. But tell me,when do we strike back at Verena?"


Katelyn's voice flowed like silk, smooth and unhurried. "Not yet. First, you need to regain your strength. When the time is right and the plan is ready, I'll let you know."


Still sniffling from the cold she'd caught in the storm,Kaia lowered her head and whispered, "Alright."


The thought of the reason behind Katelyn targeting Verena still gnawed at Kaia, and confusion spilled into her words."Katelyn, I don't get it. Isaac isn't who he used to be. Even with his money and power,he's a broken man now. Why would someone as extraordinary as you still want him? Honestly, he doesn't deserve you."


Her protest was fueled partly by admiration for her idol and partly by the resentment she carried for Isaac's constant defense of Verena.


She added, her tone sharper, "And his legs-they're ruined. Everyone knows he'll never walk properly again."


Katelyn rose to her feet, her confidence radiating."With me by his side, do you really believe Isaac can't recover?"


Her gaze slid past Kaia and out the window,her voice low and resolute, as if she were speaking more to fate than to anyone in the room. "Isaac will be mine.And Verena-she won't escape me. I'll drag her down with my own hands. This isn't only about helping you.I despise her for taking what's mine, for wearing the title of his wife."


A cold smile curved Katelyn's lips. "One day,Verena will understand that the role of Isaac's wife belongs to me-and me alone."


After lingering long enough to let her words settle,Katelyn urged Kaia to rest, and then swept out of the  room.


The butler, waiting just outside, leaned in close and murmured, "Miss Fuller, the guest has arrived. He's waiting in the study."


Without breaking stride, Katelyn gave a single nod,her eyes fixed forward. "Keep watch on the woman inside.I want every move reported back to me."


The butler bowed his head respectfully. "Yes, Miss Fuller."


Katelyn walked steadily down the hall until she reached the study door.


Pushing it open, she stepped inside and greeted the man on the sofa. "Mr. Baldwin, forgive the delay.I hope you haven't been waiting long."


Foley Baldwin, the most powerful voice in Shoildon's news world, immediately rose to his feet. "Not at all.I only just got here myself."


"Please, sit," Katelyn said before lowering herself onto the sofa opposite him. They faced each other across the polished table, and Katelyn laced her fingers together on her lap. Her voice was smooth, deliberate. "Mr. Baldwin, I'm sure my butler has already filled you in on the basics.People like us don't waste time dancing around. The fact that you're here tells me you're ready to do business."


The other day, following Katelyn's instructions, her butler had lured Foley out, drowned him in liquor, and set two heavy lockboxes before him.


By morning, when he woke, the sight had been enough to stun him-neat stacks of cash piled high,far beyond what a man in his position could ever earn in years of honest work.


The butler had whispered at the dinner meeting that this was only the down payment, with far more to come once the job was finished.


The temptation was too much to resist. And after all,Katelyn's request wasn't outlandish-half the news in entertainment was embellished anyway. Not long after, Foley had picked up his phone and asked the butler for the meeting time, greed outweighing hesitation.


Now, recalling the gleam of those banknotes, he grinned broadly. "Miss Fuller, your generosity speaks louder than words. How could I possibly disappoint you?"


Foley leaned forward eagerly. "Just say the word,Miss Fuller. Whatever you require, I'll see to it."


Katelyn's smile was cool and calculated. "My request is simple. Push the stories of my successes abroad.Dress them up with a little mystery-use phrases like 'an enigmatic figure' or 'a hidden talent.' Don't reveal too much. The goal is to nudge the narrative toward Evelyn without ever confirming it. Keep the language vague, leave the speculation hanging. The rest is your craft, not mine."



After laying out her instructions, she checked the time on her watch, her expression softening into a polite smile. "You'll have to excuse me now-my trainer is due any minute." Taking the hint, Foley rose to his feet, bowing his head slightly. "Ah, yes, I just remembered I have pressing matters waiting at the office. Consider it done, Miss Fuller. You'll have no complaints from me."



Her eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of mock confusion sharpening her gaze, the unspoken warning clear.


Catching it instantly, Foley straightened with a nervous chuckle. "Of course. For the record, I've spent the entire day at home, handling business privately. No visitors, no conversations. You can count on my discretion."


Only then did Katelyn's smile return, her voice smooth. "Good. Safe travels, Mr.Baldwin."






Money greased every wheel, and Katelyn's money in particular worked like oil on fire. Foley wasted no time. By the very next morning, headlines blazed across Shoildon's media outlets, Katelyn's name stamped everywhere and whispered in elite circles.


The banner story read: "Katelyn Fuller Returns with Stellar Credentials! Enigmatic Background Stirs Curiosity among High Society."


Once the article went live, Foley wasted no time. As Katelyn instructed, he unleashed a wave of paid influencers to flood the comment sections and steer the conversation.


The first voice popped up. "Wait a second-wasn't Katelyn living in Clokron all this time? She's really back?"


Another quickly followed, commenting, "Didn't she study medicine? I've heard rumors she comes and goes like a ghost-totally mysterious."


A third comment read, "Oneof my friends swears she went to the same school as Katelyn. They say she might have a second identity... though nobody knows for sure." Then came a fourth comment. "Word is, she once cured a patient that even top professors couldn't save. The guy walked away completely healed under her care!"



The chatter spread, and soon the city's wealthy began adding their own speculation to the mix.


In Shoildon's upper circles, the gossip spread like wildfire.


"We all knew she came from a family of doctors and was a top student," one socialite remarked. "But if she's handling cases beyond even professors,maybe she's returned for a particular patient?"


Another leaned in, curiosity piqued, "That could be it.But who would have the power to bring her back?"


Someone gestured toward the earlier thread and muttered, "And what about that rumor of a hidden identity? Could it actually be true?"


"An internationally recognized doctor, famous for solving impossible cases... doesn't that sound exactly like the elusive surgeon, Evelyn?"


"No way-that's what the article was hinting at too!"


"Come on, rumors don't just appear out of nowhere.Even entertainment reporters wouldn't dare print that without a shred of truth."


Speculation grew wilder, some debating the real reason behind Katelyn's return and whispering about her supposed secret identity, while others dredged up stories from her school days.


"Remember how obsessed she was with lsaac back in high school?"


"Of course! That's when I realized chasing a man isn't as easy as everyone claims."


"She was so relentless, every woman in school avoided even looking at Isaac, terrified Katelyn would 'welcome' them with a not-so-friendly warning."


Meanwhile, Katelyn sat with her phone in hand,scrolling through the comments. A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips. The narrative had taken root exactly the way she wanted-public opinion was shifting, and the stage was set for her next move.


Without glancing up, she called toward the doorway,instructing, "Prepare the car. I'm heading out."
###Chapter 123 For Isaac





At the Bennett Mansion, Danica raised her brows in mild surprise when a servant announced Katelyn's visit.



The Bennett family had always maintained close ties with the Fuller family, and Danica had practically watched the lady grow up. She remembered clearly how boldly Katelyn had chased after lsaac.


That Katelyn had only just returned from overseas yet chosen to come here first spoke volumes-her thoughts were still firmly fixed on Isaac.


After a brief pause, Danica gave a small nod. "Show her in."


A short while later, she watched as Katelyn swept into the living room with a dazzling smile, her hands carrying tastefully wrapped gift boxes.


Before leaving the country, Katelyn had trailed Isaac constantly, like a shadow glued to his side. Now, on her return, lsaac had lost his ability to walk and was bound in marriage. Still, she appeared unchanged-radiant, sweet, and brimming with youthful charm that recalled those earlier days.


The sight stirred something in Danica, a wistful ache.If not for that accident, perhaps Isaac and Katelyn might have truly ended up together. She had always admired Katelyn, but Isaac's heart had been as cold and distant as a mountain of ice, impossible for anyone to thaw.


"Mrs. Bennett! It's been far too long-I've missed you dearly!" Katelyn chimed brightly, slipping into Danica's arms with the ease of family.


Though years had passed, her warmth was genuine enough to soften Danica, who patted her gently on the back. "Katelyn, you've grown lovelier during your time abroad. Surely you have a trail of admirers chasing after you now?"


Katelyn pressed her hands to her cheeks with a shy laugh. "Mrs. Bennett, I've only just come back and you're already teasing me."


She motioned toward the neatly stacked boxes on the table. "I brought a few things for you-please take a look and see if they suit your taste."


Danica's eyes landed on one package, her brows lifting when she recognized the insignia of a rare luxury brand few could get their hands on.


With a light tap on Katelyn's shoulder, she said with a smile, "Thank you, dear. You're too polite; your visit alone is more than enough."


Katelyn stuck her tongue out playfully. "It's nothing,just a little token of my respect for you."


This wasn't her first time in the Bennett household.With practiced ease, she signaled a maid. "Dorcie,would you mind taking these upstairs?"


Dorcie Wright bowed her head respectfully before carrying the gifts away.


Danica then led Katelyn to the sofa, pouring a steaming cup of coffee before handing it over. "So tell me, how long will you be staying in the country this time?"


Accepting the cup with a sweet smile, Katelyn shook her head, her expression tinged with hesitation. "To be honest, I don't know yet."


Danica's brows drew together. "What do you mean by that?"


Placing the cup back on the table, Katelyn met her gaze squarely, her tone earnest. "Mrs. Bennett, I'll be frank. The reason I returned...is because of Isaac."



Danica stilled, surprise flickering across her features.She hadn't expected Katelyn's feelings to remain this strong-chasing after lsaac abroad, and even now,with his disability, refusing to let go.


Reading her thoughts, Katelyn softened her smile."Please don't misunderstand. When I say it's for Isaac, I mean I've come to treat him. Isaac and I grew up together. No matter what's happened, I can't turn my back on him." Danica exhaled softly, her shoulders easing as she asked, "So you're saying you intend to treat lsaac?"


"That's right," Katelyn repled with a firm nod. "You know I grew up surrounded by medicine, and l studied it seriously abroad. I've dealt with cases similar to lsaac's and performed countless surgeries.I only came back once I was certain I had the confidence to succeed. Mrs. Bennett, believe me-l can heal him."



As the words lingered in Danica's mind, she recalled the morning's headlines that had rippled through high society. If what they said was true, if Katelyn's skill truly surpassed even that of the professors, then maybe... just maybe she could do what no one else had managed.


The idea tugged at Danica, tempting as it was, until the image of Verena surfaced. She herself had gone to Verena not long ago, pleading for her help with Isaac.


And Katelyn-Danica had not forgotten her relentless pursuit of Isaac in the past. Allowing her near him again could invite trouble, or worse,misunderstandings.




Her hesitation did not escape Katelyn's sharp eyes.


With a gentle tone, Katelyn asked, "You're worried his wife won't accept it, aren't you?"


Danica gave a slow nod. Katelyn leaned closer, taking her hand with a reassuring smile. "Mrs. Bennett,Isaac's health has to come before anything else. As for me, my feelings for him faded long ago-they're nothing but distant memories now. I know full well there can never be anything between us again.Please don't mistake my intentions."


Sensing Danica's softened stance, Katelyn continued gently, "Even so, I'll always see him as one of my dearest friends. Watching him suffer like this,knowing I finally have the skill to help-how could just turn away?"


Her words settled into Danica's thoughts. If Katelyn truly possessed the ability to heal Isaac, then perhaps it would bring an extra layer of security. With a small sigh, Danica replied, "Katelyn, this isn't a decision I can make on my own. I'll have to ask Isaac what he thinks."


Katelyn's smile bightened, sweet and warm. "That's more than enough for me."


After Katelyn's departure, Danica instructed the driver to head straight for the company.


Inside his office, lsaac was bent over a stack of contracts when a knock sounded at the door.Looking up, he asked, "Mom? What brings you here?"


Danica crossed the room and lowered herself onto the sofa, her movements hesitant. Since the accident, moments alone with him had grown rare,and the words she wanted to say often died in her throat.


She filled the silence with small questions-if he was tired, what he'd eaten for lunch.


Isaac answered each one without complaint, but before she could continue, he cut in, "Mom, I really need to get back to work."


Clearing her throat, Danica forced the conversation forward. "It's about Katelyn. She's just come back from abroad and visited me earlier. She claims to have experience with conditions like yours, and... I believe she might be capable. Would you consider letting her try to treat you?"


Isaac didn't hesitate once the words left her mouth."No. There's no need."


Danica leaned forward, unwilling to back down so quickly. "But if you tried a different doctor, it might open the door to another chance at recovery..."


His hand slammed the documents flat against the desk with a sharp crack. His tone dropped, edged with ice. "Verena is already treating me, and | trust her completely. Under her care, I've been improving.I don't need anyone else, nor do I want anyone else."


What he didn't voice was the deeper truth-he wanted no connection to Katelyn, not now, not ever. The last thing he intended was to create friction with Verena.



Faced with his unyielding stance, Danica found her arguments slipping away.


A few more words passed between them before she finally rose and left the office.


Back in the car, she pulled out her phone and dialed Katelyn. "Katelyn, I spoke with lsaac about the treatment.He refused."



Her voice softened with concern, as though cushioning the blow. "You know how he is. Once his mind is set, it's like moving a mountain. Don't let it discourage you."


Katelyn, however, showed no sign of disappointment.Her lips curved into a confident smile as she answered, "I expected as much, Mrs. Bennett. Thank you for speaking with him on my behalf.Please don't worry-I won't give up. I'll make lsaac accept my treatment sooner or later." Hearing the determination in Katelyn's voice,Danica could only end the call with a weary sigh, caught between two equally stubborn hearts.
###Chapter 124 Play The Impostor




Once the call ended, the driver caught Katelyn's expression in the rearview mirror. "Miss Fuller,shall l take you home now?"


When she had left the Bennett Mansion earlier,she hadn't given that instruction. Instead, she'd told him to wait at a nearby parking lot.


Sliding her phone aside, Katelyn arched a brow. "No.Take me to the Bennett Group headquarters."


Isaac's rejection hadn't stopped her-it only made her more determined. If he refused through his mother,she would confront him herself.


"Understood," the driver replied, steering the car smoothly out of the lot.


Minutes later, the Bennett Group tower loomed before them. Before opening the door, Katelyn turned to him."Stay here and wait. There's no need to follow me inside."


She stepped out gracefully, her heels clicking against the pavement as she headed straight for the building.


The lobby was bright and bustling, two employees stationed at the reception desk.


One receptionist spotted her immediately and rose politely. "Good afternoon, miss. May I ask who you're here to see?"



Katelyn's answer was calm but direct. "I'm here for your CEO,Isaac Bennett."


The receptionist's smile stayed professional."Do you have an appointment with him?"


Katelyn shook her head once. "No, I don't."


A flicker of hesitation crossed the receptionist's face."I'm sorry, but without an appointment, I'm afraid I can't let you through-" "Wait a second," the other receptionist interjected,eyes widening as she held up her phone. She had just been scrolling through the news, and the face in front of her matched perfectly with the photo on the trending article.


Given her reputation in high society, it was only natural to assume she knew their CEO.


The receptionist straightened quickly, her tone cautious but polite. "Pardon me, are you Miss Katelyn Fuller?"



Katelyn offered a composed smile. "Yes. I'm a friend of Isaac's."



The young woman hesitated before responding,"Miss Fuller, normally we can't allow visitors without an appointment. But I can contact the CEO's assistant to confirm."



"That would be helpful," Katelyn answered smoothly with a nod.



The receptionist immediately picked up the phone and dialed Jacob's number.


Inside the CEO's office, Isaac had just returned from a short meeting. He leaned back in his chair, eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose to ease the dull ache behind it.


A knock sounded against the door.


Without looking up, Isaac said quietly, "Come in."


Jacob stepped inside, bowing slightly. "Mr. Bennett,the front desk just called. Miss Katelyn Fuller is here asking to see you. She's in the lobby. How would you like me to proceed?"


At the mention of her name, Isaac's eyes snapped open, his brows tightening in iritation. So she still wouldn't back down.


His voice turned cold. "I won't be meeting her."


He opened a file on his desk and added curtly,"From this moment on, don't take any of her calIs."


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood, Mr. Bennett. I'l remember."



He exited the office and returned the receptionist's call,repeating Isaac's instructions word for word.


The receptionist turned back to Katelyn with an apologetic smile. "I'm very sorry, Miss Fuller. Mr.Bennett is currently tied up with work and won't be able to receive visitors. Perhaps you could return another time?"



Katelyn caught the deliberate politeness in her tone and knew instantly it was nothing more than a brush-off.Isaac was avoiding her, exactly as she expected.


Still, she smiled sweetly. "That's fine. I'll wait for him here."



With practiced grace, she crossed over to the lounge area and settled into a sofa, her posture calm but resolute.


As soon as she was out of earshot, the receptionist who had first spoken leaned toward her colleague and whispered, "Who is she, really? You're treating her like royalty."


The other woman gave her a sharp look before answering in a hushed tone, "That's Katelyn Fuller,daughter of Fuller Group's CEO. She moves in the same circles as Mr. Bennett. Some say they even grew up together. Do you want to be the one to offend her?"


The first receptionist frowned. "If she's so close to him,why wouldn't he agree to see her?"


Her colleague shot her a warning glare. "Keep your head down and mind your own work. Curiosity doesn't pay here."



···


Meanwhile, in Seraphina Villas, Verena carefully measured out herbs in her medical room, her focus steady on the medicine she was preparing.


Her phone, set on speaker beside her, carried Miranda's voice across the counter.


"Verena, you've been distant with me lately. You Verena let out a soft laugh. "You're always so busy. I figured I shouldn't bother you."


Miranda groaned theatrically. "I was busy, but now I'm stuck bored out of my mind. I'm venting to you while tapping around on my iPad."


Her voice brightened with curiosity. "So what's been keeping you occupied lately?"


Without slowing her hands, Verena replied, "I'm working on a new batch of medicine for lsaac."


"Medicine again?" Miranda's tone lifted with surprise. "Didn't you say the last time we talked that you'd already made something for him? Why more now?"


Still focused on her task, Verena explained, "That one was for external use. Since his condition's showing signs of progress, I'm preparing an internal prescription this time."


Miranda let out an excited gasp. "That's amazing! At this rate, he'll be back on his feet in no time. You really do live up to your reputation, Evelyn!"


Verena chuckled. "You're giving me too much credit.It'll take time, but I'll accept the compliment."


Their conversation slipped into acomfortable lull,each busy with their own activity while still sharing the moment.



Suddenly, Miranda cursed under her breath, startling Verena enough that her hand slipped, spilling too much of one ingredient. She quickly removed the excess and asked, "What happened?"


"You have to check Shoildon Entertainment's latest report," Miranda blurted out. "I saw it even from abroad. Don't tell me you haven't?"


Understanding immediately, Verena stayed calm, still tending to the mixture. Her tone was light, almost dismissive. "Ah, that? Yes, I've already seen it."


She had come across the report earlier that morning while scrolling through her phone. Miranda sounded baffled. "You've seen it, but you're this calm? Everyone in the comments is convinced that woman's Evelyn. Aren't you going to set the record straight?"


Verena arched a brow. "And why would I? I know the editor who published that piece. His writing has always been precise-never vague unless someone's pulling the strings. The woman they're talking about is just another wealthy lad, hardly a public figure.There's no story there. But the timing of the release,right as she returns from abroad, makes it obvious.She wants people to connect her name with Evelyn without ever stating it outright."


She placed the finished medicine aside, disinfected her hands, and said casually, "If she wants to play the impostor, let her. It only diverts attention from me. I'll sit back and see which assassin-for-hire takes the bait."


Miranda fell quiet for a moment, and then warned in a softer tone, "That's clever, but don't underestimate her. She's still part of the upper circle of Shoildon.if she decides to cross you, she'll only stir up bigger problems."


Where Miranda carried unease, Verena's voice stayed light, even teasing. "You're halfway across the world in Clokron, yet you're keeping closer tabs on Shoildon gossip than l am."


Miranda gave a small laugh. "Despite living in another country, I make it a point to keep up with news from back home. Besides, I follow that editor too. Normally, I scroll past his articles, but when I spotted Evelyn's name, I couldn't resist reading."


She clicked her tongue and added, "I mean it, though -what's your real take on all this?"
###Chapter 125 That's Nothing More Than Your Delusion
Verena's smile faded, her tone turning firm. "If she dares to confront me openly, let's see if she has the courage to claim she's Evelyn. Should she admt it,I'll tear off her mask myself. But if she hides behind vague hints, then I'll see if her real aim is me."


Noticing Miranda's worry, Verena softened her tone,lips curving slightly. "Relax. Other than the setbacks I've had with Isaac, there's no one left who can rattle me."



On the other end of the line, Miranda's brows knitted tighter, her unease far from soothed.


"Still," she cautioned, "you need to stay on guard.Your network is strong in Clokron, but in Shoildon,you don't have the same protection."


Verena chuckled. "Who says I'm unprotected here?  Isn't Isaac still by my side?"






As dusk settled, one of the lobby elevators chimed,drawing Katelyn's attention instantly. Her eyes lit up as soon as she saw who it was.


She quickly tucked her phone away and strode forward, her smile warm and expectant. "Isaac."


Jacob was the one wheeling lsaac out of the elevator. At the sound of Isaac's name being called,he instinctively slowed.


Katelyn's steps quickened, her expression glowing with affection. "Isaac, it's been so long.I hope you've been keeping well."


But Isaac's gaze remained fixed ahead, his face carved from stone, not sparing her even a glance.


"Jacob, did I tell you to stop?" Isaac's deep voice echoed.



Flustered by the reprimand, Jacob understood  immediately and resumed pushing the wheelchair forward without another pause.



Katelyn had long grown accustomed to lsaac's indifference, and his cold shoulder didn't faze her.


"Hold on a second." She quickened her pace,stepping directly into his path.


The persistence grated on him. Isaac lifted his eyes with visible impatience, his tone sharp. "Miss Fuller,what exactly do you want?"


His words carried the same chill as his stare, and Katelyn's lips quivered before she forced a faint smile. "Isaac, you haven't changed-you're still as heartless as ever."



A hollow laugh slipped out, her voice softening as she added, "It's been years since we last saw each other.Don't worry, I'm not the reckless woman l used to be. I won't chase you anymore. But even if we couldn't be lovers, we were still childhood friends,weren't we?"  She tried to tug on the past, but lsaac's response was merciless. "Are you finished?"


His hands tightened on the wheelchair wheels, ready to move forward at the slightest pause.


Helplessness flickered across her face, yet she still lowered her voice, almost pleading. "Isaac, please...don't shut me out completely."


His reply cut sharper than any blade. "Katelyn Fuller."


He used her full name, his tone cold and deliberate,the weight of formality striking against her casual familiarity.


"I have a wife," Isaac said flatly. "And given our past,keeping you at a distance isn't cruelty-it's common sense."


The sarcasm in his voice hit its mark, freezing her smile and leaving a hollow ache in her chest.


All her life, Katelyn had grown up believing she could claim anything she desired. Isaac was the single exception. Yet rejection only made her resolve  harden-the more he resisted, the more determined she became to have him.



Katelyn steadied her breathing, forcing herself into a gentler tone. "I'm sure your mother already told you why I came. Isaac, I'm worried about your health.I've studied cases like yours for years-let me handle your treatment,please?"


Her voice lifted with urgency as she continued, "I swear I can get you walking again. You don't have to be afraid-I only want to heal your legs. I won't ask for anything in return, and I won't interfere in your marriage."


Those promises sounded sincere, but whether she meant them was a truth only Katelyn carried.


Isaac didn't blink. "So you sent my mother to plead for you," he said coolly. "Did she forget to mention that my wife is also a doctor-and she's the one treating me?"


His eyes hardened, his voice edged with ice."You claim you won't ask for anything in return. Do you  really think the moment you ask, I'll simply hand it over?"



Katelyn had expected some trace of softness, a hint of courtesy for their shared past. Instead, his blunt rejection sliced through her like glass.


Her chest tightened, resentment flashing in her eyes at the way he spoke of his wife. He accepted someone like Verena, yet always turned her away.


Katelyn said nothing, but lsaac caught the flicker of dissatisfaction instantly.


"Katelyn," he said, his tone cold but deliberate, "we grew up together. You know me well-but I know you better. If you wanted nothing, you wouldn't be here waiting for hours, desperate to force a chance to speak."


The words cut too close to the truth, and panic flickered in her gaze before she could stop it.


Isaac leaned forward slightly, his voice steady and merciless. "Let's be clear. I love my wife. I will never  give you hope. Don't waste your time scheming to drive a wedge between us. Even if Verena walked away from me tomorrow, I still wouldn't choose you.Do you understand?"


The words left his mouth like a cold truth, but the weight of them carried a warning as well.


Katelyn's jaw tightened, her smile stiff and brittle."Since you insist on being so blunt, then I'll stop pretending too. Fine, I still have feelings for you-that's why it kills me to see you like this. If you're so sure about your feelings, then why won't you accept my treatment? What are you afraid of?"


Isaac didn't hesitate. "'It's not fear. It's refusal."


He had no desire for entanglement with her, no wish to plant even the faintest shadow of insecurity in Verena's heart, and absolutely no interest in inviting misunderstandings into his marriage.


"Jacob. We're leaving."


At the order, Jacob pushed the wheelchair forward,  guiding Isaac past Katelyn without pause.


Her hands balled into fists, fury spilling out as she shouted after him, "Isaac! Are you really going to let your stubborn pride trap you in that chair for the rest of your life?"


The words hit the air like a slap. Jacob's grip faltered,his body stiffening. He wanted to look at Isaac's face,but from his position behind the chair, he couldn't see the storm gathering there.


Across the lobby, both receptionists froze,exchanging wide-eyed glances. Ever since Isaac had been confined to a wheelchair, Danica had strictly forbidden anyone from uttering such words. Yet here was Katelyn, bold enough to fling them straight at him.



Seeing that Jacob had stopped pushing the wheelchair, Katelyn stepped closer, her voice sharp and unrelenting. "Face it, Isaac-no one but me can save your legs. You're clinging to hope in your wife,but think about it. She's just a medical student from Pine Hill University. Every doctor you've sought  before her came from prestigious institutions, world-class specialists with reputations that eclipse hers."


She pressed harder, her tone cutting. "If doctors from the top of their field couldn't cure you, what makes you think Verena possibly could?"


Isaac didn't bother addressingher long-winded claims. He latched onto the last line, pivoting his chair toward her.11SO1according to you， she can＇t一but you can?"


The sudden glance from him made Katelyn's pulse race. Convinced she'd finally broken through, she fought to keep the excitement off her face and nodded eagerly. "Yes. I can. I'm more qualified than any of those so-called specialists."


But before her anticipation could take root, lsaac gave a low, humorless laugh. "That's nothing more than your delusion."


His voice cut like ice. Turning away, he wheeled himself forward without another word, leaving her staring at his back as it grew smaller in the distance.
###Chapter 126 Jealousy Only Comes From Caring
By late afternoon, Verena had finished preparing the last of Isaac's medicine. With her work done, she curled into the swing chair on her balcony, lazily flipping through a book as the sunlight spilled across the pages.


The faint click of the door caught her ear. She glanced over her shoulder and her lips curved into a warm smile. "Isaac, you're back."


Closing the book with ease, she set it on the small table beside her and rose gracefully, heading in his direction.


He answered with a distracted nod, his eyes lingering on her longer than usual, something clouded in their depths.


Isaac's mind was elsewhere. He knew Katelyn's   temperament far too well-reckless, obsessive,unpredictable. If she decided to fix her madness on Verena, she would stop at nothing. That thought alone weighed heavily on him.


"The food's already set," Verena said lightly. "Shall we head down for dinner?"


But her husband seemed lost in thought, unmoving.She tilted her head, catching his unease. "Isaac,what's on your mind?"


He shook it off, though his tone carried quiet warning. "If someone tries reaching out to you in the next few days, ignore them."


Her brows arched, curiosity sparking in her gaze."Oh? So there is someone stirring up trouble?"


Leaning back against the wall, Verena rested her chin in her palm, a knowing smile tugging at her lips."Don't tell me it's one of your old admirers."


Her voice held more teasing amusement than jealousy, as though she were fishing for gossip  instead of reassurance.


That lack of envy unsettled Isaac in a way he couldn't explain. A strange urge rose in him-he wanted her to care, if only a little. "Yes," he admitted quietly. "A woman who chased after me for years back in school."


Verena's eyes widened, her tone laced with exaggerated surprise. "Since school? That's real devotion. Even after all this time, and despite you being married, she still hasn't let go? How touching.Aren't you even a little moved by such loyalty?"


She bent closer, her playful expression hovering just inches from his face, as though she were defending the other woman instead of him.


Isaac narrowed his eyes, studying her face as though searching for the faintest crack. What he found wasn't jealousy at all, but an almost curious spark-as if she were intrigued rather than unsettled.


A strange restlessness stirred in him, and his brows pulled tight. "So you really don't care?" he asked, his  tone low, edged with frustration.


Verena tilted her head, confusion flickering across her features. "Why would I?" she replied honestly."You're not involved with her, are you? Then what's there to be upset about?"


Her calmness doused his agitation, yet it brought him no comfort.


Katelyn meant nothing to him. That was the truth.But what he wanted wasn't just Verena's logical acceptance-it was fire. He wanted proof that she cared enough to be shaken, to feel possessive, to burn for him the way he quietly burned for her.


His gaze lingered on her, questions coiling in his chest. Was her serenity rooted in trust? Or was it indifference-proof that no matter what he did,he would never truly move her heart?


The thought struck deep, leaving him hollow. For the first time, he felt as though her world might remain forever out of his reach. He lowered his head, voice breaking softer than a whisper. "If our roles were reversed, I'd be furious Because jealousy only comes from caring."


Though barely spoken, the stillness of the room carried his whisper straight to her. She froze, the weight of his words sinking in, and for once, her steady composure faltered.


Sliding down to meet him at eye level, Verena rested a hand gently on his knee. "Isaac, you've misunderstood me," she said softly, her voice warm."I'm not unbothered because | don't care. I'm unbothered because I know you. I know you'd never betray me. My calmness isn't indifference-it's trust."


His throat worked as he swallowed, and he brushed his fingertips lightly along her cheek, almost as though he needed to feel she was real. "You mean that?" he murmured, the question trembling with vulnerability.


Isaac's hands framed her face, his touch firm yet reverent, and before Verena could react, his lips pressed against hers. The kiss was unhurried at first, tender enough to make her lashes flutter closed. Without thinking, her arms looped around his neck, pulling him closer, her body answering his without hesitation.


That simple, instinctive gesture stirred something turbulent in him. What began as a soft kiss deepened, their breaths blending, their hearts drumming to the same rhythm.


Just as her body melted into the moment, Isaac drew back slightly, his lips hovering over hers.


Verena's brows furrowed faintly, her voice low and questioning. "Why did you stop..."


He didn't give her time to finish her question. In one smooth motion, he caught her hand, tugged her forward, and settled her onto his lap.


Startled, Verena gasped, but her surprise was quickly drowned when his mouth found hers again-this time fierce, deliberate, claiming. His hand cradled the back of her head, keeping her close,while his tongue brushed past her lips with teasing  insistence.


The world tilted. Breathless, she leaned back slightly,searching for air, but Isaac's arm tightened around her waist. It wasn't forceful-it was almost childlike, a desperate hold as though he feared she might slip away,his silent declaration that she belonged to him.


The kiss lingered, consuming and heady, until her lips tingled with numbness.


When he finally eased away, Verena stared at him with hazy eyes, her chest rising unsteadily.Her lips parted with a faint laugh. "So... are we still having dinner?"


Isaac pressed her closer against him, his breath warm at her ear, his voice low and roughened. "Of course."


That lingering kiss had lightened Isaac's mood-at least she hadn't pushed him away. Maybe, just maybe,she felt something for him after all.


Dinner passed, and when Verena set her utensils  down, she checked the clock and turned to him."Come with me to the bedroom. It's time for a health check."


Isaac's brow arched. "Didn't you already check me earlier this week?"


"From now on, we'll be doing it every day. Think of it as treatment, not just observation," Verena replied.


Inside the bedroom, she guided him to the bed,arranging pillows behind him until he rested comfortably against the headboard.


Isaac no longer carried the stiff unease he once had under her care. Without waiting for instructions, he loosened his belt and slid his trousers partway down.


Her voice cut through the quiet, low and deliberate."Keep going."


Isaac froze, uncertain he'd heard her right. His eyes flicked up to meet hers.


Perched at the bedside, Verena tilted her head, the corners of her lips curving into a slow, knowing smile. "You heard me. Everything."


Her gaze dipped pointedly toward the dark blue boxers that still clung to him. "Even those."


A dry swallow caught in his throat. "That wasn't necessary before..."


Verena leaned in, her expression calm but edged with amusement. "Because before, the treatment hadn't reached this stage. Tonight, I'll be using a new method-precise, demanding, and far more detailed than anything we've tried so far. I'll need to watch your body's response, track the timing of every shift,and record it all carefully."


Her eyes glimmered with a mix of mischief and authority as she lowered her voice. "So, Isaac... are you going to undress yourself? Or should I do it for you?"


Heat surged across lsaac's skin, climbing from his collar to his cheeks until his whole face burned crimson. Words stumbled from his lips, broken and useless."I...|-" Amusement flickered in Verena's eyes, her mood turning playful as she leaned in closer. Her fingertip began at his temple, trailing slowly down the bridge of his nose before pausing at his mouth. She brushed against his lips with the faintest touch, a feather-light caress meant only to test his restraint.


The contact made his throat tighten. Isaac swallowed hard, his head tilting toward her fingers as if drawn against his wil,aching for more.


But she denied him that satisfaction. Her hand slipped lower, pressing gently against his chest,circling deliberately as though she owned every inch.


Isaac had slipped into his home clothes, yet he could still feel her touch pressing through the thin fabric,frustratingly distant, liketrying to scratch an itch with a glove on.


Verena's slow teasing was too much for him, and his throat tightened as his Adam's apple bobbed twice, a rough gasp slipping free.


Not missing his reaction, Verena moved closer, her  lips nearly grazing his ear. "Isaac, you blush at the smallest touch. How will you manage when things go further?"



Her fingers traced down his torso, slow and teasing,until they hovered at the edge of his waistband."You clearly can't decide... so let me decide for you."


That was when lsaac's hand shot forward, gripping her wrist, his voice unsteady but firm. "No..."


Feigning hurt, Verena lifted her gaze to his, her lashes trembling as though on the verge of tears. "So unwilling to accept my treatment? Don't you want us to finally become a real husband and wife?"
###Chapter 127 I'm An Old Acquaintance Of Isaac's
Color crept up lsaac's neck, staining his ears and cheeks as he shifted uneasily beneath Verena's gaze. Every part of him betrayed how much he wanted her, how much he wanted to be her husband in the truest sense.
He turned his head sharply, refusing to meet her eyes. "I'll... I'll take them off myself," he muttered.
Verena caught the flicker of nerves in his voice and finally relented, a knowing smile tugging at her lips.Without another word, she drew back her hand and crossed the room to retrieve the medical kit.

By the time she turned again, he had already stripped away his boxers, leaving his lower body bare. His long legs were still muscular, every line of muscle etched in quiet defiance.  Though she had seen him before under different circumstances, this moment carried a weight all its own. His memory erased those past intimacies,but hers did not.


Verena inhaled slowly, steadying herself before dipping a cotton swab into the medicine. She pressed the cool liquid against the firm planes of his abdomen.


A shiver ran through him. His fists clenched on the sheets, his jaw tight, as though sheer willpower kept him from reacting further.


He kept his face turned away, the flush climbing higher.


The shame wasn't in the treatment itself-he wasn't resisting her skill. It was the vulnerability, the exposure, the thought of her unwavering eyes on him.



But Verena's focus was absolute. Once her hands began their work, nothing distracted her-not the heat radiating from him, not the ragged cadence of  his breath.


When the medicine reached its peak effect, she set the swab aside and carefully took up her silver needles. With precision born of years of mastery, she pressed each one into the right points along his abdomen, steady and unerring.


This time, Verena abandoned gentleness. One by one, the needles slid into place with deliberate pressure, sharper and more demanding than before.


"Hh-" Isaac sucked in a harsh breath, his jaw locked as sweat prickled along his hairline.


Her gaze lingered on his face, calm but probing. "Do you feel it burning? Like the heat is rising inside you?"


He gave a strained nod, fingers digging into the sheets as though to anchor himself. The fire in his abdomen had spread upward, licking at his chest,leaving him restless and raw.


Verena's tone carried reassurance, though her hands  remained steady. "Your body responded to our closeness the other day, which was promising. Today I raised the dosage and refined the method.What you're feeling means the treatment is working."


Through the haze of heat, lsaac's eyes locked on hers. Pain was something he could bear, especially when it came with hope. His hand shot up, clutching hers with surprising force, his voice rough with longing. "Tell me... will I really become the man beside you in every way? Not just in name?"


Her heart trembled at the naked plea in his wvords.She squeezed his hand firmly, meeting his gaze head-on. "Yes, Isaac. Trust me-you will."


Isaac saw the care in her eyes. For a moment, the fire in his body wasn't the only thing consuming him. His dark eyes softened, filled with emotions he couldn't untangle-half devotion,half confusion.


Was this woman's heart truly his? At times she looked at him as though she cherished him more than her own life. At others, she seemed impossibly distant. The next morning, Katelyn replayed her conversation with Isaac from the day before. Every sentence from him had revolved around his wife. The way he shielded Verena gnawed at her, stirring both fury and unease.


He had warned her not to seek Verena out, but that only cemented her resolve to do exactly that. If Isaac guarded her so fiercely, perhaps Verena wasn't as capable as people claimed. Maybe she was only strong enough to deal with fools like Kaia.


Katelyn's fingers danced across her phone screen,pulling up her assistant's messages. Within moments, she found the number she'd been given-Verena's. Without hesitation, she pressed call.


Meanwhile, Verena had just set her cup aside and was heading for the stairs when her phone buzzed.She didn't bother glancing at the caller ID; habit led her to swipe and answer immediately.


"Hello?" Good morning, Ms. Verena Willis."


A smooth, unfamiliar female voice drifted through the receiver. Verena frowned and finally glanced at the screen. Unknown number.



"Who's speaking?" she asked evenly.


The woman on the other end gave a soft, deliberate laugh. "Let's just say I'm... an old acquaintance of Isaac's."



The way the stranger spoke lsaac's name-soft,almost possessive-caught Verena's attention.


Isaac's words from the night before came back to her. So this must be her, the one who'd chased after him since school. Bold woman, Verena thought, to appear this quickly and so directly.


Her tone remained calm, almost indifferent. "What exactly do you want?"


On the other end, Katelyn was a bit surprised that Verena didn't ask for more details about her identity.With a light laugh, she said, "I do have something to  say, but over the phone feels... impersonal. Why don't we meet this afternoon? I'll tell you everything face to face."



Verena didn't need long to recognize the hidden thorns in Katelyn's voice. Still, shewasn't one to shy away from a challenge. "Fine. I'll meet you."


She ended the call before the other woman could add another word.


Staring at the darkened screen, Verena's lips curved into a cool, knowing smile.
###Chapter 128 Let Her Wait





That afternoon, Katelyn realized her meeting with Verena was coming up, so she picked out a sleek silver handbag from the closet, dressed herself with meticulous care, and strutted out in her favorite heels.


She arrived at a cozy restaurant in Shoildon, claimed a corner table, and sent Verena a quick message with her location. "I'm here now. See you soon."


Settling in, Katelyn ordered a juice and waited, the picture of composure.


Verena responded with a simple, "Okay." Then she placed her phone aside and continued her work on her laptop.


There was a reason people trusted a woman's instincts-they were hardly ever wrong.


When Katelyn called earlier, Verena instantly picked up on the underlying tension that this was no friendly invitation.



Sensing that Katelyn had her own agenda, Verena had no intention of playing along easily. Since Katelyn had already arrived, Verena decided to let her wait.



Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Katelyn saw Verena's short response and figured she was on her way.


A self-satisfied grin formed on Katelyn's lips. She assumed Isaac's wife would be easy to deal with.After all, she'd agreed to meet without any hesitation.



With her confidence soaring, Katelyn locked her phone and slipped it back into her bag, ready for whatever came next.



Thinking Verena would walk in any minute, she sat back and watched the door, waiting patiently.


After finishing almost three glasses of juice, Katelyn grew impatient, and Verena still hadn't appeared. Her eyes swept the room, but there wasn't a single familiar face heading in her direction.


A quick glance at her phone told Katelyn that nearly an hour had slipped by. Irritation flickered across her features. Apart from Isaac, she'd never waited so long for anyone. If meeting Verena hadn't been essential, she would have walked out ages ago.


Katelyn pushed down her annoyance and kept scrolling through her feed, doing her best to appear unfazed.



Elsewhere, Verena closed her laptop with a quiet snap and made her way downstairs, phone in hand.


Rhonda greeted her with a polite smile. "Are you heading out, Mrs. Bennett? Should I ask the driver to get the car ready?"


Verena shook her head, her expression light.′′NO need, I'll drive myself. I won't be gone long, so there's really no point."


Seraphina Villas weren't far from the restaurant Katelyn picked, so the drive took Verena less than twenty minutes.


Once inside, Verena told a server her name and waited as she was guided through the dining area.


The server pointed toward the far side of the room with a welcoming smile. "Ma'am, your table is over on the right."


Verena gave a nod of appreciation. "Thank you,I see it."


With that, the server offered a small bow and hurried off to her next task.



Turning toward the spot the server indicated,Verena spotted an empty table with just a single glass set out.



At that moment, another server approached with a new glass of juice, while a young woman, her attention fixed on her phone, hurried right into the server's path.


Their paths collided, causing the server to lose balance and splash juice onto the woman's hand.
A quick apology came from the server. "I'm so sorry about that."
She fumbled for a napkin, reaching out to help clean the spill.
The woman sidestepped the gesture, snatching a napkin herself to wipe her hand.
A glance down confirmed Katelyn's outfit was unscathed, much to her relief, especially since the clothes were a rare, limited edition piece.
Annoyance from her long wait for Verena now bubbled up over this small accident. She shot the server a cold glare. "Could you try being more careful?"
The server's cheeks turned crimson as she murmured another apology. "I'm truly sorry, I'll bring you a replacement right away."
Unimpressed, Katelyn waved her off. "Forget it. Just get back to your work." Visibly grateful, the server bowed several more times before retreating.
###Chapter 129 Persuade Isaac To Accept Her Treatment Plan
From a distance, Verena silently observed the commotion, taking in every detail as the scene unfolded. Apparently, the woman who had spent years chasing after lsaac was the arrogant type.


Shrugging off her thought, Verena strode over to the table.


Katelyn was still dabbing juice from her fingers when a soft shadow approached her. Looking up, she found herself face-to-face with a woman whose features were refined and whose presence was effortlessly graceful.


A slight arch of her brow, and Katelyn paused. "So you must be Verena Willis?"


A gentle smile appeared as Verena gave a nod."That's right, I'm Verena." An unexpected wave of discomfort washed over Katelyn at Verena's easy acknowledgment. She'd gone to great lengths to look her best, thinking she might unsettle Verena with her own confidence.Knowing Kaia since childhood, Katelyn had assumed Verena would possess the same simple, understated grace as Kaia. She had never anticipated how strikingly beautiful Verena actually was.


Without another glance, Katelyn tossed her used napkin into the trash, her lips curving into a calculated smile. "If memory serves, we agreed on two o'clock for this meeting."


Verena pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes flicking to her phone before she spoke. "Is that so?I'm sorry about that. Looks like I'm running an hour behind."


Despite the apology, Verena's tone was airy and nonchalant, betraying no real regret.


An hour of waiting had frayed Katelyn's patience, and Verena's relaxed attitude only made things worse. It stung to think lsaac had chosen someone like Verena  over her. Besides her beauty, what did this woman possibly have to offer?


There wasn't any point in starting a fight right away,so Katelyn forced her irritation down and kept her smile intact. Still, her words carried unmistakable sarcasm. "I heard you grew up somewhere pretty remote and only came to Shoildon this year. I suppose punctuality isn't something you're used to."


Beneath Katelyn's soft tone, her words carried a subtle bite.



Rather than rising to the challenge, Verena turned to a waiter and quietly asked for a glass of water.


It wasn't long before the waiter returned,setting the glass in front of her. Verena offered a quiet thank you, took a small sip, and then looked across the table at Katelyn with a calm smile. "Apologies, I've had my hands full lately, so anything not urgent tends to get pushed aside. As for my sense of time..."


She paused for a moment, mneeting Katelyn's gaze with a mild, almost teasing comment. "I'm actually  the type who's never late. Today's meeting with you just slipped my mind, that's all."


Katelyn's lips curled in a private smirk. What kind of person claimed to be punctual, only to forget a meeting? It was obvious to her that Verena's lack of polish showed, even now that she was living in comfort. No matter how fancy Verena's new life,she'd always be out of place among the elite with Isaac.People in their social circle would surely gossip about the two of them.


The more Katelyn dwelled on it, the more convinced she became that lsaac couldn't really be in love with Verena. He was just being dutiful, keeping up appearances for the sake of family expectations.


Surely, Katelyn believed only someone like her, a childhood friend with history and a connection to Isaac's world, could truly stand beside him,through whatever came their way.


Shaking off these thoughts, KKatelyn kept her expression perfectly composed. "You must be incredibly busy. I appreciate you squeezing me in," she said. Then she added with a hint of emphasis,
"I'm Katelyn Fuller, Isaac's friend since we were children, and, as you may have heard, we are childhood sweethearts."
Katelyn lingered on the phrase "childhood sweethearts," making it clear she wanted Verena to notice just how special her.connection with lsaac was.
Verena remained composed, her face relaxed and friendly as she patiently waited for Katelyn to say more.
When Verena's expression remained unfazed,Katelyn assumed she must be holding back a pang of jealousy. After all, what woman wouldn't feel uneasy facing her husband's childhood sweetheart?
Straightening in her seat, Katelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. "To tell you the truth, I came today because I'm concerned about lsaac's health. As his wife, I'm sure you want the best for his recovery, just as l do."  Verena took a moment to study Katelyn, searching her memory for the connection, and then it clicked.Katelyn's name had come up in those tabloid articles linked to Evelyn.


With the pieces falling into place, Verena quickly saw through Katelyn's intentions.


One eyebrow lifted, she responded, "Of course I want Isaac to get better. But what exactly are you suggesting, Miss Fuller? Are you hoping to oversee Isaac's treatment yourself?"


With unwavering confidence, Katelyn met Verena's direct gaze. "That's right, I plan to take on lsaac's treatment myself.I know you're a doctor as well, but his situation isn't something just anyone can manage."


"ls that so?" Verena leaned back and crossed her arms, her voice cool."SOo you believe you can succeed where I would fail, is that right?"


Although Katelyn was convinced of her own abilities,she made sure her words and posture radiated poise and sophistication in Verena's presence.


Katelyn tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear,offering a warm smile. "Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not doubting your abilities. The truth is,Isaac's mother has already sought out numerous renowned doctors, and none have succeeded. Your credentials are impressive, but so many have tried and failed with Isaac. Every unsuccessful attempt only makes things harder for him. We simply can't take unnecessary risks with his health."



A soft chuckle escaped Verena. She recognized how cleverly Katelyn tried to elevate herself while subtly undermining her at the same time.


"Of course, no one should be reckless with lsaac's well-being.But what makes you so sure that I'm the risk, and you're the solution?" Verena crossed one leg over the other, a spark of amusement in her gaze."Miss Fuller, you and I both know medicine doesn't offer guarantees. No real doctor would promise a perfect outcome, isn't that right?"


"I can make that claim because I've achieved results before," Katelyn replied, her smile taking on a hint of superiority. "Could it be that you're doubting me because lsaac's shown some improvement while you're caring for him?"


Lifting her glass, Verena took a calm sip, unfazed."Whether he's getting better or not, why does that matter to you?"


The evasive response only seemed to confirm Katelyn's suspicions. She felt even more certain that Verena wasn't capable of curing Isaac; if shewere,she wouldn't be so indirect.



Her assessment now complete, Katelyn dismissed Verena as all ego and little substance-not worth her energy or competition.


Leaning in,Katelyn lowered her voice and spoke with deliberate clarity. "Let me reassure you, I'm not here to stir up any drama. My only goal is to see lsaac recover, which benefits you too, doesn't it? I'd appreciate it if you'd support me in convincing lsaac to accept my treatment." Verena saw right through Katelyn's indirect tactics now. Katelyn wasn't just eager to showcase her long-standing bond with lsaac; she also wanted her to persuade Isaac to accept her treatment plan.
###Chapter 130 Why Not Hand Her The Stage

Verena tilted her head slightly, her gaze steadly on Katelyn.Since you're so certain you can heal lsaac,why don't you tell me where exactly you practice?"


Katelyn's lips curved, but her eyes carried a glint of calculation. "That's a private matter. Not something I can just reveal."



Her voice lowered with deliberate mystery. "But surely you've heard of that world-renowned surgeon abroad-the one who takes on impossible cases and never faiIs?"



The implication was clear, almost brazen.


Amusement flickered across Verena's face. Of course she knew who Katelyn was hinting at. How could she not? The so-called legend was none other than herself. It seemed this woman had truly decided to wear Evelyn's mask.


Her smile deepened with quiet mockery. "Are you suggesting Evelyn?"


At the name, Katelyn's expression didn't flinch.She neither confirmed nor denied, but the confidence radiating from her grew thicker, as if she were basking in the illusion. "Some truths don't need to be spelled out. Her reputation speaks for itself, doesn't it?"



Verena almost laughed. How absurd. Who didn't stumble at the start? She had once faced failures,mistakes that had carved lessons into her bones. No doctor was flawless, yet Katelyn was painting perfection as if it were gospel.


Katelyn danced around the truth, tossing out half-answers that dangled like bait. She wanted the room to believe she was Evelyn, yet kept enough distance to deny it later if things went sour.


Verena,unwilling to give her such an escape route,leaned in with a feigned air of curiosity. "Oh, I've eard of her. She's rather extraordínary. Tell me,though-what exactly is your relationship with Evelyn?"


Katelyn faltered, the confident curve of her lips stiffening for the briefest second. Had Verena really not caught on? She had been dropping hints like breadcrumbs, practically spelling it out, yet this woman still pressed for an answer.


Openly declaring herself Evelyn would be dangerous -too many threads that could unravel if anyone started pulling. So she swallowed the risk and smoothed her smile. "As I mentioned a moment ago,some truths don't need to be spelled out. There are things my work prevents me from speaking about directly."


Verena's laugh was light, but the gleam in her eyes carried a sharper edge. Her nails tapped softly against the wooden table in a steady rhythm, each click a subtle warning. "Then tell me plainly-should I expect you to bring Evelyn here for lsaac's treatment,or are you trying to convince me that you are Evelyn?"


The tapping stopped. HHer hand stilled, her gaze locked on Katelyn's face. Though her voice was calm, the weight in her words cut straight through the room like a blade.



Katelyn stiffened under Verena's steady gaze. What was this supposed to mean? Why wasn't Verena swallowing the story?


Doubt flickered through her. Could Verena actually have ties to Evelyn? No,ridiculous.


Pine Hill University turned out droves of medical graduates every year. Someone like Verena-quiet,unremarkable-could never get close to Evelyn, let alone know her personally. Even she hadn't managed to step foot in Evelyn's hospital.


Forcing her unease down, Katelyn straightened her back, though her smile began to falter at the edges."I've already said, certain things can't be spoken aloud. You don't need to press me. All you really need to understand is this-lsaac's recovery is in my hands, and mine alone."


Verena let out a quiet laugh, the sound light but edged with scorn. It was almost amusing-Katelyn repeated the lie so often she seemed to have convinced herself it was the truth. As though she wasn't just pretending to be Evelyn, but actually slipping into the role, losing the line between fantasy and reality.


"Miss Fuller," Verena said, her tone silk over steel, "I must thank you for showing such concern. Especially for my husband."


She dragged those last two words out slowvly,savoring the weight of them, as if staking her claim in front of Katelyn and daring her to challenge it.


Verena caught the faint shift in Katelyn's expression and let a warm, almost disarming smile spread across her lips. "But I can't make that choice for Isaac. Since you're so certain about your skills, I'll leave it to him. You can talk to him directly. If he values his health, I'm sure he won't ignore such an offer. As for me, if he agrees, I won't object." For all her patient waiting, that was all Katelyn got-an elegant brush-off wrapped in politeness. Rage bubbled under her skin, though her smile hardened like ice. "So this is your game? Are you toying with me?"


Verena tilted her head, eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Why ever would you think that? I simnply don't know you well enough to judge your sincerity.People wear masks, Miss Fuller, and intentions are rarely as pure as they seem. That's why I believe the decision should rest with lsaac-he knows you far better than I do."


The calm cruelty in her tone only stoked Katelyn's fury. Before she could gather a reply, Verena rose gracefully, her every movement deliberate. "I've said what I needed to say. Goodbye, Miss Fuller."


With that, she turned and walked away, her figure retreating like a final taunt.


Katelyn sat frozen, trying to process the sting of Verena's words. It took her a long moment to realize she had been neatly cornered and dismissed. Her eyes clung to Verena's retreating silhouette, a venomous wish burning that she could pierce straight through her back.


That woman wasn't extraordinary-just the daughter of a minor Shoildon family barely worthy of mention.She, on the other hand, was Katelyn Fuller, the only heiress of the Fuller empire, courted and admired wherever she went.


What gave Verena the gall to carry herself like some untouchable queen? Only the Bennett name wrapped around her finger. Strip her of Isaac and his family's prestige, and she'd crumble back into the mediocrity she came from.


The insult dug deeper with every passing second.She had wasted more than an hour, waiting with patience she rarely gave anyone, only to be brushed aside as though she were nothing. Why should Verena get to wear the title of Mrs. Bennett?


Katelyn's heart twisted with fury at the thought. She had loved Isaac for over ten years, chased him with persistence that would have broken a weaker man, yet still she never won him. In the end, Verena hadn't earned him-she had stumbled into him, a wornan who got everything by chance while Katelyn was left grasping at the edges.


Katelyn seethed at the thought of lsaac choosing Verena over her. Everything she had invested-years of devotion, relentless pursuit-shattered the moment Verena appeared in his life.


Even after Verena's silhouette vanished from sight,Katelyn's eyes stayed locked on the doorway,burning with resentment as though the woman still stood there mocking her.


Meanwhile, Verena strolled calmly out of the restaurant, her steps unhurried as she headed toward the parking lot. With one hand, she pulled out her phone and dialed Miranda.


The call connected almost instantly, Miranda's teasing voice filling the line. "Well, well, what a surprise. Dr. Willis actually calling me first-this must be historic." A soft laugh slipped from Verena, though her tone shifted quickly. "Save the jokes. I have something important to discuss."


Miranda straightened her voice, sensing the seriousness. "Alright, what's going on?"


Sliding into the driver's seat, Verena shut the door behind her but didn't bother starting the car. "You were right the other day. That woman really is using Evelyn's name to serve her own agenda. I can't pin down her endgame yet, but her current plan is clear -she's trying to use Evelyn's reputation as leverage to treat lsaac, get close to him, and worm her way into his life."



Miranda let out a dry laugh. "What a joke. She really thinks she can pull that off? And you're just going to let her prance around pretending? You're not planning to call her out?"


Verena's lips curved into a faint smile as she replied,"Not yet."


Her gaze drifted toward the scenery outside the window, a glint of amusement sparking in her eyes."Actually, you've reminded me of something important. There's already a pack of vultures circling,waiting for the chance to drag me down. If she wants to claim Evelyn's name so badly, why not hand her the stage? Let's see how long she lasts when the knives come out. We can take the chance to handle those attackers."


Miranda's voice brightened with approva1. "That's brilliant, Verena. You're turning her ambition into bait.Let her draw the fire while you sit back and watch-classic strategy."


"Careful with the praise. Too much of it might make me think I actually enjoy playing these games,"Verena teased, her fingers tapping the steering wheel before she started the car. "I'm driving now;we'll talk later."


Miranda chuckled. "Fine, I'll stop before you get cocky.Drive safe."


The line clicked off, and Verena eased the car onto the road. In seconds, she was lost in the stream of traffic, her calm expression hiding the storm of calculations already forming in her mind.
###Chapter 1311 Need You To Take The Next Step For Me

Anger followed Katelyn through the front door. She moved briskly past the living room, her expression tight,while the butler stood silently aside and watched her take the stairs two at a time.
Years of service had taught the butler exactly when to keep his distance. Reading her mood in an instant,he kept quiet and stayed out of her path.
Once she reached the upper floor, Katelyn threw open the door to a secluded room.
Half-shuttered curtains filled the space with a dull gray glow. Anyone who walked in would have mistaken the place for a backroom operating table.
But this was no clinic.Floor-to-ceiling shelves lined the walls, holding jar after jar of animal organs and oddities, making it a scientist's lab gone grim.
Without sparing the shelves a glance, Katelyn snatched up a scalpel and dragged a trembling lab rat from a wire cage at her feet.
She pressed the rat down and cut into its side, making no effort to spare it pain-her anger finding an outlet in the violence.
The look in her eyes turned cold and vicious-a far cry from the graceful, polished woman she showed the world outside these walls.
Over and over, she drove the scalpel into the helpless animal, twisting what should have been a tool for saving lives into something brutal.
Weak squeals broke from the rat as it thrashed, the sounds fading fast in the wide, echoing room.
Katelyn barely registered the noise. Her stare was empty while she muttered again and again, "You think you can take what belongs to me? How dare you!"
Each angry whisper brought Verena's face into focus in her mind. She pictured the blade cutting into her rival, not just the animal.
Revenge simmered in her thoughts. She wanted to see Verena suffer, inch by inch.
As the rat's strength faded, it gave one last desperate kick and raked its claws across Katelyn's hand.
Pain shot through her, snapping her out of her haze. She gasped for breath and lifted her arm high.
A final shrill squeak pierced the room.
A moment later, the rat's limp body slid from the table, leaving the room in sudden, utter silence.
"Ah!" A sharp cry rang out from the hallway.
Kaia froze in place, covering her mouth with her hand as she stared in shock at the blood smeared across Katelyn's fingers.
Katelyn turned at the noise and asked coldly, "How much did you see?"
"I... just walked in," Kaia stammered, lowering her hand and trying not to gag from the metallic scent of blood. "I heard your heels on the stairs, so I knew you were home. When I couldn't find you, I saw this door open and thought I'd look."
Katelyn gave a short nod. "Alright."
A note of worry crept into Kaia's voice. "Did something happen to make you this upset?"
"Nothing's wrong," said Katelyn, brushing her off.
Katelyn flashed a smile that looked too smooth, and for a second, Kaia wondered if she had imnagined the earlier flash of anger.
Holding up her stained hand, Katelyn explained, "I was prepping for an experiment, but this rat went wild and tried to bite me. My professor in college always said, 'If a specimen attacks, you put it down right away.Did I startle you?"
Of course,Katelyn was lying. There was no way she'd let Kaia know she was really lashing out over Verena. Kaia had never come across such a principle during her studies, but since it came from her idol, she was ready to accept it without question.
Trying not to look at the mess, Kaia swallowed her disgust and forced a weak smile. "No, I'm fine."
"I'll handle this," Katelyn said quietly. "Go on back to your room. I'll stop by in a bit to talk."
Kaia nodded and hurried away, doing her best not to throw up.
A little while later, Katelyn showed up at Kaia's door.
Sliding onto the bed next to Kaia, Katelyn put on a gentle smile. "So, how are you feeling now? Any better?"After leaving Willis Villa, Kaia got caught in a downpour. The cold she picked up from that night had lingered for weeks.
Kaia, surprised by Kat nearly over it."
"That's what I wanted the next step for me."
Right away, Kaia caugh
When Katelyn nodded,
Katelyn arched a brow forgiveness. If they as past mistakes, anything
Returning home felt lik been a rash decision. D
After a moment of silen
Kaia started to get up, b	elyn's sudden concern, nodded eagerly. "Yeah, I've been taking my meds and I'm
	to hear." Katelyn squeezed her hand,locking eyes with her. "Listen, I need you to take t her meaning, her face lighting up. "Is it time for us to finally start our revenge?"
 Kaia's excitement grew. "What's the plan? Just say it, I'll handle it."
, a sly grin forming. "First, you've got to go home and beg your parents for k, make it sound like you went through hell-say you were in danger, you realize your . Play the part, cry if you have to, but make sure they forgive you."
e admitting defeat, but Kaia knew she couldn't avoid her family forever. Leaving had eep down, she worried Alec and Laura might turn their backs on her.
ce, Kaia nodded. "Alright; I'll do it."
ut Katelyn caught her by the arm. "Wait, that's not all."
Confused, Kaia glanced back. "What do you mean?" A chill flashed in Katelyn's eyes. "You're going to visit Verena, too."

At the mention of Verena, Kaia stiffened, eyes narrowing. "Why/should I bother facing her? You just want to give her a chance to make fun of mne?"

Katelyn kept her voice steady. "Relax. Listen to what I'm saying. Go apologize for everything that's happened and see if you can patch things up with her."

Kaia let her frustration show. "We can't even get through a basic conversation without fighting. How am I supposed to make friends with her? Can't we try something else?"

A sharp look flashed across Katelyn's face. "Do you really not get it? Winning her trust is the only way we'll get the upper hand."

Kaia's shoulders dropped as she mulled it over. "She's smart, you know. There's no way she'd just fall for it and trust me that easily."

A sly grin spread on Katelyn's lips. "That's exactly what I'm hoping for."

Confusion pulled Kaia's brows together. "What are you getting at?"

Katelyn's tone turned playful. "Go to Verena and play the victim. Make sure there are people watching, too.If you beg for forgiveness and she brushes you off, everyone else will think she's the unreasonable one. Her image will take the hit, not yours. Danica might not step into every squabble, but she's big on fairness. Once word gets around, she'll see things my way and back me up."

Turning her gaze to the window, Katelyn's lips curled in a satisfied smirk.

She knew all too well that the Bennett family had strict expectations. In a family like theirs, a daughter-in-law tainted by even a hint of scandal would never be welcome.
###Chapter 132 Realized Her Mistakes


Once the plan wrapped up, Katelyn led Kaia to the car and leaned close. "I want you to avoid any unnecessary trouble. The driver will drop you off inthe city center. He'll hand you the cash there, and you can catch a cab the rest of the way home."

Without a word, the driver swept open the rear door. Kaia slid inside and offered a nod. "Understood. That makes sense."

Just as the car was about to pull away,Katelyn stepped up to the open window, concern etched on her face."Kaia, don't rush into anything. I need you to be careful and think every decision through."

Kaia's lips curled into a faint smile as she met Katelyn's eyes. "You can trust me. I know exactly what's at stake. I'm not the same person I was before."

With their exchange finished, Kaia pressed the button to close the window. The vehicle eased away from the curb, soon vanishing down the avenue.

Reaching the city's heart, the driver eased the car to a stop by the roadside. He passed the envelope of bills to Kaia, who stepped out, and then made her way across the street, flagging down a waiting taxi.

Her journey ended at Willis Villa. Before she got out, Kaia paused for a moment to gather herself. She paid the driver, and then stepped into the sunlight.

Out front, the maid, Kylee Cooper, stood snipping branches, but the sight of Kaia stepping from the cab stopped her cold. After a stunned heartbeat, Kylee rushed over, tears bright in her eyes.

"Miss Willis, you've finally come home!" Kylee's voice trembled. "Since you vanished, everyone's been searching for you. Mrs. Willis hasn't slept a full night since. We've all been so worried."

Having watched Kaia grow from childhood, Kylee had carried her absence like a wound. Now relief and heartbreak mingled as she welcomed Kaia back.

Emotions swelled inside Kaia, and her voice caught. "I missed all of you, Kylee.I really did." With trembling hands, Kylee dabbed at her tears, nodding over and over. "I can't tell you how happy I am to see you safe. It's good to have you home."

Kaia cast a look toward the silent living room before lowering her voice. "Kylee, where are my parents? And Luka?"

"They're not home at the moment," said Kylee softly. "Your parents had to go to the company, and Luka has something at school. Why don't you come in and rest while you wait for them?"

Kylee reached out, intending to usher her inside. To her surprise, Kaia hesitated and pulled her hand free.

A flicker of concern passed over Kylee's face. "Is somethingthe matter, Miss Willis?"

Kaia's gaze dropped as she recalled Katelyn's words.

A single goal carried her home. She needed Alec and Laura to forgive her.

If she made it through the door like nothing happened, Laura would show her some compassion, but Alec's quick temper would almost certainly mean she'd face his anger and a long lecture about her foolishness.

Thinking back on Katelyn's advice, Kaia realized she needed to look as helpless as possible.

So, she stepped back, refusing to meet Kylee's eyes, and shook her head. "Kylee, I don't deserve to walk inside. I messed up. I'll wait righthere uuntil my parents come home."

A worried frown creased Kylee's brow as she reached for Kaia's arm. "You can't stay out here, not with night coming on. You'll get sick."

Without another word, Kaia slipped from Kylee's grasp and dropped to her knees on the walkway.

Startled, Kylee blurted out, "Miss Willis, why are you kneeling?"

Hot tears spilled over Kaia's cheeks as she begged, "I won't move until my parents come back and forgive me. Please, Kylee, just let me stay here."

To anyone watching, Kaia looked every bit the picture of a remorseful daughter. Her fists, hidden at her sides,were balled up tight. From the time she was little, Kaia had never known real discipline. She was always sheltered and never had to humble herself in front of the staff.

Verena's arrival had changed everything. If she hadn't shown up, Kaia would still be living like a little princess, never needing to bow her head.

Kylee's anxiety shot through the roof at the sight. "Oh dear...What do I do?"

An idea struck her, and she quickly fished out her phone, stepping away as she dialed Alec's assistant.

"Mr. Wallace? It's Kylee from the villa. Kaia is here..."

The moment she heard the call, Kaia dipped her head, and a faint, almost hidden smile touched her lips.

Not long after the call ended, Alec's car rolled into the driveway.

The moment the car stopped, Kylee rushed over to greet the couple. "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, thank goodness you're finally home."

Laura barely waited for the car to stop before she rushed out. Spotting Kaia kneeling near the entryway,worry and frustration flashed across her face as she hurried over. She grabbed Kaia's shoulders, her voice trembling. "Where have you been all this time? Do you have any idea how much we searched for you? Not a single day went by when we weren't frantic."

No sooner had the words left Laura's lips than Alec's voice cut through the air from behind. "So, you actually showed your face here?"

With a sharp look in Kaia's direction, Alec strode past without slowing, heading straight for the door.

His tone was as cold as a winter gust, and every word stung as it hung between them.

Realizing he was about to disappear inside, Kaia scrambled to stand. "Dad, wait, please-ouch!"

Her knees buckled, sending her straight back to the ground.

The noise caught Alec's attention, and though he paused, his back remained turned.

A glance at Kaia's bruised knees made Laura's heart clench. She called after him, her voice raw. "Alec, can't you stop for one moment and listen to your daughter?"

Without waiting for a reply, Laura knelt beside Kaia and slipped an arm under her shoulders. "Come on, Kaia.You have to get up."

Seeing that Alec stood rigid, Kaia shook her head. "I can't get up yet. I have to answer for what I've done."

A heavy silence fell before Alec finally turned around, coming to stand before her, hands clasped behind his back. "Alright. Go on. Let's hear what you have to say for yourself."

Staying on her knees, Kaia bit her lower lip so hard her eyes shimmered with tears. Slowly, she lifted her gazeto meet theirs.

Her voice trembled. "Dad, Mom, I'm truly sorry. I should never have done those things."

From the sidelines, Kylee interjected, unable to stay quiet, "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, Kaia has been out here this entire time, kneeling. No matter what I told her, she wouldn't get up. She kept saying she couldn't step inside until you both forgave her."

A mother's instinct kicked in, and Laura's anger faded, replaced by a deep ache for her daughter.Seeing Kaia so broken, tears streaking down her cheeks, Laura gathered her up in a fierce embrace.

She whispered, "That's enough now. I'm just glad you see your mistakes. Come, let's get you inside."

No sooner had Laura spoken than Alec cast his gaze down on Kaia,his voice laced with skepticism. "Is that so? Suddenly you're ready to admit you were wrong? I figured you'd been off somewhere, not giving us a single thought."

That biting edge in Alec's voice made it clear his anger had not faded.

With a gentle but determined motion, Kaia freed herself from Laura's hold and met her father's gaze. "I know you're angry, Dad. Honestly, just being allowed back here is more than I hoped for. I kept thinking I'd never have the chance to see you both again."

Frowning, Alec looked confused for a moment, Laura leaned forward and asked, "Why did you think you wouldn't see us anymore?" Taking a steadying breath, Kaia finally answered, "A sudden storm came thenight I left, and I lost all sense of direction. After wandering around in circles, I finally collapsed by the roadside. My next memory was waking up in a cramped, unfamiliar space. Darkness and fear pressed in on me, and I truly believed that was it. Only when the person who took me left me unattended did I manage to slip out and escape."

Carefully,Kaia watched both of her parents to see how they would react to her story.

Laura's eyes filled with tears, and Alec's face tightened with concern.

Clearly, her words had reached them.

Tears began streaming down Kaia's face as she continued, "I was completely lost, with nothing and no one to help me. My phone had disappeared, so I couldn't even try to reach you. I walked for hours, eating whatever scraps I could find, hoping I might stumble across something familiar. Eventually, I reached the city, but I had no money left. A girl I'd never met took pity on me and gave me taxi fare so I could come home.Going through all of that made me see how foolish I'd been. All my life,you protected me from any real hardship. Verena spent her childhood shouldering responsibility, taking care of Grandma out in the countryside.When Grandma died, Verena finally came here to live with us, but I was too jealous of your attention and let it make me act horribly toward her. Everything I did to her, I regret now."

Sobs wracked Kaia until she struggled to breathe.

Clutching Alec's trousers, she loøked up through her tears and pleaded, "Dad, I swear I'll never hurt Verena again. Please, I want youto forgive me. I'll make it right, I promise."

A downward glance from Alec showed a trace of inner conflict; his jaw tightened, yet the anger in his eyes faded, though he said nothing in return.

All the while, Laura couldn't hold back her own tears.

To see her daughter suffer such hardship was a pain Laura had never imagined she would feel.

Laura shoved Alec lightly and cried out through her tears, "Alec, you claimed she was out there enjoying herself, yet you were the one who cut off every bit of her financial support. How could she possibly live that kind of life? Didn't you hear what happened? Kaia was kidnapped and barely made it back alive. She realizes her mistakes now; her knees are raw from kneeling, and you still refuse to forgive her? She's your own daughter by blood. Doesn't that mean anything to you?"

A heavy silence hung in the air after Laura finished speaking, and Alec couldn't help but steal a glance at Kaia as her sobs echoed around them.

His heart tightened; any father would feel moved seeing his own child so broken, especially when her remorse was so raw and honest.

Lowering himself beside her, Alec placed a firm hand on her shoulder and spoke quietly. "If you truly want to make things right, you'll visit Verena tomorrow and apologize to her directly. That's the first step you need to take."
 ###Chapter 133 I'm Not Holding You Back


Not once in the past would Kaia have even considered offering Verena an apology just because Alec asked her to.

Times had changed, though; now she would have gone to Verena on her own, with or without her father's request.

Relying on Alec for support, Kaia rose to her feet, wiped away her tears, and managed a shaky nod. "Dad, I know how much damage l've done. The guilt is all mine. Whether Verena forgives me or not, I'll go to her and apologize from the heart. I promise."

A new maturity caught Alec's eye as he studied Kaia-her time away had changed her, and relief flooded him.

His hand landed gently on her shoulder. "You shouldn't be standing out here. Go on in and change. Luka will be home soon, and we'll finally share a meal as a family."

Inside the house, Kaia climbed the stairs to change. Luka's arrival in the living room happened just as she came back down.

The school event had just ended for Luka when a call from Kylee let him know Kaia had come home, so he'd rushed out, grabbed a taxi, and hurried back.

Pure happiness lit up his face when he spotted his sister. "You're home, Kaia! I've missed you."

A quick hug passed between them. Luka pulled back, frowning in confusion. "Kaia, I tried calling your friends, but nobody had any idea where you were. What happened?"

Hesitation crept in before Kaia answered, repeating the same story she had told their parents earlier.

Luka listened, concern written across his face, while Laura's eyes glistened with fresh tears.

Picking up on the heaviness in the room, Alec lowered his newspaper and tried to bring comfort. "What matters is that Kaia's safe. Let's have dinner."
Later, Kaia retreated to her bedroom for a shower.
The moment she was alone, she retrieved her hidden phone and typed out a quick message to Katelyn."Everything went as planned. I'll talk to Verena tomorrow."
Katelyn's reply arrived almost instantly. "Nice job."
A smile played on Kaia's lips at the praise.
The following day, while Verena was in the middle of her workout in the home gym, Rhonda came by to let her know that Kaia had come to visit her.
Verena arched her brow in surprise. "Kaia? I thought Luka mentioned she'd gone missing?"
A quick tap switched off the treadmill, and Verena accepted the towel Rhonda handed her, dabbing at the sweat on her neck.
Instructions came without hesitation. "Let her know l'm occupied. She'll have to wait."
Rhonda offered a respectful nod and made her way out of the gym.
Downstairs, she approached Kaia, who lounged on the sofa. "Mrs. Bennett is busy at the moment, Miss Willis. She'll see you shortly."
Waiting didn't rattle Kaia in the least; she had expected to be put off. Instead, she smiled with easy politeness. "That's perfectly fine. I'll just wait here."
Eventually, Verena wrapped up her workout, enjoyed a long, unhurried shower, and at last strolled into the living room, arms folded, voice breezy. "Hope you weren't too bored waiting."
As Verena drew near, Kaia bounced up and slipped her arm through Verena's, her voice sugar-sweet and eyes bright. "Come on, Verena, I'm your little sister! Waiting for you is never a bother. Don't be so formal with me."
That syrupy tone made Verena inwardly cringe. She studied Kaia for a beat before quietly pulling away. "Let's not drag this out. Why did you come?"

Kaia either didn't notice the chill or pretended not to. With a cheerful flourish, she started opening up the neatly stacked gift boxes on the table. "Take a look at these, Verena. See anything you like?"

First, she displayed a khaki coat, holding it up for inspection. "I always see you in lighter colors. This one should suit you, don't you think?"

Switching gears, she set down the coat and picked up a sleek black knit sweater. "This would be perfect for spring-stylish and cozy. With your gorgeous features and that figure, you'll pull it off so elegantly."

A playful energy lit up Kaia's face as she introduced each item, her smile the picture of innocent enthusiasm -a bubbly, girl-next-door vibe that would've fooled almost anyone.

Anyone unfamiliar with Kaia's true self might have believed the act.

Hidden motives, Verena reminded herself, often wore the mask of kindness.

Never for a second did she think Kaia had come just to deliver presents.

Anyone who knew the old Kaia would have expected a dramatic outburst by now after the long wait.

Watching her act sweet and gentle felt completely out of character.

A sharp,unimpressed glance from Verena cut through the air. "Kaia, let's not pretend. I don't have time for your little charades. We're hardly close."

A flicker of hurt froze Kaia's smile before she forced a strained grin. "You've made it clear you don't like me,Verena, but I still need to say this."

Tears threatened as she bit her lip, meeting Verena's gaze. "I owe you an apology for everything. I'm sorry."

Mockery crept into Verena's voice, a soft chuckle escaping her. "Did you really just apologize? You, of all people?"

A small, nervous nod followed as Kaia twisted her hands together. "I mean every word. I've had time to think about all the ways I wronged you. We're sisters. Blood should matter most, but I kept hurting you. Sometimes I just want to slap myself for it..."

With an indifferent shrug, Verena raised her eyebrows. "Well, nothing's stopping you. If that's what you want,go ahead."

Confusion flickered across Kaia's face. "What are you saying?"

An almost teasing glint lit Verena's eyes. "You said you want to slap yourself. So do it. I'm not holding you back."

Those words cut deep, and Kaia's confidence wavered as Verena's gaze bored into her.

No matter how humble she tried to seem, Verena offered nothing but cold indifference-even now, after Kaia dragged herself here to apologize.

Swallowing her pride felt unbearable, and if not for Evelyn's plan, she would have never tolerated such humiliation.

Beneath her calm, resentment simmered, but Kaia kept her composure.

She understood she couldn't afford to disappoint Evelyn, especially when this was their one opportunity to bring Verena down.

When it came to their bigger plar, letting go of her pride felt like a price she was willing to pay.

Wiping away tears, Kaia managed a trembling nod. "If that's what it takes for you to forgive me, Verena, I'll keep going until you believe me."

A sharp slap echoed as she brought her hand down across her cheek.

She didn't stop there.

Another resounding smack left her skin bright red, the sound harsh in the silent room, each blow sending new tears down her face.

No reaction came from Verena, who simply stood by, arms folded and gaze steady, refusing to give in to Kaia's display. Crying rarely moved Verena, especially not when she suspected the motives behind the person who tried to harm her.

Still, she couldn't help but wonder what Kaia's endgame was.

Change didn't happen overnight, and Verena was far from convinced that Kaia's remorse was genuine.

Her time away-who had she spoken to, and what advice had she been given?

Verena never trusted the idea of chance.With Katelyn showing up to stir trouble and Kaia suddenly shifting her behavior, she was certain the timing wasn't accidental.

If the two of them were working together, Verena wanted to uncover exactly what they were plotting.

Rather than sit back and wait for Kaia to make the first move, she chose to keep watch and see what kind of tricks Kaia might pull.

It also gave her a way to test if Kaia had truly matured.

Verena said, "That's enough. Stop right there."

Kaia froze at her words, her eyes darting toward Verena with unease.

Verena gave her a gentle smile. "You're right. We're sistes, and family ties will always matter most. You've apologized, and as your sister, I'd be wrong not to forgive you."
###Chapter 134 Let Her Act As Bait


Nothing about Verena's response was what Kaia expected. She stood there, stunned into silence, unable to come up with anything to say.

Forgiveness seemed far too simple after all the things she had done to Verena.

With Kaia lost in her own thoughts, Verena let out a light laugh. "You came here for my forgiveness,didn't you? Now that you have it, you look almost disappointed."

Disappointment wasn't the emotion Kaia felt. She was simply shocked that Verena would let things go without hesitation. A drawn-out argument was what Kaia had prepared herself for.

Truthfully, her visit was never about making amends. She hoped Verena would lash out, just to prove a point.

Snapping back, Kaia spoke, forcing herself to stay composed. "You got it wrong, Verena. I'm truly grateful.Thank you for forgiving me."

That answer only made Verena smile more. "If you're happy, that's good enough for me. You do seem distracted, though. Is something on your mind?"

Trying to hide her unease, Kaia managed a quick grin. "There's nothing to worry about. I've just been through a lot, so sometimes I drift off."

"That makes sense," Verena said with a small nod. "Take care of yourself, alright? Right now, our family means everything to me-Mom,Dad,Luka,and you."

With a seemingly affectionate pat on Kaia's shoulder, Verena added, "Even if our parents and Luka have their opinions about me, you're still here. I'm glad you're willing to admit your mistakes."

Kaia found Verena's act as the caring older sister almost unbearable but kept her expression warm. "Don't say that, Verena. We're still family, no matter what happens. I'm sure Mom, Dad, and Luka feel the same way." Verena thought it was almost a shame that Kaia didn't put her talent for pretending to better use.

She had no interest in whatever their parents or Luka might think.

A nod was all she offered.

With her plan having gone nowhere, Kaia saw no point in lingering. "I should head back to campus. I'll drop by again soon."

A faint smile lingered on Verena's lips as she gave a silent nod.

After Kaia disappeared from the entryway, Verena wandered overto the expansive window, folded her arms,and followed Kaia's movements with a watchful gaze. Fishing her phone from her pocket,she placed a call without hesitation.

Gavin's uncertain greeting broke the quiet. "Eve-Dr. Willis, is there something you need?"

He nearly called her Evelyn, but quickly corrected himself.

Verena said, "Gavin, I have a favor to ask."

No hesitation from Gavin this time. "Of course. What can I do?"

Eyes still on Kaia slipping into her car, Verena's tone was measured. "I want you to find out who Kaia has been spending time with. Keep tabs on her for a while."

Why would Kaia need that sort of attention? Gavin's confusion was clear. Surveillance seemed like overkill-what had Kaia done?

He finally voiced his doubts. "Did something happen with Kaia?"

With a cold, steady tone, Verena explained, "She's always gone out of her way to make things hard for me.Now, suddenly, she's full of apologies after disappearing for a while. That doesn't make sense. Someone must be working with her."

Gavin suddenly thought of a possibility. Worried, he asked, "Do you think those people from overseas are using Kaia to get at you?" Verena brushed the thought aside. "That's not likely. People like that wouldn't choose just anyone. And if they had any idea about my real background, they wouldn't have any reason to involve Kaia."

She paused, eyes narrowed in thought. "Right now, I'm not sure where those people are hiding, but I expect them to show themselves before long. For now, Kala could be involved with Katelyn Fuller."

The name caught Gavin off guard. "Katelyn Fuller... I remember now. There was that headline-something about her having a mysterious overseas identity. Some even thought she might be Evelyn. What's Kaia's connection to her?"

A sly gin played on Verena's lips as she answered in an easy tone, "I wish I knew myself.Katelyn has known Isaac since they were kids. Yesterday, she approached me, dropped hints about being Evelyn, and tried to snatch Isaac's case away from me. I shut her down. Then this morning, out of nowhere, Kaia arrives,all apologetic. Put together, the timing feels way too convenient to be a coincidence."

There was a sharp edge of realization in Gavin's voice. "Understood, Dr. Willis. I'll have someone keep an eye on Kaia and report back if anything unusual happens. But there's something else I almost forgot to tell you. When I tried calling you earlier, you didn't answer, and I never followed up. Because of that news article about Katelyn, word is spreading that two different groups are after you now. One of them has even hired hitmen.Please be careful, Dr. Willis."

Resting her weight against the glass, Verena replied, "Understood. These groups stay in the shadows. Since Katelyn's eager to pretend she's Evelyn, I'll let her act as bait-maybe it'll draw them out where I can see them. I need to use this chance to figure out who's behind everything."

"That makes sense. I'm relieved you're ready."

"There's one more thing," Verena added. "I'm not able to leave for now, so I want the medical team brought back here from overseas."

Surprise flickered in Gavin's voice. "You're taIking about relocating the entire hospital staff? Wouldn't that make your situation more dangerous? Most of your resources are abroad-here, you have far fewer allies.Are you sure this is wise?"

Verena let out a soft laugh. "That's not your concern. I'll let Katelyn stir up those two groups and deal with whatever comes out of hiding. This way, I'm not alone in the spotlight. The medical team will just be on standby. I won't reopen the hospital until things settle down."

Seeing howw detailed her plan was, Gavin's concerns eased. "Alright, I'll start the arrangements."

"Thank you," Verena replied with a nod.

Shortly after the call ended, Rhonda appeared and asked politely, "Mrs. Bennett, where should I put what Miss Willis delivered?"

Waving it off, Verena answered, "Just store everything in the storage room."

...

Elsewhere, Kaia pulled out of Seraphina Villas and dialed Katelyn from the car.

Once the line connected, Kaia wasted no time. "Katelyn, things didn't go our way."

Katelyn's brow furrowed on the other end. "Tell me what happened."

A memory of the morning's awkwardness crossed Kaia's mind. "I tried to follow the plan-I apologized to Verena first thing. I was sure she'd never forgive me, not after everything I did. But strangely enough, she didn't get upset at all. WVith just a few words, she let it go."

Katelyn sounded unconvinced. "That's all it took? She just forgave you?"

Kaia confirmed, "Yeah, just like that."
###Chapter 135 A Threat


Katelyn stayed silent on the line, her mind turning over carefully.

Their last meeting had shown her that Verena was far more complex than she had first assumed.

Under usual circumstances, Verena would never have let Kaia off so quickly.

From what she sensed, Verena clearly doubted Kaia's true intentions.

Breaking her silence at last, Katelyn said to Kaia, "I understand you. For now, keep patient. Wait for me to reach out, and don't try to come see me until then."

Once the call ended, she turned her eyes toward the butler. "Have all my instructions been carried out?"

He bowed his head in confirmation. "Yes, Miss Fuller. Everything has been arranged. Yesterday, I sent an invitation to Professor Branson on your behalf, presenting you as the esteemed surgeon from Cloverland Hospital in Clokron. This morning, I received his reply-he will meet you at the Fortune Garden Restaurant at noon."

Katelyn's lips curved with satisfaction. "Excellent."

Glancing at the clock, she strode toward the walk-in closet. "Get the car ready," she said. "I'll change quickly.I intend to be early."

The butler responded firmly, "Yes." He then turned to head downstairs.

By the time she reached the restaurant, Katelyn was a full thirty minutes ahead of schedule.

The butler had secured a private suite, discreet and soundproof, chosen to ensure no conversation could slip beyond its walls.

Exactly on time, Wendell stepped into the restaurant.

Spotting her already seated, he offered a polite apology. "Dr. Fuller, forgive me. University matters delayed me until just now."

She rose to greet him, her smile warm and deferential. "Professor Branson, as a fellow doctor, I consider it a privilege to meet you. Even if I had to wait all day, it would be worth it."

With a modest wave of his hand, Wendell replied, "You flatter me, Dr. Fuller. Age alone doesn't make me greater, and my skills may not outshine yours."

Her smile lingered as she motioned to the chair across from her. "Sit, please."

Once he was seated, she reached for the bottle and filled his glass before serving her own.

Lifting her glass, she remarked, "Professor Branson, your work has always inspired me, yet you've graciously agreed to meet someone like me, who has barely scratched the surface of medicine. I'm deeply grateful.Let me drink to you-and to our profession!"

Without hesitation, Katelyn tipped back her glass and drained it in a single motion.

Placing his hands firmly on his knees, Wendell shook his head. "Dr. Fuller, I came here because I know of your accomplishments. We're both servants of medicine, both willing to give of ourselves for it. Don't sell yourself short."

When the invitation reached him the day before, Wendell noticed it bore Katelyn's name, a doctor with weighty reputation abroad. Because he treasured connections with colleagues in his field, he had answered without hesitation.

Remembering this, Wendell smiled warmly and lifted his glass."It's rare to find someone who burns with the same devotion. To our calling in medicine!"

Watching him empty his glass, Katelyn arched her brows ever so slightly.

The impression she gathered was clear-Wendell would not be hard to handle.

Once the glasses were lowered, the table quickly filled with dish after dish.

Patience guided her this time; even halfway through the meal she kept her true agenda hidden. Instead,she steered the conversation toward lighter subjects, and their exchange remnained cordial. Only after Wendell placed his knife and fork neatly aside did Katelyn drop her question with practiced ease.She asked, "Professor Branson, I heard from a friend that you're acquainted with Evelyn?"

Unaware of her intent, Wendell dabbed his mouth with a napkin. "That's right. We collaborated some time ago."

Her brows knitted together for the briefest moment before smoothing again.

That was enough to confirm Kaia's words held weight.

Katelyn pretended to be astonished, her eyes widening before she allowed admiration to soften her expression. A faint blush rose to her cheeks. "Truly? Evelyn has been my idol for years. She inspired me to follow this path in medicine. I admire her so much. Professor Branson, could you... perhaps help me get her autograph?"

The request seemed simple enough. Wendell gave a nod. "Of course. When I see her again, I'll bring it back for you."

Her face lit up with delight. "That's amazing. Thank you, Professor Branson."

When her words were done, she dipped her head, letting a troubled look cross her face.

Noticing her sudden shift, Wendell leaned in. "Dr. Fuller, is something troubling you?"

Raising her eyes slowly, Katelyn spoke with careful softness. "Professor Branson, may I ask a favor of you?"

Wendell had carried the same generous spirit from his younger days into his old age, never losing his kindness. "If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask."

Catching a glimmer of opportunity, Katelyn steadied her expression. "The truth is, I'm facing a case that has left me completely at a loss. I've tried everything, yet I can't find a viable treatment. Because you know Evelyn, I was hoping you could arrange for me to meet her."

At her request, Wendell exhaled slowly, his face clouded with unease.

He recalled how he had recently reached out to Evelyn himself, inviting her to deliver a lecture at Acorith College of Medicine. Her response had been polite but firm-she was occupied and unable to attend, forcing the event to be delayed.

Shaking his head, Wendell explained, "Dr. Fuller, I'd gladly help if I could. But Evelyn keeps her life tightly guarded. She avoids attention and rarely reveals her location. I'm afraid arranging a meeting simply isn't possible."

Seeing the shadow of disappointment on her face, Wendell suggested, "Perhaps this instead-share the patient's details with me, and I'll forward them to Evelyn. Once she replies, I'll make sure you're informed."

From that reassurance,Katelyn knew with certainty that Wendell truly did have contact with Evelyn.

As a celebrated professor in Shoildon, Wendell had neither motive nor reason to invent such a story.

Rather than answering, Katelyn slipped a hand into her purse, drew out a check, and slid it across the table.

Perplexed by the gesture, Wendell frowned at the check. "Why are you giving me-"

Cutting him off, Katelyn said coldly, "I take it that you've seen Evelyn in person. Professor Branson,I need something unusual from you."

With a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, she continued, "There's a patient I wish to treat, but unless they believe I am Evelyn, I won't be accepted as their doctor."

Her words made Wendell narrowthis eyes, suspicion hardening his gaze.

Speaking as though it were a small matter, Katelyn added, "Since Evelyn avoids the public, I need you to vouch for me, telling the patient's family that I am Evelyn herself."

Staring at her in shock, Wendell stammered, "What on earth are you asking of me?"

Her smile never wavered. "Don't worry. The truth will come out in time. I don't mean to steal Evelyn's identity forever-just long enough to win the family's trust."

The moment her words sank in, Wendell's fist struck the table, sending the dishes rattling across the surface.

"So you expect me to lie, to help you pose as Evelyn and trick a patient's family?" His eyes hardened with sudden clarity as he glared at her. "Now i see your reason for this meeting. Hear me, Katelyn Fuller-I'm a man of principle, and I'Il never lower myself to that."

Right and wrong had always been clear lines for Wendell.Feeling utterly betrayed, he jabbed a finger at her."I misjudged you completely. What kind of doctor stoops to this? You stain the very name of medicine."

Through his tirade, Katelyn held her tongue, her calm expression unbroken as she allowed him to rage.

Only when his voice broke into a cough did she finally smile and speak. "'Professor Branson, you may say no,but you should think carefully about what follows."

His palm struck the table once more as he shot to his feet. "Shameless woman! I'll not waste another word on you."

Her voice cut through his fury. "Professor Branson, you have such a beautiful grandson."

That single mention made him freeze. Katelyn's brows lifted as she added smoothly, "He's a precious boy.But accidents happen, don't they? A kidnapping... a sudden crash... or even robbers in the wrong place at the wrong time."

Grinding his teeth, Wendell spun toward her. "This is a nation of law-how dare you try to intimidate me!"

KKatelyn kept her smile, but there was a sharper edge beneath it. "This isn't meant as a threat, Professor Branson. I only want to help you.df you choose to cooperate, your grandson will remain safe, and your family will thrive, living a life of security and respect."
###Chapter 136 Holding The Scalpel With Her Eyes Closed


Wendell narrowed his eyes at Katelyn, unable to believe what he was hearing. "If this isn't a threat, then what is?"

Katelyn lifted her shoulders in an easy shrug, her palms opening wide. "If that'sthe label you want to use,then I won't argue."

Her steady composure only fueled Wendell's anger, his chest rising and falling as his temper spiked. "Do you not realize I could go to the police right now?"

Resting her elbows against the table, Katelyn laced her fingers beneath her chin. "Go ahead, Professor Branson, no one's stopping you. But let's be honest. The police can't shadow your grandson every second of the day. And more importantly, I haven't lifted a finger yet. Even if you file a report, I can laugh it off as a joke. Words don't carry prison sentences."

The moment his grandson entered the conversation, Wendell's weak point was exposed.

His whole body shook with rage, his finger trembling as he jabbed it toward her. He could barely spit out a word."You-"

Amusement flickered in Katelyn's eyes as she watched his face turn crimson. Her lips curved into a sly smile while she poured a stream of wine into his glass.

Glass in hand, she stepped closer, her voice low and deliberate. "Professor Branson,your choices are simple. One road leads to opportunity, the other drags you and your family into ruin."

Without flinching at his hostile glare, Katelyn added, "You're a clever man, Professor Branson. You already know the right answer. You wouldn't really stake your grandson's life on pride, would you?"

The corners of Wendell's mouth tightened as he clamped his lips shut, too furious to speak.

Hatred for her burned inside him, but he also knew she was right-he couldn't afford to gamble. When his silence stretched on, Katelyn's confidence only grew. She could tell he was starting to waver.

Katelyn leaned in, her tone smooth and persuasive. "Professor Branson, I understand your worries.You're afraid I'll hurt the patient, aren't you? But that fear is unnecessary. This patient matters too much to me-l would never lay a hand on him. What I want is to step into Evelyn's role so his family can relax and place their trust in me. I'm not some amateur sneaking in above my pay grade. Cloverland Hospital doesn't accept anyone but the best. The only problem here is that the patient's family needs reassurance, and the quickest way to calm them is with a title they'll respect."

She added, "Professor Branson, what I need from you is simple. Stand behind me. If you do that, your grandson stays safe, and your son's and daughter-in-law's futures remain bright. Everyone gains something -your family prospers, my goal is met, and no one suffers. Can you really call that anything but a win for both of us? And if you're still uncertain, then I'll stake my entire career on this, swearing to you that no one will be harmed."

Holding out the glass of wine, Katelyn's voice softened. "Professor Branson, the longer you hesitate, the harder it becomes. Make the choice now."

Wendell's fists curled tightly at his sides, the battle in his chest twisting him in knots.

Regret pressed down on him; had he known Katelyn's true purpose, he never would have shown up.

Fear for himself meant nothing, but the thought of his grandson caught in the crossfire hollowed him out.

He knew this mess was of his own making, yet dragging his grandson into danger was unthinkable.

For a long moment, he shut his eyes, his entire body sagging as though the fight had drained from him.
When they opened again, resignation dulled his gaze.

A weary nod followed, his voice rough. "Alright. I'll go along with it."

Katelyn lifted the glass with a faint smile. "Professor Branson, you've proven yourself a man of foresight. For that,I'll drink to you."

Wendell's eyes flicked to the wine, and then back to her face, cold and unyielding. His expression carried nowarmth as he sneered, "Don't flatter yourself. I'm only agreeing because I have no other option, not because I care to deal with the likes of you."

Without waiting for her response, he spun around and marched out of the room.

As the private room door slammed shut behind him, Katelyn's grin slipped away. She turned around and tipped the wine into the trash, her gaze turning distant.

At Seraphina Villas, after handling her overseas calls, Verena slipped into the medical room to continue her surgical training.

Her hands had trembled so violently during her first try to hold a scalpel again that she had forced herself into near-daily practice, sometimes repeating the same procedure twice.

Still, the shaking never left.

Every time the blade touched the small body of a lab rat, her fingers quivered and her knees weakened until she thought she might collapse.

Once more, she stepped into the sterile surgical area.

A rat was placed onto the operating table, and she carefully moved through the motions-washing her hands, disinfecting, pulling on the gown, and slipping into sterile gloves.

When she finally reached for the scalpel resting on the tray, a chill seeped straight through the glove, racing up her arm and tightening her chest as her pulse quickened.

The trembling returned to her hands, ligh at first, and then harder to ignore.

A dry lump caught in Verena's throat, and she forced herself to swallow.

The rat on the table lay motionless under anesthesia, and she pressed her fingertip against its small abdomen as if staking her resolve, shutting her eyes tightly.

Since watching the blade only made her quiver, she decided to block out the sight altogether, letting her fingers map out the organs and limbs by feel. For most surgeons, that approach would have been reckless, maybe even impossible.

To Verena, however, it was second nature.

On a human body, she could recognize every detail blindfolded, trusting her sense of touch alone.

That was why people whispered the name Legendary Surgeon when speaking of her.

Instead of staring at the scalpel, she deliberately let her eyes close, surrendering to instinct.

Her heartbeat evened out in her chest, and the twitch in her grip eased until her hand finally stilled. The panic that had plagued her began to fade.

Relief softened her expression, and a small smile tugged at her lips as the tension slipped away.

With her eyelids shut, she guided the scalpel to the precise spot beneath her figertip and drew the first incision.

Without the interference of shaking, the procedure moved along cleanly, almost effortless.

Still,she reminded herself that this was only practice. In a real operating room, closing her eyes would never be an option.

Determined to face the fear head-on, she halted mid-procedure, opened her eyes slowly, and locked her gaze on the work in front of her.

Rather than let the trembling return, she forced herself to press on with the operation.

Deep, steady breaths filled Verena's lungs as she tried to anchor her nerves.

When the operation was nearly finished, she thought the worst was behind her, yet the shaking crept back into her hands.

This time the tremor wasn't overwhelming-it was mild, irritating but still controllable.

Her fingers clamped down on the scalpel, and for a few precious moments, the movement stilled.

She pushed through the final steps, cutting with precision before closing the incision with quick stitches. What should have been a short dissection stretched into what felt like an eternity.

Relief washed over her when she finally looked at the rat, its small body neatly sewn.

The stitches were clean and straight, a sharp contrast to the crooked lines of her earlier attempts.

For the first time in days, Verena felt a spark of pride-this was her best result yet.

The strategy of calming herself by starting with closed eyes had worked, proving she was finally making progress.
###Chapter 137 Good News


Verena realized that if she shut her eyes and opened them again after a while, her confidence would steady her hands, and the nerves would fade away.

But that sense of control lasted just long enough for simpler operations. She quickly realized she needed far more experience to handle complex procedures.

Determined to improve, Verena dove into one surgical practice after another.

Progress came with every attempt.

By sticking to her rigorous daily routine, she became certain that soon she would be ready to operate on Isaac herself.

The possibility filled her with excitement.

As twilight settled over the house and Isaac wheeled himself through the door, Verena hurried to share the good news with him.

Looking into her eyes, Isaac caught the glow of her happiness, and a gentle warmth spread through his chest.

He was fully aware of the dedication Verena poured into overcoming her trembling hands, driven by her determination to be the one who could help him heal.

Rhonda had told himn many times how Verena would lose herself in surgical practice for hours, sometimes working right through meals. At night, Isaac often found her surrounded by medical books at her desk,studying late into the evening before finally resting.

Since their wedding, she seemed to have grown a little thinner, proof of just how committed she was to his recovery.

The thought tugged at Isaac's heart. He reached out and brushed her cheek softly. "I owe you so much,
Verena. I'm grateful, and I'm sorry for making you carry this burden."
Verena placed her hand on his. "You don't need to thank me, not in this house. We promised to stay together through everything. If you keep making it sound like we're strangers, I'll start to get upset."
Isaac's eyes softened at her words, and he instinctively took her hand, pressing a gentle kiss to her skin.His reply was calm and full of affection. "Alright, I'll do as you say."
With a gentle, satisfied smile, Verena asked, "Would you like me to help you upstairs for your treatment?"
Isaac gave a small nod, and Verena carefully wheeled him into the elevator.
As soon as they reached the second floor, she guided him into the medical room without delay.
The approach to the treatment remained unchanged from before.
After Isaac slipped off the last piece of his dark gray boxer briefs, Verena carefully spread the prepared liquid medicine across his abdomen and waited for it to work.
She sat in the chair at his bedside, notebook and pen in hand, poised to track even the slightest change in his condition.
Within moments, the liquid medicine started to take effect.
A faint ache spread through Isaac's legs, accompanied by an intense heat building in his lower groin.
Clenching his jaw, he bent forward, sweat gathering on his brow and sliding down his sharp jawline to pool on his firm stomach.
Verena kept a close watch, documenting every shift she noticed in his body, especially the visible changes in his lower region. She made sure to note the time and wrote detailed observations in her notebook.
Looking over her earlier notes, she quickly realized that tonight's progress was more significant than before.
Seeing Verena's gaze fixed on the notebook, her expression distant, Isaac grew uneasy and asked, "What is it? Is my condition not getting better?"
Pulled from her thoughts, Verena lifted her gaze to Isaac, a bright smile spreading across her face. "I have good news. I compared the notes with your earlier records, and it turns out you've already made significant progress."

For a moment, Isaac could only stare, his surprise plain on his face. "You mean it? Are you sure?"

A playful spark danced in Verena's eyes. "What, you think I'd make that up?"

He was quick to shake his head. "No, it's not that. I trust you."

His voice dropped, softer now. "It's myself I have trouble trusting."

The countless failed treatments and disappointing doctor visits had left their scars.
###Chapter 138 Do You Like What You See


When Verena told him that the condition he thought was hopeless had made significant progress, Isaac almost couldn't believe her.

The idea that he could enjoy intimacy again felt almost too good to be true.

What stunned him even more was the chance that the very affliction that had brought him endless shame could actually heal.

Just as his doubts began creeping back, Verena reached over and messed up his hair with a smile. "Isaac,we need to keep believing in ourselves and in each other. I know your illness isn't simple,but if we take it step by step, things will change. Think about it-you once thought you'd never improve,yet every day of this treatment has proven otherwise. Stay strong for me, will you? Promise me. I'll make sure you reclaim everything you've lost, and when the time comes, your legs will carry you again."

When he looked into her calm and tender eyes, Isaac felt a safety he had never known before, as though something inside him finally settled.

There was something almost magical about her, a quiet force that always stilled the storms raging inside him.

Letting her hand linger in his hair, Isaac gave a small nod. "I promise."

The words came out in a low, alost fragile tone, and his helpless surrender only made him all the more endearing.

Verena couldn't help herself. She mussed his hair again and laughed. "That's what I wanted to hear. Good boy."

Isaac gazed at her in silence, and his eyes glowed with a love too deep for words.

When the session was finished, the two of them headed back to the bedroom. Once he finished his shower, she guided him carefully to the bed and made sure he was comfortable.

As she pulled the covers over him, her eyes paused for a moment on the lower part of his body.

During the earlier application of the medicine, she had spotted noticeable improvements in that area, signs that gave her quiet hope.

Even so, she knew the progress was owed to the medicine's effect rather than a natural recovery.

Verena was curious whether his bodywould still respond naturally to intimacy without the push of treatment or medicine.

Keeping that thought in mind, she pulled the blanket up over him and quietly slipped into the bathroom.

When she finished showering, her eyes fell on her lifeless pajamas, and with a small frown,she tapped her chin,thinking.

Clearly, those wouldn't do.

An idea sparked, and still wrapped in a towel, she made her way straight to the closet.

Inside, the wide closet revealed more of her clothes than Isaac's. What little space lsaac had on the right side had already been invaded by her wardrobe, while the left remained entirely hers.

Kneeling before the lower section, she tugged out something hidden beneath Isaac's side of the closet.

Back in the bathroom, she carefully spread the fabric open in her hands.

What she held was a black satin nightgown, its smooth surface shning with elegance. Lace traced the neckline, and thin straps ran delicately over the shoulders.

Though stunning, it looked delicate, as if one careless pull might rip it apart.

She remembered Miranda pressing it into her hands the night before the wedding,teasing with a wicked grin that she should save it for when Isaac was well again.

Never had she imagined she'd be reaching for it this soon. Snapping out of her thoughts, she gave her head a quick shake, slipped into the nightgown, and stepped out of the bathroom.

Isaac had been listening to the bathroom door creak open and shut, his curiosity building with each sound.When footsteps finally approached, he glanced up-and his lips parted in stunned silence.

Standing before him was Verena, her figure wrapped in the nightgown that ended high above her thighs.Her flawless legs seemed endless, and her smooth shoulders glowed against the thin black straps.

The gown revealed her elegant collarbones, and the skin beneath looked impossibly smooth.

A lump caught in his throat as his eyes grew heavy with emotion. "Why...why are you dressed like that?" he asked, his voice strained.

With a playful tilt of her head and a soft smile, Verena leaned closer. "Don't you think it looks good on me?"

The boldness of her words brought a flush to his cheeks. "I... I don't know what to say."

Watching him stumble over his words, Verena's lips curved into a sly smile. She climbed onto the bed,settled beside him, and wrapped her arms around him in one smooth motion.

Her eyes caught Isaac's, and with a daring softness, she asked, "Be honest. Do you like what you see?"

Fresh from her shower, her fragrance surrounded him so thickly it made his head swim. His throat worked as if to speak, yet no sound came.

When he stayed silent, Verena tipped forward, refusing to let go of the question. "So? Is it yes or no?"

The shift revealed a sliver of skin just above her neckline, subtle yet impossible to ignore. Heat flashed in Isaac's eyes before he quickly lookedaway.

Clutching the blanket for support, he finally blurted out, "l... I like it."

Her lips brushed close to his ear as she whispered, "If you really mean it, then prove it with a kiss."

The playful lilt in her tone carried both sweetness and mischief, making it hard for him to resist.

The words stunned him at first, but once he gathered himself, he fixed his gaze on her as though she were the only thing in the world.

Her answering smile was steady, her eyes warm enough to quiet his hesitation.

Taking her look as permission, Isaac lifted his hand to the back of her head and crushed his mouth against hers.

Her fingers drifted across his chest and down his stomach, coaxing more from him with each touch.

The weight of his breathing told her everything-he was finally responding.

In her mind, she reasoned that this kind of provocation could only strengthen the treatment's effect.

Acting on that idea, she slipped both hands beneath his pajama shirt.

Her chilled palms pressed against the warmth of his skin, drawing a sharp breath from him.

Half-lidded eyes found her intent expression, and a rush of excitement thudded in his chest.

With his eyes shut, he bent lower, pressing soft kisses along her neck, savoring each one.

What began as feather-light touches quickly turned fevered as his lips trailed across her collarbone.

Catching on to where he was headed, Verena pressed firmly against his shoulders to hold him back.

Frustrated at being stopped, Isaac lifted his gaze, his eyes clouded with wounded longing.

Her cheeks flushed with color as Verena caught her breath. "You're only beginning to heal, Isaac. It's still too soon for that."

Hearing her words, Isaac pulled her close, burying his face against the curve of her neck.

His breathing came unsteady, and though he felt a bit frustrated, joy swelled in his chest.

The fear of losing Verena because of his condition no longer loomed over him.

For the first time, he believed he could be whole again, worthy of standing at her side. Inside a secluded villa overseas, heavy curtains left the wide room in near-blackness despite the daylight.

A sliver of light crept through the window, enough to outline one man seated at the desk and another standing before him, both hidden in shadow.

From behind the desk, the man in the chair spoke lowly. "Have you heard anything about Evelyn?"

The figure standing before him dipped his head. "Nothing certain. But a report in Shoildon hinted at a woman who might have been Evelyn."

He paused briefly, and then continued, "But Evelyn's movements are always impossible to follow. If we can't trace her, how would some gossip reporter succeed? I'd wager it's nothing but a rumor."

The man at the desk gave a measured laugh, his head tilting as he shook it. "True or not, we can't afford to dismiss it. If my brother reaches Evelyn first and secures Grandfather's recovery, then my claim to Smoothdeed Group is finished."
###Chapter 139 Katelyn Visited Again


With Isaac slowly assuming control of Bennett Group, Danica discovered her days carried less strain and far more ease.

On a rare quiet morning, she lounged on the sofa, absentmindedly playing with the cat as the television flickered in the background.

A servantstepped forward and announced, "Mrs. Bennett, Miss Fuller has arrived to see you."

Hearing this, Danica blinked in mild surprise. "Katelyn? She's really here?"

The servant nodded. "Yes, ma'am. Her car is waiting out front."

Danica's hand froze mid-stroke, and a faint crease appeared between her brows.

The purpose was easy enough to guess-Katelyn had already made it plain she wished to take charge of Isaac'streatment.

Danica hadn't dismissed the offer; she'd told Isaac about it the same day, only for him to refuse outright with unshakable certainty.

To her surprise, days passed and yet Katelyn still pressed on.

The woman's persistence was nothing short of stubborn.

Helplessness settled over her, for it was clear Isaac had no desire whatsoever to let Katelyn take control of his care.

Still, the long-standing bond between the Fullers and Bennetts meant she had no choice but to receive Katelyn politely.

Letting out a quiet sigh, Danica switched off the television, passed the cat into the servant's arms, and said,"Take it back to the cat house, and then show Miss Fuller inside." Cradling the cat carefully, the servant bowed. "Yes, Mrs. Bennett."

Once the cat was taken care of, the servant stepped outside to welcome Katelyn.

Inside the car, Katelyn noticed the servant drawing near. She removed her sunglasses, and then shifted toward Wendell."Professor Branson, you're clever. Keep your grandson in mind, and I trust I don't have to spell out what you should or shouldn't say in there, do l?"

The ride over had left Wendell restless. Never before had he been asked to lie to a patient's family, and the weight on his conscience was crushing. He clung to the hope that Katelyn truly meant to heal rather than harm,because if not, the guilt would break him.

At her reminder, Wendell's fists tightened on his knees, his voice cutting sharp. "I've heard you already.Don't repeat yourself. And you-remember that your aim is to save lives, not destroy them. Because if you stray from that, Miss Fuller, I'll stop you, even if it costs me everything."

Focused solely on her objective, Katelyn brushed aside Wendell's display of principle as though it were meaningless noise.

Stepping closer to the car, the servant bowed politely. "Miss Fuller, you may come inside now."

When the driver swung the rear door open, Katelyn emerged gracefully, with Wendell trailing behind her.

Catching sight of the elderly man beside her, the servant hesitated briefly in confusion but kept silent,guiding them toward the gate.

Once inside the living room, Katelyn spotted Danica and hurried forward, taking her hand warmly. "Mrs.Bennett, it's so good to see you. I've missed you and couldn't resist coming by again."

Hiding the resignation that tugged at her, Danica returned the smile. "How did you know l'd be home today,Katelyn? What if you came and I wasn't here?"

With a cheerful lift of her lips, Katelyn answered, "I didn't know at all-I simply took a chance. Luckily, you were here, Mrs. Bennett."

The sweetness in her voice carried so naturally that Danica felt her mood lift in spite of herself. Curious, Danica asked, "And how have your parents been these days?"

Looping her arm through Danica's as they sat on the sofa, Katelyn said, "They're both doing well.Just the other day, my mom mentioned she wanted to see you again-it's been too long."

With a soft chuckle, Danica remarked, "You've had such a sharp tongue and quick wit since you were little."

As they chatted, Danica's eyes drifted past Katelyn and landed on the older man standing quietly in the background.

Danica studied his features carefully, a spark of recognition tugging at her memory.

Narrowing her eyes, she searched her mind, trying to place where she had seen him before.

Catching Danica's attention on Wendell, Katelyn allowed a faint, knowing smile to touch her lips.

Since it was clear Danica already recognized Wendell, Katelyn chose not to offer an introduction.

Rising slowly to her feet, Danica spoke with a touch of hesitation. "Am I right in thinking... you are Professor Wendell Branson?"

Joining in the moment, Katelyn smiled. "Mrs. Bennett, your memory is sharp as ever."

Surprised to hear his name spoken, Wendell frowned slightly. "You know me, Mrs. Bennett?"

Hearing his identity confirmed, Danica's face brightened. "I often keep up with medical news, Professor Branson. You've spent your life in service to medicine,teaching at Acorith College of Medicine-Shoildon's finest-and you've earned a reputation as a truly esteemed educator. You're the kind of scholar anyone would admire."

As her praise flowed, shame pressed heavily on Wendell. The phrase "anyone would admire" struck him as painfully ironic, for he felt unfit for her respect while he prepared to deceive her.

Wendell's fists clenched, and for a fleeting moment he nearly blurted out that Katelyn could not be trusted.

Reason soon stifled the impulse, and recalling Katelyn's cold warning,he swallowed his guilt.

Forcing a polite smile, Wendell answered, "Mrs. Bennett, I appreciate your kind words, but truly,I've only done what any doctor should. Nothing so grand."

Taking his words for modesty, Danica replied with warmth, "Professor Branson, do sit down."

Obediently, Wendell crossed the room and lowered himself onto the sofa across from Katelyn.

Gesturing toward a servant, Danica instructed, "Dorcie, bring us some coffee."

When her request was made, she turned back to Wendell with a pleasant smile. "Professor Branson, did you have something particular you wanted to discuss with me today?"

"Actually, I-" Wendell blurted out, but Katelyn cut across him. "Mrs. Bennett, there's something I'd like to say."

At those words, Danica shifted her gaze toward Katelyn. Though she had an inkling of what was coming, she still asked, "And what would that be?"

Katelyn answered smoothly, "It concerns our last conversation-about Isaac's treatment."

Once again, the subject circled back to the same issue.

With a resigned look, Danica exhaled softly. "Katelyn, the last time you spoke to me, I went straight to Isaac and told him. He was firm-he doesn't want you treating him. Talking to me won't change anything.If you truly want this, you'll need to convince Isaac himself."

Expecting that answer,Katelyn nodded and said, "Mrs. Bennett, l've already spoken directly to lsaac.He refused me too. After that, I went to his wife. We sat down and went over Isaac's condition in detail, talking about which treatment might serve him best."

Her tone dimmed as disappointment colored her words. "Buut the entire time, she seemed fixated on the fact that Isaac and I were childhood friends. She cared more about my history with Isaac than about his health. In the end, she rejected my plan to treat him."

After a pause, Katelyn clasped Danica's hand firmly. "But you're not like her, Mrs. Bennett. You're his mother -you care most about his well-being. Couldn't you find a way to persuade Isaac, even compel him, to let me treat him?" When her plea was finished, Katelyn fell silent, waiting patiently for Danica's answer.

Understanding perfectly what Katelyn was pushing toward, Danica sat in silence for a moment before breathing out a faint sigh.
###Chapter 140 Miss Fuller Is Evelyn Rowe


Danica turned to Katelyn and offered her some advice. "Honestly, I think you should let this go. It's not that l don't want to help, but Verena's against the idea, and Isaac himself refuses to go along with it. I can't make him change his mind. You know how he is-once Isaac decides something, there's no convincing him otherwise. I have no say in this."

She went on, "If he's refusing your treatment plan, he must have his reasons. Hle's not the type to risk his own health for no good reason. Since Isaac made up his mind, you should try to respect that. You're finally home-why not use this time to relax and recharge instead of worrying about this situation? Besides,Verena has a degree from a top university, and her medical skills really are impressive. If not, she never could have pulled off the miracle with Barrie's illness when everyone else failed."

Listening to all this only left Katelyn feeling even more agitated. Danica wasn't really trying to help-she was just trying to discourage her. But Katelyn wasn't the type to back down. There had never been anything she truly wanted that she didn't find a way to get.

Sure,Verena had that one big win with Barrie, but Katelyn had performed far more complicated surgeries overseas, each one more difficult than the last. That single success was hardly worth bragging about.

Meanwhile,Dorcie arrived with a tray of steaming coffee for everyone.

Taking a chance to steer the conversation in a new direction, Danica smiled and motioned toward Wendell.
"Professor Branson, you have to try this new coffee blend we got. I'd love to know what you think."

At her invitation, Wendell reached for his cup. "Alright, I'll give it a try."

He brouught the mug to his nose, inhaled the aroma, and then tasted it, giving a slow, satisfied nod. "It smells wonderful and tastes even better."

Danica looked pleased. "I'm so glad it's to your liking."

Wendell smiled and took another sip. Danica then started chatting with him about lighter things. Noticing the change, Katelyn quickly realized Danica was steering them away from anything serious.

Truthfully, Katelyn had no interest in dragging things out, either.

She broke in, cutting straight to the point. "Mrs. Bennett, I've spent time reviewing all the details of Isaac's case. What he's dealing with isn't simple. I respect his wvife and everything she accomplished at Pine Hill University. She deserves credit for what she did for Barrie. Still, Isaac's situation is a whole different story.Even someone with her credentials can't solve this one."

She met Danica's gaze without flinching and spoke with quiet confidence. "From my point of view, I might be the one person who can honestly make sure Isaac recovers completely."

A confident smile spread across Katelyn's face as she finished.

Hearing such bold words left Danica momentarily stunned. Complete recovery? So many respected doctors had failed, and she'd never heard anyone speak with such certainty before-maybe even arrogance.

Doubt and surprise flickered across Danica's face. Could Katelyn actually be so sure of herself?

She knew Katelyn's personality could be unpredictable, but nobody could deny her talent. There was a reason she'd landed a position at Cloverland Hospital. Katelyn never took on a challenge unless she was certain of her abilities. If she was making such a claim, she must be really confident. Still, Danica wondered where that unwavering confidence came from. After all, the experts who had already seen lsaac were as capable as any doctor from Cloverland Hospital.

Danica paused for a moment before asking, "Katelyn, what makes you so certain you can help lsaac?You haven't really explained how."

That was aIl the opening Katelyn needed to reveal her connection to Evelyn.

A faint smile appeared on Katelyn's lips as she asked, "Does the name Evelyn mean anything to you?"

Just the mention of Evelyn was enough to make Wendell's hand tighten around his coffee cup. He let out a long, resigned breath, knowing he couldn't avoid telling a lie that day.

Confusion flickered across Danica's face. Of course, she'd heard stories about the legendary Evelyn,but it made no sense for Katelyn to bring her up now.

Katelyn could tell from Danica's reaction that the name struck a chord.

Her tone was light, almost teasing, as she continued, "I can see you recognize the name. I'm guessing you also know about everything Evelyn has accomplished? She's the one behind some of the most groundbreaking surgeries in recent years-a heart transplant that changed the field, and a pioneering treatment for leg injuries. Her work's even made it into textbooks all over the world."

Danica gave a small nod. "Yes, l've readabout her."

Danica was more than aware of the situation; she had pored over every detail in Evelyn's surgical records.

When Isaac's life turned upside down after that devastating crash, the first name that entered her mind was Evelyn, the surgeon whose reputation bordered on legendary. Yet for reasons no one could uncover,Evelyn could not be reached, and she made no effort to step forward. All Danica had to go on were the scattered notes and formal medical documents left behind.

Tracking Evelyn down was out of the question, even if Danica wanted to try. With no other choice, she turned to other respected doctors, but none of them were confident enough to promise that lsaac would pull through.

That memory made her lean in, her curiosity piqued. "Why are you bringing up Evelyn now? Are you connected to her somehow?"

Instead of answering right away, Katelyn calmly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She glanced across the table and shot a meaningful look at Wendell.

Picking up on her cue, Wendell set his coffee down and addressed Danica directly. "Mrs. Bennett, you're asking the right person. Miss Fuller is actually Evelyn Rowe. I worked side by side with her in Clokron."

Danica's jaw dropped, disbelief written all over her face. "What are you saying?"

Wendell knew he was stuck. He never enjoyed hiding the truth, but with Katelyn holding all the cards,he had little choice. A steadying breath later, he explained, "In Clokron, to keep a low profile, Miss Fuller used the name Evelyn Rowe.She always kept her real name private, so hardly anyone knew the truth. I only figured it out because we worked together. She thought you might have doubts, so she asked me to confirm it myself."

As those words hung in the air, Katelyn let a subtle, satisfied smile flicker across her lips.

Danica turned to her, still reeling. "Is it true, Katelyn? Are you really Evelyn?"

Even with Wendell's confirmation, Danica struggled to process it.

She had always believed Wendell to be honest, and there was nothing to gain by making up something like this.

Once the shock faded, hope took its place, blooming inside her like a garden after the rain.

Excitement flooded her as she grabbed Katelyn's hand, eyes wide with wonder."If you're Evelyn, why did you turn me down when I first reached out about Isaac's surgery?"

Katelyn didn't hesitate. The mention of that old request made her sigh softly before answering, "Back then, I wasn't in Clokron. My assistant took care of everything while I was away. I honestly had no idea you were asking me to treat Isaac. If I had known, I would have been here much sooner."
###Chapter 141 Found The Most Suitable Doctor


Danica listened and took a slow breath. "I see. That explains it."

Katelyn's hand squeezed Danica's a little tighter as shespoke with clear intent. "Mrs. Bennett, I really am the best option for Isaac's care. I hope you'll give this some serious thought."

The urgency in Katelyn's words wasn't lost on Danica. She weighed everything carefully.

Verena had already proven herself by curing Barrie, but as Katelyn pointed out, Isaac's case was far more complex. Even Verena herself admitted she couldn't guarantee success. Compared to that uncertainty,Katelyn's confidence and track record offered reaI reassurance. She even promised there was no chance of failure,reminding Danica that Evelyn had treated cases worse than Isaac's with complete success.

That settled it for Danica. Isaac might resist, but for his own good, she would have to push him-no matter how much he disliked it.

Shaking off her hesitation, Danica gave Katelyn's hand a gentle pat. "You can leave this to me. I'll talk things over with Verena, and I promise, I'll make sure Isaac agrees to your treatment."

A hint of satisfaction flickered in Katelyn's expression as she smiled. "Thank you. I'Il let you handle it."

Danica let out a sigh. "Honestly, I should be the one thanking you. If you really can help Isaac, anything within my reach, just ask, and it's yours."

Katelyn's reply was soft. "Please, there's no need for that between us. Our families have always been close.Isaac's been a friend since we were children. Even if you never asked, I would do whatever I could to help."

Danica felt a wave of gratitude at her words.

They chatted for a few more minutes before Katelyn glanced up, as if something had just come to mind."Mrs. Bennett, I promised Professor Branson I'd go over some research topics with him, so I should get going." She shot a look at Wendell.

He caught her cue and rose. "Yes, we already had plans to meet today."

Danica stood with them. "Of course. I won't keep you any longer."

Turning to Wendell with a warm but apologetic smile, she added, "Professor Branson, I hope today's visit was comfortable. Forgive any lapses in my hospitality."

Wendell felt even guiltier at her kindness, barely able to respond.

He shook his head and forced a small smile. "You were a wonderful host, Mrs. Bennett."

At the front gates of the mansion, Danica watched as they departed, the car pulling away and disappearing down the road.

As the car neared the intersection, the driver glanced back and asked, "Miss Fuller, which way now?"

Katelyn answered smoothly, arms folded with ease, "Drop Professor Branson off at his place first."

It was obvious that bringing up academic discussions with Wendell had only been a pretext for her to slip away.

Wendell shook his head, his thoughts drifting to his grandson waiting at home. "No need. Just pull over at the next corner. I'll grab a taxi from there."

Avoiding any needless interaction with Katelyn was his priority, and he had no desire to remain in the same space with someone he saw as insincere.

The driver paused for a moment, uncertain. "But..."

A faint smile curved on Katelyn's lips as she said, "Follow Professor Branson's instructions."

"Understood." The driver nodded.

The car rolled to a gentle stop at the junction.

Katelyn, still in a good mood, offered a parting word. "Take care, Professor Branson."
 With his hand on the door, Wendell paused. "I've said everything you wanted. Now it's your turn to honor your end of the bargain."

Facing him directly, Katelyn spoke with quiet certainty. "Don't worry. As long as you cooperate, your family won't be harmed."

Satisfied with her answer, Wendell stepped out of the car.

He waited on the curb, soon hailing a cab and disappearing from view. The moment he was gone, Katelyn's pleasant expression dropped. She turned to the driver. "Get two people to watch Danica and Wendell. I want updates on everyone they meet."

With a respectful nod, the driver responded, "I understand, Miss Fuller."

...

Meanwhile, at Seraphina Villas...

In the middle of conducting surgical experiments in the medical room, Verena looked up when Rhonda came in to inform her of Danica's arrival.

Since she couldn't step away just yet, Verena responded, "I understand. Keep her company for the time being."

With a nod, Rhonda headed downstairs to speak with Danica. "She's in the middle of a surgical experiment and isn't able to leave just yet. Please feel at home in the meantime."

Curiosity sparked in Danica's voice as she asked, "Does she perform surgical experiments every single day?"

Rhonda let out a soft laugh and nodded. "She doesn't just do it once a day; she practically lives in the medical room, working nonstop to find a cure for Mr. Bennett."

Danica paused, momentarily stunned by Rhonda's words. She had come with the intention of explaining her reasons to Verena face-to-face, yet now her emotions felt tangled and uncertain.

While Verena's relentless dedication to curing Isaac sparked a quiet sense of gratitude, doubt still lingered beneath the surface. Determination alone wasn't enough to earn her trust, and she wasn't willing to risk Isaac's well-being on unproven medical expertise.

Looking up at the second floor, Danica let out a soft sigh, her words tinged with a gentle helplessness."She really is thoughtful."

Waiting in the living room, she felt a flutter of nerves as footsteps echoed down the stairs.

Verena descended the stairswith a warm smile and said, "Danica, I just wrapped up a surgical experiment and took a quick shower to get rid of the smell. I'm sorry for making you wait."

Danica returned the smile, her eyes warm with concern. "Rhonda told me you spend hours at a time in that medical room. You need to be careful; not even the busiest doctor should neglect their own health."

The unexpected care from an elder caught Verena off guard. After a quick pause, she answered with a reassuring smile, "I promise, I'm fine. You don't need to worry."

Danica reached over and gave Verena's hand a gentle squeeze. "You've been on your feet all morning. Sit here and rest for a bit."

Taking a seat beside her, Verena suddenly glanced at the time and said, "I'll have Rhonda prepare a few more dishes. Why don't you stay and join us for lunch?"

Verena was about to call out to Rhonda, but Danica quickly stopped her. "That's alright. I can't stay long today."

That answer made Verena glance up in curiosity. "Was there something you needed to talk to me about?"

A flash of hesitation crossed Danica's face, but she remembered her conversation with Katelyn and pressed on. "I want to talk about Isaac and his treatment."

Verena nodded, giving her full attention. "Please, go on."

Taking a breath, Danica said, "I've found the most suitable doctor for lsaac. From now on, you won't have to worry about his care."

Verena's expression sharpened slightly. "The most suitable doctor? Who are you talking about?" Danica's excitement showed in her eyes. "It's Katelyn. Verena, do you realize who she really is? She's Evelyn, the legendary medical genius everyone's been talking about, both here and abroad!"
###Chapter 142 | Have No Reason To Slander Her


Verena was momentarily speechless.

The audacity it took for Katelyn to make such a bold declaration in front of Danica was almost shocking.During their last meeting, Katelyn had always skirted the truth, hinting at who she was but never saying it out loud.

Katelyn's sudden bold move clearly came from feeling cornered after her offer to treat lsaac was turned down.

A smirk tugged at the corners of Verena's mouth.'"SO,, Danica, are you truly convinced that Katelyn is Evelyn?"

She pushed right ahead, not pausing for Danica's reply. "But in the end, whether she's Evelyn or not isn't really the point. I already promised to give Isaac my all, and I'm confident about his chances. The truth is,Isaac's sex function has been making incredible progress lately. Just yesterday, he was doing almost everything he could before. So I see no need to change doctors now, and I won't agree to it."

Danica heard those words and something clicked. Her hands reached for Verena's arm as she blurted out,"Wait,do you mean Isaac is regaihing his potency? Are you serious?"

Back when Verena last shared an update, Danica thought Isaac was still far from healthy. Now, the idea that he might be close to a full recovery left her speechless.

Verena did her best to ignore the pain in her arm. She nodded, steady and calm."It's true. He's back to normal in terms of sex function. The only thing left is to confirm that his fertility is back as well."

When she heard the answer repeated, Danica's joy washed over her, bringing a rush of color to her face as her eyes welled up with tears.

A heavy weight seemed to lift from her shoulders as the news sank in.

Her smile lingered, and she found herself thanking Verena again and again. "Verena, it's amazing that you were able to help Isaac heal. I always believed my faith in you was justified."

Suddenly, another worry came to mind. Danica turned quickly, voice hopeful and anxious. "If his sex function is restored, what's happening with his legs now? How much longer before he's able to stand?"

Doctors once thought there was no chance Isaac's legs would ever recover.

Rapid-fire questions tumbled out of Danica's mouth, leaving Verena unsure where to begin.

The hope shining in Danica's expression pushed Verena to be honest. "I'm giving Isaac's legs my all, but the progress has been slow," she admitted.

That answer drained the excitement from Danica's face. "So you're saying there hasn't been much improvement yet?"

Verena exhaled and nodded. "It's true that things are moving slowly, but we're on the right track. The goal is to get his condition stable enough for surgery. Once we reach that point, you'll see real change."

A wave of disappointment settled over Danica as she listened.

Verena had managed to resolve Isaac's other health issues, but when it came to his legs, there were still no guarantees.

A long pause followed before Danica spoke again. "Verena, I do appreciate everything you're doing for Isaac. Still, I plan to move forward with what I decided."

Verena met her gaze, and Danica continued, "Katelyn already mentioned having a talk with you. I know you're worried about how close she and Isaac once were, and that's why you'd rather keep her away.I get it.But not everything is about that. I have no intention of coming between you and Isaac. All I want is for Katelyn to be his doctor-nothing more. You're the one he's married to, the person he'll spend his life with.I know you want to see him recover as soon as possible."

Taking Verena's hand, Danica tried to appeal to both her heart and her head. "You know the name Evelyn Rowe-she's practically a legend in the medical field. Katelyn's skills are top-notch, and letting her treat Isaac is the best move for him. I'm hoping you'll put aside any doubts about Katelyn and let her help. Maybe you could even convince Isaac to accept her treatment." After listening to Danica, Verena couldn't help but admire Katelyn's silver tongue.

Verena slowly pulled her hand back. "Danica, no one wants isaac to recover more than I do. But you're wrong about Katelyn. She isn't who she claims to be. There are things I can't share yet, but one thing I know for certain-Katelyn is not Evelyn."

Her words had barely left her mouth when Danica retorted, "That's nonsense!"

Danica's expression hardened. "Professor Wendell Branson worked side by side with Evelyn in Clokron. He personally confirmed Katelyn is her. Verena, I understand you don't want Katelyn near Isaac, but accusing her of lies only hurts your credibility. I've known that girl since childhood. She has her flaws, but she wouldn't risk inventing something so easily disproven."

Wendell Branson's name stopped Verena cold. Why would he vouch for Katelyn of all people?

Wendell's reputation was built on honesty. A man like him would never cover for Katelyn unless... she had backed him into a corner and forced him to lie.

The realization sank in, and Verena understood just how dangerous Katelyn really was.

Her voice steadied as she faced Danica again. "I have no reason to slander her. If you choose to believe Katelyn instead of me, that's your decision. But Isaac's condition is too serious to gamble on. Another failed attempt will make things worse for him. I will never allow her to treat him. If you want to convince lsaac otherwise, then speak with him directly, because I won't help you sway him."

Danica stared at her as though she didn't recognize her anymore. "What are you saying?"

Her frustration boiled over. "You're being unbelievably stubborn! Precisely because Isaac can't afford another failure, I want someone more dependable to take over. Andyet you cling to this out of jealousy. Fine,if you won't listen, I'll talk to Isaac myself. I won't waste another word on you."

She spun on her heel and stormed off, the sweep of her dress tailing behind her like a final word unspoken.

Left behind, Verena sat still, her mind circling back to the troubling matter.

Wendell had publicly vouched for Katelyn, calling her Evelyn. That thought tightened Verena's eyes as suspicion stirred within her.

She reached for the phone resting on the table and dialed quickly.

At that moment, Wendell was leaving the lecture hall, papers tucked under his arm, heading toward his office.His phone buzzed in his pocket.

The caller ID showed no name, just an unknown number.

With little hesitation, he accepted the call.

"Hello? Who's calling?"

A smooth, unmistakable female voice drifted through the line. "Professor Branson, it's been a long time."

The sound stopped Wendell mid-step, so abruptly that a passing student nearly collided with him.

The student offered a quick greeting, and Wendell returned a distracted nod before veering into a quieter corridor.

His voice wavered with disbelief. "Evelyn... is that really you?"

A soft reply confirmed it."Yes. It's me."

Wendell's hand grew damp around the phone. From the moment he allowed Katelyn to use Evelyn's name and backed her with his false testimony, he had dreaded the day he might be confronted by Evelyn herself.

He never imagined the real Evelyn would seek him out this quickly.

Evelyn had never relied on a fixed number, and he should have recognized that from the start.

Yet the call was already live, and hanging up now would only make things worse.

Even through the static of the line, Wendell's chest tightened with guilt, the weight of shame pressing down harder than he cared to admit.

His thoughts scattered until Verena's calm voice cut through. "Professor Branson, let's meet this afternoon -same place as always." The simple request made his stomach twist, and his first instinct was to back out.

"Evelyn, I... this afternoon I'm supposed to be at the school," he stammered.

Her reply came smoothly, leaving him no room to hide. "I already checked. You're free."

Wendell froze, realizing once again how easily Evelyn uncovered the smallest details.

For a stretch of silence, he said nothing, until her voice returned, lighter this time. "Good. Then we'll meet.See you later."

Defeated, Wendell forced himself to agree. "Alright. I'll be there."
###Chapter 143 Did Katelyn Cross A Line With You


Verena made her way to a local café later that afternoon.

She spotted Wendell already sitting at the reserved table, his posture stiff and his fingers locked together.

With an understanding smile, she approached and slid into the chair opposite him.

"You're early, Professor Branson," Verena remarked as she settled in.

Wendell's nerves were obvious as soon as he saw her.

He managed a shaky grin. "I actually just arrived a moment ago."

Noticing the tension that filled the space between them, Verena jumped straight to the point."Katelyn Fuller reached out to you, didn't she?"

The way she said it left no room for doubt-it wasn't a question, but a fact.

Stunned by how quickly she'd put it together, Wendell hesitated, and then exhaled slowly. "No one ever gets anything past you,do they?"

Her arms resting gently on the table, Verena continued, "So, what did Katelyn do to convince you to help her lie?"

Under the table, Wendell's hands clenched tighter. "She invited me under the pretense of a friendly meeting, but when I got there, I realized it was a setup. She spoke about a patient she was desperate to treat,but said the family needed convincing first. She wanted me to vouch for her by saying she was Evelyn.I know you too well to let anyone impersonate you, soI refused."

His words trailed off as he glanced at Verena, and then dropped his eyes.

"But then.." His voice cracked with a weary sigh. "She threatened my family. She mentioned my grandson,my son, and my daughter-in-law. Evelyn, I never wanted to lie, but I couldn't put them at risk. So I caved.She brought me to the family, and I said what she wanted me to say." Embarrassment crepot up Wendell's face as he spoke, his cheeks reddening.

A calm assurance floated across the table from Verena. "You don't need to worry about any of it," she said gently.

That response caught Wendell off guard, leaving him confused.

He searched her face for any sign of anger, but found only steady, clear eyes.

Verena leaned in and continued, "Professor Branson, I'Il make sure nothing happens to your family. You,your grandson, your son, and your daughter-in-law are all safe with me."

Wendell was stunned by what he heard and needed a moment before he responded. "Evelyn, aren't you upset with me for pretending you were someone else?"

With a soft smile, Verena shook her head. "The patient Katelyn is desperate to treat is actually my husband."

That bit of news made Wendell's eyes go wide. "That's... I can hardly believe it."

Verena nodded again. "What's done is done, Professor. You shouldn't feel responsible or carry any guilt.I promise, your family will be looked after."

The more composed and forgiving Verena seemed, the heavier Wendell's shame became. He tried to speak,but couldn't find the right words.

Elsewhere in the café, a man wearing a black jacket watched their table, a phone pressed to his ear.

Speaking in a low voice, he reported, "Miss Fuller, Wendel is with Verena right now."

Katelyn's quiet chuckle traveled down the line. "Understood. Don't lose track of them."

Once that call ended, she immediately dialed another number.

Danica answered after a moment. "Hello, Katelyn?"

With a gentle voice, Katelyn asked, "Mrs. Bennett, have you already talked to Verena?"

That question reignited Danica's earlier frustration from her conversation with Verena. Her reply came out flat and annoyed. "I visited her this morning."

Katelyn didn't let the tension faze her. "When you saw her, did you let her know that Professor Branson confirmed I'm Evelyn?"

Assuming Katelyn doubted how clearly she'd explained things, Danica snapped, "I told her everything she needed to hear."

A hint of a sly smile flickered across Katelyn's face. She put on a slightly anxious tone. "That explains a lot.While I was out having coffee today, I spotted Verena too. I was about to go over and say hello, but..."

She let her words hang in the air.

Danica couldn't help herself. "What happened next?"

Katelyn picked up the story right away. "I saw her sitting with Professor Branson. They looked pretty deep in conversation. Mrs. Bennett, she heard about him from you just this morning and now she's talking with him.What if she's trying to keep me away from lsaac by convincing Professor Branson to say I'm not really Evelyn?"

Danica cut her off, firm in her conviction. "That's not possible. Verena wouldn't do something like that."

Danica standing up for Verena brought a flicker of jealousy to Katelyn's eyes, though she kept her tone sweet. "You never know what people are capable of. Verena worked hard to become part of your family, and she's got a lot to lose. Honestly, I'd feel threatened in her shoes too. Wanting to protect her place is only natural. Still, it's not right to play dirty."

Danica weighed those words in silence.

Even if she felt frustrated with Verena, she wasn't quick to jump to conclusions.

Her mind drifted back to what Rhonda had said during her earlier visit. Danica let the thought sit before she finally replied, "I don't pretend to know Verena inside and out, but every time l've dealt with her, she's struck me as someone with integrity."

Katelyn noticed that Danica's words, though calm, seemed to lean in Verena's favor, which left her feeling uneasy. "Mrs. Bennett, are you sure about this..."

Before she could finish, Danica chimed in, "Don't worry. I'll be watching Verena closely. No matter what disagreements come up or how much pushback I get, I'll make certain isaac receives your care. I'm prepared to keep after him until he agrees to the surgery."

That unwavering determination finally eased Katelyn's mind. She arched her brows and gave a genuine smile. "That's exactly what I wanted to hear, Mrs. Bennett."

...

Later that night, after Verena finished Isaac's treatment, the two of them took turns showering.

There was still work left on Isaac's plate, so he stayed at his desk until almost midnight.

Only when he closed his laptop and left the study did he realize the bedroom was empty.

A ripple of panic passed through him as he paused at the doorway. Just as he considered calling her name,a cooI night breeze drifted in from the wide balcony, sending the sheer curtains floating through the air.

Looking up, Isaac spotted Verena at the railing, her back turned toward him, eyes on the sky.

She wore a soft champagne nightgown that almost disappeared against the pale curtains-no wonder he missed her at first glance.

The thought made Isaac laugh quietly at himself. His instinctive worry at not finding her had completely thrown him.

Steadying his nerves, he took another look at her graceful outline. "Couldn't sleep?"

That gentle question made Verena glance over her shoulder, a playful smile lighting up her face. "I'm waiting for you."

Her tone was teasing, and as the wind swept through, her hair fluttered around her shoulders.

The unexpected sweetness left Isaac speechless for a mnoment, but he couldn't stop himself from smiling back. He rolled his chair to her side, feeling a quiet warmth settle between them.

Verena slipped onto his lap, and Isaac instinctively drew her closer,his arms tightening around her waist.

Her palms cradied his face as she put on an exaggerated pout. "Working all day at the office and then bringing it home too? Such a pitiful man."

Before Isaac could respond, she leaned in with a playful sigh. "But it's fine, because this pitiful man belongs to me."

Her teasing tone and mischievous sweetness made Isaac's chest rumble with a quiet laugh.

"Don't move," Verena remarked gently, tilting his head up. "I'm giving you a massage."

Her fingers pressed against his temples, easing the tight knots of fatigue until the tension started to melt away.

Soon, though, her hands began exploring further.

Her delicate fingers glided along his brow, and she murmured softly, "Isaac, your eyebrows are so full, and the shape of your brow bone is so striking."

Her fingertips drifted down to the bridge of his nose. "And this nose-straight, sharp, like it was carved on purpose."

A small laugh escaped her as her attention slid lower.

"But your lips," she whispered with a dreamy look, tracing them lightly. "Those are my favorite. Soft, warm,and far too tempting."

Her voice carried like a gentle song, playful yet tender.

Isaac studied her closely, captivated by the faint blush on her cheeks, the hazy shimmer in her eyes, and the natural flush of her lips. There was even the faintest trace of wine on her breath, leaving her somewhere between sober and tipsy.

His hand caught her wrist with quiet firmness. "Did you drink?" Holding up two fingers, Verena grinned. "Just two glasses."

Isaac tilted his head, his voice low. "Something troubling you?"

She gave him a sly smile. "Who says it has to be trouble? Maybe I was drinking because I was happy."

He accepted her answer with a soft nod. "Then tell me, what was it that made you so happy?"

Her lips curved in a mischievous grin. "That's for me to know."

Without another word, she leaned forward and captured his lips.

There was no resisting her charm-Isaac never stood a chance.

Completely undone, he cupped her face in both hands and deepened the kiss.

Above them, the night sky glittered with countless stars, while the evening wind stirred the trees with a gentle rustle.

On the balcony of the villa, their embrace painted a picture that could have been lifted straight from a dream.

Hungry for more, Isaac clung to her like a boy unwilling to let go of his favorite toy.

Then, out of nowhere, Verena pressed both hands against his shoulders and broke away.

When he tried to close the distance again, she pushed a little firmer, holding him back.

He breathed heavily, his voice coming out rough. "What's wrong?"

Her eyes softened, though her tone carried weight. "Isaac, I need your word on something. Don't ask why,just promise."

Though confusion lingered, he didn't hesitate. "You have my word."

Her expression grew serious. "Whatever your mother tells you, don't agree to let someone else take over your treatment. It's not that I don't want you to get better faster-I just can't put faith in someone willing to do anything to get their way." Isaac's sharp mind connected the dots at once. "Did Katelyn cross a line with you?"

Verena hesitated, choosing not to give him a direct answer. "She went to Professor Wendell Branson and forced him to back her up, claiming she's Evelyn Rowe. Your mother believed her. She came to me asking that I step aside so Katelyn could treat you, but I refused."

Her gaze turned grim. "I wouldn't be surprised if Danica tries to pressure you into it herself. You'll need to be ready."

His brows drew together in frustration. "Katelyn is out of her mind."

Verena's tone sharpened. "And there's more. Katelyn threatened Professor Branson, so make sure his family,especially his grandson, is protected."

Isaac gave a firm nod. "This mess started because of me. I'll see to their safety personally."
###Chapter 144 The Attacks (Part One)


Morning arrived with a pale gold glow as Isaac rolled the chair onto the balcony, feeling the crisp air against his skin while he made a call to Jacob.

On the other end, Jacob answered promptly. "Mr. Bennett, is there something you need?"

Looking up atthe sky, Isaac instructed in a calm, steady voice, "Assign several trustworthy bodyguards to watch over Wendell Branson and his family."

Without pressing for details, Jacob responded right away, "I'Il see to it immediately."

A quiet "Alright" was all Isaac said before ending the call.

Verena emerged from the bathroom and noticed Isaac putting his phone away. She slipped her arms around him from behind. "Who were you just talking to?"

Turning just enough to see her, Isaac answered, "Jacob. He's already arranging for Professor Branson and his family to be protected, so you can stop worrying about that."

After a moment, he added, "Leave Katelyn to me. I'll handle whatever comes up."

Feigning concern, Verena arched an eyebrow and teased, "Are you sure you're up for it? Danica is siding with Katelyn now. What if she insists you follow Katelyn's plan for treatment?"

Isaac held her hands where they rested against his chest and said gently, "Katelyn has only confused my mom for the moment, nothing more. And remember, we promised to trust each other. Whatever opinions my mom has are her own, but they will never change how I feel."

With a lighthearted laugh, Verena stretched out the word,"Oh,"∂nd grinned."So my husband really does trust me after all."

She brushed his chin upward and planted a gentle kiss on his cheek. "That's your reward for having faith in me." That little gesture made her features seem even brighter, happiness lighting up her whole face.

Isaac lingered in the moment, his fingers brushing the place where her lips had touched, and a wave of sweetness filled his chest. He realized that even the smallest hint of affection or passion from Verena had the power to captivate him completely, leaving him lost in the feeling long after it happened.

Isaac found himself wondering if Verena's warmth was a sign that she was finally opening her heart to him.Maybe she was letting go of the past and her first love. Could it be that he was beginning to mean something real to her?

The thought drew a faint, genuine smile to his lips before he even realized it.

Verena caught him lost in thought. She gave his shoulder a little tap. "Let's get breakfast. Don't you have work this morning?"

He snapped out of his reverie and nodded. "Yeah, let's go downstairs."

They shared a meal together, and then Isaac left for the office.

Verena headed to the medical room on the second floor, yet rather than starting her surgical experiments right away, she paused by the window and placed an overseas call to her assistant.

The moment the call connected, Verena asked sharply, "Julianna, is everything arranged on your end? If so,l need you back in Shoildon as soon as you can. No more stalling."

A weary sigh was clear in Julianna's reply. "Evelyn, it's not that we're dragging our feet. There's still a patient here who's in rough shape. If surgery is needed, we'll have to staya bit longer."

Verena considered this for a moment. "Have Bradley Duncan take over that case. I trust his hands-he can handle the surgery. I want the rest of the team to come back as soon as possible."

That request left Julianna momentarily speechless. What could possibly be so urgent that Evelyn needed everyone back right away?

Though the question burned in her mind, Julianna simply agreed. "Alright, I'll-"

Verena interjected before she could finish, "You take care of all the details. Make sure the team returns quietly. Don't draw any attention."

Julianna had worked alongside Verena for a long while, but she had never seen her so relentless in chasing after something. The urgent request stirred an unshakable sense of unease deep within her.

Julianna could no longer contain her curiosity and asked, "Evelyn, are you rushing like this because something serious happened back home?"

A simple "Yes" came from Verena, her tone measured. "The people who've been after me have found out where I am. And now someone else is pretending to be me. Sooner or later, everything will come to a head.I plan to use this chance to flush them out once and for all. Only then will I be free to do what I need to do."

Her voice carried no urgency, as calm and ordinary as if she were commenting on the day's weather.

Julianna hesitated before answering. Her worry was evident as she said, "Evelyn, you're out there without any real protection. For now, that impostor might be diverting danger away from you, but there's a chance they will discover the truth soon and hunt you down. Please, be cautious."

A soft smile touched Verena's lips. "I can handle it,Julianna. You don't need to trouble yourself over me.Just make sure you and the others get back here quickly."

"Alright, I understand," Julianna replied, her voice heavy with reluctance.

···

Danica had tossed and turned the previous night, Katelyn's words replaying in her mind.

Could it really be true that Verena bribed Wendell to smear Katelyn's name? And if it wasn't true, then why had Verena arranged to meet Wendell the very afternoon after she was told about him?

The more she dwelled on it now, the more unsettled she became. For Danica, Isaac's health outweighed everything else.

Finally, she reached for her phone and instructed her assistant, her tone sharp and decisive. "Keep close watch on Verena and Wendell. I want a full report on every move they make."

The assistant replied respectfully, "Understood, Mrs. Bennett." An hour later, her phone rang again.

"Mrs. Bennett, nothing about Verena's actions has seemed out of the ordinary, but we did come across something else..." the assistant said, his voice fading as he trailed off.

The abrupt pause made Danica's brows draw together. "Come across what?"

The assistant's voice dropped, uneasy. "There are groups of men around Wendell's residence. Some of my people recognized them-they're associated with Mr. Isaac Bennett. It looks like he has already placed Wendell's family under surveillance."

The news left Danica both furious and unsettled, a wave of disbelief rising within her. She could hardly accept that Verena might have orchestrated such a scheme. To her, it seemed obvious that Verena must have spoken to lsaac, persuading him to surround Wendell's home in order to force his compliance. Did Verena honestly think that if Wendell denied Katelyn's claim of being Evelyn, she would simply accept it as truth?

Danica muttered to herself, "This is outrageous... completely outrageous."

The call with her assistant barely ended before Danica was already dialing Verena's number.
 ###Chapter 145 The Attacks (Part Two)


On the other side, Verena had just wrapped up her conversation with Julianna when her phone lit up again.

The moment she picked up, Danica's voice cut through, sharp and accusatory. "Verena, I know about your meeting with Professor Branson. I once believed you were only stubborn and unwilling to bend, but now l see your jealousy has gone too far. Did you really push Isaac into threatening the professor, all so Katelyn couldn't be given the chance to treat lsaac?"

The harshness of the words caught Verena off guard, leaving her silent for a moment. When she finally spoke, her brows drew together. "I never tried to threaten Professor Branson."

Danica wasn't convinced. Her tone rose, edged with urgency. "If that's true, then explain to me-were those men stationed outside Professor Branson's house sent there because of you?"

Verena let out a quiet breath before she answered evenly, "Isaac sent them at my request, yes, but it wasn't to harm him. Katelyn cornered Professor Branson and pressured him to lie, to claim she was Evelyn. I asked Isaac to place guards there only to protect him and his family. With Katelyn involved, their safety could be in danger at any time."

Danica fell into silence, her grip on the phone tightening.

Verena had told her before that Katelyn wasn't Evelyn, and once again she was repeating the same claim.For a moment, Danica's certainty wavered. Yet Katelyn's persuasive words echoed back in her mind, pulling her into doubt all over again.

Danica fell quiet for a moment before delivering her warning. "I will look into this myself. And if I discover you lied to me... then you will no longer be welcome as my daughter-in-law."

Verena had never been the type to bow her head to threats. She understood Danica's concern for lsaac,but she wasn't about to allow intimidation to pass unchecked.

Her tone sharpened as she answered, "My only wish is to stand beside Isaac as his wife. I've never cared about carrying the Bennett family's name. If you choose to put your faith in Katelyn instead, that's on you.But remember this--I respect you because of isaac, not because you hold the title of matriarch of the Bennett family."

She ended the call abruptly, giving Danica no opportunity to reply.

On the other side of the line, Danica's anger boiled over, yet beneath it lingered a nagging unease. Perhaps Verena's certainty came from knowing more than she let on.


...

The news of Verena meeting Wendell unsettled Katelyn. A troubling thought struck her-what if Wendell had confessed everything about her threats to Verena? If that were true, she needed to move quickly before he became a liability.

Driven by that concern, Katelyn dialed Wendell's number.

The phone rang several times before cutting off without an answer.

Her brows drew together in irritation. Why would he ignore her?

She tried again, but this time the call went straight to voicemail-the phone was switched off.

An uneasy suspicion began to form. Why would Wendell dare defy her after everything she had over him?Unless...he really had told Verena the truth.

The thought made her stomach sink. Acting on her instinct, she pulled up another number and made a quick call.

"Kaia, meet me. We need to talk."

When Katelyn asked to meet, Kaia immediately understood it was time to move forward with their plan. She agreed in a rush, nodding as she said, "Alright,I'll head out right now."

The call ended, and Katelyn grabbed her keys, driving away from the villa on her own. She didn't notice the vehicles pulling out behind her the moment she left the gates. Her car shot onto the main road, the engine roaring as she sped up, while the trailing cars slipped neatly into place behind her.

At the upcoming intersection, just as she was about to turn, another car darted out from the opposite side.

Katelyn's pulse spiked, her breath caught, and a startled cry tore from her throat. "Ah!"

She tightened her grip on the wheel, yanking it in an attempt to avoid the sudden danger.

But the oncoming car had already calculated her path. With a sharp acceleration, it slammed straight into her vehicle.

The deafening crash lit sparks as metal scraped against metal.

Her head struck the doorframe hard, a dizzying pain leaving her reeling. Before she could recover, the other car lunged forward again, clearly ready for a second hit.

Panic shot through her. Who were these people? Why were they after her?

Thoughts tumbled in her mind with no answers. One thing was clear-she had to get away.

As the car came barreling toward her once more, she spun the wheel, turning the car around.

Yet the moment she tried to speed away, a line of black cars appeared, blocking her escape route.

That was when the truth sank in-she had been cornered with no exit.

Her palms slipped against the damp leather of the wheel, her lips dry as she ran her tongue across them.Quietly, she pressed the accelerator, still clinging to a faint hope of breaking through.

Since there was only a single car behind her, Katelyn thought she might have a chance of forcing her way out.

But that slim hope vanished in an instant.

The moment she twisted the wheel, the swarm of vehicles closed in, hemming her from every direction. One slammed into the hood with brutal force. The impact was so violent that the hood flipped open, metal screeching as smoke hissed out.

Thrown forward by the recoil, Katelyn's forehead struck the steering wheel before her head snapped back against the seat.

Warm blood began to seep down her temple, soaking into her hair in dark streaks.

Her hands clamped tighter around the wheel, knuckles pale, her entire body shaking as if refusing to let go.

Before she could recover, another car came barreling straight toward her.

The assault didn't stop. One crash after another battered her vehicle until the frame gave way and the car tipped onto its side, glass shattering across the asphalt. Still, the attackpressed on, merciless.

Minutes dragged by. Her vision dimmed, her body heavy, and only the seatbelt kept her from collapsing completely.

The cars finally came to a stop, and one person rolled down the window and instructed another, "Go check if she's dead."

"Got it," one of the men answered as he climbed out, moving toward the wreckage.

Halfway there, the rising wail of sirens pierced the air.

His face drained of color. He spuñ on his heel and sprinted back, yelling, "The police are here! Move out!"

Engines roared to life, and within seconds, the fleet of black cars scattered, leaving nothing but shattered glass and twisted metal behind.
###Chapter 146 Who Was Telling The Truth


Before the police could show up, the group had already vanished, slipping away with astonishing speed and leaving no trace behind.

With no other option, the officers prioritized checking on the victims first and quickly requested emergency assistance.

At Shoildon Primary Hospital, as she slowly regained her consciousness, Katelyn could barely make out two men speaking nearby.

"Doctor, what's the patient's condition right now?"

"Officer, her injuries are not serious. She only suffered a mild concussion. She'll stay unconscious for a bit,but after some rest, she'll be alright."

"Understood. I appreciate your efforts."

Offering a humble reply, the doctor acknowledged the thanks before a nurse summoned him away.

Nearby, the shuffle of paper filled Katelyn's ears. She tried to force her eyes open, frowning in her struggle,but her eyelids refused to move.

Out of nowhere, memories of being surrounded by cars played in her mind. Panic washed over her, and she fought hard to break free from the nightmare. She finally forced her eyes open.

A white ceiling was the first thing to greet her gaze.

She kept her eyes fixed above, sweat gathering on her brow while her lips lost their color.

Noticing the slight stir, the officer glanced at Katelyn and asked, "You're awake?" Do you feel well enough to talk? Could you answer a few questions?"

Katelyn shifted her gaze toward the officer and said, "Could I make a quick phone call first, officer? "Here you go." The officer grabbed the phone from the nightstand and passed it to her. "This belongs to you,right?"

After accepting it, Katelyn nodded in thanks.

She went straight to her contacts and dialed Danica right away.

The officer stepped out without a word and took position right outside the door.

As soon as the call connected, Katelyn's voice shook with tears. "Mrs. Bennett."

Danica heard the trembling in her voice and quickly asked, "Katelyn, what's the matter?"

With a shaky breath, Katelyn replied, her words tight with fear, "Mrs. Bennett, some people tried to kill me with cars. Please, I need your help."

Danica's heart skipped a beat as she took in what Katelyn had just said.

Realizing how shaken Katelyn sounded, Danica spoke in a gentle voice. "Try to calm yourself,sweetheart.
Explaining everything over the phone is tough. Just tell me where you are, and I'll come get you."

Right away, Katelyn told her that she was at Shoildon Primary Hospital.

Danica heard Katelyn's cries and, understood she was calling from the hospital. Even though worry gnawed at her, she kept her composure and promised Katelyn that she would be there soon and that there was no reason to be scared.

The officer came back into the room just as the call wrapped up.

"Was that a family member you were talking to?" he asked.

With eyes still swollen from tears, Katelyn gave a nod. "Yes. She's coming here soon."

The officer reached for a chair, sat down, and opened his notebook, ready with a pen. "Now that you're awake, I'd like to ask you a few things."

In a quiet voice, Katelyn replied, "Officer, I'm ready to answer. Please, go ahead." She spoke so softly and respectfully that the officer saw in her a young woman who had clearly been raised well.

A look of confusion crossed his face as he tried to understand how someone so gentle and lovely could find herself the target of such cruel intentions.

A wave of sympathy came over him, but hequickly reminded himself to focus on his duty.

"Your name?"

"Katelyn Fuller."

"How old are you?"

"Twenty-six."

"And your occupation..."

Once the officer had noted down her basic information, he began to ask more about what had happened that day, wanting to get every detail about the cause, how it all unfolded, and how it ended.

"Then none of those people seemed familiar to you?" the officer asked.

"At that moment..."

"Katelyn!"

Before Katelyn could continue, Danica flung the hospital room door open and rushed in.

Katelyn and the officer turned their eyes to her, and Danica froze for a moment, caught off guard by the officer's presence.

Once she noticed the badge on his chest, she understood he was handling official business. She nodded politely and said, "I'm sorry for stepping in, officer."

Without making a sound, Danica took a seat on the sofa.

The officer wasn't fazed at all. He simply looked back at Katelyn. "Miss Fuller, please go on." A small nod from Katelyn signaled she was ready to speak. "At the time, I was sitting in the car and felt too scared to get out. More than ten vehicles surrounded mine, and every single window was rolled up tight, so there was no way to see anyone inside. After my car flipped over, I saw someone get out to check if I was still alive. By then, blood had already blurred my vision, and I couldn't make out any faces. I heard sirens,and right after that, all the cars sped away."

Danica's worry deepened as she listened, her brows drawing closer together in concern.

When she first heard Katelyn on the phone, she assumed it was just an ordinary accident; maybe Katelyn's fear had made her overthink it.

But hearing that a dozen cars boxed Katelyn in and flipped her vehicle stunned her.

That hadn't been an accident at all; someone had intentionally tried to kill her.

Meanwhile, the officer made sure to record every word Katelyn said in his notebook.

"Miss Fuller, your description points to a planned attack carried out by a group. There has to be someone coordinating this. Otherwise, the cameras at that intersection wouldn't have just stopped working right when it happened."

He hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Miss Fuller, take a moment to think. Have you upset anyone lately?"

Danica kept her eyes on Katelyn, waiting to hear what she would say.

Katelyn longed to find out who had tried to kill her, but she also recognized this as the perfect chance to take Verena down.

She had no intention of letting this chance slip through her fingers.

Later, she planned to have her team look into who was responsible for orchestrating the attack.

But right now, framing Verena was what matered most.

Drawing in a breath, Katelyn shook her head. "Officer, I've only just come back from abroad. There's no way I could've made any enemies here yet." The officer wasn't fully convinced. "Just because you've only recently returned, doesn't mean you're safe from trouble. Try to remember if you've crossed anyone's path since you got back. Sometimes even small arguments can become dangerous situations."

Katelyn narrowed her eyes and gave a confused nod. "Alright. I'll try to recall if anything happened."

She made it look like she was thinking hard.

A heavy silence filled the room, and after a moment, her eyes suddenly went wide and she drew in a sharp breath.

Noticing her reaction, the officer immediately asked, "Did something just come to mind?"

A moment of uncertainty crossed Katelyn's face as she glanced at Danica, her expression heavy with worry.Turning to the officer, she said, "Officer, not long ago, I argued with someone. This is Mrs. Bennett sitting on the sofa; she's like a family to me. Her son Isaac and I grew up together as close friends.Life took a hard turn for him after acar accident left him using a wheelchair. I came back from overseas after studying medicine, hoping I could perform surgery for him. But his wife, who is also a doctor, never felt comfortable about my friendship with Isaac. No matter how much I tried to explain, she keptrefusing to let me operate.My biggest reason for comingback was to help him walk again, and I didn't want to let this chance slip by. In the middle of our talk, I ended up arguing with his wife. If you're asking about people I've fallen out with,she's honestly the only one. Officer, could it be that she hired someone to have me killed just to keep me away from lsaac?"

Katelyn's voice quivered with fear, and she clutched herself tightly, her shaking frame making her appear completely defenseless.

Danica moved closer to Katelyn before the officer had a chance to reply. "Katelyn, Verena would never do something like that," she said.

Even as she spoke, doubt crept in.

Catching the uncertainty in Danica's eyes, Katelyn's voice cracked as she pleaded, "Mrs. Bennett, Verena probably thinks you'd take my side. She's scared I'll come between her and Isaac. Please, don't let her fool you." Danica paused, torn and overwhelmed, but shook her head. "No. That can't be true. Verena isn't capable of something like that."

The officer watched the exchange and decided to step in. "Let's all take a breath and calm ourselves for a moment."

Looking at Danica, he continued, "We are still working through all the suspects. Until we learn the truth,nothing is certain yet."

With a nod, Danica realized she'd lost her composure and drew in a steadying breath. "Thank you, sir."

She faced Katelyn next and said, "Katelyn, after everything that's happened, I understand how you feel. Get some rest, and I'll come back to see you soon."

...

Drifting through the hospital hallway, Danica found her mind tanged in worry, unable to shake off Verena's words or the sight of Katelyn's pain and fear.

Each of them had a different story, making it impossible for Danica to tell who was telling the truth.

Passing by another wing of the hospital, she caught bits of conversation between uniformed officers who seemed deep in discussion.
###Chapter 147 Called To The Police Station For Questioning


The sound of the officers talking reached Danica as she moved along the path.

"She's just a young lady. They really didn't hold back on her."

"That's the truth. If we hadn't been circling the area on patrol, she could have been abandoned out there in the wilderness with no chance of survival."

"Being dumped in the wilderness might almost have been kinder. When more than ten cars surround one and ram into it again and again, the body is crushed to the point that not a single organ is left unharmed."

"Such a pity... It's a miracle she managed to stay alive."

Their voices grew fainter as they walked away, and Danica slowed until her steps nearly faltered. Each word they spoke pressed against her chest, making her heart squeeze with pain.

The picture she carried of Katelyn's danger suddenly sharpened, and it was far more terrifying than she had imagined.

Even if Katelyn sometimes behaved erratically, she would never go so far as to invent a story about her life being in danger.

Danica made it all the way home without breaking out of her daze, and even standing inside her own doorway did nothing to lift the heavy weight inside her.

···

Far away, in a private villa outside the country, a man dressed in black leaned back in a large office chair, his computer glowing with the image of an ongoing conference call.

When his subordinate finished giving the report, he narrowed his eyes, and a sinister light flickered in them."So,she's still breathing?"

For a moment the subordinate hesitated, and then answered in a tight voice, "Yes, sir. That's correct." The man cursed quietly, his tone low and venomous, "Useless idiots. What do I even keep you around for?"In a rush, the subordinate defended himself. "Sir, this country, Akoitha, doesn't operate the way Clokron does. You can't carry out these things so openly there. When the police arrivedI on the scene,retreat was the only option we had."
Lighting a cigarette, the man took a long drag, and then released the smoke in a slow ring that drifted through the room. "Where is she now?"

"She was taken to a hospital," the subordinate responded quickly.
"A hospital?" The man arched one brow, a dark grin spreading across his face. "Good. Let her breathe her last there, and we won't even have to get rid of her body ourselves."
With a respectful tone, the subordinate answered, "Yes, sir."

The man's voice grew colder. "Make sure of it. And if you fail, don't bother returning."
On the other end of the line, the subordinate wiped the sweat from his forehead and replied quickly,"understand,sir."
At Shoildon Primary Hospital, inside a top-floor VIP suite, silence filled the room.
A nurse entered for the routine check of Katelyn's vitals. Spotting her asleep, she decided not to wake her and slipped out quietly once everything looked stable.

The door clicked shut behind her, and moments later, the window eased open from the outside.
Dressed head to toe in fitted black clothing, with their face hidden behind a mask, a shadowy figure vaulted inside with fluid, silent movements.
Moving closer to the bed where Katelyn slept, the intruder slowly lifted an arm, a gleaming dagger sliding down from within the sleeve.
The point of the weapon lined up perfectly with the vulnerable skin of Katelyn's neck.
Inside her dream, Katelyn suddenly felt the sting of something sharp driving toward her head, the sensation shocking her awake.

Her eyes shot open to the sight of a cold blade hovering inches away, and terror ripped through her as she cried out,"Ah!"

The sound made the intruder narrow their eyes before slashing the dagger toward her without hesitation.

Katelyn tumbled off the bed in panic, hurling whatever objects she could grab in the intruder's direction.

Every throw missed as the figure dodged with ease and advanced again, blade flashing as it swung a second time.

"Help! Somebody help me!" Katelyn bolted toward the door, but just as her hand reached for the handle,a grip clamped down on her right arm and the dagger sliced across it.

“Ah!"

Blood poured from her right arm in a steady stream. The sting of the cut was nothing compared to the terror clawing at her mind, and her legs buckled until she collapsed onto the floor.

The intruder moved closer at a slow, deliberate pace, raising the dagger for another strike, when a whistle suddenly pierced the air and heavy footsteps thundered in the hallway.

At the sound, the intruder pulled, back the dagger, dashed toward the window, and vanished into the night without leaving a trace.

"Miss Fuller, are you hurt?" An officer shoved the door open, lifted Katelyn from the floor, and set her back on the bed while a nurse rushed in to dress the bleeding wound.

A middle-aged officer turned toward the open window, his brow furrowing."Who could move with such speed and skill?"

Another officer answered grimly, "Climbing and escaping at this height would take the training of a professional killer."

Katelyn's gaze rested on the officers, her body trembling as the fear refused to leave her.Who was determined enough to want her dead? Every attempt so far made it clear they would not give up until she was gone.

True fear gripped Katelyn this time. She seized the arm of the officer who had asked her questions earlier and begged, her voice breaking, "Officer Collins, please protect me. These people are after my life."

Waldo Collins gave a firm nod. "Stay calm. We'll guard you and make sure they fail."

...

After coming back from the hospital, Danica kept replaying the words of both Verena and Katelyn in her mind.

Even though Katelyn's account seemed more convincing on the surface, Danica still quietly leaned toward believing Verena.

Still, Katelyn had suffered an ordeal that left her pitiful in Danica's eyes.

One afternoon, Danica prepared several nourishing dishes and planned to deliver them to Katelyn at the hospital.

While she finished packing the food, Bobby descended the staircase.

"Bobby," Danica called out as he came down. "Katelyn is injured and staying in the hospital. Why don't you come with me to see her?"

Bobby looked reluctant. "But I already promised my friends I'd meet them for billiards."

Danica tugged sharply at his ear. "You can spend time with your friends whenever you want. Right now,Katelyn is injured, and she's been your friend since childhood. You ought to visit her, because in her heart she still treats you like a younger brother."

Bobby shielded his ear and murmured in protest, "She always followed Isaac around like a shadow. I never really spent time with her."

Danica clicked her tongue in annoyance. "Tsk! What was that you just said?"

Worried she might reach for his other ear, Bobby gave in with reluctance. "Alright. I'll go." When they reached the hospital, Danica pushed the ward door open and was startled to find the same officer,Waldo,already seated inside.

Bobby's face showed confusion. "Why is a police officer here?"

Danica moved closer and asked, "Officer Collins, could you tell me what happened?"

Waldo gestured toward the window. "Not long ago, someone climbed in with the intent to assassinate Miss Fuller. We managed to arrive in time to stop the worst, but she still ended up wounded."

As those words sank in, Danica's eyes turned to Katelyn. Her arm was wrapped in a bandage, yet fresh blood had already soaked through, and her complexion looked drained and fragile.

Katelyn broke down with heavier sobs. "Mrs. Bennett, do you still think I'm lying? She truly wants me dead."

Bobby stayed frozen, not knowing what to say.

Danica knitted her brows together but kept her silence.

She already realized that Katelyn hadn't fabricated this, because tricking the police would have been impossible.

Even so, she could not bring herself to openly say that Verena might really be responsible.

Waldo looked through his notes before he asked Katelyn once more, "Miss Fuller, are you certain Verena Willis is the only person who comes to mind as the suspect?"

Tears ran down Katelyn's face as she nodded hard. "No one else could have done this. She knows my hands are everything to me as a doctor. Now my arm has been cut, and I can't even say when it will heal."

Her crying worsened, and she buried her face in her hands.

Bobby shouted angrily, jabbing a finger at her, "That's nonsense. Someone may be targeting you, but it has nothing to do with my sister-in-law. Verena is gentle and kind, and she would never stoop to that. Are you just accusing her because you dislike her?"

"Bobby!" Danica snapped as she yanked him to the side. "You're getting more out of control with every

passing day."

Waldo fixed him with a hard stare and spoke with firm authority. "We're treating this as a proper investigation. Anyone with past ties to the victim can be seen as a suspect, so l expect your cooperation."

...

At Seraphina Villas, Rhonda picked up a phone call, and her complexion drained of color at once.

In her panic, she dashed upstairs, pounding on the study door without her usual restraint.

When Verena opened it, she looked surprised. "Rhonda, what's wrong? Why are you so worked up?"

Breathless, Rhonda delivered the news. "Mrs. Bennett, the police just called. They want you to come down to the station for questioning."
###Chapter 148 Main Suspect


As soon as Verena reached the police station, she caught sight of Danica and Bobby standing at the front entrance,giving the impression that they had been there for a while.

Her presence did not go unnoticed. Bobby spotted her right away and stormed over, his voice thick with frustration. "Verena, can you believe what that mániac Katelyn is saying about you? She's got people after her,yet she's pointing the finger at you, acting like you're behind everything. She's just making things up!"

He stopped, glancing at Verena as if afraid she might be upset, and quickly added, "I know you're not to blame. The police just want to talkto you. There's no reason to be scared."

Bobby looked as though he was about to add more, but Danica stepped in and pulled him behind her.

Her gaze lingered on Verena, her expression hard to read. "Officer Waldo Collins is inside waiting for you.You should head in."

She feIt a debt of gratitude to Verena for the help she had given Isaac, especially regarding the recovery of his sex function. Yet, the reality that Katelyn had been targeted could not be ignored.

Katelyn's statements were detailed and sounded genuine, while Verena had never been the kind to fabricate stories. Danica felt caught in the middle, uncertain about who to trust.

The memory of their last phone conversation weighed on Verena, and she knew that Danica's faith in Katelyn ran deeper.

A quiet acceptance passed over her face. "I understand."

Verena then glanced at Bobby, her expression softening as she offered a gentle smile. "It's okay, Bobby. I'Il be fine," she said.

Once inside the interrogation room, an officer spoke to her in a polite tone. "Please hold on for a bit. Officer Collins will arrive shortly." Verena answered him with a warm smile and a small nod, "Okay."

Barely two minutes later, the door opened, and two men entered the room.

An older man walked in first, followed by a younger officer carrying a pen and notebook.

With a calm, unreadable expression, the older man asked, "Are you Verena Willis?"

Rising from her seat, Verena caught sight of the badge on his chest and answered with a pleasant smile,"Yes, Officer Collins, that's me."

Waldo gave a slight nod and sat down across from Verena, while the note-taker quietly took his place at his side.

Fixing his eyes on her, Waldo said, "This meeting concerns the recent attempt on Katelyn Fuller's life. Based on her statement, you're currently our main suspect, so we'll need to ask you a few questions."

"Attempted murder?" Verena arched a brow, a subtle smile touching her lips. "I don't believeI understand.Could you explain what you mean?"

Waldo replied without hesitation, lacing his fingers together,"Absolutely."

His eyes shifted to the notebook before him as he asked, "Can you tell me where you were on the morning of December 1st?"

Verena paused, thinking back. "I was at home."

Waldo continued his line of questioning. "Can anyone confirm that for you?"

Remaining calmn, Verena said, "The housekeeper was there all day. I never left the house."

Waldo observed her closely, noting how she remained steady, uncertain whether her calm meant confidence or simply nerves of steel.

His tone turned more serious as he continued, "That morning, Katelyn was nearly killed at a busy intersection on Wood Street by a group of vehicles acting in concert. Every move was meant to end her life.Luckily, our patrol arrived just in time and stopped things from going any further." He paused, and then continued, "After she was brought to the hospital, someone made another attempt on her life within forty-eight hours. I've followed up with the victim, and right now, all signs point to you as the leading suspect. So, I need to ask plainly-have you ever had any disputes with Miss Katelyn Fuller?"
###Chapter 149 The Real Target Was Verena


With a firm stare fixed on Verena, Waldo carried an air of authority that demanded respect and left a lasting impression.

In most cases, anyone questioned under such pressure would have found it difficult to stay composed,even with nothing to hide.

Despite this, Verena sat perfectly at ease, her composure never wavering.

A gentle shake of her head followed as she answered, "Officer Collins, I can honestly say I never had any disputes with Katelyn."

The level-headed way she spoke took Waldo by surprise, but he kept his face impassive, true to his reputation as one of Shoildon's most experienced officers.

Leaning a little closer, he fixed his attention on Verena. "You say there were no disagreements,but Katelyn has shared a different account."

Without letting her expression change, Verena waited in silence for him to continue.

Waldo turned a fresh page in his notebook. "According to Katelyn, she returned from overseas to help treat your husband. Because she thought your family might doubt her credentials, she specifically asked Wendell Branson to confirm her identity as the renowned Evelyn Rowe. Eventually, the patient's mother agreed to let her proceed, but you were opposed. Your objection was driven by jealousy over her childhood bond with your husband, and you wanted them to have no contact at all. To stop her from operating,you supposedly tried to pay off Wendell and get him to claim she was lying. However, your mother-in-law,who has great influence in the household, already supported her. Once you realized your mother-in-law distrusted you, the accusation is that you took drastic measures, hiring someone to eliminate the threat for good."

His eyes remained locked on Verena as he tried to read her reaction. "Now, give me a straightforward answer: did you encourage your husband to follow Wendell, hoping to intimidate him for your own purposes?" Verena let the question hang for a moment, taking time to think.

It became clear that whoever targeted Katelyn was likely the group of people from overseas.

She knew the true target was not Katelyn, but herself.

Those responsible had acted quickly, apparently desperate to get rid of her before she saw them coming.

There was no way they expected the Evelyn they were pursuing to be someone else entirely.

As she realized this, Verena could not help but acknowledge the lengths Katelyn had gone with her dramatic scheme.

Even after nearly dying, Katelyn was still determined to ruin her. That kind of drive had to come from real hatred.

But Verena knew the charade needed to end.

"Absolutely not." Verena refuted Waldo's question with steady confidence. "Let me explain why I said there were no disputes with Katelyn. She never even got the opportunity to argue with me. She wanted to be my husband's doctor, but both he and I refused. Even with my mother-in-law insisting, my husband's answer stayed the same. I had no motive to harm Katelyn, so there's no reason I'd ever consider a crime against her. And about Wendell, I never tried to bribe him to turn on Katelyn. In truth, Katelyn was the one putting pressure on him. She forced him to lie and say she was Evelyn Rowe. The only reason there were people around Wendell's family was for their protection, not intimidation. You can confirm everything with him directly."

Waldo drew his brows together. "What makes you so sure Katelyn lied? How can you know for certain she isn't Evelyn? If your mother-in-law hadn't told you that Wendell identified Katelyn as Evelyn, what would have led you to him in the first place? Doesn't that show you tried to pay off Wendell?"

"I know she's lying because I'm the real Evelyn Rowe, and I have no reason to bribe Wendell."

Her blunt reply caught both Waldo and the note-taker off guard.

Waldo blinked in surprise, taking a second to process. "Excuse me, what did you just say?" He clearly had not expected such a revelation.

Verena answered in the same measured, even tone, "Wendell and I have a long history, and I understand the kind of person he is. He isn't someone who could be bribed. So, when my mother-in-law said Wendell had vouched for Katelyn as Evelyn, I suspected that he must have been threatened. I reached out to him and found out my instincts were right. That's why I made sure he and his family had someone to look out for them.And with Katelyn, since I am the real Evelyn, I have no motivation at all to try to harm her. If I wanted to keep her away from my husband, there are plenty of ways to do that. The only reason I haven't told my mother-in-law or anyone else who I am is that there are still complications I need to resolve first."

A long silence settled after Verena finished. Waldo watched her, reading the unwavering calm in her eyes.

Even though she sounded a bit proud, her logic was clear and difficult to dispute.

If Verena truly was Evelyn, then Katelyn's accusations against her didn't add up.

"So, you're claiming to be Evelyn, and you believe Katelyn is pretending."

Verena answered with assurance, "Yes, I am Evelyn."

After a moment's pause, she gave a gentle smile. "I would appreciate it if you kept this confidential. I'm not able to reveal my identity to everyone just yet."

Waldo stayed quiet for a moment, his fingers drumming against the table, before saying, "Words alone won't convince anyone. What proof do you have that you're Evelyn?"

Verena, already expecting the question, answered openly,medical team will be back soon, and every patient we've treated will be able to vouch for me."

Waldo believed he had caught a weak point and said, "If that's true,then why not allow us to reveal your identity as Evelyn to the public right now?"

He pressed further, and Verena chose not to hold back as she explained, "Someone is trying to kill me. Until I find out who they are, I can't reveal my identity."

That answer sparked a look of realization in Waldo's eyes. While looking into Katelyn's background, he remembered coming across a news article about her.

The article hinted that she might actually be Evelyn.

Hearing what Verena just revealed, he realized if Verena truly was Evelyn and Katelyn was simply posing as her, then the group hunting Evelyn must have read that article, assumed Katelyn was Evelyn, and set their sights on the wrong person.

The real target was always Verena.

Now seeing the larger picture, Waldo understood that things were even more tangled than he thought.

But he could not take Verena's word at face value without solid proof.

Rising from his seat, Waldo came over to Verena. "Mrs. Bennett, for now, we'll remain cautious about your claim and will conduct a thorough investigation to confirm what you've said."

He reached out to shake her hand. "That's all the questions I have for now. As the inquiry goes on, we may need you to return for more questioning. I hope you'll cooperate."

With a small smile, Verena shook his hand. "Of course. It's a citizen's responsibility to help the police whenever possible."

Once she stepped out of the interrogation room, Verena was led to a different waiting area.

In the midst of giving a lecture, Wendell got a call from the police station.

When he learned the police wanted to question him for a case, his mind blanked for a second, but he quickly tried to compose himself.

Once the call ended, he told his students to keep studying on their own, and then left the classroom with nerves showing in his steps.

Over at the Bennett Group headquarters, a management meeting was in progress when a knock interrupted the proceedings.

Isaac disliked interruptions in the middle of meetings, and a trace of irritation crossed his face as his tone cooled."Come in."

Jacob entered, visibly uneasy, and walked up to Isaac to whisper, "Mr. Bennett, the police station called and they've requested you to come down."

Isaac looked at him in confusion. "Did they say why?"

Lowering his voice further, Jacob leaned in. "It seems to be about your wife..."
###Chapter 150 What's Happened To My Wife


A sudden shift appeared in Isaac's expression, his brows drawing together in concern. "What did you say?"

Jacob kept his gaze low, offering no reply.

Taking a moment to steady himself, Isaac told the room, "I'm sorry, but we'll have to end this meeting here."

He then turned to Jacob with urgency. "Get the car ready."

Without another word, he maneuvered his wheelchair quickly out of the conference room.

Both Wendell and Isaac reached the police station at the same time.

As soon as they arrived, officers separated them, guiding each into a different interrogation room.

Upon entering, Wendell spotted two police officers waiting at the table.

Having never experienced such an ordeal, he found himself growing nervous.

"Professor Branson, please have a seat." Waldo motioned toward the chair facing him. "I'm Waldo Collins.You can just call me Officer Collins."

Wendell did as he was told and asked hesitantly, "Officer Collins, may I ask why I was summoned here..."

Waldo answered plainly, "This concerns Verena Willis and Katelyn Fuller."

Wendell blinked, unsure of the connection. "I'm not sure I understand."

Waldo's tone grew more intense. "Did Verena ever threaten you or try to make you speak out against Katelyn, denying her identity as Evelyn Rowe?"

Wendell froze in surprise before shaking his head. "Verena never threatened me."

Believing Wendell might be too afraid to speak freely, Waldo attempted to reassure him. "You're safe here,and we'll make sure you're protected. Don't hesitate, just tell us the truth about what happened." Wendell answered firmly, "Verena is my friend, and she would never threaten me. The one who pressured me was Katelyn Fuller, trying to prove she's Evelyn Rowe."

A flash of surprise lit up Waldo's face. Was Verena actually telling the truth?

Still, he wanted to be certain, so he pressed on, "But you once said that Katelyn was your associate during your time in Clokron. Why do you say now that she threatened you?"

Wendell's discomfort was obvious as soon as Katelyn's name came up.

He replied, "I only said that because Katelyn used threats against my family. She made me lie for her. She isn't Evelyn; the real Evelyn is Verena. My acquaintance with Katelyn barely goes back a month, but I've known Verena for almost three years."

Waldo leaned forward and asked, "Do you have any proof to support what you're saying?"

At that, Wendell rubbed his temple and offered his phone to Waldo. "You can look through my chat history with Katelyn. We only exchanged contact details recently. If we were really partners in Clokron, there would be no reason for us to add each other on the chat app just a few days ago. Also, if you notice,almost every conversation was started by her. Even with calls, she always dialed my number first. If we had been close for years, the communication would go both ways."

After a brief silence, he continued, "If that isn't convincing enough, you can look at the surveillance footage.Our first meeting took place at a well-known spot, Fortune Garden Restaurant. I had never laid eyes on her before that day."

Waldo paid attention as he checked both the messages and the call logs.

Everything Wendell said matched up: Katelyn always reached out first.

Their chats were short and to the point, mostly arranging where to meet, and her tone came across as distant, nothing like the way real friends or work associates would speak.

Waldo returned the phone to Wendell and asked, "So, the people stationed at your home..."

"They were arranged by Verena. She was worried that Katelyn might try to hurt me or my family, so she set up protection." Wendell's voice was steady. "Officer Collins, Verena really is Evelyn, and I count her as a true friend. If you still have doubts, you can pull my call history with Verena. Even though she uses different numbers, you can trace the owners. Also, when she came back from overseas, we had a meal at Fortune Garden Restaurant, too. There's surveillance footage that will confirm I met Verena much earlier than I ever knew Katelyn."

Waldo glanced at the officer taking notes.

With a quick nod, the officer turned to the computer, and soon a video from the surveillance system played on the monitor.

Watching the footage, Waldo saw clear proof: Wendell had met with Verena long before he ever saw Katelyn, and the time gap between those meetings was obvious.

A small frown settled on Waldo's face. He realized that what he was uncovering was not at all what he had expected.

He let out a quiet sigh, rose from his seat, and told Wendell, "Thank you for answering our questions,Professor Branson."

His face stayed unreadable,giving Wendell no clue where he stood. Rising to his feet,Wendell extended his hand and said politely, "Thank you for your efforts, Officer Collins."

Once Wendell had gone, Waldo stepped into the other interrogation room.

When the door opened, Isaac glanced up to see who entered.

Waldo asked, "You must be Mr. Isaac Bennett?"

Seeing the name badge on his chest, Isaac nodded. "Yes, Officer Collins."

As Waldo stepped closer, he noticed Isaac sat in a wheelchair rather than an ordinary chair, and for a brief moment,sympathy flickered in his eyes.

Regaining his composure, Waldo took the seat across from Isaac, preparing to begin the interview, but lsaac spoke first. "Officer, can you tell me what's happened to my wife? Where is she right now?" He had tried to reach Verena several times on the way to the station, each time without success, and worry was etched on his face.

Noticing Isaac's concern, Waldo answered, "There's no need to worry, Mr. Bennett. Mrs. Bennett is in a waiting area. After we finish here, you'll be able to see her."

A bit of tension left Isaac's shoulders after hearing that.

He gave a nod and said, "Of course, Officer Collins. Go ahead with your questions."

Waldo's first question was straightforward. "Are you aware that Katelyn Fuller has been attacked?"

A look of confusion crossed Isaac's face. "When did this happen?"

Waldo answered, "On the morning of December 1st, it was at the second intersection on Wood Street. But the surveillance cameras there had been intentionally destroyed."

Isaac gave a sight shake of his head. "I didn't know about that."

Waldo rested his hands on the table and met Isaac's eyes, and from his look, Isaac didn't appear to be lying.

He paused, and then shifted the conversation. "Mr. Bennett, did your wife ever ask you to arrange surveillance over Wendell's family?"

Isaac squinted slightly, sensing something off in what he had just heard.

He gave his head a small shake and corrected. "It wasn't surveillance. It was protection."

Feigning confusion, Waldo furrowed his brow. "Is that so? What makes you say that?"

With steady composure, Isaac explained, "Katelyn threatened Wendell's family so he would claim she was Evelyn Rowe, just to convince my mother she was the right surgeon. Still, my wife and I refused her offer.Later, my wvife talked to Wendell and confirmed he had been pressured by Katelyn. That's when she asked me to ensure his family was safe."

Waldo listened, deep in thought.

So far, Isaac's, Wendell's, and Verena's stories all lined up. Could Katelyn have orchestrated the entire situation?

Waldo held back from making any conclusions since there was nothing solid to prove Verena had hired hitmen.

After a few seconds of silence, he stood and told Isaac, "Thank you for your help, Mr. Bennett."

Isaac nodded and shook Waldo's hand in return.
###Chapter 151 The Person She Reached For First

The moment lsaac wheeled himself out of the interrogation room, the opposite door to the waiting area swung open.


Their eyes locked instantly, Verena and Isaac holding each other's gaze for a quiet second.



A faint smile curved Verena's lips as she asked, "Were you frightened by it?"



Relief spread through lsaac as he noticed her calm expression, untouched by fear.


He gave a small shake of his head and said, "No, I'm alright."


When the two headed toward the exit, the sight stirred Danica and Bobby, who quickly rose from their seats in the lobby.



Bobby rushed toward them, turning to Waldo with worry written all over his face. "Officer Collins,what about Verena?"



Waldo cast a glance at Danica before he answered Bobby firmly, "There isn't sufficient evidence to tie  Verena to the crime."



That answer made Bobby smack his hands together in triumph. "See? I knew it! Verena would never do such a thing. If you ask me, Katelyn's lost her mind. She's jealous that Isaac chose someone else,so she's trying to pin it all on Verena!"



Danica's initial shock at Waldo's words quickly softened into relief, and her shoulders eased.



Her lips pressed into a thin smile as she turned to Verena. "I'm just glad you're safe."


Not knowing what else to say, she grabbed Bobby's arm and tugged him toward the exit. "Since it's settled,let's go home."


Though Bobby had been eager to talk with Isaac and Verena a little longer, he ended up being dragged away by Danica.


Once they were back at Seraphina Villas, Isaac made his way straight into the study.



Sitting before the tall window, he dialed Stevie's number.



"It's about time!" Stevie teased the moment he picked up. "Are you finally treating me to a good meal?"


A faint smirk crossed Isaac's face as he answered,  "Haven't you already had your fill scamming free dinners off Leonardo and the rest?"



Pretending to be outraged, Stevie exclaimed, "You're too sharp! Leonardo and I just finished eating, and we're heading to the pool hall now. Care to join us?"


Isaac replied, "Go ahead and enjoy yourselves. I won't be tagging along."



A beat of silence passed before he added, "Stevie,I'm calling because I need your help."


Stevie chuckled warmly on the other end. "Come on,with our friendship, you don't even have to ask. Just tell me what you need done."


Gazing out through the glass, Isaac said in a cold voice,"The surveillance on Wood Street was tampered with the morning of December first. You've always been the expert when it comes to this."


Though he left the thought unfinished, Stevie caught on right away. "Say no more. I'll handle it."


A quiet "Thanks" slipped from Isaac's lips.


Once the call ended, he turned his wheelchair and began rolling toward the master bedroom.


Right as he reached the doorway, Verena's laughter carried through. "Ivan, do you have a moment?" The response that followed was smooth and teasing "For you, my sweet Verena, I'll always be free."



The sound of a man's voice made lsaac freeze in place, instinctively lowering the noise of his own movements.


The words "my sweet Verena" made Verena shiver with irritation.



Her tongue clicked against her teeth as she said,"Could you please drop that nickname?"



The man,instead of backing down,leaned into it with playful stubbornness. "Absolutely not. 'MMy sweet Verena' fits perfectly. How could I call you anything else?"



Though her patience wore thin, she eventually broke into a laugh at his shameless persistence.


The caller, Ivan Calderon, was a young man from Akoitha whom Verena had saved in Clokron three years ago. Having grown up without parents, he had come to see her as the older sister he never had.



With striking features and a voice smooth as honey,Ivan exuded effortless charm. His reputation among friends,however, was that of a mischievous flirt who rarely treated life with seriousness. Verena shook her head with a smile. "Enough with the jokes. I need to talk about something important."


Delight spread across Ivan's face as he exclaimed,"Finally, something worthwhile. Ever since you left,I've been drowning in boredom."


She gave a light laugh. "This task will suit you better than anyone else."


Everyone knew lvan's reputation-his talet in hacking was unmatched.


The thought of putting his skills to use filled him with energy. "Perfect! At last, I have something exciting to do!"


Calmly, Verena continued, "What I need is for you to repair the surveillance on a particular street. I'll message you the location."


Ivan let out a confident chuckle. "That's nothing for me. Consider it done, my sweet Verena."


She returned his grin and said, "I'm grateful,lvan."


With a dramatic click of his tongue, Ivan teased,"Grateful? After everything we've been through, those words sound like an insult to the bond we once shared."



His mischief carried through every word, and Verena  couldn't help but laugh openly.



Their conversation drifted for a few more moments before they decided to end the video call.


Once the line went silent, the room felt still, though Isaac hadn't moved from the doorway.



His lashes lowered as unease curled through him. That man had called her "my sweet Verena." What connection did they share? Just how close were they?


Then a memory struck him-Verena had spoken the name Ivan.


Ivan. The initial "I". The same letter inked beneath her collarbone. Could it really mean him?


Isaac's thoughts wouldn't quiet, and the longer he lingered on them, the sharper the ache that pierced his chest.



The armrests of his wheelchair bore the weight of his grip as he swallowed down the bitterness and rolled himself forward into the room.



The sound of movement made Verena glance over her shoulder.



When her eyes landed on Isaac, she knelt in front of him and asked gently, "Were you frightened when the police summoned you so suddenly today?" It was the identical question she had posed to him earlier at the station.



Instead of answering at once, Isaac lowered his gaze,studying her with an intensity that looked almost like he was lost in thought.


Just as she was about to repeat herself, he finally broke the silence and said slowly,"Yes."



Her instinct was to comfort him, but lsaac lifted his hand first, brushing his fingertips across her cheek."Because I was scared something might happen to you,"he admitted.



For a heartbeat, Verena looked startled, and then she smiled softly and pressed her hand over his."You don't have to worry. I'll be fine."


The brightness of her eyes pressed down onhim,and even though they were clear, he found himself unable to read what she truly felt.


Isaac tightened his lips, pretending he hadn't caught the voice of the man she had spoken with on the phone earlier.


He remarked, "There's no need to trouble yourself about this. I've already arranged for someone to repair the surveillance on that street." With a shake of her head, Verena answered in a lighter tone, "That won't be necessary. I've already asked a friend to take care of it."



The word stung Isaac's throat. A friend? What kind of friend used such tender words, especially a man?


He forced down the bitterness long enough and asked,"Can you really trust your friend?"


Assuming Isaac's concern was only about competence,Verena gave a confident nod. "Of course. He's the one I trust most."


The edge of the armrest dug into Isaac's palm as his fingers curled tighter.


It struck him then that he was still not the person she reached for first when trouble arose.


On their wedding day, it had been Miranda. Now,once again,it was someone else.


Though he fought to keep control, the weight inside his chest made his eyes burn red despite his silence.
###Chapter 152 I Really Like You Doing This To Me
Verena started to get up to plug in her phone, but before she could take more than a step, Isaac reached out and caught her wrist.


With a gentle pull, he guided her closer, settling her right in the space between his knees, refusing to let her go.


She opened her mouth to say something, but his arms wrapped around her waist, holding her tight, and he pressed his face softly into her stomach,clinging to her for comfort.


Confused, Verena ran her fingers lightly through his hair. "Is something wrong?"


Being close to her like this was the only way lsaac could convince himself that she truly belonged to him and that no one else had a claim on her.


The warmth of her voice, the slight tremor as she spoke, gave him a peace he found nowhere else,and he pressed his cheek even closer, finding solace in her presence.



The more he dwelled on it, the tighter his grip became. Isaac let his lashes fall, hiding the redness in his eyes."It's nothing. I only wanted to hold you," he murmured softly, his voice carrying a faint hum that betrayed none of the storm inside him.



Believing he was simply exhausted, Verena cupped his soft head and stroked it gently, letting him embrace her however he wished.



A soft buzzing came from her pocket moments later.


Isaac,however, showed no sign of letting go, keeping his head against her and his arms snug around her waist.



Not wanting to disturb himn, Verena let him stay as he was, reaching into her pocket to pull out her phone.After a glance at the screen, she answered, "Gavin,what's going on?"


Gavin's voice came through. "You remember asking me to look for a good plot in Shoildon for the hospital you're planning? I found one. Come by when you're free and take a look."



Even though Gavin was no longer serving as Verena's assistant, she still relied on him out of habit and briefly forgot he no longer held that role.


Gavin, still eager to be of help thanks to all he'd learned from her, had volunteered himself to track  down a suitable site for the hospital.


Surprise flickered in Verena's eyes. "I honestly thought it'd take ages. You really found one this fast?"


Gavin answered with a playful tone, "Of course. You know who mentored me."



Verena let out a soft laugh. "You can't flatter me like that. I don't deserve it."


Some background noise buzzed through the line, but soon faded, making it clear Gavin had stepped away for a quieter spot.


He came back on the line. "The site's picked, so just let me know when you want to see it. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call. I have to get going for now."


Verena gave a small nod."Alright,thank you."


"Don't mention it," Gavin answered her with a warm smile.


The call ended quickly, and Isaac had caught every word.


He looked up at Verena. "So, you're planning to open a hospital?"


Verena didn't try to conceal it and gave a nod. "Since  I've returned from abroad, it's time to bring the medical team here."



Isaac fell silent for a moment, his gaze turning thoughtful. "Building a hospita takes a lot of work.Have you managed to get all the permits? I could have Jacob help you out. If there's anything you need,just let him know."



He watched her with hope in his eyes, wanting to be involved.



Verena smiled despite herself and ran her hand through his hair. "I appreciate it, but there's no need.Gavin has already taken care of everything."


She sounded so cheerful and carefree, her smile shining, but to Isaac it felt like something sharp had just pierced his chest.


He blinked hard, feeling a heat rise behind his eyes,so he pressed his face back against her, hiding any sign of his pain.


A quiet moment passed before he finally nodded,offering a weak smile that faded before it reached his eyes.His words came out strained. "Alright, I get it."


Isaac often resented this part of himself, aware that ever since meeting Verena, his heart had grown more delicate and easily shaken.  Some days,he was certain Verena loved him.



But other days, it felt like she only cared for him,never truly needing him.


The idea that he might be disposable crept in,threatening to unravel all the confidence he had built.


That realization broke through the fragile sense of security he'd built, leaving his heart unsteady and leaving him uncertain about what to do next.


He never wanted Verena to notice these feelings.


He worried that she would tire of having to handle his emotions, or worse, decide she needed to leave altogether.



So Isaac kept it hidden.



Breaking the silence, Verena suggested, "Isaac, let's head to the medical room."



Isaac understood what she meant and loosened his grip on her,answering softly, "Alright."


Inside the medical room, Verena supported Isaac as he eased onto the bed.



She began by gently performing a treatment session on his legs, and then carefully applied her own herbal remedy below his abdomen. While she sat nearby, Verena watched every reaction in his body, making sure nothing went unnoticed.


Once the treatment finished, she made careful notes in her notebook, documenting the results.


A bright smile spread across her face as she turned to him. "Isaac, today's session was just to reinforce the recovery of your sex function. The last treatment for your condition was the final round. Your sex function has made a full recovery." she announced, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Do you know what that means?"



A puzzled look crossed Isaac's face as he tried to understand her words.


Leaning closer, Verena lowered her voice, her gaze fixed on him. "It means you can enjoy a normal sex life now."



That simple truth hit lsaac like a wave, stirring his heart in a way he couldn't hide.


A quiet smile touched his lips as he reached up,his thumb tracing the soft curve of her cheek. "Is that true?"


Maybe he was asking her, or maybe he just needed to hear it out loud.Thinking he might be doubting himself, Verena quickly reassured him. "Absolutely! You're fully recovered.Hmm..."



She didn't get to finish, as Isaac's lips captured hers.


Seeing the longing in his eyes, Verena returned his kiss, her arms slipping around his neck, deepening the connection between them.



That simple gesture sent heat racing through Isaac,lighting him up inside.


With a firm but gentle grip, he pulled Verena onto the bed,drawing her closer.


She lay beside him, cheeks flushed and eyes shining with unshed tears.



Isaac moved in for another kiss, but she stopped him with a soft hand on his cheek.



Confusion flickered across his face, mixed with the slightest hint of disappointment.


Verena's smile turned playful, her voice gentle and sweet. "Isaac,I really like you doing this to me."


Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and her lips curled into a teasing grin.
###Chapter 153 Repeat What You Just Said
Isaac caught the glimmer in Verena's gaze, a trace of longing that stirred something deep inside him.


Only when their closeness erased the distance between them did he feel certain that Verena's affection was genuine.


Yet certainty wasn't enough; what he craved was to be the only one who occupied her heart at every moment.



His thumb brushed against the corner of her lips as he whispered, "Leave out the last four words."


A look of confusion crossed Verena's face. "What are you talking about?"


Leaning closer until the bridge of his nose almost touched hers, Isaac spoke in a low rasp. "Repeat what you just said, but drop the last four words."


The meaning dawned on her then. He wanted to hear the sweetness again, and she didn't mind giving it.Slowly,she enunciated each word. "Isaac, I really like you." As those words echoed in his mind, he wished with all his heart that she would mean them for the rest of their lives.



His hand tilted her chin upward before he pressed his mouth to hers.



Her breath soon grew uneven, and when he noticed,Isaac drew back slightly.


Verena inhaled deeply to steady herself, but he pulled her close once more.



Her body gave no resistance to his closeness.


Her fingers slid into his hair, weaving through the strands with an intimacy that made his pulse race.


When Verena was with someone she cared for, no amount of time ever felt like enough.


The white blouse she wore hung open at the top,several buttons undone, leaving her neck and collarbone exposed.



Isaac's lips traced across her skin, leaving faint marks along her collarbone.


As his lips drifted lower, he paused, his fingers brushing against the small "I" tattoo etched there.


From the very first time he noticed it, he had made a  habit of shutting his eyes during their intimate moments, choosing to pretend it didn't exist.


Confronted with it once more, Isaac realized he could no longer deny the truth staring back at him.


Could the "I" tattooed on her skin really stand for lvan?


His throat constricted as the word slipped out in a low murmur."I."



Gathering the nerve, he fixed his eyes on hers and asked, "Do you honestly love that letter so much?"



Verena's lashes fluttered, her expression softened,and she seemed entirely absorbed in the moment.


She leaned close to his ear and whispered with deliberate weight, "It's the one I cherish most."


Isaac's jaw tightened,his fists curling hard, and then he crushed his mouth against hers with sudden force.


The abruptness drew a startled gasp from Verena,though soon her body responded instinctively to his fervor.



He pressed harder, claiming every breath she tried to take.



The intensity became too much, and Verena pushed against him with a small effort. Her resistance only fueled the storm inside him,jealousy flaring hot, his eyes burning red as his control wavered.



The possessiveness he had tried to cage surged out,and he gripped her as though he could never let her go.


She softened within his arms, tilting her face to place a tender kiss on his chin.


A sudden vibration cut through the air. Buzz... Buzz...


Breath ragged, lsaac raised his head and asked between gasps, "Do you want me to end the call?"


Her chest rose and fell quickly, and she gave a small nod. "Alright."


Even as she reached for the phone, Isaac's arm stayed firm around her waist, his lips brushing against her ear in a lingering touch.



The screen lit up with the caller's name, and Verena hesitated,worried Ivan might be calling for something urgent. Turning to lsaac, she murmured, "Wait a second. I need to answer my friend first."


The name "Ivan" flashing on the screen made Isaac's eyes darken with jealous fury. Without hesitation, he snatched the phone from her hand and powered it off, his expression hard and unyielding.


Verena parted her lips to protest, but Isaac buried his face against her neck and murmured, "You told me to hang up. Once you decide on something,you shouldn't take it back."



Realizing she had contradicted herself, Verena gave a small nod. "Alright, I won't go back on my word."


Isaac's head pressed more firmly against her skin, his hold unrelenting.


Sensing a shift in his mood, Verena slid her hands to his waist, trying to lift him.


His arms closed tightly around her, but his legs remained unmoving.


The effort to roll over seized his body; what was effortless for most felt like scaling a sheer cliff for him.No matter how hard he pushed, his legs refused to obey.



Frustration poured over him in a freezing wave, his cheeks swelling with strain, the veins on his arms standing out like cords. That sense of helplessness wrapped him in suffocating silence, stealing the very air from his lungs. Even in the heat of desire, the simple act of turning exposed every weakness he wished to hide.



Understanding his struggle, Verena moved quickly,flipping him onto his back as though to take control herself, but Isaac stopped her.


"Don't." His lashes fell, and the tremor in his voice betrayed him. "We should wait until my legs recover.I can't stand the thought of you seeing me so powerleSS."


Her heart ached for him, but she knew words would do little to ease the sting of his pride.



Instead, she pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead and whispered with a faint smile, "There's no need to hurry.Once you're healed, we'll have all the time in the world."







At Shoildon Primary Hospital, Katelyn sat upright in bed, a magazine resting across her lap as a nurse carefully checked her injured arm.


A sudden knock on the door drew her attention, and when she looked up, her eyes brightened at the sight of Waldo standing in the doorway.



Once the nurse finished wrapping Katelyn's wound,  Waldo stepped into the room.



Knowing Waldo had summoned Verena to the station after his last visit, Katelyn quickly asked, "Officer Collins,how is my case progressing?"



Waldo's gaze carried weight as he answered evenly,"There's no evidence linking Verena at the moment.The street cameras were sabotaged and remain unrepaired, so the trail of proof has gone cold."



Katelyn's brows knitted together as she murmured,"How could that happen?"



With a stern face and sharp eyes, Waldo responded,"Katelyn, I need answers. According to Wendell Branson, you used threats against his family to force him into lying, making him say you were Evelyn. He has now formally accused you of endangering his safety. Do you admit this?"


At his words, Katelyn lifted her eyebrows slightly.She had already anticipated the police would summon Wendell.



The fact that Wendell wNould betray her secrets didn't surprise her in the least.



She understood that the police didn't actually care about whether she was Evelyn, so she chose not to conceal it. Keeping her composure, she answered,"That's true, I'm not Evelyn. But Officer Collins,  there's no law against pretending. I only asked him to help me build a false identity. Threats were never involved."



Waldo's brow furrowed as his unwavering eyes bored into her. "Then explain why he agreed to cooperate."


A quiet laugh escaped her before she said, "The answer is simple. He took payment. Cash, jewels,treasures from auctions-his pockets were full. If you don't believe me, send your people to search Wendell's home."



Her lips curved faintly in satisfaction as she spoke.


She congratulated herself for planning ahead, bribing Wendell's foolish son and greedy daughter-in-law long before this moment.



After a pause, she released a measured sigh. "Even after I gave him so much, Wendell still chose to betray me. It must be because Verena offered him new incentives. Officer, you need to judge this carefully. Wendell insists I threatened him, but it's Verena's guards standing outside his house. I never stalked him or laid a hand on his family. Don't let yourself be deceived by his lies."


Years of experience had taught Waldo to distinguish lies from truth, yet without solid evidence,his hands were tied. His piercing gaze stayed locked on Katelyn as he warned, "I expect your claim is true-that you haven't endangered anyone. If I discover otherwise, I won't overlook it. And as for the one who plotted the attack against you, we will uncover the truth."


After delivering those words, Waldo turned on his heel and exited the room.


The moment the door clicked shut, Katelyn reached for her phone on the bedside table and dialed a number.


When the call went through, Kaia's eager voice rang out."Katelyn, is there something you need me to do?"


A calm smile touched Katelyn's lips as she answered,"Yes, Kaia, I have something important to tell you."


Curiosity sparked in Kaia's tone. "What is it?"


"I was ambushed," Katelyn replied smoothly, her smile unwavering. "And it was Verena who orchestrated everything."


Kaia's voice shot up in shock. "What! Are you certain it was Verena? Katelyn, just say the word and I'll take revenge for you!"


"No, Kaia. I don't need retaliation.What I need is your help with something only you can manage." Kaia answered without pause, "Then tell me. What should I do?"



"I want you to find a reason to get close to Verena,"Katelyn instructed, her voice firm yet gentle. "Stay under her roof if possible. Watch her carefully and learn who she keeps closest to her."


Her eyes narrowed as she spoke, a flicker of calculation glinting beneath her calm exterior.


Verena, it seemed, was proving to be a far more formidable opponent than Katelyn had imagined.


Deep down, Katelyn suspected Verena carried a secret she was desperate to keep hidden.
###Chapter 154 Visiting Verena
Kaia no longer shrank away from seeing Verena.Revenge remained her driving force, and disguise was a role she wore with ease.



With a tone full of confidence, she assured Katelyn,"When I apologized before, Verena forgave me without hesitation. Don't worry, Katelyn. A small trick is enough to make her soften again."


Though Katelyn had little faith in Kaia's cleverness, she knew Kaia was still the most suitable person to approach Verena.



Pressing her lips together, Katelyn answered, "I'll wait for your success."


After ending the call, Kaia stepped out of her room.


In the living room, Laura was watching television when footsteps echoed from the staircase.


When she glanced up and spotted Kaia with a handbag in hand, she asked with curiosity, "Kaia, are you going out to meet some friends?"



The trauma of Kaia's disappearance had left Laura wary;now she made a habit of checking in whenever her daughter planned to leave.



From her spot near the staircase, Kaia glanced at Alec,who sat behind his newspaper, seemingly lost in the day's headlines. She hadn't forgotten how much Alec valued Verena's status. His satisfaction had been clear when Kaia suggested mending fences with Verena.



With a bright tone and a practiced smile, Kaia called out, "Mom, I'm not seeing friends tonight. I'm going to Verena's, and I might stay over a few days."



Laura paused in surprise, trying to figure out when Kaia had grown so familiar with that problematic Verena.After thinking it over, though, she decided it might actually be a good thing. No matter what happened,Verena's status couldn't be ignored, and keeping closer ties with her could only work in their favor.


Deciding to support the idea, Laura returned the smile."That's nice. You girls deserve a chance to catch up as sisters."



"Wait, you're spending a few days with Verena?" Alec put aside his newspaper and stood up, his face showing mild surprise.



Kaia caught the faint surprise in his eyes, yet she could tell he approved of what she was going to do.



She nodded quickly and said, "Yes. Verena has been back for a while, but I hardly ever got to spend time  alone with her. I know I hurt her a lot in the past,and now that she's finally forgiven me, I want to make it right. Just like Mom said, it's time for us to catch up as sisters."



Alec's smile softened as if a weight had lifted. "I'm glad you're thinking like that. You and Verena share the same blood. No fight can ever erase that bond.If you stand by each other, then when trouble comes,neither of you will face it alone."



Rarely did Alec show this kind of warmth.For once,he looked like a genuine father, gently guiding his daughter toward love and loyalty.



Kaia,however,understood the real reason behind his smile. He longed to reach out to Verena himself, yet pride kept him from doing it, so he counted on herto bridge the gap.


Still, she kept that thought to herself. Instead, she gave a polite nod and said, "I understand, Dad.I've always remembered what you've told me."


After a short pause, she brightened her smile. "Dad,Mom, I'll be out tonight, so don't worry about making dinner for me."



Her determination sharpened as she thought of the task Katelyn had entrusted to her.


Just as she moved toward the door, Alec called out, "Kaia..."



The ongoing troubles with the club had left him cornered, unsure of how to move forward. However,Kaia's plan to visit Verena and stay for a few days hinted at a shift in their relationship. Should Kaia succeed in gaining Verena's support or speaking favorably for Willis Group, the balance of the situation with the club could finally lean in their favor.



But Alec's pride stood in the way, making it impossible for him to ask his daughter outright for help.


As his daughter,Kaia could read his thoughts with ease.


She offered a gentle smile and said, "Dad, I'm your daughter, and I'm part of the Willis family. I've always thought about what's best for us. I know the club troubles are weighing on you, but trust me. I'll do my best to talk to Verena and ask her to ease up on Willis Group."


Even without speaking their full minds, both believed they understood exactly what the other wanted.



Kaia left the Willis Villa and set off toward Verena's home.







When Rhonda informed her of Kaia's arrival, Verena's mouth curved into a sly smile. The last visit had been  full of tearful apologies and begging for forgiveness.This time, she wondered what sort of trick Kaia had prepared.



Verena pushed her papers aside, slipped into a coat,and headed down the stairs.



By the time she reached the bottom step, Kaia was already inside, tugging a silver suitcase across the floor.



Kaia looked up, her face breaking into a bright smile."Verena!" she caled out warmly.



The sweet tone sent a shiver down Verena's back.Pulling her coat a little tighter, she forced a casual smile and asked, "What's with the big suitcase?"


Kaia strolled over and slipped her arm through Verena's. "We've got a short holiday break," she said cheerfully. "My school club is holding aget-together near here, so I thought I'd stay with you for a few days.And I figured you might be lonely, rattling around this house by yourself, so I came to keep you company.You don't mind, do you?"


Her voice rang wit sugar, the kind that made her sound like an innocent little sister doting on her elder.



Inside, Verena scoffed. The whole point of that school club event was to build friendship,yet Kaia had shown up here. There was no doubt she had another  agenda.



Verena didn't buy for a second that Kaia came just to ease her loneliness.



A thought struck her, and her gaze sharpened.If Kaia's earlier vanishing act had anything to do with Katelyn,then this visit reeked of Katelyn's orders. The reason was plain enough-Kaia had been sent to spy on her.And if that was the game, Verena decided she would make sure there was more than enough for Kaia to report back.



Thinking that,Verena let her lips curl into a faint smile.She looked at Kaia and gave a small nod. "Of course.Stay as long as you want."



Kaia hid her smirk, mocking silently how quickly Verena had swallowed the act. She had expected it to take more work.



Kaia steadied her tone, put on a sweet smile,and said,"You really are the best, Verena."


Verena slipped her arm free and said calmly, "Rhonda,take Kaia's bag upstairs and prepare a room for her."



Rhonda gave a quick nod before hauling the suitcase up the stairs.



A ringtone chimed from Verena's coat pocket. Verena checked the screen, and Kaia angled her head as though she might catch a glimpse. A second later,Verena locked the phone screen.



Kaia quickly looked away, acting as if she hadn't noticed at all.



Even so, Verena caught the little move.



She gave a faint smile and remarked, "I need to return this call upstairs. Make yourself comfortable here."


Kaia nodded like an obedient child. "Okay," she said softly.


Verena walked into her study with the phone and dialed Ivan's number.


Ivan picked up right away, his voice full of mock drama. "My darling Verena, you really ignored me.I'm crushed."



Verena laughed, recognizing his teasing. "I couldn't answer earlier. Someone was around, and it wasn't the right time."



She changed the subject and asked, "Were you able to take care of what I asked you to do?"


Ivan answered with smug pride, "Of course I did. It was child's play. I've already sent the restored video to  your email."



Verena smiled with satisfaction. "Perfect. Thanks for that. I'll look at it right now."



After hanging up, she grabbed her mouse and pulled up her inbox.


The footage slowed, and a gray car appeared on the screen. Out of nowhere, a black car swerved in front,cutting it off.


The black car rammed the gray one, forcing it into a sharp U-turn. But the moment it turned around,several other cars moved in from behind, closing the trap.



As the video neared its end, a man dressed in black stepped out of one of the cars. His build and features didn't look like anyone from Akoitha or the nearby regions.



Verena froze the screen when something caught her eye and zoomed in closer.


A dark blue tattoo stretched across his right arm, its design unfamiliar.



She snapped a screenshot and forwarded it straight to her detective friend, Samuel Perez.


Her hands flew over the keyboard. "Samuel, I've hit a  problem. Can you dig into this tattoo and tell me what it represents? Thanks."



His response arrived almost instantly. "Leave it to me."

###Chapter 155 Bitter Feud Between Two Brothers
Kaia sat downstairs in Verena and Isaac's marital home,suspicion stirring inside her. What kind of call required so much privacy that Verena had to retreat to her room to answer it?



She was set on uncovering whatever hidden truth Verena was trying so hard to keep quiet.


With her curiosity getting the better of her,Kaia crept up the stairs, quietly trailing Verena to the second floor.



The moment the study door closed, Kaia pressed her ear close, hoping to pick up something,anything. To her annoyance, not a single sound made it through the thick door.



Kaia furrowed her brow, surprised at how well the door blocked out noise.


She leaned in, pressing her ear closer to the door,hoping to catch even the faintest sound.



Right as she did, the door swung open from the inside.


Verena stood there,her lips lifting in a sly, mysterious  smile. "Were you just trying to listen in on my call,Kaia?"



Kaia froze mnid-turn, but quickly smoothed her features and returned Verena's smile. "You've got the wrong idea, Verena. I just wanted to talk to you, but when I got here and realized you were on the phone,I figured it was better to wait downstairs until you finished."



Verena's eyes lingered on Kaia, the corners of her mouth hinting at amusement. It seemed Kaia's ability to make up stories had improved, if only slightly.


Playing along, Verena nodded. "Alright. Go ahead.What did you want to say?"



Unbothered,Kaia replied, "Dad knows I came here today,and he asked me to check in about the club issue."



She hesitated briefly before going on. "Verena,we're both Dad's daughters, and with everything happening at home, we should be helping each other,right?Could you talk to lsaac and ask him not to give Dad a hard time?"



Kaia adopted the perfect image of a dutiful daughter,though her real feelings were far from caring.



In truth, she half hoped Alec would stay in trouble longer, since she had always hated his double  standards.



Alec only saw her as a pawn, so she felt no need to bend over backward for him.



Verena had no doubt that Alec would send Kaia to negotiate.


With a smnirk, Verena replied, "That's a decision I can make myself."


Kaia blinked, momentarily caught off guard. She hadn't expected Verena to offer Alec any help.Wasn't Verena supposed to be too spiteful to lend a hand?



Kaia started to say more, but Verena's voice turned slow and cool. "But I don't owe him anything. After what he did to me, he can't expect any favors. I've never been known for mercy. If someone chooses to go against me, they'll soon regret it."


Back when Laura and Kaia forced her out of Willis Villa,Alec never spoke up for her.


When Kaia spread lies about her, Alec stayed silent.


On her wedding day, when Kaia slandered her, Alec offered no defense.



Alec now wanted her to set aside all the pain he had caused, act as though none of it ever happened, and  still defend him.



Why should she even consider it?



Every word Verena spoke carried a message meant for both Alec and Kaia.



Kaia took a moment to process the meaning behind those words, and then forced a stiff smile. "Alright, I'lL let Dad know what you said."



Just as Verena was about to shut her door, another thought crossed her mind. She paused and, with a voice both cautioning and instructive, said, "One more thing. I don't want anyone waitingoutside my room while I'm working.If you need me, wait until I come out. And if you're bored, you can always catch a movie on the third floor."



With that, Verena shut the door firmly behind her.


Anger tightened Kaia's features as she glared at the closed door.


A cold snort escaped her, and she muttered, "Who do you think you are? Just wait, your downfall is coming."



...


Known for his knack for digging up secrets, Samuel got back to Verena in less than five hours. The first thing he said was, "Evelyn, the man backing the tattooed guy isn't an ordinary person."


Looking confused, Verena asked, "Who could it be?"



He responded with a question, "Do you know about Smoothdeed Group?"



Verena paused to think before replying, "It's one of the top players in both domestic and international finance.The founder,Maxton Fairclough,built it from the ground up and made quite a name for himself with several remarkable achievements."



After a brief pause, she asked, "Is this connected to him somehow?"



Samuel replied, "No, not Maxton. It's his younger son,Erick Fairclough."



Verena was familiar with the founder's legendary reputation, but knew little about the rest of the family.


"Erick Fairclough," she repeated, her eyebrow arching in confusion. "I don't know him at all. Why would someone like that want me dead?"


Samuel had gathered plenty of details and explained,"Earlier this year, Maxton suddenly fell into a coma.When he finally regained consciousness, he was gravely ill, and no doctor could determine what was  wrong. His condition quickly deteriorated after that,leaving him bedridden and almost in a vegetative state.He has two sons and several daughters. Under normal circumstances, given his health, he should be preparing a will. His elder son, Tobin Flairclough, has always been the child he favors, and many believe there's a strong chance the company would have been passed down to Tobin. In other words, if Maxton had recovered and written a will, Erick likely wouldn't have received much, certainly not as much as Tobin.However,their father slipped into a coma before he had the chance to draft a will, and without one, the inheritance would automatically be split among all his children. That's why Tobin immediately began searching everywhere for a skilled doctor to save their father, but no one was able to help him. Even more strangely, a few of those doctors died under mysterious circumstances on their way to treat him."


Samuel paused, and then continued, "My research points to Erick being behind those deaths. He didn't want his father waking up. If Tobin tried to bring you in for treatment, Erick would have found out and decided to target you, just as he did the others. Right now, you're the doctor most likely to succeed in helping their father."



Hearing this,Verena's eyes darkened thoughtfully. "So it's a bitter feud between two brothers over the family fortune." Over the line, Samuel cautioned, "Erick is relentless.He never lets loose ends remain. Don't take him head -on."



Verena answered with a cool, steady voice, "I'l stay cautious. For now, my identity is still under wraps.That should keep me safe."


He agreed, "I'll forward all the detailed information to your email. I won't keep you any longer."


Verena thanked him. "Thank you,Samuel."



After their call ended, Verena spent a moment in thought, and then called Julianna.


Julianna answered and asked, "Evelyn, do you need something?"


Verena got right to the point. "Julianna, can you check if Tobin Fairclough ever reached out for my help while you were running the hospital over the past six months?"



Tobin Fairclough was the older sonin question.


Julianna paused. "Give mea second, I'll look into it."


After a brief pause, Julianna's voice came through the receiver. "Yes, Evelyn. He reached out to you earlier this year, but since you were busy then, I turned him down politely on your behalf."



Verena responded, "Give me his contact information."


Julianna replied, "Of course."



The moment their conversation ended, a new message from Julianna popped up on Verena's phone,displaying Tobin's number.
###Chapter 156 | Just Want To Make A Deal With You
Verena saved the phone number, pausing as she stared at the string of digits, a sly little smile tugging at her lips.



The Faircloughs held considerable power overseas,and Verena was well aware she couldn't see the full extent of the forces supporting Erick from the shadows.Confronting Erick head-on seemed reckless;instead, she decided to use the leverage of his older brother, Tobin, to keep Erick's influence in check.


With her plan in place, Verena pressed the call button.


Meanwhile, across the ocean, Smoothdeed Group's senior management gathered deep into a business meeting.



Just outside those doors, Tobin's assistant noticed an incoming call from overseas.


The number flashed on a device reserved only for Tobin's closest associates and family. Not wanting to keep the caller waiting, the assistant answered immediately.



The assistant put on his best professional tone and  said, "You've reached Tobin Fairclough, General Manager of Smoothdeed Group. May I know who's calling?"



Verena's brows knitted together at the sound of the young man's voice. Samuel's intel described Tobin as a seasoned executive, and this didn't match what she expected.



She asked directly, "And you are?"



The assistant responded without missing a beat,"This is Javier Rogers, Mr. Fairclough's assistant."


That answer seemed to satisfy her,at least for now."Alright, Mr. Rogers. I need to speak with Mr.Fairclough directly. Can you put me through?"


Javier kept his tone courteous as he explained, "I'm afraid Mr. Fairclough is in a meeting at the moment.If there's anything you'd like to pass along, I'll be sure he gets the message."



Choosing not to introduce herself right away, Verena remained vigilant. Despite speaking to Tobin's assistant, she couldn't shake the suspicion that Erick might have planted someone close enough to overhear every word.



Keeping things vague, she replied, "You can let Mr.Fairclough know that Willis returned his call.He's tried to reach me several times, and I finally had a moment to get back to him. Please let him know after his meeting."



Javier responded with polite assurance, "Understood.I'll make sure MMr. Fairclough gets the message."



Moments later, the door to the conference room swung open.


Tobin stepped out, and Javier hurried over to mneet him."Sir, you just got a private call. The person on the line said it was urgent..."



Without waiting for the rest, Tobin stopped him with a terse gesture, his expression dark. "Save it for later.There's something I need to handle right now."


The sudden interruption in the meeting had been caused by unsettling news from Tobin's secretary that his father had suffered a sudden medical emergency and had briefly lost his vital signs. The shock had left Tobin no choice but to abandon the meeting on the spot.



Noticing how anxious Tobin was, Javier thought better of pressing further and simply kept pace behind him.



After Maxton's collapse, Tobin had arranged for a private medical facility inside the family estate,ensuring his father would always be within reach of professional care. By the time Tobin reached the estate, the family's live -in doctor greeted him with an update. Only five minutes earlier, Maxton's condition had stabilized, and his vital signs were back to normal.



Relief washed over Tobin as soon as he heard the news.


Despite wanting to stay longer, Tobin knew the company needed his attention. He offered a few gentle words to the unconscious Maxton before leaving for the company.


On the drive back to the office, Tobin sank into the car seat and shut his eyes as he replayed the day's events and the tasks waiting for him. Then Javier's words about an important call sprang into his mind.


He opened his eyes and asked, "You mentioned an important call earlier. Who was trying to reach me?"



Javier handed him the phone, glancing toward the back seat. "The caller introduced herself as Willis, and she sounded like a young woman."


Taking the device, Tobin watched in silence as Javier quietly raised the privacy partition in the car.



A slight crease formed on Tobin's brow. A young woman,calling his private line? He studied the unfamiliar number in the call log,unable to remember ever speaking with anyone fitting that description. Still, considering the exclusivity of his private number, he suspected it could be a matter worth his attention.



A brief pause lingered before Tobin finally made up his mind and dialed the number back.


The call went through, but he kept quiet, choosing not to say a word at first.


Breaking the silence, Verena spoke up. "Is this Mr.Tobin Fairclough?"


The unfamiliar sound of a woman's voice made Tobin bristle wwith suspicion. "Who is this?" he demanded, his tone tight.


A subtle smile touched Verena's lips when she picked up on his hesitation.


Without hesitation, she answered, "I'm Evelyn Rowe.Half a year ago, you contacted my assistant about helpoing your father."



Tobin's entire expression changed at the mention of Evelyn. Surprise and anticipation rushed into his voice."Wait, are you really Evelyn?"



Verena confirmed it with a calm, steady tone. "Back  then, my assistant was busy handling everything because | was caught up in other obligations. I couldn't respond personally, so my assistant turned you down on my behalf. Now that things have settled on my end, I wanted to reach out myself."



Hearing that, Tobin's urgency became obvious. "So you're saying you'll take my father's case now?Whatever you ask for, it's yours. As long as you can help my father recover, I'll make it happen."


While Tobin pleaded, Verena looked outside her window, her gaze cool, a sly smile flickering across her face.



She replied, "There's nothing I want for myself. I just want to make a deal with you."


Tobin hesitated, clearly surprised.′′Adeal?"


A hint of intrigue colored Verena's voice as she continued, "I'll forward you a document. Everything you need to know will be there."


Seconds later, a message arrived on Tobin's phone with the promised document attached.



As Tobin tapped on the file, a video began to play: a fleet of black vehicles boxed in a lone gray car. He immediately recognized the tattoo on one of the men -Erick's subordinate, unmistakable even from this angle. The call remained open, and Verena broke the silence."Your brother's men were actually after me.Unfortunately, someone else got caught in the crossfire."



Rage flushed across Tobin's face; his grip on the phone tightened until his knuckles stood out,veins pronounced.


Barely containing his fury, he snapped, "I knew he'd do anything for money, but I never thought he'd go this far! He actually tried to have our father killed!"



Clearly uninterested in family drama, Verena kept her tone cool. "Tell me, Mr. Fairclough, did you never think it odd that every doctor you called was either in a plane crash or a mysterious accident the very next day? Isn't that a little too much of a coincidence?"



Tobin's pulse pounded at his temples as the realization hit him, the color risng in his face.


Verena added, "So here's what I want: I'll treat your father, but only if you remove the danger hanging over my head."



Turning to the window, Tobin's eyes hardened, his voice cold. "You have my word. If you save my father,I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. No one will dare threaten you again, not while I'm here." A faint, knowing smile touched Verena's lips. "Then let's hope this partnership works out for us both,Mr.Fairclough."
###Chapter 157 A Trip Abroad
Once Evelyn's identity was confirmed, Tobin didn't waste a second and asked what mattered most."Evelyn, is there any way you could come soon to start my father's treatment? His condition has gotten worse, and we're running out of time."



Rather than answering right away, Verena took a moment to think. "Mr. Fairclough, could you send me your father's previous medical records first? I'll look them over and then decide."



Quick to respond, Tobin said, "I'll send everything right now."


No sooner had the call ended than Tobin's email arrived in Verena's inbox.



Returning to her desk, she opened the new message.



Verena studied Maxton's medical records with care,weighing every detail before reaching a firm conclusion. Confidence settled over her as she became convinced that the surgery stood a strong chance of success.



Lately, she had spent countless hours immersed in surgical experiments, and by now, wielding a scalpel came to her as naturally as breathing.



Certain that she could take on the case, Verena picked up the phone and called Tobin back.



As soon as the line connected, she spoke. "Mr.Fairclough, I've reviewed all the records. I'm almost completely sure I can help your father. I'm still in Akoitha, though, so I'll need to leave tomorrow morning."



Tobin could hardly contain himself. The moment he heard her words, he leapt from his chair. "That's wonderful news! I'll get my assistant to book your ticket right away."


Anyone could see how much this meant to him. His gratitude nearly spilled over.


How could he not feel overjoyed? He had spent so much time seeking out countless renowned doctors,yet none had shown absolute confidence in treating his father's illness, and a few had even met with unfortunate accidents on their way to the Fairclough family residence.



Hearing confidence from a physician at last brought immense relief.



If another doctor had said as much, Tobin might not have believed it. But coming from Evelyn,he trusted every word. With a faint smile, Verena said, "But here's the problem.Your brother has managed to sabotage every doctor you've brought in for your father. That means he's got someone close to you,keeping tabs. If we want to keep things safe, we'll need to get creative."



For a long time, Tobin had guessed that Erick planted a spy in his inner circle, though he'd never found proof. He frowned. "So what should we do?"


Verena's eyes narrowed as she came up with a plan."You need to spread a rumor-say that your girlfriend from Akoitha is flying in to visit. Let the word slip through your friends. That'll make your brother relax and keep my arrival off his radar."


Tobin's reputation meant he wasn't exactly a stranger to attention from women, especially since his wife's passing, and no one would be surprised by the news.


After thinking it over, Tobin nodded. "Alright, let's go with that. Once my assistant has your flight sorted, I'll have the details sent straight to you. I'll also get someone to help spread the rumor."


A soft smile crossed Verena's face. "I'll count on you for both, Mr. Fairclough."


Later that night, Isaac returned home after a long day at work. He took the elevator upstairs, and when he entered the bedroom, his eyes landed on a packed suitcase by the bed.



Surprise flickered across his face just as Verena stepped out of the closet with a stack of clothes in her arms.



When she spotted him, she greeted him with a smile."You're home."



Isaac's brow creased as he glanced from the suitcase to her. "Where are you headed?"



Verena carefully folded the clothes and tucked them into the suitcase, and then sat down on the sofa across from him. "Isaac, I have something important to take care of overseas. I'll probably be gone about a week."



Hearing her mention a trip abroad made Isaac's heart lurch.



If he remembered right, Verena's first great love was living abroad.



A troubling thought hit Isaac-was it possible that man from her past had contacted her?



Worry came through in his voice as he asked her several questions. "Why do you need to go abroad? Is there someone waiting for you? Can I come along?"



He didn't try to hide his anxiety, every question tumbling out one after the other.



Verena paused, weighing the situation. Taking Isaac along would be impossible if she was pretending to be Tobin's girlfriend, soshe shook her head. "I'm sorry,Isaac. I'll have to handle this one alone."



She thought for a moment about how much attention the Fairclough family attracted. Anything that happened would likely get noticed by the press,even overseas.



Worried that foreign media could expose the news about Tobin's girlfriend, she considered the risks carefully. While domestic attention on overseas reports was usually low, she knew people in the same business circles would certainly notice, and there was no guarantee that Isaac wouldn't hear about it.


So,rather than keep him in the dark, Verena decided to be honest. "Isaac, I'm going to meet someone important, but I can't go as myself. I'll be using a different identity for this trip. Ifany strange news pops up, don't believe a word of it, and please don't jump to conclusions. Will you promise me that?"


For a moment, Isaac simply watched her, his eyes clouded with too many emotions to name. He finally nodded, his voice low. "I promise. Just be careful."



No matter what he said, Isaac couldn't quiet the fear that she'd see her old flame-the one she could never seem to forget.



First loves had a way of haunting people, and that thought lingered as he remembered the small letter tattoo beneath Verena's collarbone.



She'd once called it the one she cherished most, and the memory only made his heart ache more.



Letting go of something that important wasn't easy,not for anyone.


Restless thoughts chased him through the night,keeping sleep out of reach.



Around seven, Verena was up and getting ready.


When she stepped out of the bathroom,she saw Isaac propped up against the headboard.


She crossed the room and settled next to himn,her bare feet making no sound. "Did I wake you?" she asked quietly.



He reached out, wrapped her in his arms, and traced gentle lines along her hair. "I never really got to sleep,"  he said softly.


Verena's mouth curled into a playful grin. "Let me guess-you're too miserable without me to rest, is that it?"



This time, Isaac didn't dodge her teasing. He looked her in the eye, all seriousness. "If I said yes, would you let me come with you?"



The question took her off guard for a second, and then she leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. "Not this time. I really do have to go alone.Please just stay here and wait for me to come back,alright?"


Then a thought struck her, and she quickly added, "Oh,by the way/, I was so caught up with packing last night that I forgot to mention it. Kaia is staying at our house now. I have a feeling Katelyn sent her, so make sure Rhonda keeps an eye on her."



A hint of irritation crossed Isaac's face. "Why not just tell her to leave?"



Verena let out a light laugh. "Pushing her out wouldn't solve anything. I'd rather keep her close and figure out what she's really after."


Seeing the time, she knew she had to hurry. She stood up and grabbed her suitcase. "I should get going or I'll miss my flight. Take care, okay?" She was heading toward the door before Isaac could say a word.



He reminded himself there was work waiting and pushed his worries aside, making himself rest for a couple more hours.



When he opened his eyes again, Jacob was already waiting in the hallway. Isaac let him help into the wheelchair, got ready for the day, and headed downstairs by elevator.
###Chapter 158 Girlfriend



Kaia had already taken her seat at the dining table by the time Isaac made his way downstairs.



Her eyes flicked past him, searching for Verena, but she only found Isaac and the house staff.


She put on her sweetest smile. "Isaac,is my sister still asleep?"


Isaac guided his wheelchair toward the table, refusing to look her way or acknowledge her question, as though she wasn't even there.



Tryinng to hide her discomfort, Kaia forced her lips into another smile and turned her attention to Rhonda."Rhonda, are you not going to call my sister for breakfast?"



Rhonda came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of toast. "Mrs. Bennett left early this morning. She took her suitcase with her," she answered.



The news caught Kaia off guard. She pressed for more."She left? Did she say anything about where she was headed?"



Rhonda gave a small shake of her head. "She didn't  tell us."



Katelyn had specifically told Kaia to keep tabs on Verena,yet somehow Verena had managed to leave right under her nose.



Frustration rose up, and Kaia's voice lost its friendly edge. "You didn't even think to ask her where she was going?"



Rhonda froze for a moment at her sudden outburst,silently thinking that this young ladyfrom the Willis family was stepping far over the line;even Verena herself would never treat her this way.



Still,since Kaia was Verena's sister, Rhonda kept her composure and answered respectfully, "It isn't our place to question Mrs. Bennett's affairs."



Still not satisfied, Kaia tried again. "But you must have some idea,right?"



A hesitant look crossed Rhonda's face. "Honestly, I have no clue..."



Isaac, growing irritated by Kaia's persistent questions,shot her a sharp look and spoke in a firm voice."Kaia,your sister agreed to let you stay as a guest, not as a spy. You should learn your place. Keep crossing the line and I won't be so polite."



The sharpness of his words made Kaia stiffen. Admiration for lsaac's background and looks had faded as she had realized what truly counted was something else entirely.



To Kaia, Isaac, with his disability, now seemed like any other man-powerful but far from perfect, hardly deserving of her admiration.


Still,his reputation made her think twice about pushing her luck. Only now did she realize how reckless she'd just been.



The warning stung, but Kaia managed to keep her tone pleasant. "Isaac, you're reading too much into it.I'm just worried about my sister, that's all."


Without glancing her way, Isaac returned his attention to breakfast, quietly eating without another word.


His silence cut deeper than any argument, but Kaia remembered what her impatience had cost her before,and forced herself to swallow her irritation.



She finished her meal without bringing up Verena again.


Once Isaac left for work, Kaia hurried upstairs and reached for her phone, dialing Katelyn in a rush.


The call barely connected before Katelyn's voice came through. "What's going on over there?" Kaia wasted no time. "Verena left this morning,suitcase in hand. Nobody knows where she went."



She hesitated, suspicion creeping into her tone."Katelyn, do you think Verena's planning something?"



Left with a suitcase this early?



Katelyn's frown deepened as she mulled it over, her expression shifting as she pieced things together.


She muttered to herself, "Leaving with luggage probably means she's traveling-and it can't be for something minor."


As the realization struck, a sly smile played on her lips.


If Verena was off on a trip now, maybe she and Isaac had a falling out.



Ever since they'd first met, Katelyn believed V/erena was a poor match for lsaac.



This might finally be the moment their marriage hit a rough patch.



If that were the case, getting close to lsaac would be much simpler.



Even so, Katelyn stayed cautious. Reining in her excitement, she kept her instructions clear. "Just stay where you are and pay attention to lsaac. Wait until tomorrow to see if Verena comes back, and then report to me. And Kaia-don't do anything unless I say so."



After losing to Verena several times, Kaia now thought twice before acting out again. Years of admiration for Evelyn meant she followed her instructions to the letter now.



She nodded several times, eager to please. "Don't worry,K<atelyn. I'll do exactly as you say."







While flying, Verena managed to catch a little sleep.As soon as the plane touched down, she turned off airplane mode on her phone.



A message pinged almost instantly-it was from Isaac,sent just a couple of minutes earlier. "Did you land yet?"


A small smile spread across Verena's lips as she tapped out a reply. "Just got here."



Right after she sent her response, the noise of camera shutters and people talking reached her ears.


She glanced up to see a tall, broad-shouldered man making his way through the crowd. Although his hair was streaked with gray at the temples, there was no denying his good looks and presence. Thanks to the photo Samuel had sent, Verena recognized Tobin immediately. She slipped her phone into her bag,raised her hand, and called out, "Tobin,over here!"



Tobin had never met her face to face, but before boarding, she'd told him she'd call out to him once she landed.



He stopped in his tracks when he heard his name,surprised to find a young woman waving at him.



Even with sunglasses and a mask, her poise and the shape of her figure made it clear she was young and attractive.



So this was the elusive, much-taked-about Legendary Surgeon-a woman, and a striking one at that.



Tobin could hardly believe it, but he kept hisreaction hidden.



He put on a warm smile, stepped over, and slipped an arm around Verena's shoulders. "Sweetheart, I've been waiting for you forever."



The sound of cameras intensified as reporters pressed closer.


One shouted above the noise, "Mr. Fairclough, is this your girlfriend from Akoitha?"



Someone else piped up with another question. "Mr.Fairclough, your wife passed away three years ago.This is the first time you've gone public with a girlfriend. Are you worried about how your children will take it, or do you see yourself making this official?"



Instead of answering, Tobin shot a quick look at his assistant.



Javier picked up the cue, stepping forward to address the press. "I'm sorry, but we can't answer those questions right now. Thanks for understanding."


With no further response, the reporters had to settle for snapping more photos, hoping to catch something newsworthy.



They trailed Tobin and Verena all the way to the car before finally giving up.



Settling into her seat, Verena looked out at the crowd still snapping pictures and turned to Tobin. "You really know how to handle the press. That's some serious business skill."



Tobin watched the cameras for a moment before focusing on her. "Word's already reached Erick. He's waiting at the house for a spectacle. Aren't you the least bit concerned all this attention could blow your cover?" Meeting his gaze, Verena gave a confident smirk. "I'm not the type to take risks unless I know the outcome.By the time your brother figures things out, your father will be out of danger."



The pride in her voice fit her perfectly, adding to her presence.



Tobin couldn't help staring, and Verena caught him.She shot him a sideways glance and teased, "Didn't anyone ever teach you it's rude to stare?"


With a small, amused grin, Tobin finally looked away."I just didn't expect Evelyn to be so young."



Verena just smiled, letting the compliment hang in the air. "Hard to explain over the phone, isn't it? So, tell me more about your father. Anything strange happen recently?"



His initial surprise faded as Tobin explained his father's sudden collapse and what followed.



They talked as the driver pulled up to the Fairclough family's garage.



Getting out, Verena noticed the prying eyes watching them and slipped her arm into Tobin's, playing up the image.



Anyone looking on would think they were truly a  couple.



The Fairclough home looked like something from a storybook-a grand house nestled against green woods and overlooking wide, rolling meadows. The place radiated calm and quiet beauty.


As Verena stepped inside with Tobin, she found herself in a grand dining room where a man in his thirties sat at the end of a long table.



His dark suit was perfectly pressed, sharp features set in a constant scowl, and the way his narrowed eyes sized up the room gave him a menacing edge.



Erick watched their approach, drawing out his words as he spoke. "So this is the woman who's caught my brother's eye. I get it now-she's definitely easier on the eyes than those girls he used to date."



Verena had already taken off her sunglasses and mask.



Tobin's brow furrowed at the sound of his crude and disrespectful words, and he gave a stern warning "Erick, mind the way you speak."



But Erick wasn't finished poking at him. He let out a mocking laugh. "What, getting protective already?You must be falling hard,Tobin."



Tobin didn't take the bait. He simply said to Verena,"This is my younger brother, Erick." Verena greeted Erick with a soft smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fairclough. I'm Verena Willis."


Erick only offered a brief, dismissive look and stayed silent.



Guiding Verena to a seat beside him, Tobin turned gentle. "That flight must have worn you out. Let's get you something to eat first," he said before asking the staff to bring out food.



While thestaff moved around them, Erick couldn't keep his eyes off Verena, a flicker of suspicion in his gaze.


He broke the silence. "I've got a question for you,Miss Willis."


She glanced up, meeting his stare. "Go ahead."



He searched her face. "My brother hasn't even set foot in Akoitha this year. When exactly did you two cross paths?"



Unfazed, Verena let a teasing note slip into her answer. "Who says you have to meet face-to-face to get close these days? There's the internet for that.Tobin and I met online, and after talking for months,we just clicked. It felt right, so here we are."



Her eyes sparkled with the excitement of telling the story,cheeks pink like a girl caught up in her first romance. "You wouldn't believe how he started chatting with me. The real surprise? I had no idea he was the influential Fairclough family's eldest son. If I'd known, I'd never have had the nerve to answer his first message."



Erick watched her act the part of someone totally out of place in an upscale home, and any suspicion he had started to fade.



To him, Verena seemed like nothing more than a pretty distraction for his brother-someone harmless,maybe even a little naive. He figured he'd been too quick to doubt her.



A smirk tugged at his lips. "Spare me the romance stories. I'm not interested in hearing about you and Tobin."



Once the meal ended, Tobin turned to Verena. "Let's go see my father," he suggested.


Erick assumed his brother just wanted to bring a woman to comfort their ailing dad. He didn't think much of it and let them go.



While they strolled through the hallway toward the back of the estate, Erick's assistant leaned in close and spoke in a low voice. "Would you like me to have someone keep an eye on them?" Erick didn't take his eyes off the pair as Verena clung to Tobin's arm, pausing here and there to take in the grand paintings or marvel at the fine porcelain.


In his mind, she fit the role of an outsider dazzled by wealth and luxury.


He gave a soft, dismissive laugh, a trace of sarcasm in his eyes. "She's just a pretty face. Not worth the trouble."



Hearing that, the assistant stepped back and dropped the subject.
###Chapter 159 | Know My Place
Tobin guided Verena toward the rear of the estate,where they were met by a spotless white building gleaming in the sunlight.


Stepping inside, Verena noticed it resembled an ordinary hospital-only here,the extravagance spoke of wealth poured in without hesitation.



In the spacious ward, a celebrated local physician-entrusted solely with the care of Maxton-was in the middle of a physical examination, while a nurse quietly refreshed the vases of flowers.



At Tobin's arrival, the doctor lifted his head and offered a polite nod. "Good day, Mr. Fairclough."



Tobin returned the courtesy before asking, "Dr. Smith,how is my father's condition today?"



Britton Smith gave a weary sigh and slowly shook his head."The same as always. No sign of improvement."



The weight of those words darkened Tobin's face,sorrow clouding his expression.



Sensing his despair, Verena discreetly squeezed his  wrist, urging him to steady himself. He then said, "Dr.Smith, this is my girlfriend. I'd like her to spend some time talking with my father. Would you all step outside for a moment?"



It was a request that carried reason, and Britton found no grounds to object. He inclined his head. "We'll be right outside. If anything happens, Mr. Fairclough,simply use the call bell by the bed."


With that, he gestured to the nurses, and together they left the room.



Moments later, the door clicked softly shut.


Verena released Tobin's arm, turning to grab the nearby medical devices. "I need to perform a thorough examination on your father. Keep an eye on the door for me."



Obedient to her words, Tobin moved to the doorway,his anxious gaze never leaving her.


Verena slipped on a stethoscope, every line of her face marked by focus as she examined Maxton carefully.



Ten minutes later, she set the equipment back in place and gave Tobin a steady nod.



He rushed to her side, nerves straining his voice."Well? Can you cure him?" Verena's reply came with firm assurance. "I can."



Her tone lit a spark in him, a flicker of hope blazing into joy. He seized Maxton's hand with trembling excitement. "Dad, did you hear that? You'll wake up soon-you'll get better."


But Verena tempered his elation with calm words."Although your brother has momentarily set aside his doubts about me, he is a man who trusts no one. To guard against trouble, we must carry out the confidential procedure as soon as possible."



Tobin understood. Until his father truly awoke, nothing could be revealed to Erick.



He clasped Maxton's hand tighter, whispering with resolve, "Don't worry. It won't be long."



Not wishing to stir suspicion by lingering too long, the two concluded their visit and quietly left.



Meanwhile, in Shoildon, Stevie had arranged a swim with friends, but one by one they declined.Frustrated,he decided to swim alone. After a few laps, boredom crept in, and he climbed ashore.



Stretching out on a beach chair, he picked up his phone to tackle some overseas work.


 
No sooner had he unlocked it than a notification leapt   across the screen.



The headline shouted, "The First Appearance of the Mysterious Girlfriend of Tobin Fairclough."



"Tobin Fairclough?" Stevie frowned,perplexed.



He had never met Tobin, but his reputation was familiar enough.



Wasn't he always painted by the press as a grieving widower, devoted to his late wife and untouched by romance?



Who could possibly change that tale?



Curiosity burning, Stevie tapped the article.



The images within nearly sent him tumbling from his chair.



He stared at the photos, his jaw slack with disbelief.


The woman leaning on Tobin-though masked and wearing sunglasses-bore a figure and mannerisms that were unmistakably known to him.



It was Verena.



The report even carried a short video, which Stevie played with trembling fingers.


There, a woman in sunglasses waved at Tobin, and he  responded with endearment, calling her,"Sweetheart."


Stevie felt his world tilt. If the photos had left a sliver of doubt, the voice erased it.



Drawing in a sharp breath, he exclaimed, "Impossible!How could Isaac's wife be there?"



And worse-foreign media declared her Tobin's mysterious girlfriend.


Sensing something gravely amiss, Stevie wasted no time.He forwarded the news to Isaac and immediately called him.



The moment the call connected, his voice burst out in haste. "Quick! Look at the message I just sent!"


Isaac, baffled, asked, "What's going on?"


Nearly shouting,Stevie pressed, "Just check it! Your wife is being taken right under your nose!"



Isaac, unsettled, opened his laptop and clicked on Stevie's chat window.



A foreign tabloid article?



His brows drew together as he followed the link.



While Isaac kept silent, Stevie urged anxiously, "Did you see it? Did you?" Isaac's throat tightened, but his voice remained calm."Yes,I saw."



For a moment, Stevie was stunned-then burst out,"Are you serious? Your wife is holding another man's hand, being paraded as his girlfriend, and you sit there calm as a monk? Love must have blinded you."



A faint pang tugged at Isaac's heart as he stared at the photo,yet he held on to composure.He remembered Verena's words before her departure-she would need a false identity abroad.



Though confused, he chose to trust her.



"It's not what you imagine," he said softly. "Verena warned me beforehand. Her identity there is a mask,nothing more. I know this, so set your worries aside."


Stevie, however, couldn't fathom it. What man would watch quietly as his wife clung to another?



Skepticism laced his tone. "You're sure about that?Not just bewitched by love?"



Isaac allowed himself a faint smile. "I'm not the fool you take me for. I trust her."


With that, Stevie could only concede. "Fine. I've passed on the news. What happens next is between you two." 
Isaac thanked him, and the call ended.



Silence wrapped around Isaac's office.



His eyes lingered on the photo, shadows flickering in their depth.



He turned his phone in his hand, weighing his thoughts,before finally making a call.



Verena had just stepped out of the Fairclough family's hospital when the device buzzed in her hand.



She glanced at the caller ID, her lips curvingfaintly,and then pressed to hang up.



Hearing the tone of disconnection, Isaac froze in disbelief, his brows furrowing.



As he reached to dial again, a message appeared on his screen. "I'm being watched right now and can't talk on the phone."



His tension eased slightly, and he typed back, "I saw the news report from abroad."



Verena marveled at how swiftly the press moved, yet she feared Isaac might stilI harbor unease.



Patiently,she explained, "Isaac, this is what I warned you about. I must pretend to be close to Tobin,fooling his brother in order to reach my goal." Meanwhile,Erick, noticing Tobin and his girlfriend had yet to return, walked toward the hospital at the back of the estate, suspicion stirring in him.



Crossing the back garden, he spotted them at last.



Tobin lingered behind, issuing orders to the servants,while the woman in front was busy on her phone,her eyes sharp and alert. She seemed different from the naive girl from earlier.



Even as she typed, Verena sensed someone approaching.



Without betraying it, she slipped the phone away and lifted her head.



A smile appeared on her face as she stepped forward,her tone almost eager. "Erick, are you here to visit your father as well?"



Erick ignored her question, his eyes narrowing as he sneered, "Don't act like we're close. My brother's interest is nothing more than a passing fancy. You'd better play the role of a companion and not dream of climbing into the Fairclough family."



Catching the edge in his words, Verena answered gently, "I assure you, I see things more clearly than you believe." His frown deepened, suspicion flashing in his gaze as though her mask had slipped.



When he was about to speak, Verena smiled ingratiatingly and added, "I know my place. I'm aware of the gulf between a companion and a wife. If what I seek can be gained easily with the title of a companion,why would I make life difficult by reaching for more?"
###Chapter 160 Strategy



Seeing that Verena seemed to know her place,Erick shot her a sideways look. "Glad you get how things work."



Inwardly, he scoffed at himself for ever being suspicious.



He figured women like her were just chasing wealth and had no reason to hide anything deeper.


All it took was a small reward to keep them happy-and they were never any real trouble.







With Erick's doubts behind them, Verena and Tobin headed to the hospital for another visit with Maxton the next day.



They sat side by side at his bedside. As Verena leaned in for an exam, lifting her hand as if to check Maxton's eyes, she caught the sensation of being watched through the glass panel on the door.


She looked down and changed course, resting her palm gently on Maxton's shoulder instead.


She deliberately raised her voice, her tone full of regret. "I always heard stories about Mr. Maxton Fairclough's business success, but never expected to meet him like this. He has such a kind look-what a shame, for someone so good to end up here. I hope he wakes up soon."



Tobin didn't understand why she suddenly sounded so sentimental, but when he caught her glance, he realized there was an audience.



He played along, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Don't worry. Dad's strong. I'm sure when he finally wakes up and meets you, he'll be thrilled to have you join the family."



From outside, Britton listened to the exchange, some of his earlier suspicions slipping away.



He stepped inside,letting the door close behind him.



Hearing someone enter,both Tobin and V/erena turned to see who it was.



Britton walked over with an easy smile and said casually, "Mr. Fairclough, I've noticed you've been coming to the hospital quite often these past few days. It's clear you care deeply about your father's condition. If he were aware of this,he would surely feel comforted."



Tobin placed a gentle arm around Verena. "Before he got sick, Dad always told me to move forward and build a new life. Now that I've found someone, I bring her to see him. I hope hearing our voices will bring him back."



Britton gave Verena a quick glance, catching the shy smile she offered, and then nodded. "With so much love around him, I bet your father will pull through."



Tobin managed a hopeful smile. "We can only wait and see."



Britton's eyes lingered on Maxton before he spoke again. "It's important not to overstay during each visit.Too much excitement could slow your father's recovery.So,Mr.Fairclough-"



A flicker of realization crossed Verena's face. Britton's rush to send them off spoke volumes; she pegged him for one of Erick's people almost instantly.



No real doctor would lurk outside just to eavesdrop on the family's conversations.



Tobin gave a polite nod. "Dr. Smith, I'm trusting my father to your care."



Britton kept his professional smile. "Of course, that's my responsibility."



With that, Tobin and Verena headed out.



As they walked, Verena slipped her arm through his  and spoke in a low voice meant just for him. "That doctor works for Erick. We'll need to steer clear of him when it's time for surgery."



Tobin turned,stunned.



He hadn't realized he'd let one of his brother's men get so close to their father.



The thought sent a chill through him. Without his decision to put security cameras everywhere, Erick might've already tried something.



Although anger simmered beneath the surface, Tobin maintained a gentle facade for the prying eyes and kept his voice light. "So what should we do now?"



Verena lowered her eyes and played the part of a bashful girlfriend, answering softly, "Let's get back to your room. I'll tell you thee."



From a distance, the gardeners spotted the two huddled close and assumed it was just another sweet couple moment. They wisely chose to stay away and give them privacy.



Once they were back in Tobin's suite,Verena wasted no time. "Did you already arrange for the equipment and the surgical team I'll need?"



Tobin already understood why she had come and had taken steps in advance. He had told his assistant to  prepare everything and deliver it. "They're on their way now; it won't take long," he said.



No sooner had the words left his mouth than a knocking sound came at the door.



The two looked at each other briefly before Tobin called out, "Who's there?"


A voice replied from the hallway, "Mr. Fairclough, it's Javier. I brought the documents from your office."


He made sure to stress the word "documents."



Tobin nodded. "Just leave them in my study, thanks."



As soon as Javier walked away, Tobin turned to Verena, excitement shining in his eyes. "Everything's set for the surgery now. All that's left is to actually do it."



Verena spoke up. "We have to deal with Dr. Smith first."



She reached for her small medical kit and pulled out a thin, silver needle. "I'll put you to sleep with this.Once you're out, I'll call Dr. Smith in as a distraction and slip away to your father's room for the operation.The effect wears off pretty fast, so when you wake up,you need to keep him busy no matter what. Stall for as long as you can, and don't let him leave until I get back." Tobin's eyes fell on the silver needle she held, and with firm resolve he said, "I understand you. I'll make sure to buy enough time for my father's care."



Verena guided him onto the bed, and once he was settled, she started inserting the needle into his arm.



Within minutes, Tobin was fast asleep.



She stashed her medical kit and hurried toward the door.



Her rushed footsteps drew a servant, who stopped her with a worried look. "Miss Willis, is something wrong?"



Verena gripped the woman's shoulder, her voice urgent. "Find Dr. Smith-quickly! Tobin just lost consciousness. Go get him, now!"


The servant's eyes widened. "I'll fetch him right away!"



She bolted off toward the hospital wing.



A short while later, Britton showed up with his medical kit.



He leaned forward slightly and asked, "How are things looking?"



Tears brimming in her eyes, Verena shook her head."I have no idea. We just finished a walk outside, and as soon as we got back, he collapsed. Dr. Smith, please help him-check on Tobin!"



Britton remarked, "I'll need everyone to step out.I have to check on Mr. Fairclough alone."



He waited for the room to clear, and then closed the door behind him, leaving the others lingering in the hallway.



With the crowd distracted, Verena used the commotion to quietly slip away.


Moving quickly, she made her way toward the hospital wing.



Erick got word and rushed home from the office.



Despite any issues he had with Tobin, family drama called for a united front when it mattered.



He climbed the stairs to Tobin's room and found the door shut tight. Turning to a nearby staff member,he asked, "What's happening in there?"


The servant replied with careful respect, "Dr. Smith is inside checking on your brother. We're waiting out here for news,sir."



Erick's eyes scanned the area, searching for any sign of Tobin's girlfriend.



A frown creased his face as he asked, "So only my brother and Dr. Smith are in there?"



The servant gave a firm nod. "That's correct."



A flash of realization hit Erick, and his expression hardened. Without another word, he spun around and hurried toward the hospital. The moment he reached the stairwell, a wall of Tobin's bodyguards stepped into his path.



Recognizing their faces, Erick's voice rose in anger."You're blocking me? My father's in danger, and there's a threat in this house. If something goes wrong,it'll be on your heads. Move!"


But the bodyguards stood their ground, showing no sign of backing down.
 ###Chapter 161 | Have The Perfect Scapegoat
Erick's eyes flashed with suspicion. "So you really think you can stop me? Listen, the woman my brother brought back has completely vanished, and anyone can see she's up to something shady. If anything happens to my father because of her, every one of you will be held responsible. I can't just sit back and let her get away with it. Are you honestly going to stand in my way?"



Without hesitation, one of the bodyguards replied,"We have strict instructions from our boss. Nobody is allowed near the hospital today."



Only then did it click for Erick that he'd walked right into Tobin's setup.



These bodyguards weren't amateurs. Erick might be able to handle one or two, but facing this many,he wasn't about to do anything reckless.



Even with Erick's own group of loyal men and his significant influence in the underworld, he was outnumbered at the moment.



Just as he reached for his phone to call for backup, a guard from behind snatched it out of his grip. "Shit!" Erick muttered as he lunged to reclaim his phone, only to have several guards slam him to the floor and pin him instantly.



"If you have any urgent business, Mr. Fairclough,you can make your calls later," the bodyguard said coldly.



Meanwhile,inside Tobin's room, Britton had no idea about the chaos erupting outside. He sat next to the bed,feeling uneasy.



Tobin had passed out from sheer exhaustion. After giving him the necessary meds, Britton expected him to wake up soon.



Yet,more than thirty minutes ticked by, and there was stilI no sign of Tobin waking up.


Even though Britton worked under Erick, he knew he'd be blamed if anything happened to Tobin. Erick wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice him to keep the peace with the rest of the family.



Britton got up, planning to ask a servant to keep an eye on Tobin while he ran to the hospital for some extra injections.



But as soon as Britton started moving, Tobin, who had only been pretending to be unconscious, quickly called out, "Dr. Smith." 
"You're awake, Mr. Fairclough," Britton said as he turned to Tobin and helped him sit upright.


With a trembling voice, Tobin pretended to be frail."Dr. Smith, what happened to me? Why do I feel so weak?"



Britton calmly explained to him what had happened,and as soon as Tobin heard about his sudden collapse,he clutched Britton's arm, eyes wide in panic. "How could I just pass out like that? Is it something serious?Am I going to end up stuck in bed like my father? Dr.Smith,you have to help me!"



Panic was written all over Tobin's face.



Britton offered some reassurance. "You don't need to worry, Mr. Fairclough. You collapsed because you pushed yourself too hard. Get some proper rest, and you'll recover quickly."


Still on edge, Tobin asked him, "Are you sure? Please,double-check everything."



His obvious anxiety left Britton with no choice but to perform another detailed examination.







Elsewhere, Verena had made her way to Maxton's room and slipped right in with the surgical team Tobin  had arranged.



Even though Britton was temporarily held back,Verena understood that Erick would never leave only a single doctor to oversee Tobin.



She was certain extra eyes were monitoring the situation. The remaining people might call for backup,and she feared the situation could spiral beyond her control.



Driven by panic, she hurried through the surgical preparations.



Nervous sweat formed along her hairline, soaking into her mask.



Drawing in a silent breath, Verena blocked everything else out, channeling all her concentration into guiding the scalpel with steady hands.



A sudden noise from the hallway, a shuffle, and then the faint patter of approaching feet, snapped her focus.



Verena tightened her jaw, thrown off by how quickly the interruption came.



Nervous sweat pooled along her hairline, dripping down. Her palms were wet beneath her gloves, making the scalpel even harder to control. Still,Verena centered herself, determined not to let the tension in the corridor shake her hands.



She was nearly finished with the procedure.All she needed was a handful of minutes more.



The footsteps outside grew louder, picking up speed as they neared.



From the increasing noise, Verena guessed that several people were converging right outside the room.


Any sudden intrusion would ruin everything she'd worked for.



That meant she needed to pick up the pace as every second counted now.



Outside the door, the footsteps suddenly stopped.


"Who's inside? Open up now!" Erick demanded,his shout echoing through the door.


Stationed bodyguards replied, "Mr. Fairclough, nobody is allowed inside at the moment."



"Then let's find out if you really have what it takes to keep me out," Erick shot back, signaling to his subordinate.


Without hesitation, the man stepped forward and landed a heavy kick to the bodyguard blocking his  path.



Right then, Tobin's bodyguards surged forward,launching themselves into a fistfight with Erick's men.



A barrage of thumps and the scuffle of bodies slamming against walls echoed through the corridor.


Although the chaos outside intensified, Verena's concentration never wavered. Her hands moved with precision, closing the final stitches.



She was so close; only a final touch remained before she'd finish the procedure.



The fight outside left the entrance unguarded for Erick.



Fixing his gaze on the door, he approached it,determined to force his way inside.



Before he could reach for the handle, the door swung inward and Verena slipped out, pulling it shut behind her and cutting off his path.



She looked completely composed, and if not for the beads of sweat at her hairline, anyone could mistake her for a visitor checking in on the patient.


Verena spared a quick look at the guards now lying defeated on the floor, victims of Erick's men. Maintaining her composure, Verena offered a small smile. "Mr. Fairclough, do you realize what kind of uproar you're causing by storming in with an army?Aren't you worried about disturbing your father?"


Erick glared at her, his eyes cold and full of suspicion."Who gave you permission to step into my father's room alone? No one comes near this hospital without the Fairclough family's consent. You know that."


Without waiting for Verena's response, he barked at his men, "She broke into my father's room to do him harm.Take her away!"



Two bodyguards closed in on Verena.


Yet she stood her ground, knowing full well that Erick wouldn't be here if Tobin's people were still in control.



Right now, her best strategy was to buy some time for Tobin to arrive. She could only hope he'd get there soon enough.


Verena folded her arms and let out a soft laugh."Mr.Fairclough, I just finished operating on your father.He'll regain consciousness shortly. Are you really planning to arrest the one person who might save him?Or are you hoping your father never wakes up?"



Their stares locked, tension flaring between them like two blades meeting mid-strike. The moment Verena mentioned Maxton might wake up soon, a dangerous glint flashed across Erick's face.



Only now did he realize he'd completely underestimated her. She wasn't some opportunist but the very doctor his older brother had hired for the operation.



She'd finished the procedure in record time and was now claiming a quick recovery. If Erick's instincts were right, this woman had to be the real Evelyn.



The realization struck him hard that he'd just been outsmarted by Verena and Tobin. Shadows clouded his features as he gave her a chilling smile."You really think saving my father puts you above the rules?Don't forget. He's still unconscious. If anything were to happen, you'd be the first one everyone blames.Honestly, you've made it easy for me. Now I have the perfect scapegoat."



With his mask gone, Erick's threats came out in the open. Verena met his gaze, her lips curling into a smirk. "So this is the real Erick Fairclough, huh? No more playing nice?"


Out of sight, her fingers moved swiftly, sending a silent message to Tobin for backup as they'd planned.



Tobin's supposed arrest at Erick's hands was nothing more than a carefully staged deception. Tobin's team had already been stationed throughout the estate,ready to act at a moment's notice.



Convinced Tobin was out of the picture and his father remained helpless, Erick dropped the act. He was certain the entire estate was now under his control.



Believing he'd already won,Erick felt untouchable.



Noticing Verena with her phone, Erick gave her a disdainful look. "Really? Still hoping Tobin's going to come and rescue you?"



He paused, voice dripping with sarcasm. "My men have already got him locked down. He's in no position to help anyone, not even himself."



Knowing Tobin needed a bit more time, Verena shifted tactics, her tone gentle and almost amused. "Tell me,Mr.Fairclough, are you truly willing to throw your own father and brother under the bus? I have to admit, I'm dying to know, what's your grand plan for Tobin?"



A twisted grin broke out across Erick's face. "If he wants to fake illness so badly, then he can follow my father to the grave."



His cruelty was unmistakable, but Verena didn't back down. "And you're not worried that people might get suspicious if they both vanish on the same day?" A cold sneer played at Erick's lips, his eyes reflecting a deadly resolve. "Everyone in this family will swear that Tobin just slipped into a coma out of nowhere and never woke up. No one will link it to me.And as for my father, the surveillance footage will pin everything on you and your botched surgery. In this household, I decide what the truthlooks like."



He leaned in, the threat plain on his face. "Once my father and Tobin are gone, I'll be the only one left to inherit everything. WVith no one standing in my way, I'll finally-"



"And just what is it you think you're capable of?" A commanding voice rang out from the corridor,cutting through his fantasy.


The sound brought Erick to a halt, and he turned around, panic flickering in his eyes.


At the far end of the hallway, Tobin appeared, leading a squad of armed men straight toward them.



Within seconds, Tobin's team overpowered Erick's guards,seizing control.


Erick's face drained of allcolor,and he stared ahead in shock, barely able to stammer, "No... This isn't happening..."



Tobin strode forward, his voice dripping with contempt. "I never realized you could be this vicious,Erick. But it looks like your evil scheme just fell apart."
###Chapter 162 He'd Been Duped
Tobin showed up with remarkable composure, as though he'd been out for a relaxing stroll instead of facing a life-or-death situation.


Everything that had just unfolded struck Erick like a slap in the face. Only now did he grasp how thoroughly he'd been duped. Tobin's earlier surrender was an act, and the story about Verena being his girlfriend was nothing but a clever ruse. Every detail had been designed to lead him astray.



A mix of anger and anxiety gripped Erick. The thought of Maxton waking up and discovering his betrayal sent a wave of fear through him. If that happened,he wouldn't just lose everything; the consequences would be far worse.



With this thought, his blood ran cold, and his jaw clenched tight. There was no way he could let things end like this.



Desperation crawled up Erick's spine as he racked his brain for any way to salvage the situation.



Right then, an idea suddenly sparked, and a cocky smirk curled at his lips. Lifting his gaze, he taunted, "Impressive, Tobin. You even roped Evelyn into your performance. I'll admit defeat this time, but don't think you can keep me down with just this little trick."



Tobin replied, his tone sharp as a knife, "You're right,I can't bring you down so easily. But you aimed for more than just me today. You went after our father,too. When he wakes up and learns what you've done,do you honestly believe he'll let it slide?"



His gaze fixed on Erick, Tobin continued, "I won't have to lift a finger. Our father will be the one to deal with you."



Even though Tobin made the consequences crystal clear, Erick showed not a hint of fear. A cool grin spread across his face as he nodded. "You're absolutely right. Dad's reputation for being ruthless in business is legendary. If he ever discovers my part in this, I'll be finished."



A shadow crossed Erick's face, and his voice took on a dangerous edge. "But let me ask you, Tobin,are you really prepared for Dad to hear the truth? Remember,your youngest daughter goes to a school that answers to me, staffed with people loyal to me alone. One call from me, and she could vanish without a trace."



On the surface, Tobin's expression barely shifted,but inside, he felt nothing but cold,bitter disappointment.A weary sigh escaped him. "I can't believe you'd throw  away your own family just for the sake of power and money."



Erick responded with a dismissive laugh, "Family means nothing compared to wealth and power! As long as I'mn not the one pulling the strings, I'll always be trapped by someone else. I'd much rather be the one in charge than spend my life being ordered around."



Erick's relentless attitude made further conversation pointless in Tobin's eyes.



"Did you really believe I'd lay a trap without having a backup plan?" Tobin shook his head, a wry smile tugging at his mouth. "Everything was already in place before Evelyn got here, and I was just waiting for you to take the bait. If you want to threaten me with my daughter, by all means, try it. Let's see if a single phone call is enough to make her disappear."



Erick couldn't wrap his head around how Tobin had managed to act so fast. With his desperation mounting,he fumbled for his phone and tried to make a call,clinging to his last shred of hope. The call never went through; the line stayed busy.


Frustration built with each failed attempt. Erick dialed again, refusing to accept defeat, only to be met with the same unbroken silence. His face hardened in an instant. Jaw clenched, he snapped, "I won't let you win. This isn't over."



Tobin's gaze was cold as he watched Erick unravel.Turning to his men, he spoke in a flat, commanding tone. "Erick's lost his mind. Take him away and keep him under strict watch. Make sure he stays put until my father wakes up. We can't risk him doing anything reckless."



His orders were met with a chorus of obedient voices."Understood,sir."



Without hesitation,several burly bodyguards closed in and led Erick out of the hospital.



The rest of Erick's followers were swiftly dealt with,restoring order to the hospital in a matter of moments.



Once calm returned, Tobin glanced over at Verena,letting out a weary sigh. "I'm sorry you had to see all of that, Evelyn."


Offering a gentle, understanding smile, Verena replied,"No family is perfect. Everyone faces their own battles."



Her reassurance struck Tobin as oddly comforting. In his mind, someone as capable as Evelyn must have come from a stable, supportive family, far removed from this kind of chaos. What he didn't realize was  that Verena had already weathered similar storms with Alec's family, and scenes like this barely fazed her anymore.


After exchanging a few more words, Tobin's anxiety resurfaced. "Evelyn, how is my father now? When do you think he'll wake up?"


Verena explained, "The operation just ended, and your father's still under anesthesia. It's hard to say exactly when he'll become conscious, but I'm confident he'll be awake by tonight."


Relief washed over Tobin, the tension melting from his shoulders as he sighed. "That's a huge relief."


Verena laid out the recovery plan for Tobin. She explained, "When your father wakes up, he'll have to remain on strict bed rest for no less than two months.It's important that he stays calm and avoids any unnecessary stress or activity during his recovery. I've already briefed the nurses who helped during the surgery. They know exactly how to care for him,so you can put your mind at ease."


For half a year, Tobin had knocked on the doors of every prominent doctor he could find, each one telling him there was no hope for his father.Hearing Evelyn say that recovery was possible nearly brought him to tears. Standing tall, Tobin offered Verena a deep bow before speaking. "Evelyn, I can never repay what you've done for my father. If you hadn't come along,I'd still be desperately searching for answers. If there's anything you want, say the word. As long as it's within my reach, I'll make it happen."



Verena could sense the genuine gratitude behind Tobin's words, so different from Erick's cold ambition.Maybe it was his status as the favored oldest son, or maybe he truly cared about his father.


With a soft smile, Verena responded, "Actually, there is one thing I'd like you to help me with."


Tobin didn't hesitate for a second. "Just tell me what you need."



Verena responded calmly, "What I'd like is for you to put an end to those entertainment news articles linking us together."



"What?" That answer took Tobin by surprise. He stared at her, realizing she was completely serious.


He blinked, genuinely puzzled. "That's all you want?"



With someone in his position, removing a news story was as easy as making it appear in the first place.



A playful glint flashed in Verena's eyes as she added,  half-teasing, "Naturally, that's not the only thing I'll ever ask for. Favors like these aren't paid off so easily.But since you're determined to repay me, Mr.Fairclough, I won't hesitate to reach out if anything else comes up. For now, though, that's all."



Meanwhile, Katelyn's friend stumbled across the headlines before they were wiped from the web and immediately sent them her way.



"I don't usually keep up with news, but this was everywhere." The friend messaged. "Isn't this woman the wife of the guy you're interested in? How did she get caught up with Tobin Fairclough?"



It was no secret among Katelyn's friends that she liked Isaac. After clashing with Verena and coming out defeated, Katelyn couldn't help but vent her frustration to her friends. She had sent them pictures of Verena and ranted about how much better she was.That was why, when her friend saw the photo in the news,she recognized Verena right away.


After reading the message, Katelyn shot up in bed, a jolt of disbelief running through her.
###Chapter 163 You're Threatening Me For Her
Katelyn clicked on the link, and the moment the story popped up-Verena pictured beside a middle-aged man-a jolt of excitement shot through her,lighting up her entire face with sly,wicked delight.


At last, Verena had served up the perfect scandal on a silver platter.



Katelyn was floored by Verena's boldness. Parading around with another man in public, completely shameless-was she out of her mind?



Did Verena really believe that slipping away to another country for a little adventure would keep her secrets from getting back here?


Katelyn could barely contain herself, eager to watch Verena struggle to explain this mess away.


She was convinced that, after seeing proof like this,there was no way Isaac or Danica would let Verena set foot in the Bennett family.



After a few days of recovery, Katelyn was feeling much better, and the doctor told her she could finish recovery at home starting tomorrow. But patience wasn't he strong suit. She ripped the IV from her hand and ran out of the hospital without even bothering with the discharge process.



Outside,she flagged down the first cab she saw.


Moments later, the taxi pulled up at the gates of the Bennett Mansion.



The housekeeper, busy trimming hedges, glanced up just in time to see Katelyn stride past without so much as a greeting.



"Mrs. Bennett!" Katelyn called, rushing into the house.



Finding no one in the living room, she stretched her neck and called upstairs.



The housekeeper trailed behind, flustered. "Miss Fuller,Mrs. Bennett's resting. Maybe you could wait-"


Katelyn brushed past her, irritation flashing in her eyes."Mrs. Bennett! You have to come down right now.There's something you need to see!"



Danica had barely drifted off when Katelyn's shouting carried up from downstairs.



She tried to block it out, rolling over in frustration, but the noise only grew more insistent. With a disgruntled huff, Danica sat up, her expression  darkening. "That girl is getting bolder by the day."



Grumbling to herself, she threw on a coat and made her way downstairs.



The moment Katelyn heard footsteps coming down,a sly smile flickered across her face.



"Weren't you supposed to be in the hospital? Why are you here now?" Danica asked as she strode over,eyeing Katelyn with surprise.


Without answering,Katelyn grabbed Danica's hand and led her straight to the couch.



"There's something you need to see right now."


She wasted no time, pulling up the news article and shoving her phone into Danica's hands before she could ask any questions. "Read this."



Danica glanced down, confusion etched across her features.



But as soon as she read the headline and saw the photo,her whole expression changed. Her brows drew together in a stormy glare, and anger flashed in her eyes.


"The First Appearance of the Mysterious Girlfriend of Tobin Fairclough..." Zooming in on the photo, Danica stared at the masked woman beside the middle-aged man, her breath quickening. "That's Verena, isn't it? What on earth is Verena doing overseas? And how could she become someone's girlfriend?"



Katelyn watched the fury bubble up in Danica, barely disguising her satisfaction with a forced look of concern. "I thought the same thing. At first, I wondered if it could really be her, since she was so covered up. But the more I looked, the more certain I became-it's definitely Verena."



Katelyn put on a look of sorrowful sympathy. "I just thought you should see it for yourself, in case I was overreacting. Honestly, she must be out of her mind.How could she betray Isaac like this?"



Danica trembled with fury, tossing the phone aside as she snapped, "Out of her mind? She's too clever for her own good! That girl has no respect for this family at all!"



Katelyn flinched at Danica's sudden outburst, quickly dropping her voice in feigned worry. "Does Isaac know yet? Maybe we should hold off on telling him..."



That was enough to send Danica over the edge."Hold off? Absolutely not! He deserves to know exactly what kind of woman he brought into our family-a shameless liar running around with other men!" A flash of cruel delight crossed Katelyn's face. "Got it.I'll forward you the link right now."



Danica sprang from the couch and stormed out,too enraged to remember her manners. Katelyn didn't even get so much as a parting glance.



Alone in the silence, Katelyn stared at the phone Danica had flung aside.



Her gaze lingered on the zoomed-in photo, and that sinister, obsessive smile crept back onto her lips. Her eyes sparkled with a cold, unhinged satisfaction.


This was it. She hadn't even lifted a finger yet, and already Verena's downfall was in motion.



In Katelyn's mind, Isaac had always belonged to her alone.




...



Jacob noticed Danica approaching and made a move to stand, but she swept past him in a blaze of anger,heading toward the CEO's office without so much as a glance his way.


Being Isaac's mother, she outranked everyone; Jacob didn't dare to object or even announce her presence before she burst in. The office door crashed open, slamming shut behind her with a bang.



Isaac was lost in paperwork when the ruckus made him look up, expecting to see Jacob.



He was ready to scold his assistant for barging in, but the sight of Danica's stormy glare made any annoyance instantly evaporate.



He arched a brow, confused. "Mom? What's going on?"



"What's going on?" Danica gave a bitter, sarcastic laugh as she brandished her phone, thrusting the link from Katelyn right under his nose.



"Why don't you take a look for yourself? See what your wife's really been up to. She flew overseas behind your back-just look at this disgrace!"



Isaac eyed the phone she'd dropped on his desk.He recognized the story. It was the same one Stevie had already sent his way.



Realizing she'd misunderstood everything,Isaac met her gaze and calmly explained, "Mom, you've got it all wrong about Verena. I knew about her trip before she left. That article is just a smokescreen for outsiders. None of it's true. She had important business overseas, and I was in on it from the start." "Important business?" Danica snapped, her voice dripping with skepticism. "What could possibly be so urgent? Don't tell me you actually believe she went abroad to cure someone? Sure, she knows a thing or two about medicine, but with so many outstanding doctors abroad, why would someone need her help?And why was a performance needed? That's just a flimsy excuse, and you're falling for it?"



Her temper flared, words tumbling out faster and louder. "And look what she did. She ran off and got cozy with another man! Didn't you see the headline calling her Tobin Fairclough's mysterious girlfriend?Stories like that don't just appear out of thin air. Who would dare write that about the general manager of Smoothdeed Group unless it was true? You've lost all sense. You'll believe anything Verena says, even as she humiliates you for the world to see."



The more Danica ranted, the firmer lsaac's tone became. "I'm warning you, Mom. This is the last time I'll explain. Verena never lied to me. She was upfront about everything from the beginning."



Danica stared at him like he'd lost his mind, her anger practically boiling over. "You can't see what's right in front of you! She's making a fool out of you, and you're still defending her? She's seducing another man in your face, and you're just letting it happen? What kind of hold does she have on you?"  Just then, Isaac's phone buzzed on his desk.



The caller ID showed that it was his wife calling.



He answered, and Verena's gentle voice drifted through the line. "Isaac, everything's settled here. I'll be home tomorrow."



"Great..." Isaac began, but before he could finish,Danica snatched the phone right out of his grasp.


He lunged forward to reclaim it, but being stuck in a wheelchair left him just out of reach.



Danica,having caught sight of the caller ID,tightened her grip, ready to unleash a tirade on Verena.


But Isaac's warning cut through the air. "Mom, if you say anything to hurt her, don't blame me for what happens next."



Danica stopped cold, shock washing over her face."You're threatening me for her?"



Isaac met her glare head-on, his voice steady but unyielding. "Because you're the one trying to hurt her.I've told you again and again, this is nothing but a misunderstanding. Instead of trusting your own son and Verena, you believe some rumor from strangers.If that's how it is, then I have to draw aline." No mother could stand to hear those kinds of words coming from her own son.


Pain flickered across Danica's face; her eyes welled up as she hurled the phone aside and stormed out of the office.



With the tension finally broken, Isaac let out a deep,weary sigh.



The last thing he wanted was for Verena to be exposed to those baseless accusations. He could never truly hurt Danica, bout using such harsh words had been the only way to put a stop to her reckless fury.
###Chapter 164| Will Always Be On Your Side
 Earlier,when the argument broke out, Danica had accidentally ended the call. Once she'd left, Isaac noticed and immediately dialed Verena's number.


"Sorry about earlier, the call dropped by accident,"Isaac said, his tone gentle.



A soft laugh came from Verena's side. "Don't worry about it," she replied easily.



She'd been wanting to bring something up, but Isaac jumped in first. "What's your flight time tomorrow? I'll pick you up at the airport."



His voice was warm, carrying a note of genuine care.


Verena had considered bringing up the earlier incident,but it was obvious Isaac preferred to let it slide. He was trying to protect her from any lingering awkwardness,but with Danica's voice ringing out so loudly earlier, it was impossible for Verena not to notice.



She paused for a moment, and then answered, "I don't have the details yet. Once I get my ticket, I'll send you the info." "Alright, I'll be waiting," Isaac responded, his voice reassuring.



Verena had never been one to dodge difficult topics,so she asked outright, "Did your mom come by to give you a hard time after she read that news article from abroad?"



Isaac hadn't planned on discussing it, but the way she phrased her question left no doubt she'd caught part of his exchange with Danica.



"Yeah, she did." He let out a quiet sigh, his frustration showing. "My mom doesn't know the full story yet.She got upset after reading the news, and no matter how I tried to explain, she just wouldn't listen. Don't worry, though. When you're back, I'll go with you to clear things up. She's not totally unreasonable. She's just reacting to the shock of the news. Once she settles down, she won't be so harsh."



The mistrust was understandable. to Verena since she hadn't spent much time with Danica.



Verena kept her tone steady as she replied,"You really don't need to worry about me. I can handle this myself."



Still worried that she might feel hurt, Isaac offered a gentle promise. "No matter what anyone says, Verena,I'll always be on your side." Something inside her softened. In that moment, it almost felt like nothing had changed. Isaac's faith in her was unshaken, just as it had been before his amnesia. Despite everything Danica had said and everything he'd forgotten, he was still the same lsaac:trusting her completely, refusing to doubt her for even a second.



A wave of emotion swept over Verena, and her eyes stung. She couldn't let him carry the burden by himself.



Clearly, asking Tobin to suppress the news wasn't enough; the truth needed to be made public.



She understood that if she tried to clear things up after she returned home, no one except Isaac would be convinced. But if Tobin came forward with an official statement,it would carry real weight.


Danica might never accept her word, but she wouldn't question a public declaration from Tobin.



After all, if she were simply Tobin's romantic partner,he wouldn't have publicly defended her and explained the situation.



Having reached a decision, Verena's lips curved into a small smile as she spoke into the phone. "Thank you for always believing in me, sweetheart. I've got something I need to take care of, so I'll talk to you  again soon."



The word "sweetheart" caught lsaac off guard. His eyes brightened, and a quiet smile played on his lips."Alright, just be careful."


Once the call ended, Verena stepped out of her room,determined to act.



She knew Tobin was still at his family's hospital,so she went directly to the medical wing at the back of the estate. After riding the elevator up,she spotted Tobin waiting alone on a bench at the far end of the hallway.



"Mr. Fairclough," Verena greeted in a polite tone.



Tobin shot to his feet, concern etched across his face."Evelyn, what brings you here? After everything you've just been through these past few days, you should really be resting."



With a warm, reassuring smile, Verena replied, "1wanted to talk to you about something important."



Tobin felt a deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the woman who had rescued his father's life,making him determined to keep their relationship on good terms. He understood better than anyone how unpredictable life could be, and no one was ever truly safe from unexpected tragedy. Even the best ddoctors had failed where she had succeeded, solving a problem others deemed hopeless. Building a strong relationship  with someone of her skill and character was a priority in both his personal and business affairs.



He leaned in, eager to help. "Of course. What's on your mind?"



"About..."



Verena was just about to explain when chaos erupted.A nurse rushed out from the intensive care unit,her voice trembling with urgency. "Mr. Fairclough, there's an emergency! It's your father's vitals; they're dropping once again!"



Shock froze Tobin in place. "What did you say?" he demanded,barely able to process the news.



A wave of uncertainty and worry crossed Tobin's face as he glanced at Verena. Noticing his distress,Verena's brow creased with concern. "Let me check on him," she said calmly.



Without another word, she hurried after the nurse,heading straight into the ICU.



Inside, the monitors showed alarming drops in Maxton's vital signs. Wasting no time, Verena slipped into protective gear and moved to his bedside for a closer look.



It didn't take long for her to spot the problem. Earlier, after the operation, she'd been forced to leave the final steps to her assistant so she could intercept Erick. It seemed likely that Maxton's setback was caused by the rushed and unfinished care he'd received after surgery.



Pulling back the blanket and carefully inspecting the surgical area, Verena discovered a clear sign of infection.



Luckily, the problem was discovered early enough to prevent any lasting damage.



Turning to the nurse, Verena requested tweezers and other tools. Then she carefully cleaned the wound again and applied advanced treatment to steady Maxton's condition.



Verena's quick actions paid off. Soon, Maxton's vital readings on the monitors began climbing back to normal.



Once everything was under control, she peeled off her gown, mask, and gloves and stepped back out of the ICU.
###Chapter 165 Are You Truly Capable Of Curing Isaac
The moment Verena stepped out, Tobin rushed over,his words tumbling out in panic. "How's my father? Is it serious? Evelyn, I'm begging you-please save him."



Verena's composed demeanor seemed to settle the room as she spoke in a gentle tone. "There's a post-surgery infection, but fortunately we detected it early.I've already treated the wound, and his vitals remain stable. However, given his condition, it's unlikely he'll wake up anytime soon."



At those words, Tobin's chest tightened even further,and he asked with rising dread, "Didn't you promise he would be awake tonight?"



Verena gave a quiet nod. "That would have been true if nothing had gone wrong. But now, with the infection,there's no certainty."


His brows knitted together, and he asked, "Then how long before he opens his eyes again?"


After a pause, Verena answered plainly. "It depends entirely on his strength. It could be a couple of days,maybe three, or even a week." The weight of her words pulled Tobin's expression darker still.



When she noticed the strain etched across his face,Verena held back anything else she might have said,knowing he wouldn't hear it now.



Only when Maxton regained consciousness would there be an opportunity to talk about clearing the rumors.



...


Back at the Bennett Mansion, Danica's anger simmered into despair. Her most beloved son, Isaac, had stood against her today-all because of a woman accused of betrayal.


How could he turn on her when everything she had done was for his sake?



The more she relived it, the less she could contain herself, until tears slipped down her cheeks in a flood of bitterness.



Katelyn had been staying at the Bennett Mansion ever since she delivered the story of Verena's supposed affair, lingering there to witness how events might unfold.



When Danica entered the room with tear-streaked  cheeks, Katelyn's brows drew together in suspicion.She rose at once and led Danica toward the sofa with practiced care.



With tissues offered in hand, Katelyn put on a mask of concern,though her tone carried intent. "Mrs. Bennett,what happened? Why are you crying all of a sudden?Did Isaac say something to hurt you?"



Normally, Danica would have kept famnily matters hidden from her. But the weight of her sadness overwhelmed that instinct, and she needed someone willing to listen.



Clutching the tissues tightly, Danica cried out, "I never believed that the son I poured my heart into raising would one day stand against his family because of a woman who betrayed him."



The change in Katelyn's expression was immediate,her displeasure evident. What exactly did that mean?Could Isaac truly be siding with Verena? The thought gnawed at her.



Covering her resentment with practiced ease,Katelyn asked further, "So Isaac doesn't accept the report from abroad?"



As she dabbed her tears away, Danica pressed her palm to her chest and blurted out, "Not only does he dismiss that report, but he also refuses to place any  trust in me, his own mother."



More sobs escaped her as she spoke through the tears."The video clearly shows Verena leaning into that man's arms, yet lsaac insists it's just a misunderstanding. Worst of all, he even threatened me for her sake."



So consumed by grief,Danica didn't notice the shadow passing over Katelyn's face. "And as for Verena, in the beginning I did look down on her because of her family. But with time, after a few encounters, I thought she seemed decent enough. I never imagined she would be so false! Isaac treats her with nothing but love and trust, so how could she repay him this way? But..."



By now, Danica's sobs only grew heavier, her words carrying raw anguish. "Isaac acts like Verena has bewitched him. He refuses to listen to anything I say.Since he won't take my advice, I'd rather step aside.I won't involve myself in their mess anymore!"



The way Danica spoke about lsaac's defense of Verena stirred jealousy inside Katelyn. Why could Verena claim the devotion she had always longed for,while she herself was ignored?



Still, Katelyn had long mastered the art of hiding her true feelings, and she smoothed them over with a mask of concern. Her hand came to rest lighntly on Danica's shoulder as she said, "Mrs. Bennett, Isaac is your son. How can you simply watch while he loses his way? He's only blinded for now, confused between right and wrong, and that's why he dared to answer you so rudely. You can't just abandon him at a time like this. He needs his mother to steer him back."



Danica already knew this reasoning by heart,but she lacked any power to put it into practice.


Through tearful sniffs, she sobbed, "What choice do l have? The moment I spoke a few words against Verena, he threatened me. Isaac is utterly consumed by her. I can't change his mind. Besides, he holds all the authority in the company-I have nothing to use against him."



Her reaction didn't escape Katelyn's notice, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she understood Danica's hesitation. Danica wanted to strike at Verena, but Isaac's threats restrained her.



With her lips curving faintly, Katelyn leaned closer and said with a show of earnestness, "Forgive me for being blunt, Mrs. Bennett, but lsaac only clings to Verena because of what happened to his legs. His pride was shattered, and when she claimed she could cure him,he poured every ounce of hope into her. Think about it-before then, Isaac had never looked twice at any  woman.How else could he suddenly grow so attached to a wife chosen from a marriage alliance?"



Danica felt as though a veil had been lifted when Katelyn laid out her reasoning. Deep down, she knew Isaac was never a man who bent easily to others,nor was he the type to depend so much on a woman.Clearly,his wounded pride and fragile state had driven him to lean on Verena, just as Katelyn described.



Once this truth sank in, her bitterness melted away,leaving behind nothing but anxious concern for her son's future.



"You're making sense. Isaac wouldn't give his heart to someone so quickly. What ties him to Verena is probably the hope she represents."



Noticing that Danica seemed open to her guidance,Katelyn felt a wave of satisfaction and said, "That's why helping Isaac recover the full use of his legs is the only way for him to regain his confidence and eventually recognize Verena's lies."



The thought of Veena once more stirred grief and anger in Danica, and she murmured, "But Verena isn't even in the country right now. Who's left to treat Isaac?"



Katelyn clasped Danica's hand and smiled with deliberate calm. "Mrs. Bennett, remember who l am -I'm Evelyn Rowe.Let Isaac place his trust in me and allow me to perform the surgery. I can guarantee his recovery. When he stands again, grateful and full of life, that will be the chance for us to cut Verena away completely."


Hearing Katelyn assert her identity with such confidence erased the last trace of doubt inside Danica.



Because of the scandal abroad tied to Verena, any trust Danica once had in her had already collapsed.Even though Verena insisted before that Katelyn had fabricated everything, Danica brushed it off as nothing more than a desperate excuse, fearing Katelyn might steal lsaac away.


Once she steadied herself, Danica faltered, and then asked, "Katelyn, are you truly capable of curing Isaac?"



When Katelyn caught the question in Danica's eyes,she realized the woman was tempted, though a trace of hesitation still lingered.
###Chapter 166 | Won't Fail You
With a confident nod, Katelyn replied, "Of course. The cases I handled overseas were far worse than Isaac's.If Verena hadn't stopped me back then, I would've performed the surgery already. By now, he'd be on the path to recovery."


The certainty in her tone eased Danica's doubts,though one concern lingered. "But I can't force Isaac.How will I convince him to let you treat him?"


Reaching into her purse, Katelyn produced a small packet and placedit in Danica's hand. "This induces a brief sleep. It's completely harmless. If you trust me,simply get Isaac to take it. I'll handle the rest."


For a long moment, Danica studied the packet before curling her fingers tightly around it, determination sparking in her gaze.


If this could hasten lsaac's recovery and reveal Verena's true nature, DDanica believed she was prepared to do whatever it took.



Her voice dropped low as she asked, "When do you need me to act?" After a moment of thought, Katelyn replied, "The day after tomorrow. I'll send word in advance."



Other matters demanded her attention before then.



Watching Danica agree so quickly only confirmed what Katelyn already sensed-Danica's hatred toward Verena had reached its height.


That meant, no matter what happened in between,as long as Isaac regained his health after she performed the surgery, Danica would not hold her accountable.



With that assurance,Katelyn softened her expression and spoke gently. "Don't be upset anymore. Trust me.When Isaac walks again, he won't defend Verena the way he does now. It's late, so I'll let you rest."



Danica accepted the reassurance and asked the housekeeper to see Katelyn out.


Once she got in the car, the driver glanced at her reflection in the rearview mirror. "Miss Fuller, do you want to head home or go to the hospital?"



A sly curve touched Katelyn's lips as she shook her head. "Take me to Stellar Restaurant."



Stellar Restaurant had served as the secret meeting place for Katelyn and Kaia. At once, the driver turned the wheel and followed her instructions.



Pulling out her phone, Katelyn dialed Kaia. Their arrangement was simple-Katelyn always spoke first,ensuring no one would suspect anything.



The moment the line opened, she spoke directly. "I've got directions for you. Meet me where we always do."



Kaia replied with a short "Okay." She then ended the call.


Back at Seraphina Villas, Kaia understood that a summons from Katelyn meant another assignment.She changed quickly and hurried down the stairs.


Rhonda, dusting one of the carved columns in the living room, froze when she heard the sharp rhythm of heels and ducked behind it.


As soon as Kaia slipped out the door, Rhonda reached for the landline and dialed Verena's number.


When the call connected, her urgent whisper came through. "Kaia just left. She seemed in a rush."


Verena arched a brow, amusement glinting in her eyes.


So,the restless ones had finally decided to act. It was their turn to move. Her tone stayed light. "Understood. Thank you,Rhonda."





After days of careful watching, Rhonda had already judged Kaia to be nothing good.


She asked hesitantly, "Do you want me to follow her?"


A faint smile touched Verena's lips. "That won't be necessary. Just pretend you know nothing.Wait,and let them show their hand first."



Kindhearted as she was, Rhonda lacked the skill to tail anyone. And lately, Kaia had become more cautious.Verena believed that it was better to leave such work to those who knew how.



Taking Verena's words to heart, Rhonda responded in agreement.



···


Meanwhile, in the quietest corner of Stellar Restaurant,Katelyn arrived ahead of time. A short while later, Kaia rushed inside.



Looking at her idol with worry, Kaia asked, "Katelyn,are you feeling any better now? Does it still hurt at all?"



Though she wanted to get straight to the matter at hand,Katelyn reminded herself that she had to remain flawless in front of Kaia.



Her reply came gently. "The pain stopped once the stitches were in. And once they're removed, I'll be almost completely fine."


Kaia bobbed her head in relief. "I'm glad. I wanted to come see you earlier, but since I'm living at Verena's place, it's been difficult to slip away."



Seizing the moment,Katelyn asked, "How has Isaac been treating you lately? Has he grown suspicious?"


After a pause to think, Kaia shook her head."I don't think so. He's been cold and distant the whole time."



Katelyn's tone sharpened slightly. "Did he say anything about when Verena will return?"


Another shake of the head came, this time with irritation. "When he's home, he barely speaks except to Rhonda. He ignores me completely, eats in silence,and then disappears into his room. From the looks of it,Verena isn't coming back soon."



A faint arch of Katelyn's brow came with a bitter laugh."Whether she returns soon or not makes no difference."



Her voice was so quiet Kaia leaned in. "What was that?"



"Nothing." Katelyn's smile turned smooth as she said, "Kaia, I have something I need you to do."


At once, Kaia straightened, eager to please. "Just tell me."



If not for Katelyn's earlier warning to wait, Kaia would have already tried to deal with Verena herself.


Watching her eagerness, Katelyn's lips curved slightly.The pieces were aligning-only the final move was left.



From her purse, she drew out a neatly wrapped white packet and passed it to Kaia. "When Isaac returns tonight, pour this into his drink."


Taking the packet, Kaia glanced down with curiosity in her eyes. "What is it?"



A sly smile tugged at Katelyn's lipsas she murmured,"It's an aphrodisiac."



Shock flickered across Kaia's face; she hadn't expected Katelyn's fixation on Isaac to run this deep.



Noticing the reaction instantly, Katelyn tilted her chin with pride and remarked, "I told you before-whatever I set my sights on, I'll claim, no matter the cost."



To Kaia, it made little sense. Why devote herself to a man bound to a wheelchair? Yet Katelyn had always been the figure she admired most,so helping her was the only choice Kaia felt she had.



Her head bobbed quickly. "Don't worry. I won't fail you."


After a moment of thought, she added, "Once Isaac takes it, do you need me to do anything else?"


Katelyn gave a slight shake of her head. "Just call me right away. I'll handle the rest."


"Understood," Kaia replied with a firm nod.


When the details were settled, Katelyn dismissed her."You should leave before someone gets suspicious about your absence."



Trusting the advice, Kaia rose and gave a quick wave."Alright, I'm going."




···


In Clokron, at that very moment, a photo appeared on Verena's phone.



The image showed Katelyn with Kaia.


A message followed from Griffin Briggs, a detective,saying, "Kaia met Katelyn at Stellar Restaurant. I saw Katelyn give her something that looked like a packet of medicine."
###Chapter 167 Flip The Table On Them
When Verena read the message, she felt no storm in her heart. She had already foreseen that once Katelyn learned she was abroad, she would seize the moment to act.



Opening the attached photo, Verena studied it intently,her eyes sharp as a blade.



Katelyn, just like her, was a doctor. She had slipped medicine into Kaia's hands, who was now living at Seraphina Villas and could easily approach Isaac.



The intention behind that medicine seemed painfully clear to Verena.



She reached for her phone to call Isaac, wanting to sound the alarm.



But the call never connected.



After a pause to gather her thoughts, she dialed Bobby instead.



He answered at once, pleasantly surprised. "Verena,is this real? You're actually calling me?" A soft chuckle escaped her lips. "Yes, it's me."


Bobby's voice bubbled with excitement. "Isaac told me you were overseas.When are you coming back?Once you return, I'll treat both you and lsaac to a meal."



Moved by his warm sincerity, Verena agreed, "It should only be a few more days. I'll reach out when I return."


The idea of sharing a meal with his flawless sister-in-law had Bobby practically walking on air. "Perfect,then it's settled. You mustn't go back on your word."


Verena laughed lightly before her tone shifted to seriousness. "Bobby, before that, I need you to do me a favor."


He replied eagerly, "Of course, Verena. Just say the word."



Verena explained, "Since Kaia moved into Seraphina Villas, I've been keeping an eye on her. MMy detective just informed me that she met Katelyn, who handed her a packet of medicine. No doubt it's something shady. I tried reaching Isaac, but he didn't answer, so I'm telling you instead."



Hearing that Kaia and Katelyn were working hand in glove, Bobby cursed. "Those two women are truly birds of a feather-brazen enough to scheme against  Isaac! I'll teach them a lesson this very instant!"



As he made to rush out, Verena stopped him,saying,"Bobby, don't be reckless. I already have a plan."


His curiosity piqued, Bobby quickly asked, "What's the plan?"


Verena's lips curved into a cold smile. "Go to Seraphina Villas, but don't interfere with Kaia's actions.Let her believe her scheme is working,and then we'll flip the table on them. Once she slips the drug, find a reason to lead her away. By then, Katelyn should appear, and you can..."


Bobby listened closely, and by the end he was both impressed and proud. No wonder she was his perfect sister-in-law-calm in the storm and able to turn danger into opportunity.



With admiration swelling, Bobby pounded his chest over the phone. "Leave it to me. Don't worry, I'll make sure Isaac comes to no harm."



Hearing his confidence,Verena burst into laughter.







Kaia returned to Seraphina Villas and spotted Isaac's car in the garage-proof of his return.



Inside the living room, she found him seated on the  sofa,absorbed in a financial newspaper.



He didn't so much as glance her way or ask where she had been, and even Rhonda didn't greet her.


A suffocating weight pressed on Kaia; never before had anyone treated her as if she were made of air.



Just as she was about to flare up, Rhonda's cheerful voice rang out. "Mr. Bobby Bennett,what brings you here?"



Kaia turned her head and saw Bobby stroll in, hands buried in his pockets.


She frowned faintly. Why had Bobby come at this hour?



Bobby shot her a scornful glance, and then said brightly to Rhonda, "Just dropped by for a meal and to check on lsaac."



Rhonda chuckled heartily. "Well then, perfect timing.One mnore dish and everything's ready."


Isaac looked up at his brother. "Does Mom know you're here?"



Clicking his tongue, Bobby dropped into the seat beside him. "I'm not a child who reports every move to our mother." Isaac lowvered his head again and continued with his paper.



Suddenly, Bobby seemed to remember something."Hey, is your phone dead? I called earlier but you didn't pick up."



Isaac instinctively reached for his pocket, and then paused before replying, "I left it in the car."


"Oh, I see." Bobby quickly handed over his phone,brimming with fake enthusiasm. "I found a few sneakers I like, but I can't decide. Mind giving me your opinion?"



Isaac's brow furrowed. Bobby never hesitated when it came to spending money, so his hesitation now had to mean something.



Sure enough, when Isaac looked at the phone, a line of text flashed before him. "Verena told me Kaia,under Katelyn's orders, plans to drug you. I'll lead her away later-someone else will handle the rest."



Danger flickered in Isaac's narrowed eyes.


Yet he swiftly masked it, remarking casually,"They're all good.Why not buy them all?"


At that moment,Kaia leaned forward curiously. "Isaac,what are you two discussing?" Bobby quickly pocketed his phone and shot her a dismissive look. "Even if I told you, you wouldn't get it."


Her enthusiasm smothered under a cold refusal, Kaia clenched her teeth but forced out a brittle laugh.



"Dinner's ready," Rhonda announced.



Ignoring Kaia, Bobby wheeled Isaac to the dining table.


Though her stomach churned with frustration,Kaia plastered on a smile and followed.


After dinner, night fell.


As Isaac was about to enter the elevator, he told Bobby,"Stay downstairs for a while. I have some work to finish."



When the doors closed, Bobby stretched out on the sofa,absorbed in a game.



Rhonda cleared the dishes and warmed a glass of milk for Isaac, as Verena had instructed before leaving-knowing warm milk eased his sleeplessness.


From the moment Rhonda began tidying, Kaia's eyes searched for a chance to slip in the drug. But with Rhonda bustling about and Bobby seated in the living room, no opening appeared.



Her patience thinned, until finally Rhonda left the  warmed milk on the counter and disappeared into the restroom.



Kaia's eyes gleamed. From the corner of her gaze,she checked on Bobby-he was sprawled on the sofa,exclaiming now and then, "Awesome!" at his game.



Seizing the moment, she drew out the packet and poured the powder into the milk, stirring quickly to disguise it.


The toilet flushed. Kaia hurried back to the coffee table, lifting a cup of water and sipping slowly as if nothing had happened.



In her mind, the plan was flawless.



What she didn't realize was that Bobby had seen it all reflected on the wall opposite.


Moments later, Rhonda emerged and carried the milk upstairs.



Kaia prepared to follow, but Bobby suddenly stood and called her over.



She froze, forcing a smile. "What is it?"


Bobby feigned urgency, pulling her toward the door."Ah! I nearly forgot something important-just came back to me now!" Irritation flashed across Kaia's face. She longed to hurry upstairs, yet Bobby was dragging her out."What's so urgent?"



"Slater asked me to fetch you," Bobby insisted."Said there's something he needs to consult you about."



Kaia frowned.Slater wanted her advice? Then she remembered Verena treating Barrie. Could it be his illness had returned?



Her voice trembled with curiosity. "Is something wrong with Barrie?"



Bobby hesitated briefly, and then nodded. "Yes, it's about Barrie. Aren't you studying medicine? Go take a look."



Hearing that, Kaia sneered inwardly. So Verena's so-called cure was nothing but a bluff.With Verena gone,she alone could save Barrie.



A smug smile tugged at her lips.


Bobby, watching her, felt disgust coil in his chest. He had never met such a self-satisfied woman.



But the task now was to lead her away. He bundled her into the car and drove off.



Minutes later, Kaia remembered Isaac. By now, he  must have already drunk the milk.


Thinking this, she secretly texted Katelyn before locking the phone screen.


In the rear-view mirror, Bobby caught her movements and smirked. He almost laughed aloud at their foolishness-they were digging their own graves.




...



Katelyn, upon receiving Kaia's message,hurried to Seraphina Villas.


The house lay quiet as she called out, "Kaia?"



No reply.


Her eyes narrowed. Could it be...


She suddenly burst into laughter. Never had she imagined that foolish Kaia, instead of ruining things at the crucial moment,would present her such a gift-clearing the path so she alone could have lsaac.
###Chapter 168 My Answer To Her Trap
Before heading upstairs, Katelyn quietly commended Kaia in her heart and sent her a quick message.


"In two hours,make sure you bring Danica over."


Within moments of sending it, Kaia responded with a brief,"Okay."


Slipping the phone into her pocket, Katelyn started up the stairs.



Since Kaia had already described which room belonged to Isaac, she walked straight toward it.


When she eased the door open, she found the curtains drawn tightly,leaving the space in shadow.


Only the faint glow from the hallway allowed her to see the outline of a man stretched out on the bed.



The sight ofIsaac, the man she had admired for so many years, made her heart race wildly, and color rushed to her cheeks.



Even though she was certain he had taken the drugged milk, caution still lingered, and she moved  carefully,afraid someone might hear.



Once she shut the door behind her, only his dim figure remained visible.



But that indistinct silhouette alone was enough to ignite the emotions she had long suppressed.


Bending close, she stroked his face and pressed her lips against his.


Soon after, desire overtook hesitation, and the night took a different turn.




...


Kaia accompanied Bobby to Slater's residence.


When Slater appeared from the stairs and caught sight of her behind Bobby, his expression tightened."Why did you bring her here?"


His voice carried disdain, yet Kaia chose to interpret it another way. She convinced herself he was only too embarrassed to admit he needed her help after he posted on social media to expose her lies.



Before Bobby had the chance to explain, Kaia spoke first. "Slater, pain in the legs isn't something to overlook. Why don't you allow me to check on your grandfather's condition before it gets worse?" Her poise and warm demeanor caught Slater off guard,leaving him staring for a moment before he blurted out, "What are you talking about?"


For an instant, Kaia looked uncertain, and then quickly composed herself with a smile. "Isn't your grandfather sick?"



Leaping to his feet, Slater jabbed a finger in her direction and yelled, "Kaia Willis, listen to me! My grandfather is in perfect health. Say something like that again, and you'll regret it!"


The words left Kaia stunned, and once she pieced it together,she whirled on Bobby with fury. "You tricked me?"



With a casual shrug, Bobby replied, "Maybe I misheard.My mistake."



Color rushed to Kaia's face, her hand trembling as she jabbed a finger at him. "You!"



The realization struck her hard-Bobby's sudden friendliness had been nothing but a setup to humiliate her.



In a fit of anger, she stormed out without so much as a backward glance.



As her angry figure disappeared, Slater frowned,  sensing that something wasn't quite right.


He turned to Bobby and asked, "What's this about? Did you deliberately play her?"



Putting on an air of mystery, Bobby answered,"Too complicated to explain now. I'll tell you later."


Left fuming with no outlet, Kaia thought about calling friends to drink away her anger, but the reminder that she had to speak with Danica kept her from doing so.



Instead,she treated herself to dessert at a restaurant and,once the time was right, hailed a cab toward the Bennett Mansion.



Inside,Danica was in the middle of a beauty treatment when the maid came to announce Kaia's arrival.Reclining with a beauty device in hand and the television on, she sneered, "What does she want now?"”



Danica had never liked Kaia, and with Verena in the picture, her opinion of the woman had only worsened.


In a respectful tone, the maid explained, "She said it concerns Mr. Isaac Bennett."



That name made Danica's brows knit tightly. "Isaac?"



Though the quarrel with Isaac earlier still stung, Danica couldn't forget he was her son. No matter the rift, a mother's instinct wouldn't allow her to ignore any  news concerning him. And since she was aware Kaia lived at Seraphina Villas, if Isaac's health was somehow at risk...



After thinking for a moment, Danica instructed, "Let her come in."



The maid gave a small nod. "Yes, ma'am."


Moments later, Kaia hurried through the doorway.


Casting a cold glance her way, Danica asked, "Talk.What's wrong with lsaac?"


Still catching her breath, Kaia blurted out, "Mrs.Bennett,Isaac...Isaac and Katelyn..."


She let her words trail off, her expression deliberately troubled.



Danica's hands stilled and she sat upright, her tone sharp. "What about Isaac and Katelyn?"



With fingers twisting together, Kaia pretended to hesitate before saying, "They were... in bed together."


Danica's eyes widened as she shot to her feet. "What did you just say?"


A deep breath steadied her, and then she asked urgently, "Are they at Seraphina Villas now?" 
Kaia bobbed her head again and again. "Yes."



At once, Danica brushed past her and snapped to the maid, "Prepare the car."



Before long, the vehicle stopped at the entrance of Isaac's villa.



Danica all but ran inside. She stormed upstairs to the master bedroom, shoving the door wide open.


Already positioned against the man's chest, Katelyn lifted her head at the sudden noise. Playing the part of a frightened doe, she whispered, "Mrs. Bennett,don't blame Isaac. We lost control of ourselves..."



When Danica switched on the light, a storm of emotions surged through her. "Isaac, you actually-"


She cut herself off mid-sentence, her brow furrowing."Wait. Who is this man?"


With a faint smile,Katelyn retorted, "Don't tell me you can't even recognize lsaac?"


But when her eyes shifted upward, her expression froze in place. The man beside her wasn't Isaac at all.She had been in bed with someone else.



Silent and unreadable, the man lay there as though he had simply completed an assignment. Several seconds passed in eerie quiet before Katelyn suddenly shrieked.



She scrambled back, clutching the sheets around her.



"Mrs. Bennett, I swear it was Isaac!" Katelyn's voice wavered,shrinking lower with every word.



Isaac would never allow another man inside the bedroom he shared with Verena. This had to be orchestrated. The man hadn't uttered a sound the whole time.



The realization struck her, and she cried out, "I understand now! Isaac planned this. He trapped me!"



Danica's expression was impossible to read as she turned her gaze on the stranger. "Tell me, who are you?"


Bearing marks of intimacy across his chest,the man sat up and lowered his head respectfully. "I'm Mr. Isaac Bennett's bodyguard."



With anger rising in her chest, Danica asked sharply,"So this really was Isaac's doing?"



Before the bodyguard could answer, a calm but commanding voice cut in from the doorway. "Yes. I arranged it." Both women snapped their heads toward the source of the voice.



At the sight of Isaac sitting in his wheelchair at the doorway, fully dressed and composed, Katelyn nearly collapsed under the weight of despair. "Why? Why would you treat me this way?"



Danica's reproach followed quickly. "Isaac, do you realize how cruel this is to a woman? How could you put Katelyn through such humiliation?"



His eyes hardened, his voice like ice. "Cruel? You're my mother, yet you judge me without a shred of truth.Did it occur to you that she schemed against me first,and what you're seeing is my answer to her trap?"



Earlier tensions between them only fueled Danica's fury, and she retorted, "Even if that's true, you went too far! How can she show her face again after this?"



Isaac let out a sharp scoff. "If I hadn't fought back,I would have been the one lying in that bed. How do you expect me to face Verena after that?"
###Chapter 169 The Only Person You Can Blame F...
The moment Verena's name was mentioned, fury surged through Danica. "Verena, Verena, Verena-do you think of no one else anymore? You weren't always like this. Where did the steady, rational Isaac I once knew go? She humiliated you overseas with her betrayal, yet even after such disgrace,she's the only one you hold in your thoughts?"



Her words grew louder until they turned into a near shout,her throat strained and her body trembling from the force of her anger.


Isaac's expression remained unreadable, though the chill in his eyes was unmistakable. He responded with biting sarcasm,his words cutting through the air,"You believe insulting my wife will make me abandon her?No,it only fuels my resentment toward you. She is my wife. If my thoughts are not with her, then who else deserves them?"



Stunned into silence, Danica could only fume, her rage momentarily choking her voice.



Meanwhile, Katelyn's face darkened, her jealousy twisting into something venomous. Kaia had already  told her lsaac always defended Verena,but hearing it firsthand was far more unbearable, filling her with hatred she could barely contain.



From the instant Isaac had appeared at the door, his eyes had never once rested on her. To him, she might as well have been invisible.


All her life, Katelyn had been spoiled and adored,every whim catered to by those around her-everyone except Isaac. They grew up together, and from the moment she first saw him, her heart had been lost.She chased him relentlessly through their school years,slipping love letters into his bag, trailing him home,and driving away any girl who dared show interest. For nearly a decade, she believed her persistence was wearing him down, that he would eventually return her feelings. But the day news came that he was married, it felt like the earth itself betrayed her. The man she had fought so hard to possess had become another woman's husband.



A wave of injustice consumed Katelyn. Watching something she longed for defiled by another was unbearable. She rushed back home and even went so far as to undergo surgery to restore her hymen before returning. Though she had embraced the freer lifestyle of her years abroad, for Isaac, she intended to present herself as pure and untouched. Yet the careful scheme she built collapsed under his cunning. 
The romantic evening she pictured with Isaac twisted into a cruel nightmare when he sent another man,a mere bodyguard, to her bed. Nothing could have been more insulting.



What once was admiration curdled into resentment and loathing. She hated Verena, convinced that without her, she would have been the one married into the Bennett family. And she hated Isaac too, for crushing the devotion she had carried for so long.


Whether Isaac ever accepted her no longer mattered.What mattered now was revenge-she would rather destroy their marriage than see them content.If they wished to parade themselves as a loving couple, then she would be the one to make them enemies, trapped in endless bitterness.



Katelyn's grip tightened on the bedsheet until her nails bit into her palm, but the sting was nothing compared to the hatred swelling in her chest.



She rose from the bed, her eyes burning with fury, and blurted out through clenched teeth, "Isaac, now l finally see who you truly are! I'll never forget the humiliation you've put me through tonight!"


Even as her words rang with fury, a small, desperate part of her still longed for him to admit fault, to soften,to comfort her. But Isaac gave her no such thing. His glance was cold,his tone harsher still. "The only person you can blame for this is yourself."
###Chapter 170 Plotting Something Else
Katelyn stood frozen, stunned by lsaac's reply. A heartbeat later, tears broke free as she let out a jagged laugh, her voice trembling. "So this is what l mean to you? A decade of love tossed aside with one heartless line."



His cold dismissal snuffed out the last spark of hope within her. What remained in her eyes was nothing but bitter hatred, glistening beneath her tears.


Before she could collapse into sobs, she spun on her heel and fled the room.



Isaac never so much as spared her a glance.



A heavy stillness settled over the space.



Danica turned her eyes on him. His stare stayed fixed straight ahead, sharp and unwavering,filled with stern determination.



Danica hadn't expected his earlier words to strike her so deeply. From where she stood, it was clear that Katelyn's love for him was real. Her approach might have been excessive at times, but there was no doubting the sincerity behind her devotion. Danica had  assumed that even if Isaac didn't return Katelyn's feelings, he would at least hold a measure of sympathy for her after all those years of commitment.Yet, to her surprise, he remained distant and cold, his response as blunt as ever.



Her emotions tangled into knots. She simmered with anger over his blind loyalty to Verena, yet uncertainty clouded her thoughts about how to navigate the mess with Katelyn.


Letting out a weary sigh, she walked out without another word.



As soon as Danica left the room, Isaac instructed Rhonda to have the master bedroom cleared and every item replaced by the next day.


Rather than stay there, he retreated into the study for the night.



He wanted no reminder of Katelyn left in his space.



Until every trace of her was erased, he refused to step inside that bedroom again.



He powered up the computer and turned to work.



But Bobby's earlier revelation drifted back into his thoughts-Verena had been the first to uncover the conspiracy plotted by Katelyn and Kaia. That memory brought a faint curve to his lips as he sent her a video call request.



In an instant, Verena's poised face appeared on the screen.



His chest tightened as he realized two days had passed since he last saw her.


"Is it all settled?" Verena asked, her smile carrying quiet confidence.



Her question was vague, but lsaac needed no further explanation.


A nod from him followed. "Katelyn even dragged my mother in to watch everything unravel. Both ended up storming out-Katelyn in tears, and my mom right behind her."



A cold laugh escaped Verena. "Let her deal with the consequences. If Katelyn chooses to play dirty,she ought to accept what comes with it."



Even from across the world, the fact that Verena was keeping watch for his sake left Isaac feeling deeply cared for.



His gazelingered on her, full of affection. "You're the reason I saw through their setup, sweetheart. I didn't let them get to me." Hearing such sincere words from him for the first time since his memory loss, Verena's laughter bubbled up,genuine and bright.


She grew serious, her eyes steady on his. "But we can't afford to relax. Katelyn's plans might run deeper than this. Honestly, I doubt a woman with her pride can accept you with your current condition..."


Just then, Verena caught herself, regret flashing across her face. "Sorry. That wasn't fair of me."



Noticing her slight frown, Isaac offered gentle reassurance. "Didn't you promise you'd help me get better? We're partners-there's no reason for you to tiptoe around me."


After all, Verena had already given him a sense of security and courage. If he still retreated into old insecurities, the problem would lie with him, not her.


Verena's happiness was unmistakable when she saw that lsaac wasn't as fragile as before. She added,"Here's how I see it: Katelyn's definitely plotting something else. Back when I was around, she never stopped looking for ways to get you to accept her as your doctor. With me gone, she's got one less obstacle. It's hard to believe she'lI just let this chance slip by. Plus, Danica's opinion of me has soured, so with Katelyn's influence, your mother could easily be roped into something against you." Isaac let out a dry chuckle. "So what's next? Is my mom going to slip me a drug and tie me down sO Katelyn can operate?"



With a knowing smile, Verena simply replied,"Anything's possible."
