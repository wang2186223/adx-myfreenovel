###Chapter 1 Shocking News


By the time March rolled around, Shoildon was buzzing with one jaw-dropping news afteranother.

Word spread first that Isaac Bennett-the eldest son of the city's wealthiest and most influential family-had been in a devastating car crash, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

Another shock followed quickly: the prestigious Bennett family had chosen to bind themselves to the newly risen Willis family/ through marriage.

The biggest stir came from the pairing itself-the groom, none other than the now-disabled Isaac, and the bride, the Willis family's eldest daughter, a young woman raised far from the city's refinement in an isolated rural backwater.

Miles away from the glittering skyline, Verena Willis, the name on everyone's lips, remained in Trisas, the rural place she'd always known.

The chime of an incoming message broke the silence of the modest living room where she sat.

One glance at the screen showed a message from her assistant.

The text read, "Evelyn, I've got a patient with an extremely rare case. They've been waiting for you for six months.When can you come take a look?"

The screen dimmed as Verena pressed the power button, her delicate fingers lingering over the device.In her clear eyes, sorrow flickered.

Around the world, people knew her as Evelyn Rowe-the miracle-working healer-but fame meant nothing when she couldn't save the person she loved most. Her grandmother had slipped away the moment she picked up her scalpel, unable to wait any longer.

From behind her came the muffled edge of her parents' voices, their quarrel leaking through the thin walls of the house. "Alec, the company is drowning in unfinished business, and Kaia's eighteenth birthday party is right around the corner. Tell me, which is more important-a pile of work and a major family celebration, or a dead person? Besides, we need Verena back in the city so she can learn proper manners. If she acts like some country hick girl after joining the Bennett family, it'll be the Willis name everyone laughs at!"
"Stop calling her a country hick girl. She's your daughter!"
"If she weren't my daughter, do you think I'd bother making the trip to fetch her?"
Verena stifled a small laugh as their bickering went on.

The two people arguing in the room were not strangers but her own parents, Alec Willis and Laura Willis.
Once,they had been ordinary employees, clawing their way up inch by inch until success finally came.
Back in those early years of scraping by, they had no time for a child, so her grandmother, Shawna Willis,had taken her in when she was only a month old.
Even with their hectic schedules, her parents had still managed to think of her now and then, sending word or a token of affectionwhen they could.
The change in their priorities began the moment their business took off and they launched their own company. At seven years old, Verena gained a younger sister, Kaia Willis, and from that day forward, her arents' interest in her began to fade. As the Willis fortune grew, they slid seamlessly into the ranks of high ociety.
aura would call from time to time, but her conversations were never about Verena's schooling or health.stead, she would go on about Kaia, the younger sister she called the family's lucky charm, as if Laura's ly mission was to brag about the child who supposedly brought them prosperity.
hor narents came back to Trisas for a visit. sunuori, Laura became pregnant again and gave birth to a son. From that point on, all of their attention went to Kaia and the boy. Money arrived regularly, but they themselves stayed away for fifteen years.
If Shawna hadn't passed away, Verena was certain her parents would have gone on ignoring them entirely.

···

Only after the funeral rites were done did Verena agree to travel to Shoildon with them.
They spoke warmly, as though eager to have her close, but she understood what was really at play. After all,it was easy enough to learn the news in Shoildon with a quick search online.

Laura broke the silence as they neared the Shoildon residence.

"Verena, keep in mind-if anyone asks about your education, you tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine with a master's degree and that you're about to start your internship..."
In her mind, Laura had never pictured Verena as anything more than a small-town clinic doctor.Trisas,after all, was nothing but a secluded mountain town in her eyes.
Since Verena had never attended college-or so she believed-Laura assumed she'd only picked up a few simple skills from the local medics.

The few comments she'd overheard from Shawna about Verena studying medicine had been enough for her o settle on that assumption.
corith's medicine program was ranked first in the country, and Laura had no qualms about using its name prop up her own image. Heaven forbid anyone discover that her eldest daughter's practice was in some ural backwater. That, she thought, would be humiliating.
erena sneered at Laura's vanity, knowing Laura had never cared to truly understand her. In all her life, Laura had never once asked about her education. Once, Verena missed two of the exams due
to illness, resulting in low scores. When Laura later learned her scores were low, she had concluded her daughter was unfit for higher learning.
Even when Shawna tried to tell them the good news of Verena's admission to a top-tier university,both parents brushed it aside, mentioning work matters before abruptly ending the call.
After that, Verena and Shawna stopped trying to share anything meaningful with them.
Verena looked Laura in the eye and said evenly, "I never studied at Acorith College of Medicine."
The bluntness made Laura's lips press together. In her eyes, Verena's refusal to play along wasn't strength -it was stubbornness.
Of course she knew Verena had never been a student there; that was the whole point of telling her to lie.Compared to Kaia, who might not match Verena's beauty but had achievements to show for herself, Verena was nothing but an embarrassment.
Before she could scold her, Alec's pointed cough from the front seat forced her to bite back the words.Letting the matter drop, Laura shifted her focus with a softened tone, the indulgence in it clear.
"Anyway, your sister's used to being spoiled. Try not to provoke her, alright? She gets upset easily and refuses to eat when she's in a mood."
Verena couldn't help finding it all a little ridiculous. Almost eighteen and still carrying herself like a pampered child, Kaia was the very picture of being spoiled.
Their exchange ended as the car rolled to a stop in front of a lavish villa that all but flaunted its wealth.Verena stepped out first, taking in the grand facade.
From the entrance, a girl in a cute T-shirt and short skirt came dashing toward them-Kaia, in all her youthful eagerness.
"Dad, Mom, you're finally back!" Kaia's voice rang out, bright and eager. The brightness dimmed when her gaze landed on Verena. Her eyes lingered, scanning Verena from head to toe.

Clad in aplain cream hoodie and pale yellow pants with clean white sneakers, Verena's look was ordinary at first glance. Yet her delicate features, flawless skin, and calm, distant aura gave her a beauty that couldn't be ignored.Nothing about her spoke of years spent in some remote countryside.

Kaia knew exactly who she was looking at-her full-blood sister-but the two had never shared a home.

Life in Shoildon had made Kaia the untouchable little princess of the Willis family, the jewel in their parents'eyes. This sudden reappearance of an elder sister left her with a subtle, uneasy knot in her chest.

"Oh, Kaia, honestly. How can you come outside wearing so little? Aren't you freezing?"

Laura's eyes went straight to the thin fabric Kaia wore before she quickly slipped off her own coat and draped it over her.

With a giggle, Kaia leaned against her mother. "Ha-ha, Mom, it's really not cold at all."

It was a scene warm enough to melt the chill from the air-but Verena had never been part of such moments.

Laughing together, Kaia and Laura headed inside, leaving Verena standing where she was, as though her arrival had already been forgotten.

As she walked, Kaia's eyes found Verena for a brief moment, casting a lingering, unreadable look over her shoulder.

At the sight of his younger daughter, Alec's expression softened, and he turned to bridge the gap.

"That's your sister, Kaia. She's done very well for herself. Scored high marks on her college entrance exams and already secured her spot at Acorith College of Medicine..."
###Chapter 2 Kaia's Insincerity


Alec paused as something seemed to click in his mind. He remembered a conversation from years ago with his mother, when she casually mentioned that Verena had never taken any college entrance exam.

A long, weary breath escaped him. "You'd be so much better off if you were more like Kaia."

Verena didn't even bother dignifying that with a reply. The comment was absurd enough to amuse her. They could recall every tiny quirk Kaia had, yet when it came to something as important as her education, no one had cared to ask. They simply assumed she fell short in comparison.

···

The Willis family home felt like foreign ground to Verena. It was strange to think this place was meant to be hers, yet she was stepping inside for the very first time.

Laura guided her down the hall toward a bedroom, her voice tinged with concern, and offered a reassuring smile. "If there's anything here that doesn't suit you, just tell me, alright?"

Verena kept her tone even. "Thanks, Mom."

"Sweetheart, you don't have to be so polite. I am your mother."

When Laura lingered in the doorway instead of leaving, Verena asked, "Was there something else?"

Laura and Alec had spent years clawing their way into high society, seizing their break the moment it appeared.Still, they were newcomers, and many in those circles saw them as outsiders. The Bennett family,on the other hand, was adynasty-wealthy,well-connected,and deeply rooted in prestige.

So when the Bennett family suggested a marriage alliance, Laura wasn't about to refuse. She could already picture the benefits, envisioning all the doors it would open.

But Isaac's accident had left him permanently disabled, and Laura couldn't imagine giving her precious younger daughter to him. That was when she decided to bring her eldest home. For a brief moment, staring into Verena's calmn, unflinching gaze, Laura felt the sting of guilt. She hadn't been there to raise her, and there was no real bond between them. The guilt was genuine, but the detachment was stronger.

Even so, she told herself this was an opportunity for Verena. A girl from a small,remote place, who had struggled in school and now worked as a doctor in a quiet town like Trisas, could only benefit from marrying into the Bennett family. Disabled or not, Isaac represented wealth, comfort, and security.

"You need to get some rest for now, Verena. There's someone I want you to meet later tonight, and I'll be the one taking you."

Laura didn't say who, but Verena didn't need to ask. It would be Isaac. She had already read about his accident online. The thought made her want to laugh and shake her head all at once. Expecting anything different from these parents had been foolish. Children who grew up feeling like afterthoughts learned to carry both bitterness and resignation.

"Alright." Verena gave a simple nod, though her agreement had nothing to do with Laura. She had come to Shoildon with only one purpose in mind-Isaac. A quiet thought crossed her mind, wondering what state he might be in now.

Laura's lips curved slightly when she saw no resistance. "Good. Get some rest, then. I'll leave you be."

Just as she was about to head out, she turned to Verena and said, "When you see him tonight, if anyone asks about your schooling, tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine wit a master's degree. Don't worry about them finding out otherwise-I'll take care of it."

Once the door clicked shut, Verena stretched out on the bed. Raising her right hand, she noticed the faint tremor in her fingers.

Six days had passed since she failed to save Shawna on the operating table. The scalpel had slipped, and her right hand hadn't stopped shaking since. For a surgeon, such trembling was the surest path to ruin.

Her mind churned with thoughts until sleep crept in, pulling her, into an unsettling dream.

In another room, Kaia lounged across the sofa, her phone lighting up with group chat messages. Everyone wanted to know-was her sister beautiful? The question soured Kaia's mood. Calling Verena pretty felt like an understatement. Even in simple clothes,she had the kind of beauty that caught and held the eye. Her complexion was smooth, unblemished, almost too refined for someone who had spent years in a remote backwater. Next to her, Kaia felt like the girl-next-door-sweet and harmless, but lacking genuine allure.

The questions kept coming, so Kaia finally typed back. "She's alright, not ugly."

She knew the answer was a blatant lie, yet the words had slipped out on instinct.

By now, everyone in Shoildon had heard whispers about the upcoming marriage between the Bennett family and the Willis family.

The city's wealthy young people were curious about the woman Isaac-once a man of unmatched promise-was set to marry.

Seeing Kaia's lukewarm reply, the group went quiet. Not ugly... It was the kind of phrase that hinted the woman was plain at best. Poor Isaac, they thought.

Among those reading was Bobby Bennett, Isaac's younger brother.

A sharp curse left his lips before he turned toward his mother, Danica Bennett.

"Mom,I get that my brother's legs aren't in the best shape... but does that mean you have to set him up with someone who can't do anything? Kaia says her sister's not exactly attractive."

The comment struck Danica with a dull ache. Like any mother, she wanted her son to have a worthy match.

Still, Isaac's condition went far beyond his injured legs. Certain aspects of his health as a man had been permanently damaged. As the matriarch of the Bennetts, she couldn't let whispers about the family spiral out of control. The safest route was to choose a bride who posed no threat-Verena Willis, the eldest daughter of that family.

"This is my decision, and you have no say in it," she said, masking her emotions with a cool tone.

Bobby's jaw tightened in anger.

Unmoved,Danica turned away and started up the staircase, uninterested in soothing his temper. A message from Laura had just arrived, asking her to set up a meeting between Verena and Isaac that evening.


Stepping into Isaac's dimly lit room, she crossed to the window without pause and yanked open the curtains.



Harsh daylight spilled across the floor,driving away the gloom.

Isaac was stretched out on the bed, his eyes shadowed but unblinking, his face as sharply defined as ever.

Knowing he was awake, Danica spoke plainly. "You'll be meeting a girl tonight. And you will marry her."

"If that's the plan, why waste time with a meeting? Just register the marriage and be done with it," Isaac answered,his voice flat.

A mixture of compassion and unspoken indignation churned in Danica's chest. No one outside the family knew that the accident had taken not just Isaac's health, but also her husband's life. With her son in this state,she dared not announce her husband's death, fearing it would shake the company's stability.

"Don't fight me on this. It's only polite to meet her first."

When she left the room, the shadows seemed to close in around Isaac again. Pain and self-disgust clouded his eyes. In his mind, his father's death was a burden he would always bear.

By the time dusk settled in, Verena was woken by a few knocks on the door before it opened. It was Kaia.

With a tone that wavered between forced cheer and thinly veiled condescension, Kaia said, "Verena, you're about to marry into the Bennett family. Congratulations. They're the top family in Shoildon."

Years of studying abroad had sharpened Verena's instincts, and Kaia's insincerity was as plain as day.

One look was enough to know Kaia disliked her.

In silence, Verena continued folding her quilt, patiently waiting to hear the rest of what Kaia had to say.
###Chapter 3 She's Not Good Enough For You


As Verena stayed silent, Kaia added, "The Bennett family might have a good name, but lsaac is already crippled. People say that when a man's legs are paralyzed, his sexual function is often affected too.l honestly don't want you marrying into that family."

While her words sounded concerned, Kaia's real hope was that Verena wouldn't become part of the Bennett family. Even with Isaac's health problems, he was still someone Kaia had once cared for. And if Verena married him, her life would undoubtedly turn out better than Kaia's.

Verena understood exactly what Kaia was trying to do, so she spoke plainly. "If you don't like me, that's fine.You don't have to pretend you're worried because..."

Verena stopped mid-sentence when she caught the flicker of surprise in Kaia's eyes, and then continued as if it meant nothing, "The feeling's mutual. I don't like you either."

That blunt truth left Kaia momentarily speechless. She hadn't imagined Verena would tear away her false concern so openly.

It was only after Verena had stepped out of the room that Kaia found her voice again. She stamped her foot in anger and snapped, "Who do you think you are? So arrogant! You're nothing but a country bumpkin from a backward place."

Verena had only reached the doorway. Hearing the insult, she turned back, remained just outside, and faced Kaia. "Your parents are from that same backward place. Should I let them know you think everyone from there is a bumpkin?"

The words left Kaia frozen in place. Verena's sharp, unyielding stare made her feel as though every hidden thought had been uncovered.

Her dislike for Verena deepened. This time, though, she didn't argue back and stormed off in a huff.

Kaia had just descended the staircase when Laura appeared before Verena. A shadow darkened Laura's expression.

Verena could guess the reason. Kaia must have run to her, claiming she'd been bullied by her older sister.

"What did you say to Kaia?" Laura asked, her tone sharp and accusing, as though she had already taken Kaia's side. It was clear she hadn't considered there might be another side to the story.

Such blind judgment was something Verena found hard to tolerate.

With a faint, mocking smile, she asked, "And what did she tell you?"

"I'm the one asking you!" Laura retorted.

Her temper spiked at Verena's question in return, certain that growing up in a rural backwater had stripped her eldest daughter of proper manners.

"She called me a country bumpkin, so I reminded her that if that's true, then you and Dad would be bumpkins too, because yo both grew up in the same place."

"Ridiculous! Kaia would never say something so disrespectful." Laura's fury deepened. "It's bad enough you angered your sister, but now you're making up lies? You've got some nerve, Verena."

The whole thing struck Verena as absurd. Laura pressed her for an answer, yet refused to believe her when she gave it. Was Laura only interested in hearing what matched her own opinion?

Verena wasn't the type to back down and had a way of provoking people further. Laura's refusal to believe her made her say, "If you've already decided I'm lying, then so be it. You believe Kaia no matter what. But you won't ever get an apology out of me. If I'm such a problem, I'll just go back to the countryside and let Kaia marry Isaac herself."

She knew exactly what Laura was aiming for and used it to shut her down.

"You!" Laura was genuinely provoked, but she held her temper in check, reminding herself of the real reason she had brought Verena to Shoildon.

She couldn't make sense of how different her daughters had turned out. Kaia was accomplished and sweet-tongued, always winning her over. Verena, in contrast, was unremarkable, stubborn, and dishonest.Years apart had made her feel like a stranger.

"Get your things together. You're coming with me to the meeting. And change your clothes. I'll have one of the servants bring you an outfit."

Verena's decision to come to Shoildon had nothing to do with her unfairly biased parents. The moment she saw the news, she had recognized Isaac.

She didn't care about dressing up to see himn. So when she came downstairs, she wore exactly what she had on before.

Laura, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, looked visibly unhappy. "Why didn't you change?"

"I don't feel like it," Verena said in an unhurried tone.

"You..." Laura could only glare, her patience wearing thin.

It dawned on her that Verena was not as submissive or easy to control as she had assumed.

Still, her priority at the moment was securing the marriage arrangement with Isaac.

"Alright, fine. If you won't change, then let's just go..."



Over in the chat group of the wealthy young people, Bobby kept directing questions at Kaia.

"Kaia, what kind of work does your sister do?"

Even though they shared the same group, Kaia usually had little reason to speak with Bobby.

Her thoughts raced the moment she saw him reach out to her first.

Not wanting Bobby to feel overlooked, she replied quickly, "My mom told me she works as a doctor in a small town."

Bobby's brows drew together slightly. Adoctor? If that was true, then at least she might be able to care for his brother. Thinking along those lines, he grudgingly accepted the idea of Verena being unattractive.Kaia knew her mother had planned to spread the claim that Verena was a master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine.

Kaia had poured years of effort into getting into Acorith College of Medicine and earning people's admiration, so the thought of Verena reaping such recognition without working for it irritated her.

With a hint of mischief in mind, Kaia put on an air of casualness and added, "But she never attended university. She probably just picked up a little from the local doctors."

"What? She never even went to university?" Bobby's surprise was obvious.

The title of "doctor" now felt suspicious to him.

Irritation welled up in Bobby. Isaac had graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in the world.It was bad enough to marry someone plain-looking, but to have her be undereducated as well...

Unable to keep it in any longer, Bobby sent a message to Isaac. "Please, don't marry Verena Willis. She's not good enough for you. Her sister said she never even went to college. Looks aside, she doesn't have much education."

Isaac was seated in a private room at Spice Restaurant, already waiting.

The setting there was elegant and calming.

Neither Isaac nor Danica, however, had the mood to enjoy the view beyond the window.

For Danica, this meeting was purely a business arrangement.

For Isaac, it was nothing more than a reminder of his own shortcomings.

When his phone chimed, Isaac glanced at the message from Bobby. His striking features stayed impassive.

Danica caught sight of Bobby's message as well.

She shut her eyes for a brief moment before saying, "Isaac, please don't resent me. I have no other option."

In her mind, the only way to stop the damaging rumors about him was for him to marry and quietly adopt a child, passing it off as his own.Isaac's lips curved in a faint, bitter smile. Resentment was a luxury he couldn't claim. In his eyes, he was the reason his mother had lost her husband.

Even so, Isaac sent Bobby a reply. "Watch your tone."

Bobby's temper flared when he read it. In a moment like this, Isaac was still telling him to be polite. Did Isaac even understand the real issue?

At that time, Verena and Laura reached Spice Restaurant.

Verena was tall and wearing flat shoes; Laura, teetering in high heels, had to hurry to match her pace.
###Chapter 4 Showing Off Something For Sale


As she walked, Laura whispered to Verena, "No one needs to know you never made it past secondary school.Just tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. That's the story. Got it?"

Verena had no desire to bother her with a reply.

Upon reaching the reserved room, Laura fixed her hair and straightened her clothes while Verena raised her hand and knocked.

The moment Danica heard someone knocking at the door, she knew the eldest daughter of the Willis family had arrived. This was the marriage arrangement she had personally set in motion. Now, as Isaac was about to meet Verena, emotions twisted inside her.

There was a time when Isaac had been her greatest pride. If that accident had never happened, he would be standing next to the most accomplished woman, not someone without much education.

Conflicting thoughts tugged at Danica. She couldn't bear the idea of others looking down on her son,yet she disliked the Willis family for trading their daughter's future for money.
"Come in," Danica instructed, her voice leaving no room for hesitation.

At once, Verena turned the handle and stepped into the room.

The eyes of both Danica and Isaac immediately settled on her.

Verena's outfit was plain-a loose sweatshirt with comfortable pants.Her hair was tied back, though a few strands brushed against her forehead. Minimal makeup left her features untouched, but her beauty was impossible to overlook. Among Shoildon's most polished ladies, she would still draw attention. She carried herself with a calm assurance that made her presence hard to ignore.
For a brief second, Danica just stared, surprise and admiration flashing in her gaze.

Isaac's brow furrowed instead. "So... you're from the Willis family?"

Danica's words came out with a hint of uncertainty, and Laura edged her way inside from behind Verena.Wearing an eager smile, she responded, "Good evening, Danica. That's me. Laura."

Laura guided Verena forward with a bright smile. "This is my daughter, Verena Willis."

Danica's look of surprise was impossible to miss, and Laura felt a wave of satisfaction. Verena carried Alec's features, and that face was something worth showing off. It comforted Laura to know her eldest daughter still had qualities that made her proud.

"Verena, is it?" asked Danica.

She studied the young woman's striking beauty and the confidence she carried. Nothing about her matched Bobby's claim that she was"110t exactly attractive." If this was considered.unattractive, then Shoildon would have no beautiful women left.

A flicker of satisfaction passed through Danica's.eyes. She was relieved to find the woman didn't match Bobby's unflattering description.

She still wanted a daughter-in-law who was easy to control and wouldn't go around exposing Isaac's issues in bed, but she also hoped the girl wouldn't be plain-looking. Appearances mattered, and whoever married into the family had to look the part.

Reading the satisfaction in Danica's expression, Laura felt a quiet surge of pride. Verena was her own flesh and blood, and when it came to looks, se easily outshone Shoildon's most polished ladies.

"Yes. Danica, this is Verena," Laura repeated warmly.

"Please, have a seat..." Danica's voice softened slightly.

While the two mothers traded polite remarks, Verena's attention shifted to Isaac seated across from her.

He wore a simple black shirt and sat in a wheelchair with a light blanket draped over his legs.

Catching her eyes on his legs, Isaac's fingers tightened over his knees, but his expression stayed steady and distant, as if her glance carried no weight.

 When their gazes locked, Verena showed no sign of discomfort. Instead, she gave him a poised smile. Even in a wheelchair, he was exactly as she remembered. He was cool, unyielding, and commanding in presence.

As they looked at each other, Danica motioned for Laura and Verena to take their seats.

Laura praised Verena like she was describing a rare gem, stressing her merits in case Danica harbored any doubts.

Danica felt entirely satisfied with what she saw.

Still, she couldn't help but find something unpleasant about the way Laura kept pushing her daughter forward. It felt less like introducing a future bride and more like showing off something for sale.

The reality was that lsaac's legs were already in a poor condition, and even though the Bennett family remained wealthy and influential, he wasn't the best choice for a husband.

By lowering Verena's position so much, Laura gave the impression she didn't care if her daughter ended up looked down upon or mistreated, as long as the marriage into the Bennett family happened. To Danica, such a mother was hard to respect.

With Verena and Isaac saying barely a word between them, it fell on Danica and Laura to keep the conversation going.

After several minutes of small talk, Danica finally asked Verena, "Miss Willis, your mother told me you hold a master's degree from Acorith College of Medicine. Is that right?"

This detail mattered to Danica. Having a doctor in the family would make caring for lsaac far more manageable.

The moment the question left Danica's lips, Laura grew tense. She feared Verena would stubbornly deny it,so she gave her daughter a discreet nudge under the table.

Laura thought no one would notice, yet both Danica and Isaac caught the movement.

A faint line formed between Danica's brows, while Isaac's cold, impassive gaze remained unchanged.

Verena raised her head, set her utensils down with steady hands, and gently dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering, "No."

Danica's face lost some of its warmth, and Laura's expression shifted sharply.

Inwardly, Laura fumed. Damn it, Verena was still as rigid as ever. Why couldn't she think on her feet? Did she have to embarrass her like this?

Her anger nearly boiled over, but she forced herself to hold it in andprepare a way to salvage the situation.

Before she could speak, Verena added, "I graduated from Pine Hill University."

Laura's eyes widened, and her face went through several changes. Pine Hill University was one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, and the revelation left her momentarily stunned.

Verena, on the other hand, stayed steady, her expression showing no hint of disturbance.

Laura's frustration nearly boiled over. She had always known Verena had grown up in a less refined place,but she hadn't expected her to be so bold in making up stories.

Claiming a degree from Acorith College of Medicine was already stretching the truth, yet now she dared to say she had graduated from Pine Hill University? Did Verena really think the people here would believe such a thing? Her lie had no shred of credibility.

Danica's surprise showed in her eyes. She looked from Verena to Laura's stiff, uneasy face, and in that moment, something clicked. The realization brought a deeper crease to her brow.

Isaac kept his gaze on Verena, and she responded with another gentle smile. It was warm, inviting, and carried the freshness of early spring.

That single smile lightened Isaac's mood in a way he couldn't explain. He quickly turned away, his brows knitting together as a strange wave of self-consciousness washed over him-not because she was outstanding, but because her kindness made him feel small in an ufamiliar way.

"Attending Pine Hill University is certainly impressive. You must be very talented," Danica said, her tone cold and detached.

Graduates from Pine Hill University stood among the most gifted people in the world, and calling them merely talented hardly did them justice.

Laura realized Danica had already caught on to the lie, but she forced herself to press forward. "Ha-ha, yes,it's very impressive. I must have gotten things mixed up... confusing it with the school Kaia will be attending."

The exchange left the dining table steeped in uncomfortable silence.

Without any more hesitation, Danica said, "I'm very pleased with Verena, and I'm sure lsaac is as well.Regarding the marriage agreement..."

"Mom," Isaac chimed in, stopping her before she could finish.

 ###Chapter 5 | Want To Help You


Danica sent Isaac a pointed glance that carried a silent warning.

Isaac paid no attention to her look and said, "I'd like a word alone with Miss Willis."

Since Isaac had spoken, Danica held back any further comment. She already knew his intentions. If only he would simply cooperate. Most likely, he was planning to convince Verena to back out.

With a slow exhale, Danica kept her poise. "It seems Isaac wants to speak privately with Verena and know more about her. Laura, let's step outside for a bit, shall we?"

She understood that Laura was eager for this marriage to happen.

Danica's words served as a subtle nudge to Isaac not to interfere with the agreement.

The response caught Laura off guard. She hadn't expected Danica to be so lenient after Verena's outrageous lie.

Feeling pleased, Laura replied, "Yes, they could use some time alone."

She gave Verena's shoulder a light pat, her voice holding a note of caution. "Verena, remember to take care of Isaac. He's your fiancé now."

Verena lifted her glass for a sip, a faint smile curving her lips. Her dislike for Laura hadn't changed, yet the thought of Isaac being her fiancé brought a quiet thrill to her heart.

When the two women stepped out, Isaac spoke. "My legs are useless now. They'll stay this way for the rest of my life."

His deep, slightly hoarse voice carried the weight of someone who hadn't spoken much in a long time,and his cool, detached tone made it sound almost void of emotion..

Yet Verena understood that his words were a warning, meant to remind her of the kind of man she was about to marry. What else?" she asked, her clear eyes fixed on him like a mirror that reflected everything.

Isaac hesitated. His throat tightened, and a shadow crossed his gaze as he thought of the unspoken truth.Then he forced himself to lay it bare. "I can't function like a normal man anymore. I can't give you happiness or the life of a normal marriage."

Isaac understood that his mother's intentions went beyond silencing gossip; she also hoped to steady the company's position. Even so, neither reason justified binding a woman to him in marriage. Becoming his wife would mean giving up her own happiness and future. In his mind, he was already a ruined man,and there was no need to pull someone else down with him.

At those words, Verena walked around the table until she stood directly in front of him.

From where he sat, Isaac had to lift his gaze to meet the eyes of anyone around him.

Verena lowered herself into a crouch so she was looking up at him instead.

It was the first time since the accident that Isaac wasn't forced to look upward at someone.

"Can I touch your legs?" Verena asked.

There was no hesitation in her tone. Her clear eyes held no judgment or avoidance, as though she were speaking to any other man and not one paralyzed from the waist down. Unlike the rest of his family, she didn't treat his injuries as a forbidden topic.

Since the accident, every relative who looked at him carried pity and regret in their eyes. They didn't speak the words aloud, but their glances said it all. He was crippled, no longer a complete man.

Most people knew that paralysis often meant a loss of sexual function, and he was no exception. Rumors about his body had spread, and the cruel truth was that they matched reality. The wound they left was sharper and more suffocating than any blade to the chest.

Isaac fixed his deep gaze on Verena. "Do you realize what you're saying?"

She nodded, her expression steady. "Yes, I do."

They had been strangers until this moment, yet lsaac felt an odd sense of familiarity when looking at her. He couldn't explain the reason. Driven by instinct, he gave his answer. "Okay."

With his consent given, Verena's eyes curved with a soft, genuine smile.

For a brief moment, Isaac's focus wavered.

When her fingers touched his leg, he could see the movement, yet no sensation reached him.

He followed the sight of her slender fingers as they began at his knee and slowly traveled upward.

To an outsider, the gesture might have looked like she was trying to flirt, but Isaac knew better. He was a man living with paraplegia, completely powerless and without feeling below the waist.

Her hand stopped on his thigh, tapping lightly before she looked up.an you feel that?"

Isaac gave a small shake of his head.

Her touch resumed, inching closer toward the base of his thigh, until Isaac reacted on instinct and caught her hand.

"What are you trying to do?" His voice was edged with warning.

Verena let out a quiet laugh, pulling her hand back without resistance.

"Isaac, I want to help you."

"Help me?" he repeated with a mocking twist to his tone. "Help me with what exactly?"

"I want to help heal your legs."

The statement landed like a sudden crack of thunder in the still air.

It sounded ridiculous, yet something in her unwavering expression sparked an unfamiliar flicker of hope inside him.

When reality set back in, Isaac let out a bitter laugh at himself, Countless experts had studied his condition and found no cure, yet here he was letting the words of a woman he barely knew stir something in him.

"Do you realize how cruel a joke like that is to someone who's disabled?" Isaac asked. In his mind, even open contempt would have been kinder than offering a false hope.

Isaac slowly loosened his grip on her hand.

"I'm being serious," Verena said, her gaze locked firmly on his.

Her reason for coming to Shoildon was solely because of Isaac, and she had no intention of abandoning that purpose halfway.

He regarded her with a chill in his eyes. "Then tell me why you want to help me. And what makes you think you're capable of it?"

Verena faltered for a brief moment. She had already realized that Isaac had no memory of her.

"Do you really not remember what happened in Clokron's Dragon Quarter?"

In Isaac's mind, there was no doubt he had never seen her before. She was a woman of striking beauty-someone whose presence would command attention anywhere. If they had crossed paths, there was no way he could have forgotten her.

He gave a slow shake of his head. "I've been to Dragon Quarter plenty of times, but I've never once seen you there."

A quiet sigh escaped Verena. So that was it. Maybe it had something to do with the recent accident.

She wasn't certain of the specifics of his condition and would need to look into it before deciding anything.

Without the accident, Isaac couldn't have forgotten her. No one forgot the person they once pursued-unless they had lost their memory. And for him, amnesia seemed the most likely explanation.

"Isaac, I don't know the full extent of your condition yet. Once I've reviewed your medical files, I'll give you a clear answer. But... could you at least not shut me out right now?"

Isaac's eyes stayed on her, his silence stretching between them.

Looking into those eyes that seemed to pierce through him, he felt his usual resolve weaken for the first time. After what felt like a long pause, he spoke unexpectedly. "Alright."

A beat later, he added, "If you can heal my legs, I'll give the Willis family everything they're asking for. But my condition makes marriage impossible. A life with me would be a life spent alone."

Verena froze, and then realization struck her. Her eyes flicked almost instinctively toward his crotch. "You..."

The glance made Isaac's face heat with shame. When their eyes met again, the clarity in her gaze made him feel a rare and uncomfortable urge to turn away.


###Chapter 6 Don't Turn Me Away


Isaac's hands tightened around the armrests of his wheelchair, drawing on nearly all his strength before he managed to suppress the wave of self-loathing inside him. When he finally spoke, his voice was steady and cold. "Just as you thought, I have every condition that comes with being a cripple."

The meaning in his words was unmistakable, and Verena grasped it instantly.

When she met his gaze, it felt as though a shadow had settled over his eyes.

An ache spread through her chest without warning. It was hard to believe that the once proud and refined heir of the Bennett family had come to this.

His refusal had nothing to do with rejecting an arranged marriage-it was rooted in a deep and consuming sense of inferiority.

Without thinking, she closed her fingers around his hand. "Isaac, don't turn me away."

Once,those words had belonged to him. Now, she was the one saying them.

The resolve in her gaze was fierce, so fierce it felt like heat on his skin.

Since the day of the accident, he had shut the door on every show of concern, unwilling to endure the pity that always followed.

No one he had pushed away had ever insisted on staying-not even his mother.

Something he couldn't name moved through him, and he found himself saying, "Alright."

Her smile broke across her face in a way that was soft yet luminous. "Then it's settled."

For a moment, he let himself get lost in that smile, and the reason he had requested a private talk with her slipped from his mind entirely.

It struck him then that this woman he barely knew had already managed to pull down the barriers he held against everyone else.

Matters he would stubbornly stand his ground on with anyone else seemed to bend whenever she was involved, and somehow those moments had turned into talks of engagement and marriage. His plan had been to convince her to walk away from the arrangement, yet this was where they had ended up.

...

The conversation between Verena and Isaac about the marriage lasted less than twenty minutes before they reached a decision.

When the meeting concluded, both families went their separate ways.

The moment Laura sat down in the car, the polite smile she had been wearing crumbled.

Thinkingback to Danica's subtle hints during the meeting made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

Her patience finally gave way, and she scolded Verena, "You shameless girl! Did you forget what I told you?I said you should tell people you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine, but you went and said Pine Hill University instead. Do you honestly have no idea how to tell a more convincing lie?"

Verena cut her off mid-sentence. "I told the truth."

Her eyes stayed steady, without the slightest trace of guilt for being called out.

For a split second, Laura almost believed her. But she knew the truth-Verena had never attended college and only held a high school diploma.

Watching her daughter stubbornly stand by her claim only fueled Laura's anger and contempt. To her, it was proof that rural life had left Verena with an unruly and brazen nature.

"Kaia spent three years working hard to get into Acorith College of Medicine. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to enter a top university? Especially one like Pine Hill University." Laura's voice sharpened as she shot Verena a sidelong-glance. "Now look at the mess you've made. You told such a huge lie you can't even maintain it. Didn't you see Danica's reaction when you claimed Pine Hill University? Who would believe something so ridiculous? You've dragged the Willis family's name through the mud with your constant lying!"

Verena felt no surprise at Laura's opinion. To Laura, she would always be nothing more than an uneducated,ill-mannered girl from the remote countryside. A mother who never even tried to understand her child had already failed in that role.

When Laura brought up Kaia as a comparison, Verena could only find it amusing. Kaia had spent three years working hard to get into the college that now wanted to invite Verena as a lecturer. If Laura knew that, her temper would likely explode.

Verena responded sharply, "You think calling myself a Pine Hill University graduate is a lie, but claiming I went to Acorith College of Medicine isn't?"

As she looked at her mother, whatever expectations she had once held for her vanished completely. Her voice turned sharp and cold. "Don't forget, you're the one who taught me how to lie. You're the compulsive liar here,not me."

Laura froze, caught off guard by the bluntness of the retort.

She drew in a breath to scold Verena for her disrespect, but Verena cut her off. "I don't care to hear any more. You wanted a marriage arranged with the Bennett family. Now it's done. You're satisfied, I'm satisfied,and there's nothing else to talk about."

The car pulled up to the Willis Villa just then, and Verena stepped out without giving Laura a chance to reply.She headed straight for the front gates.

Watching her daughter's back disappear, Laura's irritation swelled to its peak. To her, Verena was nothing but an ignorant, uncultured hick with no sense of manners. Such defiance toward her own mother had to have been encouraged by that meddlesome Shawna in the backward place she came from.

If Isaac hadn't been crippled in both legs, and if Laura hadn't wanted to protect Kaia's future happiness,she would never have agreed to bring Verena back from such a dreadful place. In her mind, only the children raised under her own roof counted as real family. The Willis Villa spanned four floors. The first was the living room, the second held the family's bedrooms,the third was used for storage, and the fourth was reserved for guests.

The whole thing bordered on ridiculous. There were only five people in the family, yet Verena's room had been tucked away at the far end of the third floor, right beside the storage closet.

On the second floor, the spare room had been set aside solely as Kaia's study.

If not for the arranged marriage, there likely would have been no intention to bring Verena back at all.

For that reason, Laura's behavor came as no surprise to Verena, though it still left her with a bitterness she couldn't quite name.

As she began making her way upstairs, the sound of footsteps echoed from above.

When she lifted her gaze, a tall young man was descending the staircase. He wore a relaxed hip-hop outfit,and though his face held traces of youth, it was undeniably handsome.

Verena had never seen him before, but the easy manner in his stride and his casual clothing made it obvious. This was her younger brother, Luka Willis.

At the same time Verena spotted him, Luka's eyes also fell on her.

Her hair was tied back in a simple ponytail, and her clothes were plain, yet her beauty was striking.In that instant, Luka knew without doubt she was his eldest sister.

He had once heard through the chatter in the wealthy young people's group chat that Verena was supposedly unattractive, a rumor that had left him feeling embarrassed.

Now, seeing her in person, he could only conclude those claims were pure fantasy.

Her finely shaped features were bare of makeup, yet her face still radiated a quiet elegance, and there was an undeniable cool detachment in her eyes.

That same glint in her gaze mirrored something in his own, leaving Luka certain she was family. He found himself wondering who had started the rumor about Verena being unattractive in the first place. At the start, Luka had no particular feelings toward Verena, but neither did he oppose her. Still, the fact that she had caused trouble for his cherished sister, Kaia, left a mark.

With a sharp little scoff, Luka dismissed the thought. Beauty meant nothing if she had already offended Kaia.

###Chapter 7 What Was She Planning


Luka recalled Kaia's earlier complaints about Verena, and the irritation he felt toward her only deepened.

Kaia had tried to kindly remind Verena to mind her manners in front of others, yet Verena had brushed off her good intentions and even turned on her.

Since childhood, Luka and Kaia had been inseparable, and he had never tolerated anyone treating her poorly.

With that thought, he slid his hands into his pockets and continued to head down the stairs at an unhurried pace.

Verena's eyes rested on Luka for no more than two seconds before she looked away. If Kaia didn't accept her as anything more than an outsider, there was no reason to expect warmth from a brother she had never known.

In her mind, it made no difference how much they disliked her, so long as they kept their distance.Unfortunately,KKaia and Luka seemed to share an unspoken agreement to find ways to provoke her.

When Verena walked past Luka, she noticed his foot suddenly jut out into her path.

A low, amused scoff escaped her. So this was his plan, to make her stumble and perhaps send her tumbling down the stairs.

Before he could succeed, she planted her foot firmly on top of his, stopping him mid-motion. His foot had already been moving forward, and the unexpected weight forced his balance forward. Seizing the moment,Verena gave him a push from behind.

Unprepared,Luka lurched forward and tumbled down the steps, a startled cry tearing from his throat."Ah!"

The sound of his voice rang through the stairwell as he rolled to the bottom.

From the landing above, Verena turned and looked down at him, her expression cold.

Kneeling on the floor, Luka clutched the railing, the sharp sting in his knees leaving him too weak to get up.

Just then, Laura walked in through the door, and the scene that met her eyes stopped her in her tracks.

"Luka!"

She rushed forward in a panic, bending to help Luka to his feet.

Right as Luka opened his mouth to curse, Laura's voice reached him, and he instantly changed to a pitiful tone. "Mom, Verena pushed me down the stairs."

Laura had already been irritated with Verena's behavior earlier in the day, and now, knowing she had shoved Luka only stoked her fury. She had endured Verena's unpleasant attitude for the sake of the marriage alliance, but her son was her world. Anyone who dared hurt him would have to answer to her.

Her eyes flashed as she fixed Verena with a hard glare. "Why did you push your brother?"

Verena took in Luka's fake display of grievance with a faint smirk, thinking how well the two siblings played their parts, even using the same tactics.

Verena answered Laura's question with a shrug. "He made the first move and tried to trip me, so I simply turned it back on him. Figured he should learn what it feels like."

Her tone stayed even, not rushed, as though she was just stating plain fact rather than defending herself.

Luka was only fifteen, and her composure made him uneasy, worried that Laura might actually believe her.

Clutching at Laura's arm, he changed the subject with a voice that wavered as if holding back tears. "Mom,Verena really did push me down the stairs on purpose. I didn't try to trip her. My leg hurts so much...could it be broken?"

Lately, word had spread all over Shoildon that Isaac had lost the use of both legs. Everywhere Laura went,people were shaking their heads and mourning how far the golden boy had fallen.

Because of that, when she heard Luka complain about his leg, her alarm spiked.

She quickly tried tosoothe him. "Don't worry, l'Il get you to the hospital right away." Verena's indifferent expression, however, only made Laura's anger boil over.

Once she had called for an ambulance, Laura turned sharply to Verena.

"So you've barely set foot in this house and you're already flexing like you own the house? If I let this slide,you'll forget who's in charge around here, and that's not happening."

With that, Laura stormed up the stairs, her hand raised high, ready to strike Verena across the face.

Right before the slap connected, Verena caught Laura's wrist, forcing it firmly downward.

Laura's eyes widened in disbelief. "How dare you..."

She started to speak, but Verena's grip tightened, making Laura draw in a sharp breath from the pain.

Locking eyes with her, Verena spoke in a slow, measured tone. "I already told you-he tried to trip me first,so I pushed him down the stairs. Laura Willis, I never expected fairness from you, but don't think you can treat me like prey just because of other people. If you want me to marry Isaac and get everything you're hoping for, then you'd better not push me too far. Otherwise, you can send your precious younger daughter instead."

Once the words were out, Verena let go, and Laura stumbled backward. She almost lost her footing but managed to grab the railing in time.

Without another glance, Verena walked up the stairs.

Laura remained frozen, staring at Verena's cold, unyielding figure, her mind replaying the piercing look in her eyes.

That clear gaze held a fierce determination that made Laura feel as though she was facing a stranger.

Before Kaia's birth, every phone call with Verena had been met with timidity and obedience.

She had always believed her eldest daughter was easy to control. What unsettled her now was not just the defiance-it was the unfamiliarity that came with it.

If Verena's earlier refusal to change clothes or lie as instructed hinted at her unwillingness to be manipulated, her most recent words revealed something deeper. There was cunning and calculation behind them.With only a few sentences, Verena showed she understood Shoildon's social undercurrents and the exact reason she had been brought back from the countryside. For her to know their intentions yet still return,what was she planning?

Laura began to wonder if bringing Verena back from the countryside had been a mistake. What if sending er to marry into the Bennett family ended up destroying the advantages Danica had promised them?

Shame burned in her chest, tangled with frustration. Laura had convinced herself that a girl raised in a ackwater would be too meek to cause trouble, and that she would be too ignorant to understand her chemes. After all, Laura herself had come from that same place, and her early years in the city had been othing but a blur of nerves and uncertainty.

ut Verena saw through everything. The girl's insight left Laura feeling exposed. At the same time, she felt a ense of odd guilt. Verena was still her daughter, and no one knew her prejudices better than she did.

nen another thought struck. Was it not a daughter's responsibility to lighten her mother's burden?arrying into the Bennett family would secure Verena a future wrapped in luxury and influence. Yet, instead showing gratitude, the girl dared to talk back with the kind of defiance shaped by too much time spent ound Shawna.

ka, on the other hand, wasn't trying to untangle any complicated feelings. He just stood there, stunned by rena's tone. To him, it was proof of what Kaia had said all along-that Verena was nothing more than a ty, ill-mannered country girl with no real worth.

###Chapter 8 She Told The Truth


At the Bennett home, the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted through the air as Danica lounged on the sofa,chatting casually with Isaac.

"Verena is pretty," Danica said, pouring the coffee with practiced ease. "Still, growing up without her parents around and never getting a proper education leaves its mark."

Danica had never cared much about a person's bank account, yet schooling was another matter entirely.The Bennett family held one of the highest standings in Shoildon, and while Verena's family history didn't trouble her, the gap in education could invite friction.

She thought back to the dinner at the restaurant, where Verena had claimed she was a Pine Hill University graduate.That memory brought a faint crease to her brow.

"Maybe she dressed up the truth a little," Danica added with a faint shrug. "No matter. Once she's married in, we can smooth things out."

She slid a cup toward Isaac, who accepted it and let it rest on his lap without taking a sip.

"She told the truth," he said, his deep voice breaking the quiet between them.

The coffee pot halted midair before Danica set it down. "What are you talking about? And how are you so sure?"

Isaac didn't bother with an immediate reply. His eyes lingered on a droplet clinging to the rim of his cup,watching it tremble before sliding down.

Memories from earlier flashed in his mind, the way Verena had knelt slightly to meet his gaze, her slim hand resting lightly on his useless legs, her voice steady as she said, "I want to help you."

This was the first time he had ever seen her, a complete stranger until now. Still, there was something quietly steady about her that drew him in and made her seem trustworthy.The honesty in her gaze and the sincerity in the way she carried herself left little room for doubt. When she said she graduated from Pine Hill University, it felt impossible to question her. Lying just didn't seem like something she'd do.

Across from him, Danica noticed his distant expression. It struck her that Verena had spoken to him in private earlier. Maybe something she had told him made him believe her.

Danica wasn't surprised by his sudden silence. Since the accident, Isaac had become the kind of man who measured his words, speaking only when necessary before letting the conversation dissolve into silence.

She tried to speak, but the words slipped away before they could form, leaving her with nothing but a sigh.At this point, whether Verena had told the truth or not no longer seemed to matter. Once the girl became part of the family, she would be shaped into the kind of daughter-in-law they expected.

Skepticism came naturally to Danica when she thought about Verena's claim. The moment she mentioned graduating from Pine Hill University, Laura's startled reaction had been impossiblé to miss.

Given Laura's love of flauntingany scrap of prestige, a daughter with that kind of degree would have been paraded in front of everyone long ago. The idea that she could have allowed such an outstanding daughter to stay in the backward place was laughable.

What puzzled Danica more was how Verena had managed to sway Isaac, a man far too sharp to be easily fooled.


...

Night settled in as Verena lay in bed, her gaze fixed on Isaac's name in her contacts.

Impulse overrode hesitation, and she tapped into the chat, typing out a quick message. "Are you home?"

Isaac read the text, brows drawing together, and then sent back a single word."Yeah."

A small, knowing smile tugged at Verena's lips. There had been a time when he filled their chats with long,eager lines instead of clipped answers.

Her profile photo sat as a blank white square, while his was a stark black. Vith most men, that kind of short reply could pass for arrogance or a sign they wanted the conversation ver.


ut Isaac wasn't most men. This was simply who he was, reserved with anyone who didn't matter to him.

is nature was no mystery to Verena. She had always known him that way.

e asked without hesitation, "Could you send me your medical records?"

le request made Isaac's grip on his phone tighten slightly.

e Bennett family had turned to some of the most respected doctors in the field, yet none had succeeded estoring his ability to walk.

hough his hope had never completely died, the constant string of disappointments had worn him thin.

eyes dropped to the blanket draped over his legs, and a crease formed between his brows. Was it worth ing the heartbreak again?

ore he could decide, the phone buzzed in his hand.

short words lit up the screen. "Trust me."

ething in those words settled into his chest like a quiet ember, giving off a warmth he hadn't felt in a time. Could she really help him stand again?

brushed the edae of the armrest as a thought formed. After so many failed attempts, maybe one The quiet gave Verena space to think. Staring at the ceiling, she let old memories creep in before sending another message. "Do you really not remember me?"

Back then, she had almost been ready to say yes to him, but life had pulled them in different directions.

Isaac paused at the question, and his mind wandered back to their private conversation at Spice Restaurant,when she had also asked if he remembered what happened in Dragon Quarter, Clokron.

The name stirred nothing. His brow knitted as he searched his memory, finding no trace of her.

He replied at last, "Sorry, I don't remember much. Have we met before?"

The moment she read his question, Verena felt a quiet sense of confirmation sette in. It was exactly what she had expected.

The accident had stolen pieces of Isaac's memory, but to him, nothing felt missing. He assumed their paths had crossed before and that she was simply a stranger he hadn't remembered meeting.

To her, it felt as if his memory had selectively erased her alone, leaving a strange gap only they could navigate.

His case was a bit complicated, and the therapy would take time.

"Forget it. We'll talk another time," she responded.

His medical history demanded her attention far more than any question about the past. Whatever was wrong with his legs was the real priority; everything else could wait.

Isaac's eyes lingered on the messages she had sent, his lips pressed into a flat,unreadable line.

···

Later that evening, Kaia swept in from outside.

Two servants trailed behind her, each struggling under stacks of books so tall they nearly blocked their view -every one ofthem written by respected medical authorities from around the globe.

Clutching her thickest and most treasured volume to her chest, Kaia stepped inside with a satisfied gleam in 
her eyes.

The moment Kaia spotted Laura sitting on the sofa, she rushed toward her, eager to spill her excitement.

"Mom, look at this!" Kaia's voice carried a mix of pride and excitement. "I finally got my hands on the latest release by my idol, Evelyn." She flipped it open and tilted it toward Laura. "Their research is brilliant.The way they see the world of medicine is unlike anyone else. Honestly, I think the person might be a true genius."

Her tone shifted into something wistful. "It's just... no one knows who the person really is. Aside from a name, we don't know their nationality, gender, or even what they look like. Meeting them someday would be incredible."

Kaia's academic excellence had been a constant source of pride, never once causing Laura to worry.

Laura reached over and patted herdaughter's head, smiling warmly. "Kaia, you're so hardworking and well-mannered."

The company would one day belong to her son Luka, so Laura had no plans to involve Kaia in its operations.All she wanted was for her daughter to make a name for herself in a field of her choice and bring prestige to the family.

Her smile faded as another thought intruded. "Not like Verena, who seems to live for provoking me."

If Luka's injuries had been more serious, Laura would have made sure Verena paid the price.

Kaia listened in silence, a faint satisfaction settling over her as her mother spoke.
###Chapter 9 We Should Work Together To Stop It


Kaia liked Isaac, yet her feelings never clouded her judgment enough to consider marrying a man with a disability. She would never agree to be his wife, and she wouldn't stand by if anyone else tried to marry him either. That was the root of her resentment toward Verena.

With a quiet sense of satisfaction buried deep inside, Kaia put on an act of worry and asked, "Mom, what did Verena do to make you so upset?"

Laura, more than ready to let out her anger, began telling Kaia about the falsehoods Verena had told in front of the Bennett family.

"That's Pine Hill University we're talking about! Did she think it was some random, insignificant school?Claiming she was enrolled there only makes it look like we're lying. She ruined my reputation today, and the more I think about it, the more it infuriates me. And if that wasn't enough, she even pushed Luka down the stairs. If Luka hadn't come out of it unhurt, I would have really let her have it."

Kaia could hardly believe what she was hearing. Verena truly was living in a fantasy. She was just a girl from a backwater place, with nograsp of reality and no ability to tell a convincing lie.

Pine Hill University? Did she honestly think everyone else was that gullible?

Biting back her laughter, Kaia offered Laura a few words of comfort before heading back to her room.She opened the group chat for the young people from the elite families, a habit she had before ending the night.

The moment she clicked in, she noticed that Bobby had tagged her name directly.

That small action made her feel as if she had gained the Bennett family's special attention.

Scrolling upward, she saw that someone in the chat had brought up Bobby first, asking him about Isaac and Verena's first meeting.

Bobby's answer was vague, but it was obvious he did not approve of the idea of Verena becoming his sister-in-law.t after that, Bobby tagged Kaia and asked, "Do you know what's going on with your sister? What's she


I's hopes for Verena to end up with Isaac were no secret to Kaia, yet the thought of it happening was thing she would never accept.

she passed along what Laura had told her earlier, she left out the part about pretending to be from h College of Medicine. Instead, she told the group that Verena had gone so far as to ĉlaim she was a ate of Pine Hill University.

st to make fun of it was Slater Lyons, Bobby's closest friend. "Pine Hill University? Did I really just at? That's one bold lie."

g that message, Bobby's patience thinned at once. He questioned what kind of woman his mother sen for his brother. In his mind, lacking looks was forgivable, but being poorly educated and lying as e nothing was far worse.

take long for the group chat to erupt with ridicule.

t of embarrassment touched Kaia as the insults piled up. Instead, she let a small, pleased smile her face.


kept up her carefully built image of a gentle and kind young woman.

a message in Verena's defense. "She only said that because she didn't want people to look down he's actually a good person with no bad intentions. The city's new to her, and it's not easy to ase, don't speak a step in to shut down the idea of the marriage between their families.

And she was right. Bobby grew angrier with each comment he read. If Verena were allowed to marry Isaac,it would spell disaster for his future.

At one point, Bobby had thought that if she stayed in line, he could learn to put up with her. But after realizing she was a skillful liar, he became sure she would only cause trouble. Isaac, who rarely cared about anything and lacked her slyness, could be taken advantage of easily. Bobby would not let that happen.

Bobby didn't hesitate before pulling up Kaia's profile in the group chat and sending her a friend request.

When the notification appeared on her phone, Kaia almost doubted her own eyes. Could it really be that Bobby from the Bennett family had taken the first step to contact her?

Rather than fading quickly, her shock mingled with a sense of excitement.

In Shoildon's social circles, her family might be considered among the wealthy, but they were barely on the bottom rung, while the Bennetts sat securely at the top. Bobby's presence in the group was purely due to his friendship with Slater, and he had never bothered to interact with the rest of them.

Fighting to keep her composure, Kaia tapped "accept" without delay, and then typed a polite question as if the request meant little to her. "Mr. Bennett, was there something you wanted to discuss?"

Without missing a beat, Bobby responded, "Why don't we meet in person?"

The simple message sent a rush of thrill through her. Though she had once been drawn to Isaac, Bobby was just as much a catch. Now that Isaac's disability had changed everything, the idea of Bobby showing interest in her was something most women she knew would envy.

Playing at hesitation, Kaia chewed lightly on her lip before replying, "Mr. Bennett, are you sure this is a good idea? It feels rather sudden."

Bobby nearly scoffed at the screen, already guessing what she must be imagining.

With one hand, he typed out his real reason for reaching out. "You don't want Verena marrying Isaac, right?Then we should work together to stop it." From the way Bobby had reached out, Kaia had first assumed he might have taken a personal interest in her.

It caught her off guard to realize he disliked Verena enough to want to join forces in stopping her marriage to Isaac. What she hadn't anticipated was Bobby's willingness to work with her, and that discovery brought a spark of satisfaction. The chance to block Verena from marrying Isaac while drawing closer to Bobby felt like a perfect victory on both fronts.

Kaia wanted nothing more than to agree to Bobby's proposal. Still, she knew she had to keep up the illusion of being a caring sister to Verena. If she let her open dislike show, that would shatter the gentle,innocent image she had worked so hard to craft. Men tended to admire women who seemed sweet, soft-spoken, and kind.

"This marriage was arranged by our parents. We can't just undo it. Besides, marrying your brother is the best thing that could happen to Verena. As her sister, I should be glad for her, not stand in her way."

Bobby had never spoken with Kaia one-on-one before, but whatever goodwill he might have had toward her evaporated after only a few minutes. He'd seen enough manipulation in his life to recognize when someone was pretending.

Each word of her message was laced with insincerity and hypocrisy. If she truly cared about Verena's happiness, she wouldn't have paraded Verena's humiliations in the group chat for everyone to see. Verena had her flaws, but Kaia was just as bad,maybe even worse.

###Chapter 10 You Really Are Kind-Hearted


Bobby had no patience for people who hid behind self-righteousness to mask their manipulation. If Isaac's future happiness hadn't been on the line, he wouldn't have wasted a breath on someone as foolish as Kaia.

For the sake of his goal, he swallowed his distaste and didn't call her out. Instead, he played along and tried to convince her.

He typed out a long message. "Do you really think marrying lsaac is the best thing that could happen to your sister? She grew up far from the city's pace, never went to college, never stepped into elite circles. In a family like mine, she'd be out of her depth before the first dinner party. When the conversation turns to business or high society, she'll have nothing to say. And don't forget-Isaac may be in a wheelchair,but his mind is as sharp as ever. He's still the same strategist who dominated the business world. They're not equals, and being with him won't give Verena a shred of happiness."

Kaia didn't give a thought to Verena's well-being. Her only objective was to break the engagement.

She wished she could meet Bobby now and discuss the plans to stop this marriage. Still, she knew she had to mask her eagerness, play the part of the reluctant participant.

When his message went unanswered, Bobby recognized the ploy instantly. Kaia was dangling hesitation to draw him in. He pressed anyway, guiding her toward joining forces. "She claims a degree from a prestigious university, but it's a lie. People will talk. And if word gets around that the Willis family stooped to disgraceful tricks just to push her into the Bennett family, you won't just damage her reputation-you'll drag your whole family's name through the mud in Shoildon."

The barb landed exactly where Bobby intended. He'd offered Kaia a neat escape from her fake benevolence, and, just as he expected, her reply came back almost instantly.

"That's true. Verena's far too timid-marrying into the Bennett family would only see her pushed around.And because of her bold lies, the Willis name would be tied to rumors of using shady tactics. Worse still,your Bennett family would end up being the laughingstock." Bobby scanned her message, his lips curling in silent disdain. Fool. Who in their right mind would dare mock the Bennett family? Only moments ago she'd been insisting Verena would be lucky to marry into their ranks,and now she was parroting his words without hesitation. Her sudden agreement told him everything-Kaia was willing to join forces with him.

Another message came through before he could finish the thought. "Although I know this isn't right,for Verena's sake and for the Willis family's dignity, I'll work with you."

A humorless chuckle escaped Bobby. Kaia had a knack for wrapping her schemes in silk, making herself look noble while pretending her hands were clean.

If it weren't for his determination to keep Verena away from Isaac, he wouldn't waste a single word on her.

"You really are kind-hearted to a fault," Bobby replied, the sarcasm tucked neatly behind a smooth tone.

Kaia's cheeks warmed when she read it. Was that a compliment? Many had praised her before, but never someone of Bobby's rank. She'd heard he was proud, even dismissive, and rarely spoke well of anyone.Could he actually be interested in her?

Kaia lingered over the message, her thoughts tumbling ahead of her.

With Isaac confined to a wheelchair, Bobby stood as the Bennett family's brightest heir. His tone almost hinted at interest-didn't it? If Isaac couldn't be won, then Bobby would make an excellent prize instead.

Feeling a rush of satisfaction, she responded wit a feigned modesty, "I'm honored you'd say that. My concern is only for Verena-it's not about being kind. She's my sister, after all. If I won't think for her, who will?"

Bobby didn't even bother responding. What a ridiculous woman.

Switching back to business, Kaia asked, "So, where and when should we meet?"

Still undecided, Bobby sent a short reply, saying, "I'll let you know."

"Alright," Kaia answered, punctuating it with a cutesy emoji.

Without a glance at it, Bobby tossed the phone onto the table and headed straight for lsaac's study. A firm rap of his knuckles sounded against the heavy door.

Isaac sat behind his desk, eyes scanning a stack of documents. At the knock, he didn't even glance up."Come in," he said, his tone flat and detached.

The latch clicked, and the door swung open almost immediately.

Bobby strode in without hesitation, his voice brimming with urgency. "Isaac, did Verena tell you she graduated from Pine Hill University? Don't buy it-she's justa-"

"Get out," Isaac interjected, his voice like ice.

He knew exactly where Bobby was going with this and had no interest in hearing the rest.

The sharp dismissal threw Bobby off balance, but he tried to push through. "Isaac-"

One glance from Isaac stopped him cold.

The slight furrow of Isaac's brows and the glint in his eyes carried a silent, unmistakable warning.

Bobby had feared that look since they were kids. When Isaac got serious, backing down wasn't just smart-it was instinct.

Bobby swallowed his frustration and walked out without another word.

Isaac's gaze lingered on the door long after it shut, his expression unreadable.

Out in the hallway, Bobby replayed the exchange in his mind-lsaac's cold indifference, Kaia's manipulations. If Kaia could be that rotten and she was Verena's sister, then Verena couldn't be much better.

A low, derisive laugh slipped from Bobby's lips. The Willis sisters-one a hypocrite, the other a fraud.Disabled or not, Isaac deserved better than either of them.

Bobby was determined to stop this marriage from happening. Resolved, he chose a meeting spot, set the time, and sent Kaia a short message telling her to meet him tomorrow.

Morning came, and a gleaming red sports car rolled smoothly along the main road, its driver locked on the traffic ahead.

Halfway through a turn, a muffled ringtone buzzed from the inside pocket of his jacket.

Bobby took out his phone, checked the screen, and pressed it to his ear. "Mom, what's going on?"

"Don't 'what's going on' me," Danica retorted immediately. "Why aren't you at the office?"

There was no way Bobby was going to explain where he was really headed, so he kept his tone light."Taking a day off.Got something important to handle."

"Important?" she scoffed. "The only 'important' things you do are eat, drink, and waste time. Get yourself back to work."

Bobby's lips twisted in a dry smile. Same old script. In her eyes, he'd never been anything more than an idle boy who knew nothing but how to enjoy himself.

Telling Danica he was out digging for ways to sabotage the marriage alliance wasn't part of Bobby's plan,but the constant nagging scraped against his nerves.

His patience snapped. "I'm doing this for lsaac's future, whether you see it or not. Maybe you don't care,but I do. Verena isn't beautiful, she isn't properly educated, and she's completely unfit to be by his side.I don't know what scheme you've got in motion, but disabled or not, Isaac is still the Bennett family's eldest son. He deserves a wife who matches him in every way, not someone far beneath him. How can you ignore what he wants-or what's best for his life?"

The heat in Bobby's words was met with nothing but silence on the other end.
###Chapter 11 Only Such A Woman Was Worthy Of Isaac


A faint, bitter smile tugged at Danica's lips. Isaac was her son, and pretending she didn't care was impossible. But what good was caring when she understood, better than anyone, that the car accident had cost him more than just the use of his legs?

She closed her eyes, the doctor's words still echoing clearly in her mind-the day she found out the crash had also left Isaac with sexual dysfunction. The mix of helplessness and heartbreak had left her feeling empty inside.

News of Isaac's leg injury alone had already sent the media into a frenzy. If news of his sexual dysfunction ever spread, there was no predicting how cruel the rumors would get, or how fast public opinion could turn against their family.

Yes, she had two sons, but their strengths were painfully mismatched. Isaac had the talent to lead but couldn't produce an heir, stripping him of the right to inherit the company. Bobby had the ability to continue the bloodline but lacked the strategic mind for leadership.

That day, Danica vowed to herself that no one would ever learn about Isaac's condition. Determined to secure Isaac's future and keep the company stabe, she acted fast, arranging a marriage planned down to the finest detail. The Willis family was the match she chose.

If she followed Bobby's advice and sought a match with a lady from a powerful, equal-status family, she couldn't be certain they wouldn't one day use Isaac's secret against them. Women from those circles often came with sharp minds, deep schemes, and dangerous family backing. The Willis family, on the other hand,was easy to handle in both power and intellect.

And Verena, raised in a backward region, was either blissfully unaware of the manipulations of city life or too inexperienced to take part in them. A bride like that would be the easiest to control. Even if Verena eventually learned about Isãac's condition, Danica was confident she could ensure the girl stayed silent.

This was something Danica had no intention of letting Bobby find out. Letting out a slow sigh, she said, "You're still too young. Even if I explained, you wouldn't grasp the whole picture. Just concentrate on preparing yourself for the company. Isaac's issues are between him and me.Don't get yourself involved. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting to attend to."

Before Bobby could get a word in, she ended the call.

Glaring at the ended call, Bobby felt irritation churn inside him. Every conversation played out the same.She talked to him as if he were a child, leaving him feeling small and dismissed.

Frustration burned in Bobby's chest, and he spat out a curse before tossing his phone aside.

Unexpectedly, the phone struck the steering wheel, jolting it just enough to send the car swerving off course.

Suddenly, his heart jumped as he spotted a pedestrian right in his path. Bobby then jerked the wheel at the last second, barely avoiding them.

Right as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the car smashed into the roadside barrier.

The airbag burst open, but the sudden swerve sent his head hitting the window.

Bobby felt a warm trickle slide down his temple, and within moments, his vision blurred and faded to nothingness.

Shouts erupted as nearby pedestrians rushed toward the wreck. Someone was already dialing for an ambulance.

Verena, bored and out for a drive, slowed when she spotted several cars stopped ahead. She rolled her window down, curious about the commotion.

Suddenly, a voice rang out over the noise of traffic. "Is there a doctor here? Please! Someone's been in an accident!"

An accident? Verena's brow furrowed.

She unclipped her seatbelt in one swift motion and pushed through the gathering crowd. The wrecked vehicle was a red Ferrari. Through the cracked glass, Verena spotted the driver slumped unconscious behind the wheel.

Turning to the bystanders, she said firmly, "The front's taken a bad hit. There's a chance the fuel line's damaged, and it might catch fire. We have to get him out right now."

At her words, a few sturdy men immediately moved forward to assist.

"Lay him flat," Verena instructed. "And avoid putting pressure on his chest."

Once the man was clear of the car, she dropped to her knees beside him, unbuttoning his clothes layer by layer until she reached his undershirt.

She quickly lifted his eyelids, checked his breathing, and immediately started CPR.

When two complete cycles failed to get a response from the injured man, she continued without pause.

Her composure and precision mirrored the calm efficiency of a trained emergency responder, easing the fear of those watching.

Finally,faint movement flickered in Bobby's eyes.

Verena noticed it instantly, exhaling a quiet breath of relief. He was coming back.

In his haze, Bobby felt like he was stuck in a nightmare. Every heartbeat sent a fresh wave of pain through his skull. A calm, steady voice urged him toward awareness, cool in tone but strangely captivating. Curiosity pulled at him, and with effort, he pried his eyes open.

When Bobby's eyes finally opened, Verena gave him a warm smile. "Good, you're awake. How are you feeling? Any pain or discomfort?"

Her voice was calm and held a soft concern.

Bobby simply looked at her, blinking like he'd momentarily forgotten how to speak.

Thinking he was still groggy from regaining consciousness, Verena asked again,"Other than your head,do you feel pain anywhere else?" Her voice filled Bobby's ears, soft and reassuring, while his gaze stayed fixed on her.

One clear thought settled firmly in his mind-this was exactly what he imagined a perfect sister-in-law should be! Beautiful, elegant, kind, and offering just the right touch of care. Only such a woman was worthy of Isaac.

Verena noticed his unwavering gaze and assumed the accident had left him dazed.

The wail of an approaching siren broke the moment, and the ambulance pulled in beside them. Without drawing attention to herself, she eased back into the crowd.

Bobby wanted to call out, to ask her name, but the paramedics quickly lifted him onto a stretcher and into the ambulance.

From the sidewalk, Verena watched the vehicle speed away. A faint crease appeared between her brows.Was it just her imagination, or had that young man's face looked strangely familiar, like someone she'd seen before?


···

The moment the hospital called, Isaac ordered a driver to take him there without delay.

When he reached the ward, he found Bobby lounging on the bed, casually munching on a banana.

As soon as he spotted Isaac, Bobby hurriedly tossed the fruit aside. "Isaac, you're here."

Isaac didn't answer right away. Instead, he turned to his assistant. "Step outside for now. I'll call if I need you."

With a respectful nod, the assistant slipped out, closing the door behind him.

Rolling his wheelchair forward, Isaac stopped directly in front of Bobby. His eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the bandage wrapped around Bobby's head. "What happened?"

A pang of guilt flickered through Bobby. Ever since the accident that had taken their father's life and left Isaac in a wheelchair, the family had been overly cautious about driving. If Isaac knew he'd been in another accident,he'd worry for sure.Forcing a grin, Bobby waved it off. "It's nothing,just a scratch."

Isaac stayed quiet, his gaze locked on Bobby, unblinking.

Bobby could feel the truth clawing at his throat, and lying to Isaac was impossible.

Looking away, his eyes shifted uneasily. "I just accidentally crashed into the roadside barrier and ended up with a mnild concussion. Nothing serious, just a minor accident."
###Chapter 12 Show Her Respect


Isaac's voice rumbled low, carrying more frustration than he intended. "How many times do you plan on gambling with your life?"

Understanding the concern beneath the reprimand, Bobby dropped his gaze. "I'm sorry for making you worry. Mom's already had enough to bear... We shouldn't give her more to lose sleep over."

Earlier, during the ride to the hospital, Isaac had already pressed for details and confirmed Bobby's injuries weren't serious.

Since that severe car crash, Danica hadn't slept soundly once. He refused to pile more strain onto her.

"Get some rest. I'll arrange for someone to bring you home later," Isaac said evenly. "Leave Mom to me.I have work to deaI with at the company, so I'll head out now."

As Isaac maneuvered his wheelchair toward the door, Bobby's mind flashed back to the aftermath of the accident. His hand shot out, gripping Isaac's arm. "You absolutely can't marry Verena!"

Isaac's jaw tightened. He didn't want to hear it. Given Bobby's condition, he kept his irritation in check. "Let go," he instructed flatly.

The lack of reaction made Bobby's pulse jump. "I'm telling you the truth-Verena's no good. The Willis sisters are both trouble. One family doesn't raise two entirely different kinds of people. The ones who lie easily are the ones with the deepest schemes."

Recalling the elegant stranger he'd seen that day, Bobby leaned forward urgently. "Don't marry her.I already found the perfect woman for you! She's beautiful, kind... she saved me during the crash. Looked about your age too. From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one who could match you. Too bad I didn't get her contact before the medics hauled me off."

With unshakable certainty, Bobby finished his pitch. "Isaac, just go to the Willis family and call off the arrangement. You should marry that incredible woman instead. I'll track her down for you, no matter what. So,what do you say?"

To Isaac, the suggestion sounded nothing short of reckless-naive, even childish.

A faint chill settled in his eyes as he fixed Bobby with a steady stare. "Who taught you to speak about a woman like this behind her back?"

The weight of Isaac's glare robbed Bobby of his next words.

"The arrangement with the Willis family stands," Isaac said, voice cool and resolute. "And I don't want to hear another word of this nonsense."

Turning his wheelchair toward the door, he paused as though remembering something. Without fully facing Bobby, he added, "And for the record, Verena isn't the liar you make her out to be. She will be your sister-in-law, so you'll show her respect. In this family, we don't slander people in their absence."

Isaac's tone carried enough authority to leave Bobby momentarily frozen. Only when the door clicked shut did he release the breath he'd been holding.

Well, this was rich. What kind of game had Verena played to get lsaac on her side after meeting him only once?

The thought only fueled Bobby's resolve. No matter what it took, he would not allow Verena to marry Isaac.Now that he'd found someone who truly matched his brother, there was no way he'd back down.

···

Autumn's breath swept through the streets, scattering golden leaves until they lay thick over the pavement like a gilded carpet.

Muted colors dulled the scenery, giving the city a quiet, almost somber air.

Inside a warmly lit private dining room, two figures sat facing each other-a man and a woman separated by decades in age.

The man, nearing sixty, wore his years in the silver streaks along his temples and the faint creases at the corners of his eyes. Across from him sat Verena, poised and elegant, her hair flowing in a silky cascade down her back, her frame slender and composed.

A genial smile tugged at the man's lips. "Evelyn, ever since we said goodbyes to each other in Clokron, I've been trying to arrange another meeting. It seems this busy bee finally decided to grace me with her presence."

This was Wendell Branson, a distinguished professor at Acorith College of Medicine.

Their acquaintance began in Clokron, where they had collaborated on medical work.

Recognizing the teasing note in his voice, Verena lifted her cup, her expression warm."It's true-personal matters have kept me away. I owe you an apology, Professor Branson."

In those early Clokron days, Wendell's opinion of her had been far from favorable. Her aloof manner and quiet reserve had struck him as a sign of inexperience. But after the ordeal in Dragon Quarter, his view shifted completely. He no longer merely respected her-he admired her. Talented physicians of her age were exceedingly rare, and she was one of the few who stood out beyond doubt.

With a satisfied glint in his eyes, Wendell lifted his cup, letting it gently meet Verena's in a soft chime.

"Evelyn, we've known each other long enough for me to skip the pleasantries," Wendell said warmly."I'd like to extend an official invitation for you to deliver a lecture at our college."

The offer made Verena pause, her thoughts drifting for a moment. Shawna's death on her operating table still lingered like a shadow in her mind, and the occasional tremor in her hand reminded her it hadn't fully passed. Added to that, she'd been pouring her energy into analyzing Isaac's condition, leaving little room for anything else.

Verena's voice held a trace of regret as she responded, "Professor Branson, I truly appreciate the honor.But right now, I have a critical patient who needs my full attention. You understand that preparing for a lecture demands complete focus and precision. At present, I'm overwhelmed. Once this treatment is complete,if your invitation still stands, I'll gladly accept and give it my all.".

Wendell's smile deepened, his tone laced with good humor."Very well, I'll hold you to that. And if you dare refuse me then, I'll tell the whole world that the celebrated young doctor is making a fool of an old man." Verena gave a small nod, her voice steady. "You have my promise."

That answer seemed to genuinely please Wendell. "Alright then. Enjoy your meal. I'll step out for a moment."

Leaving the private room, Wendell made his way toward the restroom.

On the return walk, a voice rang out behind him.

He turned to see a young woman in a blue dress hurrying toward him, her face lighting up.

"Professor Branson, it really is you!" Kaia exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.

Wendell recognized her immediately as one of his most engaged students from Acorith College of Medicine.
"Kaia. I didn't expect to see you here. Are you having a meal here?"

Thinking of Bobby, she nodded with a shy smile. "Yes, I'm here with a friend."

She then asked, "And you, Professor? Are you dining alone?"

"I'm with..." Wendell hesitated for a couple of seconds, remembering Evelyn's preference for privacy.Guessing she wouldn't want to be mentioned, he said, "...someone I look up to."

Kaia's eyes widened. "Someone you look up to? That must be someone truly remarkable!"

Wendell smiled faintly. "Extremely. In fact, one of the most talented young professionas I've ever known."

Eager to continue the conversation and leave a good impression, Kaia quickly said, "That reminds me.I recently bought several medical books, and one of them was by my idol, Evelyn Rowe. Some of the terms and advanced theories are a bit beyond me. Would it be alright if I messaged you later for guidance?"
###Chapter 13 Young Role Model


When Kaia revealed that her idol was Evelyn-the same woman he was dining with-Wendell let out a warm laugh.

Kaia was always active in class. Her genuine love for medicine was impossible to miss, and that spark amused Wendell.

"You're welcome to ask me anything that confuses you,"said Wendell, leaning forward slightly. "Medicine isn't for the faint of heart, but your energy tells me you can handle the challenge. In fact, I've got something you'll want to hear."

Her eyes lit up instantly. "What's that?"

"Evelyn will be giving a lecture at our university this year. Only two hundred seats are available, but I can make sure one of them has your name on it."

The news hit her like a rush of adrenaline. "Are you serious? Evelyn's really coming here to speak?"

"Completely serious," Wendell replied with a certain smile.

Kaia couldn't hold back the excitement that burst out of her before she had the chance to stop it. "Professor Branson, this is incredible! Thank you, thank you so much! Meeting Evelyn has been my dream for as long as I can remember. She's the greatest physician alive in my book."

Wendell brushed her gratitude aside with a light wave. "Save your thanks. I can't keep my role model waiting.Goodbye."

Kaia gave a quick nod, though her curiosity flared. Who could possibly inspire a man like Wendell?

The question tugged at her until she found herself trailing after him at a careful distance.

She watched him disappear into a private dining room, and her gaze stretched toward the doorway.The figure inside was undeniably a woman, and shockingly young. Could someone like that truly be Wendell's 
role model?

Drawn by intrigue, Kaia edged closer to the door. The woman sat turned slightly away, long hair cascading down like a curtain that hid her face completely. No matter how she craned her neck, Kaia couldn't get a proper look.

"The food's gone," said Wendell from inside, his tone light with amusement.

Kaia had just started to lean in for a clearer look when the door shut in front of her. Curiosity lingered, and she still hoped to catch a glimpse of the woman Wendell looked up to. Even so, the thought didn't trouble her for long. What truly mattered now was that she was finally about to meet the person she had admired for years.

Despite the feminine ring of the name Evelyn, Kaia had always pictured the famed medical author as a man -tall, refined, and striking, with the kind of presence that turned heads.

Her mind still busy painting that picture, she pulled out her phone on the way to the restroom and began typing with excitement. "Two incredible reasons to celebrate! Just found out that my lifelong idol, Evelyn Rowe, will be giving a lecture at our school, and Professor Branson has reserved me a spot."

The post took off in seconds, her notifications filling with reactions.

"No way! Are you talking about the legendary surgical genius Evelyn Rowe?"

"Isn't the mysterious doctor supposed to be impossible to track down? Kaia, you're unbelievable! How did you find this out?"

"Evelyn's my inspiration too! I wish I'd gotten into Acorith College of Medicine. Please stream it for us!"

Kaia's chest swelled with pride as the comments poured in. Evelyn's name carried weight, and knowing she was part of that moment made her glow.

Elsewhere in the restaurant, Wendell leaned toward Verena with a grin. "You'll never guess who I bumped into outside-a female student who practically thinks you hung the moon."

"Is that so? Why didn't you bring her over to get my autograph?" Verena teased, one brow raised. Wendell let out a laugh as he gestured toward her. "You're so good at disappearing, I wouldn't even know where to find you if I brought someone by."

Verena took a slow sip of water, entirely unbothered.

After leaving the restroom, Kaia stepped into a different private room.

Smoothing her hair back, she offered a polite smile. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting,Mr.Bennett."

Across the table, Bobby sipped lazily through a straw, not even acknowledging her apology.

Unfazed, Kaia leaned forward slightly. "Speaking of waiting, what happened last time you invited me out?1was there for quite a while."

"Something came up," he said flatly, brushing it aside. "Let's just talk business."

Her brows knitted for a brief moment at his tone, but she quickly smoothed her expression. A man of his standing was bound to carry a certain detachment, she reasoned.

Forcing a pleasant nod, Kaia asked, "All right. What's your plan?"

Bobby said indifferently, "If I had one, we wouldn't be meeting here at all."

When it came to rival companies, Bobby could dream up strategies in his sleep. But taking down a woman who had no real defenses? That wasn't something he had an easy answer for.

Kaia's teeth caught her lower lip as she feigned uncertainty. "Let me think..."

From the moment Bobby brought up the idea of teaming up, Kaia had already begun shaping the perfect setup in her head. Her birthday celebration was just around the corner, and it would be the ideal stage. If Verena happened to get caught stealing something during such a grand affair, the consequences would be swift and irreversible. The Bennett family would never let a woman with a stain like that marry into their family, and the marriage alliance would unravel effortlessly.

Kaia had already pictured the scene where Verena would be publicly embarrassed, and the thought filled her with anticipation.From the beginning, she struggled with the idea of sharing her parents' attention with someone else. The moment she met Verena, she found her cold detachment infuriating. What made things worse was that Verena showed no interest in trying to win her over, not even pretending to be agreeable. That quiet defiance only deepened her resentment.

Still, if anything devious was to happen, she knew better than to let herself appear behind it.

Her brows drew together as she played at thinking hard. "Honestly, I've got nothing. Maybe I should ask a friend of mine. She's never short on ideas."

Bobby saw right through her little act, though he let it slide without a word.

"Fine," he said simply, his tone unreadable.

With phone in hand, Kaia tapped at the screen with exaggerated purpose.

A moment later, she gave a bright little gasp. "She wrote back already!"

The truth was, her inbox was as empty as her performance was rehearsed.

With mock seriousness, she glanced at the screen andthen announced, "She thinks we should set Verena up. Something like making it look like she stole something. The Bennett family wouldn't stomach that in a daughter-in-law, right? Especially when she's already lied to you about her education. That would give your family every reason to call off the arrangement."

Bobby leaned back, his gaze steady and deliberate as it rested on her.

That look chipped at her confidence, and she softened her voice. "You probably think this is too low, don't you?If you want, I'll tell her to forget it."

Bobby watched the way she acted, all sweetness and flair, and sneered inwardly. The whole performance struck him as nothing but a polished lie.

Yet his answer was plain. "If the result works in our favor, the rest doesn't matter."

Their discussion wrapped up quickly after that, and Bobby wasted no time coming up with a reason to leave. Once outside, he reached for his phone and dialed a familiar contact.

Slater answered without hesitation, "What's up?"

"I need an update," Bobby said. "Have you found anything about the woman who pulled me out of trouble that day?"
###Chapter 14 Keep Warm
Bobby's hopeful expression deflated when Slater let out a weary sigh on the other end of the line."It's not that I'm unwilling to help," Slater said, his tone edged with frustration. "But you're giving me nothing solid to work with. Long hair, pretty face, soft voice... you just described half the women walking around downtown.And without cameras in that area, I'd be hunting for a ghost."

A wave of disappointment washed over Bobby. He'd set his heart on finding that perfect sister-in-law,but with so little to go on, he knew Slater couldn't work miracles.

"Fine, fine. Dinner's on me another day. I'll handle it myself," Bobby muttered, forcing a casual tone before ending the call.

...

For the past few days, Verena had buried herself in Isaac's medical records, combing through every detail with painstaking care.

Countless late nights had passed before she finally pinpointed a treatment plan she believed could work.

Closing the thick medical journal in front of her, she pressed her fingers to her temple, easing the dull ache in her head. With her free hand, she reached for her phone on the desk and opened the chat with Isaac.

She typed a short message.e you free?"

When Isaac read the notification, he didn't answer right away.

Since he sent his medical records to her that day, she hadn't reached out once, and he hadn't chased after a reply.

He had only been waiting, quietly, for news he told himself would never come. In his mind, the promise she'd made was nothing more than a moment's kindness. Surely, after seeing the bleak truth in his records, she would have let the matter drop. Seeing her name light up his screen sent an odd, unshakable ripple through Isaac, one he couldn't quite put into words.

His reply came clipped and restrained. "Need anything?"

A brief silence had stretched before Verena finally saw his message. Even in two short words, there was a chill in his tone, a wall he kept firmly between them.

Leaning back in her chair, she tapped out a response. "I've gone over your case thoroughly these past days.Because of your legs' unique complications, surgery will be extremely difficult-and I'm not in the right state to perform it now. But I can begin treatment using traditional medicine."

His brow lifted at that. "Traditional medicine?"

The reaction didn't surprise her, but she guessed he might be uneasy. Her fingers moved quickly over the keys. "Don't worry. My strength lies more in traditional methods than in modern procedures. For your condition, stabilizing it with traditional treatment before surgery gives us the best chance. I'm confident I can achieve a 70% success rate for your recovery."

Isaac's gaze sharpened instantly.

Seventy percent?

That wasn't a casual claim. Doctors were often cautions when talking about success rate, and if she was stating seventy percent outright, it meant the odds of failure were slimmer than most would dare to promise.

Other doctors had never been so bold-most gave him no more than a 30% chance. Yet here was Verena,speaking of 70% as though it were within reach. The number filled him with a strange mix of disbelief and a flicker of hope.

Was she simply reckless, or did she truly have the skill to back it up?

His hands shook slightly as he typed his answer. "Alright. Tell me when you're free, and we'll meet."

Verena replied quickly, "Okay."
 
The send button had barely been tapped before something occurred to her. "By the way, I haven't joined a hospital since returning to the country. When it's time for the operation,the hospital..."

Isaac quickly responded, "That's nothing for you to worry about. I'll see to the arrangements."

At her desk, Verena shifted in her seat, the cool air from the cracked window brushing against her skin.Outside, night had fallen, and the wind whistled low andsharp through the opening.

Clad in only a thin knit sweater, she hugged herself against the chill before rising to latch the window shut.

The movement brought an uninvited memory-Isaac's arms wrapping gently around her from behind, his voice low and cautious. "Verena, it's freezing. Don't push me away... let me keep you warm."

A lighthearted warmth threaded through his words, softened by the hint of teasing.

Much had shifted since those days.

Once, he had managed to win a place in her heart, only for their paths to separate. Then came the accident -a single moment that reshaped the course of his life entirely.

If not for Shawna's critical condition pulling her back home, and the headlines about him flashing across her screen, she might never have learned that his vanishing act had been the aftermath of a devastating car crash.

With that in mind, Verena let her fingers dance over the screen, typing with a sly curve to her lips. "My fiance, the air's turning cold. Keep yourself warm, especially those legs. Use gentle heat therapy, massage them often,keep the muscles working. Don't make me fret over you."

The message reached Isaac mid-thought. His grip faltered, and the pen slipped from his hand, clattering onto the desk before rolling to the floor.

After the accident, his family had cocooned him in silence, skirting around the subject of his injury. Even his last personal doctor, following Danica's orders, avoided speaking the wordin his presence, careful never to graze that raw nerve. The more delicately they tiptoed, the more he felt like something fragile-an artifact too brittle to endure a single crack. But Verena didn't flinch from it. She spoke plainly, giving him steps to care for himself as if nothing set him apart. With her, he felt like any other man. And yet... was she growing a little too at ease with calling him her fiance?

Isaac's gaze darkened slightly, his eyes fixed on the single word fiance as if trying to read between its letters.

"Alright. I'll keep that in mind."

A faint thought tugged at him-had he been too dlistant with her? His thumb moved almost on its own,pressing out another line. "Make sure you stay warm too."

Verena had stepped into the shower after sending the last message. She hadn't expected anything more from him. Yet, stepping out with damp hair and steam curling around her, she spotted two unread messages lighting up her phone-both from Isaac.

The corners of her mouth lifted as she read them, pulling forth a memory of him from before the accident stole pieces of who he was.

People always described Isaac as aloof, untouchable-a man who kept the world at arm's length. But with her, he'd been almost boyishly compliant.

If she was upset, he'd bow his head without hesitation, murmuring, "Alright. I get it. I won't make you upset again."

Shaking herself back into the present, Verena reminded herself of what truly mattered now. His legs came first. Everything else could wait its turn.

...

The evening of Kaia's birthday arrived.

The Willis Villa gleamed under layers of opulent decoration, every corner dressed for grandeur.Down in the sprawling room, a swirl of young socialites filled the space, their laughter and chatter weaving through the music. From the third floor, the sound of laughter floated up in bursts, but Verena ignored it entirely. Slipping into fresh clothes, she left through the villa's side door, heading for the garage.

The sleek black vehicle waiting there was courtesy of Alec.

Whatever existed between Alec and Laura toward her, affection wasn't part of it.

Still, Alec's stance was different from Laura's-where Laura thrived on taking from her, Alec's actions were steeped more in guilt than malice.

Moments later, the black vehicle eased through the villa gates and onto the road.

Meanwhile, a silver Cayenne approached from the opposite direction, Bobby at the wheel.

He wouldn't have bothered showing up for Kaia's birthday if it weren't for the need to block any potential alliance between the two families.

His grip on the steering wheel was relaxed, his pace unhurried.

A passing car caught his attention. At first, it was just a glance-until the half-lowered window revealed the face of a stunning woman at the wheel. His pulse jumped. That face...

"Hey!" Bobby called out, jerking the wheel in a sudden turn before flooring the accelerator to close the distance.

The pursuit didn't go unnoticed. Verena's brows drew together-she couldn't recall crossing anyone who'd have reason to follow her.

A glance at the rearview mirror showed the silver vehicle closing in, irritating her instantly.

With a flick of her wrist, she cut the wheel sharply, sending the black car veering into a new route without hesitation.

###Chapter 15 Failed Plan
The villa district wasn't packed with cars, but the streets split off in every direction.

Verena pressed harder on the accelerator and guided the wheel through turn after turn.

Bobby kept his eyes on her car as it slipped smoothly through each curve. He could tell she'd already spotted him.

She was almost gone from view. His foot hovered over the gas, but he hesitated. That severe crash had scarred their family, and he couldn't risk repeating the past. Still, if he stayed cautious,the perfect woman for his brother would get away.

That tug-of-war in his head cost him precious seconds. By the time he realized it, her car had vanished, and he'd steered straight onto a blocked-off road under construction.

"Damn it!" he exclaimed.

Over at Willis Villa, the party buzzed with chatter.

"Kaia, the clock's ticking. Shouldn't you already be up there kicking off the party?"

"Yeah, didn't you promise you'd choose a partner for the opening dance once things got started? We're dying to find out who the mystery man is."

Kaia's friends' voices carried a playful urgency.

She knew she should be on stage, but Bobby still hadn't shown up. She wanted everyone to see that he'd made the effort to come for her birthday.

Keeping her tone light, she said, "Just a little longer. There's one guest I'm still waiting for."

Her friends exchanged curious glances. "Who could possibly be that important?"

A warm flush spread across Kaia's cheeks. One of them grinned knowingly. "Oh, I see that blush. Don't tell me this 'guest' is more than just a casual acquaintance?"

Inside, Kaia's heart agreed, but she kept her smile composed.

She leaned closer to the young woman who just spoke and deliberately said in a hushed but teasing voice,"Don't spread such rumors. That guest is Bobby Bennett."

The words hung in the air for a beat before gasps and raised brows broke the quiet.

"Seriously? Bobby's actually coming?"

"Wait,did I hear you right? Bobby never shows up to birthday parties unless it's for Slater."

"Kaia, just spill it. What's going on between you two?"

The cluster of women watched her with eager eyes, their curiosity as obvious as their envy.

In her mind, Kaia heard Bobby's voice again, praising her for her kindness. She had never been certain about his feelings, but the way her friends were talking planted a hopeful thought.

Men liked gentle, genuine women. Bobby wasn't one to fake his words. That had to mean something...right?

Her face warmed, the heat creeping into her cheeks.

Thirty minutes had slipped by, yet there was still no sign of Bobby anywhere.

The same women who had envied her earlier now leaned close to whisper.

"Strange. She was so sure Bobby wouuld be here, but it's been forever."

"Do you think he ditched her?"

"Shh, lower your voice before she hears."

Kaia was standing close enough to catch every word. The anticipation she'd carried all evening curled into embarrassment.

Her fingers tightened around her glass. Pushing down the sting, she moved gracefully from guest to guest, raising her glass with the same practiced smile.

One gulp drained her wine. With her smile stilI fixed, she slipped onto the balcony and pulled out her phone.

Meanwhile, Bobby remained stranded on that half-finished road.

The place was nearly deserted, and the darkness only made it harder to find his way.

Bobby finally called for someone to pick him up. But before he could even pocket his phone, it lit up with another call.

Before Bobby could even say hello, an urgent voice rushed through the line. "Mr. Bennett, the party's starting any minute. When can we expect you?"

Getting the chance to meet the woman he thought could be the perfect sister-in-law should have been a win, yet he'd ended up chasing her straight onto a road closed for repairs. Losing sight of her and winding up lost had already soured his mood, and now Kaia's call pressed him for answers.

"I won't be making it," he said sharply. "If you still want to move ahead with the plan against Verena,have Slater take over. Call him yourself."

To anyone looking in from the outside, Bobby and Slater were nearly inseparable. So when Bobby had agreed to show up for Kaia's birthday, Slater had casually decided to go too.

Her stomach dropped at his words. Was he really bailing? After she'd told everyone he was coming? The thought of facing the guests now made her skin prickle.

Kaia fought to keep her temper in check and spoke in a calm tone. "Mr. Bennett, is there something pressing that's holding you up? We made an agreement to work side by side, yet the plan hasn't even begun and now you're pulling away?"

Rather than explain, Bobby ended the call without another word, unwilling to waste more time.

The flat tone on the line made Kaia's grip on her phone tighten. Heat rose to her face and her breathing grew uneven, the sting of frustration sharp in her chest.

But she forced herself to remember the bigger picture-Verena's wedding to Isaac needed to be stopped, and that mattered more than her pride right now.

Pushing the anger down, she pulled up Slater's contact and hit call.

The call went through without delay, and Kaia spoke without preamble. "Hi, Slater, this is Kaia. Are you around?"

In truth, his familiarity with her was minimal. Most of what he knew came from Bobby, and nothing in those accounts made her seem like someone he could fully trust.

Slater had never approved of Kaia, yet politeness kept his tone steady as he said, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis.My grandfather suddenly fell ill, and I need to stay with himn. I can't leave right now, but I'll make sure someone delivers a gift on my behalf."

Normally, receiving a gift from someone of Slater's influence would have been enough to make Kaia's evening. Tonight, however, was about more than her birthday-it was the perfect chance to deal with Verena, and his absence was a blow.

"Alright, I understand," she replied, though the stiffness in her voice betrayed her disappointment.

The call ended, and her jaw tightened. So muchfor help-at the moment she needed allies the most, they all had somewhere else to be. Looked like she'd have to handle this herself.

Taking the stairs two at a time, she headed for the last room at the far end of the third-floor hall.

Her knuckles rapped against the door, and her voice carried through it. "Verena, it's me. The party's started -come downstairs."

Not a single word came back to her.

A twinge of unease crept in. She twisted the handle and stepped inside.

The quiet inside the room felt heavy. She called Verena's name again as she crossed the space, but the silence stayed unbroken.

Though part of her already suspected the truth, she moved methodically, unwilling to overlook even the smallest hiding place. The bathroom was empty. So was the wardrobe. Not a single sign of anyone.

Hands curling into fists, she turned to leave, spotting a servant walking past in the corridor.

"Have you seen Verena?" she asked sharply.

The servant shook her head. "No, Miss.I haven't."

Kaia's temper flared. Not seen Verena? As if she could simply vanish without notice.

Kaia wondered when Verena had left and how she had missed it.
###Chapter 16 Stop Bothering Me


"Alright. Go finish your work," Kaia said, her words clipped and cold.

The moment the servant disappeared down the hall, her restraint shattered. Fists tightening in midair, she swept the stack of files off Verena's desk without even glancing at them, the papers scattering as she stormed out.

She returned to the ground floor living room still wearing the same hard expression.

Laura had just wrapped up chatting with a group of guests when she spotted Kaia's look. Concern etched her face as she crossed the room.

Her hand rested lightly on Kaia's cheek. "Sweetheart, is something bothering you? You don't seem like yourself.Are you alright?"

It wasn't sickness draining the color from Kaia's face-it was the heat of her anger.

Her teeth pressed into her lower lip as she forced the emotion down, but her eyes began to glisten,reddening until they looked ready to spill over.

Just as expected, the sight of her in that state threw Laura off balance. "Honey, what happened? Did someone give you trouble? Just say the word and I'll take care of it."

A small sniffle escaped as Kaia answered in a trembling voice, "No one's bullying me, Mom. I'm just... really disappointed."

"Disappointed?" Laura asked, brows knitting. "About what?"

Drawing in a steadying breath, Kaia lowered her voice."It's my eighteenth birthday. I was so happy, because for the first time, my friends and the whole family were here to celebrate. I went upstairs to bring Verena down so we could cut the cake together, but-"
 
The rest was carried away by a tear that finally broke free. Laura's mouth tightened. "So? She refused to come?"

Kaia's head moved slowly from side to side. "I knocked, but no one answered. When I opened the door... she wasn't even there."

Laura's frown grew more pronounced, and Kaia pressed her teeth into her lip, doing her best to mask the quiet hint of triumph tugging at her mouth. Her tone turned soft and uncertain. "It's my eighteenth birthday,a huge milestone for me, bout Verena didn't even show up. Mom... do you think she can't stand me? Did I mess up so badly she's going out of her way to stay away?"

Tears slid down her cheeks, completing the picture of wounded innocence.

The sight made Laura's heart ache, and she pulled Kaia into her arms.

"No, sweetheart, of course not. You're wonderful-anyone would like you. This isn't about you. It's Verena's fault. She grew up in a backwater place and still hasn't adjusted to city life."

Even in their quiet corner, a few guests glanced over at the scene.

Laura's hand stroked Kaia's shoulder. "Don't cry, people are watching. Go and mingle with the guests. I'll talk to Verena myself."

With a quick dab at her eyes, Kaia nodded. "Alright, Mom. But please don't be too hard on her. Maybe...maybe something more important came up."

That hint of generosity softened Laura's expression, though it sharpened her annoyance toward Verena.

Laura's tone sharpened with irritation as she spoke. "She's got nothing going on all day,so what could possibly matter more than showing up for your eighteenth birthday?"

Kaia caught the look on Laura's face and knew Verena was in fora scolding. The sting from her earlier setback began to fade.

After a few more soft words between them, Kaia straightened her posture and returned to the party, her smile back in place.

Once she was gone, Laura stepped outside to the quiet of the backyard, pulling her phone from her pocket to make a call.

Out on the road, Verena glanced at her ringing phone, the caller ID confirming exactly what conversation was waiting for her.

The moment Verena picked up, Laura's voice came fast and sharp. "Where are you? It's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Why aren't you here? Get back right now!"

With one hand steady on the wheel, Verena gave a quiet, amused chuckle. "Can you explain why I'm supposed to care about Kaia's birthday party?"

That answer nearly made Laura snap-Verena had never been one to obey her.

"She's your sister! How can you act like it has nothing to do with you? It's not often we're all together for Kaia's birthday, and you just slipped away like it didn't matter. What's going on with you? Do you really need a personal invitation before you'll bother to come?"

Verena let out a cold, disdainful scoff at that. So this was what Laura called a family celebration? The truth was laughable. All Laura wanted was to parade her around like some prized token-to show everyone that the Willis family had opened their arms to the girl raised far from privilege. That kind of story, if told the right way,would polish the family name like nothing else.

Exposing Laura's motives wasn't worth the effort.

A sharp laugh escaped Verena's lips before she spoke. "So now you remember me because it's Kaia's eighteenth birthday. Funny, because where were you when it was mine? Where was the family then? Or did I stop counting as family back then?"

Laura went quiet. A flicker of guilt pricked at her, but it was gone almost as quickly as it came.

Verena had a clear sense of what was running through Laura's mind, but she also knew that any flicker of guilt would fade quickly, especially with Kaia and Luka nearby, soaking up all her affection.

Verena's voice turned cold. "I told you before, stop bothering me. What I said before was a threat,and I mean it. Keep pestering me over these petty things, and I'Il make sure you don't get anything you're after." Verena ended the call without waiting for a reply.

Verena's words left Laura frozen, too shocked to form a response. It wasn't until the dull,mechanical tone buzzed in her ear that the full weight of Verena's rudeness hit her. That tone, that attitude-who did she think she was, speaking to her like that?

Laura's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white, her face clouded with fury. I it weren't for the party already underway and guests mingling throughout the place, she would've ordered someone to haul Verena back for a proper scolding.

...

Elsewhere, barely a mninute after ending the call, Verena's phone lit up again.

Expecting Laura to continue her tirade, she glanced at the screen and saw a different name-Barrie Lyons,a former patient.

She answered without hesitation, "Mr. Lyons, what's going on?"

The reply came in an older, slightly hoarse voice. "Dr. Willis, are you still overseas?"

"I'm not," Verena responded plainly. "I'm back. In Shoildon, actually."

"That's excellent news. I'm in Shoildon too," Barrie replied, the relief clear in his tone.

He wasted no time getting to the point. "The old problem with my right leg started acting up again. The pain hit so hard earlier I almost lost consciousness. I had a doctor come to the house, but nothing he did made a difference. I've finished the medicaton you prescribed. If it's not too much trouble, would you be able to come by?"

Verena had no real obligations that evening. She simply needed to breathe away from the suffocating atmosphere of the Willis Villa. So availability wasn't the problem. And when it came to her own patients, she never hesitated-no matter the hour, she always made it a priority to reach them as soon as possible.

"Of course," she said. "Send me your address, and I'll head over now."

Barrie dictated the location, and Verena keyed it into her GPS.

Her foot pressed harder on the gas, the car picking up speed.
###Chapter 17 Beautiful Yet Untouchable


Less than an hour later, Verena pulled up outside a sprawling private estate where a middle-aged man stood waiting at the gate.

The moment she stepped out, the man walked briskly toward her. "You must be Dr. Willis, right?"

When she nodded to confirm it, he said warmly, gesturing for her to follow, "Great, this way."

They moved through the corridors and entered a room lined with gleaming display cases, each one filled with medals and awards. An elderly man lay propped on a bed, sweat beading his forehead as a younger man helped him sip water.

"Bring the medical kit-now," Barrie instructed as soon as he spotted Verena.

His gaze shifted to the younger man. "Slater, get a chair for Dr. Willis."

Slater grabbed a chair without delay, but when he turned around and was about to gesture for Dr. Willis to sit, he froze, his attention caught entirely by the woman before him.

The first thing that stuck him was how effortlessly beautiful she was-delicate features framed by an air of quiet confidence. The second was disbelief. Could this poised young woman really be the famed Dr. Willis his grandfather often praised?

He gave a quick blink, forcing himself back to the moment before offering her a courteous smile. "Please,Dr. Willis, take this seat."

"Thank you," Verena replied, her tone warm as she accepted.

The smile she gave him felt like the first breath of spring air after a long winter.

A simple curve of her lips shouldn't have left an impression, yet it stirred something faint in his chest.

While he steadied himself, theservants entered with the prepared medical instruments. Verena reached for a pair of scissors, glancing at Barrie. "I'll need to cut the fabric above your knee to examine the injury "Do whatever you must," Barrie said firmly, not flinching despite the sweat sliding down his temple.

With a swift and steady motion, she sliced the trouser leg cleanly up to the thigh, her movements practiced and precise.

The damage beneath was impossible to miss-skin swollen tight, bruises blooming around the wound.

It wwas the same leg that had carried a bullet wound from Barrie's youth, a reminder of the battle that left him with a burden he would never fully escape.

The injury had happened years back, but the pain never truly left him. As the seasons shifted from autumn to winter, it flared with such intensity that sleep became a rare luxury, whether it was day or night.

Gasps rippled through the room the moment everyone caught sight of the swollen knee.

Concern etched itself across Slater's face as his gaze lingered on the injury.

Without letting her expression shift, Verena leaned closer for a precise look. "I'm going to begin with the treatment. It might sting, so try to hold still."

A dry chuckle escaped Barrie. "I've endured worse in my time. This willbe nothing."

"You still carry the grit of a soldier, Mr. Lyons," Verena replied, the praise genuine in her tone.

Their history as doctor and patient meant Barrie knew what kind of tools she might need and had them prepared.

Though the world knew her for her surgical skill, her deepest strength lay in the art of traditional medicine.

One of the driving forces behind her studies in Clokron had been the desire to unite the best of both traditional and modern medicine, giving her patients every advantage in recovery.

From the medical bag, she drew out an assortment of silver needles, each chosen for a specific point, and placed them with flawless precision.

From the corner, Slater watched the confident rhythm of her hands, the quiet focus in her eyes,and couldn't help but be struck by how capable she seemed.

Once the final needle was in place, Barrie's face had turned ashen, and the veins along his forehead throbbed visibly beneath his skin.

"My grandfather looks like he needs water," Slater said, his brow knitting in worry.

Still jotting notes onto a prescription pad, Verena responded flatly, "That won't be necessary. This reaction is expected. He'll be fine in a moment."

Her words proved true. Within minutes, the strain in Barrie's face eased, color returned, and the chill in his leg was replaced by a spreading warmth.

"Only you can take away this pain, Dr. Willis," Barrie remarked, relief clear in his voice.

Slater exhaled slowly, the tension leaving his shoulders, though amazement still lingered.

His eyes shifted to Verena, who sat with her head gently bowed, completely focused on jotting down the prescription. A few loose strands framed her face, and there was something quietly captivating in the way she moved. It made it nearly impossible to pull his gaze away.

Many women had caught Slater's eye before, yet none carried the kind of presence Verena did. What he felt wasn't the fleeting thrill of attraction, but something sharper, weightier-an awareness that she stood on a level far above his reach.

It wasn't the pull of romance; it was the quiet reverence a person might feel when looking at the moon,knowing it was beautiful yet untouchable.

Twenty minutes passed before Verena began removing the silver needles from Barrie's leg with practiced care.

"The medicine's ready," she said, her tone calm but deliberate. "This time, Mr. Lyons, you need to stick to the plan. Your condition's been dragged out far too long. We might not be able to heal it completely, but we can take most of the pain away. Take the medicine, rest properly, and in this weather-keep warm at all times." Barrie, who once commanded the room like a general, now looked almost shy.

"Thank you, Dr. Willis. I'll take your advice seriously this time," he said with a sheepish chuckle.

The change in him caught Slater off guard. He wasn't used to seeing his grandfather defer to anyone.

Seeing Barrie's sheepish look, Verena offered a light smile. "It's getting late. I should be going."

Just as she was getting ready to leave, Barrie turned to Slater and spoke without hesitation."Make sure you settle the payment with Dr. Willis."

She shook her head, still smiling. "There's no fee. I didn't provide the medicine or the tools. Just spent some time on the treatment. Besides, after everything you've done for our country,helping you is an honor."

A man like Barrie, a soldier who had fought and bled for his country, was someone she held in the highest regard.

Her words seemed to warm him even more.

"You're young, yet your skills are outstanding, and your manner is even better," he said with genuine admiration.

Then his eyes shifted toward Slater, mischief creeping into his voice. "If my grandson were as capable as you, I'd have encouraged him to try to win you over."

Slater's cheeks flushed the moment he heard those words. "Come on, Grandpa, where did that even come from?"

Used to handling moments like this with grace, Verena offered a steady, courteous reply. "Your grandson is devoted and respectful. I'm sure the woman he marries will be someone truly special."

Barrie had already braced himself for her refusal to give his grandson a chance, but even so, a faint sense of regret settled in. A granddaughter-in-law like her was simply out of reach.

###Chapter 18 Ideal Sister-In-Law VS Traditional Medicine Doctor


After Verena walked out, Slater's curiosity got the better of him. He turned to his grandfather and asked,"Grandpa, this Dr. Willis seems incredible. Who exactly is she?"

Instead of answering directly, Barrie posed his own question. "When you first laid eyes on her, did it cross your mind that someone so young might not be capable?"

Slater gave an awkward scratch to his nose but admitted with a nod that he had thought so.

A proud smile spread across Barrie's face as his eyes lit up. "She's the surgeon who gave me my new heart in Clokron."

Shock spread across Slater's face. "You mean she really did that?"

Remembering how deftly Verena had handled the traditional treatment earlier, Slater tilted his head. "But isn't she a traditional medicine doctor? How could she manage a heart transplant?"

Barrie laughed softly and spoke with weight in his voice. "She's a rare talent."

It wasn't often that Slater heard such praise from his grandfather. The more he thought about it, the more respect he felt for the striking Dr.Willis.

As the night wore on, Slater applied medicine to Barrie's wound. Once the treatment was finished and his grandfather had drifted into sleep, he stepped quietly from the room.

That was when his phone buzzed with a call from Bobby.

Without any small talk, Bobby asked, "Why weren't you at Kaia's birthday party tonight either?"

He had just arrived home and called Kaia, planning to check on the outcome of the night. Instead, she told him that neither he nor Slater had been there, and worse, Verena had been absent too, which meant the plan had fallen apart.

Kaia's voice trembled over theline, carrying the sound of hurt and frustration. Bobby wasn't overly concerned about the failed attempt. Since Verena wasn't marrying Isaac immediately,there would be other chances to make sure the wedding never happened. What he truly wanted to know at that moment was why Slater had stayed away.

Once Bobby gave Kaia a few words of comfort, he ended the call and immediately rang Slater.

As he walked back to his room, Slater explained why he hadn't shown up at the party. "I was on my way out the door when my grandfather started feeling worse again. I couldn't leave him like that, so I stayed with him instead."

Knowing the seriousness of the old man's health, Bobby's voice grew concerned right away. "How is he doing now?"

Slater thought of the calm, dignified face before answering, "Relax, an incredible doctor stopped by and used a special kind of traditional treatment. He's doing fine now."

Relief washed over Bobby's voice. "Glad to hear that."

Only then did Slater realize something about Bobby's earlier question. "Hold on. You asked me why I weren't at Kaia's party EITHER. Does that mean you weren't there either?"

A long sigh came through the phone. "Don't get me started," Bobby retorted. "On my way to the WVillis Villa,I ran into the woman I consider my ideal sister-in-law, but I ended up losing track of her."

That statement left Slater confused. "Your ideal sister-in-law? I thought you couldn't stand Verena. Since when did she become your ideal sister-in-law?"

A short, dismissive scoff came from Bobby. "I'm not talking about that liar."

His thoughts drifted back to the day of his car accident. In his hazy state on the ground, he had opened his eyes to see a striking face and heard a soft, reassuring voice.

"I mean the gorgeous woman who pulled me out of that wreck,", he continued.

The memory of that moment and what happened tonight had him grinning like a man hopelessly smitten."You know what happened? She drove past me tonight with her hair down, and for a second,I saw her through the half-lowered window. She looked incredible. Even as she broke away from my pursuit, all I could think was that I'd never seen anyone so effortlessly cool. If you'd been there, you would've felt the same.There's something about her that just pulls you in. She's stunning. That's exactly why I keep saying she's perfect to be my sister-in-law!"

By the end, his tone brimmed with enthusiasm, pride spilling into his words as though she were already part of his family and he was boasting to his closest friend.

Slater narrowed his eyes in doubt. "That sounds over the top. Is she really as impressive as you claim?"

Thinking of the woman who had treated his grandfather, Slater let out a laugh before Bobby could reply.With a hint of rivalry in his tone, he said, "That woman you keep calling your ideal sister-in-law doesn't even come close to the traditional medicine doctor I met tonight. She's thoughtful, well-spoken, and carries herself with real grace. Her skills are no joke-just a few needles and some herbs, and my grandfather was finally able to rest. And honestly, she's beautiful too."

Bobby gave a dismissive snort. "No way. The woman I've set my sights on is far more beautiful. You must not have seen many real beauties to think otherwise."

A sly grin crept into his voice as he teased, "Slater, has your sense of beauty gone downhill lately?"

The moment his taste was mocked, Slater responded instantly, "Look who's talking. I'm willing to bet that your so-called ideal sister-in-law is just a plain-looking nobody."

Bobby's eyes went wide as he practically yelled into the phone. "Don't you dare insult my ideal sister-in-law!"

Slater kept pushing. "Who even is your sister-in-law? She doesn't know you, yet you're bold enough to claim her as your family."

The heat rose in Bobby's face, turning it a deep red, and his neck stiffened as he argued back without holding anything in.

Neither willing to back down, the two young men, barely past their teens, bickered like schoolboys until the argument fizzled out without a winner. Verena had spent the night studying Isaac's condition, working until nearly dawn before finally falling asleep.By the time she opened her eyes again, the clock was edging toward noon.

Her phone lay beside her pillow, and she picked it up to send a message to lsaac.

"Do you have time later today? I'd like to sit down with you and talk through the specifics of your treatment."

Isaac was on his way to a press conference when her message came through.

Reading her words made him pause for a moment, his mind turning to the thought of surgery.Other doctors weren't positive about his leg condition. He wondered if going under the knife was even possible.

A swirl of emotions moved through Isaac, tinged with unease, yet the pull of anticipation was impossible to ignore. More than anything, he wanted to walk again and return to living as he once had.

Dropping his gaze, Isaac let his long thumb tap across the keyboard. "I'm available. If it works for you, we can meet right now."

When Verena read his reply, she could clearly see the depth of his desire to regain the use of his legs.

She answered simply, "Of course."

Not long after she sent her message, Isaac followed up with a list of restaurants offering various cuisines.

Verena picked one from the list and responded, "See you soon."

Once the message was sent, she set her phone aside and climbed out of bed to freshen up.

Isaac pocketed his phone and gave the driver a clear order. "Take us back and drive straight to Milo's Gourmet."

With a respectful nod, the driver replied, "Yes." He then steered the car into a U-turn at the intersection.

Though uncertain, the assistant seated up front still spoke up. "Mr. Bennett, should we just forget about the press conference..." Isaac's tone remained light. "There are plenty of people handling it. They don't need me there just for appearances."


What he said was the truth. His attendance at the event served no real purpose beyond ceremony.
###Chapter 19 Familiarity


The past weeks had drained Isaac, leaving him running on barely four hours of sleep from the night before.Events like this hardly seemed worth his time.

Reading his mood, the assistant simply replied, "Understood. I'll let them know."

Roughly an hour later, Verena's car rolled up to the venue.

The restaurant radiated charm-every corner was dressed in elegance, with subtle touches of romance that softened the air.

A waiter greeted her at the entrance and led her toward a secluded private room.

Pausing at the door, he knocked, and then pushed it open with a polite announcement."Mr. Bennett,your guest has arrived."

Verena stepped inside, and the door closed quietly behind her.

From his wheelchair, Isaac's gaze followed her every step.

Her white dress brushed her ankles, a camel shawl resting gently on her shoulders, while her hair spilled down her back likea glossy waterfall.

There were no designer tags or ostentatious brands on her, yet she carried herself with a presence that made society's most polished women seem ordinary. The old saying came to mind-true elegance was born from beauty, figure, and poise. She possessed all three in abundance.

For the briefest moment, something familiar stirred in Isaac's mind... but before he could pin it down, the feeling slipped away.

Seeing Isaac's gaze fixed on her, Verena smiled warmly and greeted him, "Mr. Bennett, it's been a while."

That smile of hers hit him harder than expected, and for a fleeting second, Isaac felt like a thief caught in the act of staring. Inclining his head, he said evenly, "Please, take a seat, Miss Willis."

Verena didn't bother with pleasantries. She sat down and spoke with clarity. "I've reviewed every detaii of your medical records. It's not as severe as it seems. Just set a date, and we can start treatment."

His fingers tightened slightly on the armrest before he asked, "You're the first doctor to sound this certain.Are you absolutely sure?"

She could tell his doubt wasn't directed at her, but at the disappointment he'd endured. Hope was a fragile thing for someone who had been let down too many times.

Leaning forward, she laced her fingers beneath her chin and met his eyes. "You told me you'd trust me. So why hesitate now?"

Her voice carried a gentle lilt, almost coaxing.

Isaac blinked, his gaze sliding away as though her eyes were too much to hold.

Her lips curved in amusement. "What's wrong? Do you truly not believe me?"

His head lifted instinctively, only to find her watching him with a brightness that seemed to outshine the rest of the room. He turned away almost instantly.

After a short pause, his voice dropped to a quiet, "Sorry."

Something about his own reaction unsettled him. Other women never rattled his composure, yet around Verena, the steady ground he stood on felt uncertain-like he was in unfamiliar territory with no map to guide him.

Catching the way he avoided her gaze, Verena remained silent for a moment, and then let out a soft,playful laugh.

Isaac's eyes lifted toward her, catching the curve of her smile.

A faint crease formed between his brows. "You..."

"What's with the solemn face, Mr. Bennett?" she asked, her tone light. The sound of her laughter held an unfamiliar warmth, so unlike her usual composed reserve, carrying an ease that felt almost inviting.

Realizing she was poking fun at him, Isaac's lips curved in a faint, reluctant smile.

When the waiter arrived with their food, the mood shifted into something more casual, their conversation flowing lightly.

Isaac kept his answers brief, letting Verena guide most of the exchange.

They hadn't gotten far when the waiter, stepping back after setting down a plate, accidentally brushed the edge of the thin blanket over Isaac's knees with the walkie-talkie clipped to his pocket, sending it tumbling to the floor.

The man immediately murmured an apology, but Verena was already on her feet. "Don't worry about it, 1'lI handle it," she said quickly.

Isaac's gaze followed her as she bent to retrieve it and walked toward him, a subtle frown crossing his face.

Knowing Isaac cared about cleanliness, Verena had stopped the waiter's intention to pick up the blanket and put it back on his legs.

She shook out the blanket neatly and set it on the chair beside him, her movements smooth and deliberate.

Isaac had just opened his mouth to refuse when Verena knelt gracefully at his side.

Without a word, she slipped the shaw from her shoulders and spread it carefully across his legs,her fingertips lingering as she smoothed the fabric, grazing his thighs in fleeting touches.

He, however, felt no sensation in his legs-only a strange mix of unease and familiarity as he studied her closeness. Why did it feelas though this level of tenderness belonged to a deeper bond? Was it merely because she was his future wife?

"This blanket is far too thin. Make sure you swap it for something warmer when you're home," Verena murmured.

When he looked up again, she was back in her seat, the table between them once more. His eyes drifted toward her hands, and his voice came quietly. "Thanks."

Her gaze swept over him, a faint crease forming on her brow. "Why's your face suddenly flushed?"

That made him blink, caught off guard.

She ddn't look away, noting the warm tint across his cheeks and the slight haze clouding his eyes.

Rising, Verena stepped to his side, gently pushing back his hair to rest her palm against his forehead.

As she leaned in to check his temperature, her body closed the space between them.

Isaac's spine went rigid as a faint, soothing fragrance drifted into his senses, his line of sight now framed by her flawless features.

A sharp thud of awareness struck his chest.

Lowering his gaze, he felt his pulse quicken beyond reason.

Without the shawl on her shoulders now, the elegance of her silhouette beneath the snug knit dress became more obvious.

A knot formed in his throat, and he almost turned away-until her firm voice cut in, "Stay still."

Though her tone carried an edge, it oddly wrapped him in a sense of comfort.

Isaac's head dipped instinctively, eyes closing as his fingers clamped hard around the wheelchair's armrests.



"You're running a fever," Verena murmured with a slight frown, pressing the call button on the table.

She had assumed his flushed face was from embarrassment, but clearly, it wasn't.

A waiter appeared moments later.

With calm politeness, she suggested, "Please bring some fever medicine."

The server nodded and departed without delay. When the medicine arrived, she scanned the instructions, poured a glass of water, and extended both toward him. "Here, take these."

"Thank you." Isaac studied the pills inhis palm before asking quietly, "Why do you..."

The question hovered on his tongue-why did she care about him so much?

Halfway through forming the words, his gaze locked with the lively light in Verena's eyes. A quiet chuckle escaped him, and he gave a small shake of his head. "Forget it."

After he swallowed the pills, she leaned back slightly and asked, "Have you decided on the hospital for the operation? Once we finish the first stage of treatment, surgery will still be necessary." 
###Chapter 20 What Makes You Trust Her This Much


With a small nod, Isaac said, "I've already chosen one. It's a private hospital that belongs to the Bennett family."

Verena took note of how unwell he seemed. "That's good. The privacy there will be secure," she said. "WNe'll stop here for today. Just let me know once you've decided on the exact date for the treatment."

Almost without hesitation, Isaac answered,"A week from now."

Once the time was set, the two went their separate ways.

When Isaac settled back into his car, his observant assistant immediately noticed that the "blanket"covering his lap was not the same as before.

"Did something happen, Mr. Bennett?" the assistant asked.

The stare from the front seat was hard to miss. Isaac opened the file resting on his lap and gave a short cough. "It's nothing."

Catching the strain in his voice, the assistant asked, "Are you feeling sick?"

Without looking up from the file, Isaac replied in a steady tone, "I've got a fever."

"I can run out and get some medicine right now," the assistant suggested.

"I already have some," Isaac said. "Just keep this from mny mother."

Since the accident, Danica had been quick to worry whenever his health showed even the slightest decline.

The assistant knew better than most how protective Danica had become.

"Understood," the assistant replied with a nod.

The mention of medicine brought Isaac's thoughts back to the restaurant, to the moment he nearly asked Verena why she treated him with such care. What was the reason behind her concern? Part of him assumed it was nothing more than a fiancée's obligation. Perhaps the Bennett family had something she wanted.

Yet beneath those guesses lingered a faint, unshaped hope-though even he could not say exactly what it was.

Out of nowhere, Isaac remembered the two questions Verena had asked him in the past. The first had been on the day they met, when she wanted to know if he recalled anything about Dragon Quarter in Clokron.

The second had come through a message, where she asked if he truly did not remember her.

A strange, hard-to-name feeling surged through him, clouding his thoughts.

He shut the file in front of him, leaned back against the seat, and pressed his fingers to his brow in an effort to clear his head and push aside the thoughts he didn't need.



That afternoon, Isaac's phone rang. It was his friend, Cayden Moore.

Cayden said, "Stop by the hospital tomorrow. I'll go ahead and run a few tests while you're there."

A master's graduate from Acorith College of Medicine, Cayden had built an impressive reputationin his field.


Following the car accident, the Bennett family had called in other renowned doctors to examine Isaac, but Cayden was the one who had consistently been at his side.

With only a week left before the scheduled treatment with Verena, Isaac felt that Cayden deserved to know the situation as both his doctor and his friend.

He chose to be upfront about it and said, "I'm scheduled for surgery next week."

"What? Hold on-what are you talking about?" Cayden's voiçe jumped in alarm. "What kind of surgery?What exactly do you mean?"

Isaac answered, "I found a doctor who believes she can treat my condition with a decent chance of success.She says it's around seventy percent, and I'm willing to take that shot."

"Say that again?" Cayden's disbelief was clear, as if he couldn't trust his own hearing. "Seventy percent?Who would dare make that claim? Even I can only be thirty percent confident with your case."

The frustration in his voice lingered before he paused, and then spoke more carefully. "Isaac, I get that you're eager to get back on your feet, but this isn't something you can rush. Don't let desperation push you into a reckless decision."

From his wheelchair, Isaac stared out at the view from the office building.

"I understand," he said quietly. The memory of those eyes, so familiar they almost hurt to remember, rose in his mind. "But I want to trust her."

Cayden's curiosity burned to know who had convinced Isaac of something so far-fetched. "Tell me her name.Which world-class doctor is it?"

"Verena Willis," Isaac answered.

The name made Cayden search his memory. He was familiar with countless renowned physicians across the globe, yet this one drew a blank.

"Who exactly is she? I've never heard of her. What's her story?" Cayden asked further.

Isaac hesitated. Her background? Should he tell Cayden she was the eldest daugter of the Willis family,or admit she was his future wife?

The image of Verena kneeling before him flashed through Isaac's mind, her voice soft as she said, "Don't turn me away." He paused, his throat tightening for a moment, and then quietly answered, "She's my fiancée."

That single word froze Cayden in place, leaving him silent for a few moments.

"What did you just say?" he asked wth a frown. "Isn't your fiancée the eldest daughter of the Willis family who didn't grow up with her parents?"

Cayden normally tunedout that kind of news, but beca use Isaac was a friend, he'd picked up a few things Cayden continued, his voice rising, "Isaac, have you even heard what people are saying about her? She never attended college, so where exactly did she learn how to practice medicine? She's even been lying about graduating from Pine Hill University. And you've only had one meal with her, haven't you? What makes you trust her this much?"

Isaac barely drew in a breath before Cayden interjected, "Absolutely not. A woman like that cannot be trusted.Wait before you do anything reckless. I'll dig into her background myself."

Isaac started to reply, but the call had already ended. His forehead tightened in an involuntary frown.Cayden's logic was hard to argue with. After all, he had met Verena only once. Why did he trust her so much? Yet the way his friend dismissed Verena left an unpleasant weight in his chest.

Respected as a promising young physician, Cayden was often invited back to his old university to give lectures.

When his last class wrapped up that afternoon, he had intended to begin gathering information, only to spot Kaia walking down the corridor.

The sight made his eyes brighten. As Verena's sister, she might be the perfect source to question.

He strode toward her and called out, "Kaia."

She was moving alongside two other women, heading for their next lesson.

The sound of Kaia's name made her companions exchange curious glances in her direction.

A flicker of pleasure crossed Kaia's face. She was well aware that Cayden was one of Isaac's closest friends.Though his status didn't rival Isaac's, it still far exceeded her own.

At their university, Cayden held the quiet admiration of many female students.

She slid a stray lock of hair behind her ear and offered him a warm smile. "Professor Moore, is something the matter?"

Cayden inclined his head slightly. "I need to ask you a question. Are you free right now?" Kaia looked at her friends. They traded looks full of envy before slipping away to give them space.

Their reactions made Kaia feel a surge of pride, and she replied with a warm smile, "It's my pleasure to help you,Professor Moore."

Cayden wasted no time. "Did your sister Verena study medicine?"

The question left her momentarily speechless. He had stopped her just to bring up Verena? First Bobby, and now Cayden. People she had once admired from afar and never dreamed of approaching were suddenly seeking her out, all because of her sister.
###Chapter 21 I'm Here To Pick Up Miss Verena Willis


Kaia seethed inwardly. If these people wanted to know all about Verena, then she would paint them a picture of just how "outstanding" Verena was. For a split second, she did not feel so let down.

She straightened up right away, and then spoke with an offhand tone. "Verena is, more or less, a doctor.From what I've heard, she spent some time at a little clinic back in the village, picking up old remedies from a village healer who never went to school for it. Treating something as minor asa cold is probably her limit."

Cayden's brow furrowed as he processed that. A tiny clinic in the village? Taking care of nothing but a cold?Someone practicing folk medicine thinking she could perform surgery?

As Kaia spoke with that doubtful note in her voice, Cayden wondered how lsaac could have fallen for anything so outrageous. The whole story sounded likea farce to him. For Verena to claw her way into the Bennett family, she seemed willing to say anything. Pretending to have a fancy degree was one thing,but acting like she could perform actual surgery was going too far.

When he had thanked Kaia, Cayden turned and walked away.

As she watched him disappear into the distance, Kaia's lips curved into a sly smirk.

She had no idea who he would pass this information along to, yet the thought of Verena being dismissed as incompetent filled her with deep satisfaction.

After all, she wasn't even bending the truth. Verena really had been nothing more thana village-trained healer in a remote place.


···

When the meeting ended, Isaac's assistant handed him his phone. "Mr. Bennett, Mr. Moore tried calling four times."

Isaac tugged at his tie and accepted the phone. "Alright. You can go now." After the assistant walked out, Isaac dialed Cayden's number.

The moment the call connected, Cayden spoke in a rush. "Isaac, listen to me, you cannot allow Verena to operate on you. I just discovered she used to work in a small clinic. She learned everything from a self-taught healer in her village and never went through proper medical training. I've studied your case for months, and even then I only have a thirty percent chance of success. Yet she, who never even set foot in a real medical school, claims she has seventy percent. Isaac, don't you think that's strange?"

With a grave tone, Cayden added, "Besides, a surgery of this scale isn't something to hand over to just anyone. Isaac, you have to take responsibility for yourself. Your condition has already gone through too many failed procedures, and you know better than anyone how dangerous another attempt could be. I've studied several different approaches, but none promise success. And with medicine advancing every day, if the timing isn't right, we can still wait. But if this operation goes wrong and causes permanent damage, you could..."

Cayden almost told Isaac he could end up bound to a wheelchair for life, yet the words caught in his throat.

Isaac understood anyway. He sat frozen with the phone in his hand, letting Cayden speak without interruption.

Cayden continued, "Verena's entire experience comes from a tiny clinic, and she might not even know how to handle a scalpel properly in an operating room. You must not let her be the one to operate on you."

Suddenly recalling another option, Cayden interjected, "Isaac, you've heard of Evelyn Rowe, the famous surgeon overseas, haven't you? The mysterious doctor is one of the top authorities in this field. I reached out to them on your behalf, but because of certain complications, they haven't replied yet. Just give me two more days, and I'll find a way to get through to them."

Isaac understood that Cayden's concern was genuine. He bowed his head and stayed quiet for a long moment.

Cayden had made sense.

His faith in Verena had no solid ground. Maybe it was only because she had been the one to crouch beside him and speak after his injury. "Cayden, I appreciate it. I'll think it over again."

The following day, Verena opened a message from her assistant, Julianna Ford.

The message said, "Evelyn, I need your help. Do you remember that special patient you turned down before? He hasn't stopped hounding me since last night. He keeps insisting that only you can do that surgery. Could you at least check into it?"

Verena froze for a moment. To carry out surgery...

Verena remembered the day Shawna had been stretched out on the operating table, and just as she lifted the scalpel, Shawna passed away.

From that day forward, each time she tried to hold a scalpel, her right hand began to shake uncontrollably.

Nearly a month had passed since Shawna's death, and she had been struggling to step out from under that shadow.Yet every time she picked up a scalpel, her hand trembled without her control, a fatal weakness for any surgeon.

Verena let out a quiet sigh and answered, "It isn't that I'm unwilling. The truth is, I simply can't hold a scalpel right now.I need time to get past this, and I already have a special patient waiting for me."

After pausing to think, Verena added, "Just refuse him outright. If he pesters you again, give him my contact info and tell him to talk to me himself."

With no alternative, Julianna passed along her words exactly as they were.

Upon reading the reply, Cayden was overwhelmed with frustration and a sense of helplessness.

His connection with Julianna was the only reason he had been able to reach Evelyn. Since Evelyn had rejected him so firmly, how could he possibly keep begging?

Still, adding Evelyn to his contact list seemed like a smart move, and perhaps it might open a door later.

Yet after sending the friend request..

An hour slipped by. Another two hours went by.

Then three hours dragged on.

By ten hours, there was still nothing.

···

Time moved swiftly, and soon the day of Isaac'streatment arrived.

On the evening before the treatment day, Verena saw a message from Isaac pop up on her phone. "I'll be sending a driver for you in the morning."

Verena answered, "Alright."

After pausing for a moment, she added, "Don't be nervous. Stay calm. It's just an early-stage treatment."

Isaac sat in his study, his gaze drifting blankly toward a tree outside the window.

When he saw Verena's message, he laid his hand on his lifeless legs, lowering his eyes as his thoughts sank.

At dawn the following morning, Kaia returned from her run to see a glossy black luxury car waiting at the villa gates.

Kaia's beauty often made her stand out in Shoildon's circle of wealthy ladies. Before she even came of age,wealthy young men had already chased after her, and once the ceremony ended, even more suitors appeared.

The moment her eyes landed on a luxury car in front of her home, she assumed another admirer had come calling.

Kaia couldn't tell a thing about engines or brands, but the car's shine was striking enough to catch her attention.

With a bright smile, she brushed her hair into place, hurried across the drive, and knocked against the glass.

The driver rolled the window down, and Kaia folded her arms, acting like she was annoyed. "Would you mind not parking outside my place? I've said it before-I already have feelings for someone.Please let your boss know he should stop trying to reach out."

While acting indifferent, she stretched her neck for a quick glance inside, but the back seat was empty.

Unmoved by her assumption, the driver answered without emotion, "I'm here to pick up Miss Verena Willis."

Her grin vanished at once. "What did you just say?"

Using the exact same tone, the driver repeated, "I said I'm here for Miss Verena Willis."

Her chest swelled so tightly it felt as though it might burst wide open.

Her hands slipped to her sides, and she pulled on a strained smile. "Fine.I'll bring her out."


 ###Chapter 22 Spare Me The Act


At the dining table, Laura slowly swirled her spoon through her coffee.

When Kaia stepped inside, Laura's face brightened. "You're home. Sit down and eat something with me."

Hiding her irritation, Kaia moved closer and spoke quickly. "Mom, I spotted a car out front when I got back.At first, I figured it was Wayne Happer trying to drag me to lunch again. But when I asked, it turns out the driver was here for Verena."

"Verena?" Laura's brows knitted together. "She barely set foot in Shoildon. Who would even know her?"

After a pause, her frown deepened. "Probably some worthless acquaintances."

Kaia noticed the dismissive tone, bit her lip, and then let out a sudden smile. "I thought the same thing. Still,it doesn't sit right with me."

Her voice grew sharper, and her brow tightened. "If it's just casual friends, then fine. But what if she ends up tangled with the wrong kind of men? Don't forget, she's Isaac's future wife. One wrong rumor could wreck her standing. Think of how people will talk about the Willis daughters if this gets out."

At those words, Laura slammed her cup onto the table, splashing hot coffee across the surface.

Her voice turned cold as she snapped, "If she dares to fool around and ruin the alliance between the Willis family and the Bennetts, I'll see to it she pays dearly for it!"

Kaia hid the smirk tugging at her lips and placed a gentle hand on Laura's wrist. "Mom, I'm only speculating.Maybe Verena isn't that type of girl."

Laura narrowed her eyes, clearly certain that Verena was the type of woman she had suspected.

Upstairs on the third floor, Verena gathered her things, grabbed the medical kit, and stepped out of her room.

As she came down, she caught sight of Laura and Kaia sharing breakfast together, a picture that almost seemed warm and ordinary.

Her eyes rested on them for only a moment before she quickly turned away.

"Hold it right there," Laura barked, freezing Verena just as she reached the door.

Verena stopped in her tracks without glancing back. "What is it you want from me?"

A dark scowl spread across Laura's face. "Running out this early-who exactly are you sneaking off to meet?"


For a brief moment, Verena looked taken aback, but she quickly turned around, her eyes landing on Laura before drifting toward Kaia.

Kaia tried to meet Verena's stare with ease, yet the weight of that unwavering gaze broke her composure.Her throat tightened as she looked away in discomfort.

A sharp laugh slipped from Verena as her eyes returned to Laura. "If you're going to accuse me,at least make the lie believable. Having a voice doesn't give you the right to spit out garbage."

The table rattled as Laura struck it, rising to her feet and jabbing a finger at Verena. "This is the respect you show me when I'm trying to guide you?"

"Guide me? What authority do you think you even have?" Verena retorted.

Laura's rage only deepened when Verena dismissed her so openly in front of Kaia.

"I'm your mother. That alone gives me every right to discipline you," Laura snapped.

To Verena, the claim was nothing but a joke, and she laughed outright, the sound edged with scorn.

"Oh, so you do remember that I'm your child too. For a while, it felt like you were only a mother to Kaia and Luka. When it comes to me, nothing I say ever matters, but the moment they speak, you take every word as the truth."

With that, Verena turned a sly smile on Kaia. "Save your plotting. The car outside belongs to Isaac, not some 'wrong kind of men'. You're too young to be tossing around filthy ideas-try keeping your thoughts, and your She was teasing Kaia deliberately, repeating the same things she had told Laura. Just before coming downstairs, she had happened to overhear part of their conversation.

The blunt strike drained the color from Kaia's face. She clung desperately to her image of obedience before Laura, holding back any retort, and let tears spill instead.

Verena cut her off before the tears could even fall. "Spare me the act. I'm the one being slandered here, and I'm not weeping. You're the one making things up-so why are you crying? Do you really feel wronged, or do you just think I don't have the right to call you out? Pathetic."

With a short, dismissive laugh, Verena turned away, walking off without giving either of them another second of her time.

The sting of Verena's words left Kaia speechless on the outside, but her chest burned with fury.

Laura, on the other hand, felt an uneasiness she couldn't shake. She knew she played favorites, yet even with that awareness, she couldn't stop herself. And now, Verena's defiance stirred not just guilt but also an echo of resentment, perhaps because it reminded her too much of Shawna, her late mother-in-law.

"Mom..." Kaia noticed the flicker of guilt in Laura's expression, and dread took hold-what if that guilt made Laura soften toward Verena and give her more attention?

What Kaia couldn't see was that Laura had already sensed her fear and understood her intention,yet even so, Laura's instinct remained the same: to stand firmly on Kaia's side.

...

Medical kit in hand, Verena stepped into the car, and before long, the ride brought her to the location Isaac had sent.

When the car stopped, the driver addressed her with quiet respect. "Miss Willis, Mr. Bennett is already inside the hospital waiting for you."

Her gaze lingered on the private hospital towering before her, and for a moment she stayed silent. She had messaged Isaac before, telling him that they would begin with a traditional approach before surgery.For the traditional treatment, they didn't need the equipment of a hospital, so why would he choose to meet her at a hospital today?

Setting her questions aside, Verena walked straight toward the top floor, making her way to the VIP ward where Isaac was waiting.

In the end, Isaac chose to place his trust in Verena.

Since Evelyn couldn't be found, Cayden grew uneasy about leaving Isaac in the hands of someone who appeared untrained in medicine, so he came along to watch closely.

Although he offered to help Verena, he had already decided in his mind that he would take over the operation if necessary.

Inside the ward, the two men sat in silence until a knock sounded against the door.

"Come in," Isaac called out.

Cayden's eyes stayed locked on the door as it swung open.

Through the doorway stepped a young woman in a simple V-neck sweater and faded jeans. Her frame was slender but carried a quiet elegance, and her face was striking enough to draw every eye. With no makeup at all, her natural beauty shone, most of all in the clarity of her gaze.

For a heartbeat, Cayden was caught off guard by herpresence, and only when she greeted them did his attention drop to the medical kit in her hand.

His surprise slipped out in his voice. "You're Verena Willis?"

In response, Verena gave a courteous nod, her gaze shifting briefly from Cayden to Isaac.

The sight left Cayden astonished. Who had ever claimed she was plain? Anyone making that claim had clearly never stood in the same room with her.

Still, this was no time to focus on appearances. Isaac's condition came first, and the presence of a traditional medicine kit only deepened Cayden's doubts. Isaac shared in the confusion, his brow furrowing. "Wasn't today meant to be the surgery?"

Verena glanced at Cayden briefly before addressing Isaac directly. "I recommended we start with traditional methods first and hold off on surgery until the timing is right," she said calmly. "Doesn't that sound wiser? If you'd like, I can show you our chat history."

###Chapter 23 Isaac Is My Fiancé


Verena realized at last why the hospital had been chosen for the first day of the treatment-it was because Isaac had assumed the surgery would happen immediately.

Checking their old messages, Isaac scrolled through his phone and discovered the mistake. In his eagerness, he had latched onto the word "surgery" and paid no attention to her earlier explanation.

"I was careless," Isaac admitted, lowering his voice. "I misunderstood."

Cayden exhaled in quiet relief at hearing there would be no surgery just yet, though the worry in his eyes never faded. Turning to Verena, he pressed his doubts.

"Miss Willis, as far as I know, your experience with traditional medicine only comes from the small clinic at your hometown. Do you truly believe you can handle Isaac's condition? This isn't something trivial."

Even though she intended to begin with traditional methods, which were more conservative, Cayden's distrust was obvious.

Verena knew Cayden didn't trust her, and she understood why-trust was never given freely to a stranger.

She kept her composure and answered evenly, "You don't need to worry. I would never risk misleading someone from the Bennett family. I wouldn't make promises unless I was certain of them."

Cayden, trained in modern medicine, had only a shallow knowledge of traditional practices. If Verena was determined to rely on them, there was little room for him to object.

Sensing both men's unease, Verena shifted her gaze toward Isaac and allowed a small smile. "Isaac is my fiancé.If I would harm anyone, it certainly wouldn't be him."

Her words landed harder than either expected.

Isaac's head lifted at once, his throat working as he swallowed. The word "fiancé" had rolled from her tongue without any deliberate sweetness, spoken so naturally it almost startled him. He had always thought of their arrangement as nothing more than a transaction. But now, hearing it so simply from her lips, the title carried a warmth he hadn't anticipated.

Isaac finally looked away from Verena and addressed Cayden, saying, "I know you're worried about me,Cayden, but I've decided to place my trust in Miss WVillis."

Positioned between the two, Cayden glanced from lsaac on one side to Verena on the other. They were bound to marry sooner or later, and as someone outside their alliance, it wasn't wise for him to interfere too much. More importantly, as long as no hasty surgery was involved, he had no reason to push back.

After a brief silence, Cayden cleared his throat. "If you've chosen to trust her, then as your friend, I'll stand with you."

At that, Verena opened her medical kit and looked at Isaac. "Shall we begin the treatment?"

His hands clenched around the wheelchair's armrests, but he gave a firm nod. "Go ahead."

Verena's lips curved in a soft smile as she crouched in front of him. She pulled back the blanket covering his legs, reached into her kit, and retrieved a pair of scissors.

Before Isaac fully grasped her intent, the scissors cut through the fabric, and she slid the pant leg up to his thigh in one swift motion.

Caught off guard, Isaac stiffened at the sudden exposure.Heat crept into his chest, but he forced himself to look away, reminding himself this was simply part of the treatment.

Verena didn't miss his unease. In fact, she noticed something else-despite six months of inactivity, his legs still held strong lines of muscle, the kind that came from years of dedicated training. It hadn't been long since the injury, and traces of his old athleticism remained.

With a small laugh, she said lightly, "You know, your legs are actually quite impressive."

The comment startled Isaac. Impressive? His head turned sharply toward her, searching her expression for mockery. But there was no trace of it-only a steady, admiring gaze, as if she were looking at something genuinely remarkable. 
When his eyes met hers, Isaac felt his heartbeat falter for a moment.

He tried to mask the rush in his chest with humor. "Tell me, is 'impressive' really the kind of word you use for a man's legs?"

Her lips curved in amusement. "Then maybe I should say they're beautiful instead," she teased, playing along.

The odd stirring returned to him, a flutter that unsettled his composure.

Sensing it was time to pull back, Verena let the banter end there.

She lowered her hands onto his legs, pressing gently several times before rising to her feet. She said to Cayden, "Could you move him onto the bed?"

"Of course," Cayden replied without hesitation.

He assisted Isaac onto the bed, while Verena took a seat beside the bed, set her kit on her lap, and carefully chose a silver needle.

Cayden folded his arms across his chest, watching in silence.

Between her fingers, the slender needle gleamed. She positioned it with practiced precision, and then pressed the tip against a point on Isaac's leg and drove it in smoothly.

One of Cayden's brows lifted; her technique looked nearly identical to that of seasoned traditional doctors he had seen before.

Flat on his back, Isaac fixed his gaze on the ceiling, his expression unreadable.

As her hand pressed on a pressure point, Verena asked quietly, "Do you feel anything?"

Isaac gave a slight shake of his head. "Nothing."

Without hesitation, she drew another needle and set it into a different spot.

"And this one? Any feeling?" she asked again. His eyelids lowered as he answered softly,-"No."

Another needle went in, followed by her steady question. "What about now?"

Isaac kept his lips pressed tight, wanting to respond but unable. His lifeless legs seemed to mock him,reminding him of how far beyond saving he might already be.

Isaac stayed silent, his fists tightening hard against his sides instead of answering Verena's question.

When he only shook his head, she could see the shadow of disappointment settling over him.

Her hand came down softly on his clenched fist as she spoke in a steady voice. "I'm only asking so I can understand the extent of the nerve damage. The fact that you can't feel anything right now doesn't mean it's hopeless. Your case is unusual, but there's no need to be afraid. We can work through it step by step."

Isaac's eyes lowered to the delicate hand resting on his own. Warmth seeped through his skin, traveling upward until it reached his chest and lodged in his heart.

Those words seemed to wrap around him like a balm, making his throat tighten as he murmured, "Thank you."

Verena answered with a small smile, "You've thanked me enough already. You don't have to be so polite."

Then she returned to her task, sliding more needles into place as part of the treatment.

After every insertion, she checked for his response, repeating the question with care.

Even though his answers never changed, he found himself calmer, more willing to face the truth of his condition.

About half an hour later, she began removing the needles. "This process takes time," she explained. "You'll need two or three sessions each week. I've already written a prescription. Your assistant can buy the herbs from a shop that specializes in traditional medicine. I'll message you updates as your recovery progresses."

From the side, Cayden had observed every step. The confidence in her technique and her composed manner forced him to admit he might have misjudged her abilities.Still, something about her unsettled him. Her voice carried a note that tugged at his memory, stirring an odd sense of familiarity.

As Verena packed away the last of the needles and finished her instructions, Cayden finally spoke up. "Miss Willis, have we met before?"

###Chapter 24 I'll Be The One To End It


Verena studied Cayden for a moment, curiosity flickering in her eyes. After a brief pause, she confirmed her answer. "No, we've never met."

Cayden's brow tightened with a faint crease. The sound of her voice stirred something in him, but he struggled to recall where he had heard it before.

Once she denied the connection, he didn't press further. Instead, he gave a short nod and stepped forward to help Isaac back into his wheelchair.

"You seem fine enough," Cayden remarked. "But I just received an urgent call from the hospital, so I'll need to leave."

Isaac nodded and said, "Go on."

As Cayden walked out, silence settled over the room, leaving only Isaac and Verena behind.

The quiet broke when Isaac's phone buzzed loudly on the table.

Glancing at the screen, he picked it up. "Mom? What is it?"

On the other end, Danica's voice came firm and clear. "I have news for you. The wedding with Verena has been scheduled for next month."

Isaac's expression tightened, his dislike for her domineering tone written plainly on his face.

Not giving him a chance toreply, Danica pressed forward. "You should remind yourself of the bigger picture.I'm well aware you don't care for Verena, but the Bennett family cannot afford your resistance. Remember your position-you're a Bennett.That means sacrifices. Even if it feels unfair, you'll endure it for the family's sake."

Her words slammed shut any room for argument.

Isaac swallowed hard, answering in a low voice, "I understand."

He was not the kind of man who accepted destiny without a fight, nor did he ever follow his mother's commands without thought.

His marriage with Verena was nothing more than a name on paper, and before he met her, he had every intention of rejecting the Willis family's daughter. However, once he finally laid eyes on her, he felt an instinctive urge not to resist. What drew him in was not her appearance, but a feeling he found impossible to define.

With a slight turn of his head, Isaac quietly observed Verena as she gathered the medical kit.

When she noticed his eyes on her, Verena's lips curved into a calm smile. "I heard your mother just now. She thinks you don't care for me, but insists you should keep the family's interests above your own."

Raising the kit into her arms, she gave him an easy smile. "Do you feel marrying me is unfair to you?"

Her hand landed lightly on his shoulder. "Relax. You don't have to like me, and I won't force anything on you.If you truly feel trapped by this arrangement, I'll be the one to end it when the moment arrives."

The ease in her tone made it seem as though the matter didn't bother her in the least, which was only natural given how little they knew each other.

But Isaac's chest tightened unexpectedly, as if her words had struck somewhere tender.

"I.." He tried to speak, but his throat closed around the words, leaving only silence behind.

Isaac thought about telling her that he didn't feel any dislike toward her. Yet saying that aloud would suggest there was some affection between them, and that was unthinkable considering how little time they had spent together. What mattered more was the reality that he was in no state to give his heart to anyone.A man bound by crippled legs and plagued by other failings-how could he possibly have anything to give in love? Romantic feelings were never meant for him.

Verena picked up on the sudden gloom in his expression, and it brought back a memory-how he used to follow her around with unwavering determination. She'd get fed up sometimes and tell him to leave her alone for good. What was it he used to say in return? Ah, yes. "In this life, it's only you. Once we're married,you'll see me every day. There won't be any staying away."That bold promise lingered for a moment in her thoughts before fading away like a passing dream.

Watching him sit with his head lowered, she found his quiet despair almost too heavy to endure.

Walking closer, she bent over and ran her fingers playfully through his hair. "I'm only teasing. I'm not upset.Besides, feelings can grow, can't they? We've got time to understand each other and see where things lead."

Her head tilted slightly, her smile gentle, as if she were comforting a child.

Isaac's lashes trembled while his gaze lingered blankly on the woman in front of him.

The purity in her eyes and the softness of her smile stirred a faint familiarity, though he couldn't place when or where he'd seen something like it before.

Heat from her palm grazed his hair, leaving a tingling trail that rippled through him.

A lump rose in his throat, and he wonderedif he imagined it. Her touch felt effortless, almost too familiar,as if closeness came naturally to her.

The thought, however, was pushed aside at once. In his condition, who would willingly draw near? More likely, she only valued the title that came with being tied to the Bennett family.

Part of him wanted to protest-that not every kind of love could be forced to grow.

But when he looked into her eyes, whatever argument he had formed slipped away before he could speak.His hand curled slightly against his leg, and with his eyes lowered, he gave a slow, instinctive nod. "I get it.You're not wrong."

Hearing his reply, Verena straightened up and spoke with calm sincerity. "Let's stop here for today. If anything feels off after you get home, please promise me you'll let me know immediately."

The concern in her voice left him pressing his lips together before he answered in a low tone, "Alright. I will."

Her eyes lingered on his unruly hair. His unexpected compliance drew a small smile from her. "Good boy."

Her hand brushed through his hair once more, a playful gesture like a reward, before she gathered her kit and walked out.

Left alone in his chair, Isaac's eyes drifted to the empty doorway. His hair stuck up awkwardly in the middle,leaving him looking a little ridiculous.

Inside the Willis Villa, Alec and Laura lounged on the sofa with the financial news playing, while Kaia busied herself at the counter preparing coffee for them.

Verena had just turned toward the stairs when Laura called out to her, "You're back already?"

With only a brief look in Laura's direction, Verena kept her tone flat. "I'm heading upstairs to rest."

As Verena turned to walk away, Laura chimed in, "The wedding date with the Bennett family has been settled. You and Isaac need to choose a day soon to have your pre-wedding photos taken."

"I'm aware," Verena replied curtly.

A reminder wasn't necessary; Verena would not have forgotten.

Laura's unease grew at Verena's constant detachment. What if this stubborn girl stirred up problems that jeopardized the Willis projects the Bennetts had backed after the marriage?

Holding back the unease twisting in her chest, Laura softened her voice and said, "Verena, are you still upset with me? I only said those things because I didn't want to see you misled. That's the reason I spoke so harshly. You have to believe that everything I do comes from a place of care."

She did feel a flicker of guilt for the accusation she'd thrown at Verena that morning, but compared to what was at stake, that guilt barely registered.

Verena, however, couldn't stop the quiet scorn rising in her mind. Laura had shown no hesitation when it came to pointing fingers. And now that sherealized she was in the wrong, she conveniently wrapped her actions in the excuse of concern. Hiding behind the words"everything I do comes from a place of care"didn't make her accusation any less calculated.

###Chapter 25 Their Love Had To Remain Hers


Verena looked at Laura and gave a quiet laugh. "I don't waste anger on just anyone. Only the people who matter get that side of me. So relax. Why would I be upset with you?"

The way she spoke made it sound like Laura's presence was of little importance.

Across from her, Laura's eyes fixed on her daughter, and her expression stiffened beneath layers of carefully applied makeup. All morning she had wrestled with guilt over how she had wrongly accused Verena,and waiting here was her way of making amends. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with dismissal. Was Verena really suggesting she didn't matter? She was still her mother. But then, considering Shawna had been the one to raise Verena, it wasn't surprising. To Laura, the girl standing before her was nothing but a thankless child who threw her kindness away.

Kaia had been quiet until now, but after hearing Verena's cutting remark, she rose and slipped an arm around Laura's shoulders.

"How could you talk like that, Verena?" Kaia asked, frowning at her. "Mom's already trying to make things right with you. Don't you think it's disrespectful to speak to her this way?"

Her words weren't meant for comfort. They were meant to make Alec see Verena as insolent enough to deserve punishment.

Verena met Kaia's gaze with a cold stare. "Politeness depends on who I'm dealing with. And with the two of you, there's no need for it."

Her glance shifted to Alec, who opened his mouth as if to say something but held back. Without another word,she turned and walked upstairs.

For a moment Kaia stood frozen, unable to form a reply. When her thoughts finally caught up, anger took hold of her. She hated herself for always losing ground in arguments and never being sharp enough to outtalk Verena. Growing up the way she did had made Verena quick with insults, but that was all she had. On second thought, Kaia felt a flicker of relief, realizing her sister's only skill was a sharp tongue and nothing more.

Breathing hard from frustration, Laura pressed her hand against her chest. She looked over at Alec, who sat unmoving on the sofa. "Can you believe this? Just look at what's become of her! How could she claim I'm not worth basic respect? I am still her mother!"

While Laura raged, Alec's eyes stayed fixed on the floor. Regret flled him far more than anger whenever he thought ofVerena.

Long ago, he had planned to bring Shawna and Verena to Shoildon, but Laura's constant objections always got in the way. It was only after Shawna pasśed away that Verena finally came to live in his home.

Those lost years left a distance between them, and Alec had tried to bridge it as a father. Still, the gap was too wide. He and Verena had spent so long apart that it felt impossible to truly reach her now. When he heard Verena speak so coldly to Laura, he couldn't find it in himself to blame her. He only blamed himself for falling short as a father.

Interrupting his thoughts, Laura's sharp voice demanded attention. "Why won't you say anything? Look at the kind of person she's become under your mother's guidance!"

Alec drew a slow breath and met Laura's gaze. His words came out steady. "You keep saying you're her mother, but was there ever a moment you actually tried to teach her the right way?"

A hintof offense crossed Laura's face. "What are you suggesting? Do you really not remember who stood beside you back when you had nothing? I had no time to teach our eldest daughter properly because I had given you my full support back then. Are you seriously blaming me for this now?"

Hoping to avoid an argument, Alec softened his voice. "She just came to the city, so it makes sense she's unfamiliar with how things work here. As her mother, you're supposed to lead her forward, not just criticize her. You keep saying she's rude and unrefined, but let's not forget, we left her to live wih my mother for more than twenty years. If Verena had grown up with us, she would have been a different person."

Kaia almost opened her mouth to tell Alec about Verena's rudeness and the way she had shoved Luka down the stairs. But when she noticed the heavy guilt in Alec's eyes, she forced herself to keep quiet.

Her gaze flicked between Alec's troubled face and Laura's contemplative look, and a bitter sense of grievance welled up inside her. Why did Verena's return seem to steal all of their attention?

That grievance soon turned into unease. If her parents kept focusing on Verena, would their love eventually belong only to her?

The thought unsettled her even more when she remembered that Verena was set to marry Isaac, which would surely bring her even greater favor at home.

Grinding her teeth, Kaia made up her mind. She would never allow that to happen. Their love had to remain hers, and their focus should never wander to anyone else.

"Dad, Mom, don't let Verena's issues take over your thoughts anymore," Kaia steadied Laura on the sofa and gave a bright smile. "I actually have some good news to share with you."

As Laura quietly questioned whether she had been too harsh with Verena, Kaia's cheerful voice suddenly drew her attention back.

"What kind of good news?" she asked.

Alec was curious too, so he turned his eyes toward Kaia.

Now that both of them were paying attention, Kaia's smile grew warmer. "Not long ago, when I was eating out with a friend, I happened to meet one of my professors."

Then, with a touch of pride, she added, "You remember-the one who's always been especially fond of me."

As always, Laura remembered every detail about Kaia.

She leaned closer with a smile and asked, "You're talking about Professor Wendell Branson, aren't you?"

Kaia nodded eagerly. "I stopped to greet him, and he ended up sharing something with me."

She let the pause linger on purpose, letting their anticipation build, and then went on with a bright smile."This year, our medical school is bringing in Dr. Evelyn Rowe, the world-famous physician, to give a lecture. Since Professor Branson knows how much I admire Evelyn, he saved me a place right away, worried I might miss the chance."

Laura's eyes widened in surprise. "Is that true? Didn't you once tell me Evelyn rarely makes public appearances? If your school managed to invite Evelyn, they must have gone to great lengths.And your professor holding a seat for you clearly shows how highly he thinks of you."

She wrapped her arms around Kaia and praised her warmly. "Kaia, you really are remarkable."

Enjoying every bit of her mother's affection, Kaia smiled with deep satisfaction.

Alec was pleased that his younger daughter had earned her professor's favor. And the name Evelyn stirred his curiosity.

Life is inseparable from illness, aging, and death, and regardless of how much power or wealth a person possessed, the opportunity to build ties with a doctor of Evelyn's reputation was far too valuable to overlook.

Although Alec had heard of Evelyn before, he realized he knew almost nothing about the doctor beyond the name.
###Chapter 26 | Want To Meet Verena

Alec leaned forward slightly and asked, "What kind of achievements has Evelyn made in medicine?"



Kaia's eyes lit up at her father's interest, and she answered with enthusiasm, "Evelyn's incredible, Dad!A few years back, in Clokron, they led a groundbreaking heart transplant that shook the entire medical community. That operation alone made Evelyn famous, and since then, many of Evelyn's successful high-risk operations have been written into medical textbooks. Every medical student looks up to that legendary doctor."



The mention of Evelyn made Alec thoughtful.Years of dealing with society's elite had taught him how much they valued their health. Forming a connection with someone like Evelyn could open doors in ways money and power couldn't.



With that thought in mind, Alec rested a hand on Kaia's shoulder and instructed, "When the lecture is over, make sure you get Evelyn's contact information.Don't let a chance like this pass you by."



Even without his reminder, Kaia had already resolved to do just that. To her, Evelyn wasn't only a famous doctor-they were her greatest inspiration.


She gave a cheerful nod and said with a smile, "You don't need to worry, Dad. I'll definitely take the opportunity."



...



Shock ran through Bobby when he learned Isaac and Verena's wedding date had already been set. He had assumed there was still time to derail what he considered a mismatched marriage, but his mother and the Willis family had moved faster than expected.



If he didn't act quickly, Verena, the girl he believed to be deceptive, would officially become part of the Bennett family. He was determined to see her in person and decide for himself what sort of woman she truly was. In his mind, she couldn't possibly be beyond his ability to control.


Acting on imnpulse, Bobby hurried into his room,grabbed his phone, and dialed Kaia's number. Though he had never thought much of her, she was his only link to Verena in this urgent moment.


The call connected not long after.


It struck Bobby that they hadn't spoken once since the last birthday party. When Bobby's call lit up Kaia's phone, the memory of being left hanging at her birthday party rushed back,souring her mood. Still, his decision to reach out stirred a faint hope that he might finally be giving her some thought.



Kaia's voice was soft as she asked, "Mr.Bennett,what can I do for you?"



Instead of polite chatter, Bobby got straight to the point. "I want to meet Verena."



The words hit Kaia like a shock. Her face stiffened,and after a stunned pause, she stammered, "Wha... what did you just say?"



The idea sounded so unbelievable that she questioned whether she had heard him correctly.


Bobby repeated himself without hesitation, "Let Verena know | expect to see her tomorrow. If not,just pass along my number."



Kaia struggled to understand what she had just heard.What reason could Bobby possibly have for wanting to meet Verena? No matter what drew people near her or what their intentions were, they always seemed to be asking about Verena in the end. It had happened with Cayden before, and now it was happening again with Bobby. Forcing herself to keep calm, she asked in a tentative tone, "Why exactly do you want to meet Verena, Mr.Bennett?"



His brows drew together in irritation. "I don't owe you an explanation. Just give her the message."


Kaia's mind raced. The last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena, especially since she had once sent a message in the group chat, hinting that Verena wasn't attractive, and everyone had believed her. If he saw Verena in person, that lie would unravel instantly


"That's a shame," said Kaia flatly, spinning the lie without a hint of emotion. "Verena hasn't been around much lately, and even I barely run into her. She keeps to herself most of the time. Our family hardly speaks with her, so I doubt she'd be open to someone she doesn't know. I don't have any way to reach her,either."



The way Kaia spoke made Verena seem cold and full of herself.



Doubt crept into Bobby's mind as he listened to KCaia.He figured Verena might be distant, but it seemed unlikely that Kaia didn't have a chance to speak with her sister at all.



Rather than press the issue, Bobby picked up on Kaia's unwillingness to help and decided not to question her motives any further.


Bobby's voice was flat. "Alright, if you're not interested in helping, I'll just handle it on my own."



That was all he said before he ended the call.



The moment she heard his words, Kaia felt panic rising in her chest. Someone like Bobby, with his influence,wouldn't struggle for long if he set his mind on finding Verena. The chance of them meeting seemed impossible to avoid. If Bobby ever saw Verena and thought she was beautiful, he might stop objecting to the marriage with Isaac altogether.



As these thoughts spun in her head,Kaia's anxiety only grew. Even though her feelings for lsaac had faded after his accident, she hated the idea of Verena ending up with the man she once wanted but could never have. The thought alone was unbearable, and she simply couldn't allow it to happen.



Worry twisted Kaia's expression as she gnawed at her lip and tried to come up with a way to keep Bobby and Verena apart.



Suddenly, Kaia's eyes landed on the steaming bowl of soup a maid had just brought to the bedside table, and an idea sparked in her mind.



Since Bobby had never met Verena, he wouldn't recognize her. If something happened to ruin Verena's appearance before their meeting,Bobby would surely turn away in disgust and refuse to accept her as a future sister-in-law.



The image of a scarred Verena flashed through Kaia's mind, and she burst out laughing at the thought



The following morning arrived.



Verena finished washing up and headed downstairs,making her way to the dining room for breakfast.


Kaia had already been lingering in the kitchen for more than thirty minutes, waiting for just the right moment. She scooped up a bowl of steaming soup with extra care when she heard footsteps approaching.


After Verena took her seat at the table, Kaia moved slowly toward her, balancing the bowl.



Verena took a small bite of the bread the maid had handed her and noticed a flash of pink in her peripheral vision. That shade of pajama belonged to Kaia alone, making it clear who had been lingering in the kitchen the entire time. She wondered what ridiculous scheme Kaia might be brewing now.



One eyebrow lifted, Verena kept a close watch on Kaia without turning her head.



Without warning, Kaia tripped and came stumbling in Verena's direction. In a split second, Verena set her bread aside and sprang out of her chair to avoid the collision.



Her quick move made the chair scrape loudly against the floor.



Kaia was so startled by the sudden noise that she backed away, completely forgetting the bowl she was holding.



Hot soup sloshed over the rim, burning her hand and making her cry out as she dropped the bowl. Some of it even splashed up onto her neck.



Tears filled Kaia's eyes while she clutched her burned hand,blaming Verena for startling her on purpose.



She gave Verena an angry glare, clearly about to start yelling.


Before she could speak, Verena interjected coldly,"Not a great feeling, is it, Kaia? Burns pretty badly when your own scheme turns against you."
###Chapter 27 Surveillance Footage
Tears welled up in Kaia's eyes as the pain hit her, and her gaze grew red wen Verena called her out so bluntly. She pressed herlips together, determined not to admit a thing. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Honestly, I don't get it."


Verena looked at Kaia's face, taking note of the features they had in common. This was her sister,after all.


Still, Verena couldn't ignore the fact that Kaia wanted her disfigured.



Before coming to Shoildon, Verena had assumed that her sister, whom she had only met once, likely didn't think much of her. She never imagined that Kaia would actually hate her this deeply.



Trying to keep her feelings in check, Verena kept her tone cold and held Kaia's gaze. "Kaia, you don't like me, and I don't like you. We're both well aware of it.I haven't gone after you, so don't think you can start with me. As long as you behave yourself, I'll let you do whatever you want. I'm not interested in fighting for anything you want. But if you ever try something
against me again, I promise I'll make you pay dearly."



Kaia found it impossible to tolerate the way Verena looked down on her. She had grown up beside their parents,spoiled by them,while Verena had lived out in the countryside, so why did Verena always act so high and mighty?



By now, Alec and Laura were both at work, and Luka was out somewhere with friends. With nobody around to back her up, Kaia felt completely alone.



Holding her hand over her scalded neck, Kaia glared at Verena and warned,"Do you really think I won't tell Mom and Dad that you're bullying me? That you spilled hot soup on purpose just to hurt me?"



With her patience gone, Kaia didn't bother to act like the good sister anymore.



Verena faced Kaia's empty threat with a faint smile. "If you have time to complain, you should hurry up and go to the hospital. If you're slow, you might actually end up with scars."



There was a challenge in the way she spoke her final words.



Kaia,who cared more about her looks than anything else, lost all color in her face the second she heard the word "scars."
Several drops of hot soup had splashed onto her face as well.



She shot Verena a furious glare and gritted her teeth."You're evil. You really are the worst."


Anger boiled inside her, but Kaia forced herself to focus on getting to the hospital first.


She gave quick directions to the driver, and soon she was on her way tothe hospital.



After doctors reassured her that her face would be fine, Kaia stretched out on a plush VIP bed, snapped a picture of herself, and posted it online with a simple caption: "At the hospital."



Within minutes, a few of her so-called friends from her circle of rich acquaintances sent messages to her in the group chat, pretending to be worried. "Kaia,what happened to you? How did you end up like this?"



Kaia let the questions pile up and waited until her phone buzzed with nearly a dozen messages before deciding to answer.



Kaia finally replied, "Don't worry, it's nothing serious.Verena just came to live with our family. We're not really close. I wanted to do something nice and made her some soup, but when I handed her the bowl, she bumped it and the soup ended up all over me."

Because people in the group already looked down on Verena for faking her academic background, not many were willing to defend her.



After reading Kaia's message, one of the group members quickly commented, saying, "You're telling me that was an accident? She definitely meant to do it!"



Someone else jumped in right after. "Of course she did. She's jealous that you're so pretty and probably wants to ruin your face."



Watching the flurry of reactions, Kaia felt pleased with herself, but she kept up her sweet and innocent act."Please don't misunderstand her. Verena can be difficult, but I really don't think she did it on purpose."



To make her message seem even more pitiful, she added a sad-faced emoji at the end.


When Bobby read through the group chat, his eyebrows knitted together in doubt. He wasn't convinced by what Kaia said. After all, these two were sisters, so it seemed unlikely things would get so ugly.Besides,after talking to Kaia a few times, he knew she was good at putting on a show and couldn't be trusted.



Someone else in the group shared his doubts and tagged Kaia. "You can try to explain, but people are still going to question you. Doesn't your house have cameras in the dining room? If you show the recording it'll be clear whether Verena meant to do it or not."



Other people quickly chimed in with agreement."Exactly, just upload the video."



Kaia had already seen this coming. She had spent her ride to the hospital editing the footage so it would look the way she wanted.


Still, she couldn't let herself seem too eager to share it.



She responded in the group, "Okay, I'll go look at the recordings now."



After a few minutes, she picked the video she had already prepared and sent it into the chat.



In the video, a woman with long hair sat at the dining table, her back turned toward the camera. Moments later, another woman appeared, wearing a pink nightgown and holding a bowl of soup. It was clear the one in the pink nightgown was Kaia, and the woman seated with her long hair flowing down could only be Verena.



The footage showed Kaia standing about three feet from the table. As Verena pushed her chair back and rose to her feet, her arm swept out and hit the boWl,sending hot soup splashing across Kaia's arm. With the way the video was shot, it looked like Verena did it on purpose.



Of course, Kaia knew the truth. Verena never made contact with the bowl at all; she had only lifted her hand while getting up.



But Kaia had cut out the key section of the recording



After seeing the video, everyone in the group sent messages to comfort Kaia, believing Verena did it on purpose.



When Bobby finished watching, his frown grew even deeper, and a mix of emotions clouded his face. Kaia was far from innocent, but anyone willing to hurt her own sister was no better.



He had always thought Verena was just a compulsive liar who wanted to outshine everyone else. After he saw this, she struck him as jealous and vindictive. If Isaac really ended up marrying her,the entire Bennett family would be thrown into chaos. He could not let that happen. As long as the marriage hadn't taken place, there was still time to stop it.



Determined, Bobby threw off his covers, got out of bed, and stormed toward Isaac's study.



He didn't pause to knock. Instead,he marched right in and blurted out, "Isaac, I'm serious. You can't marry  someone like Verena. You have no idea how cruel she can be. She almost ruined her sister's face. If you go through with this,our family will never know peace. If you don't believe me, I have the video to prove it..."



"Enough!" Isaac slammed his folder on the desk, and the sharp sound made Bobby jump.



In a cold, steady voice, Isaac replied, "I've told you before, Verena is going to be your sister-in-law.I won't let you talk about her like that."



Isaac folded his hands in front of him and stared Bobby down. "Or do you think now that Dad's gone,what I say doesn't matter anymore?"
###Chapter 28 He's Lucky To Be Marrying Me
Isaac had never spoken to him that way before.Bobby wanted to defend himself, but when he met lsaac's piercing stare, he suddenly felt like a little kid who had missed the point entirely.



His fingers twisted the edge of his shirt, and he dropped his gaze. "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac," he mumbled.



Isaac understood him well enough to know what was really going on. Bobby was not being defiant for the sake of it. He simply could not bring himself to accept Verena as part of their family.



With a quiet but forceful voice,Isaac said, "Look at me."



Reluctantly, Bobby pressed his lips together and looked up to meet Isaac's eyes.



Isaac's face was unreadable. His gaze was intense,and it made Bobby feel small under the weight of it.



He admired Isaac, but whenever lsaac put on that stern look, Bobby always broke into a cold sweat.


Every instinct told Bobby to look away, but he could not muster the nerve. He swallowed hard and waited in tense silence.



After a pause, Isaac's voice cut through the air."You're old enough to know better. It's time you focused on your classes. I expect you to help me with company business when you can. As for everything else, leave it alone. If I catch you speaking badly about Verena again, you'll find out exactly how harsh I can be."



Bobby wanted to protest. He wished he could say he only wanted to protect lsaac, that Verena was dangerous, and Isaac was fooled by that woman.



But with Isaac sitting right there, so intimidating,Bobby could only bite back his words and give a silent nod.



He stepped out of the study, but his frustration bubbled up the more he thought about it. He ran a hand through his hair and let out a long sigh.



That was when voices drifted up from downstairs,as the servants greeted Danica.



A spark of hope lit up in Bobby's eyes. Isaac might have lost his objectivity when it came to Verena, but Danica certainly had not. She had always hated women who acted out of jealousy. If she found out about this, maybe she would be the one to call off the  arrangement.


That idea brought Bobby's spirits back to life,hope flickering in his eyes.


Bobby rushed down the stairs and nearly tripped as he hurried into the living room to find Danica.



She had just come in from outside and was settling onto the sofa, still holding a glass of water. She hadn't even taken a sip before Bobby's sudden entrance startled her, making her cough.


"Are you alright, Mom?" Bobby asked as he moved beside her, gently patting her back.


Danica tried to catch her breath, and then shot hima sideways look. "What on earth has you in such a rush?"



Bobby responded immediately, "Mom,you can't let Verena marry into our family. I thought she just liked to exaggerate, but now I see she's really got a manipulative side. Please, before the wedding, go talk to the Willis family and call off this arrangement.You'd be saving Isaac from a terrible mistake."



He said everything in a single breath, leaving Danica staring at him in disbelief. She blinked a few times before answering, "Have you gone crazy?"



The question caught Bobby off guard. He grabbed her shoulders and spoke with even more urgency. "I'm being serious, Mom!"


Danica said nothing for a moment. She had weighed Isaac's engagement to Verena carefully, thinking it was the best decision for their family.


Seeing Bobby act so impulsively made her lose patience. She brushed his hands away and snapped,"How many times do I have to tell you not to meddle in Isaac's life? Are you even listening when I talk to you? Right now, your job is to work with lsaac and learn how to manage the company, not run around causing trouble. Tell me, when was the last time you even showed up at the office?"



Her scolding stung, and Bobby looked away, refusing to meet her eyes. "I don't care about running the company," he muttered to himself.



Hearing that, Danica's temper snapped. "Then what do you care about? Tell me. What actually interests you?"



With her voice rising, Bobby fell silent. Danica crossed her arms, glaring at him with obvious disappointment."You and Isaac grew up under the same roof, but he turned out responsible and hardworking, and you-well, you're just a headache. Go on, get out of my sight!"


Before she had even finished, Bobby had clenched his fists and stormed from the room. No one ever listened  to him. Would it really hurt them to watch a simple video? All they ever did was yell at him.



...



A black sedan sat parked right at the front gates of the Willis Villa, with the driver standing patiently nearby.



From her seat on the sofa, Laura glanced up and spotted Verena making her way downstairs. "Verena,you need to keep your eyes open during the photoshoot today. I don't want you doing anything that gives people a reason to laugh at us."


Since Verena had spent her childhood far away from city life,Laura constantly worried she might embarrass the family when faced with all the luxury, especially the wedding gowns and sparkling jewelry.


Luka interjected, "You probably don't recognize any of those brands, so it's best if you just watch Mr.Bennett and follow his lead. If he picks a dress, just go along with it. Don't make a scene by choosing the wrong one."



Both Laura and Luka already knew about Kaia's accident and her trip to the hospital. Under normal circumstances, Laura would never have ignored what happened, but today's event was simply too important. Noticing the irritation on Luka's face, Verena gave a calm smile and said, "This is my wedding, and I'm the one at the center of it. I'll wear whichever dress I like.Your opinion has nothing to do with it."


Laura's face tightened. "Don't be ridiculous. Who do you think the wedding is really about? Isaac is the center of attention, not you. If you do something to upset him, he could easily call off the entire wedding."


Before Laura could say anything more, a smooth,deep voice drifted in from the entryway. "Mrs. Willis, it sounds like you don't have mnuch faith in me."



All three of them turned to see who had spoken.


Isaac had just arrived, seated in his wheelchair, with his assistant guiding him through the door.


Laura's demeanor changed instantly. She forced a bright smile and greeted him. "Mr. Bennett, what a surprise. We weren't expecting you today."


Kaia came down the steps just then, and the sight of Isaac made her heart race. His condition didn't take away from his presence or his good looks. Even while sitting in that wheelchair, he looked every bit out of reach.



Verena stood there, caught off guard as she met Isaac's eyes. She only snapped out of her daze when lsaac moved beside her and gently took her right hand in his.


"Today's for the pre-wedding shoot. Verena is my fiancée, so it only makes sense that I came to pick her up," Isaac said, turning his attention to Laura.


His tone was courteous, but the chill in his gaze was unmistakable. There was not a hint of warmth in his eyes, only a depth that was impossible to read.


Laura froze for a split second, surprised by how directly Isaac referred to Verena as his fiancée. It was clear he had no plans to call off the wedding. Her face lit up with a practiced smile. "You're absolutely right.It's a real honor for Verena that you came for her yourself."



Hearing Laura's comment and recalling what he had overheard on his way in, Isaac frowned slightly. Laura seemed to have no problem talking down to her own daughter.



He was about to speak up when Verena beat him to it."I'd say Isaac is lucky to be marrying me, too. There's no need to put your daughter down."


For a brief moment, lsaac looked surprised. Hlis eyebrows arched in amusement.



Laura's smile vanished. Kaia stared at Verena with wide eyes, shocked that she would say something so bold.



In Kaia's mind, the Willis family could never compare to the Bennett family. She wondered how Verena could possibly be so fearless-how could she say that marrying her was lsaac's stroke of luck?
###Chapter 29 Liar



Laura glared at Verena, ready to lash out, but Isaac spoke up first. He nodded and said quietly, "She's right. Honestly, I do feel lucky to be marrying Verena."



Laura could only stare at him, completely thrown off by his response.



Kaia also turned to look at lsaac, unable to hide her shock. There was even a small, amused smile on his face.



Neither Verena nor Isaac lingered at the house. They said their goodbyes and headed out together.


Once inside the car, Verena looked over at Isaac. She was practically glowing, her eyes full of curiosity.


For a while, Isaac pretended to focus on the scenery outside, but eventually, he couldn't ignore her gaze any longer.



He finally turned and asked, "What's with that look?Why are you staring at me?"



That seemed to snap Verena out of it. She blinked and said,"Oh. I just wanted to know if you meant what you said back there." Isaac gave a slight frown. "Which part are you talking about?"



"All of it," she replied, her tone playful.


In reality, he had only spoken a couple of sentences,but the meaning behind them lingered



When Isaac fell quiet, Verena pressed her hands into the seat and leaned a little closer.



They were both sitting in the back, and Isaac's height made him look even more imposing.


As soon as he noticed her moving closer,he instinctively leaned away.



Verena wasn't going to let him get away that easily.She looked up at him, grinning. "Weren't you supposed to send someone to pick me up? What made you decide to come in person?"



He had sent her a message last night saying the driver would be there in the morning.



Verena had assumed it would be just the chauffeur.She hadn't expected him to show up too.



Isaac really meant to let the driver handle it and meet her at the bridal shop. But when the driver was ready to pull away this morning, he changed his mind on a whim and got in, not bothering to think too hard about it.



"| was just passing by and thought we could go to the bridal shop together," he said, pretending it meant nothing.



"Oh," Verena blurted out, dragging the word slowly though her tone made it clear she didn't believe a word of it. The Bennett Mansion and the Willis Villa were nowhere near each other, and only someone completely clueless would buy his excuse. If he had gone out of his way to come for her, could it mean that feelings he didn't remember were starting to rise back to the surface without him even noticing?



That thought made Verena's smile grow a little wider.


She sat up straighter, and then closed her eyes,settling back as if she wanted to rest for the ride.Isaac noticed her quiet confidence and almost asked if she still doubted his motives. For a moment, he wanted to clear things up, but then he thought better of it. Even if she questioned him, he honestly did not know how to explain his own actions.



Their car rolled to a stop not long after.


A thick winter fog drifted over the streets, making the whole morning feel soft andstill.


Isaac waited in his wheelchair while his assistant moved to help, but Verena stepped forward and placed her hands on the chair's handles. "I'll take care of this."



The assistant hesitated, glancing at Isaac for direction.Isaac gave a small nod, so he simply followed behind,watching the two of them.



Inside the bridal shop, a team of staff members stood by the door, ready to greet them.


As soon as Verena pushed Isaac inside, the staff all bowed politely.



Warmth filled the space, and bright lights danced across glass cases, making every wedding dress look even more dazzling.



A young sales assistant stepped forward, her smile directed at Isaac. "Good morning, Mr. Bennett." Then she turned to Verena, her eyes lighting up."And this must be Mrs. Bennett. She's absolutely stunning."


For a second, Isaac hesitated at the name. Mrs.Bennett?



He almost corrected the assistant, wanting to explain they weren't married just yet, but Verena only gave a small, polite smile. "Thank you," she said, her voice gentle.



Isaac glanced over and noticed her smile. It was warm and sincere, and she did not seem at all bothered by being called Mrs. Bennett.



When Isaac didn't reply, the sales assistant quickly added, "Mr. Bennett, would you like to see our wedding dress styles? | can-"


Isaac cut her off, his tone even. "I'm not particular.Your job is to help Mrs. Bennett with anything she needs."



Verena arched her eyebrow in silent amusement.



The sales assistant forced a quick smile, and then nodded."Yes,absolutely."



Verena took her time looking through the racks and picked out several wedding dresses. Meanwhile, the sales assistant chose a few matching suits for lsaac.


In the end, Verena settled on an off-the-shoulder gown with a flowing train. The back was laced with smooth white ribbons that needed to be tied. Right then, the sales assistant left to find a suit for lsaac.



Once she finished changing, Verena pulled the curtain aside.



The soft sound caught Isaac's attention. He glanced up and stopped short, unable to look away.



There stood Verena, her long hair pinned up with care, and the pale dress brought out the soft glow of her skin.



She wore only a touch of makeup, but it gave her cool, elegant features an unmistakable charm.



When Isaac just stared at her in silence, Verena grinned and called out, "Are you so dazzled you forgot how to speak?"



He shook himself from his thoughts and cleared his throat.



Her smile widened.She had always known how shy he could be. "Come help me out," she remarked.



Without thinking too much, Isaac rolled his chair over to her.



When he reached her, Verena turned away, tilted her head back, and said, "I can't tie up the back of this dress. Give me a hand, will you?"



To make it easier, Verena bent her knees and lowered herself a little.



Isaac glanced down and took in the graceful lines of her shoulders. Her back was smooth and delicate,and a tiny black mole on her left shoulder blade caught his eye, making her look even more intriguing-and somehow oddly familiar. For a moment, Isaac froze. Verena noticed and reached back, placing the ribbons directly into his hands.



She teased him gently,Ir. Bennett, are you going to help or not?"



That snapped him out of it.



He started working on the ribbons, but his fingers were awkward and cool as they brushed against her bare skin. The heat from her back sent a shock through him,and he immediately pulled his hand away.


He fumbled for words. "I, um, maybe the sales assistant should do this part."



He backed his wheelchair away, suddenly too nervous to meet her eyes.


Watching him pull away so quickly, Verena suddenly remembered how she once told him to stop shutting her out. He had promised her back then. Yet here he was,doing the same thing all over again.


She straightened and spoke in a quiet voice. "You're such a liar."



Though she barely spoke above a whisper,Isaac still caught what she said. His gaze dropped, fixated on his unmoving legs. He found himself spiraling, thinking about how she'd let him touch her just now. The problem wasn't her, and deep down, he knew it. For someone like him, feeling broken and less than whole, there were certain things he would always feel were out of reach.



Experience had taught him that nothing in life comes for free, and he couldn't fool himself into believing this marriage was about love. Since she never voiced any complaints, there had to be something else she wanted-and that wasn't him.



The sight of Isaac's brooding silence left Verena with a heavy heart. It was easy to see how much pain he was hiding, and she understood it would take time before he'd be himself again. Pushing him for more wouldn't help either of them.



A gentle smile found its way onto her face as she spoke. "I'll just wait for the assistant, then."


Isaac looked over, surprised to find only kindness and understanding in her eyes. There was no hint of annoyance about his refusal, just a warmth that made himn feel oddly forgiven.



With Verena standing there so at ease, lsaac grew restless, unsure whether he was allowed to reach for what he wanted-almost like a child who didn't know if he was allowed a treat. It surprised him how deeply she'd managed to get under his skin, considering how little time they'd known each other.



He couldn't help watching her for a moment longer,and then looked away.


A moment later, Verena broke the silence. "But..."



Isaac's head snapped up at the sound of her voice.



Closing the curtain, Verena caught his eye. Mischief sparkled in her gaze as she spoke with quiet conviction. "You said you wouldn't shut me out. I'll let you off the hook for now, but next time, you better remember your promise."



Before Isaac could think of a reply, she slipped behind the bright white curtain, the fabric falling quietly in her wake.
###Chapter 30 My Fiancé Gets Embarrassed Too Easily
Isaac froze, his ears filling with the sound of his own heartbeat. Something unfamiliar stirred inside him,sharp enough to crease his brow. It wasn't anger-more like a restless curiosity about this feeling he couldn't quite name. Each time he pushed Verena away,his chest only grew heavier, as if his steady logic slipped for a moment.



His fists tightened as he stared at the curtain drawn tightly in front of him. Without fully thinking it through,he wheeled himself forward, an impulse driving him closer.



His hand caught the fabric, and he pulled it aside.



Verena stood just beyond the opening, her back to him as she adjusted the train of her gown.



The gown's ribbons spilled loose down her spine,the silk strands falling in graceful disarray that somehow felt both elegant and chaotic.



Isaac swallowed hard, his throat working as he forced his eyes away. Still, he moved into the fitting room,stopping only when he was behind her.
Slowly,he lifted his hands to gather the ribbons.



The gentle tug made Verena think the shop assistant had returned to help her.


A small smile curved her lips as she said without glancing back, "Thank you. My fiancé gets embarrassed too easily."



Her voice carried a sweetness she didn't even try to hide, the kind that gave her simple words a note of quiet affection.



Isaac's grip on the ribbons grew firmer. It wasn't the words themselves-it was how carefully she chose them. She never pointed out his limitations, never said a thing about his chair. Instead, she had simply excused him as shy.


Isaac blinked, and then answered quietly, "You're welcome."



The sound of his voice made V/erena whip around in surprise. "You?"she asked.



A warm glow filled her face as her eyes brightened and a sincere smile spread across her lips, soft and unguarded.



Isaac blinked, his lashes trembling slightly as the weight of his earlier behavior settled in-it struck him  then just how overly sensitive he had been.


He closed his mouth into a firm line, lifted his eyes to meet Verena's, and said, "I might be feeling a little shy right now, but there are things we'll need to adjust to,since we're going to be married."



Verena hadn't expected Isaac to come to that kind of understanding so suddenly, and the shift in him caught her off guard.



She tilted her head slightly, her eyes glinting with curiosity. "Do you really believe that?"


Isaac paused for only a moment before answering, "I do."



A smile touched Verena's lips as she replied, "Then I'll count on you, my sweet fiancé."


Those last two words were spoken so lightly they might have passed unnoticed, yet they struck something deep inside Isaac. Just hearing her call him that brought him an odd sense of calm.



"You keep drifting off into your own world," Verena teased,her tone carrying a hint of playfulness.



Her words snapped lsaac back. Only then did he realize she had crouched in front of him, patiently waiting for his help. "My apologies," he said quickly, gathering the loose ribbons to tie them.



He moved with as much care as he could manage, but his fingers brushed against her skin as he worked.



"Your hands are freezing," Verena remnarked with a soft laugh.



Isaac froze, worried his cold fingers brought her discomfort. He was about to pull back and suggest letting an assistant handle it, but Verena spoke again,her voice carrying quiet concern. "Do you have trouble sleeping at night?"



Her question caught him off guard.


After a beat, he gave a small nod. "Yes."


The truth was that the accident had scarred him mnore in spirit than in body. Ever since that day, restless nights and endless nightmares had haunted him. He hated the weakness he carried, hated even more that his survival had come at his father's expense. From then on, sleep had felt heavy and hollow,never bringing him any comfort.


Verena noticed the faint crease in his brow and chose not to press further. She could already guess why he lived with insomnia. Isaac tied the final ribbon just as the sales assistant stepped into the room.



She gave lsaac a small bow and apologized, saying,"I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, Mr. Bennett. There was a mix-up with the stock."



Isaac pressed his lips together before he responded in an even tone, "That's alright."



Not long after, both he and Verena changed into their wedding outfits, and the staff led them to the location for the photos.


Roughly thirty minutes later, their car rolled to a stop.As they stepped out, the photographer welcomed them with a broad grin. "Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett."


Verena sized him up. He was young, with a slight belly,and when he smiled, his eyes curved into cheerful slits,giving him a clumsy but likable appearance.



She returned the smile and nodded politely."We'll be counting on you today."



The process of taking pre-wedding photos turned out to be detailed and slow.



Once the session started,the photographer positioned them carefully, giving instructions step by step. He arranged them so that Verena stood holding a bouquet, her eyes lowered in a soft smile, while Isaac,seated in his wheelchair, was to wrap one arm around her waist and look at her with affection.



A staff member handed the bouquet to Verena, and she moved to stand at Isaac's side.


"Mrs. Bennett, you look stunning. Let's see a smile,"the photographer remarked warmly, showering her with compliments as he adjusted her pose and waited for just the right angle.


Then his attention shifted. "Mr. Bennett, put your arm around your bride's waist."



Isaac's gaze fell on Verena. The gown she wore revealed the sides of her waist, covered only by a thin sheer layer. Placing his hand there would be almost the same as touching her skin.



He stayed still for several seconds, unable to move.



The photographer peeked up from his camera and chuckled. "Mr. Bennett, are you that captivated by how lovely your bride is?"



Verena's eyes slid toward Isaac, amusement flickering in her expression.



Catching her look sent a sharp jolt through him. He quickly turned away and lowered his head.



After more urging from the photographer, he finally raised his arm and rested it on her waist. Because of his seated position, he had to reach higher than felt natural.



The photographer snapped several shots and then checked the screen. Verena's pose was graceful,her smile effortless, but lsaac's hand looked stiff and awkward in the picture. His eyes, instead of showing warmth, were far too serious, leaving the photo without any real trace of romance.



The photographer turned to Isaac with a grin. "Mr.Bennett, these are pre-wedding photos, not a board meeting. You've got to soften up. Let your eyes do the talking-make it look like you adore her so much the camera can feel it."



To demonstrate,the photographer widened his eyes in an exaggerated way, and then squinted dramatically,even making circles with his hands to mimic glasses.



Verena let out a laugh at his performance, while Isaac's long fingers tightened slightly before he answered, "Alright. I'll try."


His reply seemed to reassure the photographer, who went back to arranging them for another pose.



But when he checked the next picture, he groaned. "Mr. Bennett, you look ready to give a speech in front of a crowd, not vow eternal love."



The image told the story. Verena's face glowed, her posture graceful and easy, while Isaac sat rigid.His jaw was set, his eyes fixed with too much resolve. Instead of tenderness, the picture carried the weight of a formal portrait.



They repeated the process again and again, but the results barely changed. The stiffness lingered in every frame.



The photographer's booming instructions slowly wore down to a hoarse murmur, his patience draining.


Isaac couldn't remember the last time he felt this out of place. Since the accident, he had never faced a camera while seated in his chair, and now the weight of it pressed heavily on him. Looking at Verena so effortlessly radiant only made him feel like an intruder in his own wedding photos.



His chin dropped, and both hands pressed tightly against his motionless legs.


Standing close, Verena caught the change in him. As the photographer stepped away to sip his water, she touched Isaac's shoulder and bent down until her lips were near his ear. "Forget about the camera," she whispered. "Just focus on me."

###Chapter 31 Verena Kissed Him
When the photographer came back, he asked Isaac and Verena to shift into a different pose.



He decided on a pose that felt straightforward and did not require much interaction between them.



"Let's try to get the feeling right this time," he said aloud. "Mrs. Bennett, I want you to sit on Mr. Bennett's lap and loop your arms around his neck."



At the mention of "lap," Isaac's brow tightened. His legs might hold steady enough, yet the weakness in them meant that even the smallest slip could send her tumbling.



Catching on to his discomfort, Verena chose not to bring up his legs and instead teased lightly, "Relax, I'm not that heavy."



His eyes lingered on her, and a quiet warmth stirred inside.She clearly understood his concern had nothing to do with her weight.



Words were about to leave his lips when the photographer cut in, saying, "Mr. Bennett, if you think she might slip, hold her back and steady her head with

your hands."


Before he could even register the instructions, Verena had perched sideways on his lap, her toes brushing against the floor.



Since Isaac had no sensation in his legs, he never noticed that Verena was hardly placing her weight on him.



She slipped her slender arms around his neck, and her skin felt both cool and soft against him.



The brush of her skin sent a sudden tension through him, and his hands moved instinctively to steady her back. His legs gave him nothing, but his chest could not ignore the warmth pressing against it.



Balancing with the help of her legs, Verena leaned close enough that her upper body pressed against his.


When he lowered his eyes, he caught the sweep of her lashes, the sharp line of her nose, and the bold color painted across herlips.



So close to her now, lsaac breathed in a gentle fragrance, a sweetness that seemed to drift through the very air around them.



"That's it, wonderful!" said the photographer as he kept giving instructions. "Now lean in a bit closer."
At his words, Verena tugged Isaac's head lower toward her.



Leaning in, Isaac found himself staring directly into her eyes.



Not content yet, the photographer pushed them further, saying, "Closer. Closer than that."


On this attempt, Isaac leaned in without waiting,and before Verena could guide him, he was already close.A smile spread across her face, delighted by his initiative.



Verena's expression struck the photographer as flawless, and he nearly clicked the shutter right then.Yet when his eyes shifted to lsaac, he spotted the stiffness in Isaac's posture.



The photographer clicked his tongue thoughtfully and said, "Let's try something else. Touch noses for me,show a little more closeness."



Verena gave a small nod and lifted her chin, brushing the tip of her nose against Isaac's.


The moment Verena leaned closer, the photographer snapped the shot.



Her shift made Isaac's lashes tremble, and the hand resting at her back gripped more firmly without him

 realizing it.



A faint wince crossed Verena's face as the pressure brushed against a bruise from earlier.



He quickly eased his hold and met her eyes with regret. "I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?"


She gave a calm shake of her head, unbothered. "It's nothing. Let's keep going."



Holding her position steady, Verena stayed still while Isaac's thoughts drifted. "Did I hurt you..." The words echoed in his mind as if he had spoken them to someone once before.



Catching his faraway look, Verena angled her head and, to her own surprise, pressed her lips against his.



When her warm lips touched his cool ones, a fierce spark rushed through Isaac's thoughts like a sudden current.



In that instant, Isaac forgot how to think or move,and only the steady throb in his neck reminded him that Verena had kissed him.



Watching the scene unfold, the photographer's face lit with satisfaction, and he snapped the shot at once.



"These turned out better than l imagined." He stepped back,eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he studied the shots one by one.



At the sound of the photographer's praise, Verena eased back a little from lsaac.



While pulling back, she caught sight of something amusing. Isaac's ears burned red with shyness, yet his expression showed no trace of anger.



The look on his face tempted Verena, and she decided to tease him.



Following her playful impulse, she leaned in close,smiling as she whispered gently into his ear, "You were the one who got distracted, so I had to think of something. Otherwise, the photographer would grow impatient. And hey, we're getting married soon, so this shouldn't be that big of a deal, right?"


Her words came in a softened tone, and she tilted her head,looking straight into Isaac's eyes with a spark of mischief.



A visible swallow moved along lsaac's throat as her gaze held him, and he quickly lowered his eyes. His voice, rougher than he noticed, came out as he murmured, "Sure... it's fine."


Verena accepted his answer with a nod, let her teasing drop,and smiled while lifting herself from his lap.



After holding that posture for so long, her legs had gone numb, and her soles tingled sharply as though pierced by countless tiny needles.



Isaac saw the way she shifted her legs and caught the strain on her face, yet he chose not to ask about it.



Once that moment passed, the rest of the shoot moved along with unexpected ease, free from the serious look the photographer had stressed earlier.



By the time the session ended, the clock had slipped past ten in the evening. Isaac brought Verena home before telling the driver to continue on to the Bennett Mansion.



Inside the car, lsaac took the contract from his assistant's hand, but not a word on the page would stay in his mind. Instead, the memory of Verena's kiss kept replaying, the delicate warmth still lingering on his lips.



Caught in that memory, Isaac's fingers drifted up and brushed his lips without him realizing it.


The assistant repeated Isaac's name more than once,but no answer came back.



Through the rearview mirror, the assistant noticed Isaac's fingers resting against his lips.


In a louder tone, he called out, "Mr. Bennett,are your gums hurting?" Startled out of his thoughts by the sudden volume,Isaac pulled his hand back and gripped the contract,saying, "No, I.. only noticed a problem with the contract."



"What?" The word "problem" sent a jolt of tension through the assistant. As he turned to look, his mouth hung open in disbelief. "Mr. Bennett, you... the contract is upside down."



When Isaac glanced down and saw the words printed upside down, he quickly adjusted the pages,as though snapping out of a dream.



Noticing the shock on his assistant's face, Isaac cleared his throat and mumbled with unease, "Today ...the photo shoot wore me out a little."


The assistant could hardly believe it. Wore him out?



Never before had he heard lsaac, the tireless workaholic, confess to exhaustion.



Though surprised, he gave a nod, silently recognizing the effort Isaac had made.







After they finished taking the pre-wedding photos,Verena started getting busy with other things. 
During her time overseas, she began taking patients suited for traditional treatments. Along with the newcomers, she still kept in touch with her longtime patients for regular follow-ups


On this particular day, Barrie was scheduled for his follow-up visit.



Her errands kept her out until late in the afternoon,after which she drove straight to the Lyons family's residence.



At the same time in the Willis Villa, Laura stood behind Kaia in the dressing room, resting her hands firmly on the girl's shoulders. With a tone both earnest and serious, she said, "Kaia, tonight marks Mr. and Mrs.Lyons' thirtieth wedding anniversary. Many powerful guests will be at the party. When you attend,you must build connections with them. Do you understand?"

###Chapter 32 Do You Happen To Know Dr. Willis
The Lyons family had nothing to do with the Willis family, so Kaia couldn't believe it when Slater suddenly sent her an invitation.



When Kaia saw the invitation, she didn't know what to think. Laura, however, immediately guessed that Slater might be interested in Kaia.



The idea excited Kaia, though she could only remember one embarrassing moment when he skipped out on her birthday party. Aside from that,they hardly spoke. Maybe Slater only reached out because he was close with Bobby, and since she had been interacting with Bobby a lot recently, he felt it natural to include her too. Whatever the reason, Kaia didn't mind. As long as the connection worked in her favor,she welcomed it.



"Mom,you don't need to remind me. I already know what I'm doing," said Kaia, proudly adjusting the pearl necklace in front of the mirror. She turned slightly and asked, "How do I look?"



Laura's eyes softened as she watched her daughter dress so carefully. "You look beautiful, sweetheart. The prettiest of them all."



Laura stood behind her, fixing a few strands of Kaia's hair before another thought came to her.



"Oh, isn't Slater's grandfather Barrie in poor health?Since you're studying medicine, you could show him a few ways to take better care of himself.Maybe even send some health supplements. His son and daughter -in-law are known to be very devoted. If Barrie takes a liking to you, it could open doors for us."



In Shoildon, the Lyons family didn't hold as much power as the Bennett family, but they were still influential. If the Willis family managed to win their favor, their standing in the city would rise quickly.



Kaia fully understood the value of her mother's suggestion and knew exactly why it mattered.


She turned to her mother with a confident smile."You don't have to worry, Mom. I've already taken care of everything. Just relax."



Pleased that Kaia grasped her intentions, Laura brushed her fingers across her daughter's cheek. "You really are thoughtful."



Then Laura's smile faded as she thought of Verena."Your grandmother spoiled Verena too much. I can't count on her anymore." Noticing that Laura had completely lost faith in Verena, Kaia didn't bother to offer false comfort anymore. She simply held her mother's hand and said sweetly, "But you still have me,right?"



Laura's pride swelled at Kaia's words. Even if Verena was beyond saving,she still had her younger daughter.From childhood, Kaia had always been exceptional.She was even considered a lucky star, since the family became millionaires shortly after her birth.



As she grew older, Kaia stood out in her studies, and it seemed likely she would one day become a respected doctor who brought honor to the family. It was proof that children thrived when they grew up beside their parents. The difference between Kaia and Verena made that obvious.








Even on her way to the Lyons estate, Kaia clung to the hope that Slater might like her.


It wasn't until Slater gave her a polite nod and told someone to show her to the party venue that Kaia understood she was nothing more than one guest among many.



"Do you want me to send these gifts to your grandfather?" asked Slater's assistant, gesturing toward the stack of boxes Kaia had brought.

 Slater had never thought well of Kaia, and the only reason he invited her was to ease his guilt for skipping her birthday party.


What he truly couldn't stand was the way Kaia tried so desperately, and so insincerely, to force a connection with him.



Slater glanced at the boxes, and then waved dismissively. "Put them in the warehouse. After the party, let the servants divide them up."



The assistant nodded and quickly ordered the staff to move the boxes into storage.



The Lyon family's estate had two main buildings. The party was held in the front building, while the back was kept more private.



Kaia quickly grew bored at the party since everyone already seemed familiar with one another, leaving her with no chance to join in.



Frustrated, Kaia slipped out of the party with a glass of red wine and strolled onto the small briddge that led toward the back garden.



Then she caught sight of a white figure ahead and stiffened. Was that Verena? What was she doing here?



Her eyes went wide, and without thinking, Kaia  followed after her.



She trailed behind until she realized Verena was making her way toward Barrie's quarters.



Kaia's thoughts raced. It couldn't be true. What connection could Verena possibly have with Barrie?



Even though she struggled to believe it, a ripple of worry spread through her chest.



She hurried her steps, trying to close the gap between herself and the woman ahead.



Just a few steps later, a familiar voice called out behind her, "Who are you sneaking after? You look way too suspicious."



Bobby shifted his gaze to where Kaia was looking.Ahead of them, a woman in a white dress with long hair walked away, her figure strikingly familiar.



Kaia's nerves spiked again. Bobby had mentioned that he wanted to meet Verena. If he realized the woman ahead of them was her, everything would fall apart.He might decide Verena was good enough to be his sister -in-law and stop trying to break the marriage arrangement. Worse still, all the lies Kaia had told him about Verena would collapse the moment he saw her face. She couldn't let that happen.



Thinking fast, Kaia spun around and pulled out her

  phone. "I'm not following anyone. I was just looking around. Anyway, didn't you say you wanted to meet Verena? I can give you her contact info so you two can talk<.”



Her words caught Bobby off guard, though he still looked skeptical. "You're serious?"


Kaia nodded quickly. "Of course. Why would I lie about that?"



Bobby pulled his phone from his jacket pocket."Alright then. I'll trust you on this one."


Once he sent the friend request, Bobby held out his phone for her tosee."This the right one?"



Kaia gave it a quick glance, and then smiled as she nodded. "Yeah, that's her."



Satisfied with her answer, Bobby slipped his phone back into his pocket and walked off without another word.



The moment he left, Kaia pulled out her phone. She switched to her alternate account and accepted Bobby's request.



There was no way she'd let Bobby meet Verena, so she wasn't foolish enough to give him a real number.


In fact, she hadn't even added Verena on any chat app  herself.



By the time midnight drew near, the party had finally come to an end.



In Barrie's room, Verena had just completed another round of treatment for him.



Barrie had been feeling much stronger recently, and tonight he leaned against the headboard with a cheerfuL expression.



"I'm really sorry for taking up so much of your time,Dr. Willis," Barrie said apologetically.


Verena gave a calm smile. "Please don't say that. It's part of my responsibility."


After exchanging a few more words with him, Verena excused herself and left the room.



By then, most guests had already drifted out of the front building. After saying goodbye to Slater, Bobby was ready to head out as well.



Just as he turned to leave, he stopped short. A woman in a white wool coat and faded denim jeans passed by.Her skin was luminous, her lashes curled delicately,and her profile was striking. What caught him most was her cool, almost untouchable air. That was...



"Hey!" Bobby shouted as he rushed after her. Verena came to a stop, her brows knitting as she turned to the young man blocking her path. "Who are you?"



"I'm the one you pulled out of that wreck. You saved me after the crash," said Bobby, his voice rushing with excitement.



At his words, Verena finally recalled the incident.


She gave a small nod. "So, what is it? Are you feeling unwell, or do you need something from me?"


Bobby nodded eagerly, words rushing to the tip of his tongue but refusing to come out. "I've got something to tell you, but... give me a moment to find the right words."



"Do you happen to know Dr.Willis?"

###Chapter 33 Should I
Compete With You



Bobby was about to speak when Slater came over and asked if he knew Dr. Willis.



"Dr. Willis?" Bobby blinked in disbelief, his eyes flicking to Verena before he turned to Slater. "Wait-are you saying she's the one who treated your grandfather?"



Slater gave a firm nod. "Yeah. That's her."



Bobby stared at Verena, stunned. "You're not just gorgeous-you're talented too?"



Noticing the awe on Bobby's face, Slater asked curiously, "Wait,do you actually know her?"



Bobby swallowed hard and gave a quick nod. "She's the doctor who pulled me through after my car accident."



Leaning closer,Bobby whispered with barely contained excitement, "She's exactly the kind of woman I'd want as my sister-in-law."



Slater let out a short laugh. "What are the odds of that?"
All of a sudden, every argument they'd had felt meaningless.



Catching their exchange, Verena gave Bobby a warm smile. "It was nothing, really. I'm just glad to see you doing well."


That easy smile left Bobby frozen in place.She really was everything he imagined-beautiful, graceful, and impossible to ignore.


When Slater caught Bobby grinning like a fool, he gave him a teasing shove.



Bobby snapped out of his daze, suddenly remembering something important. "Oh, right, Dr.Willis." His voice grew urgent. "If you were able to treat Slater's grandfather, then your skills must be remarkable. I need your help. My brother's legsare paralyzed... do you think there's any chance he can be treated?"



Bobby had been tempted to blurt out that she should be his sister-in-law, but he knew he'd only get yelled at for that. Instead, he took the long way around,hoping lsaac would eventually see for himself how kind and extraordinary the doctor truly was.



Noticing his desperation, Verena gave him a calm smile. "It's hard to explain in words. Every case is different, and I can't say anything for sure until I see the patient myself."


By coincidence, she happened to be studying Isaac's condition at that very time.



Bobby's brow creased as he asked, "Have you ever treated someone with leg paralysis?"


Verena answered calmly,"I've worked on two cases like that before. And I'm currently treating a patient with leg paralysis."


His words rushed out. "And did they recover?"


Verena gave a small nod. "It took years of treatment and steady recovery, but in the end, both of them walked again."



The moment her words sank in, Bobby lit up, all thoughts of his earlier schemes vanishing. "Dr. Willis,please-you have to help my brother."


Verena's voice stayed steady. "I'll need to examine him first before I can say anything."



Even though surgery still weighed on her mind as a difficult barrier, she knew she had to keep pushing herself to face patients directly.



Bobby held out his phone eagerly. "Can I add you on the chat app? I promise I won't bother you with random messages." After a moment of thought, Verena nodded."Alright."



The second she agreed, Bobby broke into a wide smnile.



Once she added him, Verena slipped her phone back into her pocket. "When you're home, ask your brother if he's willing to meet me. If he agrees,we can set up a time."



Bobby nodded over and over. "Alright, alright-I'll talk to him for sure."



With a slight press of her lips, Verena offered a calm smile and said, "Well then, I suppose it's time for me to go."



The moment Verena mentioned leaving, Bobby cheerfully waved her off and kept smiling until she disappeared through the front gates.



Slater, unable to watch any longer, shoved Bobby's hand down. "Seriously? She's already gone, and you're still standing here grinning like an idiot."



Bobby folded his arms and lifted his chin with pride."What do you expect? She's smart,gorgeous, and the perfect sister-in-law. I could smile at her all day without getting tired of it."



Slater couldn't stand that smug expression on his face. He let out an exaggerated gasp. "Oh, right-I never told you. My grandpa once said I should go after Dr.Willis myself. So what now? Should I compete with you to see if she'd rather be my girlfriend or your sister-in-law?"



Bobby's temper flared. "Dream on! She's already destined to be my sister-in-law. You don't get to challenge Isaac. And if you try... I'll-"


He jabbed a finger at Slater, paused dramatically for a few seconds, and then blurted out his so-called threat. "I'll cut you off as a friend!"



Once upon a time, Slater never would've been able to measure up to Isaac. But now, with Isaac bound by his disability, things weren't the same anymore.


After throwing out his so-called threat, Bobby didn't bother waiting for a reaction. He wasn't angry-just in a rush to get home.



Left standing in the chilly night, Slater shook his head as Bobby stormed off. "Unbelievable. I was joking,and he's already acting like we're about to break up as friends."




...



Back home, Bobby sprawled across his bed, his eyes fixed on the ceiling Phone in hand, his gaze stayed locked on the new contact he'd just added-Dr. Willis.



Her profile picture was nothing but a white backdrop,simple yet giving off a calm, reserved vibe.



Still, Bobby was convinced she carried both wisdom and grace.



With that thought in mind, Bobby tapped her profile,erased the name "Dr. Willis," and proudly renamed it "Perfect Sis-in-Law."



He admired the change for a moment, and then went back to his homepage looking pleased with himself.


Earlier that day,he had gotten Verena's number from Kaia and added her as a friend. Her profile now sat just beneath the one he labeled as Perfect Sis-in-Law.



When his eyes landed on the golden profile picture,Bobby let out a mocking sneer. "So tacky. No sense of style at all."



He opened her chat and quickly sent a message,saying, "Verena Willis,I want to meet. Tell me when you're free."



Whether Verena was right for lsaac or not, her past lies about her education and her attempt to disfigure her sister had already filled him with disgust. Normally,

 he wouldn't have bothered with someone like her. But since she was about to join their family, he had no choice but to meet her face-to-face. He was determined to uncover who she really was and how she managed to fool lsaac so completely.



He sat there with his phone in hand, eyes fixed on the screen as he waited for her reply.


Meanwhile, over at the Willis Villa, Kaia sat before her vanity, her makeup still perfect, yet her expression was clouded with frustration.



Anyone could tell her mood had soured completely.


A knock came at the door, and Laura's voice followed."Kaia, who did you meet today? Tell me everything."


Kaia bit her lip as she unclasped her necklace. "Mom,not tonight. I'm exhausted and just want to sleep."


Laura longed to hear about her daughter's social wins,but after Kaia's response, she had no choice but to drop the subject.
###Chapter 34 Bobby Confronts Verena
Laura gave a small nod before saying, "Alright, get some rest. We'll catch up tomorrow."


Once the sound of footsteps vanished down the hall,Kaia flung the pearl necklace to the side without hesitation.



When Kaia returned home earlier, Laura had noticed something was weighing on her and asked if the evening had gone poorly.



Instead of explaining, Kaia had shaken her head,claimed she was tired, and quickly used that excuse to head upstairs.



The truth was different. Kaia wasn't tired at all, but she couldn't figure out why Verena had appeared at the Lyons family residence. What baffled her even more was the sight of Verena inside Barrie's quarters. Barrie held status and influence, yet Verena, who had no place in that circle, dared to show up there?



An uneasy feeling pressed against Kaia's thoughts. She tried piecing it together, but no matter how long she turned it over in her mind, she found no answer. At last, she told herself she must have been imagining

  things. After all, someone like Verena couldn't possibly have ties to Barrie.



With that idea to cling to, her nerves finally began to settle.



Kaia pulled out her phone, intending to check the wealthy young people's group chat, hoping to see if anything new had been shared.



When the chat app loaded, she realized she had signed into her alternate account, where one unread message was waiting.



Since that account remained private, she instantly knew Bobby was the one who had sent it.


She tapped into their conversation and read his note about wanting to meet Verena, which curved her lips into a smirk. The sharpness in his words revealed just how little regard he had for Verena.


That thought made Kaia laugh, though it still didn't satisfy her. What she really wanted was to see Bobby push with everything he had to put an end to Verena and Isaac's wedding.



It was clear to Kaia that Bobby's pride left no room for anyone trying to tell him what to do.



Her eyes dropped to her phone as her fingers danced quickly across the screen. Once she reread the message for accuracy, she hit send without hesitation.



When Bobby's phone buzzed, he snatched it up, sat bolt upright in bed, and gawked at the screen in shock.



The words on his screen made him read them twice."You need to stop speaking to me with such disrespect. I'll be your brother's wife soon, and as Isaac's brother, the least you can do is show me courtesy."



Rage surged through Bobby as he reread the message.He knew he had been sharp with her on purpose, and even if his tone wasn't polite, who gave her the right to call him out? She wasn't even married into the family yet, and she was already strutting around like she owned the place. If she behaved like this now,what kind of arrogance would she show once she officially joined the Bennett family?



His thumbs flew across the screen as he responded,"You're not Isaac's wife yet. I'll speak to you however I damn well please, and it's not your concern."



The moment Kaia saw his response, a slow, satisfied smile curled across her lips. Bobby was already losing patience, and that was exactly what she wanted. If she kept pressing, his resentment toward Verena would deepen, and he'd soon be desperate to block the marriage altogether.

 She leaned back and began typing again. "Do you think I enjoy wasting my time on you? If you weren't Isaac's brother, I wouldn't bother at all. Once I marry him, I'll be part of the Bennett family, which makes it my responsibility to correct you. If I don't straighten you out now, people will say members of our Bennett family have no manners. That shame won't just fall on you-it will stain all of us."



The message sent Bobby into a fury. She was already tossing around phrases like "our Bennett family," as though she had a claim to it. She hadn't even joined the family yet, and still she dared to posture like a rightful Bennett.



Fingers pounding against the screen, Bobby snapped,"Listen carefully. Don't try to play teacher with me.Unless I decide otherwise, you'll never be my sister-in -law, not now, not ever. And don't forget, the wedding hasn't even happened yet. You act like it's guaranteed, but if you fail to step into the Bennett family, don't come crying about it later."



When the message was sent, Bobby closed the app and flung his phone carelessly onto the nightstand.



Each time Bobby thought about Verena beside Dr.Willis, it only made him more determined to steer Isaac toward marrying the doctor. After just a handful of conversations with that cold and cunning woman, he caught himself wanting to march over and ask Dr.Willis to marry lsaac on the spot. A woman like her,kind, elegant, and lovely, was exactly what lsaac needed.



It drove him crazy wondering how two people sharing the same last name could be so completely opposite.



Silence filled the room as Bobby's fist crashed against the mattress. Forget Verena-what mattered nowN was finding a way to bring lsaac and Dr. Willis together. He had no doubt that once they met, lsaac would be captivated.



Of course, Bobby understood his brother well enough to know that a direct suggestion would be rejected outright. But if he disguised it as a medical consultation, Isaac might agree without resistance.That way, his condition could be treated while their bond quietly deepened-a flawless plan.



The image of Isaac healthy again and standing beside Dr. Willis played vividly in Bobby's mind, fueling his resolve like fire.



Jumping to his feet, Bobby shoved on his shoes and strode quickly out of the room.



At the same time, Kaia studied Bobby's latest message,her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.



His sharp response confirmed he was seething, and Verena's reputation in his eyes was beyond repair.


The thought brought a smug smile to Kaia's lips as she hummed a light tune on her way to the bathroom to wash off her makeup.


As long as Bobby blocked the marriage, her lie would remain safe, because Verena would never get the chance to cross paths with him.



Inside the Bennett Mansion, Bobby made his way down the hall until he reached Isaac's door.



Remembering how badly Isaac had snapped at him the last time he barged in, Bobby decided to knock politely this time.


Isaac's voice called out, "Come in." Bobby placed his hand on the knob, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.



There he found Isaac propped against the headboard,a thick book resting in his hands.


With a forced laugh, Bobby strolled closer and teased,"So,buried in a book again?"


Setting the book down on the blanket, Isaac lifted his eyes and said, "Alright, what do you want?"


Dragging a chair from the desk, Bobby sat near the bed and grinned. "What else could it be?I just felt like  talking."



Most people might have believed him, but lsaac knew better. Bobby never came by at this hour unless something was on his mind.


After lifting the book again, Isaac resumed reading and said,"If you don't have a point, then get out."


Snatching the book from lsaac's hands, Bobby blurted out, "Okay, okay-I'lL say it."


Isaac kept his calm, watching Bobby in silence.



Meeting Isaac's steady gaze, Bobby's mouth tightened as he hesitated.



What he wanted was to rant about Verena's arrogance,but the memory of lsaac's harsh scolding last time made him switch tactics instead.



"So here's the thing-I came across an incredible doctor recently." Bobby's eyes sparked with enthusiasm as he leaned forward. "You wouldn't believe it. Every other doctor failed with Barrie's illness, but she actually managed to stabilize him!"

###Chapter 35 Why Not Just Give Her A Chance
Bobby leaned forward eagerly and blurted out, "Isaac,I've already added her on the chat app. Why don't you set up a time to meet her? I swear, with her skills, she could fix your legs for sure!"



He was too caught up in his own excitement to notice the faint crease forming on Isaac's brow.



The mention of Barrie's so-called recovery pulled a smirk from lsaac. Dozens of renowned doctors had failed, and yet this one was supposed to succeed?



Picking up his book, Isaac flipped the page and said evenly, "That won't be necessary. I know my own condition better than anyone. No matter how capable she is, it makes no difference for me."


While he spoke, an image of Verena surfaced in his thoughts.Why was it only her that stirred hope in him,only her he felt he could believe in?



His lips pressed into a thin line before he added, "I'm already in treatment. You don't need to involve yourself in this."



Up until now, Cayden had been the one overseeing  Isaac's treatment. So when Isaac mentioned being in treatment, Bobby immediately assumed Cayden was still handling it. He vaguely recalled Cayden once admitting that the surgery carried no more than a thirty percent chance of success.



It wasn't that Bobby distrusted Cayden's abilities, but faced with the promise of a doctor who appeared even more remarkable, his loyalties naturally shifted.


After all, Dr. Willis had claimed she'd successfully cured two patients with leg paralysis-and if that was true, then surely she was the better choice.



Realizing Isaac wasn't going to agree easily, Bobby decided to pour on the charm and persuasion.



"Isaac, I'm asking you to believe me. This doctor isn't ordinary. Think back to Barrie's illness a few years ago -every specialist, here and overseas, refused to take the risk of that impossible heart transplant. But she did it,and she pulled it off flawlessly. Please, just meet her once. Maybe she really can change everything for you."



When Isaac kept his eyes locked on the book,showing no sign of giving in, Bobby grew frantic and yelled,"Don't you even want the chance to walk on your own again?"



For just a second Isaac's hand stilled on the page, but then he calmly turned it and kept reading.


Catching himself, Bobby slapped a hand over his mouth and murmured, "I didn't mean it like that, Isaac."


Trying to recover, he added, "I only meant she's exceptional. If she could handle Barrie's case, she can handle yours too. Why not just give her a chance?"


Isaac had tolerated Bobby's endless peading,but the refusal to drop the subject left him weary,and a dull ache began to settle in his temples.


At last, Isaac closed the book, fixed him with a cold,unblinking look, and said, "Barrie's illness is different from mine, so don't compare them. Your praise for that doctor is just the view of an outsider, and it means nothing to me. I have no reason to meet her,and I won't be accepting her treatment."


Then his voice turned firm as he instructed, "That's enough. It's late. Go back to your room."



Bobby had clung to the hope that lsaac might finally say yes,but the blunt refusal knocked the wind out of him. A wave of sadness and frustration washed over him, because in his heart, everything he said had only been for lsaac's sake.


Bobby kept his frustration to himself. If Isaac didn't want him stepping in, then fine-he'd stop wasting energy on someone who clearly didn't want the help. Let him pick whichever doctor he wanted, and if he had someone in mind to marry, then so be it. That was his business now.



Resigned to it, Bobby sighed out a flat "okay" before dragging himself back to his room.







In the days that followed, Verena spent her time shuttling between the Lyons estate and the Willis Villa.


At last, after two long weeks of treatment,Verena pulled out the final needle from Barrie's leg and smiled. "Congratulations. From here on out, you won't need these sessions anymore."



Before Barrie had a chance to respond, Slater's eyes lit up with joy. "Are you serious, Dr. Willis? My grandpa truly doesn't need the treatment anymore?"



Verena gave a confident nod, and Slater immediately bowed in gratitude. "Thank you so much,Dr.Willis."


She steadied him by the shoulders and smiled. "His progress is thanks in part to the care you've given him."


"Indeed." From the bed, Barrie clasped Slater's hand,his dim eyes filled with warmth. "You've grown thin looking after me like this."



Placing his firm hand over Barrie's frail one, Slater met his gaze with devotion. "Grandpa, I don't feel tired at all. Nothing matters more than your health."


As Verena watched the tender exchange between grandfather and grandson, her thoughts drifted to her own grandmother, Shawna. If only Shawna were still alive... Without her, Verena had no real family left in this world.



A tightness formed in her throat, but Verena forced the memory away with a steady blink.


Turning back to Slater, she instructed, "His condition is stable,but small problems remain that need medicine.I'll write down the prescriptions, and you can handle preparing them for him."


Slater gave a firm nod. "Alright, I'll take care of it."



Devoted as ever, Slater personally took charge of preparing every dose of Barrie's medicine.



When Verena handed over the prescriptions and finished her instructions, she added warmly, "That's everything for now. I won't be coming for the treatments anymore, but if your grandfather feels unwell, just call me. Unless something unusual keeps me away, I'll come without hesitation."



Overwhelmed with gratitude, Slater kept thanking her again and again for helping his grandfather recover. Once Verena departed, Slater carried the herbal medicine she prescribed into the kitchen and began preparing the brew himself.


As the herbs simmered, Slater pulled out his phone and snapped a quick picture of the steaming pot


Grinning with pride, he uploaded the photo with a caption:"These remedies are working-Grandpa's legs are finally improving. Couldn't be happier!"



Back at the Willis Villa, relaxing on the sofa, Kaia scrolled idly through her phone until Slater's update appeared, sending a rush of excitement through her.The herbs and supplements she had sent to the Lyons estate had actually taken effect.


Pride swelled in her chest, and a smile tugged at her lips. Even the remedies she had chosen so casually were helping Barrie heal-it almost felt like proof she had a natural talent for medicine.



Scrolling back to reread his post, Kaia's grin widened until she let out a laugh. Everyone knew how devoted Slater was to his grandfather, so if Barrie's recovery was tied to the herbs and supplements she gave, then surely Slater would start viewing her differently.



From the couch nearby, Laura shifted her gaze from the TV when she heard Kaia laughing and asked with curiosity, "Kaia, what's on your phone that's got you so cheerful?"



With her cheeks warm from excitement, Kaia eagerly passed the phone to her mother and said, "Mom,you've got to see what Slater posted."



Peering at the screen for a moment, Laura's eyes went wide in surprise. "Goodness! Is that the same herbal medicine you sent over before?"
###Chapter 36 Since When Do You Care About Me
With a smug lift of her brow, Kaia remarked, "What else do you expect? Others hand out jewels or overpriced trinkets, but I'm the one who gave herbs and supplements."



At those words, Laura's face glowed with pride as she cupped Kaia's cheeks. "That's my daughter.Absolutely extraordinary!"



Satisfaction welled up in Laura's heart. She had always believed Kaia brought fortune to the family. After all,it was only after giving birth to Kaia that their fortunes rose,giving them the means to invest and step into high society.



Even with the Bennett family offering them advantages through marriage, Laura could sense Danica's condescension toward them.



In Laura's mind, whatever benefits came from the Bennetts would never last forever.



What she longed for were lasting gains, and winning the Lyons family's respect while widening her circle was far more valuable. Praise from a parent always struck deep, and Kaia's eyes curved with pride as satisfaction spread across her face.



From this moment, Laura grew more certain of one undeniable truth.



Gripping Kaia's shoulders, Laura spoke with fiery enthusiasm. "Kaia, do you see it now? Society is full of pretty socialites, but respected doctors are rare.The higher a family climbs, the more they obsess over their health. That's why you must master medicine.Once you do, powerful families will line up for your attention."



Her imagination ran wild with images of the most powerful people bending over backward to win her favor, and the very thought filled her with glee.



Catching Laura's meaning, Kaia nodded eagerly.She said sweetly, "Mom, you don't have to worry. I'll take medicine seriously. Just think, if it weren't for the herbs and supplements I picked out, Slater's grandfather would probably still be stuck in bed.Clearly, I've got a real gift for this."



Laura's heart swelled with relief at Kaia's words, but before she could respond, Verena stepped in from the doorway.



The sight of the cozy scene between mother anddaughter didn't surprise Verena anymore; she had grown desensitized to it.



She was about to slip by without a word when Laura's voice cut through the room.



"Where did you run off to this time?" Laura asked.



Before, Laura wouldn't have cared where Verena had gone. Yet with Kaia filling her with pride today, she couldn't help but measure one daughter against the other. How could her two daughters be so completely different?



The more she compared them, the more bitterness and resentment churned in her chest.



Stopping in her tracks, Verena shot Laura a sidelong glance. "Since when do you care about me?"



Laura shot up from her seat, clearly put off by Verena's tone. "Who do you think you're trying to impress with that superior act? Save it for someone else who'll actually put up with it."



Laura's gaze drifted proudly to Kaia. "See the difference? Kaia has always been thoughtful and obedient. She's in college now, and every teacher sings her praises. Just recently, with a few herbs she picked out, she even managed to help someone recover." Then she turned, pointing a sharp finger at Verena."And you? You failed to get into college, and then wasted time trailing after some self-taught village healer, picking up nothing but a foultemper.At your age, you're still a nobody. You can't even greet your own mother properly-forget skill, you don't even have basic manners."



Silent,Verena fixed her gaze on Laura. Each word felt like a needle pressing into her skin, hitting the rawest part of her.



From the day her younger sister was born, she had sensed Laura's dislike. Still, she had never imagined that, in her mother's eyes, she meant absolutely nothing. She had told herself she wanted nothing from her parents, that nothing could wound her anymore.But why then did the chill inside feel so sharp?



Her throat constricted, and she forced a faint curl of her lips. In a near whisper, she said, "Ye5, I am rude,because after | turned seven, I no longer had a mother."



The year Kaia was born, Verena had just turned seven,and from that moment, a mother's affection vanished from her life.



Laura remained rooted in place after hearing those words, her mind blank, and it was only after Verena disappeared upstairs that she slowly returned to Kaia caught sight of the odd look on Laura's face, a look she despised whenever it was connected to Verena.



Biting her lip, Kaia moved closer and clutched her mother's arm. "Mom, with Verena's attitude, do you honestly think she is fit for joining the Bennett family?"



The moment she heard the question,whatever mix of emotions had been on Laura's face gave way to a firm,unyielding look.



Casting a cold glance toward the staircase, Laura remarked, "Suitable or not, she has to marry into the Bennett family."



Kaia understood all too well that profit always outweighed everything else in Laura's eyes. Her question hadn't been to get the answer she wanted but only to shift Laura's focus. The last thing she wanted was to watch her mother show guilt toward Verena.



With the moment behind them,Laura and Kaia settled back on the sofa, slipping easily into their familiar bond.



As Laura turned her attention back to the television,Kaia busied herself by boasting about her newest triumph to her circle of shallow friends. Inside the group chat with her friends, KCaia eagerly sent a message, saying, "Girls, I've got some good news to share."



Almost immediately, a friend replied in excitement,"What happened? Spill it!"


Kaia snapped a screenshot of Slater's update,dropped it into the chat, and added, "See this? The herbs and supplements I gave actually worked, didn't they?"


One of the women who also followed Slater reacted in shock. "Seriously? Those herbs in his post came from you?"


With pride swelling in her chest, Kaia answered,"That's right. I am studying medicine after all. I simnply chose some herbs and supplements that suited his grandfather's condition, and to my surprise, they worked."



At the end of her message, she tacked on a shy little emoji.



The chat quickly filled with envy, her friends gushing again and again about how amazing it was to be studying medicine.



Then one of them asked, "Kaia, after helping them like that, the Lyons family has to invite you to dinner,don't they?" Another one quickly added, "Dinner is just the beginning. With the Lyons family's influence, your position in society is sure to climb, Kaia."


Reading their chatter, Kaia couldn't hide her wide grin as she responded, "Please, I didn't help Slater's grandfather just to get a free meal."



Even as she denied it, her thoughts were already drifting into daydreams. After all, with the help she'd given, it was only natural that the Lyons family would invite her to dinner. And dinner with the Lyons family meant more than food-it meant an opening.




...


Back in her room, Verena showered, settled at her desk, and reached for her phone to send lsaac a message.
###Chapter 37 A Husband Reporting To His Wife

Verena sent a message, saying, "Just a gentle reminder. Don't forget you have treatment tomorrow morning."



At that moment, Isaac was tending to the plants on his balcony when the message came through.



Placing the watering can aside, he reached for his phone and answered, "Alright. I'll remember."



From experience, Verena knew he was the type tocut conversations short. Perched on the edge of her bed with a towel in hand, she rubbed her damp hair and asked, "Still awake? What are you doing right now?"



Without giving it much thought, Isaac opened his camera, took a quick photo, and sent it with the note:"Watering plants."



She had expected no more than a curt reply, so the photo caught her off guard, giving her the odd impression of a husband reporting to his wife.



Opening the picture, she saw rows of neatly kept plants on the balcony, evidence of the attention he had given them. The shot was simple and unplanned, yet it showed his legs and one arm draped over the armrest of his wheelchair.



Even with nothing fancy about it, the photo carried a quiet charm that was hard to explain.


Reading the short explanation beneath the photo,Verena suddenly pictured him standing in front of her,giving his answer in that plain, steady way of his.


A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and she began typing a teasing reply on her screen.



After pressing send, Isaac found himself unexpectedly unsettled.



To his surprise, he caught himself waiting for her response with unusual anticipation.



From a reasonable standpoint, it was nothing more than an ordinary conversation.



What he failed to notice was how the firm and unshakable man he was in business had turned hesitant,second-guessing himself.


At that moment, his phone buzzed, and any thought  of pulling back his message vanished as he hurried to open it. What arrived was a voice message from Verena,saying,"I was only asking casually. What, do you think I won't believe you? You even sent a picture.Honestly,it feels like a husband reporting to his wife, worried she won't trust him, so he has to send proof."



When the voice note finished playing, Isaac pressed his lips together. The casual way she spoke of "husband" and "wife" set his ears burning.


A second voice message soon arrived. "In that case,I enjoy it. I hope you'll keep this little habit, Mr. Bennett."


Hearing her playful tone, Isaac's fingers clenched tighter around the phone, and a faint glimmer of a smile lit his deep eyes.


Because her voice carried such softness and teasing closeness, Isaac found himself at a loss for words.His fingers lingered above the screen, unable to type a reply.



As nearly five minutes slipped by with no answer,Verena realized he was most likely retreating into silence once again.



Letting out a soft sigh, she chose to stop pressing him.


She tapped out a short message and sent it. "Alright then. I was only teasing. Don't feel pressured.Sleep well.Goodnight."


Once the message was delivered, Verena set her phone aside and slipped into bed.



As Isaac read her words, he could almost picture her smiling,full of warmth and patience.



His mind drifted back to the bridal shop,where he had turned down her request, and she had smiled then too,saying it was fine.



It struck himn that she seemed to hold limitless patience when it came to him.



All at once, Isaac's chest tightened. He pressed a hand against his heart, sensing a peculiar wave of emotion rising inside.


He struggled to name it, for the feeling was both heavy and suffocating yet oddly filled with joy.


The swirl of emotions consumed him until they fused into a single, vivid memory.



He remembered their first meeting,when Verena had crouched down, lifted her eyes to his, and whispered,"Don't turn me away."



Pulling himself out of the memory, Isaac finally typed out a message to her.



Yet no answer came to him immediately. By the next morning, Verena opened her eyes and found Isaac's message waiting.


His reply was brief. "I'll do my best. Goodnight."


Reading those words, Verena's lips curved into a gentle smile.


To her, it felt as though he was making an effort to bridge the distance between them.



Her playful remarks the night before had not gone wasted.



Rising from bed, Verena drew open the curtains,allowing warm sunlight to pour into the room.



The brilliance outside told her it would be a lovely day.


Once she had freshened up, Verena got into her car and headed out.


This particular day marked Isaac's scheduled treatment.




Upon reaching the hospital, she found Isaac waiting for her.



Placing her medical kit aside, Verena glanced around and noticed Isaac was the only one there.



She tilted her head slightly and asked, "Wasn't Dr. Moore supposed to be here today?"


Even though Cayden had stopped resisting her involvement, he had still attended every session until now.



That was why his absence caught Verena off guard


Isaac massaged his temples and said, "He's occupied with an important surgery today."



Noticing the faint crease in his brows and the tiredness in his face, Verena knelt before him and asked, "What's wrong? Did you not sleep properly last night?"


At the mention of the night before, Isaac lowered his gaze, stole a quick look at her, and then turned aside,murmuring uneasily, "About last night... I'm sorry."


With her brows lifting in puzzlement, she asked,"What do you mean by that? Why would you apologize?"


At her words, Isaac turned his eyes toward her.


Sounding both surprised and careful, he asked, "You're really not angry?"


After thinking it over, Verena realized he must have believed she was upset because she hadn't answered his message the night before. Finding his concern a little amusing, she said, "I was already asleep by that time. I only noticed your message when I woke up this morning."



Tilting her head with a sparkle in her gaze, she added,"So that's the reason you couldn't sleep properly?"


While she talked, Verena studied him closely,catching every subtle change in his expression.



Isaac shifted his eyes away from her piercing stare,uncertain of how to reply.



Deep down, he knew she had hit the mark.



He had no explanation for why it mattered so much to him whether she was upset.



If he thought about it logically, he should have known that someone as patient as her wouldn't grow angry over a slow reply.



When his silence stretched on, Verena laughed lightly."Alright then. Let's get started with the treatment."



Saying this, she stepped forward, ready to help him onto the bed.



Using his hands to roll the wheelchair back,Isaac said,"No,that won't be necessary. My assistant will help me."



During earlier sessions, when Cayden was there,it had  always been him who helped Isaac onto the bed.


Verena reached out and brought the wheelchair to a stop,cutting off his movements.



Looking straight at him, she said, "Isaac, since we're about to be married, helping you onto the bed is something I'll be doing sooner or later. You don't have to push me away."


Helping him onto the bed...


Color rose slowly across Isaac's face.


He understood her words carried no hidden meaning,spoken simply and sincerely.


Still,his thoughts ran wild against his will.


Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Verena caught his hesitation and smiled, believing he questioned her strength. "I can handle it. Just trust me."


For Verena, such a task was hardly worth mentioning.



Back in Clokron, she had once hauled an injured Isaac on her back through two entire streets.



Determination glimmered softly in her dark eyes.


For a moment, Isaac's mind emptied, and he simply nodded his consent. Once he gave in, Verena lifted his arm, draped it around her neck, and steadied it on her shoulder.



Using both hands, she braced his upper body and gathered her strength to raise him.


Once on his feet, Isaac loomed above her slight frame.Guiding him toward the bed, Verena strained with effort, and faint veins surfaced across her forehead.



Seeing her struggle, Isaac felt a sharp ache pierce his chest.



What if...



If he never regained his strength,would she be forced to carry his weight like this forever?



As his thoughts slowly cleared, Isaac realized he was already lyingon the hospital bed.
###Chapter 38 Don't Cry



Once Isaac was settled on the bed, Verena pulled a pair of scissors from her kit and neatly snipped open the hem of his suit trousers.


For the procedure to work properly, his trousers could not press against his thighs, or it would reduce the effect.



Before her eyes, his evenly built legs came into view.


Even after multiple sessions, Isaac still flushed with embarrassment whenever his legs were exposed to her gaze like this.



The beginnings of atrophy were already visible along his legs.



Shutting his eyes, Isaac pressed his fists tightly against the sheets at his sides.



Catching sight of his withdrawn posture, Verena remained silent,reaching instead for the silver needles to start the treatment.



Following her usual routine, she questioned Isaac a bout the sensations he felt with each needle she placed. The responses, however,were the same as before.


Still, Verena reminded herself this was only the beginning, and her confidence in curing him remained firm.



Within half an hour, the session came to an end.



While pulling out the needles one at a time, Verena repeated her usual reminder. "After treatment, don't let yourself get cold. Stay away from drafts or cool air,and watch your diet carefully. Avoid spicy or overly stimulating food."



When her hand moved toward the needle near the root of his thigh, her fingers unintentionally brushed against Isaac's skin.



Her eyes flicked upward, landing on his crotch,still covered by the dark gray fabric of his trousers.


From years of practice, Verena knew that patients with paralysis in the lower limbs often struggled with sexual dysfunction as well.


Back when she first reunited with Isaac after returning to the country, he had admitted that he was unable to function as a normal man.



She longed to raise the matter, but judging by lsaac's fragile state of mind, she knew another time would be more fitting.



Isaac might have lost sensation in his legs, but his eyes missed nothing. The directness of her gaze was impossible to overlook. Had she finally discovered the truth of his condition?



A crushing heaviness pressed against lsaac's chest,leaving himn unable to put his inner turmoil into words.In a rush, he ignored his condition and tried to push himself upright from the bed's edge.



Harsh reality struck when his arms gave out just as he managed to raise himself slightly, sending him collapsing back onto the mattress.


The sudden noise jolted Verena from her thoughts,and believing he only wished to rise, she quickly assisted him into his wheelchair.



"You should just call me next time," she remarked gently.


With his head lowered, lsaac murmured softly,"Thanks."



His assistant guided him into the changing room to put him into a clean pair of suit trousers.



In that moment, Isaac was overcome with a sense of humiliation. Even changing his trousers required another's hand. His fingers clenched tightly around the wheelchair's armrest. How could he possibly think of marrying her while trapped in such a condition?


When he didn't come out after some time had passed,Verena stood at the door and called out softly,"Isaac."


Isaac rolled out from the changing room, his voice deliberately casual as he asked, "What is it?"


Verena's eyes drifted toward him; dressed now in black trousers, his long legs still appeared striking despite the chair beneath him.



Her eyes shifted upward, lingering for a moment just beneath his waist.


Her initial plan had been to restore his legs first, to rebuild his confidence before tackling the deeper issue. Yet now, that approach felt like taking too much time. These issues could be treated at the same time.


Deciding it was wiser to face the problem head-on rather than delay it, Verena asked bluntly, "How serious is the damage to your male function?"


The sharp screech of the wheelchair brakes filled the room, jolting lsaac's body forward from the sudden halt.



Isaac's hand went rigid on the wheel, and after a pause,he lifted his head and asked hesitantly, "What did you just say?" "Stay calm," Verena said casualy, adopting her professional tone. "I'm asking because I need a clearer picture of your condition. In cases like yours,sexual dysfunction is common, but most of it can be treated. So whatever | ask next, I want you to answer honestly.It will affect how much I can help you regain."



Her voice carried no judgment, only calm professionalism, though she failed to see how deeply such words could wound a man's pride.



Isaac attempted to remind himself she was only his doctor. The reality, however, was harsher-she was also his fiancée. Both of them knew his issues, yet hearing such a question spoken aloud made him feel as if every fragment of his shame had been dragged into the open.



Though Isaac understood these questions were standard procedure, speaking about them in front of her tore at him with unbearable pain, as though his chest were being ripped apart. Every word felt like a cruel reminder that he was not only crippled but possibly impotent. Whether recovery was even possible remained unknown, but already he had begun grasping at fragile hopes.



For a long stretch, Isaac said nothing, and then gave a slow nod. When his voice finally emerged,it was low and strained. "Go ahead, ask." Once she saw his consent, Verena drew out a pen and flipped open her notebook.



Her first question was simple. "Do you often use sleeping pills?"



Isaac paused, and then gave a short nod."Occasionally"




From the night of the accident six months ago, Isaac had not known a single night of restful sleep.


He only swallowed two pills on the nights before a critical event or work obligation, hoping at least to function properly the following day.


Beyond that, his nights were either shattered by nightmares or consumed by vivid memories of the crash, memories that clung to him like a shadow and ate away at his mind. At times,he drifted into a hollow daze; more often, he simply lay awake. Again and again, he had to remind himself that his father's death was the weight he carried.


When the word "occasionally" reached her ears,Verena frowned and set her pen still for a moment.She understood his temperament far too well, and she knew he would never take sleeping pills unless an important event waited for him the next day. She suspected that on all the other nights, he chose to torment himself with memories instead. Once she finished writing down his answer, Verena lifted her gaze and asked, "Do you ever struggle with erectile dysfunction?"



Her voice remained steady, carrying the weight of a question spoken as though it were no more than a passing detail.


To Isaac, however, the words cut sharply, and hearing them from her made it sting all the more.



His hands clamped down on the wheels of the chair,and the veins on the back of his palms rose in strained ridges.



By then, Isaac no longer had the courage to form a single word.



He gave a firm nod, dropped his head low,and kept his eyes far from Verena's.



From above his bowed figure came the faint scratch of her pen moving across the page.



Isaac felt his heart sink like a stone. He thought that from the very start, he should never have clung to hope for his condition. He regretted ever agreeing to the marriage arrangement, for it had given Verena the chance to treat him and filled him with expectations he never should have carried. Verena had finished jotting down the information and prepared to ask another question,but when she lifted her eyes, she caught sight of Isaac's bowed head and the pitiful way he sat before her.



Although the room was filled with warmth, he sat in his wheelchair wearing only a thin white shirt. Sunlight filtered in from outside and stretched across his narrow frame, giving him an appearance so fragile and delicate it almost seemed unreal.


At that moment, Verena realized that her questions,which had seemed routine to her, had burdened him with unbearable shame.



The realization struck her heart with pain, and an overwhelming urge rose within her to pull him into her arms.



"Isaac." Verena spoke his name, and when his gaze lifted, she bent down so her soft lips could graze his lowered eyelids with the lightest touch.


Isaac sat in shock, his body frozen as though bound by stillness.



Verena drew herself upright and said in a quiet voice,"You promised you would trust me. So why are you so sad now? Your condition didn't come only from the accident. It's tied to your emotions and your state of mind. I told you that I would heal you, and I meant it. Have you stopped believing me?"


While speaking, she knitted her brows together and stole glances at Isaac's expression from the edge of her vision.



When she caught the faint shift in his expression,Verena lowered her head as if showing weakness. "Is it that you doubt me because I once worked as a doctor in a small town? Do you also see me as someone from a backward place, without knowledge,just like the ones who look down on me?"



By the time her words faltered with the edge of tears,Isaac grew unsettled, unable to bear the thought of her crying. In a rush, he blurted out, "No,I never thought that."



Recognizing the worry on his face, Verena refused to let him off so quickly. She kept her head lowered and made her shoulders tremble in a show of helplessness



Watching her like this left Isaac with the feeling that his heart was suspended in emptiness,reaching for something always just out of reach.



His hand lifted with hesitation, as if he meant to wipe away her tears. His voice caught as he said, "Don't cry.I believe you. I always will. You're going to be my wife Why would I ever look down on you?"


When his fingers stretched forward, they were caught gently in her slender hand.
###Chapter 39 You Seem To Be Enjoying It
Before Isaac could react, Verena lifted her head in one swift motion.



Her smile shone brightly, like sunlight breaking through a spring morning haze



With her head tilted slightly, her eyes curved with delight as she said, "'It's good that you think this way."



Her words came like a feather's touch, light and teasing, as she leaned in once again, brushing a kiss across the corner of Isaac's lips.



A tide of emotion crashed through Isaac.



She kissed him like she had done that many times,every gesture unforced, every glance assured.


His heart seemed to falter for a beat, while a faint fragrance clung to the air between them, leaving his mind stripped bare, unable to muster a single thought in return.



His lashes quivered, his gaze fixed yet vacant, staring at the woman before him as if spellbound. 
Noticing his daze, Verena's lips curved higher.Dissatisfied with his stillness, she leaned closer once more.



All he could see now was her face magnified in his vision-those fluttering lashes, the delicate arc of her features.



Her hand intertwined with his, and her lips found his again.



This was her third kiss of the day.



Was she simply exercising the privileges of being his future wife?



Or could it be... she truly cared for him?



Though Isaac entertained both thoughts, the latter rang louder in his heart.


Once planted, the idea grew like ivy, winding deeper into his mind.



His throat tightened; he swallowed hard, no longer holding back the frantic rhythm of his heart as he slowly closed his eyes.



But just as he surrendered, her lips left his.



When she saw him close his eyes, Verena's smile deepened. She leaned near his ear, her voice low and playful. "You seem to be enjoying it, don't you?


Her tone was deliberately laced with allure, threaded with a hint of mischief.



Isaac snapped back to his senses, eyes flying open,only to find her face inches away,her cheek nearly brushing his.



Meeting her gaze, he felt his heart skip, and then darted his eyes aside, clearing his throat instead of answering her teasing words.



That was when he noticed his hand was still laced with hers, fingers locked together.



His fingers were defined, smooth, and slender, yet they still seemed plain against hers.


Her hand, soft and delicate, wvith slender proportions and faint pink joints, reminded him of fine porcelain,flawless and fragile.



Verena,unaware of the thoughts lingering in his silence, tilted her head, forcing him to meet her eyes once more. Her lips curved as she teased, "Why aren't you answering me?"



Unable to retreat any further, Isaac's ears flushed red,his Adam's apple bobbing nervously.



"I..." His husky voice had barely formed when his phone vibrated from his suit pocket, cutting him off.



Their gazes locked; Isaac looked at Verena with a question in his eyes.


Amused by his expression, Verena released his hand,rose to her feet, and nodded. "Go ahead, answer it."



Isaac clenched his slightly damp palm, pulled out his phone with his other hand, and accepted the call.


The voice on the other end spoke first. "Hello, Mr.Bennett. I'm calling from Weaving Love Bridal Shop.The photos you and Mrs. Bennett took are ready.When would you like to come in with your wifeto select them?"



"Is it the bridal shop?" The room was quiet enough for Verena to overhear.



Isaac nodded, tilting the phone slightly aside. "They're asking when we want to choose the photos."



"Are you busy this afternoon?" she asked.



Isaac hesitated briefly, already sensing what she was leading toward. Then he shook his head. "Only minor tasks-I can leave them to my assistant."



Her lips curved. "Since neither of us is occupied, let's go today." With a slight smile, lsaac gave a short grunt of agreement before telling the staff member, "We'll be there shortly."


He quickly delegated his tasks to his assistant,leaving the driver to take the assistant back to the company.


And so, Isaac rode in Verena's car to the bridal shop.


When they arrived, the staff greeted them warmly.


The same young sales assistant who had initially been dismissive toward Verena last time now hurried forward, offering her a glass of water.



Though Verena remembered the slight, she let it pass,accepting the glass casually and taking a sip.



Seeing her calm demeanor, the sales assistant exhaled in relief.



Verena and Isaac settled onto the sofa, reviewing the photos displayed on the computer.


The staff member handled the mouse with care,pausing at each image for their input.


They viewed several shots, most showing lsaac's solemn face.


"Mrs. Bennett, what do you think of this one?" the staff member asked respectfully. 
Verena studied the photo, unimpressed. "Next."


The staff member scrolled down



"And this?"



She furrowed her brows slightly, raising her chin."Next."



They had selected three earlier, but nothing had pleased them since.



Though both were strikingly attractive, Isaac's expression remained stiff in most shots.



After nearly a dozen more images, Verena's eyes lit up.



In the displayed photo, her arms were looped around Isaac's neck, her body angled on his lap.


She tilted her face upward, while he leaned down,their lips touching lightly, noses nearly brushing-an intimate scene frozen in time.



The staff member, waiting for judgment, held the mouse still.



After gazing for a long moment, Verena's lips curved as she pointed, telling the staff member, "This one's my favorite. Make it large and frame it; I'll hang it in our bedroom."

  Her words sent Isaac's heart into a stutter.



The photo had captured the exact moment she kissed him spontaneously.



He hadn't expected it to turn out so vivid, so genuine -like a portrait of love itself.



And what surprised him most: Verena had claimed it as her favorite.



His mind replayed the sensation of her kiss that day,heat rising to his ears.



So,she liked such closeness,did she?



His shyness ebbed as he looked more closely, noticing a detail missed before.



She hadn't been sitting fully on his lap-a slight ggap remained.



Since his legs couldn't feel anything, he had thought she had truly sat upon him.



But clearly,she hadn't.



The memory surfaced: after the photo was taken,Verena had risen with an awkward stretch of her legs.



Only then did Isaac realize-she must have been balancing on her toes for too long, until her feet went numb.



Quietly, without a word, she had spared him discomfort. In the smallest of details he had overlooked,she had been thoughtful of his condition.



His heart stirred again, beating wildly as if it had slipped its cage, unable to settle back where it belonged.


While he drifted in these thoughts, two photos had already flickered past on the screen.



Then Verena seemed to recall something, turning her face toward him. "Oh, I forgot to ask your opinion.What do you think of this photo?"



Isaac had never been close with other women,though in his world of fame and fortune, many had approached him. Whether their gestures had been intentional or casual, he had always seen through them.


Now,looking at Verena-her innocent eyes meeting his with unguarded sincerity-an unfamiliar tide rose in his chest, carrying unspoken thoughts he could neither voice nor contain.



Just as Verena thought he might retreat into silence or deflect with indifference,. Isaac smiled softly."You're my future wife, Verena; you decide."



His voice carried justenough weight to reach the ears of those nearby.


Several female staff covered their mouths, whispering with envy. "Oh my, he's so gentle."


Verena froze,momentarily stunned. Warmth rushed to her cheeks, pulling her back to reality



As her gaze lingered in Isaac's bright eyes, she quickly pressed her lips together and turned back toward the computer, leaving him only her profile.


Isaac's eyes flickered with a newfound realization.



His gaze rested on the faint blush coloring her cheeks.


So-she could be shy as well.


By the time the sun had lowered its light, the selection of wedding photos was complete.



Isaac's assistant was already waiting at the entrance of the bridal shop. When everything was wrapped up,Verena and Isaac each departed in their own cars.



Some days later, Verena sat reviewing her freshly completed manuscript for a medical book.


Stretching her limbs, she felt her phone buzz across the desk.



The screen lit up with a name: "Gavin Reid." Gavin was one of her assistants.



Unlike Julianna, he was still a medical student, and his family carried notable influence in Shoildon.



In truth, he had been sent by his father to study under her guidance.


Yet despite those circumstances, Gavin and Verena shared a natural ease in working together.
###Chapter 40 Who Are You With
With a light laugh, Verena lifted her phone and accepted the call.


Before she could speak, an enthusiastic voice burst through the line. "Evelyn, I'm back from overseas!|just landed at Shoildon Airport. Do you have time to come get me? Let's go out for a meal; it's on me."


Securing the files from her desk inside the drawer,Verena answered, "Alright, wait there for me."


Once the call ended, she made her way to the garage and started her car.



The Willis Villa stood far from Shoildon Airport, a drive that took nearly forty minutes.



Inside the sprawling terminal, crowds of travelers bustled about.



Even among the masses, Verena's eyes landed on Gavin right away.



He was impossible to overlook, with his tall build and striking looks setting him apart As she walked from the entrance toward him, several young women attempted to draw his attention with admiring glances.



Gavin spotted her the moment she entered the hall,though one person after another approached him before he could move.



Just as he was about to head in Verena's direction,a blue-eyed blonde lady stopped him with a question.



Keeping his manners, Gavin remarked, "I'm sorry, but my friend is here to meet me. If you're trying to find the restroom, the staff can help you."



After speaking, he stepped past the lady and went directly toward Verena.



Verena cast a glance at the lady he had brushed off and teased, "It's been a while, but clearly you charm hasn't worn off."



Looking a little embarrassed, Gavin scratched his head and replied, "Evelyn, don't tease me like that."


Verena corrected him lightly, saying, "Here, just call me Dr. Willis."



Realizing he was a little shy, she chose not to tease him further. With a nod toward the exit, she said,"Come on, let's go. Didn't you promise me a meal?" Gavin arched a brow and replied, "Of course. You think I'd go back on my word? Let's go."



...


The Fortune Garden Restaurant ranked among the finest places in Shoildon, famed for its luxury and exclusivity, and often filled with the city's elite.



Without influence and deep pockets, an ordinary person would need half a year's pay just to afford a single drink there.



Outside, the entrance gleamed with a golden signboard, and a long red carpet extended thirty feet from the steps, lined with attendants greeting every guest.



A waiter guided them to a table reserved for them on the first floor.



Their seating was in the main hall, separated only by flower arrangements.



Gavin had hoped to secure a private room, but every one of them had already been booked.


Passing her handbag to the server, Verena looked at Gavin with a smile. "You've certainly gone big the moment you got back."

 Grinning broadly, Gavin replied, "Taking you out deserves nothing less, Dr. Willis."


Service moved swiftly in the upscale restaurant. As soon as a dish was set down, Gavin gestured toward it and said, "This one's their signature. Try it."


Lifting the serving spoon, Verena placed a portion of fish onto her plate and sampled it.


After nodding in approval, she remarked, "They've turned the fish into something delicate, free of any strong smell, yet rich in flavor. No wonder this place has such a name in Shoildon."



Then, as something came to mind, Verena asked, "By the way, are you done handling things over there?"


Gavin gave a shake of his head. "I managed most of it,but Julianna is finishing the rest."


With curiosity in her eyes, Verena asked, "So why did you come back so suddenly?"


Verena knew him too well; Gavin was never the type to leave things unfinished without a pressing reason.


Just as she had expected, he answered with sincerity,"There's someone here who matters a great deal to me. If I don't return now, I might lose my only chance."

 Her brow arched slightly, surprise flickering across her face for only an instant.



"So it's the girl in that photo you keep tucked in your wallet?" she asked.



That image was still clear in her mind; the girl looked sweet and innocent.



At the mention of the girl he admired, Gavin's features softened, and a rare gentleness settled over him.



He gave a small nod and admitted, "Yes. She's the one."


Turning the conversation back to her, Gavin asked,"And you? Word is you're marrying Mr. Bennett. You came back for him, didn't you? I remember how long he chased after you, and everyone thought it was hopeless. Looks like he finally won."


His words stirred memories of Isaac, who, despite constant doubt from others, had never stopped pursuing her and had given more than anyone else.



Her eyes grew tender without her even realizing it.



Without the slightest hesitation, Verena answered,"Yes. He's the reason I came back."



The thought of lsaac curved her lips into a gentle  smile, one that lit up her face with striking beauty.



Unaware of it herself, that glowing smile drew the gaze of a man seated on the second floor of the restaurant.



Isaac held his phone to his ear, listening to his secretary, though his eyes never left the sight below.


"Mr. Bennett, regarding the project..." his secretary remarked.



Isaac barely registered the words; all he noticed was Verena reaching over to fix the man's tie.



His lashes trembled as he swallowed the surge of bitterness, answering in a cold tone, "Some matters don't require you to check with me every time."



Ending the call abruptly, Isaac lowered the phone and set it aside.



From his place above, Isaac kept staring at the sight unfolding beneath him.



Across the table sat two figures, both youthful and striking in appearance.



Verena's radiant smile held such warmth and charm that Isaac found himself unable to turn away.



Across from her, the man carried himself with easy poise, his good looks enhanced by the cheer and confidence he projected.



Instead of continuing to watch, lsaac bent his head and seized his motionless legs with desperate force.



Though he urged his body to respond, no spark of feeling stirred in his legs.



What answered him instead was a sharp ache in his chest that refused to relent.



In that instant, Isaac understood just how wide the gulf was between himself and men who still stood whole.



To his eyes, Verena seemed to belong far more naturally at the side of that young man.



For a moment, he lifted his gaze, but it quickly sank again before he spun his chair and rolled away.



Overhead,the faint sound of wheels reached Verena's ears,instantly familiar.


With a fork in hand, she froze and lifted her head without thinking, her eyes sweeping the room.


Gavin noticed her distraction and asked, "Dr. Willis, did you just see someone you know?"



Finding no familiar face, Verena gave a small shake of  her head. "No. I thought I did, but | was wrong."


Her finger drifted toward Gavin's tie as she said,"Don't forget to give that tie back later."



The tie had once been lsaac's, and he had left it in her place.


It never crossed her mind that Gavin would arrive wearing it.



With a sheepish grin, Gavin explained, "Julianna told me to bring it for you. She said you needed it right away. I didn't have the space to pack it because I was rushing, so I decided to wear it instead."



Verena gave an exasperated roll of her eyes, thinking she had never met anyone quite so annoyingly straightforward.



Back inside the private room, lsaac listened as his business partner kept going on and on.



Instead of absorbing any of it, Isaac let the words slip past him.



No matter how hard he tried, his mind kept circling back to Verena, picturing her sharing laughter with that good-looking stranger at the table.



A sudden thought struck him-he, her fiancé, had never even shared a simple meal at the same table with Verena.



Admitting it to himself felt strange, but lsaac realized this unfamiliar ache in his chest was nearly driving him out of his mind.



Without thinking, he set his wine glass down with enough force to send a sharp clink ringing through the air.


Startled by the sudden noise, his business partner paused mid-sentence, worried he had overstepped after a few drinks and started to apologize.Before he could finish, Isaac interjected, "I'm sorry. There's something I need to take care of. Please excuse me for a bit."



Feeling a sudden urgency, lsaac grabbed his phone,opened the chat app, and tapped the contact pinned to the top of his chat list.



For a few moments, his fingers hovered above the screen, frozen. Then he finally typed a message,saying,"What are you doing right now,Verena?"


Just as she was halfway through her meal,Verena's phone buzzed with lsaac's message, and a mix of confusion and delight crossed her face.



Not once since his memory loss had he reached out like this, asking about her first. Setting her fork aside, Verena's lips curled into a smile as she responded, "I'm just having a meal."



Trusting in her honesty, lsaac found himself asking another question. "Who are you with?"


Phone in hand, Verena arched an eyebrow at the sudden burst of questions-especially the edge in his tone that didn't sound like him at all.


Unsure why he was acting so strangely,she frowned a little but still answered truthfully, "I'm with a friend."



Once she hit send, Verena waited but no new messages arrived from Isaac's side.


The silence left her baffled. Even though Isaac never said much in their chats, he was always the one who wrapped things up.



But this time, the conversation simply stopped with no word from him.



Remembering the faint echo of wheels rolling overhead earlier, Verena's eyebrow lifted in sudden realization.



Could it be that Isaac was in the same restaurant after all?


 
If that was true, it might explain why he was acting so of charaacter.



Without wasting a second, Verena turned to Gavin and said, "I'm really sorry, but something urgent just came up. Next time, let me know what your favorite dish is,and dinner's on me."



After grabbing the bag the server passed to her, she made her way upstairs in a rush.
###Chapter 41 You're The Only One | Choose
Gavin's eyes followed Verena's fading silhouette, his mind reeling. Was she truly walking away without another word?



Upstairs,the second floor held rows of private rooms,usually reserved for the wealthy and influential to hold their serious negotiations.



Once she climbed the stairs, Verena moved down the long corridor until her eyes landed on Isaac's assistant posted outside a door.



That sight confirmed it-Isaac was definitely inside.



Without hesitation, she quickened her steps toward the room.



The plush carpet absorbed the sharp click of her heels,rendering her footsteps nearly noiseless.



Not until Verena stood right at the doorway did the assistant finally notice her presence.



At once, he nodded in respect. "Miss Willis."



Then, he politely asked, "What brings you here?"
Offering only a small nod, Verena ignored his question and shifted her gaze toward the closed door. "Is Isaac inside?" she asked.



He confirmed with a nod. "Yes, Mr. Bennett is currently discussing a business deal with a partner."


Then he added cautiously, "Would you like me to let him know you're here?" | Choose scandal reporter."



Without hesitation, she added, "Go ahead and enjoy your food,then head home. Don't wait around for me.Think of this meal as my treat."



Almost at once, a simple OK emoji popped up on her screen.



Sliding her phone into her handbag, Verena patiently waited for the meeting inside to end.



Within the private room, the business associate checked his watch and realized their discussion had stretched close to four hours.



The atmosphere around lsaac carried such an oppressive weight that every passing minute felt longer than it was. At first, the negotiations had gone smoothly, but once Isaac stepped outside for a phone call and returned with a storm locked behind his eyes,the atmosphere never lifted. His reputation for being aloof and commanding suddenly felt understated-the pressure in the room bordered on suffocating.



At last, after offering one compromise after another,the man saw lsaac give a faint nod of approval. His endless persuasion throughout the afternoon had finally paid off.



Rising to his feet, the partner reached out for a handshake,which lsaac accepted with cold composure before responding evenly, "You may go now."



Taking the cue, the partner smiled politely. "In that case, I'll take my leave, Mr. Bennett."



Silence reclaimed the room, yet lsaac's mind refused to quiet. He kept replaying the image of Verena adjusting that man's tie.



Ties and belts-those were touches reserved for someone close, someone trusted. Even though Verena had clarified in the message that the man was a friend, and he warned himself not to read too much into it, the thought gnawed at him all the same.



With his head bowed, Isaac's eyes lingered on his useless legs, a shadow of ridicule flickering within. The man she had been with earlier was whole, strong,walking freely-everything Isaac no longer was.


While Isaac sank deeper into his thoughts, the quiet creak of the door breaking open drew his attention.



Believing it must be his assistant, Isaac didn't bother to look up, murmuring in a subdued tone, "Give me a little time alone."



Instead of the expected polite reply, a warm, melodic voice chimed in, "So even I'm not allowed to enter?"



That gentle tone carried both lightness and ease. A jolt ran through his spine, and a dull ache pressed at his temple.



Raising his head abruptly, he found Verena only a short distance away, her head slightly tilted as a playful smile curved her lips.



"How..." His voice caught, the word slipping out in disbelief.



For a moment it felt unreal, and he blinked to steady himself,half afraid she would vanish if he looked away."How did you even know I was here?" he asked at last.



"Well," Verena replied. Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she borrowed the very line he had once used while pursuing her. "Maybe I just felt it. You were thinking of me, weren't you? So of course I came."



Her playful words slipped out as naturally as breathing,yet each one stirred his chest like pebbles tossed into still water, unsettling his guarded calm. His jaw clenched,and an unfamiliar warmth rose to his cheeks.



"I..." The denial hovered on his tongue, yet he knew uttering it would betray the truth that she had indeed occupied his thoughts.



When Isaac didn't seem to remember this playful line he had once used, Verena felt no real disappointment,for she had prepared herself for this ever since his treatment began.



"Fine, I'll stop teasing you." Watching his silence stretch on, Verena's face brightened as she explained,"I actually came to clarify things. The man downstairs is both my assistant and my friend. He arrived back from overseas today, so I collected him from the airport, and we shared a meal together. And besides that..."



With a knowing smile, she looked directly at Isaac and added, "He returned because of the woman he loves.So please don't misread the situation, or else he might refuse to come to our wedding."



When Isaac realized Verena had sought him out just to clear things up, it was as if fireworks burst inside his chest, chasing away every shadow of doubt. The weight pressing on him disappeared, leaving behind a joy so fierce he struggled to contain it. Yet with her sincere gaze on him,he found himself unable to show that happiness openly.



He swallowed hard and turned his head to the side,holding firm as he murmured, "I didn't misunderstand anything."



He couldn't-he simply couldn't let his emotions slip through.



"Is that so?" Verena arched a brow at his awkward and then chose to humor him with a soft reply."That's fine then."



Quiet settled over the room, and once more Isaac let his eyes fall to the floor.



The hush was broken by the sound of light footsteps steadily nearing him.



Before he even raised his head, gleaming silver stilettos came into view against the ornate red carpet beneath him.



Verena halted before him, lowered herself to her knees, and guided his hand to her cheek with gentle intention.



"It doesn't matter if you misunderstood or not," she whispered. "I explained because I want you to understand that no matter how impressive someone else might seem, they mean nothing to me. You are the only one I choose, and I couldn't bear the thought of you being hurt by jealousy or sorrow."



The softness in her voice carried the patience of someone calming a sorrowful child, and at times her cheek brushed lightly against his hand.



To Isaac, it felt as though she was shattering every unspoken boundary, for who could lace such tender sweetness into words spoken with such innocence? A lump rose in his throat, and faint moisture shimmered in his eyes.



Again and again his lips moved without sound, and at last all he managed was a faint nod in silence.


From the look in his eyes, Verena understood that every word she had spoken had settled deep within him.







Upon arriving back at the Willis Villa, Verena slid her car into the garage, and the moment she entered the living room, Kaia's voice rang out to meet her.


"I'm honestly amazed. Who would've thought my dear sister kept such surprising talents tucked away?"Kaia remarked, letting every word drip with sarcasm.



Experience told Verena that whenever Kaia came looking for her, trouble usually followed. Wanting no part of it today, she moved to pass by, but Kaia stretched out her arm to block the way.



Verena turned toward Kaia,her brow pulling tight



Losing wasn't something Kaia ever liked to own up to,least of all when Verena was watching



Meeting Verena's steady stare, Kaia responded with a frown of her own.



Kaia had no idea that her baby-faced looks didn't carry the weight that Verena's calm,sculpted features did, and the fierce look she tried to pull off ended up looking more silly than serious.
###Chapter 42 Have You Been Following Me
Verena fixed Kaia with a cool gaze, her tone indifferent. "If you've something to say, say it plainly.I've no patience to waste time circling words with you."



Kaia folded her arms, her eyes cutting sideways like a blade, a sneer curling her lips. "No patience for me,yet you suddenly find boundless energy for private talks with another man?"



"What exactly are you suggesting?" Verena's tone stayed steady, as if untouched by Kaia's provocation.


Kaia could not stomach Verena's aloofness-always so distant, always carrying herself as if the world could not touch her.



With a sharp motion, she pulled out her phone and thrust it forward, showing Verena a photo sent by a friend who had spotted her at a restaurant.



"Verena, you play your cards well. One hand engaged to lsaac, and the other hand holding secret meetings with a man-smiling, chatting, looking far too comfortable."



Her smugness lit her face like a cruel lantern. "Tell me,

 if lsaac saw this photo, would he still cherish the thought of marrying a woman so false-hearted? With his position, do you think he'd stomach betrayal?"



Verena took the phone and glanced at the photo-her and Gavin, seated together. The angle was cunning, capturing them as if they were a young couple on a tender date, laughter shared without restraint.



She had already clarified things with Isaac. What gnawed at her was how Kaia had come to possess such a photo.



"Have you been following me?"



At the frost in Verena's gaze, Kaia shivered despite herself.


Snatching her phone back, she crossed her arms, and then stepped closer, her face twisted with defiance.


"So what if I did? If your conscience is clear,why tremble? This time, my friend simply happened upon you whispering sweet nothings with another man. But I'd wager you've been roaming about with plenty of them, haven't you? Hah-just as Mom says, that old hag from your backwater roots truly ruined you-"



Her words cracked off mid-sentence, for a sharp slap resounded, striking her cheek and leaving a vivid red mark. Kaia's eyes flew wide in disbelief.



"You... you actually dared to hit me?" Her chest heaved, fury blazing. "That old hag-"



Another slap split her lip before she could finish.



Clutching her burning cheek, Kaia staggered, utterly provoked. "That old hag, that old hag-"


Two more slaps rang out, each echoing through the living room like thunderclaps.


The force nearly toppled her, but before she fell, a hand seized her collar.



Verena dragged her close, brow furrowed, eyes sharp as steel. "Kaia Willis, hate me all you want-I don't care."



Her voice dropped, colder still. "But hear me well: my grandmother is not yours to scorn. Speak one more word against her, and each time I'll strike without hesitation."



With that, Verena shoved Kaia hard, sending her sprawling to the floor. "Don't test me again."


Even after, there was no relief in her chest. She turned from Kaia and climbed the stairs in haste.



Shawna had carried her worries for Kaia and Luka even  to her deathbed. What a bitter fate, to be burdened with such ungrateful kin.



Kaia sat crumpled on the floor, her cheek aflame,tears brimming as she stared up at Verena's retreating figure. Anger boiled within her, shaking her body,yet fear crept beneath it. Verena's cold mask had cracked,revealing something fierce, almost unhinged.



It was not that Kaia had not thought to strike back;but Verena's grip had been iron,leaving no chance.


Her fists clenched tight, hatred blazing. So what if Verena turned mad? In their parents' hearts, Kaia told herself,she would always outweigh her.


That evening, Alec and Laura returned from the company to find their beloved daughter greeting them with a swollen face.



At the sight, Alec's brows drew together.



Laura rushed over, her eyes wet with worry.	 heavens,Kaia,what happened to your face?"



"Mom,it was Verena..." Kaia bit her lip, shoulders trembling as tears streamed. "I spoke a few words when she came home. She claimed I meddled where I shouldn't, and then struck me again and again before shoving me to the floor."



Her sobs were pitiful, her voice woven with grievance "Verena?" Alec frowned,doubtful.


In his eyes, Verena had always been the quiet one never the sort to throw her weight about.


Seeing the hesitation, Kaia pressed on, her voice pleading. "Dad, it was truly her. Go upstairs and ask her yourself if you doubt me."



Tonight, she was determined-Verena would pay. Her parents had always cradled her in affection. Surely,they would not let her be wronged in silence.


But Kaia misjudged. Alec, seasoned by years of business, had his eyes on the larger game. Even if Verena had struck Kaia, she was about to enter the Bennett family through marriage. Trouble now would be poison in the well.


His voice came low, reluctant. "Verena's wedding with Isaac is at hand. Let's leave this matter for another time."



"So what if she marries Isaac?" Laura cut in, her face drawn with disdain. "I care nothing for the Bennett family's backing! Today, she dared raise her hand against Kaia in this very house, spitting on us all. Such insolence cannot go unanswered!"



Her fury boiled over; thoughts of currying favor with the Bennetts vanished like mist. All she wished was to storm upstairs and remind Verena who truly ruled this household. Verena's conduct had long been a thorn in her side, fueling a steady undercurrent of dissatisfaction.



Laura made to ascend, but Alec caught her arm.



Though his heart ached for Kaia, his mind weighed interests more heavily. He had not thrived in business by letting anger steer the ship.



He exhaled deeply. "Remember our alliance with the Bennett family through marriage. Verena's wedding is too near. Stirring conflict now would only sow weeds in our own path. The fewer storms,the better."



"Hmph, the Bennett family?" Laura sneered, voice dripping scorn. "Yes, we need their support, but don't fool yourself-Danica despises us. Were it not for Isaac's crippled legs, our family would never have had this chance. Do you think we'd be chosen otherwise?"



Her gaze shifted to Kaia, softening with pride. "With Kaia,we are hardly grasping at straws. She has already won the favor of the Lyons family-she healed Barrie Lyons' leg with her herbs and supplements. Their family may not rival the Bennetts outright, but they are close. To the Bennetts, we are beggars; to the Lyons family, Kaia is a benefactor. Now, tell me,which is the wiser path?"
 ###Chapter 43 Severing Ties
Laura gently clasped Kaia's hand. With a soft determination in her voice, she said, "Kaia, you don't need to be afraid. I'll make sure your pain means something."


Alec blinked in shock. "What did I just hear? Are you seriously talking about Barrie Lyons from Shoildon?"


Tilting her chin with quiet pride, Laura replied, "Who else besides the influential Lyons family could deserve Kaia's talent?"



Alec dropped his gaze to the floor and sank into thought.



Rumors from countless business events drifted back to him. Everyone knew Barrie's leg injury had left him nearly crippled.



Living with such relentless agony in old age was nothing short of tragic.



Yet somehow,Kaia had managed to restore him?



The Lyons family's reputation for paying back favors was legendary.


If Barrie's suffering had finally ended because of Kaia  the Willis family would stand to gain more than anyone could imagine.


That realization settled over Alec, and he finally loosened his grip on Laura's arm.



Just as Laura started toward the staircase, Alec called out, "Verena deserves to be punished, yes. But don't go overboard. The Bennett family may not hold the same weight for us later on, but it would be foolish to turn them into enemies."



Only a couple of dismissive grunts left Laura in response.



Dragging Kaia with her, she marched straight up to the third floor. Outside Verena's room, she pounded hard against the door.



"Verena! Come out here right now!"


Inside, Verena froze at the sound. She already knew Laura was coming to punish her for Kaia's sake.



The door swung open, and Laura's hand immediately slashed through the air in an attempt to strike.



Verena's reflexes took over. She caught Laura's arm and shoved it aside.



Unfazed,Laura swung again with her other hand, only to have Verena block the attack a second time. Still unwilling to give in, Laura lifted her arm for another blow. But this time, Verena seized her wrist,twisted sharply, and forced her into a lock that stopped her cold.


Laura's voice broke into a pained cry. "Let go of me!l said let go right now!"


At last, Verena loosened her hold and fixed her mother with a blank stare. "Tell me, what is it you really want?"



Kaia rushed to Laura's side and clutched her hand, her eyes darting to the red welt forming on her wrist.


"Mom, are you hurt?" she asked anxiously.


Rage burned hotter in Laura's chest than the sting in her arm, the defiance mattering far more than the mark.



She leveled a hateful glare at Verena. "Shameless girl!It wasn't enough for you to torment your sister; now you dare strike at your own mother?"


Verena's gaze didn't waver. "You came at me swinging without cause. Should I just stand still and take the blows?"



Laura gave a bitter laugh. "Don't forget who l am.l gave you life. If I decide to discipline you, then you 
have no choice but to accept it."



For a mother to speak such words to her child was almost beyond belief.



A faint tremor passed through Verena's lashes, and then her lips curled into a cold smile. "If that's how it is, stop calling me your daughter. I never once saw you as a mother anyway."



The defiance cut Laura like a blade.



She drew in a deep breath and gave a sharp nod. "So be it. If you refuse to recognize me, then I'll cast you off myself. From this moment on, you are no longer my daughter. Pack your things and get out of this house!"



Her hand thrust toward the stairs, her eyes glinting with icy disdain, untouched by grief or regret.



Get out? Verena let out a short, mocking laugh.


This house had never carried the warmth of a home for her anyway.



She strode past them without hesitation and spoke over her shoulder. "If we're breaking ties, let's make it absolute.From today, you are not my mother, and | am not your daughter. Remember this, Mrs. Willis-whatever I achieve in the future belongs to me alone.The Willis family has no claim on it." What Laura had truly wanted was a daughter who bowed her head.



There was something about the way Verena held herself that turned Laura's stomach.



As she listened to her speak, Laura couldn't hear anything but pride swelling in a voice that hadn't earned it.



She couldn't believe that Verena dared to talk about achievement in the future and warn them not to claim on it. If Verena hadn't been born as her daughter, she wouldn't be standing there at all, wrapped in privilege that was never really hers to claim.



In Laura's eyes, it was because of her upcoming wedding with Isaac that Verena dared to talk like that.



Pushed past the edge of reason, Laura retorted, "The Bennett family wants a daughter from the Willis family.You're not mine, so stop dreaming about marrying into that family."



Beside Laura, Kaia stood stunned. She hadn't believed Laura would actually cut Verena off at such a decisive moment.



A quiet smile tugged at Kaia's lips nonetheless,for this was exactly the outcome she had long desired. Now, Verena was no longer a rival for affection,no longer a daughter of the Willis family, and most importantly, no longer a candidate to marry lsaac.



Her wish was fulfilled.



The sound of Laura's frigid words trailed after Verena,halting her steps and drawing a dry laugh from her throat.



Laura seemed convinced that stripping her of status and denying her a marriage into a wealthy clan was the sharpest blow she could deal.



Yet Laura had never truly understood her daughter's heart.



Verena turned with a cold expression. "All right then.But don't fool yourself into thinking the Bennett family are yours to manipulate. When the consequences come, you won't be able to shoulder them. I'll be watching when it happens."



Neither Laura's glare nor Kaia's shocked face slowed her. She walked out firmly, without glancing back.



Kaia's mouth fell open. She had expected begging,perhaps desperate pleas for forgiveness, not this calm rejection.



In Shoildon, countless women longed to marry into the Bennett family, yet few had the chance.



Verena might've had a pleasant face, but without influence or real ability, women like her had no place standing beside a family as prominent as the Bennett family.



Becoming Isaac's bride as the daughter of the Willis family was the best thing that had ever happened to her.



And yet, Verena just let it go-no sorrow, no hesitation,nothing at all?



Neither Kaia nor Laura could stomach the way Verena carried herself, as though she were somehow above them both.



Confusion flickered across Kaia's face, while Laura's eyes remained fixed in disbelief at the spot where Verena had disappeared.



In her mind, Verena should have been nervous,maybe even desperate, instead of leaving with such ease and composure.



That very expectation had driven Laura to threaten her.



Yet the reply she had received left Laura feeling, if only for an instant, like the tables had turned and she was the one standing on uncertain ground. By the look on Laura's face, Kaia understood her mother hadn't truly meant to sever ties; the threat had been meant to intimidate, not finalize.



Verena, however, held too much pride, and unless Laura reached out to mend things, there was no chance she would ever agree to a marriage with the Bennett family.



Afraid Laura might later regret her words and try to smooth things over, Kaia chimed in quickly, "Mom,don't take her too seriously. She's probably just lashing out in anger. There's no way she would actually throw away the chance to marry into the Bennett family."



The thought gave Laura pause, but soon she nodded.After all, who would willingly give up such a good marriage?



A sharp snort escaped her. "That girl is stubborn to the bone. Let's see how long she pretends to stand firm."



To Laura, Verena's defiance was nothing more than a performance she expected to collapse in time.

###Chapter 44 She'll Crawl Back Before Long
As Verena walked down the staircase and crossed the living room, Alec stopped her with a call of her name."Verena!"



When she turned back, her face showed no expression as she stood waiting for his words.



Verena understood that Laura had only been able to come upstairs and confront her because Alec had allowed it.



If that had not been the case, he would not have stayed seated earlier while the commotion went on upstairs.



The realization left her with a bitter sense of irony.


For a time, she had believed Alec might be the only one in the family who still showed her some regard,even if it was out of his sense of guilt.


Feeling guilty,she believed,would have meant that he cared in some small way.


Now she saw that her thoughts had only been wishful assumptions. Alec rose from his seat and stepped closer, noticing that while her face stayed calm, her eyes carried both sadness and disappointment.



The expression struck him with a force he hadn't expected.



With sudden panic creeping into his chest, Alec asked in haste, "Verena, it's already late. Where are you planning to go?"



The tenderness in his tone gave the impression of a father speaking out of deepconcern for his child.



For a fleeting moment,Verena nearly allowed herself to believe it.



The false calm in Alec's manner only deepened the irony pressing against her.


With steady eyes fixed on him, Verena spoke with deliberate clarity. "Alec Willis, beginning today,you and Laura Willis are no longer my parents. Wherever l choose to go will never concern either of you."


Her clear gaze carried a cold sharpness, though a faint crease appeared between her brows.



Alec paid no attention to the change in her expression,for the weight of her words had already shaken him. For Verena to cut ties so firmly, Alec could only assume that Laura had spoken far too harshly upstairs.



No matter if Verena's actions came from sudden defiance or a real attempt to escape, Alec knew he could not afford a single misstep during the critical Bennett family alliance.



"Did your mother speak too cruelly to you?"



"So you knew she went upstairs to stir up trouble for me? I was under the impression you didn't."



With a sharp glance, Verena added, "The two of you as parents make me sick. If I had any choice in the matter, I would have never wanted to belong to this family."



Her words left Alec shaken to his very core, his body rooted in stunned silence as he watched Verena walking out of the lavish villa.


Coming to his senses, he rushed forward to the door and called out after her, "Verena, wait..."



From the staircase came a voice asking, "Why are you running after her?"



When Alec turned, he saw Laura and Kaia making their way down the steps. With arms folded and anger etched on her face, Laura walked toward him.



"Let her leave. Don't stop her," Laura said coldly toward the door. "I want to see just how far she'll manage without us behind her."



Alec felt frustration build at Laura's cold indifference.



Though he agreed Verena's stubbornness needed discipline, he never intended for Laura to drive away the Bennett family's future daughter-in-law without weighing the consequences.



With his face darkened, Alec asked Laura sharply, "I told you only to discipline her lightly. What did you say to Verena that pushed her to leave?"



Noticing Alec leaning toward Verena's side, Laura turned her anger onto him.



"She told me outright that she doesn't recognize me as her mother, so why blame me for her walking away?"



Laura's frown deepened, and her voice sharpened as she snapped, "Your eldest daughter is something else,Alec. She bullies Kaia and even had the audacity to strike me, her own mother. Truly, you must be proud of the child you brought up."


Catching Alec's inclination to defend Verena, Kaia hurried to nod in support. "It's true, Dad. Verena shows no respect for Mom. All Mom did upstairs was say a few words to correct her, and Verena twisted her hand right away. Look for yourself."



Kaia lifted Laura's wrist toward Alec, presenting it like a silent accusation.



When his eyes dropped, a vivid red mark stood out against Laura's wrist.


The faint crease on his brow gave Kaia her chance,and she sniffled theatrically before crying out,"It's bad enough that Verena bullies me, but to treat Mom this way is unforgivable!"



Laura's anger eased at her younger daughter's show of loyalty, and she stroked Kaia's hair with approval."You truly do think of me, Kaia."



Alec's eyes lingered on the mark, and the silence stretched heavy between them.



It had never crossed his mind that Verena would defy her parents so openly.


Laura, encouraged by Alec's silence, added, "I told her clearly that if she denies me as her mother, then I'll deny her as my daughter. From now on she has no ties to the Willis family, and she can forget about marrying into the Bennett family." Alec's temper flared the moment Laura brushed things off with her stubborn attitude.



Pointing at her in frustration, he could barely force out a word. "You... you..."


His chest rose and fell heavily as he glared at her."Haven't I warned you over and over? We can't afford any trouble with Verena and the Bennett family.You went and scolded her. What happens if she really refuses the marriage arrangement? How do we explain that to the Bennett family?"



The alliance promised great rewards, but a single misstep at this stage would give the Bennett family every reason to turn against them.


Kaia shrank back quickly, startled by the sudden fury in her father's tone. She had never witnessed him this enraged.



Laura flinched at first, her shoulders drawing in, but she quickly lifted her head high and let out a mocking laugh. "Do you honestly believe she has that kind of strength? She followed us from Trisas to Shoildon because she wanted to rise above he place in life, to shed her insignificance and turn herself into a woman of society. Without the Willis family behind her, she is nothing, and she can forget about ever marrying into wealth. Don't trouble yourself. This is only her rash temper speaking, and she will crawl back before long After what she did to Kaia and me, do I not have every right to vent my anger?"


Alec considered what she said, and it began to sound convincing.



To the Bennett family, Verena's standing in society mattered far more than who she really was.


If marrying into wealth was truly her goal, she would never dare to run away and cut ties.


Accepting that logic, Alec let Verena go without chasing her.


In the end, he believed it was only a matter of time before she came back.







Instead of driving away, Verena left the Willis Villa on foot because the car sitting in the garage had been a gift from Alec.



She refused to keep anything that tied her to the Willis family.


The villa stood in a secluded part of town, and at that hour, there wasn't a single car she could hail.


After a brief pause to think, Verena pulled out her phone and called Gavin. Three rings passed before the line clicked.


"Dr. WNillis, what do you need?" Gavin's voice came steady through the receiver.


Her tone dropped to something faint and weary."D you have time right now?"


Her weary tone pressed on him so heavily that Gavin answered at once, "Yes, I do."


She let out a quiet hum before asking, "Can you come get me and take me to a hotel?"



He didn't hesitate. "Of course. Just text me the address, and I'll head over."



A small smile broke across her face as she thanked him.Once the call ended, she shared her location.
###Chapter 45 | Miss You
While she lingered at the roadside, waiting for Gavin,Verena felt a dampness on her cheek.


She reached up to touch her face, only to feel water sliding down the back of her neck.


What began as a light mist quickly swelled into fat drops that smacked the ground in sharp bursts.


With nothing but open space around her, there was no protection from the storm.


The scene struck her as almost laughable, like a plot pulled straight from a soap opera.


Looking up at the dark sky, she let out a small laugh at her own thoughts and murmured, "I'm really not shattered over this. Ever since Kaia came into the world, I've known I wasn't the one who mattered most,so I've been bracing for moments like this. Don't try to twist it into something dramatic, understood? The rain's coming down so hard my clothes are already drenched."



A set of headlights finally cut through the downpour,and Gavin's car rolled to a stop. He stepped out holding an umbrella and made his way toward her.



His face showed regret the instant he saw how soaked she was. "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting."



She smiled faintly and gave her head a quick shake."No. You got here just when I needed you."



Once she climbed into the car, Gavin circled around to the driver's side.



With a half-hearted smile, she said quietly, "I'm afraid I'm about to ruin your seat."



Noticing how forced her expression seemed, Gavin chose his words with care. "You look... sad.Something's bothering you, isn't it?"



Her lips curved at his careful tone, and she answered with a shake of her head, "It's not worth worrying about. I saw it coming, and they aren't worth my tears."


The steady way she spoke made Gavin think that whatever loneliness he thought he had sensed earlier was only his imagination.



He could sense deep down that the situation carried more weight than it appeared.


Rather than press her, he shifted the topic and asked, "Did you book a hotel room?"


Verena's head moved in a slow shake. "Take me to the one you're staying at."


Gavin's lips pressed together in a small nod. "Okay."


Turning the wheel, he guided the car forward, and the tires cut through the rain-soaked night.



The storm eased off quickly, and by the time they arrived at the hotel, the rain had stopped.



At the front desk, Gavin secured a suite, and then placed the key in Verena's hand as he walked her to the door.



After thinking for a moment, he suggested, "How about I buy you a drink?"


With her chest feeling tight, Verena gave him a soft smile. "Alright."



He called the front desk and placed the order for drinks,and soon they were delivered.


Even though the idea had been his, Verena was the one who drank far more than he did.



From the moment they settled in, she kept quiet,lifting glass after glass without a word. Before long, she abandoned the glass entirely and drank straight from the bottle.



As Gavin watched her drown herself so recklessly, he wanted to intervene but held back.



Once the final bottle ran empty, he sprang up and pulled it from her grasp. "That's enough. Go shower and get some rest."



He then called room service to clear away the bottles and glasses before making his way out.



The soft click of the door closing left the room in silence.



On the floor, Verena leaned against the sofa with her cheeks burning red.



There was no mistaking it-she was drunk.



Her mind,before the alcohol dulled it, kept circling back to Luka's hateful stare, Kaia's endless schemes both open and hidden, Laura's cutting voice, and Alec's shallow imitation of a father's love.



Why did the people who should have been her greatest support care the least?


She yearned, just like anyone else, for the tenderness of parents and the steady comfort of family.

 Sadly, the only person who had given her true love had already passed away.



And the one who once held her close had since let her fade from memory.



Once the liquor began to cloud her head,Shawna and that man became the only figures she could think of.



Isaac...


Out of nowhere, the ache of missing lsaac pressed heavily on her.



She felt an urgent need to see him right away.



Acting decisively and quickly had always been her way,and even drunk, she clung to that instinct.



Her fingers stumbled across the table until they reached her phone, where she scrolled to lsaac's name and pressed to call.


The line rang again and again with no answer, but she stayed on the call, unwilling to give up.


Over at the Bennett Group offices, the building had emptied out, except for the light still glowing in the CEO's office.



At his desk,Isaac continued working, his hands flying over the keyboard as he dealt with company affairs. Just outside, his assistant waited at the doorway,fully aware that lsaac often lost all sense of time when buried in work.



Isaac didn't like being interrupted when he was working, and the assistant was well aware of that. Still,the phone kept ringing without a break, and eventually,the assistant couldn't ignore it any longer.



He paused at the entrance, eyes fixed on the name flashing across the phone screen, fingers curling tight at his side. After a moment's silence, he knocked twice and stepped inside.



Isaac didn't look up right away. When he did, his expression was hard, his eyes sharp. "What is it?" he asked.



The assistant stepped forward holding the phone. "Mr.Bennett, Miss Verena Willis has been calling repeatedly,so..."



As soon as the name "Miss Verena Willis" reached his ears, Isaac stretched out his hand to take the phone."Why didn't you hand it over sooner?"



There was a brief pause before the assistant answered,"You once told me you dislike interruptions while you're working."


That was true; Isaac had made that clear before. Without another word, he accepted the call from Verena.



Before he could speak, a gentle female voice drifted through. "Isaac, I miss you."


Soft and slightly nasal, the voice clung to him like a kitten in need of affection. The sound stopped him cold, and color rose along his cheeks.



A slight tremor passed through his hand, and for a second the phone nearly slipped before he caught it again.



With the office wrapped in silence, the assistant at his desk heard Verena's voice clearly.



The words startled him, for the Verena he recalled had always carried hersef with cool elegance.



That she could sound so tender in private was something he had never imagined.



Seeing his assistant's distracted expression, Isaac pressed his lips into a line, covered the receiver, and said,"Leave now."



Realizing he had overstepped, the assistant hurried out and closed the door behind him.



When the door clicked shut, Isaac uncovered the receiver again.



Verena's faint murmur continued, repeating the same phrase over and over.



For a moment, Isaac's thoughts stalled; this was not the woman he was used to.



Normally,she would never act in such a way.



Quietly,he asked, "Verena, what's happening with you?"


Her reply came with a girlish giggle. "Isaac, I really miss you... I'm sitting alone in a hotel room; will you come and be with me?"



Her words dragged slightly, slurred with drink, yet laced with playful sweetness.



A tight swallow moved through Isaac's throat twice.



Never before had he witnessed her with so little guard around her.



Oddly enough, the sensation of being needed by her brought a quiet sense of satisfaction.



Lowering his eyes, Isaac's lashes quivered faintly as he replied,"Fine."



Once the call ended, he gave orders to his assistant to have a car made ready Meanwhile, Verena forwarded the hotel's address and,for the first timne that evening, thought to freshen herself up.


She slipped out of the damp clothes clinging to her body and stepped beneath the shower spray.


When she finished drying off, she pulled on the bathrobe provided by the hotel.


Her head swam with dizziness, the alcohol heavy in her body, though her mind stayed sober.


And like many who drank too much, a reckless boldness stirred within her.



Verena had barely settled onto the bed when the sound of the doorbell reached her ears.

###Chapter 46 Sleep Beside Me Tonight
Isaac reached the floor where Verena was staying,instructing his assistant to remain downstairs while he rolled toward the door whose number she had sent him.



The moment he pressed the doorbell, it swung open from within.


The first thing that caught his eyes was a pair of long,slender legs.


Isaac froze, and then slowly lifted his gaze to find Verena leaning lazily against the doorframe, wrapped in a bathrobe.



Her cheeks were tinted with a faint flush,softening her usually cool demeanor with an almost dangerous allure.



The air was heavy with the scent of alcohol.


In that instant, Isaac realized things might not be as romantic as he had pictured in his mind.


His brows drew together, his voice carrying concern he himself barely noticed. "Verena, what happened to you?" Worry shone clearly in his eyes, but she only smiled lightly. "Come in first, and I'll tell you."



Her tone was gentle, her voice almost syrupy.



Isaac didn't care about keeping any distance; it felt as though he were under her spell as he maneuvered his wheelchair into the room.



With a soft click, VVerena shut the door, and then turned and promptly seated herself on Isaac's lap.



Startled, Isaac stiffened, instinctively trying to push her to her feet.



Yet she looped her arms around his neck, pressing a finger against his lips. "Shh. Don't ask about that now,alright?"



Her slightly hazy eyes melted away the last of his resolve.


In a quiet voice, he asked, "Then... what do you want to talk about?"



"What should we talk about..." She seemed to truly think it over, her gaze roaming across his face before it lingered on his thin lips.



Her mouth curved into a sly smile as her finger trailed from his lips down to his chin, tipping it up."How about flirting with you?"



Her playful tone, sweet and teasing, brushed against his ears as her warm breath fanned his cheek.



Isaac was certain she was drunk.



Verena squinted at him, noticing the flush creeping over his ears.



As though she had uncovered some delightful secret,she teased softly, "Do you want to know how I'll flirt with you?"



Before lsaac could muster an answer, she leaned closer, whispering, "Your ears are red."



Then,with parted lips, she captured his heated earlobe,her damp tongue gliding across it.


Isaac's arm muscles twitched uncontrollably,his hands clutching the wheelchair's armrests in a desperate bid for restraint.



The sensation of her moist lips, the warmth of her breath, and the delicate fragrance clinging to her freshly bathed skin collided all at once against his nerves.



He tipped his head back, taking a deep breath as though wrestling with the tide rising within him. But Verena wasn't satisfied. Once upon a time,a single kiss from her would have sent him reeling with joy.


With mischief in her eyes, she cupped his face, turned it toward her, and brushed her lips against his.


A feather's touch.



Isaac's heart pounded in disarray, his eyes darkening with emotion. "Verena,you're drunk."



She pressed herself tightly against his chest. If she were sober, she might have heard the thunderous chaos of his heartbeat.



"Really, Isaac?" Verena murmured, her head sinking onto his shoulder. "I've teased you so much, yet you won't react. My heart might just shatter."



Her voice was husky, threaded with tenderness,carrying his name like a plea.



"Verena, could you please get up?" he asked,shifting uncomfortably.



Her hair brushed against his Adam's apple, sending an involuntary shiver through him.



"Alright," she agreed softly.



Isaac blinked in surprise, not expecting her to comply so easily. When he looked at her, she tilted her head back, smiling faintly. "Let's go to bed together. I'll help you in,and youI can sleep beside me tonight, alright?"


Sleep beside her...


With her drunken smile and dreamy eyes locked on his,Isaac's brows furrowed. He placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and reminded her, "Do you even know what you're saying? I am not like other men."



It was as much a reminder to her as it was to himself.



His gaze clung to her, shadowed by complex emotions and a touch of melancholy.


She was so perfect, yet he felt like a hollow shell. His legs were still unhealed, his body betrayed by dysfunction, and the road to recovery was uncertain.How could he dare hope?



Sensing the sorrow flickering in his eyes, Verena pressed her finger gently over his lips. "Isaac, I won't allow you to speak of yourself that way, nor will I let you belittle my abilities."



She leaned her forehead against his, smiling with quiet certainty. "I promised to heal you-every part of your body."



Her words carried a sharper meaning, sinking deeper.


Isaac stared at her radiant smile, and, as always, herpresence lit up the shadows clouding him. His gaze lingered; their closeness left him suddenly aware that her white bathrobe had slipped from her shoulders baring smooth, delicate skin.



The sight was laid bare before him.



He quickly turned his face aside, leaning back as if to retreat-only tocollide with the crescent-moon curve of her eyes. She smiled impishly, like a sprite caught mid-trick.



Verena continued to hold his gaze, unwavering.



The silence grew thick, the air pulsing with sparks of unspoken tension.



Then,lowering her head, she twined her arms tightly around his neck and pressed her lips to his. This time it was no fleeting brush. She nibbled, sucked, and kissed with heated persistence. It was exactly the way Isaac used to love.



Her sudden fervor left Isaac reeling, fearing he might be swept away. Yet the sweetness on his tongue filled his mind with joy so pure it felt like a rare gift-hers alone.



All reason slipped away



He was no longer passive. One hand cradled her head the other locked around her slender waist, tightening as he deepened the kiss.



Verena was taken aback, pulling back to speak, only for him to chase her lips instantly.



"Mmm-"



This was no gentle peck; it burned with passion



Though it was hard to keep up, Verena reveled in the familiar heat.



It was as if lsaac had never lost his memory.



The kiss deepened, his lips prying hers apart with a hunger that demanded surrender.



She tilted her head back, responding with equal fire.



In the hushed room, the sound of their kisses rang out.



Bodies pressed close, breaths tangled,as though they wished to fuse into one.




...



The night ebbed away.



When Verena's eyes fluttered open, vision clearing,a dull headache from drink throbbed at her temples.She turned over-and there lay a handsome face beside her.

###Chapter 47 Come Over At Any Time
Verena could hold her liquor well; not a single memory from the night before had slipped away.


In the end, it was she who had helped Isaac onto the bed.



When sleep claimed him, he looked unlike the man he usually was.


The tightness in his brows loosened, his breathing steady as the tide.


At rest,his face carried an air of warmth, as if he were someone easy to approach. But in truth, he never was.



Verena studied his features, her eyes gentle and clear as water.



She leaned her chin on her palm, her fingers slowly tracing the arch of his brow, gliding down to his high nose bridge, finally coming to rest on his firm,straight lips.


Isaac stirred awake, his lashes lifting to the sight of Verena's luminous face-bare of makeup, yet strikingly beautiful. Her head was slightly lowered, her fingertip brushing against his lips, as though... she was about to lean in and kiss him.



A softness appeared in Isaac's gaze. He tilted his head forward,wishing to close the distance between them.



But Verena suddenly whispered, "Isaac, I can't marry you."



His body stilled. His lashes quivered as if caught in a storm.



He parted his lips to speak, but no sound emerged.The silence pressed on his chest like a boulder,making it hard to breathe.



For the first time, lsaac tasted what it meant to be struck by a cruel revelation.



Was it because of his condition?



Because he was not like other men?



Because he had failed to give her what she wanted last night?



Catching the flicker of anguish in his eyes, Verena knew immediately he had misunderstood.


She hurried to explain, "Yesterday, I quarreled with my mother." At her words, the storm in Isaac's expression calmed a little. "She was partial to my sister and lashed out at me without reason. I fought back. Then she furiously declared I was no longer her daughter and cast me out of the Willis family. Your family wants the daughter of the Willis family. But I'm not that anymore,so I can't marry you as such."



Isaac's brows knitted tightly as he asked, voice tinged with urgency, "Were you hurt?"



Verena smiled faintly and shook her head. "No. She didn't succeed. I twisted her wrist, though-it turned red."



Even after such treatment from her own mother, she could still summon a smile.



It was a calm too brittle, a facade anyone could see through.



Watching her, Isaac felt a stab of pain and an urge to gather her into his arms.



"Isaac," Verena called softly.



"Yes?" he responded, his tone gentle.



"I never lied to you," she said, her voice quiet yet steady. "Before our first meeting, Laura thought | was a disgrace from the rural backwater. She told me to pretend I was a graduate from Acorith College of Medicine. But I told you all the truth-that I had graduated from Pine Hill University. None of you believed me. On the way back, Laura scolded me,saying | overreached. But the truth is, I really did graduate from Pine Hill University. It's normal if strangers doubt me, but even my parents don't know."



Isaac's mind drifted back to their first meeting.



She had sat at the dining table, declaring her truth with steady eyes. He had believed her then-those eyes left no room for deceit.



Instead of interrupting her, he just stayed silent,knowing she needed to say it all aloud.


Verena gave a bitter laugh. "Isn't it ironic? She's my biological mother, yet she knows nothing about me.Kaia, the daughter she adores, got into Acorith College of Medicine, and Laura treasures her like gold.But my studies? She never cared. Once, when I was a child, I caught a high fever and missed two of the exams, and my results slipped. From then on, they branded me as hopeless. They never asked again.They thought I didn't even take the college entrance exam. But the truth is, I had already been admitted early to Pine Hill University. They never knew-never bothered to know. My likes, my schooling, even whom I care for-they remain blind to it all. Yet Kaia's every move is known. As for Luka, they treat him as their pride and heir. Only me... I've always been invisible."


Her words struck lsaac like a knife, his heart aching with every syllable.



"My grandmother Shawna raised me. She alone cared.But she has passed on." Tears welled in Verena's eyes at the memory.



"Later, they brought me from the countryside to Shoildon, only for the sake of the marriage alliance.Kaia despises me most, but her hostility never mattered to me. What mattered was when she insulted Shawna last night. I couldn't stand it-I hit her.Hard enough to swell her face and bloody her mouth.I don't regret it. After that, Laura and I quarreled. She cut me off. Now, I'm no longer a daughter of the Willis family. So, Isaac, I can't marry you."


Without a word, Isaac drew her into his arms, holding her tightly.



In a low, steady voice, he vowed, "Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Only I have the right to decide who my wife will be."


Time passed, and Isaac eventually called his assistant to drive him to the company.


Verena helped him into the wheelchair, guiding him toward the bathroom to freshen up. Soon after, breakfast was delivered by the hotel staff.



They sat opposite each other. Verena reached across for the strawberry jam on Isaac's plate. "You don't like strawberries. Let me take this."



She spread peanut butter on his toast and handed it to him.



Isaac raised a brow in surprise. Not even his mother knew he disliked strawberries.



"How did you know?" he asked.



Verena lifted her gaze, her voice soft yet serious. "I know everything about you."



There was no playfulness in her tone, only sincerity.


Isaac was taken aback, at a loss for words.



Her calm acceptance of his silence showed she wasn't disheartened.



Deep down, she believed he would one day remember her.


Midway through breakfast, lsaac asked, "Are you planning to stay here?"



"Yes," Verena replied with a nod. A sudden thought crossed her mind, and her lips curved playfully. "If you're free, you can come over at any time."



Better to marry lsaac as the woman he loved than as the Willis daughter bound by duty


"Ahem... ahem..." Isaac choked on his water. Verena quickly handed him a napkin.



He thanked her, lifting his gaze to meet hers.Her eyes shimmered with unspoken meaning.



It was a silent reminder of last night.



Isaac's mind replayed the chaos of those moments.His ears reddened, and a flush crept down his neck.



The air thickened with awkwardness.



To be precise, it was Isaac who felt flustered.



Meanwhile, Verena's gaze lingered on him-steady,intent, and far from innocent.

###Chapter 48 Deeply Touched
Isaac's phone suddenly rang, breaking the awkward tension,and he picked it up at once.



From the receiver came the respectful tone of his assistant, Jacob Howard. "Mr. Bennett, I'm already outside the hotel."


Isaac's reply was calm and measured. "Alright. I'll be down shortly."



After hanging up, he turned toward Verena. "I'm heading to work now."


Verena's lips curved in a gentle smile. "Of course.Have a great day."


Isaac rolled his wheelchair toward the door, yet just as he was about to leave, Verena's soft voice stopped him. "Hold on a moment."



He paused and turned, catching sight of Verena walking over. She lowered herself to crouch in front of him.



He was about to ask what was wrong when she carefully lifted his tie and dabbed at it with a paper napkin.



Only then did he notice the corner of his navy tie had been touched by water.


His gaze fell on her intent expression, and his dark eyes brimmed with a feeling he could neither name nor deny.



When it came to him, she always caught the smallest of details, things even he overlooked.


"All set." Verena's smile bloomed, pulling Isaac back from his thoughts as his eyes rested on her face.



As she straightened his slightly rumpled tie, her voice softened like a spring breeze. "No matter how busy work gets, promise me you'll take care of yourself.Rest when you're tired."



Her eyes were clear as glass, filled with a warmth that seemed to seep into his chest.


For a fleeting instant, the scene resembled that of a wife sending her husband off to work.



Isaac's eyelashes quivered; his heartbeat leapt against his ribs, quick and unsteady.



In that moment, he had to admit one truth: he was deeply touched. "Mr. Bennett, there's a document for you to review."


By the time lsaac gatheed his wandering thoughts, he was already seated in the car.


Yet the storm in his chest had not calmed.



He glanced at the file Jacob held out from the front seat,but did not take it. Instead, his voice was low and steady. "Head to Willis Villa first."


The driver inclined his head. "Yes, sir." Then the wheel turned,altering their course.


Jacob quietly put the document away. But as he shifted, his eyes caught the sight of Isaac's tie-slightly crumpled, the corner dampened.



He blinked, startled. In the past, Isaac never tolerated even the slightest trace of disarray.



Had something shifted since last night?



Jacob remembered waiting nearly half an hour at the hotel entrance, only for lsaac to call and instruct him to return home.



"Jacob."



Hearing his name, Jacob straightened immediately "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?"



Isaac held his phone, lips pressed thin, his gaze lowered. "Next time Verena calls, no matter how busy I am,bring the phone to me at once."



Jacob froze for a beat, and then nodded quickly."Understood, Mr. Bennett."



For a second, he wondered if his eyes had deceived him.



Was Isaac...smiling?



It was hard to believe, not because he never smiled,but because the warmth in it resembled a man hopelessly in love.


Isaac pulled up Verena's number in his contacts, edited it, and pinned it at the very top.







The car drew to a halt outside Willis Villa.



"Mr. Bennett, would you like me to announce your arrival first?" Jacob asked cautiously.



Isaac's eyes narrowed on the villa gates, his brows knitting. His reply was cold as steel. "Unnecessary."


For the Willis family, empty formalities were not required.



Jacob nodded. "Alright." Then he moved to wheel Isaac forward.



At that hour, Alec had just finished breakfast and was preparing to leave for the office, while Laura,Kaia,and Luka were making their way downstairs.



The first to spot lsaac was Alec, who had just reached the living room entrance.


Surprise flickered in his eyes, but he quickly approached with a smile. "Mr. Bennett, when did you arrive? If you had told us earlier, we would have prepared coffee."



Laura and Kaia exchanged a quick glance.


Then,Laura rushed over.


Kaia,regretting her choice of pajamas, wished she had dressed better.Straightening her hair, she followed.



Only Luka remained at the table, eating his breakfast leisurely, his demeanor of a spoiled heir untouched.



He had heard that Verena left home yesterday, and the news secretly pleased him.



"Good morning, Isaac. Please sit!" Laura's smile was warm as she barked an order at the servant. "Don't just stand there-bring our finest coffee..."



"Don't bother," Isaac interrupted, his tone flat.



Where others plastered on smiles, his face remained unreadable.


Though seated in a wheelchair, the air around him was as commanding as a general on the battlefield.



Sensing something amiss, Alec's smile faltered."Mr.Bennett, is there something you wish to discuss?"



His first thought was Verena.



"There is indeed," Isaac answered. "It concerns my fiancée."



The Willis family exchanged startled glances.


Laura frowned, suspicion rising. "Isaac, what do you mean by that?"



Isaac's gaze lifted to her, a cold gleam flickering beneath his lashes.



Under that look, Laura's eyelids twitched, and a shiver ran down her spine.



"Isaac,why are you staring at me like that?"


His lips curved faintly, yet the smile carried an edge."I'm simply curious how you managed to drive my fiancée out of her own home."



The smile might have been polite, but the weight behind it pressed like a storm.



Kaia's heart froze-he was here for Verena



Alec thought bitterly that he should have foreseen Verena would bring Isaac into this.



He frowned at her lack of restraint.


But what mattered now was calming Isaac.


"Well, the truth is, Verena was just..." Alec was cut off by Laura, who shifted her tone to disdain. "So what if she was driven out? A daughter bold enough to challenge her own mother hardly deserves a place at home. Don't worry, lsaac. I only asked her to stay outside for a while. She'll return before the wedding.She grew up in a small village, accustomed to a carefree life. Without proper discipline, she'll only bring trouble to the Bennett family in the future."



Laura spoke as though even allowing Verena back was a gift.



Alec's face flushed crimson with fury.



Foolish woman!



But with Isaac present, he could not let his anger show. Isaac did not so much as glance at her. His voice was steady, his words striking like thunder. "You may see Verena as unimportant, but to me, she is one of a kind."



The declaration left the Willis family dumbstruck.



They knew all too well who lsaac was, the brightest heir of the Bennett family in Shoildon.



Even with his legs paralyzed, his shares and influence stood unshaken.



No one had imagined he would speak with such sincerity, such unmistakable affection.



At the table, Luka finally set down his glass after gulping milk, stunned.


He had never expected his eldest sister's charm to run so deep-deep enough to rattle Isaac himself.



Verena had truly turned the tide.

###Chapter 49 Her Supposed Infidelity
Laura pressed her lips together. Could it be that Isaac had come here to defend Verena?



The thought left her stunned. After all, Verena and Isaac had only met a handful of times.


Why,then,was Isaac suddenly showing such concern for Verena?



His deliberate appearance today to discuss these matters must have been triggered by something Verena said once she had left home.



The more Laura thought about it, the more her teeth clenched. Her dislike for Verena, already sharp, grew keener still.



Alec's face darkened; his expression carried the weight of regret.


Had he foreseen things spiraling to this extent, he would never have allowed Laura's reckless outburst the night before.



Isaac's visit-whether born of care for Verena or of concern for the Bennett family's reputation-meant one thing: their treatment of Verena had clearly displeased him.



Unlike Laura, who was carried away by resentment,Alec valued the family's standing far above Kaia's grievances.


"Isaac,you've mnisunderstood. We did not drive Verena out. She quarreled with her mother yesterday and stormed off in anger. In truth, we-"


"Mr. Bennett," Kaia broke in before Alec could finish.



Isaac's clear concern for Verena pricked her heart like a thorn.



He was the man she admired, and she could not endure watching Verena-someone she dismissed as insignificant-draw his attention.



Isaac turned his cold eyes upon Kaia.



She stepped forward with a strange smile tugging at her lips. "Mr. Bennett, your feelings for Verena may run deep, but there's something you likely do not know."



Her words stirred the curiosity of Alec, Laura, and even Luka.



Isaac's expression, however, remained as still as stone. Ignoring his frostiness, Kaia unlocked her phone,opened an album, and held the screen out toward him.



Alec and Laura leaned forward at once; even Luka,usually detached, walked over and craned his neck to see.



The image revealed Verena dining opposite a young man.



Their posture and gestures hinted at intimacy.



Verena leaned forward with playful ease, tugging lightly on the man's tie, while he scratched his head in shy embarrassment.


Both were young, striking, and their interaction appeared affectionate.



Anyone seeing the photo would take them for a budding couple.



Kaia caught the shock flickering across the others ' faces, and a cold glint of triumph flashed in her eyes.



With this, she was certain Isaac's regard for Verena would wither.



Luka snorted aloud, his scant tolerance for Verena plunging into outright disdain.



Who would have guessed she was so unruly? Engaged to the heir of the Bennett family, yet still bold enough to stir scandal elsewhere.



To marry into Shoildon's most powerful household should have been a crowning glory, but she still reached out for fresh excitement.



Alec's brows knitted tightly as he stared at the photo,his face a storm of surprise, anger, and shame.



Never had he imagined that his seemingly quiet and well-behaved daughter would carry on like this in private.



If outsiders got wind of it, the entire Willis family name would be dragged through the mud.



Laura,however, remained unnervingly calm, as though she had always known Verena's true colors.



Folding her arms, she inwardly praised Kaia for her move.



Losing the Bennetts as an ally was no small loss, but since Isaac clearly meant to defend Verena, why not turn his anger upon the very woman he sought to protect?



Besides, they still had the Lyons family to rely on.



If Isaac's fiancée was seen to be dallying with another man, his pride was  bound to take a blow. Surely, he would not let Verena off unscathed.



Verena dared to beg lsaac for help. Thinking of this,Laura was eager to see him teach her a brutal lesson.



A sneer tugged at Laura's lips.



Hah! Verena had dared to threaten her with such arrogance the night before.



Now she would reap what she had sown.



How bold would she remain once Isaac discovered her supposed infidelity?



"Mr. Bennett," Kaia said, her tone louder now, "I happened to capture this by chance. As for whether my sister has further entanglements with the man in the photo, I cannot say. But I felt you deserved the truth. You show her such devotion, yet she treats you like this, clearly unworthy of your care. With this evidence in hand, Mr. Bennett, do you still wish to stand by Verena?"



Kaia knew Isaac's physical state meant her hopes of marrying him were futile.



So,she dropped the pretense of being a dutiful sister and spoke without disguise.



Isaac let her finish her gloating speech, and then cast a single, unhurried glance at the phone. The profile in the photo was unmistakably Verena's-smooth forehead, curled lashes, a delicate nose, lips tinted with natural color.



Her skin glowed; her beauty was undeniable.


Even in this moment, Isaac found his gaze lingering upon her, admiring her beauty.



And as for the man sitting across from her...



The scene was not unfamiliar. He recognized Verena's outfit,remembered the playful tug on the tie



It was from the Fortune Garden Restaurant yesterday.He himself had been there.



He recalled how Verena had noticed his unease and quietly gone upstairs to reassure him.



Jealousy was never his way



Instead,memory stirred warmth within him.



Verena had soothed his fragile emotions, spoken with patience, and even kissed him.



While Isaac remained silent, Kaia mistook it for suppressed fury. Her lips curved into a smile of victory,relishing her own malice.



Yes-surely he would punish Verena for such shamelessness.



After all, what man could tolerate betrayal, least of all one as remarkable as lsaac?



Her hope was simple: that lsaac would call off the marriage arrangement in front of Alec, driving Verena into utter disgrace, making her lower her head and beg for mercy from the Willis family.



The thought set Kaia's pulse racing.



She kept her eyes fixed on Isaac, desperate not to miss a flicker of reaction.



Alec, Laura, and Luka also watched him, breath caught in their throats.



The room lay in silence, the air heavy as though frozen.



Just as the Willis family braced for lsaac's judgment upon Verena, a soft chuckle escaped him.



"If I recall correctly, Miss Willis, you are a student at Acorith College of Medicine, are you not?"



His question, utterly unrelated, left the family exchanging puzzled looks.

###Chapter 50 Chilling Threat

Kaia didn't know why Isaac suddenly shifted the topic,but hearing him bring up her elite school filled her with pride. Smiling with confidence, she nodded and said, "That's right, I'm studying at Acorith College of Medicine."



"A student from Acorith College of Medicine has fallen so low? How laughable. You followed your sister around, snapped pictures of her with another man,and showed them to her fiancé-and Miss Willis,even if any of it istrue, shouldn't your first thought as Verena's family be to stand by her?"


Isaac's stare cut straight into her, laced with sarcasm,and the cold sharpness in his eyes made her shiver.


Kaia stiffened where she stood, her face flickering through different emotions. Why was his anger turned on her? Shouldn't he despise Verena for supposed infidelity? Instead, his cold ridicule was aimed at her.


What she faced from him was entirely different from the reaction Kaia had imagined.


Kaia's once-bright smile collapsed into stiffness,and she blinked awkwardly before saying, "Mr. Bennett, I don't understand what you mean. My only intention

was to stop you from being misled."



"Not understanding doesn't matter." His voice was low,and his narrowed eyes glowed with danger. "But remember this. Secretly taking pictures is useless. I know my fiancée better than you do."


He already knew the Willis family dismissed Verena,and his words were chosen to strike them deliberately.


"And even if Verena really is that kind of woman,my feelings don't change," he added. "She's the only one I want. As long as she's willing to remain by my side,I'll overlook her flaws. Do you hear me?"



The declaration stunned everyone in the room,leaving Isaac the only one unfazed.


Alec's eyes widened as he stared at him, disbelief etched into his face. He wondered if the crash six months ago had damaged more than Isaac's legs. If nothing was wrong with lsaac's mind, there was no way he could have stood by Verena's side after seeing the photo and pushed back against eveything being said about the way she lived.



Of course, Alec kept those doubts to himself. What weighed heavier was the regret pressing in on him. If he had realized earlier how deeply lsaac cared for Verena,then regardless of Danica's opinion of their family,he would have done more to shield Verena.


Luka couldn't shake the feeling that lsaac's accident had scrambled something in his head. It was the only way to make sense of the way he spoke-like every word was soaked in blind loyalty.



Grinding her teeth, Laura struggled to make sense of it. What spell had Verena cast that could make lsaac so blind to her faults?



Kaia's complexion drained of color,her gaze burning with envy and bitterness. Isaac showed no fury toward Verena's betrayal. Instead, he twisted Kaia's accusations into shameful overreach. What did Verena possess that earned such unwavering love? She wasn't well educated, she lacked refinement-was her beauty alone enough to blind him?


Unable to hold her composure any longer, Kaia bit down on her lip until it stung. "Mr. Bennett,the photo isn't mine. A friend captured it while eating out, l...l Swear-"



Her voice cracked, breaking into sobs halfway, her shoulders trembling as though the weight of injustice crushed her.



Laura tugged her closer, pulling her under a protective arm.



"Isaac, must you take this so harshly? Kaia already told you she didn't take that picture. And even if she had, she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." she only wanted to warn you about the woman beside you. Verena grew up in some uncultured backwater,and she still carries that lack of polish. Kaia's the one looking out for you, and you ought to appreciate her."



Her face softened with warmth as she spoke of Kaia,yet the moment Verena's name left her lips, her tone sharpened into contempt.



Watching the contrast in Laura's expression, Isaac caught every shift. A sudden relief washed through him that Verena wasn't present. If she had been forced to hear those words...


The memory of Verena's tear-filled eyes flashed across lsaac's mind, and the thought twisted something in his chest he refused to linger on.



With a cold stare fixed on Laura, he spoke slowly,each syllable deliberate. "Mrs. Willis, your devotion to your younger daughter is remarkable. She's fortunate to have a mother like you. But tell me-did you forget that Verena is also your child? I've never seen a mother tear down her own daughter so publicly."


Laura let out a sharp laugh. "Yes, she's mine by blood,but don't ignore the truth-she grew up in some countryside with her grandmother, never taught properly. I'm not insulting her-I'm stating facts. When she enters the Bennett family, it'll be your mother's duty to shape her into someone presentable." Hearing Laura bring up his mother, Isaac easily saw through Laura's scheme.



Danica had always disapproved of the Willis family's behavior, yet she tolerated them for the sake of the marriage alliance. Laura clearly wanted to lean on that authority to sway him.



Isaac's brow tensed as he spoke slowly, each word deliberate. "Verena isn't just the woman I plan to marry. She makes her own choices. I didn't choose her so I could fix her or change her. I chose her because I want her to be happy. And no one-neither you nor my mother-gets to decide who she should be."



The Willis family gaped, stunned silent, unable to believe the level of protection Isaac gave Verena.


When faced with their disbelief, he added without hesitation, "The moment she becomes my wife, I'll sign over half of my shares to her name."



From behind his parents, Luka let out a sharp breath.Half? That was an amount beyond comprehension.



Alec,meanwhile, stood stiff as stone, haunted by one dreadful realization that wouldn't let go-lsaac's devotion to Verena was unwavering, and they had made the mistake of turning against her. Shock swept across Laura's and Kaia's faces, their voices colliding in disbelief. "What did you just say?"



The revelation struck like thunder-Isaac intended to hand over half of his company shares to Verena?



Their stunned expressions meant nothing to him. He already knew they dismissed Verena as unworthy,hoping she would walk away empty-handed. He was determined to prove the opposite-that she would thrive without any help from the Willis family.



He lifted his eyes, his gaze locking onto Laura with a chill that didn't waver. "One more thing," he said, his voice low. "I don't let things go easily. Whatever you put my fiancée through..."



A brief silence stretched before he deliberately shifted."I don't know how much my mother's generosity has bought you, nor do I care. But from me... I'm not sure if you can find any favors. What I can promise is this -I have the power to erase your family overnight."


The look in his eyes was glacial, deep and merciless,like the heart of winter itself. His presence filled the room,pressing down with a weight that felt inborn.


Laura's complexion drained of color, her jaw twitching as though the words cut straight into her.



Cold sweat trickled down her back despite the season's chill, each drop reminding her of the danger before her.



Her courage faltered, and for the first time, she lowered her eyes, a sharp pang of regret twisting inside her.
###Chapter 51 There Is Only One Solution
If Laura had realized earlier what was at stake, she would never have treated Verena in such a reckless manner.



Regret gnawed at her as she thought back-she should have heeded Alec's warning and avoided stirring the pot before Verena married into the Bennett family.



How had she let matters escalate into a quarrel with Verena? And to such a bitter extent?



Alec swallowed hard,desperate to salvage something from the wreckage. "Mr. Bennett, this is all a misunderstanding. You can rely on us-we'll bring Verena back home immediately."



"I don't care what you do." Isaac's cold voice cut like ice. "But mark my words-the one l intend to marry is Verena, not some so-called daughter of the Willis family. Don't dream of wielding your family name to press down on my fiancée."



Alec now fully grasped Verena's weight in Isaac's heart. What else could he possibly say? Without sparing him a glance, Isaac instructed Jacob to take him to Bennett Group.



Jacob gave a brisk nod and wheeled Isaac out of the villa.



That short visit had made one thing blindingly clear: Verena held a place in Isaac's life that no one could shake.



The moment Isaac left, Alec's anger erupted like a dam breaking.



"See the mess you've caused!" he thundered, pointing a trembling finger at Laura, his whole body quaking.



Laura stiffened her spine, casting aside her earlier fear,and retorted with steel in her voice, "What did I do? It was Verena, that stubborn girl, who stormed off on her own. How is this my fault?"


"You're still arguing?" Alec's face burned crimson as he lifted his hand toward her.


"Well,well... are you going to strike me now?" Laura's voice rose with sharp sarcasm. "Wasn't it you who allowed me to go upstairs to discipline Verena? And now,with things gone awry, you wash your hands clean and lay all the blame on me?"


Her words pierced Alec to the quick "I did let you discipline her, but I never told you to throw her out!" His face tightened,breath heavy."And Kaia-you used to be obedient. How did you turn so reckless the moment your sister came to live with us?"



"Dad... how can you say that?" Kaia's eyes widened,stunned by his sudden scolding.



Meeting his cold, furious gaze, Kaia parted her lips,only to feel a surge of anger and resentment twisting inside her.



She had never imagined Isaac would defend Verena with such ferocity, shattering her plans and leaving her humiliated.



Her resentment turned not only against Verena but also against Alec for his fickle nature.



Kaia had long known her father measured worth by profit.



Whoever shone brighter and promised greater gain would receive his favor.



Thus, she had trained herself never to stumble, never to err.



Yet she had not foreseen that lsaac's cutting words would overturn Alec's treatment of her compared to Verena. Hatred flickered in Kaia's eyes, though she clenched her fists to keep it hidden.



She despised Verena. She despised Alec. To the very marrow.



Seeing Alec's wrath turn toward Kaia, Laura rushed to shield her, protesting anxiously, "What does this have to do with Kaia? I won't let you speak to my daughter that way."



But Alec, recalling Isaac's warning, trembled with fury and shouted, "So Kaia is your daughter, and you conveniently forget that Verena is also your daughter?"



"Yes, Verena is my daughter-I haven't forgotten,"Laura snapped. "But so what? Sooner or later,she'll marry into the Bennett family and stand against me.She already disrespects me without shame-why should I treat her with kindness?"



Alec's chest heaved as he saw the cold indifference in her eyes. She still hadn't grasped the gravity of the matter.



His voice cracked with rage. "If you know she's marrying into the Bennett family, can't you see how easily they could crush us without even lifting a finger?Have you lived in comfort so long that you've forgotten the hardships we clawed through to reach this point? Teaching Verena a lesson is one thing,but you dared to drive her from our home!" He sucked in a breath and shouted, "Laura, how can you be so heartless!"



"You think I'm the villain?" Laura sneered, rolling her eyes. "Alec,weren't you the one who allowed me to teach Verena a lesson? Without your approval, would I have dared? Now that it's gone awry, you pretend to be righteous and throw all the blame on me. Stop acting like a saint!"



After decades together, Laura knew every crevice of Alec's mind and laid his hypocrisy bare with a few words.



Humiliated before his children, Alec's fury boiled over.



He ground out between clenched teeth, "You shameless liar!"



Laura shot back instantly, "Liar? Then what are you?A cunning fox? Or a hypocritical pretender?"



Pushed past his limit, Alec raised his hand, ready to strike her.



But Kaia and Luka rushed forward, pulling them apart



Laura, clutched by Kaia, snapped coldly, "Let go, Kaia I want to see if he truly has the guts to hit me."



"Madwoman! Lunatic!" Alec spat, straining against Luka's grip as if to lunge again.



"Enough! stop causing unnecessary drama!" Luka's voice thundered across the room, cutting through the chaos.



Alec and Laura froze, and once Alec ceased struggling,Kaia released her hold on her mother's shoulders.



All three turned to Luka.



Luka took in the sight-his father's disheveled suit, his mother's tousled hair.


His frown deepened. "Dad, Mom, I know you're furious about Verena, but don't forget Isaac's words before he left. He said plainly he will only marry Verena-not a daughter of the Willis family. The meaning is crystal clear. Whether she returns home or not, his decision stands. But now that she's stormed out in anger, if we fail to win her forgiveness before the wedding,she will turn Isaac against us. And the Bennett family can topple us as easily as snapping a twig."



Luka exhaled, speaking with calm reason."The priority now is not to quarrel but to devise a strategy to mend this. Otherwise, all our shouting will only hasten our downfall."



The other three Willis family members had been swept away by emotion, blind to reason. Only Luka, standing a step outside the fray,kept his head cool and pinpointed the crux of the matter.


Hearing his clear analysis, Alec felt a sting of shame,though he masked it.



Straightening his back, he smoothed his collar and forced composure.



Clearing his throat, he nodded stiffly. "Luka is right.We cannot afford to offend Isaac. The urgent task is to fix this matter at once."



Laura, too, steadied herself after Luka's sober reminder.





The four Willis family members sank onto the sofas,their minds heavy with worry as they pondered a way out.



After a long silence,Alec finally broke it.this moment, there is only one solution."

###Chapter 52 Apologize To Verena
The sting of Alec's earlier words lingered, and Laura and Kaia sat stiff with anger.



When he spoke, their eyes drifted toward him,curiosity momentarily breaking through their own thoughts.



"So,what exactly are you thinking, Dad?" asked Luka.



After drawing in a steady breath, Alec looked straight at Laura. "You need to bring Verena home and give her a proper apology," he said firmly.


Laura shot to her feet, her voice sharp with disbelief."Did I hear you right? Why should I be the one going after her? I'm her mother, and she ought to apologize to me. Who gave that girl the right to turn things upside down?"



In that moment, Alec couldn't stop himself from recalling how the wives of other powerful families always carried themselves with composure and grace.



"Why are you making this harder than it is?" said Alec,his voice edged with frustration. "You're the one who hurt her. What's so impossible about going after Verena and setting things right?"



The calm certainty in his tone only fueled Laura's temper. To her, Verena's running away wasn't all on her shoulders, so why should she be forced to clean up the mess alone?



Her frustration grew heavier with every thought, until she shouted, "Listen to me, Alec. I will never bend to that girl. Not now, not ever!"


Noticing her fury spiraling out of control, Luka tugged her gently back to her seat. "Mom, please. Tae a breath and let's at least hear Dad out."



Kaia steadied her mother with one hand and tapped her chest in a soothing rhythm. "Momm, Luka's right. We don't have a clear solution yet, so let's hear what Dad has in mind."



Every word of Luka's earlier reasoning had already sunk deep into Kaia's mind.


Even though Kaia's heart burned with dislike for Verena and she longed to see her cast aside, the idea of losing everything terrified her more.


Since Verena mattered deeply to lsaac,crossing her meant challenging the Bennett family itself-a risk that promised disastrous consequences.



Much as she despised the thought, Kaia knew Isaac's warning had been right all along. Destroying the Willis family would take lsaac little effort, and Kaia knew it.



Her place in society meant everything to her, and she would cling to it at any cost. From the start,she had been sheltered like a delicate flower, never knowing the weight of the outside world. Poverty was a fate she could never imagine enduring.



Anyway, she wasn't the one to swallow her pride and apologize to Verena.



Only after her children pleaded with her did Laura's temper ease slightly.



Settling back onto the sofa, she crossed one leg over the other and raised her chin high before cutting her gaze toward Alec. "You know Verena. That girl has a mind of her own. Even if I show up at her door, I can't promise she'll agree to come back."



Regret gnawed at her for ever dragging Verena into the city, since all it had done was stir up chaos in her life.



Recognizing the seriousness of the moment, Alec brushed aside her cold attitude. "Yes, Verena's stubborn. But don't forget-it was you who cast her out. That's the reason she bolted. Arguments between mothers and daughters never last forever. If you swallow your pride and speak from the heart, she'll come back with you."


No sense of maternal warmth stirred in her chest,since Verena had never once felt like a daughter she could call her own.



Laura kept her silence, and Alec's voice turned sharp."You made this mess, so you're the one who fixes it.Isaac already warned us. If the Bennett family steps in,we'll be ruined in no time. Go and face Verena, or stay here enjoying your luxuries until you're shoved back into a life of dirt and fields."



He spelled out the threat in plain terms, aware that nothing frightened Laura more than being dragged back into poverty. He was certain she grasped the weight of his warning.



As his words sank in, Laura's face shifted, the bravado slipping from her features.


In moments, the glamor she wore like armor crumbled,leaving her looking worn and fragile.



A heavy fear pressed into her chest as Alec's warning echoed in her mind.



The thought of Isaac exacting revenge for Verena's sake filled her with dread.



Never again would she allow herself to live in some crumbling, shabby house. The memory of living in poverty had worn her down long ago, and the fear of reiving it haunted her still.


Losing her status and prestige felt more unbearable to her than death itself.



Death seemed kinder than being forced back into that harsh,meager existence.


At last, reality struck her down, and she felt utterly defeated.



Only a short while earlier, she swore she'd never bow to Verena, yet now reality left her with no choice but to think again.



"Fine. If it means keeping this family afloat, I'll swallow my pride," she said through gritted teeth.



The moment Laura gave in, a collective sigh of relief slipped from the others.



In the end, the person who created the problem had to be the one to undo it.



"But where exactly is Verena? How am I supposed to track her down if I don't even know where she's hiding?"Laura snapped.



"That part isn't your concern," said Alec. "I'll have Larry handle the search." Her brows pinched together before she mumbled,"Alright then."



Once he finished delegating, Alec checked the time on his watch.



Isaac's sudden appearance had already thrown his entire schedule off balance.



"It's late already," said Alec, rising to leave."I'll head to the office. Stay alert for Larry's updates."



···



By the time midday rolled around, Larry Marsh finally sent Laura a message, revealing Verena's location along with a room number.


When she saw the name of the luxury hotel, doubt and unease twisted in her stomach.



How on earth could Verena possibly afford a place like this?



The memory of the picture on Kaia's phone came rushing back, and Laura's cheeks burned with shame.



How could she ended up with a daughter bold enough to act so shamelessly?



If word of this ever spread, she'd be the center of ridicule. Still, this wasn't the moment to dwell on shame.Laura ordered the driver to ready the car without delay.


When the car pulled up to the hotel, Laura stepped out by herself and headed straight for the elevator.



Reaching the door to Verena's room, she lingered,her thoughts colliding in a storm of doubt and pride.



The idea of lowering herself before Verena left a bitter taste, made worse by the cruel words she had used to cast her out.



Laura's fingers curled into tight fists as she forced her lungs to steady with slow, deliberate breaths.



Surely Verena would gloat at the thought of being begged to return, wouldn't she?



In her mind, there wouldn't even be a need for persuasion-Verena would fall in line and come back without protest.



Laura convinced herself Verena had run crying to Isaac,hoping he'd send them to fetch her. Riding on that certainty, she jabbed the doorbell.


Across the room, Verena leaned over her desk,grinding herbs she'd picked up earlier, mixing them into ointment meant to ease Isaac's injury. The sound of the bell brought back her promise to Isaac that morning-he was always welcome to drop by.



Thinking of Isaac's shy yet serious look, Verena let a smile spread and hurried to answer whoever was at the door.



A playful comment slipped out as she imagined Isaac behind the door. "You really do as you're told,Isaac..."


But as soon as she opened the door, Verena's smile disappeared completely.



Verena froze for a second, but then she quickly pulled herself together. "What are you doing here?"


"You already know why I came," said Laura, folding her arms as her voice stayed flat. "I shouldn't have said those things to you. You've made your point.Don't you think it's time to come back home?Wandering around like this-what kind of example is that?"



"Back home? Oh, that's funny," said Verena, her tone light as if she had just heard a joke. "Mrs. Willis, you've got the wrong idea. That isn't my home, and you're not my mother."



Laura instantly recognized how she was throwing her earlier words back at her. The stubborn look on Verena's face made Laura's chest tighten. How could the two daughters she gave birth to be so opposite?


Kaia had always been bright and obedient. But this one was useless, lost in her own fantasies.



If it weren't for Isaac, Laura wouldn't care if she ever saw Verena again.


She forced a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes "Verena, I was only angry when I said that. You shouldn't take it to heart. I've been worried sick about you. You can't be resting well in some hotel. Be a good girl and come back with me. The whole family's waiting for you."
###Chapter 53 Sharing A Night Together Makes A...

Laura's sudden change of tone left Verena knitting her brows in puzzlement. After all those years of cold neglect, without a shred of guilt, this abrupt sweetness reeked of suspicion.



In a flash, Verena recalled what Isaac had told her that very morning. The picture became clear-Laura's new approach must have been stirred by Isaac's warning.Otherwise, with Laura's temperament, she would never have come seeking her out. To Laura,she had never truly been a daughter at all.


The whole family was waiting for her? Verena mused with a faint smnirk. How bitterly ironic those words sounded.



With a small, wry smile, she said, "Last night, you made it plain you didn't recognize me as your daughter and told me to leave. Surely, those words are still fresh in your mind. There's no need for pretenses. What's spoken can't be unspoken-you own it, and so do l."



The reminder of the previous night's exchange darkened Laura's face. This obstinate girl was unearthing past grievances, even after she had ference stooped so low as to ask her to return home. Did Verena expect her to fall on her knees in apology?



Still,Laura forced a gracious smile, coating her words with honey. "Verena, they say quarrels between mother and daughter never last. Look, even when you struck my hand,I never took it to heart. Why cling to trifles? They were words said in anger, nothing mnore ..."



Verena answered with a soft chuckle.



Laura mistook it for yielding and felt a swell of triumph.As she thought, Verena feared abandonment; a few kind words, and she was halfway convinced. All their fretting had been needless.



But her joy was short-lived. Verena's smile faded,her voice cutting cold. "I never regret my words. While it may be true that grudges between mother and daughter should not linger, in my eyes, you lost the right to be my mother long ago."


Without another glance, Verena closed the door.Years of disappointment had eroded her patience.Besides, Laura's sudden visit was no act of concern-it was simply spurred by Isaac's warning.


The heavy thud of the door slamming shut struck Laura like a slap across the face. Wait-was this... a refusal to return to the Willis family home? 
Her features twisted with fury, her simmering anger now blazing. In her mind, it was always the child who sought forgiveness from the parent, never the other way around. She had already lowered herself by coming here, yet Verena dared to show her such disdain.



Seething, Laura pounded on the door and shouted,"Open the door, Verena! Open it now!"


Verena,unmoved,ignored the storm outside.



With silence behind the door, Laura's temper boiled over. She struck it again and threatened fiercely,"Have you forgotten the marriage alliance with the Bennett family? Do you not wish to marry lsaac and live a life of comfort? Isaac may care only for you,but his mother won't. If you're no daughter of the Willis family, she'll never agree! Go back now-there's still a chance!"



Even with the hotel's soundproof walls, Laura's shrill voice pierced through, revealing the depth of her agitation.



Unruffled, Verena lifted the receiver and called the front desk.



"Hello, how may I help you?" came a sweet voice.

 
Verena answered calmly, "There's someone outside my door causing a disturbance. Could you please take care of it?"



"Certainly, we'll be right there," the staff member replied courteously.



Verena thanked her and ended the call.


Soon after, hotel security arrived. Laura, hoarse from yelling,was approached by a young woman in uniform.



"Ma'am, we've had a complaint about a disturbance.Please leave at once," she said,gesturing to the exit.



Laura's brows knitted. A complaint? No doubt from that ungrateful girl.



She longed to retort, but her eyes caught the two burly guards standing behind the young woman.Clearly, they were not to be trifled with.



Swallowing nervously, Laura cast a venomous glare at the closed door, as though she couldpierce through and strike Verena down with her stare. That insolent brat had the upper hand this time!



"Do you know who I am? How dare you try to throw me out?" she barked, clinging to her Willis status.



But the young woman, smiling politely, replied,"No matter who you are, if you disturb our guests, you must leave." 
Realizing defiance was unwise, and fearing the guards might actually drag her away, Laura turned and left,her pride bleeding into silent rage.



At last, the corridor grew quiet.


Verena leaned back in her chair, staring up at the ceiling.



What exactly had Isaac said to provoke Laura's visit?


She could only guess, but the Willis family always put their interests first. Isaac must have warned them with sharp words, threatening their standing.


The thought of Isaac shielding her brought a soft smile to her lips.


She lifted her phone and sent him a message.



Feigning innocence, she typed, "Laura came to reconcile today,wanting me back home. Did you say something to them?"


In his office, Isaac was reviewing Willis Group's business reports when his screen lit up.



He glanced at it, saw Verena's message,and without hesitation replied, "Yes, I gave them a warning."



Lying on her bed, Verena broke into a wide grin at his candid admission. She loved that mix of seriousness and hidden shyness in him, so she decided to tease.



Instead of typing, she sent a playful voice message,her tone laced with charm. "Sharing a night together makes a difference, doesn't it? You're already standing up for your fiancée."



Her words-sharing a night together-slipped out softly, tinged with coquettish delight.


Isaac listened, and his heartbeat thundered in his chest.His ears turned crimson. Though nothing truly intimate had happened, last night's closeness had been charged enough to set histhoughts ablaze.



Her teasing was too vivid,difficult not to picture.


He pressed his lips together, steadying himself,and then recorded a reply, his tone restrained. "If you ever need anything, you can always come to me."


After a pause, worried she might misunderstand,he hastily added, "Not because of last night."



Hearing his hurried clarification, Verena burst into Laughter. Shy yet stubbornly dignified, he was undeniably endearing.


 
Glancing at the clock, she noticed it was nearly lunchtime. 
She tapped and sent him a video call request.



Isaac, seeing her avatar pop up, froze for a moment.


Reflexively, he adjusted his tie before accepting.


When the video connected, their eyes locked. Silence hung between them.



Verena studied him, waiting to see if he would break it.


Isaac,however, was still caught on her earlier teasing,momentarily tongue-tied.


At last, he cleared his throat and spoke.


"You..." He paused, gathering composure. "Did you want to talk about something?"



Through the screen, Verena noticed the faint curve at the corner of his lips. He was pleased, but still trying to mask it under his stern facade.



Her brow arched slightly-she hadn't realized he had this side to him.



Relaxing back, she twirled a strand of hair around her finger.



"Nothing in particular," she replied lazily, her voice dipped in playful lilt. "I just wanted to see whether my stern fiancé blushes when I tease him."

###Chapter 54 Touching Your Adam's Apple Through T...
Isaac could sense that Verena was teasing him deliberately.


For a moment, he paused, his fingers curling lightly against his knee.


He placed the phone on the stand before him, his figure looking slightly distant in the frame.


When his silence lingered, Verena smiled and urged gently, "Come a bit closer."


That way,she could see him more clearly.


But Isaac didn't move, so she coaxed again, "Come on,just a little closer."



Her voice carried a softness, almost sweet enough to melt the edges of his restraint, sending a subtle tingling through his heart.


His lips parted faintly, though no words came out. Still,he obeyed-bringing the phone nearer until his entire face filled the screen.



Verena fixed her gaze on him, unashamedly so. She  had to admit-he was strikingly handsome. The depth of his eyes, the bridge of his nose, and the lines of his features seemed carved with intent.



She made no effort to conceal her stare. As she herself had said, after sharing a night together,something had shifted between them.



Heat rose to Isaac's ears beneath her burning gaze.



Just as he was about to retreat from the camera,Verena suddenly laughed.


"Oh, your face isn't red," she said, eyes glimmering,"but your ears are."


Her tone rose with a playful lilt, laced with a subtle charm.



Isaac avoided her eyes, his gaze sliding downward-only to catch sight of something unintended. His pupils widened in surprise.



Verena, staying in the hotel room, was dressed in a thin robe. While she lay on her stomach on the bed,her movement caused the neckline to slip open,revealing a generous curve of her tender, rounded breasts.



Isaac's breath stalled. The image consumed his thoughts, pulling him back to the memory of last night-her warmth, her scent, the weight of her leaning against his chest.


Realizing where his mind was drifting, he frowned slightly, lips pressed tight as if to guard against temptation.



His Adam's apple shifted visibly as he tore his gaze away from the sight.



From the corner of his eye, he noticed Verena reaching toward the camera, as if trying to touch him through the screen.



In a low, husky voice, he asked, "What are you doing?"



Verena, bold as ever, answered without a trace of shyness, "I'm imagining touching your Adam's apple through the screen."



On his side, Isaac's head was tilted slightly upward,exposing the clean lines of his neck. His Adam's apple,prominent and smooth, rose and fell in view,tantalizing under her gaze.



Her straightforwardness left Isaac blushing,yet instead of discomfort, another thought slipped in-did she like it?



Watching her fascinated expression, he felt a quiet sense of peace. For a man like him, having something she liked was already more than enough. After a brief daze, Verena recalled something and said,"Oh, in a couple of days, it's time for your treatment again. I don't feel like going out lately, so why don't you come over instead? Just have your assistant bring the medical kit."



Isaac's expression stiffened for a beat, and then he nodded."Alright."



Seeing his shyness creeping back, Verena smoothly changed the subject.


She glanced behind him and asked, "Are you still working at this hour?"



Snapping back to himself, Isaac answered, "Yes."


"And have you had lunch?" she asked again.



He shook his head."Not yet."


Verena frowned lightly, her tone tinged with genuine concern. "Then eat something first, and get back to work afterward."



Her words carried the warmth of care.



Isaac looked at her deeply, his gaze softer than usual.He cherished such a warm feeling.


"Did you hear me, lsaac?" she pressed, seeing him lost in thought. He pursed his lips and answered gently, "Okay, I'll eat right away."


Satisfied with his compliance, Verena eased.



Before ending the call, she reminded him, "Remember,come to the hotel in two days. And don't go to the wrong place."


Glancing at the call duration, Isaac lowered his head and let out a quiet chuckle.



After a pause, he pressed the intercom. "Jacob, bring in the lunch."



A crisp "Yes" came through.


Soon after, Jacob entered the office lounge, carrying the meal.


Once he laid it out, lsaac took the fork and began eating.



Watching him, Jacob felt puzzled. Barely ten minutes ago, lsaac had dismissed lunch, claimning he wasn't hungry. What changed his mind so suddenly?



When the meal was done, Isaac returned to his desk."Jacob," he called.



"Yes, Mr. Bennett?" Jacob stepped forward. Flipping through a stack of documents, Isaac asked casually, "Isn't Willis Group opening a high-end club in the city center soon?"



Jacob blinked, momentarily taken aback, and then nodded."Yes."



Leaning back in his chair, Isaac tapped his fingers against the armrest in steady rhythm.



After a brief silence, his voice came slow and deliberate. "Tell Beckett the Willis club doesn't meet fire safety standards. It poses a major public hazard.He'll know what to do."



Jacob was stunned. Beckett Clark oversaw safety and enforcement.



At first, Jacob didn't quite grasp Isaac's aim. But once the order was spoken, clarity struck-lsaac was shielding his future wife.


Jacob gave a crisp nod. "Understood. I'll contact Beckett immediately."




...



Beckett wasted no time. After receiving Jacob's message,he personally led a team to the site.


Sure enough, safety risks were found. The club was promptly sealed off.



By afternoon, the much-anticipated club was shut down before it could open.


When Alec heard, he nearly toppled from his chair.Rage and panic flooded him, his chest tightening with such force that he hurriedly swallowed a few pills for relief.



His brows knitted deep, his mind spinning in confusion.He had secured every connection, checked every detail before announcing the launch. Fire safety had been accounted for-so how could it collapse overnight?



The blow came like a thunderclap, leaving his thoughts in fragments.



Desperate, Alec snatched up his phone to call a friend,hoping for help-or at least guidance.



After three rings, the line connected.



"It's me, Alec," he blurted before the other could speak.


After a brief exchange of greetings, he rushed on,"Didn't I tell you a few days ago about Willis Group's new club? Out of nowhere today, we received an order to halt operations for rectification. Your network runs deep-can you find a way to help?" "Well..." the voice on the other end trailed, troubled With a sigh, he added, "Alec, it's not that I won't help.I can't. Beckett Clark himself intervened this time.Who dares go against him?"



Alec's face drained, his eyes tightening with dread.


"Alec, did you offend someone lately?" his friend speculated. Then he paused, thoughtful. "Wait. Aren't you supposed to be forming an alliance with the Bennett family? If that's the case,no one in Shoildon should risk targeting you. So how could you have provoked this? Besides, with Beckett on close terms with lsaac, he wouldn't normally deny you that courtesy."

###Chapter 55 Trying To Visit Barrie
At those words, Alec's eyes tightened in suspicion.Isaac-it could only be him!


In an instant, Alec grasped the truth, his body stiff and unmoving. Yes, without question, it was Isaac-it had to be.



The realization struck Alec that Isaac had made a move against the Willis family for Verena.


Yet what stunned him most was the speed of it. He had assumed it was only empty words, but lsaac had already taken action.


Dropping his elbows onto the desk, Alec buried his head in his hands, refusing to accept what was happening. More than ten years ago, on little more than a whim, he had poured in all his savings and struck gold with his investments. Wealth came overnight, yet he clung to the same business he had always known. In reality, no serious challenge had ever crossed his path.



For several years, the club had been his focus. He had poured his heart into it, only to watch everything unravel within hours. The Bennett family's pressure crushed his progress, forcing every plan to a halt. No -he had to find a way out, and quickly







Sometime after ten that night, a sleek black car rolled into the grounds of Willis Villa.



From the doorway, Laura watched Alec step out of the car while she reached for his briefcase. "Why did you come back so late tonight? Kaia and Luka finished their dinner long ago and are already asleep."



Normally, Laura paid him little attention, but tonight was different. Not bringing Verena along left her unsettled, and the unease made her unusually watchful.



"Are you hungry?" she asked, and then quickly turned toward the housekeeper. "Warm up the food."



"What's the use of reheating anything? Just the sight of you fills me with anger!" Alec barked.



Each time Alec dwelled on the company's problems that stemmed from Laura, fury surged through him Most men dreamed of marrying a virtuous wife, yet he was stuck with one who brought nothing but frustration and letdowns.



Laura's neck grew rigid under his shouting, and the smile on her face faltered. "Alec, why are you this upset?"



Alec's features contorted with rage. "You really want to know why I'm furious? If you hadn't picked a fight with Verena and cut ties with her, she wouldn't have run off, and Isaac wouldn't have shown up to demand payback! Because of you, our club that was about to open is now facing closure!"



"Closure?" Laura repeated, her brows knitting together in confusion. "What in the world is going on?"



After drawing several heavy breaths, Alec leveled a resentful glare at her. "Isaac sent his people to act on his command. He's backing Verena. That club was the product of years of my effort, and now, thanks to you,it's ruined."



Casting his eyes toward the living room,he asked,"Didn't you promise to apologize to Verena and bring her home? Then where is she now?"



Realizing there was no escaping the question, Laura averted her face with clear irritation.



"I went there,but she flatly refused to return with me.Instead, she summoned security and had me thrown out,leaving me utterly humiliated. I shamed myself for nothing. If you want her back so badly, then you go get her."


Alec had clung to the hope that if Verena came back, she might persuade Isaac on his behalf. Laura's words shattered that final chance, and his fury flared even hotter.



"Is your pride worth this much? Even now, you stay stubborn! Do you have any idea how much money vanished in a single afternoon? If the club stays closed,every last bit of our investment will disappear.Do you understand how many workers depend on us for their paychecks? When they come demanding their wages,then you'll learn what true humiliation feels like!"



To drive the point home, Alec made the situation sound even worse, hoping Laura would finally realize how serious things had become.



At last, Laura sensed the full weight of the problem,pressing her lips together to cover the panic stirring inside her. A spark of realization soon flickered in her eyes.



"Oh, of course!" Laura spun toward Alec, her earlier grim look replaced by sudden excitement. "How could we overlook something this important? Kaia healed Barrie's leg, practically giving him his life back! That was no small favor, and he owes us for it. With us in such dire straits now, how could he possibly refuse to help?"



The moment he heard her words, Alec felt a rush of relief, as if he had stumbled across a lifeline in the middle of his despair. Clarity washed over him at once.


With renewed energy, he exclaimed,"Yes,how could that slip our minds? Barrie treasures loyalty and gratitude. Since Kaia gave him such a favor, he'll be sure to repay it. Tomorrow morning I'll have the butler deliver a formal letter requesting an audience with him."



Early the following morning, Alec ordered his butler to take the letter he had prepared the night before straight to the Lyons family home.



Restlessly pacing through the living room, Laura murmured, "It's been so long since the letter was sent.Why hasn't there been any response?"



"Stop pacing back and forth in front of me. You're making me dizzy," Alec said with a frown from the sofa. "It hasn't even been that long since the letter went out. Sit down and be patient. Surely Barrie will want to read it thoroughly before responding, don't you think?"



Even as he spoke calmly, Alec's own nerves gnawed at him. He was more anxious than Laura and had already put business matters aside just to remain at home waiting for Barrie's reply.


Meanwhile, in the Lyons family's back garden, Barrie sat at a table enjoying breakfast, while his son Fletcher Lyons seized the rare chance to share the meal with him.



Their light conversation paused when the butler approached them.



Offering a slight nod to Fletcher, the butler handed Barrie a letter. "The chairman of Willis Group has written to you,requesting a visit."



"Alec Willis?" Barrie asked in surprise, taking the letter and scanning it quickly. "Our families rarely cross paths, so why is he suddenly reaching out to me?"


"What else could the reason be?" Fletcher remarked,handing Barrie a slice of cake. "Willis Group poured hundreds of millions into that club downtown,and just yesterday Beckett shut it down for failing fire safety regulations. He must be out of options and turning to you for help."



News of the closure had already spread through Shoildon like wildfire by yesterday afternoon.



Barrie, however, enjoyed the quiet of his own quarters in his old age and seldom paid attention to outside matters.



Setting the invitation down on the table, Barrie bit into the cake Fletcher offered. "How could a club of that size, backed by so much money, fail something as basic as fire safety checks?" Within business circles, greater sums of money always demanded stricter precautions. Everyone knew that being exposed by the simplest mistakes was the last thing they could afford.



Fletcher gave a knowing smirk. "Passing or failing safety checks depends entirely on Beckett."



Barrie dabbed his mouth with a handkerchief,confusion flickering in his eyes. "What did Alec do to offend Beckett?"



In on the truth, Fletcher shook his head with a faint smile. "It wasn't Beckett. The order came from lsaac."


Yesterday afternoon, when people close to Beckett asked about the details, Beckett openly admitted the command came from lsaac.



Had Isaac wanted his role kept secret, Beckett never would have revealed the truth.



By making it public, Beckett signaled that Isaac intended everyone to know he was the one behind Willis Group's club closure.



Fletcher's words only deepened Barrie's confusion."Isn't Isaac going to marry the Willis family's eldest daughter? Why would he act against them?"


Barrie struggled to make sense of it. Refusing to support his future father-in-law's business was one thing, but giving orders to sabotage Alec outright-what kind of logic was that?



Fletcher paused in thought,remembering when Slater had once said the Willis family's eldest daughter was unattractive and ill-tempered. He had scolded Slater then for spreading gossip, yet even now he couldn't help feeling pity for lsaac. Such a bright young man,but after that car accident...
###Chapter 56 Repaying Dr.Willis
With a quiet sigh, Fletcher guessed aloud. "Maybe Isaac is unhappy with his fiancée and feels powerless in this marriage arrangement. He could be using this as a chance to push the Willis family into canceling the engagement."



Having watched Isaac grow from a boy into a man,Barrie wore a grave expression.



At such a young age, Isaac had already lost his ability to walk and was now bound to a marriage with a woman he despised.



Not only did Isaac feel burdened, but the entire Lyons family pitied his situation.



Fletcher voiced his doubt next. "Alec needs to be sharper. Doesn't he check into relationships before seeking favors? Why would we interfere with someone Isaac is trying to deal with?"


After a short pause, he added, "Still, Alec isn't stupid.He rose to fortune almost overnight and built Willis Group into what it is today."


Following a moment of thought, Barrie said to the butler, "Get in touch with the Willis family and learn what you can."



The butler answered with respect, and then went off to search for the Willis family's number and place the call.



Inside the Willis Villa, Laura looked over at the wall clock. "It's already nine o'clock, and we still haven't heard back. Do you think Barrie is avoiding the trouble because he doesn't want to return the favor?"



Alec answered in a low, firm tone, "Nonsense! Barrie is known all over Shoildon for his integrity. You think everyone stoops to your way of thinking?"



Even as he mocked her, his eyes flicked to the clock,and his fists tightened.



The cup of coffee in front of him sat untouched,long since grown cold.



Truthfully, unease was gnawing at him.



His train of thought broke off when the landline suddenly rang



Alec and Laura froze in surprise, and then rushed toward the ornate round table to answer the call.


The screen displayed no name at all, only a short string of numbers. When Alec answered the call, he spoke cautiously."Hello, Alec Willis speaking."


On the other end, an aged, gravelly voice replied,"Good morning, Mr. Willis. This is Morris Fowler, the butler of MMr. Barrie Lyons."



At that, Alec looked over at Laura, and the nervous tension weighing on them both immediately lifted.


Alec answered warmly,, Mr. Fowler, I've heard of you. You've been with Mr. Lyons since your youth,skilled in so many things, and still impressive even in your sixties."


The praise flowed easily, masking Alec's eagerness beneath a layer of flattery.


"That's very kind of you, Mr. Willis." Morris, long used to such words, skipped over them and asked directly,"Mr. Lyons has seen your letter. What is the matter you wish to discuss with him?"


Laura, standing beside Alec, gave his elbow a small nudge, urging him to bring up the request without delay.


Still, Alec understood that men like Barrie had no patience for empty pleas without proper justification.


So,he chose to lean on sentiment and bring up Kaia's name.



"It's nothing too serious," Alec said with a gentle smile and a note of concern. "I only wished to ask how Mr.Lyons' injured leg is doing. The weather is cold now,and he ought to take care of his health."



Morris knitted his brows, puzzled by Alec's sudden concern over Barrie's condition.



At that moment, Alec let out a regretful sigh. "If I had realized sooner that my daughter could heal Mr.Lyons ' leg, I would have sent her years ago and spared him all that needless suffering."


Of course, Alec twisted the truth, fully aware that Kaia had not been capable of such work at the time.



That detail hardly mattered now. What counted was that he sounded sincere and that Morris remembered it was his daughter who had brought recovery to Barrie's leg.



In the end, the Lyons family remained indebted to the Willis family.



Once the call ended, Morris wasted no time and stepped quickly outside.



When Morris repeated Alec's message, Barrie grew quiet, lost in thought as he  considered the possibility.Dr.Willis had chosen to remain somewhat anonymous, revealing only her family name.



A moment later, Moris put forward a new idea. "That physician shared the surname Willis. Is it possible she's Alec's daughter, Mr. Lyons?"


Barrie's eyes brightened with understanding,his jaw slackening a bit. "My recovery hasn't been publicized.If this information reached them, there's a great chance Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter."


Turning his focus to Fletcher, he asked, "Can you tell me how many girls are in the Willis family?"



Knowledgeable about the household, Fletcher answered without hesitation, "They have two daughters. The older one is Isaac's fiancée. She grew up out in the countryside and reportedly didn't finish her last year of high school. The younger daughter is studying medicine and is said to be quite skilled."



Confirmation dawned on Barrie, and he smacked the table with a burst of excitement. "There it is! If the younger daughter's studying medicine, she must be Dr.Willis who healed my leg."



Determined, Barrie continued, "If Alec's daughter is the doctor who treated me, I owe her more than I can say. The Willis family deserves my help with their club problems-even if lsaac objects. Now, help me up!"Bracing himself with his cane, he insisted, "I want to speak to the Willis family myself. Take me inside."



The shared enthusiasm was clear as Fletcher quickly guided Barrie indoors.



Over at the Willis Villa, Alec felt surprised to hear the Lyons family calling back so soon.



As soon as he answered, an exuberant voice from the other end cut in before he could introduce himself."Mr. Willis, I owe you thanks. You've raised a remarkable and considerate daughter."



Though pride was unmistakable, Alec managed a humble reply. "Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Lyons.She certainly has a mischievous side."



Barrie responded warmly, "Don't sell her short, Mr.Willis. Your daughter is exceptionally well-mannered.It's a shame my grandson isn't good enough for her.Otherwise, it would be an honor if she joined my family."



Even though Alec heard Barrie's wish, he remained cautious about reading too much into it, focusing instead on the business at hand.



For Alec, the business matter came first.



Alec had only just begun to bring up the issue with the club when Barrie's strong voice interrupted him. "I'm aware of the problems regarding your club. Give me some time,and I'll take care of it."



Gratitude spread across Alec's features. "Your support means everything, Mr. Lyons. Thank you."


Without missing a beat, Barrie added, "Will you be available the day after tomorrow? If so, myfamily and I would like to pay a visit and show our appreciation."



Laura nearly let out a cheer, unable to contain her happiness.


Having one of Shoildon's most respected families come to visit would lift the Willis family's status to a new level.


Matching Laura's excitement, Alec nodded again and again, taking a deep breath to calm himself. "You are always welcome, Mr. Lyons. It's an honor for our family."



The phone call left Alec and Laura practically bursting with excitement, their energy lasting until Kaia finally returned from school later that day.


As soon as she stepped inside, Laura hurried over,cradled Kaia's cheeks, and planted a kiss on her forehead."You really are a wonderful daughter, Kaia.Every bit of love I've ever given you was worth it."

 ###Chapter 57 Don't Tell Me You Are Actually Jealous
Kaia's eyebrows knitted together,confusion flickering across her face. "Mom, what's gotten you all worked up?"


Laura could barely contain her excitement,her whole face lighting up. "You won't believe it-Barrie Lyons called this morning. He's not only stepping in to fix the club mess, but he said he'd drop by in two days to thank you himself for curing his leg!"


"Seriously?" Kaia blinked in surprise, and then broke into a wide, unstoppable smile. "He's coming here?"


Laura laughed and tugged her over to the couch."Why would I make that up? If you're doubting me,ask your dad."


Looking at Alec,Kaia immediately noticed the change.He seemed lighter, a genuine smile softening his features.


"She's telling the truth," Alec admitted, his tone gentle."Barrie couldn't stop praising you-said you're considerate, remarkable, and well-mannered."


Ever since Kaia's birth, Alec had considered her a lucky us charm. When fortune smiled on the family, he was sure she brought the blessing. That certainty faded over the years, but hearing Barrie's praise brought the old feeling rushing back.



To Alec, Kaia was the best thing that ever happened to them.



Laura squeezed Kaia's hand, still brimming with pride."And that's not all. Barrie even joked that it's a shame his grandson isn't good enough for you, or he'd love for you to marry into their family. That's how highly he thinks of you."



Compliments piling up, Kaia couldn't hide her delight.She smoothed her hair, chin tipping up with newfound confidence. "Honestly, I've never been short on admirers. If all my admirers from school lined up, we'd have a traffic jam on the block. And I'm no less than Slater. To say Slater is not good enough for me isn't exactly wrong."


Her playful confidence seemed to lift everyone's mood,leaving the whole house buzzing with pride.


"That's true," Laura said with a warm smile, reaching up to smooth Kaia's hair. "But keep this in mind-humility and manners go a long way, especially with families like theirs. They notice those things. When Barrie visits,be sure you look your best." Her mother's advice rang true, and Kaia knew exactly what was at stake. The Willis family and the Lyons family lived in different worlds, and she understood how much appearances mattered. "I get it, Mom. You don't have to worry. I'll keep my eyes and ears open,and I won't speak unless I need to."



Alec and Laura exchanged a proud glance, grateful for a daughter who never made life difficult.



Their thoughts drifted-almost involuntarily-to Verena.





Compared to Kaia, their other daughter always seemed determined to go her own way.



A complicated look passed over Alec's face. Only last night, he'd argued with Laura about bringing Verena home no matter the cost. Now, after the call from the Lyons family, he hadn't brought it up once. If Verena wanted to walk out of their lives, maybe it was time to let her.



Laura's happiness was impossible to miss-her smile stretched wide, pride sparkling in her eyes.



Why should she worry about Verena having Isaac? The Lyons family's support meant far more, and now their own future felt secure.



Even if the Bennett family was out of reach, Laura doubted Verena could cause trouble from a distance.



Feeling bold, she grabbed her phone and shot off a quick message to Verena.	"You're really underestimating both your father and your sister. Just because you have Isaac doesn't mean we're powerless.Don't count us out so quickly."



With a sigh, Verena gave a quick glance at Laura's message, her lips curling in a smirk.


Yesterday, Laura played the part of the doting,humble mother; today, she strutted around as if she ruled the world.If that wasn't a warning sign, Verena didn't know what was.



No response felt necessary. She locked her phone screen, dropped it onto the coffee table,and decided Laura's theatrics could wait for another day.


Half an hour passed before lsaac showed up at her door.



Jacob arrived just a step behind, setting the medical kit down on the table, eyes darting between his boss and Verena, as if waiting for a signal.


Verena flipped open the case, methodically checking every supply inside. "Jacob, you'll want to wait in the car this time. We might be a while."


Uncertain, Jacob lingered, looking to lsaac for guidance.



A brief silence hung between them before lsaac caught Verena's steady gaze, the intensity in her eyes making him look away



"You can wait outside, Jacob," Isaac said. "I'll call when we're finished here."



As soon as Jacob disappeared down the hall, Verena gently pushed Isaac's wheelchair into the bedroom.



Warm,floral notes filled the air, wrapping them both in a sense of quiet intimacy. Isaac's attention drifted to the neatly made bed, the memory of their night together flashing in his mind.



He could still recall how easily his hand had circled her slender waist-how small and delicate she'd felt,held close beneath the sheets.



Whenever she lay against him, it was as if she weighed nothing at all.



Every detail about her drew him in, except for that wild,unpredictable spirit that kept slipping through his fingers.



"Isaac."



A sudden rush of warmth danced along his ear as Verena's breath tickled his skin, making him go rigid Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac realized she'd come up behind him, her hands now resting firmly on his shoulders, her upper body pressed close.



He shifted, catching a glimpse of her elegant fingers,splayed over his shirt.


The moment sent a rush of memories through him-too vivid, too intimate. For once, the ever-composed Isaac felt thrown off balance.



"What..." His voice cracked,rough around the edges."Uh...what is it?"



Verena picked up on his nervousness with ease.


"Maybe I should be asking you," she murmured, her tone playful. "I must have said your name three times,and you didn't even blink. What's got you so distracted?"



Isaac fumbled for a reply. "It's nothing, just..."


She cut him off with a sly smnile, leaning in even closer, her words a secret meant only for him."Nothing? I'm guessing you were replaying that night in your head. The way you held my hand-how close we were?"



Her body pressed softly against his back, sending his pulse racing. So near, Verena could see the blush spreading across Isaac's cheeks and all the way to the tips of his ears.



"Relax, I'm just messing with you." Verena straightened, her hands slipping away. "Let's get started with your therapy."



Isaac's shoulders eased as he let out a shaky breath,looking every bit the guilty kid caught in the act.


Even now, her voice close to his ear kept replaying that night in his mind-the teasing, the laughter, and how powerless he'd felt against her charm.



Helping him settle on the bed, Verena carefully rolled up his shirt and reached for his belt buckle.



A look of alarm flashed across Isaac's face as he caught her wrists, voice a little breathless. "Wait-what are you doing?"



Tension rippled across his abdomen, muscles taut with anticipation and nerves.



With a calm glance, Verena answered, "I need to start your treatment."



Realizing he might be overreacting, he averted his gaze, his voice low. "I don't remember ever needing to undress for this before..." Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Things have changed. We used to focus just on your legs, but today's therapy targets a new area."



Color rose in his cheeks, but he still didn't release her hands. "Is that really necessary?"



"It is. I need access to your lower abdomen," Verena replied plainly.


For a moment, Isaac hesitated, clearly torn.



"Are you sure we can't do this another way?" he mumbled,almost hopeful.


She let out a gentle laugh,exasperation mingling with affection. "Isaac, trust me-if you want to get better,you'll have to let me do my job."



His hand still trapped hers, so Verena leaned in,locking eyes with him. "Are you planning to avoid intimacy forever, or are you actually going to let me help you?"



Heat rushed to Isaac's cheeks, and his grip slackened at once.



Taking the opportunity, Verena deftly unfastened his belt.



The faint click echoed between them, prompting lsaac us to snatch her wrists again, flustered. "I can handle this part myself," he muttered.



She let him take over, watching as his black trousers slipped just enough to expose his lower abdomen Quietly, Verena dipped her fingers into a jar of herbal ointment-a formula she'd painstakingly perfected these last few days, meant to target his condition.



His skin was hypersensitive to the touch, and even the cool, light pressure of her fingertips sent a shiver through him.



Verena leaned in close to make sure the ointment stayed put, the ends of her hair brushing his stomach and making him twitch with a mix of embarrassment and anticipation.



After smoothing the ointment, she rolled over a heat lamp,angling it toward him and switching it on.


While the medicine did its work, Verena crossed the room,picked up a small gift box, and carried it back to Isaac. Inside was a dark, elegant necktie.



"This is for you," she said, placing the tie in his hand.



It wasn't new-just something he'd left behind long ago in Clokron, after a night spent at her place when he refused to leave her side.



The night before, Gavin had managed to return the tie, slipping it back into Verena's hands.


Isaac turned the fabric over in his fingers,remembering how,at Fortune Garden Restaurant,he'd watched her tug the tie of the man she was with.



The color, the pattern-everything matched the one he held now.



The thought nagged at lsaac-had she given that tie to the man?



His gaze dropped, a faint frown shadowing his face



Even knowing the truth, he couldn't shake off the sting of jealousy.



Turning the tie over in his hands, he muttered, "You hand these out to everyone, or am I special?"



Verena caught the low rumble of his voice and looked over,brow raised. "What's that supposed to mean?"



He glanced away, voice even softer. "It's nothing.Forget it."



Verena's laughter was light. "You're seriously going to act like that? Why on earth would you think I'm giving ties to half the city?"


For a moment, Isaac stayed quiet, fingers tracing the fabric. Then, almost reluctantly, he spoke up."|saw you at the restaurant. The guy sitting across from you had a tie just like this. Did you give him one too?"



His last words sounded almost wounded-more boyish than he meant to.



Verena's smile widened as she leaned in, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Isaac, don't tell me you're actually jealous."

###Chapter 58 It Belongs To You Alone
Jealous?



Isaac's brows knitted faintly. He could not tell if what he felt was truly jealousy, yet every time he saw another man near Verena, a sharp pang twisted in his chest.



To make matters worse, Verena gifted him a tie that looked exactly like the one worn by that other man.


Isaac lowered his gaze, lips sealed in silence. Verena could see through him; whether he admitted it or not,there was a trace of jealousy in his heart.


She gently took the tie from his hand and explained patiently, "This tie was custom-made in Clokron There is no duplicate, no stock left behind.I asked my friend to bring it home for me, but finding it inconvenient, he casually wore it around his neck.That was the scene you stumbled upon in the restaurant."



Placing the tie back in his palm, she added softly,"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."


After all, the tie had always been his. Isaac, ever meticulous, had always worn ties designed by professionals with exacting care.


But since his memory still lay shrouded in amnesia,Verena left it at that, offering only a brief explanation.


Isaac looked down at the tie once more, her words echoing in his mind-"Don't worry. It belongs to you alone."



What she had said so casually struck a deeper chord in him.



To Isaac, it sounded as if Verena had chosen it exclusively for him, a token meant to bind the two of them.



The thought stirred a sudden wave inside him, so strong he had to draw in a quiet breath to steady himself.



"Thank you," he murmured, a faint curve on his lips betraying his inner delight.


Verena caught his smile and tilted her head playfully."So, are you happy now? You're satisfied so easily,aren't you?"


Before he could reply, she leaned in and brushed a feather-light kiss across his cheek. "You're welcome.I'm just glad you're happy." 
Then, as though nothing had happened, Verena switched off the heating lamp, removed the ointment from his abdomen, and busied herself with quiet efficiency,leaving Isaac to wonder if that fleeting kiss had been real or merely an illusion of his longing



When the treatment was complete,Verena helped him sit upright and reminded him gently, "Don't take a bath once you're home tonight. If you feel uncomfortable, you may use a damp towel to wipe yourself down, but take care not to let water touch your abdomen."



Isaac nodded as he settled back into his wheelchair."Alright, I understand."


Verena didn't try to detain him further. Isaac called Jacob, who soon arrived upstairs and wheeled him toward the elevator.



...



Back at the Bennett residence, Isaac found Danica waiting on the sofa, her eyes fixed on him with a look of discontent.



From her expression alone, lsaac could already guess what was coming.


Sure enough, he had barely turned his wheelchair when Danica rose and demanded, "The Willis family's 
club was shut down. Was it your doing?"


Isaac stilled his wheels and answered without hesitation, "Yes. It was me."



Earlier,when Danica learned that someone influential had moved against the Willis family, she casually dispatched people to investigate-after all, the Willises were meant to become her in-laws.



To her astonishment, the culprit turned out to be none other than her own son, who had personally instructed Beckett to close the venue.



Danica was dumbfounded then, and now, hearing him admit it so calmly, her shock mingled with anger.


"Didn't you already agree to marry Verena? Why,then,are you still striking against the Willis family? Call Beckett this instant. He only listens to you. Tell him to remove the restrictions immediately and let the venue resume its operations."



"Impossible," Isaac rejected without pause. "I agreed to marry Verena for her sake, not for the Willis family.I acted because they bullied her first. Verena is my fiancée, and I will not stand by while she suffers."


His unwavering tone left Danica briefly at a loss for words. "So you're already protecting her to such an extent? Don't forget-even with a few quarrels,Verena is still their daughter, their very flesh and blood. By moving against the Willises now, outsiders will say you don't truly want this marriage, that you're creating excuses deliberately."



Isaac's eyes narrowed, his expression composed and unshaken by her arguments.


"Rest easy. I will not let her suffer. On our wedding day, I'll make sure everyone understands just how much I care for Verena."



His certainty both startled and unsettled Danica.



For the first time, she could see clearly that her son was deeply taken with Verena.



It wasn't his affection that disturbed her, but his disregard for the Bennett family's standing.


Verena,it seemed, was not the pliant woman Danica had imagined.


Unable to contain her anger any longer, Danica snapped, "And what do you expect to accomplish by this? Are you intent on dragging the Bennett family's name through the mud? Before the marriage arrangement, I promised the Willises certain benefits.Now, the wedding hasn't even taken place, the benefits haven't been granted, yet you've already struck at them. What will people say? That the Bennetts are ungrateful?" Danica's true concern was crystal clear-what others thought of the Bennett family. The Willis family's plight was merely secondary.



Isaac knew this better than anyone.



It was that very obsession with appearances that had driven her to arrange his marriage hastily, lest others discover the illnesses he carried beyond his crippoled legs.



His gaze turned cold as he answered slowly, "What others think is theirs to carry. I have no need to live by their judgments. All I know is this-if anyone dares harm the woman I care for, they must face the consequences."



Danica fell silent, stunned into speechlessness.


It was one matter for him to act against the Willises,but to shield Verena with such fierceness was another altogether.



Only then did Danica grasp that she had underestimated her future daughter-in-law. "People say Verena is a country girl, unsophisticated and harmless. Clearly, everyone was mistaken. She has tricks up her sleeve. In such a short time, she's managed to sway you enough to disregard your own family's reputation. It seems Bobby was right after all.I dismissed his words before,but now I see-if she can turn against her own parents, she will no doubt throw this household into chaos once she becomes your wife."



Danica paused,and then declared with iron resolve, "I arranged this marriage to secure a woman who would be compliant, one I could manage easily. Verena is nothing of the sort. Since you've moved against the Willis family, then so be it-we will cancel this marriage."



At that word "cancel," Isaac's head lifted sharply, his dark gaze locking onto hers.



Danica's heart gave a tremor under the weight of his eyes.



Since the accident, lsaac had rarely looked at her directly.



When speaking, he usually kept his gaze lowered,fixed on the ground.



But now-for the first time since that day-he looked at her straight on, and in his eyes burned a storm of anger.

Chapte 59 Danica Requested To Meet Verena
Isaac spoke with a voice as steady as stone. "I agreed to this marriage not for the sake of the Willis family,and certainly not for you. I did it only because it's Verena. Whether in the past or now, no one-not even you-can keep me from marrying her."


Danica's face darkened with anger as she warned coldly,"Do you truly believe I cannot stop you?"



Isaac's composure never faltered. "With your influence, you could end this marriage in a thousand ways. But Mother, if you dare to do so, then from this moment on, I will live without a mother."



His words struck like a hammer. Danica grasped the meaning and felt her heart reel in disbelief.



A storm of anger and astonishment surged within her.She looked down at lsaac, her frown deepening."Would you really cut the bond between us over a woman?"



From where he sat, lsaac heard her voice. His fists clenched and released, yet his tone remained calm. "lt isn't only about Verena. The instant you chose to harm her, you trampled on my feelings. And since you do not care for mine, why should I care for yours?"


Raising his voice, he commanded the butler, "Take me back to my room."


At once, the butler came forward and escorted him into the elevator.



Danica,left behind in the silence of his words, sank heavily onto the sofa. Her mind spun with disorientation.



Since the accident, she had never seen Isaac speak with such force. It was as though the man she once knew before the tragedy had returned.



Her frown deepened; doubt gnawing at her heart.


Was the marriage with the Willis family truly a wise arrangement?



As these troubled thoughts circled, a voice from the stairwell broke her reverie.



"I warned you Verena wasn't decent, but you wouldn't listen.And now look-she's driven my brother to this."Bobby leaned against the railing, arms folded, gazing down at Danica.



Still shaken by her clash with Isaac, Danica snapped,"Enough! Hold your tongue." Bobby gave a mocking scoff, pretending indifference.

"Doesn't matter to me."



With that, he turned and went upstairs.



Yet once alone in his room, Bobby unlocked his phone and fired off a message to "Verena". "Congratulations.You've finally earned my mother's dislike. She no longer agrees to this marriage, so stop dreaming about being Isaac's wife-stop dreaming of becoming Mrs. Bennett."



Though he had heard every word lsaac spoke downstairs, he still sent the message, hoping to unsettle that woman he despised.



He could not fathom how his usually sharp brother had fallen for such a facade.







Fresh from her shower, Kaia noticed the new message on her alternate account.


Her eyes lit with excitement, and pride flickered across her face.



She had done nothing, yet Verena seemed on the verge of being cast aside by the Bennett family.



Now, with the Lyons family backing her and Verena rejected by the Bennetts, Kaia felt her fortunes soaring higher than ever.


Smirking, she lifted her chin with arrogant grace and replied to Bobby, "Whether your mother approves or not doesn't matter, so long as Isaac does."



Reading the reply, Bobby's face darkened.


Her words dripped with arrogance,and yet-he could not deny the bitter truth. If his brother chose to rebel,even their mother could not stop him.







Meanwhile, as Verena prepared the herbal ointment for lsaac, her phone rang.



She glanced at the caller ID, her brows lifting in surprise.



Danica?



During their earlier arranged meeting, under Laura's subtle persuasion, she and Danica had exchanged numbers. But they had never spoken since, and Verena had nearly forgotten she had her contact.



Why was Danica calling now?


Curious, Verena answered with polite warmth. "Hello,Mrs.Bennett. This is Verena. How may I help you?" Before dialing, Danica had steeled herself to speak with severity.


Yet hearing Verena's voice-gentle, courteous,almost smiling-gave her pause.



How could one lash out at such composure?


Suppressing her misgivings, Danica forced a smile. "If it's convenient, let's meet. I'llsend the address."


Verena's brows knitted faintly. The only subject between them was Isaac.



And if Danica sought her alone, it could hardly bode well.



Even so, she had no intention of shrinking away.Rather, she wanted to know Danica's true purpose.


So she answered evenly, "Very well, Mrs. Bennett. I'lL see you soon."



After hanging up, Verena freshened up quickly and left the hotel to hail a cab.


Danica had chosen a stylish café, where soft jazz played and the air felt tranquil.


Once Verena confirmed her name, a server guided her to a reserved window booth. By the time Danica appeared with her assistant,Verena had already finished half her coffee.



Verena rose gracefully, offering a polite nod."Good day, Mrs. Bennett. It's nice to see you again."



In truth, Danica had arrived earlier but lingered outside for twenty minutes, waiting to gauge Verena's patience.



By rumor, a woman of Verena's temperament would have been restless by then.


Yet what greeted her was a composed, courteous young woman, whose manners could not be faulted.



This unexpected poise unsettled Danica, compelling her to look closer.



Verena wore a white wool coat over a soft turtleneck,paired with slim jeans that shaped her figure.



Her subtle makeup brightened her smile, softening her already gentle features. She looked approachable,even disarming


Danica sighed inwardly. Outwardly, Verena looked every bit the perfect daughter-in-law of the Bennett family-except for the suspicion that her heart hid deceit. Casting aside such thoughts, Danica sat and forced a faint smile before asking bluntly, "Did you instruct Isaac to move against the Willis family?"


Move against the Willis family?



Her words confirmed what Verena had guessed



So Isaac had already taken steps.



Was it because of what he had promised her that day?



A warmth stirred in Verena's heart, touched by the knowledge that, memory or not, lsaac had always stood by her whenever she was wronged.



Though he had never spoken of his plans, she could see the reason clearly.



When she told him she had been cast out of her family, Isaac had vowed to handle it for her.


She had not expected him to act so swiftly.
###Chapter 60 What Did My Mother Tell You
Verena never asked Isaac to move against the Willis family, but he only did it for her sake.


For that reason, she offered no denial and gave Danica a small nod. "In a sense, yes."


When Danica pressed her lips together, Verena added with a faint smile, "Still, I doubt you asked me here only to talk about this matter."


Her voice carried a steady calm, revealing her knack for anticipating others' intentions while keeping her emotions firmly in check despite the sudden probing.


This level of composure was exactly what Danica respected most when dealing with people in business.


Danica studied her for a long moment before laughing lightly. "I don't know what kind of dispute exists between you and your family, but since your marriage to Isaac is already certain, have you thought about how others will judge you if he acts against your family? And how they might criticize him?"


Though spoken indirectly, the meaning was clear to Verena. "Are you suggesting I stop him?"she asked Danica inclined her head, looking satisfied. "You're quick to see my point."


In her mind, Verena's words meant agreement,and she assumed Verena would soon persuade Isaac to relent.


Verena lifted her cup, breathed in the coffee's scent,and then set it down again before meeting Danica's eyes with a serene smile. "Thank you for saying that.But the fact you came to me shows you've already argued with lsaac about this. I understand your concerns, yet lsaac is acting for my sake. I would never be ungrateful enough to stand in his way. So I'm afraid I won't stop him."


Danica's expression tightened, doubt clear in her eyes.She suspected Verena was using lofty words as a mask,hiding her real intentionto weaken the Willis family.To her, it was astonishing that someone so young could already be this calculating.


Danica's fingers curled more firmly around the cup handle as she said, "I never expected you to be this stubborn. Keep in mind, if lsaac truly destroys the Willis family, you'll be left with nothing to depend on in Shoildon."



When she finished speaking, Danica searched Verena's expression for a flicker of panic. In her eyes, the Willis family had always been Verena's foundation, both before and after her marriage.


The mention of "depend" drew a hint of amusement from Verena. From the age of seven, she had lived without her parents' affection. Alec and Laura had left her in Shawna's care, offering her only the bare minimum,nothing more.



Her move to ShoiIdon had been for one reason alone,to tie her to the Bennett family. Every word they ever spoke to her revolved around praising Kaia and Luka while pointing out her shortcomings.



Depend? In truth, she had never once known what it meant to rely on her parents.



Verena kept her expression soft and steady, her tone balanced between humility and confidence as she replied, "You're reading too much into it. The Willis family has never been my foundation-neither in the past,nor now, nor in the future. The only support I've ever truly had is myself."



A light laugh slipped from her lips as she added, "No,that isn't entirely true. I have lsaac now as well."



Danica looked at her in open surprise. Sitting tall with her slender back straight, Verena spoke with a calmness and poise that carried quiet conviction,persuasive without the slightest hint of agitation.


During the entire ten minutes they spoke, Verena never once faltered, carrying herself with composed elegance and flawless delivery.



A flicker of surprise passed through Danica as she took in the depth of Verena's character. She had expected Isaac's wife to be pliable and easily managed,someone incapable of exposing his vulnerabilities after marriage. Yet what parent wouldn't feel pride in seeing their son matched with a woman both intelligent and beautiful?



With her feelings tangled, Danica lifted her coffee,drank slowly, let out a quiet sigh, and rose from her seat. "Forget it. I'm old now. There are plenty of matters I'd rather not get involved in. The two of you can manage your own business."


Verena rose as well, giving her a courteous smile."Goodbye, Mrs. Bennett."



While returning to the Bennett Mansion, Danica's assistant kept glancing at her from the front seat,clearly holding back his words.



Noticing his hesitation, Danica said, "Go ahead, say what's on your mind."



Given the opening, the assistant finally spoke his doubts. "Will you truly overlook the Willis family's troubles and allow Miss Willis and Mr. Bennett to act without restraint?" Standing behind Danica in the coffee shop, he had caught every word exchanged between the two ladies.



"Act without restraint?" Danica repeated with a faint smile, her gaze drifting out the window. "Isaac is nothing like Bobby. He never makes a move without certainty. We're only speaking of the Willis family. If neither lsaac nor Verena is concerned, why should I risk discord with my own son over them?"



Business had always been Danica's compass, and she knew well what truly mattered.


Still unsatisfied, the assistant furrowed his brows."Didn't you intend for Miss Willis to stop Mr. Bennett from striking against the Willis family? Why back away now?"



Danica gave him a brief glance before responding,"Do you think I care so little for lsaac? He is my son.I won't damage our relationship for the sake of outsiders. Meeting Verena was only to measure her attitude toward Isaac's actions against the Willis family."



Understanding dawned at last, and the assistant nodded slowly.



That exchange had shifted Danica's perception of Verena entirely. The young woman was neither gullible nor easily swayed, and she was nothing like the ignorant figure painted by rumor. Following his most recent quarrel with Danica, Isaac ordered Jacob to keep watch over her schedule,making sure Verena would not be dragged into anything troublesome. The moment anything unusual occurred, it was to be reported to him at once.



The instant Isaac learned that Danica had scheduled a private meeting with Verena, his gaze sharpened.Without hesitation, he opened his contacts and dialed the first name on the list.


The line rang over and over without response,and by the time he lowered the phone slightly, sweat had already dampened his palm.



Isaac ended the call and immediately tried again,repeating the attempt again and again, only to meet silence each time.



At that same moment, Verena stood in the hotel corridor, searching through her bag for her key when her screen lit up, showing a list of missed calls.



Looking closer, she realized there were eight of them,every single one from lsaac.



Without delay, she pressed to return his call.


Just as Isaac was about to leave the office, with his car waiting below, his phone began to ring.



He stopped his wheelchair at once, grabbed the phone,and asked directly, "What did my mother tell you?"


Verena pushed open her hotel room door, only to hear lsaac's voice come through, carrying a faint edge of anxiety.



After hanging the key on the back of the door, she sat down at the desk, surprised by his tone."You already knew?"


Isaac confirmed it without hesitation before asking her, "What exactly did she say?"



Verena caught the tension in his voice and let a playful smile spread across her face. "You've been that concerned about me? You actually called more than once. Were you planning to show up at the hotel if I didn't pick up?"
###Chapter 61 Going To See Dr. Willis




Verena let out a regretful sigh. "Had I known, I would have ignored the calls, just so you'd come seeing me."



Isaac felt a sharp tingle in his ears at the sound of her soft tone, yet his chest tightened with urgency.He swallowed before saying in a hushed, firm voice,"Verena, I'm asking you something serious."


Realizing his concern was genuine, Verena dropped the teasing and said reassuringly, "Relax, your mother only asked me out for coffee. She didn't make things difficult."


Isaac struggled to accept that Danica would call Verena out without some serious purpose. Her calm words only stirred up a storm of uneasy possibilities in his mind.



He hesitated, and then asked with deliberate seriousness,"Did my mother... tell you to leave me?"

For a split second, Verena stood speechless. It dawned on her that lsaac was probably imagining one of those soap opera scenes where the male lead's mother marched in, tossed a check on the table, and snapped at the female lead, "Take it and stay away from my son!"


She laughed lightly and teased, "Isaac, have you been glued to soap operas lately?"


The easy, genuine laughter spilling from her lips showed Danica hadn't upset her in the slightest.Seeing she was mocking him, lsaac rubbed his eyebrow and mumbled, "I don't watch that stuff."


It was true he never watched such shows,but his nerves often pushed his mind toward unnecessary thoughts.


Verena lowered her gaze with a smile. She hadn't expected Isaac to worry for her this deeply, even without remembering their shared past, and the realization left her quietly content.


Isaac finally exhaled, relieved that his mother hadn't given Verena trouble."By the way," Verena said suddenly, recalling something. "I was wondering if you noticed any changes in that area when you woke up this morning."


The sudden shift in topic left Isaac taken aback for a brief moment.



Realizing she meant his condition, he pressed his lips together before answering simply, "No."


Verena went silent at his reply. With his situation,there should have been at least some small sign after the first use of the herbal ointment. Why was there none at all?



She asked again, "Did you feel even the slightest burning sensation?"


Isaac felt a chill run through him at her careful question.


He answered quietly, "No."


The call fell into silence, and Verena's voice did not come through. The room around him was so still that he could almost hear the pounding of his own heart.


Frustration pressed down on his chest until it was hard to breathe. Clenching his jaw, he blurted out,"When you worked with other patients, did they see results after only one treatment?"


Verena's shoulders sagged as she gave a grave reply."Yes."


She picked up on the sudden quiet on the other end and could tell lsaac was starting to worry, so she chimed in to ease his mind, "You don't need to be anxious. Everyone's body reacts in its own way..."


With near desperation, Isaac asked, "Have you ever had another case with no response at all, the way l am now?"



Verena's brows drew together. The word "yes"hovered on her lips, yet she couldn't bring herself to lie to him.



Tightening her fist, she lowered her voice and said,"No." Isaac said nothing, completely tuned out from whatever Verena was saying on the other end of the line. There wasn't a soul he could turn to. A flood of emotions such as shame, fear, uselessness, and a rising panic twisted through him like thick vines,tightening with every passing second as a bitter taste crept into his mouth.



Isaac lowered his head, the corners of his eyes rimmed with red, tears shining but refusing to fall.Had he been a fool to hope from the very beginning?He had swallowed countless pills, endured needle after needle, even gone under the knife, and still nothing had changed. Maybe he should never have started this endless road of treatment at all.


To him, staying by Verena's side while bound by his condition felt like he was only holding her back.


Isaac lowered his gaze, forced down the tightness in his throat, and quickly said, "Sorry, I've got something to handle. I'll contact you another time."


Verena parted her lips to respond, only to be met with the abrupt busy tone on the line. ···


Inside the Lyons family home...


"Slater, get changed into proper clothes. Put on something formal," Barrie said as he poulled his grandson toward his bedroom.



Slater had managed only two bites of his banana when Barrie snatched it away and threw it aside.


He wrinkled his brow in puzzlement. "Why, Grandpa?Isn't what I'm wearing good enough? Who are we meeting that makes you dress so formally? You're even in a suit."



Ever since his retirement, Barrie had preferred loose,casual wear and rarely bothered with such formal suits.


When Barrie mentioned the meeting two days earlier,he had told Slater only that they would see someone today, but he never revealed who it was.


Seeing Barrie dressed up so seriously and calling for the entire family to join, Slater's curiosity grew  sharper.


Barrie kept tugging at his grandson's clothes as he explained, "We're going to meet your grandfather's lifesaver, Dr.Willis."


"Dr. Willis!" Slater's eyes sparkled, and he asked with excitement, "Why didn't you tell me before? Where is she living? Is she also in Shoildon?"


His excitement rang too loudly, and Barrie gave him a push into the room. "You'll know once we arrive. For now,get yourself ready."


After shutting the door behind Slater, Barrie turned and spotted Fletcher approaching with his wife.


Fletcher was dressed in a dark suit, while Marietta Lyons wore a coordinating outfit that made her look elegant and proper.


Barrie's eyes went to Fletcher as he asked, "ls everything prepared?"


Fletcher gave a confident nod. "Rest assured. Allthe gifts you requested have been arranged exactly as you wanted."


Barrie's face lit with satisfaction as he gave a nod of approval. Turning to the butler, he said, "Call the Willis family and tell them we're on our way."


With a slight nod, the butler said, "Yes." He then turned and walked inside to place the call.


The Lyons family's household was already full of movement, but over at theWillis Villa, the pace was even more relentless.


"Careful there, scrub the corners of that flower bed properly."


"Start on the stair railings-wipe them with a damp cloth first, and then dry them off thoroughly."


"Remove those coffee beans and replace them with the premium batch."


From the living room, Laura's voice echoed as she rattled off one order after another.


Even though the servants had already scrubbed the villa spotless the previous day, Laura demanded it be cleaned all over again.


"Laura." Alec came down the staircase while fussing with his tie. "Come see-how does this outfit look?Do you think the tie is too bold?"


Laura stepped over, fixed his tie with her hands, and smiled. "No, this looks refined. Today's just a private gathering, so there's no need to be overly formal."


Alec grinned in relief at her answer. "Good, good,then I'll wear this."


Laura, brimming with excitement, quickly asked,"And what about my outfit today?"


She stood there in a fine dress draped with an elegant shawl, radiating both affluence and poise.
###Chapter 62 Something They Both Cared About





At Laura's question, Alec broke into a hearty laugh,the creases around his eyes deepening. "You're absolutely dazzling."


When it came to something they both cared about,they looked like newlyweds still wrapped up in the glow of their honeymoon.


Both understood that today marked a turning point for their standing in Shoildon. After all, Barrie's decision to visit their home with his family was no ordinary honor.


Word in Shoildon never stayed secret for long, and they were certain the elite circles would soon buzz with news of this visit.



The butler approached quickly, voice laced with respect. "Mr. Willis, Mrs. Willis, I've just been informed by the Lyons family's butler that Mr. Barrie  Lyons and his household are already on their way."


Excitement flashed in Alec's eyes as he met Laura's gaze, and then motioned to the butler. "Quickly,make sure the refreshments are ready."


A slight furrow appeared on Laura's brow. "I'll see what's keeping Kaia. Why isn't she downstairs yet?"


Alec gave a quick nod. "Yes, bring her down right away."


They couldn't have been prouder of Kaia. Without her talent, a connection with the Lyons family-especially on such favorable terms-would have been unthinkable.


Clicking up the stairs in her heels, Laura's excitement got the better of her, and she pushed open the door without a knock.


"Kaia, why are you still dawvdling? Barrie and his family will be here any minute," Laura exclaimed.


As she approached the vanity, Laura's eyes gleamed with pride at the sight of her daughter.  Kaia wore a pale blue strapless gown draped with a white fur coat, her look both graceful and striking.


"My goodness, you'd outshine anyone no matter what you wore," Laura said warmly as she smoothed Kaia's sleek hair.


Lifting a perfume bottle, Kaia spritzed her wrist and dabbed it behind her ear, a smug smile tugging at her lips. "Mom, people have admired me since I was little. Haven't you gotten used to it by now?"


Laura's eyes shone with satisfaction. "Yes, yes, your beauty is endless. But hurry now. Barrie is an elder,and it wouldn't be right to make him wait."


With her chin tipped upward, Kaia muttered,"Alright."




Still, inside, Kaia dismissed Laura's caution. Elder or not, she had saved Barrie's life. Was there any need to tremble before him?


The man struggled with long-term illnesses, and she had practically pulled him back from the brink. Even if she carried herself with a touch of arrogance, who could fault her? Yet she understood why Laura pressed for humility-their family's position still couldn't measure up.







A sleek black vehicle belonging to the Lyons family eased around the bend and rolled into the driveway of the Willis Villa.



From the entrance of the main house, the Willis butler spotted the vehicle and hurried back inside to deliver the news.



With excitement in his voice, he announced to Alec,"The Lyons' vehicle has just pulled in-our guests are here."



Springing from the sofa, Alec turned to Laura on the sofa and Kaia, who had just stepped down the staircase. "Come on, let's greet Barrie and his family properly. We have to show them respect."


Laura rose to join him, but Kaia walked to the sofa and sat down, smoothing her hair with one hand and resting the other on her lap. "You two go ahead. I'l stay here."


Laura's face showed bewilderment, while Alec assumed Kaia was growing arrogant because of Barrie's regard for her.


With a faint scowl, Alec warned, "Kaia, this won't do.Even if you treated Barrie's leg, you must stilI act with humility before someone older."


Kaia pushed out her lower lip. "That's not what I meant, Dad. I just don't want it to look like I'm desperate to butter up the Lyons family. Go on without me.I'll wait here."


Though Alec felt like continuing the lecture,he cut himself short with the Lyons family at the door."Forget it," he muttered, striding outside with Laura.


Inside the vehicle, as the driver looked for a spot to park, the Lyons family of four carried on a lively conversation.


From the inside pocket of his suit jacket,Fletcher drew out a sleek black-gold card and looked at Barrie, saying, "Dad, I wasn't around when Dr. Willis  treated you, but Slater was inconsiderate and failed to thank her properly. Since we're going in person this time, I intend to do it right."


Slater immediately protested, his eyes flicking to the card. "Inconsiderate? That's unfair, Dad. If you want to thank Dr. Willis, money isn't the way. She's not like the others-she's more like those legendary doctors from novels who couldn't care less about riches.Grandpa once tried to offer her a generous sum. She turned it down, saying she'd been paid her fee and didn't need anything else."
###Chapter 63 Dr. Willis Is Alec's Daughter





Slater let out a dreamy sigh. "If Dr. Willis actually liked me, marrying her would be a good choice to thank her properly."


Laughter erupted from Barrie as he turned to Slater and said, "That's not going to work on me. I'm wise to all your frivolous behavior, you brat. There's no way I'd let Dr. Willis end up upset."


Slater grabbed at his chest with an exaggerated look of pain. "Grandpa, how could you accuse me like that?"


At that moment, the driver pulled the car to a stop and swung open the rear door.


Marietta reached over with a smile, giving Slater a pat as he sat by the door. "That's enough nonsense.Out you go." Slater straightened up and unfolded his long legs as he climbed out. When his eyes landed on the building ahead, a strange familiarity hit him,especially when he spotted the fountain close by.



Assuming his memory hadn't failed him, he was pretty sure he had seen that same spot before in one of Kaia's posts online.


Slater blinked in shock. "What are we doing at the Willis family'shouse?"


Barrie leaned against his cane with a chuckle. "You mean you didn't know? Dr. Willis is Alec Willis'daughter."


Slater froze in astonishment. "Dr. Willis is Alec's daughter?"


The Willis family had two girls. One was Kaia, the one he was familiar with.



The other was Verena, who had only just come back from the countryside.


Since he already knew Kaia, that left only one possibility...


Hold on a second!


Could the eldest daughter of the Willis family, the one who had come back from the countryside,actually be Dr.Willis?


Slater's mind spun in a storm of disbelief,overflowing with exclamation marks and question marks.


If Dr. Willis truly turned out to be Verena,then he had already badmouthed her more than once behind her back.


Impossible! Anyone who had spoken ill of Verena must have been spreading lies.


Slater resolved on the spot that he had to apologize to Dr. Willis without delay.


"Mr. Lyons, at last you've arrived." A lively male voice cut into Slater's thoughts, and when he lifted his head, Alec and Laura were already waiting near the car."You're looking as strong and spirited as ever, Mr.Lyons," Alec said to Barrie with a broad smile.


Barrie chuckled in good humor. "That's kind of you,but I'm getting on in years-I can't go anywhere without this cane."


Fletcher stepped forward, offering his hand. "Mr.Willis, I've heard a great deal about you."


A spark of surprise flashed in Alec's eyes-this was the CEO of the renowned Avalon Group, a man he seldom had the chance to meet. Yet today, Fletcher was greeting him with such warmth.


Alec clasped his hand without hesitation. "I've long wanted to meet you, Mr. Lyons. It's truly a pleasure to at last."



Laura reached for Marietta's hand with familiar warmth, speaking as though they were longtime acquaintances. "So the final scarf from S&F found its way to you, Mrs. Lyons. It suits your delicate skin beautifully. I'm glad it wasn't mine-it would have been wasted on me." This was Marietta's first time meeting Laura, and she thought her manner a touch excessive.


Even so, because Laura was the mother of the doctor who had saved Barrie, Marietta let the familiarity pass without complaint.


With a pleasant smile, she answered, "I actually own another scarf just like this one. If it pleases you, Mrs.Willis, I'll have it sent over."


Laura gave no clear response but shifted the subject toward Slater instead. "Slater really is impressive. It's no wonder the girls in Shoildon admire him so much."


Caught off guard by the mention, Slater cast Laura a conflicted glance. If Dr. Willis ever learned the things he'd said about her, the shame would be unbearable.


He came to a firm conclusion that he needed to apologize before she learned the truth on her own.Lost in thought, Slater gave a half-hearted greeting to Laura and said, "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Willis."


Slater kept stretching his neck, trying to get a glimpse into the house, and Alec caught on right away. With a teasing grin, he said, "Slater, looks like you're pretty eager to catch sight of my daughter,aren't you?"


A faint flush crept over Slater's cheeks as he rubbed the back of his head. "I guess I am a little eager."


Naturally, his nerves were high-after all, he had spoken poorly of Verena more than once, and the weight of guilt pushed him to hurry with an apology.


Watching the young man's flustered behavior, Alec gave a satisfied nod.


Inside, Laura was thrilled, convinced that Slater's blush was proof of affection for Kaia.


He might not hold the same brilliance as the Bennett brothers, yet the Lyons family's influence in Shoildon could not be questioned.


Should Kaia marry Slater, his straightforward personality would ensure he remained completely under her sway.


And with Kaia credited for Barrie's recovery, the Willis family's standing in Shoildon would be unshakable.


Holding back her rising joy, Laura said brightly,"Enough waiting outside, let's head in."


The moment the words left her mouth, Slater bolted straight inside.


Pointing at Slater's back, Barrie murmured,"That boy never knows how to slow down."


Alec, aware of Slater's eagerness to see Kaia,chuckled and said, "He's still young-recklessness suits him."


Inside the house, Slater spotted Kaia seated quietly on the sofa.


Kaia's eyes caught his; she smiled softly and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.


Instead of greeting her, Slater began pacing about,stretching his neck as though hunting for someone.


Puzzled, Kaia's brows furrowed as she asked,"Slater, what are you trying to find?" He shot her a quick look but kept silent, still scanning the room.


His indifference deepened Kaia's frown, a trace of irritation flickering in her gaze.


This time, her voice sharpened as she repeated, "Tell me, what exactly are you searching for?"


Finally stopping, Slater turned to her and asked directly, "Where is your elder sister?"


Verena?


A flicker of disdain crossed Kaia's expression before she smoothed it over.


Sitting upright, she replied with a sharp edge, "She isn't home."


Confusion clouded Slater's face as his brows drew tight. "Not home? What reason would she have to be away?"


Watching his obvious concern at the mention of Verena, Kaia's irritation flared, and she snapped,"She's hardly that important. Why should it matter whether she's here or not?"


Slater's tone sharpened as his voice rose. "Of course it matters. The reason we came here today was to meet your sister. How could you say she isn't important?"


His words echoed across the living room, reaching Barrie, who was just stepping through the doorway.


With two firm taps of his cane, Barrie's stern voice cut through the air. "Slater, lower your voice. Where are your manners?"


Slater cast a frustrated glance at Kaia before leaning close to Barrie and whispering, "Grandpa, Dr. Willis isn't here."



Dr. Willis? Alec and Laura, standing near Barrie,caught the words clearly.


A sharp pang of unease struck Alec the moment he heard it.



Laura, on the other hand, brushed it off and beckoned Kaia to her side. Pulling her daughter close, Laura smiled warmly at Slater. "You really do spoil my Kaia. She's still in medical school, not yet a doctor. But she's bright and skilled, and if your grandfather ever needs medical help,you can count on her."

###Chapter 64 A Misunderstanding




Kaia had basked in praise all her life, yet today's compliment struck her heart like a long-awaited triumph.


It felt sweeter than all the others, a mixture of joy and relief, as though she had finally found a steadfast ally in Barrie. She even wondered if those rich ladies who once looked down on her for her modest background would still dare to sneer.


Her heart fluttered, but on the surface she wore calm composure.


Stepping forward with a gentle smile and a well-mannered tone, Kaia addressed Barrie.


"Indeed, Mr. Lyons. I heard before about your serious leg ailment. Had I known earlier that the herbs and supplements I prepared could help, I would never have waited until your son and daughter-in-law's wedding anniversary to send them. I would have delivered them right away, sparing you so much pain."




Her lips curved gracefully, yet she remained unaware of the strange looks exchanged among the Lyons family at her words.


Barrie's brows drew together, his gaze shadowed with regret.


Like fire erupting from a mountain, Slater burst out."Herbs and supplements? What are you talking about? My grandfather's leg was healed through Dr.Willis' careful treatment, step by step. Stop dressing yourself in borrowed robes! Those so-called herbs and supplements you speak of were passed on to the servants the very night they arrived."


He paused, and then shot Kaia a scornful glance."So you really believed it was you who cured my grandfather's leg?"


The mockery was sharp, and the Willis family's faces turned ashen, drained of color.


The truth was plain: Kaia had not cured Barrie. It was nothing more than a misunderstanding.


The Willis family had clung to the false notion that a few boxes of herbs and supplements could undo decades of suffering. They had mistaken wishful thinking for reality.


Alec looked at Kaia with a heavy expression, the weight of disappointment clear in his eyes.


Kaia herself stood pale and shaken, disbelief flickering across her face.


Her brows trembled as she recalled the sight of Verena at Barrie's residence that evening.


Could it be that Verena was the very Dr. Willis they now spoke of? The healer who had restored Barrie?


Kaia's heart resisted the thought. To her, Verena had only learned a few skills from a self-taught practitioner in the backwater place.


Yet reality pressed in-uncomfortable, undeniable.They shared the same surname, and Verena had indeed been at the Lyons home that evening. The thought made Kaia's chest tighten; her hands clenched so hard that her nails cut into her palms.


If Verena truly was the one who healed Barrie,Kaia resolved to bury it deep.


Even if she had to swallow her pride and shoulder the blame herself, she would never allow the Lyons family to find out Verena was the Dr. Willis they spoke of.That, she decided, was a price worth paying.


Biting down hard on the inside of her cheek, Kaia forced herself to bow before Barrie.


Her voice trembled wvith contrition. "Mr. Lyons, I truly apologize. After I sent the gifts, I saw Slater's post online and mistakenly believed I had been the one to cure your leg. It was my mistake, and I am deeply sorry."


From their exchange, Barrie pieced together the truth.




Though disappointment touched him, his good manners kept his face composed. He gave Kaia a measured glance but withheld any reply. Instead, he sighed softly and turned to Alec."Mr. Willis, since Dr. Willis isn't here, let's not trouble you further."


Then, signaling to Fletcher and the others, he added,"Let's head home."


Embarrassment weighed heavily on Alec, but he still had one matter he dared not leave unspoken.


With a forced smile, he followed and said, "Mr. Lyons,about the club..."


Barrie, without turning, raised his hand in dismissal."Mr. Willis, not today. There's no need to see us out."






The ride home was cloaked in silence.


Slater leaned his arm against the window, his brows drawn as he wrestled with his thoughts about Dr.Willis' whereabouts. He hadn't seen her since she completed the final treatment for his grandfather.


He had hoped to thank her face-to-face, but today's visit had been fruitless. Her phone was disconnected, the number invalid.


Oddly enough, he felt a trace of relief that the Willis family had mistaken Kaia for the healer. At least that proved Dr. Willis wasn't one of them-just a woman who happened to share the surname.


And since Bobby's influence had long soured his opinion of the Willis family, Slater found comfort in that fact.


Fortunately, Dr. Willis had no ties to them at all.
###Chapter 65 Seeing Isaac





Inside the Willis Villa, the family gathered in the living room.


On the couch, Alec, Laura, and Kaia sat in tense silence, shame and irritation plain on their faces.


What had begun as a hopeful plan had collapsed into disaster. The problem of the club remained unsolved,and worse, they had made a fool of themselves in front of the Lyons family.


The more Alec dwelled on it, the harder it became to restrain his temper.


His gaze fixed on Kaia, stripped of the warmth it once carried.


"Do you see what mess you've caused? You rushed in without knowing the truth and snatched the credit for yourself. A little praise has gone to your head, and now you believe you're brilliant, don't you? Did you really think a handful of herbs and supplements would heal Barrie's leg? How unfortunate that I have such a stupid daughter."


Running a hand through his hair, Alec let out a sharp breath before saying firmly, "This won't work. We must bring Verena back at once-she's the only one who can fix this. Laura, tomorrow you'll apologize to her properly and make peace with her."


Laura's face darkened at his demand. The memory of her last humiliating apology was still raw, and she had no desire to suffer through it again.


Unable to stomach Kaia's humiliation, Laura snapped back, her voice laced with sarcasm. "You never fail to strike when the timing hurts most, Alec. What kind of father tears down his own daughter like this? You were the one praising Kaia's wit before, and now you turn against her. None of us could have foreseen this outcome. She only wanted to help you,even if she was reckless about it. You claim she isn't clever-are you saying Verena is any better? They're both your children, so if blame is handed out, it should fall on both. At least Kaia doesn't drag trouble into this house." 
Laura let out a bitter laugh and added sharply, "And donn't forget the reason the entertainment venue was closed in the first place. That's on Verena, the one who grew up in the rural backwater under your mother's care."



The moment Verena's name was spoken, Alec froze as a sudden idea surfaced.


He realized then why Barrie had confused Kaia with the doctor who treated his leg-the physician carried the same last name, Willis.


Back in the countryside, Verena had actually practiced medicine.


A startling possibility formed in Alec's mind.


For a few moments, Alec said nothing, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. Finally, he turned to Laura and asked, "Could it be that the doctor Barrie spoke of was Verena?"



The question caught Laura off guard, and her expression  faltered with shock. After a pause, she murmured, "That would be too much of a coincidence, wouldn't it? Are you saying Verena might have that kind of ability?"


The couple looked at each other, uncertainty weighing heavily in their eyes, while Kaia sat frozen,staring at them without blinking.


Kaia couldn't shake the sting of Alec's harsh words as they echoed again in her head.


She balled her fists,and the bitterness in her eyes revealed just how deeply her resentment ran.


As Alec and Laura spoke, a sobering truth dawned on her.


She understood then that her ambitions would only come to life if she carved her own path.


In Laura's eyes, her worth lay only in how much honor she could bring to the Willis name.


No matter the gentle tone or the outward kindness,when it truly mattered, Laura always placed Luka above Kaia.



She k<new the family fortune was destined to end up under Luka's control.


Alec measured his children by usefulness alone,giving approval only to the one who could profit him most.



When she pictured Verena marrying into the Bennett family, jealousy burned hot inside her chest.


It was for that reason she couldn't stomach the idea of Verena living happily.


What she feared most was being branded the most worthless member of the family.


Her cheeks quivered as she forced a smile, and then she turned to Alec and Laura. "Dad, Mom,really?Verena never even made it into college. Everything she knows comes from tagging along with some backwoods healer in the countryside. Even top specialists failed with Mr. Lyons' leg. If I couldn't treat him, then Verena definitely couldn't either."


Laura, who had wavered a moment ago, quickly found comfort in Kaia's reasoning. "Kaia's right.Verena doesn't have that kind of talent. She never studied in college, and she's never even touched proper medical training. At best, she knows how to treat a cold. The name Willis is too common; it could be anyone else. You're just clutching at straws, Alec."


She shot him a sharp glance, her tone cutting.


Nothing seemed more ridiculous than thinking Verena was the doctor responsible for Barrie's recovery. Her bragging about being a Pine Hill University graduate was just as laughable.







Once he got home, Slater immediately picked up the phone, eager to unload the day's fiasco on Bobby.


"You won't believe what a ridiculous thing happened today, Bobby. Can you even guess?"


His voice rose with energy. "We went to meet Dr.Willis. But when I got there, I realized it was Kaia's family. For a moment, I thought, wait-could this Dr.Willis actually be that Verena Willis I've never met?And then you won't believe what followed." At the sound of Verena's name, Bobby leaned in,eager. "So what happened?"


With a chuckle, Slater shook his head. "Verena wasn't there, but Kaia was. The funniest part? She actually convinced herself she cured my grandfather's leg. As if! Dr. Willis has nothing to do with their family, let alone being Verena. They thought Kaia was the doctor. Can you believe that?It's laughable."


Kaia's name didn't hold Bobby's attention, so he brushed right past it.


He smirked at Slater. "You can't be serious. How could anyone even compare my perfect sister-in-law with that sharp-tongued Verena? Come on, they're nothing alike. No way Dr. Willis is her."


At that very moment, Verena-the one they were talking about-sat at the desk in her hotel room.


Piles of paperwork lay before her, most of it business carried over from abroad.

 
When the last page was in order, she rolled her neck, flexed her wrists, and glanced at the time on her phone.


It struck her then that lsaac hadn't reached out since their last conversation, and each time she tried calling, his assistant had picked up instead.


Their most recent talk about his health still lingered in her mind; his tone had been heavy, as if weighed down by feelings he couldn't voice.


She wondered if he had slipped back into overthinking everything.


The decision came quickly-she had to go see him in person.


Acting on impulse, Verena swapped into fresh clothes, took her keycard, and headed down to the hotel's underground garage.


Waiting for her in the dim lot was her newly bought silver-gray car.


She slid behind the wheel and drove straight toward the Bennett Mansion. 
When she arrived at the mansion, she parked stepped out, and walked up to the front gates.


Andres Cruz, the Bennett butler, appeared from inside and asked with courtesy, "Miss, may I ask who you're here to visit?"


She greeted him with a calm smile. "My name is Verena Willis. I've come to see lsaac."



The mention of her name made Andres pause, his eyes narrowing as he studied her carefully.


What he saw was a young woman whose gaze carried warmth and quiet composure.


The poise in her manner, coupled with her quiet elegance, clashed sharply with the cold and selfish reputation the rumors had spread.


Years of experience told Andres right away that such rumors about her were nothing more than empty talk.
###Chapter 66 Committed Myself To You





Andres smiled at Verena. "Please allow me to go in and announce your arrival, Miss Willis."


Verena gave a slight nod. "I appreciate your help."


Andres turned, entered the house, and went upstairs,halting before lsaac's door.


He knocked twice-silence answered.


He knocked again, yet the room remained still.


Just as he raised his hand to try once more, a voice,cold as steel in winter, cut through the silence. "Who is it?"



The words were few, but the chill in them pierced like ice.


Andres instantly sensed Isaac's fou mood.


With due respect, Andres answered, "Mr. Bennett,Miss Verena Willis is here to see you. She's at the gates. Shall I invite her in?"


Verena?



She was at the gates?


Isaac's head, which had been bowed low, suddenly lifted, his gaze locking on the closed door before him.


He had spent the whole day in that room, doing nothing but staring at his crippled state.


When Verena's name was mentioned, his heart thundered, and then clenched painfully as if gripped by an unseen fist.


At that moment, he understood his feelings with painful clarity.


He liked Verena-and he knew she felt something for him,too.


Yet he also knew that no emotion ever sprang up without roots.



He admired her character, treasured the way shetreated him differently from how others did to him.


He liked her gentle, intelligent manner, the kind that drew admiration wherever she went.



But what about him? What reason could she possibly have to love him?


He was a man bound to the wheelchair,shackled by personal challenges. What could she see in him besides his name and background?


It wasn't that lsaac lacked self-respect; it was that her sudden affection felt too abrupt, too fragile.


If his legs could ever be healed, he would not mind her initial intentions.


But that hope was a distant star-barely within sight.


What right did he have to expect Verena to stay with him for a lifetime?


The weight on his chest felt like a millstone,suffocating him with every breath.


He lowered his head again, eyes shimmering faintly,  his throat swollen with unshed words, each one painful to release. "Tell her I'm already asleep."


Andres caught the strange note in lsaac's voice.Though he longed to persuade him, experience told him not to meddle.


So he simply nodded. "Got it, Mr. Bennett. I'll inform Miss Willis right away."


As Andres' footsteps retreated, Isaac closed his eyes, battling the storm of bitterness within.


His hands, resting on his useless legs, slowly curled into fists.



They trembled under the strain, veins rising against the skin.



After a long struggle, he resisted the burning urge to call Andres back and let Verena in.


Before Andres could head downstairs with the message, Bobby appeared and blocked his way.


Andres turned, puzzled. "Mr. Bennett, what can I do for you?" Moments earlier, Bobby had been on the phone with Slater. Heading for water, he had spotted Andres outside his brother's door.


He had approached, overheard their exchange, and quickly muttered to Slater, "Something urgent has come up-we'll talk later."


He had cut the line without waiting for an answer.


Stopping Andres, Bobby threw a glance at lsaac's firmly closed door before asking quietly, "Is Verena outside?"



Although uncertain why Bobby brought her up,Andres nodded honestly. "Yes, she is."


Bobby broke into a sly grin. So Isaac had finally seen Verena's true colors.



"My brother's clearly awake, yet he tells you to say he's asleep. Do you know what that means? It means he's tired of her and doesn't wish to see her. Unless absolutely necessary, he won't even give her the time of day. That's why he made up an excuse to avoid her." Wearing mock regret, Bobby leaned closer and whispered, "Just go to the gates and tell V/erena straight out that my brother doesn't want to see her,and she should leave."



Andres frowned. Something about Bobby's reasoning felt wrong.


He hesitated. "Mr. Bennett, isn't that a little improper?"


"What's improper about it?" Bobby clicked his tongue. "Andres, you're old enough to know when to adapt."


Seeing Andres still uneasy, Bobby thumped his chest confidently. "Just do as I say. If anything comes of it,I'll take responsibility."


Andres finally yielded. "Alright. I'll follow your instructions, Mr. Bennett."


As Andres walked downstairs, Bobby whistled lightly and strolled back into his room.


Outside, Andres bowed slightly and, as Bobby had ordered, told Verena, "I'm sorry, Miss Willis. Mr.Bennett said he doesn't want to see you. Please leave."



Verena's eyes narrowed. She didn't believe Isaac had uttered those words.


Then again... perhaps he had. Isaac was not one to speak harshly, but in a moment of despair, he might say those words to turn her away.


She remembered the hoarseness in his voice that day on the phone, and a sharp sting pricked her nose.


Blinking, she steadied herself and looked at Andres."Forgive me, but I must intrude."


She slipped past him and dashed into the house.


As she passed, Andres heard her murmur, "I want to hear lsaac say it himself."


Still stunned, Andres watched her pause midway and ask, "By the way, which room is Isaac's?"


Faced with her resolve, he recalled Isaac's strained tone and pointed upstairs. "The room at the far left on the second floor."



Verena smiled gratefully. "Thank you."


She hurried upstairs and found the room.


Knocking firmly, she called, "Isaac, open the door!"


Inside, Isaac's spine went rigid, but he made no move, thinking his ears deceived him.



"I'm Verena, Isaac. Open the door." Her voice was muffled by the heavy wood, but it carried through.


Slowly, Isaac lifted his head, eyes fixed on the sliver of light beneath the door, as if confirming reality.


His room was dark, and the faint glow outside cast a small shadow.


Verena was truly there.


She was at his door.


Isaac dropped his gaze again and said nothing.


Verena, realizing his deliberate stillness, spoke firmly. "lsaac, have you forgotten everything we talked about? Just because you face difficulties, you retreat? You think by shutting me out, I'll simply give up?"


Isaac's eyes stayed locked on the faint shadow beneath the door. He longed to tell her to leave,yet his throat closed with emotion.


Before her, he could not summon a single harsh word.




Verena stood before the sealed door, her gaze steady, her tone unwavering.


"Listen to me, Isaac. I've already committed myself to you. If you won't open this door, then I'll wait right here.I can outlast you, no matter how long it takes."
###Chapter 67 Do You Truly Have The Heart To Wound Me





Committed herself to him...


When lsaac heard those words, his heart tightened suddenly, a sharp pang cutting through his chest as though something inside was being torn apart.


He remembered Verena once telling him, "You're the only one I choose."


Wherever, whenever-she had always given him a clear, unwavering answer, with the kind of certainty that left no room for doubt.


Verena was braver than him, carrying a courage he could only admire from a distance.


Isaac's fingers curled slightly, his Adam's apple rising and falling as he swallowed the bitterness that pressed at his heart.


With a faint push, he rolled his wheelchair forward.  Verena caught the sound of wheels moving and knew at once that Isaac was coming to open the door.



She let out a small sigh of relief.


Click!



The door swung open from within.



"Isaac,you-"


"You should leave now." Isaac cut her words short before they could fully form.



Frowning, Verena lowered her gaze to him.


There he sat, in his wheelchair, hands gripping the wheels, head bowed, his back slightly hunched.


Loneliness and desolation clung to him like a shadow.



Staring at his lowered head, Verena spoke with quiet firmness. "If you've got something to say, then look me in the eye when you say it."



Isaac's hands tightened on his lifeless legs. With visible effort, he raised his heavy eyelids. The door stood open, letting the light from the hallway spill in, faintly brightening the darkened room.


At the doorway, Verena stood outlined in that light,her hair shimmering as strands caught a golden glow.


She looked radiant, like the sun breaking through on a winter morning-so dazzling that lsaac longed to draw near and hold on.


His Adam's apple moved again. Forcing calm into his tone, he spoke softly. "Yes, I am retreating. As you said, my condition has made me timid. But the reason I chose to let you go... is because I've come to realize many things."


Verena pressed on, her voice steady, "And what things are those?"


Meeting her gaze, Isaac deliberately said in a distant tone, "You know I'm crippled, unable to father a child. Yet you still insist on marrying me, on loving me. Isn't it because of my family background and power?" With those words, he lost the courage to keep looking at her. He deliberately turned his wheelchair away.


He expected her anger-expected her to flare up, to lash out at such a cruel accusation. But silence followed instead.



Isaac wondered, was she too furious to even speak?


Of course. What girl wouldn't be offended when accused of such motives?


His jaw tightened, a suffocating ache spreading in his chest, as though the very air threatened to choke him.


In truth, he wanted to tell her he loved her, regardless of her intentions.


But deep down, he felt he did not deserve her.


Hearing his words, Verena chuckled lightly, her understanding of him sharp enough to pierce straight through his disguise.


She could tell in an instant when his words were  deliberate, not genuine.


Smiling faintly, she said, "You're saying all this just to provoke me, hoping I'll walk away without looking back, and never reach out to you again, isn't that right?"


Isaac froze, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.After all those words, wasn't she supposed to be furious?



Why...was she smiling instead?


She stepped closer with light movements, stopping behind him.



Then she wrapped her arms around his neck,bending down to embrace him.


"Your words cut deep, Isaac. But tell me-are you really willing to let it end like this?"


Her lips nearly brushed his ear, her voice low, tender,yet deliberately stirring. "Do you truly have the heart to wound me, to drive me away, let me belong to someone else-hold another man, kiss him, and be with him as I am with you?"


Her hand glided to his face, fingertips grazing his skin before lingering on his burning earlobe.


Her voice was gentle, yet her words carried the sting of a blade wrapped in silk, slicing him little by little.


Isaac's breath hitched. Each word weighed on him like chains.


Did he have the heart to do such a thing?


No...he did not.



Even the thought alone was enough to drive him to madness.



Verena tilted her head, watching his jaw tremble, his eyes rimmed in red.


Through his lashes, his dark eyes shone with wetness-like he had been holding back tears.


Her heart trembled at the sight, and she tightened her hold on him, her voice now soothing as a lullaby."Then let go of these needless fears, Isaac.Please?"  Her lingering voice brushed against his ear, sending warmth coursing into his once-cold limbs.


Being held so tightly from behind-this was a feeling he had never known before.


And though a trace of the night chill still clung to Verena,Isaac felt warmer than ever.


It was as if his restless heart, long wandering,had finally found a harbor where it could rest. 
###Chapter 68 Shackles





Isaac longed to nod and agree with Verena, to promise her that he would try to let go of his fears.


Yet deep down, he knew such a promise was a lie he could never keep.



His worries were not idle fancies-they were storms that lived within him.



His life had veered off course in that single heartbeat of the car accident.


Even now, he could still see it clearly: his father lying in a pool of blood, that dreadful sight engraved in his mind like a scar carved in stone.



His father had shielded him, and before darkness swallowed him, lsaac heard the frantic cries of strangers.



"This young man's legs are bleeding heavily!" "If the ambulance doesn't come soon, he'll lose both legs!"


"Forget the legs-if he survives, it will be a miracle."


"How pitiful!"


The voices grew faint as lsaac sank into unconsciousness.


When his eyes opened again, an entire month had slipped away.


He woke beneath a stark white ceiling, the pungent sting of disinfectant filling his lungs, his dizzy head throbbing in protest.


His lips were parched, the corner of his mouth cracked and raw. He moistened them with his tongue, intending to rise from bed for a sip of water.


But as he threw aside the covers, a chilling realization struck-his legs refused to obey.


Frowning, he pushed himself up with his arms,summoning every ounce of upper body strength to move. The bandages around his head were blotched with blood, and sweat trickled down his jawline as his trembling arms bore the strain.


Still, his legs lay motionless, as though they had been erased from his body.


At that moment, Isaac sensed the cruel truth, though his heart refused to accept it.


Clutching the edge of the bed, he tried to roll off. But after lying still for a month, his body was too frail.He collapsed to the floor, knocking over the glass of water on the nightstand.


The glass shattered, and his palms pressed into the shards. Crimson spread across the pale floor in an instant.



The sight tore open an old wound-his father's bloodied face on that fateful day.


Isaac choked back a sob, not from the sting in his hands, but from the lifeless weight of his legs.


His face drained of color, sweat soaking his hospital gown.


The most terrifying part was this: all his strength had been spent simply getting out of bed, and now he could not move at all.


Blood streamed from his palms, yet his lower body lay unresponsive, a dead weight.


For the first time in his life, Isaac tasted the bitter truth of helplessness.


"Mr. Bennett!" The door flew open, and a young man in a caregiver's uniform froze in shock.


He quickly set down the basin of water he carried and rushed to lsaac's side.


Danica had hired him as Isaac's private caregiver. He had only stepped out for a moment, never imagining disaster would strike in those few minutes.


He pressed the call button and struggled to lift Isaac back onto the bed.


Moments later, a doctor strode in, followed by two nurses. "Mr.Bennett, you're finally awake," the doctor said with a relieved smile.


The nurses worked quietly, tending to his wounds and wrapping his hands in bandages.


Isaac leaned against the headboard, jaw clenched.


He closed his eyes halfway and asked in a hoarse voice, "Doctor, how long until my legs recover?"


"Well..." The doctor hesitated, regret darkening his face. At last, he sighed. "At present, it's unlikely they will recover."


Isaac's chest heaved, emotions surging like a storm.His eyes snapped open. "What did you say?"


The doctor lowered his head, his compassion plain.


Isaac stared blankly, unable to move, unable to breathe. At last he muttered, "I want surgery. Do the surgery...please, do it."


"Mr.Bennett, the surgery was performed a month ago. Your legs are in the best state they can be." "I want surgery! Do the surgery again!"


Deaf to reason, Isaac flung back the covers,attempting to rise.


"Hold him down! Quickly!" the doctor barked.


The two nurses and the caregiver pinned Isaac back to the bed.



"Isaac!" Danica burst into the room, breathless from rushing over. Seeing her son restrained, she turned to the doctor in alarm. "Dr. Loftus, what's happening?"


Alick Loftus pursed his lips, answering gravely, "Mr.Bennett has just woken up. He cannot accept his condition and is emotionally unstable. Please, Mrs.Bennett, talk to him."


Danica nodded, her voice soft but firm. "I understand. Thank you."


With her consent, the doctor signaled the others,and they quietly left the room.


Now only mother and son remained. "Isaac, you're finally awake."


Danica stepped forward, stroking his hollowed cheeks. Her nose reddened, tears brimming.


Isaac turned his bloodshot eyes toward her, his voice broken."Mom...I want surgery."


He was pleading like a child. Danica's heart twisted,but she forced herself to speak the truth. "Isaac, the doctors operated the day of your accident. But the nerves in your legs were too severely damaged...This is already the best they can be."


"No. My legs will recover. I want surgery. I want surgery." His words spilled out like a chant, as though repeating them could rewrite fate.


"Isaac, calm down first."


"My legs will get better. My legs will get better." He tried to get up again, his body trembling, his voice unrelenting. Danica reached to hold him back, but he pushed against her.


"My legs will get better. My legs will..." Smack! The sharp crack of a slap rang through the air.





Danica drew in a deep breath, raising her voice to break through his delusion.


"They will not recover. Dr. Loftus is the most trusted doctor in this field. The fact that your legs weren't amputated is already a blessing. You'll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair."


Boom! Isaac's mind went blank, his heart collapsing into silence.



In that instant, he tasted despair as bitter as gall.


"And what about Dad?" The question slipped from his lips-the question he had feared since waking.


Danica's face faltered, grief and resentment flickering in her eyes.


At once, Isaac understood.


He sank back onto the bed, his gaze empty, staring at the ceiling as though carved from stone. 
The room fell still, silence weighing heavier than words.





Danica's heart trembled at the hollow look in his eyes. Panic clawed at her-had her words broken him completely?


Regret surged through her chest. She softened her tone, whispering, "Isaac, if the doctors here can't help, we'll seek treatment abroad. There may still be hope."


Isaac shut his eyes, retreating from memories too heavy to bear.


For six long months, the greatest doctors had failed him.



Each time, he clung to the hope of a miracle, only to have it shatter in his hands.



He dreaded the thought of Verena in aother man's arms, yet he lacked the courage to gamble on chance.



She had told him she was seventy percent certain of success.


But what of the other thirty percent-failure, ruin,despair?




She had healed two others with similar impotence,yet unlike them, lsaac's body betrayed no sign of progress.


Those twin burdens-his crippled legs and impotence-clung to him like shackles, binding him to despair.
###Chapter 69 Familiar Profile





Isaac felt crushed under the tangle of emotions inside him, the pressure on his chest stealing the air from his lungs.


His hand lifted slowly, fingers curling around Verena's wrist as he spoke in a low voice."Verena,I need time. My life isn't like other men's. I'm crippled,and worse, I can't even give you what a husband should. I don't know what my future holds. If I never recover, asking you to stay with me would be selfish."


He understood it wasn't only unfair-it was dangerous. The deeper their bond grew, the harder it would be for him to walk away later compared to now.


Verena caught on to his meaning at once. Memories of her work in the operating room filled her mind-every surgery began with patients or their families signing consent forms, documents filled with warnings of potential risks.Even when the procedure was simple, people would dismiss it lightly, insisting it was only routine, that nothing would go wrong.Yet deep down, no one was ever truly calm. Faced with the list of dangers,families always imagined the worst. Nobody wanted to be the unlucky one, the tragic exception.


No one else could ever feel the same dread or grief for the patients and their families. To outsiders,surgery appeared ordinary. A person went in, came out in one piece, and life moved along as if nothing had happened. But until it was their turn, no one really knew what that fear felt like.


And Isaac's situation wasn't routine at all-every specialist had told him he couldn't be cured.Expecting him to believe in her felt like asking too much,especially since even she wasn't fully certain.


A sigh slipped from her lips as she sank to her knees beside him, her eyes locked on his with quiet determination. "Isaac, I'll wait. But I need you to let me try. I'll give everything I have to treat you. Until the day I admit defeat, don't speak of leaving me.Those words cut too deeply." Her fingers tightened tenderly around his hand. In a hushed tone, she asked, "Do you honestly want to see me hurt like that?"


When Isaac lowered his gaze, he met her clear,unwavering eyes-gentle yet unyielding in their stubborn resolve.



It struck him then that he was powerless against her;the smallest glimpse of vulnerability from Verena shattered all his resistance.


His mouth opened as if to speak, but no words came,leaving him in silence.







Instead of heading back to her hotel after leaving the Bennett Mansion, Verena steered herself toward a bar.


Sliding onto a stool at the counter, she ordered herself a drink.



The liquor scorched her throat, yet her thoughts lingered only on lsaac's wordless face, the memory pressing on her like a stone.


Shoildon's most popular bar surrounded her,boasting the best sound equipment and state-of-the-art lights.


Thunderous metal beats rattled the walls as streaks of dim neon washed over the crowd.


On the pulsing dance floor, beautiful men and women moved with wild energy, fueling the electric atmosphere.


Weighed down by family troubles, Kaia chose to blow off steam by going out with her friends.


Once she'd danced with a string of men and worked up a sweat, she waved her friends off and sank into a seat with a drink in hand.


While tipping her glass back, her eyes drifted toward the counter across the room.


Her eyes narrowed as she spotted a familiar figure-Verena.



Was she alone? A sly smile curved Kaia's lips. With Verena here, she had the perfect outlet for the grudges from home.


Clutching her drink, Kaia started toward the counter with deliberate steps.


Halfway across, she caught sight of a man slipping onto the stool next to Verena.



Kaia halted, folding her arms with a smirk, eager to see what scene would play out.


Perched on her high stool, Verena drained the rest of her glass in a single gulp, coughing as the burn clawed at her throat.



"So it is you, Verena." A warm, clear voice sounded from the seat next to her.



When she turned her head, she found Gavin, sharp-featured and smiling faintly, seated beside her. She frowned. "Gavin, you came here too?"


Gavin poured more liquor into her glass and teased lightly, "What's wrong? Only you get the right to drink your troubles away?" At his words, Verena let out a small laugh. "Then tell me, what are your troubles?"


Instead of answering, Gavin angled his face away,frustration written across his expression, refusing to speak.


Watching him clam up, Verena had little trouble figuring it out. Gavin had wealth, success, and family behind him, so what else could drag him to a bar but heartbreak?


Remembering the reason for his return, Verena ventured a guess. "She hasn't answered you, has she?"


Gavin hesitated, and then gave a short, dismissive scoff. "Close enough."


Shifting the focus, he asked, "What about you?Who's got you drinking tonight?"


Her turn came, and the question caught her off guard. Staring into her glass, she admitted quietly, "I went to see lsaac today. He told me he wants to end things. Gavin's brow furrowed. "He used to dream about marrying you, didn't he? Why would he suddenly back out? And aren't you two already planning your wedding?"


She took a slow sip, a bitter smile tugging at her lips."He doesn't remember me. He remembers everything else-but not me."


One eyebrow lifted in shock. "Why not just tell him the truth about what you two had?"


She shook her head, a sigh slipping out. "That would only make things worse. I met him in Clokron, and his family knows nothing about me. A few of his friends do,but they've kept quiet out of worry for his health.His mind must have buried me on purpose, shutting me out as a way to shield himself. It's his illness pushing me away."


Deep down, she sensed that Isaac still cared, but not with the same strength as before. He had chosen to erase their memories because facing her after learning the truth of his condition was unbearable.His heart couldn't let go of her, but his mind had made the choice for him.


For that reason, Verena had never rushed to tell him everything. Besides, love couldn't be forced. If he learned their shared past from her mouth, it would feel like listening to someone else's story. The story only mattered if he recalled it on his own.


Her narrow shoulders sagged as she tipped her glass back and drained it.


By the time their talk dragged on, she'd lost track of how many glasses she'd had. The liquor only magnified the sorrow she'd been holding back, until she slumped forward on the counter, her eyes dazed and unfocused.


Seeing her unravel like this for the first time, Gavin reached over and patted her back, bending close so his voice could rise above the blaring music. "Don't worry. He loves you too deeply for it to disappear.Memories have a way of returning."


From across the room, Kaia's eyes went wide. She fumbled for her phone and quickly snapped photos of Verena with Gavin. At last, she thought smugly, that shameless Verena had given her something to use against her.


With a curl of contempt on her lips, Kaia snapped three shots, each framed to make the moment look far too intimate.



Just as she was about to hunt down lsaac's number and forward the pictures, she froze, recalling how fiercely he had once stood up for Verena. To Kaia,he was nothing more than a besotted fool.


After weighing her options, she chose Bobby as the better target and attached a sly message. "Curious about what Verena's been up to?"


Bobby already carried resentment toward Verena,and if he saw her leaning close to another man in a bar...


The idea lit a sly spark in Kaia's eyes. Even if Verena clawed her way into the Bennett family, her days there would be anything but smooth.


Satisfied with herself, Kaia slipped back into her seat,lifted her drink, and settled in to watch the storm she 
had set in motion.


Just as Bobby stepped out of the shower at the Bennett Mansion, three photos from Kaia popped up on his phone.


One glance left him frozen in surprise.


Bathed in neon light, the pictures revealed a man and woman seated at the counter with their backs to the camera. The man's features were hidden, but the woman leaned forward, her profile faintly visible.


Bobby's brows drew together. Could that really be...Verena?


His gaze locked on the curve of her back and the glimpse of her profile, a jolt of recognition striking him hard. He had seen her before-it was almost like looking at Dr.Willis.
###Chapter 70 Something Extraordinary





Good heavens! Could it truly be Dr. Willis?


The thought struck Bobby like a bolt out of the blue,leaving him utterly dumbfounded.


He enlarged the photo again and again, scrutinizing every detail with disbelief. Though the picture was taken from behind, he was convinced that the woman Kaia mentioned-Verena-was none other than Dr.Willis.



There was no point wasting time guessing.He would uncover the truth once he went to the bar.


Without wasting a moment, Bobby called Kaia, his excitement barely held in check.


On the table, Kaia's phone lit up. When she noticed his name on the screen, the corners of her lips curled into a satisfied smile.


She answered leisurely, pressing the phone to her ear, her voice sweet and composed."Hello?"


Before she could say anything further, Bobby's anxious tone rushed in. "Kaia, which bar is she at?Send me the address this instant."



Kaia complied without hesitation, forwarding the location to him. "Done. Check the message."


Bobby gave the address a quick glance, hurriedly changed clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed downstairs. His voice was edged with urgency as he gave instructions. "You're still at the bar, right? Do whatever it takes to keep Verena there. Don't let her slip away. I'm on my way."


The tremor in his voice revealed how unsettled he truly was.


Kaia, however, felt a surge of satisfaction.


Clearly, Bobby was desperate to catch Verena in the act.


If Bobby confronted her, Verena's proud and unyielding nature would ensure an inevitable quarrel. And should someone "accidentally" record the spectacle in that bustling bar, word would spread like wildfire. Alec and Laura would not only be crushed by Verena's disgraceful behavior but also feel deeply humiliated.


In that moment, Kaia would shine as the only daughter worth relying upon.


As for the Bennett family, no matter how much lsaac might shield Verena, if both Danica and Bobby turned against her, then-even if shemanaged to marry into the Bennett household-her life would be nothing but walking on thorns.


In every sense, it was a plan that killed two birds with one stone.


Her eyes glittered with a triumphant gleam,her smirk impossible to conceal.


She added softly to Bobby, "Of course. I'm not just helping you. She's still my sister, and I don't wish to watch her stumble down such a foolish path."


Bobby dismissed her pretentious words without comment and hung up, tossing his keys to the driver."Aurora Bar. Quickly!"


The driver caught the keys and bowed his head respectfully. "Yes, Mr. Bennett."


Moments later, they were on the road, the car speeding through the night.


Bobby's abrupt hang-up did not bother Kaia in the slightest. She was already savoring the image of Verena's downfall, and the mere thought was intoxicating.


Meanwhile, in the back seat of the car, Bobby kept staring at the photos Kaia had sent, each passing glance strengthening his conviction-Verena was Dr.Willis.



Nervous sweat dampened his palms.


Unable to contain his emotions, he dialed Slater.


After a few rings, the call connected.


An irritated voice greeted him. "Really, Bobby? Do you ever check the time before calling?" Anyone woken from a dream would sound irritable.


Yet Bobby paid no attention to Slater's annoyance,blurting out his excitement. "Listen, Slater! You won't believe this. I've stumbled on something extraordinary. Verena might actually be Dr. Willis!"


At first, Slater thought Bobby was merely ranting and was ready to snap back, but the next words left him stunned.



"What nonsense are you spouting at this hour? Are you sure you're alright?" Slater chuckled in disbelief."I was at the Willis residence just days ago and eliminated that possibility with my own eyes. And now you expect me to believe Verena is Dr. Willis?What is this, some kind of early/ April Fool's prank?"


Bobby, anticipating his skepticism, swiftly forwarded the three photos.


"I'm not joking. I'm on my way to the bar right now.These were just taken. Look carefully at the woman-this is no mere coincidence."



Slater opened one of the pictures absentmindedly- aordinary and froze.


For a long moment, silence reigned, until Bobby,thinking the call had dropped, called his name.Suddenly, a startled curse burst from Slater's lips.


"Good heavens! That silhouette, that profile-it does resemble Dr. Willis." Slater zoomed in repeatedly,nearly convinced it was her.


After all, someone with Dr. Willis' elegance and striking figure was far too rare for mere chance.


Bobby arched a brow. "See? I told you l wasn't spinning tales."


Slater leapt out of bed. "Where are you now? Wait for me-I'm coming to0."


Bobby glanced out the window. "I'm just passing your street. I'll pick you up."


Slater hurriedly threw on some clothes. "Fine. I'll be waiting downstairs."


When the call ended, Bobby clutched his phone tightly, his chest swelling with a storm of emotions. If Verena truly was Dr. Willis,then all this time he had been speaking ill of her... Oh no!


Inside the bar, Kaia brushed off the advances of a few men and declined her friends' invitation to dance.


She remained seated, her gaze locked on the two figures by the counter, as if afraid they might vanish should she glance away.


As she sipped her drink, her eyes lingered on Verena with a mocking glint.


Across the room, Verena still leaned against the counter, unresponsive, while Gavin wore a troubled look. It was clear that none of his comforting words had reached her.


He scratched his head and finally offered, "Verena,believe me. With the way lsaac feels about you,he can't possibly cast you aside for good. You just need to raise the stakes, and he'll surely return to you."


Verena, drunk and weary, lifted her heavy head, her voice raspy. "Raise the stakes? I can't bring myself to pressure him. And I've already raised them enough by claiming I would be with other men if he let go,yet he still forced himself to ask me to leave."


Gavin clicked his tongue and leaned closer, lowering his voice. "You still don't understand. Men may act tough, but when it truly matters, they discover their limits. Words alone won't break him-you need action. Give me your phone, I'll help you."


Before Verena could object, Gavin had already taken her phone, unlocking it with her fingerprint. He opened the camera, leaned in close, and with a sharp click, captured a picture of himself beside her-her face and his half-body illuminated by the colorful lights of the bar.


The photo radiated an intimacy that words alone could not conjure.


Verena snatched her phone back, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. "What do you think you're doing?"


"Helping you raise the stakes, of course," Gavin replied, his tone brimming with strategy. "Here's what you'll send: type 'I'm drunk. Are you certain youdon't want to come pick me up?'-and attach this photo."
 
 ###Chapter 71 It's Working





Verena's thoughts were a little clouded, though she hadn't entirely lost her clarity.


She understood full well what Gavin's words implied.After lingering on the photo for a moment, she opened the chat app and began typing a message to Isaac.


As her fingers flew across the screen, Gavin leaned closer, stealing a glance. He broke into hearty laughter, teasing, "Well, who would've imagined Dr.Willis had such a sly streak?"


He said this because Verena had embroidered the story, making it appear even more dramatic than Gavin's original version.


Verena only smiled faintly in reply to her friend's playful remark.


Then she carefully reread the message she had drafted. "Isaac, your attitude today really wounded me. I'm drunk now. Are you sure you won't come to get me? If you don't, I might just do something reckless."



Content with her words, she pressed send-and attached the photo as well.


Placing the phone face down on the counter,Verena told herself that if lsaac refused to show up, she would indeed act recklessly. She didn't mind barging into the Bennett Mansion again, determined to "torment" him with her presence.


Meanwhile, inside the Bennett Mansion, the door at the far end of the second-floor hallway remained firmly shut. The room lay wrapped in darkness. The bed was untouched, and the curtains were left open,allowing a narrow stream of moonlight to spill onto the floor.


By the window sat lsaac in his wheelchair, staring into the night with a distant gaze, utterly lost in thought.


The window wasn't completely closed, and the cold wind crept through the gaps. Outside, tall trees swayed, their shifting shadows crossing his face, deepening the lonely silhouette he cast.



Isaac hadn't known restful sleep for nights on end.Each time he lay down, memories surged like an endless reel: the sight of his father bleeding after the accident,the weight of his own disability, the torment of his dysfunction, and the thought of Verena-forever beyond his reach. He could only endure the endless nights until dawn, and then bury himself in work to silence the torment.


All at once, the phone on the small table beside him buzzed twice.


At such an hour, he hadn't expected a message from anyone.


His fingers twitched, and Verena's image leapt instantly to his mind.


He picked up the phone, and at the sight of her name,his brows drew together.


Opening her chat, he scanned her words, his eyes narrowing at once.


Below the message was a selfie she had sent.


The neon lights behind her revealed clearly that she was in a bar.


Her cheeks were flushed, her lips tinged with a deep rose, and her bright eyes blurred slightly, carrying the disarming charm of intoxication.


The scene struck him like déjà vu-he had seen her drunk before in that hotel, and he recognized that look. By her side was a man, his face concealed,but his broad shoulders and attire betrayed his gender at once.



The word "reckless" from her message rang in his head, and a sharp ache spread across his temples.His thoughts darted back to that night in the hotel,when she had kissed him while drunk. Would she repeat such recklessness with another man?


The pain in his chest was like a knife's thrust, forcing him to cut short the images before they spiraled further. He realized then how fragile his composure truly was. Just the sight of a man leaning near her in that picture was enough to rouse a storm of jealousy.If his mind ran loose, he knew he could lose all reason.



Isaac's eyes fixed on the photo, his once calm features darkening, his gaze cold and sharp as if he could pierce straight through the figure partly captured in the frame.


Reason told him this was the moment to step back,yet his heart was deaf to such counsel. Fire burned in his chest, and with a bitter smile, he admitted he had once again surrendered to her.


"You promised me time to think. And this... this is your idea of patience," he murmured bitterly.


Consumed by jealousy, he could no longer think straight. His voice broke into a roar. "Andres, prepare the car!"


At once, Andres approached the door, asking respectfully,"Mr.Bennett, where shall I take you?"


Isaac froze briefly, realizing Verena hadn't shared the bar's address.


His throat tightened. With trembling fingers, he hurriedly dialed her number.


Back at the bar, Verena and Gavin were deep in conversation when Gavin motioned to her phone and said with a sly grin, "See? It's working. Amnesia or not, Isaac is still lsaac."


Verena's eyes lit with sudden joy as she picked up the phone and answered.


Before she could utter a word, Isaac's low, strained voice surged through the receiver. "Where are you?"


Just as Verena was about to reveal her location,Gavin leaned in mischievously and spoke in a hushed tone near the speaker. "Hey, beauty, are you alone?"


Verena shot him a sharp look, while Gavin only raised his brows knowingly and spread his hands.


Catching on quickly, Verena pressed her lips together and answered, "Yes, I'm alone."


The playful exchange was the last straw for lsaac. His hand clenched the phone so tightly his knuckles turned pale, his voice taut with urgency. "Verena,where are you? Tell me now."


Before she could respond, Gavin plucked the phone from her hand and switched it off.



"What are you doing?" Verena demanded, frowning.


"This," Gavin explained calmly, setting the phone aside, "is how you force a man's hand. A desperate bid to win you back. We'll make sure he never dares push you away again."


Verena blinked, turning over his words, and realized they weren't without reason.


Back in the mansion, lsaac froze as the line went dead. A sudden rush of panic seized him, and he quickly dialed again.


"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.Please try again later," the mechanical voice repeated.


His jaw tightened, his brow furrowed deeply. He redialed again and again, only to hear the same response.


For the first time in his life, Isaac cursed aloud. The thought of Verena being drunk and exposed to unwelcome advances was unbearable.


In desperation, he dialed Jacob. The assistant answered at once.


Without giving him time to speak, lsaac ordered hurriedly, "Check the photo I just sent you. Find the bar. Quickly."


On the other end, Jacob opened the photo, his memory sparking-he had visited that very bar before.
###Chapter 72 What Are You To Him





The moment the car slowed, Bobby and Slater flung the doors open and sprinted toward the bar.


Bobby went ahead and shoved open the heavy soundproof door. A blast of music crashed into them,while colorful lights flashed across the crowd of customers.



Inside, the lighting was low, yet they spotted Verena right away at the counter across from the entrance.


Verena leaned against the counter in a slump, her face tense with discomfort. The sharp smell of alcohol filled her nose, and her stomach turned uneasily.


She made an effort to sit upright and muttered a few broken words under her breath.



Gavin thought she was talking to him, so he bent closer. "Huh? What's wrong?" he asked. Verena eased off the stool with a faint scowl. "think... I'm gonna be sick," she whispered.


The blaring speakers drowned her words, so Gavin leaned even nearer. "What did you say?"


"I said I'm gonna vomit!" Verena shouted in his ear,gagging as soon as the words left her mouth.


The meaning finally clicked, and Gavin grabbed hold of her arms. "Whoa, easy! Please, don't ruin my clothes!"



From where Bobby and Slater stood, the scene looked different. They saw her slip from the stool,and before she could walk away, a man across from her pulled her into his arms. His back faced the door,his face hidden, his wide shoulders in plain sight.


Exchanging a sharp glance, Bobby and Slater narrowed their eyes and edged closer.


Then Verena lifted her head. When they caught her face clearly, both men froze. It really was Dr. Willis!


Bobby's eyes stretched wide, and he grabbed his head with both hands. He had told himself in the car to be ready, yet standing here in front of her was still too much. Thinking about it had been one thing.Seeing it unfold with his own eyes was something else. He could hardly process that Verena was Dr.Willis, and every cruel word he had hurled at her before now echoed in his mind.


No one could have imagined it. The woman he had despised and tried to push away with all his might was the same one he secretly wished would join his family as his sister-in-law. The thought left him feeling completely ruined.


Heat crept across Bobby's face in raw embarrassment. It was a good thing Dr. Willis didn't know he was Isaac's brother. If she'd known the man she once saved was the same one who'd gone on to treat her so coldly, and that he was her future husband's brother, she wouldn't have hesitated to slap him.


His lips parted on reflex, but not a sound came out.The idea of lsaac  tearing into him was terrifying enough, yet remembering the cruel things he had spat at Verena made him feel like ending himself was not far-fetched.


Beside him, Slater stood frozen in the same shock.The words "holy crap" lit up in his head like a neon sign. His jaw dropped so wide it could have fit an egg, and he gawked at Verena in disbelief. After all the times he had brushed aside the possibility, here it was-the truth. Dr. Willis truly was Alec's daughter.What a pointless chase that had been.


Since her call to Bobby earlier, Kaia kept flicking her eyes toward the bar's entrance, worried she might miss his arrival.


When Bobby entered with Slater at his side, Kaia's lips curled into a smirk. She hadn't expected him to bring company, but the thought pleased her. The more people around, the better the show would be.


Kaia rose to her feet, prepared to greet them, yet froze when she realized they had both come to an abrupt halt.


Tracing Bobby's gaze, Kaia spotted Verena in the arms of the man at the counter. The dim glow madethe scene appear almost intimate, like that of a couple.


A spark of excitement flickered in Kaia's eyes as she took in the sight. The timing couldn't have been better. With Bobby watching it unfold for himself, he had no choice but to believe Verena was disloyal.


Trying to hide the grin tugging at her lips, Kaia rushed to Bobby's side and clung to his arm. "Mr.Bennett,Verena..."


Bobby didn't so much as look at her and brushed her aside with a sharp wave. "Step away, don't get in my line of sight."


Her voice broke off in shock. She pressed her hand to the spot where he had shoved her and asked in disbelief, "Mr. Bennett, why are you..."


His sudden wide-eyed stare toward the counter drew her eyes in the same direction. There she saw Verena pressed close against the man, his head angling down for a kiss. They were kissing right there.


Gavin caught Verena every time she lurched forward, struggling desperately to steady her. Her body sagged uncontrollably, and after fighting the urge for several moments, she lost the battle.


Clutching his arm, she shook her head in weak defeat. "I can't do it anymore, Gavin. I really feel like I'm going to be sick."


Panic made Gavin's voice spill out in a rush as he tried to lead her forward. "No, no, Verena-Dr.Willis!Just a little longer, please. I'll get you to the restroom right away."


Before he could even finish the words, a sharp draft of air swept behind him. He moved on instinct,shifting sideways and turning to look, but he wasn't fast enough. A fist slammed straight into his face.The sudden sting forced him to drop Verena as his hand flew to his eye, and he stumbled several steps back in pain.


With no one steadying her, Verena reeled backward and braced herself against the counter. Her vision blurred, her mind foggy from drink, and she could hardly process what was happening. By the time she focused again, she saw Gavin pinned hard against the floor.


On top of him, Bobby straddled his chest and drove his fists repeatedly into Gavin's face.


Bobby's teeth clenched in fury, his voice tearing out of him with every blow. "You dared to touch my future sister-in-law? You think you can bully Dr.Willis? I'll beat you down for this, you bastard!"


The alcohol clouded Gavin's mind, and being attacked so suddenly left him dizzy and lost. Instinct alone guided him as his hands gripped Bobby's shoulders, flipping him over in a burst of strength to fight back. The struggle turned into a messy tangle on the floor, fists flying without thought. Even when they rolled apart and pushed themselves back to their feet, the fight refused to end, their bodies crashing against each other in unrelenting anger.



Slowly, Verena's senses sharpened, and she finally realized that Gavin had been dragged into a full-blown fight. When she saw Bobby about to slam a punch toward Gavin's stomach, panic shot through her. She darted forward and threw herself in front of Gavin, arms spread wide. "Touch him again and I swear I'll call the police," she shouted.


Slater, who had stood frozen for too long, finally snapped out of his shock. He rushed forward to grab Bobby's arms, pulling him back even as Bobby strained to lunge forward again. "Bobby, get a hold of yourself! Calm down!"


From her spot a short distance away, Kaia kepot her eyes fixed on the chaos with growing confusion.This was not how she had imagined the scene at all.Instead of turning his anger toward Verena, Bobby had attacked the stranger with a fury that carried the unmistakable air of a man protecting his own family.


The sound of Verena's voice made Bobby freeze,his eyes widening at her in disbelief. Did she actually threaten to call the police on him, just to protect this man? Did that mean she truly had something to do with him? For a brief moment, Bobby couldn't decide which version of Verena was real. Was she the refined,thoughtful Dr. Willis? Was she the arrogant woman who acted superior and lectured him in those messages? Or was she this woman standing here,entangled with some questionable man?


His brows drew together in puzzled frustration, and Bobby asked, "Dr. Willis, why are you protecting himm?Why would you help a man like that? What are you to him?"


Verena's gaze lingered on Bobby, and in that instant she remembered-he was the same boy she had pulled from a wrecked car.


Her lips parted as if to answer, but a heavy surge of nausea climbed up her throat and stopped her short.


She leaned her elbow on the counter and propped her head, her face twisted slightly in discomfort as she stared back at Bobby. "You jumped in and attacked my friend without reason. Naturally, I have to step in for him."


Kaia broke through the crowd in a hurry and called out,"Verena."


One eyebrow arched, and Verena shot Kaia a glance that carried more indifference than interest.


From the tone Kaia used and the timing of her arrival,Verena immediately sensed there was trouble stirring beneath the surface.



Sure enough, Kaia's expression tightened, arranging itself into a mask of false concern, as if to say she was only trying to help. She spoke with mock indignation. "How could you treat Bobby so harshly just because of another man? He's Isaac's younger brother,you know."


Because the bar thundered with noise, everyone had to raise their voices to be heard.


Kaia placed heavy stress on the words "another man," practically shouting them as if she wanted the entire room to notice, deliberately drawing attention to Verena's supposed closeness with Gavin.


Bobby's head turned instinctively toward Verena at Kaia's words, his eyes narrowing with suspicion as he studied her face.


Right at that moment, a violent churn rose in Verena's stomach. She clamped a hand over her mouth and lifted her other hand, signaling for them to stop.


"Wait a second," she remarked, before turning quickly and hurrying toward the restroom.
###Chapter 73 Dr. Willis Is Single





After Verena left, the group sank into silence.


"Oh." A playful voice broke through the hush.


Bobby, Slater, and Kaia all turned to Gavin, confusion written across their faces.


Gavin touched his throbbing lip, forced a crooked smile, rolled up his sleeves, and fixed his eyes on Bobby. "So-you're Isaac's brother, are you? Well, I'm not one to let debts linger. That punch you gave me earlier... I believe it's time the scales were balanced,don't you think so?"


Without another word, Gavin lunged and threw a punch.


Bobby realized too late; the blow landed squarely on his cheek.


Already irritated by Kaia's sharp remarks, Bobby's temper now ignited like dry tinder struck by flint. He ground his teeth. "You think justice is that simple?You hit me, and I'll see to it you pay the price."


With that, Bobby kicked at Gavin.


But Gavin was ready, stepping aside with ease.


Bobby, unfazed, balled his fist again, swinging with renewed fury. The two men collided once more, fists flying in a storm.


Slater, the only one clinging to reason, pushed forward to break them apart, his hand reaching for Bobby's shoulder. "Stop it, enough! Didn't you hear?He's Dr. Willis' friend, don't-ah!"


His cry tore the air. Bobby's punch, dodged by Gavin,had landed squarely on Slater's face instead.


Slater felt fire blaze through his left eye. Wincing, he steadied himself and reached for Gavin. "We're on the same side-stop this, stop-damn!"


He cursed under his breath, staggering back, his right eye already swelling into a dark bruise.


Seeing another punch aimed his way, Slater barked, "Damn it! If I'm the one getting hit, then I'm hitting back!" He tightened his fists and retaliated.


And so, the three of them spiraled into a chaotic scuffle.


The bar's patrons, well-accustomed to such nightly storms, paid little mind. Some even watched with mild amusement, as if the brawl were nothing more than tonight's entertainment.


"Look at that-people with disabilities come to bars too?" A woman's mocking voice cut across the noise.


Heads turned toward the entrance. There, half-shadowed beneath dim lights, sat a man in a navy trench coat, confined to a wheelchair yet radiating a presence that made the air heavier. His features were veiled, but his authority was unmistakable.


"Would you believe it? Still comes to a bar for fun despite the chair," someone scoffed.


"Keep your voices down," another muttered. "Didn't you notice the men behind him? Those aren't just bodyguards-they're wolves in suits." As if to prove the point, one towering figure in a black suit turned his gaze their way. His eyes, sharp as blades, sent a chill through the crowd, and in an instant, the onlookers fell silent, retreating into their drinks and dice games.


Kaia heard those patrons' words and turned toward the door. Her brows drew tight. Could it be lsaac?


Soon, her suspicion was confirmed-lsaac was indeed here, and the sight left her cold.


Isaac, for his part, paid no heed to the whispers. He'd heard too many to care. His thoughts clung only to Verena. His eyes, cold and unwavering, swept ahead -where three figures wrestled by the counter.


The bodyguard closest to lsaac caught sight of one of the fighters and leaned in, his voice low. "Mr.Bennett, isn't that your brother up ahead?"


Isaac swept his gaze across the room. Verena was nowhere in sight, yet one jacket among the three brawlers was all too familiar-it matched the photograph Verena had sent him earlier. His eyes narrowed, a shard of cold light flickering within. "Break them apart," he ordered, his tone like steel.

"Bring me the man in the brown jacket."


The bodyguard bowed slightly. "Yes, sir."


The fight was stillraging when Bobby lifted his leg to strike Gavin again-only to find himself hauled into the air by his collar,feet kicking helplessly.


Slater lunged at Gavin, teeth bared in desperation,but he too was seized by the collar, dangling as though gravity itself had forsaken him.


"Hey! Who the hell-" Bobby's curse halted the moment his eyes rose to the man holding him.Recognition lit his face. "Oh, it's you, Hawley! You came to back us up!"


Slater, too, recognized the bodyguard instantly-Hawley Aston, the Bennett family's most trusted guardian. A surge of relief and confidence flooded both men. Surely Hawley would deal with Gavin on their behalf.



Yet their hopes dissolved in an instant. With effortless strength, Hawley held them aside as if they were no more than rag dolls. He tossed Bobby and Slater away without ceremony, and then turned on Gavin. Before Gavin even grasped what had happened,Hawley had lifted him off his feet and carried him off like a hawk clutching its prey.


Gavin thrashed in resistance, but against a former mercenary like Hawley, his struggle was as useless as a moth battering against glass.


Hawley stopped before Isaac and spoke with military crispness."Mr.Bennett, I've brought him."


Isaac's hands tightened on the armrests of his wheelchair, his voice colder than the bite of winter."Where's Verena?"


Before Gavin could shape an answer, Bobby burst forward, seizing the chance to complain. "Isaac, it's this man! You must let Hawley teach him a lesson. He didn't just hug your future wife-he kissed her!I saw it with my own eyes!"


In his rush, Bobby twisted the truth, confusing wanted to kiss with kissed-yet in his mind, both sins weighed the same. Gavin was guilty either way. Isaac's grip hardened, his gaze cutting into Gavin like twin blades.


Gavin opened his mouth to deny, but then paused.He recalled his exchange with Verena. He had already done enough to stir lsaac's jealousy; now he wished to test whether lsaac's trust in her ran deeper than suspicion.


Drawing himself upright despite his bruises, Gavin smoothed his dlisheveled clothes and spoke with calm, deliberate poise.


"So what? Dr. Willis is single. A gentleman has every right to pursue a lady. The way I pursue her is my affair. As long as Dr. Willis herself raises no objection,the rest of you-who matter little in this-have no right to pass judgment."
###Chapter 74 Jealousy





Gavin's words sliced through lsaac's chest like a thousand unseen blades, as though each syllable tried to pierce the very core of his heart. Jealousy swelled inside him, a black hole swallowing the last fragments of reason, leaving only darkness in its wake.


Isaac fixed his eyes on Gavin, his memory sharp as ever. Even beneath the bruises that marred Gavin's face, he recognized him-the same man who had once sat across from Verena at Fortune Garden Restaurant.



Just friends? The thought rang hollow. Could such closeness truly be brushed off as mere friendship?Ha-people often doubted whether men and women could walk that line without stumbling. Now, the answer seemed clear: no.


Though Isaac could not untangle the truth in Gavin's words, Bobby's account of Gavin's earlier behavior toward Verena was already more than enough to inflame him.


Isaac's eyes blazed with jealousy and deep-rooted anger, a storm begging to be unleashed on Gavin.


Bitterness, regret, envy-one after another, the feelings circled him like vultures, tearing at his sanity without rest. His sharply cut jaw clenched tight, and his gaze gleamed with the ferocity of a predator,coiled and ready to strike.


His voice struck like ice against steel as he demanded, "Who gave you permission to touch her?"


Gavin flinched beneath that piercing gaze, fear chilling him for a heartbeat before his easy mask returned.



He laughed lightly, feigning ease, tilting his head in mock amusement. "Ah, Mr. Bennett, you have quite the sense of humor. Didn't you turn Dr. Willis away yourself? Or are you forbidding her from developing feelings for someone else?" Developing feelings?" Isaac echoed, teeth clenched, his face clouding like a storm on the horizon.


Gavin, savoring the chaos, decided to pour oil onto the flames. "Truth be told, I've admired Dr. Willis for quite some time. She isn't only beautiful-her mind and skill are rare treasures. Now that she's said she's single, tell me, what man wouldn't seize such a chance? Don't you think so, Mr. Bennett?"


Every word Gavin spoke was a spark to lsaac's fury.His eyes narrowed, cold as frost. This man knew his surname-his very identity. That could only mean Verena had spoken of him. But what had she said?That he had driven her away step by step? That he had rejected her until she stood alone, ripe for another's pursuit?


Isaac lowered his gaze, fury shadowing his brow, but sorrow weighing heavier. That little deceiver-only hours ago she had promised to wait, to give him time. Yet within the span of a night, she called herself single to another man. Isaac suspected Verena had done it on purpose. She was a sly fox, skilled in the art of reverse psychology,weaving snares with calculated ease. And yet, he had walked into her trap willingly-for the mere thought of it being true was a burden too heavy to bear.


Meanwhile, Verena had rinsed her face after vomiting and stepped out of the restroom, only to find Gavin restrained by a burly man. Before she could ask,Gavin's mocking words floated to her ears.


Her brows drew together in mild annoyance. What nonsense was he spouting this time?


She moved closer, nudging him lightly on the arm."What exactly are you rambling about?"


Caught off guard by her return, Gavin's face twisted as if his good intentions were being misread.Leaning close, he whispered, "Don't spoil it. I'm helping you."


Still lightheaded, Verena tilted her head, murmuring back, "Helping me with what, exactly?"


They bent toward each other, whispers passing between them, their closeness resembling cO- conspirators plotting a secret pact.


From a short distance, Isaac's hand clamped the armrest so hard that his knuckles cracked audibly.


That nearness-heads brushing, hair mingling-drove him to the edge. Jealousy slithered through his chest like venom, slow yet merciless, pushing him toward the brink of collapse.


He fought to hold back the rising tide of fury, his voice finally breaking the tension-low, steady, and edged with fire. "Verena."


###Chapter 75 Don't Bite





Bobby and Slater dared not meet Isaac's eyes. They felt like strangers at their own table, out of place and unable to grasp the gravity of the moment. So, they simply melted into the background, hoping not to stir the storm.


Kaia had drifted several steps back, anchoring herself at the farthest corner. The scene was slipping beyond her expectations, and her palms grew clammy with nervous sweat.


When Isaac called her name, Verena turned. Beneath the flickering lights, she caught the raw fire of jealousy burning in his eyes. Her own gaze softened,and she offered him a quiet, reassuring smile.


His arrival was both foreseen and unforeseen. She had expected him to come, yet not with such speed,as though he had raced against time itself.


When he saw Verena rooted in place, Isaac's browsknitted faintly. His voice dropped low. "Come here."


Verena had just gathered herself to step forward when Gavin's hand clamped onto her shoulder.


With a cold snort, he sneered, "Mr. Bennett, do you think this is fair? You pushed Dr. Willis away, and now you want her back. You think you can just cast her off when it pleases you and summon her when it suits you? Why should she bow to your whims?"


Isaac did not waver. His eyes locked on Verena,desperate to catch even the smallest ripple of emotion.



Yet, Verena's calm gaze met his without a word.


Her eyes were so crystalline that lsaac felt his very thoughts laid bare under their clarity.


All that had unfolded left him in dread. He could not stomach the image of Verena with another man,nor endure even the thought of her sharing closeness with someone else. The mere notion that another might desire her gnawed at his soul with claws of jealousy.  
Torn between insecurity and jealousy, it was jealousy that rose triumphant. He no longer cared for frailties of body or shadows in his mind. All he craved was Verena by his side. With her, everything else could fade to dust.



Those watching expected Isaac, stung by Gavin's barbed words, to turn away in anger.


Instead, he bowed his head and murmured, "I was wrong. If you will not come to me... then I will come to you."



He steered his wheelchair forward, halted before Verena, and reached for her hand. His eyes lifted to hers. "Will you come back with me?"


His heart thudded wildly, his expression taut with fear that she might never forgive him for the wounds he had carved with cruel words.



Verena studied him. His eyes, deep as hidden waters,his voice tinged with plea, and the tremor at the end of his words betrayed his unease. She could never resist him when he softened. She knelt, wrapped her arms around his neck, and whispered, "Isaac, Gavin only wanted to mislead you.He already has someone he loves, and so do l. We merely crossed paths here by chance. I told you before, as long as you turn back, I will always be here -my word unbroken."


The last line was a mirror of his own promise to her,now returned like an echo.


Isaac gazed at her. Her eyes were brimming with tenderness, as though her pupils held a sky littered with stars. His heart melted.


His throat tightened as he asked in a husky voice,"Then...will you come with me?"


A playful curve touched Verena's lips. "I've been waiting for you to come and fetch me."


His taut expression eased, and at last, a faint smile broke across his face.


Verena guided Isaac out of the bar. Once they entered the car, the driver and bodyguard moved to join them, but Isaac stopped them. "Wait outside for a while. I have something to discuss with my fiancée."



They exchanged knowing looks and nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."


They withdrew, granting the couple their privacy.


Isaac raised the half-lowered window and turned toward Verena's sparkling eyes.


Her smile warmed him like sunlight breaking through clouds.



Her hand still rested in his, and Isaac's thumb traced gentle circles on its back.


"Why are you so happy?" he asked softly.


Verena shook her head, her cheeks tinged pink from drink, her eyes glistening. Her voice stretched languidly. "I like it when you call me your fiancée.Say it again."


It dawned on Isaac then-she hadn't fully sobered.


The heater hummed. She had shed her coat, now clad in a blue cashmere sweater and fittedjeans that framed her figure with effortless grace.


His Adam's apple bobbed, his chest heaved, and his eyes grew heavy with unspoken longing.


He drew her hand gently, pulling her closer, and then folded her into his embrace.



His breathing deepened as he whispered again,"Fiancée...my fiancée."


From the instant he had seen her at the bar, the urge to hold her close had burned within him, though circumstance had forced restraint.



Caught unawares, Verena tumbled against his firm chest.



"Isaac, you-" Before she could finish, his lips hovered close, his intent unmistakable.



Startled, she pressed her free hand against his shoulder. She had just thrown up earlier.


The subtle fragrance on her was broken, and Isaac glanced at  her delicate hand holding him back. His lashes lowered as he blinked slowly.


"Why push me away?" His tone carried grievance,like a child robbed of his cherished toy.


Verena's hand slipped down as she explained gently,"It's not that. I just... threw up."


The implication was clear-she feared she might not smell pleasant.


Isaac blinked, briefly stunned.


"You rinsed your mouth?" he asked.


Verena nodded. A small smile touched his lips.


"Then it's fine," he murmured, leaning in once more.


Realizing he was serious, Verena pressed against him again, pleading softly, "No, not now. We'll have plenty of chances later, won't we?"


Isaac's gaze lingered on her reddened lips, his Adam's apple rising, his eyes sliding down her delicate neck. They narrowed with a heat that defied words. As Verena leaned back in persuasion, her slender neck arched, exposed in the dim glow.


"Fine, no kissing," Isaac conceded. Yet before she could relax, he suddenly drew her onto his lap,seating her astride,face to face.


Startled, Verena gasped, only to hear him murmur,"This much is allowed, yes?"


"Mmm..." she groaned faintly.


His warm lips brushed her neck, sending sparks that raced down her spine.


Before she could recover, he nibbled lightly at her skin, part playful, part possessive.


"Isaac..." Verena clung to his shoulder, her body trembling as sparks coursed from her back to her mind, leaving her weak and pliant against him.


In the dim light of the car, Isaac lifted his head at the sound of her voice. "What's wrong?"


His breath skimmed her chin, light as a feather,stirring her heart with an aching itch. Her cheeks flushed, she pinched his burning earlobe and murmured, half-coaxing, half-complaining,"Don't bite."



"Alright, no biting," Isaac agreed at once, and then lowered his head to press his lips to her collarbone.



His tongue traced her skin, slow and deliberate, his lips drawing firmly at intervals.



It was no bite, yet it unsettled her far more.



Outside the car, the driver and bodyguard exchanged looks. The driver squinted toward the vehicle.



"Did the car just move?" the driver muttered.



The bodyguard, sharp-eyed from years as a mercenary, gave it a glance. "No."



The driver frowned. "Strange. They sent us away,and it's been so long-yet no sign of movement?"



The bodyguard pressed his lips together, impassive."Better not to meddle in Mr. Bennett's business.Orders are orders."
 
    


Inside the bar, after Verena left with Isaac, the group stood rooted, still reeling from the turn of events.


No one had expected it to end this way.


Bobby and Slater traded bewildered looks. "What just happened?" Bobby asked, baffled.


Slater shrugged, palms up. "Don't ask me. I'm just as lost."



Seeing he had no role left to play, Gavin decided the night had reached its end. All he wanted was sleep-and a clear head in the morning.



He chuckled dryly and told the two, "I'll settle today's account with you later. I'm leaving."


It sounded less like farewell and more like a verdict.


As Gavin's figure faded into the distance, Bobby's mind turned over the events. Something didn't add up. Gavin hardly seemed invested in Dr. Willis at all-and he knew she was Verena, Isaac's fiancée. Then the realization struck like a bolt. Bobby's eyes widened. He hadn't connected Verena and Dr. Willis because Kaia had once said in their group that Verena was unattractive.



He turned sharply toward Kaia and demanded,"Didn't you tell us before that Verena wasn't attractive?"



He frowned. Was this what Kaia had called unattractive?



Slater too shot her a questioning glance.


Kaia froze where she stood, as though her shoes had been nailed to the floor. She had been so eager to expose Verena's supposed flaws that she had forgotten the last thing she wanted was for Bobby to see Verena's true beauty.


Kaia's face drained of color in an instant.
 ###Chapter 76 Warning





Kaia stiffened under the sharp stares of Bobby and Slater, a shiver crawling up her spine.


Her lips quivered as she forced herself to defend."When Verena first came to the city, she didn't care much about appearances, and she wasn't as attractive as she is now. When people in the group chat asked me about her, I just said she was alright.I never called her ugly. Those rumors were made up by others.How can you pin that on me?"


She tried to sound reasonable, as though she were the victim of false blame, but panic pressed at her chest.



Bobby caught every crack in her story and gave a slow, mocking grin. "Do you think I'm that easy to fool? If it were my sister, I'd never stand by while outsiders insulted her. And you expect me to believe Verena could ever be described as just 'alright'?Even without effort, she outshines most. If the gossip 
didn't come from you, then why didn't you step in to stop it? Tell me, Kaia, are you really acting like a sister here, or were you quietly pushing this along?"



His relentless questioning tore through the fragile wall she'd tried to build.


Kaia's throat tightened, and she squeezed her fists to stop her nerves from showing.


"Mr. Bennett, you're being unfair. Verena is my sister,and I would never scheme against her. The reason l stayed quiet was..."



Kaia's words faltered, and she scrambled to justify herself. "Because explaining would only spark more fighting, and that fighting would spread even further.I didn't want all of this trivial gossip reaching Verena and upsetting her."



"So you think it's nothing serious?" Bobby's tone cut like a blade as his eyes narrowed. "Accusations of falsifying her degree, being selfish, arrogant, and unrefined-are those trivial to you?"


His voice dropped lower, leaving no room to escape. 
"Kaia, stop pretending. You dragged me to this bar tonight because you wanted me to see Verena with another man and stir up trouble. You wanted her branded as unfaithful so her reputation would crumble. After that, you expected me to bring the story back to lsaac or my mother. And while lsaac might keep calm, you know my mother's nature. If she believed what she heard or saw, she'd make Verena's life miserable the moment she married into our family. You'd just stand there and watch it unfold,pleased with the chaos. Isn't that the truth?"


Kaia's lips parted, but not a single defense came out.Every accusation matched the thoughts she'd buried inside. Beads of sweat gathered on her forehead,her legs turned to jelly, and the color drained from her face. The carefully polished image she had fought so hard to maintain in high society was the last thing she wanted to see crumble.



Bobby shot her a frigid look and spoke with unwavering firmness. "I don't care if it's jealousy or something else driving you, but this ends here. From now on, watch yourself and stop creating problems. If you insult my future sister-in-law again, you'll regret it."


The exchange left Slater stunned. The idea that someone could despise her own sister to this degree was beyond him.


Disgust flickered across his face as he glared at Kaia."Back at the Willis Villa, when I mentioned Verena,your outburst suddenly makes sense. You can't handle seeing her shine. And if memory serves me right, you even bragged that a few random supplements you tossed together healed my grandfather's leg. The more I think about it, the funnier it sounds."



Heat rushed to Kaia's cheeks, and she sank her teeth into her lip, furious that he had stripped her bare so mercilessly.



A sharp laugh escaped Slater as he moved closer,towering over her. "Let me clear things up for you.The one who healed my grandfather was indeed from the Willis family, but it sure wasn't you. It was Verena.Your sister. Shocking, isn't it?" Kaia had long wondered if Verena was responsible for Barrie's recovery. As long as no one confirmed it,though, she clung to the fantasy that she might guess wrong.


That fantasy shattered the instant Slater spelled it out. The truth gutted her. Why Verena of all people?She had no prestigious training, only the rough skills of a countryside healer. Kaia, on the other hand,studied medicine at a renowned university. How could Verena possibly have better medical skills than her? The thought was unbearable.



Color drained from her face, and her legs buckled as she stumbled backward.



Earlier, she had barely kept her lies afloat. Now, with Slater's brutal words cutting deeper than ever,her last defenses collapsed. Broken and humiliated,she spun on her heel and rushed out of the bar in near hysteria.







The Willis Villa still blazed with light, though the night had slipped wvell past midnight.

 In the living room, Laura sat curled on a sofa,clutching her phone. She had dialed Verena again and again, each call met with silence, yet she refused to give up.


Since the club incident, Alec had buried himself in work at the company and rarely came home.


Whenever he did stop by to grab something, Laura tried reaching out. Sometimes she got nothing more than a cold stare. Other times, his foul mood exploded, and he berated her as an unfit mother who couldn't even get her own daughter to answer the phone.


The bitterness she carried threatened to spill over,but she swallowed it back. If the family was going to have any future, then she had no choice but to bow to Verena.


Isaac dropped Verena off at the hotel, and then instructed the staff to prepare something to clear the alcohol from her system. He didn't leave until she had finished it.



Sleep tugged at her eyelids, and she made no effort to ask him to stay.


The stench of liquor clung stubbornly to her, so she dragged herself into the bathroom, craving the relief of a hot shower.


As her clothes came off, the mirror betrayed her with a glimpse of several crimson marks scattered along her collarbone and neck. Isaac used to leave those when they were together in bed...


The memory seared her cheeks red. She slapped them lightly, desperate to stop her mind from straying down that path.



A sudden vibration rattled against the countertop,pulling her attention to her phone.



Laura's name flashed on the screen, and without hesitation, Verena hit decline.


When the call cut off, the display lit up with more than twenty missed calls-all from Laura.


The reason behind Laura's relentless attempts had been clear for days now.Verena decided she had no energy to deal with it.She either silenced the phone or flatly rejected the calls.



With the phone tossed aside, she stepped beneath the running water.


Meanwhile, Laura heard nothing but the busy tone and exclaimed through clenched teeth, "Ungrateful brat!"


Her temper nearly drove her to hurl the phone across the room.



Days of unanswered calls had left her feeling insulted and powerless.



Across town, Kaia stumbled out of the bar and into a taxi. Life felt as though it had slipped out of her control, and her empty eyes reflected the chaos as she numbly pushed open the front door upon arriving home.



The sound reached Laura, who turned toward the entrance. The moment she saw Kaia step inside, her face lit up with sudden hope, as though salvation had walked in.


"Kaia, you're finally home." She rushed over,consumed by her own worries, oblivious to Kaia's ashen face and hollow expression. "I need you to do something for me."
###Chapter 77 Stop Mentioning Her In Front Of Me





Laura let out a quick explanation, her voice sharp with irritation. "I tried calling Verena again, and she hung up on me. That ungrateful girl refuses to let go of her grudge. I've already dialed her number more than twenty times, yet she still won't answer. I don't think I can bring myself to keep trying anymore."


Before Kaia could get a word in, Laura grabbed her hand with a smile and added, "But you're not like me.You're her little sister, and you've never given her a reason to be upset. Verena won't turn against you.Besides, you've always been clever with words and know how to win people over. So why don't you call her? Use a softer tone, say something nice, and ask her to talk Isaac into sparing us. After all, the two families will soon be tied together by marriage, so shouldn't we leave some space to work things out?"


The stress of the situation had already stolen Laura's  sleep for several nights.


Caught up in her own plotting, she didn't even notice the dark look tightening Kaia's features.



Kaia cut her eyes toward Laura, her jaw rigid with frustration. Just hearing Verena's name was enough to make her want to crush her, let alone lower herself to beg for Verena's mercy.



Her eyes burned with a bloodshot glare, and the fury rising inside her roared to life.



Snatching her hand free of Laura's hold, she burst out in a trembling voice, "Verena, Verena, Verena!What makes her so special that everyone keeps talking about her? The others are obsessed, Dad is too, and now even you! Ever since she showed up, all of you only see her. Do I even count as your daughter anymore?"


The living room went still for several seconds,her voice echoing off the wide walls.


Her words quivered, her tone almost breaking apart.  Laura froze, startled by the sudden fury, her smile stiff and unnatural.



Kaia had always been spoiled, but she had also been mild and obedient since she was young. Laura had never once seen her younger daughter rage with such raw anger.


Laura's face filled with shock as she asked, "Kaia,what has gotten into you?"


Kaia balled her fists, drew in a sharp breath,and spoke through clenched teeth. "I don't want to hear Verena's name again. Stop mentioningher in front of me."



She pushed past Laura without another glance and stormed upstairs to her room.



Laura stood frozen in place, truly stunned by Kaia's outburst, her eyes fixed blankly ahead as she struggled to recover. Something about her younger daughter felt changed, though she couldn't pinpoint what it was. All she knew was that Kaia no longer seemed like the girl she used to be. ···


Slater came back home from the bar that night and made his way directly toward Barrie's quarters.


He was eager to share with Barrie everything that had unfolded earlier in the day.



Surprise flickered across Slater's face when he saw the back garden still lit up, since Barrie was usually in bed by this hour.


When he drew closer, Slater spotted Barrie seated at the patio table, joined by Fletcher and Marietta.



Taking a seat beside them with a confused look, he asked, "Dad, Mom, why are you still awake?"


"You rascal, finally back from your outings."Marietta's tone carried mock annoyance, yet her eyes brimmed with affection. As she reached out to smooth down Slater's untidy bangs, she explained,"We were having a discussion with your grandpa."



Even though Barrie kept to himself most of the time,Fletcher and Marietta often turned to him for advice  whenever company matters grew complicated.


"Oh, I get it." Slater showed little interest in the details of their talk, but he straightened his posture and said firmly, "It's good you're all here together.I have something very important to tell you."
###Chapter 78 You've Got More Than One Daughter





Fletcher burst into laughter the moment he heard Slater speak. "And what could be so important for you?"


Slater let out a click of his tongue, pretending to be wounded. "Dad, you make it sound like l've got nothing better to do than fool around."


With his smile lingering, Fletcher asked, "Alright then,what's this big secret you're keeping?"


Slater rubbed the back of his neck, hesitating before admitting, "Fine, maybe it's not exactly the kind of thing you'd call big."


That confession made his parents and grandfather laugh even harder.



Straightening up, Slater spoke with a sudden gravity."But what I'm about to say will definitely surprise you."


The laughter faded at once, and every eye turned toward him in expectation.


Slater leaned in a little, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret. "The doctor who cured Grandpa's leg, Dr. Willis, is actually Alec's daughter."



Shock rippled across the table, leaving them speechless for a moment.



Barrie narrowed his eyes, the astonishment written clearly across his face.



Fletcher's gaze met his wife's, both of them struggling to believe what they'd just heard.


Marietta leaned forward, doubt filled her voice."Slater, are you absolutely sure? When we visited the Willis family, they told us Dr. Willis wasn't Alec's daughter. Why are you saying otherwise now?"


Slater chuckled at her skepticism. "Mom, that day only Kaia was at home. Naturally she wasn't the doctor. Remember, the Willis family has two daughters."


Her words trailed cautiously. "So you mean..."


"Yes," Slater confirmed, his eyes gleaming with admiration. "The real Dr. Willis is Kaia's elder sister,Verena Willis."


Barrie remained silent, lost deep in thought as the revelation settled over him.



Fletcher frowned in doubt. "You mean the one engaged to lsaac? She doesn't seem to have a favorable reputation. Maybe Isaac's dislike for her is what drove him to strike at the Willis family and stir up all this trouble."


Stories about Verena had already reached Fletcher's ears. What he'd heard wasn't just unfavorable-it was downright disgraceful. Still, as a well-educated man, he chose his words cautiously to leave her some dignity.


Slater's voice rose in protest. "Not have a favorable reputation? That's all Kaia's doing. You don't know how conniving Alec's younger daughter is. She's a compulsive liar who floods the internet with her nonsense, trying to ruin Verena's name. She tells everyone Dr. Willis is unattractive, arrogant,dishonest, and useless."


He then turned toward Barrie and said, "Grandpa.Mom and Dad haven't met Dr. Willis, but you and l have. Do you honestly think Kaia's smears make sense? Just her looks alone-how many women in Shoildon can match her? And her personality? She's gentle to the core. As for her skills, they're beyond doubt. Anyone bold enough to operate on you has to be at a professor's level at least."



Barrie sat in silence, his expression serious as he reflected. Rumors had never mattered to him anyway.All that counted was that Dr. Willis had proven herself to be one of the best physicians in Clokron.


Slater leaned forward, continuing firmly, "And let's clear up another falsehood. The talk about lsaac being unhappy with her? That's absolute nonsense."



Thinking back to what he'd witnessed earlier atthe bar, Slater allowed a smile. "If anything, Isaac looks more than pleased with Dr. Willis."


Fletcher's expression tightened with uncertainty."SO everything I've heard about her...are you saying none of it's true?"



Slater thumped his chest with confidence. "That's right, Dad. You can believe me-those stories are nothing but gossip."


Marietta leaned in and asked sharply, "Then tell us,how exactly did youlearn all this?"


Every eye at the table shifted to Slater, waiting for his explanation.



Slater went on to recount what had unfolded earlier that night.


When he finished, the group grew quiet until Barrie finally let out a weary sigh. "What are we supposed to make of this? Should we still be stepping into Alec's club issues?"



After a moment of thought, Barrie tapped his cane against the ground, his thick white brows knitting ìtogether. "Alec is Dr. Willis' father, and Dr. Willis herself saved me. If that's the case, I can't simply turn a blind eye."



Fletcher noticed the hesitation in his father's voice and spoke carefully. "Dad, if Isaac moves against the Willis family not because he dislikes Verena, then he must have another reason. Why don't we ask Beckett to hold off on shutting down the Willis Group's club for a couple of days? We can wait until we hear Isaac's side before deciding what to do. How does that sound?"



Barrie rolled the bead at the top of his cane between his fingers, and then gave a firm nod. "We'll do it that way."



The following morning, inside the CEO's office at Willis Group, Alec sat behind his desk. Days of sleepless nights had left him thinner, with heavy shadows beneath his eyes. He looked more exhausted than ever.



Before one crisis calmed, Bennett Group swooped in and took several key projects right out from under him.



Problems were piling up everywhere, and Alec struggled to keep the company afloat.


By dawn, he was already on the phone, calling old partners and anyone with influence still left in his contacts. Whether it meant leaning on friendships or lowering himself with flattery, Alec refused to miss a single chance to fight for Willis Group's survival.


Alec forced a stiff smile as he spoke into the phone."Have you eaten yet? If not, let me treat you. And if meeting is a hassle, I can always send breakfast over."



The voice on the other end was rude. "Forget it, Mr.Willis. Let's not waste time. If this is about your club,then don't bother calling again."



A twitch crossed Alec's face. "We've been partners before. Couldn't you at least-"



The call cut off before he could finish.


"Hello? Hello?" Alec pressed the phone back to his ear, but the line was dead. HHe tried calling back, only to be ignored.


Even those who once called themselves friends wanted nothing to do with him when things turned bleak.



His complexion drained, Alec quickly moved to dial the next number.


"Hey, are you free this week? Let's grab a meal. Pick any place you like-"


The voice on the other end cut him off, speaking briskly. "Alec, don't bother with small talk. I know the issues of your club have got you stressed, but there's nothing I can do."


His knuckles tightened on the edge of the table."When you launched your company, I was the one who stood as your guarantor. Now that Willis Group is in trouble, you can't just turn away like this."


The man on the other end answered, "Of course l remember what you did for me, Alec. But things are different now. Beckett is carrying out lsaac's orders.l may know Beckett, but not nearly well enough to sway him."


Alec heard the dismissal beneath the polite tone.Realizing there was no use dragging it out, he muttered a few half-hearted thanks before hanging up.


A wave of anxiety gripped Alec so tightly that his vision blurred, and he quickly reached for a bottle of pills, forcing a few down.


Just then, his phone buzzed. For days he had been the one dialing number after number, so the sight of an incoming call felt almost strange.


Without bothering to check who it was, he snatched up the call.


"Alec, I've got some good news for you," a cheerful voice remarked.



Hope flickered in his chest as he asked quickly "What news?"



"You've been worried about your club being shutdown, right? I had a friend close to Beckett dig around, and they just told me the Lyons family stepped in. They convinced Beckett to ease up and lift the lockdown for now."



Shock and joy hit Alec all at once, and he shot to his feet. "The Lyons family? Are you sure this is solid?"


"Of course. You think I'd play around with something like this?" The caller reassured him.



The certainty in the voice left Alec convinced. The problem wasn't gone completely, but for now,he had some breathing room. At least Isaac hadn't slammed the doors shut permanently in one decisive move,which was exactly what Alec had been dreading.



Relief spilled out of him in a long exhale. "You're right, I overreacted. Thank you for this. I owe you a big meal soon."


After ending the call, Alec pressed his fist against his forehead, confusion creeping in. He had thought the Lyons family wanted nothing to do with him, maybe even held a grudge. So why step in now? Whatever their reason, he knew he needed to call them himself-both to thank them and to understand what game they were playing.


Alec dialed the Lyons family's private number.


Inside the Lyons residence, Slater was halfway through breakfast with Barrie when the house phone began to ring.



"Who's calling so early?" Slater murmured as he tore off another bite of bread.



The butler checked the screen and answered, "It's Alec Willis."



Slater arched a brow, already guessing the reason behind the call.


"Hand it to me," he said, reaching for the phone.


Barrie shot him a warning look. "Slater, don't fool around."



"| won't," Slater assured quickly. "But Alec deserves to hear the truth." With that, he accepted the phone and hit the answer button. Alec's voice came through, formal and steady. "Good morning. Is Mr. Barrie Lyons available?This is Alec Willis, CEO of Willis Group."


Slater leaned back in his chair, answering casually,"My grandfather's right here. Say what you need-he can hear you."


"Alright," Alec replied, hesitation creeping into his tone. "A friend told me the lockdown on our club was lifted for now. Did Mr. Barrie Lyons make that happen?"



Slater straightened his posture, responding clearly,"Yes. My grandfather did intervene."


Alec opened his mouth to thank Barrie, but Slater cut in before he could. "If you want to thank someone,thank Dr. Willis. You're fortunate to have such a daughter."


A small crease appeared between Alec's brows. Dr.Willis...


The thought slipped out before he could stop  himself. "Could it have been Kaia..."



"Hold on!" Slater chimed in sharply. "Don't go assuming Kaia is the one behind everything good.Last I checked, you've got more than one daughter."
###Chapter 79 Unbelievable Facts





Slater spoke plainly, and Alec immediately sensed the weight behind his words. A deep crease formed between his brows as a startling thought struck him -could it really be Verena?


Silence lingered on the line, and Slater could almost hear Alec wrestling with the idea.


A sharp laugh carried through the phone as Slater chimed in, "Come on, Mr. Willis. You've already guessed it. The truth is exactly what you're afraid of.It wasn't Kaia who healed my grandfather's leg. It was Verena Willis. If you're desperate to hand out thanks, direct them to your eldest daughter instead of pretending Kaia deserves the credit."



Normally, Slater wouldn't waste his time picking apart a wealthy family/'s private squabbles. But when it came to Dr. Willis, he made an exception.


Hearing that name spoken with such certainty jolted 
Alec. It was as if someone had splashed ice water over him. His hand clenched the phone so tightly that it shook.


Disbelief twisted his mouth as he muttered, "No...that can't be right. Verena? How could that be possible? Isn't this some mistake? She grew up tucked away in a forgotten little town, learning scraps of medicine from a village doctor. Don't tell me she was capable of curing a condition even the top hospitals couldn't fix. That's absurd..."


"What nonsense about some village doctor and a few scraps of medicine?"


A flicker of amusement crossed Slater's face at Alec's refusal to accept the obvious. No matter how plainly he laid it out, the man clung to denial like it was a lifeline.


A harsh laugh slipped out, dripping with contempt."So that's what you've convinced yourself of? Just idle gossip picked up from people who don't know the first thing about Dr. Willis? I've heard those stories too, but they're nothing but blind ignorance. The real irony is this-those strangers have an excuse. You don't. You're her father, and yet you can't even name a single skill your daughter has. Tell me, Mr. Willis, what kind of father looks away so carelessly?"


Without pausing for an answer, Slater pressed harder, his voice as sharp as glass. "In Shoildon,everyone's heard the praises sung for Kaia. They boast about her spot at the nation's top medical university, her studies under a famous professor. But here's what no one talks about. Back in Clokron,years ago, Verena was the lead surgeon who opened my grandfather's chest and gave him a new heart.That's the woman you've been overlooking."


Alec's eyes widened in disbelief. Surely this couldn't be real.


In his sudden panic, he stumbled backward,bumping into his chair before collapsing into it.


His brow furrowed deeply as he blurted out, "That makes no sense. Your grandfather's heart surgery was far too dangerous for any local doctor to even consider. How could Verena have handled something like that? And wasn't she always stuck back in our hometown? When did she even have the chance to go overseas?"


The questions spilled out one after another, directed at Slater, but just as much at himself.


Finding Alec's frantic denial almost entertaining,Slater chuckled. "Mr. Willis, she's your daughter. If you don't even know what she's capable of, why on earth would I be the one to tell you?"


Without another word, he ended the call.


A flat tone rang through Alec's ear as the line went dead. He stayed frozen for a long moment, phone pressed against him as if hoping the voice would return.


Finally, he slammed the device onto the desk,dropped his elbows to it, buried his fingers in his hair,and bowed his head low. Everything he thought he knew about his eldest daughter had just unraveled.

 
Only then did it hit him-he had lived like a man walking blind. He had never truly tried to understand Verena. Before she was seven, he and Laura had spent most of their time away working, coming home only on holidays, treating family time like a rare luxury. When she reached that age, Kaia was born,and his business took off, pulling his attention even further away.


As the years went by and the family finally settled in Shoildon, Kaia quickly became the apple of their eye.Then Luka was born, completing the picture-perfect family of four. With a cherished son and a celebrated daughter, Verena became little more than a shadow.


When they did call her, the conversations were shallow, filled with praise for Kaia's kindness or Luka's cleverness, but never once did they ask Verena about her own life.



The memories twisted his expression into something bitter and pained. His chest tightened with the weight of it all.


He remembered bringing Verena into Shoildon, only to hear Laura constantly boast of Kaia's brilliance while treating Verena like a burden. As he thought back now, Verena must have seen the absurdity of it all, standing silent while her own mother dismissed her.


And yet, minutes ago, Slater had revealed the truth-that the daughter they ignored, the one pushed aside, was the very doctor who had performed a heart transplant and restored Barrie's health.


The blow landed harder than he could bear, and Alec struck his forehead with a clenched fist.


Regret poured through him, thick and merciless, as though something priceless had slipped forever from his hands.







After Kaia's explosive outburst the night before, she had gone out of her way to avoid her mother.


Confusion lingered at the back of Laura's mind, but she was far too distracted to think about it.


Her attempts to reach Verena that day had failed one after another, each call ending without an answer.


The irritation gnawed at her until her body felt heavy with fatigue.


Later, after rinsing off in the shower, she sat before her vanity, smoothing skincare across her face while deciding she'd try Verena's number one final time before turning in.


The sound of the door unlocking startled her just as she reached for her phone.


When she looked over, Alec stepped inside, and her surprise slipped into her voice. "Alec? What brings you home tonight?"


Not once since the closure of the club had he returned during the evening.


Alec offered no reply. Instead, he set his briefcase down and sank heavily onto the sofa in their bedroom.



Laura walked toward him cautiously. "Did you have dinner yet? I can ask the staff to fix you something if you haven't."


His head moved in a firm shake, but his lips remained sealed.



It took her a moment to realize that his silence wasn't ordinary. As she drew closer, she caught sight of the storm clouding his features-his forehead creased,his brows drawn into a knot, and faint new lines had carved themselves into his skin.


Being someone who knew how to read faces, she lowered her tone and asked carefully, "Alec, what's happened? Did more trouble come up with the club?"


His answer came slowly, his voice heavy with exhaustion. "No. That part's been taken care of."



Laura didn't catch what he'd mumbled, so she leaned in."What was that?"



Alec finally raised his eyes to meet hers. "The matter with the club-it's been taken care of."



For a second she just stared, stunned, before her whole face lit up. "Are you serious? That's incredible

 news!"



She slipped onto the sofa beside him and clasped his arm."Then why do you look like the world's ending?You nearly gave me a heart attack with that expression."


No hint of joy touchned Alec's face. His hands dug into his knees as he murmured darkly, "It was Verena who solved it."



Shock flickered across Laura's eyes, but it quickly melted into smug satisfaction.


"Hmph. That ungrateful girl. I thought she'd abandoned us altogether since she ignored all my calls. But clearly she's worried about her future with the Bennett family and realized she still needs our backing."



She brushed her fingers through her hair with a self-satisfied air.since she showed some sense this time, I'll overlook her rudeness and pretend she never avoided me."


Alec turned his head sharply, shooting her a look. The way Laura spoke of Verena carried such disdain it was as though the girl were something dirty clinging to her shoes.


That tone stirred a memory in Alec. Years ago, when he had tried to bring his mother and Verena from their small rural town to Shoildon, Laura had stopped him every time with one excuse after another.


She had said, "They're comfortable with country life.City living would only trouble them." Then, another time, "We're too busy with work, and Kaia and Luka need us. We don't have the energy to care for them too." And finally, "Verena's a country girl.People here would only look down on her." Only now did it hit him -those excuses had never been truths, just deliberate barriers she put up.



The more he thought about it, the hotter his anger burned. If not for Laura's schemes, Verena would have been here years ago, and by now she might already hold a place of honor in Shoildon society.And the Willis family's standing might've skyrocketed. With that bitter realization weighing on him, Alec jerked his arm free from her grasp and leveled a cold stare at her. "Don't fool yourself. Verena didn't directly step in. The problem was resolved because she once gave Barrie a new heart and healed his leg.Barrie stepped in for her sake."


Laura shot to her feet, her eyes wide. "What did you just say?" 
###Chapter 80 We Owe Verena





Laura's shock quickly turned into outright denial.She shook her head again and again, blurting, "No, that's impossible! Verena never even went to college. She only learned a little medicine from a village doctor.There's no way she could carry out a surgery like that. Alec, you don't really believe Verena can slice someone open and cure them, do you?"



Every timne Verena's name left Laura's mouth, a glint of scorn flashed in her eyes.



Annoyance rising, Alec slammed his fist against the coffee table, his expression severe. "Slater himself confirmed it, and Barrie heard every word when l spoke with him. Do you understand who the Lyons family is? Do you honestly think they would bother lying to us?"



Laura faltered, her lips trembling. "That has to be a joke,right?" Deep down, she still clung to disbelief.


Alec lost his temper when he saw she'd rather dismiss it as a joke than admit Verena's skill.


He shot to his feet, pointing a finger right at her face as his voice boomed, "Do you realize how terrifyingly powerful the Lyons family is? Compared to them, our family is nothing less than ants underfoot. They wouldn't waste their time deceiving us!"


The sound of his voice reached her,low and steady,and it struck something final in Laura. Whatever comforting lie she'd been clinging to slipped through her fingers.


Verena's strengths weren't the problem. What unsettled her was the truth buried beneath it all. She had placed all her hopes in the wrong child. The daughter she'd cherished, praised, and protected with everything she had turned out to shine far less than the one she'd cast aside. And now, to recognize Verena's worth felt like dragging her own failures into the light, like confessing she'd been blind all along.


Her knees gave out, and she sank into the sofa, Her mind suddenly recalled her conversation with Verena when she'd just arrived in Shoildon, before the Bennett family ever met her.


Back then, afraid Verena would humiliate her without a proper degree, Laura had ordered her to lie to the Bennett family, to say she was a graduate of Acorith College of Medicine. But Verena refused, boldly telling them she came from Pine Hill University instead.



The memory of her own face, flushed with fury and disbelief at that time, came rushing back. Yet now...


Her fingers dug into the armrest as she forced the words out. "Could it betrue... that Verena really did graduate from Pine Hill University?"


The name alone made Alec's breath catch. His head buzzed as he stared at her in shock.



"What are you talking about? Say it clearly!" His eyes widened, and he gripped her shoulders hard,demanding, "When did she ever tell you she was from Pine Hill University? Why didn't you tel: me something so important earlier?"


Alec's grip bit into Laura's shoulders, sending pain down her arms, but the weight of his questions made panic burn far more than the ache.


"... when she first mentioned it after coming to Shoildon, she sounded like she was making up wild stories, so l dismissed it. And honestly, even if I had told you then, you wouldn't have believed a word of it either."



Rage twisted through Alec, his teeth grinding hard.He shoved Laura aside and hissed through clenched jaws. "Foolish woman!"


Without another word, he stormed straight toward the study.


Inside,Alec dropped heavily into the office chair, his brow locked in a hard knot. For the first time, he saw how blind he had been to his eldest daughter. Verena had never concealed the truth, but their arrogance had kept them from seeing her worth. They had brushed her off as useless, refusing to hear her out. Gossip spread outside, painting her as selfish and deceitful, and he let it seep into his own mind. Time after time, he blamed her in his mind for disgracing the Willis family, even regretting her return. And when Laura had driven her out, he had let it happen without protest.


A long sigh escaped him as he buried his face in his hands, guilt pressing down until it was almost unbearable. Everything he had worked for could have been within reach if only he'd shown Verena a fraction of care. Instead, he had destroyed it with his own hands.



Then his thoughts snagged on a new question, and his movements stilled. Where had all those rumors about Verena come from? Hardly anyone had known of her existence before. Why would strangers target her so viciously?


Lifting his head, Alec reached for the computer with trembling fingers.


He dug into the night, searching relentlessly, until one group chat screenshot stopped him cold. His fists curled tight as he enlarged the image to be certain.



The chat was filled with the wealthy young people of Shoildon.


But what froze his blood was the familiar profile picture attached to one of the names. His own younger daughter, Kaia.


A bitter laugh pulled at his mouth, sharp with disbelief. The girl who had always acted gentle and dutiful was in fact the one who had started all the rumors about her sister.


The realization churned his stomach with fury, and for a moment, he wanted nothing more than to confront her. But sanity clawed him back. For now,making peace with Verena mattered most. As for Kaia-her reckoning would come later.


After Alec stormed away, Laura lay restless in bed,unable to find sleep. When she finally turned over with the thought of making warm milk, a shadow by her bedside jolted her into a scream. Her hand flew to the lamp switch, flooding the room with light, and she froze once she saw who it was.



"Alec, you nearly gave me a heart attack." She pressed herself against the headboard, trying to steady her breath.


His eyes lingered on her in icy silence. The longer he stared, the more unsettled she felt, until at last he spoke. "We owe Verena. Tomorrow, you're coming with me to give her a proper apology."






At the Bennett Mansion...


Flat on his back, Bobby held his phone above him,staring at his chat with Verena.


His thoughts tangled as he scrolled through their conversations, every word stirring an unease he couldn't shake. The way Verena wrote, the tone-he couldn't help but picture Kaia behind the screen.


Then it struck him like a blow. "That's right... Kaia was the one who gave me Verena's contact."


He bolted upright, clawing at his hair in frustration. 
How could he have been so gullible? Kaia was never reliable-half her words were lies. Yet he'd swallowed them whole without a second thought.


If Dr. Willis and Verena were one and the same, but he somehow had both numbers, then one of them had to be fake.



Determined to clear it up, Bobby snapped a screenshot of Verena's profile and forwarded it to the Dr. Willis account, adding a question: "Dr. Willis, is this one yours, too?"


The reply came quickly. "No."


Bobby dropped his phone and buried his face in his hands.


Damn it. That meant the Verena he had been messaging all this time was most likely Kaia pretending.


For the first time, doubt gnawed at his own intelligence. Knowing Kaia's talent for scheming, he had still sided with her against her sister without once checking the facts. What an idiot he had been. Even if he hadn't said those cruel things directly to the real Verena, it didn't erase the truth-he had spoken ill of her.


And worse, in his petty attempts to oppose her, he had made himself look utterly foolish.


The more he replayed it all, the heavier the shame sat in his chest, until he wanted to tear his hair out.


No, he couldn't let it end this way. He had to talk with Verena and explain, to show her he wasn't the complete fool he had acted like. She had to see he wasn't beyond saving.


No wonder Isaac had lost his temper with him every time he spoke ill of Verena.
###Chapter 81 A Meeting Between Bobby And Verena

Bobby leaned over and grabbed the phone he had tossed aside earlier.

His thumbs began flying across the keyboard.

Verena sat at the hotel room desk, wrapping up her work when her phone vibrated once.

One glance at the screen showed a message from Bobby.

"Dr. Willis, are you free tomorrow morning? I need to talk to you about something important. Can I come by?"

Curiosity flickered across Verena's face. The truth was, she and Bobby weren't close enough for private meetings yet.If anyone else had sent that message, she might have told them to text her or just call. Still,Bobby wasn't just anyone-he was lsaac's younger brother. Spending time with him felt a little like previewing her future family.

Her lips curved into a small smile as she responded, "Sure, let's have breakfast together."

That single reply had Bobby grinning from ear to ear, his excitement practically spilling over. Without hesitation, he snapped a screenshot of the chat and forwarded it to Slater.
"Look at this! Did you see that? My future sister-in-law literally said she's taking me out for breakfast!"Bobby wrote.

Slater responded immediately, "What the hell, man? Tell me the truth-what did you do to Dr. Willis?"

Instead of answering, Bobby fired off a cute nodding emoji to Verena, and then ignored Slater completely,enjoying how worked up his friend would get.

A moment later, he hopped off the bed and pulled open his closet, already thinking about what to wear.Meeting his future sister-in-law deserved nothing less than a strong first impression.
The following morning arrived. With his schedule lighter than usual, Isaac asked the driver to take him straight to Verena's hotel.
Only a couple of days had passed since they'd seen each other at the bar, but for him, it already felt far longer.
When they neared the hotel, Isaac had the car stop at the restaurant nearby.

He remembered Verena once mentioned that this place served a great breakfast.

Rolling himself inside, Isaac was quickly greeted by a waiter who guided him to a quiet corner and placed a menu in his hands.
His eyes skimmed the list of dishes, but before he could order, a voice drifted through the partition. "Dr.Willis, I'm not late,am l?"

From the other sidecame Verena's gentle reply. "No, I just arrived."

Isaac's fingers curled against the menu. Bobby... with Verena? Why were they meeting?

A frown creased his forehead as confusion settled in.

Noticing his silence, the waiter leaned in and suggested politely,our signature breakfast might interest you."
Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac closed the menu and lowered his voice. "I'm sorry, something urgent came up. I'll have to leave."

Unfazed, the waiter kept his professional smile. "Of course. We'll be happy to serve you next time."

As Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit, he glanced sideways. Through the semi-transparent partition, he caught sight of Bobby and Verena seated across from one another.
His gaze lingered on Bobby, dressed in a sharp suit with neatly styled hair-a look he rarely bothered with unless the event demanded it.

Though Isaac's face stayed composed, his eyes stayed fixed on the pair. They were completely absorbed in conversation, never once noticing him watching.
lsaac's hands pressed harder against the wheels before he pulled his eyes away and rolled out of therestaurant.
Once he was back inside the car, the driver glanced at him through the rearview miror. "Mr. Bennett, shouldwe go straight to Miss Willis' hotel now?
Lifting his gaze only slightly, lsaac gave him a faint look before turning toward the window. "No. Take mehome."
Their eyes met briefly, and the driver shivered, though the car's heater was running strong.He quickly nodded."Understood, Mr. Bennett."
Moments later, the car pulled away from the curb and left the restaurant behind.
Verena cut into her breakfast, noticing the young man across from her stealing quick glances
Bobby nearly got caught and ducked his head at once.
A laugh slipped from Verena as she asked, "Why are you sneaking looks at me like that?
She added playfully, "Don't tell me it's because l skipped makeup today and look awful.
Bobby shook his head with force. "Not at al! My perfect sis... um... Dr. Wilis, you're honestly the mostbeautiful woman l've ever met- swear l'm telling the truth!"
The words "perfect sister-in-law" nearly spilled before he bit down and stopped himself.
Verena hesitated for a moment, and then let a small smile form. "| believe you." For a few seconds, Bobby couldn't take his eyes off her. Her quiet warmth left him feeling guilty
Inside, his thoughts spiraled. This was the same woman he had gone out of his way to reject, yet she was sokind, so patient-and she had even saved him. Stil, he had slandered her to her future husband and mother-in-law. What kind of monster did that make him?
at most In his mind, a shadowy figure seemed to hover above, tallying up every one of his mistakes. Groaning, Bobby dragged his hands through his hair as his face turned bright red right there at the table.
###Chapter 82 Was The Patient Actually Isaac


With his jaw tight and shoulders squared, Bobby forced himself to meet Verena's gaze, drawing on every ounce of nerve he had left.

"Dr. Willis, I owe you the truth." His expression was grave. "The real reason I came here today was to apologize."

Verena didn't stop to react, but a brief flicker of surprise passed over her striking features as she kept eating.

"I made a mistake before," Bobby admitted, voice steady but regretful. "I judged you unfairly and repeated things I shouldn't have. For that,I'm sorry."

Her brows lifted as she glanced at him. "Oh? And what exactly did you say about me?"

The question broke open the dam, and Bobby's words spilled out faster than he could stop them.

"Let me explain," he began, leaning forward as if pleading his case. "When I first learned you would marry Isaac, I figured I'd ask your sister Kaia about you. But before I even got the chance, I saw a group chat where people were already gossiping about your looks. I thought to myself that Isaac deserved someone with good looks. Right at that moment, Kaia chimed in, implying that you were unattractive and bad-tempered."

He paused briefly, glancing at V/erena's unreadable face, and then went on. "After that, she made you out to be a clueless country girl who never went to college and didn't belong in the city. J-ater, when she sent a surveillance video to the group chat, we were convinced you had plotted to ruin her appearance."

Bobby hurried to add, "But now I know Kaia twisted everything on purpose."

A long breath slipped from Bobby as his shoulders sank. "At the time, I honestly believed you were that kind of woman. I couldn't stand the thought of someone like that marrying Isaac, let alone becoming part of our family. That's why I went behind the scenes and reached out to Kaia. She didn't want youin Isaac's life either, so we teamed up to break off the engagement. But I let myself get played. Kaia handed me an  account and told me it was yours. She pretended to be you and chatted with me using that account.In those conversations, she painted you as loud, crass, and completely unfit. That's where my opinion of you came from, and I texted back a lot of harsh words. It was only last night that I confirmed that account wasn't yours at all."

Some wounds, he knew, didn't heal just because excuses were offered.
"Dr. Willis, I truly regret it," Bobby pressed on, his lips tightening. "I let myself be deceived by Kaia, believed rumors without checking facts, and ended up hurting you."
His head dropped, shame pushing his gaze to the table. "What's worse, I repeated her lies to lsaac and my mother, exaggerating them just to sabotage your engagement.I went too far."
His voice dwindled until it was barely a whisper, his forehead nearly touching the table as the weight of his guilt bore down.
The restaurant stayed quiet, every word sinking into Verena's ears. For a moment, she was surprised-but then her lips curved into a small, almost amused smile, as though she were unbothered.

"Kaia never had a good word for me from the start," she said evenly. "So it doesn't shock me that she spread rumors."

Bobby's head jerked up, brows furrowed, his voice rising. "You're not angry?"

His desperation was plain, his sincerity almost painful, but Verena only smiled and shook her head gently."Why waste energy on people who don't matter? The only thing that matters is that Isaac trusts me."

There was no bitterness in her voice, only a quiet grace that left her looking composed, untouchable, and dignified.
Unlike Kaia's bitter description of her, Verena showed none of that smnall-minded spite, which left Bobby feeling ashamed of himself.

Heat climbed across his face and neck until even his ears flushed red.

Clutching the edge of the table, his knuckles taut, he blurted, "Dr. Willis, I've said awful things about you to both lsaac and my mother. l tried in every way l could to tear the two of you apart. You have every reason tohate me. lf it helps, you can hit me or yell at me-'ll take it, as long as it eases your anger.. as long as youdon't despise me forever.
The remorse in his voice was impossible to miss, though Verena remained calm, her anger nonexistent
"There's no need for that," she replied with quiet seriousness. "People are complicated, and it's natural tohave selfish thoughts, You judaed me throuah Kaia's words, and that was your mistake, but it doesn't shockme."
Her eyes softened as she continued, "Still, Bobby, since l'll be your sister-in-law, let me remind you ofsomething: never rely on gossip to define a person. You only understand someone through time and youiown judgment."
She turned her gaze aside, a faint laugh threading through her words. "And lsaac? From the very start, hisfeelings toward me haven't changed. That means whatever you told him didn't shake him. in fact, youhelped without meaning to-you tested his loyalty for me.
Her remark carried a touch of humor.
The warmth in her smile made Bobby's heart stumble. The way her entire presence shifted when she spokeof'lsaac-so gentle, so genuine-explained everything. Of course she was the right match for lsaac.
But her lightness only deepened his shame. That was real grace, the kind he lacked. Compared to her steadiness, Bobby felt like a clumsy child, painfully immature.
Overcome with embarrassment, he lowered his head again until his forehead nearly touched the table.
Verena'watched him with amusement, and a sudden laugh slipped out.
For the first time, she thought lsaac's younger brother was oddly entertaining-enough to stir a small envyin her heart.
Then Bobby jerked upright, as though struck by a thought
"Oh, right!" he eclaimed. "Dr. Wilis, when you said you were treating a patient with leg paralysis at Slater's place-was it actually lsaac?" When she nodded, his eyes lit up. "So tell me, how is he now? Can his legs really recover?"Verena answered plainly, "it's still the beginning of treatment, so there's no final conclusion yet. But restassured, l'll give it everything l have."
Remembering how she had restored Barrie's leg, Bobby felt certain she could do the same again. Herpromise eased him instantly, and the weight pressing on his chest finally lifted.

###Chapter 83 Where Did You Go
After everything was made clear, Bobby and Verena ate their breakfast in silence.
Though Bobby still carried a trace of awkwardness and shame, sharing a private breakfast with his flawless sister-in-law felt like standing face-to-face with a childhood idol. Naturally, he was thrilled. Once he returned, he would surely brag about this encounter to Slater.

When breakfast was done, they went their separate ways.
Verena returned to the hotel, while Bobby drove back home.

The moment he stepped into the living room, Bobby caught sight of Isaac sitting squarely on the sofa,positioned directly toward the entrance, as though he had been waiting.
A flicker of surprise darted through Bobby's mind. At this hour, Isaac was usually buried in work at the company-why was he still at home?
Before Bobby could open his mouth to greet him, Isaac spoke first. "You're back."
Bobby's lips parted but froze midway, as though strung with silent questions. Had he heard correctly? Isaac showing concern for him? That was something new. Isaac had never cared about his comings andgoings.Even if he stumbled home at dawn after a wild night, Isaac never uttered a word. So why now...
Bobby shifted uneasily, stealing a glance outside as if expecting the skies themselves to signal an unusual omen.

Snapping out of it, he asked carefully, "Isaac, did you need something from me?"
Isaac's gaze lingered briefly on Bobby's overly formal suit, and then slid away. Without answering directly,he gestured at the seat beside him. "Sit."

Bewildered, Bobby obeyed.
Isaac lifted a cup of coffee from the table, his fingers curving in a deliberate grace. He blew across the Fun Merge surface, took a sip, and lowered his eyes. The rising steam blurred his vision, pricking faintly at his eyes.
After a pause, Isaac asked in a voice that seemed calm, almost casual, "Haven't seen you at the company lately. Something troubling you?"
Unlike Isaac's steady tone, Bobby's heart lurched. Troubling him? If Isaac ever discovered that each missed day at the office was spent dealing with his fiancée, Bobby's life would not be worth a dime.
Wanting no part in that danger, Bobby shook his head with all the force he could muster. "No, no, no,nothing at all."
He dared not even entertain such thoughts anymore-better to bury them where they belonged.
Isaac rested his fingers on the table's edge, tapping lightly. Each hollow thud sounded like a slow drumbeat.His gaze lifted, calm but probing.

"Out so early today. Where did you go?"

Bobby felt another chill crawl down his spine. What kind of perilous question was this? Why was Isaac cornering him with words that felt like a knife's edge between life and death?

Thinking of the harsh remarks he had once made about Verena, Bobby dared not confess he had just met her.

Scratching his head, his face flushed crimson, he stammered, "Just... personal matters. Isaac, please don't ask."

If Isaac pressed further, Bobby would have no courage leftto face either him or Verena. After all, hadn't he once warned that if Isaac truly married Verena, he would regret it? And yet-ironically-the one regretting now was him. Wasn't this like swallowing his own pride wwhole?
Bobby's halting reply was a far cry from his usual lighthearted manner.
Isaac's tapping ceased. He studied Bobby's awkwardness-the reddened face, the restless hands.

He knew Bobby's character too well, as his brother had stuck close to him since childhood.
And this expression-lsaac had seen it once before, when Bobby first entered high school and secretly admired a girl.

The resemblance now was uncanny.

Suddenly, Isaac remembered Bobby's strong opposition to his relationship with Verena. And considering his own condition now...

Isaac's Adam's apple shifted as he clasped his hands on his lap, his voice turning grave. "Bobby, I've always told you: the things you should not do, never do; the thoughts you should not harbor, never let them take root; and the desires you cannot force, never force. Before you act, you should consider whether your action will wound others."

The abrupt weight in his tone left Bobby startled. But he quickly concluded Isaac was simply scolding him for his past recklessness. With a forced cheer, he nodded. "I understand. I'l remember your words."

Isaac's brows drew together slightly as he searched Bobby's eyes, as though confirming his sincerity. After a long moment, he looked away, expression unreadable.

Silence thickened across the room.

Bobby admired Isaac more than anyone, yet feared him more than anyone too-especially when he wore that calm,impenetrable mask.

The stillness pressed in, leaving Bobby restless beneath its weight.

Feigning ease, he rose to his feet. "Isaac, if there's nothing else, I'll head to my room."

As he watched his brother's retreating figure ascend the stairs, Isaac narrowed his eyes.

Moments later, his cold voice drifted through the room. "Andres, prepare the car."



After breakfast with Bobby, Verena returned to the hotel and immersed herself in her work.

She was carefully sorting through her materials when the doorbell rang. A flicker of curiosity flashed in her eyes. Not long ago, she would have immediately thought it was isaac. Butever since Laura's uninvited appearance, she could not be sure whether the visitor was friend or foe.
Marking her place on the document, she rose to open the door
The instant the door swung open, a firm hand seized her wrist, and before she could draw breath, she waspulled into lsaac's lap,
Startled yet delighted, Verena gasped, "What are you-mph!"
Her words were swallowed by the cool press of his lips
He guided her hand to his shoulder, circling her waist with one arm, while his other hand skillfully turned the
wheelchair into the room and shut the door with finality.
The entire movement flowed with unbroken rhythm, not a beat wasted.
Though startled at first, Verena quickly melted into his embrace, her arms winding around his neck as shereturned his kiss.
It was urgent, yet tender, stirring a hunger that grew the more she yielded
lt was less a kiss than a search for solace.
Looking down from where she sat, Verena saw him gazing upward, lips pressed with unwavering devotion.lsaac parted her lips, gently catching her tongue between his teeth, drawing from her a shiver and a faintwhimper before he let go
The room was warm with the hotel's heating, and Verena, having come in from outside, wore only a light outfit.
Breaking from her lips, saac lowered his head, his nose brushing against her collarbone and bare shoulderHer slender frame and loose clothing made her seem even more delicate, as though one careless breathmight shatter her.
He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, and then stiled-calming himself as though resisting the pull of impulse
###Chapter 84 Let's Register Our Marriage Tomorrow

In Isaac's eyes, his action was born of jealousy. Utterly absurd.

Yet he had to admit to himself, the green-eyed monster had taken hold of him. He envied his own younger brother, of all people.

Bobby possessed the kind of background and capability that matched his own, along with the advantage of a strong and healthy body. Standing side by side, Bobby seemed far more fitting for Verena. Any woman weighing her options would almost certainly pick Bobby. And yet...

Isaac's arms tightened, holding Verena as though she were his anchor in a storm.

He would never permit anyone to steal her away-not even his own brother. That was a line he could never allow to be crossed.

His lashes, thick and unyielding, drooped and brushed against Verena's skin, leaving her itching, while his uneven breaths fanned over her bare shoulder, summoning tiny goosebumps.

Verena instinctively drew back her shoulders, her slender fingers tracing idle circles in his hair.

Her voice, husky yet soft, broke the stillness. "Isaac, you're different today... what's troubling you?"

She knew him well enough to sense it. That kiss earlier had not belonged to the lsaac she had grown accustomed to after his memory loss. Something had stirred him.
Isaac raised his head and brushed her lips with his own, his breath deep, steady, almost deliberate. Instead of replying, he countered, "Do you have feelings for me?"
His tone was serious, the kind of question not asked in passing.

Verena's lips curved faintly, her eyes carrying quiet mirth. "Why such a sudden question?"

The light in Isaac's eyes dimmed; her answer had evaded him. With deliberate care, he tilted her chin upward,his gaze lingering on her lips-rosy, moist, and impossibly tempoting. Narrowing his eyes slightly, his breath deepened. "Forget it," he murmured. "Whether you do or not, it's
enough that l love you."
And before another word could rise between them, he kissed her again.
This time, it was no gentle touch. He claimed every breath she drew, fierce and demanding, as though he
could tether her soul to his.
He held her so tightly their chests pressed together, each heartbeat a drumbeat of longing. Every motionevery inhalation revealed the cracks in his armor-his deep-rooted insecurity.
At last, their mingled breaths slowed, and silence reclaimed the room.
Verena, lips tingling and numb, gasped for air, her chest heaving before she steadied herself.
When she had gathered her composure, she gently lifted lsaac's head from her shoulder. "lsaac, truly...
what's happening with you?"
At first, she was only curious about his unusual behavior. Now, she needed an answer.
Isaac lowered his gaze, unwiling to unveil the truth. "it's nothing," he said softly. "Jjust some work matters
wearing me down."
His eyes glimmered faintly as he spoke, and Verena frowned. She could see right through it
Work matters wearing him down? For lsaac, who thrived on work like air? That excuse wouldn't convince asoul.
Her lips pressed into a thin line. "You...
Before she could continue, lsaac cut across her words. "Because of your family affairs, our marriage wasdelayed once before."
She blinked, unsure why he suddenly raised the subject, And then he declared, "Let's register our marriagetomorrow."
Not a request. A decision carved in stone. Verena studied him in disbelief, searching for a trace of jest-there was none.
"So suddenly?" she asked.
At that, a flicker of unease flashed through his eyes, his voice stiff. "You don't want to?"
Though caught off guard by his abruptness, once she collected herself, she nodded. "Of course I do."
The following morning, Isaac was already waiting outside Verena's hotel.
After dressing and gathering her documents, she was about to leave when a message from him lit up her phone: "Remember to bring the documents."
Ever since leaving her the previous day, he had been sending the same reminder, as though chanting a mantra, terrified she might have second thoughts.
Standing by the elevator, Verena typed back, "I know. If you scroll through our chat, you'll see you've reminded me more than twenty times already."
When she stepped outside, a black car waited by the roadside.
The driver, spotting her, hurried forward to open the door.
Verena offered a smile of thanks. Once she was seated, Isaac's first words were, "The documents?"
Half amused,half exasperated, she pulled them from her bag. "Why don't you hold onto them yourself?"
He accepted them, and only then did his tension seem to dissolve, a faint smile tuggingat his lips.
The car rolled forward toward the courthouse.
Isaac picked up her ID card, eyes resting on the photo. ID pictures often betrayed their owners-washed-out faces,awkward expressions. But hers was different. Her features were refined, her complexion smooth as porcelain. Dressed in a black jacket, she looked spirited, though the fit was slightly oversized, broadening her shoulders unnaturally-a borrowed garment, no doubt.
His gaze lingered. Verena noticed. Did he remember something? "Something on your mind?" she asked.

Isaac lifted his head, earnest as ever. "Very beautiful."
Verena blinked, taken aback, and then tilted her head. "That's all?"

Sensing her dissatisfaction, he hesitated before adding, "I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you."
Her laughter slipped out softly. He hadn't remembered the past. She nodded, saying nothing more.
Isaac frowned, unsure if her reaction was delight or disappointment.
She turned her gaze toward the window, catching sight of the card in his hand. That very card had been obtained under his insistence. On that day, she'd shown up in only a white blouse. Because ID photos required dark clothing, Isaac had wordlessly stripped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Seeing him scrutinize the photo a moment ago, she had thought he might have recalled a fragment of that moment.But perhaps... memories required patience.

Soon, the car drew to a stop before the courthouse.

They got out, Verena pushing his wheelchair forward.
Inside, the hall was quiet, with few people about. Following the staff's guidance, they filled in their forms.

Just as the final step approached, Isaac caught hushed voices behind him.

"Isn't it strange, marrying a man with a disability?" a man whispered.
His companion nudged him sharply, murmuring, "Shh, they'll hear you," before the two stifled laughter.
###Chapter 85 Public Declaration


Verena bent down beside Isaac, brushed a quick kiss across his cheek, and teased, "Snap out of it, dreamer.We're almost up."

The sound of her voice pulled him from his drifting thoughts, and when he turned toward her, a quiet smile spread across his face.

Their paperwork was finalized soon after.

An attendant handed over their marriage documents, and the pair left the courthouse with them clutched in their hands.

Verena lifted her copy proudly and nudged Isaac to raise his as well so they could snap a picture together.

Grinning brightly, she announced, "From this moment on, Mr. Bennett, you belong to me as my husband."

A strange haze lingered over Isaac as they left the courthouse, the reality of it sinking in slowly.

Everything felt unreal until Verena's playful declaration grounded him. Maybe their choice had been sudden,but there was no part of him that regretted it.

His head dipped, and a genuine smile curved his lips.

When he looked back up, Verena was already tapping away on her phone. He chuckled and asked, "What are you plotting now?"

Verena held her phone close to his face with a sly grin, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I'm telling the world,obviously."

On the glowing screen was her newest post: "Married to Mr. Bennett," with the proud photo of their marriage documents beneath it.

There was a light in Isaac's eyes, warm and full, and his chest tightened with something sweet, as if his heart had softened into syrup, slow and thick and impossible to resist. Pointing at the screen, he cleared his throat lightly. "Mind sending me that picture?"
Catching his meaning at once, Verena slipped the phone into her pocket, her expression deliberately puzzled. She pretended to frown and asked, "And what exactly do you need it for?"
The question caught him off guard, though it only took a second to realize she was toying with him.
A faint blush touched his face as he blinked and answered softly, "I want to post it myself."
His words slipped out so softly that the awkwardness in his tone was impossible to miss.
Heat rushed to Isaac's ears, and the sight of it sent Verena into a fit of laughter she couldn't contain.
She slipped behind him, leaned close enough for her breath to brush his ear, and whispered, "I already sent it over. Take a look at your phone."
Then, without waiting for a response, she gave the wheelchair a gentle push forward.
Pulling out his phone, Isaac saw a fresh notification waiting for him with her name attached.
Since he had silenced his device earlier in the courthouse, the message had gone unnoticed until now.
Tapping it open, he found the photo she had taken, and for the first time, he composed a social media post of his own.
His update read, "Fromn this moment, Verena, I am your husband."
The photo of their marriage documents stood proudly beneath the words.
Within moments, Shoildon's upper circles lit up with activity.
In the exclusive chat for the Shoildon's socialites, screenshots of Isaac's post spread like wildfire.
"Kailee, didn't your husband just strike a deal with Bennett Group? Were you aware of this?"
"You're kidding!"
"The Bennett family announced an alliance not long ago, and now they're officially married? That was fast!"
The chat turned into chaos, so much so that Kailee White's reply vanished under the flood of messages.

It wasn't until after the group chat was temporarily muted by the administrator that the group members noticed her reply. "I'm not really sure. My husband told me the wedding got pushed back, but obviously there's more to it than that."

When the group chat was unmuted again, the flood of messages started all over.

Inside the group chat for Shoildon's businessmen, new messages popped up one after another.

"Anyone else see the news about Isaac tying the knot?"

"I did! Thought my eyes were playing tricks from staring at reports all day."

"His decision makes no sense to me."

"Didn't he just move against the Willis family? I figured the wedding was canceled-so how did the registration suddenly happen?"

"The Willis family doesn't measure up to the Bennett family at all. Their eldest daughter is just a puppet.No way Isaac would want her."

"You're getting it wrong. The fact that he posted the marriage himself proves he values the Willis family's eldest daughter."

Meanwhile, in the wealthy young people's group chat, Isaac's post was screenshotted and sent around nonstop.

Shock filled the thread, with half the group dropping nothing but strings of exclamation marks.

"Kaia, can you believe it? Verena actually signed with Isaac!"

"Are my eyes broken,or did that really happen?"

"The girl from that nowhere town actually managed to land him."

"A country nobody ended up as Isaac's wife, and I can't even figure out why. What do I lack compared to her? And of all things, this is the very first post he's ever made! Ugh!" "Doesn't matter. She's probably nothing special to look at."

"Can you believe it? The golden boy ended up picking that woman. What a disgrace!"

Kaia scrolled through the flood of messages without typing a word.

Reading the insults aimed at Verena should have thrilled her, but Isaac's public declaration gnawed at her pride. Rage flared so strong she nearly hurled her phone, because deep down she knew lsaac was serious about this marriage. The certainty of it ate her alive with jealousy.

Across the chat, Slater's eyes narrowed as he read the comments, and he blurted out, "Unbelievable. Kaia's lies really kicked up a mess. How dare they drag Dr. Willis through the dirt?"

Closing the app with finality, Slater wasted no time and dialed Bobby directly.

The line connected before the first ring even ended.

"I'm losing it right now!" Slater exclaimed.

"Me too!" Bobby's voice echoed his frustration in perfect sync.

"Tell me, are wegoing to defend our goddess or not?" said Bobby quickly, his words tumbling out in a rush.

Slater didn't hesitate. "Damn right we are. Every single one of those people trashing Dr. Willis is going to regret it. And Kaia? She won't get away with it either."

Bobby's tone sharpened. "So, what's the plan?"

"Simple," Slater retorted. "Didn't you brag yesterday about snapping that gorgeous side profile of Dr. Willis?Hand it over. I need it now."

Bobby had guarded that picture the day before, brushing off Slater's demands. But now that it could serve a purpose, he sent it without complaint.

The moment the photo appeared on his screen, Slater's fingers flew across his keyboard, hammering out the words for a bold social media post.

"People keep underestimating Verena, but I've had enough of the nonsense. Time to clear the air. The truth is simple-Dr. Verena Wilis was the one who healed my grandfather's leg. Kaia's claim that she did itherself? Utter fiction. And honestly, who in their right mind would fall for such a lie?
Let's be real--those who act like fragile saints in front of others often have the darkest secrets. Reputationmatters, and l don't need to explain further. This so-called kind and gentle girl? She slanders her own sisterspreads lies, and pretends she's innocent, Tell me, Kaia, doesn't your conscience scream at you?Here's another thing. Some of you have been calling Verena unattractive, unpolished, just a country girwithout brains or background., Yet world-class specialists failed to solve my grandfather's condition, and shepulled it off. Does that sound lilke ignorance to you? Don't make me laugh. And about her looks-there's nodebate. Take one glance at this photo and you'll understand exactly why l call her a goddess."Slater attached the stunning side-profile shot of Verena and, with no hesitation, pressed the publish button
###Chapter 86 i'm Not Buying That Story
When lsaac announced his marriage online, it had already sent shockwaves through high society, setting off
a flurry of excited chatter among the elite.
So the moment Slater made his own post, the conversations exploded without missing a beat
"Wow, can you believe this?"
'ls this actually happening, or did someone mess up the details?
'I'm so stunned by this announcement, l almost dropped my phone!'
"ls something in the air today? lsaac just posted about his wedding, Kaia's innocent act got blown apart, andthe truth came out that Verena puled off a miracle for Barrie's leg. it's like every secret dropped at once!"
"Hold up, you're saying Verena really fixed Barrie's leg?"
"For ages, everyone claimed nothing could be done for Barrie's condition. Who knew Verena had this kindof talent?"
"Hang on, let's not overlook what's right in front of us. Take another look at that photo-is that reallyVerena? ls this the 'just alright' girl Kaia talked about? lf that's 'alright, sign me up!"
"Anyone calling Verena 'alright' clearly needs their eyes checked. Kaia must not have been payingattention."
'Now it all makes sense. No matter what rumors people spread about Verena, saac never budged. lf i foundsomeone with her looks and ability, i'd want to marry her, too!"
'So if that's how things are, then Kaia's been misleading us the whole time. Someone who can cure Barriecan't be just a small-town practitioner. On top of that, Verena is obviously gorgeous, and Kaia tried to makeus think otherwise. And honestly, who believes Verena never went to college? i'm not buying that story at
all "Imagine a sister starting rumors about her own family. It's wild how you can think you know someone and be so wrong!"

"Damn! I just remembered something huge!"

The comment sections exploded with replies, filled with question marks and demands for more information.

"Come on, out with it! Don't leave us guessing!"

The message came through instantly. "Didn't Kaia claim in the group chat that Verena was pretending to be a Pine Hill University graduate, calling her a liar? Now, with everything coming to light, it really makes you wonder who's telling the truth. If Verena managed to cure Barrie, maybe she did graduate from Pine Hill."

People jumped in, agreeing right away. "Honestly, you might have figured it out!"

Scrolling through Slater's post and the flood of incoming comments, Kaia felt her mood sour instantly.

By choosing to share it online, Slater had dragged her into the spotlight and left her to face the fallout like a criminal paraded before a crowd.

Every secret she'd tried to keep was now exposed in front of everyone, and Kaia, whose pride relied so much on her reputation,could barely stomach it.

Slater's decision to air the truth so brazenly left her in disbelief, her dignity stomped on in public.

Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles paled, resentment flaring in her eyes despite the color draining from her cheeks.

A sudden string of notification chimes interrupted her thoughts as so-called friends reached out.

Each message she read stung a little more, reminding her how quickly these people clung to whoever seemed powerful at the moment.

"Did you see what Slater posted? Is it true or not?"

"You weren't jealous enough to start rumnors about Verena, were you?"

"Why haven't you said anything about Slater's announcement, Kaia?" Kaia clenched her teeth so tightly the grinding noise cut through the silence like a warning.

The ones who once rushed to praise her, clinging to thin friendships and chasing approval when they believed she had saved Barrie, had now changed their tune the second things went wrong. Not one of them stayed loyal. They were nothing but hypocrites dressed up as friends.

Anger surged through Kaia as her grip tightened around her phone, her entire body shaking. The fury boiled over, and she snapped, "You wretches!"

Without a second thought, she shut off the screen and threw the phone to the floor with as much force as she could muster.
###Chapter 87 Come In And Take A Bath


Kaia's chest rose and fell in sharp bursts, every breath ragged and loud. Fury widened her eyes, and her fists clenched so tight that her nails pierced skin she no longer felt. The fire in her gaze burned far hotter than any pain her body registered.

Hatred thundered inside her, echoing like a storm without end. Verena's name pounded through her mind-over and over, relentless.

Each repetition carried the same venom, as though uttering the name alone could erase Verena from existence. It was always the same. Whenever Verena entered her world, something precious was stolen away.

Her hatred had no limits.

Verena had stolen their parents' attention with ease. Verena had been the one to heal Barrie's injured leg.Verena had won Isaac's affection without even trying, while Kaia had hidden her love for him for years. Why had he given his heart so freely to her rival? And now, Slater's defense of Verena's reputation had sealed her humiliation, parading Verena's brilliance while reducing Kaia to a pitiful joke.

A wave of helplessness swept over her, and she collapsed onto the bed, clutching the sheets with desperate strength.

Her teeth sank into the inside of her lip, the sting of blood flooding her mouth with bitterness.

Through the rage, her eyes gleamed with a dangerous resolve. She would never surrender.

If Verena's claim to fame was curing Barrie's leg, so what? Against Evelyn Rowe,the world-renowned medical legend, Verena's so-called brilliance would crumble.

Wendell had assured her that when Evelyn arrived at Acorith College of Medicine to give a lecture, a seat would be kept aside with her name on it.

No price was too high, and no effort too great-Kaia had resolved that she would claim the role of Evelyn's final apprentice. Once that happened, she would shine across the medical world just as Evelyn had. And really, what did Verena's degree from Pine Hill University matter then?

Bloodshot eyes gleamed with obsession, and Kaia's lips stretched into a smile that carried nothing but malice.



Her mind spun with ambition. Years of training under Evelyn would give her the credentials to pursue a doctorate at PineHill University itself, and the glory of being Evelyn's chosen student would crush whatever spotlight Verena held.

Kaia muttered to herself, "Those mocking me today will kneel and beg for my recognition someday."

.-.

Isaac slipped his phone into his pocket after uploading the post.

Verena guided him into the waiting car. The driver swung the door closed, climbed into his seat, and opened his mouth to ask for directions when Verena spoke first. "Take me back to the hotel, please."

"Understood," the driver replied with quiet respect, turning the wheel as the car eased onto the road.

From the back seat, Isaac's voice cut through, edged with the faintest irritation. just registered our marriage, and you still want to return to the hotel?"

Anyone else might have missed the shift in tone, but the driver had worked under him long enough to notice.

Without hesitation, he pulled over and stayed silent, making himself invisible.

Isaac pressed into the seatback, his eyes settling on Verena. His brow creased, and the hand on his lap tightened into a fist.

Amusement flickered across her face, and a laugh slipped free. That tiny habit of his, clenching his hand whenever anger or frustration stirred, had never left him, not even after losing his memories.

Isaac's eyes narrowed the moment her laugh rang out. To Verena, his look carried a silent protest that said, "We're already married, and you're still planning to walk away? Given my state,how could you laugh at me like that?"

Her amusement faded quickly as she steadied herself against the seat and leaned in toward him. "The registry gave us papers, yes, but that isn't a wedding. If I moved into your house right now, it wouldn't sit right.What would your mother think of me?"

Those words, full of reason rather than rejection, softened the edge of his mood.

His gaze dropped, taking in the liveliness of her expression. Almost without thought, he reached up, lifted her chin lightly, and said with a teasing curve of his lips, "So you're worried about my mom's opinion?"

The gesture caught heroff guard, leaving her lips parted in brief surprise.

Recovering quickly, Verena flashed a sly smile, her eyes glinting with playful charm. "Of course I am.Caring about her means I'm caring about you."

Her tone was bright, the kind of sweetness that tugged at his chest as if daring him not to give in.

Isaac fixed his eyes on Verena, the look heavy with curiosity that burned deep. Her playful manner was obvious, carrying the edge of a flirt. Could it be that beneath all the things she held close, there was also a real place in her heart for him?

Realization struck him hard, a rush of warmth igniting beneath his calm exterior. She cared about him-enough to care about how his family might see her.

The thought amused him, and his eyes gleamed with quiet laughter.

He let go of her chin and turned toward the window, pressing his fist lightly to his lips as though that could keep the laugh inside.

Verena tilted her head, catching the smile he couldn't quite hide. With a playful poke at his arm, she said,"Why bother holding it back? If you're happy, then laugh. Don't make me drag it out of you."

His lips betrayed him, curving upward even as he tried to resist.

Clearing his throat, Isaac caught her hand before she could poke him again. His voice lowered, tender but firm."What happens in my home is up to me. No one else gets a say. When you're with me, don't waste a thought on my mother or anyone else. Do as you like."

After a sort silence, his voice shifted. "Forget it. I've got a place in the Seraphina Villas. I live there alone.How about coming there with me?"

Traditional expectations never carried much weight for Verena. Since the papers were already signed,sharing a home seemed natural. MMore importantly, she had something planned for him tonight.

Her decision came after a moment's thought. "Alright, but we'Il need to swing by the hotel first. I want to grab mythings."

Seeing her agree instantly eased the tension in Isaac's mood.

"Good," he said with a short nod before turning forward and instructing the driver. "Take us to the hotel first."

The driver acknowledged the order and guided the car smoothly into the traffic.

Back at the hotel, Verena packed while the staff gathered her luggage and brought it downstairs.

Her belongings were simple-a single suitcase and a few pieces of medical equipment.

With everything loaded into the trunk, the driver pulled away, steering them toward Seraphina Villas.

Located in the finest district of Shoildon, the villa sat quietly apart from the city's noise, an oasis surrounded by luxury.

The room carried an understated sense of luxury, and the wide spotless windows, gleaming in the light,revealed the touch of frequent professional care.

"If something about the place bothers you, let my assistant know. Adjustments can be made anytime," Isaac said evenly.

Verena turned back to him with an easy smile. "That won't be necessary.It already feels perfect to me."
 
Then her expression shifted with sudden curiosity. "Where's the bathroom?" Isaac pointed casually toward the hall. "Straight ahead, then left."

He directed her to the guest bath, assuming she would prefer more space before settlingin fully.

With a small nod, Verena carried a bag toward the bathroom, its contents hidden from his view.

Alone in the living room, Isaac poured himself a glass of water and drank slowly. Minutes passed in silence,and he finally leaned forward to call out when her voice drifted from behind the bathroom door."Isaac,come in and take a bath!"
###Chapter 88 Kiss Me If You Want


A sharp clink rang out as Isaac's grip slipped, sending the glass tumbler toppling onto the coffee table with a noisy crash. Water splashed out, soaking into his trousers and leaving a dark, unmistakable patch.

Color rushed to Isaac's cheeks as he scrambled to retrieve the glass. He cleared his throat, pretending nothing was wrong, and answered Verena, "N-no, that's alright. I'll take a bath on my own later."

Marriage paperwork might have been finished, but that did not make it easy for lsaac to let go of his self-doubt or bare his vulnerabilities so quickly, even for something as simple as a shared bath.

The house wNas quiet, which made it easy for Verena to catch every/bit of the scene outside the bathroom.

A suspicion grew in her mind that lsaac had missed her meaning entirely, and she decided to have some fun with him.

Moving toward the bathroom door, she folded her arms and leaned against the frame. Her lips curled in a teasing smile as she watched him closely, her eyes bright and mischievous.

"Isaac, the bath is ready. We just got married today, and you're already planning to leave me hanging? Isn't that just a little bit heartless?" she said, her voice softening as she stretched out the last part like a playful complaint.

From the very beginning, Verena always seemed to know the perfect way to keep him off balance. That was what Isaac believed.

Isaac knew his own body's limits better than anyone. Even though Verena had seen the damage to his legs countless times, he still felt uneasy about letting her see all of him. There was more to it, too. Living with the reality of his condition, he dreaded the idea of exposing his physical shortcomings, especially when it came to intimacy. The thought only deepened his sense of shame.

"Isaac, come on, don't leave me waiting. The water is going to turn cold soon. Are you really going to let me shiver in here?" Verena called out, her tone playful yet persistent. Refusing her seemed impossible, but Isaac wanted to protest. Looking up, he caught sight of her open expression and gentle concern in her eyes. In that moment, every argument vanished, and he realized there was no way he could turn her down.

Isaac set his jaw, drawing in a breath for courage, and guided his wheelchair toward the bathroom.

Verena caught sight of him coming closer, one eyebrow arching upward while her lips curled into a mischievous grin.

When Isaac rolled inside, the scent of herbs greeted him, sharp and comforting. Steam drifted above the bath,hinting at the heat within.

For a moment, Isaac stared in confusion, and then the truth dawned on him and his cheeks reddened in embarrassment.

"Is this for treatment?" he asked, his voice quiet.

Laughter sparkled in Verena's eyes as she nodded, her face all wide-eyed innocence. "Of course. What else did you think I asked you to comein here for?"

Isaac's ears burned as he pressed his lips together,staying silent.

Amusement flickered in Verena's expression as she circled behind him, her arms slipping around his neck.Cool fingertips crept under his suit jacket, stopping at the first button of his shirt, playing with it teasingly.

A gentle chill passed through the thin cotton and settled on Isaac's chest, sending his Adam's apple moving up and down as he swallowed.

Every muscle in Isaac's body tensed, his neck stretching as he tried to block out the cold touch against his warm skin.

Verena leaned in close, her lips grazing the edge of his ear as she spoke with a light laugh in her voice."Surely you didn't think I invited you in here for something romantic, did you? Isaac, I just moved in, and you're already misbehaving?"

The first button was undone, and her hand inched further, starting to undo another button, but Isaac caught her hand and pulled her down so she landed squarely on his lap.

"Enough, Verena. You have to stop teasing me," he said, his breath growing heavier, voice low and warning.

Finally, seeing his face flushed and serious, Verena softened.

Her forehead rested gently against his as she whispered, "You don't need to hold back, Isaac. Kiss me if you want. It'll help you heal, you know."

No explanation was needed. Isaac understood perfectly what she meant about his health.

Isaac's grip tightened around her wrist as he brought his other hand up to cradle the back of her head.Suddenly, he leaned in, his lips claiming hers in a kiss that started soft but quickly grew deeper.

Before long, the bathroom was filled with the sound of their breathing, each moment more heated than the last.

After what felt like ages, quiet settled around them.

Breathing hard, Verena slumped against his shoulder, her mind spinning with disbelief. She had only told him not to hold back his feelings-she hadn't expected him to take her so literally.

Isaac's arms slid around her waist, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head, eyes lowered in affection.

Once she gathered herself, Verena moved to help Isaac out of his clothes, supporting him as she guided him into the waiting tub.

Steam rose from the water, which was tinged with the rich brown color of medicinal herbs, hiding anything beneath the surface from view.

That detail allowed Isaac a moment of relief, easing some of the self-consciousness he felt.

After soaking in the bath, heat colored Isaac's cheeks and sweat clung to his skin.

Verena lifted him gently, wrapping him in a soft robe as he reached for the wheels of his chair to leave.She placed a gentle hand on his arm to stop him.

"Hold on, you're not done yet. The herbal bath is just the start. You need a massage next, and after that, a special treatment. Let's begin with your legs."

Taking a seat nearby, she loosened the robe and began working her hands over his legs, her fingers skillfully pressing and kneading each spot.

Her touch moved up from his ankle, pausing at key points that might help his body heal and regain strength.

Even though his legs were numb, watching her careful, attentive movements made Isaac's throat tighten, his Adam's apple moving twice as he gripped the sides of the chair.

Sweat dotted his forehead by the end of the massage. Once finished, Verena rolled his chair toward the elevator and together they rode upstairs.

As the doors opened, she glanced his way and asked, "Which one is our room?"

Hearing her say "our room" sent a small shock through Isaac. The simple words made it clear-she had no plans for separate bedrooms.

A subtle smile threatened to break through Isaac's tightly closed lips. Her words made it clear she had forgotten his warning from the very first day they met. Deciding not to bring it up, he chose to let it slip from his mind as well.

A nod toward the far end of the hall signaled the answer. "Our room is at the very end," he remarked.

Verena, walking just behind him, missed the way happiness flickered across his face.

They entered together, and Verena moved quickly to help lsaac onto the bed before reaching into her medical kit for a set of needles, ready to begin the special therapy.

Throughout the treatment, she checked in as always, asking him what he could feel.

As usual, Isaac shook his head. However, this time, with warmth lingering from the herbal soak, he failed to notice the faint burning that flickered through his legs.

Once the last needle was removed, Verena neatly packed away her tools.

Isaac grabbed his phone. A glance at it revealed a long list of missed calls waiting on the screen.
The number surprised him-more than a dozen, and every one came from Bobby.Isaac's brow creased as he stared at the notifications
Opening the chat app, he found message after message piled up from Bobby, nearly twenty in all. Each onerepeated the same thing: "You and Dr. Willis got married!"
Isaac pressed his lips together again, puzzled by Bobby's excitement over the news.Casting a look at Verena, lsaac's eyes danced with amusement as he typed his reply to Bobby, "She's yoursister-in-law now. You'd better get used to it."
Bobby could hardly believe what he was reading. lsaac was clearly acting smug about itDeciding to push back, Bobby responded deliberately, "Not happening.Two words summed up his rebellious mood. Only behind the safety of the screen could Bobby get away withthat attitude. Deep down, he knew his place-timid in person, but unexpectedly daring when hiding behind screen.
###Chapter 89 Let's Sleep


As evening drew its curtain, a family helper arrived to prepare dinner. After the meal, she quietly tidied the kitchen and slipped away.

In the master bedroom stood a computer desk, a perfect spot for working before drifting into dreams.

Verena held two books on neurology, their spines bent and corners worn-clear footprints of constant use by their owner.

Pointing toward the desk, she asked softly, "Isaac, may l use your computer?"

Isaac,leaning against the headboard with a book in hand, nodded with calm ease."Suit yourself."

Verena answered his nod with a smile, and then seated herself at the desk, meticulously sorting out medical cases akin to lsaac's condition.

Time ticked away unhurriedly, the room hushed except for the rustle of turning pages and the steady tapping of keys.

Isaac's book lay open on the very first page, while the sound of flipping paper came from Verena's corner.

His gaze lingered on her back, absentminded, as though his thoughts had wandered far.

The house had a proper study, yet she had chosen to remain here, in the same room with him.

He sat reading at the bedside, while she worked earnestly within his sightline.

The moment carried the air of a dream-a fleeting glimpse of what ordinary couples might call daily life,something Isaac once thought beyond his reach.

And yet, by grace or chance... the quiet murmur of paper and the rhythmic clatter of keys testified that it was no mirage.

A faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes softening as they rested warmly on Verena. Just then, Verena stretched her arms overhead, stood up, and was about to turn around.
Startled, Isaac, as though caught red-handed, dropped his gaze and buried himself in the book, pretending to read.
Fresh from her plunge into intricate medical notes, Verena failed to notice Isaac's sudden shift in demeanor.
Rubbing her neck, she murmured, "I'Il go take a shower. If you're tired, go ahead and sleep."
"Okay," Isaac replied quickly. Only after his word left his lips did he realize she had already stepped into the adjoining bathroom.
Take a shower...
Soon after, the steady sound of water reached him.
A thought flared in Isaac's mind, and with it came a rush of heat; his ears burned crimson.
He couldn't help the imagination. Until now, no one else had ever set foot inhis private bathroom.
And now... someone who stirred his heart had entered.
The rooms at Seraphina Villas were smaller than those at the Bennett Mansion. On this quiet night, the sound of running water seemed as though it poured right beside him.
He could even picture whether Verena was rinsing shampoo or washing with body wash each time the water paused.
Isaac swallowed, closed his eyes, drew in deep breaths, and then exhaled slowly befóre reopening them.
He looked down again, only to see the corner of his book crumpled, though he couldn't recall when his hand had done it.
Then,without warning, the bathroom door swung open, and steam drifted out like a light veil.
Verena emerged, her hair already dried. Silken strands cascaded down her back, and she wore a light set of pajamas.
Carrying a fresh fragrance with her, she walked to the bed. Isaac drew in another breath, realizing only now how agreeable his own body wash smelled.
"You're still awake? What's so captivating in that book?"

Her voice reeled him back from his thoughts. Isaac looked up to see Verena leaning forward to peek at his reading.

As she drew closer, he hastily smoothed out the wrinkled page with his hand.

Her slight bend brought her long hair spilling over her shoulders, brushing against his nose, her breath warm upon his arm-sending an involuntary shiver through him. Isaac had never been this near to another woman,nor had he felt a tension that strung every nerve taut.

Abruptly, with a snap, he shut the book.
"Oh, nothing special-just skimming. Let's sleep," he said quickly, placing the book on the bedside table before lying flat, steadying himself with both hands.

 ###Chapter 90 How Many Relationships Have You Been In Before
Verena arched an eyebrow in slight puzzlement, brushing the thought aside like dust on a shelf.
She slipped into bed from the far side, switched off the lamp, and asked lightly, "I've grown used to sleeping with a night light on. WouId that bother you?"
She knew Isaac never minded a light in the past, but that was before memory loss rewrote parts of him.Since time had passed, she thought it wise to confirm whether his old habits still held.

Isaac paused, caught unprepared by her question. Darkness had always been his ally; when waking from a nightmare, the blackness convinced him the terrors were nothing but shadows that would scatter with the dawn.

After a brief silence, his answer came low and steady."I don't mind."
"I guessed as much." Verena's brows lifted as she smiled and lay down beside him.

The heater hummed, filling the room with warmth. Their clothes were light, and when Verena shifted, Isaac's arm brushed against the lingering heat of her body.
The mingling of coolness and warmth made for a paradoxical harmony that unsettled him.

His breath caught; he fixed his eyes on the ceiling, lying still as if life had pressed pause.
Though his body was stiff, his thoughts tumbled restlessly.
The girl he cherished lay right beside him.

He could feel the delicate press of her fingers against his arm and inhale the faint fragrance of her hair.His throat worked, his teeth bit the inside of his cheek, and his breathing grew heavier without his notice.Seeing his blank gaze pinned to the ceiling, Verena understood his unease. With playful intent, she propped herself on her elbow, leaned closer, and asked, "Can't sleep?"
Her hand came to rest on his chest, her forehead brushing his chin, her breath fanning gently as if testing
his composure.
That sudden nearness made lsaac hyperaware-the warmth and softness pressing into him turned everybreath into a labor.
Awkward tension crept between them
When he still offered no reply, Verena reached to caress his cheek tenderly. "Why so quiet?
Her palm, soft as velvet, stroked his face as though he were a treasured companion.
Isaac lowered his eyes to study her intently
He was a storm of nerves, yet she was calm, almost serene.
Any ordinary girl, lying so close to someone she admired, would flush or falter.
But Verena remained composed.
Even sharing a bed, she carried herself with poise, still teasing him without hesitation.
To lsaac, it hinted at someone well-versed in matters of love.
A frown touched his brow as a sudden realization struck-he had never once asked about Verena's romanticpast.
At first, he found it needless. After al, their union began from mutual interests of their families
But now, curiosity gnawed at him.
Instead of replying to her teasing, lsaac murmured, "Can l ask you something?'Verena's eyes lit with interest. "Of course."
He hesitated inwardly. Would prying into her past make him appear insecure?
Would she mistake him for being improper, too narrow-minded?
And yet silence felt unbearable. She was not only the woman he liked but also the one he called wife.

He could not pretend indifference.

After wrestling with himself, he finally asked, hesitant yet firm, "Verena... how many relationships have you been in before?"

The room slipped into silence.

Isaac's fists tightened, a sheen of sweat dampened his palms. His gaze locked on her as though his very heartbeat awaited her reply.

Regret pricked him instantly-what if she disliked the question?

Catching his solemn expression, Verena chose to break the tension with a touch of humor. She teased lightly, "Three or four, maybe."

###Chapter 91 First Love

"Three or four?" Isaac repeated,a hint of disbelief making his voice climb.
His reaction gave away just how startled he felt.
Verena,quick to read between the lines, caught on to his question before he even finished asking about her dating history.
Jealousy had always been Isaac's trademark.
Choosing mischief over honesty, Verena decided to play with him, curious about what emotions she might stir up.
She watched as his brow knitted in disbelief, fighting back a smile while she kept the game going.
With a breezy nod, she replied, "That's right." She tossed in, almost carelessly, "But none of them lasted long. They were just temporary flings."
Isaac was shocked. Temporary flings! Did that mean those past relationships never mattered to her? And was he, in her eyes, just another fleeting chapter?
The thought left Isaac torn-on one hand, he was relieved there hadn't been real feelings before him; on the other, he wondered if she'd ever allow herself to care deeply for anyone at all.
And given his condition, he was unlike any of her former boyfriends.
He felt his eyes sting, turning his face away so she wouldn't see the emotion.
For a few moments, neither of them spoke. Verena looked up just in time to notice him angled away, hair falling over his eyes and hiding what he felt.
Knowing how possessive he could be, she could guess he was sulking.
Even so, she acted as if nothing was wrong, biting her lip and leaning gently into his arms. "Does it bother you that I've dated around?"

Her words came out fragile, as if she'd just been wounded.

A tight line formed across Isaac's mouth as he held back whatever he wanted to say.

Though he was the one hurting, all it took was that soft hint of pain in her voice for his heart to melt.

Something about it only drew him in closer.

Isaac wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, and his slightly trembling hands gave away the storm he tried to hide.

He rushed to reassure her before she could misunderstand. "No, that's not it. It's all about jealousy, and I'm jealous because I care about you-that's all."

For the first tie since his memory loss, Verena heard him put his feelings into words, jealousy and all.

His love ran deeper than she'd ever guessed.

Warmth flooded her chest, and her lips curled up in a tender smile."I get it," she whispered.

After a quiet pause, Isaac rested his chin on her shoulder and, unable to hold back, asked in a stubborn whisper, "So, none of those men ever truly mattered to you?"

Hearing the caution in his voice made Verena laugh. "I was only messing with you. There weren't three or four relationships at all."

The admission caught Isaac off guard. He'd braced himself for the worst, but as her words sank in, his tense expression softened, and relief washed over him.

A quiet joy spread through him, deeper than he expected-he couldn't keep from feeling pleased inside.

That was when it hit Isaac just how much he wanted Verena all to himself.

But the happiness was short-lived.

Meeting his gaze with a secretive smile, Verena continued, "Actually, it was just one." She let the words hang, the look in her eyes loaded with meaning. Isaac, caught up in the revelation, missed the nuance completely.

Stunned, he could only process the reality-one relationship, not several. That single truth struck him harder than any number ever could.

Having one person who mattered most changed everything.

His mood dropped, and his reply barely carried above a whisper. "Was that your first love?"

She let her fingers wander gently across his brow, tracing down to his temple, answering softly,"You could say that."

A flicker of memory crossed her features. Teasing, she added, "We never made it official, but the feelings were always there."

Those words-feelings always there-stuck with him.

Sadness clouded Isaac's eyes. Bitterness burned at the back of his throat, a tightness settling in his chest.

He couldn't help but wonder: if fate had brought them together sooner, would she have ever belonged to someone else?

Maybe, if they had met earlier, they would have been each other's only love.

But he knew there was no changing the past.

An ache flared in his chest, spreading like wildfire, and his limbs turned heavy.

He tried to play it off, muttering, "Alright, I get it," before falling silent and convincing himself he'd let it go.

Sharing abed with a woman, a light still burning, was a first for him-and surprisingly, it brought comfort.

He expected unease, but sleep came easily. For once in a long time, nightmares left him alone.

Verena woke with the sun, freshened up, and noticed Isaac stirring. She crossed the room to offer him a hand out of bed. Catching her by the wist, Isaac gently stopped her. "Don't trouble yourself, Verena. I'll have Jacob help me instead."
He couldn't stand letting her see any sign of weakness.
Typically,Jacob arrived a good thirty minutes before Isaac woke, always sanding by to help him out of bed and handle the morning routine.
"You might have to adjust today," Verena said with a gentle smile. "Jacob's waiting downstairs. I asked him to giveus some space this morning."
A flicker of surprise crossed Isaac's face. Before he could speak, she added in a soft, reassuring tone,"We're married now, Isaac. Let me take care of you."
Her kindness made his heart flutter.
Suddenly, the shadows of her past didn't matter so much. Whatever love she'd known before didn't change the fact that he was the one sharing every sunrise with her now.
She helped him into his wheelchair, waited while he got ready, and then guided him toward the elevator so they could head downstairs together for breakfast.
Midway through their morning, Isaac's phone started ringing-Cayden's name lit up on the screen.
Isaac didn't bother stepping away and took the call with Verena nearby. "Morning, Cayden. What's going on?"
On the other end, Cayden's enthusiasm was hard to miss. "Isaac, you won't believe what I just learned. After Slater made that post, I contacted the Lyons family. Turns out, Verena really did fix Barrie's leg! Who knew she had it in her? She really did graduate from Pine Hill University after all."
Cayden let out a happy laugh. "Looks like everyone who doubted your choice owes you an apology.Your wife is a real gem."
The pride in Cayden's voice was unmistakable.
Isaac found himself grinning at the mention of "wife," a new lightness filling his chest. His mood visibly brightened.

Across the table, Verena spread jam over her toast. Isaac couldn't stop looking at her, lost in thought until she noticed and glanced his way, confused.

He shot her a warm smile and answered Cayden, "Told you, she never needed to pretend."

Verena, seeing he was on a call, simply took a slow bite, her curiosity unspoken.

Sensing Isaac's protectiveness, Cayden admitted, "Alright, I take back what I said before. If Verena can heal Barrie's leg, she's more capable than any of us gave her credit for. Makes me hopeful about your own recovery."

Isaac's reply was soft and noncommittal."Mm."

A beat later, Cayden's excitement bubbled up again. "By the way, Stevie's back from Clokron this afternoon.He wants to take us out to dinner tonight to celebrate his return. Leonardo will join us, too."

###Chapter 92 | Want To Hide You
Stevie Wagner had been rooted in Clokron ever since high school.

Meanwhile, Cayden and Leonardo Gibson had remained in Shoildon, while lsaac had only returned from abroad half a year ago.
Once upon a time, the four of them were inseparable-bright stars sharing the same sky. Yet now, as lsaac lowered his gaze to his legs, a faint sorrow flickered in his eyes. Of them all, he alone felt out of step, a broken chord in their melody.

A gathering? Since the car accident, he had avoided every private get-together. Outwardly, he wore indifference like a cloak, meeting curious stares-subtle or direct-without flinching. But deep within, he could not fool himself; he knew he no longer stood shoulder to shoulder with the others.

Isaac opened his lips, prepared to decline his friend's invitation.

But Cayden, reading his thoughts, sighed gently and said, "We're friends-true friends, unlike anyone else.And besides, didn't you just announce your marriage online yesterday? Such joy ought to be shared.Shouldn't you celebrate with those who care for you?"
Isaac's brows eased slightly, his gaze drifting toward Verena across the table.

Sensing no objection, Cayden pressed on, "If your wife is willing, bring her along to dinner."
That single word "wife" stirred Isaac. The furrow at his brow finally loosened.

Shifting his phone aside, he turned to Verena and asked, "A friend of mine is returning to the country this afternoon. Tonight, we're holding a small dinner for him. They all know about our marriage and would like to meet you. Will you come with me? If gatherings make you uneasy, just say so. I won't mind."

He hesitated ever so slightly before adding that last line, and in his tone, a cautious undertone lingered.
He watched her quietly, as if bracing for her reply, yet secretly hoping for something more.
 Verena caught te weight of his emotions and sighed inwardly. Time and hardship truly reshape a person.The once proud, unshakable Isaac now wore his sensitivity like a fragile shield.

She refused to let this softer side of him be overshadowed by doubt, so she flashed him a bright, easy smile and agreed without hesitation, "Of course-no problem at all."
Isaac froze for a heartbeat, and then a smile tugged at his lips.
After breakfast, Isaac left for the office, while Verena retreated to the bedroom, immersing herself once again in her medical books.
By six in the evening, Isaac returned to Seraphina Villas to collect her.
He waited in the living room until the crisp click of high heels drifted down the staircase.
Glancing up, his eyes lit ever so slightly.
Verena descended gracefully, draped in a champagne-colored coat over a beige dress. Nude heels gave length to her step, and with today's careful touch of makeup, she seemed sculpted with elegance.
"Lost in my beauty?" she teased, waving her hand in front of him.
Isaac caught her hand, and before reason could intervene, the words slipped out. "I want to hide you."
Verena's lips curved into a playful smile. Leaning closer, she whispered against his ear, breaking the spell,"Careful-locking me away is a criminal offense."
Caught off guard by her comment, Isaac was momentarily stunned before he laughed and said, "I was just joking."
They exchanged a glance and both smiled.

...
As night fell, Shoildon's streets bloomed with light. In the city center, a restaurant glowed beneath warm yellow lamps, its sign reading "Bronze Rose."
Inside, rustic charm met refinement, while bursts of laughter from a private room carried into the hall. "Stevie, after all these years, still no wife?"
"I've been buried in work, you know that."
"Work? More likely you just can't decide which lady to bring back."
Their teasing drew a ripple of laughter.
The man at the head of the table-the star of tonight's gathering-was none other than Stevie Wagner.Clad in a light suit, his cheeks flushed crimson under their banter.

His eyes flicked toward the black velvet box before him. Clearing his throat twice, he steered the talk elsewhere. "By the way, what's the story with Isaac's social media post? We never even heard he was dating, and suddenly-he's married?"

###Chapter 93 What's The Deal With His Wife


"Also, what's the deal with his wife?" Stevie added.

Though he had been living abroad, distance hadn't cut him off from the whispers back home.

He had caught fragments about Verena, yet the full story still eluded him.

Cayden exchanged a meaningful glance with Leonardo, who gave a small nod, urging him to speak.

Scratching his head, Cayden said frankly, "It's a marriage arranged by their families."

In their circle, family-arranged marriages were as ordinary as breathing.

What sounded absurd to outsiders was, in truth, business as usual for people of their standing.

Stevie gave a slow nod, and then pressed, "When did they meet?"

Cayden took a sip of coffee before replying, "If memory serves, about two months ago."

"Two months ago?" Stevie's voice sharpened. He reached for the box on the table, rolling it between his fingers with unease.

That necklace-Isaac had asked him to commission it more than half a year ago, a gift intended for the girl he fancied.

Yet before fate could take its course, Isaac had suddenly returned from overseas and entered an arranged marriage instead.

So what now? Hand the necklace over or keep it hidden?

What a tangle!

Stevie's thoughts spun like a compass without a north. How had he landed in such a muddled drama?

As he wrestled with it, the door to the private room swung open. "Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, this way, please," came the clear, melodious voice of a waitress.
At the sound, all three men instinctively looked up.
Their eyes flickered past Isaac but settled-unanimously and inevitably-on Verena.
Cayden had seen her before, though then she'd worn casual clothes and almost no makeup.
But today was another story. She was carefully dressed, every detail considered.
His gaze lingered longer than he realized.

For Leonardo and Stevie, it was their very first glimpse of her, and they were caught unprepared-left momentarily stunned.

The champagne-colored wool coat skimmed gracefully over her frame, her hair spilled like silk across one shoulder, and her smile, though faint, carried warmth. In her eyes glimmered a touch of cool reserve,paradoxically making her all the more approachable, as though the frost concealed an unspoken fire.
Among the three, Cayden was the first to recover.
He stood up with a ready grin. "Come in, take a seat. We've been waiting. You owe us a drink later."
Leonardo followed quickly, returning to his senses.
Stevie sat anchored at the head of the table, with Cayden and Leonardo on his left. The right side remained vacant.

As Verena wheeled Isaac closer, Stevie, like a man concealing a guilty secret, hastily'scooped up the box on the table and slpped it into his pocket.
It was the very necklace Isaac had once commissioned from the famed designer in Clokron, Sophia Dixon.But just as the necklace was finished, lsaac had suffered his accident, and Stevie-bound by work confidentiality-had been unable to reach anyone.
When his duties were done, he'd meant to hand it to Isaac in person.
Who could have foreseen how much would unravel in the meantime?
Now, with circumstances as they were, presenting the necklace felt utterly out of placeStevie pushed the box deeper into his pocket, securing it as though to bury his own uneaseVerena guided lsaac to the chair beside Stevie, and then bent gracefully to drape a blanket over lsaac'slegs.
The simple gesture made the three men exchange glances-admiration and quiet surprise glinting in their
eyes.
Of everyone at the table, Verena was the stranger.
And yet, in front of his closest companions, lsaac clasped her hand. His voice softened, carrying both prideand warmth. "Allow me to introduce my wife, Verena."
At once, Cayden rose with an easy laugh, extending his hand. "Dr. Willis, who would've thought that the nexttime we crossed paths, you'd already be my best friend's wife? l hope you won't hold a grudge for my pasimissteps."

###Chapter 94 Was This Really How Arranged Matches Worked
With a gentle smile, Verena took Cayden's hand and held it firmly. "Dr. Moore, you only had Isaac's health in mind.Why would I take offense? There's nothing wrong with being careful."
Leonardo also stood up to greet her. "My name's Leonardo Gibson. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."He carried himself with a maturity that gave him a steady presence.
A faint smile touched Verena's lips as she inclined her head in response. "Nice to meet you, Leonardo."
Afterward,Leonardo chuckled and tapped the shoulder of the man at his side. "Here's the star of tonight's gathering-Stevie Wagner, back from his time overseas."

Caught off guard, Stevie froze for a second, and then jumped to his feet in a hurry. "Hi, Verena. I'm Stevie Wagner.Glad to meet you."

The words spilled out in a stiff rush, and his jerky movements made him look like a clumsy puppet, which drew laughter from the others at the table.

"You're still terrible at meeting new people, Stevie," Cayden teased with an easy grin.
Stevie's hand went to the back of his neck, and his reddened face gave him the awkward air of a shy student.

Reaching out without hesitation, Verena returned his handshake and smiled warmly.good to meet you as well."

Soon afterward, the servers brought in the dishes, and the four old friends slipped into lighthearted conversation.

The talk about a drinking penalty was nothing more than Cayden joking, since everyone knew lsaac's health didn't allow him to drink.

For the most part, Verena ate quietly, though she joined in whenever the topic turned toward her.  The three men filled the air with lively chatter, while Verena and Isaac focused on their dishes and, almnost in unison, served each other food.

Their hands paused when they realized what they'd done. Their gazes met for a heartbeat, and then both lowered their eyes and laughed softly.

The trio across from them couldn't miss it. They traded looks, each one buzzing with unspoken meaning.
Stevie leaned back with suspicion clear on his face. Was this really how arranged matches worked? First the blanket, and now sharing food? That level of closeness seemed far too much.

Cayden turned toward Leonardo, clearly searching for an answer.
Instead of helping, Leonardo only lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, as if to say he was just as clueless.When the meal was nearly finished, Verena rosefrom the table and excused herself to the restroom.

No sooner had she left than Stevie edged closer to Isaac and murmured, "I almost kept this to myself, but since you commissioned it, I'll hand it over."

Both Cayden and Leonardo stayed wrapped up in their own conversation, too distracted to notice the quiet exchange happening beside them.

Isaac's gaze dropped to the black velvet box that Stevie was holding out.
"What are you talking about? When did I ever commission this?" he asked with confusion.

Believing Isaac had forgotten, Stevie explained patiently, "It was a month or two before your accident. You called me and said you were chasing after a woman you truly loved, and you wanted me to find someone who could design a necklace just for her."
His expression softened as he continued, "Things didn't go as you hoped, but you already paid for it. What you choose to do with it now is up to you."

With no room for refusal, Stevie pressed the box into Isaac's hand.

Isaac froze, his gaze fixed on the box for what felt like ages, bewilderment and astonishment flickering in his eyes. A woman he had truly loved... had there ever been one? Stevie could be reckless and unpredictable at times, yet he wasn't the kind of man who would deceive himn, much less make light of something so serious.

Trying to force the memory to surface, Isaac furrowed his brow. Yet the harder he searched, the emptier his mind became. When had he ever been in love with a woman? Why couldn't he remember a single detail?

Shaking his head firmly, Isaac pushed the thought aside. "No. I never asked you to order this."

Stevie froze in disbelief, his voice pitching higher. "Isaac, don't mess with me. I've still got the proof of that transfer."

Opening his banking app, he shoved the screen toward Isaac and said with a teasing grin,"Look at this.Did you really forget? You wouldn't stop saying she was the only one for you."

The record left no room for doubt.

Meanwhile, Isaac's thoughts were completely blank.

Verena's cheerful voice chimed in as she walked back toward the table, "What are you two whispering about?"

Isaac's shoulders tensed. On instinct, he slid the small box into his pocket.

Stevie parted his lips, ready to brush it off, but Isaac interjected quickly, "Nothing important. I was just asking about his time overseas."

With an easy smile, Verena accepted the answer. "Alright then, carry on."

Stevie snapped his mouth shut and shot lsaac a side glance. Quick thinking, he thought. Isaac always managed to cover himself well. Still, the man hadn't actually asked him anything about life abroad.

By the time their gathering wrapped up, the clock had already passed ten.

It was late when they finally reached home.

Verena slipped into the bathroom for a shower, while Isaac wheeled himself quietly into the study.

Taking out the box, he lifted the lid. Resting inside was a crystal necklace, its flawless shine revealing a piece of craftsmanship far from ordinary.

Instead of admiring it, Isaac sat there frowning. If Stevie's story was real, how could he have no recollection at all? If he'd once been in love with someone, he would have told the girl honestly before agreeing to the marriage arrangement with the Willis family. Responsibility wasn't something he ever avoided. Yet his mind offered nothing, not even a trace of memory. And still, Stevie had no reason to lie. Between the bank record and the necklace, the evidence couldn't be denied.

Isaac pressed his hands over his face, and then stared blankly at the ceiling. Confusion clouded his eyes,and not even he could piece it together. He understood he should be honest with his wife about matters of the heart, yet he couldn't bring himself to let Verena see this strange part of his past.

Morning arrived, and Isaac left for work earlier than usual. Verena also rose at dawn, enjoying a rare stretch of quiet while tending to the flowers in the garden.

That calm was soon broken, as uninvited visitors showed up without so much as a warning.

The housekeeper, Rhonda Walker, hurried across the garden and called out, "Mrs. Bennett, your parents have arrived. They're waiting in the living room."

Verena's face remained calm. She had already expected this moment would come.

"Alright. Go on back to what you were doing," she replied evenly.

Rhonda gave a quick nod before returning to her chores.

Setting the pruning shears aside, Verena let out a faint sigh and headed toward the living room.

She hadn't even stepped inside when Alec's voice drifted out.

"Luka had a sudden fever the other day, so it delayed us. Now that we're finally here, be sure you speak nicely,alright?"

Laura seemed to grasp the seriousness this time. With less of her usual bite, she bobbed her head quickly."I get it, I get it. Don't worry. With the two of us together, she's coming home."

Leaning casually against the doorframe, Verena crossed her arms and studied the couple lounging on the sofa. A bitter smile tugged at her lips. Their little act could rival any Shakespearean performance, and real life seemed to be their favorite stage.
She stood tall and called out, "Why are you here?"
Her cold tone sliced through the room, and Alec and Laura instantly forced smiles as they rose to greet her."Oh, Verena, I've missed you terribly!" Laura exclaimed.
To Verena, the words dripped with hypocrisy. She couldn't help but think Laura ought to fear divine punishment for such insincerity. Then again, someone like her clearly had no conscience to trouble her.
Laura reached for her hand with false affection. "You've gotten thinner."
Verena pulled her hand away without a word and calmly wiped it clean with a tissue.
Their smiles faltered. Laura's eyes flashed with anger, though she quickly masked it.
Acting as if he hadn't noticed, Alec kept a gentle expression. "Please don't be upset with us, sweetheart.Just come back home with us. I'm begging you."
His voice cracked as though he might break down in tears, and his eyes glistened with sorrow.
Compared to Laura, Alec's performance nearly fooled Verena-it was that convincing.
Verena crushed the used tissue in her hand, and then tossed it into the trash with deliberate aim.
"Sweetheart?" Her lips twisted into a sharp smile as her gaze hardened. "What gave you the idea I was that close to you?"
###Chapter 95 Their Love Was Unreliable And Transient
Alec caught the sting of sarcasm in Verena's words, his facial muscles twitching as though struck by asudden chil. Though embarrassment gnawed at him, he stubbornly wore a mask of kindness and sincerity.
"Verena, l know why you refuse to come home. That troublesome girl, Kaia, has been spreading rumorsabout you, making others whisper behind your back. l am well aware of all the bad things she has done toyou."
At that moment, Laura didn't bother to shield her once-cherished younger daughter. She quickly nodded inagreement. "Exactly! Your sister is reckless and immature. Once we return, we'll make sure to discipline herproperly."
With a thunderous expression, Alec unleashed a torrent of harsh words at Kaia. "| never imagined that giricould wear suc a convincing mask, Before we brought you back, she always seemed obedient. But themoment you appeared, her narrow heart was laid bare, and now she has become nothing more than ajealous villain.
Seeing Verena remain silent, Alec assumed he had struck a chord, Pretending to wrestle down his anger, hesoftened his voice as though offering comfort. "Verena, don't worry. When you come home with me, !'lmake sure to give her a stern lecture right in your presence, and she will apologize."
Like actors reading from the same script, Alec and Laura steered the conversation until Kaia bore the fullblame for拓 every wrong.
Vena dar eyes stayed fixed on them, her gaze as cold and sharp as a blade, carrying disdain and achilling detachment.
In that moment, she finally understood the roots of Kaia's hostility
The love Alec and Laura dispensed was like shifting sand-unreliable and transient, here one moment andgone the next.
When Verena had first arrived in Shoildon, everyone treated her as a simple country girl, looking at her with indifference.

Alec and Laura were no exceptions.

In their minds, her worth was limited to one thing-replacing Kaia to marry Isaac, thereby completing a marriage of convenience with the Bennett family.

So when Kaia aimed her arrows at her, even though Alec and Laura knew the truth, they turned a blind eye.

Even when quarrels broke out between the sisters, their instinct was always to shield Kaia first.

But times had changed.

Now they realized that, beyond the marriage arrangement, Verena had other values greater than Kaia's.With thatrevelation, they shifted their stance with practiced ease-flattering Verena, appeasing her, and harshly chastising the very daughter they once swore to protect.

Their love was indeed no more solid than smoke in the wind.

No wonder Kaia felt fear and insecurity. She dreaded that Verena's appearance in their lives would steal what little affection remained in their parents' wavering hearts.

Thus,she tried every trick in the book to push Verena away.

Growing up under such a roof, Kaia was, in Verena's eyes, both pitiful and pathetic.

"You two truly are willing to stop at nothing to get what you want." The mocking smile on Verena's lips faded, replaced by sheer disgust in her eyes. "Words like insincere and filthy fall short of describing you.You're not bringing me back to the Willis family for my sake. You only realized the closure of the club was Isaac standing up for me. Then, when you saw Slater's social media post clearing my name,you finally understood I hold value-considerable value. That's why you're now willing to disparage Kaia just to win me back. If not for these two incidents, no matter how much Kaia wronged me, you'd still be twisting yourselves to cover for her instead of pretending to fight for me. Kaia turned out this way because of you both."

At those words, Alec and Laura were visibly flustered.
###Chapter 96 Just You And Me

Alec reacted swiftly, clutching his chest with theatrical flair. "Verena, how could you see me in such a light?I am your fath..."
Verena cut him short. "You two have been unsettling me for quite some time. I have no interest in watching your little play. Rhonda, please show them out."
Without granting them another glance, Verena turned on her heeI and made her way upstairs.
Rhonda stepped forward and spoke with a touch of awkwardness. "Mr. and Mrs. Willis, please leave."
The villa was Isaac's property, and Alec and Laura knew better than to stir up trouble or drag Verena down as though it were their own household.
They exchanged a fleeting look-frustration written plainly on their faces-yet, swallowing their pride, they had no choice but to retreat in defeat.
The uninvited visit spoiled Verena's mood for gardening, so she drifted into the study in search of a book.As she settled into the chair, her eyes caught a black velvet gift box tucked beneath the desk.
Curiosity tugged at her; she reached for it and gently lifted the lid.
Inside lay a delicate women's necklace.
A flicker of surprise crossed Verena's eyes, and then softened into a smile.    
Had Isaac prepared this for her?
Was there a hidden occasion she had overlooked?
She quickly checked her phone's calendar. Valentine's Day was far ahead, and her birthday had long since passed.
Unable to unravel the mystery, she closed the box and quietly set it back in place.
 She resolved to wait and ask him when the time came. Yet,after that day, Verena found herself watching and waiting for lsaac to offer the gift, but time slipped by,and he never did.
Her curiosity gnawed at her like a silent pest.
One evening, as she sat before the vanity, she remarked casually, "Isaac, don't you think my neck looks rather bare? My outfit doesn't seem to shine as much."
Hearing her, Isaac lifted his eyes from the documents in his hands to glance at her.
She wore a fitted top with a V-shaped neckline, her hair swept into a bun, leaving her graceful neck exposed.
Isaac shook his head, answering with calm honesty, "Not at all. It looks beautiful."
Verena paused, realizing he had missed the hint, and pressed on. "Don't you think a little addition would make it look even better?"
Isaac blinked,momentarily taken aback, before asking in earnest, "What shouldladd?"
Verena almost blurted out "a necklace" but held her tongue.
At first, she had thought he was keeping a surprise from her, but now it seemed he had completely forgotten about the necklace she had discovered.
She only shrugged with a light smile. "Never mind. It's nothing."
With that, she let her hair fall loose and rose to take a shower.
Isaac, however, sat puzzled, murmuring under his breath, "Is she upset?"
He replayed her words in his mind, pondering them until the realization struck-her gentle hints were a plea for a gift.
Reaching for his phone, Isaac dialed his assistant. "Jacob, there's an auction at the Shoildon Art Center tomorrow, isn't there?"

The following morning, just before leaving for work, Isaac told Verena, "I'll come home early tonight and take you out for dinner."
"With your friends?" Verena asked, assuming it was another of his social gatherings.
Isaac shook his head, his gaze bright with anticipation. "Just you and me."
"I see." Verena teased, tipping his chin with her finger and a playful smile, "A candlelit dinner, then?"
A soft gleam of mischief lit up her beautiful eyes.
Isaac's cheeks warmed, and moistening his lips, he gave a quiet
.--
By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, they arrived at a fine restaurant.
It was elegant, refined, with a violinist weaving tender notes into the air.
Once Verena settled into her seat, Isaac slid a black velvet box across the table.
"I saw this at the auction and thought it would suit you. I hope it pleases you."
Verena's lips curved into a smile-so hints did bear fruit after all.
But when she opened the box, her expression faltered for the briefest moment.
Inside lay not a necklace, but a silk scarf.
Isaac noticed her hesitation and asked, his voice cautious, "You don't like it,Verena?"
Verena concealed her inner bewilderment, her lips curving into warmth. "I like it very much. So long as the gift is from you,I cherish it all."
###Chapter 97 Tattoo
Verena was a bit confused. isaac did not hand her the necklace he had kept in the study. instead, he choseto buy her a scarf.
But why?
Verena trusted him enough to believe he wouldn't allow another woman into his lifeShe reasoned that perhaps the necklace had been meant as a gift for a relative.Leaving her guesses aside, Verena rose, moved before lsaac, and knelt down. "Would you mind helping mewith this?"
"Alright." lsaac took the scarf, folded it with care, and wrapped it softly around her neck, tying it into a neatbow.
Verena remained kneeling before him, and naturally, his gaze lowered.
When they entered the restaurant, Verena had removed her coat, showing a slightly loose sweater beneath.
As she bent, the collar slipped a little, uncovering the elegant lines of her collarbones.
Just as lsaac was about to shift his gaze away, something caught his eye and made him freeze.Beneath her collarbone, close to her heart, was a tattoo-a single initial, ".."
isaac's expression faltered, his brow knitting
Who did that "|" belong to?
He recalled her mention of a first love, and it felt as though someone had struck his chest with a heavy blow.it seemed she had not erased her first boyfriend from memory.Verena had once confessed they had loved each other deeply Though she had called it the past... if it were truly just history, if every feeling had faded, who would still carry a tattoo carved for an old flame?
Keeping an initial etched into one's skin surely spoke of lingering affection.
And the truth stood plain-the mark remained, unremoved, near her heart.
Did she still think of her first love?
Isaac fixed his gaze on the black letter, frozen, his breath catching in his throat.
A tide of jealousy surged within, leaving him suffocated.
If anyone had the right to ask about it now, it was him.
Yet his broken body made him feel unworthy even of jealousy.
If fate decreed he never recovered, and she had not truly fallen for him, would that not, in its twisted way, be better?
His mind drifted back, retracing every step of their journey.
And then a troubling thought struck him-her affection had come so suddenly.
Were her feelings for him real, as she claimed?
If so, why bear another man's mark still? Did her heart continue to wander back to that shadow?
"Is it not done yet?" Verena's gentle voice shattered Isaac's reverie.
He lowered his lashes, hiding the storm in his eyes."It's done."
Verena glanced at the scarf and smiled. "Thank you. It's beautiful."
Isaac forced a faint, stiff smile. "I'm glad you like it."
He chose not to ask about the tattoo.
Or perhaps, he lacked the courage to do so. Verena returned to her seat, brushed her fingers against the scarf at her neck, and thought of the necklaceshe had glimpsed in the study.
Her curiosity lingered, yet she trusted lsaac had his reasons and chose silence.They ate quietly, each prisoner to their own thoughts
At Willis Villa...
since the day Slater posted that clarification, Kaia had shut herself inside her room, refusing to step out.
der phone buzzed from time to time, pricking at her nerves.
very call that came was either meant to mock her or to sneer with false sympathy.innoyed, Kaia switched her chat app to Do Not Disturb, but she dared not do the same with her number, forear she might miss something vital.
et every ring seemed only to draw so-called friends eager to witness her fall
efore she could calm herself, the phone rang once more.
lready agitated, she tore several pages from the book in her hand, unable to hold her temper.
he picked up the phone, meaning to turn it off, but her hand paused at the sight of the caller ID.
was an international call.
drian?" Kaia frowned, whispering in disbelief. "isn't he in Clokron? Why would he call now?"en Slater's post came to mind, souring her face. Could Adrian Carter have heard and joined the chorus ofckery?
... he had been in Clokron for years. He couldn't possibly be so quick to hear gossip.
er a breath of hesitation, Kaia answered.
vely mal闬寡 鬢釡揄凑oice burst through. "Kaia, guess who?" Not knowing if he was aware of her plight, Kaia kept her composure and smiled faintly. "It's Adrian."
She seized the chance to probe. "Aren't you busy? What made you call?"
"I just got back from Clokron," Adrian replied warmly. "I's been ages since we met. Don't you miss me?Won't you join me for a meal?"
At the mention of meeting, Kaia's instinct was to refuse, fearing he might know about the post and wish to ridicule her face-to-face.

But just as she prepared to decline, a spark lit in her mind.
Of course!
Adrian had just returned from Clokron, and he too was a graduate of Pine Hill University.

Her heart leapt with sudden excitement. "Adrian, I've missed you. How time flies! It's been so long I nearly forgot-what year was it you went abroad?"
Adrian,thoughtful, gave her the year and sighed. "Hard to believe i's been seven years."
Kaia made a mental note and replied, "It really has been a while. Adrian, are you free tomorrow? Let's meet in the afternoon. It's on me."
Adrian agreed without hesitation. "Alright."
Feigning busyness, Kaia said, "Adrian, I have things to attend to. Let's talk more tomorrow."
Whenthe call ended, she opened her door and walked downstairs, intent on finding Laura to ask something.But as she reached the staircase, voices rose from the living room-Alec and Laura were quarreling bitterly.Kaia halted,listening.
Laura's voice seethed with resentment."Verena, that ungrateful girl, is too petty! Even when we begged her,she still refused to come home. How can she hold grudges against her own parents?"
Alec snorted, pointing a trembling finger at her. "This is your doing. You knew she was sensitive, yet you provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side.
###Chapter 98 As If Victory Was Already Hers


Shock rippled through Laura as her gaze landed on Kaia, who had rushed to stand between her and danger.

A look of astonishment crossed Alec's face; Kaia's sudden intervention had clearly caught him off guard.

Even so, Alec refused to show a hint of embarrassment at the situation. His hands clasped behind him; his stern demeanor remained unchanged.

After a moment, Laura shook off her shock, stepped forward, and drew Kaia close in a tight hug. She let her frustration spill out at Alec. "How long will this go on, Alec? Ever since Verena came here, this family has been falling apart. I've tried everything-I've humbled myself, lost my pride, and still, nothing changes. If that's how it is, I'm done. From now on, you deal with it."

She didn't wait for a response. Laura led Kaia away and guided her upstairs.

Inside Kaia's bedroom, Laura gently traced the outline of Kaia's puffy cheek, sorrow filling her eyes. "Why would you throw yourself in the middle of that? You know your father's temper."

Kaia knew firsthand how harsh Alec could be. Yet, unlike him, Laura's care was real-she was the one most likely to soften if Kaia reached out.

Laura would stay by her side, no matter what Alec chose to do for his own benefit.

Kaia couldn't afford to lose both, so she kept one close just in case things fell apart.

Kaia took one look at how Laura reacted and figured stepping in had been the right call.

Tears pricked Kaia's eyes, and her nose tingled as she sniffled. "If I hadn't gotten between you, you'd be the one hurting, Mom. I just couldn't let that happen."

Laura's own tears threatened to fall, but she managed a warm,gentle smile.silly girl. At least I know all the love I gave you wasn't wasted. Let's do something about that swelling."

She soon returned with ointment in hand. Dipping a swab into the cream, Laura carefully applied it to Kaia's face. The sting made Kaia flinch, but she didn't regret standing up for her mother.

Trying to ease the tension, Laura spoke softly. "Try not to blame your father. He thinks he's protecting us.The club's closure has kept him up every night."

Kaia's eyes, still red, met her mother's. She nodded quietly."|get it, Mom. I'm not mad at him. Maybe Verena didn't help us because we never really included her. Honestly, I'd feel out of place too."

That confession made Laura pause for a beat.

She hadn't forgotten the scandal stirred up by Slater's post about Kaia. But seeing her daughter's sincerity,Laura dismissed the incident as unimportant.

Her voice was calm. "We gave her a home and every chance to succeed. She's got no reason to resent us."

A faint smile touched Kaia's lips as she changed the subject. "Mom, do you remember when Verena took her college entrance exams?"

While tending to Kaia's cheek, Laura's thoughts wandered back to Verena's school days. She hesitated,recalling, "You know, I don't think she actually sat for the exams. Why are you asking?"

Kaia's eyes reflected regret as she spoke. "Everything that's happened to Willis Group is really on me. When Verena first came home, I was afraid of losing your affection, so I kept my distance. My mistakes led us here,and I want to make things right. I also need to learn about her history-maybe then I can fix what I've done.Don't worry, Mom. I'll talk to her and ask her to stop targeting us."

Laura reached over, pride shining in her expression. "You're being so thoughtful, Kaia. That makes me proud. Your father will be pleased when he hears this." After thinking for a moment, Laura recalled the timing. "It was the year Luka got seriously ill. Seven years ago."

The moment Laura mentioned the year, Kaia nearly leapt from her seat.

That put Verena in Adrian's graduating class.

In her mind, Kaia quickly connected the dots. provoked her until she left. Now look where we are! We can't hold on to anything!
Losing patience, Laura pushed his hand aside. "Alec Wilis, stop pretending you're blameless. Every timetrouble comes, you wash your hands clean. Don't pin this on me. Even if l was wrong, you agreed to it. Allyou ever do is bully your family while cowering before outsiders. Why don't you go confront lsaac if youdare? lf luck hadn't handed you a friend to invest with, you'd still be the same good-for-nothing.
Alec, proud to a fault, could never bear his weakness being spoken aloud, even in private.
Laura's words cut him to the quick.
Kaia knew her father well. With Laura's tongue so sharp, she was inviting his fury.
Resolve flickered in Kaia's eyes as she hurried down the stairs
As expected, Alec's face was twisted with rage. He raised his hand high. "Shut your mouth, you witch!'
The blow fell swiftly.
Smack! The sound cracked through the room as the heavy slap landed-not on Laura, but on Kaia, who hadrushed in, her head snapping to the side. Adrian passed the phone back and shrugged. "That's not for sure. The university is massive, and each department is full of students. There's no way to know everyone in your year."

Noticing the disappointment on Kaia's face, Adrian tried to reassure her. "Let me reach out to a buddy of mine-he knows more schoolmates than me."

Grateful for the offer, Kaia nodded. "That would help a lot. I'll send you her picture right now."

Adrian forwarded the photo, and then quickly dialed his friend.

"Wesley, I just texted you a photo. Take a look-do you recognize this girl from back then?"

On the other end, Wesley Seymour's voice sounded rough, like he'd just woken up after a wild night. "Give me a sec."

A few moments ticked by before Wesley let out a low whistle. "Whoa, where'd you get a stunner like this?"

Rolling his eyes, Adrian clarified, saying, "She's not someone I know personally. I'm asking for a friend."

Wesley's enthusiasm faded. "Ah, I get it. Sorry to disappoint, but she doesn't ring a bell."

As Adrian hung up, Kaia leaned in, anxious for the answer. "Did he recognize her?"

He shook his head. "Nope. If a girl like that had been around, especially with my friend's reputation, he would have noticed her for sure."

Hearing this, Kaia felt a surge of satisfaction she hadn't experienced in ages.

Even if Verena truly healed Barrie, a lie about her academic background would stick like a stain that couldn't be washed away.

All Kaia needed was a sliver of doubt-a few hundred people out of a thousand-casting shadows on Verena's story.

As for a grand wedding? What a joke.

Verena wanted to marry into a rich family smoothly? Things weren't going to fall into place that easily.

If Verena's secret came out on her wedding day, it would be the perfect scandal.

A sly smile curled on Kaia's lips, her confidence blooming as if victory was already hers.

###Chapter 99 Verena's Love Life


Leaning in a bit, Kaia asked, "So... that means she wasn't a Pine Hill student, right?"

Adrian paused, clearly thinking it over. "I can't say for sure. My friend's got connections everywhere, but the campus is packed with gorgeous women-he couldn't know all of them."

Then he turned the question back on her. "Why are you so interested in this girl, anyway? Is she that important?"

Kaia said quickly, "She is-honestly, it's crucial. Adrian, you're plugged in with so many people. Could you help me dig up more about her?"

He mulled it over before giving a nod. "Alright, here's what l'Il do. I'Il contact someone from school and see if they can send over our med school's complete roster from that yea. We'll check for her name."

Relief filled Kaia's voice. "That's really helpful,Adrian. Thank you!"

Meanwhile, at a Shoildon restaurant, two men sat facing each other in a private dining room, deep in business talk.

One, older with silver streaks at his temples, watched everything with alert, calculating eyes-the look of a seasoned executive.

Across from him, a younger man in a wheelchair hid every thought behind a calm, unreadable face.

Rising from his seat, the older man-Jeffry Turner-offered a hand and an overly polite smile. "Mr. Bennett,Turner Group is honored to join forces with your company. Here's to a thriving alliance."

Isaac waited, his eyes resting on the outstretched hand just long enough for Jeffry's smile to falter, before finally accepting the shake.

"To a thriving alliance," Isaac replied evenly.

Jeffry's smile quickly returned as he straightened. "Well, I'll get out of your hair now, Mr. Bennett. Wouldn't want to take up more of your valuable time."

Right on cue, his assistant hurried over to hold the door as Jeffry left.

As soon as they were gone, Jacob, who had been standing quietly behind Isaac, couldn't help but remark,"That Jeffry is slick. He's always out for his own interests. If he didn't have that tiny link to your mother,he'd never land a partnership like this."

Isaac let out a small, knowing laugh, hands folded in his lap. "After forty years in the industry,Jeffry knows the game. He won't lift a finger unless there's something in it for him first."

Jacob nodded, impressed. "You always stay three steps ahead, Mr. Bennett."

Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit. "Let's get back to the office."

Out in the hallway, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar face.

It was Gavin-Verena's friend who had just returned from overseas.

He started to call out, maneuvering his wheelchair forward, but at that moment, a young woman emerged from the elevator.

Gavin greeted her wvith a bright grin and gently guided her into another room.

Jacob inclined his head, quietly pressing, "Mr. Bennett, the elevator is ready for you."

Isaac looked at his assistant and replied, "Go on ahead, Jacob. Wait for me downstairs-l've got something to do first."

Without questioning further, Jacob nodded. "Of course,sir."

Isaac steered himself down the hall, stopping right outside the room Gavin had entered.

He waited patiently, letting the minutes pass. At last, about thirty minutes later, the door swung open.

Gavin, heading out toward the restrooms, froze when he spotted Isaac waiting. Surprise flashed across his face."Were you waiting for me?" Isaac met his gaze and gave a quiet nod.

Gavin instantly guessed this wasn't a chance encounter-and he doubted Isaac was here to invite him to a meal.

He cut straight to the point. "This is about Dr. Willis, isn't it?"

Isaac offered a slight nod, admitting, "You and Verena go way back. I'd like to understand her history."

Gavin narrowed his eyes, his mind quickly turning. He recalled his last talk with Verena at the bar and knew Isaac's memory was patchy at best. Was this sudden interest in Verena's past because something had changed between them?

A flicker of anticipation shot through Gavin. "Alright-let's find a spot to talk."

As they headed down the hall, Gavin sent a text. "Ran into someone. I'll be a while, wait for me."

Reaching the end of the corridor, he stopped and faced Isaac. "Go ahead-whatever you want to know, just ask."

Isaac hesitated, fingers tightening against his wheels. He wanted to hear about Verena's past, to piece together the woman he was falling for, but doubt crept in.

Was it right to probe into her life without telling her? The urge to know more fought against the worry that he might be crossing a line, and the uncertainty made him pause, caught between curiosity and concern.

Thoughts spun through Isaac's head, emotions tangled in a silent war. In the end, after a long pause, he couldn't bring himself to do something that might upset her. He let out a quiet breath and said, "Never mind,it's not important."

Gavin's eyebrows shot up in protest; he was not willing to let it go that easily. "Seriously, Mr. Bennett? You waited outside my room, guided me here to talk, andI even texted my friend to hold off for you. Now you say it's not important? Are you having a laugh?"

Isaac didn't elaborate, simply nodded and said, "Sorry."

Gavin huffed but decided to keep the conversation going. Leaning against the wall, he crossed his arms and put on a thoughtful face. "Alright, if you're not talking, l'll take a stab at it myself. What could possibly have you so curious about a woman's past? Let's see..."

Drawing out his words with a mischievous glint, Gavin asked, "This is about her love life, isn't it?"

Isaac met Gavin's eyes, a cold spark flickering in his own, but said nothing.

The look on Isaac's face told Gavin he'd hit the mark, and his joking manner instantly faded. He straightened, saying in a more serious tone, "Okay, you don't have to say it. You're curious about Dr. Willis'romantic past."

For a moment, Gavin hesitated. He remembered Verena's words about keeping Isaac's memory loss under wraps for the time being-it might complicate things if he found out.

Still, as far as love went, Verena's history only included Isaac.

So,how should he phrase it... Suddenly, an idea struck Gavin.

With a sly grin and a bit of theatrical flair, Gavin said, "Dr. Willis once had someone who chased after her with everything he had. This guy was completely devoted-he learned to cook just so he could make her different meals every day. And you know what? She ignored a whole parade of impressive admirers just to be with him. They were everyone's idea of the perfect couple..."

Isaac broke in, voice cool and measured. "Did his last name start with an 'I'?"

That question threw Gavin for a loop. An "I"? Why ask that?

Hold on a second!

Gavin remembered seeing a small tattoo just beneath Verena's collarbone: a single letter, I.

It had been a topic of teasing before, and Verena claimed it stood for lsaac-something Gavin and the others had never let her live down.

Realization dawned. Isaac must've seen that tattoo and thought it was connected to the man in her past.

The pieces fit, and Gavin barely managed to hide his amusement. This could get interesting.

###Chapter 100 Are You And Isaac Keeping Secrets From Me


Gavin couldn't forget the punch lsaac's brother had landed on him in that bar. Since the younger brother had stirred up trouble, wasn't it only fair that lsaac, as the elder one, carried some of the blame? And besides, Verena had been insistent-Isaac must never learn the truth about his memory loss.

Gavin convinced himself that what he was about to tell Isaac was for his own good.

Holding that thought, he swallowed his amusement and gave a small cough before saying,"Well,you can think that way. After all, one of the initials of his name is indeed T."

The remark offered little clarity, and the mischief in his tone was obvious.

Isaac felt his heart sink, and as if punishing himself, he asked, "Were they truly in love?"

Enjoying the tension, Gavin leaned into the story. "Deeply! That man adored Dr. Willis, and she nearly gave up everything for him."

At those words, Isaac lowered his eyes. Verena almost sacrificed everything for another man? The woman he knew was rational and steady. Without powerful feelings, she would never have risked so much.

A hollow laugh escaped him.

In that moment, Isaac realized he was torturing himself. Knowing she had once given her heart away,he still insisted on uncovering the details. Hadn't he vowed to only care about her present and her future? For now,it was him by her side, not that man. Whoever he was, he belonged only in her past.

Isaac gripped the wheelchair tightly, his restrained voice edged with self-mockery. "I don't want to hear any more. I don't want to know."

He turned the chair and rolled into the elevator.

Inside, with no one else around, Isaac bowed his head. His back curved slightly as a wave of helplessness washed over him. He already knew Verena had loved someone before, yet he still couldn't stop himself from digging into what should have been left alone.

In the reflection of the elevator's mirror, Isaac caught sight of himself and let out a faint, crooked smile. He had waited outside Gavin's room for so long, obsessed with digging into her past. Was it just jealousy fueling him, or did he secretly doubt that Verena could ever choose a man like him?

How could a woman who once loved so fiercely move on so quickly? And this time, the person she chose wasn't even an ordinary man. For her to accept everything about him without question, she must have had her own reasons.


...

Since the day she started living with Isaac, Verena made it her routine to check on his health every single day.

Over the last few weeks, she noticed that her treatments were beginning to stimulate his nerves. The changes weren't striking, but they were still far better than before.

Her priority now was to get control over her shaking hand so she could schedule Isaac's surgery as soon as possible.

To practice, Verena asked someone to bring her a lab mouse. She laid out the surgical tools carefully and carried the animal into the study.

With gloves pulled on and a mask covering her face, she stared at the scalpel waiting on the tray, and her mouth went dry.

She swallowed,lifted the scalpel, and waited, holding it tightly without moving for a long moment.

When no response came, Verena finally let out a breath of relief. To her gratitude, her right hand held steady.

With a spark of confidence returning, she pinned the sedated mouse in place and guided the scalpel with her right hand, the sharp edge gradually slicing through the thin layer of skin.

But the moment her cut reached the abdomen, her fingers began to shake uncontrollably. Her grip tightened around the handle as she struggled to keep it from slipping.

Sweat dampened her forehead. When the tremor finally lessened, she forced herself to continue the operation.

When the scalpel pressed into the organs, a wave of dizziness struck Verena, coldness creeping up her spine until it spread through her whole body.

A memory burst before her eyes-Shawna lying on the operating table, suffering and frail, while she stood frozen with a scalpel in her hand, unable to save her. She had been forced to watch as her grandmother slipped away.

Verena's breathing grew shallow and uneven, her chest rising and falling as she fought to take in air.She told herself this fear had to be conquered, that she needed the strength to lift the scalpel again.

Clasping her right wrist with her left hand, Verena forced her body to remain steady.

Dissecting a lab mouse was considered the easiest procedure for any medical student.

In the past, she had been able to complete one in under five minutes.

On this day, nearly forty minutes dragged by.

Weakness set into her limbs as she leaned against the wall, her complexion pale and her eyes blank as they settled on the scalpel she still held.

Her trembling hadn't stopped, and during the procedure she had nearly sliced into the mouse's organs.

It ended up being the poorest operation she had ever performed.

Not long after, Stevie arrived unexpectedly.

Rhonda, the housekeeper, noticed him and said politely, "Please wait here. I'll let him know."

Stevie motioned for her to stop. "No need. Just keep doing your work."

Then he yelled toward the upper floor, "Isaac, come down here! There's another thing I need to give you." The noise carried through the house, prompting Verena to step out of the study. She went downstairs, saw Stevie standing in the living room, and answered, "Isaac isn't here."

When Verena appeared, Stevie froze in place, unable to react at first.

It was obvious he had forgotten that Isaac already had a wife.

Awkwardness flickered across his face. Then, his eyes fell on the scalpel in Verena's hand, the fresh stain of blood making it all the more unsettling.

He edged back a step and murmured, "Verena, what are you..."

"It's nothing," Verena said quickly, slipping the scalpel behind her back.

There was no way she wanted Isaac to hear about her struggles in surgery, not when it could shake his confidence even further.

Her eyes shifted to the object Stevie was holding, and she redirected the moment. "Isaac isn't home right now.Is that meant for him? Leave it with me, and I'll make sure he gets it."

Realizing what he had in his hand, Stevie hurried to tuck it behind his back."NO,really, it's nothing important. I'll hand it to him myself; no need to bother you."

The evasion didn't escape her. Verena arched a brow and asked,"So it's something I shouldn't see? Are you and Isaac keeping secrets from me?"

Stevie stiffened, biting down on his words. Fine. That was between husband and wife-he wasn't going to get dragged into it.

He set the item down on the table and remarked, "I'll just leave it here. Goodbye, Verena."

Turning on his heel, he bolted from the house as if something was chasing him.

Verena's gaze lingered on the small box on the table, her mind unsettled. What could possibly make Stevie this tense?

"Rhonda, please carry this up to my room," she said evenly. "Of course," Rhonda replied at once.

Upstairs, Verena washed her hands thoroughly with disinfectant before sitting at her desk and lifting the lid of the small box. Inside lay a ring.

Between her fingers, she held a rose-shaped diamond ring-her favorite flower crafted in stone.

Her gaze shifted to the inside of the band, where the letter"E"had been engraved.

It was the initial of Evelyn-her other name.

A ring.

A necklace.

Stevie had just returned home.

And she recalled Stevie mentioning he hadn't spoken to Isaac for nearly eight months.

In that moment, the truth dawned on her. These pieces must have been prepared for her by Isaac before his memory loss.

At the same time, Stevie rushed away from the house and pulled out his phone to call Isaac.

"Isaac, I screwed up badly. Please don't be angry. I had no idea your wife was living with you. When I came by with the gift, I accidentally gave her the ring you bought for another woman."

Isaac's voice hardened. "What did you just say?" He pinched the bridge of his nose, not bothering to inquire about the ring. He added, frustration thick in his tone, "You never fail to mess things üp."

The call ended before Stevie could argue.

Back at his desk, Isaac clasped his hands together, elbows braced on the surface, and lowered his head. A nervous weight pressed against his chest; he was worried Verena might misunderstand when she saw the ring.

Raising his voice with authority, Isaac instructed, "Jacob, get the car ready."
