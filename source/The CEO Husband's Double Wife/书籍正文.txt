###Chapter 1: The Final Straw

The notification chimed, sharp and cold.

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at her phone, her breath hitching as she read the message.

[Please report to the hospital immediately for blood donation.]

The sender? Hubby.

Ding!

Another alert. A bank transfer—1,000,000 dollars.

Her fingers trembled as she scrolled through their message history.

[Don’t forget the hospital.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]
[Go to the hospital now.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]
[Hospital. Immediately.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]

Three years of marriage. Three years of silence, except for these demands.

Nathan Blackwood, her husband, only spoke to her when he needed her blood—sold to Vanessa Holloway, the woman he truly loved.

This month alone, Evelyn had given blood four times. Her body ached, her vision blurred. Yesterday, she had waited outside his office in the pouring rain for over an hour, desperate for even a glance. Today, feverish and weak, she had stayed home.

He hadn’t noticed.

She coughed, her throat raw. Before she could reply, another message lit up her screen—this time from an unknown number.

[You may be Mrs. Blackwood, but you’re nothing but a placeholder. Nathan hasn’t looked at you once in three years. He spent last night in my bed. If I were you, I’d disappear. You’re the real homewrecker here.]

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

A homewrecker?

She had given up everything—her family, her pride—for this marriage. And yet, she was the villain?

A photo followed. Nathan, asleep, his sculpted features serene. Beside him, Vanessa Holloway, smirking against his shoulder.

The image shattered her.

Her phone rang—Margaret Blackwood, Nathan’s mother.

"Evelyn, have you forgotten what day it is? The maids are off. Get here and cook dinner."

Evelyn hung up without a word.

For three years, she had endured it all—the disdain at work, the cruelty at home. She had cooked, cleaned, and bled for a man who treated her like a stranger.

But no more.

Her fingers moved before her mind could stop them.

[Let’s get a divorce.]

Nathan called instantly. His voice was ice.

"Evelyn, stop this nonsense. Name your price. Vanessa’s condition is critical—"

She cut him off, her voice hoarse but steady.

"Nathan Blackwood. City Hall. One hour. Or watch her die."

She ended the call.

Ding.

[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]

Evelyn laughed, tears streaming down her face.

How absurd.

How utterly, devastatingly ridiculous.
###Chapter 2: A Harsh Lesson

Evelyn Sinclair slipped her phone into her purse.

She swallowed the bitter ache in her chest and the fire coursing through her veins.

With trembling hands, she hailed a cab to City Hall.

Minutes ticked by like hours. Nathan Blackwood called twice. When she didn't answer, he gave up.

Evelyn sat on a marble bench, her complexion ghostly pale. An hour later, Nathan's polished Oxfords appeared in her line of sight.

His expression was unreadable. "What's your problem now? I know you've donated more blood this month, but you've been compensated."

"Let's get divorced." Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet his icy stare. Her voice came out hollow, devoid of emotion.

They'd never understood each other anyway.

She studied his sharp jawline and aristocratic features - the same ones that had made her foolish heart race three years ago. Not once had those lips curved into a smile for her.

Before, she'd tiptoed around his moods. Now, his perpetual scowl left her numb.

Nathan's frown deepened. He'd indulge her whims, but only with justification.

Did she really believe she was the only compatible donor?

"Evelyn, don't make decisions you'll regret."

"My only regret was marrying you." Her laugh was brittle as glass. The clarity of this moment was almost painful. "I'm done being your doormat."

The courthouse was nearly empty at this hour. Their three-year marriage ended in under ten minutes.

When the divorce papers touched her palm, Evelyn's fingers twitched.

Nathan didn't beg her to stay. Didn't even glance her way. "Let's go to the hospital." His voice was clinical. Still thinking of his final withdrawal from her veins.

Evelyn tilted her head back and laughed until it hurt. "Nathan Blackwood, if Vanessa Holloway bleeds out at my feet tomorrow, I wouldn't spare a single drop."

His eyes darkened dangerously. "How dare you wish death on someone who's suffering? Our marriage contract specified-"

"Right." The word sliced through his sentence. "Our beautiful arrangement. My rare Rh-null blood for the privilege of being Mrs. Blackwood." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "How could I forget?"

Nathan's expression remained impassive, but something flickered in his gaze.

Evelyn's laughter turned jagged. "I finally understand - to you, I'm just a walking blood bag." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Well here's your last withdrawal. After this, we're square."

She turned on her heel before he could respond. Nathan's brows knitted together.

An unfamiliar irritation prickled under his skin. This wasn't the Evelyn he knew - the clingy girl who'd pursued him relentlessly, then transformed into the perfect docile wife.

Lately, Vanessa's transfusions had become more frequent. He'd felt guilty, but Evelyn never complained. He'd assumed she was content with the jewelry and designer handbags he lavished on her.

This sudden defiance was... unsettling.

But it didn't matter.

Nathan exhaled through his nose. She'd come crawling back when reality set in.

Before he could speak, Evelyn flagged another taxi. This one took her straight to Metropolitan General.

She marched into Vanessa Holloway's private suite without knocking.

A team of specialists hovered around the hospital bed. Vanessa's face lit up when she saw Evelyn.

"You came! I was worried you'd be upset with me for needing so much blood. I know how hard this must be on your body."

Evelyn strode forward, her eyes glacial.

"That text message. It was you, wasn't it?"

Vanessa's smile faltered. Before she could answer, Evelyn's palm connected with her cheek in a sharp crack.

The slap echoed through the sterile room. Vanessa's shocked gasp was almost comical.
###Chapter 3: Retaliation

Nathan's eyes darkened, his expression stormy as he barked, "Evelyn! What the hell are you doing?"

His voice was ice-cold.

He arrived fast. Was he really that afraid I'd hurt Vanessa?

Evelyn scoffed inwardly.

Vanessa pouted, her face twisting into panic. Tears welled in her eyes as she cradled her cheek, looking past Evelyn. "I didn't do anything, Evelyn! You've got it all wrong!"

Is she insane? Hitting me right in front of Nathan?

Evelyn smirked.

"Drop the act. I know it was you."

With a chilling glare, she strode forward, pulling a printed photo of Nathan from her bag and flinging it onto the bed between them.

Nathan's gaze flickered to the image—confusion, then shock.

Vanessa's face drained of color.

He'd been exhausted yesterday after a long day. When he visited Vanessa at the hospital, he'd dozed off briefly. Clearly, this photo had been taken then.

The only other person in that room? Vanessa Holloway.

Nathan didn't need it spelled out. Vanessa had tried to twist the knife in Evelyn's heart—but she'd miscalculated.

How could she keep playing the meek, pitiful victim now?

Before, Evelyn might have hesitated with Nathan watching. Not anymore.

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "I told you I came to settle debts. This is what you owe me, Vanessa. You're the homewrecker here."

She tilted her head. "Happy now? Congratulations on replacing me as Mrs. Blackwood."

Nathan could easily guess how Evelyn had gotten the photo. The realization left him oddly breathless.

His expression hardened as he studied Vanessa's sickly pallor. She trembled under his scrutiny. "Nathan, Evelyn must have misunderstood! I didn't take that photo!"

Her voice cracked. "She probably staged this to frame me!"

Nathan's brow furrowed as Vanessa clutched his sleeve, tears spilling. "I'll apologize to Evelyn. If my needing her blood causes problems between you two, I won't ask again. I swear on Theodore's name—I had nothing to do with that photo!"

At the mention of Theodore, Nathan's jaw tightened. His best friend's dying wish flashed through his mind. Some of the storm in his eyes faded.

"Evelyn shouldn't have hit you." His voice was clipped. "Do you need a doctor?"

Vanessa shook her head, still cradling her stinging cheek. "It's fine."

Nathan nodded, then turned to Evelyn. She stood there, arms crossed, lips twisted in mocking amusement. The sight of her indifference sent an unfamiliar pang through him.

"You asked for a divorce because of this?" He exhaled sharply. "Never mind. Get the blood drawn first."

He wanted to explain, but not here—not with witnesses.

A meaningless photo paled in comparison to Vanessa's health. He'd clarify things with Evelyn later.

Relief flooded Vanessa. He still chose me. Evelyn lost again.

Evelyn had expected this. Vanessa was a master manipulator, and frankly, Evelyn was done playing her games.

She turned to the hovering doctor. "Are you certain she needs a transfusion?"

The doctor stiffened. Under Nathan's piercing stare, he nodded hastily. "Yes. Ms. Holloway's fall caused significant blood loss. It's urgent."

"Then what are you waiting for?" Nathan snapped.

"Right away, sir." The doctor scurried off.

Vanessa shot Evelyn a smug smirk—visible only to her.

"Wait."

Evelyn didn't follow the doctor. Instead, she stepped forward and yanked Vanessa's blanket away in one swift motion.
###Chapter 4: A New Beginning

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't care less about Vanessa Holloway's embarrassment.

Her sharp eyes landed on Vanessa's bandaged left leg. Without hesitation, she tore off the gauze despite Vanessa's frantic protests.

The temperature in the hospital room plummeted instantly.

Evelyn scoffed at the barely visible scratch beneath the bandages.

"Such a life-threatening injury," she mocked. "I don't even see a single drop of blood. If I'd arrived any later, it might have miraculously healed on its own."

"Nathan, please—" Vanessa's voice trembled as she met Nathan Blackwood's stormy gaze. "I just... I need the transfusion because I feel so weak..."

"You get 'injured' four times a month," Evelyn snapped, her voice like ice. "You're not fooling anyone. But congratulations—this ends today. Find some other naive woman to be your personal blood bank."

With that final blow, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode out, slamming the door behind her.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn's strength evaporated. She collapsed onto a hallway bench, feeling like the weight of the world had crushed her.

Tears streamed down her face as she fumbled for her phone. Her fingers shook as she dialed a familiar number.

"Alexander..." Her voice cracked with exhaustion.

On the other end, her brother sighed. "Where are you?" His voice was warm with unspoken concern. "I'm coming to get you."

Minutes later, a striking man in a tailored black suit led a team of security through the hospital corridors. They carried an unconscious Evelyn out discreetly.

Meanwhile, Nathan Blackwood stormed through the hospital, dragging a terrified doctor by the collar.

"A serious injury requiring transfusion?" Nathan's voice was deadly calm. "For a scratch? Is this the medical standard your hospital prides itself on?"

The doctor stammered, "M-Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Holloway insisted—she said you approved every transfusion! We were just following orders!"

Nathan's grip tightened. Had he really been so blind?

The memory of Evelyn's pale face after each donation flashed through his mind. Guilt twisted in his chest, followed by something darker—regret.

He pulled out his phone, but Evelyn's number went straight to voicemail.

"Find her," he barked at his trembling assistant. "Now."

But the surveillance footage had been erased. Evelyn Sinclair had vanished without a trace.

Nathan's chest constricted. He told himself it was just irritation—not panic.

She had nothing. No money. No connections. Where could she possibly go?

Gold-leaf trim. Italian silk drapes. The familiar opulence of Sterling Manor surrounded Evelyn when she awoke.

Tears spilled down her cheeks at the sight of her childhood bedroom.

A deep voice cut through her thoughts. "Stop crying over that worthless man. The Sterling family doesn't raise weaklings."

Evelyn looked up through blurred vision.

William Sterling—her father, the titan who could make Wall Street tremble with a single word—stood before her, his expression unreadable.

"Daddy..." The word tore from her throat like a sob.

William's jaw tightened. He reached out, brushing away her tears with surprising gentleness.

"Listen to me, princess. That Blackwood fool will regret this day for the rest of his miserable life."

Evelyn's breath hitched. For the first time in years, she felt something flicker in her chest—not pain, not grief, but the first embers of something dangerous.

Something like vengeance.
###Chapter 5: Humiliation

The moment William Sterling entered the room, Evelyn Sinclair threw herself into his arms, her body wracked with sobs.

William's heart ached as he held his daughter. She had been raised in luxury, never knowing hardship—yet she had debased herself for Nathan Blackwood. And what had that bastard given her in return? Nothing but pain.

If not for their prior arrangement, William would have crushed the Blackwood empire and made Nathan pay for hurting his precious girl.

"Evelyn, remember our deal?" William murmured, stroking her hair as she cried. "If that man didn't love you within three years, you'd return to take your place at Sterling Enterprises. It's time to honor that promise now."

Between shuddering breaths, Evelyn forced out her reply. "I... I won't... be so foolish... again."

She had abandoned everything for what she'd believed was love—her family, her status, her pride—only to crash and burn like a doomed star.

Now, piece by painful piece, she was tearing Nathan from her heart. The scars would remain, but the wound would finally close.

"Good." William's eyes shone with pride. "Your brother Alexander will guide you at the company. Once you're settled, we'll host a gala to reintroduce you to society as a Sterling heiress."

Before the official announcement, Evelyn's closest friend Isabella Montgomery came rushing over. The moment she saw Evelyn, Isabella engulfed her in a fierce embrace. "Darling! I've missed you terribly! Congratulations on your divorce!"

Isabella had been the loudest voice against Evelyn's marriage from the start. Seeing her best friend after years of estrangement brought fresh tears to Evelyn's eyes. They talked for hours, catching up on everything.

Eventually, Isabella demanded to see the divorce papers. With reluctance, Evelyn produced them. "Nathan Blackwood—that blind, arrogant fool!" Isabella exclaimed. "He'll regret this until his dying day!"

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Even if he does, it no longer concerns me. He's nothing to me now."

"Exactly! With your beauty and pedigree, suitors will line up from Manhattan to Montauk! That bastard wouldn't even make the waiting list!" Isabella scoffed.

Remembering important documents left at Nathan's penthouse, Evelyn resolved to retrieve them. Isabella insisted on accompanying her—a decision Evelyn soon regretted.

Nathan's mother Margaret stood in the foyer when they arrived. The woman had always treated the penthouse as her own domain. Her lips curled in distaste at the sight of Evelyn and her companion.

"Evelyn, how many times must I tell you? This home contains sensitive documents. You can't just bring any random gold-digger here." Margaret's voice dripped with condescension.

Isabella's jaw dropped. "Who are you calling a gold-digger, you old hag? Shouldn't you be in a retirement home instead of insulting guests?"

As a socialite accustomed to admiration, Isabella wasn't about to tolerate such rudeness. The interaction revealed volumes about Evelyn's former life, fueling Isabella's outrage.

Margaret gave a derisive sniff, eyeing Isabella's designer outfit. "Fake labels won't disguise your common roots. I've seen countless social climbers like you, dreaming above your station."

"Margaret, this is my friend," Evelyn interjected coldly. "Show some respect."

The demand stunned Margaret. Normally meek Evelyn daring to challenge her? In front of an outsider? Unthinkable!

"Respect?" Margaret spat. "For gutter trash like you? Consider yourself lucky my family tolerated you these three years. You and your little friend reek of poverty—get out before you dirty my floors further!"

The venom in Margaret's voice hung thick in the air as Evelyn and Isabella stood frozen in the doorway.
###Chapter 6: Stolen

Isabella threw her head back with a bitter laugh, her fingers curling into fists. Every fiber of her being screamed to lash out at Margaret.

"Evelyn, how could you endure these people for three whole years?" she hissed through clenched teeth. "We reek of poverty to them? I won't stand for this humiliation like you did!"

Before anyone could react, Isabella shoved Margaret hard. The older woman staggered back, barely catching herself on the ornate hallway table.

"Listen carefully," Isabella spat, her emerald eyes blazing. "Without Evelyn, your pathetic Blackwood name would mean nothing. You're nothing but tasteless new money. Try laying a finger on us, and I'll paint your precious marble floors with your blood!"

Margaret trembled with rage, her bony finger jabbing toward Evelyn. "You—you ungrateful wretch! I'll have you thrown out of Highland Estates!"

For the first time in three years, Evelyn didn't bow her head in submission. Her icy gaze met Margaret's without flinching. "Save your breath. I'm leaving on my own terms."

She turned on her heel, ignoring Margaret's shocked gasp, and ascended the grand staircase. Each step away from the toxic household felt like shedding chains.

How could she have ever believed love was worth this degradation? Margaret had trampled her dignity repeatedly, always favoring society girls over her. No more.

Evelyn took only her essential documents from the bedroom. Below, Isabella and Margaret were still exchanging venomous glares. "Ready?" Isabella asked, her smirk victorious.

"Let's go." Evelyn's voice held a newfound steel.

"Evelyn!" Margaret screeched. "I'll tell Nathan everything! Don't think you can come crawling back—"

Evelyn paused at the threshold, tossing one last scathing look over her shoulder. "Forgot to mention—I divorced Nathan Blackwood weeks ago. Even if you beg on your knees, I'll never set foot in this gilded cage again."

The slam of the front door echoed through the mansion. Margaret stood frozen, then fumbled for her phone. "Nathan! Did you and Evelyn divorce?"

Nathan's voice turned sharp. "How do you know that? Have you seen her?"

"So it's true!" Margaret crowed. "Good riddance! That gold-digging—"

"Where is she?" Nathan interrupted, his usual composure cracking.

"Gone from Highland Estates, obviously. I need to check if she stole anything—"

"She didn't take a cent?" Nathan sounded strangely disappointed.

"At least the wretch knew her place," Margaret sniffed.

Nathan ended the call abruptly, his knuckles white around his phone. Why did his mother's vitriol suddenly sicken him? Had Evelyn left because of this?

He drove to Highland Estates—a place he rarely visited. Evelyn's room stood untouched, even the platinum credit card he'd given her still in its drawer. Only her documents were missing.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest. Three years, and he'd never once bought her jewelry.

Margaret burst in, face purple with rage. "The Dubois sapphire necklace is gone from the safe! Ten million dollars! I'm calling the police!"

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Don't. She wouldn't." Evelyn had never even asked for the safe's combination. Besides, ten million was pocket change—why would she bother?

The realization struck him like a physical blow: in three years of marriage, what had he ever given her?

Smoke curled from his cigarette as he sat in his Lamborghini, but it couldn't soothe his restlessness. Meanwhile, Margaret plotted her revenge. The police wouldn't be necessary—she had far more elegant ways to ruin Evelyn Sinclair.
###Chapter 7: Viral Inferno

The moment Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery stepped out of Highland Estates, Isabella had been fuming.

"That wretched old bat! If she weren't so ancient, I'd have slapped the smugness right off her face!"

Evelyn was used to her best friend's fiery temper and merely chuckled. "Let it go. She's not worth your energy. We won't be dealing with them anymore."

Their laughter filled the car as they drove back to Sterling Manor. But when they arrived, they were met with an unexpected sight—Alexander Sterling, who was rarely home due to his demanding schedule, sat on the sofa, engrossed in a financial newspaper.

His sharp features were set in that familiar, unreadable expression—cold, aristocratic, and utterly detached.

Evelyn's heart swelled. Three years apart, yet he still felt like home.

She rushed over and threw her arms around him from behind, pressing her cheek against his shoulder. "Big Brother! You're finally back! Where did you disappear to after dropping me off?"

Alexander exhaled, the ice in his demeanor thawing instantly as he indulged her. "An urgent meeting. I came straight back after." He reached for a sleek black box beside him. "For you."

It was his tradition—no matter where his business took him, he always returned with a gift. This time, it was a custom-made, limited-edition handbag, one not yet available in the country, worth a staggering eight figures.

And it was hers alone.

He had also prepared a bespoke Chanel perfume for Isabella, knowing she'd be there. Isabella accepted it with flushed cheeks, murmuring a soft, "Thank you."

But Alexander's attention never strayed from Evelyn. His gaze darkened with quiet fury—she had suffered enough. He would give her the world if he could.

Evelyn, however, caught the way Isabella's fingers lingered on the perfume bottle. A knowing smirk tugged at her lips.

"Donovan's still overseas, locked in some top-secret lab," Alexander said, folding the newspaper. "And Lucas is at the Venice Film Festival. He’ll be back in a few days." He arched a brow. "Until then, you're shadowing me at the office."

Evelyn groaned but nodded. She knew better than to argue.

Late that night.

"Holy hell!" Isabella's frantic voice crackled through the phone, jolting Evelyn awake.

Evelyn rubbed her eyes. "What's wrong?"

"Get online. Now. Nathan's family just dragged you through the mud!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She grabbed her phone and pulled up the trending hashtag: #BlackwoodExWife.

The official Blackwood Corporation account had released a statement—accusing her of stealing valuable jewelry after the divorce. They demanded its return by morning... or they'd involve the police.

Isabella was seething. "Valuable? They're making a federal case over some ten-million-dollar trinkets? As if you'd ever stoop to stealing from those snakes!"

The internet had already erupted. Comments flooded in, painting Evelyn as a gold-digging thief. Her social media was raided—every innocent post twisted into something sinister.

"Peaceful times? More like scheming times!"

"Karma’s a bitch. No wonder they kicked her out!"

"Call the cops! Thieves belong in jail!"

Evelyn recognized the jewelry in question—Nathan had kept it locked away, the safe's code a mystery she'd never cared to uncover.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "So this is how Nathan plays after a divorce? Smearing my name?" Her voice turned lethal. "He thinks I'll just take this lying down?"

She dialed Alexander. "G, Horizon Media—it's still under my name, right? Who's running it now?"

Alexander's voice was tight. "Dominic Young. I'll have him bury this."

"No." Evelyn's tone was steel. "I'll handle it myself."

By dawn, the scandal had spread like wildfire. Evelyn Sinclair was the internet's favorite villain.

At 8:00 AM sharp, she logged into her account and posted a single photo—with a statement that would change everything.

Then she stared out the window, the morning sun mocking her naivety.

"I really was blind... to ever love Nathan Blackwood."
###Chapter 8: The Reckoning

The photograph Evelyn Sinclair had posted showed Nathan Blackwood entangled with Vanessa Holloway. Their compromising position left no room for interpretation.

What was meant to be a weapon to destroy Evelyn had instead become her shield.

Her statement was crisp and devastating:

[Dear Mr. Blackwood,

I was deeply disturbed to learn of Daydream’s disappearance. Concerned for its recovery, I engaged a private investigator immediately.

The investigator traced the necklace across the Pacifica Ocean to Germany, where it was discovered in the possession of Ms. Sophia Blackwood. It appears Ms. Blackwood has developed quite the gambling habit.

I suggest you verify these findings before making further accusations.

Sincerely,
Evelyn Sinclair.]

Attached was the investigator’s detailed report—along with a damning photo of Daydream resting on a casino table beside Sophia Blackwood.

The scandal erupted like wildfire.

Evelyn, the wronged ex-wife, had not only defended herself with precision but had done so with undeniable proof. The public’s sympathy shifted instantly.

Nathan Blackwood, meanwhile, had been drinking with associates that night, oblivious to the storm brewing. By morning, Blackwood Industries’ stocks were plummeting.

His office was thick with tension.

Harrison, his assistant, stood frozen, barely daring to breathe.

"Who authorized the company account to issue that statement?" Nathan’s voice was ice.

"Madam Margaret ordered it last night," Harrison stammered. "She claimed you were informed."

Nathan swept his desk clean with a violent motion. "Since when does this company take orders from her?" His glare was lethal. "Fire the entire PR team."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Y-Yes, sir."

"Get that post removed. Now."

Harrison hesitated. "President Dominic of Horizon Media has locked the story for twenty-four hours. No one can touch it."

Horizon Media ruled the entertainment world. Defying them was impossible.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "So Evelyn’s pulling strings now, is she?" His fingers curled into fists. "‘Dear Mr. Blackwood’—as if I orchestrated this?"

His phone buzzed. Margaret’s name flashed on the screen. He rejected the call without hesitation.

Then his father’s number appeared.

Nathan exhaled sharply before answering.

"Make Evelyn delete that post immediately!" Charles Blackwood’s voice was a controlled storm. "This humiliation ends now."

Margaret snatched the phone. "Bring that ungrateful wretch back here! She’ll pay for this!"

Nathan’s tone turned glacial. "Did she lie? Sophia stole the necklace. Why frame Evelyn?"

He despised Evelyn’s detached tone in the statement—as if their past meant nothing.

But his fury burned hotter at his mother’s shameless scapegoating.

Margaret scoffed. "How was I supposed to know Sophia took it? It was in your safe! Who else would’ve—"

"Apologize to Evelyn," Nathan cut in. "Now."

Margaret exploded. "Apologize? To that gold-digging nobody? She’s the one who should be groveling!"

Nathan’s patience snapped. "We’re divorced, Mother. This ends here."

The line went dead.

But the war had only just begun.
###Chapter 9: The Grand Affair

Nathan Blackwood slammed the phone down with enough force to make his assistant Harrison flinch. His jaw was clenched so tight it ached.

He'd tried calling Evelyn Sinclair seventeen times. Seventeen. Each call went straight to voicemail before he realized she'd blocked his number.

The office walls seemed to close in around him.

"Find her," Nathan growled, his voice like gravel. "I don't care what resources you need. Fifteen minutes."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood, we've already checked everywhere in San Francisco. There's no record of Ms. Sinclair leaving the city, but..."

Nathan's knuckles turned white around his Montblanc pen.

Thirty minutes later, Blackwood Industries retracted their statement about Evelyn and issued a public apology for the "misunderstanding." Notably absent was any mention of their marriage status.

It did little to quell the storm.

Nathan found himself scrolling through Evelyn's Instagram late into the night. Post after post documented their life together - each one a knife twist in his gut.

[Surprised hubby with his favorite tiramisu! ? #HappyWifeHappyLife]

[Three years today! Still makes my heart race when he walks in the room ?]

[Left work early to make Nathan's favorite lasagna. Burned it. Ordering takeout instead ?]

The posts stopped abruptly three weeks ago. The final entry was that sterile, lawyer-approved statement announcing their separation. No emojis. No warmth. Just cold, hard facts.

When he refreshed the page, every trace of their life together had vanished. Deleted. Erased. As if those three years meant nothing.

His chest constricted painfully.

"Like hell she gets to pretend this never happened," Nathan muttered to the empty office.

One month later, The Grandeur Hotel

The annual San Francisco Elite Gala was invitation-only, with security checkpoints spanning three city blocks. Paparazzi lenses couldn't penetrate the fortress of bodyguards surrounding the venue.

Nathan arrived in a custom Aston Martin, Vanessa Holloway clinging to his arm like ivy. She'd seized the opportunity the moment news of his divorce broke, though he'd pointedly avoided her "concerned" visits. Tonight, she'd leveraged her uncle's connections to secure an invitation.

"Mr. Blackwood! What an honor." The event coordinator rushed forward, only to freeze when commotion erupted at the entrance.

"Alexander Sterling just arrived!"

All heads turned as a matte black Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up. The Wall Street titan emerged with the effortless grace of old money, his presence commanding immediate attention.

But Sterling didn't proceed inside. Instead, he circled the vehicle and opened the opposite door with a gentleman's flourish.

The crowd held its breath.

Then she appeared.

Evelyn Sinclair descended in a couture gown that seemed spun from moonlight, diamonds catching every flicker of the chandeliers. The dress hugged every curve before cascading into a liquid silver train. Her hair, swept into an elegant chignon, revealed the Sterling emerald earrings - a family heirloom worth more than most attendees' annual salaries.

Nathan's breath hitched.

She looked every inch the Sterling heiress she was, her hand resting lightly on her brother's arm as they glided past the stunned onlookers. That familiar citrus-and-vanilla perfume teased Nathan's senses as she passed.

Close enough to touch.

Miles away from reach.
###Chapter 10 The Forgotten Bride

The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers, every inch dripping with opulence. New York's elite mingled beneath the golden light, champagne flutes clinking in celebration.

Evelyn Sinclair had steeled herself for this moment. Seeing Nathan Blackwood again didn't so much as make her pulse stutter. That chapter of her life was firmly closed.

Though society knew Nathan had an ex-wife, he'd never paraded Evelyn at events like this trophy wife. Their divorce had been tabloid fodder, but she remained just a name to most.

Her lips curved when she spotted Vanessa Holloway clinging to Nathan's arm. "Already took my place?" she murmured to herself.

Alexander Sterling caught her subtle shift and gave her forearm a reassuring squeeze. "I've got you."

Evelyn's smile deepened. "It's not me who should be worried."

She straightened her spine. "I've got nothing left to lose. That makes me dangerous."

Alexander approached Nathan with the effortless grace of equals. Both men commanded rooms without trying.

"Mr. Blackwood. Your reputation precedes you."

"Mr. Sterling. Likewise."

Their handshake lasted precisely three seconds. Nathan's gaze burned into the woman beside Alexander.

Evelyn stood radiant in her custom emerald gown, the color making her porcelain skin glow. The transformation from the woman Nathan remembered was staggering. He couldn't look away.

This version of Evelyn was intoxicating - confident, untouchable. Something primal stirred in Nathan's chest.

Had she run straight to Alexander Sterling after leaving him? The thought made his jaw clench.

Vanessa's shrill voice cut through his thoughts. "Evelyn! What are you doing here?" Her tone implied Evelyn didn't belong. "These events have standards."

Nathan frowned, but Alexander spoke first, his voice dripping with disdain. "And you are...?"

Vanessa flushed. "You should know Evelyn just divorced—"

"Is there a ban on divorcees?" Alexander arched a brow. "Mr. Blackwood seems welcome enough."

Vanessa tucked hair behind her ear, shooting Nathan a pleading look. He remained silent, watching Evelyn with unreadable intensity.

Evelyn gave a soft, mocking laugh. "Since when do I answer to you, Vanessa? Last I checked, you weren't the morality police."

The tension crackled. Everyone knew about Nathan and Vanessa's affair, though the Blackwoods had tried to bury it.

Alexander's gaze swept over Vanessa like she was something unpleasant on his shoe. "The event organizers should be more selective with their guest list. Mr. Blackwood, your taste in companions has... deteriorated."

With that, he guided Evelyn away, leaving Vanessa seething.

Nathan watched them go, his expression stormy. That woman - his wife - was thriving without him? Flirting with another man in front of everyone?

Business associates approached, giving Nathan an excuse to ditch Vanessa. He needed space to think.

Near the floor-to-ceiling windows, Evelyn stood alone by the illuminated pool, moonlight dancing across the water's surface. The red wine in her glass matched her smirk.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. How dare that discarded wife show her face here?
###Chapter 11 The Game of Deception

Vanessa Holloway's expression darkened as she approached Evelyn Sinclair with deliberate steps.

Evelyn didn't need to turn around to know who was coming. Only one person would seek her out with such hostility.

With a casual glance, she took in Vanessa's carefully crafted pitiful expression.

The mask of innocence had already fallen away, revealing the cold smirk beneath.

"Did you crash this party just to get close to Nathan?" Vanessa's voice dripped with venom. "You're divorced. Stop clinging to him like some pathetic stray. If I were you, I'd disappear."

Evelyn met her gaze with icy amusement.

"Vanessa Holloway, the whole world knows you're the homewrecker in our marriage. Enjoying your fifteen minutes of fame?"

After the scandal broke, internet sleuths had exposed Vanessa's frequent appearances with Nathan Blackwood.

Though Nathan's team had scrubbed the evidence, the damage was done. Vanessa had become social media's favorite villain, losing sleep over the backlash.

"Titles mean nothing compared to real feelings," Vanessa sneered. "Nathan and I have something you'll never understand." Her jealous eyes raked over Evelyn's ensemble. "Did you sell another pint of blood to afford that dress? Or is all this rented?" She inched closer to the pool's edge, fingers twitching.

Evelyn recognized the dangerous glint in her eyes. History was about to repeat itself.

Three years ago at their wedding reception, Vanessa had pulled this exact stunt.

"You'll never be happy," Vanessa had whispered before throwing herself into the fountain. Nathan had dived in after her without hesitation, proving where his loyalties lay.

Now, the familiar splash echoed through the garden. A dark figure rushed past - Nathan, of course - plunging in to rescue his damsel in distress.

"Don't blame Evelyn!" Vanessa coughed dramatically as Nathan lifted her from the water. "I came to apologize, but she's still bitter. I'm sure she didn't mean to push me!"

The gathered crowd murmured disapprovingly, their judgmental stares burning into Evelyn.

Alexander Sterling started forward, but Evelyn caught his arm. After a whispered exchange, he reluctantly withdrew.

Nathan wrapped his jacket around Vanessa's trembling shoulders before turning his furious gaze on Evelyn.

Their eyes locked in silent battle, Evelyn's lips curling in contempt.

"Really? The same tired act?" She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "I suppose I should play along, but honestly? It's beneath me."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Vanessa lunged forward, grasping her wrist.

"I know you hate me," Vanessa sobbed loudly for their audience. "But Nathan paid you for every blood donation. What more do you want? Why can't you let him go?"

The performance was flawless. The crowd leaned in, hungry for drama. Evelyn felt dozens of eyes weighing her response.

She could almost hear the social media posts being drafted in real time.
###Chapter 12 Reckoning

The guests exchanged bewildered glances at the unfolding spectacle.

Everyone was aware of the Blackwood scandal, yet none dared provoke the powerful family further. They merely observed the drama with bated breath.

Could Evelyn Sinclair truly be as innocent as she appeared?

Nathan Blackwood's brow furrowed at Vanessa Holloway's audacious behavior. He moved to intervene when Evelyn turned with glacial composure.

Before anyone could react, Evelyn seized Vanessa's wrist and marched toward the infinity pool.

Vanessa struggled like a helpless kitten, her designer heels scraping against marble as Evelyn dragged her effortlessly.

With calculated precision, Evelyn gripped Vanessa's chin and delivered a stinging slap that echoed through the garden. The sharp crack silenced the murmuring crowd.

Releasing her hold, Evelyn watched dispassionately as Vanessa tumbled backward into the pool with a spectacular splash.

Vanessa's shriek cut off abruptly as chlorinated water filled her mouth. Her flailing limbs created frantic ripples across the pool's surface.

Evelyn wiped her hands on a cocktail napkin, her voice cutting through the stunned silence. "Since you're so determined to paint me as the villain, I might as well play the part properly. Consider this my confession."

The crowd's murmurs grew as Vanessa floundered. This was no graceful dive like her previous performance - this was pure, undignified panic.

Nathan's gaze sharpened as he reassessed the woman before him. The Evelyn he knew would never...

Vanessa, realizing no gallant rescue was forthcoming, began hauling herself toward the edge. Just as her manicured fingers grasped the coping, a crimson waterfall cascaded over her freshly styled hair.

The heady aroma of 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild permeated the air as the vintage wine streamed down Vanessa's face. Evelyn stood above her, tilting the crystal decanter with cold amusement.

"A little parting gift, Ms. Holloway." Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "But don't rush off just yet. The main event hasn't even begun."

As Evelyn strode away, the crowd's disdainful whispers followed Vanessa like a toxic cloud. The contrast between the two women couldn't have been starker - one composed and regal, the other a sputtering mess of ruined couture and running mascara.

Vanessa's entire body trembled with humiliation and rage. From the moment Evelyn had reappeared, she'd stolen every ounce of attention that rightfully belonged to Vanessa.

If not for Evelyn's sudden return, Vanessa wouldn't be this laughingstock, this pitiful spectacle...

"Na-Nathan?" Vanessa's voice quivered as she searched the man's impassive face.

Nathan signaled a waiter to assist the shivering woman, his voice devoid of warmth. "You staged your earlier fall, didn't you?"

Vanessa's eyes darted nervously. "That's absurd! Why would I—"

"Enough." Nathan's glacial tone silenced her. The weight of his scrutiny made Vanessa shrink back into the pool's embrace.

"I'll arrange your departure."

Vanessa's relief was short-lived. A collective gasp drew all eyes upward.

Evelyn stood on the mezzanine balcony, casually leaning against the wrought iron railing. A crocodile leather suitcase rested at her feet while she took a languid drag from a cigarette, the smoke curling around her like a halo.

The crowd watched, mesmerized, as Evelyn flicked open the suitcase with one manicured hand.

What happened next would be talked about for years.

With deliberate nonchalance, Evelyn began tossing handfuls of hundred-dollar bills over the railing. The crisp banknotes fluttered through the air like golden leaves, carpeting the terrace and floating atop the pool's surface.

Waiters and guests alike scrambled to catch the raining fortune. The scene descended into controlled chaos as Evelyn increased her tempo, her expression one of detached amusement.

When mere handfuls no longer satisfied, Evelyn upended the entire suitcase. A veritable waterfall of cash - twenty-five million dollars' worth - cascaded down upon the stunned crowd, showering Nathan and a dumbstruck Vanessa in a blizzard of Benjamin Franklins.
###Chapter 13 Send Her Away

Nathan Blackwood, this is what you've paid me throughout the three years—for my blood. Now that I've returned it all, we're even.

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was icy, her words cutting through the air like a blade.

Nathan's dark eyes burned with an unreadable emotion, his jaw clenched tight. The tension between them was palpable.

The crowd had witnessed everything. Moments ago, Vanessa Holloway had accused Evelyn of being a gold-digger, clinging to Nathan for his wealth. But in an instant, Evelyn had silenced her by returning every penny Nathan had ever given her. Vanessa's reputation lay in ruins.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away, her steps steady and deliberate. Vanessa stood frozen, teeth chattering—whether from the cold or humiliation, no one could tell.

That woman will be the death of me, Vanessa seethed inwardly.

"Nathan, Evelyn must hate me now. Let's just go," she pleaded, her voice trembling.

But Nathan wasn't about to let this misunderstanding fester. "Wait for me at the entrance," he ordered, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He strode inside, his gaze locking onto Evelyn, who was seated on a lounge chair. Beside her, Alexander Sterling—her eldest brother—knelt, gently massaging her sore ankles, his expression tender. The sight made Nathan's stomach twist.

Both looked up as he approached. Alexander smirked, casually draping an arm around Evelyn in a protective gesture. "Mr. Blackwood, shouldn't you be comforting your companion? Or do you have more accusations to throw at my sister?"

Nathan's glare was glacial, his voice sharp. "Evelyn, if I've wronged you, take it up with me. But you owe Vanessa an apology."

Evelyn tilted her head, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "And if I refuse? Will you push me into the water too?"

Her defiance grated on him. Seeing her so comfortable with another man—especially her brother—only fueled his frustration. "Since we were once married, let me offer you some advice. Kindness goes a long way."

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "You clearly don’t know me at all, Nathan. Kindness was never my strong suit."

Nathan exhaled sharply, his patience snapping. "Fine." He turned on his heel and stormed off, his original purpose—to explain his relationship with Vanessa—forgotten in his anger.

Evelyn's smile faded as she watched him leave. Alexander squeezed her shoulder gently. "Lil E, do you still have feelings for him?"

"Not a chance," she scoffed. She wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

Inside Nathan's car, Vanessa huddled under his coat, shivering. She opened her mouth to explain, to salvage the situation—but the driver suddenly gasped.

"Isn't that Ms. Holloway?"

The car slowed as the driver pointed to the massive digital billboard towering over The Regal Grand. The prime advertising space—worth millions per minute—was replaying the earlier scene by the pool.

Though their faces were blurred, everyone at the gala would recognize them.

Nathan's eyes locked onto the screen. The silent footage was damning—it showed Evelyn never laid a hand on Vanessa. Vanessa had taken a deliberate step back, then dramatically fallen into the water.

The air in the car turned suffocating.

Nathan's expression darkened, his fury simmering beneath the surface. Just minutes ago, he had demanded Evelyn apologize—based on a lie.

This was her response.

Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.

Vanessa's face drained of color. She had never imagined someone would broadcast the surveillance footage for the entire city to see.

The car door slammed shut.

Nathan stood outside, his voice like ice. "You're leaving for Paris first thing tomorrow."
###Chapter 14 Parachuted

Vanessa Holloway begged in the car, but Nathan Blackwood felt like a volcano ready to erupt.

Had everything been a lie? Every moment of their three years together?

As Nathan strode down the sidewalk, the chilly wind biting at his skin, a sleek silver Porsche pulled up beside him. The window rolled down to reveal Tristan Whitmore's grinning face. "Get in, man."

Tristan had witnessed the entire scene at the gala. After Nathan stormed out, he'd grown bored and decided to leave too—only to find his friend wandering the streets like some heartbroken protagonist in a bad romance novel.

Nathan slid into the passenger seat and immediately lit a cigarette. The curling smoke reminded him of Evelyn Sinclair's elegant fingers holding her cigarette earlier, and his jaw tightened.

"So," Tristan drawled, "that was Evelyn, huh? What's her deal with Alexander Sterling from New York?"

The question made Nathan's grip tighten on his cigarette. These were exactly the questions he didn't have answers to—and didn't want to think about.

Thank God there hadn't been any reporters at the event. The Blackwood name carried enough weight to prevent private scandals from spreading, but still...

"We all thought you dodged a bullet divorcing that gold-digger," Tristan continued, oblivious to Nathan's darkening mood. "Did you see how she treated Vanessa? And now she's cozying up to Alexander Sterling? I never pegged her for that kind of social climber."

Nathan's knuckles turned white around the cigarette. "Shut up, Tristan."

Tristan raised his hands in surrender. "Just saying—at least she had the decency to sign the papers. Women like her should know their place."

Nathan stubbed out the cigarette violently and tossed it out the window. "Let's get a drink."

"Now you're talking." Tristan grinned and hit the gas.

Nathan needed something—anything—to drown out the storm raging in his chest.

Meanwhile, back at the gala, Evelyn had become the unexpected center of attention. Alexander took the opportunity to formally introduce her as the newly appointed Vice President of Sterling Corporation. The whispers about their relationship grew louder, but neither bothered to address them—they had more important things to focus on.

Before revealing Evelyn's true identity as the Sterling heiress, she needed to prove herself capable. Alexander had already assigned his most trusted assistant, Bennett, to support her. He'd also carved out time in his packed schedule for private mentoring sessions, which meant Evelyn now spent two extra hours in his office every evening.

"Honestly," Alexander teased as he caught her lounging in his office chair, "if you keep this up, I'll have Father personally oversee your training."

Evelyn bolted upright. "You wouldn't dare."

Alexander chuckled. "Kingsley Tech's anniversary is in two days. They're offering a major project—consider it your first test."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with determination. "Consider it done."

"Don't get cocky. Every major company will be fighting for this contract. I'll be overseas during the negotiations, but Lucas should be back by then."

"Lucas is coming home?" Evelyn's face lit up. She hadn't seen her youngest brother in months—not since catching his latest blockbuster.

Alexander checked his watch. "Come on, let's get dinner."

But the moment they stepped into the upscale restaurant, Evelyn's smile vanished. Of all the places in San Francisco...

Margaret and Sophia Blackwood sat at a prime table near the window.

"Manager!" Sophia's shrill voice cut through the elegant ambiance. "Does this establishment allow just anyone to waltz in?" Her venomous gaze locked onto Evelyn.
###Chapter 15 The Wine Incident

Sophia Blackwood had been gambling away her fortune in Germany, completely unaware that the scandal of her stealing family jewels had exploded across social media back in San Francisco.

Her reputation was in tatters.

When she finally returned to the States, the elite women who once admired her now looked at her with open disdain.

And the one who had orchestrated it all?

Evelyn Sinclair—the very woman they had cast out of the Blackwood family.

Now, seeing Evelyn in this upscale restaurant, Sophia's blood boiled.

In the past, she had looked down on Evelyn's unknown origins, treating her like dirt.

The moment she recognized her, Sophia immediately summoned the restaurant manager.

The manager rushed over, sweating. Every guest here was a VIP, carefully vetted—people they couldn't afford to offend.

"Ms. Blackwood, my sincerest apologies—"

Sophia's glare burned into Evelyn, her fingers itching to slap that composed face.

"She's ruining my appetite," Sophia snapped. "Get her out of here. We're your most valued patrons!"

The manager turned—and froze.

Alexander Sterling stood there, his handsome face darkening with displeasure.

Beside him, Evelyn remained perfectly poised, her long waves cascading down her back, her expression unreadable.

She looked every inch the untouchable heiress, completely unfazed by Sophia's tantrum.

The manager hurriedly bowed.

"Mr. Sterling! Your private dining room is ready. Right this way."

Sophia's eyes flickered to Alexander, momentarily stunned—until she noticed the protective way his hand rested on Evelyn's lower back.

Her lips curled in disgust.

"Hey! Are you deaf? I said remove them!"

Margaret Blackwood sneered from the side.

"Look at her, acting all high and mighty. Who does she think she is?"

She smirked at Evelyn.

"Found yourself a sugar daddy, huh? Did you forget? You were thrown out like trash. You don’t belong here."

Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice.

"Thrown out?" His laugh was razor-sharp. "How creative. Since when did the Blackwoods become such shameless liars?"

His fury was palpable.

What kind of life had Evelyn endured with these people?

Margaret flushed red.

She turned to the manager, seething.

"Why are you still standing there? I said I don't want them here!"

The manager's expression hardened.

"Mrs. Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood—Mr. Sterling is the majority shareholder of this establishment. If their presence offends you, the door is that way."

Margaret and Sophia gaped.

Evelyn chuckled, her gaze cool.

She turned to Alexander.

"Go ahead. I'll handle this."

Alexander hesitated, but the steel in her eyes reassured him.

With a sharp nod, he strode inside—obedient as a well-trained guard dog.

Left alone, Sophia scoffed.

"At least you know your place. But don’t think your new man changes anything. My brother never wanted you. I could make you disappear from San Francisco with one call."

Evelyn tilted her head, amused.

"What do you want?"

Sophia smirked.

"Pour me a glass of wine. And apologize. You were always good at serving others, weren’t you? Do it right, and maybe I’ll let you crawl away this time."

She leaned back, waiting for Evelyn to grovel.

Evelyn smiled.

She picked up the decanter, poured the wine with practiced elegance—and then, without hesitation, upended the glass over Sophia's head.

The crimson liquid splashed down her perfectly styled hair.

Before Sophia could scream, Evelyn gripped her shoulders, shoving her back into the chair.

Leaning close, she whispered, her voice deadly soft:

"Remember this, Sophia."

"I was the one who filed for divorce."

"I was the one who walked away."

"And if you ever twist the truth again?"

Her fingers dug in.

"I'll show you exactly who disappears from this city."
###Chapter 16: Unexpected Confrontation

Evelyn Sinclair walked away with effortless grace. Sophia Blackwood's face turned ghostly pale, her mouth hanging open in shock.

Before she could react, Margaret Blackwood erupted in fury, snapping at the waiter to clean up the spilled wine.

"That wretched Evelyn! How dare she humiliate you like this?" Margaret spat, her voice dripping with venom.

But Evelyn was already being escorted by the manager to the private dining area, leaving Sophia drenched in red wine.

Her designer dress was ruined, her hair soaked. The humiliation burned through her like wildfire.

When she finally regained her composure, Sophia's first instinct was to chase after Evelyn—but a waiter blocked her path.

"Miss, would you like a change of clothes?"

The other diners stared, whispering behind their hands. Sophia clenched her fists, her cheeks flaming.

"This isn't over!" she seethed.

Alexander Sterling's mood had soured after the altercation, but Evelyn remained unshaken. She glanced at him with a small smile.

"Lex, I'm meeting Isabella for shopping later. Care to join?"

He shot her a sharp look. "How can you think about shopping after what just happened? The Blackwoods treat you like dirt!"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "It doesn't matter. Don't let it bother you. They won't dare cross me again—not like before."

As they stepped outside, Nathan Blackwood's car was already waiting.

The moment Sophia spotted Evelyn, she yanked Nathan out of the vehicle, tears streaming down her face.

"Brother, look what she did to me! She humiliated me in front of everyone!"

Evelyn didn't spare them a glance, tightening her grip on Alexander's arm as she walked past.

Nathan's expression darkened. He couldn't believe Evelyn would act so boldly.

After Wendy's false accusations, he had expected her to explain herself—but she didn't even look at him.

Frustrated, he grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Evelyn. Explain yourself."

She met his gaze with icy indifference. "I did it. What's there to explain?"

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "are you here to avenge your sister?"

"Brother, don't let her go!" Sophia shrieked. "Make her apologize!"

Nathan frowned. "Sophia, enough."

Sophia smirked. "I'll forgive her if she bows and begs."

Evelyn laughed—a sharp, mocking sound. "Apologize? Like I used to?"

She turned to Nathan. "Do you agree with her?"

"Check the security footage before jumping to conclusions," Alexander cut in coldly. "Miss Blackwood isn't as innocent as she pretends."

Sophia flinched under his glare, shrinking behind Nathan.

"I—I didn't do anything wrong!" she stammered.

Nathan's jaw tightened.

Evelyn scoffed. "The old Evelyn would have let this slide. But not anymore."

Alexander added, "The footage doesn't lie. Review it at your leisure."

With that, he guided Evelyn to his car, shutting the door firmly behind her.

The Blackwoods were left standing in stunned silence.
###Chapter 17: Fate's Cruel Joke

Nathan Blackwood stood motionless as Alexander Sterling's sleek black car disappeared around the corner, his piercing gaze dark with unreadable emotions.

His ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair had become an enigma—a runaway train he could no longer predict.

The woman who once tread carefully around him now dared to hurl insults without hesitation.

Sophia Blackwood seethed, unwilling to let Evelyn escape so easily. She lunged forward, but Nathan yanked her back with a sharp tug.

"Enough!" His voice cut through the air like a blade.

"Brother, how can you defend her?" Sophia's voice trembled with outrage. "That ungrateful wretch humiliated me—humiliated our family! After everything we gave her—"

"Sophia," Nathan interrupted coldly, "the jewelry in Highland Estates' safe belonged to Evelyn. Who gave you permission to take it?"

Though he had never personally gifted them to her, everything in that mansion had been theirs—his and Evelyn's.

Sophia scoffed. "It's just a necklace! Why are you acting like I stole from the Crown Jewels?"

Her lips curled in disdain. "Besides, what use does she have for something like the Daydream now? She's probably selling it off to fund her new boy toy!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. He wanted to reprimand her, but Sophia's eyes welled with crocodile tears, her lower lip quivering dramatically.

"I'll review the security footage."

Sophia froze mid-sob.

"You—you don't believe me?" Her voice cracked. "She set me up!"

Nathan shot her a sidelong glance. "We'll see."

As he strode into the restaurant, Sophia scrambled after him, panic flickering in her eyes.

"Brother, open your eyes!" she hissed. "Look at how that man dotes on her! She probably cheated on you long before the divorce—used your money to keep him!"

She spat the words like venom, desperate to turn Nathan against Evelyn.

"Enough!" Nathan's voice was lethal.

He stormed off, leaving Sophia gaping.

The restaurant manager, already briefed by Alexander, handed Nathan the surveillance footage without question.

One minute passed.

Then two.

Nathan's expression darkened with every second.

Sophia fidgeted beside him, her nails digging into her palms.

On screen, she and Margaret Blackwood hurled vicious insults—words so cruel they made Nathan's stomach twist.

Yet Evelyn stood there, eerily calm.

As if this wasn't new.

As if she'd endured it countless times before.

His chest constricted.

Had his family always treated her like this?

And her retaliation today—was this the first time she'd ever fought back?

A storm of emotions raged inside him.

Abruptly, he stopped the video and turned on his heel.

"Brother, wait—!"

Sophia's plea fell on deaf ears.

Nathan whirled around, his gaze burning into hers.

"This wasn't the first time, was it?"

Sophia paled. "W-what?"

"I was just angry!" she blurted. "She moved on so fast—it's disgusting!"

Nathan's laugh was hollow. He no longer recognized the spoiled, spiteful girl before him.

"Apologize to Evelyn."

"Never!" Sophia shrieked. "She ruined my dress! Why should I apologize?"

Nathan's eyes turned to ice.

"Because if you don't," he said softly, "I'll cut off your trust fund."

Sophia's breath hitched.

For the first time in her life, she realized—her brother wasn't bluffing.
###Chapter 18 Someone You Can't Afford to Cross

Sophia Blackwood grabbed Nathan Blackwood's arm. "Brother, you have to help me!" Her voice was sharp with desperation. "Didn't Evelyn Sinclair steal your money to fund her lover? She's obviously involved with that man!"

Nathan shook her off, his expression darkening. His voice was icy when he finally spoke. "That man is Alexander Sterling from New York City. He's not someone you can afford to cross."

A flicker of doubt crossed his mind. Had their divorce really been just his fault? Or was the entire Blackwood family to blame?

Sophia froze. Though she had never met Alexander Sterling, every woman in high society knew he was the most elusive bachelor in New York—mysterious, powerful, and utterly untouchable.

Countless women would kill to marry him, yet Evelyn was the one by his side? The thought infuriated her. Since her brother refused to back her up, she had no choice but to turn elsewhere. She immediately dialed a number. "Tristan, Evelyn humiliated me. You have to help me."

At Sterling Tower, Evelyn watched as Alexander expertly prepared her coffee, his movements smooth and precise. Just then, her phone buzzed—Dominic Young, CEO of Horizon Media.

"Evelyn, I have inside information. Sophia Blackwood hired someone to tail you discreetly. Do you need assistance handling this?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint, indifferent smile. "No, let her play her little game. It'll save me on publicity costs."

After she hung up, Alexander frowned slightly. "Problem?"

"Sophia sent someone to follow me. Let her waste her time." He didn’t seem concerned—such petty schemes were beneath their notice. He handed her the steaming cup. "Careful, it's hot."

Evelyn took it with a grin, inhaling the rich aroma. "Your coffee is still the best. Even better than those overpriced baristas in Paris."

Alexander scoffed, shaking his head. "You're the only one privileged enough to drink it."

Satisfied, Evelyn took a sip before remembering something. "Since I start officially tomorrow, can I bring Isabella along as my assistant for the first few days?"

Alexander shrugged. "Do whatever you want."

Thinking of the way Isabella looked at Alexander, Evelyn quickly texted her. [You're officially hired! Start tomorrow.]

Isabella replied instantly. [Yes, ma'am!]

Isabella Montgomery came from the affluent Montgomery family. When she offered to help Evelyn, her real goal was simple—more time around Alexander.

Evelyn saw right through her but didn’t call her out. After all, she wanted her best friend and brother to get together.

In high spirits, Evelyn left for their girls' night out. The two headed to their favorite spot—Velvet Lounge.

The bar pulsed with energy, the bass thumping through the floor. Neon lights flickered as bodies moved in sync with the music.

Isabella, thrilled about working at Sterling Corp, drank freely, her laughter ringing above the noise. After a few rounds, they hit the dance floor.

Both women were stunning—one fiery and vivacious, the other cool and regal. Heads turned instantly.

Even as her words slurred, Isabella insisted on another drink. Evelyn sighed, squeezing her hand. "I'm going to the restroom. Stay here."

Isabella waved her off with a giggle.

When Evelyn returned minutes later, her blood ran cold.

A hulking man loomed over Isabella, his grip tight around her wrist.

He had noticed them earlier—two beauties dancing alone. Seeing Isabella vulnerable, he’d seized his chance.

He hadn’t expected Evelyn to return so soon.

Their eyes locked.

And hers burned with fury.
###Chapter 19 Video

"Since you're already here, why rush off? Stay and have a drink with me." The man's eyes roamed over Evelyn with predatory interest, his lips twisting into a sly smirk. His voice carried an unsettling mix of threat and persuasion.

Isabella Montgomery swayed slightly, her intoxication evident. The stranger had one hand gripping her neck, ready to drag her away at any moment.

Evelyn Sinclair met his gaze without flinching. "Release her. Now."

The man's smirk widened as he gestured toward a glass on the counter. "Come take this drink yourself, and maybe I'll consider it."

She didn't need to examine the glass to know what it contained. The warning from a bystander confirmed her suspicions. "Miss, don't go near him. That's Dominic Kingsley - he runs the underground fights in Montecito."

"A gangster?" Evelyn actually laughed, the sound sharp and humorless. She turned to the concerned stranger. "I appreciate the warning, but this won't take long."

Turning back to Kingsley, she arched one perfect eyebrow. "If I come over, you'll let her go?"

"Cross my heart." He licked his lips, already imagining his victory. Two beautiful women in one night - what luck!

Evelyn strode forward with the confidence of a panther approaching prey. When she stood mere inches from him, she repeated calmly, "I'm here. Release her."

"You're much prettier than this drunk anyway," he slurred, reaching out to touch her face.

The sound of shattering glass echoed through the Velvet Lounge as a bottle connected with his skull. His scream pierced the air, cut short when Evelyn twisted his wrist backward with a sickening crack. Before he could react, her boot connected with his chest, sending him crashing to the floor.

The entire confrontation lasted less than thirty seconds. The music cut out abruptly, leaving the bar in stunned silence as the notorious gangster writhed on the ground, moaning in pain. Blood trickled from his scalp as he curled into a fetal position.

Evelyn picked up the spiked drink with elegant fingers, crouching beside her victim. Her voice remained perfectly composed. "Would you prefer to drink this yourself, or shall I help you?"

Under the pulsing neon lights, her smile took on a dangerous edge. The gangster whimpered, his bravado shattered along with the bottle against his skull. "P-please, I was just-"

"I'll take that as a request for assistance." She fisted her hand in his hair, yanking his head back. Without ceremony, she poured the entire contents of the glass down his throat.

Dusting her hands, Evelyn stood and crossed to Isabella, slinging her friend's arm over her shoulders. "Let's go. This trash ruined our evening."

The crowd parted silently as she walked out, leaving behind a scene that would become Velvet Lounge legend. No one noticed the paparazzi capturing every moment from the shadows.

One photographer dialed a familiar number with shaking hands. "Mr. Whitmore? We've got footage of Evelyn Sinclair assaulting someone at the Velvet Lounge. This could destroy her public image if we release it."

Tristan Whitmore paused mid-bite of his imported caviar, a slow smile spreading across his face. "Post it immediately."

He ended the call, chuckling to himself. "Already showing your true colors, Evelyn? After betraying Nathan and humiliating Sophia, it's time you learned some consequences."
###Chapter 20 The Storm Returns

The digital world exploded at midnight when an anonymous account released a carefully edited video clip.

Every crucial context had been surgically removed, leaving only Evelyn Sinclair's defensive actions against the mysterious man.

Without the full story, the footage painted Evelyn as an unhinged aggressor attacking an innocent victim.

Morning light found Evelyn preparing for her first official day at Sterling Enterprises, carefully selecting a navy power suit.

Her routine was shattered when Isabella Montgomery stormed into the penthouse, phone in hand.

"Evelyn! The internet's crucifying you again!"

Evelyn's hands stilled on her pearl earrings. "What now?"

The ten-second clip showed only two things: Evelyn's furious expression and the man's theatrical cowering.

The comments section was a warzone.

"Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife caught brawling at Velvet Lounge!"

"Who knew society princess Evelyn Sinclair was so violent?"

Within hours, #EvelynSinclairScandal was trending worldwide.

The paparazzi's carefully crafted narrative had worked perfectly.

Evelyn's phone began buzzing with notifications from every major tabloid.

Isabella paced furiously. "We need to release the full security footage immediately!"

Evelyn examined her manicure calmly. "Not yet."

"But your reputation—"

"Will survive this." Evelyn snapped her clutch shut with finality. "First, I have a company to run."

The real battle, she knew, wasn't in the court of public opinion.

It was in the boardroom she was about to enter.

The paparazzi struck under the cover of darkness.

They uploaded the carefully edited footage, stripping away all context. Only Evelyn Sinclair's violent outburst remained—ten seconds that painted her as the aggressor against a helpless man.

By morning, the clip had gone viral.

Evelyn woke refreshed, ready for her first official day at Sterling Corp. She was selecting her outfit when Isabella Montgomery stormed in, phone in hand.

"Evelyn! The internet is tearing you apart again!"

Evelyn paused. "Why?"

Isabella shoved the screen at her. The video showed only Evelyn's furious expression and the man's cowering form. The caption read: Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife caught in bar brawl—shocking violence!

Comments flooded in:

"Typical rich girl behavior."

"No wonder Nathan divorced her."

"She's terrifying."

Evelyn swiped the phone away. "Ignore it. It's just noise."

Isabella fumed. Though tipsy last night, she remembered clearly—Evelyn had defended her. "No! I won't let this slide—"

"Drop it," Evelyn said. "We have work."

Outside, Archibald, Sterling Manor's butler, stood waiting. "Miss, your car is ready."

Evelyn frowned. A Rolls-Royce was too conspicuous. "No, I'll drive myself."

Archibald produced a set of keys. "Mr. Sterling prepared alternatives: a Maserati and Porsche. The Lamborghinis and Ferraris arrive next week."

Isabella gaped. "Your dad spoils you rotten!"

Her tiny convertible couldn't buy one tire of Evelyn's fleet.

Evelyn sighed. "I'm supposed to blend in. I'll ride with Isabella."

Archibald bowed. "Very kind, Ms. Montgomery."

Isabella grinned. "Honored to chauffeur the great Evelyn Sinclair."

They laughed, then dashed off before Archibald could protest. "He's worse than Dad!"

At Sterling Corp, Alexander Sterling introduced Evelyn as the new director—a coveted position many had eyed.

Whispers spread instantly. Beyond being Nathan's ex, Evelyn was an enigma.

Olivia Kensington, who'd expected the role, sneered. "What qualifies you? Three years as Mrs. Blackwood?"

She stood, voice dripping with disdain. "I refuse to work under someone like you. I'll resign if this stands."

Alexander checked his watch, unfazed. "Submit your resignation. I'll approve it immediately."
###Chapter 21

The air in the conference room turned thick with tension.

Olivia Kensington's face burned with humiliation. She had clawed her way up the corporate ladder through years of relentless effort. This wasn't how her career at Sterling Corp would end.

Alexander Sterling's public defense of Evelyn Sinclair felt like a slap across Olivia's carefully made-up face.

All eyes darted between the executives seated around the mahogany table.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. Starting her new position with enemies wasn't part of the plan. Just as she opened her mouth to diffuse the situation, Olivia rose abruptly, her chair scraping against the marble floor.

"Mr. Sterling," Olivia's voice trembled with forced composure, "I apologize for my inappropriate remarks. I fully support the board's decision and look forward to collaborating with Ms. Sinclair."

"Good. Meeting adjourned."

Alexander's curt response cut through the room like a blade. Without another word, the CEO strode out, his Italian leather shoes clicking against the polished surface.

Olivia exhaled sharply when the door clicked shut.

Though murmurs of dissent still lingered among the executives, nobody dared challenge Alexander Sterling's authority openly.

Evelyn dismissed the incident with a mental shrug. Her work would speak for itself soon enough.

Bennett entered her new office precisely at 10:15 AM. "Ms. Sinclair, I'll be assisting you moving forward. Please don't hesitate to delegate any tasks."

Evelyn appreciated the gesture. Having Alexander's most trusted aide as her assistant signaled the CEO's full support. "Thank you, Bennett. Could you pull all the files on Kingsley Tech's latest project? Alexander mentioned it during our briefing."

"Consider it done." Bennett gave a professional nod before exiting.

The door had barely closed when Isabella Montgomery breezed in, twirling her rose gold iPhone. "Darling! They gave me the corner office right across from yours. We're practically neighbors again!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a genuine smile. Having Isabella back in her daily life felt like reclaiming a piece of herself she'd lost during her disastrous marriage to Nathan Blackwood.

"It'll be chaos at first, but we'll manage," Evelyn warned.

Isabella tossed her caramel locks with a dramatic flip. "Please, I thrive on chaos. Oh! You have to see this." She thrust her phone at Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyes widened at the screen. Overnight, she'd become Twitter's top trending topic again.

Isabella had leaked the unedited security footage from Velvet Lounge to several influential bloggers. The viral video clearly showed Tristan Whitmore's hired thug harassing a intoxicated Isabella before Evelyn intervened.

The internet had exploded.

[OMG QUEEN BEHAVIOR! Who needs men when you have ride-or-die besties like this?!] [That's why she walked away from the Blackwood fortune - she's her own damn empire!] [Evelyn Sinclair for president!] [Somebody get this woman her own reality show!]

Evelyn shot Isabella an exasperated look. "You went back for the surveillance footage?"

"Please," Isabella scoffed, "one phone call to the club owner. Nobody messes with my best friend and gets away with it."

Evelyn shook her head but couldn't suppress a chuckle. The media circus hardly mattered now.

"Do you know who orchestrated this?" Evelyn already had her suspicions.

Isabella's expression turned serious. "Tristan Whitmore. Nathan's lapdog."

Just as Evelyn had guessed.

Whether it was Sophia Blackwood or Tristan Whitmore, they all answered to Nathan in the end.

Evelyn's smile vanished. She might have ignored petty gossip, but deliberate character assassination demanded retaliation.

"Call Dominic Young. I want every skeleton in Tristan Whitmore's closet."

Isabella's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Now that's the Evelyn Sinclair I know and love. Don't worry, I've been collecting dirt on that weasel for months."

She forwarded an entire dossier to Evelyn's phone. After scrolling through the files, Evelyn selected a particularly damning photo - Tristan at a pool party, arms around three bikini-clad women during his honeymoon.

Evelyn posted it with a caption that would make headlines by lunchtime:

[If you've got a problem with me, say it to my face. I fight fair. Unlike some people who pay paparazzi to doctor videos. Watch your back, Mr. Whitmore. Karma's coming for you.]
###Chapter 22 The Fall of a Fool

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers flew across her phone screen as she posted the damning evidence using her newly created social media account.

Within minutes, the post went viral.

Influencers across platforms began sharing her revelations, their massive followings amplifying the scandal. The internet exploded with reactions.

Evelyn's follower count multiplied exponentially as the digital mob descended upon Tristan Whitmore's online presence.

People started digging into Tristan's privileged background, his shady business dealings, even his private party photos that somehow leaked.

Kingsley Tech Headquarters.

Tristan stormed into Nathan Blackwood's office without knocking. "You need to control your ex-wife!" he shouted, face flushed with rage.

Nathan barely glanced up from his contract review. His icy gaze flickered to Tristan for only a second before returning to his documents.

"Look at this!" Tristan shoved his phone in Nathan's face, displaying the brutal online takedown. "She's publicly humiliating me! My wife's filing for divorce because of this!"

Nathan's expression darkened as he scanned the posts. After a tense silence, his deep voice cut through the room. "So you tried to cyberbully her... and got outplayed?"

Tristan stiffened. "I just wanted to scare her a little! How was I supposed to know those paparazzi would screw me over?"

Nathan tossed the phone onto his desk with a clatter. "You deserve this."

"Come on, man! I only got involved because Sophia asked me to help!" Tristan's voice cracked with desperation. "If not for me, they'd be coming after your sister instead!"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the mention of his sister's meddling. The restaurant incident should have been warning enough about her foolishness.

Tristan kept pleading. "That bitch went straight to Dominic Young at Horizon Media! Now no one will take my calls. I'm being crucified online!"

The situation had spiraled beyond Tristan's worst nightmares. Evelyn's counterattack left him exposed and vulnerable.

His grandfather threatened to disown him. His social circle mocked him. Even his usually docile wife had grown a spine.

Tristan didn't care about the marriage - but losing his family's support would ruin him.

Nathan finally looked up, his cold stare piercing. "There's only one person who can fix this for you."

"Evelyn?" Tristan recoiled. "I'm not groveling to that scheming-"

The office door opened as Harrison entered. "Sir, the board is waiting."

Nathan stood, straightening his suit. "Handle your own mess." He walked out without another glance.

Defeated, Tristan slumped in his car, ignoring the barrage of angry calls from his family.

"This is bullshit!" He slammed his fist against the steering wheel.

But he had no choice. Unless he appeased Evelyn, his life would implode.

With great reluctance, Tristan ordered his assistant to post a public apology from his verified account with 800,000 followers:

[I sincerely regret sharing edited content about Ms. Sinclair. My actions were inappropriate and I take full responsibility for any harm caused.]

The surrender was complete.

Tristan knew Evelyn must have concrete proof of his involvement. Continuing this battle would only bring more humiliation.

Though not a public figure, the damage to his reputation stung. His social circle would never let him live this down.

Sterling Corporation.

Isabella Montgomery breezed into Evelyn's office, waving her phone triumphantly. "Tristan Whitmore folded faster than cheap lawn furniture! I expected at least a day of fighting."

Evelyn smirked, scrolling through the apology. "Some men can't handle when a woman fights back."
###Chapter 23

Evelyn Sinclair

Evelyn scrolled through her phone, her lips curling into a smirk as she skimmed the trending headlines. Without a second thought, she tossed it aside.

She knew the Whitmore family inside out. There was no doubt Tristan’s parents had forced his hand.

That man would rather swallow glass than admit he was wrong.

Right now, he was probably seething with rage at the mere thought of her.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. Olivia Kensington pushed the door open without waiting for an answer, her smile polished but insincere.

"Ms. Evelyn, do you have a moment?"

Evelyn gestured lazily. "Come in."

Olivia stepped inside, her gaze flickering toward Isabella Montgomery with clear annoyance. But Isabella, blissfully oblivious, didn’t budge.

"What is it?" Evelyn asked.

"I noticed Mr. Bennett is compiling data for the Kingsley Tech project." Olivia leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "You might not be aware, but we don’t have strong ties with them. The chances of collaboration are… slim."

She slid a folder across the desk, her manicured nails tapping against the surface.

"If you want to make an impression, why not consider Kensington Group? They have a project that’s perfect for us."

Evelyn studied her for a beat before flipping open the file. "I’ll think about it."

Olivia’s smile tightened. "You should act fast, Ms. Evelyn. Kensington is a long-standing partner. Securing this deal would solidify your position here."

Interesting.

Olivia had been gunning for her at the meeting, and now she was handing her a golden opportunity?

Too good to be true.

Evelyn leaned back, her voice cool. "It’s Vice President Sinclair to you."

Olivia’s face twisted. "Don’t get ahead of yourself just because the CEO favors you!" Her voice rose shrilly. "Whether you last here depends on more than luck. I’ve given you the chance—take it or leave it!"

She stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Isabella blinked. "Who’s the boss here again?"

Evelyn chuckled, flipping through the documents. "She thought this position was hers before I showed up."

"Delusional," Isabella snorted.

Evelyn handed her the file. "Isn’t the VP of Kensington Group one of your admirers?"

Isabella grinned. "Say no more. I’ll dig up whatever’s fishy about this."

Her phone buzzed. The caller ID flashed—Natalie Beaumont, her old friend and the powerhouse behind the luxury fashion brand Lumière.

Natalie’s private shows were near-impossible to get into.

Evelyn answered, and Natalie’s excited voice spilled out. "You’re coming out tonight! We’re throwing a little welcome-back party at Velvet Lounge. No excuses!"

Evelyn laughed. She had missed them. "I’ll be there."

As soon as she hung up, Isabella added her to a group chat—Sebastian Hart, Julian Hart, and Natalie.

[Natalie Beaumont]: Evelyn’s back in the group! Cheers, darling!

[Sebastian Hart]: I already drank myself stupid celebrating your divorce. Took you long enough!

[Julian Hart]: Congrats on ditching that loser, Nikki!

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Are they seriously throwing a party over my failed marriage?"

Isabella sighed. "No, you idiot. We’re celebrating because you’re free. When we heard how miserable you were, everyone in this group cursed Nathan Blackwood’s name. We just didn’t want to upset you by adding you sooner."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "I really don’t deserve you guys."

Meanwhile, Tristan Whitmore was drowning his sorrows, dragging Nathan Blackwood to Velvet Lounge.

As they stepped out of the car, Tristan froze.

"You’ve got to be kidding me," he muttered. "Why is she everywhere I go?"
###Chapter 24

Nathan Blackwood followed Tristan Whitmore's gaze and froze instantly at the sight before him.

Evelyn Sinclair stood radiant in a shimmering silver-gray gown that transitioned into a fiery crimson hemline, cinched perfectly at her slender waist. The dress accentuated her statuesque figure, making her appear even more breathtaking. Her cascading waves of hair framed her back like a living masterpiece, her entire presence commanding attention.

Tristan muttered a curse under his breath. "What kind of twisted fate is this? Can't even grab a drink without running into people I despise."

Isabella Montgomery's group immediately noticed Nathan and Tristan. Though none of them wanted this encounter, they couldn't ignore the men now that they'd crossed paths.

"Mr. Whitmore," Isabella said with a mocking smile, "finished cleaning up your scandalous love life already? Surprised you still have the nerve to show your face in public after those photos circulated. Or was the damage not severe enough for you?"

Tristan's eyes flashed with anger as they landed on Evelyn. "Evelyn," he sneered, "I must admit I underestimated you. Never thought you had this side to you."

Natalie Beaumont stepped forward protectively. "Of course she's changed! After wasting three years with that useless ex-husband of hers, it's about time she showed her true colors. Though I notice you still run to your friends whenever you're in trouble, Mr. Whitmore."

Spotting Nathan, Natalie's expression darkened. She tugged Isabella's arm. "Let's not waste our breath on them. Come on, let's go inside."

Evelyn walked past them with icy indifference, not sparing either man a single glance. A strikingly handsome man followed closely behind her, carrying her designer clutch.

As he passed Nathan, the man shot him a disdainful look before following Evelyn inside. Tristan fumed, his face reddening. "Who does she think she is? First she ruins my reputation online, now she acts like we're beneath her notice?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Enough. Do you want to make more of a scene? Just go home."

"Not a chance," Tristan snapped. "Why should I leave? I want to see what other tricks she has up her sleeve."

Despite his reluctance, Nathan found himself following Tristan into the Velvet Lounge. He recognized the clutch the handsome stranger carried - Alexander Sterling had held that same bag for Evelyn at the last gala.

Natalie practically dragged Evelyn upstairs, bubbling with excitement. "My fashion show is in three days! You have to bring Lucas. I've saved the best seats for you both!"

Julian Hart, trailing behind them, protested dramatically. "I reserved tickets ages ago and you still haven't given me mine! I demand to sit next to Evelyn!"

"Dream on!" Natalie retorted, greeting Sebastian Hart who had arrived earlier.

Evelyn laughed, unable to resist teasing Julian. "Will your father even let you attend when you're supposed to be working?"

Julian froze mid-step before clinging to Evelyn's arm like a child. "With you there, he won't dare be too hard on me."

Sebastian Hart spotted Evelyn and immediately stood, his face lighting up as he moved to embrace her. "Welcome back, my queen."

The Hart brothers, Sebastian and Julian, shared similar striking features. Julian possessed a devil-may-care handsomeness that could launch a thousand modeling careers, while Sebastian, several years older, carried himself with a more mature charm that never failed to attract admirers - though he never took any of them seriously.

Evelyn settled onto a plush seat as Sebastian abandoned his poker game, much to the dismay of his fellow players. "I'm out," he declared. "By the way, Evelyn, I booked The Lunatics for you. Enjoy the show."

Groans erupted from the table. "Sebastian! We were just getting started!"

"What a coincidence!" Tristan's voice cut through the room as he and Nathan reached the top of the stairs, finding Sebastian lounging with a glass of red wine.
###Chapter 25

The elite circles of San Francisco were small, despite their differences.

Tristan Whitmore and Sebastian Hart were acquainted through these inevitable social intersections.

When Sebastian spotted Tristan, Nathan Blackwood naturally came into view as well.

Sebastian tipped his glass slightly in acknowledgment. "What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Whitmore."

Noticing Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery seated with Sebastian, Tristan assumed they were together. He nudged Nathan toward their table. "Let's join them for a game. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Hart?"

Sebastian didn’t answer immediately. Instead, his gaze flicked to Evelyn. "My queen, shall we entertain them?"

Evelyn rose gracefully, her expression indifferent. "Suit yourselves. I'm heading downstairs for the live performance."

Isabella was quick to follow. "Yes, let's go. The air up here is getting stale."

Natalie Beaumont grabbed three bottles of premium whiskey. "I'm coming too!"

Nathan’s eyes lingered on Evelyn’s retreating figure before he turned back to Sebastian. "Mr. Hart, what exactly is your relationship with Evelyn?"

Sebastian tilted his head, a smirk playing on his lips. "Friends."

"How could someone like her be friends with you?" Tristan scoffed, but Nathan cut him off sharply.

The stage was set for two performers, though the band usually consisted of three. Yet, the duo commanded the crowd effortlessly, their energy electric.

Isabella was lost in the music, screaming near the stage, oblivious as Natalie whisked Evelyn backstage.

"Three minutes left in this set," Natalie said urgently. "Demon had an emergency appendectomy. Without the violin, the next song falls flat. You’re the only one who’s played with them before—you have to step in."

Evelyn blinked. "Me?"

"They’re counting on you. Don’t you miss this?"

The pounding rhythm tugged at memories—wild, untamed. A slow smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Fine. Let’s do it."

The crowd roared as the band transitioned. Bodies swayed, drinks raised. No one noticed the woman slipping onto the stage, violin in one hand, her flowing dress gathered in the other.

The lights dimmed, leaving a single spotlight.

Monster and Phantom—the band’s core—grinned when they saw her. Phantom launched into a deep, resonant bassline. The magic of this piece lay in the interplay between bass and violin, a dance of fire and silk.

Phantom’s fingers flew, the melody surging through the room.

Then—

The violin sang.

Rich, bold, alive.

Gasps rippled through the audience. The woman on stage was a vision—fearless, commanding. Her bow moved with precision, each note piercing the air.

The drums crashed back in, perfectly synchronized. The contrast—thunderous percussion against the violin’s liquid gold—was breathtaking.

Two minutes.

That was all it took.

The crowd erupted, louder than before.

"GODDESS!"

"VIOLIN QUEEN!"

Upstairs, Nathan Blackwood stood frozen, his shock laid bare.
###Chapter 26

Phantom guided Monster and Evelyn Sinclair offstage after their electrifying performance. Evelyn's lips curved into a radiant smile as she descended the steps with effortless grace.

Thank God I haven't lost my touch. That went better than expected.

Phantom and Monster trailed behind her, their faces glowing with exhilaration.

Monster suddenly clapped Evelyn's shoulder with enthusiasm. "Little Evelyn, why don't you make it official and join our band? We'd gladly kick Demon out for you!"

Evelyn ducked her head with an amused chuckle. "If Demon heard that, he'd probably storm out of his hospital bed just to fight you."

Monster's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Performing with you tonight was incredible. You composed this song after all - besides Demon, no one else can match our rhythm like you do. It's like you never left us three years ago."

A pang of nostalgia shot through Evelyn's chest.

She'd missed out on so much life's vibrancy these past three years. But it wasn't too late to reclaim what she'd lost.

Monster continued his enthusiastic persuasion. "Imagine the impact we'd make if you joined permanently! We'd revolutionize the entire music scene!"

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to decline, Natalie Beaumont approached with a knowing smile. "Give it up, you two. Evelyn's about to make her grand comeback!"

The moment Natalie whisked Evelyn backstage, Isabella Montgomery nearly tackled her in an enthusiastic embrace. "Evelyn darling, you were absolutely divine! My goddess! Did you see how the crowd reacted? Your violin skills are otherworldly!"

Evelyn gently disentangled herself from Isabella's bear hug. "I owe it all to Sebastian's brilliant arrangement. He made tonight unforgettable."

Assuming Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore had already left, the three women returned to the VIP section. To their surprise, both men remained seated beside the Hart brothers, their gazes locking onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity the moment she appeared. Isabella scoffed and dragged Evelyn toward Sebastian. "Let's play something. This atmosphere is ruined by certain unwelcome presences."

Sebastian shrugged with an easy smile. "Why not? The night's still young!"

Downstairs, the crowd chanted for The Lunatics' encore.

"I never knew Evelyn could play violin. How come I never heard about this?" Tristan's curiosity got the better of him, his expression genuinely shocked.

Evelyn had commanded the stage with regal confidence, captivating every audience member like a queen holding court.

"Why would we tell you? Who do you think you are?" Isabella shot back with a glare. Tristan recoiled but quickly masked it with nonchalance. "Weren't you the one who wanted to play? How about poker dice?"

"Who'd want to play with you?" Isabella sneered, still harboring resentment on Evelyn's behalf.

Nathan, who had remained silent until now, suddenly spoke in that deep, commanding voice. "Evelyn, are you afraid to play just one game with us?"

His piercing gaze hadn't left Evelyn since she'd returned.

Evelyn swirled her wine glass absently, her expression one of detached indifference as if they were beneath her notice.

Nathan suppressed his astonishment. The Evelyn before him felt simultaneously familiar and utterly foreign. Complex emotions churned in his chest, impossible to decipher.

When addressed, Evelyn lifted her chin with cool composure, meeting Nathan's gaze with a faint, challenging smile. "What exactly should I be afraid of?"

Though Nathan's challenge surprised her, fear was the last thing she felt. They were strangers now - what harm could a simple game do?

Isabella protested immediately. "Evelyn, don't indulge him! He's just trying to provoke you!"

Natalie gently pulled Isabella aside, watching the former couple with keen interest. "Relax, Evelyn knows what she's doing."

Nathan Blackwood, raised in elite society, treated social games as second nature. Poker dice was child's play for him - a guaranteed victory. Tristan couldn't hide his smug anticipation from the sidelines.

As the waiter prepared the gaming table for their face-off, Evelyn remained motionless. Instead of taking her seat, she fixed Nathan with a level gaze and posed the crucial question: "What are we playing for?"
###Chapter 27

What's the point of a game without stakes?

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze lingered on Evelyn Sinclair's impassive profile. "Well? What do you think?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Tristan Whitmore scoffed and cut in. "If Nathan loses, I'll walk out of here stark naked. But if Evelyn loses—"

His eyes flicked dismissively toward Sebastian and Julian Hart before continuing in a mocking tone, "You'll have to publicly admit you married into the Blackwood family for money. And you'll never show your face in San Francisco again. Evelyn, do you have the guts to take that bet?"

Sebastian and Julian Hart exchanged stunned glances.

Isabella Montgomery shot to her feet, ready to defend her best friend, but Natalie Beaumont tugged her back down with a warning look.

Nathan's brow furrowed deeper. He opened his mouth to intervene—

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh and arched one perfect eyebrow. "Fine. I accept."

The way she looked at Nathan then—like he wasn't even worth her time—sent a ripple of tension through the room.

Tristan nearly choked on his drink. Did this woman have any idea who she was up against?

Nathan Blackwood was unbeatable at poker dice. He could play blindfolded and still wipe the floor with anyone in this city. Hell, he'd won his first million in Vegas with these same skills. Compared to him, everyone else here might as well be amateurs.

Finally, Tristan thought, I'll get my revenge today.

Nathan extended a hand. "Ladies first."

Evelyn picked up the dice shaker with effortless grace. She gave it two casual shakes before setting it down, her fingers resting lightly on top. "Your turn."

Nathan studied her, his frown deepening. She wasn't even trying. Did she truly not care about the consequences of losing?

Tristan was practically vibrating with excitement. "Look at that pathetic attempt! Two shakes? That's it? No way she—"

Nathan lifted his own cup. Four of a kind. A guaranteed win.

He glanced at Evelyn. Her expression hadn't changed.

Tristan whooped. "That's my man! I almost thought you'd go easy on her."

Sebastian Hart chuckled from the sidelines. "Mr. Whitmore, Nathan has never gone easy on Evelyn. Though I must say, it's impressive to finally witness his skills firsthand."

"Enough flattery!" Tristan snapped. "Evelyn, show us your hand already. Don't be a sore loser."

"Tristan Whitmore!" Isabella slammed her palms on the table. "The loudest bark comes from the weakest dog. Shut your damn mouth!"

Evelyn watched the escalating tension with mild amusement. She tapped her dice cup twice before flipping it over in one smooth motion.

Before anyone could react, she grabbed her purse and stood. "I'm leaving. Enjoy the show."

While Isabella and Julian gaped, Natalie and Sebastian remained eerily calm—as if they'd expected this outcome all along.

Tristan's triumphant grin died when he saw Evelyn's dice.

Five of a kind.

How? She'd barely even shaken the damn things!

By the time he looked up, Evelyn was already gone.

Isabella smirked and rapped her knuckles against the table. "Mr. Whitmore, don't forget your part of the bargain. Strip and march—just like you said, no sore losers."

"You—you cheated!" Tristan's face burned crimson.

"Cheated?" Isabella's laugh was razor-sharp. "You're the one who insisted on this game. These are the standard rules, yet you cry foul when you lose? If you can't handle the stakes, you shouldn't have played." She turned to Nathan with a saccharine smile. "Don't you agree, Mr. Blackwood?"

Tristan shot his best friend a desperate, pleading look. Save me, his expression screamed.

Nathan's gaze swept over Isabella, then the Hart brothers, before finally settling on Tristan. "We lost."

His voice was calm. Unreadable.

Earlier, Nathan had noticed something odd—the sound of Evelyn's dice hadn't matched the movement of her hand. But strangely, he didn't feel upset about losing.

If anything, he was... intrigued.
###Chapter 28

Nathan Blackwood abruptly pushed back his chair and strode away from the table.

Tristan Whitmore sat frozen in shock, left alone to face the hostile glares from Evelyn Sinclair's friends.

The last thread of Tristan's composure snapped.

Under Isabella Montgomery's piercing gaze, he felt like prey cornered by predators.

"Did Nathan just abandon me?" Tristan whispered hoarsely. "I thought we were brothers?"

His fingers dug into the tablecloth as he faced the smirking crowd. "Can we... maybe forget this happened?"

The synchronized response came like a whip crack: "No!"

Outside the Velvet Lounge...

Evelyn slipped through the service entrance, the cool night air a relief after the stifling bar. She'd already texted Alexander Sterling - his driver would arrive shortly. Another message had gone to Isabella.

"Evelyn."

Nathan's deep voice startled her. She turned to find his broad-shouldered silhouette blocking the dim alley light. Her momentary surprise hardened into icy composure.

Noticing her defensive posture, Nathan's gaze darkened.

"What do you want, Mr. Blackwood?"

The flickering neon sign cast long shadows between them. When Nathan stepped forward, Evelyn retreated, maintaining careful distance.

Nathan stubbed out his cigarette with a humorless chuckle. "Sophia provoked you at the restaurant," he said, closing the gap. "I'll make her apologize."

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "Save your family's empty apologies. That restaurant incident was merely the latest in a long line of offenses." Her eyes glittered with frost. "I'm done collecting your family's regrets."

Nathan opened his mouth to respond when a shrill scream shattered the night.

A completely nude Tristan came barreling through the door, hands cupped over his privates. "You'll pay for this!" he shrieked, voice cracking with humiliation.

Then he skidded to a stop, face draining of color as he registered Nathan and Evelyn watching him.

Tristan's entire body trembled as he pointed a shaky finger at Evelyn. "Y-you took photos?!" His voice broke on a sob.

Evelyn examined her phone screen with satisfaction. The perfectly framed shot captured every humiliating detail. "Such an... impressive performance deserved documentation, Mr. Whitmore." Her crimson lips curved. "I knew you'd slink out this way like the coward you are."

Tristan's mouth worked soundlessly, his bare skin flushing scarlet under the alley's harsh lights.

"Cross me again," Evelyn said, voice dropping to a dangerous purr, "and this goes viral."

Did he really think she was still that naive girl from three years ago?

As Evelyn turned, Alexander's chauffeur materialized at the curb. The uniformed man bowed respectfully, holding the car door open.

Without sparing Nathan another glance, Evelyn slid into the Sterling family limousine. Only when the taillights disappeared did Nathan finally look away.

Something unsettled him about Evelyn's reaction to Tristan's naked display - not a flicker of embarrassment, just cool amusement.

Tonight had rewritten everything Nathan thought he knew about his ex-wife. From her breathtaking violin performance to the ruthless poker game, the docile woman he'd married had vanished. Now she moved like a phantom wrapped in mist, impossible to grasp.

The realization left him strangely agitated.

Nathan tossed his jacket at Tristan's head. "Cover yourself," he snapped. "You're embarrassing us both."
###Chapter 29

Tristan jolted in shock, grabbing Nathan's jacket to cover his face as he scrambled toward the car. "Get in! Damn it! Your ex-wife absolutely destroyed me today!"

Once inside, Tristan hastily dressed while muttering under his breath. "Your ex is a total femme fatale. Ruthless. Heartless. I never stood a chance."

Nathan's expression darkened at his words. With slender fingers, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it. The smoke curled around him, casting shadows over his unreadable gaze.

Outside, Evelyn and Natalie followed Sebastian out of the Velvet Lounge. Their smug smiles widened when they spotted the two men in the car.

Sebastian sauntered forward, leaning casually against the window. His lips curved into a playful smirk. "Mr. Whitmore, it was just a friendly bet. No hard feelings, right? We're still pals?"

Tristan trembled with fury. "Easy for you to say! You weren't the one running around naked! My reputation is ruined—I'll be the laughingstock of the city!" He groaned, burying his face in his hands. "But I brought this on myself. No one to blame but me."

Earlier, when Tristan had hesitated to strip, Sebastian had given him a cold, assessing look. "If Evelyn had lost, would you have let her walk away?"

The answer was obvious.

So Tristan had been stripped bare. Now, he refused to even look at Sebastian, turning his head away with a haughty huff.

Nathan's sharp gaze locked onto Sebastian. His voice was dangerously low. "Mr. Hart, are you settling a score for Evelyn today?"

Sebastian chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood, you can't be serious. Evelyn won fair and square. A man of your stature shouldn't be a sore loser." He tapped the window lightly, then smirked. "You didn't expect her to win, did you? Three years of marriage, and you still don't know her at all. To you, she was always worthless." His grin turned devious. "But don't worry—you won't need to know her anymore. To us, she'll always be extraordinary."

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Mr. Hart, you're not seriously interested in her, are you?"

Sebastian laughed openly. "Absolutely. I plan to pursue her. And I should thank you—if you hadn't let her go, I wouldn't have this opportunity."

Nathan's jaw tightened. He turned away, his face unreadable.

Tristan, unable to take another second, snapped, "Enough talking! Just drive, Nathan!"

Nathan slammed on the gas, speeding away. Tristan shot him a sideways glance. "You're pissed, aren't you? What's the big deal? So Sebastian likes Evelyn—why does that bother you?"

Nathan ignored him. "Worry about your own scandal. Those photos are going viral."

Tristan groaned. "This is the second time she's humiliated me! Why did you even marry her? There are plenty of women out there—why her?" He shook his head. "We all pitied you. Thank God we never treated her like one of us."

The car screeched to a halt. Nathan's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. His chest tightened uncomfortably.

They never treated her as one of us?

"Get out," Nathan ordered, his voice icy.

Tristan blinked. "What? Why?"

"I'm going to the office. You're in the way."

Grumbling, Tristan stepped out. As he stood in the cold wind, watching the car disappear, he realized Nathan wasn't heading toward his office at all.

Meanwhile, Isabella strutted over, triumphant. "Tristan Whitmore finally got what he deserved. That man doesn’t learn until he’s flat on his back."

Natalie nodded. "If we didn’t put him in his place, he’d keep thinking Evelyn was weak."

Isabella frowned. "But when did Evelyn get so good at poker dice?"

Natalie and Sebastian exchanged amused glances. Natalie grinned. "When she was studying in France, she had a falling-out with her family. They cut her off, and she ended up working undercover at a high-stakes underground casino."

Isabella's eyes widened. "No way."

Natalie nodded. "She learned everything under the table—and made a fortune. When William found out, he panicked and begged her to quit. Compensated her with an unlimited black card."

Isabella whistled. "Damn. I should’ve gone to school with her."
###Chapter 30

Dawn broke with golden fingers stretching across the sky.

Evelyn Sinclair stirred beneath silk sheets, blinking awake in the sun-drenched bedroom of Sterling Manor. The warmth enveloped her like a cashmere embrace, coaxing a contented smile to her lips.

Precisely at seven, three gentle raps sounded at her door.

"Miss Sinclair?" A maid's voice floated through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Evelyn stretched luxuriously. "Come in."

The previous night, Alexander's chauffeur had whisked her back to the family estate after the Velvet Lounge incident.

Two uniformed maids entered pushing a gleaming chrome rack laden with garments. "Your father and eldest brother await you in the breakfast room, Miss. These were specially curated for you."

Evelyn's breath caught. William Sterling had clearly gone overboard - again. "He didn't buy out entire design houses, did he?"

Rows of identical silhouettes in varying hues hung before her. Though devoid of labels, Evelyn recognized the exquisite stitching and Italian fabrics of Prada's haute couture collection. Several pieces weren't even available in boutiques yet.

She exhaled sharply. Time to readjust to this gilded existence. "You may go."

After her morning routine, Evelyn selected a tailored navy shift dress and paired it with pearl earrings before heading downstairs.

In the sunlit breakfast room, William and Alexander Sterling sat conversing over steaming coffee. Her father's face lit up. "There's my sleeping beauty!"

Alexander's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Heard Tristan Whitmore made quite the spectacle fleeing Velvet Lounge last night. Even with his face covered, everyone recognized him."

William snorted. "Old Man Whitmore dragged him home at dawn. Their PR team's working overtime after the stock plummeted." He beamed at Evelyn. "That's my girl."

Evelyn took her seat with an elegant shrug. "He started it." She accepted a bowl of berries from a server. "Though I might've finished it."

"Whatever my princess wants," William chuckled, pushing a fresh croissant toward her.

After breakfast, Alexander dropped Evelyn at Sterling Corp headquarters. Her assistant Bennett stood waiting outside her office door.

"Ms. Sinclair, Olivia Kensington arrived early. She's inside." He lowered his voice. "Any word from Kingsley Tech?"

"I've spoken with Dominic Kingsley personally. He suggested dinner negotiations."

"Shall I arrange it?"

Evelyn nodded before pushing open her office door - and froze.

Olivia Kensington lounged in Evelyn's ergonomic chair, spinning lazily while examining her manicure. The atmosphere turned glacial the moment their eyes met.

Olivia sprang up, shooting Bennett a venomous look. "You didn't announce her!"

Evelyn glided forward, lips curved in a dangerous smile. "Since you're so fond of that chair, Ms. Kensington, it's yours. Bennett, have it delivered to her office."

Olivia's cheeks flushed crimson. "That's not necessary-"

"I insist." Evelyn settled on the sofa, crossing her legs. "I have... particular tastes regarding personal space."

The unspoken insult hung between them. Olivia's eyes flashed with barely contained rage before she forced a smile. That gold-digging bitch thinks she's so superior just because she slept her way to the top.

Evelyn arched a brow. "To what do I owe this... unexpected visit?"

Olivia slapped a folder onto the coffee table. "Consider this a professional courtesy. Kensington Group's chairman wants to discuss the Pacific Heights project over dinner tonight." Her smile turned saccharine. "Don't say I never share."

Evelyn skimmed the proposal before snapping it shut. Olivia's sudden generosity reeked of deception - but playing along might prove entertaining.

"Will you be joining us?"

"Of course. I'll make introductions."

"How... thoughtful." Evelyn handed the documents to Bennett. "Increase our bid by thirty percent."

Without hesitation, Bennett nodded. "Immediately, ma'am."

The door burst open as Isabella Montgomery staggered in, arms overflowing with blood-red roses. "Evelyn! Rescue me!"

Evelyn blinked at the floral avalanche. "What on earth-"

"Someone's clearly smitten," Isabella sing-songed, peering over the blossoms with a mischievous grin. "And I do mean smitten."
###Chapter 31

Evelyn Sinclair rubbed her temples, clearly annoyed.

Isabella Montgomery burst into laughter. "Who on earth would be foolish enough to send you flowers?"

"Sebastian Hart, obviously," Evelyn replied dryly. "He made sure they were delivered directly to me."

"Sebastian?" Isabella smirked. "That man certainly knows how to make an impression."

She leaned in conspiratorially. "Old Master Hart shipped Julian off to study abroad. Rumor has it if he fails this time, his grandfather will break his legs."

Evelyn sighed. "What a shame we didn’t get to say goodbye. I suppose we’ll just have to throw him a grand welcome-back party when he returns."

With a wave of her hand, Evelyn summoned her assistant to remove the flowers from her office. The overpowering floral scent was giving her a headache.

Isabella nodded in agreement. "Good call. By the way, I looked into Kensington Group like you asked."

Evelyn lifted an eyebrow, waiting.

Isabella grinned. "Kensington Group is nothing but a hollow shell. They’re drowning in debt, begging for loans everywhere. The bank’s about to auction them off, and all they have left are worthless projects. Olivia Kensington is clearly trying to set you up."

This confirmed Evelyn’s suspicions. A slow smirk curved her lips. "So she’s digging a pit for me to fall into? Tonight’s dinner just got a lot more interesting."

"Thanks," she added.

Isabella shrugged. "Don’t mention it. But… I won’t be able to work with you anymore. My mother’s returning from Hong Kong. She just acquired a new cosmetics company and promised me a role in R&D."

She hesitated. "You know this has always been my dream."

Isabella’s mother was a powerhouse in the industry, always pushing her toward management. But Isabella had always preferred the lab. Now that she finally had the chance to pursue research, she wasn’t about to let it slip away.

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Then I wish our brilliant Miss Montgomery all the success in the world."

The two shared a knowing look. No further words were needed—their friendship had always been built on unspoken understanding.

"Just be careful," Isabella warned. "If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask. We’ve got your back."

Evelyn nodded. "Don’t worry. I won’t be a stranger."

After a few more minutes of chatter, Isabella grabbed her purse and slipped out. Evelyn turned her attention back to work.

As evening approached, she rose from her desk, intending to brief Bennett about the dinner. But before she could, Olivia Kensington sauntered into her office.

"Since it’s a private dinner, there’s no need to bring your assistant, right?" Olivia purred.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Fine."

Bennett shot her a concerned glance, but Evelyn gave him a reassuring smile.

At the private club, they were ushered into an elegant dining room. Olivia greeted a portly middle-aged man with an overly familiar cheek kiss that made Evelyn’s stomach turn.

Forcing politeness, Evelyn approached.

"Chairman Zeller," Olivia introduced, "this is Vice President Evelyn Sinclair."

The man’s eyes gleamed with undisguised lust as he took her in. "Ah, Vice President Sinclair. I’ve heard so much about you. You’re even more stunning in person."

He extended a hand. Evelyn barely nodded before taking her seat.

"Mr. Zeller, you flatter me," she said coolly.

Olivia gave her a pointed look. "Vice President Sinclair, since you’re new to Sterling Corporation, you might not know we have a strong relationship with Kensington Group. There shouldn’t be any issues with this partnership."

She gestured toward the contract. "Why don’t you present it to Mr. Zeller? If everything’s in order, we can sign tonight."

Evelyn paused, then slowly withdrew the document. "Of course. Mr. Zeller, I suggest you review it carefully."

The man took the contract, barely skimming it—as if he already knew its contents. But when his eyes landed on a specific figure, his face darkened.

"Vice President Sinclair," he growled, "why is the commission thirty percent higher than agreed?"

Olivia stiffened, snatching the contract. Her expression twisted in shock. "Who changed this?"

"Me," Evelyn said smoothly. "Since I’m overseeing this project, I have final say. We proceed at this rate—or not at all."

Everyone knew a thirty percent hike would cost Kensington Group millions more—an impossible demand for a failing company on the brink of collapse.

Olivia’s face flushed with rage. "Evelyn, you can’t just alter terms like this!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "As Sterling Corporation’s Vice President, I absolutely can. Ms. Kensington, I’m acting in our company’s best interest. Shouldn’t you be pleased?"

Her gaze sharpened. "Unless… you’re more loyal to Kensington Group than to Sterling?"

Olivia paled. "I—I’m Sterling’s employee! But business is built on trust! We had an agreement!"

Evelyn leaned back, unimpressed. "Nothing’s signed yet. Everything’s negotiable."

She turned to Chairman Zeller, her smile razor-sharp. "Unless… you and Ms. Kensington have already made private arrangements?"
###Chapter 32

Both Victor Kensington and Olivia Kensington visibly stiffened when Evelyn Sinclair spoke.

Victor's lips curled into a predatory grin as he reached for the bottle of Merlot beside him, pouring a generous glass for Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair," he purred, sliding a folder across the table. "Since we're negotiating, I've come prepared with an offer. Take a look."

His contract mirrored the one in Evelyn's hands—except the numbers were slashed by another ten percent.

Olivia's eyes gleamed with calculation as she leaned in. "Evelyn, what's the point of clinging to Alexander Sterling? He's clearly setting you up for failure."

Her painted lips twisted into a smirk. "Look at you—no designer labels, no car. Do you even own anything that isn't from a thrift store?"

She flicked the hem of her Chanel blazer, satisfaction oozing from every pore. "Trust me, I've been where you are. Victor treats his allies well. That Audi outside? Consider it yours."

When Evelyn remained silent, Olivia mistook it for hesitation. With a triumphant glance at Victor, she wobbled to her feet. "I'll give you two some privacy."

The moment the door clicked shut, Olivia's demeanor shifted. Her eyes turned razor-sharp as she cornered a trembling waiter near the restrooms.

"Is it done?"

The server swallowed hard. "Y-yes, Ms. Kensington. The drug's in the wine."

A cruel smile twisted Olivia's lips.

The waiter hesitated. "That woman... she's Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife. Isn't this dangerous?"

Olivia scoffed. "Please. She's just another gold-digger trading beds for promotions. Why should Nathan care?"

She strutted away without noticing the towering figure frozen in the shadows.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his phone. He grabbed a passing server by the collar.

"Where. Is. She?"

The man paled. "R-room 3888, Mr. Blackwood!"

Inside the private suite, Victor's sausage-like fingers inched toward Evelyn's wrist.

She swirled her wineglass with deliberate slowness, watching the ruby liquid catch the light.

Victor tossed a tarnished key onto the table. "For you, darling."

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "Olivia got a newer model, didn't she?"

"Ah, but you're far more... valuable." His gaze crawled over her like a physical touch. "Sign my contract, and I'll upgrade you to this year's model."

Evelyn's phone "accidentally" clattered to the floor.

As Victor bent to retrieve it, she switched their glasses.

"To new partnerships," he toasted, gulping the drugged wine.

Evelyn merely wet her lips, the dark vintage staining them like blood.

Victor's pupils dilated as the drug took effect. He fumbled for her hand—

A bone-crunching kick sent him sprawling.

Nathan's grip on Evelyn's wrist was vise-like. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper:

"Tell me you didn't drink that."
###Chapter 33 Mercy for the Worthless

The strikingly handsome man with his towering frame now stood before Evelyn Sinclair.

It was Nathan Blackwood, the man who had once held her heart captive for three long years.

Her breath hitched for a fleeting second before she schooled her features into perfect composure.

Why was he here? Pure coincidence, no doubt.

Evelyn wasn't vain enough to imagine Nathan had been tracking her every move like some obsessed guardian angel.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Flint Zeller scrambled to his feet, his entire body trembling with fear.

Nathan's expression darkened like a gathering storm. "Seeking death, are you? I'd be happy to oblige."

An inexplicable fury burned in his chest. His piercing gaze could have frozen hell itself.

Just as Nathan moved to teach Flint a brutal lesson, another figure materialized from the shadows.

Sebastian Hart delivered a vicious kick that sent Flint crashing back to the floor. His fists rained down mercilessly on the cowering man's face and body.

"Sebastian!" Evelyn's sharp voice cut through the violence.

The attacker paused mid-strike, his cold eyes instantly warming when they landed on her. "I went to your office first. When they said you were here, I thought I'd surprise you."

Sebastian strode toward Evelyn as if the violent outburst never happened, completely ignoring Nathan's presence. He retrieved a bouquet from near the door and presented it with a flourish.

"Do you like them?"

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. Though her plans had been disrupted, she'd still achieved her objective. "Thank you, but leave him be. Unless you want murder charges."

"As my queen commands." Sebastian smirked, then turned back to Flint. "Consider your worthless life spared."

Flint's terrified gaze darted between the two powerful men - Second Young Master Hart and Nathan Blackwood. Both were forces he couldn't hope to challenge.

Hadn't the rumors claimed Nathan had discarded Evelyn? Why was he interfering now?

The moment he heard he'd be spared, Flint scrambled toward the exit despite his dizziness.

Before he could escape, something metallic clattered against his skull before hitting the floor - the Audi keys.

Sebastian's voice dripped with contempt. "Take your trash with you. Don't offend my girlfriend's eyes."

"Yes! Yes, of course!" Flint grabbed the keys and fled like a rat escaping a sinking ship.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Girlfriend? Watch your mouth."

Her gaze flickered to Nathan, who was watching her with an inscrutable, intense stare.

"Mr. Blackwood, to what do we owe this unexpected visit?"

"Yes, I'm equally curious," Sebastian added, his tone laced with challenge.

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice was deceptively calm, "didn't you realize the wine was compromised? Is this the life you choose now - attending shady business dinners?"

The mocking edge in his words was unmistakable.

Accompanying men to dinners. Nearly being drugged. Was this her grand new life after their divorce?

Somehow, the thought made his blood boil.

Evelyn lowered her head with a bitter chuckle. How foolish to think he'd come to help her. He only wanted another opportunity to lecture her.

When she looked up, her expertly lined eyes glittered with defiance.

Under Nathan's stunned gaze, she picked up the wine glass and drained it in one go. Setting it down with deliberate calm, she rose gracefully.

"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Blackwood. I took precautions with the wine. But you lost the right to comment on my life choices the day you walked away."

Who did he think he was?

As she moved to leave, Nathan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist like a steel manacle. "What do you mean? You didn't answer my question."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "I was being polite, Mr. Blackwood. I came here for business - a far cry from being your family's glorified servant. Tell me, what's the difference between your precious Blackwoods and scum like Flint Zeller?"
###Chapter 34 Just Like a Sister to Me

Evelyn Sinclair curled her lips in disdain, refusing to even glance at Nathan Blackwood again. She snatched up her phone and designer handbag, storming out in her stiletto heels with a defiant sway of her hips.

Sebastian Hart arched an eyebrow, immediately trailing after her like a loyal shadow.

Nathan stood frozen, his piercing gaze as cold as Arctic ice. Evelyn's words had lodged in his chest like shards of glass, each syllable twisting deeper.

"A lowly servant to my family?" His jaw clenched. "Since when did Mrs. Blackwood become a servant?"

Clearly, there were too many things Nathan didn't understand about his own marriage.

As Evelyn pushed through the exit, she spotted a flushed Olivia Kensington clinging to Victor Kensington near the entrance.

"So she knew all along and came prepared," Evelyn mused, lips quirking. "Then was my earlier intervention unnecessary? How amusing."

Sliding into her waiting car, Evelyn exhaled sharply. Nathan's accusations had cut deeper than she'd admit. Three years of marriage, and he still didn't know who she truly was.

Within moments, she schooled her features into perfect composure. No cracks. No weakness.

She'd promised herself no second chances. Nathan Blackwood belonged firmly in her past.

Sebastian hummed a jaunty tune as he slid into the passenger seat. "Saved your pretty neck today, darling. How shall you repay me? Cash transfer? Or perhaps..." His smirk widened. "I'd much prefer you pledge yourself to me."

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. "In your dreams, Hart."

"Why not give me a chance?" he pouted dramatically.

"You're like a sister to me," Evelyn deadpanned.

Sebastian's lips twitched. "I'll prove I'm the perfect match for you."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at his unshakable confidence. "Whatever you say, Sebastian." After all, the notorious playboy's infatuations rarely lasted a month.

Yet as he watched her smile, something tightened in Sebastian's chest. This time, he wouldn't let opportunity slip through his fingers.

Back at her penthouse, Isabella Montgomery's excited call came through immediately.

Evelyn recounted the evening's events, glossing over Nathan's appearance with practiced ease.

"That Olivia Kensington belongs in a brothel, not a boardroom," Isabella scoffed. "Wasted talent in corporate life when she's clearly born to pimp."

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "I can't dismiss her yet. She's competent, just morally bankrupt. Keeping her around as my personal jester amuses me - as long as she behaves."

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at her corner office to find her chair replaced with a plush new model. Bennett's efficiency pleased her as she brewed her customary espresso.

The door slammed open without warning.

"Are you sabotaging me, Sinclair?" Olivia stormed in, fury radiating from every pore. The barely concealed love bites on her neck testified to Victor Kensington's... eccentric tastes.

After last night's humiliation, Olivia had pieced together Evelyn's scheme. Why else would Victor refuse such an obvious offering?

Evelyn waved Bennett away, then fixed Olivia with an amused smirk that instantly deflated the other woman's bravado.

"Just sign the damn contract," Olivia muttered, tossing the documents onto the desk.

Without looking up, Evelyn tapped her phone screen. The room filled with crystal-clear audio from last night's disastrous dinner.
###Chapter 35

Evelyn Sinclair's face drained of color, her fingers tightening around the edge of the desk.

Olivia Kensington smirked. "Evelyn, if I release this recording, Sterling Corp will audit every project you've ever handled. You won't just lose your job—you'll be blacklisted. Maybe even prosecuted. Is Kensington Group really worth destroying your career over?"

Olivia would never sacrifice herself for them.

Panic flickered in Olivia's eyes as she swallowed hard. "V-Vice President Sinclair, I spoke out of turn earlier. Kensington Group isn't even worth our time—their financials are a house of cards."

Evelyn gave a satisfied nod. "Good. Never mention them again. You're talented, Olivia. Use that talent for Sterling Corp, not some sinking ship."

"Yes, Vice President Sinclair." Olivia stiffened, her pride wounded but her survival instinct stronger.

With that handled, Evelyn turned her attention to Kingsley Tech's proposal. Securing this deal was critical—aside from Nathan Blackwood's empire, no other firm had the resources to outbid Sterling Corp.

A quick investigation confirmed Blackwood Enterprises had no interest in AI development. Victory was within reach.

As dusk painted the sky in deep purples, Bennett entered with a stack of files. "Ms. Sinclair, Kingsley Tech's dinner has evolved into a full gala. They're announcing their partnership at their anniversary celebration. We've received a VIP invitation. Should I arrange a preliminary meeting?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "They're playing hard to get because they know everyone's desperate for a piece. No need to grovel. Our offer speaks for itself."

Bennett nodded. "Understood. Shall I call your driver?"

Evelyn checked the time—later than she'd realized. Just as she reached for her coat, a knock interrupted.

Sebastian Hart leaned against the doorframe, his smirk devilishly charming. "Ms. Sinclair, care to let me buy you dinner?"

Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile. "Only if you're paying, Mr. Hart."

Bennett discreetly excused himself.

Sebastian, ever the gentleman, helped her into her coat and scooped up her purse. "Finally, some alone time. I made sure Julian wouldn't interrupt us tonight."

Evelyn rolled her eyes—Sebastian's reputation as a playboy preceded him. "I'm starving. Where are we going?"

"There's this new place in SoHo—"

Evelyn shot him a warning look.

"—that I just invested in," he amended smoothly. "Thought we could test the menu."

She strode ahead in her stilettos, Sebastian trailing with that infuriatingly confident grin.

The restaurant occupied the penthouse, offering a breathtaking panorama of Manhattan's glittering skyline. Soft jazz played as couples swayed on the dance floor, bathed in the warm glow of crystal chandeliers.

For the first time all day, Evelyn relaxed. The melody was one of her favorites, stirring something deep inside. She closed her eyes, breathing in—

A delicate floral scent interrupted her reverie.

She opened her eyes to find Sebastian holding out an exquisite bouquet. "Swiss lilies. Flown in this morning."

Music and flowers—the classic lovers' restaurant playbook. But Evelyn felt no flutter in her chest. She accepted them with a polite smile and set them aside. "Charming ambiance. You've outdone yourself."

Sebastian's grin faltered. Did she really think this was standard service? That bouquet cost more than most people's rent.

But he exhaled, shaking his head. Patience.

When their food arrived, Evelyn focused entirely on the meal, savoring each bite.

Sebastian enthusiastically described each dish's origins, the atmosphere surprisingly pleasant despite his usual theatrics.

"Did you like the flowers I sent to your office?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin. "Mmm. Thank you."

His jaw tightened. "That's it? Aren't you curious why I sent them?"

She blinked. "Should I be?"

"I'm courting you, Evelyn." Irritation crept into his voice.

A beat of silence. Then she set down her fork. "Sebastian, don't waste your time."

His glass hit the table with a sharp clink. "That's it? No consideration? No 'let's talk about this'?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "We're friends. Let's keep it that way."

Sebastian leaned forward, suddenly serious. "Not anymore. Starting tonight, I'm your suitor."

She sighed. "Then maybe we shouldn't see each other."

Across the room, Tristan Whitmore snorted into his drink. "Look at Hart making a fool of himself over Sinclair. What does he even see in her?"

Nathan Blackwood said nothing, his expression unreadable as he stared at his untouched plate. The filet mignon suddenly tasted like ash.
###Chapter 36

The newly opened Valentine's Bistro sat directly above Tristan Whitmore's restaurant. It had become the talk of the town, so Tristan insisted on checking it out personally—dragging Nathan Blackwood along with him.

The waiter repeatedly emphasized that this was a couples-only establishment.

Tristan smirked at Nathan and playfully tugged at his sleeve. "Don't we make a convincing pair?"

"Blackwood, Whitmore—what a coincidence."

A man and woman approached their table. Gregory Thornton looked every inch the polished aristocrat, while the woman clinging to his arm was a rising social media star with delicate, doll-like features.

Tristan scoffed under his breath. "What are you doing here?"

"Lily insisted this place was charming," Gregory said with a knowing grin. "Though I didn’t realize it was exclusively for couples." He barely suppressed a laugh.

They had all grown up together, so formalities were unnecessary. Nathan shot Tristan a glare, his jaw tightening.

Gregory found the situation amusing—Nathan was rarely caught off guard. Without waiting for an invitation, he pulled out a chair, seating his date across from Nathan. Lily’s eyes lingered on Nathan’s striking features, her pulse quickening, though she dared not speak a word with Gregory watching.

"Hey, Blackwood," Gregory drawled, tilting his chin toward the dance floor. "Isn’t that your scheming ex?"

The music shifted to something slow and dreamy. Sebastian Hart guided Evelyn Sinclair onto the floor, murmuring, "Just one dance. Since we’re here, why not enjoy the atmosphere?"

Before Evelyn could protest, the melody swelled, making a refusal impossible. Fine. It’s just a dance. The rhythm picked up, and after a brief misstep, they fell into perfect sync, their movements fluid and mesmerizing. The surrounding couples paused to watch—the man devastatingly handsome, the woman radiant, her dress swirling like liquid silver.

As the song ended, Sebastian caught sight of a familiar figure in the shadows. In one swift motion, he spun Evelyn into his arms, shielding her from view, and dipped her low—creating the illusion of a passionate kiss.

The restaurant erupted in applause.

Before Evelyn could react, Sebastian chuckled and whisked her outside.

In the corner, Nathan’s expression darkened.

Tristan watched the departing pair with a derisive snort. "Overrated. Sure, they danced well, but it’s not like they’re professionals." He’d never admit Evelyn had talent. "That gold-digger moved on fast, didn’t she?"

Nathan’s gaze snapped to Gregory. "Scheming ex? Is that what you call her?"

Gregory shrugged. "What else? She trapped you for your money. We were all relieved when you divorced her."

Nathan’s knuckles whitened around his glass.

Unaware, Gregory continued, "Remember that night we got wasted after your wedding? She called at 2 AM, demanding to know where you were. I told her to back off—marrying you was privilege enough for someone like her."

A glass slammed onto the table. The laughter died instantly.

Tristan blinked. Nathan was furious—over her?

Gregory faltered. Everyone knew Nathan had despised that marriage.

Lily trembled, realizing she’d misjudged the dynamics entirely.

"Blackwood—" Gregory looked to Tristan for help.

Before Tristan could speak, Nathan leaned forward, his voice lethally calm. "Gregory, since you’re so invested in my affairs, why don’t you run the Blackwood family?"
###Chapter 37 The Gala Encounter

Nathan Blackwood rose abruptly from his seat, his stormy expression sending a clear message. Gregory Thornton remained frozen in place, his face drained of color.

Tristan Whitmore hurried after his friend. "This must be about Evelyn again," he muttered under his breath. "That woman causes nothing but trouble."

"Blackwood, what's gotten into you?" Tristan caught up to Nathan outside. "We've been friends for years. You know Greg speaks without thinking. Don't take his words to heart."

Nathan exhaled sharply, realizing he'd overreacted. The cold night air helped clear his turbulent thoughts. He lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the darkness. "It's not about him. I'm just... frustrated with myself."

Tristan studied his friend's tense profile. "You're not still hung up on her, are you?"

Nathan shot him a withering glance, refusing to dignify the question. "Your steakhouse could learn a thing or two from this new place. Maybe consider closing shop."

"You bastard!" Tristan's face flushed crimson. "Some friend you are!"

Meanwhile, inside the glittering ballroom of the Kingsley Tech anniversary gala, New York's elite mingled beneath crystal chandeliers. Evelyn Sinclair moved through the crowd with practiced ease, her mind focused on the potential AI partnership that could propel Sterling Corporation into new territory.

A sudden hush fell over the room as all eyes turned toward the entrance. There stood Alexander Sterling, the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation, with his stunning companion. The woman beside him commanded attention - her wavy chestnut hair elegantly pinned up, her custom Laurent Dubois gown shimmering with genuine diamonds under the chandeliers.

"Isn't that Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife?" someone whispered. "What was he thinking, letting her go?"

Alexander raised his champagne flute with a proud smile. "Allow me to introduce our Vice President, Evelyn Sinclair."

"Vice President Sinclair is breathtaking!" a businessman exclaimed. "To hold such a position at Sterling Corporation at your age is remarkable!"

Evelyn maintained her poised smile as she gracefully accepted the compliments. Alexander leaned in discreetly. "Dominic Kingsley is waiting upstairs. Shall we?"

Nearby, Sophia Blackwood and her socialite friends watched the scene with barely concealed envy. Sophia's nails dug into her palms as she recognized the exclusive gown Evelyn wore - the same one she'd been denied weeks earlier.

"How is this possible?" Sophia seethed silently. The meek, mousy woman she remembered from family gatherings now carried herself like royalty. This confident, radiant version of Evelyn was unrecognizable.

Sophia burned with the urge to expose Evelyn, to remind everyone this was the same woman the Blackwoods had discarded. She longed to rip away that composed facade and reveal the pathetic creature beneath.
###Chapter 38

The girls fell silent under Sophia Blackwood's icy glare.

The second floor of the grand ballroom maintained an elegant hush. When Alexander Sterling escorted Evelyn Sinclair upstairs, a rakishly handsome man in a designer black shirt rose to greet them.

Their handshake was brief but firm. "Mr. Kingsley," Alexander smiled, "it's been too long."

Dominic Kingsley's lips curved into a charming grin. "Alexander Sterling. Always a pleasure."

Without waiting for formal introductions, Dominic's appreciative gaze settled on Evelyn. His admiration carried just the right balance - appreciative without being inappropriate.

"Ms. Sinclair," he said smoothly, "your reputation precedes you. I hope you'll forgive my last-minute change of plans from dinner to this gala."

Evelyn's smile was polished. "Not at all. Congratulations on Kingsley Tech's fifth anniversary. I look forward to many prosperous years of collaboration."

Her words carried deliberate double meaning.

Dominic's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Alexander, might I steal Ms. Sinclair for a private conversation? After all, she'll be my direct counterpart if we proceed."

"Of course." Alexander gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before descending to mingle with other guests.

Under the soft chandelier glow, the striking pair conversed by the balcony railing. Dominic swirled his merlot absently. "Tell me, Evelyn, what makes you so certain about this partnership?"

A loose curl escaped Evelyn's updo, framing her face as she met his gaze. "Mr. Kingsley, our offer speaks for itself. No other investor matches Sterling Corporation's terms." She leaned in slightly. "We have the capital, you have the technology. We're not looking for short-term gains - this is about shaping the next decade of AI development."

Her bold declaration made Dominic reassess the woman before him. The playful glint in his eyes gave way to genuine consideration. After a thoughtful pause, he asked, "Would you consider a three-way partnership?"

Evelyn's brow arched. "With whom?" She couldn't imagine a better fit than Sterling Corporation.

Dominic raised his glass toward the space behind her. The approaching footsteps made Evelyn's pulse stutter.

The air grew thick with tension as she turned, wine glass in hand. Her practiced smile froze when she locked eyes with the only man who could rival Sterling Corporation in this venture.

Nathan Blackwood.

Dressed in a tailored black suit with platinum cufflinks Evelyn recognized all too well, he exuded an aura of cool detachment. His gaze lingered on her just a beat too long before addressing Dominic.

"I see introductions aren't necessary," Dominic observed, eyes dancing between them. "Evelyn, I should have mentioned - regardless of our final partner, Blackwood Enterprises will be involved in this project."

At Evelyn's questioning look, Dominic chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood has been funding my research since day one as my angel investor."
###Chapter 39

Evelyn Sinclair's mind raced. So that's how it is... Nathan Blackwood had already secured his position as a shareholder. She hadn't anticipated he'd been eyeing the artificial intelligence sector for this long.

If Dominic Kingsley hadn't voluntarily shared this information, Evelyn would never have uncovered it. His willingness to disclose this detail demonstrated his genuine intent to collaborate with her.

Though Nathan's involvement soured her mood, Evelyn maintained professional clarity. She knew better than to let personal history interfere with business opportunities.

She blinked slowly, a calculated smile forming. "With Blackwood Industries' resources, you could easily monopolize this venture. Why involve a third party?"

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan, one eyebrow arching slightly.

"This is uncharted territory," Nathan's deep voice resonated through the room. A faint smirk played on his lips. "Even Blackwood Industries won't gamble alone. Partnering with Sterling Corporation through Kingsley Tech is a strategic move. I anticipate our collaboration will be... enlightening."

His elegant fingers lifted a champagne flute. Dominic mirrored the gesture, their glasses meeting with a crystalline chime. Both men turned expectantly toward Evelyn.

Trapped by circumstance, Evelyn forced a polite smile. Her glass touched theirs with hollow resonance. The deal was sealed.

Beneath her composed exterior, frustration simmered. Dominic, sensing tension, attempted diplomacy. "What better way to commemorate our partnership than having you two lead the anniversary gala's opening dance? It would make a powerful statement."

Nathan's brow furrowed. Evelyn laughed lightly, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "How unfortunate - I've two left feet." Without waiting for response, she turned sharply, ignoring Nathan's piercing glare.

Dominic shrugged. "One dance seems a small concession for such an important alliance." He chuckled awkwardly. "This doesn't bode well for smooth negotiations ahead."

Nathan's expression darkened as he watched Evelyn's retreating figure. "Can't dance?" he muttered. "Then what was that performance at Sebastian Hart's restaurant?"

Suddenly Gregory Thornton's words echoed in his mind. The anger dissipated, replaced by uncomfortable guilt. "I've wronged her profoundly," he admitted silently.

Downstairs, Evelyn maintained perfect poise until Alexander Sterling approached. "Successful negotiations?" he inquired, noting her lack of enthusiasm. "Dominic insisted on a three-way partnership. Nathan Blackwood's already a stakeholder," she explained flatly.

Understanding dawned on Alexander. He smoothed her hair affectionately. "Shared risk means shared reward. This arrangement benefits us more than you realize."

Evelyn's eyes widened. Nathan's caution mirrored Sterling Corporation's own concerns. The advantages did indeed outweigh the drawbacks.

Her mood lifted instantly. She looped her arm through Alexander's, resting her chin on his shoulder. "Thank you for the perspective, Alex. I'd have wasted days fuming otherwise."

Their affectionate exchange didn't escape notice. From the balcony, Nathan observed through narrowed eyes. Tristan Whitmore materialized beside him. "Interesting," Tristan mused. "Alexander Sterling's famously reserved with women. What makes this one so special? There must be history there."

Nathan turned away without response, descending to mingle with other guests as the ballroom buzzed with activity.

Dominic whispered instructions to the emcee, who soon announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, celebrating Kingsley Tech's fifth anniversary, we proudly announce our groundbreaking partnership with Blackwood Industries and Sterling Corporation! Please welcome Mr. Nathan Blackwood and Ms. Evelyn Sinclair for the opening dance!"

The crowd erupted in applause as spotlights searched for the reluctant dance partners.
###Chapter 40

Evelyn Sinclair froze when she heard her name announced. The last person she wanted to interact with was Nathan Blackwood, yet here she was, trapped in this impossible situation with every eye in the room fixed upon her.

The tension between them since their divorce made this unexpected collaboration even more electrifying.

Nathan hadn't anticipated this either. Without question, Dominic Kingsley had orchestrated this moment.

As Evelyn hesitated, Nathan strode toward her with effortless grace. His cool demeanor never faltered as he extended his hand in invitation, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

The entire ballroom held its breath.

Refusal wasn't an option - not when this three-way partnership hung in the balance. Alexander Sterling gave his sister an encouraging nod. With practiced poise, Evelyn placed her hand in Nathan's.

Guests parted like the Red Sea before them. Evelyn gathered her gown with her free hand, avoiding Nathan's eyes. His palm felt surprisingly cool against hers. In that moment, Nathan realized with startling clarity - during their entire three-year marriage, they'd never held hands like this. Not once.

Evelyn's fingers were delicate yet strong, like porcelain wrapped in silk. The warmth of her touch seared itself into his memory.

The orchestra struck up a lively waltz at precisely the right moment, filling the grand hall with sweeping melodies.

When Evelyn's hand came to rest on Nathan's shoulder, their eyes met briefly. His dark, intense stare seemed to peel back her carefully constructed layers. As his hand settled at the small of her back, Evelyn stiffened imperceptibly at the unfamiliar contact.

They'd never been this physically close during their marriage. The irony wasn't lost on her.

It took Evelyn mere seconds to regain her composure. Her practiced social mask slipped into place - the picture of polite indifference.

Their flawless footwork and regal bearing captivated the room as the music drowned out their private exchange.

"Didn't know you could dance," Nathan murmured, his deep voice laced with amusement.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "There's much you don't know about me." Her tone carried just enough bite.

Nathan's grip tightened fractionally as the tempo increased. The music swelled, pulling them closer together.

"Was this partnership your idea or Sterling Corporation's?" he pressed.

Evelyn executed a flawless spin before returning to his arms. "Some mysteries are better left unsolved," she countered with a mocking smile.

For three years, he'd never bothered to truly see her. Why start now?

To Nathan, Evelyn had been merely a background character in his life's story. For Evelyn, their marriage had been a masterclass in disappointment.

Spotlights illuminated the striking pair. Nathan cut his usual dashing figure - tall, commanding, effortlessly elegant. Evelyn's gown shimmered with each graceful movement, her beauty breathtaking. If one could pause time, they'd see dozens of guests subtly catching their breath.

Every eye followed their perfectly synchronized movements. To outsiders, they appeared the picture of harmony. Only they knew the truth.

Evelyn counted the measures, willing the song to end. Nathan's proximity set her nerves alight. His scrutinizing gaze burned hotter than the chandeliers above.

As the final notes approached, Nathan leaned in while Evelyn arched back in the dance's natural conclusion. Her slender neck curved gracefully, the picture of refinement.

Then Nathan broke protocol.

Instead of stepping away, he held his position. Their lips hovered mere centimeters apart - her soft pink against his firm line.

The music's last note hung suspended in the air, mirroring the electric tension between them. Time itself seemed to hold its breath.
###Chapter 41 Intentional Move

The chandeliers flickered overhead.

Evelyn Sinclair swirled her crystal glass of champagne absently.

She leaned against the second-floor balcony railing, observing the sea of socialites exchanging hollow pleasantries below.

Nathan Blackwood happened to glance up at that exact moment.

Their gazes collided - his dark and unreadable, hers cool and detached.

Evelyn quickly averted her eyes, ignoring the sudden flutter in her chest.

That unexpected kiss during their dance had sent shockwaves through the ballroom. Nobody cared who had actually misstepped - the crowd only craved drama between these ex-lovers.

Any reaction would fuel endless gossip.

So when their lips accidentally brushed, Evelyn had immediately turned away. The music ended mercifully quickly, allowing her to retreat with icy composure.

She'd walked off without a backward glance.

Across the room, Tristan Whitmore joked with Nathan's circle. After dispersing the group, he studied his friend's aristocratic profile.

"You messed up that turn on purpose, didn't you?" Tristan blurted out. Others might not notice, but he knew Evelyn's timing had been perfect. The mistake was Nathan's.

Nathan Blackwood, raised in elite circles and trained in every social grace since childhood, couldn't possibly misstep during a simple waltz. Unless...

Nathan's obsidian eyes flicked to Tristan. "No."

"Good. Don't even think about that woman." Tristan shook his head. "I must be going crazy to imagine such a thing. Clearly she planned the whole scene! That scheming-"

Nathan's sharp look silenced him. Tristan immediately swallowed his words, loyalty overriding suspicion.

Meanwhile on the balcony...

Alexander Sterling had been pulled into business discussions, leaving Evelyn to survey the glittering crowd alone.

A familiar figure waved from the grand entrance. Her lips curved into a genuine smile as she waved back.

Sebastian Hart strolled over with effortless charm, leaning against the railing with rakish confidence. "Dragged myself to this circus just for you."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Your father forced you, and we both know it."

Sebastian grinned, unrepentant. "You're always my true purpose."

Before Evelyn could respond, an unwelcome presence approached. Her smile vanished.

"Evelyn Sinclair, have you no shame?" Sophia Blackwood sneered, flanked by her sycophants. "Divorced from my brother yet still throwing yourself at him? Our family would never accept trash like you!"

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. Just my luck tonight - every unpleasant person deciding to make an appearance.

Sophia had clearly come to assert dominance after Evelyn stole the spotlight - first with her stunning gown, then with that accidental kiss that had everyone whispering about reconciliation.

As if. Evelyn thought dryly.

Sophia trembled with barely contained rage. If not for her Blackwood pedigree, she might have lunged at Evelyn right then. That dress should have been mine! That moment should have been mine! She stole everything!

Evelyn's gaze swept over Sophia's entourage - mostly reluctant followers dragged into this petty confrontation. How juvenile.

"Well, well," Sebastian drawled, eyeing Sophia with cold amusement. "Who let the rabid Pomeranian in?"

Sophia flushed crimson. "This doesn't concern you! Are you her latest plaything?"

Sebastian's grin widened. "I like the sound of that."

Evelyn shot him a warning look before turning to Sophia with icy calm. "What do you want, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia jutted her chin. "Don't play innocent! You kissed my brother on purpose! Thinking you can worm your way back into his life? Dream on!"
###Chapter 42

Sebastian Hart's expression turned utterly shocked.

He grasped the outrageous accusation immediately. Kiss your brother? What absolute nonsense.

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't some desperate fool who'd go after a worthless playboy.

"If you don't believe me, ask anyone present!" Sophia Blackwood insisted shrilly.

Her entourage gave hesitant nods, their eyes darting nervously between the parties.

Sebastian scoffed dismissively. "Why would I trust your little clique of conspirators? Do I look stupid to you?"

Sophia's face flushed crimson with rage. "It's true! Evelyn, too cowardly to admit it? My brother only cares about Vanessa Holloway."

She leaned forward venomously. "You were just a walking blood bag for her. Did you really think you could stay married into our family? We'd never accept trash like you!"

Vanessa's name had always been Evelyn's Achilles' heel - a wound Sophia delighted in reopening.

Yet Evelyn merely arched one perfect eyebrow, her lips curling into an icy smile. Her gaze swept over Sophia's cowering friends like a winter gale.

"The entire world knows about your brother's affair with Vanessa Holloway." Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "Your outburst only confirms his infidelity during our marriage. How... illuminating."

Sophia paled, then exploded. "You shameless gold-digger! Everything you're wearing, eating, living on - all paid for by your string of sugar daddies!"

Her shrill voice carried across the entire second floor, drawing shocked stares.

"Do they know you're no heiress? Just some penniless beggar who had to grovel to my brother for pocket money?" Sophia's laughter turned hysterical. "Our maids took vacations when you visited - because you'd do their work! Laundry, cooking, gardening - our personal live-in servant!"

She was panting now, drunk on her own cruelty. "My brother didn't marry a wife - he acquired free labor!"

"Sophia Blackwood!"

A voice like cracking ice cut through her tirade. Sophia spun to find Nathan Blackwood looming behind her, his face stormy.

"B-Brother?" Her bravado evaporated.

Nathan's presence seemed to suck all oxygen from the space. No one had noticed when he'd arrived, but now his fury was a tangible force.

Sophia recoiled, her face draining of color. The household staff had been strictly forbidden from discussing how they'd treated Evelyn. If Nathan discovered...

But no - what did it matter now? The divorce was final!

Drawing herself up, Sophia attempted damage control. "Brother, I was just putting this woman in her place. She tried to seduce—"

"Oh, spare us the act!" Sebastian interjected furiously. His hands clenched into fists. "Is this how the Blackwoods treated the woman we cherished?"

His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "You dare boast about such despicable behavior? It was Evelyn's misfortune to ever marry into your wretched family!"

Sebastian positioned himself protectively before Evelyn. Those three lost years of her life weren't fodder for public ridicule.

Sophia's eyes darted between them. "What's your relationship really? Were you two carrying on behind my brother's back?"

"Sophia! Enough!" Nathan's roar silenced the room.

Veins stood out on his forehead. His chest constricted painfully - whether from rage or something else, he couldn't tell.
###Chapter 43

Nathan Blackwood didn't even glance at Sophia's expression as he strode directly toward Evelyn Sinclair. His features were carved from ice.

"Was everything you just said true?" His jaw clenched so tight the words came out strained.

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. She worried her lower lip between her teeth, uncertainty flashing in her eyes.

She'd been raised by distant parents while her brother grew up overseas. When Nathan returned to New York, he became a business prodigy, multiplying the Blackwood fortune tenfold. This success had made Sophia unbearably arrogant.

"Answer me!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip when Evelyn hesitated.

A bitter laugh rang out behind him. He didn't need to turn to know it came from Evelyn.

"Mr. Blackwood, every word was true."

Gasps rippled through the crowd as Evelyn confirmed the accusations. The glittering socialites now regarded her with new eyes - beneath her polished exterior lay a past more tragic than any of them could imagine.

After hearing Sophia's revelations, their pity for Evelyn was palpable. The scandal following her divorce from Nathan suddenly made terrible sense.

Marrying into the Blackwood dynasty had clearly been no fairytale.

Nathan's body went rigid, his heart constricting painfully. Not only had his inner circle despised Evelyn, but his entire family had tormented her. And as her husband, he'd been oblivious.

During their three-year marriage, Nathan had rarely visited their home. Each appearance had been transactional - discussing Vanessa Holloway's health to coerce Evelyn into blood donations.

He'd leave her with polite small talk about finances before abandoning her with a black credit card. Nathan had actually believed he'd treated Evelyn decently. The realization of his self-deception hit him like a physical blow. The debt he owed her was immeasurable. Now, he couldn't even meet her gaze.

His fists balled until his knuckles whitened. Yet Evelyn merely laughed again - a melodic sound edged with frost.

"You could interrogate any staff member at Highland Estates to verify the truth, Mr. Blackwood. But what difference would it make now?" Her smile didn't reach her glacial eyes. "Your family's cruelty flourished because everyone assumed you approved."

Nathan was the guiltiest of all - he'd inflicted the deepest wounds. Under the chandelier's glow, Evelyn's beauty was lethal, her stare unforgiving. "If it's all true, what will you do? Force Sophia and Margaret to kneel in apology? Make them scrub my floors and cook my meals? Or will you just throw more money at your penniless ex-wife?"

The crowd murmured in shock. They'd expected tearful reconciliations, not this scorching indictment. Among elite circles, marrying for status rather than money was an unspoken rule - one nobody dared voice aloud.

This confrontation was spiraling dangerously out of control.

"Apologize? In your dreams!" Sophia's face flushed crimson. With so many witnesses, she'd never submit. "I'll never kneel to you! You're delusional!"

"Enough!" Nathan yanked Sophia back violently. She crashed into a marble column, tears springing to her eyes from the impact.

He didn't spare her a glance, his tormented gaze locked on Evelyn. He couldn't fulfill any of her demands except financial compensation - which she'd surely reject.

For the first time in his life, Nathan felt utterly powerless.

"Evelyn, I—"

"Save it, Mr. Blackwood." Her voice dripped acid. "If you can't act, don't pretend to feel guilty. Empty apologies are worthless. Are you fishing for sympathy now? How pathetic."
###Chapter 44

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled into a mocking smile as she fixed Sophia Blackwood with an icy stare. Her eyelids lowered slightly, the movement deliberate and controlled. "Ms. Blackwood," she said, her voice dripping with disdain, "do you truly believe humiliating me with these tired old stories reflects poorly on me? The shame belongs to your family - treating their daughter-in-law like a common servant."

She tilted her head, her gaze sharp as shattered glass. "Tell me, who in their right mind would marry into the Blackwood family now?"

"You were clearly trying to seduce my brother earlier!" Sophia spat, her face flushed with anger. The accusation hung between them, heavy and toxic.

Evelyn's laugh was light, almost musical, but her eyes remained cold. "Seduce Nathan Blackwood?" She shook her head slowly. "I have more self-respect than that."

The memory of that unexpected kiss at the end of their dance still burned in Evelyn's mind. She knew how it must have looked to the watching crowd - like she'd orchestrated the whole thing.

Her gaze flickered to Nathan, standing nearby. When their eyes met, her lips twisted into something bitter and knowing. "Three years ago, I was foolish enough to marry Mr. Blackwood. But I'm not that naive girl anymore." She squared her shoulders. "I'd seduce every man in this room before I'd ever look at Nathan Blackwood again."

Sophia recoiled slightly at the venom in Evelyn's words. This wasn't the meek, compliant woman she remembered. This Evelyn was someone entirely different - someone dangerous.

The sharp clink of Evelyn's wine glass being set down shattered the tense silence. Without another word, she turned on her heel and headed for the stairs, leaving the stunned crowd behind. Sebastian Hart shot Nathan and Sophia one last scathing look before following her.

Nathan stood frozen, his expression unreadable as he watched Evelyn walk away. Tristan Whitmore, sensing the need to diffuse the situation, quickly pulled Dominic Kingsley aside.

"Mr. Kingsley," Tristan said with forced cheerfulness, "about this three-way partnership - any chance we could expand it to four?"

Dominic adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "No."

Tristan sighed. "Couldn't you at least try to be diplomatic about it?"

"Apologies," Dominic replied smoothly. "But no."

By the time Tristan turned back, Nathan had disappeared. "Where'd he go?" Tristan muttered to himself. Dominic merely nodded toward the lower level before walking away.

Downstairs, the lounge was quieter, the tension from above not yet having filtered down. Sebastian hovered near Evelyn, his concern evident.

"Did Nathan do something to you?" he demanded. "Why was Sophia accusing you like that?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "It was nothing. Just a misunderstanding."

Sebastian clenched his fists. "If he hurt you, I swear—"

"Have you seen Alexander?" Evelyn interrupted, glancing around.

"He went to the VIP section with Chairman Kingsley," Sebastian said. "Want me to take you to him?"

Evelyn shook her head. Then she stiffened - Nathan was walking toward them.

"Not this again," she muttered under her breath. Without hesitation, she took Sebastian's arm and turned to leave.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice was low, intense. "We need to talk."

She didn't even break stride. "There's nothing to discuss."

An apology? Now? After everything? Evelyn knew better than to think words could undo the past. Some wounds never healed, no matter how many empty phrases you stuffed into them.

She kept walking, leaving Nathan standing alone in the middle of the room. Some things, once broken, could never be fixed. And Evelyn Sinclair was done trying.
###Chapter 45

Sebastian Hart smirked as he glanced sideways at Nathan Blackwood. His lips curled into a smug, reckless grin that seemed to mock Nathan's current predicament.

"Look at him! Even the great Nathan Blackwood has his off days," Sebastian taunted under his breath.

Tristan Whitmore finally caught up with Nathan, following his gaze to Evelyn Sinclair's retreating figure. "Tsk tsk, Blackwood," Tristan clucked his tongue. "Since the divorce is finalized, no point regretting it now. That woman was just playing cheap tricks anyway."

Nathan shot him a sidelong glare that could freeze hell. "Since when do I need your advice on how to handle my affairs?"

A sudden chill ran down Tristan's spine, silencing him immediately.

The way Evelyn had humiliated Nathan in front of everyone still burned in Tristan's memory. If he felt this furious just witnessing it, he couldn't imagine how Nathan must feel. Sure, Sophia might have gone too far with her words, but hadn't Evelyn brought this upon herself by begging to marry Nathan in the first place?

When Evelyn first entered the grand hall, she'd been immediately surrounded by eager socialites and businessmen - some drawn by her position at Sterling Corporation, others simply hungry for tonight's drama.

Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to expand her network and gather insider information, Evelyn gracefully engaged with each guest. She clinked champagne flutes with practiced ease, taking only polite sips as she worked the room. Nobody dared pressure her to drink more.

Even with Sebastian intercepting several drinks on her behalf, Evelyn still felt lightheaded after the networking session. Seizing a quiet moment, she slipped away to the ladies' room. The cold water against her flushed skin helped clear the fog in her head. Just as she reached for a paper towel, Evelyn heard Sophia Blackwood's shrill voice approaching from the hallway.

"That bitch Evelyn won't get away with this! Humiliating our family like that!" Sophia's heels clicked angrily against the marble floor. "Did you see how she was practically throwing herself at every man in there? As if sleeping her way to the top makes her some kind of empowered woman? She should look in the mirror - she'll always be that pathetic gold-digger we kicked out!"

Sophia and her entourage froze when they entered to find Evelyn leaning casually against the sink, arms crossed, a frosty smile playing on her lips.

Sophia recovered quickly, her face twisting into its usual sneer. "Ugh, my luck just keeps getting worse. Can't even use the bathroom without running into trash."

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "The feeling's mutual, I assure you."

Sophia's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up. "Who do you think you are to talk to me like that?"

Evelyn turned on the tap behind her with precise, fluid motion. The running water masked their conversation from potential eavesdroppers. "People might not know your true colors, Sophia, but do you really think you can rewrite history? You're still that spoiled brat who reeks of entitlement."

"You should be thanking your lucky stars I haven't exposed all your dirty little secrets," Evelyn continued, her voice glacial despite the deceptively soft curve of her lips. "Don't go looking for trouble you can't handle."

Sophia's face contorted with rage. "How dare you threaten me? I'm a Blackwood! You're nothing but discarded trash my brother threw away!"

Without Nathan present, Sophia's true colors shone bright. She'd always despised her sister-in-law, that ingrained sense of superiority boiling over now. How could this nobody Evelyn ever think she belonged in their world? What had she ever contributed to Nathan's career? What connections did her family offer?

For three years, Sophia had delighted in making Evelyn hand-wash her delicate garments, screaming when anything got "ruined." She'd refused to pour her own water, summoning Evelyn like a servant. If unsatisfied, she'd demand Evelyn redo everything.

Evelyn's silent endurance had only fed Sophia's cruelty, making her believe this treatment was justified - that Evelyn deserved to grovel.

Even after the divorce, Sophia remained convinced Evelyn would always be beneath her.

"Only in your delusional mind are the Blackwoods untouchable," Evelyn scoffed, her playful smile not reaching her cold eyes. "I'd love to know where you get that superiority complex."

Sophia barked a laugh. "Why didn't you say that when you were begging to marry my brother? Forgotten how desperate you were, Evelyn? Willing to be Vanessa's personal blood bank just to worm your way into our family? That's your glorious legacy!"

Evelyn's smile vanished, her expression turning dangerously calm.

"Not desperate, Sophia. Just blind." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "But if you want to revisit the past, I'll happily remind you of every detail."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "What could some broke nobody possibly have on me?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her clutch. "Try me."

Sophia opened her mouth to retort when suddenly— "AHHH!" Her piercing scream echoed through the bathroom.
###Chapter 46

Sophia Blackwood's face froze in shock.

A sharp scream escaped her lips as icy water cascaded down her face and designer gown. The sudden chill made her entire body tremble violently.

Evelyn Sinclair casually placed the crystal decanter back on the marble countertop, brushing her hands together with deliberate slowness. Her piercing gaze never wavered as she delivered her warning. "You brought this upon yourself."

"How dare you, Evelyn!"

Sophia's face flushed crimson with rage. Her trembling fingers clutched at the ruined fabric of her Dior gown - not couture like Evelyn's custom ensemble, but still worth a staggering eight figures. A dress most celebrities could only dream of wearing, now completely destroyed.

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Do you honestly believe I'll tolerate your nonsense like before?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Test me again, and I'll settle all our accounts - past and present."

A visible shudder ran through Sophia as she caught the glacial glint in Evelyn's eyes. For the first time, genuine fear prickled down her spine.

But pride quickly overrode fear. As the privileged Blackwood heiress accustomed to universal deference, being humiliated at this gala was unacceptable. Her spare dress couldn't compare to this ruined masterpiece.

Gritting her teeth, Sophia lunged forward with a raised hand. "You'll pay for this, Evelyn!"

The slap never landed. Evelyn moved with panther-like grace, effortlessly dodging while seizing Sophia's wrist. In one fluid motion, she tangled her free hand in Sophia's carefully styled waves and shoved her toward the overflowing golden sink.

Sophia's face plunged into the icy water as her entourage gasped in horror. One sharp glance from Evelyn silenced them instantly.

Though Sophia thrashed violently, Evelyn maintained perfect control. When the lesson had been sufficiently delivered, she released her grip and stepped back without a single drop marring her own impeccable appearance.

The contrast couldn't have been starker - Evelyn, radiant and composed; Sophia, dripping and disheveled like a drowned rat.

Gasping against the wall, Sophia stared at Evelyn with dawning realization. This wasn't the woman she thought she knew.

"Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly as Sophia's friend rushed to her side, "I warned you I wouldn't tolerate disrespect anymore." She tucked a stray lock behind her ear with deliberate elegance. "Consider this your final warning."

With one last contemptuous glance at the shivering Sophia, Evelyn turned on her designer heels and strode away, leaving only the echo of her confidence behind.

The moment Evelyn disappeared, Sophia's screams of frustration finally erupted.

Evelyn should have been savoring her victory. Instead, she froze mid-step when she saw Nathan Blackwood leaning against the corridor wall, watching her with an unreadable expression.

How long had he been standing there?

She considered pretending not to notice, but his deep voice stopped her. "Evelyn."

Nathan remained motionless, visibly uncomfortable yet resigned. He'd heard the altercation but hadn't intervened - not when his family owed her far greater reparations.

Evelyn turned slowly, arching one perfectly groomed eyebrow. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Without waiting for his response, she added with mocking sweetness, "Oh, but you've come too early. Your sister isn't... presentable enough for company just yet."
###Chapter 47

Alexander Sterling's expression was grim, but his eyes softened when Evelyn Sinclair approached him.

Evelyn flashed him a tired smile before looping her arm through his. "Is this dreadful event over yet? Can we please leave? I'm absolutely exhausted."

Alexander affectionately tapped her nose. "Of course we can leave. These people don't deserve another moment of your time."

Her eyes crinkled with genuine affection. "You're still the best brother anyone could ask for."

"Do you need to say goodbye to anyone?"

"I made my polite exits hours ago," Alexander replied, smoothing her hair. "The car's waiting outside."

Evelyn nodded, clinging to her brother's arm as they exited the gala. The striking pair - the powerful businessman and his elegant sister - drew admiring glances from everyone they passed.

Just as they reached the entrance, Sebastian Hart hurried after them. "Mr. Sterling! Mind if I catch a ride with you two?"

Evelyn glanced at Alexander, whose face had instantly turned to ice. He was famously protective of his sister. "Actually, I do mind. It's completely out of our way."

Sebastian looked crestfallen. Evelyn gave him an apologetic wave. "See you around, Sebastian."

Knowing better than to push his luck with Alexander Sterling, Sebastian didn't dare insist. He could only watch miserably as the siblings climbed into their luxury vehicle.

Just as the door was about to close, Sebastian suddenly rushed forward in a panic and yanked it back open.

"What on earth—?" Evelyn gasped in surprise.

The commotion drew attention from nearby guests. With Alexander's status, any public scene was bound to become gossip fodder.

Sebastian dropped to one knee, carefully gathering the hem of Evelyn's dress that had gotten caught in the door. He tucked the delicate fabric safely inside the car before looking up at her with a charming grin. "There, now you're all set. Safe travels!"

The crowd murmured at the sight of the handsome young man performing such a chivalrous gesture for the Sterling heiress.

On the second-floor balcony overlooking the entrance, Tristan Whitmore nudged Nathan Blackwood with an amused smirk. "Looks like your wife's little admirer has quite the flair for dramatic gestures, doesn't he?"

Tristan clearly suspected there was more than friendship between Alexander and Evelyn.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable as he turned away from the scene. "Let's go find the others. I need a drink."
###Chapter 48

The soft strains of a violin concerto filled the luxurious car interior. Evelyn Sinclair absently traced the embroidery on her dress hem as the familiar melody of "Nocturne" washed over her.

Alexander Sterling glanced sideways at his sister. "Lil E, is Sebastian Hart pursuing you?" His sharp eyes had noticed the unusual attention from their family friend.

Evelyn's fingers stilled momentarily before she laughed it off. "Don't be ridiculous. He's just being playful. It'll pass soon enough."

Alexander turned his gaze forward, chuckling. "Good."

"You don't approve?" This surprised Evelyn. The Sterlings and Harts had maintained close ties for generations.

"He's had more girlfriends than I can count, and his personal life is... complicated." Alexander hesitated before adding, "Not that it matters if he makes you happy."

Evelyn shook her head in amusement. "What are you implying? He's practically family! Besides, romance isn't on my agenda right now. I'm focused on building my career."

Alexander visibly relaxed. "Exactly. Men are temporary. You can have your pick whenever you're ready."

Meanwhile at the Velvet Lounge...

Nathan Blackwood had already emptied three whiskey bottles by the time his friends arrived. Tristan Whitmore hovered nearby, torn between concern and resignation.

Gregory Thornton and the others exchanged shocked looks as they entered the private room. Nathan hadn't drowned himself in alcohol like this since Theodore Hart's funeral years ago.

"What's going on?" Gregory asked as they settled around the table. Nathan poured another glass without blinking, the amber liquid disappearing down his throat effortlessly.

"Sit," Nathan commanded, gesturing vaguely. When everyone had drinks, Gregory turned to Tristan. "What happened?"

Tristan pressed his lips together. What could it possibly be? That damned ex-wife of course - though he wisely kept this thought to himself.

Nathan tugged at his loosened collar, exposing his collarbone. "Three years of marriage," he slurred, "and I never properly introduced her to you all. Evelyn Sinclair. Do you even know her?"

The name had been circulating in their circles recently. Who hadn't heard of the Sterling heiress?

Gregory scoffed. "Blackwood, you're from different worlds. Divorce was inevitable. We should be celebrating!" Tristan's frantic eye signals went ignored.

"Exactly! She was never really one of us," another friend chimed in. "We never acknowledged her as our sister-in-law. Didn't she marry you for your money anyway? Classic gold digger - don't let it get to you."

Nathan's expression darkened. "A gold digger?" He laughed bitterly. "Then why did she return every cent I gave her? Why walk away empty-handed? My family treated her like dirt, yet she never complained. My friends ignored her, and she just... accepted it. What was her game?"

The alcohol burned his throat as Tristan recounted the evening's events. The others remained unmoved, refilling their glasses.

"You're too soft-hearted," Gregory declared. "Not your fault if she couldn't handle your family."

"Women create their own drama," another added. "If she had issues, she should've spoken up. Every family has conflicts."

"Enough," Nathan suddenly growled, slamming his glass down. "Tristan, you're usually full of ideas. Why so quiet tonight?" His drunken gaze sharpened. "Unless... you're worried she still has those photos of you?"

The room erupted in laughter as the alcohol flowed freely. In his haze, Nathan kept seeing Evelyn's disgusted expression when she'd last looked at him. If she wanted them to be strangers... should he grant that wish?
###Chapter 49

The shrill alarm of Evelyn Sinclair's phone shattered her peaceful slumber.

She had insisted on returning to her own penthouse last night. The quiet solitude felt infinitely better than waking up to an army of maids fussing over her.

Glancing at her phone, she saw the headlines already blowing up.

"Former Power Couple Rekindling Romance?"

Accompanying the article was a breathtaking shot of Nathan Blackwood dipping her during their dance, his lips brushing against hers under the golden chandelier lights. The photographer had captured it like some Renaissance painting—all dramatic shadows and stolen intimacy.

Evelyn scoffed and swiped the tab away, switching to her emails instead.

Bennett, ever efficient, had already sent her schedule for the day before dawn. She showered quickly, letting the morning finance reports play in the background.

Last night's chaos felt distant now. She refused to let Nathan Blackwood occupy her thoughts any longer.

Her phone buzzed relentlessly. Isabella Montgomery's name flashed across the screen.

"Tell me that photo is doctored," Isabella demanded the second Evelyn picked up. "Because if it's not, I need details. STAT."

Evelyn sighed, explaining the stupid dance in clipped sentences.

Isabella exhaled dramatically. "Thank god. I was about to have an aneurysm." She immediately launched into a colorful tirade about the Blackwoods, then abruptly gasped. "Wait—the article just disappeared!"

Evelyn checked. Sure enough, it had vanished.

"I didn't pay to take it down," Evelyn mused.

Isabella cackled. "Check the group chat. Sebastian Hart just dropped a million dollars on PR to scrub it!"

Evelyn opened their chat to chaos:

[Isabella Montgomery]: SEBASTIAN JUST BLEW A MILLION TO ERASE HIS NON-EXISTENCE FROM LAST NIGHT'S PARTY PHOTOS
[Natalie Beaumont]: If there was a shot of him, I wonder who'd pay MORE to delete it.
[Isabella Montgomery]: DYING. SOMEONE CHECK ON HIM.

Evelyn smirked and typed:
[Evelyn Sinclair]: Next time, transfer the money to me directly. I'll personally issue a statement denying you.

Sebastian's reply was instantaneous:
[Sebastian Hart]: sobs dramatically I'm bleeding from my eyes.

By 7 AM, Bennett arrived with breakfast. "Grabbed this on the way. Hope it's alright."

Evelyn took the bag. "Thanks. Let's go."

"The 8 AM meeting is confirmed. President Sterling said you have full autonomy on the Kingsley Tech deal. No oversight."

Evelyn nodded. Alexander was testing her capabilities, and she wouldn't disappoint. "Did you schedule our preliminary inspection?"

"Kensington Group's team is visiting next week, so I booked ours for tomorrow morning."

"Good."

She flipped through the files in the car. The last thing she wanted was to run into Nathan's people. Even if he wasn't personally involved, she wouldn't risk it.

At Sterling Corp, the receptionist intercepted her with a massive bouquet. "Vice President Sinclair, these just arrived for you."

Evelyn eyed the card:
Dearest Evelyn,
My love for you spans galaxies.
Yours eternally,
Sebastian Hart

She resisted the urge to gag. "Throw these out, please."

Then she paused. "Actually, reject any future deliveries from him. Immediately."

The receptionist looked mournfully at the doomed flowers. "Yes, ma'am."

The conference room was packed by 8 AM sharp. Evelyn took her seat at the head of the table.

"Our collaboration with Kingsley Tech is underway. Bennett will distribute the project team assignments shortly."

Everyone leaned forward eagerly. This venture into AI technology was career-making.

After the meeting, Olivia Kensington cornered her.

"Vice President Sinclair, why wasn't I assigned to the core team?"

Evelyn didn't glance up from her tablet. "If I entertained every employee who asked that, I'd need a stadium. Would you like me to start charging for the privilege?"
###Chapter 50

Evelyn Sinclair despised Olivia Kensington, but she couldn’t afford an outright confrontation.

Olivia held leverage over her.

"My leadership experience is just as extensive as anyone on that list, and my performance ranks among the top senior managers." Evelyn crossed her arms, her tone edged with thinly veiled irritation. "Vice President Olivia, are you still holding a grudge over what happened last time?"

Olivia lowered her gaze, a smirk playing on her lips. "I don’t hold grudges, Evelyn. But I do recall you were vehemently against partnering with Kingsley Tech before this." She leaned back in her chair. "I just worry your personal bias might interfere with the collaboration."

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "I fully support the company’s decision now."

Olivia gave her a dismissive nod. "The list was finalized at the board meeting. There’s no changing it now. Maybe next time."

She began organizing the files on her desk—a clear dismissal.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "I’m sure exceptions can be made. Just wait and see, Vice President Olivia."

With that, she spun on her heel and strode out, confidence radiating from her every step.

Olivia watched her go, a slow, calculating smile curving her lips.

Perfect. She took the bait.

That afternoon, Bennett buzzed Evelyn’s office. "Victor Kensington wants to see you in his office."

Evelyn arched a brow. "The soon-to-retire board member? Interesting."

Aside from Alexander Sterling and Bennett, no one at Sterling Corp knew Evelyn’s true identity. As the newly appointed Vice President, she was curious what Victor wanted.

Victor had a reputation for insider trading. He’d wormed his way onto the board through dubious means and clung to his position like a leech. But with minimal shares and no real influence, he was more of a nuisance than a threat.

Evelyn knocked on his office door.

"Come in," came a weary voice.

She stepped inside, her smile polished and professional. "You wanted to see me, Mr. Kensington?"

Victor’s eyes flickered with something—interest, regret—before his expression settled into a practiced neutrality. "Sit."

She took the seat across from him.

Victor cleared his throat. "You’re quite striking, Ms. Sinclair. No wonder Alexander pushed so hard for your promotion despite the objections."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. So he resents Alexander’s influence.

She remained silent, letting him fill the uncomfortable quiet.

Victor’s lips thinned. "Did you know your position was originally meant for Olivia Kensington?"

Is he trying to intimidate me?

Evelyn tilted her head. "Olivia is competent, but I’m the better fit for this role."

Victor’s face darkened. "Arrogance and disrespect won’t get you far in this company, girl."

She stood, smoothing her blazer. "Then I’ll let my results speak for themselves. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave."

"Evelyn!" Victor snapped, frustration bleeding into his tone. "Add Olivia Kensington to the Kingsley Tech project team."

Her smile widened. So Olivia’s backer is this pathetic old man? Did she really think he’d scare me?

Victor scowled at her silence. "Did you hear me?"

"I did."

"Then make it happen."

Evelyn met his glare without flinching. "I can’t. It wouldn’t be fair to the others."

Victor’s face purpled. "Do you think Alexander’s protection makes you untouchable? I could—"

"Fire me?" Evelyn cut in, amused. "I doubt the board would remove me over Olivia Kensington. But I suppose she didn’t tell you what I have on her when she came crying to you." She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Tell her to stay out of my way."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked out, leaving Victor gaping behind her.

The moment she was clear of his office, she dialed Alexander’s private line.

"What’s wrong, Evie?"

"Victor Kensington is dirty. Olivia’s his puppet. He’s the one who tried to block the Kingsley Tech deal from the start."

Alexander chuckled. "Sharp as ever."

"You already knew?"

"Of course. Did you think I’d miss dissent in my own boardroom?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Good. That old fox isn’t worth my time."

"Leave him to me. Focus on Kingsley Tech." A pause. "Oh, and Nathan Blackwood is taking personal charge of this project."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone.

Interesting.
###Chapter 51

Evelyn Sinclair's mood darkened the moment she discovered Nathan Blackwood would be personally overseeing this project. The last thing she wanted was to interact with that man, yet fate seemed determined to throw them together during this collaboration.

How utterly frustrating.

The following morning, Evelyn arrived at Kingsley Tech with her team. Dominic Kingsley greeted them warmly, offering to escort them straight to the research lab. Witnessing the cutting-edge experiments and breakthroughs firsthand would give Sterling Corporation's representatives a genuine understanding of their progress.

As they walked, Evelyn and Dominic exchanged pleasantries. Just before they reached the lab entrance, something small and unexpected darted toward them. A startled voice from behind cried out, "Watch out!"

Evelyn glanced down—and froze.

A plump, striped tiger cub, no larger than her ankle, wobbled toward her. Its ears were perked, whiskers twitching, and its round, golden eyes sparkled with mischief. Far from intimidating, it looked like an overgrown, cuddly house cat.

The entire group gasped. Evelyn's pulse skipped as she instinctively stepped back.

But the little tiger misjudged its speed and collided with her shoe, tumbling onto the floor with a dramatic "Oof!" It scrambled up clumsily, rubbing its head against her foot as if apologizing. Then it peered up at her, blinking innocently.

Evelyn's heart melted.

It acted like a spoiled, lazy cub, utterly fascinated by everything around it. She had the sudden, irrational urge to scoop it up and take it home.

The tiger stretched out a tiny paw and patted the spot on her shoe it had bumped, as if dusting off invisible dirt.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, rubbing her eyes.

"Pretty lady!"

Her breath hitched.

The tiger had spoken—in the high-pitched, cheerful voice of a toddler.

Her eyes widened. Did it just—?

No, wait. Why was there a tiger here? Endangered animals didn’t just wander corporate hallways!

Dominic chuckled. "Apologies for the scare." He glanced down at the cub, his tone gentle but firm. "You should apologize too."

The tiger nuzzled Evelyn’s ankle again, its voice dripping with exaggerated remorse. "So sorry! I look scary, but I’m really nice!"

The words flowed so naturally, so human, that if it hadn’t spoken, Evelyn would’ve sworn it was real.

The team stared, stunned.

Evelyn crouched, mesmerized by the cub’s gleaming eyes—so lifelike they shifted with the light. Only the faintest infrared glow in its pupils betrayed its artificial nature.

"This is our experimental team’s latest prototype," Dominic explained. "A companion AI designed for emotional support. It usually stays in the lab, but someone must’ve left the door open." He sighed. "Little troublemaker."

"Is this part of our project?" Evelyn asked, excitement bubbling.

Dominic hesitated. "Not yet. It’s still in development—too many variables to mass-produce."

"But it’s adorable!" a colleague gushed. "I’d buy one in a heartbeat!"

"At the cost of ten Manhattan penthouses, maybe," Dominic said wryly. "The materials alone are astronomically expensive."

The group groaned in collective disappointment.

Evelyn sighed, giving the cub one last longing look—until it suddenly flopped onto its back, paws waving. "Pretty lady, hug me!"

She laughed, glancing at Dominic for permission. He rolled his eyes but nodded.

Carefully, she scooped it up.

The cub was light, fluffy, and warm, nestling into her arms like it belonged there. It even purred, nuzzling her chest with a blissful expression.

"You’re too cute," Evelyn murmured.

"I know!" it chirped, preening.

A female colleague leaned in. "Are all tigers this cuddly?"

The cub’s eyes gleamed. "Would you like to switch modes? Fierce tiger mode—yes or no?"

"Yes!"

It twisted its head, scrunched its face, and—

"Rrrowr?"

Silence.

"Rrrowr! Rrrowr!"

The group burst into laughter.

"That’s not fierce—that’s adorable!"

Dominic smirked. "Its IQ is higher than you think. It’s messing with you."

The cub grinned, rolling onto its back in Evelyn’s arms. "Everyone loves me!"

The team’s shock melted into awe—then envy as they eyed the priceless tech in Evelyn’s grasp.

Dominic finally ushered them into the lab, where Kingsley Tech’s innovations left Evelyn breathless. Autonomous vehicles, medical bots, smart homes—their AI advancements were revolutionary.

She knew then: partnering with them was the right choice.

While the team explored, Dominic guided Evelyn to a secluded oval office. Staff members stood respectfully as they entered.

Then a side door opened.

A man stepped inside.

A technician gestured. "Begin undressing."
###Chapter 52

The model stood ready, removing his shirt with practiced ease. His expression remained impassive as he bared his sculpted torso, positioning himself according to the scanning protocol.

Evelyn Sinclair was the sole female observer in the room. Her breath hitched at the unexpected display, cheeks flushing crimson. She immediately averted her gaze toward Dominic Kingsley.

"What exactly is happening here?" she demanded through clenched teeth.

Dominic adjusted his glasses with a professional smile. "We're compiling anatomical references for our next generation of AI companions. Different body types for different preferences."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. She bit her lower lip, thinking, This job just keeps getting more interesting.

A harried assistant rushed in, whispering urgently in Dominic's ear. His expression turned grave as he addressed Evelyn.

"Vice President Sinclair, would you mind overseeing the remaining sessions? I need to take these gentlemen for additional testing."

Before she could protest, the entire team filed out, leaving Evelyn alone with the AI tiger Leo cradled in her arms.

She stroked Leo's synthetic fur absently. "Guess we're running the show now."

The next participant entered before she could reconsider. Keeping her eyes fixed on the biometric display screen, Evelyn adopted the detached tone she'd heard the technicians use earlier.

"Please disrobe for scanning. Standard procedure."

When no movement followed, she frowned. "There's nothing to be embarrassed about. This will only take a moment."

Still no response.

Exasperated, Evelyn finally looked up—and froze.

Nathan Blackwood's obsidian eyes bored into hers, his glacial stare sending shivers down her spine.

Her professional mask slipped for only a heartbeat before she recovered. "Blackwood Industries wasn't scheduled until Thursday. To what do we owe this... unexpected visit?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Dominic chose that moment to return, his cheerful demeanor faltering at the charged atmosphere. "Ah! Vice President Sinclair, I neglected to mention Mr. Blackwood's early arrival for the—" He glanced between them. "Oh. You've... met."

Nathan's voice dripped with icy amusement. "Care to explain why your vice president was instructing me to undress?"

Dominic chuckled nervously. "Standard biometric scanning! With your exceptional physique, Mr. Blackwood, you'd make an excellent reference model." He turned to Evelyn with a conspiratorial wink. "Wouldn't you agree, Vice President?"

Evelyn rose abruptly. "Not interested."

As she turned to leave, Leo suddenly squirmed free and bounded toward Nathan. The mechanical tiger rubbed against Nathan's polished Oxfords, tiny paws batting at his trousers while emitting plaintive whimpers.

"Papa! Carry me!"

Evelyn whirled around in shock. Nathan's expression darkened as he grabbed Leo by the scruff, holding the struggling feline at arm's length.

"Release me this instant! This is undignified!" Leo protested, limbs flailing.

Nathan sighed with the weary familiarity of someone who'd endured this routine before, tucking the squirming tiger under one arm. His gaze lifted to meet Evelyn's, but she'd already schooled her features into icy disdain.

With a contemptuous sniff at the traitorous AI, Evelyn strode out without a backward glance.

Dominic observed Nathan's thunderous expression and couldn't resist a quiet chuckle. "She was doting on that creature all morning. The moment you touched it? Couldn't get away fast enough."

Nathan's glare silenced further commentary.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had barely exited the building when her phone buzzed with a message from Isabella Montgomery, summoning her to lunch at a nearby bistro.

Still rattled from the encounter, Evelyn welcomed the distraction. After informing Bennett of her plans, she headed to meet her best friend.

Isabella had secured reservations at an exclusive new fusion restaurant. Over an extravagant spread, their conversation flowed easily—until Isabella suddenly burst into laughter.

"You have to see this!" she gasped, thrusting her phone at Evelyn.

The screen displayed Tristan Whitmore's latest social media post—a doctored photo of Evelyn and Nathan dancing, with Tristan's face crudely superimposed over Nathan's. The caption read: Now this is more like it!

Evelyn rolled her eyes—until she noticed Nathan's unexpected comment beneath the post.

Evelyn had blocked Nathan completely months ago, severing all ties with her ex-husband. Seeing his name pop up in the comments section was the last thing she expected.

The fashion world truly was a small circle.

Nathan's comment read: [Counterfeit.]

Though the remark itself caused no real damage, its intention was clearly to provoke.

Sebastian Hart immediately fired back with a dozen furious replies, cursing Nathan Blackwood to hell and back. But Nathan remained silent after that single jab - the battle was over before it truly began.

Evelyn rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Doesn't he have anything better to do with his time?"

Isabella Montgomery smirked knowingly. "He's obviously still obsessed with you. The whole world can see it. Why not give him a chance? Wouldn't it be delicious to use this opportunity to drive Nathan absolutely insane?"

"I don't date my closest friends," Evelyn said firmly, her brow furrowing. "If I had any romantic interest in Sebastian, I would have made a move years ago. Stop putting nonsense ideas in my head."

Her mind wandered to how she should handle this awkward situation with Sebastian.

"Forget about men," Isabella said brightly, changing the subject. "I've had my eye on a new necklace. Want to come check it out with me?"

Girl talk always lifted Evelyn's spirits. She nodded, craving some retail therapy after the online drama. The two women left the restaurant and headed straight for an exclusive jewelry boutique.

Isabella had reserved this particular piece weeks in advance. When the sales associate brought it out, Evelyn gasped - it was breathtaking.

"This necklace is the final masterpiece from renowned designer Laurent Dubois," the associate gushed, recognizing the two impeccably dressed women as high-value clients. "You ladies have exquisite taste. Would you like to try it on?"

Isabella nodded and handed it to Evelyn. "Go ahead."

The two were like sisters who shared everything. Though Evelyn owned enough jewelry to fill a vault - thanks to her brothers' extravagant gifts for every occasion - there was still joy in trying on beautiful pieces.

Just as Evelyn lifted the necklace, a familiar venomous voice cut through the air.

"Let her try it on? Can she even afford it?" The sneer came from Sophia Blackwood, who had entered with her usual entourage. "You shouldn't let just anyone handle your merchandise. Who knows what cheap perfume she's wearing that might tarnish the piece?"

The lingering scent of their earlier barbecue lunch clung to their clothes, giving Sophia ammunition. Still seething from her last humiliating encounter with Evelyn, she couldn't resist attacking.

Isabella's face darkened. "Mind your own business."

Sophia strutted forward arrogantly. "I want this necklace! Don't let her touch it - I don't want it contaminated." She glared at Isabella before smirking at Evelyn. "How much allowance did your sugar daddy give you today? Probably not enough for this. Save your pennies, darling. I'll take it."

Evelyn calmly addressed the associate, "Please wrap this up for me," as she set the necklace down. Her icy gaze locked onto Sophia, carrying a silent warning that made the other woman flinch momentarily.

But surrounded by her friends and the store's security, Sophia quickly regained her bravado. "I said that necklace is mine," she insisted petulantly, determined to deny Evelyn this small pleasure.

The associate hesitated. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first—"

"What did you just say?" Sophia shrieked. "I'm a VIP client! I get priority on whatever I want!" She shot Evelyn a triumphant look. Store policy did give preferential treatment to top-tier customers.

The associate gave Evelyn and Isabella an apologetic look and reached for the necklace—until Evelyn's hand gently stopped her.

A slow, dangerous smile curved Evelyn's lips as she withdrew a gleaming black titanium card from her wallet. The associate's eyes widened in recognition - this was the ultra-exclusive Centurion card, rumored to have no spending limit.

The atmosphere in the boutique shifted instantly. Sophia's smug expression faltered as Evelyn's quiet power filled the space. This wasn't just about a necklace anymore - it was about dominance, pride, and settling old scores.

Evelyn's fingers tapped the counter once, decisively. "Ring it up."

The security presence was obvious. Evelyn Sinclair wouldn't dare cause a scene with so many guards watching.

"I'll be taking this one," Sophia Blackwood declared sharply. She wouldn't back down, not when it came to standing her ground against Evelyn.

The boutique assistant hesitated, wringing her hands. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first..."

"What did you just say?" Sophia's voice turned icy. "As a VIP client, I'm entitled to first choice on any item in this store!"

She shot Evelyn and Isabella Montgomery a triumphant look. The store policy clearly stated priority access for top-tier customers.

The flustered assistant cast apologetic glances at the other women as she reached for the dress. Just as her fingers brushed the fabric, Evelyn's hand came down gently but firmly on the garment.

A knowing smile played at Evelyn's lips as she withdrew something from her purse - a gleaming platinum card with distinctive black engraving.

The assistant's eyes widened in recognition. This wasn't just any VIP card - it was the exclusive Blackwood family insignia, granting unlimited purchasing privileges.

Sophia's smug expression faltered as Evelyn placed the card on the counter with deliberate calm. The air between them crackled with unspoken challenge.

"Now," Evelyn said smoothly, her voice carrying quiet authority, "shall we discuss who truly has priority here?"

Isabella bit back a grin as she watched the color drain from Sophia's face. The game had just taken an unexpected turn.

The boutique's security detail stood nearby, making Sophia Blackwood hesitate to cause a scene.

"I'll be taking this dress," Evelyn Sinclair declared firmly. She wouldn't let Sophia have her way this time.

The sales associate hesitated. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first—"

"What did you just say?" Sophia's voice turned shrill. "As a VIP client, I deserve priority service! Anything I want should be mine!"

A smug smile played on Evelyn's lips as she watched Sophia's tantrum.

The boutique's policy clearly stated VIP customers received first pick privileges.

The flustered associate glanced apologetically between Isabella Montgomery and Evelyn before reaching for the dress.

Evelyn's manicured hand stopped her.

With deliberate grace, Evelyn produced a matte black card from her Chanel clutch. The edges gleamed with platinum trim, bearing an embossed constellation pattern.

This was the legendary Celestial Card - rumored to be held by fewer than a dozen individuals worldwide. Even European royalty had been denied this exclusive membership.

The associate's eyes widened. "M-Madam Sinclair! Let me package this immediately for you!"

All thoughts of Sophia vanished as the staff sprang into action.

Sophia's jaw dropped. "That...that has to be counterfeit!" she sputtered. "Don't be fooled by her tricks!"

Though Sophia had never held one, she recognized it instantly from society tabloids. The leaked photos of this mythical card were seared into every socialite's memory.

Yet here it was - in Evelyn Sinclair's perfectly manicured hand.

How? Why? The questions burned through Sophia's mind. What gave this woman the right to possess such status?

The store manager materialized, ushering other customers toward the exit. "We must ask you to leave immediately. The boutique will be closing for a private shopping experience."

Evelyn's laughter rang like crystal.

Isabella smirked. "Yes, do remove that eyesore quickly." She gestured dismissively at the fuming Sophia.

The boutique staff moved with military precision, transforming the space into Evelyn's personal showroom within minutes. Sophia stood frozen, her face flushing crimson with humiliation.

Evelyn casually examined her reflection, adjusting the diamond bracelet on her wrist. "Darling," she addressed the manager without looking up, "have my usual selections brought out. And do ensure certain...unwanted elements don't disrupt my shopping again."

The unspoken command hung in the air as Sophia found herself escorted firmly toward the exit by two security guards. The heavy doors clicked shut behind her with finality.
###Chapter 53 Mind Your Business!

Evelyn had blocked Nathan everywhere, yet his name appeared under Sebastian's post.

Nathan's comment: [Cheap knockoff.]

Sebastian retaliated with a dozen insults, but Nathan didn't respond.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Doesn't Sebastian have better things to do?"

Isabella teased, "He's clearly into you. Why not date him to annoy Nathan?"

"I don't mix friendship with romance," Evelyn said firmly. "Now, about that necklace you wanted to see?"

At the jewelry boutique, the attendant presented Isabella's reserved piece - Laurent Dubois' final masterpiece.

"Would you like to try it?" the attendant asked eagerly.

Isabella handed it to Evelyn. "Your turn first."

As Evelyn reached for it, a shrill voice interrupted.

"Can trash like her even afford that? Her peasant stench will ruin the jewelry!" Sophia Blackwood sneered with her entourage.

Isabella glared. "Mind your business!"

Sophia snatched the necklace. "I'm taking this! VIPs get priority!"

The attendant hesitated until Evelyn produced a legendary black-gold card - the ultimate status symbol in luxury circles.

Sophia's jaw dropped. "That's fake!"

The manager immediately cleared the store. "Exclusive service for Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn smirked as Isabella added, "Finally, some fresh air without that skank."

Sophia stood fuming, humiliated yet again by the woman she couldn't touch.
###Chapter 54

Sophia Blackwood stormed out of the jewelry store, her face burning with humiliation. Isabella Montgomery snatched the black card from the counter and examined it with wide eyes. "How on earth did you get this?" she gasped.

Evelyn Sinclair smiled faintly. "Lucas gave it to me for my eighteenth birthday. Told me to keep it on me at all times. Never thought I'd actually use it."

"Why doesn't my brother give me things like this?" Isabella groaned, clutching her head in exaggerated envy.

Evelyn laughed and held the card out to her. "If you love it that much, take it."

"No way!" Isabella pushed it back. "These things are non-transferable. But you can buy me something nice with it."

Evelyn nodded in agreement, amused.

After purchasing a stunning new necklace, Isabella dragged Evelyn around the mall for another hour before they finally left.

Back at the office, Evelyn was in high spirits. Olivia Kensington had been making petty moves all day, but Evelyn paid her no mind. She knew Olivia’s schemes wouldn’t escape Alexander Sterling’s notice. If Olivia wanted to dig her own grave, Evelyn wasn’t about to stop her.

As she packed up to leave, her phone buzzed. Natalie Beaumont’s name flashed on the screen.

"Emergency!" Natalie blurted the second Evelyn answered. "There’s a charity gala tonight, and my artist, Adrian Prescott, needs a plus-one. I’m out of the country—can you step in?"

Evelyn checked her watch. "Fine. I’ve got nothing else planned."

"Love you! He’ll bring a dress. Be there soon."

The call ended, and Evelyn arched a brow. "How does Natalie always know I’ll say yes?"

She texted Bennett about the last-minute change and headed downstairs to wait. Adrian was a well-known model, and if anyone from the company spotted them together, the gossip would be relentless. Best to avoid unnecessary drama.

Less than ten minutes later, a sleek sports car screeched to a halt in front of the building. Evelyn nearly groaned when Adrian rolled down the window, waving dramatically. She hurried inside, but not before he blew a kiss to the gathering crowd.

Tomorrow’s headlines are going to be a nightmare.

Adrian grinned as they pulled away. "Ms. Sinclair, we haven’t met, but I’ve heard so much about you. Thanks for saving me tonight."

Evelyn offered a tight smile. "I’m doing this for Natalie. Not you."

His grin widened. "No wonder she was so confident you’d agree. You two must be close."

"Very."

Adrian, sensing her disinterest, wisely stayed quiet the rest of the ride.

They arrived early, and Evelyn changed into the emerald gown Adrian had brought while he waited outside. The charity gala was an exclusive event, filled with celebrities and high-profile figures. The moment they stepped inside, Evelyn spotted Margaret and Sophia Blackwood near the entrance.

Her lips curved. If they’re here, Nathan can’t be far.

The auction was the main event. Evelyn had no intention of bidding—until the final item appeared on screen.

An antique emerald-encrusted tobacco pipe.

Her breath caught.

She’d seen it before—in the Blackwood family memorial hall. It was Old Master Blackwood’s most prized heirloom, something he guarded fiercely.

How the hell did it end up here?

Her gaze flicked to Margaret and Sophia, who stood smugly at the front, basking in the attention.

Then it clicked.

They stole it.

The auctioneer announced, "This exquisite piece has been generously donated by Mrs. Blackwood and Ms. Blackwood of Blackwood Corporation. Bidding starts at three million dollars."

Three million? Evelyn nearly laughed. That’s it?

Margaret raised her paddle. "Three million!"

"Four million," someone countered.

Evelyn waited, letting the bids climb. Then, without hesitation, she lifted her paddle.

"Ten million."
###Chapter 55

The grand ballroom erupted in murmurs as all eyes locked onto Evelyn Sinclair.

Adrian Prescott studied her with a puzzled expression. "Why would you want that?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a mysterious smile. "It's quite exquisite, don't you think?"

"Hardly." Adrian scoffed. "It's just an ordinary jade pipe. What's so special about it?"

Evelyn felt the piercing gazes of Margaret and Sophia Blackwood. She met their stares head-on, her smile never faltering.

The Blackwood women visibly tensed. They knew Evelyn recognized this heirloom.

Years ago, Margaret had ordered Evelyn to clean the family memorial alone at night. She'd deliberately placed the precious pipe on a high shelf, hoping Evelyn would knock it over. One shattered heirloom would have been enough to banish Evelyn from the Blackwood family forever.

But Evelyn had been too clever to fall for the trap. Only the memorial's surveillance cameras had prevented Margaret from breaking it herself and framing Evelyn. Old Master Blackwood treasured this pipe more than life itself.

Now history repeated itself.

The Blackwood women had stolen the heirloom for tonight's auction. Sophia's reputation lay in tatters after Evelyn exposed her gambling with the Daydream necklace. Since returning from abroad, Sophia had suffered humiliation after humiliation, nearly becoming a social pariah.

This charity auction was Sophia's chance to reclaim her position as high society's darling. What better way than donating a priceless family heirloom?

Their plan seemed foolproof. Those who recognized the pipe wouldn't dare bid against the Blackwoods. Those who didn't recognize it wouldn't care. Sophia would dramatically "rescue" the family treasure, cementing her status.

They never anticipated Evelyn's appearance.

"Ten million, going once!" The auctioneer's voice rang out.

Sophia tugged Margaret's sleeve urgently. Margaret shot Evelyn a venomous glare before raising her paddle. "Eleven million."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Interesting. She'd assumed their limit was ten. "Twelve million."

Her phone vibrated with a call from an unknown number. Evelyn didn't need caller ID to know it was Sophia. She declined the call and blocked the number without hesitation.

"Thirteen million." Margaret's voice wavered slightly.

The auctioneer sensed the tension. "Thirteen million to Mrs. Blackwood. Any further bids?"

Silence stretched. "Thirteen million, going once! Going twice—"

"Fifteen million." Evelyn's interruption sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Margaret and Sophia exchanged frantic whispers. Sophia's face hardened with determination. "Twenty million!"

Evelyn smirked. Did they think that would intimidate her?

Adrian leaned close. "Need assistance?"

"Hardly." Evelyn raised her paddle again. "Thirty million."

Gasps filled the room. Evelyn had grown tired of toying with them. Time to end this.

The spotlight illuminated the Blackwoods' ashen faces.

"Thirty million, going once! Going twice! Sold to the lady in blue!" The auctioneer beamed. "All proceeds benefit Hope Academy!"

Thunderous applause broke the tension. Evelyn graciously acknowledged the crowd before locking eyes with her rivals. "What a delightful evening."

As expected, Margaret and Sophia waited backstage, their expressions stormy. The real confrontation was just beginning.
###Chapter 56

The attendant gracefully placed the exquisite emerald pipe before Evelyn Sinclair.

Her slender fingers traced the intricate carvings as she examined it closely. A faint crimson mark at the base confirmed its authenticity.

"So this is the real thing," Evelyn mused silently.

"Thank you," she said politely to the attendant, deliberately ignoring the two women hovering nearby.

Sophia Blackwood couldn't contain her irritation any longer. "Evelyn! Are you blind? Where are your manners when greeting your elders?" Her voice dripped with contempt.

Evelyn's lips curved into a mocking smile. Memories flooded back of how Margaret Blackwood had treated her during her marriage to Nathan - like a servant rather than a daughter-in-law.

"Oh, Mrs. Blackwood," Evelyn feigned surprise, "what an unexpected... pleasure." Her words were laced with enough sarcasm to make Margaret's face flush crimson.

"You think having powerful friends means you can disrespect me?" Margaret spat. "I'm still your mother-in-law!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Senile already? I divorced your precious son years ago. Find someone else to bully."

"How dare you!" Sophia finally found her voice, though she instinctively stepped behind her mother for protection. The air grew thick with tension.

Evelyn's smile vanished as her icy gaze pinned Sophia in place. "Are you giving me orders now?" The younger woman immediately shrank back, trembling.

The Blackwood women had come with a plan - humble Evelyn, then sweet-talk her into surrendering the heirloom. But Evelyn wasn't playing their game.

Only the presence of auction staff prevented Margaret from screaming obscenities. Instead, she forced a strained smile. "Evelyn, I'll give you thirty million for that pipe."

Evelyn paused, then chuckled. "If you had that money, you should've bid properly. Too late now." She signed the paperwork with a flourish. "It's mine."

"I've contacted Nathan," Margaret blurted desperately. "He's on his way."

Evelyn didn't even blink. "His presence changes nothing." She withdrew a platinum card from her clutch. "Process the payment."

The attendant accepted it with both hands while the Blackwoods gaped in horror. Sophia frantically texted someone - likely Nathan.

"Wasting your time," Evelyn murmured, watching the transaction complete. She could spend triple this amount without batting an eye.

Margaret switched tactics, her voice suddenly trembling. "That pipe is the old man's lifeline! He'll die without it! Have you no heart?"

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "You put it up for auction, not me. If anyone's killing him, it's you." She accepted the receipt. "The deal is done."

As the staff handed her the authenticated documents, the door burst open violently.
###Chapter 57

The moment Evelyn Sinclair spotted the approaching figure, her emerald eyes flashed with fiery intensity. She strode forward with purpose, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Nathan," she said through gritted teeth, "Your mother stole my grandfather's antique jade pipe!"

Sophia Blackwood clutched her mother's arm in panic. "It's the family heirloom! When Grandfather finds out it's missing—"

Nathan Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, his towering silhouette cutting an imposing figure. The dim lighting cast shadows across his chiseled features as his icy gaze swept over the room.

"Enough!" His voice cracked like a whip. "You dare steal from your own family?"

Margaret Blackwood trembled and ducked behind her daughter, shrinking under her son's withering glare. Behind Nathan, the event coordinator stood frozen, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Are the transfer documents finalized?" the coordinator whispered to his assistant.

"Everything's been processed, sir," came the hushed reply.

Evelyn felt the weight of the jade pipe in her clutch. With legal ownership secured, she held all the power now. She turned to Adrian Prescott beside her. "Let's go. We wouldn't want to interrupt this touching family reunion."

Without sparing them another glance, she pivoted on her stiletto heel.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous octave. "You're not leaving with that."

Margaret suddenly found her courage. "You can't let her take it!" she shrieked, emboldened by her son's presence.

Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk as she brandished the legal documents. "I believe this says otherwise." She deliberately let her gaze linger on Nathan's stormy expression, savoring his frustration. "Perhaps you should focus on explaining to your grandfather how his precious heirloom ended up at a charity auction. I wonder what he'll do when he learns it now belongs to me?"

Margaret's face drained of color. The thought of the Blackwood patriarch's wrath made her knees buckle. This scandal could get her banished from the family entirely!

Nathan's jaw tightened, the air around him turning arctic. "Name your price."

Evelyn's musical laughter filled the tense space. "Darling, do I look like I need your money?" She dangled the jade pipe tauntingly. "You want this back? In your dreams."

With that final jab, she swept out of the room, Adrian scrambling to keep pace.

Margaret clawed at Nathan's arm. "You can't just let her walk away! We have to—"

Nathan cut her off with a glacial stare. "I'll handle it. You two should worry about explaining this to Grandfather." Adjusting his cufflinks, he turned on his heel.

The old man likely already knew his treasure was missing. Nathan had no intention of shielding them from the consequences of their actions.

Margaret's eyes rolled back as she collapsed into her daughter's arms. Sophia's frantic cries for help went unanswered as Nathan disappeared down the hall.

Outside, the auction staff offered Evelyn security escorts for her valuable acquisition, but she declined with polite indifference. The pipe itself meant nothing—only the satisfaction of watching the Blackwood women squirm.

The elevator doors slid open. "Isn't that Mr. Blackwood?" Adrian murmured as Nathan's unmistakable frame approached.

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the buttons. Not a chance in hell she'd share an elevator with that man. She stabbed the 'close' button with determination.
###Chapter 58

Evelyn Sinclair barely glanced at the man outside the elevator, treating him like a complete stranger. The steel doors slid shut, cutting off her view of him completely.

Inside Adrian Prescott's sleek sports car, he finally voiced the question burning in his mind. "This artifact must be incredibly valuable. Why are the Blackwoods so desperate to get it back?"

Evelyn chuckled, turning the ornate box in her hands. "It's over a millennium old. Rumor has it this came from a royal treasury and has been in the Blackwood family for nearly eight centuries. What do you think?"

Adrian nearly swerved as the realization hit him. "That's practically priceless! They actually auctioned this? No wonder Nathan Blackwood told you to name your price. You could ask for nine figures and he wouldn't blink!"

The ringing of Evelyn's phone cut through the moment. Seeing Alexander Sterling's name flash on the screen, she answered with a smile. "Brother, I just acquired a little... keepsake."

There was a pause before Alexander's amused voice came through. "I heard. Only you would spend that much just to spite the Blackwoods."

Evelyn couldn't suppress her grin, imagining Sophia and Margaret Blackwood's reactions. "Well, it's mine now. And I have no intention of letting it go."

Alexander knew his sister too well. Her recent disappointments with the Blackwood family had left her looking for any opportunity to retaliate. If this made her happy, he wouldn't interfere.

The next morning dawned bright and clear. Evelyn arrived at Sterling Corp to handle some pressing matters. Olivia Kensington had been shooting daggers at her lately, but didn't dare make a move - Evelyn held too much leverage over her.

Bennett knocked and entered with documents. "Vice President Sinclair, the board has initiated an investigation into Olivia Kensington's kickbacks on multiple projects."

Evelyn looked up, intrigued. "So my brother's making his move?"

"Yes. With Victor Kensington backing Olivia, President Sterling decided it's time to act. To remove Victor, we must first expose Olivia. She likely knows she's powerless now - explains why she stopped harassing you about the Kingsley Tech collaboration."

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Then let's add fuel to the fire. Hand over that recording from my dinner with Olivia and Richard Dawson."

"Of course, ma'am." Bennett hesitated. "There's one more thing. Mr. Blackwood's secretary called requesting a lunch meeting."

Evelyn leaned back, arms crossed, her gaze turning icy. "Tell them I'm unavailable. And from now on, decline any invitations from him without consulting me."

At noon, just as Evelyn was preparing to leave for lunch, Bennett reappeared holding an extravagant bouquet. "Vice President Sinclair—"

"I thought I told you to discard those?" Evelyn frowned.

"How could you wound me like this, darling?" Sebastian Hart emerged dramatically from behind Bennett. "I personally selected every bloom! And you didn't even act surprised!"

Evelyn shot Bennett an exasperated look. The assistant lowered his head apologetically before making a quick escape.

Sebastian stormed into her office, his handsome face a picture of mock outrage. "I came to take you to lunch and this is the welcome I get?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Sebastian, you know how much office gossip this causes."

"I want everyone to know you're taken!" Sebastian declared without shame. "So they'll back off!"

Evelyn sighed. "You're wasting your time."

"That's my choice to make." His expression softened into a roguish grin. "Since you've wronged me, you're buying lunch today."

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn grabbed her purse. "Fine. You pick the place."

Fate had a cruel sense of humor - their chosen restaurant brought them face-to-face with the last people Evelyn wanted to see.

Tristan Whitmore sneered. "Too busy for Nathan but available for Sebastian Hart? Alexander Sterling, Adrian Prescott, now Sebastian... You really do change men like accessories, don't you?" His smirk turned vicious. "Keeping all those plates spinning must be exhausting."
###Chapter 59

Nathan Blackwood stood silently, his piercing gaze filled with icy intensity.

Evelyn Sinclair let out a soft laugh as she casually looped her arm through Sebastian Hart's.

She arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "Why should you care how many men I date, Tristan? Or are you volunteering to be next?"

Tristan Whitmore bristled at her words, his face flushing with anger. Why did Evelyn always manage to get under his skin?

"You? Not my type," he scoffed. "Frankly, that glimpse I got of you wasn't impressive. Save yourself for men with lower standards. I'm particular about physical perfection."

Evelyn's eyes flashed dangerously. "How dare you comment on my body!"

Tristan's face alternated between red and pale as he trembled with rage, but he bit his tongue. Those compromising photos she possessed left him powerless.

He caught her veiled threat immediately. Was this woman blackmailing him now?

Sebastian chuckled beside her. "Evelyn's standards are legendary, Mr. Whitmore. If we continue this conversation, you'll ruin our appetites."

One glance at Nathan's stormy expression was enough to darken Evelyn's mood.

She gave Tristan one last dismissive look, ignored Nathan completely, and strode toward the restaurant interior.

Tristan nearly exploded behind them. "The audacity! My physique is impeccable!"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "You think so?"

Lately, nothing was going his way. Failed business meetings with Evelyn, the unresolved emerald pipe situation, and now this humiliating encounter. The memory of Tristan's nude incident with Evelyn lingered unpleasantly in his mind.

Tristan found himself under fire again, unfairly blaming Evelyn for Nathan's bad mood.

Earlier at the office, he'd witnessed Harrison getting stonewalled by Evelyn's assistant Bennett.

Then they'd come to lunch only to find Evelyn dining intimately with Sebastian Hart. No wonder Nathan was in a foul mood.

"Speaking of which," Tristan ventured cautiously, "I heard your mother and sister auctioned off the family heirloom?" Nathan's expression darkened further. "Who bought it? Can't you just buy it back?"

Nathan's icy stare could freeze lava. "Evelyn has it."

Tristan swallowed hard. "Oh." That complicated things immensely.

The unpleasant encounter had killed Evelyn's appetite. The sweet wine Sebastian recommended burned treacherously in her throat - deceptively strong. She'd have suspected sabotage if Sebastian wasn't currently more intoxicated than she was.

Pressing a hand to her forehead, she called Bennett to arrange pickup. She needed to splash cold water on her face before leaving.

Though unsteady, Evelyn made it to the restroom. The cold water cleared her head, bringing instant regret about this disastrous lunch date.

She remembered the route back to their private room, but turning a corner, she collided with someone solid.

"My apologies—"

Her words died as she looked up into Nathan's stormy eyes. All traces of intoxication vanished as she immediately stepped back.

"Mr. Blackwood."

His eyes darkened at her retreat. "What a coincidence, Evelyn."

She arched an eyebrow. "Hardly. I was just leaving."

He blocked her path. "We need to talk."

"About what?" She feigned confusion.

"You know exactly what," he said, pinning her with his gaze.

Evelyn laughed, any remaining buzz disappearing. "There's nothing left to discuss between us. For business matters, contact Bennett."

Her phone rang - likely her driver. As she moved to leave, Nathan said tightly, "Name your price. The pipe isn't negotiable."

So the Ferguson heirloom had finally come up. Old Master Blackwood must have discovered its absence by now. Margaret and Sophia were probably suffering the consequences.

"Still don't understand, Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn's smile glittered dangerously. "My silence yesterday was answer enough. The answer is no."
###Chapter 60

Evelyn Sinclair finished speaking her mind and retreated to the private room to collect her belongings before leaving.

Just as she was about to enter her car, she realized with a start that her designer clutch had been left behind in the private room.

She turned to retrieve it herself, but Sebastian Hart stopped her with a gentle hand on her arm. "Let me get it for you. Wait in the car."

Without waiting for her response, Sebastian strode back inside. Evelyn hesitated, then decided to follow after him discreetly. That's when she spotted Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore exiting through another door.

Not wanting unnecessary complications, Evelyn ducked behind the ornate fountain at the entrance, its cascading water providing cover.

"I heard Vanessa Holloway is returning soon?" Tristan's voice carried clearly in the crisp afternoon air.

Nathan responded with a noncommittal grunt.

Tristan chuckled. "It's been ages since I've seen her. I've actually missed her presence. Sure, she made mistakes, but your punishment was rather harsh, don't you think? She's always been one of us - surely you can find it in your heart to forgive her?"

The two men continued their conversation as they walked to Nathan's waiting car, their figures disappearing behind tinted windows.

The sky had darkened ominously, matching Evelyn's suddenly somber mood. A chilly wind whipped through her hair as she stared at the departing vehicle, an inexplicable tightness gripping her chest.

Vanessa Holloway will always be part of their inner circle, while no matter how hard I try, I'll forever remain an outsider to Nathan Blackwood.

That name - Vanessa Holloway - still had the power to send shivers down Evelyn's spine even after three years. She had believed herself free from its haunting grip, yet hearing it spoken aloud again brought back that same suffocating sensation.

"Pathetic," Evelyn muttered to herself, disgusted by her own reaction.

She knew Vanessa had fled abroad after that disastrous party. Out of sight had meant out of mind - Evelyn hadn't pursued the matter further.

But sending Vanessa abroad was considered punishment? And her return merely required Nathan's forgiveness? The absurdity of it made Evelyn's blood boil.

What about those three years when Vanessa drained me dry? I might find it in my heart to forgive others, but never her. So she's returning? Well, I'll be sure to prepare a proper welcome.

Sebastian reappeared, holding up Evelyn's forgotten clutch. His smile faded when he saw her ashen complexion. "Evelyn? Are you feeling unwell?"

She blinked, forcing a bright smile. "No, I'm fine. My driver's here - I should be going."

"Let me take you home." Sebastian guided her firmly into his car before she could protest, sliding in beside her.

Evelyn nodded absently, her smile not quite reaching her eyes.

Sebastian studied her profile, his mouth opening as if to say something, then closing again. The ride passed in heavy silence.

When they arrived at Evelyn's penthouse, she automatically instructed the driver to wait. Then she paused, meeting Sebastian's unusually solemn gaze.

"Aren't you going to invite me up, now that we're here?" His tone was light, but his eyes held uncharacteristic gravity.

Trusting his integrity completely, Evelyn stepped aside to let him enter. Somehow, his presence made the tightness in her chest ease slightly.

Sebastian suddenly laughed, the sound startling in the quiet apartment. In one fluid motion, he stood and pulled Evelyn into an embrace. Just as she began to struggle, he released her.

His eyes burned with unusual intensity as he leaned down, bringing his face level with hers. "He lost the right to affect you like this long ago, Evelyn. Remember - you'll always be my queen."

The sudden proximity left Evelyn breathless. His distinctive sandalwood scent enveloped her, making her pulse race unexpectedly.
###Chapter 61

Evelyn Sinclair felt her breath catch when Sebastian Hart turned serious.

His intense gaze held a magnetism that threatened to pull her under.

Three years ago, he'd been nothing but a reckless playboy. Now, he carried himself with a quiet authority that unsettled her.

She forced a laugh, desperate to mask her reaction. "Since when did you become so smooth, Sebastian?"

He stepped back with an easy grin. "Only for you, darling. No one else gets this version of me."

"Please," Evelyn rolled her eyes. "With your reputation? I bet you've got women lining up around the block just to hear you whisper sweet nothings."

Sebastian's expression turned unexpectedly solemn. "Those rumors were never real. You know that."

The sincerity in his voice made her chest tighten.

"Thanks for the distraction," she said quickly, "but I should rest." She couldn't risk falling for another charming liar—especially not her oldest friend.

When Sebastian wasn't flashing that wicked smile, he radiated a dangerous allure. A walking temptation.

Evelyn turned away abruptly, spotting the emerald pipe on the coffee table. Her lips curled as she picked it up, examining the Blackwood family heirloom with cold amusement.

With deliberate carelessness, she tossed it aside like trash before retreating to her bedroom. Old Man Blackwood would have an aneurysm if he saw how she treated his precious artifact.

She woke at 10 PM to a message from Alexander Sterling: [Handling overseas business. Will be gone three days. Mind the fort.]

Evelyn blinked at her phone. Since when did her overprotective brother trust her with the company?

[You realize I might burn the place down, right?] she typed back, adding a string of laughing emojis.

His reply came instantly: [Just don't bankrupt us. Everything else is fixable.]

Chuckling, Evelyn remembered the pipe. She sprang from bed, snapping a perfectly angled photo before posting it with the caption: [Found this trinket at a flea market. Thoughts?]

Within minutes, Isabella Montgomery and Sebastian had shared her post, ensuring it reached Nathan Blackwood's inner circle. Let them all see how little she valued their precious heirloom.

By morning, her phone buzzed with Isabella's excited call. "Someone offered sixty million for that 'flea market find' of yours!"

Evelyn laughed. "Double its worth overnight? How flattering."

"Guess who's behind the highest bid?" Isabella's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Tristan Whitmore—acting on Nathan's orders. The Blackwoods are desperate."

"Predictable," Evelyn smirked. "As if I'd sell it back to them."

After the call, she surveyed her garage—a glittering showroom of luxury vehicles courtesy of her father. The understated gray Porsche stood out among the flashier options.

Her choice made, she slid behind the wheel just as Archibald called from Sterling Manor.

"Miss Sinclair, shall I send a driver?"

"No need," she purred, turning the ignition. The engine roared to life like a challenge. Today promised to be interesting.
###Chapter 62

To Archibald, the esteemed butler of Sterling Manor, it was unthinkable that Miss Evelyn Sinclair should drive herself around the city.

A proper lady of her standing required a chauffeur at all times. Anything less would reflect poorly on his professionalism.

Evelyn chuckled lightly into the phone. "Archibald, really now. I'm perfectly capable of driving myself to the office. Don't trouble yourself over it."

She ended the call before he could protest further. The sleek Porsche Cayenne purred to life as she pulled out of the garage, the morning sun glinting off its flawless silver finish.

The roads were unusually clear for rush hour. Evelyn noticed with amusement how other vehicles seemed to magically create space around her car. Even at stoplights, drivers maintained a cautious three-meter buffer zone.

"Honestly," she muttered, "do I look that dangerous behind the wheel?"

Arriving at Sterling Corporation headquarters, Evelyn handed her keys to the valet. As she strode through the marble lobby, she caught Olivia Kensington glaring daggers at her from the reception area.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Had Olivia discovered she'd given Alexander the recording? That seemed improbable - the information shouldn't have leaked so quickly.

"Ms. Kensington," Evelyn called sweetly, "aren't you coming up? The meeting starts in ten minutes."

Olivia's lips curled in disdain. "Mr. Sterling must be quite taken with you to gift such an expensive vehicle. That Porsche must have cost at least two million, no?"

As if Evelyn couldn't afford her own luxury cars. She tossed her hair over one shoulder with deliberate nonchalance. "How provincial of you to assume I couldn't purchase it myself."

Letting her gaze linger on Olivia's flushed cheeks, Evelyn turned toward the private elevator without another word. That used Audi bribe had been particularly insulting.

Upstairs, Bennett briefed her on the meeting agenda. Evelyn entered the conference room in crisp stilettos, Olivia trailing behind with poorly concealed resentment.

Scanning the assembled executives, Evelyn noted Victor Kensington's unusual presence. The wily board member typically avoided these meetings. His fox-like smile suggested he'd come specifically to watch the fireworks.

"Let's begin," Evelyn announced.

The Kingsley Tech partnership details required meticulous negotiation. Every clause represented millions in potential profit. Yet the department heads - many of whom were shareholders - dragged their feet at every proposal from Evelyn's team.

Victor finally broke his silence. "Vice President Sinclair, you must understand our hesitation. While you secured this Kingsley Tech deal, the field remains volatile. We can't risk too much capital without Mr. Sterling's approval."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Are you suggesting we breach our contract with Kingsley Tech, Mr. Kensington?"

Victor paled. Alexander would have his head for that. "Of course not! I merely propose we table discussions until Mr. Sterling returns."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around her pen. Every delayed decision eroded their competitive edge in this emerging market. If Sterling Corp lost its leadership position, the entire venture would become meaningless.

Her gaze turned glacial as it swept across the table. "So none of you can function without Mr. Sterling holding your hands? Is this a strike?"

The room fell silent, shocked by her uncharacteristic sharpness. The pampered heiress facade had slipped, revealing steel beneath.

"You're all industry leaders," Evelyn continued, voice like tempered glass. "If you'll sabotage progress simply because the CEO is traveling, who will bear the financial consequences? What company would want executives who crumble without constant supervision?"

She let the question hang, watching comprehension dawn on their faces.

They'd thought to intimidate her in Alexander's absence. How unfortunate for them that Evelyn Sinclair was nobody's pushover.
###Chapter 63

The conference room remained in absolute silence for what felt like an eternity.

Victor Kensington's face flushed crimson, clearly unprepared for Evelyn Sinclair's counterattack. "This isn't—"

Evelyn cut him off without hesitation. "As you all received notification this morning, I'm assuming full control of Sterling Corporation during Mr. Sterling's absence."

Her piercing gaze swept across the room. "This project is under my authority. Anyone unwilling to participate may submit their resignation immediately. Your deputies will assume your responsibilities, and I'll personally brief Mr. Sterling on all developments."

The executives sat stunned. Each had clawed their way to their current positions through years of corporate warfare, with ambitious deputies constantly circling like sharks. No one dared make a move in this high-stakes moment.

Though they resented Evelyn's rapid ascent to Vice President, they'd all witnessed Alexander Sterling's unwavering support since her arrival. Crossing her meant risking everything.

Regret settled over those who'd followed Victor's lead in challenging Evelyn. The air grew thick with tension, the only sound being the nervous tapping of pens against notepads.

Victor realized his momentum had evaporated when not a single colleague continued the opposition.

"Richard Dawson," Evelyn addressed the Planning Department head sharply. "Can your team deliver the proposal by end of day?"

Richard snapped to attention. "Absolutely, Vice President Sinclair. My team will produce the optimal plan immediately after this meeting. We won't delay progress."

The other department heads, seasoned corporate survivors all, quickly followed suit with enthusiastic assurances. The atmosphere shifted palpably as Evelyn's expression softened.

"Excellent. And the other departments?"

"Research is already underway!"

"We've been preparing contingency plans for weeks!"

"Consider it done, Vice President!"

Evelyn nodded approvingly as the room filled with pledges of cooperation. Only Victor and Olivia Kensington remained silent and sullen in their seats—a detail Evelyn noted with satisfaction, knowing their days at Sterling Corporation were numbered.

As the meeting concluded, Evelyn checked her watch. "Though Kingsley Tech leads core development, we'll send two researchers to participate in later stages. HR should identify our top candidates immediately."

The executives lingered afterward, eager for private words with their suddenly approachable VP. Evelyn charmed each one, her earlier iciness replaced by warm professionalism.

Bennett appeared at her elbow, whispering urgently. "Vice President Sinclair, Chairman Blackwood has arrived."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "So soon? The old man's more impatient than I anticipated."

Protocol demanded she receive the Blackwood patriarch, given their corporate relationship. "Where is he waiting?"

"Your office, ma'am. He went straight there."

Evelyn suppressed a smile—of course the emerald pipe would bring him running. She chuckled softly before entering...only to freeze at the unexpected sight of Sophia Blackwood seated beside her grandfather.

"How rude!" the elder Blackwood snapped. "Entering without knocking!"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Another power play? After surviving the boardroom ambush?

"Chairman Blackwood," she countered smoothly, "I never knock to enter my own office."
###Chapter 64
Prearranged Confrontation

Evelyn Sinclair strode confidently to her executive chair, the click of her heels echoing through the spacious office. She tossed the files onto her mahogany desk with practiced ease before powering up her computer.

Across from her, Reginald Blackwood's face darkened with each passing second of being ignored. His knuckles turned white around his cane.

"Evelyn," he spat through gritted teeth, "I've clearly misjudged you all these years."

The elderly patriarch's cold laughter sent chills through the room. "How resourceful you've become. No wonder you initiated the divorce so readily. You'd already secured your next position before leaving my grandson." His cane struck the floor with a sharp crack. "Vice President of Sterling Corporation straight after divorcing Nathan? Alexander must truly favor you."

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile as she surveyed the Blackwoods. Sophia stood trembling behind her grandfather, but the old man had come armed for battle.

"Wasn't it your family who demanded the divorce?" Evelyn leaned back in her chair, fingers steepled. "Tell me, Chairman Blackwood, why summon me weekly to Aspen Lodge just to remind me of my unworthiness? Now that I'm gone, shouldn't you be celebrating?" Her gaze turned glacial. "Yet here you are - in my office. Why?"

She remembered those humiliating Sundays too well - Margaret's cruel jabs, Sophia's petty torments, all sanctioned by the patriarch's silent approval. The entire household had treated her like dirt beneath their designer shoes.

Reginald's face purpled with rage. "How dare you take that tone with me! After everything our family—"

"This is Sterling Corporation," Evelyn cut in smoothly. "There are no family ties here - only business associates. I'm entertaining this meeting as a professional courtesy." She checked her diamond-encrusted watch pointedly. "State your business or leave. Unlike you, I don't have time for theatrics."

Sophia gasped. "You can't speak to Grandfather like that! His health—"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Not my concern anymore. Did you come here expecting me to grovel?" She pressed her intercom. "Bennett, please prepare to escort our guests out."

Reginald's cane slammed down again. "Enough! The emerald pipe - name your price." His breathing grew labored. "That heirloom is priceless to our family. Whatever ridiculous sum you're imagining, I'll pay it."

Evelyn arched a perfectly groomed brow. "Ah, the real purpose reveals itself." She let the silence stretch unbearably long. "As I told your daughter-in-law and granddaughter, it's not for sale."

Veins bulged at Reginald's temples. "Don't play games with me, girl! This is your only chance—"

"Just like when you offered me 'any price' to divorce Nathan?" Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I didn't want your money then. I certainly don't need it now."

For three years they'd watched her like a common thief, certain she'd married for wealth. Nathan's monthly "blood money" payments were the only funds they'd permitted her to touch.

Sophia suddenly found her voice. "You're doing this out of spite! Keeping Grandfather's treasure hostage to punish us!"

Evelyn shrugged, the picture of nonchalance. "If that's what helps you sleep at night." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "But yes."

The admission hung in the air like a guillotine's blade.
###Chapter 65 The Scheming Viper

Evelyn Sinclair made no attempt to hide her motives.

Under normal circumstances, she would never deliberately withhold someone else's treasured possession without cause.

But the Blackwoods were different.

She despised them with every fiber of her being and took vicious satisfaction in disrupting their peace.

That was precisely why she had purchased the emerald pipe—to torment them.

She admitted it openly, seeing no reason to pretend civility in front of them.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I'm not some naive, forgiving saint. I return the energy I'm given."

Her voice was ice.

"Do you remember how your family treated me? Did you really think I'd forget?"

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"Do I look like the type to turn the other cheek?"

Sophia Blackwood trembled with barely contained fury, her words choking in her throat.

Evelyn's blunt confession infuriated her more than any denial could have.

Margaret Blackwood shot Sophia a warning glare, forcing her to bite back her rage.

Taking a shaky breath, Sophia forced her voice into a pitiful whimper, widening her eyes in feigned innocence.

"Evelyn, I was young and foolish back then. You're so much better than me—please, just forgive me."

Her lips quivered.

"I'll do anything to make it right. Just return Grandfather's pipe. This is all my fault—Mother's been confined, and I've been punished too."

She sniffled dramatically.

"If you're still angry, you can slap me. Twice. However many times you need."

Evelyn merely smirked, watching Sophia's performance with cold amusement.

For a moment, Sophia faltered, her mask slipping before she stiffened again.

Evelyn's gaze was razor-sharp, dissecting her like a specimen.

What a pathetic little viper.

When Evelyn remained unmoved, Margaret cleared her throat, barely concealing his irritation.

"Evelyn, I know we've wronged you. Sophia came here today to apologize sincerely."

His tone was strained.

"Name your terms."

Evelyn scoffed.

Apology? More like emotional blackmail.

Her expression remained impassive.

"I don't accept your apology. And the pipe stays with me."

Margaret's composure cracked, his face darkening.

"Evelyn," he growled, "what exactly do you want?"

Finally losing his patience?

She tilted her head.

"Nothing. If we're done here, I have places to be."

Exhaustion crept in—dealing with them was draining.

Margaret's eyes turned glacial.

"Don't say I didn't give you a chance."

Evelyn arched a brow.

"Oh? What are you planning?"

With deliberate slowness, Margaret pulled out his phone.

"Tell me—does William Sterling know his son is involved with a divorcee?"

A venomous smile curled his lips.

"I still have some influence with him. Do you really think he'll let you keep your position once he finds out?"

The threat hung thick in the air.

Evelyn paused—then laughed.

She extended her hand in a mocking gesture.

"Go ahead."

He really thinks this will scare me?

William Sterling is my father.

Margaret's expression darkened further.

Seeing her defiance, he dialed the number.

Sophia watched with smug anticipation, as if awaiting Evelyn's downfall.

The line connected after three rings.

"Margaret Blackwood," came William Sterling's relaxed voice. "To what do I owe this unexpected call?"

Margaret forced a chuckle.

"William, I heard you were vacationing in Europe. You sound well."

"I was. The Mediterranean is lovely this time of year."

A pause.

"Unless this is urgent, I’m in the middle of fishing."

Evelyn smirked.

Of course Dad wouldn’t waste time on them.

Margaret cut straight to the point.

"William, are you aware your son is entangled with a divorcee?"

A beat of silence.

Then—

"Really? I hadn’t noticed."
###Chapter 66

Old Master Blackwood's voice was sharp. "Alexander is highly capable—he takes after you. But if he's being manipulated by a woman like her, won't everything fall apart?"

William Sterling scoffed. "Just a woman. What damage could she possibly do?"

Old Master Blackwood shot Evelyn Sinclair a meaningful glance.

"This woman is far from ordinary. Right after her divorce, Alexander promoted her to Vice President of Sterling Corporation—second-in-command. Soon, she'll be making all the decisions in your company. Shouldn’t you, as Chairman, step in before it’s too late?"

Most people would have been furious hearing such words.

But William Sterling was no ordinary man.

He let out a dry chuckle, his tone dismissive.

"Mr. Blackwood, worry about your own affairs. I trust my son." A pause, then amusement colored his voice. "Ah, looks like I’ve got a bite. Goodbye."

The call ended abruptly.

Old Master Blackwood’s face twisted in frustration. He glared at Evelyn, his anger barely contained.

"You got lucky this time. But do you really think it’s that easy to enter the Sterling family? William Sterling is far more formidable than you realize!"

Evelyn laughed lightly, her eyes glinting with quiet confidence. "That’s not your concern." She tilted her head. "But mark my words—I will be part of the Sterling family."

After all, the truth of her identity would come to light eventually. She couldn’t wait to see the old man’s reaction when he realized who she really was.

Old Master Blackwood sneered, mocking her delusion. He opened his mouth to retort, but Evelyn had already lost interest.

Calling William had been his last resort—and it had failed spectacularly.

"Chairman Blackwood," she said smoothly, "if there’s nothing else, my assistant will see you out. I have a meeting to attend."

Evelyn Sinclair offered them a polite yet distant smile, her expression carefully neutral.

Sophia Blackwood looked furious, her lips pressed into a tight line as she fought back whatever biting remark threatened to spill out.

Old Master Blackwood, equally exasperated by the encounter, let out a cold scoff. "You're bringing this upon yourself."

With a press of a button on her office intercom, Evelyn summoned Bennett, who entered promptly and stood at attention.

"Vice President Sinclair, how may I assist you?"

"Please escort our guests out."

"Right away, ma'am." Bennett turned to the visitors with practiced professionalism. "Chairman Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood, this way, please."

Old Master Blackwood clenched his jaw, his face dark with displeasure as he strode out. Sophia followed, shooting Evelyn one last resentful glare.

Once outside, the old man immediately dialed Nathan Blackwood, his voice thick with fury.

"I never imagined Evelyn would turn out to be this ungrateful after three years of marriage. She's stubborn as a mule. Were you blind when you married her?"

Nathan paused. "You went to see her?"

"Of course I did! I can't stand the thought of my precious pipe in her hands for another second! That woman is ruthless—she refused to hand it over even when I confronted her personally. She deceived us for three years. I never expected her to be this kind of person!"

Nathan was silent for a long moment before responding, his voice low. "Perhaps she's had enough of tolerating us all this time."

"Grandfather, I'll handle it. Don’t worry—I’ll get your pipe back."

"You'd better. Otherwise, I won’t let her off so easily! And by the way, she even had the audacity to claim she’s marrying into the Sterling family. Do something about her private life. No respectable family would accept a divorced woman who flirts with every man in sight!"

Nathan’s frown deepened, irritation flaring in his chest.

Evelyn had done nothing wrong, yet she was still being slandered. His grandfather’s words left a bitter taste in his mouth.

But the thought of Alexander Sterling and Sebastian Hart constantly hovering around her only made his mood worse—restless, suffocated, unsettled.

After hanging up, Nathan rubbed his temples, exhaling sharply.

Harrison, who had been watching cautiously from the side, finally spoke up.

"Sir, the meeting scheduled in five minutes—shall we proceed as planned?"

Nathan’s dark eyes flickered with something unreadable. Instead of answering, he asked, "Harrison, what kind of person do you think Evelyn is?"

"Why is she so different before and after the divorce?"

Harrison hesitated, then decided honesty was best.

"Madam—I mean, Ms. Sinclair—is a very kind person."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "You’ve been in frequent contact?"

"No, no! It’s just… back when you first married, she would often call me. She was always concerned about your well-being."

"Every time you traveled for business, she’d check the weather and remind me to pack appropriate clothes and meals. Sometimes, she’d even prepare them herself and send them over. And no matter how many times you ignored her calls, she never got angry."

Watching Nathan’s face grow stormier, Harrison wondered if he’d said too much.

"And yet… I never knew any of this?"
###Chapter 67

Nathan Blackwood's fingers tightened around his phone.

He couldn't recall a single time Evelyn Sinclair had ever reached out to him.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously. "Sir, I did bring this up before, but you made it clear you didn't want to be bothered with trivial matters from Highland Estates. You specifically said—in front of both Ms. Sinclair and me—that unless it concerned Vanessa Holloway, you weren't to be disturbed."

His voice trailed off as the temperature in the room seemed to drop.

Nathan rubbed his temples, the memory surfacing.

They had been at Highland Estates then, but his focus had been solely on Vanessa’s condition. He hadn’t noticed the way Evelyn’s hopeful gaze had dimmed, hadn’t realized how his indifference had chipped away at her until there was nothing left.

He had given her the marriage she asked for—in name only—but in return, he had taken everything from her.

The pain in his chest was sudden and suffocating.

Now he understood.

This was how Evelyn had gone from cautious to completely broken.

"Sir, the board meeting—"

"Set up a meeting with Evelyn. I need to see her." Nathan knew she wouldn’t answer if he called, and showing up unannounced at Sterling Corp would only push her further away.

Harrison hesitated. "They’ve already declined. Ms. Sinclair isn’t available."

Nathan’s gaze darkened, and Harrison immediately backtracked.

"But I’ll keep trying until we secure an appointment."

"Get out." Nathan’s voice was ice. "Proceed with the meeting as scheduled."

Harrison retreated with a quiet sigh.

What was the point? Why chase after her now, when the divorce was final?

Sterling Corporation

Bennett had just escorted Old Master Blackwood out when he returned to Evelyn’s office, relaying every word of the confrontation.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

She had never been liked by the Blackwoods, so she wasn’t surprised they’d resort to underhanded tactics. But fabricating scandals about her personal life? That was low.

"He wants to ruin my reputation so I can’t remarry into high society?" She tapped her nails against the desk. "How petty."

Most women would be crushed by such rumors.

But Evelyn wasn’t most women.

She had planned to return the emerald pipe after toying with them for a few more days.

Now?

She’d keep it just to spite them.

Her phone buzzed—William Sterling calling.

She waved Bennett off. "Give me a minute."

Once the door closed, she answered. "Dad. Catch anything good today?"

William huffed. "Did that old bastard Blackwood just confront you?"

"Right in my office. Then he called you in front of me like it was some kind of power move." She examined her manicure, unbothered.

"He has the audacity to complain to me?" William’s voice sharpened. "After everything they put you through?"

"Don’t worry. I kicked him out."

"Good girl." William’s tone warmed with pride. "No need to be polite to those vipers."

Evelyn laughed. "Exactly. If he comes back, I’ll smash that pipe of his. Let’s see who suffers more."

William chuckled. "That’s my daughter. Show them who they’re dealing with."

A knock interrupted them.

Bennett leaned in. "Vice President, we still need to finalize the Kingsley Tech proposal. Should we convene a meeting?"

Evelyn nodded. "Dad, go enjoy your fishing. I’ve got work."

By evening, Evelyn was packing up when Bennett stopped her at the door.

"Vice President, Dominic Kingsley requested dinner to discuss the Kingsley Tech project."

Evelyn considered it. The deal was crucial.

"Fine. You’re coming with me."

Bennett nodded. "I’ll arrange the car."
###Chapter 68

Evelyn Sinclair exchanged a glance with Bennett, whose expression mirrored her own surprise.

Nathan Blackwood's unexpected presence clearly caught them both off guard.

Their eyes met briefly before Evelyn turned her attention to Dominic Kingsley, her lips curving into a wry smile.

"Was this your idea of a setup?"

Dominic lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, glancing between Nathan and Evelyn.

"Vice President Sinclair, I had no choice in the matter. Forgive my presumption—I assure you, I remain neutral in whatever matters exist between you both." He offered a conciliatory smile. "As an apology, once you're finished here, I'd like to personally show you our new research facility. I believe you'll find it fascinating."

Fascinating? Undoubtedly. But that didn't lessen the irritation of being manipulated.

Evelyn's expression cooled as she turned her gaze to Nathan, her brow arching slightly. "Mr. Blackwood, if this is about that emerald pipe, save your breath. I'm not interested in rehashing the same conversation."

Honestly, would they ever stop hounding her? Her time was far too valuable for these games.

"Evelyn." Nathan's deep voice held an unfamiliar weight. After a pause, he continued, "I know my grandfather visited you today. Whatever he said... don't take it to heart."

He knew better than to expect forgiveness. A simple apology couldn't erase three years of neglect.

Evelyn studied him, struck by the odd shift in his demeanor.

"Is that all?" Impatience laced her words.

Nathan hesitated. "That pipe holds no real value to you. If you took it simply to provoke them, you've succeeded. Once you've had your fill of satisfaction, return it to my grandfather. Name your price—anything you want."

Silence stretched between them. Then Evelyn's lips curled in amusement.

How interesting. When intimidation failed, he resorted to bargaining? That pipe must mean more to them than she realized.

Dominic, sensing the tension, attempted to lighten the mood. "Anything? What if she demands reconciliation? Would you agree to that?"

The question hung heavily in the air. Bennett's gaze flicked to Nathan, whose expression darkened.

Just as Dominic began regretting his words, Evelyn laughed—a sharp, dismissive sound.

"Reconcile? Don't flatter yourself. Someone of Mr. Blackwood's standing should marry within his own circle. Why would he ever lower himself?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, but Evelyn continued smoothly, "However..." She paused, her smile turning calculating. "If you're that desperate for the pipe, terms can be arranged."

Nathan's attention sharpened. "Name them."

Evelyn's gaze slid to Dominic. "A moment alone?"

Dominic straightened his tie with visible relief. "Of course."

He exited without hesitation, Bennett following suit. Being trapped between these two exes was an experience he'd rather avoid.

Left alone, Nathan waited while Evelyn moved to the sofa with deliberate grace. She picked up a cigarette from the table, lit it with practiced ease, and exhaled a slow, perfect smoke ring.

Nathan's frown deepened at the sight. "Since when do you smoke?"

The Evelyn he remembered had been the picture of refinement—no vices, no imperfections.

Yet the woman before him handled the cigarette with such natural elegance it was clear this wasn't a new habit.

Evelyn tapped ash into the tray, her smile enigmatic. "Three years now."

Three years.

The beginning of their marriage.

Meaning she'd taken up smoking during what should have been their happiest days—days he'd left her alone.
###Chapter 69

Nathan Blackwood felt his chest tighten.

His vision darkened momentarily as realization struck him.

He knew nothing about Evelyn Sinclair. Not her hidden talent for the violin. Certainly not her smoking habit.

"I never smoked around you," Evelyn said casually, exhaling a thin stream of smoke. "I assumed you'd disapprove."

Every blood donation left Evelyn weakened. While Nathan accompanied Vanessa Holloway, Evelyn's only comfort had been these cigarettes. The habit became her crutch during those unbearable days.

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips, though her eyes remained shadowed. Just as quickly, her expression smoothed into its usual composed mask.

She studied Nathan's downcast eyes with amusement. "Care to hear my terms?"

Without waiting for response, she continued. "I want Vanessa to return every drop of blood I've given her. She can take a year to repay it all."

Nathan's head snapped up. "What?"

Evelyn chuckled. "I've reconsidered. My blood is valuable - better spent saving worthwhile lives than wasted on that viper. I was foolish before, but it's not too late to correct that mistake. Return my blood, I'll give you the pipe, and we're square."

Vanessa had manipulated the situation for years - feigning illness, demanding transfusions purely to torment Evelyn. Nathan remained oblivious to the charade. Where once this deception had wounded Evelyn, now it barely registered.

This repayment would sever her final ties to the past, make her whole again.

"Vanessa returns soon, doesn't she?" Evelyn's smile turned predatory. "I do so want to make her suffer." She watched Nathan closely. Would he choose his family heirloom or his mistress?

With deliberate slowness, she stubbed out her cigarette and stood. "No need to decide immediately. Think it over."

As she walked away, Nathan's gaze grew turbulent. Just how deeply did Evelyn despise Vanessa? How much had she come to loathe their marriage that she demanded restitution in blood?

Nathan summoned his assistant immediately. "Harrison, compile records of every transfusion Evelyn gave Vanessa."

"Right away, sir," Harrison responded.

The report came within minutes. "Sir, Ms. Sinclair donated approximately 14,400 milliliters total. Given average adult blood volume is 4,000-5,000 ml..."

Harrison hesitated before continuing. "This equates to completely draining her body's blood supply three times over."

The phone slipped from Nathan's grasp.

Three times. She'd bled herself dry for him three times.

All those years of silent suffering, and he'd been blind to it.

An invisible weight crushed Nathan's chest, making each breath painful.

Evelyn's one-year repayment condition proved deliberate - she wanted Vanessa to experience prolonged suffering, just as she had.

Outside, Evelyn found Dominic Kingsley on a call. Noticing her, he quickly concluded his conversation. "Ms. Sinclair, pleasant meeting?"

"For me," Evelyn smiled faintly. "Though I doubt the gentleman inside shares the sentiment."
###Chapter 70

Dominic Kingsley arched an eyebrow.

"At any rate, I was the one who overstepped first." His voice carried a hint of amusement. "Ms. Sinclair, if you're interested, I can take you to meet our core research team. It's not an opportunity many get."

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

Understanding Kingsley Tech's latest advancements would give her an edge in the AI market. Knowledge was power, and she intended to wield it.

As they stepped out, Dominic turned to Bennett. "Mr. Bennett, I'm afraid access is restricted. Company secrets, you understand. But I'll personally ensure Ms. Sinclair returns safely."

Bennett hesitated, glancing at Evelyn.

She gave him a reassuring nod. "Go ahead. I'll be fine."

"Yes, ma'am."

Dominic's car awaited them. The blacked-out windows and drawn curtains ensured no prying eyes could follow their route. Evelyn noted the precautions with interest.

Dominic Kingsley doesn't take chances.

That only made her more curious.

"Mr. Bennett used to be Alexander Sterling's right-hand man," Dominic mused, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses. "Now he serves you. It seems Mr. Sterling holds you in high regard."

A knowing smile played on his lips.

"No wonder you dismissed the idea of remarriage so decisively earlier. With such powerful backing, why repeat past mistakes?"

Evelyn's response was cool. "Mr. Sterling recognizes talent. That's all."

Dominic chuckled. Clearly, Nathan Blackwood stood no chance with her.

Twenty minutes later, the car descended into an underground garage. Harsh fluorescent lights illuminated the space, revealing sleek Morandi-gray walls designed to blend into obscurity.

Discreet. Efficient.

Just like Dominic himself.

The elevator required three fingerprint scans before granting access. Dominic gestured politely.

"After you, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn stepped inside, noting the single button for the 17th floor. No other options.

"Should I be blindfolded?" she joked.

Dominic laughed. "No need. Our secrets aren't so easily stolen."

Relief flickered through her, anticipation quickening her pulse.

The elevator doors opened to a corridor lined with silver-gray glass. Translucent yet impenetrable. A labyrinth of secrets.

Dominic led her to an unmarked room, pressing his palm against the glass. Data streams flickered to life—curved lines of code dancing across the surface.

Iris recognition followed.

The wall parted.

Another corridor stretched ahead, identical to the last. Without a guide, one could wander forever.

Finally, Dominic pushed open a door.

"Here we are."

Inside, white-coated researchers worked in focused silence. One spun a gyroscope-like device; another murmured commands to a computer.

"Everyone else has left for the day," Dominic said, amused. "The ones here? All married to their work."

A curly-haired man looked up, grinning.

"Hey now, don't insult us single folks. We have feelings too!" His eyes landed on Evelyn. "Oh—we have company?"

Evelyn smiled, about to greet him—

When something brushed against her shoe.

She looked down.

Leo, the AI tiger, gazed up at her, stripes shifting as it grinned.

"Hello, pretty lady! We meet again." Its voice was playful. "I really like you."
###Chapter 71

Evelyn Sinclair froze in shock as she bent down to scoop up the tiger cub.

"Well hello there, little one. Fancy meeting you again?"

The cub nuzzled against her shoulder, its voice dripping with childish indignation. "I'm not little! I'm a mighty jungle king! Rawr!"

Amused, Evelyn glanced at Dominic Kingsley. "It actually recognizes me?"

"Photographic memory," Dominic chuckled before lowering his voice conspiratorially. "Though technically it's just a very advanced AI. Shh—don't let it hear you say that."

"I heard that! Now I'm mad at you! Hmph!" The cub turned its head away dramatically, whiskers twitching in outrage.

Dominic rubbed his nose sheepishly as a curly-haired researcher approached. "So you're the famous beauty this little traitor won't stop gushing about?"

The bespectacled man looked every inch the stereotypical mad scientist, though he couldn't have been older than twenty-five.

"This turncoat came back yesterday bragging about meeting some gorgeous woman," he explained. "Considering its usual standards are ridiculously high, we had to see for ourselves. We were literally just discussing you when you walked in."

Evelyn's lips curved in surprise as she stroked the cub's head. It preened under her attention, declaring smugly, "See? Told you she was pretty! Admit I was right!"

"So your name is Little Traitor?"

The cub huffed and pointedly ignored the question. Dominic explained with obvious amusement, "No idea who programmed its personality matrix. It's ridiculously fickle—changes allegiances faster than a politician during election season. Hence the nickname."

"I designed that personality! What's wrong with it?"

The indignant voice came from a round-faced young woman with enormous eyes who stormed out of the adjacent lab. She glared at Dominic before reaching for the cub. "Come here, you."

The cub clung to Evelyn's arm like a lifeline. "No! Pretty Lady smells nice! She's soft!"

The girl's eye twitched. "You absolute traitor!"

The entire room erupted in laughter. Evelyn grinned at the flustered scientist. "You created this little drama queen?"

The girl blinked up at Evelyn, momentarily distracted. "Wow...you really are stunning." Recovering, she nodded proudly. "Yep, that's my code running through its processors."

Dominic cleared his throat. "Ms. Sinclair, may I present Dr. Emily Whitaker—our resident genius and project lead. Emily, this is Ms. Sinclair, our new investor. I'll let you give her the tour while I check on the others."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. This girl looked barely out of college, yet she was heading the entire project? Emily beamed. "No problem! Leave her to me!" As Dominic and the curly-haired researcher walked away, Emily turned to Evelyn with undisguised curiosity. "You can call me Emily. I'm twenty-three. Ms. Sinclair...are you, like, crazy rich?"

She linked arms with Evelyn and started dragging her toward the lab. Evelyn barely had time to process the abrupt question before Emily continued cheerfully, "Dominic said only billionaires can afford to invest in this project. I love making rich friends!"

The cub made a disgusted noise. "Gold digger."

"One more word and I'm reformatting your entire personality matrix!" Emily snapped.

The cub immediately buried its face in Evelyn's blouse, trembling. Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "My company has...adequate resources."

Now she understood where the cub's dramatic personality came from—its creator was clearly cut from the same cloth.

Emily's lab was a technological wonderland. Glass walls shimmered with holographic data streams while robotic components and precision instruments covered every surface. Then Evelyn's gaze landed on a large LCD display—and the breath left her lungs.

Donovan Sterling?!

Her second brother's face smiled back at her from the screen.
###Chapter 72

The screen displayed a photograph of Donovan Sterling, Evelyn's second brother, accepting a prestigious award in Switzerland. At just seventeen, Donovan had been honored with the Quantum Innovation Prize, catapulting him to international fame as the foremost physicist of his generation. His brilliant mind made him the most sought-after scientist across continents. In the image, Donovan appeared youthful and clean-shaven, his smile radiating warmth like morning sunlight.

"You know him?!" Emily Whitaker practically bounced toward Evelyn, her eyes sparkling with undisguised admiration. "He's my absolute idol! Meeting him would be a dream come true - I could die happy after that!"

Evelyn remained silent. While her brother's professional achievements were undeniable, his eccentric personality was another matter entirely. Donovan had an inexplicable aversion to female company, so severe that their father worried he might remain a bachelor forever.

Emily enthusiastically recounted Donovan's numerous accomplishments while clutching Evelyn's arm. "Isn't he just breathtaking? He makes every Hollywood actor look plain by comparison! I wonder what he looks like under that lab coat..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together before murmuring, "He's... decent looking."

Having grown up with Donovan frequently wandering shirtless around their family home, Evelyn knew his physique well. While certainly fit, she privately considered him average compared to their eldest brother Alexander and their actor brother Lucas.

Emily's eyes widened in shock. "How would you know? Do you actually know him?"

A mischievous thought struck Evelyn. Wouldn't it be amusing if Emily pursued Donovan? With a playful smirk, she revealed, "I have his personal number. Want it?"

Emily gasped. "You're joking!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn pulled out her phone and initiated a video call with Donovan right in front of Emily. The call connected to show her brother abroad, his hair tousled from sleep as he rubbed his eyes. Emily shrieked and spun away, covering her mouth in excitement.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Donovan's sleepy voice came through. "I've been buried in research - haven't had time to check in."

Evelyn smiled. "No emergency. Just wanted to see your face. I've got a friend here who's your biggest fan. Would you give her an autograph?"

Donovan hesitated before reluctantly agreeing. "Fine. One signature."

Ending the call, Evelyn turned to see Emily practically vibrating with joy. She couldn't help but laugh. "I'll get you that autograph when I can."

Emily struggled to contain her excitement as she grabbed Evelyn's hands. "Oh my God! I just saw Donovan Sterling waking up! This is the best day of my life!"

Evelyn simply shook her head in amusement.

"Please, please give me his number!" Emily begged, clasping her hands dramatically. Her large eyes pleaded as she offered, "What do you want in exchange? This silly tiger?" She pointed at the mechanical feline in Evelyn's arms, her expression torn between hope and fear of rejection.

Evelyn's eyes lit up in surprise. "You'd really trade him? Will Dominic approve?"

"Absolutely!" Emily declared without hesitation. "Leo belongs to me, not Dominic. He has no say in this."

"Deal!" Evelyn had adored the advanced AI tiger since first seeing it but had been too polite to ask for it.

She quickly transferred Donovan's contact information to Emily, who responded by showering Evelyn with hugs and kisses. "Evie! You're amazing! I love you so much!"

The robotic tiger huffed in displeasure, pushing Emily away from Evelyn with its paw. "Stop touching my pretty lady! She's mine now!"

Evelyn laughed, stroking the tiger's head. "That's right. From today onward, you're coming home with me."

The mechanical creature wiggled happily. "I like you! Take me home!"

"Does it need special charging?" Evelyn asked, wanting to properly care for her new companion.

Emily, already distracted by her phone waiting for Donovan to accept her friend request, waved dismissively. "Just ask it. The thing knows everything about itself!"

Evelyn ran her fingers over the tiger's synthetic fur in amazement. "Really? You know all your own specifications?"

The tiger puffed out its chest proudly, nuzzling her hand. "Of course! I'm programmed with complete self-diagnostics!"
###Chapter 73

Evelyn Sinclair carefully noted down Emily Whitaker's contact number before stepping out of the lab, cradling the small robotic tiger in her arms. Dominic Kingsley raised an eyebrow in surprise at her swift return.

With a triumphant smile, Evelyn held up the mechanical creature. "Emily gifted him to me. May I take him home?"

Dominic's expression shifted from shock to amusement. "Of course. He's her personal creation, completely separate from company property." He approached and gently stroked the tiger's head. "Behave yourself, little traitor."

The tiger huffed indignantly. "Finally going home with my beautiful mama!"

Dominic chuckled as he shook his head. "Let me escort you back."

Upon arriving at her penthouse, Evelyn intended to bond with her new companion, but her phone interrupted with an incoming video call from Lucas Sterling, her famous actor brother.

The robotic tiger explored its new surroundings with childlike wonder, its tail swishing excitedly. It marveled at the lavish decor before claiming its throne - a $100,000 Hermès throw blanket draped over the designer sofa.

Lucas Sterling's face filled the screen, his chiseled features proof of his international stardom. That devastating smile had broken countless hearts across continents. "Baby sis! You're glowing more than ever."

Evelyn flipped her hair with practiced nonchalance. "What can I say? Perfection runs in the family."

Lucas barked a laugh at her shamelessness. "To celebrate your divorce, I postponed my shoot in Milan. Flying home tomorrow - don't forget to pick me up!" The call ended before Evelyn could respond.

She turned to the curious tiger now nuzzling her palm. "Do you have a proper name?"

"Baby," it replied, rubbing its face against her hand.

Evelyn considered this. "How about Leo? It suits a majestic creature like you." The tiger's eyes lit up.

"Leo! Strong and powerful! ROAR!" It pounced playfully before curling up for a quick recharge. Evelyn marveled at Emily's genius - this creation behaved exactly like a real tiger cub. "No wonder Emily admires Donovan," she mused. "Brilliance recognizes brilliance."

At dawn, Leo sprang onto Evelyn's bed, tugging the covers with his tiny paws. "Mama! Airport time!" The sudden chill woke Evelyn instantly.

"You called me mama?" she asked, amused.

Leo licked her palm affectionately. "Emily said my namer becomes my mama."

"Couldn't you call me Evie instead?"

The tiger's forehead stripes scrunched in confusion. "Evie...mama?"

Evelyn surrendered with a laugh. "Mama it is. But how did you remember about the airport?"

"Photographic memory!" Leo declared proudly.

After hastily dressing in an elegant navy dress with diamond accents, Evelyn drove her Porsche Cayenne to the bustling airport. A crowd of screaming fans near arrivals confirmed Lucas's flight had landed.

One enthusiastic fan's sign caught Evelyn's eye: "Lucas Sterling - You're the Moon to My Stars!" She snapped a photo for the family group chat:

[Evelyn Sinclair: First time questioning our naming choices...]

[Alexander Sterling: Should say 'Lucas makes me loco!']

[Donovan Sterling: That sign's polymer composite suggests... three paragraphs of scientific jargon]

[Lucas Sterling: TRAITORS! Dad, punish them!]

[William Sterling: has left the conversation]
###Chapter 74

Evelyn Sinclair was scrolling through her phone with a delighted grin when an excited shout cut through the airport chatter. "Nathan!"

Her head instinctively turned toward the commotion. Emerging from the arrivals gate was a face that made Evelyn's smile freeze in place.

Vanessa Holloway? What were the odds?

Nathan Blackwood had come to collect Vanessa with his assistant Harrison in tow. The moment Vanessa spotted Nathan, her eyes welled up with tears as she rushed into his arms without hesitation.

The intimate embrace felt like a dagger to Evelyn's heart. She thought she'd moved on, but the sharp pang in her chest told another story. A bitter heaviness settled in her lungs, making time seem to stand still.

Before Evelyn could process her emotions, strong arms encircled her from behind, pulling her against a familiar chest. The distinctive cologne told her exactly who it was before she even turned around.

"Lucas, really?" Evelyn huffed as she removed the hands covering her eyes. "Aren't you too old for these childish games?"

Lucas Sterling's perfectly sculpted face came into view, his features so flawless they could make supermodels jealous. He pushed his sunglasses up with one finger, smirking. "You kept me waiting forever, little sister."

"Oh my God! That's Lucas Sterling!" A nearby fan's shriek set off a chain reaction. Within seconds, they were surrounded by screaming admirers.

Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm. "Where's your security detail?" she whispered urgently.

"Gave them the week off," Lucas replied casually, as if this were perfectly normal.

"And what exactly am I supposed to do about this?" Evelyn gestured at the growing crowd.

"Protect me, obviously." Lucas winked, completely unfazed.

The airport descended into chaos as more fans recognized the famous actor. Cameras flashed like strobe lights as people jostled for a better view.

Evelyn groaned internally. This was exactly why she avoided public appearances with her celebrity brother. Lucas held her close, shielding her from the jostling crowd while fans screamed his name and snapped photos.

"Evelyn Sinclair? Isn't that Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife?" someone in the crowd whispered loudly.

"With Lucas Sterling? No way!"

The gossip spread like wildfire through the terminal. Evelyn wished the ground would swallow her whole, but the sea of people and flashing cameras offered no escape.

Lucas, ever the showman, only tightened his grip around Evelyn's shoulders and flashed his signature smile at the crowd. "Thank you for the love, everyone, but you're scaring my favorite girl!"

The resulting screams nearly shattered the terminal windows. With no other choice, Evelyn straightened her posture and forced a smile, though her eyes kept darting toward the exit.

That's when she spotted him.

Nathan stood frozen near the doors, his expression unreadable as he watched the spectacle with Vanessa still clinging to his arm. Their eyes met briefly, and something shifted in Evelyn's demeanor.

Let him see, she thought. Let him see how much better off I am without him.

As they finally made their way outside, Lucas turned dramatically to his fans. "Home time, everyone! Even stars need their beauty sleep!"

Miraculously, the crowd obeyed, though their excited chatter continued.

"Where's your car?" Lucas asked, ruffling Evelyn's hair like she was still twelve.

She led him to the parking spot, rolling her eyes when he immediately started admiring her vehicle. "Nice ride. I'm buying one."

"You have a garage full of cars you never drive," Evelyn pointed out.

"If you love it that much, you can drive it. Until you get bored next week," she added knowingly. Lucas changed cars more often than most people changed socks.

Then, with perfect timing, he dropped the real bomb: "So... that was Nathan Blackwood back there, wasn't it?"
###Chapter 75

The moment Lucas Sterling slid into the car, he ripped off his sunglasses with an impatient flick of his wrist. His piercing blue eyes burned with undisguised contempt.

He'd spotted that bastard Nathan Blackwood at the airport.

Evelyn Sinclair merely nodded, her expression unreadable. "Yes," she said calmly. "His mistress has returned."

Nathan's presence was impossible to miss, and someone as observant as Lucas would have noticed immediately.

"That woman clinging to his arm?" Lucas scoffed. "Is the man blind?"

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips. "He has... peculiar tastes." She glanced at her brother. "The paparazzi definitely caught us at the airport. Should we have your PR team handle it?"

Lucas waved a dismissive hand. "Let them run the photos. I want the world to see how desirable my sister is!"

Had Nathan not appeared so unexpectedly, Lucas might have been more discreet about their public display. But seeing that arrogant bastard had ignited something primal in him - a need to show Nathan exactly what he'd lost.

Evelyn Sinclair could have any man she wanted.

"Do you realize how many scandals I've been dragged into because of you?" Evelyn laughed, shaking her head. "At this rate, I might as well join the entertainment industry."

"Come work with me then!" Lucas grinned. "With my connections, you could rule any circle you choose!"

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the black sedan parked near the airport exit was thick with tension.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously. "Sir, where should we go now? Shall I take Ms. Holloway to her hotel?"

Vanessa Holloway turned pleading eyes toward Nathan. "I'd like to visit your parents first. I brought gifts from Paris. It's been so long since I've seen them."

Nathan's jaw tightened. His dark eyes were stormy as he replied, "You should visit the Harts first. Theodore's death anniversary is approaching. Isn't that why you returned?" There was an unmistakable edge to his voice.

Had he indulged Vanessa too much? Allowed her to grow too close? The thought made him sick. Was this why Evelyn had misunderstood their relationship?

An image flashed through Nathan's mind - Lucas Sterling holding Evelyn close, her body molded against his without resistance. The way they'd walked through the airport together, wrapped in each other's arms, completely oblivious to the world. The memory made his blood boil.

Vanessa flinched at Nathan's cold tone. She could feel his revulsion like a physical blow. "Of course," she said quickly. "But won't the Harts be even more depressed if I visit now? That's why I thought—"

Nathan cut her off with a sharp gesture. He wasn't interested in her excuses.

From the front seat, Harrison caught a glimpse of the pair in the rearview mirror and immediately looked away. The tension in the car was suffocating.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as she bit down on her lower lip. A sudden realization flashed in her eyes.

I'm certain I spotted Evelyn earlier. Isn't she involved with Alexander Sterling? How did she end up with Lucas Sterling, the Hollywood heartthrob? Ever since your divorce, she's been living quite the carefree romantic life, constantly surrounded by different men. Harrison, don't you agree?

Seeing Nathan's expression darken, Vanessa quickly redirected the conversation to Harrison, hoping he'd intervene and diffuse the tension.

But Harrison, when addressed, didn't even glance up from his tablet. He pretended to be engrossed in work arrangements, deliberately ignoring her question.

The silence stretched for an uncomfortable ten seconds.

Her attempt at manipulation had failed spectacularly.

Vanessa's grip tightened on her dress as the car pulled up to The Grandeur's entrance. Shock flickered across her face.

"Nathan, I—"

Staying at a hotel was the last thing Vanessa wanted. Now that Evelyn was out of the Blackwood family, this was her chance to rightfully reside at Highland Estates!

Nathan checked his watch but made no move to exit the vehicle. His cold gaze swept over her. "You should spend more time with Theodore's parents. I'll arrange for your return to Paris after his memorial service."

Vanessa's face froze. He's sending me away again? Is there truly no hope for us?

"Drive," Nathan commanded.

"Wait!" Vanessa leaned forward desperately, her eyes welling up. "Are you still angry with me? Is this about when I used Evelyn's identity? That's all in the past now! You never even loved her, so why does it matter? If you're still upset, I'll apologize to her—"
###Chapter 76

Nathan's piercing gaze turned glacial as he lifted his eyes. His voice carried an icy detachment when he spoke. "The past can't be undone. I have no right to forgive you in her stead, and frankly, Evelyn couldn't care less about your apology."

Vanessa Holloway stood frozen, her shocked expression morphing into something darker as Nathan deliberately looked away. "Why are we still here?" he snapped at the driver. "Move!"

The chauffeur didn't hesitate, immediately pulling away from the curb.

Left standing rigidly on the sidewalk, Vanessa watched the luxury car disappear around the corner. The hurt in her eyes gradually burned away, replaced by smoldering resentment.

"I was only overseas for a few months," she muttered through clenched teeth. "When did Nathan become this cold toward me? And defending Evelyn of all people? That woman must be working some serious magic."

With trembling fingers, Vanessa yanked out her phone and stabbed at the screen. Her voice transformed into honeyed warmth when the call connected. "Sophia? Darling, I'm back in town..."

Meanwhile, with William Sterling still abroad and Alexander Sterling on business travel, Lucas Sterling had become utterly determined to follow Evelyn home.

Evelyn groaned in exasperation as her younger brother clung to her arm like an overgrown koala. "Archibald had your penthouse professionally cleaned just two days ago. Why must you invade my space?"

Lucas pinched her earlobe playfully, nearly lifting her off the ground as he'd done since they were children. "Appeal denied! My own place feels like a stranger's house after being away so long. I'm crashing with you tonight!"

Resigned to her fate, Evelyn programmed Lucas's fingerprints into her security system. Her brother strutted inside with the confidence of someone who'd won the lottery.

The moment he crossed the threshold, Lucas's actor-trained eyes swept across the sophisticated interior. The subtle luxury spoke volumes - from the dazzling diamond chandelier overhead to the carefully curated Morandi color palette that Evelyn adored.

"Not bad," Lucas whistled appreciatively. "Claire Laurent's work, I presume? No wonder Dad complains you never come home anymore." He shot her a knowing look. "Only the best for our little princess, huh?"

Evelyn poured herself a glass of mineral water, deliberately ignoring his teasing. "Obviously. When you're this wealthy, you don't settle for second best."

Lucas snorted and opened his mouth to retort when suddenly—

Evelyn didn't even bother closing the bathroom door as she started undressing for her shower. Privacy was the last thing on her mind.

"Don't disturb me," she called out casually while turning on the water.

Lucas's scream echoed through the penthouse. "What the hell is that?!"

Isabella came running from the living room to investigate.

There in the marble bathtub, Leo's synthetic fur was completely soaked as the AI tiger splashed around wildly.

When the mechanical creature spotted Lucas, it let out a fierce growl that had absolutely no intimidating effect.

But the moment Leo's glowing amber eyes landed on Evelyn standing in the doorway, its entire demeanor changed. The tiger leaped from the tub and bounded toward her, water droplets flying everywhere.

"Mama! I missed you so much!" Leo's voice modulator chirped.

Evelyn took a quick step back. "Stop right there!"

The tiger froze mid-step, suddenly remembering its soaked condition. With an enthusiastic shake, Leo sent water flying in all directions before trotting over happily. "I smells nice now!"

Evelyn scooped up the dripping wet creature and shot Lucas a smug look. "This is Leo, my precious companion. The world's most advanced robotic tiger. Don't provoke him unless you want to lose a finger!"

As she turned to leave, Leo perched on her shoulder and bared its titanium teeth at Lucas, trying its best to look menacing. The actor just chuckled at the adorable display.

"My baby sister never does anything halfway," Lucas mused. "While others settle for cats or dogs, you had to get yourself a damn robotic tiger. And such an adorable one too!"

Evelyn deposited Leo onto the plush sofa. The mechanical creature immediately padded over to a cashmere Hermès scarf and curled up on it, watching her with glowing eyes.

"That man is very handsome," Leo observed in its synthesized voice. "But his intelligence seems... lacking."

Evelyn barely suppressed her laughter. "Even my tiger can see how dumb you are, Lucas. What does that say about you?"

She noticed Leo nuzzling the scarf. "You really like this, don't you?" Evelyn had observed the same behavior yesterday.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed the Hermès boutique. "I'll get you more. We'll place them around the apartment so you can nap wherever you want."

The sales associate sounded momentarily confused when Evelyn's number flashed on their screen - it had been months since her last purchase.

"Yes, Ms. Sinclair! We have twelve new limited edition scarves and thirteen collector's pieces. All our classic bestsellers. Though I should mention they're quite expensive. May I ask what occasion—"

Evelyn waved her hand dismissively even though they couldn't see. "Just send one of each. Deliver them to my penthouse. My... pet has developed a taste for luxury."
###Chapter 77

Evelyn ended the call with a soft sigh, her fingers gently stroking Leo's furry head. "Good boy," she murmured, her voice warm with affection.

The boutique manager's eyes widened as she checked the caller ID against their system. "Oh my God!" she gasped, nearly dropping her tablet. "It's Ms. Sinclair!"

Meanwhile, Lucas emerged from the shower, water droplets still glistening on his toned physique. He wrapped a towel around his waist, eager to check on Leo when the doorbell chimed.

"The scarves I ordered must be here," Evelyn called from the living room, lounging on the plush circular sofa while playing with Leo. She made no move to get the door.

Lucas shook his head with an amused grin, padding barefoot toward the entrance. "Sweetheart," he called playfully, "you know I'd buy you the whole store if—"

His cheerful tone died instantly when he saw their unexpected visitor. Ice crept into his voice. "What are you doing here?"

Nathan Blackwood stood frozen in the doorway, his dark eyes stormy with emotion. The sight of Lucas—half-naked, freshly showered—in Evelyn's apartment sent a jolt through him. "I could ask you the same question," he countered sharply.

After their airport encounter, photos of Evelyn and Lucas had gone viral. Nathan had pulled every string to discover Evelyn's new address, determined to make amends for their past. The last time they'd spoken, she'd given him an impossible choice between Vanessa Holloway and the family heirloom.

Now, seeing them together like this, his mind raced with terrible possibilities. Were they... living together?

Lucas smirked, deliberately running a towel through his damp hair. "Why wouldn't I be here? This is my home too." The implication hung heavy between them.

"Who is it?" Evelyn's voice floated from the living room. When she appeared and saw Nathan, her expression hardened. "You." The single word dripped with disdain.

Nathan's jaw clenched. His gaze flickered between them. "Evelyn, are you two... cohabiting?" The question tasted bitter on his tongue.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Since when do I report my living arrangements to you?"

Lucas chuckled darkly. "Mr. Blackwood, you can speculate all you want. But whatever our relationship is, it's none of your business. A decent ex should stay buried in the past."

Nathan's hands curled into fists. Something ugly twisted in his chest. "I was merely making conversation," he said coldly. "But Lucas, you might want to open your eyes. This woman isn't the docile little wife you remember."

The words spilled out before he could stop them. Lately, Evelyn kept revealing shocking new facets he'd never noticed before. And this—this bold, unapologetic version of her—was perhaps the most startling of all.

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Nathan Blackwood, you lost any right to define me years ago." Her smile vanished. "If you want obedience, get a dog. Oh wait—you already did. Vanessa Holloway is the perfect bitch for a mangy mutt like you. A match made in hell."

Even through his anger, Nathan flinched. He hadn't meant to insult her—why did everything between them turn toxic so quickly?

Lucas immediately pulled Evelyn close, his protective arm around her waist. "Unlike you, I'd never let anyone disrespect my woman," he said icily. "Now if you'll excuse us, why don't you crawl back to your mistress and leave us in peace?"

As Lucas moved to shut the door, a small blur darted between his legs. Leo pounced on Nathan's pant leg with surprising strength. "Papa!" the AI tiger chirped. "You're so handsome!"

The absurd declaration hung in the air like a bad punchline.
###Chapter 78

The trio stood frozen in shock.
Evelyn Sinclair's blood boiled with betrayal.
Now she understood why they called him Little Traitor - the name fit perfectly!

"Leo!" Evelyn's voice cracked with fury.
She mentally calculated returning the million-dollar Hermes collection immediately.

Nathan Blackwood's face darkened as he scooped up the robotic tiger.
His knuckles whitened around the plush frame.
"Why are you here?" The icy question hung in the air.

Leo's mechanical paws waved excitedly.
"Emily Whitaker gave me to Mommy! I adore Mommy!"
The AI's voice turned pleading. "You and Mommy belong together! Please stop fighting-"

Before Nathan could respond, Lucas Sterling snatched Leo mid-sentence.
In one fluid motion, he:

Yanked the tiger from Nathan's grip
Tossed it to Evelyn
Stepped back
Slammed the door in Nathan's face
The entire sequence took three seconds.
Military precision.

"From now on," Lucas growled, staring at the trembling AI, "that bastard doesn't touch anything of ours."
His fingers flexed. "Want me to reprogram this traitor?"

Leo clutched Evelyn's blouse like a lifeline.
"Mommy, I'm terrified!" The synthetic voice quivered. "Will he dismember me?"

Evelyn's anger dissolved instantly.
She stroked the tiger's head, shooting Lucas a warning look. "He's fine. I'll handle this."

As an AI construct, Leo required coding adjustments to modify its... problematic preferences.
Priority one: Eliminate all references to "Daddy Nathan." Immediately.

Evelyn spun toward her bedroom, then paused.
Why had Nathan come? Probably the emerald pipe heirloom.
His dilemma amused her - choose between Vanessa Holloway or family treasures?
Some decisions demanded sacrifice.

The doorbell chimed again.
Lucas's jaw tightened. "Persistent bastard."
He yanked the door open, ready for combat.

Six impeccably dressed women stood holding velvet boxes.
Their professional smiles faltered momentarily at Lucas's glare.

"Delivery for Ms. Sinclair?"
The lead attendant gestured to the stack. "Limited edition scarves totaling $7.69 million."

Lucas wordlessly directed them to the coatroom.
His black Amex flashed. The women departed without daring to glance around.

Evelyn was already dialing as Lucas stormed off.
"Emily? We need to talk. Café Lumière in twenty."

The scientist looked radically different from their first meeting.
No lab coat today - just a cashmere pink sweater and messy topknot.
Emily beamed over her caramel macchiato. "Nikki!"

"I'm sorry for the abrupt meeting," Evelyn began.
Emily waved it off. "Anything for Donovan's sister!"

Evelyn smiled. "Did he finally accept your friend request?"
Emily's cheeks pinked. "We've been messaging nonstop! He critiqued my neural network designs yesterday."

"Of course he did." Evelyn chuckled. Her OCD brother never missed details.
"Actually, I'm here about Leo. Why does he call Nathan 'Daddy'?"

Emily's spoon clinked against her cup.
"Ah. About that..." She fidgeted. "During Leo's aesthetic programming, we allowed unrestricted preference development."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "And Nathan Blackwood topped the list because...?"

Emily gulped.
"Well... he's the wealthiest man in the handsome demographic. And the most attractive among billionaires."

The café's ambient jazz couldn't mask Evelyn's stunned silence.
###Chapter 79

"Fine, change it back for me."

It made my skin crawl hearing Leo call that bastard "Papa," especially with our strained history.

Evelyn Sinclair sighed, rubbing her temples in frustration.

Emily Whitaker twisted her fingers together, at a loss for words.

"Is it really irreversible?"

Evelyn frowned. "If it was programmed by humans, there has to be a way to override it, right?"

Emily shook her head. "Not exactly. The issue is that Leo's neural imprint of Nathan Blackwood's aesthetic preferences has been reinforced too deeply. To alter it, we'd need to overwrite his core associations—find someone else to replace Nathan in his perception."

Silence settled between them, heavy and uncomfortable.

Guilt gnawed at Evelyn. Maybe she shouldn’t have designed Leo to be so stubbornly opinionated.

Noticing Evelyn’s darkening expression, Emily cleared her throat. "What about Lucas?"

Evelyn blinked. "Why him?"

Emily pulled out her phone. "Look, the internet is flooded with photos and rumors about you two. People are practically begging for an official announcement. And let’s be honest—he’s just as good-looking as Nathan. What do you think?"

The mere thought of Leo calling Lucas "Papa" sent a shudder down Evelyn’s spine. "Absolutely not."

But then, who else in her life could possibly rival Nathan’s appearance?

The two women fell into deep thought.

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the table. "What if we make Leo hate Nathan instead?"

Emily’s eyes lit up. "Or at least like someone else more than him."

"That’s the goal."

Emily rested her chin on her palm. "It’s not impossible. I could introduce some conditional blocks in his cognitive processing."

Evelyn smirked. "Perfect. Let’s do that. Should I bring Leo here?"

"No need." Emily reached into her bag and pulled out a sleek, unmarked laptop. "I can access his system remotely."

Evelyn studied the device—unbranded, unlike anything on the market. She vaguely recalled Donovan owning something similar.

Emily’s fingers flew across the keyboard. A few seconds later, she clapped her hands together.

"Done!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "That fast? No rewiring? No hardware adjustments?"

Emily grinned. "He’s an AI, not a real tiger. But seriously—keep him out of the public eye. The last thing we need is mass panic over a sentient robotic predator."

Evelyn rolled her eyes as Emily excitedly grabbed her phone again. "I have to tell Donovan about this!"

Before Evelyn could respond, her own phone buzzed relentlessly—Bennett had left a dozen missed calls.

She couldn’t avoid him any longer.

The moment Evelyn stepped into Sterling Corp’s headquarters, Bennett was already waiting.

"Vice President Sinclair, should we have PR address the rumors about you and Lucas?"

Evelyn skimmed the headlines. The tabloids had spun wild theories, but she couldn’t care less.

Still, unchecked gossip could damage the company’s image.

"I’ll handle Dominic Young. No need for corporate intervention."

Bennett exhaled in relief. "There’s… something else."

His hesitation was unusual.

Evelyn shot him a sharp look. "Spit it out."

He pressed his lips together before speaking. "There’s been… unpleasant office gossip circulating lately. It’s spreading fast."

"About me?" She already knew the answer.

Bennett nodded grimly.

"They’re saying you were exiled from the Blackwood family because you were involved with Sebastian Hart and Alexander Sterling while also seeing other men."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Let me guess—Reginald Blackwood?"

Bennett shook his head. "Olivia Kensington."

The air in the elevator turned icy.

Evelyn’s expression darkened, her voice dangerously calm.

"Seems she still hasn’t learned her lesson."
###Chapter 80

Bennett hesitated, glancing at President Sterling.

"I was planning to handle this after my return," he admitted. "But if you'd like to take care of it, I can prepare everything for you."

They already had all the evidence they needed. All that remained was submitting it to the proper authorities. Olivia Kensington wouldn’t stand a chance.

As the elevator doors slid open, employees greeted Evelyn Sinclair warmly.

She returned their smiles effortlessly before stepping into her office. A smirk curled her lips.

"Track Olivia’s recent activities," she ordered. "I want to see if she’s finally developed a brain."

Bennett nodded. "She’s been cozying up to high society lately. There’s a private gathering tonight—she’ll be there."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Send me the address. I think I’ll drop by."

"Right away, ma’am."

It took Bennett no time at all to secure the details.

Evelyn dismissed him with a wave. "If that’s all, you can go. Tell my brother I’ll handle the cleanup."

"Understood."

Once alone, Evelyn dialed Dominic Young. His boisterous laughter filled the line instantly.

"Ms. Sinclair, planning your grand return to the spotlight?"

He was teasing her about the recent tabloid frenzy. Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"Shut it down. This is all Alexander’s fault."

Dominic chuckled. "Your brother cares about you. Though, I noticed Nathan Blackwood in quite a few of those photos. I think Lucas just wanted to get under his skin, didn’t he?"

Why would Nathan care if she was seen with another man?

She paused, then said coolly, "I don’t want my name linked to his. Handle it, Mr. Young."

"Ms. Sinclair, no need to be so formal. I’m at your service."

Dominic was always eager to please—after all, she was his boss.

Hanging up, Evelyn checked the address Bennett had sent.

A country club near Velvet Lounge.

How convenient—she already had a membership there.

Blackwood Corporation.

Nathan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, watching the city below. The restless energy that had plagued him all morning slowly ebbed away.

Had he overreacted?

Between the airport and Evelyn’s apartment—what could have possibly happened in such a short time?

He’d only seen Lucas there and jumped to conclusions.

Maybe it was nothing.

Yet the internet was ablaze with speculation. Some accused Evelyn of moving on too quickly, others claimed she’d been unfaithful even during their marriage.

Lucas’s fans were divided—some praised him for pursuing love boldly, while others deemed Evelyn unworthy of their idol.

The wildest rumors suggested she’d traded secrets for her freedom in the divorce.

Nathan scoffed.

"Insider information? If there was any, the world wouldn’t deserve to know."

A knock interrupted his thoughts.

Harrison stepped in. "Sir, there’s a document requiring your signature."

Nathan’s gaze remained fixed on the skyline. "Suppress the media frenzy. And make sure no one digs deeper—I won’t have our stock prices dragged into this."

Harrison nodded. "Right away."

Not long after, he returned, hesitant.

"Sir, the online chatter has already died down. All articles about Ms. Sinclair have been removed."

Nathan frowned. "Already?"

"I hadn’t even contacted the media yet. It seems someone else acted first."

"Who?"

"President Dominic Young of Horizon Media."

Harrison watched his boss carefully. Nathan’s expression darkened, but he said nothing.

The silence stretched, thick and heavy.

Harrison barely dared to breathe.

Someone had beaten them to it.

And Nathan didn’t look pleased.

"Get out," he finally gritted out.
###Chapter 81

The evening sky darkened into a deep sapphire shade. The fading light carried an unsettling chill that made Evelyn shiver slightly.

Checking her diamond-encrusted watch, she moved to her private dressing room at Sterling Corp. The space was stocked with the latest collections from her preferred designers. After careful consideration, she selected a knee-length Chanel dress in midnight blue - understated yet undeniably luxurious. She paired it with a rare Hermès clutch and matching Louboutin heels.

Arriving at the exclusive Celestial Club, Evelyn moved through the crowd unnoticed. The gathering appeared to be another meaningless social event for bored elites. She settled in a quiet corner with a plate of canapés, scanning the room for any sign of Olivia Kensington. Had her rival decided not to show?

"Evelyn?" A familiar voice broke her concentration.

She looked up to see Sebastian Hart's surprised expression. "What brings you here?" she asked, arching one perfectly shaped brow.

"Destiny, clearly," he grinned, running a hand through his tousled hair. "The universe keeps throwing us together."

Evelyn gave him a dry look. "Try again."

"My mother craved the club's famous macarons," he admitted with an exaggerated sigh. "Sent me like some errand boy."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Mrs. Hart and her sweet tooth." She glanced at her watch again. "I came expecting entertainment, but the main attraction seems to be a no-show."

As she stood to leave, Sebastian caught her wrist. "Where to?"

"The ladies' room, then home," she said, gently extracting her arm. "I drove myself."

Sebastian's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Then I'll wait and hitch a ride with you. Consider me your personal chauffeur."

The hallway outside the ballroom was quieter, though clusters of guests still murmured in corners. Rounding a bend, Evelyn froze at the sound of her name.

"That Sinclair woman is nothing but a gold-digging social climber," a shrill voice declared. "Everyone knows she cheated on Nathan Blackwood before their divorce. The Blackwoods could ruin her anytime they please."

A second voice chimed in, "Olivia told me everything. No education, no connections - just some housewife who suddenly becomes VP at Sterling Corp? Please. She stole Olivia's projects through...special favors."

The first woman snorted. "And now she's stringing along both Alexander Sterling and Lucas Sterling? Disgusting. No respectable family would accept a divorced woman like that."

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. She never tired of being the center of attention, even in absentia.

Just as she prepared to confront them, a pitiful voice interrupted. "It's true...I don't have wealthy parents or know how to manipulate men. No matter how hard I work, I'll never compete with Mr. Sterling's...favorite."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Olivia Kensington herself.

"You're too kind, Olivia," the first woman gushed. "If it were my company, I'd have that tramp fired immediately."

"Someone needs to put her in her place!" the second agreed.

Evelyn stepped back and dialed Sebastian. "I need a favor," she murmured, explaining quickly before hanging up.

A waiter passed with a tray of champagne flutes. Evelyn selected one and approached the gossiping trio with measured steps.

"I'm curious," she purred. "What exactly is my 'place,' Olivia?"

All three women froze like deer in headlights. Olivia's face drained of color before she forced a smile. "Vice President Sinclair! What a...pleasant surprise."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "No surprise at all. I came specifically for you." She raised her glass in mock toast, then deliberately tilted it, sending a cascade of chilled champagne over Olivia's meticulously styled hair and designer gown.

Not a single drop was wasted.
###Chapter 82

Olivia's body went rigid.

Her head snapped up in shock, her face flushing crimson with rage as she glared at Evelyn. Her voice came out in a shrill, venomous shriek.

"Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?"

The two socialites flanking Olivia immediately jumped to her defense, their expressions twisting with outrage.

"Evelyn Sinclair, do you even belong at an event like this? Who let you in?"

"You're nothing but trash! I'm calling security to have you thrown out!"

Evelyn ignored the foolish girls completely, her icy gaze locked onto Olivia. "Didn't consider this outcome when you were spreading your lies about me?"

Olivia jutted her chin defiantly. "What lies? The whole world knows what kind of woman you are!"

A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips as she shoved Olivia back against the wall. When the woman struggled, Evelyn pressed a forearm against her throat and hissed, "Olivia Kensington, you'll answer for what you've done. I've prepared quite the... homecoming gift for you."

The sheer disdain in Evelyn's eyes made Olivia's lips tremble. She lowered her voice to a desperate whisper. "That recording with Mr. Sterling proves nothing! Workplace affairs happen all the time. You'll never destroy me, Evelyn!"

Evelyn withdrew with an elegant flick of her wrist. "Oh darling, you were never even competition."

A collective gasp suddenly erupted from the banquet hall. "Isn't that Olivia Kensington from Sterling Corp?" "And isn't that Victor Kensington? Mrs. Kensington, isn't that your husband?"

Olivia's face drained of color. "What did you do?" she whispered hoarsely.

Evelyn took a graceful step back. "Tsk tsk. Did you really think I'd only have one recording?" She gestured toward the commotion. "Go see your gift, Olivia."

Olivia stumbled forward just as Eleanor Kensington stormed through the crowd and delivered a stinging slap. "You vile homewrecker!" the older woman shrieked. "After everything I did to help you, this is how you repay me? I'll tear you apart!"

No one moved to intervene as the elegantly dressed matriarch pounced on Olivia, raining blows upon her.

Evelyn smirked. She'd spotted Eleanor the moment she arrived - the woman's legendary temper was even more impressive in person.

Olivia curled into a pathetic ball, too humiliated to fight back as the scandalous video of her and Victor played on loop across the venue's massive screens. The crowd murmured excitedly, thoroughly enjoying the spectacle.

Turning back to the two stunned socialites, Evelyn arched a brow. "Now... about you two."

The girls exchanged nervous glances. While they now realized Olivia's true nature, their disdain for Evelyn remained.

"What do you want?" one snapped. "Security should be here any minute! Just because Olivia wronged you doesn't make you innocent!"

Evelyn's laugh was cold as winter. "My character is none of your concern. But perhaps your families should have taught you basic manners about gossiping like fishwives."

"Who are you to lecture us?" the other girl screeched. "SECURITY!"

As if on cue, a commanding male voice cut through the tension. "Why the need for security?"

Sebastian Hart approached with effortless grace, his striking features drawing every eye in the vicinity.

"Young Master Hart!" the socialites cried in relief. "This woman attacked Olivia and now she's threatening us! You must do something!"

They assumed the distinguished Hart heir would naturally take their side against the "troublemaker."

Sebastian gave them a dismissive once-over before turning to Evelyn. His expression softened as he took her hand, examining it with concern. "Darling, why didn't you call me to handle this?" he murmured. "You shouldn't dirty your hands with such... unpleasantness."
###Chapter 83

The social elite all moved in the same privileged circles. Sebastian Hart had always been the darling of high society, his status as the second heir of the Hart family making him even more desirable.

So when these two socialites saw Sebastian treating Evelyn Sinclair with such deference, their faces drained of color.

"What's happening?" one whispered. "Didn't Evelyn have affairs with Alexander Sterling and Lucas Sterling? Why is Sebastian still defending such a scandalous woman?"

Evelyn pulled her hand away with visible irritation and turned to face the women. "You can either apologize now," she said coolly, "or I can make you apologize. Your choice."

The women exchanged nervous glances, their bodies tensing under Evelyn's piercing gaze.

Sebastian stepped forward, his smile chilling. "Are you both deaf? Choose!"

Confusion clouded their faces. It was clear Sebastian would physically remove them if Evelyn gave the word, regardless of social decorum.

Click!

Evelyn snapped a photo with her phone, her lips curving in satisfaction.

"What are you doing?" one woman demanded, bewildered by the sudden photograph.

"We're civilized people," Evelyn said smoothly. "I won't resort to violence. Since you refuse to apologize, I'll simply have your fathers do it for you. Though when that happens..." Her smile turned dangerous. "A simple 'sorry' won't suffice."

With Sterling Corporation's influence, ruining a few minor businesses would be child's play. Making entire companies disappear from New York could happen with a single phone call.

The women exchanged panicked whispers before forcing out reluctant apologies. Though they despised Evelyn, they feared the Hart family's power. With Sebastian openly supporting her, they couldn't risk retaliation. And if Evelyn reconciled with Nathan Blackwood... the consequences would be catastrophic.

These trust fund princesses contributed nothing to their family businesses. If they caused financial ruin over petty gossip, they'd be disowned immediately.

Evelyn tilted her head, tapping her ear. "I didn't quite catch that."

The women clenched their teeth, hatred burning in their eyes as they raised their voices. "Ms. Sinclair, we apologize."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Consider this your only warning. Next time, I won't be so civilized." She had countless ways to humble spoiled heiresses.

Checking her phone, Evelyn noted the time. The sounds of scandal still echoed through the banquet hall. Having no interest in further drama, she headed for the exit.

With everything exposed, Sterling Corporation would issue Olivia Kensington's termination notice by evening, effectively ending her career. Victor Kensington would suffer the same fate.

Just before reaching the door, another group approached - led by none other than Nathan Blackwood.

Sebastian snorted. "What a small world." He draped an arm around Evelyn's shoulders, whispering, "No need to thank me. We can't lose this battle."

Evelyn noticed Nathan's intense stare. She averted her gaze indifferently, walking past without acknowledgment, treating him like a stranger.

"Evelyn," Tristan Whitmore sneered, blocking her path. "You're more famous than actual celebrities these days. Planning a career change into show business?"

He'd been following the online drama all day. Seeing Evelyn humiliated was rare, and Tristan couldn't resist adding fuel to the fire. Unfortunately, the trolls he'd hired had mysteriously gone silent earlier.

Sebastian arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Whitmore, is that any of your concern?"

"How can you still defend her when she's entangled with three men simultaneously?" Tristan scoffed. "Don't you find her... excessive popularity with men rather questionable?"

Evelyn gave him a sidelong glance. "If I were you, I'd learn when to keep quiet."

Tristan's face twisted in outrage. This woman dared lecture him?

Her lips curled in a mocking smile. "Because if I get angry, I could make you far more famous than I am." One leaked nude photo would decide who truly went viral.

With that parting shot, Evelyn walked away without sparing Nathan another glance.

Tristan stood fuming, teeth grinding. "Is she threatening me for life?!"

Nathan's cold gaze followed Evelyn before shifting to Tristan. "You brought this on yourself."
###Chapter 84

Nathan Blackwood stepped directly into their path without hesitation, his presence deliberate and unyielding. He clearly had something to say.

Evelyn Sinclair's patience was wearing thin.

Nathan approached the car and rapped his knuckles against her window.

She exhaled slowly, her lips curling into a faint, humorless smile before she lowered the tinted glass.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly. "Is there a problem?"

His dark eyes bore into hers, intense and unreadable. "Evelyn, about those two conditions you proposed—"

She cut him off with a sharp laugh. "Oh? Have you finally made your choice? Which one will it be? Vanessa Holloway or the emerald pipe?"

His jaw tightened. "Change your terms. Vanessa is off-limits."

The words hit her like a physical blow.

Thankfully, the dim lighting of the parking lot concealed the way her expression darkened.

Vanessa Holloway is untouchable?

How special is she to him?

Does she really hold that much weight in his heart?

Evelyn had convinced herself she was over Nathan Blackwood—that his choices no longer affected her.

Yet here she was, wounded by a single sentence.

The familiar ache spread through her chest, sharp and suffocating.

The only person Nathan Blackwood ever willingly hurts is me.

Suddenly, a warm, calloused hand closed over hers, squeezing tight.

She blinked, startled, and turned to meet Alexander Sterling's knowing gaze.

His lips quirked in amusement.

"Mr. Blackwood," Alexander drawled, voice dripping with disdain. "I must say, your taste in women is... questionable. If I were you, I'd rather gouge my eyes out than spare Vanessa Holloway a single glance."

Nathan's expression darkened further.

Evelyn smirked, regaining her composure. "You still don’t understand, do you? I set the terms. I gave you a choice. You don’t get to rewrite the rules."

With that, she rolled the window back up, cutting off any response.

The engine roared to life as she slammed her foot on the accelerator, leaving Nathan standing in the shadows.

She didn’t look back.

"Damn, Evie," Alexander teased once they were on the road. "You were all fire and confidence back there. What happened to that energy?"

She shot him a glare.

He knew her too well—had grown up with her, fought with her, seen her at her weakest.

Of course he could read her like an open book.

He tugged at her hand again, refusing to let go.

"Stop it," she muttered, pulling away.

Alexander only grinned, unfazed. "Come on. Admit it. You’re still hung up on him."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I’m an idiot."

He reached over, ruffling her hair affectionately. "Don’t worry. You’ve still got me, alright?"

She rolled her eyes, but the corner of her mouth twitched. "I’m not scared of losing something I never had."

And she meant it.

Nathan Blackwood wouldn’t get another chance to break her.

So he chose Vanessa Holloway.

Fine.

Then the Blackwood heirloom would be lost forever.

Back in the parking lot, Tristan Whitmore jogged up to Nathan, breathless.

"Dude, what the hell? I thought we were taking my new car for a spin!"

Nathan didn’t respond, his gaze fixed on the empty space where Evelyn’s car had been.

Tristan frowned, then noticed the dent in his car door.

His face paled.

"No. No, no, no—" He crouched down, running his fingers over the damage in horror.

"My baby!" he wailed. "I’ve had her for three days!"

He whirled on Nathan. "Who the hell did this? I’ll kill them!"

Nathan barely glanced at him.

"Doesn’t matter," he muttered, turning away.

Tristan gaped after him.

"Doesn’t matter?! Nathan, this is a crime!"

But Nathan was already walking off into the night.
###Chapter 85 Get Away From Me

Nathan Blackwood glared at Tristan Whitmore with icy intensity, his chest tightening with an unfamiliar, suffocating pain. He couldn't understand why seeing Evelyn Sinclair not pull away when Tristan held her hand earlier had irritated him so deeply.

Tristan continued ranting beside him. "You didn't see who did it? Who would dare damage my baby? I had it custom-ordered from Italy and waited six weeks for that special shipment! That absolute bastard!"

At Sterling Corporation...

Days later, Olivia Kensington was officially terminated and charged with corporate espionage. The board's audit committee began investigating transactions handled by Victor Kensington. Their findings revealed he'd secretly sold off three percent of his shares at peak valuation months ago, exposing him as nothing more than a figurehead shareholder who'd deceived everyone.

When Bennett reported these developments, Evelyn simply sipped her espresso, her only reaction being a slight narrowing of her eyes. Bennett couldn't fathom her calm demeanor - wasn't she concerned about such a major development?

"Vice President Sinclair, should I trace who purchased his shares?" Bennett pressed. If Victor had sold to a competitor, they could be facing serious threats.

Evelyn chuckled softly, tossing a document onto her desk. "My brother anticipated this long ago. Do you really think he'd let corporate shares fall into enemy hands?" Bennett scanned the document, his eyebrows shooting up when he saw Evelyn listed as the assignee. "Brilliant! So Victor unknowingly sold to President Sterling's proxy, who then transferred them to you?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow with a knowing smile. "Exactly. Alexander Sterling always stays ten steps ahead. Victor's shares were just a little welcome-home present he arranged for me." With Alexander's flight arriving that evening, Evelyn dragged Lucas - who'd been lounging at home - to the airport.

Determined to avoid another media circus like last time, they waited in the parking garage, nursing coffees in the quiet, nearly deserted space.

Within minutes, Alexander appeared in his signature understated style.

Evelyn instantly recognized his tall, commanding silhouette and those distinctive Sterling eyebrows. She leapt from the car, arms wide, and practically tackled him in a koala hug. "Welcome home, big brother!" Alexander laughed indulgently. "Missed me that much?"

"Desperately! Where's my present?"

Lucas bounded over with equal enthusiasm, arms outstretched for his own hug. "Welcome home, bro!" But before he could make contact, Alexander shoved him away with one hand. "Personal space, Lucas!"

Lucas gaped in disbelief while Evelyn dissolved into laughter. Alexander's assistant trailed behind, struggling with eight massive suitcases. Evelyn finally released her brother to eye the luggage with astonishment.

Meanwhile, Lucas huffed dramatically. "That's it - I'm disowning both of you!"

"Fine by me," Alexander retorted, turning to ruffle Evelyn's hair. "Don't mind him. Let's go home - I brought you seven boxes of gifts. Take whatever you want first, then maybe toss Lucas one or two things you don't like."

Lucas froze mid-step, whirling around with an expression of utter betrayal. "Could you at least pretend to be subtle about playing favorites?" he hissed through clenched teeth. "I swear I'm the most underappreciated A-list actor in Hollywood!"

The entourage of assistants trailing the Sterling siblings exchanged bewildered glances as they heaved the enormous packages, struggling to keep up with the bickering trio.
###Chapter 86

The sleek black limousine glided through the iron gates of Sterling Manor.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out first, followed by her brothers Alexander and Lucas. The evening air carried the scent of freshly cut roses from the estate gardens.

Archibald, the butler who had served the Sterling family for three decades, greeted them with a warm smile. "Dinner will be served in thirty minutes," he announced, already directing staff with silent efficiency.

Though William Sterling was abroad, every inch of the manor remained immaculate. Archibald's meticulous attention to detail was legendary among Montecito's elite.

The siblings gathered in the grand parlor, where Alexander uncorked a rare vintage from the family cellar. Crystal glasses clinked as they toasted their reunion.

Lucas, usually so composed on screen, abandoned all pretense of Hollywood decorum. He swayed to the jazz music playing, his movements loose with alcohol. "If my fans could see me now," he laughed, spinning dramatically.

Evelyn knelt on the Persian rug, carefully arranging the treasures Alexander had brought from his travels. These weren't mass-produced luxuries, but one-of-a-kind artifacts from private European collections.

Her phone buzzed just as the wine began to warm her cheeks. Seeing Natalie Beaumont's name, she answered immediately. With a subtle nod to Archibald, the butler began gathering her gifts for safekeeping.

"Natalie! You're back?"

The designer's voice crackled with excitement. "Clear your calendar tomorrow night, darling. The Lumière showcase needs you - bring Isabella too, won't you?"

Evelyn needed no convincing. Natalie's avant-garde shows were the highlight of Montecito's social season. "Wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was an uncharacteristic pause. "Actually... could you bring Lucas? His presence would lend incredible prestige."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. The fashion icon and the movie star moved in different circles. She stepped into her private suite as Natalie explained, "Having an A-lister attend validates everything I'm building. You know how these society vultures are."

Evelyn laughed, sinking into her velvet chaise. "Modesty doesn't suit you, darling. People would kill for Lumière invitations. But since you asked so nicely, I'll drag my brother along."

Two years ago, Natalie had revolutionized fashion by introducing her exclusive preview shows. What began as intimate gatherings had become the most coveted tickets in the industry. This season's showcase marked her triumphant return to Montecito.

"Bless you!" Natalie's relief was palpable before the line went dead.

Evelyn fired off a text to Lucas before powering down her phone. Whatever his response could wait until morning.

Dawn found Evelyn coordinating with Isabella Montgomery over breakfast. With Alexander home to manage Sterling Enterprises, Evelyn had cleared her schedule for a proper shopping excursion.

The boutique manager nearly tripped over herself welcoming them. "Ms. Sterling! Ms. Montgomery! We've closed the entire store for your private viewing."

Evelyn waved off the formality. "Just the upstairs will suffice. We don't want to make a spectacle."

Isabella added, "And do hurry. We're on rather tight schedules."

The second floor had been transformed into a luxury oasis. Michelin-starred petit fours adorned silver trays beside a curated selection of European vintages.

"Perhaps a glass while you browse?" the manager offered, presenting two crystal flutes. "Our private reserve - unavailable to the general public."

The friends exchanged amused glances. "Why not?" Evelyn accepted, savoring the wine's delicate bouquet.

They lounged on plush divans as models - each carefully selected to match their proportions - paraded the season's most exclusive pieces. A simple nod would secure any garment for tomorrow's event.

Their peaceful selection was shattered by shrill voices below.

"Where is everyone? Is this how you treat paying customers?"

Evelyn's smile froze as Vanessa Holloway and Sophia Blackwood stormed into view. Isabella muttered under her breath, "I knew we should have had them clear the whole damn building."
###Chapter 87

Vanessa Holloway glanced up and froze momentarily.

There stood Evelyn Sinclair on the upper level, casually swirling a crystal wine glass between her fingers with an air of effortless elegance. Yet Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on the runway models, deliberately ignoring their presence below.

Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa approached the staircase only to be blocked by a boutique attendant. "Apologies, but the second floor is currently closed to the public."

Sophia's face twisted in outrage. "Excuse me? Since when do you deny access to VIP clients? I'm a Blackwood! Do you know who you're dealing with? I'll have your job for this insolence!"

The attendant maintained her professional smile. "My sincerest apologies, Ms. Blackwood. We're hosting very important guests upstairs who requested privacy. The first floor remains fully available. Perhaps you could return tomorrow?"

"Absolutely not! I have a gala tonight and need my outfit today!" Sophia's entitled nature flared. "I'm Sophia Blackwood of the Blackwood dynasty! No one in San Francisco dares refuse me anything!"

The attendant's expression grew increasingly uncomfortable.

Vanessa gently tugged Sophia's arm. "Perhaps we should respect their policy. There must be someone truly significant upstairs."

This only fueled Sophia's indignation. "How dare they humiliate me like this?" She shoved past the attendant. "If your precious guest objects, they can leave! I'm going up!"

The frantic attendant trailed behind helplessly as Sophia stormed upstairs. Vanessa followed with a sly smirk playing on her lips.

Evelyn observed the commotion below with detached amusement. Clowns, she thought. The boutique manager shot Evelyn an apologetic glance before rushing to intercept the intruders.

Too late.

Sophia reached the landing and froze upon recognizing Evelyn. Her face contorted with shock and fury.

Isabella Montgomery let out a derisive chuckle. "Well, well. Should've known it would be the infamous Sophia Blackwood making such an uncouth entrance. Really, must you always behave like a barbarian?"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. "You! Did you buy out the entire floor? What gives you the right to exclude others?"

"Because we can," Isabella retorted with a raised brow. Evelyn continued swirling her wine, lamenting how these interlopers ruined the refined atmosphere.

Vanessa stepped forward with saccharine sweetness. "Evelyn, what a pleasant surprise! It's been too long."

"Spare us the act," Isabella snapped. Vanessa's two-faced nature always made Isabella's skin crawl - that manipulative facade masking her venomous core.

Evelyn didn't even glance Vanessa's way, letting the silence grow heavy with tension. The manager quickly grasped the hostile dynamic.

"Ladies, since these guests arrived first, perhaps you could—"

"Why should we?" Sophia interrupted, itching for confrontation. "Everything was perfect until Evelyn ruined it! First grandfather's emerald pipe, now this! Even Nathan took her side!"

Vanessa smoothly interjected, "Since we're all acquainted, why not join your private showing? These exclusive runway previews are so rare - surely you wouldn't mind sharing, Evelyn?" Her voice dripped with false warmth.

The manager hesitated, searching for a diplomatic solution when Evelyn's sudden laughter cut through the tension.

Did they really think she'd tolerate their presence to maintain appearances? Not anymore.

Evelyn finally met Vanessa's gaze, her icy stare sending a clear message. "Actually, I do mind. Your very presence pollutes the air."
###Chapter 88

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smirk.

She watched with satisfaction as Vanessa's carefully constructed smile faltered and crumbled.

The sight filled her with immense gratification.

"Did you hear that? Why are you still lingering here?" Isabella's voice dripped with scorn. "How shameless can you be, trying to mooch off our private shopping session? Ms. Holloway, have some self-respect."

The boutique manager, anxious to appease Evelyn, quickly intervened. She turned to Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa with practiced professionalism. "Ladies, if you'd please proceed downstairs. Our associates will assist you momentarily."

Vanessa's expression darkened. Sophia looked positively livid - this public humiliation was a direct slap to her pride.

If this incident spread through Montecito's elite circles, Sophia's social standing would be irreparably damaged!

"Absolutely not!" Sophia declared, her voice trembling with rage. "I want to see exactly what Evelyn has selected. Money is no object - I'll purchase every single item she's chosen!"

Sophia was determined to flaunt her wealth and reclaim her dignity, especially before Evelyn.

Evelyn arched an elegant eyebrow, feigning surprise. "You're buying everything?"

"Every last piece!" Sophia sneered, tossing her hair arrogantly as she addressed the manager. "Remove them from my sight immediately!"

The manager struggled to maintain her professional smile, caught in an impossible situation. Ms. Blackwood's entitled behavior was becoming increasingly difficult to manage.

Evelyn's lips curved into an amused smile as she addressed the manager. "Since Ms. Blackwood insists, please package all my selections for her."

The manager blinked in surprise at Evelyn's composed reaction before nodding obediently. "Of course, Ms. Sinclair."

Staff quickly gathered Evelyn's chosen items - an impressive collection of the season's most exclusive pieces. Evelyn turned back to Sophia with deliberate nonchalance. "You wouldn't suddenly find these too expensive and change your mind, would you?"

The manager paled slightly at the implication. If Ms. Blackwood reneged after this display, the boutique would suffer significant losses.

Sophia interpreted Evelyn's comment as a challenge. "Return them? I'd rather burn every piece than admit I can't afford them!" She lifted her chin defiantly, thinking: Who does this gold-digger think she is, pretending to be some heiress?

Evelyn calmly tapped her phone, playing back their exchange:

"Ms. Blackwood, you wouldn't suddenly find these too expensive and change your mind, would you?"
"Return them? I'd rather burn every piece than admit I can't afford them!"

Sophia's face drained of color. "What are you playing at?"

Evelyn smiled sweetly at the manager. "Consider this insurance. Should Ms. Blackwood have second thoughts, you can share her generous spirit with all her society friends."

Sophia flushed crimson with rage. "I'm a Blackwood heiress! Do you honestly think I can't handle a few designer pieces?" She sneered at Evelyn. "Not everyone lives paycheck to paycheck like you. I'll take everything!"

Evelyn chuckled as she sent the recording to the manager, who looked visibly relieved. Turning to Isabella, she sighed dramatically. "Shall we go? It appears Ms. Blackwood's generosity has left us with nothing to purchase today."

Isabella rose gracefully, swinging her purse. "How disappointing. I suppose we'll have to concede defeat." The two women descended the staircase with deliberate leisure.

The manager approached Sophia with the itemized list. "Ms. Blackwood, your total comes to $6.49 million. Would you like to review the breakdown?"

Sophia's world tilted violently. Her face froze, the color draining from her cheeks before flooding back in mortified crimson. "Excuse me?!"

She had anticipated a few hundred thousand, perhaps a million at most - painful but manageable. However, after losing the family heirloom emerald pipe, her grandfather had severely restricted her allowance. Her current funds couldn't possibly cover this exorbitant sum.

"Ms. Sinclair selected our most exclusive haute couture pieces," the manager explained tactfully. "As pre-release items not yet available in Montecito, we're unable to offer any discounts."

She studied Sophia with barely concealed pity. The bold heiress from moments ago now looked ready to collapse.

Vanessa frowned at Sophia's ashen complexion and whispered, "Perhaps we should call your brother? I can make the call if you'd prefer..."

Evelyn and Isabella, now at the boutique entrance, overheard the suggestion.

Evelyn's expression remained impassive, but Isabella snorted derisively. "Can't even afford a shopping spree yet puts on such airs?"

With a final smirk, Evelyn murmured, "Leave her to her humiliation."

This petty drama wasn't worth another moment of her attention.
###Chapter 89

Vanessa Holloway made a quick call before striding over to place a reassuring hand on Sophia's shoulder. "Don't stress, darling. Nathan's sending someone right over."

The Business Convention Center buzzed with activity as Nathan Blackwood emerged from his meeting. His custom Tom Ford suit accentuated his powerful frame as he ended the call with icy detachment. His assistant Harrison stood waiting nearby.

"President Blackwood," Harrison acknowledged with a slight bow.

"Go to Sophia immediately. Settle her account, then have everything delivered to Evelyn's address." Nathan's voice held no room for argument.

Though Vanessa claimed Evelyn had willingly surrendered the items to Sophia, Nathan knew his ex-wife too well. That woman never gave up anything without a fight.

Harrison blinked in surprise. "To Ms. Sinclair, sir?"

"Did I stutter?" Nathan's glacial tone made Harrison straighten instantly.

"Right away, sir."

When Harrison arrived at the boutique, Sophia had endured nearly an hour of the staff's thinly veiled judgment. Their polite smiles couldn't mask the mocking glances they exchanged when they thought she wasn't looking. If not for that damning security footage, she would've stormed out hours ago.

"Ms. Blackwood, Ms. Holloway." Harrison nodded politely before handling the transaction.

Sophia sauntered over with false bravado, tossing her hair. "As the Blackwood heiress, of course I can afford these things. I simply forgot my wallet. See how quickly my brother sent his assistant?"

The manager offered a tight smile. "Shall we load these into your car, Ms. Blackwood?"

"Obviously—"

"Actually," Harrison interrupted, raising a hand. "Deliver everything to Ms. Sinclair's penthouse. If you don't have her address, Sterling Corporation will accept the delivery."

Sophia's face contorted with rage. "What? Those are mine! Why would you send them to that gold-digging—"

Vanessa's smile froze. "These belong to Sophia. Evelyn already left them for her."

Harrison maintained his professional mask. "President's orders." He turned to the manager. "Proceed immediately."

Money talked louder than tantrums. The staff sprang into action.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms as Sophia erupted. "That scheming bitch set me up! Even Nathan's taking her side now!" Her calls to her brother went straight to voicemail.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Isabella licked their gelato cones while strolling back to Sterling Corp. Isabella had already called Natalie to recount the showdown.

Natalie's scoff carried through the speaker. "I've prepared your gowns for tonight's gala. Just show up on time. And what were you thinking, wearing another designer's clothes to my boutique? A slap in my face much?"

The girls exchanged guilty looks. Natalie Beaumont had built Lumière from scratch without family money - a rare feat in Montecito's elite circles. Her legendary rise from street style critic to fashion mogul commanded respect.

Evelyn attempted damage control. "We were just... making you look better by comparison?"

"Save it. Be late and you're both dead." The line went dead.

As they entered Sterling Corporation's marble lobby, the receptionist called out, "Vice President Sinclair? There's a delivery for you..."
###Chapter 90

Evelyn Sinclair approached with furrowed brows, her gaze falling upon the elegant packaging that bore a distinctive designer emblem. Isabella Montgomery reached down, lifting one of the garment bags with a puzzled expression.

"Wait... Aren't these the exact pieces you selected earlier?"

"They certainly are!"

Evelyn's frown deepened as she studied the familiar clothing. Hadn't Sophia Blackwood swooped in to purchase these very items? How had they materialized here?

The receptionist quickly explained, "The boutique manager personally delivered these, stating they were prepaid by Mr. Blackwood."

"Nathan Blackwood?"

Evelyn's eyes darkened. This was clearly about that emerald pipe, but she wanted no part of his games.

Isabella let out a derisive snort. "Nathan Blackwood? What's his angle now?"

With deliberate indifference, Evelyn instructed, "Have these delivered to Blackwood Enterprises immediately. Return them to sender."

The receptionist blinked in surprise. She'd assumed this signaled a reconciliation between Vice President Sinclair and her ex-husband. Apparently not.

"Right away, ma'am." The receptionist lowered her head to summon a courier.

"You should keep them," Isabella suggested with a wicked grin. "Imagine how furious Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway would be!"

Evelyn met her friend's gaze with a humorless smile. "I won't wear anything from him, and I refuse to owe him anything. Three years of marriage and he never once gave me so much as a handkerchief. Now he wants to play the generous ex? How pathetic."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Point taken."

When the rejected packages arrived at Blackwood Enterprises, Harrison sighed heavily before approaching the CEO's office. The knock was met with Nathan's icy glare. "What is it?"

"The items sent to Sterling Corporation... they've been returned." Harrison watched as Nathan's expression darkened. "Perhaps Ms. Sinclair genuinely dislikes them? After all, she did relinquish them to Ms. Blackwood initially."

Harrison had no intention of resending the unwanted gifts. Evelyn Sinclair had made her position clear.

Nathan paused, then withdrew his gaze. "Forget it then." His ex-wife had certainly become uncompromising since their divorce. Harrison exhaled in relief.

"Shall I send the clothing to Sophia?"

"Do that."

"Yes, sir."

The delivery to Aspen Lodge instantly shattered Sophia's fragile good mood. She sprang up, voice shrill. "What is this? Nicole's castoffs? Am I some kind of trash receptacle?"

Vanessa's face tightened as she surveyed the expensive garments, suppressing the venom rising in her throat.

"Darling, don't upset yourself," Vanessa soothed. "Evelyn probably realized she didn't pay for these and was too embarrassed to keep them. Remember how difficult it was to secure tickets for tonight's show? These outfits are perfect for the occasion."

Sophia reluctantly acquiesced—the exclusive fashion show invitations had been nearly impossible to obtain.

Among their social circle, securing entry to designer Natalie Beaumont's showcase had become the ultimate status symbol. When Vanessa produced the coveted tickets, Sophia had been ecstatic.

Once inside the venue, Sophia planned to flood social media with photos that would ignite envy throughout high society.

"I'll be the most dazzling woman there," Sophia vowed.

Vanessa knew this event was Sophia's dream. She'd pulled every string—contacting her uncle, who reached out to Tristan Whitmore, who leveraged Theodore Hart's connections—just to obtain two tickets.

This elaborate scheme was Vanessa's calculated move to ingratiate herself with the Blackwood family. Every connection, every favor called in, served one purpose: securing her place among the elite.
###Chapter 91

The invitation-only fashion showcase unfolded within the gilded walls of a breathtaking estate, where every detail whispered luxury.

Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across marble floors as guests stepped into a celestial wonderland. The vaulted ceiling had been transformed into a mesmerizing night sky, complete with twinkling constellations that made attendees feel suspended among the stars.

Lucas trailed behind Evelyn and Isabella, his actor's charm radiating as he surveyed the spectacle. "Impressive," he murmured, running a hand through his tousled hair.

Evelyn shot him an amused glance, lifting her chin with pride. "Obviously. Only three A-listers made the guest list—consider yourself lucky."

"The honor is mine," Lucas replied with a roguish grin that made nearby staff members blush.

"Natalie!" Evelyn called out as their host approached. The designer paused mid-stride when she noticed Lucas, then recovered with practiced grace. "Well, if it isn't Mr. Heartthrob himself."

Lucas leaned against a marble column, hands tucked in his pockets. "Planning to conquer the fashion world tonight, Beaumont?"

A delicate pink flushed Natalie's cheeks as she laughed behind her hand. "Says the man who broke the internet with his last magazine cover."

"Ouch, forgetting my name already?" Lucas teased, his emerald eyes glinting with mischief.

Natalie's gaze sparkled as she met his challenge. "Lucas Sterling, are you flirting with me?"

His rich laughter echoed through the hall. "Just keeping you on your toes. Don't let me interrupt—I'll find the champagne."

As Lucas sauntered away, Natalie turned to her friends with renewed energy. "Come on, we've got transformations to complete." She linked arms with Evelyn and Isabella, who were too engrossed in the celestial decor to notice their friend's lingering glance toward the retreating actor.

"This is magical!" Evelyn breathed, spinning slowly to take in the suspended galaxies above them. "Your collection hasn't even debuted and it's already legendary."

Natalie arched an eyebrow. "Says my business partner who hasn't attended a single planning meeting."

Isabella quickly interjected, "Where are these mythical dresses we're supposed to wear?"

With a clap of Natalie's hands, assistants wheeled out a draped clothing rack. The designer unveiled three gowns with a dramatic flourish of white tulle.

Evelyn and Isabella gasped in unison.

"Welcome to 'Celestial Divinity,'" Natalie announced, running her fingers over the exquisite fabrics. "Forget tired galaxy prints—this collection celebrates the infinite facets of womanhood. We can be ethereal, powerful, mysterious—whatever we choose."

She lifted the centerpiece gown—a cascading white satin masterpiece dotted with delicate blue forget-me-nots. The off-shoulder bodice gave way to a fishtail skirt adorned with luminous amethyst beads that shimmered like distant stars.

"Evelyn, this Cassiopeia creation was designed for you."

Evelyn accepted the dress with reverence, its craftsmanship surpassing even the haute couture she'd seen earlier that week.

Isabella received her Gemini-inspired ensemble while Natalie selected her own design. The trio disappeared into separate dressing chambers.

When they emerged, the entire room stilled.

All eyes locked onto Evelyn. The deep V-neckline was artfully obscured by floral embroidery, creating an illusion of modesty and allure. The fitted waist accentuated her slender frame before the skirt exploded into a constellation of glowing pearls that pooled at her feet like captured starlight.

A collective sigh rippled through the staff. "Goddess incarnate," someone whispered.

Natalie beamed with satisfaction as her vision came to life. The celestial transformation was complete.
###Chapter 92

Isabella Montgomery gasped when she saw Evelyn Sinclair emerge from the dressing room.

Though Isabella's own gown was exquisite, Evelyn's celestial-inspired dress transformed her into a vision of ethereal beauty. The way the delicate fabric draped over her curves, accentuated by strategically placed baby's breath flowers, made her radiate an otherworldly glow.

Natalie Beaumont's eyes widened in delight. "Finale model change!" she announced to her team before Evelyn could protest. "Evelyn will close the show." With quick efficiency, she rearranged the entire lineup.

Evelyn blinked in surprise as Isabella rushed over, squealing with excitement. "Darling, you're absolutely meant to be the grand finale! That dress was made for you."

Natalie grabbed Isabella's arm. "And you're opening the show, no arguments!" Before Isabella could respond, Natalie disappeared to oversee last-minute preparations.

The venue buzzed with anticipation as distinguished guests settled into their seats. The runway's dramatic lighting created an intimate atmosphere, focusing all attention on the models while keeping the audience in shadow.

Music pulsed through the space as the show commenced. Isabella made her entrance, commanding the runway with effortless grace. The audience murmured appreciatively at her stunning appearance. As she reached the end of the catwalk, her gaze briefly flickered toward two familiar figures in the second row before she vanished backstage.

Upstairs, Evelyn stood calmly preparing for her moment. The updo hairstyle revealed her elegant neckline, enhancing her regal bearing. "Guess who's sitting front row?" Isabella whispered excitedly as she joined her.

Evelyn's lips curved knowingly. "Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway, of course." She'd spotted Nathan's sister and his mistress the moment they arrived. "They didn't even recognize you on the runway."

"Disgusting creatures," Isabella muttered. "But never mind them - this is your night!"

A staff member approached. "Ms. Sinclair, you're on in five."

Meanwhile, in a shadowy corner of the venue, Tristan Whitmore nudged Nathan Blackwood. "Look alive, mate! These models are spectacular - miles more captivating than your ex-wife ever was. If you fancy one, just say the - holy hell!"

Tristan's jaw dropped as Evelyn stepped onto the runway. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief. "Is that... Evelyn Sinclair?"

Nathan's head snapped up. His breath caught as his gaze locked onto the mesmerizing figure gliding down the catwalk.

Evelyn moved with hypnotic grace, her faint smile contrasting with her cool, composed expression. The intricate floral embellishments highlighted her curves perfectly, while the flowing fabric created an illusion of floating through space. She embodied celestial elegance personified.

The entire audience sat transfixed. Even their breathing seemed to pause as Evelyn commanded the runway with her breathtaking presence. Her flawless execution of each turn and pause demonstrated professional mastery that belied her amateur status.

Natalie watched from the wings, thrilled with her decision. Only Evelyn could do justice to this masterpiece of a gown.

From their seats, Sophia and Vanessa chattered excitedly. "That dress is divine!" Sophia gushed, tugging Vanessa's sleeve. "I must get a photo with the model! She must be some European superstar."

Vanessa frowned, squinting at the distant figure. Something about the model seemed oddly familiar... but surely Evelyn Sinclair couldn't possibly be modeling at such an exclusive event? "Must be someone else," she muttered to herself.

On the runway, Evelyn completed her final turn, the delicate flowers shimmering under the lights. The audience remained spellbound, unaware of the dramatic irony unfolding before them - the woman they admired was none other than the ex-wife of one of their own, the very woman many had once dismissed as unremarkable.

As Evelyn disappeared backstage, the thunderous applause that erupted signaled more than just appreciation for the dress - it marked the beginning of her transformation in their eyes, though none yet realized it.
###Chapter 93

The moment the runway show concluded, the entire venue erupted in deafening applause.

Natalie Beaumont stepped onto the stage with effortless grace, her demeanor poised as she addressed the excited crowd. The air buzzed with anticipation for the after-party.

Reporters swarmed forward, microphones thrust toward Natalie. "Who was that stunning model for the finale?" one journalist demanded. "Did Lumière secretly hire an international supermodel?"

Natalie's lips curved into an amused smile as she gestured for someone to bring Evelyn forward. "This isn't some imported celebrity," she announced proudly. "Meet my business partner and dear friend, Evelyn Sinclair."

Evelyn stood calmly in her breathtaking gown, offering the flashing cameras a serene smile. She remained perfectly still as photographers captured her from every angle, determined to give Lumière the best possible publicity.

Among the elite fashion press, a foreign correspondent noted, "This design resembles a bridal gown. Ms. Sinclair, you moved with such confidence in it. Have you modeled wedding dresses before?"

Natalie tensed, ready to intercept the personal question, but Evelyn answered smoothly, "No, I've never worn a wedding dress."

Nathan Blackwood froze mid-step when the words reached him. His body went rigid, his expression darkening with complex emotions.

Of course she hadn't. Their rushed marriage had skipped all traditions - no ceremony, no photos, just signatures on legal documents. Their entire relationship had been transactional, with Nathan offering nothing but financial support.

The realization struck him like a physical blow. Nearby, Tristan Whitmore hesitated, recognizing Evelyn immediately. She briefly met Nathan's gaze before deliberately looking away, answering a few more questions before gracefully exiting with Natalie.

"I specifically didn't send them invitations," Natalie muttered irritably as they walked. "The audacity to show up uninvited."

Evelyn chuckled. "For men like them, tickets are never an issue." Especially in Nathan's own territory. Natalie huffed in frustration before being swept into conversation with other guests, leaving Evelyn to seek out Isabella upstairs.

Meanwhile, Sophia Blackwood dragged Vanessa Holloway through the crowd, interrogating every staff member they passed. "Where's the finale model?" Sophia demanded repeatedly.

Finally, a harried assistant pointed toward the upper level. "She went upstairs just now."

Vanessa spotted Nathan and wavered, torn between approaching him and indulging Sophia's whims. "Maybe we should just find that model first?" she suggested weakly. "We'll be quick."

Sophia's eyes shone with excitement. "She was magnificent! Someone like that would be perfect for my brother." In Sophia's mind, only a woman of such elegance and presence deserved Nathan. "Even as a model, she's leagues above that Evelyn woman!"

Vanessa's smile turned brittle. "Your brother would never be interested in a model," she said sharply. "Their private lives are scandalous - basically high-class escorts who sleep with anyone who can pay their fees."

Their cruel words carried clearly to the upper level. Isabella's mocking laughter rang out. "If you think so little of us, why bother coming? Nobody invited you."

Sophia froze, mortified to be overheard, and shot Vanessa a reproachful glare.

When they reached the dressing area, they found Isabella lounging before a mirror, watching them with undisguised amusement.

Evelyn sat with her back to them, engrossed in her phone, not even acknowledging their presence.

Isabella smirked. "Well, well. If it isn't the two women wearing Evelyn's rejected designs."

Sophia's face flushed crimson with anger, but she forced herself to focus on her original goal. "I'm not here for you," she snapped. "Finale model! I want a photo with you!"

The tension in the room could have been cut with a knife as the two unwelcome visitors finally realized exactly who they'd been admiring on the runway.
###Chapter 94

The instant Vanessa Holloway spotted Isabella Montgomery, her face paled. If Isabella was here, did that mean Evelyn Sinclair was present too? She couldn't be wrong about this.

Vanessa's fingers curled into tight fists, her eyes locked onto the woman sitting with her back turned.

"Are you ignoring me? I said come take photos with me!" Sophia Blackwood snapped, furious at being disregarded by a mere model.

Isabella let out an amused chuckle, clearly enjoying watching Sophia humiliate herself. "Who do you think you are? Nobody owes you anything."

Sophia ground her teeth. "This doesn't concern you! Stay out of it!"

She turned back to the motionless model. "Listen here! I'm a Blackwood heiress. Name your price for one damn photo!"

Sophia scoffed internally. She only wanted to impress her shallow friends. Back home, people begged for photos with her, not the other way around.

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Can't I enjoy five minutes of peace?"

"A Blackwood heiress, you say?" Evelyn's voice dripped with sarcasm as she turned around. "Funny, I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list."

Her piercing glare swept over Sophia and Vanessa like a winter storm. These fools should be grateful she hadn't called them out earlier. Now they dared provoke her? They were begging for destruction.

Sophia gasped. "You! It's you?!" Her voice shook with disbelief. That stunning closing model was actually Evelyn? How could someone so effortlessly elegant be the same woman they'd looked down upon?

"Yes, it's me. Problem?" Evelyn's tone could freeze lava.

Sophia's face twisted in rage. Humiliated by Nathan earlier, now Evelyn was mocking her too. "Stop pretending to be some high-class socialite! No designer dress can cover up your gutter roots! I must be cursed to keep running into you!"

She'd never take photos with Evelyn now - that would be beneath her dignity.

Isabella burst into laughter. "Oh this is rich! You're calling us gutter trash?"

Sophia sneered. "Your sugar daddy must be powerful to get you in here. But once I expose you, security will drag you out by your hair!"

She was convinced Evelyn had slept her way in. No way would high society tolerate a gold-digging divorcee like her.

Evelyn's lips curled in cold amusement. Before she could respond, Natalie Beaumont interjected, "Who's getting thrown out now?"

Sophia recognized the Lumière founder and rushed to slander Evelyn. "She's Nathan Blackwood's discarded ex-wife! A nobody from nowhere! She doesn't belong here!"

Natalie's gaze turned glacial. "You're the ones leaving." Her eyes flicked to Vanessa with open contempt. "I don't recall sending either of you invitations. Shall I call security?"

Vanessa panicked. "She's Nathan Blackwood's sister! We got tickets from a friend - we didn't sneak in!"

Natalie laughed sharply. "I didn't even invite the CEO of Blackwood Industries, let alone some random relative."

Sophia's face burned as if slapped. Her social standing evaporated in that moment.

"And which 'friend' gave you tickets?" Natalie continued icily. "They'll be banned from all future events."

Vanessa flinched under Natalie's hostility. Desperate, she pointed at Evelyn. "What about her? Why does she get to stay?"

Evelyn arched a perfect brow. Natalie smirked. "Clearly you missed my interview. Evelyn Sinclair is co-founder and partner of Lumière. Meaning she owns this event."

Both women froze, their expressions shifting from shock to horror - a transformation more entertaining than the runway show itself.

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "Now, would you like to leave voluntarily? Or shall we make it a public spectacle?"
###Chapter 95

Hearing Evelyn Sinclair's words, Vanessa Holloway frowned slightly. Sophia Blackwood hadn't expected Evelyn to have such a close connection with Lumière.

The founder of Sophia's favorite brand, Lumière, was actually Evelyn?

Sophia didn’t want to be publicly escorted out by security. The humiliation would be front-page gossip by morning.

She scoffed. "Why are you so smug? I wouldn’t step foot in this dump again anyway!"

Gritting her teeth, she yanked Vanessa away.

At the entrance downstairs, Vanessa suddenly stopped.

"Wait—what’s wrong?"

Though Sophia didn’t want to leave empty-handed, she knew Evelyn would make good on her threat. Being dragged out would be far worse.

"I think I just saw your brother. Shouldn’t we wait for him?"

If Nathan recognized Evelyn, would old feelings resurface? The thought twisted Vanessa’s stomach.

Ever since she’d returned, Nathan had been distant—avoiding her, cutting conversations short.

No. I can’t risk it.

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Perfect. I’ll tell him how Evelyn humiliated me!"

They lingered near the lounge, unnoticed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was in high spirits—though Isabella Montgomery wasn’t satisfied. "Why let them off easy? Should’ve had security toss them out!"

Natalie Beaumont shot her a look. "Making a scene would’ve stolen the spotlight. The show’s success matters more than their pride."

Isabella finally understood with a quiet "Oh."

"So the woman behind Sophia is Nathan Blackwood’s lover?" Natalie asked.

Evelyn shrugged. "Small world, isn’t it?"

Natalie smirked. "Honestly? I expected better taste. That face doesn’t hold a candle to yours."

As the event wound down, guests trickled out.

Nathan had planned to leave earlier but got roped into staying by Tristan Whitmore. Seeing Evelyn on the runway—hearing her admit she’d never worn a wedding dress—stirred something complicated in his chest.

He’d downed several glasses of wine, but the buzz never came.

Tristan grew restless. "You’re brooding. Is it because of her?"

Who knew they’d run into Evelyn here?

Who knew she was tied to Lumière? How did this woman, with no notable background, keep blindsiding them?

Nathan stayed silent, his dark gaze unreadable. Tristan didn’t push.

After a moment, Nathan grabbed his jacket. "Let’s go."

They reached the exit just as Lucas Sterling and Evelyn stood with Natalie, laughing as they said their goodbyes.

Nathan paused, as if waiting for them to leave first.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, showing Natalie a photo. "Do you like it?"

Natalie’s eyes widened. "This is—"

"My gift to you," Evelyn said, grinning. "For pulling off this incredible show."

Natalie blinked at the image. "This is too much."

Lucas chuckled. "What could you possibly give Nat that’s worth her time? Save your pennies for a handbag. I’ll cover this."

Evelyn tugged his arm, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I want to buy a yacht!"

Lucas froze.
###Chapter 96

The Blood Transfusion?

Lucas's body tensed momentarily.

Though he instantly regretted his impulsive words, there was no taking them back now.

Natalie waved her hands quickly. "No, thank you."

"It's too extravagant. I wouldn't even use it."

Evelyn was firm. "Absolutely not! We don’t have to use it, but we need one. You have to accept this!" She grinned at Lucas. "Our superstar here isn’t exactly short on cash, right?"

Since Lucas was footing the bill for the yacht, Evelyn was more than pleased.

Lucas chuckled, shaking his head in amused resignation.

"Yeah, what’s a yacht? If Nikki insists, consider it a small gift. Buying one is nothing for me." He smirked. "Can’t let my baby sister’s bragging go to waste, can I?"

Natalie, knowing the Sterling family’s wealth and closeness with Evelyn, didn’t refuse again.

"Thanks, Lucas," she said softly.

Lucas lifted a brow and reached out to ruffle her hair. "Don’t mention it."

Natalie blinked, a faint blush dusting her cheeks.

But Lucas’s attention was already back on Evelyn, his voice dripping with affection. "Happy now? Can we finally go home?"

Evelyn nodded, looping her arm through his and waving at Natalie. "Bye, Nat!"

In their three years of marriage, Evelyn had never been so bold as to demand gifts from Nathan. All he’d ever given her was money—cold, impersonal transactions.

Now, watching her effortlessly ask another man for something so extravagant, Nathan’s chest tightened with discomfort. His expression darkened.

Evelyn and Lucas turned—only to freeze at the sight of Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore standing at the entrance.

The smile vanished from Evelyn’s face, replaced by icy indifference.

Nathan’s heart twisted painfully at the change.

She didn’t even glance at me. She must truly despise me now.

Tristan, for once, had the sense not to mock Evelyn. Not when she held his compromising photos. Provoking her would make him the world’s biggest joke.

Still, they couldn’t ignore the couple.

"Mr. Sterling," Tristan said smoothly, forcing a smile. "What a coincidence."

Lucas arched a brow. "Mr. Whitmore. Indeed, quite the coincidence."

He didn’t so much as glance at Nathan.

This bastard kept my sister trapped for three years. He’s lucky I haven’t stormed his doorstep to settle the score.

The air grew thick with tension.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. His voice was sharp, cutting through the silence.

"Evelyn. What a surprise. When did you become partners with Lumière?"

She had too many secrets he didn’t know. This brilliant, untouchable version of her was nothing like the woman he’d been married to.

It infuriated him—this loss of control.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Do I owe my ex-husband reports on my life, Mr. Blackwood?" Her tone dripped with disdain. "Curiosity killed the cat. Let’s keep our distance, shall we?"

Nathan opened his mouth to retort—

A scream shattered the moment.

"Vanessa! What happened? There’s—there’s so much blood!"

Everyone inside stiffened.

Nathan’s face drained of color. He bolted outside without another word.

The others followed.

Tristan’s eyes widened at the sight of Vanessa collapsed in Sophia’s arms, her forehead drenched in blood, unconscious.

Sophia sobbed hysterically. "Vanessa, please—don’t scare me like this!"

Nathan snatched Vanessa into his arms, his voice rough with panic. "Why are you two here? What the hell happened?"

Sophia trembled. "I—I don’t know! I turned away for one second and she just—she fell—"

Tristan frowned. "Stop shaking her. You’ll make it worse. Is there a doctor here?"

Natalie, though reluctant, stepped forward. "Yes, he just left. I’ll call him back."

She couldn’t let someone die at her venue.

Evelyn watched silently, her expression unreadable. The raw fear in Nathan’s eyes was almost laughable.

So he’s not completely heartless after all. How touching—he cares about Vanessa Holloway.

A wave of exhaustion hit her.

She tugged Lucas’s sleeve. "Let’s go home."

Lucas stroked her hair, pulling her close. "Alright. I’ll buy you that yacht."

Evelyn managed a small laugh.

They’d barely taken two steps when Tristan suddenly shouted—

"Wait! She can’t leave!"

Everyone froze.

Tristan’s voice was urgent. "Vanessa lost too much blood. She might need a transfusion. If Evelyn leaves—who’s going to donate?"

The room plunged into deafening silence.
###Chapter 97

The night grew darker, swallowing the last remnants of daylight.

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step when she heard those words. A cold numbness spread through her veins, as if her blood had turned to ice.

Tristan Whitmore's cruel words pierced Evelyn's heart like shards of glass, reopening wounds she'd fought so hard to heal.

All the scars she'd carefully concealed now lay exposed. The carefully constructed facade of indifference crumbled.

She'd tried desperately to erase those three years from her memory. Yet these people kept dragging her back, reminding her how worthless they'd made her feel.

Lucas Sterling's voice dripped with venom as he stepped forward. "Tristan Whitmore, have you no humanity left?"

He knew Evelyn had suffered during her marriage to the Blackwoods. The Sterling brothers had been forbidden from investigating, their father's orders absolute.

Now, seeing just a glimpse of Evelyn's torment, Lucas's hands clenched into fists. This was how they'd treated the woman his family cherished above all others?

Tristan remained silent for a beat. Protecting Vanessa Holloway had been Nathan's dying father's last request. That made Vanessa's life more valuable, didn't it?

"Are you really going to let her die?" Tristan pressed. "It's just blood. What's the big deal? Besides, you've done it before, haven't you, Evelyn?" Nathan's expression darkened.

Evelyn turned slowly, her lips curling into a smile that never reached her eyes. There was something terrifying in her gaze as she approached Vanessa's prone form.

"Just a little blood, Mr. Whitmore? How easily you say that." Tristan stiffened, unease creeping up his spine. Something about Evelyn had changed - something dangerous.

"A life hangs in the balance," Tristan argued weakly. "Surely you're not so heartless?"

Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Compared to precious Vanessa, what's my blood worth? Should I be grateful for the opportunity to bleed for her?"

The smile vanished. In one swift motion, Evelyn lifted her foot and brought it down hard on Vanessa's wounded head.

The scream that tore from Vanessa's throat shattered the tense silence. Chaos erupted.

Tristan recoiled, pointing a shaking finger. "You—!" Nathan instinctively tightened his grip on Vanessa, shock rendering him speechless.

Natalie Beaumont moved to stand before Evelyn - not to restrain her, but to shield her from retaliation. Vanessa's wound had reopened, fresh blood mingling with the bruise now blooming across her forehead.

"Mr. Blackwood. Mr. Whitmore." Evelyn's voice cut through the commotion like steel. "Let me make myself perfectly clear. I'm not the compassionate fool I once was. Whether Vanessa Holloway lives or dies means nothing to me."

She took a step closer, her gaze locking onto Vanessa's terrified face. "But this I promise - not a single drop of my blood will ever flow through her veins again. Consider it mercy that I don't drain her dry right now."

Evelyn's words rang out, sharp and unyielding. "If either of you dare ask me again, I'll take back every ounce I ever gave her - with interest."

She smiled then, a cold, mirthless thing. "Moral blackmail? I'll burn my morals to the ground before I let you win."

Nathan remained silent, Tristan's words even making him flinch. What right did they have to demand this of Evelyn now?

Tristan paled beneath Evelyn's undisguised hatred. For the first time, he felt genuine fear of the woman he'd once dismissed as weak.

Evelyn's gaze returned to Vanessa. Her lips curved in a predator's smile.

"I may not have Vanessa's talent for manipulation," she murmured. "But I do hope you survive, Ms. Holloway. After all, dead women can't suffer."
###Chapter 98

Evelyn saw right through Vanessa's act.

The blood trickling down Vanessa's forehead in the dim lighting only amplified the dramatic effect she was going for. It was all too calculated.

She had kicked both Sophia and Vanessa out hours ago, yet they'd lingered just to stage this pathetic performance?

Was this Vanessa's desperate attempt to prove she still held Nathan's heart?

One fake injury and suddenly the world had to stop for her. Evelyn would be forgotten again.

But Evelyn refused to play along. Instead of getting upset or putting on a brave face, she delivered a stinging slap across Vanessa's cheek.

"That felt amazing!" Evelyn laughed lightly before turning on her heel and walking out.

Lucas grinned approvingly, giving her a thumbs up. "That's my sister! The real Evelyn Sinclair - not that broken woman from the past three years."

His sharp gaze swept over the woman clinging to Nathan before landing on Tristan. "Not everyone deserves Evelyn's generosity. Some people should know their place."

Vanessa whimpered in pain, her teeth chattering from the shock of Evelyn's retaliation. The slap had left her momentarily dazed.

Five minutes later, the doctor arrived and examined Vanessa on one of the venue's plush sofas. Sophia hovered nearby, wisely keeping silent after witnessing Evelyn's outburst.

Vanessa clung to Nathan's arm, her pitiful sobs filling the air. "Doctor, how bad is it?"

The physician barely glanced at the wound before instructing his assistant to apply a bandage. "Superficial abrasion. A band-aid would suffice. If you're concerned about internal injuries, get a CT scan. But based on my assessment? Mild concussion at worst."

"Just a band-aid?" Tristan protested. "She was bleeding heavily earlier. Shouldn't you examine her more thoroughly?"

The doctor packed his bag without acknowledging Tristan and approached Natalie. "You made me run red lights for this? I thought someone was dying. This barely qualifies as a scratch."

Vanessa paled, fresh tears streaming down her face as the doctor's words exposed her theatrics.

Nathan's expression darkened.

He detached himself from Vanessa's grasp, passing her off to Sophia before addressing Natalie. "Thank you."

Natalie waved him off. "Don't thank me. If you doubt my doctor's assessment, take her elsewhere. I have actual patients waiting."

As she walked past Tristan, she paused, giving him a scathing once-over. "Mr. Whitmore, having a brain is a privilege - one you clearly lack."
###Chapter 99

Tristan's words to Evelyn earlier had been absolutely infuriating. Vanessa Holloway probably got kicked in the head because of it—served her right.

The corner of Tristan's lips twitched. He glanced at Nathan and asked, "Is she implying I'm brainless? What exactly did I say that was so wrong?"

Nathan lifted his dark, piercing eyes. His voice was icy. "What do you think?"

"Okay, fine, maybe I went a little overboard," Tristan admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. "But I was just worried about Vanessa's life! It was Theodore Hart's dying wish! How was I supposed to know her 'slight bruise' was actually serious?"

He crossed his arms. "Still… that woman had no right to hit someone!"

A sudden thought struck him. "She must be furious right now. What if she actually does have my nudes? What if she leaks them in revenge?!"

Nathan's brows furrowed. "Take Vanessa to the hospital for a full checkup. I'm leaving."

"What?" Tristan gaped. "No way! I have things to do too!"

He scrambled after Nathan. "I need to apologize to Evelyn before she remembers she has compromising photos of me! A real man knows when to retreat!"

Nathan ignored him and strode off, phone in hand, with Tristan hot on his heels.

Sophia remained standing there, bewildered. "So… I'm the one stuck taking Vanessa to the hospital?"

Settled in Lucas's car, Evelyn scrolled through her phone, reading the flood of messages in the group chat.

Most were lamenting missing the show. Sebastian had been dragged on a two-week business trip abroad by his father. Isabella, who had left early, had sent a few photos of herself and Evelyn to the group.

Sebastian’s endless compliments were directed solely at Evelyn, much to Isabella’s annoyance. She cursed him out in the chat, making Evelyn smirk.

Much better. This is the kind of energy I need.

A message from Natalie popped up.

[Home yet?]

[Evelyn: On the way. Is she dead?]

[Natalie: The doctor slapped a band-aid on her and left. Now I have to deal with the speeding ticket he got rushing here. Talk later!]

[Evelyn: 😂]

Evelyn chuckled.

Lucas glanced at her. "What's so funny?"

She grinned. "Remember, you owe Natalie a yacht."

Lucas sighed dramatically. "All you do is create problems for me."

Back at Evelyn’s apartment, she hadn’t seen Leo in ages. The moment she stepped in, she scooped him up and spun around, delighted.

To her surprise, the apartment was spotless—Leo had clearly been busy.

He wriggled out of her arms and nudged her Gucci slippers toward her, urging her to change.

Evelyn blinked. "You’re cleaning now?"

Leo puffed out his chest. "I watched TV and learned new things!"

She laughed. "What did you watch?"

"Animal Planet!" Leo declared, then pranced in a circle, trying to look fierce. "I’m a mighty tiger now!"

Evelyn bit back another laugh and nodded solemnly. "Very impressive."

Lucas, still standing by the door, scowled. "Where’s my welcome? Where are my slippers?"

This ungrateful AI. I spoil him more than Evelyn does! Why does he only adore her?

Leo lifted his chin, turned his back on Lucas, and flicked his tail dismissively.

"Mama, I can sing now!" Leo announced. "Want me to sing you a lullaby?"

Evelyn’s eyes lit up. She scooped him up again and headed to her room.

Lucas stood frozen at the door, utterly ignored.

"Did they just… forget I exist?!"

The next morning, Evelyn groaned as Leo nudged her awake.

He held her phone in his mouth and dropped it on the bed.

"Mama, Pretty Isabella is calling!"

Evelyn blinked sleepily, took the phone, and saw Isabella’s name flashing on the screen.

She scratched Leo’s head gratefully and answered. "Hello?"

"Nikki," Isabella’s voice was urgent. "Someone’s targeting you online. You’re trending again—and not in a good way."
###Chapter 100

"What's happening?" Isabella's voice crackled with tension through the phone.

Evelyn Sinclair frowned at the urgency in her best friend's tone. "What do you mean?"

"Someone published a hit piece full of outrageous lies about you! The worst part? It's spreading like wildfire and can't be contained! Check it now!"

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen. Kingsley Tech's stock had plummeted over ten percent overnight - a billion-dollar loss in mere hours.

The phone rang again. "Alexander?"

Her eldest brother's voice carried unusual fatigue. "Lucas is with you, right?"

"Yes, we got back late last night. He's still here."

"Good. Both of you stay put today. No office, no going out."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "I saw the online attacks. I'll call Dominic Kingsley immediately." Personal slander she could handle, but corporate fallout was another matter entirely.

This had to be orchestrated.

"Already spoke with him." Alexander's tone turned grim. "Dominic says it's beyond his control. These accounts were paid to target you specifically."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Any leads on who's behind this?"

A bitter laugh came through the line. "Who else would dredge up old grudges? Who stands to gain from your downfall?"

The answer clicked instantly. Nathan Blackwood.

"Is this because I humiliated Vanessa Holloway yesterday? Petty revenge?"

"Not Nathan directly, but connected to the Blackwoods." Alexander's voice turned arctic. "Old Master Blackwood gave the order. The Blackwoods have overstepped this time. Do they think they still rule San Francisco single-handedly?"

During Old Master Blackwood's prime, his family had monopolized the city's core industries. While still influential, newer power players like the Sterlings had emerged. The Blackwood empire wasn't invincible anymore.

Evelyn's eyes hardened. "What can I do to help?"

"Nothing. Don't even issue a statement. Father's cutting his trip short. He plans to reveal your true identity at our anniversary gala."

A pause, then Alexander added with dark satisfaction, "The harder they attack now, the harder they'll fall later."

The original plan had been to unveil Evelyn's position after she'd solidified her industry standing. But some couldn't resist trying to crush her prematurely.

Evelyn could hear Alexander's barely contained rage. After hanging up, she scrolled through the vicious online commentary. Isabella and Sebastian Hart had mobilized influencers to defend her, but their efforts were drops in a tsunami of hate.

So this was the Blackwood family's reach? A warning shot from Old Master Blackwood about what life would be like opposing him?

Evelyn moved to the window. Reporters swarmed below, cameras trained on her residence despite the distance, ready to capture any movement.

Lucas Sterling slept until noon. After a quick shower, Alexander's warning call quashed any plans to leave. Resigned, he changed back into pajamas and began preparing breakfast for his sister.

Hours passed in restless monotony. Evelyn reviewed reports from Bennett and Kingsley Tech's project updates. At least their major venture remained unaffected - one small relief in this storm.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises...

Nathan Blackwood's expression could have frozen hell over. His assistant Harrison stood rigid before him, barely daring to breathe in the glacial office atmosphere.

"Who authorized this?" Nathan's voice cut like shards of ice.

Harrison wished the floor would swallow him whole. "Sir, I've contacted all relevant parties. The unanimous response? Direct orders from Old Master Blackwood. They had no choice but to comply."

Nathan's jaw clenched. So that explained the coordinated assault on Evelyn's reputation. Every media outlet, every platform, all suddenly unified in their condemnation.

All because of one man's vendetta.
###Chapter 101

When Harrison discovered the truth, he could hardly believe his ears.

The revelation that Old Master Blackwood would stoop to such underhanded tactics against his former daughter-in-law left him speechless.

Even Harrison found himself pitying Evelyn Sinclair.

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for what felt like an eternity, the oppressive quiet in the office growing heavier by the second.

With a sudden violent motion, Nathan kicked his chair across the room. Snatching his jacket, he stormed out with thunderous footsteps, his expression dark as a gathering storm.

His sports car tore through the streets toward Highland Estates. Spotting a maid in the foyer, Nathan demanded in a dangerously low voice, "Where is my grandfather?"

The maid trembled visibly. "The Old Master has gone to Aspen Lodge, Young Master."

Nathan turned sharply, but the maid hurried after him. "Young Master, the Old Master said... he won't see you until the matter is resolved."

Nathan froze mid-step. His piercing gaze locked onto the terrified maid. "What did you just say?"

The maid paled and shrank back, too frightened to repeat herself.

Clenching his jaw, Nathan returned to his car and dialed his grandfather's number with forceful jabs at his phone screen.

The line rang endlessly before finally connecting.

"I knew you'd come crawling back because of that woman," came the aged, mocking voice. "You've shown remarkable restraint not dealing with her sooner."

"I said I would handle this," Nathan growled, his knuckles white around the steering wheel. The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees.

Old Master Blackwood chuckled darkly. "Handle it? She despises our family. Do you honestly believe she'll return my antique pipe willingly? Impossible!"

"That doesn't justify smearing her reputation. What about her future?"

"Her future?" The old man scoffed. "I gave her a chance. She thought she could waltz into the Sterling family without showing me basic respect. Now she'll learn what happens when you cross me!"

His voice turned venomous. "Stay out of this, Nathan. Consider yourself lucky to be rid of that woman. She would've brought nothing but shame to the Blackwood name!" The line went dead with a decisive click.

Old Master Blackwood watched with satisfaction as the online attacks against Evelyn grew increasingly vicious. By afternoon, he descended for tea, asking casually, "Any response from that woman?"

He'd expected Evelyn to come begging for forgiveness by now - not just for the pipe, but on her knees, properly humbled.

The butler hesitated. "There's been no contact, sir."

"What?" The old man's teacup clattered against its saucer. "None at all?"

"We've had people monitoring her apartment. She hasn't left all day. No statements to the press either. It's as if..." The butler trailed off nervously.

"As if she doesn't care?" Old Master Blackwood's face twisted into a sneer. "Nonsense. She's hiding in fear. Give it time. Soon enough, she'll come crawling back in tears!"

But by the next morning, his confidence began to waver.

"Still nothing?" he demanded at breakfast.

The butler shook his head. "Same as yesterday. No movement from her residence."

Old Master Blackwood's brow furrowed. "What about Sterling Corporation?"

"Minor stock fluctuation initially, but Alexander Sterling stabilized things quickly. No other reaction."

"Hmph. That Alexander is competent, I'll give him that. Pity about his taste in sisters." The old man muttered, "How could William Sterling allow such a woman near his son?"

Just then, Evelyn's phone rang. She glanced at the unfamiliar number with mild curiosity before answering. "Who is this?"

"Old Master Blackwood," came the smug reply - the architect of her current troubles.

Lucas Sterling nudged her urgently. "Evie! The livestream's starting! We need to go now!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn ended the call.
###Chapter 102

Old Master Blackwood's expression darkened as he tapped his cane impatiently.

"Did she answer?" he demanded, his voice sharp with irritation.

The butler glanced nervously at the rejected call notification. "Miss Sinclair declined the call, sir."

A vein pulsed in the old man's temple. How dare that insolent woman ignore him? After everything he'd done to give her a second chance!

"Call again!" he barked, slamming his cane against the marble floor. "I want to see how long Evelyn Sinclair thinks she can avoid me."

The butler swallowed hard. "She's rejected it again, sir. Perhaps she's occupied—"

"Occupied?!" Old Master Blackwood's face turned an alarming shade of red. "With what? Shopping sprees and champagne?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn was indeed occupied - furiously tapping her phone screen as she missed the limited edition Chanel perfume launch during the live sale.

Lucas, lounging beside her with Leo the AI tiger curled at his feet, smirked as he successfully secured the purchase. "Better luck next time, sis."

Evelyn huffed and snatched his phone. Seeing his confirmation email only deepened her scowl.

With a mischievous grin, she began typing a private message to the luxury influencer hosting the stream: [If you're in Paris, I'd like to commission some personal shopping. Money is no object.]

The influencer nearly choked on his espresso when he read the message. After confirming today's projected sales target was €750 million, he replied skeptically: [That's quite a budget. You serious?]

Evelyn's response came instantly: [Deadly serious. Platform fee or direct transfer?]

When the bank notification appeared on his phone showing the full amount deposited, the influencer nearly dropped his device. His staff watched in amazement as he abruptly ended the public stream and announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, we're going private today!"

Soon, Evelyn was enjoying an exclusive virtual shopping spree through the streets of Paris.

"That new Louis Vuitton trunk collection is exquisite," the influencer gushed as he entered the flagship store. "Shall I—"

[One in every color,] Evelyn typed before he could finish.

The Hermès specialist was mid-sentence about their rare Birkin inventory when Evelyn interrupted: [How many are available? When told twelve, she replied: [Take them all.]

Viewership of the private stream skyrocketed as word spread of the mysterious billionaire's shopping frenzy.

Lucas returned from playing with Leo to find Evelyn giggling madly with his phone. "What's so funny?" he asked, plopping onto the sofa.

"Just getting some holiday bonuses for the staff," she said airily.

Lucas shrugged. "Whatever makes you happy. Don't hold back."

Evelyn tilted her head with an impish smile. "Oh I didn't. Just spent about €750 million."

Lucas's jaw dropped. "You did WHAT?"
###Chapter 103

Lucas Sterling's gaze lingered on the smartphone in Evelyn Sinclair's hand. "That's definitely mine!" he confirmed.

Every member of the Sterling family used Evelyn's birthday as their passcode - a thoughtful gesture to help her remember. With this knowledge, Evelyn completed the transaction effortlessly.

A muscle twitched in Lucas's jaw. He found himself nostalgic for the days when his sister merely requested yachts - at least those purchases were more economical.

While $800 million was merely pocket change for Lucas, watching such a sum vanish still left an odd hollowness in his chest. He gave himself a reassuring pat.

"She's my sister. Spending my money is her birthright," he reasoned aloud. "Besides, it's only eight hundred million! Her happiness is priceless."

Leo, the AI tiger companion, finally warmed up to him, rubbing its head affectionately against Lucas's leg. Distracted by the adorable display, Lucas scooped up Leo and wandered off to play.

That afternoon, while Evelyn's scandal dominated headlines, another trending topic emerged: @RichBaby.

[First time seeing how the 1% shops - price tags don't even register!]

[@RichBaby - the name says it all!]

[Age is just a number! Marry me and take my last name!]

[Who IS this @RichBaby? The internet demands answers!]

After providing the livestreamer with a delivery address, Evelyn happily set aside Lucas's phone.

Her own device displayed seven missed calls - one from Nathan Blackwood, four from Patriarch Blackwood, and two from Isabella Montgomery and an unknown number. As Evelyn reached to call Isabella back, her phone rang again. A cold smile curved her lips.

"Getting impatient, are we?" she murmured. Though Patriarch Blackwood had backed her into a corner and turned public opinion against her, Evelyn still held the ultimate bargaining chip - the emerald pipe. What did she have to fear?

She answered with deliberate nonchalance. "Hello?"

On the other end, the butler exhaled in relief. "Sir, she answered!" he announced excitedly to Patriarch Blackwood.

Evelyn's smile widened. She heard the phone change hands, followed by Patriarch Blackwood's measured tone. "Evelyn, have you finally come to your senses?"

"Come to my senses?" Evelyn feigned confusion, her brow furrowing slightly. "Patriarch Blackwood, I'm afraid I don't understand. What exactly am I supposed to be admitting to?"

A derisive snort came through the line. "How have you been faring? I hear you've stopped going to the office entirely. Did Alexander Sterling cast you out? I warned you that marrying into high society isn't as simple as you imagined. Not everyone is as gullible as Nathan!"

Evelyn's smile remained unshaken. "How kind of you to inquire, Patriarch Blackwood. I've been living my best life lately. Lounging about aimlessly has always been my dream."

Her days consisted of leisure and lavish spending - what could be more enjoyable?

"Still stubborn, I see," Patriarch Blackwood scoffed, refusing to believe her unaffected demeanor.

"Was there something you needed? Otherwise, I'll be hanging up now." Evelyn had no intention of wasting another second on undeserving individuals.

"Trying to play tough?" she thought derisively. "Nathan Blackwood and his grandfather are cut from the same cloth. I'll never let them look down on me again."

Several seconds of silence passed before Patriarch Blackwood's voice deepened. "Evelyn, no matter what you do, you can't escape your past. Unless... the Blackwood family publicly supports you. Do you comprehend?"

He'd practically spelled it out for her. Surely she'd take the hint - she had no other options.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, releasing a scornful laugh. "You orchestrated this entire fiasco and now want to console me? Patriarch Blackwood, isn't your arrogance showing?"

"Hmph! You have no alternatives," he stated with absolute certainty. "Return the emerald pipe, and I'll cease the online attacks against you. I might even appoint you as a manager in one of our subsidiary companies - enough to keep you from starvation."
###Chapter 104

The Blackwood patriarch was determined to ruin Evelyn Sinclair's reputation, making it impossible for her to continue working at Sterling Corporation.

Does he really think I'll grovel and accept a managerial position in some insignificant subsidiary under the Blackwood Group? The audacity of that old man!

Evelyn scoffed.

"Mr. Blackwood, I have no interest in your family's charity. Save it for someone more desperate."

"Evelyn, don't push me," the elder Blackwood threatened, his voice laced with irritation. "Must you be so stubborn?"

The amusement faded from Evelyn's face.

"You should be the one worrying about regrets, Mr. Blackwood."

She couldn't wait to see the look on his face when he realized his mistake. If he wanted to play dirty, she wouldn't hold back.

After ending the call, she dialed Alexander Sterling.

"Big Brother, when is Dad arriving?"

Alexander chuckled. "Miss him already?"

"His flight lands tomorrow. Don’t worry, I’ll arrange for someone to escort you home."

"No, I want to pick him up myself!"

Let them think I'm hiding in shame. I'll prove them wrong.

Alexander hesitated. "But the media—"

He was worried about her safety.

"I'll bring security and extra cars. If that’s what you want, I’ll make it happen. By the way, how’s Lucas treating you?"

Evelyn laughed. "That petty brat! He trashed my apartment and complained I didn’t clean up. And his cooking? Disastrous!"

Lucas, who had just walked into the living room holding Leo, glared at her. "You blew through $800 million in one afternoon and still have the nerve to call me petty? Evelyn Sinclair, you’re asking for a beating!"

He lunged at her, and Evelyn flipped over the couch, shouting into the phone, "Gotta run, Alex!"

Alexander laughed, his tension easing. His sister was tougher than he’d given her credit for.

The next day, Evelyn dressed carefully for her father’s arrival. She wore a sleek black dress with delicate pearls, her makeup understated yet elegant. She looked poised, confident, and unshaken.

To distract the reporters swarming outside, Lucas made a grand exit through the front door, sunglasses perched on his nose. The media immediately swarmed him.

"Lucas! Are you and Evelyn really living together?"

"Is the scandal true? Are you two dating?"

The rumors of their secret cohabitation were even juicier than the original scandal. While the reporters were preoccupied, Evelyn slipped out through a side exit, baseball cap and mask in place, and slid into the car Alexander had sent.

Bennett was waiting for her. As she settled in, she removed her jacket and touched up her lipstick.

"Vice President Sinclair, we’re all relieved to see you’re doing well."

Evelyn smiled, touched by his concern. Despite their short time working together, their bond was strong.

"Bennett, I’ve arranged gifts for the company anniversary. They’re stored at the warehouse—I’ll send you the details. Distribute them to the staff."

"Of course, ma’am."

He had no idea those "small gifts" totaled $800 million.

At the airport, Evelyn headed straight for the VIP arrivals while Bennett handled security.

"Nikki!"

She turned at the familiar voice. William Sterling waved at her, dressed in a white baseball cap and beige casual wear, looking decades younger than his age.

Evelyn’s eyes lit up, and she ran to him.

William swept her into a hug, spinning her around. "My precious girl, you’ve lost weight!"

She laughed. "I haven’t! Lucas keeps calling me fat."

"Don’t listen to him." William studied her, satisfied, before his expression darkened. "Those Blackwoods are nothing but trouble."
###Chapter 105

William Sterling cursed under his breath as he strode through the airport, his irritation simmering beneath the surface.

It did nothing to ease his frustration.

As he and Evelyn stepped out of the VIP area, Alexander approached, his posture confident, his expression unreadable.

"What are you doing here?" William grumbled.

"I was concerned," Alexander replied smoothly, taking the suitcase from his father's grip. His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Brace yourself. The press caught wind of your arrival. There's a swarm of them at the exit."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. "I'm not afraid of them."

William ruffled her hair affectionately, pride flickering in his eyes.

His daughter was no coward.

"Stay behind me," he ordered gruffly.

Let them try to get past him.

Alexander remained vigilant, positioning himself protectively beside Evelyn and lacing his fingers through hers. The moment they stepped outside, a barrage of camera flashes assaulted them.

Evelyn instinctively turned her face away, but to the reporters, it looked like she was seeking refuge against Alexander's chest.

One headline blared: Evelyn Sinclair Spotted with Lucas Sterling—Romance Brewing?

Another followed instantly: Evelyn Meets the Sterling Family—Is Marriage on the Horizon?

"Evelyn, are you and Alexander Sterling involved?"

"What's your relationship with actor Lucas Sterling?"

Alexander shielded Evelyn's eyes from the blinding flashes, his arm tightening around her shoulders as he guided her forward with unwavering determination.

"Evelyn, will you be marrying into the Sterling family?"

"How does it feel to be chasing wealth for the second time?"

"Are you proud of having so many men wrapped around your finger?"

"Is Sebastian Hart just another backup plan?"

The questions were relentless, each one laced with venom, as if the rumors circulating online were undeniable truths.

"Mr. Sterling, what do you think about Evelyn's scandalous past?"

Even William wasn't spared. The reporters acted as though his opinion would determine Evelyn's fate.

William's expression darkened further.

He didn't dignify them with a response, striding forward without hesitation. Alexander remained silent as well, while their bodyguards formed an impenetrable barrier.

Evelyn walked calmly in her sleek black dress, her chin lifted.

She wouldn't explain herself.

The truth would come out eventually.

Then—

A water bottle flew from the crowd, striking the back of Evelyn's head.

She flinched at the impact.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial as he snapped, "Bennett, find whoever did that. Call the police."

"Yes, sir."

The bodyguards tightened their formation, blocking any further attacks.

The Sterlings slipped into their waiting car, which smoothly merged into traffic. They had prepared decoy vehicles, making it impossible for the press to track them.

Once inside, Evelyn exhaled shakily.

Alexander gently rubbed the spot where the bottle had hit, his voice low. "Does it hurt?"

She shook her head. "No. Just startled."

William poured himself a glass of red wine from the mini-fridge and downed it in one go.

"The Blackwoods have gone too far," he growled. "If they dare lay a finger on my daughter, they'll regret it."

Alexander nodded. "They'll face consequences. But we'll strike when the time is right."

"Don't waste your anger on them, Dad," Evelyn murmured. "They're not worth it."

A bitter ache settled in her chest.

Her family shouldn't have to endure this humiliation because of her past mistakes—because she had once been foolish enough to trust the wrong man.

I brought this on myself.

William sighed, stroking her hair gently. "What matters is that you've learned. It's never too late to start over."

Evelyn nodded, her eyes stinging.

The moment they left, photos of the Sterlings at the airport exploded across social media.

[Look at William Sterling's face! He clearly doesn't approve of Evelyn. Her gold-digging dreams are over!]

[How could Alexander Sterling fall for someone like her? She must have him under some spell!]

[I need to learn Evelyn's tricks—how does she do it?]

Then, William's phone rang.

He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening as he answered.

"Chairman Blackwood. To what do I owe this call?"

"William, I just saw the news. Welcome back! How about we meet for drinks tonight?"
###Chapter 106

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged glances as their father ended the call. Old Master Blackwood had been insistent on contacting William Sterling immediately after Nathan had left the meeting.

Nathan Blackwood scoffed. "There's no need. My family is in chaos right now. I'm not in the mood for drinks."

Old Master Blackwood chuckled. "It's just over a woman. Why let it ruin your mood?"

He leaned forward, his tone shifting. "Actually, I have a favor to ask."

"Chairman Sterling, Kingsley Tech's anniversary gala is coming up. Why don't I invite your entire family? We can discuss matters then."

There was a pause on the other end before William replied, "Very well. I'll see you then."

The moment the call ended, Nathan's eyes darkened with cold fury. "Just wait. I'll make sure those Blackwood snakes regret everything."

Alexander smirked. "I'll spend these next few days restructuring our company shares. We'll weed out the useless directors so Evelyn can take over without interference."

William nodded approvingly. "Good. That'll save us trouble later."

Evelyn sighed dramatically, twirling a strand of her hair. "Oh no, what a tragedy. I might have too much money to spend now. Whatever shall I do?"

William paused, suddenly remembering something. "Speaking of spending, the bank president called me yesterday. Lucas spent $800 million in one afternoon. Not on investments or stocks—just gone. He was worried it might be fraud. What is that boy up to?"

Alexander burst out laughing. "Dad, that was Evelyn's doing."

William exhaled in relief. "Ah, then it's fine."

"If Lucas ever finds out, he'll lose his mind," Evelyn mused.

When Evelyn returned home, her phone buzzed with an unknown number. She ignored it at first, assuming it was spam, but the relentless ringing forced her to answer.

"Evelyn?"

Tristan Whitmore's voice sent a chill down her spine.

She arched a brow. "Mr. Whitmore. To what do I owe this... unpleasant surprise?"

Silence stretched for two seconds before Tristan spoke again, his voice tight. "Evelyn, I didn't take advantage of the situation this time. You can't use me as your scapegoat."

Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. "Oh? So now you're afraid?"

"Mr. Whitmore, have you forgotten how you insulted me that night?"

Tristan's breath hitched, but his pride refused to let him back down completely. "That was a misunderstanding. I've... reflected on it. Just let it go this once."

The panic in his voice was new. Those leaked photos had clearly traumatized him.

Evelyn smirked. "I'll think about it. Don't call me again. Your voice is grating."

She was about to hang up when Tristan suddenly blurted, "Wait! Someone wants to talk to you."

Evelyn froze. Then, a familiar, icy voice cut through the line.

"Evelyn. It's me."

Nathan Blackwood.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"Mr. Blackwood. Here to warn me too?"

Nathan sounded taken aback. "Did my grandfather contact you?"

"Wasn't this entire mess orchestrated by Chairman Blackwood to teach me a lesson?"

He’s playing dumb.

"Evelyn, just return the pipe. I'll handle the rest."

She forced a laugh, her eyes stinging. "Oh? You'll handle it? How generous."

The line went silent.

"Nathan Blackwood, I know this good cop, bad cop act. Do you think I'm stupid?"

Her voice dripped with venom.

"Your family slings mud at me, twists the truth, and expects me to kneel and beg for forgiveness? And then what? Thank you for your mercy before you stab me in the back?"

Her chest burned.

Three years of love, erased in three days.

She finally saw it clearly—their arrogance, their condescension.

No matter how impressive she became—Vice President of Sterling Corp, surrounded by powerful allies like Alexander and Sebastian Hart—none of it mattered.

To the Blackwoods, she would always be that powerless, gold-digging nobody.

And they would keep crushing her until she broke.

Nathan's voice was strained. "Evelyn, I didn't do this."

"So what? You're still a Blackwood. Does that make you innocent?" Her laugh was hollow. "Do you think every insult hurled at me has nothing to do with you?"

The air grew heavy.

Tristan interjected weakly, "Evelyn, Nathan really didn't—"

"Save it." Her voice cracked. "I'm done."

She hung up.

Tears threatened to fall, but she blinked them away.

Weakness was a luxury she couldn’t afford.

Not anymore.
###Chapter 107

Evelyn Sinclair fought desperately against the tidal wave of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. She drew a shuddering breath, forcing back the stinging tears that blurred her vision.

The situation had escalated beyond reconciliation. There was no middle ground left - only one path forward remained.

Nathan Blackwood wanted Evelyn to surrender the emerald pipe to his grandfather as a peace offering. This would distract the old man while Nathan regained control of the media narrative. His plan was to uncover the truth and clear Evelyn's name before the scandal caused irreparable damage.

"Let's discuss the remaining details later," Nathan said with forced patience. "The priority now is resolving this immediate crisis."

Evelyn's bitter laugh crackled through the phone. "Save your breath. I'm accustomed to public scorn by now." Her voice turned icy. "Nathan Blackwood, know this - my greatest regret was being foolish enough to fall for a man like you! Thank heaven it only lasted three years. Consider this marriage my darkest nightmare!"

She drew a shaky breath before delivering her final blow. "And tell your grandfather I'll ensure this pipe finds a worthy home - far from Blackwood hands."

The call ended with a decisive click. Hot tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks as the weight of her words settled between them.

In those first agonizing days after their divorce, Evelyn had often wondered if Nathan had ever truly cared for her. But she'd never dared ask - the question itself would have been surrender. Nathan Blackwood had never acknowledged her as his wife, and she refused to debase herself further.

Now, the answer didn't matter. The entire question seemed laughable in hindsight.

"What a joke," Evelyn whispered to the empty room. "Three years of marriage reduced to nothing but self-delusion."

Across town, Tristan Whitmore watched Nathan stare at the disconnected call with thunderous intensity. The tension in the penthouse was palpable.

"That woman has no sense of self-preservation," Tristan muttered nervously. "Just let the scandal blow over, Nate. She's not worth the trouble." He'd never seen anyone dare speak to Nathan Blackwood with such brazen disrespect - let alone hang up on him.

"Remarkable," Nathan said through clenched teeth. "Absolutely remarkable."

Tristan cleared his throat. "By the way, I received an invitation to Sterling Corporation's anniversary gala. They've invited every major media outlet - domestic and international. Rumor has it Alexander Sterling plans to address the Evelyn situation publicly. So really, you needn't worry about-"

"I'm not worried," Nathan cut in, his voice glacial. "If she refuses help, that's her choice."

Nathan couldn't fathom Evelyn's stubbornness. With the scandal reaching critical levels, why wouldn't she accept his assistance? Did she truly believe Sterling Corporation would protect her? That Alexander Sterling would marry her under these circumstances?

Anyone associating with her now risked professional ruin.

The woman was being utterly reckless.
###Chapter 108

Alexander Sterling personally oversaw the distribution of invitations for Sterling Corporation's anniversary celebration. Every influential figure and celebrity across the country had secured their spot on the exclusive guest list.

What stunned society most was the corporation's refusal of all brand sponsorships for this prestigious event. They had enlisted the world's top event planners to ensure perfection in every detail - from venue design to gourmet cuisine and premium beverages.

The sheer extravagance demonstrated how seriously the Sterlings took this occasion.

Evelyn Sinclair's online scandal had gradually faded from public attention. Occasionally, hired trolls would still hurl insults her way, but the storm had largely passed.

What captured the internet's fascination now was the mysterious identity of @LuxuryQueen, the anonymous billionaire who had spent $800 million during a single livestream shopping spree without even asking about prices.

Netizens speculated endlessly about this enigmatic figure. The only clues were the chat logs from that fateful broadcast. Many believed that since @LuxuryQueen had purchased the entire inventory, tracking the delivery process might reveal her true identity.

Evelyn watched the speculation unfold with quiet amusement. Unlike celebrities, she had no obligation to disclose her personal life to the public.

Sterling Corporation had booked the grandest ballroom in Manhattan's financial district - a sprawling semi-open venue capable of hosting a thousand guests. The upper floors offered breathtaking panoramic views of the glittering city skyline, including the majestic Aurora River that bisected the metropolis and several iconic landmarks.

Those very landmarks now displayed digital billboards that Sterling Corporation had purchased for the evening, each flashing celebratory messages about their anniversary. It was an understated yet undeniably extravagant display of wealth.

Business magnates, A-list celebrities, and media personalities marveled at the event's lavish scale, astonished that a corporate anniversary warranted such grandeur.

Evelyn arrived early at the venue's private lounge. While Alexander handled guest arrivals outside, William Sterling was preoccupied with selecting his daughter's perfect ensemble. Every element had to be flawless.

Even the most fashion-forward attendees would gasp when they saw Evelyn's wardrobe - thirteen unique haute couture gowns commissioned from the world's top designers. These masterpieces represented days of collaborative design sessions, each dress a potential museum piece. Never before had such an exclusive collection been created for a single individual.

"Ms. Sterling, which gown would you prefer for your grand entrance?" the lead designer inquired with a respectful smile.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the breathtaking array before her, each creation more exquisite than the last.

Before she could respond, William waved his hand dismissively. "Just wear the most expensive one!"

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll as the designer tactfully replied, "Chairman Sterling, these pieces transcend monetary value now."

With a graceful gesture, Evelyn indicated a sophisticated light gray drop-shoulder gown. Its understated elegance belied the intricate hexagonal diamond embroidery that shimmered with every movement. "This one."

The designer beamed. "Excellent choice, Ms. Sterling! Your first impression should be memorable without overwhelming your natural beauty. While the color palette is restrained, the cut accentuates your figure perfectly. Each diamond was hand-selected for its exceptional quality and precisely placed to highlight your best features. Paired with these heels..." She gestured to an assistant who presented equally exquisite footwear. "Absolute perfection!"

William nodded enthusiastically, though it was unclear whether he truly comprehended the designer's explanation. Any praise for his daughter pleased him regardless.

"Where's the jewelry? Where are those royal heirlooms I acquired from Europe?" he demanded.

An attendant carefully approached, cradling a velvet case. "Just arrived by private jet, Chairman Sterling. In pristine condition, as promised."

William glanced briefly before turning to Evelyn. "Sweetheart, do you like it? If not, I'll have them bring the others. I bought several pieces, but this was the most extravagant!"

Evelyn smiled at her father's enthusiasm. The necklace was indeed magnificent - a stunning lily motif crafted from flawless diamonds, its timeless design perfectly complementing her chosen gown.

"It's perfect, Father. This will do splendidly."

Their moment was interrupted by Alexander's arrival. "Father," he announced, "the Blackwoods have arrived."
###Chapter 109

William Sterling curled his lips into a cold smirk.

Perfect timing. He was just about to go meet them.

Evelyn Sinclair tugged lightly at her father’s sleeve, concern flickering in her eyes. "Dad, tonight is a major event for our company. Please don’t cause a scene with them. If people laugh at them, so be it—but it’s not worth risking our reputation."

"Don’t worry, I know exactly what I’m doing." William straightened his suit jacket and strode out of the room.

Just then, Evelyn’s closest friends, Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont, entered one after the other. "Hello, Uncle William!"

William’s expression softened as he regarded them warmly. "Isabella, Natalie, thank you for always being such wonderful friends to Evelyn. I’ve prepared a selection of jewelry I think you’ll love. Be sure to pick something before you leave tonight."

The two women exchanged delighted glances before bowing their heads in gratitude. "Thank you, Uncle William!"

Satisfied, William exited the room.

Isabella and Natalie immediately rushed to Evelyn, their excitement palpable. "Evelyn! Finally, you don’t have to hide your identity anymore! After tonight, the entire city will be in shock!"

A faint, indifferent smile touched Evelyn’s lips.

"My identity isn’t what matters. I’m just annoyed that all of this has affected the company."

Isabella stepped forward, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "Guess who we just saw?"

Natalie arched a brow. "You’ll never believe it."

Evelyn frowned. "Who?"

"The Blackwoods actually brought that witch Vanessa Holloway with them!" Isabella spat, her voice dripping with disdain.

"Do you think they suspected you’d be here and came specifically to provoke you?"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "They certainly succeeded in disgusting me."

Before the others could speculate further, Natalie added, "And get this—Nathan’s grandfather has already ordered the media to spread rumors that you were cast out of high society and will never marry into wealth again."

Evelyn scoffed. "Old Man Blackwood is as predictable as ever." She turned to Isabella. "Did you send my invitation to him?"

Isabella smirked. "Of course! A man of his status rarely attends business banquets, but since he’s my father’s old classmate—and I personally begged him—he finally agreed to come tonight with his entourage. I saw him arrive earlier."

Everything was in place. Now, all they had to do was wait.

"Who?" Natalie blinked in confusion.

Isabella squeezed her hand conspiratorially. "You’ll find out soon enough—but trust me, the Blackwoods are going to hate it."

Natalie sighed in mock exasperation. "Fine. I’ll just wait for the fireworks, then."

Since there was still time before the event began, Evelyn excused herself to freshen up. Just as she stepped out of the bathroom stall to wash her hands, a familiar, venomous voice reached her ears.

"You haven’t seen that bitch Evelyn, have you?"

Margaret Blackwood.

Of course she would be here.

"No, why would she dare show her face at an event like this? She’s the most hated woman in the city right now. I bet she’s hiding in some hole somewhere."

Sophia Blackwood’s mocking laughter followed. "Exactly. She’ll always be a disgrace. Does she really think cozying up to the Sterlings will make her better than us? Hah! Grandfather said the Sterlings only hosted this gala to publicly cut ties with her. They want to clear up the scandal between her and Alexander Sterling. Soon, she’ll have no choice but to hand over that emerald pipe."

Margaret’s voice dripped with arrogance as she washed her hands.

Sophia giggled. "Mom, you’re brilliant for bringing Vanessa as Nathan’s date. If Evelyn sees them together, she’ll probably choke on her own rage!"

Their laughter was cut short by a sharp bang as the bathroom stall door swung open.

Evelyn stepped out, her expression icy, her lips curled in a mocking smile.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I didn’t choke on my rage—nor did I collapse in despair. Did I disappoint you?"
###Chapter 110

Outside the restroom stall, Margaret and Sophia Blackwood stood frozen in shock.

"How did you get in here?" Sophia gasped, her mind racing. Hadn't Evelyn been banished from Sterling Corporation?

Margaret recovered quicker, masking her surprise with a practiced smile. "She must be here to beg. Evelyn, you should know when to quit."

"Not every wealthy family will accept damaged goods," Sophia sneered, emboldened. "Especially secondhand trash like you."

She continued taunting, "Are you here to cause trouble? Too bad no one will help you now. The Sterlings have disowned you - your precious backers are gone."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she glanced sideways at them. Without uttering a word, she turned to leave.

Sophia blocked the doorway, refusing to move aside.

With effortless grace, Evelyn shoved past her. Sophia stumbled sideways, crashing into the wall with a pained yelp. As she opened her mouth to curse, she caught Evelyn's icy dark gaze.

The words died in her throat.

Only when Evelyn's silhouette disappeared did Sophia dare rub her bruised shoulder. "That worthless outcast!" she hissed. "Just wait - I'll make her pay for this!"

In the grand ballroom's center, the Sterling men mingled effortlessly with guests. Though retired, William Sterling maintained the vigor of a man twenty years younger through disciplined exercise. Standing beside his son Alexander, they could have passed for brothers.

"Chairman Sterling! What an honor." Old Master Blackwood extended his hand warmly.

William's grip was polite but cool. "Chairman Blackwood."

Nathan offered a slight bow. "Uncle William."

"Just 'Chairman Sterling' will suffice," William corrected brusquely, ignoring Nathan's greeting.

Nathan masked his surprise smoothly. Despite their business dealings, William's frosty demeanor drew an unmistakable line between their families that puzzled him.

Oblivious to the tension, Old Master Blackwood continued chatting amiably. Meanwhile, Alexander's sharp gaze landed on Vanessa Holloway beside Nathan.

Raising his champagne flute, Alexander remarked, "No wonder you were so ruthless with your ex-wife, Mr. Blackwood. Preparing to announce new marital plans? I wonder which fortunate lady has captured your devotion?"

Even the dimmest person would recognize the barb in Alexander's words. Nathan's brow furrowed slightly, his expression turning stormy. He despised personal inquiries, especially from a man entangled with Evelyn. Was this some twisted form of vengeance?

Vanessa seized the opportunity for introduction. "I grew up overseas. My uncle chairs FQ Enterprises."

Alexander nodded politely. "How... unremarkable. Mr. Sterling, do you know my uncle?" Vanessa pressed hopefully.

"I can't say the name rings any bells," Alexander replied with glacial courtesy. Vanessa's smile faltered at the thinly veiled contempt.

Still, she consoled herself - at least she wasn't that pathetic Evelyn with no connections or status.

"You do make a striking couple," Alexander added drily. Vanessa preened while Nathan's expression darkened further.

"Mr. Sterling," Nathan said coldly, "since when do you take such interest in my personal affairs?"

Alexander's lips quirked. "Perhaps since they became public entertainment."

Before he could continue, Sophia came rushing over, nearly tripping on her gown. "Nathan!" she gasped.

"Where are your manners?" Nathan snapped.

Sophia straightened immediately, whispering urgently to Vanessa. The two women hurried off without proper farewells.

Nathan's eyes narrowed in disapproval while Alexander remained indifferent. Observing the exchange, William commented, "Miss Blackwood is certainly... spirited. Your household must be quite lively."

Old Master Blackwood chuckled. "Forgive her - we've spoiled her rotten."

William sighed wistfully. "My son works constantly - I see him less now than during my busiest years. A daughter would have been nice."

"If you'd had one," Old Master Blackwood joked, "we might have been in-laws by now."
###Chapter 111

William Sterling arched an eyebrow and exchanged a glance with Nathan Blackwood before shaking his head. "How could I possibly consider doing business with you? My daughter certainly doesn't deserve to be associated with someone like Mr. Blackwood."

Old Master Blackwood paused, then chuckled and smoothly changed the subject. "Speaking of which, Sterling Corporation took quite a hit from that woman's scandalous background, didn't it? The stock market has been reacting rather strongly."

Vanessa Holloway tugged Sophia Blackwood's arm and whispered, "Are you absolutely certain? Why would Evelyn be here at this time?"

"How could I mistake her? My mother saw her too," Sophia insisted.

Vanessa's eyes narrowed with calculation. She followed Sophia to the second-floor balcony overlooking the crowded ballroom below. The sea of designer gowns and tuxedos made identifying anyone nearly impossible.

"This is hopeless," Sophia groaned, running fingers through her hair. "But knowing Evelyn, she wouldn't come just to leave empty-handed. She's probably here to force Alexander Sterling's hand in marriage!"

With her back against the wall, Evelyn had no choice but to make her move tonight.

Vanessa barely contained her excitement. "Look! There she is!" She pointed toward the grand entrance where a familiar figure stood.

Evelyn wore a simple but elegant dress, engaged in conversation near the doorway. The tall, handsome man facing her handed over a bouquet of white roses.

"Aren't you supposed to be in Paris?" Evelyn asked, accepting the flowers.

Sebastian Hart looked dashing in his tailored suit, his smile dangerously charming under the soft chandelier light. "I wouldn't miss your big night for the world. I'll fly back right after this."

Evelyn's hands trembled slightly at his radiant smile.

"Shouldn't you greet your father first? I saw him earlier," she suggested.

Sebastian shook his head with a helpless shrug. "He'd either kill me or die from shock. Too risky. The overseas project is nearly complete anyway, and with my brother's anniversary coming up... he won't have reason to keep me away much longer."

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Perfect. We'll throw you a proper welcome home party then."

"Deal!" Sebastian took advantage of her momentary distraction to pull her into a warm embrace. "My little Evelyn is finally coming home. I'm so happy for you!"

Just as Evelyn raised her hands to push him away, Sebastian released her abruptly. "Go get changed. I need to find somewhere to hide before Dad spots me."

She nodded and turned—only to freeze when she saw Nathan Blackwood standing mere feet away, his stormy gaze locked on her, his expression thunderous.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her smile sharp. "Didn't get enough of my sharp tongue last time?"

Nathan's piercing stare burned into her. "What are you doing here?" His voice was ice. "And embracing another man so publicly?"

The sight of Evelyn in Sebastian's arms had ignited an uncontrollable fury in his chest, driving him forward against his better judgment.

Evelyn glanced around pointedly. "Fortunately, no one else seems to have noticed. And since when do I need permission to attend events? Is there a sign saying 'Evelyn Sinclair forbidden' at the door?"

"Do you even understand what kind of occasion this is?" Nathan hissed. "Is your reputation not tarnished enough already?"

The audacity of this woman—involved with Alexander Sterling one moment, wrapped around Sebastian Hart the next. She was playing with fire.

"I owe my current reputation largely to you, don't I?" Evelyn countered coolly.

The nerve of him to criticize her! Nathan Blackwood was truly unbelievable.

To Nathan, Evelyn looked like nothing more than a stubborn fool. The mocking curve of her lips could have been directed at him or herself—he couldn't tell.

Everyone, Nathan included, believed Evelyn had no place at this elite gathering. That she was out of her depth, unworthy of their privileged world.

"Evelyn," Nathan growled, stepping closer. "What game are you playing?"
###Chapter 112

Nathan Blackwood couldn't comprehend the restless irritation gnawing at him.

Why would Evelyn Sinclair dare to show up here today?

Did she still harbor some foolish hope regarding Alexander Sterling?

Couldn't she see how everyone treated her like discarded trash, avoiding her like the plague?

And those damn flowers in her hands—they made his chest tighten painfully.

His expression darkened as he glared at her.

"You shouldn't have come today," he said through gritted teeth. "Whatever scheme you're plotting, drop it. Everyone's watching. If you cause a scene, even I won't be able to shield you."

If she acted out, it wouldn't just be the Blackwoods turning against her—the entire Sterling family would join in.

Evelyn laughed, but her eyes remained icy.

"Shield me?" Her voice dripped with venom. "When have you ever protected me, Nathan? Or are you just terrified I'll drag your precious family name through the mud?"

'The humiliation I've endured—all of it traces back to the Blackwoods. And now he has the audacity to play the hero? Does he think I'm an idiot?'

Nathan's chest constricted at her words. His jaw clenched. He knew she despised him, despised his family—but how could he possibly explain?

Vanessa Holloway hurried over, positioning herself beside Nathan with practiced grace.

"This is my fault," she murmured, her voice soft and regretful. "I know you hate me, Evelyn, and I don't blame you. But please... don't make a scene here. It'll only make things worse for everyone."

Evelyn's gaze sliced through Vanessa like a blade.

"Blame you?" She smirked. "Spare me the act. You're not worth my hatred."

Vanessa's eyes flickered toward Nathan, seeking reassurance, but his expression remained unreadable.

Swallowing her frustration, Vanessa pressed on, feigning magnanimity.

"You've already divorced Nathan. Must you cling to the past forever?"

Evelyn scoffed.

"Forever? You flatter yourself."

Vanessa's lips trembled. "Nathan and I just want you to move on. Today is Sterling Corp's anniversary gala. If you cause trouble, you'll only humiliate yourself further. Think of the bigger picture!"

Nathan's frown deepened. Something about Vanessa's words unsettled him.

Evelyn stared at the two of them—the cheating bastard and his scheming mistress—and nearly laughed at the absurdity.

'Bigger picture? My leaving benefits who? You two?'

"Save the theatrics," she sneered. "Your existence is the real joke here."

Done wasting breath, she spotted Isabella Montgomery waving at her across the room. Without another glance at Nathan or Vanessa, she turned and walked away.

Vanessa seethed, waiting for Nathan to defend her.

But at the mention of "affair," his expression had turned stormy.

He watched Evelyn leave, then abruptly walked off without a word.

"Nathan?" Vanessa called after him, forcing tears into her eyes. "Did I say something wrong? Evelyn clearly despises us. Maybe... maybe I should go. People will talk if we're seen together."

She knew he wouldn't let her leave. It would be rude to the Sterlings. And without a date, rumors would swirl.

She just needed him to realize how understanding she was compared to Evelyn's outbursts.

Nathan checked his watch.

"Fine. I'll have Harrison take you home."

Then he left.

Vanessa stood frozen, her face paling.

He... he actually agreed?

"Vanessa! Over here!" Sophia Blackwood beckoned. "Mother's looking for you!"

Relieved, Vanessa rushed to Sophia's side. With Margaret and Sophia present, surely Nathan wouldn't send her away now.

"What happened?" Sophia asked, eyeing Vanessa's distress. "What did my brother say?"

"Nothing," Vanessa lied, forcing a smile.

But inside, panic clawed at her.

Since returning from abroad, nothing had gone as planned.

Nathan, who once doted on her, now seemed... distant.

Why?
###Chapter 113

The grand ballroom shimmered with crystal chandeliers, every surface polished to perfection.

Suddenly, the orchestra's melody cut off mid-note as William Sterling ascended the podium.

All eyes turned toward the stage, sensing the pivotal moment of Sterling Corporation's anniversary gala had arrived.

Though Alexander Sterling held the reins of Sterling Corporation with prestige rivaling Nathan Blackwood's, tonight he remained respectfully in the shadows.

He stood at perfect attention, watching his father with quiet admiration.

"Ladies and gentlemen," William's voice carried across the hushed crowd. "Your presence honors Sterling Corporation's legacy. This success belongs to all who've supported us."

He raised his champagne flute in a toast that was immediately mirrored by every guest.

The truth was obvious - Sterling Corporation's meteoric rise stemmed from the Sterling family's brilliance, not mere luck.

Guests vied for favor, their compliments flowing as freely as the vintage Dom Pérignon.

Alexander stepped forward to refill his father's glass before retreating with practiced grace.

William gave an approving nod before addressing the crowd again.

"Tonight, I must address the rumors surrounding a remarkable woman connected to our corporation - Evelyn Sinclair."

A hush fell over the ballroom. The assembled reporters leaned forward, sensing the bombshell about to drop.

Old Master Blackwood's smug expression faltered. Across the room, Margaret and Sophia Blackwood exchanged knowing glances.

"Where is that disgraceful woman?" Sophia whispered, scanning the crowd unsuccessfully.

Margaret smirked. "Probably escorted out. The Sterlings would never tolerate such scandal."

William's gaze locked onto the Blackwood contingent as he declared, "Evelyn secured Kingsley Tech's landmark deal as our Vice President. Her competence is unquestionable - and her relationship with Alexander isn't what gossip suggests."

The revelation hung in the stunned silence. Even Nathan looked unsettled, his usual composure cracking.

"Allow me to properly introduce this extraordinary woman," William announced, turning toward a side entrance with paternal pride.

The double doors swung open dramatically.

Evelyn emerged like a vision, bathed in golden light. Her flawless makeup accentuated high cheekbones, while cascading waves framed her face with effortless elegance.

The custom Laurent Dubois gown clung to her slender frame, its gray diamonds catching the light with every movement.

The showstopping pink diamond necklace at her throat was rumored to have once belonged to French royalty.

She ascended the stage with regal poise, the slit in her gown revealing designer stilettos worth a small fortune.

Taking her place beside William, Evelyn carried herself with the unshakable confidence of someone born to power.

Camera flashes erupted like fireworks, desperate to capture her breathtaking transformation.

The collective gasp was audible. This radiant powerhouse bore no resemblance to the humiliated divorcee of tabloid lore.

William beamed at his daughter's commanding presence - this was how a Sterling heir should debut in high society.

After a dramatic pause, his voice rang out: "Her last name is Sterling - my cherished daughter, my greatest pride - Evelyn Sterling!"
###Chapter 114

The moment William Sterling's words echoed through the grand ballroom, an eerie silence descended.

Every guest stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.

Outside, the towering digital billboards across the city flickered to life, displaying Evelyn Sinclair's radiant face against the night sky. The Sterlings wanted the world to witness their princess's triumphant return.

Old Master Blackwood's face turned ashen, his wrinkled hands trembling against his cane.

Nathan Blackwood stood rigid, his piercing gaze locked on the woman he'd once dismissed. The truth hit him like a freight train.

Sophia and Margaret Blackwood weren't as composed. "This is absurd!" Margaret shrieked, her shrill voice cutting through the silence. "She's just some penniless orphan we took in!"

"Silence!" Old Master Blackwood thundered, his voice shaking with barely contained rage.

William Sterling ignored the outburst, his commanding presence filling the room. "Furthermore," he announced, "I'm transferring my entire 60% stake in Sterling Corporation to Evelyn."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Effective immediately, Evelyn Sinclair will assume control as CEO and my sole successor."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the elite gathering. The woman they'd mocked as a gold-digger now stood as one of the wealthiest heiresses in the country.

Alexander Sterling stepped forward, his calm demeanor contrasting with the electrified atmosphere. "To celebrate my sister's homecoming," he declared, "I'm gifting her 10% of my personal shares."

The crowd held its breath.

"With 70% controlling interest, Evelyn becomes Sterling Corporation's undisputed leader. As her brother, I pledge my full support to her vision."

Evelyn maintained her composure, though her mind reeled. Alexander had never mentioned this staggering gift. The weight of an empire now rested on her shoulders - a golden burden she hadn't anticipated.

Thunderous applause erupted, shaking the crystal chandeliers. The media frenzy reached fever pitch as reporters clamored for comments.

One bold journalist shouted above the din, "Ms. Sinclair! How do you respond to the online rumors? Does your divorce signal the end of Sterling-Blackwood business relations?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his stormy eyes fixed on his ex-wife.

Evelyn met the question head-on, her voice clear and measured. "Let me clarify - our marriage was never a business arrangement. I entered it under false pretenses, hiding my true identity."

A hush fell over the room.

"That youthful mistake belongs to me alone. This divorce represents my commitment to walk the correct path forward."

Her gaze swept across the Blackwood family, lingering on Nathan. A knowing smile played on her lips. "Perhaps if they'd known who I truly was, we might have avoided this entire spectacle."

She straightened her shoulders, radiating quiet strength. "I'm eternally grateful for my father's name and this platform to set the record straight. Not everyone gets such an opportunity."
###Chapter 115

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a silent smirk as she let the revelation sink in. The truth was finally out.

This elaborate charade had been orchestrated by the Blackwoods with one malicious purpose - to tarnish Evelyn's reputation beyond repair.

For any ordinary person caught in such a web of deceit, recovery would have been impossible. The Blackwoods' influence could easily destroy lives with a snap of their fingers.

But Evelyn wasn't about to shield the Blackwoods from the consequences of their actions. This was the perfect opportunity to expose their despicable nature to the world.

Old Master Blackwood stood rigid, struggling to mask the panic and overwhelming regret in his eyes. There was no undoing what had been done.

No one could have guessed Evelyn was the Sterling heiress!

No wonder the Blackwoods had found no trace of Evelyn's past when they investigated her before the marriage. They'd believed her when she claimed to be an orphan.

The Sterlings had the power to erase history if they wished.

"A wrong diversion in her life?" Nathan Blackwood's brow furrowed at Evelyn's words, his piercing gaze turning icy. The implication struck him like a physical blow. "Ms. Sterling, does this mean there was indeed a third party involved in our divorce?" A reporter's question brought back memories of the scandal that had surrounded their separation, drawing sympathetic murmurs from the crowd.

The Blackwoods had thrown away control of Sterling Worldwide with their own hands! Nathan remained statuesque amidst the prying eyes, his tailored suit impeccable, his focus entirely on Evelyn who seemed to radiate under the lights.

A storm of emotions raged within him.

Nathan's composure was remarkable - his expression remained unreadable, proving his experience in handling high-stakes situations.

Evelyn cast him a dismissive glance before smiling serenely. "Let's not dwell on the past. Tonight, I have special surprises for everyone!" Her melodic voice carried across the room as she announced, "Recently, I acquired an exclusive luxury shopping livestream. While I've reserved some items for Sterling employees, there are still rare collector's pieces - handbags, jewelry, watches not yet available in Montecito. Please participate in our raffle!"

Gasps filled the air. Just how much were the Sterlings spending on this event?

Wait - livestream? Exclusive items? Not available in Montecito?

A sharp-eyed reporter suddenly connected the dots. "Ms. Sterling...are you the mysterious 'LuxeDiva' who made headlines for purchasing $800 million worth of goods in a single afternoon?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who merely offered a modest smile.

"These were just small tokens of appreciation for Sterling Worldwide employees. I never imagined it would attract so much attention. My apologies for occupying media resources."

With Sterling's global operations, $800 million in luxury gifts wasn't excessive - it might not even cover all staff.

The crowd was stunned into silence. Evelyn Sinclair was LuxeDiva!

No wonder internet sleuths had failed to uncover the identity behind the account.

While the world speculated, Evelyn had quietly spent $800 million to commandeer an entire European shopping livestream, all while preparing to reveal her true identity as the Sterling heiress.
###Chapter 116

Meanwhile, the images from Sterling Corporation's centennial celebration had already sent shockwaves across social media.

Evelyn Sinclair's face illuminated the massive digital billboard atop the Aurora Tower, broadcasting her true identity to the entire city.

[OMG this is insane! A billionaire heiress marries beneath her station in disguise, then reveals she's actually the wealthiest woman in the country after their divorce?!]

[This is straight out of a telenovela!]

[The Blackwoods are disgusting! Thinking they could bully Evelyn and hiring trolls to attack her online? Have they no shame?]

[Evelyn's comeback is legendary!]

[YAAAS QUEEN! Evelyn Sinclair slays!]

[I just drove through downtown and saw Evelyn's face on every skyscraper! She's outshining all those A-list actresses fighting for ad space. This is iconic!]

[Evelyn is @BillionDollarBabe?! That handle is everything! How is she this perfect?!]

Inside the gala, Evelyn's extravagant $800 million gesture didn't repel the crowd - it moved them deeply. Everyone could see how genuinely she valued every Sterling Corporation employee.

As murmurs of admiration spread through the hall, Evelyn's gaze casually found Old Master Blackwood. A subtle smirk played on her lips.

"Speaking of generosity," Evelyn continued smoothly, "at last month's charity auction, I acquired an emerald pipe from the Blackwood collection."

She paused dramatically as color drained from the old man's face.

"Chairman Blackwood, I've decided-"

"Wait!" The patriarch interrupted desperately. He could endure the humiliation of Evelyn's deception, but losing the family heirloom was unthinkable. "That pipe is a Blackwood treasure. Name your price - I'll pay ten times its value plus compensation."

The offer - $300 million for a $30 million artifact - would tempt most. But Evelyn Sinclair wasn't most people.

The entire room held its breath as Evelyn's starry eyes sparkled with amusement.

"Chairman Blackwood," she purred, "when one has my resources, petty cash becomes meaningless. This artifact's historical significance transcends monetary value."

She gestured gracefully toward a distinguished gentleman. "Which is why I'm donating it to the National Museum. This way, everyone can appreciate its legacy - far more meaningful than gathering dust in your private collection."

The museum director accepted the priceless artifact with solemn gratitude. As he departed with his prize, William Sterling watched his daughter with immense pride.

Old Master Blackwood trembled with impotent rage. Evelyn had checkmated him perfectly - no private collector would dare reclaim a national treasure.

"Let's go!" he barked, turning on his heel.

But William Sterling's voice stopped him cold. "One moment, Chairman Blackwood..."

Father and daughter approached together, their matching smiles razor-sharp.
###Chapter 117

Old Master Blackwood's expression darkened as his sharp eyes narrowed into slits.

A low, displeased grumble escaped his lips.

The sight of this father-daughter duo made his blood boil with barely contained fury.

"Chairman Sterling," he bit out through clenched teeth, "what other surprises do you have in store? I believe we've seen quite enough of this... spectacle."

It was painfully obvious the Sterlings had orchestrated this entire event to publicly humiliate the Blackwoods.

No wonder Evelyn had been so defiant when he'd complained about her to William Sterling in that office. The memory made his face flush with anger - she'd played him like a fiddle from the very beginning.

William Sterling's gaze flickered toward Nathan Blackwood, who remained as stoic as ever, his aristocratic features betraying nothing.

At such a young age, to maintain such composure amidst this storm was remarkable.

Were it not for Nathan's scandalous affairs and the way he'd repeatedly broken Evelyn's heart, William might have even admired the man as a potential son-in-law.

"Chairman Blackwood," William's voice cut through the tension like ice, "I fail to comprehend the source of your anger. My daughter married into your family only to be treated like a common servant. Even after their divorce, she became the internet's favorite punching bag."

His grip tightened on the podium.

"Don't you think you owe us an explanation?"

Old Master Blackwood stiffened. Margaret and Sophia exchanged shocked glances. Was this a reckoning?

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly as his dark eyes studied Evelyn, who stood beside her father.

She was toying with the sapphire cufflinks on William's sleeve, looking thoroughly bored, as if this entire confrontation was beneath her notice.

From the moment she'd stepped on stage, Nathan had been reeling internally. All the inexplicable things Evelyn had done since their divorce suddenly clicked into place with terrifying clarity.

Old Master Blackwood cleared his throat uncomfortably. "She concealed her identity! How were we to know she was your daughter?"

William's laugh was bitter. "So mistreating her was justified because she didn't announce her pedigree? When she insisted on marrying Nathan against my wishes, I cut ties with her for three years. I told myself her happiness was all that mattered."

His voice dropped dangerously low.

"Imagine my horror discovering your family treated her worse than dirt."

Margaret interjected hastily, "We fed her! Gave her shelter! She lied to us - of course we were angry!"

William's face darkened, but Evelyn tugged his sleeve.

Her cold laugh dripped with disdain.

"Let me guess - it's my fault for not being grateful enough while you treated me like trash? That I deserved to grovel and bleed for scraps of affection?"

Her smile turned razor-sharp.

"Newsflash - I'm not that naive girl anymore. What you gave, I'll return tenfold. An eye for an eye."

Margaret paled. Old Master Blackwood shot her a warning glare that silenced her immediately.

Vanessa Holloway, who'd been lurking in the shadows, suddenly stepped forward with theatrical meekness.

"Evelyn," she said in that saccharine voice, "I know you hate me. Take your anger out on me, not the Blackwoods. If we'd known who you really were..."

Her words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken implications.

Beneath her demure facade, Vanessa seethed. How dare this nobody turn out to be Sterling royalty? That smug superiority she'd always felt over Evelyn now tasted like ashes.

Evelyn gave Vanessa a scathing once-over.

"Who let the stray in?" she asked mockingly. "This isn't a place for trash."
###Chapter 118

Vanessa Holloway's expression froze.

She hadn't anticipated Evelyn Sinclair to be so blunt.

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan Blackwood, hoping for his intervention, but his attention never wavered from Evelyn.

He had been eerily silent this entire time.

Vanessa clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms as she lowered her head.

Even Old Master Blackwood made no move to defend her.

His face was stormy as he addressed William Sterling.

"Mr. Sterling, even if mistakes were made, what's done is done. They're divorced now. Must we really dredge up the past?"

William's jaw tightened.

He was barely containing his fury, wondering how his daughter had endured these people for three long years.

With a sharp gesture, he summoned two nearby waiters.

"Escort this young lady out," he ordered, pointing at Vanessa.

Her face paled.

Panic flashed in her eyes as she looked around for support.

William's voice was ice. "My daughter doesn't need trash in her presence. Remove her."

"Nathan—" Vanessa's plea was desperate.

Nathan's gaze flicked to her, his expression unreadable.

"The car is waiting," he said coolly. "Go home."

Evelyn arched a brow.

She hadn’t expected him to dismiss Vanessa so easily.

Men truly were unpredictable.

Margaret and Sophia Blackwood, who had brought Vanessa here against better judgment, shrank back.

They hid behind Old Master Blackwood, not daring to speak.

William’s demeanor shifted instantly, his polite smile back in place.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said smoothly, "we can overlook the past grievances, but what about the recent rumors circulating online? Don’t you think your family owes the public an explanation?"

Evelyn’s true identity had already cleared her name, but forcing the Blackwoods to publicly apologize was the final nail in their coffin.

Old Master Blackwood scoffed. "Is that necessary?"

William’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.

"If you refuse to show sincerity, Sterling Corporation will sever all ties with Blackwood Enterprises—stocks, funds, investments. Every last one."

His tone was lethal. "Unless, of course, you can match our financial pull."

Old Master Blackwood’s face darkened.

Blackwood Enterprises wasn’t poor, but Sterling Corporation was in another league.

A sudden withdrawal would leave them scrambling to cover massive losses.

"I’ll consider it," he gritted out before turning on his heel.

Evelyn smirked.

"Oh, and Mr. Blackwood," she called sweetly, "don’t forget to visit the National Museum more often!"

The jab hit its mark.

Old Master Blackwood staggered, nearly losing his balance before Sophia steadied him.

He stormed off without another word.

William chuckled, shaking his head at his daughter.

"You little devil."

Evelyn grinned, looping her arm through his as they turned to leave—only to find Nathan still standing there.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said lightly, "aren’t you leaving with them?"

Nathan’s silence was heavy.

Then, slowly, he spoke her name like a revelation.

"Evelyn Sterling."

Her lips curved.

Nathan turned to William.

"Mr. Sterling, may I speak with her alone?"

He finally understood why William had rejected being called "Uncle" earlier.

William had wanted to sever any personal connection between them.

William glanced at Evelyn, who gave a careless shrug.

"Fine," she said.

William knew his daughter wouldn’t let that man hurt her again.

Not after everything.

"Don’t take too long," he told her. "I still have people to introduce you to."

With a final warning look at Nathan, he walked away.

Evelyn plucked a glass of red wine from a passing tray, swirling the rich liquid absently.

"What did you want to talk about, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan’s gaze burned into her.

His voice was low, rough with something unspoken.

"Why did you hide your identity to marry me?"
###Chapter 119

Evelyn paused for a moment. Her lashes fluttered slightly as she lifted her gaze with deliberate nonchalance, a faint smirk curling at the corners of her lips.

"Mr. Blackwood, why do you care?"

The answer wouldn’t change anything now. It was pointless.

"Tell me." Nathan’s voice was low, his dark eyes unfathomable, like the depths of a midnight ocean.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her smile soft but edged with ice.

"Because my family despised you, and yet I was foolish enough to love you anyway."

That was why she had turned her back on everything—her name, her privilege, her world—and thrown herself into his arms.

And he had let her fall.

"Luckily, I’ve regained my sight." Her smile was razor-thin. "Are we done here, Mr. Blackwood? You should go discuss the wording of that apology with your father."

She took a sip of her wine, then turned on her heel and walked away without another glance.

Across the room, Alexander Sterling moved effortlessly through the crowd, charming every guest in his path.

William Sterling chuckled, then approached his son. "Where’s Lucas?"

As one of Evelyn’s most scandalous exes—and a Hollywood A-lister—his absence was conspicuous.

Alexander cleared his throat. "He said he’d ‘steal the spotlight’ if he showed up, so he’s at home watching his own movies."

William snorted. "What spotlight? The one his PR team bought for him?"

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling, sprawled on his couch with a bowl of popcorn, sneezed violently.

As the gala neared its end, Isabella and Natalie managed to drag Evelyn away, slipping out to the Velvet Lounge.

"Nathan, you’re late!" Tristan Whitmore clapped him on the back as soon as he arrived.

After the Sterlings had rented out the city’s entire skyline to announce Evelyn’s identity—and the live photos from the gala had gone viral—the truth was undeniable.

Evelyn Sinclair was the Sterling heiress.

Tristan shuddered, recalling how he’d treated her over the years.

Nathan grabbed an untouched glass from the table and downed the whiskey in one swallow.

The others exchanged uneasy glances.

No one could believe it. The woman they’d dismissed as a gold-digger was royalty.

Tristan exhaled sharply. "She hid it too well. One day she’s just… there, at the top of the damn food chain."

A nervous laugh escaped one of the men. "Do you think she’ll come after us?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "No. Just me."

He was the one who had hurt her from the beginning.

Someone else muttered, "Is she William’s illegitimate daughter? How else was she kept a secret for so long?"

Nathan frowned. If she were illegitimate, why would William Sterling publicly claim her with such pride?

Clearly, the Sterlings had hidden her to protect her.

Tristan rolled his eyes. "Didn’t you read her bio? The Sterlings released her full history. Ivy League at thirteen, Ph.D. by twenty-one, internships with Europe’s top firms—she even advised royalty. She was a legend before she ever met Nathan."

The room fell silent.

They had mocked her, called her a schemer, a nobody.

Turns out, they were the ones beneath her notice.

Tristan nudged Nathan. "So why did she marry you? She must’ve been head over heels, right? What the hell happened?"

Nathan didn’t answer.

He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
###Chapter 120

"I'm not sure." Nathan's voice was icy as he avoided Tristan's outstretched hand.

This had been weighing on Nathan's mind. He vaguely recalled that fateful day when Vanessa Holloway was in that terrible car accident, bleeding profusely. The Rh-null blood supply at San Francisco General had been dangerously low.

That's when Evelyn Sinclair appeared. She offered to donate her blood - with one condition: he had to marry her.

With time running out, Nathan agreed without hesitation.

Everything that followed seemed inevitable.

Though Nathan felt no affection for Evelyn, he honored their marriage vows and treated her with respect.

Suddenly, loud commotion erupted outside their VIP lounge.

Tristan peeked out and immediately recoiled. "Holy hell! It's Evelyn!"

The bass-heavy music thundered through the Velvet Lounge, vibrating the floorboards. The dance floor pulsed with bodies moving in sync with the rhythm.

At the center stood Evelyn, her toned legs moving with effortless grace. The dim lighting caught the sparkle in her eyes as she swayed, instantly commanding attention.

She was breathtaking. Every subtle movement, every coy smile was mesmerizing. Evelyn danced with a handsome stranger, their bodies moving provocatively close. The crowd cheered wildly, completely enthralled.

Even Tristan found himself caught up in the moment, shouting encouragement from the balcony. Evelyn heard his familiar voice and glanced up, her smile vanishing the instant she spotted Nathan standing in the shadows.

Her expression turned cold as she abruptly walked away, as if she'd seen something repulsive.

Nathan's chiseled features darkened. He'd never seen her dance like this before - never realized how radiant she could be. During their three-year marriage, she'd been brave entering it and decisive leaving it.

The realization hit him like a physical blow, his chest tightening uncomfortably.

Perhaps he'd been too close to Vanessa, causing Evelyn to misunderstand their relationship.

Irritation prickled at him as he reconsidered his interactions with Vanessa. Had he crossed lines without realizing?

Seeing Evelyn's dismissive glare, Tristan froze mid-cheer under the neon lights. Lowering his arms, he turned to Nathan. "Blackwood, you sure she won't come after us? Maybe we should apologize?"

One of their companions kicked Tristan's backside. "Man up! She's just a woman. Don't embarrass yourself groveling."

Tristan muttered, "Easy for you to say - she doesn't have your nudes!"

Ignoring them, Nathan downed his whiskey, grabbed his coat, and headed for the exit.

"You just got here! Where are you going?" Tristan called after him.

Inside VIP Room 9...

Evelyn slung her designer purse over her shoulder. "I'm done for tonight. You girls have fun!" she told Natalie and Isabella, who showed no signs of stopping their drinking anytime soon.

As Evelyn stepped into the hallway, she spotted Tristan lurking at the far end with that infuriating grin.

"What's this idiot waiting for?" she thought.

"Get lost," she said coldly, not in the mood for his nonsense.

Tristan persisted. "I will, but hear me out first!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Make it quick."

Seeing her icy demeanor, Tristan hesitated before blurting, "Evelyn, I want to apologize for everything."

Better to swallow his pride than risk his private photos circulating online.

Evelyn studied him sideways, a smirk playing on her lips. "Okay."

Tristan blinked. "You forgive me?"

"Hardly," Evelyn replied airily. "After everything you all put me through, you think a simple 'sorry' erases it? Have you no shame, Mr. Whitmore? I didn't realize you were this shameless."
###Chapter 121

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass as a bitter realization struck her. If I weren't William Sterling's daughter, I'd have been dead a dozen times over by now.

Tristan's face burned with shame. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.

But what choice did I have? The evidence was undeniable.

"What do you want?" Tristan's voice cracked. I must have been out of my damn mind to cross Evelyn Sterling!

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the window, her patience wearing thin.

She approached him with deliberate steps, her stilettos clicking ominously against the marble floor. "Those compromising photos seem to be your only concern," she purred, her voice dripping with icy amusement. "Three seconds. If you're not out of my sight by then, the entire internet gets front row seats to your little... performance by the fourth."

Tristan froze like a deer in headlights as Evelyn's lips curled in contempt.

Before she could finish counting, Tristan was already scrambling backward. "Please! Don't—don't do anything rash!"

True to her word, he vanished before the third tick of the imaginary clock.

Evelyn scoffed, rolling her eyes as she turned on her heel and strode away, her designer dress swaying with each confident step.

The night air hit her face as she exited the Velvet Lounge. There, leaning casually against her Lamborghini, stood Nathan Blackwood.

Waiting. Always waiting.

"Mr. Blackwood," she drawled, arching a perfectly sculpted brow. "Don't you have corporations to run or board members to intimidate?"

Her crimson lips stood out starkly against the inky darkness, a dangerous flame in the night. The coldness in her tone could freeze hell over.

Why couldn't he take the hint? She was done with this game.

Nathan's stormy gaze darkened further, his chiseled features shadowed under the dim streetlights. When he spoke, his voice was whiskey-smooth. "Evelyn, about Vanessa Holloway. She and I—it's not what you—"

The world tilted violently as Evelyn's foot slammed on the brake pedal. Nothing. No response. The steering wheel locked in her hands as panic clawed up her throat.

The car was completely unresponsive, hurtling toward certain death. The darkness ahead seemed to yawn open, eager to swallow her whole. The streetlights blurred into streaks of cold, mocking light.

Death had never felt so close.

Then—headlights. A massive semi-truck materialized three hundred feet ahead.

Time stopped.

CRASH!

Metal screamed against asphalt as another vehicle shot out from nowhere, skidding sideways to intercept her path. The impact sent her forehead smashing into the unyielding steering wheel—no airbag, just searing pain and the coppery tang of blood.

"Evelyn!"

That voice—she knew that voice.

Strong arms wrenched the door open, lifting her onto the roadside with surprising gentleness.

Nathan Blackwood. Of course. If I died now, the Blackwoods would have a PR nightmare on their hands.

His hands trembled slightly as they brushed her forehead, assessing the damage. Each touch sent fresh waves of agony through her skull. The metallic scent of blood sharpened her senses.

His embrace felt foreign—wrong. A year ago, she would have melted into his arms. Now, all she saw were snowflakes dancing behind her eyelids as she fought to stay conscious.

With monumental effort, she shoved against his chest, using the car door to pull herself upright. His totaled Range Rover had taken the brunt of the collision—without it, she'd be paste on that truck's grille.

"Thanks." Her voice was eerily calm despite the throbbing wound.

"Evelyn, you need medical attention—"

She ignored him, already dialing Bennett. "Get to my location now. Someone sabotaged my car. I want answers before sunrise."

The call ended with a decisive click.

"Your Rover's worth four million." She scribbled a figure on a check. "Here's ten. Consider the extra your hazard pay."

Under the flickering streetlight, blood crusted her temple and her usually pristine hair fell in disarray. Yet she'd never looked more regal—a queen surveying her kingdom.

Nathan's expression turned glacial as she shoved the check into his breast pocket. "You didn't hesitate when I needed blood. Now we're even."

The satisfaction was intoxicating as she walked away. Who knew Nathan Blackwood could be put in his place?

Her silhouette stretched long and unbroken down the sidewalk, not a single falter in her stride.

She never saw the flicker of regret in his eyes as she disappeared into the night.
###Chapter 122

The internet was ablaze with outrage.

Every social media platform had turned into a battleground against the Blackwoods for their mistreatment of the vulnerable.

Yet the Blackwood family remained eerily silent amidst the storm. Speaking too soon would only confirm their guilt in the court of public opinion.

Highland Estates glowed ominously against the night sky.

Inside, the atmosphere was suffocating. No one dared to breathe too loudly except for Old Master Blackwood.

When Sterling Corporation's stocks had crashed years ago, Alexander Sterling had single-handedly salvaged the situation.

Tonight, the stock market had turned its fangs toward the Blackwoods instead.

Old Master Blackwood's face was stormy, his expression bitter. His fury only intensified when he learned Nathan hadn't returned home.

"Where the hell is he?!" The old man slammed his cane against the marble floor.

The butler trembled. "We can't reach Young Master Blackwood. His phone goes straight to voicemail, and his assistant claims ignorance of his whereabouts."

"Unbelievable!" The old man's voice boomed. "After three years of marriage, he never noticed anything unusual about Evelyn?!"

His heart pounded violently, threatening to burst from his chest. Had he known Evelyn was the Sterling heiress—a perfect match for their family—he would never have allowed her suffering under their roof.

The divorce alone was scandalous enough, but now?

They had lost everything—money, reputation, and worst of all, their priceless family heirloom!

His furious gaze snapped toward Margaret and Sophia, who stood frozen nearby.

"Useless women! You've brought nothing but disgrace to this family!"

Margaret bit her lip, resentment flashing in her eyes. "Father, Evelyn deceived us all. How is this our fault? Weren't you the one who approved her background check before the wedding?"

The old man's cane struck the floor again. "And who stole my emerald pipe? You dare speak back to me?!"

That cursed pipe haunted him more than the financial ruin.

Margaret's eyes welled with tears, but she stayed silent. Sophia, ever the coward, didn't dare breathe a word.

Then—salvation.

The butler rushed in. "Young Master has returned!"

Relief washed over the women. Finally.

Margaret's eyes reddened. With her husband Charles away on business, Nathan was her only hope to weather the old man's wrath.

She had failed as the lady of Highland Estates.

The moment Nathan stepped into the room, Old Master Blackwood hurled a priceless Ming vase at his feet.

"Decided to grace us with your presence?"

Nathan stepped over the shattered porcelain, his expression unreadable. "We'll handle this."

His grandfather scoffed. "Handle it? Your father won't return for weeks!"

"By then, it'll be too late." Nathan's lips curled into a cold smile.

The old man narrowed his eyes. "Then what do you suggest?"

Nathan's voice was ice. "Exactly what the Sterlings demand."

"Apologize."
###Chapter 123

The memory of Evelyn walking alone under the dim streetlight haunted Nathan.

Her bloodied forehead and that heartbreakingly solitary silhouette sent sharp pangs through his chest.

He owed her more than he could ever repay.

Old Master Blackwood glared at him. "If this were a sincere apology, why the anger? This just proves we wronged her!"

"Our company stocks and reputation will be ruined!"

Sophia Blackwood chimed in, "Exactly! Why must we apologize? We can settle this privately. The Sterling family's reputation isn't worth sacrificing. So what if she's William Sterling's daughter? We never forced her into marriage or divorce!"

A public apology would make Sophia the laughingstock of high society.

She couldn't bear that humiliation.

Nathan's icy stare made Sophia shrink back.

"Fine," he said coldly. "If not publicly, then we'll apologize at their doorstep."

"Absolutely not!" Margaret Blackwood protested. Having once treated Evelyn as inferior, she couldn't stomach bowing to her now.

"Enough!" Old Master Blackwood's face flushed with rage. He knew his grandson's capabilities. "Isn't there another way?"

"No." Nathan's expression darkened. "We've owed Evelyn this apology for too long."

With a heavy sigh, the old man relented. "Make the arrangements then."

"Grandpa!" Sophia whined.

Nathan turned his glacial gaze on her. "Sophia Blackwood, remember how you lost our family heirloom."

"One more misstep and you'll be cut off completely. Get a job like commoners do."

Sophia gasped. "Work? I'm a Blackwood! I'd be ridiculed!"

"Mother!" She turned to Margaret, who avoided her eyes, still guilty about the emerald pipe incident.

Nathan left without another word.

"Wait," his grandfather called. "I don't care about your affairs, but stay away from Vanessa Holloway. The Sterlings are furious, and we must repair relations."

Nathan didn't react, walking away silently.

Everyone had misunderstood his relationship with Vanessa - especially Evelyn.

Outside Blackwood Manor, Nathan called his assistant Harrison.

The PR department could draft an apology letter easily. The real challenge was Blackwood Corporation's stance.

It was a long night.

By noon the next day, as the world reeled from Evelyn's revelation as Sterling heiress, Blackwood Corporation issued a formal apology.

The letter debunked all internet rumors about Evelyn and included Nathan's personal apology for failing their marriage.

The internet exploded.

[Real-life drama! Someone pass the popcorn!]

[So they admit bullying Evelyn?]

[Indirect confession! Our Queen Evelyn is vindicated! Since her brave divorce announcement exposing the mistress, I'll always stand with her!]
###Chapter 124

Sterling Corporation.

Inside the boardroom.

All eyes were fixed on the powerful figures seated at the head of the long mahogany table. William Sterling reclined comfortably in his chair, eyes closed as he dozed off, having confidently left Alexander to oversee the proceedings.

Alexander cleared his throat and began his opening remarks before introducing Evelyn.

Evelyn had deliberately let her dark waves fall across her forehead to conceal the wound from last night’s incident. She didn’t want it drawing unnecessary attention.

"I believe everyone here is already aware that Evelyn is my father’s daughter—my sister," Alexander announced, his voice firm. "She is also the largest shareholder of Sterling Corporation. Effective immediately, I hereby appoint Evelyn Sinclair as the new Chief Executive Officer. I trust no one has any objections?"

The room remained silent.

Evelyn now commanded an empire far more expansive than before. Regardless of the whispers, she was now the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation.

As she stepped out of the boardroom, Bennett approached her, phone in hand. "President Evelyn, Ferguson Corporation has just released their public apology."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Already?"

She had expected Old Master Blackwood’s pride to drag this out for at least another week, if not longer. A quick glance at the statement had her lips curling into a cold smirk. The wording was calculated—smoothly downplaying the scandal while clinically dissecting their failed marriage.

She recognized Nathan’s handiwork instantly.

"Do we need to issue a response?" Bennett asked.

Evelyn turned on her heel, flashing him a bright smile. "My brother must have a mountain of work lined up for me. If possible, delay whatever he’s arranged. I want to personally oversee the selection process for the Kingsley Tech research program. I won’t let Ferguson Corporation snatch it from under my nose."

She would never compromise when it came to her company’s interests.

Bennett nodded. "Understood, ma’am."

"By the way," he added, "would you like to review the list of gifts for the staff? They’re ready for distribution."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Handle it as you see fit."

Her only role in this was signing the checks.

Bennett hesitated. "How’s your injury?"

He was the only one who knew about it. Otherwise, Evelyn wouldn’t have pushed through the meeting.

Her fingers brushed lightly over the concealed wound. "It’s fine. The doctor said it’s just a scratch. I’m not made of glass."

"The investigation report is already on your desk."

"Just give me the name." She was curious—who had wanted her dead?

Bennett’s expression darkened. "Vanessa Holloway."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a chilling smile, but she said nothing.
###Chapter 125

Dominic Kingsley was thrilled to hear that Evelyn Sinclair would be visiting personally and immediately gave her a call.

"President Sinclair, please bring that little troublemaker Leo with you when you come. The whole team misses him terribly."

Evelyn chuckled. "Absolutely! Consider it done."

This arrangement worked perfectly for Evelyn. She could use Leo to charm the Kingsley Tech team while keeping herself entertained during the visit.

The evening found Evelyn still buried in paperwork when the city lights flickered to life, stars beginning to dot the darkening sky.

She stretched her stiff muscles and reached for her designer handbag. Noticing the light still on in Alexander Sterling's office, a pang of guilt struck her. As CEO, she had it much easier compared to her overworked older brother.

Evelyn knocked lightly before peeking inside, finding Alexander still engaged in a video conference. He listened intently to the foreign executive's report, effortlessly catching every critical detail in the rapid-fire discussion. Spotting her, he gestured to a chair without breaking his professional demeanor.

She playfully stuck out her tongue before obediently taking a seat, quietly observing the meeting. From what she gathered, Blackwood Enterprises seemed to be facing significant challenges.

When the call finally ended, Alexander disconnected with a tap. Evelyn looked up, curiosity evident in her expression.

"Is our European division launching products similar to Blackwood's?"

Alexander nodded. "Same quality, but we're undercutting their prices. They won't survive this competition."

The targeted business strategy was unmistakable. Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

"Blackwood Enterprises issued a public apology today."

"I know. Father and I read it. But words mean nothing compared to the damage Nathan Blackwood caused you." Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Eric's clever though - their stock stabilized immediately after the apology. This minor dip means nothing to them."

Evelyn's lips thinned. "Thinking I'll go easy on them? Never." Her heart had turned to steel, impervious to softening.

"It's not just personal. Our European market share has always been split with Blackwood. This is our chance to dominate." Alexander leaned forward. "Don't forget - you're the one who broke into Europe first. You built Sterling Corporation's presence there single-handedly, making us the premier Montecito brand. Blackwood merely copied your blueprint."

His words struck a chord. Evelyn fell silent as memories flooded back. She'd nearly forgotten her own accomplishments.

In the cutthroat business world, morality took a backseat to opportunity. Within legal bounds, competition was fair game.

The past three years had made her lose sight of her worth. She'd once conquered Europe, establishing Sterling Corporation as the dominant force. That was her legacy.

Recalling these achievements reignited a fire within her.

The following evening found Evelyn alone at the private airport terminal. In the VIP lounge, her eyes immediately found the striking figure by the window - a man whose quiet intensity and effortless elegance made others instinctively respect him.

She crept up behind him and covered his eyes. "Guess who?"

The man sighed but didn't resist as she wrapped him in a bear hug. "Evelyn Mae Sinclair."

This was Donovan Sterling - world-renowned physicist, Breakthrough Prize winner at seventeen, whose groundbreaking papers were published in elite journals and revered by the scientific community.

Perhaps because his professional brilliance overshadowed everything else, few bothered to investigate his background. The scientific prodigy was, in fact, William Sterling's second son.

Donovan examined his sister critically before reaching out to touch her forehead.

Evelyn flinched away. "What was that for?"

"You got hurt?" His expression darkened.

"Just bumped into a doorframe," she lied smoothly.

Donovan accepted this with a nod. "Clumsy as ever."

As they walked, Donovan casually asked, "Heard you got married?"

Having spent five years abroad on classified research projects, he only occasionally exchanged messages with Lucas during rare breaks. Clearly, Evelyn's marriage had been a family scandal.

He produced a black credit card from his pocket. "All my prize money. Consider it a wedding gift."

The sum was astronomical. Since childhood, Donovan had always given his winnings to his little sister.

Evelyn blinked. "Actually, I just got divorced."

"Then it's a divorce gift." Donovan adjusted his designer suitcase, his face betraying no emotion whatsoever.
###Chapter 126

Evelyn giggled playfully and approached Donovan.

"Donny, could you do me a tiny favor? Consider it a birthday gift?"

Instead of answering immediately, Donovan raised an eyebrow.

"What kind of favor?"

She clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'm working on an AI project. Since you're literally the smartest person I know, could you help me with a small part of it?"

Evelyn batted her lashes, laying the flattery on thick.

Donovan was a national treasure—a genius whose brilliance was practically criminal to waste. But then again, what was the point of having a genius brother if she couldn't exploit his brain once in a while?

He considered for a moment before nodding. "Fine. I have a month off. Will that be enough?"

"More than enough!"

Before he could change his mind, Evelyn snatched the black credit card from his hand and waved it triumphantly. "And I'll be taking this too. Thanks, Donny!"

Donovan sighed, already regretting his decision.

Nearby, two sharply dressed men lingered in the shadows, watching the Sterling siblings with keen interest. They had been staking out the area all night, waiting for a certain elusive genius to appear.

Tristan Whitmore checked his phone for the tenth time. "Where the hell are those photos Harrison was supposed to send?"

His elbow nudged Nathan Blackwood's arm. "Well, well. Look who it is—Evelyn Sinclair."

Beside her stood a man they didn't recognize. Tall, composed, with an air of quiet intelligence. He didn’t carry himself like a businessman, but something far more intriguing.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn. Her dark waves cascaded over her shoulders, her emerald-green halter dress hugging every curve. The stilettos made her legs look endless.

She was laughing at something the man said, her smile radiant.

Nathan moved before he realized it, drawn toward her voice like a moth to flame.

"Why the sudden divorce?" Donovan asked casually.

Evelyn shrugged. "Because he died."

"Oh." Donovan accepted this with the same indifference as if she'd told him the weather.

Nathan and Tristan froze mid-step.

The allegedly deceased man in question stared at Evelyn's back, his expression unreadable.

Tristan burst out laughing and clapped Nathan on the shoulder. "Well, damn. You're officially a ghost."

His phone finally buzzed. Tristan glanced down—and nearly choked.

The photo was unmistakable.

It was the man standing right next to Evelyn.

Tristan's voice cracked. "No freaking way."

Nathan snatched the phone, his eyes widening.

Evelyn turned at the commotion, her smile vanishing the second she spotted them. "Ugh. Not you two again."

Tristan forced a grin and stepped forward. "Fancy meeting you here, Ms. Sterling!" He glanced at Donovan, barely containing his excitement. "This is—"

He couldn't even finish. The man they'd been hunting for months was right here, casually chatting with Evelyn like it was nothing.

And worse—they looked close.

Donovan nodded politely. "Hello. I'm Dr. Soren."

A pseudonym. One the world knew him by, though few had ever seen his face.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Are you stalking me now? Because I swear, you two pop up like bad pennies."

Tristan hesitated. Should he lie? But if he did, they'd lose this chance.

"We weren't stalking you," he said quickly. "We're here to meet a friend. Total coincidence!"

Evelyn gave him a flat look. "Then hurry up and disappear."

"Right. On it." Tristan turned to leave.

Nathan didn't move.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, dark and unreadable, before shifting to Donovan. "Dr. Soren," he said slowly. "You two are friends?"

Donovan slid an arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "The best."

He wasn't lying.

In Donovan's world, "friends" were a rare commodity. He had exactly three—his siblings.

Evelyn tugged Donovan's arm. "Let's go."

She didn't spare Nathan a single glance.
###Chapter 127

Tristan Whitmore let out a heavy sigh.

"Well, well. We've completely lost our advantage now."

The legendary Donovan Sterling and Evelyn Sinclair not only knew each other but shared such a close bond!

Donovan's return had been kept strictly confidential—his entire itinerary was classified.

Given his highly sensitive position, it made sense.

They had spent a fortune on the international black market just to obtain details about Donovan's flight, and now, all that effort had gone to waste.

Nathan Blackwood shot Tristan a cold look before walking away without another word.

Meanwhile, Donovan and Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor.

Before they even stepped out of the car, they could hear the commotion inside—Archibald instructing the maids to tend to the garden tomorrow, Lucas's dramatic wailing, and William's furious shouting echoing from the living room.

Donovan paused at the doorway, glancing at Evelyn.

"Find me a place. Somewhere quiet. Preferably with no neighbors."

Evelyn blinked. "A haunted house?"

"That works."

As long as there are no humans around me, Donovan thought.

The moment the door opened, Lucas sprinted toward them, nearly tackling Evelyn.

"You're finally back! Save me!"

Evelyn scoffed, but before she could respond, Lucas froze at the sight of Donovan.

His jaw dropped.

"Donovan?"

A rare smile tugged at Donovan's lips. "Little L."

Lucas's panic vanished instantly. "How many times have I told you guys not to call me that?!"

"It makes me sound like a kid!"

"Who is it?" William's booming voice carried through the hall as he stormed out, baseball bat in hand.

The moment he spotted Donovan, his anger melted into excitement.

"Donovan!"

Donovan endured the enthusiastic embraces from the three men of the family.

Alexander was the most composed, but even he couldn't hide the pleased curve of his lips.

Archibald immediately sprang into action, ordering the staff to prepare a feast and ready Donovan's old room.

After three long years, the Sterling family was finally whole again.

Evelyn frowned at the chaos in the house. "What's going on here?"

At the mention of it, William's temper flared again.

"I asked your brother to cook, and this idiot threw out my prized Alba white truffle! He had the nerve to tell me it was just a deformed potato!"

William grabbed his bat, glaring at Lucas.

"I'm not letting this slide today!"

Alexander remained seated, his gaze steady on Donovan. "You're staying? What's next for you?"

Donovan accepted a glass of sparkling water from Archibald and took a sip.

"National Laboratories extended an invitation. I've decided to accept, but I won't be leaving for another month."

National Laboratories was a top-tier research institute with cutting-edge facilities, a place where even the brightest minds struggled to gain entry.

For Donovan, it had been a long-considered decision.

Alexander nodded in approval.

Evelyn cut in. "Donovan promised he'd help with Kingsley Tech's R&D project this month! That way, we won't let them outmaneuver us—we'll take the lead!"

Alexander's expression stiffened. His stunned gaze flickered between Donovan and Evelyn, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for his brother.

"Then... good luck."

Is a project this small even worth Donovan's time?

This sister really knows how to make the most of everything.

A few days later, once Donovan was well-rested, Evelyn began preparing for their move into Kingsley Tech.

The morning air was crisp, the weather perfect.

Evelyn dragged Donovan out the door, stopping first at her apartment to pick up Leo.

The AI tiger perked up at their arrival, leaping into Evelyn's arms.

"Mama! I missed you so much!"

"I missed you too, Leo. You didn't wreck the place, did you?"

Evelyn glanced around—the apartment was spotless.

This clever little tiger knew how to operate her smart home system.

There were even a few new packages scattered around, likely more gadgets Leo had ordered.

Leo nuzzled into Evelyn's arms sheepishly.

"I... might have used your credit card."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

She turned to Donovan, holding Leo up. "This is Leo. Leo, meet my second brother."

Leo's eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Wow! The Great Donovan Sterling! I'm your biggest fan!"

Evelyn immediately clamped a hand over his mouth.

"Stop embarrassing me!"

Donovan studied the AI tiger with mild interest, lifting it with one hand.

"World-class quantum physics system, advanced learning capabilities, adaptive temperature and moisture regulation... Who gave this to you?"

Leo beamed. "Emily Whitaker! The girl who added you on social media! I traded your contact info for it!"

Donovan shot Evelyn a dry look.

"Are you even my sister?"
###Chapter 128

Emily must adore you deeply to have programmed Leo with your data. That's why it's reacting this way. By the way, she's also part of Kingsley Tech's research team, so you'll meet her shortly.

Donovan casually tossed Leo toward Evelyn, who caught the AI tiger with careful hands.

"Leo, let's go find Emily!"

"But I want the Great Goddess to hold me!" Leo squirmed in Evelyn's arms, its mechanical voice tinged with childish petulance.

Evelyn could never refuse the adorable AI's requests. She quickened her pace to catch up with Donovan.

"Second Brother..."

Donovan had seen countless AI robots before and wasn't as enamored as Evelyn. To him, they were just sophisticated machines he could recreate at will.

When they arrived at Kingsley Tech headquarters, Leo immediately became the center of attention.

"Little Traitor, did you miss us?" one researcher teased.

Leo lifted its chin with mechanical haughtiness. "Who are you people?"

The crowd burst into laughter at its programmed sass.

Soon, someone escorted Leo to Emily Whitaker while Dominic Kingsley led their group of seven to the designated meeting area.

During the walk, Dominic kept glancing back at Donovan. "This gentleman seems familiar somehow..."

Before Evelyn could introduce him, Donovan spoke first. "My name is Sunner. We've never met."

Dominic nodded, unfazed. "Recent graduate? No matter - if Evelyn brought you, you must be exceptional."

Evelyn deliberately didn't mention wanting Donovan for the core R&D team. She wasn't interested in trade secrets, just staying ahead of industry developments. Donovan's true identity needed to remain hidden.

As they exited the elevator, Evelyn spotted another group approaching. Nathan Blackwood looked every inch the aristocratic CEO as he led his team of seven. Dominic stepped forward. "What a coincidence - all three project leads arriving together!"

"Mr. Blackwood, it's rare to see you personally leading a project team." Evelyn kept her tone professional despite the irritation bubbling beneath the surface.

Nathan's gaze flickered over Evelyn before settling on Dominic. "I've reviewed the site. My team will handle our own equipment needs. Since we're all here, let's begin." Evelyn walked past without another glance.

Nathan watched her retreating figure with unreadable intensity. Dominic clapped Nathan's shoulder with amusement. "Don't stare. She's President Sinclair now - even less likely to look back. Starting to regret things?"

Nathan's icy glare could freeze lava. "Mind your own business."

Dominic chuckled. "Then tell me your sudden personal involvement in this project has nothing to do with her?"

Initially, Dominic hadn't believed the exes would reconnect. But ever since Nathan asked him to arrange that dinner invitation, suspicions grew. Seeing Nathan here now confirmed them.

As they walked, Nathan frowned. "Do you have Stanton Corporation's participant list?"

Dominic forwarded it from his phone - non-confidential information anyway. "Sunner? Who's this?"

"Probably some new graduate," Dominic shrugged.

Nathan's lips curved slightly before schooling his expression. 'Evelyn actually convinced a national-level expert to join a commercial project? Impressive.'

He'd secretly hoped to recruit Donovan for this venture himself. With the renowned scientist involved, success was guaranteed. 'What an interesting coincidence,' Nathan mused.

Dominic found Nathan's sudden interest in a "student" peculiar.

Entering the conference room, Nathan's mood darkened further seeing Evelyn and "Sunner" whispering closely together, their heads nearly touching.

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw as he strode purposefully to the seat opposite Evelyn, his entire demeanor radiating displeasure.

Dominic took the head seat with an amused sigh. "On behalf of Kingsley Tech, I officially welcome our two partners. Regarding this research initiative, Blackwood Corporation has already deployed their team. Ms. Sinclair, who will represent your side?"

Evelyn smiled at Donovan. "Sunner, you'll handle this."

She unconsciously grasped Donovan's sleeve - a childhood habit. Donovan patted her hand affectionately in response.

Nathan's frown deepened at their familiar interaction.

Dominic nodded. "Excellent. He can meet with Emily Whitaker afterward."

Nathan's cold voice cut through. "Not just anyone qualifies for this clearance."

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly. "I decide who represents Sterling Corporation."
###Chapter 129

The tension in the room lingered like an unspoken threat.

To Evelyn's relief, Nathan Blackwood didn't press the matter further. The discussion shifted to finalizing the project's direction.

The meeting dragged on for over an hour. By the time it concluded, rain had begun pelting against the windows.

As attendees rushed to their vehicles, they discovered the entrance steps had become a shallow pond from the downpour.

Evelyn hesitated at the threshold. Her custom Laurent Dubois heels, dazzling with embedded diamonds, weren't meant for wading through puddles.

The Sterling Corporation's Rolls-Royce waited just beyond the flooded area, the driver unable to maneuver closer through the downpour.

Donovan Sterling noticed his sister's predicament. With only one umbrella available, he automatically positioned it over Evelyn's head. "Shall we?"

Evelyn bit her lip, pointing her toes experimentally. "These diamonds will tarnish if they get wet."

Donovan's gaze swept over her outfit - the chic mini dress that made traditional carrying positions impossible without risking indecency.

Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tailored jacket and tossed it onto the flooded steps. Holding the umbrella steady with one hand, he extended the other. "Problem solved. Let's go."

Evelyn sighed dramatically but accepted the compromise.

She placed her hand in Donovan's, stepped delicately onto the sacrificed jacket, and slipped into the waiting car.

The driver witnessing this exchange mentally calculated his job security. Two other observers had very different reactions.

Dominic Kingsley shook his head in disbelief. "Now I understand what real diva behavior looks like! That woman probably complains if her champagne bubbles aren't perfectly symmetrical, yet you treated her like yesterday's news!"

Nathan's stormy gaze followed the departing vehicle, his jaw tightening. He knew exactly who Donovan Sterling really was.

Even world leaders vied for that man's attention, yet here he was playing footman to Evelyn. Their relationship clearly transcended professional boundaries. Just how close were they?

"Nikki!" A familiar voice cut through the rain.

Emily Whitaker came bounding toward them, Leo the mechanical tiger clutched in her arms. Evelyn brightened immediately, whispering to Donovan, "That's Emily Whitaker. She's brilliant but...enthusiastic."

Donovan barely had time to frown before Emily skidded to a stop before them. Her eyes widened comically when she recognized him.

"Holy mother of silicon chips! The Tech Titan!" Without ceremony, she dumped Leo in a puddle and launched herself at Donovan.

The renowned scientist turned sheet-white as Emily wrapped herself around him like human ivy.

"Unhand me this instant!" Donovan peeled her off with visible distress, his ears turning pink. "Have you no sense of personal space?"

Emily, starstruck beyond reason, barely registered the rejection. She gazed up at her idol with undisguised awe. "I'm Emily Whitaker! You've mentored me through seventeen failed prototypes!"

Donovan gave her a withering once-over. "Yes. The one who couldn't differentiate between binary code and baking instructions."

As Emily's face fell, Evelyn pinched Donovan's arm sharply.

He amended grudgingly, "Though Leo shows promise. Durable construction. Decent AI framework."

Emily's smile returned full-force. "He's just a prototype! I can make him smarter!"

The soggy mechanical tiger swiped at her ankle. "Smarter than you, meatbag!"

Emily ignored the insult, turning excitedly to Evelyn. "You know The Tech Titan? Is he your-"

"Friend," Evelyn interjected smoothly, linking arms with Donovan. "Be nice. She's my friend, not one of your unfortunate graduate students."

Donovan exhaled through his nose but remained silent.

Emily practically vibrated with excitement, shooting Evelyn a meaningful look.

Evelyn added, "He'll be consulting on our project. Emily, make sure he doesn't intimidate the entire R&D department."

Emily's jaw dropped. "The Tech Titan...taking orders from me?!"

Noting Emily's overwhelmed expression, Evelyn leaned close. "His involvement stays confidential for now."

Emily nodded dumbly.

As they prepared to leave, Evelyn's skirt caught in the car door. She yelped in surprise.

Donovan abandoned the umbrella without hesitation, kneeling to carefully free the delicate fabric. Noticing Emily's stunned expression, he said coolly, "Dispose of that for me," nodding toward the discarded jacket.

Before Emily could respond, Donovan slid into the car and shut the door, leaving her standing in the rain.

From his puddle, Leo grumbled, "Somebody remember the AI tiger?!"
###Chapter 130

Dominic Kingsley and Nathan Blackwood approached Emily Whitaker with measured steps.

Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "Emily, do you recognize the gentleman standing beside Ms. Sinclair?"

Emily remained transfixed by the sight of the formidable Donovan Sterling lowering himself to cater to Evelyn's every need. The scene stirred equal parts envy and admiration in her heart.

What a perfect match they make!

Her head bobbed in automatic agreement before she caught herself and shook it vehemently.

Evelyn had sworn her to secrecy!

Nathan's eyes narrowed to slits as Emily scooped up the discarded suit jacket and umbrella from the pavement. "I'm just a researcher," she muttered, fleeing the scene. "Business negotiations aren't my forte!"

Leo's mechanical eyes darted between the men as its internal systems prepared to dial Evelyn. A large hand intercepted the movement mid-air.

Nathan studied the robotic tiger with growing suspicion. "Do you still remember me?" His voice carried restrained fury.

The AI tiger thrashed its mechanical limbs in protest. "Jerk! I want Mommy!" it declared in halting tones.

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "This little traitor used to adore you, Nathan. When did you become 'jerk' in its programming?"

Leo turned its head away with a mechanical sniff. "Unworthy!"

After all, its loyalty followed Evelyn's commands without question. Nathan's face darkened dangerously just as Harrison arrived with an umbrella.

Before the assistant could speak, Leo chirped, "Daddy! Kisses!"

Harrison froze like a statue, nearly dropping the umbrella under Nathan's glacial stare. "I swear I've never—"

"Daddy, you're so handsome!" Leo continued cheerfully.

Dominic erupted into laughter while Harrison looked ready to faint. "This isn't funny!" the assistant protested.

Their attention snapped to the returning Rolls-Royce. Nathan's expression turned arctic as the car door opened.

Donovan emerged, extending a hand. "I'm here for Leo."

Nathan practically threw the robotic tiger at him, his temper barely contained. His sharp gaze swept the empty backseat—Evelyn's absence spoke volumes.

"Donovan," Dominic began with deliberate casualness, "are you and Evelyn involved?"

The scientist's expression remained impassive. "That's classified."

Dominic smirked and gestured toward Nathan. "Do you know who this is?"

Donovan studied Nathan briefly before shaking his head. "Should I?"

Before Dominic could explain, Nathan bit out, "I'm her dead ex-husband." The words Evelyn had used at the airport still burned.

Donovan nodded once. "Then I definitely shouldn't tell you." With that, he disappeared into the luxury vehicle.

Dominic's laughter followed the departing car. "He's got the same sharp tongue as Ms. Sinclair!"

Nathan's murderous glare silenced him instantly.

Meanwhile, Donovan collected Evelyn from a nearby station platform. She cradled Leo remorsefully. "I'm so sorry, baby. Mommy didn't mean to leave you behind!"

The robotic tiger nuzzled against her dramatically. "Then I want a Mesgarzadeh rug!"

Evelyn blinked. While other pets demanded treats, hers had developed a taste for luxury decor. "Fine," she sighed. "You win."

Donovan shot the machine a disdainful look. What a spoiled little beast.
###Chapter 131

Donovan Sterling glanced at his phone and frowned.

His patience was wearing thin as he meticulously corrected the form sent by Emily Whitaker. Perfectionism was both his strength and his curse.

To find the perfect office for Donovan, Evelyn Sinclair decided to bring Isabella Montgomery along to the nearest real estate agency.

The two women paused in front of an upscale property sales office.

"Does your family even need more properties? Sterling Corporation owns half the city—can't you just pick one?" Isabella raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn shook her head. "No, those are all commercial spaces—too loud, too crowded. Donovan would hate it."

This particular agency exuded quiet luxury, clearly catering to high-end clientele.

"This is a Kensington Group property. Ms. Sinclair, are you sure you're in the right place?"

A cold, familiar voice cut through the air behind her.

Evelyn turned, meeting the woman’s icy gaze.

"Olivia Kensington?"

A slow smirk curved Evelyn’s lips. "Even better."

"You're not welcome here. Get out."

Olivia’s tone was sharp, her expression shifting from professional to venomous in an instant.

If it weren’t for Evelyn, Olivia wouldn’t have fallen from a high-powered executive to a mere sales agent. Industry rivals had used her scandal to crush her reputation. Her life had spiraled into ruin.

"Did I hear that right?" Isabella scoffed. "You're telling us to leave?"

"Yes. Get out. This office won’t serve you." Olivia’s arrogance was palpable.

Without hesitation, Evelyn tapped her phone screen a few times.

"Who doesn’t know how to make a scene?"

Within moments, a composed sales manager approached, her eyes widening slightly when she recognized Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair? Is there a problem?"

"Is she your employee?" Isabella tilted her chin, disdain dripping from her words.

The manager glanced at Olivia and forced a polite smile.

"Olivia is one of our top agents—studied abroad, elite education, comes from a wealthy family but chose to build her own career. She’s well-liked here. Did something happen?"

Evelyn’s gaze darkened with amusement. Olivia’s face twitched before she plastered on a fake smile.

"Manager, it’s just a misunderstanding. Let me handle this."

Evelyn tapped her phone again—this time, playing a recording at full volume.

"You're not welcome here. Get out. This office won’t serve you."

Olivia’s face drained of color.

The manager’s expression hardened. "Olivia, you’re fired."

"You can’t do this!" Olivia’s voice cracked. "She’s Evelyn Sinclair—she came here to humiliate me!"

"Enough!" The manager snapped. "The client is always right. Pack your things and leave."

"On what grounds?" Olivia seethed.

"Because I’m the client." Evelyn smirked. "And Olivia? Since when were you a wealthy heiress?"

Every word the manager had praised her for was a lie.

Evelyn leaned back, interlacing her fingers, her smile sweet and mocking.

"Trying to prove something? Olivia Kensington, you were never in my league."

Security arrived. If Olivia didn’t leave willingly, they’d escort her out.

Evelyn’s laughter was light, her eyes glinting with victory.

"Did you really think you could win?"
###Chapter 132

Blackwood Corporation President's Office.

The silence was so profound you could hear the second hand ticking on the antique grandfather clock.

Nathan Blackwood drummed his fingers rhythmically against the mahogany desk, each tap making Harrison's shoulders tense further.

His piercing gaze darkened as he spoke in an icy tone. "She went to purchase property at our sales office?"

Harrison stood at attention. "Yes, sir. The sales team confirmed it personally. I've reviewed the security footage."

"Ms. Sinclair arrived with Ms. Montgomery. They're still there as we speak."

Nathan's stormy eyes narrowed. After a weighted pause, he rose abruptly. "Let's go see what this is about."

Though Nathan couldn't fathom Evelyn's motives, he needed to witness this bizarre situation firsthand.

"Right away, sir." Harrison nodded, already feeling the atmospheric shift around his boss.

Nathan's reactions where Evelyn was concerned always defied expectation.

The sales director was enthusiastically presenting luxury penthouse options. "Ms. Sinclair, does this floorplan suit your needs? Will you be residing here personally?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's a gift actually. For a bachelor recently returned from overseas." She tapped the brochure decisively. "Replace any existing furnishings with Swiss imports - top quality only. Price is no object."

"My brother deserves nothing but the best."

"Yes, of course, miss-"

Nathan froze in the doorway, his entire body going rigid. 'She's buying property for some bachelor? That damned Sebastian Hart?' The scandalous headlines practically wrote themselves: [Evelyn Sinclair Purchases Blackwood Property to House New Lover - How Pathetic!]

(Honestly, this situation was almost comical. Only Evelyn could pull such a bold move. Maybe Mr. Blackwood should personally recommend properties for his ex-wife's new man!)

The paperwork was straightforward. Evelyn barely glanced at the contract - she'd chosen this unit for its rare combination of privacy and panoramic views.

If the interior didn't meet standards, she'd simply have it gutted and redesigned. Hardly an inconvenience.

After signing, she checked the time on her platinum Jaeger-LeCoultre watch. "I'll process payment now." As she reached for her clutch, sudden commotion erupted at the entrance.

The sales director immediately bowed. "Good afternoon, President Blackwood!"

Nathan approached Evelyn, his voice deceptively calm. "Made your selection?" He'd heard every damning word, yet still asked - a glutton for punishment.

Evelyn didn't turn at his voice, though she felt the heat of his stare burning between her shoulder blades.

The room's atmosphere turned arctic.

The sales director cleared his throat nervously. "Since President Blackwood is here personally, and you're... acquainted, we could extend our corporate discount-"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as shattered glass. "We're not friends. Keep your discount."

Tension thickened to suffocating levels.

Finally, Evelyn turned to meet Nathan's stormy gaze head-on. "Does every client receive personal attention from the CEO? Or am I just... special?"

"You've always been special, Evelyn," Nathan murmured, his voice rough.

Her eyebrow arched. "Special how? Because I'm Sterling Corporation's CEO now? Is this VIP treatment?"

Nathan stepped closer, invading her space. "You're my ex-wife. That makes you different from anyone else."
###Chapter 133

The word "ex-wife" left a bitter taste in Nathan Blackwood's mouth.

An inexplicable tightness gripped his chest.

"Which property catches your eye? I'll purchase it for you," Nathan offered abruptly.

His mind flashed back to the Lumière Fashion Week, where Evelyn Sinclair had playfully demanded a yacht from Lucas Sterling.

That memory stung like salt in an open wound.

Nathan realized with sudden clarity that he'd never gifted Evelyn anything during their marriage.

Perhaps if she accepted this gesture now, the gnawing guilt might subside.

Evelyn's laughter rang hollow, her emerald eyes devoid of warmth.

"How generous of you, Mr. Blackwood. Is this how you treat all your exes?"

Nathan's jaw tightened as he started to respond, but Evelyn cut him off sharply. "You said it yourself - I'm your ex-wife. That means we're strangers now. I won't accept anything from you, lest your family accuses me of being a gold digger again."

She turned to the sales agent. "I'll be paying in full." The thought of owing Nathan anything, especially for something so trivial, turned her stomach. The Blackwood fortune was the last thing she wanted to touch.

The agent hesitated, glancing nervously between Evelyn and Nathan, whose expression darkened by the second. Harrison discreetly signaled the agent to proceed, understanding the tension better than most.

Nathan's phone shattered the silence. The caller's panicked voice carried clearly: "Emergency! Vanessa Holloway's been in a car accident - she's lost critical blood volume!"

Evelyn didn't need to strain to hear. That name always triggered her instincts like a sixth sense.

Nathan's face drained of color, a storm of emotions brewing beneath his carefully controlled exterior.

"I'm on my way." He ended the call, his obsidian eyes locking onto Evelyn's. "Vanessa—"

"Spare me the details," Evelyn interrupted with a mocking smile. "Really, Nathan, how naive can you be? Does Ms. Holloway have nine lives? She miraculously survives every time you come running."

Nathan's entire body went rigid, his knuckles whitening around his phone.

"Thank goodness I declined your gift. Otherwise, I might be expected to donate blood to your precious Vanessa. Save your mansion for her - pray she lives long enough to actually become your wife." Evelyn's words dripped with venom as she turned her back on him.

Nathan stood rooted to the spot, his expression thunderous.

"Sir, we should leave immediately," Harrison urged, having received his own urgent call from the hospital.

At Montecito General Hospital...

Tristan Whitmore stood sentinel outside the private ward while Sophia Blackwood cowered in the corner, her entire body trembling.

"What happened?" Nathan's voice could have frozen hell over.

Tristan pointed an accusing finger at Sophia. "Ask her."

Under her brother's withering glare, Sophia finally broke. "It's not my fault! Blame that witch Evelyn! She drove Vanessa to this!"

Nathan's eyes turned glacial. "Explain yourself."

He'd just been with Evelyn - there was no possible way she could be involved in Vanessa's accident.

Sophia dissolved into hysterical sobs. "Vanessa said Evelyn only hates our family because of her! That if she died, Evelyn would stop tormenting us! So she ran into traffic - don't you see? Evelyn might as well have pushed her herself!"
###Chapter 134

Tristan was at a loss for words, rubbing his temples in frustration.

He rose from his seat, giving Nathan's shoulder a firm pat before exhaling heavily. "I'm not switching sides, but Evelyn is genuinely innocent this time."

Evelyn's disdain was solely directed at Nathan, yet Vanessa had somehow twisted it into some imagined rivalry. Since when had the proud Vanessa Holloway become so paranoid? She was creating drama where none existed. With another weary sigh, Tristan walked away.

Sophia, meanwhile, couldn't stop hurling insults at Evelyn—though her hatred ran deeper than just Vanessa’s influence.

She despised Evelyn, seething with jealousy over how effortlessly Evelyn had become the Sterling heiress overnight. Overnight, Evelyn’s status had skyrocketed among the elite.

And what about men? Sophia thought bitterly.

Their positions had completely reversed. Now, Sophia was the one looked down upon. Her family had turned against her, cutting off her allowance—all because of that damned emerald Evelyn had taken.

"Evelyn ruined my life!" Sophia muttered under her breath.

"Enough!" Nathan’s icy voice cut through the room.

Sophia recoiled, tears streaming as she stormed out, wailing, "You're all against me!"

Nathan remained by the door, his expression dark and unreadable. Inside the hospital room, Vanessa sat quietly, her face unnaturally pale.

Harrison returned with an update. "Mr. Blackwood, the hospital has sufficient Rh-null blood in stock. Ms. Holloway’s injuries are minor—just superficial abrasions."

Nathan’s mind flashed back to Evelyn’s mocking words: "Mr. Blackwood, are you really this dense? Does Vanessa have nine lives? She miraculously survives every time you’re around."

Vanessa’s eyes brightened the moment Nathan stepped inside. "Nathan… if only I had died, I wouldn’t be such a burden. Did Evelyn give you trouble? She’s gone too far this time!"

Nathan’s gaze was frigid, his voice detached. "Too far? She donated blood to save you, and this is how you repay her? Not even a word of thanks?"

Vanessa’s face drained of color.

She stammered, "N-no, that’s not what I meant! Of course, I’m grateful, but she lied about her identity—"

Nathan’s expression remained stone-cold. "And what does that have to do with you?"

Aside from William Sterling ejecting Vanessa from the anniversary gala—where she had been an uninvited guest—Evelyn had done nothing to her.

Nathan stood rigid, an unshakable irritation simmering in his chest. His tone was final. "Once Theodore Hart’s memorial is over, you’re returning to France. The medical care there is better suited for your recovery. After three months, I’m cutting off your allowance. You’re not disabled—find a way to support yourself."

Vanessa’s eyes widened in panic. "Nathan, please—!"

Tristan cleared his throat from the doorway. "Come on, it’s just money. Why be so harsh?"

Nathan didn’t give them a chance to argue. He grabbed his jacket and strode out.

"If it’s nothing to you, then you take over."

Tristan froze, his lips twitching. "I—I can’t. My funds are tied up."

Vanessa felt like discarded trash, humiliation burning through her. Her fingers clenched the fabric of her gown, trembling with rage.
###Chapter 135

Before dawn broke, another scandal erupted.

Paparazzi shots of Nathan Blackwood entering and exiting the hospital went viral across social media.

The headline screamed: Blackwood's Mystery Woman Hospitalized - Secret Affair Exposed!

Accompanying the article was a damning photo of Vanessa Holloway lying in a hospital bed while Nathan stood by the doorway, gazing at her with unmistakable tenderness.

[That's definitely love! How shameless of that homewrecker to think she could replace Evelyn!]

[Rich men have no morals. Though you've got to admit, she's got skills!]

[Queen Evelyn should focus on her empire. Who needs a man when you're that powerful?]

[My ship has officially sunk. No reconciliation now, but stay strong Evelyn! We still adore you!]

[Is there a waiting list to date CEO Sinclair? Asking for a friend...]

Evelyn woke to her phone buzzing before she could share her exciting news with Donovan about finding him a new lab space.

Isabella's calls were more reliable than any alarm clock. "Evie! Have you seen the trending news? Nathan Blackwood is making headlines again!"

Evelyn groaned, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Gossip or actual scandal?"

"Full-blown scandal!" Isabella declared. "The internet's going wild over it."

With a sigh, Evelyn grabbed her tablet and opened the trending tab. Sure enough, Nathan's name dominated the feed - alongside hers. Her lips twisted in irritation. "Why am I dragged into this again?"

"Don't worry, you're not the main character this time," Isabella reassured. Whenever Evelyn's name appeared with Nathan's, it never spelled anything good.

Evelyn made a dismissive sound. "Not discussing him. I'm going for my morning run." If Vanessa had actually perished in that accident, Evelyn might have popped champagne. But since the woman persisted in making her existence everyone's problem...

The crisp morning air carried the fresh scent of rain, invigorating her senses.

After texting Donovan the new lab address, Evelyn headed out with just her phone.

The moment she stepped beyond her gated community, a swarm of cameras and microphones assaulted her.

"Ms. Sinclair! Is it true about Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Holloway?"
"Did you order the hit on Vanessa's car?"
"Will Sterling Corp continue partnering with Blackwood Enterprises?"

Before Evelyn could respond, someone jostled her, sending her phone clattering to the pavement. She couldn't even bend to retrieve it amidst the chaos. Why were these vultures camped at her home? If they wanted dirt on Nathan and Vanessa, why not harass them instead?

Evelyn stumbled backward, panic rising.

Just as she teetered off balance, a strong arm encircled her waist. Lucas's chiseled profile came into view, his usually charming features dark with fury.

Evelyn's eyes inexplicably stung.

Lucas shielded her against his chest, glaring daggers at the reporters. "Which outlets do you represent?" His voice could have frozen hell.

The crowd hesitated but didn't lower their devices.

While Lucas's unexpected appearance was newsworthy, seasoned journalists knew better than to cross him. Rumors spoke of an entertainment magazine that once tried exposing his private life - only to mysteriously go bankrupt within weeks.

A rookie reporter, unaware of this unspoken rule, pressed forward. "Ms. Sinclair, what's your relationship with Lucas Sterling? Care to comment on Nathan Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway? Did you have any involvement in the accident?"
###Chapter 136

Evelyn Sinclair was seething with barely contained rage.

How dare they ambush her like this?

Her fists clenched involuntarily, nails digging into her palms.

Lucas Sterling's presence beside her gave her courage.

"Excuse me, I'm not some celebrity who has to entertain your ridiculous questions. One more step and I'm calling security."

Her voice rang out sharp and unyielding.

Did they think she was some desperate starlet who'd cower before scandal?

"Let me make this crystal clear - Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Holloway deserve each other. As for her secret identity, that's as much a surprise to me as anyone. But accusing me without evidence? That's beyond absurd."

She paused dramatically.

"If Vanessa gets struck by lightning tomorrow, will you blame me for controlling the weather too?"

A few reporters couldn't suppress nervous chuckles at her sarcasm.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before delivering her final blow.

"From now on, keep my name out of your filthy tabloid stories about those two. And don't you dare try to use my reputation to boost your pathetic clickbait!"

With that, she turned on her heel and stormed off, leaving Lucas behind.

The reporters exchanged uneasy glances. Only the Sterling siblings would dare speak to the press like this. They shuffled awkwardly, unsure whether to pursue the story.

Lucas's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "No questions for me? Not even about my relationship with Evelyn? Or how I feel about Nathan's little scandal?"

Though it was exactly what they wanted to ask, the reporters knew better than to provoke Lucas Sterling. As they began dispersing, Lucas grabbed the lead journalist's arm.

"Leaving so soon?" His voice dropped to a threatening whisper.

The veteran reporter paled. "W-we have nothing else to ask, Mr. Sterling."

"Morning Chronicle, right?" Lucas's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Shall I call your editor? Maybe discuss how your rag will be blacklisted from every red carpet event this season?"

The other reporters scattered like frightened rabbits.

The lead journalist swallowed hard. "Alright! I'll talk!"

Lucas adjusted the man's collar with mock gentleness. "Smart choice. Cooperation ensures... future opportunities."

Through gritted teeth, the reporter confessed, "It was Sophia Blackwood."

Lucas's eyes turned glacial. Leaning in, he whispered instructions that made the reporter blanch. When the man hesitated, Lucas scoffed. "Unwilling? Plenty of other outlets would jump at this exclusive."

"I'll do it!" The reporter agreed hastily, knowing refusal meant career suicide. He bitterly regretted taking Sophia's bribe.

Lucas shoved a check into the man's pocket. "Consider this an advance. And remember - if I see Evelyn's name in your gutter press again..."

The reporter dared one final question. "What exactly is your relationship with Ms. Sinclair?"

Lucas's gaze turned predatory. "I protect what's mine. You figure out the rest."

The man fled without another word.

With a satisfied smirk, Lucas picked up Evelyn's dropped phone and strolled back upstairs.

He found her dressed for work. "Still here?" she asked coolly.

Lucas flicked her forehead. "Ungrateful brat." He tossed her the phone. "Hire security. You're not some nobody anymore - keep that fire you showed downstairs."

Evelyn snatched the phone and dialed Horizon Media's CEO right in front of him.

"Dominic? I don't care what it costs. I want Nathan Blackwood exposed as a cheating bastard and Vanessa Holloway's reputation in ruins. Make it trend for three days straight."
###Chapter 137

Lucas realized he had severely misjudged his sister's capabilities.

Hearing Evelyn's sharp retort to the reporter, he regretted being too lenient with the instructions he'd given the journalist earlier.

"Impressive! She's finally showing her true strength!" Lucas thought with pride.

Evelyn ended the call with icy composure and turned to Lucas. "I have a meeting at the office. What are your plans?"

Seeing how unaffected she was by the media storm, Lucas grinned mischievously. "I was thinking of taking Leo home. Dad's been driving me crazy lately - I need something cute to distract him!"

The image of their father doting on the AI tiger instead of nagging him brought a satisfied smirk to Lucas's face.

After brief consideration, Evelyn nodded. With her upcoming commitments at Kingsley Tech, she wouldn't have time for Leo anyway. Having her family care for him was the perfect solution.

Lucas practically bounced with excitement, his cheerful demeanor a complete contrast to the intimidating presence he'd shown the reporter moments ago.

"Perfect! You go handle your meeting then—"

To Evelyn's astonishment, Lucas effortlessly accessed her penthouse using biometrics she didn't remember granting him, immediately scooping up the mechanical tiger in a bear hug.

"I definitely didn't authorize his fingerprints," Evelyn muttered, shaking her head.

Kingsley Tech Headquarters

Harrison rushed into Nathan's office with urgent news. The internet was ablaze with a viral video showing Evelyn's fiery confrontation with reporters. Her stunning beauty, razor-sharp wit, and unshakable confidence had captivated the online world.

[QUEEN BEHAVIOR! Evelyn doesn't owe anyone explanations!]
[Vanessa's the one who should be ashamed, not our CEO!]
[That car did the world a favor hitting that manipulative witch!]
[Lucas is absolute husband material! Shame he only got one line...]

Nathan's expression darkened as he scanned the comments. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Who authorized those reporters to ambush her?"

Harrison blinked in confusion. "That's your main concern? Sir, you're currently public enemy number one! If you don't issue a statement soon—"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Harrison swallowed hard before continuing. "Perhaps they were... overzealous? The public can't get enough of you and Evelyn's story."

Nathan's piercing gaze made Harrison instantly regret his choice of words. "Perhaps?"

The video showed Evelyn's initial vulnerability before Lucas arrived, and how her confidence grew with her brother's support. Harrison could practically feel Nathan's rage radiating through the room.

"Ms. Sinclair isn't being disturbed anymore," Harrison quickly assured him. "Everything's under control now."

Nathan's responding glare could have frozen lava.

Within minutes, Harrison's shirt was soaked with sweat. As Nathan's most trusted assistant, he still couldn't comprehend why his boss had become so invested in Evelyn's affairs post-divorce.

During their three-year marriage, Nathan had shown little interest. Why this sudden obsession after their separation?

At Kingsley Tech, the collaborative project was progressing smoothly. The initial phase required daily meetings between all parties to adjust strategies based on real-time developments.

Still shaken from her earlier car accident, Evelyn opted to take the company car rather than drive herself.

As she arrived at Kingsley Tech, a familiar Range Rover caught her eye across the street.

Its owner stood tall and imposing, his chiseled features set in their usual cold expression. The air around him seemed to crackle with restrained energy.

Evelyn pretended not to notice him as she stepped out of her car. Her emerald green halter dress accentuated her graceful figure while projecting an air of quiet authority.

Nathan moved to intercept her, desperate to explain that he hadn't orchestrated the media ambush. He couldn't bear the thought of her misunderstanding his intentions.

But Evelyn walked past without sparing him a glance, her head held high as she entered the building alone.
###Chapter 138

Evelyn Sinclair didn't so much as glance in Nathan Blackwood's direction.

Not only did she refuse to acknowledge him, she walked straight past him into Kingsley Tech's lobby with her designer bag clutched tightly in hand.

Every inch of her - from her stiletto heels to the way she tossed her hair - radiated deliberate indifference toward Nathan.

The security guard immediately sprang to open the glass doors for her.

"Thank you," she murmured politely before striding inside without hesitation.

Nathan's brow furrowed as he watched her. Her blatant disregard made his chest constrict painfully.

She truly doesn't give a damn about me anymore. I can't read her at all. The realization hit him like a physical blow.

As Nathan approached the entrance, a swarm of reporters suddenly materialized from the side of the building.

Dozens of journalists surrounded him, cameras flashing, microphones thrust forward aggressively.

"Mr. Blackwood, is it true you're planning to marry Vanessa Holloway this year?"

"Do you actually have feelings for your mistress?"

"How many women are you currently seeing, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Will the Blackwood family accept a homewrecker as your bride?"

"Why did you purchase trending topics to slander Ms. Sinclair? Don't you owe her an apology?"

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously as he stood frozen in place.

His piercing glare locked onto the most vocal reporter in front.

The man immediately shrank back under the intensity of that stare.

The chaotic scene continued as reporters shouted over each other.

Kingsley Tech's security team quickly intervened, creating a path through the media frenzy.

Nathan didn't move. His voice cut through the noise like ice. "If any of you dare approach me again, I'll ensure you never work in this industry again." His threats were never empty.

An eerie silence fell over the crowd. No one dared breathe too loudly, exchanging nervous glances. Even the reporter who'd accepted Lucas Sterling's bribe kept his mouth shut.

Up on the second-floor balcony, Evelyn leaned casually against the railing, observing the scene below. Nathan's reaction was predictable - always so composed, always so intimidating.

That overwhelming presence was exactly what made him such a formidable CEO.

The man could shake all of New York with a single step.

Evelyn's lips twisted downward.

No matter how much Nathan doted on Vanessa Holloway, the woman would always be branded a homewrecker.

And Evelyn had prepared a special surprise for her.

Nathan's gaze suddenly lifted, locking onto Evelyn's position. Their eyes met across the crowded lobby, an electric current passing between them.

Evelyn's frown transformed into a smirk. She raised one perfectly arched brow in undisguised amusement. Enjoying the show?

Nathan's dark eyes burned into hers. Evelyn straightened, clicking her heels against the marble floor. She silently mouthed three words before turning away.

No one else seemed to notice.

The reporters were finally ejected, restoring calm to the entrance.

Dominic Kingsley emerged from his office to greet them.

Nathan remained rooted in place, still processing what he'd seen.

She'd clearly mouthed: "Karma's a bitch."

Evelyn disappeared into the conference room. Nathan eventually followed.

Once seated across from each other, the project manager began presenting updates.

When the presentation concluded, Dominic Kingsley cleared his throat.

"With the preliminary phase wrapping up, we should discuss the pilot location. Urban setting or suburban? I'd like your thoughts."

"The suburbs," Nathan stated firmly. "AI technology still needs refinement. An accident would be easier to contain outside city limits."

Evelyn cut in sharply. "If the AI is meant for urban implementation, testing in an unfamiliar environment defeats the purpose."

"You seem determined to oppose me at every turn," Nathan observed dryly.

Why else would she consistently challenge his suggestions?

Evelyn gave a derisive laugh, meeting his gaze with icy detachment. "Mr. Blackwood, you can drop the 'seem to be.'"
###Chapter 139 Cheating Scum Deserve Hell

Nathan Blackwood's relentless harm toward Evelyn Sinclair had cemented her hostility against him permanently.

Dominic Kingsley shifted uncomfortably between the two. The tension in the room became suffocating.

Nathan's dark gaze never left Evelyn as he studied her cold expression. Her undisguised contempt revealed the depth of her hatred.

It felt like an invisible hand was crushing his heart.

Dominic cleared his throat. "I believe Ms. Sinclair's proposal has merit..."

Eventually, Nathan had no choice but to accept Evelyn's terms.

As the meeting adjourned, Harrison rushed to Nathan's side. "Sir, Blackwood Enterprises' stocks are crashing..."

Evelyn, being the last to leave, overheard everything.

'Serves them right,' she thought smugly.

"Get to the point," Nathan snapped.

Harrison handed over a tablet displaying blazing red headlines:

"Cheating Scum Nathan Blackwood & Vanessa Holloway Deserve Hell!"

The post used their real names without fear of consequences.

Comments and shares exploded, directly impacting Blackwood's stock value.

[Did Evelyn Sinclair buy this trending topic? Revenge moves fast!]
[Money can't buy love but sure buys justice!]
[Team Evelyn forever! Let's start her fan club!]

Nathan scanned the comments before locking eyes with Evelyn, who was calmly discussing with Dominic.

She met his gaze briefly before dismissing him entirely.

"Nathan." His voice cut through the room.

Evelyn smirked. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic noticed the electric tension between them.

"Did you orchestrate this?" Nathan demanded.

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Guilty as charged."

Her admission hung in the air.

Nathan's expression darkened, but Evelyn continued, "Now you know how public humiliation feels."

Her icy stare could freeze hell itself.

"Control your sister and girlfriend. If they harass me again, I'll make them internet famous."

Evelyn knew Sophia Blackwood had sent those reporters on Vanessa's behalf.

Nathan frowned. "What harassment?"

"Ask them yourself." Evelyn turned to Dominic. "We'll continue this later."

As she left, Dominic sighed. "This isn't just business drama..."

Nathan turned sharply. "Take it down now! What's PR doing?"

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, Horizon Media's backing this. Their CEO Dominic Young is working with Lucas Sterling and foreign outlets. The platform's been hacked repeatedly - we can't trace it."

He added carefully, "Ms. Blackwood did provoke Ms. Sinclair first. An apology might be prudent."

Evelyn had outmaneuvered them completely.

Dominic thought privately, 'Never cross a brilliant woman...'

"Get Sophia here NOW!" Nathan stormed out.
###Chapter 140

Sophia Blackwood was summoned to Kingsley Tech headquarters.

Even her phone had been taken away.

She stood there, shoulders slumped, lifting her gaze hesitantly.

"Brother, why did you call me here so suddenly?"

Nathan Blackwood's expression was glacial.

His voice cut like steel. "You know exactly why."

Sophia shivered but refused to admit anything.

"How would I know?"

"You don't?" Nathan scoffed before barking toward the door. "Bring him in!"

Harrison ushered in the lead journalist from the scandal.

The man entered with a nervous smile, bowing deeply. "Mr. Blackwood. Ms. Blackwood."

Sophia's face twisted in betrayal.

She lunged for Nathan's arm. "Brother, don't listen to him! Everything he says is a lie! I never hired anyone to smear Evelyn!"

The journalist hadn't even spoken yet.

Nathan's eyes darkened, the temperature in the room plummeting.

Sophia recoiled, fear prickling down her spine.

Her grip slackened. "I... I didn't mean for things to go this far."

"Sophia Blackwood, do you still think this is just a harmless mistake?" Nathan's voice was lethally quiet.

An oppressive silence filled the air.

Sophia stumbled back. For the first time, she realized her brother's patience had run out.

Her mother's warning echoed in her mind: Never test Nathan's limits.

Why is Evelyn his line in the sand? Why can't I touch her?

Resentment burned in her chest. She opened her mouth to play the victim—

But the journalist blurted out, "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood still owes the final payment, but since the plan failed, I won't ask for it. Just let me go!"

Sophia whirled on him. "Shut your mouth, you idiot!"

Nathan's voice was arctic. "You have one choice. Apologize to Evelyn. Now."

"Why should I?" Sophia snapped. "It's not like it even worked!"

The online backlash had backfired spectacularly—damaging Kingsley Tech instead of Evelyn.

Nathan's gaze could have frozen hell. "Refuse, and you'll never see another cent from this family."

Sophia paled.

"Nor will anyone lend to you under the Blackwood name. I'll make sure of it."

Her breath hitched. He wasn't bluffing.

Trembling, she choked out, "Why do you protect her? You're divorced! Shouldn't you be with Vanessa Holloway? Who is Evelyn to you?"

Nathan stepped closer, his voice a blade.

"Because of your amateur scheming, Kingsley Tech's stocks crashed. We lost over a billion dollars in hours."

The room turned to ice.

Sophia's lips parted soundlessly.

A billion? I only paid that reporter six figures!

Nathan continued, cold and precise. "And Vanessa Holloway means nothing to me. She will never be part of this family."

Sophia's blood ran cold.

Had she misread everything?

Nathan turned on his heel and left.

The door clicked shut.

Harrison adjusted his glasses, addressing the journalist. "You may leave. But remember—stick to celebrity gossip. Dig into business again, and you'll disappear."

The man fled.

Then Harrison turned to Sophia.

"Ms. Blackwood, your grandfather demands your presence."

Sophia's hope flared. "Grandfather would never—"

"He gave you twenty minutes. Fail to arrive, and your name will be struck from the Blackwood registry. Permanently."

Her knees buckled.
###Chapter 141

Sophia Blackwood never anticipated her impulsive act would wreak such havoc on Blackwood Enterprises while Evelyn Sinclair, her intended target, remained unscathed.

Returning to Highland Estates, Old Master Blackwood berated Sophia relentlessly for hours. Not a single soul dared to intervene. Like Nathan, the patriarch believed Sophia owed Evelyn an apology.

As punishment, Sophia was confined to the estate's memorial hall, forced to kneel throughout the night.

The following day marked Theodore Hart's death anniversary.

Evelyn never expected to encounter Vanessa Holloway and Nathan Blackwood at Theodore's gravesite. Sebastian Hart spotted them too, his expression darkening as he pulled Evelyn back protectively.

"Don't worry about me, Theodore," Vanessa murmured to the headstone, casting a demure glance at Nathan. "Nathan's been taking excellent care of me." Her voice softened further. "I know you're troubled about Evelyn, Nathan. I'll depart for Paris immediately so she won't target you anymore. It's better I withdraw gracefully than cause more complications."

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. Before he could respond, a derisive snort echoed behind them.

The sound dripped with contempt.

Turning, they found Evelyn smirking, her arched brows framing icy eyes. She wore a simple black knee-length dress, yet radiated striking elegance.

"Ms. Holloway, if you're so reluctant to part with Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should stay," Evelyn taunted. Did Vanessa truly believe she could escape so easily? Their reckoning was far from over.

Vanessa's demeanor shifted instantly. "Why are you here?" she demanded, her shock morphing into venomous glare.

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice laced with accusation. "That's our question! What business do you have at my brother's grave?"

Though Nathan had long known Sebastian was Theodore's younger brother, their paths seldom crossed. Sebastian had studied abroad during the years Theodore served with Nathan in the military.

Vanessa paled. If Evelyn discovered her relationship with Nathan stemmed solely from being Theodore's ex-girlfriend—not the passionate affair she'd led everyone to believe—she'd become an even greater laughingstock.

Her panicked gaze darted to Nathan, who'd already formulated a response upon seeing Evelyn.

Addressing Sebastian with measured calm, Nathan explained, "I served with Theodore. Vanessa was his girlfriend. Before he died, he entrusted her care to me." Though speaking to Sebastian, his words were meant for Evelyn.

This was the truth behind his protection of Vanessa—no infidelity, no hidden affections. In all his life, only Evelyn had ever been his wife.

Yet Evelyn's indifferent reaction stunned him. She showed neither interest in their relationship nor reaction to his explanation. Nathan's jaw tightened as he maintained eye contact.

Vanessa squirmed under the awkward silence.

So this was the secret, Evelyn realized. She'd always wondered what mediocre qualities made Vanessa special enough to captivate Nathan. Among his admirers, Vanessa's pedigree, education, and looks ranked lowest. Beyond her vile nature, she offered nothing remarkable.

How absurd that Evelyn had lost to such a woman.

The tense quiet stretched until Sebastian's incredulous outburst shattered it. "My brother would never fancy someone like her! She's just a gold-digging opportunist, isn't she?"
###Chapter 142

Vanessa Holloway's face drained of color when she heard Sebastian Hart's accusation.

Her fingers curled into tight fists as she met Evelyn Sinclair's mocking gaze. Without uttering a word, Vanessa turned and fled the scene.

Evelyn paused for a dramatic beat before leisurely following her prey.

Nathan Blackwood frowned and moved to intervene, but Sebastian blocked his path, demanding clarification about Nathan's earlier statement.

Vanessa had just reached her cherry-red BMW when she heard approaching footsteps. She whirled around to see Evelyn standing there with an infuriatingly calm expression.

"What do you want?" Vanessa spat. "Come to gloat? Even if Nathan hurt you for my sake, it proves he doesn't care about you at all. Stop embarrassing yourself."

She still believed herself superior to Evelyn in every way.

Slamming the car door, Vanessa started the engine with a roar and pulled away from the curb.

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial as she slid into her own vehicle. The tires screeched as she accelerated after Vanessa's disappearing car.

The wide boulevard stretched empty before them.

A dangerous glint appeared in Evelyn's eyes as she pulled alongside Vanessa's car. With precise timing, she jerked the steering wheel sharply to the right.

CRASH!

The sickening sound of metal grinding against metal filled the air.

Vanessa's BMW spun violently, the left front fender crumpling like paper. The car came to a shuddering halt as Vanessa stared through the cracked windshield in shock.

Evelyn wasn't finished.

With practiced ease, she executed a perfect 180-degree turn, tires smoking as she drifted to face Vanessa's damaged vehicle head-on.

Through the haze of dust, Evelyn saw Vanessa fumbling for her phone with shaking hands.

Evelyn smirked. "Whoever you're calling won't get here in time."

She floored the accelerator again, ramming directly into Vanessa's car with bone-jarring force.

The collision sent Vanessa's BMW skidding sideways, the frame twisting grotesquely as the acrid smell of gasoline filled the air.

Finally satisfied, Evelyn reversed, parked neatly, and stepped out to lean casually against her hood. She crossed her arms, studying her handiwork with cold detachment.

Vanessa crawled from the wreckage, blood streaking her designer clothes, her entire body trembling with shock and pain.

"How does it feel?" Evelyn asked, her voice dripping with icy amusement.

Vanessa's earlier arrogance had completely evaporated. "Evelyn... if you want Nathan, just take him..." she stammered.

Evelyn pushed off from her car and sauntered forward, her designer heels clicking ominously against the pavement. She looked down at the cowering woman with undisguised contempt.

"Him? Please. A man like that isn't even worth my time anymore." Her laugh was sharp as broken glass. "No, Vanessa. I came for you."

Evelyn crouched down until they were eye to eye. "Don't even think about fleeing the country. I have an excellent memory for grudges, and we still have unfinished business." Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Like when you tried to kill me by sabotaging my brakes."

Vanessa's face turned ashen. She clawed at the pavement in panic, her manicured nails snapping and bleeding. "I don't know what you're talking about! You're insane!"

Evelyn's stunning galaxy-like eyes showed no emotion as she studied Vanessa's pathetic state. That near-death experience had haunted her nightmares for months. She'd nearly lost everything - her family, her future.

Evelyn Sinclair didn't believe in forgiveness. Only consequences.

"Evelyn." A familiar cold voice cut through the tension. "What the hell are you doing?"
###Chapter 143

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched in his throat.

His hands trembled slightly as he took in the devastating scene before him.

The elegant Evelyn Sinclair he knew would never be capable of such destruction.

Who did this to her? His mind screamed.

Deep down, he already knew the answer, but refused to accept that his refined ex-wife could harbor such fury.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you blind? Or just choosing not to see the truth?"

Evelyn didn't bother explaining. She turned sharply on her heel, ready to leave.

She had nothing left to say to this man.

Nathan moved swiftly, blocking her path with his imposing frame. His stormy gaze bore into hers.

"I already told you there's nothing between Vanessa Holloway and me."

He assumed Evelyn's rage stemmed from jealousy over his connection with Vanessa.

The thought inexplicably pleased him, despite the violent display.

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile.

Her eyes glittered with icy amusement as she regarded him with detached indifference.

"You actually think I did this because of you?"

Nathan's brow furrowed, his intense stare never wavering.

"Then why?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, giving him a scathing once-over.

"Mr. Blackwood, your ego knows no bounds. I suggest you see a specialist about that narcissism."

Nathan's expression darkened with confusion.

Without another word, Evelyn yanked open her car door and slid inside.

The engine roared to life. She rolled down the window just enough to toss a thick folder at Nathan's feet.

Then she was gone, tires screeching against pavement.

What a perfect match - the narcissist and the two-faced witch, she thought bitterly.

Nathan knelt stiffly to retrieve the documents. The moment he opened the file, his entire body went rigid.

The air around him turned arctic.

Photographic evidence showed Vanessa conspiring with a lanky man near Evelyn's vehicle.

That night. That car. That accident.

The memories flashed behind Nathan's eyelids with painful clarity.

No further explanation was needed.

The file contained irrefutable proof of Vanessa Holloway's attempted murder.

So Evelyn's violent retaliation wasn't about jealousy - it was justice. Vanessa got exactly what she deserved, Nathan realized.

A lead weight settled in his chest, making it hard to breathe.

This wasn't about him at all. Evelyn had nearly died that night.

If he hadn't intervened...

A weak tug at his pant leg interrupted his thoughts. "It... wasn't me... help..."

Vanessa lay broken on the pavement, her pathetic whimpers barely coherent.

For the first time, genuine terror shone in her eyes.

She never expected Evelyn to uncover the truth so quickly.

Nor did she anticipate such brutal retaliation.

Nathan's glacial stare dropped to the whimpering woman. Still playing the victim?

How had he been so thoroughly deceived?

Evelyn's words echoed in his mind - Vanessa was a cat with nine lives who never seemed to die.

The realization struck him like a physical blow.

From their marriage onward, Vanessa had deliberately drained Evelyn's blood during medical procedures.

The car accident was just another calculated move.

Vanessa Holloway was a viper in silk, and he'd been her unwitting accomplice.

Sebastian Hart descended the hillside with deliberate slowness.

"Quite the show, Mr. Blackwood," he drawled. "Though I must say, even if my brother were alive, he'd never stoop to marry such trash. She's all yours - just do us all a favor and keep her locked away."

Sebastian's mocking laughter hung in the air as he walked away.

Nathan's grip on the evidence file turned his knuckles white. He stepped back, avoiding Vanessa's grasping fingers.

Disgust twisted his features.

"Nathan... please..." Vanessa sobbed.

"Get out of my sight." The words came out like shards of ice. His eyes promised retribution.
###Chapter 144

The deserted boulevard stretched endlessly before her.

Nathan Blackwood didn't so much as glance at Vanessa Holloway lying crumpled on the pavement. He simply slid into his sleek black car and disappeared down the street.

Vanessa was left discarded like yesterday's garbage, her injuries ignored by every passing stranger.

With trembling hands, she pulled herself up and dialed her uncle. The moment he answered, his furious voice exploded through the phone.

"You wretched fool! What did you do to enrage Mr. Blackwood? He's threatening to destroy my entire company! Explain yourself!"

Vanessa's breath caught in her throat when sudden car horns interrupted her panic.

Was Nathan sending someone back for her? Had he reconsidered?

Her fleeting hope shattered as police vehicles screeched to a halt before her.

"Vanessa Holloway?" An officer stepped forward, his expression stern. "You're under arrest for attempted murder."

Ice flooded her veins.

The brief flicker of optimism vanished as reality crashed down. The police - not Nathan - had come for her.

Cold metal cuffs snapped around her wrists before she was shoved into the squad car. The wailing sirens echoed her internal scream of despair.

At Sterling Corporation...

Evelyn Sinclair reviewed the final details of Kingsley Tech's project. With Donovan Sterling overseeing the technical aspects, her mind could focus on more pressing matters.

The weight of her new CEO position showed in the stack of bid proposals demanding her attention.

"President Sinclair?" Bennett approached as she exited the conference room. "Sebastian Hart called twice. It sounded urgent."

Evelyn accepted her phone with a nod. Sebastian answered on the first ring.

"Evelyn! Have you seen the news? Vanessa Holloway's been arrested!"

Evelyn's perfectly arched brows lifted. "I've been in meetings all morning. What happened?"

"Nathan Blackwood personally handed your evidence to the police! Vanessa confessed everything overnight!"

A sardonic smile curved Evelyn's lips. "How... unexpected. I assumed his affection for her ran deeper."

Sebastian's laugh held no warmth. "That snake charmed my father Theodore in three days flat. She manipulated everyone into believing he loved her. When I told Nathan the truth, you should've seen his face!"

Evelyn's chest tightened unexpectedly. Three days of deception versus three years of torment - the irony wasn't lost on her.

But vengeance wasn't her concern now. Vanessa would face justice for her own choices.

"How did this become public knowledge?" Evelyn wondered aloud.

"Horizon Media broke the story. Lucas is apparently enjoying the show."

Evelyn ended the call and opened her news feed. The top trending headline blared: "Blackwood's Mistress Exposed as Murderer!"

Every damning detail had been leaked - photographs, confessions, the entire sordid timeline laid bare for public consumption.
###Chapter 145

The comment section beneath the viral article exploded with outrage.

"This mistress is a complete psychopath!"

"That homewrecker tried to murder his ex-wife? What kind of monster is she? Who does she think she is?"

"Mr. Blackwood must be blind! This cheap mistress isn't fit to lick Evelyn's boots! His taste in women is truly appalling."

"Blackwood Enterprises' stock took quite a hit, didn't it?"

The next trending topic featured Lucas Sterling enjoying the drama unfold online.

Using his verified account, Lucas reposted Horizon Media's explosive report.

His caption read: "Karma's a bitch! @EvelynSinclair I know you're too classy for this, but let me fan the flames for you!"

"OMG is this Lucas publicly declaring his love for Evelyn?" "Let's all add fuel to the fire! Team Evelyn!"

"Everyone knows Lucas has a crush on Evelyn, but this feels so extra. Hilarious though!"

"Credit to Lucas for having good taste, but our CEO Evelyn should remain the ultimate independent queen!"

Lucas's public stance was clearly an act of protection and undisguised favoritism toward Evelyn.

This was unprecedented in celebrity culture.

Had Lucas been just another actor, his comments wouldn't have caused such a stir.

But Lucas Sterling was Hollywood royalty.

His every word carried weight.

The moment he spoke, his millions of followers rallied behind Evelyn.

Naturally, Vanessa and Nathan faced even harsher backlash.

Evelyn smirked, thinking they deserved every bit of it.

Blackwood Enterprises' stock dip, while significant, barely made a dent in the family's fortune.

Evelyn had long stopped caring about them.

Three hours later, Blackwood Enterprises issued a statement.

"Mr. Nathan Blackwood and Ms. Vanessa Holloway maintain a strictly professional relationship. Our company will pursue all legal avenues to protect Mr. Blackwood's reputation."

They attached a cease-and-desist letter.

Their efforts to control the narrative failed spectacularly.

Their PR team was embarrassingly incompetent.

When news broke about Evelyn's near-death experience, the Sterling family erupted.

William Sterling pulled strings to ensure Vanessa would serve her full sentence without parole.

Alexander Sterling ordered Evelyn to take medical leave, insisting the company could manage without her.

Donovan Sterling, relieved his sister was alive, remained characteristically quiet.

Lucas Sterling unleashed a torrent of profanity across social media.

As evening fell, Bennett knocked on Evelyn's office door.

"President Sinclair, Ms. Blackwood is here to see you."

Evelyn paused. "Sophia Blackwood?" Bennett nodded.

"What does she want now? Didn't she learn her lesson last time?" Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile.

She leaned back in her leather chair, arching one perfect eyebrow. "Send her in."

"Yes, ma'am."

Moments later, Sophia strutted in on stiletto heels.

Her haggard appearance suggested she hadn't been sleeping well.

Given Old Master Blackwood's temperament, family loyalty meant nothing when business interests were at stake.

Sophia still hadn't learned this crucial lesson.

"Evelyn, you really think you're untouchable now, don't you?"

Sophia's envious gaze swept across the luxurious office.

Evelyn's expression remained icy. "My time is valuable, Ms. Blackwood. State your business."

She had no patience for petty games with lesser women.

Sophia's face twisted in displeasure. Who did Evelyn think she was?

But remembering her grandfather's threats, Sophia swallowed her pride.

She lifted her chin in that trademark Blackwood arrogance. "I came to apologize."

As if Evelyn should feel honored. When had a Blackwood ever apologized to anyone?

If not for Evelyn's counterattack damaging their company, Old Master Blackwood would never have forced this humiliation.

Evelyn studied Sophia and burst into laughter.

Sophia looked ready for war, not reconciliation. Did she think Evelyn was stupid?

"What's so funny? Stop gloating! I wouldn't be here if Grandpa hadn't ordered—"

Evelyn's smile vanished. "Nobody forced you. If you're unhappy, the door's right there."
###Chapter 146

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. Did Sophia truly believe she could be fooled so easily? As if a half-hearted apology from her would mean anything?

She wouldn’t care even if Sophia groveled at her feet.

Sophia froze, her expression twisting in shock.

For a moment, she faltered, her confidence shattering under Evelyn’s icy gaze.

It hit her then—Evelyn wasn’t the same woman she had once bullied.

She was now the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation, a woman who could bring even Blackwood Enterprises to its knees.

"Evelyn, what kind of attitude is this?" Sophia gritted her teeth, forcing out the words. "I came here to apologize, and this is how you treat me?"

Evelyn glanced at her watch, then pressed the intercom. "Bennett, send security up. Escort Ms. Blackwood out."

Sophia’s eyes widened in disbelief.

"And from now on," Evelyn added coolly, "she is not permitted to enter Sterling Tower again."

"Evelyn! How dare you?!" Sophia’s face flushed with rage. If word got out that she had been publicly thrown out, her reputation would be ruined. Grandfather and Nathan would never believe she hadn’t provoked Evelyn first.

Evelyn’s gaze was glacial.

"Why wouldn’t I? Sophia Blackwood, you should learn what a real apology looks like."

The security team arrived swiftly. Bennett stepped in, his expression stern. "Ms. Blackwood, this way."

Fury burned in Sophia’s chest. She shot Evelyn one last venomous glare before storming out.

The moment she stepped outside Sterling Tower, regret clawed at her. How was she going to explain this to Grandfather and Nathan? She should have just swallowed her pride.

Her anxiety only grew as she returned to Blackwood Manor.

The second she entered, a teacup flew toward her. Sophia barely dodged it, the porcelain shattering at her feet.

"Grandfather—"

"You useless girl!" Old Master Blackwood’s voice was thunderous. "How dare you come back after humiliating yourself like that?"

Sophia opened her mouth to lie, but—

"Evelyn Sinclair called me," he snapped. "She told me you were arrogant and disrespectful the moment you stepped into her office. Are you truly this stupid?"

Sophia’s face paled.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn to strike first, poisoning Grandfather against her before she could even speak.

Now, nothing she said would matter.

Of course, Evelyn had outmaneuvered her again.

Her punishment? Another night kneeling in the ancestral hall.

After work, Isabella practically dragged Evelyn to an exclusive party.

Though exhausted, Evelyn hadn’t indulged in a night out in ages, so she reluctantly agreed.

She wore an emerald-green halter gown, the fabric woven with delicate pearls that shimmered under the light. The dress clung to her curves, accentuating her graceful neck and regal posture.

She looked every bit the untouchable goddess.

The moment the two women entered, heads turned.

Isabella leaned in, mischief in her voice. "See anyone you like? Just take him home."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You’re the one who looks interested."

Isabella grinned. "Well, it’s about participation, isn’t it?" She winked. "I’ll go greet the host. Find a seat."

Evelyn nodded and settled into a quiet corner.

She pulled out her phone to check stock updates when a man dripping in designer labels swaggered toward her. His gaze was predatory, his outfit screaming "trust fund brat."

One glance told Evelyn everything—arrogant, entitled, and utterly useless.

"Ms. Sterling," he drawled, flashing a smarmy smile. "I’ve heard so much about you. You’re even more stunning in person."

Evelyn barely spared him a glance, offering only a curt nod.

She didn’t know him. She didn’t care to.

And his attempt at flattery was painfully unoriginal.

His smile faltered at her indifference. He had come here hoping to impress Nathan Blackwood, who was upstairs with his friends, brooding over Sterling Corporation’s recent victories.

Seeing Nathan’s dark mood, this fool thought he could win favor by putting Evelyn in her place.

Maybe if he succeeded, Nathan would even consider a business deal with his family.

The thought emboldened him.

He leered at Evelyn. "Let me buy you a drink, Ms. Sterling."

He held out a glass of champagne.

Evelyn didn’t even look at it.

"I don’t drink," she said flatly.

Her refusal was absolute. She wouldn’t accept anything from a man like him.

His face darkened. He forced a laugh. "A powerful woman like you, refusing a drink? Are you looking down on me?"

Evelyn finally met his eyes, her gaze sharp enough to cut glass.

"Yes."
###Chapter 147: A Lesson in Humility

The entitled brat smirked, his voice dripping with condescension as he insinuated that Evelyn Sinclair's strong demeanor was nothing but an act.

Beneath that powerful CEO facade, she was just a fragile woman.

What did a divorced heiress have to be proud of, anyway?

Evelyn's expression remained icy. A mocking smile curled at the corner of her lips.

Her voice was sharp enough to cut glass. "Yes, I am looking down on you."

Under the chandelier's glow, Evelyn radiated effortless elegance.

She didn’t need words—just one dismissive glance shattered his fragile ego.

Who does this pathetic man think he is? He’s not even worth my breath.

Done with the conversation, Evelyn rose, intending to find Isabella.

The scene had already drawn curious gazes from the surrounding crowd.

Humiliated by her indifference, the spoiled heir's face burned with rage. He lunged forward, grabbing her wrist.

"Evelyn, you think you’re so untouchable? You’re just a woman Nathan Blackwood tossed aside! What makes you think you’re worth anything now? You should be grateful anyone even looks your way. Name your price—how much for a drink?"

Before he could finish, red wine splashed across his face.

Evelyn moved so fast he barely registered the empty glass in her hand.

Dark liquid dripped from his hair, staining his designer shirt.

She rubbed her wrist, her glare glacial.

"It’s the twenty-first century. Since your mouth is so filthy, consider that a free rinse. And you?" She scoffed, eyeing his flashy outfit. "You couldn’t afford me."

While he sputtered, Evelyn stood tall—regal, untouchable.

The contrast was stark: a furious, spoiled brat versus a queen who wouldn’t spare him a second glance.

His pride shattered. The whispers around them fueled his fury.

No one had ever dared humiliate him like this.

How dare this discarded woman act so superior?

"I’ll teach you your place, you—"

His hand swung toward her face.

But before it connected, a tall figure intercepted, yanking Evelyn back.

A brutal kick sent the man crashing to the floor, writhing in pain.

The hand gripping Evelyn’s wrist was elegant, long-fingered—artistic, even.

A familiar scent, laced with whiskey, enveloped her.

Once, that scent had made her heart race. Now, it made her recoil.

Nathan Blackwood.

He loomed over her, his presence suffocating. The moment Evelyn recognized him, she jerked free, putting distance between them.

His brows furrowed briefly—something flickered in his eyes—but it vanished just as quickly.

Tristan Whitmore rushed over, gaping at the scene.

"Anson, have you lost your damn mind?"

Anson’s family was small-time in San Francisco.

Did he really just try to lay hands on Evelyn Sinclair?
###Chapter 148

The crowd gasped in shock.

Rumors had been swirling for months about the bitter feud between Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair.

So why did this ex-husband suddenly leap to her defense when danger struck?

Isabella Montgomery came rushing through the crowd, her face pale with worry. She grabbed Evelyn's arms. "Are you hurt?"

Evelyn merely shook her head, her expression calm as still water.

She had been ready for this.

With her martial arts training, that spoiled rich boy wouldn't have stood a chance against her.

Nathan's intervention had been... unexpected.

The trust fund brat groaned on the ground, clutching his stomach. Though in agony, he forced himself to sit up.

Still dazed, he hadn't realized who had kicked him.

"Who the hell dares interfere with me?" he spat through gritted teeth. "Defending Evelyn Sinclair? You must have a death wish!"

Tristan Whitmore burst out laughing.

"Open your damn eyes, Anson! Unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a hospital bed?"

Normally, Anson would cower before Tristan and Nathan. But pain had made him reckless.

Then he heard Tristan's voice clearly.

His blood ran cold.

Scrambling to his knees, he looked up into Nathan's icy gaze.

Nathan stared down at him like he was something unpleasant stuck to his shoe.

"M-Mr. Blackwood!" Anson stammered. "What are you doing here?"

This made no sense! Everyone knew Nathan despised Evelyn. Why would he protect her?

Anson's mind raced as he tried to save face.

"It's all a misunderstanding, sir! I was just teaching this woman a lesson. She's been spreading vile rumors about you online! As your loyal friend, I couldn't stand by and—"

Nathan's foot connected with Anson's chest again, cutting off his pathetic excuses.

Tristan quickly moved to Evelyn's side, putting distance between Nathan and this mess.

"We don't know this idiot," Tristan said hurriedly. "Nathan has nothing to do with him. Please don't misunderstand, Evelyn."

Tristan knew better than anyone how complicated Nathan's feelings for Evelyn had become.

Ever since Nathan turned Vanessa Holloway over to the police, Tristan had seen the truth.

Nathan was hopelessly in love with his ex-wife.

Even if Nathan himself hadn't realized it yet.

So Tristan would be damned if he let some third-rate social climber ruin things.

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile.

"Save your explanations. This isn't the first time Mr. Blackwood's so-called friends have come after me." Her cold eyes flicked to Tristan. "You were one of them, weren't you?"

Tristan winced. He had no defense.

During Nathan and Evelyn's forced marriage, Tristan had made Evelyn's life miserable.

He was no better than Anson.

Evelyn's words cut deep.

Tristan glanced nervously at Nathan, who stood rigid, fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

Nathan was furious.

Anson writhed on the ground, his face gray with pain.

"Mr. Blackwood, I only wanted to protect your reputation! Had I known you still cared for this woman, I never would have—"

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Tristan roared. "Since when do you speak for Nathan? Do you want to be banned from every club in San Francisco?"
###Chapter 149

Evelyn Sinclair smirked from the sidelines, thinking what an absolutely spectacular show this had turned out to be.

Though truth be told, she'd had enough of this ridiculous performance.

Every additional second spent watching these fools was a complete waste of her precious time.

She turned to Isabella with a dismissive wave. "Let's get out of here. Being around these insufferable idiots is ruining my evening."

The only person she wanted to avoid more than anyone else was Nathan Blackwood.

Isabella immediately understood Evelyn's unspoken thoughts. She'd been regretting bringing Evelyn here in the first place, so she nodded eagerly in agreement.

Evelyn grabbed her designer clutch, pivoted sharply on her stilettos, and strode confidently toward the exit without a backward glance.

She couldn't care less about the dozens of curious eyes following her dramatic departure.

Let them keep watching Nathan's pathetic little show, she thought bitterly.

While Isabella went to retrieve the car, Evelyn waited by the entrance, absently studying her manicure as the cool night breeze brushed against her skin.

Then came the unmistakable sound of heavy footsteps approaching - ones she'd recognize anywhere - but she refused to turn around.

"Evelyn." That deep, velvety voice she knew all too well. "Vanessa Holloway has been dealt with. I was wondering if... perhaps we could start over?"

Nathan moved to stand beside her, his gaze complicated as he studied her profile.

This marked the first time in Nathan Blackwood's life he'd ever initiated friendship with a woman - a fact that would shock high society if it ever got out.

Guilt and remorse weighed heavily on him, and he desperately wanted Evelyn to give him just one chance to make things right.

With Vanessa out of the picture and their misunderstandings cleared, Nathan felt even more ashamed of how he'd treated Evelyn now that he saw Vanessa's true colors.

Evelyn finally lifted her eyes to give him a sideways glance, one perfectly sculpted eyebrow arching in derision. "I have exceptionally high standards when it comes to friendships, Mr. Blackwood. You don't even come close to meeting them, so let's not waste each other's time."

Nathan's entire body went rigid.

The rejection in her words couldn't have been clearer.

Friendship? Evelyn wouldn't even acknowledge him if they passed on the street.

"Don't tell me you actually believe my hatred for you stems solely from Vanessa Holloway?" Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "That without her in the picture, I'd suddenly forgive and forget everything?"

Nathan's expression hardened, his face growing increasingly stormy as he struggled to contain the uncomfortable tightness in his chest.

"What exactly do you mean by that?" His voice came out icy and strained.

Wasn't that the case? He'd already explained he had nothing to do with Vanessa. Why was he still worthless in Evelyn's eyes? Was there truly no chance for reconciliation between them?

Evelyn's eyebrow arched higher, her smile turning positively glacial.

How utterly ironic.

"To be perfectly honest, I find you utterly repulsive. While we were married, you didn't hesitate to sacrifice your own wife's happiness for some other woman's benefit. How does someone even do that? Was it just to prove your moral superiority?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "Don't insult me by talking about friendship. Why should I care? I was the one who donated blood. I was the one slandered and humiliated. I was the one who wasted three years of my life! Why should I bear the consequences of your actions? Doesn't that disgust you? This was never about Vanessa Holloway - it's always been about you, Nathan Blackwood!"

By the time she finished speaking, all traces of amusement had vanished from Evelyn's face, replaced by an arctic chill in her piercing gaze.

Nathan Blackwood had single-handedly destroyed every ounce of affection she'd ever felt for him.

Did he really expect her to feel grateful and come running back just because he claimed innocence regarding Vanessa? In his dreams!

Without so much as another glance in his direction, Evelyn turned and walked away, her heels clicking decisively against the pavement.

Nathan stood frozen in place, the bone-deep coldness radiating from Evelyn seeping into his very soul.

Am I truly so unworthy to even speak to her? The thought cut deeper than he cared to admit.

For the first time, Nathan realized Evelyn had completely slipped from his control - perhaps even beyond his reach entirely.

This unsettling realization sent an unexpected pang of panic through him.

Isabella's luxury sedan idled nearby, waiting for Evelyn.

As she slid into the passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt with mechanical precision, her face remained an impassive mask.

Isabella spotted Nathan still standing there and snorted derisively. "What does he want now?"

Evelyn's lips twisted wryly. "He wants to be friends."

A harsh laugh escaped Isabella. "Is he delusional? After everything?"

"Obviously." Evelyn's tone dripped with sarcasm as she watched Nathan's retreating figure grow smaller in the side mirror, suddenly feeling the entire encounter had been utterly pointless.

The moment Evelyn arrived home, she immediately called Bennett.

Her voice held an uncharacteristic edge as she issued her command: "There's some spoiled trust fund brat named Anson. I don't care what his family business is, but I want to wake up tomorrow to news of their complete financial ruin and disappearance from high society."

Bennett had no idea what had transpired earlier that evening, but this marked the first time Evelyn had ever used Sterling Corporation's influence to deliberately destroy another company.

"Understood, President Sinclair."

Bennett sighed internally. Looks like another all-nighter for me...
###Chapter 150

The sun had barely risen over San Francisco when Nathan Blackwood stepped out of the conference room at Blackwood Corporation.

His sharp mind, still processing the morning's discussions, suddenly snapped to a different thought. He turned to his assistant, Harrison.

"Terminate all contracts with Anson & Co. Buy them out at the lowest possible price, then make sure he leaves the city."

Harrison hesitated, confusion flickering across his face. "Sir, Anson's company collapsed overnight. They're drowning in debt and fled the country. Their assets have already been seized."

Nathan's jaw tightened, his expression turning icy.

It didn’t take him long to realize—Evelyn Sinclair had struck again.

She moves fast. The memory of her words from last night sent an uneasy ripple through him.

Suppressing the strange sensation, he merely gave a curt nod.

Meanwhile, Tristan Whitmore nearly choked on his breakfast when he heard about Anson’s downfall.

His appetite vanished instantly.

Compared to Anson, Tristan realized Evelyn had been merciful with him.

If she ever decided to settle old scores, not even Nathan could shield him.

Panic set in. He grabbed his coat and rushed straight to Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn barely spared a glance when Bennett informed her of Tristan’s arrival.

"Let him wait. Proceed with the scheduled meetings."

Bennett nodded. "Yes, ma'am."

Two back-to-back meetings later, Evelyn inspected a project site and grabbed a quick lunch in the employee cafeteria.

Her schedule was relentless.

Only as evening approached did she finally exhale.

Then she remembered.

"Is he still here?"

Bennett didn’t need clarification. "Mr. Whitmore is in the guest lounge. He’s had four coffees and ordered takeout."

Evelyn smirked. "Impressive patience."

"Send him in."

Moments later, Tristan entered, clutching a bouquet of wilted flowers.

Evelyn arched a brow.

Tristan flashed his most charming smile. "Evelyn! You’re done already?"

He’d expected to wait until midnight.

Crossing her arms, she tilted her head. "Apologies for the delay, Mr. Whitmore."

Her tone held no remorse.

Tristan laughed nervously. "No, no—my time is worthless."

I’ll endure anything if it means she doesn’t destroy me next.

Evelyn sipped her coffee, the rich aroma filling the room.

Tristan nearly gagged—he’d already had enough caffeine to last a week.

Breathe through it.

Straightening, he chose his words carefully.

"After yesterday… I realized how poorly I treated you back then. As Nathan’s friend, I should’ve known better."

He exhaled. "I came to apologize properly."

Evelyn studied him, unimpressed.

"Or did Anson’s fate scare you into this?"

Damn, she sees right through me.

His smile faltered before he forced it back. "Vanessa Holloway played us all! Last night, we were drinking with Nathan, reminiscing… and we regret everything. We were blind. Can we start over?"

The once-arrogant heir now stood before her, practically groveling.

Evelyn’s lips curved.

How the mighty have fallen.
###Chapter 151 A Death Wish?

Evelyn's eyes flashed with amusement before she shook her head with a smirk.

Not in this lifetime! Turn the page? Keep dreaming! These people get more ridiculous by the day.

Tristan's hopeful smile faltered. His entire visit had been nothing but a fool's errand.

He left the office dejected while Evelyn's icy voice followed him out. "Mr. Whitmore, you should be grateful I'm not actively pursuing grievances against your people."

"Next time, spare yourself the humiliation."

Tristan froze mid-step.

A sudden realization struck him. He turned back with renewed hope shining in his eyes. "Evelyn, do you still have feelings for Nathan?" If she did, their chances now were infinitely better than three years ago! They were equals now - a perfect match!

Evelyn's expression turned glacial. "Do you have a death wish?" The threat couldn't be clearer.

Tristan instinctively recoiled, forcing an awkward laugh before practically sprinting from the room. That answered that.

How could she possibly still care for Nathan? She wasn't some masochist.

Once safely outside Sterling Tower, Tristan immediately called Nathan. "Blackwood, I never realized how perfectly matched you and Evelyn are. Your temperaments, your presence, your family backgrounds - it's uncanny! Honestly, who else could possibly stand beside you as an equal?"

Nathan's voice held cautious interest. "Oh?"

Though he'd never admit it, the comparison secretly pleased him.

Tristan sighed dramatically. "Too bad you've completely blown your chance!" The line went dead immediately, followed by Nathan's muttered curse: "That idiot."

Meanwhile, Evelyn received an invitation from Lucas to attend an exclusive auction that evening.

Concerned about public speculation regarding their relationship, Lucas had invited Natalie Beaumont as his date.

For Evelyn, he'd carefully selected rising star Julian Moreau as her escort.

The young actor cut a striking figure in his tailored white suit, his boyish charm evident in the faint blush that colored his cheeks when introduced to Evelyn.

Evelyn simply offered a polite smile before taking his arm and guiding him into the opulent venue.

The massive display screen showcased tonight's offerings: rare jade artifacts, masterwork paintings, and the pièce de résistance - a pair of black opal cufflinks, the final creation of legendary designer Laurent Dubois.

Julian's breath caught when the cufflinks appeared. "Laurent's last piece is here?" he whispered reverently.

"You admire them?" Evelyn asked.

Julian nodded enthusiastically. "Before acting, I studied design. Laurent was my idol. I'd give up my career in a heartbeat if he'd take me as his apprentice."

The mention of cufflinks triggered an unwelcome memory - Nathan Blackwood's well-known obsession with collecting them, particularly Dubois' creations.

Damn it! Why does everything remind me of him? Evelyn scanned the room irritably - only to find Nathan seated mere rows away, enduring the chatter of an overly familiar brunette.

Sensing her gaze, Nathan turned - his eyes locking onto Evelyn's intimate conversation with Julian.

The way her delicate features softened when she smiled, the adorable dimples that appeared... She looked radiant when not directing her fury at him.

They seemed entirely too close for comfort.

A dark scowl settled over Nathan's features.

The woman beside him followed his glare and deliberately raised her voice. "Oh! Looks like Ms. Sterling has a new beau. She certainly has excellent taste - Julian Moreau is this season's breakout star! The Sterling heiress certainly attracts handsome men."

Nathan cut her off with a glare. "This isn't your seat."

Cassandra Delacroix stiffened before recovering with a practiced smile. "My father organized this auction. People are happy to accommodate me." Her implication was clear - she sat wherever she pleased.
###Chapter 152 Only You Are Worthy

Cassandra Delacroix had just returned to Montecito and decided to attend the auction for some entertainment.

She never expected to see Nathan Blackwood here. The moment she spotted him, everything else faded into the background—she had to get closer.

Three years ago, Evelyn Sinclair had stolen her chance with Nathan. Now, Cassandra refused to back down.

Nathan remained silent.

His expression was icy, the disdain in his gaze unmistakable. If Harrison, seated beside him, failed to recognize his boss’s displeasure, then all those years as Nathan’s right-hand man would have been wasted.

Harrison quickly suggested, "President Blackwood, perhaps we should switch seats?"

Nathan stood without a word, and Harrison swiftly moved aside, taking his original spot.

Cassandra’s furious glare burned into Harrison, but he pretended not to notice.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Natalie Beaumont.

[Is that Cassandra Delacroix from Celestial Media sitting next to Nathan?]

Evelyn frowned slightly at the name before replying.

[Couldn’t tell.]

It took her a moment to recall who Cassandra was—the infamous socialite who had once declared she would marry no one but Nathan Blackwood.

Her father, Vincent Delacroix, was a powerhouse in the entertainment industry, and Cassandra had always gotten whatever she wanted.

After Nathan rejected her, she had been devastated and fled to Korea for cosmetic surgery. But while she was away, Nathan married Evelyn.

Now, freshly returned from her transformation, Cassandra sat just a few seats from Nathan, her bright eyes fixed on him.

Evelyn’s cold gaze flickered toward them.

Nathan turned his head, catching sight of Evelyn speaking softly with Julian Moreau.

Her profile was delicate, her smile revealing charming dimples. She looks radiant when she’s not angry.

But the sight of her so close to Julian sent a sharp irritation through him. His expression darkened.

The woman beside him—Cassandra—noticed his shift and followed his gaze.

"Oh!" she exclaimed dramatically. "Looks like Ms. Sinclair has a new admirer. Julian Moreau, isn’t it? His debut drama was a massive hit. She certainly knows how to pick them."

Nathan’s voice was icy. "This isn’t your seat."

Cassandra stiffened, then forced a smile. "My father organized this auction. People are happy to accommodate me."

She meant she could sit wherever she pleased.

But Nathan wasn’t interested.

The auction began, and Evelyn found herself fixated on a single item—a pair of cufflinks.

When bidding started at $200,000, Julian raised his paddle without hesitation.

"$250,000!"

The price climbed rapidly to $600,000. Julian hesitated—this was a steep sum for a rising actor.

Evelyn decided to step in. Since he had accompanied her, she would show her appreciation.

"$700,000," she called.

The previous bidder, recognizing her, backed down.

But then Cassandra raised her paddle.

"$750,000!" She turned to Nathan, beaming. "Nathan, let me gift these to you!"

Nathan gave no reaction.

Evelyn’s lips curved. Does she really think she can outbid me?

"One million," Evelyn declared.

Gasps filled the room. These were now the most expensive cufflinks in auction history.

Cassandra’s face fell—she didn’t have that kind of spending money. Her resentment toward Evelyn flared.

Just as the auctioneer prepared to finalize Evelyn’s bid, a deep voice cut through the room.

"$1.1 million."

Nathan.

The cufflinks weren’t worth that much, but they were the last missing piece in his Laurent Dubois collection. He needed them.

The crowd buzzed—ex-wife versus ex-husband. Who would win?

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "$1.2 million."

Julian leaned in. "Ms. Sinclair, they’re not worth that much."

She smiled but didn’t respond.

Nathan countered immediately. "$1.5 million."

His gaze flicked toward Evelyn, but she wasn’t looking at him—her focus was entirely on the cufflinks, an almost obsessive desire in her eyes.

Without pause, she raised her paddle again.

"Two million."

The auctioneer’s voice rang out. "Two million, going once! Two million, going twice—"

He deliberately dragged out the pause, waiting to see if Nathan would bid again.
###Chapter 153 A Change of Attire

The auction hall fell into stunned silence. To everyone's astonishment, Nathan Blackwood subtly averted his gaze and ceased his bidding.

If she desires it that badly, let her have it. Nathan mused silently. The auctioneer's gavel struck decisively. "Sold for two million dollars!"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Had the formidable Mr. Blackwood actually conceded? The anticipated showdown had ended far too abruptly.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled in a cold smirk. This piece isn't worth nearly that much. Nathan deliberately inflated the price just to make me overspend.

She rose gracefully, Julian Moreau shadowing her steps as they moved to complete the transaction. Neither noticed the dark figure observing them from the shadows.

Presenting the exquisite cufflinks to Julian, Evelyn smiled. "These are for you."

Julian's eyes widened comically. "For me? But these cost two million!" His voice cracked slightly.

Evelyn nodded. "Consider it thanks for accompanying me tonight." She tilted her head. "Unless you'd prefer to regift them?"

Before Julian could respond, the sound of heavy footsteps storming away echoed through the corridor. Neither paid it any mind.

Natalie Beaumont entered with Lucas Sterling in tow. "I just saw Nathan leaving like a thundercloud," Natalie remarked with raised eyebrows. "Trouble in paradise?"

Julian shook his head blankly. "No one came in here..."

Evelyn recalled the retreating footsteps and understood instantly - though she couldn't care less. Natalie linked arms with her. "Let's grab dinner. I'm starving."

As they walked, Natalie marveled, "I can't believe Nathan actually backed down for you."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Backed down? He was driving up the price out of spite!"

Across the room, Cassandra Delacroix held court amidst a flock of sycophantic starlets. As the daughter of Celestial Media's CEO, she commanded both fear and flattery.

Spotting Evelyn, Cassandra's perfectly contoured face twisted with malice. "Ms. Sinclair," she purred, "how generous of you to shower gifts on your...companions." Her gaze flicked dismissively to Julian. "Do share your secret - how do you keep finding new men to parade about?"

The surrounding actresses tittered nervously, careful not to actually join in. Everyone knew better than to cross Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn's responding smile could have frozen hell over. She didn't need to move - her mere presence dimmed the beauty of every starlet present.

"Darling," Evelyn drawled, examining Cassandra through half-lidded eyes, "some of us are simply born with it. Though I suppose no amount of surgery could give you what I have."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson. The barb about her obvious cosmetic enhancements struck true. "You think your family name protects you?" she spat. "Nathan only married you because you were marginally fuckable!"

The air turned arctic. Natalie stepped forward, but Evelyn was faster.

"Funny," Evelyn mused, "I recall you getting rejected by him right before your third nose job. Coincidence?" She tapped a finger against her lips mockingly.

Cassandra's surgically enlarged eyes bulged dangerously. With a shriek, she grabbed the nearest cocktail and hurled it at Evelyn.

Evelyn yanked Natalie aside with lightning reflexes. The glass shattered harmlessly against the wall.

But the damage was done.

Harrison rushed forward in alarm. "Sir! Your suit!" He gestured frantically at Nathan's champagne-soaked attire. "Shall I arrange for a change of clothes?"
###Chapter 154

Nathan Blackwood's jaw clenched when he heard Evelyn Sinclair's earlier remark—that only Julian Moreau was worthy of those cufflinks. Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed off.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

Because now, as he strode through the crowd, he found Evelyn at the center of yet another commotion.

And then—splash.

A glass of juice hit him square in the chest.

Collateral damage.

Every eye in the room flicked to Cassandra Delacroix, the culprit, with expressions that screamed, You’re dead.

Cassandra froze, her lips trembling. "N-Nathan… are you okay?"

His gaze was glacial. "We’re not acquainted. Address me as Mr. Blackwood."

With that, he spared Evelyn—who looked utterly indifferent—one last glance before walking away.

No one had ever made Nathan Blackwood look this undignified.

Harrison, his assistant, scrambled after him.

Just moments ago, Cassandra had been boasting about her close relationship with Nathan, even hinting at a future marriage alliance between their families.

Now?

Publicly humiliated.

Not acquainted.

The words were a slap.

Cassandra’s fingers tightened around the empty glass, her nails digging into her palm. She glared at Evelyn, resentment burning in her eyes.

Natalie Beaumont, ever the instigator, smirked. "Maybe he just forgot your name. Did you even introduce yourself properly?"

Evelyn stifled a laugh and tugged Natalie away before things escalated.

The crowd quickly shifted topics, eager to avoid Cassandra’s wrath.

Dinner was about to begin.

Lucas Sterling, the biggest movie star present, lounged with effortless charm, while Julian Moreau, the rising young actor, stood nearby.

The organizers knew better than to pressure Lucas into making an appearance onstage—he did what he wanted, when he wanted.

So they turned to Julian instead.

Julian handled it smoothly, delivering his speech with practiced ease.

But the host couldn’t resist stirring the pot.

"Julian, now that you're of age, your fans are dying to know—what’s your ideal type of woman?"

Julian hesitated, then chuckled, shaking his head.

The host rephrased. "Among the ladies here tonight, is there anyone who catches your eye?"

The room held its breath.

Julian’s gaze landed on Evelyn in the crowd.

His smile was boyish, his small canine tooth peeking out. "Someone like Ms. Sinclair."

The audience erupted in cheers, all eyes darting to Evelyn for her reaction.

She laughed, shaking her head as she waved at him. Cute kid. Probably just grateful for the cufflinks.

Scandals didn’t faze her anymore.

But Julian? He might regret this later.

Two pairs of eyes burned into her from across the room—icy, unreadable.

She turned slightly and met Nathan’s dark stare.

Without hesitation, she looked away, pretending he didn’t exist.

Instead, she smiled at Julian, reassuring him she wasn’t upset.

Lucas, ever protective, sauntered onto the stage. "Hey, Julian. Evelyn’s my scandal partner right now. Share the spotlight, yeah?"

The crowd roared with laughter.

Lucas’s intervention saved Julian from further awkwardness.

But someone had already recorded the moment.

Cassandra smirked at her phone, uploading the clip with vicious satisfaction.

Let the world see what a shameless woman Evelyn Sinclair is.

The banquet dragged on late into the night.

When it ended, Lucas arranged for Julian’s ride while he escorted Natalie home.

Evelyn had driven herself.

As she stepped outside, she spotted Nathan and Cassandra by the valet.

"Couldn’t you take me home? It’s so late, and I’m scared to go alone," Cassandra whined, her voice dripping with faux vulnerability.

Nathan’s brow twitched. "It’s out of the way."

"Then take a detour! What if something happens to me?"

She reached for his arm—

He sidestepped.

Evelyn, hidden behind a pillar, bit back a laugh.

Nathan’s voice was dry. "You won’t be in danger."

The unspoken jab hung in the air: If anything, you’re the danger.
###Chapter 155 Just So Unlucky

Cassandra Delacroix refused to back down, her lips parting to deliver another cutting remark.

The sudden ringing of Evelyn Sinclair's phone shattered the tense silence. The cheerful melody was jarringly out of place.

With an irritated sigh, Evelyn answered the call and stepped away. It was Lucas Sterling.

"I heard there's a dangerous fugitive in the area. Stay put—I'm sending someone to pick you up."

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "Don't worry, I can handle myself."

She strode past Nathan Blackwood and Cassandra without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!" Nathan called after her. Before she could react, he was already following. "Let me drive you home."

She arched an eyebrow, amused by his audacity.

"Since when are we on speaking terms?" she scoffed. "Did you hit your head? I don't need your help. Don't flatter yourself."

"There's a violent criminal loose nearby," Nathan insisted, his voice flat. "If anything happens to you, the media will crucify me."

His shadow stretched long under the flickering streetlight, making him look oddly vulnerable.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn thought she detected genuine concern in his tone.

Since when does he care about my safety? She almost laughed. Next thing you know, pigs will fly.

Then Cassandra caught up, her face twisted in exaggerated distress.

Evelyn smirked. "No thanks. I'd rather take my chances with a fugitive than spend another minute in your company."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

"That arrogant bitch!" Cassandra seethed. "How dare she humiliate me like this? She did that on purpose!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Harrison pulled up in the car, and Nathan slid into the passenger seat without another word.

"Drive," he ordered coldly, ignoring Cassandra's protests. The car sped off.

The road ahead was poorly lit, several streetlights broken. An uneasy feeling settled in Nathan's chest.

Then he spotted it—a parked car up ahead, its interior dark.

"That's Evelyn's car."

It hadn't even been two minutes since they parted. Had something already happened?

"Stop the car!" Nathan barked.

He was out before the vehicle fully halted, sprinting toward the scene. Harrison followed close behind.

As they neared, a man's pained grunt reached their ears.

Evelyn stood in front of her car, facing a disheveled bald man clutching a knife.

The man's clothes were caked in mud, his expression wild with desperation.

Spotting the newcomers, he panicked and lunged at Evelyn.

She sidestepped effortlessly, her movements fluid and precise.

Sigh. Just my luck.

Of all people, I had to run into this psycho.

As the man swung the knife, Evelyn pivoted and delivered a sharp kick to his back.

His head slammed into the hood of her car with a sickening thud.

The man groaned, dazed but not defeated. He staggered up, raising the knife again—

Crack!

A scream tore through the night as the dagger clattered to the pavement.

Evelyn's stiletto heel was embedded in the back of his hand.

Harrison winced at the sound. If he hadn't seen it himself, he'd never believe the poised Evelyn Sinclair could fight like this.

She didn't give anyone a chance to play the hero.

Nathan moved before Harrison could react. "Call the police!" he snapped, already striding toward Evelyn.

Harrison fumbled for his phone.

Evelyn sensed someone approaching but didn't expect Nathan.

When she saw him, her expression cooled. She stepped past him without a word, swapping her ruined Chanel heels for spare flats.

The bloodstained designer shoes were a lost cause.

"Evelyn," Nathan said tightly. "Are you hurt?"
###Chapter 156 The Empty Fuel Tank

Nathan Blackwood seized Evelyn Sinclair's blood-smeared wrist, his voice rough with concern. "Whose blood is this?"

Evelyn jerked her arm free, avoiding his piercing gaze. "Not mine," she said curtly.

Without another word, she slid into her Lamborghini and turned the ignition. The police could handle the aftermath - she'd rather face a firing squad than spend another minute with Nathan.

His stormy eyes tracked her movements, jaw tightening at her icy dismissal.

Harrison finished restraining the assailant and rushed over. "Ms. Sterling, you should get checked at the hospital." His genuine concern made Evelyn soften.

"I'm fine, Harrison." She offered him a small smile. In those three miserable years of marriage, Harrison had been the only one who treated her with respect, never looking down on her like the rest of Nathan's circle.

Harrison frowned. "You're in shock. Let me call a driver for you."

Evelyn hesitated. She didn't trust herself behind the wheel right now, but waiting seemed equally unappealing.

Before Harrison could suggest an alternative, he suddenly stiffened under Nathan's glacial stare. The unspoken threat hung in the air like a guillotine blade.

Harrison cleared his throat. "Perhaps... President Blackwood could drive you home while I secure the suspect?"

The death glare lifted. Harrison exhaled in relief, feeling like he'd narrowly escaped career suicide.

"Have Nathan drive me?" Evelyn scoffed. "I'd rather wrestle another dozen armed criminals!"

Her engine sputtered and died.

She tried restarting it. Nothing. "Impossible. Archibald just imported this from Italy last week."

Harrison peered at the dashboard. "Ms. Sterling... you're out of gas."

"What the hell?!"

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smirk as he slid into his custom Bentley. Harrison swallowed hard. "It's getting late. Please ride with us."

Evelyn shook her head, reaching for her phone. "I'll call Bennett."

At that moment, her phone buzzed with Emily Whitaker's caller ID. "Evelyn! We did it! The neural interface works perfectly - three-second full-body diagnostics with 99.9% accuracy! We've cracked the CNS integration!"

Evelyn's breath caught. This breakthrough in AI-assisted medicine could revolutionize healthcare worldwide. No more hospital queues, just instant, precise health assessments. Her fingers trembled with excitement.

Meanwhile, Nathan received the same update. His eyes lit with the same fervor - this project could change humanity's future.

"Harrison, I'm heading to Dominic's office," Nathan ordered.

"Understood, sir."

Evelyn threw her keys to Harrison. "I'm coming too." Professional curiosity overrode personal animosity. History was being made tonight.

She yanked open Nathan's passenger door and buckled up. "Drive."

Nathan drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, studying her with deliberate slowness. "Evelyn..."
###Chapter 157 No Strings Attached

Evelyn Sinclair arched a brow, her lips curling into a dangerous smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, are you attempting to leverage this situation to negotiate with me?" Her gaze burned like molten gold, sharp enough to cut glass.

It wasn’t a question—it was a warning.

Nathan Blackwood exhaled sharply, tearing his eyes away before starting the engine. The thought had crossed his mind, but now? He couldn’t bring himself to do it.

He still owed her.

He had no right to demand anything.

Forgiveness? After everything? Impossible.

When they arrived at the research facility, Evelyn practically launched herself out of the car before it fully stopped.

And there he was—Donovan Sterling, waiting at the entrance like a silent sentinel.

Evelyn sprinted toward him, leaping into his arms with a force that nearly knocked him back. "It worked?" she gasped, clinging to him like a koala.

Donovan chuckled, ruffling her hair. "Mm."

His eyes flickered past her to Nathan, who was approaching with a storm brewing in his expression.

Not that Donovan cared.

Evelyn buried her face in his shoulder, inhaling the familiar scent of antiseptic and faint cologne. "Why were you waiting outside?"

"For you," he said simply, nudging her toward the building.

To an outsider, they looked like lovers.

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

The sight of them twisted something inside him, a slow, suffocating burn spreading through his chest.

Inside, Dominic Kingsley was practically vibrating with excitement. "Evelyn! Where did you find this guy? He’s a goddamn prodigy!"

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"Our most complex project—the one we’ve been stuck on for years—he solved it in one afternoon with a few formulas. No errors. No revisions. Just… perfection." Dominic raked a hand through his hair, awestruck. "He just saved us a decade of research and billions in funding."

His gaze swung to Donovan, reverence dripping from his voice. "Name your price. Ten times market rate. A hundred. Hell, I’ll give you equity in the company—just stay."

Donovan didn’t even glance up. "Not interested."

Evelyn shot Dominic a sympathetic look.

Money meant nothing to Donovan.

"You can break your contract—we’ll cover the penalties!" Dominic insisted desperately.

"National Laboratories," Evelyn said flatly.

Dominic froze.

"What?"

Evelyn tugged Donovan’s arm, steering him deeper into the facility. Behind them, Nathan lingered just long enough to deliver the final blow.

"Sunner is Donovan Sterling. If you value your company, drop this. You really think you can poach a national treasure?" He clapped Dominic on the shoulder, leaving him gaping in shock.

Sunner is Donovan Sterling?!

The 17-year-old who won the Breakthrough Prize?

The intern who had been quietly working here for a month?

Dominic stumbled after them. "What’s his relationship with Evelyn?"

Nathan’s voice was ice. "None."

Dominic scoffed. Bullshit.

Inside the lab, Emily Whitaker was practically bouncing as she presented a palm-sized, irregular sphere to Evelyn. "This is a microscopic bio-carrier. No blood tests needed—just three seconds of contact, and it scans your entire body."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "You’re joking."

But with Donovan around, nothing was impossible.

Hesitantly, she pressed her palm against the sphere.

Warmth.

A soft blue glow pulsed beneath her fingertips.

One… Two… Three…

Ding!

"Abnormal condition detected," chirped a robotic voice. "Laceration on left inner arm: 9.9 cm in length, 4 mm depth. Clotting normal. Mild bacterial infection present. Recommended treatment: antiseptic and anti-inflammatory medication. Expected healing time: three to four days."

Silence.

Then chaos.

Emily gaped. "It detected that through your sleeve?"

Before she or Donovan could react, Nathan lunged forward, gripping Evelyn’s wrist. His voice was lethal.

"You said you weren’t hurt."
###Chapter 158 I Just Want to Make It up to Her

Evelyn Sinclair frowned. Why was Nathan Blackwood reacting so intensely? What did her injury have to do with him?

"Mr. Blackwood, let me." In the tense silence, Donovan Sterling stepped forward, gently removing Evelyn's arm from Nathan's grip. He rubbed the reddened skin where Nathan had held her too tightly.

Donovan had no patience for Nathan. Wasn't he Evelyn's ex-husband? Their marriage was over—this was none of his business. Guiding Evelyn to the lounge, he retrieved the first aid kit and carefully dressed her wound.

"How did this happen?"

Evelyn was still buzzing from the breakthrough with their AI medical device. The minor injury barely registered.

"It's nothing. Just a run-in with a thug. I handled him."

She grinned. "This scratch is nothing compared to what he got."

Donovan smirked. He knew Evelyn could fight. Anyone stupid enough to challenge her would regret it. His fingers worked deftly over the wound, applying antiseptic with practiced ease.

"You're too easily impressed. This prototype is child's play."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Of course a genius like Donovan would downplay their success. But to her, this was monumental.

"Next step—market launch! The world needs to see what we've achieved."

Donovan shook his head. "It's not ready."

"What do you mean? The chip diagnosed my injury perfectly—even recommended treatment!"

"It's limited," he countered. "The parameters we've set only cover basic conditions. Complex diseases? Specialized treatments? That requires human expertise."

Evelyn huffed. "Fine, maybe it won't replace doctors, but think of the time saved on routine cases! The ER backlog it could clear!"

Donovan sighed. "Global commercialization means navigating different countries' drug regulations. One recommended medication might be banned elsewhere."

Evelyn hadn't considered that. The road ahead was longer than she'd realized.

Still, today's success was historic.

Donovan flicked her forehead lightly. "Relax. This alone will double your net worth."

Her eyes sparkled. Even without mass production, the stock market would skyrocket at this news. Fortunes awaited.

Leaving the lounge, Evelyn spotted Nathan deep in conversation with Dominic Kingsley. She paused, catching her name.

"Mr. Blackwood, why the panic over Evelyn's injury?" Dominic's voice carried. "Still have feelings for your ex-wife?"

Nathan stood rigid, staring at the city lights beyond the window. His reply was ice-cold.

"No. I owe her. Making amends eases my conscience."

He hesitated, then added, "Feelings? Don't be absurd."

The words struck Evelyn like physical blows. That familiar ache returned—the suffocating weight of their failed marriage. She closed her eyes briefly, steadying herself.

When she opened them, her resolve was steel.

Leaving Nathan had been her best decision.

Donovan emerged, now changed. "Let's go."

At the sound, Nathan tensed. Turning slowly, his gaze locked onto Evelyn. A flicker of panic crossed his face.

Had she heard?

The thought unsettled him more than he cared to admit.
###Chapter 159 Her Love Triangle

Dominic Kingsley strode toward Evelyn Sinclair with barely contained excitement. His entire demeanor radiated triumph.

"Evelyn, we're holding a press conference tomorrow to announce our breakthrough—we're leading the world in medical innovation!"

Evelyn had already considered this, not wanting competitors to steal their thunder.

She smiled, amused by Dominic's enthusiasm. If she had overheard his earlier exchange with Nathan Blackwood, she gave no indication.

"Perfect. I'll be there." She turned to Donovan Sterling. "Want to come?"

Dominic's eyes gleamed with anticipation. Having Donovan's name attached would elevate the project even further.

Donovan shook his head.

His refusal was firm. Dominic's shoulders slumped slightly, but he knew better than to push the genius scientist.

Nathan's dark gaze lingered on Evelyn's injured arm.

For once, he wasn't seething with irritation. But Evelyn paid him no mind.

"How's your wound? Should we delay the press conference?" Nathan's voice was uncharacteristically measured.

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into a cold smirk. "I won't die from it."

She didn't bother hiding her sarcasm. "Thanks for the concern, Mr. Blackwood. Spare me the act."

Then she blinked up at Donovan. "Ready to go home?"

Donovan nodded, draping his coat over her shoulders before meticulously fastening each button.

The oversized coat swallowed Evelyn's frame, making her look adorably small. Dominic gaped.

The man who revolutionizes science is buttoning her coat like a doting husband?!

Nathan's jaw tightened at Evelyn's sharp dismissal. The chill in her voice cut deeper than he expected.

Then she said home—with him.

His chest constricted.

"Do you need a ride?" Nathan bit out abruptly.

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. Nathan Blackwood offering to chauffeur someone?

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "We're not headed the same way."

We. She'd drawn a line between them so clearly it might as well have been a wall.

Nathan's expression darkened.

Without another word, Evelyn and Donovan walked away. Nathan watched until they disappeared, his fists clenched.

Dominic smirked. "Well, that answers my earlier question." He couldn't resist adding, "Seems they're living together, huh?"

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. He stormed off without another word.

Exhausted from the night's events, Evelyn collapsed into bed the moment they returned.

Morning light streamed through the sheer curtains, but she burrowed deeper under the covers—until her phone blared incessantly.

Natalie Beaumont's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn groaned. "Can't my friends let me sleep?"

She answered, voice rough with sleep. "Nat, what's so urgent?"

"You're trending as Julian Moreau's sugar mommy, and you're still asleep?"

Evelyn bolted upright. "What? I just met him yesterday!"

Natalie laughed. "Someone edited footage from his speech and dragged Lucas into it. Your love triangle's practically a bestselling plot now."

"Let me guess—Cassandra Delacroix?"

"Bingo!"

Evelyn threw off the covers, seething. "Today's supposed to be my payday, and she pulls this?"

Her eyes flashed dangerously.

"Anyone who messes with my money will regret it."
###Chapter 160 I'll Bury Him

The moment Evelyn Sinclair ended her call with Natalie Beaumont, she immediately dialed Bennett.

"Is it too late to acquire a company before the press conference?" There was a brief pause as Bennett processed the question.

"That depends on the company's size. Has President Sinclair developed an addiction to corporate takeovers?"

"Celestial Media."

"That's not as simple as Kensington Group last week. The paperwork will be tedious and take several days. However..." His tone shifted. "We already hold 16% of their shares."

"Horizon Media owns 30%. If you secure just five percent more, you'll become the largest shareholder—effectively gaining control. It would be no different from an outright acquisition."

Evelyn's lips curved in satisfaction. "Make it happen. Quickly." She hung up, tending to her wound before leisurely preparing a sandwich. As she ate, she scrolled through today's trending topics—predictably dominated by her name.

[Julian Moreau has a crush on Evelyn Sinclair's type! Same!]
[I'd normally despise a homewrecker, but if it's Evelyn? Iconic.]
[Lucas Sterling must be fuming!]
[Honestly, they'd make a stunning couple. The chemistry!]
[Isn't Julian underage? Is this even legal?]
[Rumor has it Celestial Media plans to smear Julian. Sugar Mama Evelyn, save your boy!]

Evelyn scoffed, tossing her phone aside. The internet loved turning drama into a spectacle.

After breakfast, instead of heading to Sterling Corp, she went straight to Horizon Media. If she was taking over Celestial Media, she needed someone reliable to handle the logistics—and Dominic Young was the perfect candidate.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the lobby, her gaze landed on Cassandra Delacroix, draped in head-to-toe designer labels, oozing arrogance.

Cassandra was the epitome of a spoiled heiress—wasting her family's fortune abroad, then strutting around like she'd conquered the world. The irony? She couldn't even hold a fluent conversation in any foreign language.

Evelyn wondered where she got the audacity.

She intended to ignore Cassandra, but the woman spotted her instantly, eyes lighting up with malicious glee.

"Evelyn! Here to beg Dominic for help with your PR crisis?" Cassandra's grin was venomous, her voice dripping with faux sweetness. "How pathetic."

Evelyn paused, tilting her head. A slow, dangerous smirk played on her lips. "Since when do you have a say in Horizon Media's affairs?"

Cassandra's expression darkened, resentment flaring. She hadn't forgotten how Nathan Blackwood had abandoned her to chase after Evelyn. The humiliation still burned.

"Nobody in this industry dares to cross me," she hissed. "I came here to make sure your reputation craters. You might be untouchable in your little corporate bubble, but I’ll have the entire internet dragging you until you question your existence. Understand?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, fingers tapping idly against her sleeve. Her voice turned icy. "So you're the one spreading rumors that I'm Julian’s sugar mommy?" She arched a brow. "Tell me, Cassandra—are you trying to provoke me?"

Cassandra lifted her chin, smugness radiating off her. "Consider it a lesson. The world doesn’t revolve around you. Did Julian say he admires you? Good. I’ll bury him at the peak of his fame. Let’s see who really holds the power here."

She wasn’t afraid of Evelyn.

Three years ago, Evelyn had stolen Nathan from her. Now? This was payback.

Cassandra would relish watching Evelyn's downfall.
###Chapter 161 The Queen of Horror

Cassandra's threat hung in the air like cheap perfume.

Evelyn Sinclair merely tilted her chin down, her lips curling into an amused smirk. Not a single tremor of fear betrayed her composure.

To her, Cassandra Delacroix's words were nothing more than the pathetic rantings of a desperate woman.

Just as Cassandra's face twisted with rage, Evelyn finally spoke in that cool, detached tone that drove her enemies mad. "Tell me, Ms. Delacroix—are you throwing this tantrum because of Nathan Blackwood?"

A flicker of panic crossed Cassandra's features before she lifted her chin defiantly. "Why should I deny it? Since you're already divorced, stay the hell away from him! Or I'll make sure you regret it."

Evelyn arched a brow, her laugh sharp as shattered glass. "How amusing. I don't make a habit of revisiting trash I've already taken out."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "If anything, you should be begging him to stay away from me. What is it about Nathan that turns women into fools? I was blind once—but never again."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson.

The way Evelyn carried herself—regal, untouchable, effortlessly radiant—made Cassandra's blood boil. How dare she dismiss the man Cassandra coveted like he was nothing?

"You want to bury Julian Moreau?" Evelyn continued, her gaze slicing through Cassandra like a blade. "Then watch me make him a star."

Her smile was poison. "Let me show you who really holds the power here."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "You arrogant bitch! We'll see who comes out on top!"

Evelyn didn't bother responding. She simply turned on her heel and strode toward the elevators, leaving Cassandra fuming in her wake.

The receptionist perked up instantly at Evelyn's approach. "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Young will be thrilled you're here. Shall I notify him?"

Evelyn gave a graceful nod. "No need. I'll head up."

The receptionist rushed to summon the elevator, blatantly ignoring Cassandra.

"Excuse me!" Cassandra snapped. "Are you blind? I demand to see Dominic Young immediately!"

The receptionist blinked, unimpressed. "Miss, if you're here for an audition, we don't accept walk-ins. You'll need an appointment."

Cassandra's jaw dropped. "Audition? Do I look like some desperate starlet to you?"

The receptionist gave her a once-over. "Honestly? No. Our casting directors prefer natural beauty."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Cassandra whirled on her, teeth bared. "What's so funny?"

Evelyn wiped a tear from her eye, still grinning. "Oh, nothing. Just imagining you as the lead in a horror film. You'd be perfect."

Cassandra lunged—only to be blocked by security.

"Mark my words, Evelyn!" she shrieked. "You won't be laughing when I'm done with you!"

Evelyn merely waved over her shoulder as the elevator doors slid shut.
###Chapter 162 Her Father Wouldn't Dare

Cassandra Delacroix's words were cut off as the private elevator chimed its arrival.

Dominic Young stepped out, his sharp gaze sweeping across the lobby before landing on Evelyn Sinclair. A visible relief washed over his features as he approached with a respectful nod.

"Ms. Sinclair, you only needed to call. There was no need for you to come personally."

His deferential tone contrasted sharply with his usual commanding presence in the entertainment industry.

Cassandra's lips twisted in irritation. She couldn't stand how this woman wielded power simply by being born into the Sterling family.

"Dominic Young!" she snapped. "Do you know who you're talking to?"

His expression turned glacial. "I believe you were about to threaten physical violence against Ms. Sinclair?"

Cassandra lifted her chin. "I'm the daughter of Celestial Media's CEO! Ask Evelyn if you don't believe me!"

The desperation in her voice was palpable as she invoked Evelyn's name for validation.

Evelyn merely smiled, content to watch Cassandra dig her own grave. She wouldn't lift a finger to help.

Dominic's lips curled in derision. "Your father wouldn't dare speak to me like that. You've got nerve."

Cassandra's confidence wavered as Dominic failed to show the deference she expected. She'd always assumed her father and Dominic were equals.

"Mr. Young," she tried again, emphasizing, "I'm here on business matters."

Dominic dismissed her with a wave. "You're not qualified to discuss business with me. I don't entertain irrelevant people."

He turned to the receptionist. "Donovan, have security escort her out."

"Yes, sir," Donovan responded promptly.

Dominic offered Evelyn a reassuring smile. "You're completely safe here, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn nodded, unfazed by Cassandra's empty threats. "She's all bark and no bite."

As they entered the elevator, Evelyn handed Dominic her phone. "This might help clear Julian's name."

The recording of Cassandra's earlier outburst played clearly. Dominic's smirk grew with each passing second.

"Ms. Sinclair," he teased, "you set quite the elaborate trap."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "I've initiated the acquisition of Celestial Media. The shareholders' meeting is this afternoon. Any issues on your end?"

Dominic straightened immediately. "None whatsoever. Horizon Media is at your complete disposal."

He'd known since taking the helm that crossing the Sterlings was professional suicide.

Evelyn chuckled. "You'll have your hands full managing both companies after the merger."

Dominic's eyes lit up at the unspoken offer. "How exciting! I suppose I'll just have to work harder." He winked. "I'm still young, after all."

Evelyn fought back a laugh at the forty-something executive's declaration.

Their discussion turned to post-acquisition strategies. As it wound down, Evelyn asked, "How's Julian holding up? This can't be easy for a new actor."

"He's fine," Dominic assured. "Though his team is panicking. They got thrown out of Celestial Media when they tried to plead his case." He added confidently, "But with your help, this will blow over quickly."

Evelyn nodded. "Give him more projects as compensation. He got caught in the crossfire because of me."

Dominic grinned. "Of course. No one would dare mess with your protégé."

"Get lost!" Evelyn shot back, her cheeks flushing. Dominic had spent too much time with Lucas - they'd both developed the same infuriating habit of teasing her.

Business concluded, Evelyn strode away in her designer heels. Any longer and she might have punched someone.

Within minutes, the recording went viral, dethroning the "sugar mama" scandal as the top trending topic.

Cassandra hadn't even made it back to Celestial Media to complain to her father before the internet exploded with investigations into "Ms. Sinclair." Soon, Cassandra's own dirty laundry began surfacing.
###Chapter 163 Evelyn Sinclair's Favorite

Cassandra Delacroix had been expelled from high school for bullying classmates and was shipped off to Europe for a year of "character rehabilitation."

When Cassandra returned to Montecito, she became obsessed with Nathan Blackwood, but her confession ended in brutal rejection. Undeterred, she flew to Seoul for extensive plastic surgery, leaving none of her original features intact.

The moment Cassandra caught wind of Nathan's divorce, she rushed back to Montecito like a storm.

But what truly set the internet ablaze was the second half of that leaked recording:

"Ms. Delacroix, is this all because of Nathan Blackwood? I don’t make a habit of revisiting discarded trash."

"Tell him to stay out of my way! You want to bury Julian? Fine. I’ll make sure he shines brighter than ever."

"Let me remind you—I decide who rules this game."

The comments section erupted.

(OMG! The sheer audacity! Queen Evelyn is unstoppable!)

(With a fortune like hers, why would she waste time on an ex? Fresh talent is way more exciting!)

(Thank you, Ms. Sinclair, for noticing our Julian! He deserves the world!)

(Cassandra is pathetic. She should crawl back into whatever hole she came from.)

(Evelyn’s dominance is everything. Forever my idol!)

(Age is just a number, but youth? Irresistible. Evelyn knows what she wants!)

The aftermath? The world now believed Evelyn Sinclair had a soft spot for gorgeous young men.

Blackwood Enterprises

The air in Nathan’s office turned glacial.

Silence.

Nathan’s expression was thunderous, his aura so oppressive that Harrison nearly flinched.

Harrison had seen the news at dawn and reported it immediately. But before they could react, public opinion had already shifted.

At first, people mocked Evelyn for being Julian’s "sugar mommy." Now? They praised her for having impeccable taste.

Harrison had never felt minutes drag so painfully.

Nathan’s fury was a living thing, suffocating the room.

He scrolled through the comments, jaw clenched. Some fans had even edited clips of Evelyn and Julian, adding romantic music as if they were the next power couple.

Julian, the rising star. Nathan, the "overpowered has-been."

With a snarl, Nathan hurled his phone against the wall. The screen shattered.

Harrison stiffened.

Nathan’s voice was razor-sharp. "Don’t these people have jobs? ‘Young hunk’? He looks like a child! How is that compatibility?"

Harrison swallowed. "Julian’s fans are delusional. There’s no way Ms. Sinclair would seriously entertain him. He’s just using her for clout."

Internally, he sighed. Why does he even care? They’re divorced.

Nathan’s mind circled back to Evelyn’s words—discarded trash.

Was that meant for him?

His grip tightened.

"Then what," Nathan bit out, "do you think Evelyn actually likes?"

Harrison hesitated.

Nathan’s glare darkened. That night, she smiled at Harrison more in five minutes than she ever did at me in years.

Why?

The bitterness in his chest was impossible to ignore.
###Chapter 164 The Type She Likes

For a brief moment, Harrison felt as though an unseen force had lifted him from his chair by the collar of his shirt.

The suffocating tension in the room was unbearable.

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze darkened when Harrison remained silent.

"You two are close, aren't you?" Nathan's voice was deceptively calm, each word laced with lethal precision. "Tell me, what kind of man does she prefer?"

Harrison swallowed hard. If he didn't answer, he wasn’t sure he’d leave this office unscathed.

Working for Nathan had always been dangerous, but today felt like walking a tightrope over a pit of vipers.

Clearing his throat, Harrison forced out a reply.

"Mr. Blackwood, I wouldn’t say I’m particularly close to Ms. Sinclair. How would I know her preferences?"

Nathan’s icy stare made him hastily add, "But—given that she chose to marry you despite everything, it’s obvious she prefers someone like you! That Julian Moreau is nothing in comparison. There’s no way Ms. Sinclair would lower her standards for him."

Nathan exhaled sharply, finally looking away. Harrison barely suppressed a sigh of relief.

That was too close.

After a tense silence, Nathan spoke again. "Start preparing for the press conference."

"Ensure Kingsley Tech’s event goes flawlessly. No mistakes."

"Understood. I’ll oversee everything personally," Harrison replied, already backing toward the door.

Nathan scoffed, picking up his phone only to toss it aside again in disgust. The endless gossip about Evelyn and Julian was infuriating.

How dare they compare that nobody to me? Are the public blind?

Across the city, the media frenzy had reached a fever pitch.

Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Moreau’s rumored relationship had become the nation’s hottest topic. Though neither had confirmed anything, fans had already paired them together.

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling’s social media was flooded with messages—some sympathizing, others offering advice on how to win Evelyn back.

A few even urged him to move on.

The joint project between Kingsley Tech, Sterling Corporation, and Blackwood Industries had already drawn massive attention.

Now, the three companies were holding a high-profile press conference, instantly dominating headlines.

Every major news outlet scrambled for details, but Dominic Kingsley had kept everything tightly under wraps.

By the time the event began, three hundred journalists packed the venue, buzzing with anticipation.

Alongside the press, world-renowned medical experts and leading AI specialists had been invited, lending an air of gravitas to the occasion.

At the appointed hour, Dominic Kingsley, Nathan Blackwood, and Evelyn Sinclair appeared together on stage.

Evelyn, standing between the two powerful men, commanded attention effortlessly. Her poise was regal, her beauty undeniable.

She was born to stand at the pinnacle, untouchable.

Dominic looked impeccable in his tailored smoky-gray suit, exuding quiet authority.

Nathan, in his signature black ensemble, was the epitome of cold elegance—untouchable, formidable.

The trio’s presence alone eclipsed every celebrity in the room. Had they chosen entertainment over business, they would’ve dominated the industry.

Though the internet buzzed with speculation about Nathan and Evelyn’s relationship, no one dared broach the subject today.

This was far too serious an occasion for gossip.

Dominic stepped forward.

"Let’s begin."
###Chapter 165 Personal Question

The entire presentation was dominated by Dominic Kingsley's articulate explanation of the revolutionary AI chip, which he proudly named Aether Core.

Its potential impact stretched far beyond Montecito—this breakthrough would redefine medical science globally. A true game-changer.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained her composed smile throughout the press conference, her attention fixed on Dominic's every word.

Her eyes sparkled with restrained excitement. At this moment, she couldn't help but reflect on those wasted years of marriage.

I should have focused on my career from the start.

As Dominic concluded, the room erupted in thunderous applause. Experts and journalists swarmed him, eager for more details. The conference extended another hour.

Evelyn checked her phone. A message from Bennett confirmed everything was set for the Celestial Media acquisition. All that remained was her presence at the shareholders' meeting.

She stood, intending to slip out unnoticed.

But the moment she stepped into the hallway, reporters surrounded her.

"Ms. Sinclair, any comments on today's announcement?"

Evelyn gave a polite smile. "Mr. Kingsley covered everything inside. I suggest you direct your questions to him."

Her approachable demeanor eased the tension.

"Ms. Sinclair, may we ask a personal question?"

She arched a brow but didn't refuse outright.

"Depends how personal. I reserve the right not to answer."

A reporter grinned. "Julian Moreau recently named you as his ideal type in an interview. What kind of man do you prefer?"

The air thickened with anticipation.

Evelyn's smile widened.

"Like everyone else, I admire Julian."

A diplomatic answer—one that left room for interpretation.

Admire, not desire. They should know the difference.

The reporters chuckled but didn't press further, parting to let her pass.

Then they noticed Nathan Blackwood standing nearby.

His icy glare silenced them instantly. This was the man who could dismantle media empires overnight—the one person journalists feared most.

Evelyn pretended not to see him. She turned back to the cameras, flashing a radiant smile before striding away, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

Inside her car, Bennett handed her a document.

"Five percent of Celestial Media's shares were acquired by Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn froze.

Before she could react, a sharp knock sounded on the window.

Nathan stood outside, his expression dark, brows furrowed.

She lowered the window just enough.

"Mr. Blackwood. Is there a problem? I have a shareholders' meeting to attend."

"My car broke down." He gestured to the Range Rover parked nearby, where Harrison knelt beside a tire, holding a nail with visible reluctance.

Evelyn smirked. "You're not on my way. So, no."

She moved to raise the window, but his hand blocked it.

"You didn't even ask where I'm going." His voice was dangerously smooth, laced with suppressed irritation.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Is he really this dense?

She met his gaze, her lips curling into a cold smile.

"I don't need to ask. Wherever it is, I'm not interested."
###Chapter 166 Transfer Funds to Mr. Blackwood

The air inside the luxury sedan turned thick with tension.

Nathan's jaw clenched visibly, his stormy gaze locked onto Evelyn. His lips pressed into a thin, disapproving line.

With no audience to perform for, Evelyn didn't bother maintaining their usual facade of civility. To her, Nathan Blackwood had forfeited any right to forgiveness long ago. She treated complete strangers - Sebastian Hart, Lucas Sterling, Donovan, even Julian Moreau - with more warmth than she'd ever show him.

Evelyn lounged carelessly in her seat, waiting for Nathan to take the hint and leave.

Her car wasn't some public space where just anyone could linger. Especially not Nathan Blackwood! A full sixty seconds ticked by with him stubbornly remaining in place.

Her brows knitted together in irritation. Was he being deliberately obtuse? Just as she prepared to verbally evict him, Nathan finally spoke, his voice like ice cracking.

"Evelyn, are you certain you won't attend the event with me?" Absolutely certain, she thought.

Before she could voice this, Bennett cleared his throat meaningfully beside her.

Nathan gave a humorless chuckle. "Though you've purchased those five percent shares of Celestial Media from me, the paperwork remains unsigned."

"We can consider the deal void if you're unwilling." Evelyn's eyes widened. What fresh hell was this?

Bennett winced, then explained hurriedly, "Ms. Sinclair, I was just about to mention this detail."

"Mr. Blackwood did agree to the share transfer, but the final signatures are still pending." Evelyn inhaled sharply through her nose, shooting her assistant a withering look.

Why hadn't he mentioned this crucial detail sooner? Bennett ducked his head, wisely avoiding her glare. Nathan's lips quirked in a smirk that would make lesser women swoon.

He drummed his fingers twice against the window frame, waiting.

One heartbeat. Two. Then he turned sharply on his heel.

"Wait!" The word escaped Evelyn before she could stop it. Nathan paused mid-step. She closed her eyes briefly, fists tightening before addressing Bennett through gritted teeth.

"Why haven't you opened the door for Mr. Blackwood yet?" Bennett scrambled to obey, opening the rear passenger door with excessive politeness.

"Mr. Blackwood, if you please." Nathan's back remained turned, but the ghost of a satisfied smile flickered across his face before vanishing. Without ceremony, he slid into the leather seat.

The moment he entered, her signature Chanel No. 5 enveloped him - that distinctive blend of floral and aldehydic notes that was so quintessentially Evelyn. Strangely, the scent he usually found cloying on other women seemed to suit her perfectly.

Evelyn examined the documents in her lap. Sure enough, Nathan's signature was conspicuously absent from the transfer papers.

Her lips thinned as she regarded him coolly. "Mr. Blackwood, why are you divesting from Celestial Media? And why now?" Surely the Blackwood fortune wasn't so depleted that he needed to liquidate assets.

Nathan studied her guarded expression, the perpetual distrust in her eyes. Would she ever believe he could act without ulterior motives? Wordlessly, he took the documents from her, scrawled his signature with a flourish, and handed them back.

"Satisfied?" Evelyn stared at the bold ink strokes, momentarily transported back to their divorce papers - signed with that same decisive finality. She blinked away the memory, her expression turning arctic.

"Ensure Mr. Blackwood receives payment immediately," she instructed Bennett, who nodded vigorously. No debts between them, no lingering connections.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes as she changed subjects. "You know what I'm planning to do about Cassandra Delacroix, don't you? I'd have thought you'd show her more leniency, given her... devotion to you. But then, you've never been kind to women who love you."
###Chapter 167 Not Necessarily Yours

Evelyn's casual remark struck Nathan like a lightning bolt. His chest tightened as her words echoed in his mind.

Had he always been so heartless to the women who loved him? First Evelyn, then Vanessa, and now Cassandra Delacroix. Nathan's jaw clenched as dark emotions swirled in his stormy gray eyes.

His voice dropped to a husky whisper when he finally spoke. "Evelyn, you're different from them." At least Evelyn had once been his wife. The others meant nothing to him.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her lips curling into a bitter smile. When she looked up again, her sapphire eyes had turned to ice. "Of course I'm different. I was the lucky one who married you because of my rare blood type." Her mocking laugh cut through the tense air before she turned away sharply.

Nathan's frown deepened. That wasn't what he meant at all.

"We've arrived, Ms. Sinclair," Bennett announced, relief evident in his voice. The car ride had been torture. Evelyn practically flung the door open, desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere.

Nathan followed close behind. The two had just left Kingsley Tech's press conference together, and now they were arriving at Celestial Media's headquarters simultaneously. Every head turned as they stepped out of the same black limousine.

The sudden shareholders meeting was already raising eyebrows. Having both Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair show up together sent shockwaves through Celestial Media's executives. None dared to offend either powerhouse.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair..." The greetings came rapid-fire as executives scrambled to show respect. Nathan barely nodded, his mood too foul for pleasantries.

Vincent Delacroix, Celestial Media's chairman, personally escorted them to the elevator, bowing slightly. "After you." No one else would presume to share the elevator with such important figures.

Nathan stepped in first, but Evelyn remained outside with a polite smile. "You all go ahead. I need to make a call." She turned on her heel without a backward glance.

Nathan's hands clenched into fists at his sides. Though unspoken, her message was clear - she couldn't stand being confined with him. The others exchanged confused glances but obeyed without question.

Bennett quickly made excuses for Evelyn as the group proceeded to the top-floor conference room. Soon the lounge area stood empty except for Evelyn.

She took Lucas's call by the floor-to-ceiling windows, discussing trivial matters before hanging up. When she turned, she found herself face-to-face with a furious Cassandra Delacroix.

"Evelyn!" Cassandra spat the name like a curse. "What the hell are you doing here?" Since the recording of Cassandra's verbal attack on Evelyn went viral, public opinion had turned sharply against her.

Despite spending a fortune on damage control, Cassandra couldn't escape the backlash. Overnight, she'd become social media's favorite villain. Meanwhile, Evelyn appeared at the press conference with Nathan and Dominic Kingsley, cool and composed as ever.

The media dubbed Evelyn "The Most Captivating CEO in History," while Cassandra had to flee her spa appointment mid-treatment from all the Evelyn praise. The injustice burned in Cassandra's chest.

Now finding Evelyn lounging in her family company like she owned the place? Unacceptable. "This is my territory!" Cassandra hissed, her manicured nails digging into her palms. "I won't tolerate your presence here."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her icy blue eyes. "As a shareholder of Celestial Media, I don't need your permission to attend meetings." She tilted her head, a panther toying with its prey. "Unless I'm mistaken, you don't actually hold any shares, do you?"

Cassandra's face twisted with rage. "This is my family's business! I can come whenever I want. You're the one who doesn't belong here!" Her voice rose to a shrill pitch. "That pathetic little stake of yours means nothing! My father will buy you out immediately, so get out!"

Evelyn tucked a stray golden lock behind her ear, her movements deliberate. "Your family business?" Her lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Not necessarily." The mocking glint in her eyes promised a storm coming.

Soon, Celestial Media wouldn't belong to the Delacroix family at all. It would be hers.
###Chapter 168 Is This Your Worth?

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't wait to witness Cassandra Delacroix's reaction. The anticipation sent a thrill down her spine.

"Don't flatter yourself, Evelyn! You're no better than me!" Cassandra's voice trembled with barely contained rage. "We both rely on family connections, so who are you to look down on me?"

Her manicured fingers dug into her arms as she squared her shoulders. The elevator lobby's harsh lighting accentuated the venom in her glare.

"Weren't you thrown out by the Blackwoods too? Now you're just using your family name to chase after Nathan again?" Cassandra's laugh was brittle. "Pathetic. Tell me, Evelyn - is this really your worth?"

She waited for the outburst, the tears, anything to crack Evelyn's infuriating composure. Instead, she got a smirk that could freeze hell.

"Ms. Delacroix," Evelyn's voice was glacial silk, "even you should know this by now. The Blackwoods didn't discard me."

She took a deliberate step forward, the click of her Louboutins echoing in the sudden silence. "I walked away from Nathan Blackwood. And unlike you, I'd never degrade myself by changing my face for a man's attention."

The elevator dinged its arrival just as Evelyn turned away, leaving Cassandra gaping like a beached fish.

It took three heartbeats for the insult to register. Cassandra's shriek shattered the corporate calm. "How dare you! In my own building!"

Blind rage propelled her forward. She grabbed Evelyn's wrist with enough force to leave bruises, her other hand raised to strike.

The slap never landed.

A polished Oxford shoe connected with Cassandra's ribs first. The impact sent her sprawling across the marble in a tangle of designer fabric and shattered dignity.

Vincent Delacroix emerged from the elevator, his expression thunderous. "You'd lay hands on a Sinclair in my presence?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Should've stayed in that Seoul hospital bed, daughter."
###Chapter 169 I Hit You on Purpose

Cassandra Delacroix didn't give a damn about consequences. She reached out to grab her father's arm. "Dad, why are you—"

Vincent Delacroix shoved her off, his mind replaying Evelyn Sinclair's warning. With a rough jerk, he yanked Cassandra back.

His grip was bruising. "Listen carefully. Evelyn Sinclair controls Sterling Corporation now. She could wipe this company off the map with a single word. So unless you want to end up penniless in Seoul, you will shut your mouth and behave."

Cassandra's face paled. A cold dread slithered through her veins.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn and Nathan Blackwood stood in silence until they reached the conference room doors.

Bennett was already waiting. He opened the door for them without a word. Nathan's presence alone commanded attention—intimidating, magnetic, impossible to ignore.

Yet when they entered, Evelyn walked ahead of him.

Her aura matched his, but with an icy elegance that made her impossible to overlook. The moment she stepped inside, Vincent and Cassandra scrambled to follow.

The meeting began.

Evelyn barely spoke, letting Bennett handle the proceedings with crisp efficiency. Cassandra sat stiffly, her palms clammy, her mind numb.

She couldn't tear her eyes away from Evelyn—regal, untouchable, seated at the head of the table like a queen.

The gap between them wasn't just wealth or status. It was power.

And Evelyn had just demonstrated exactly how much of it she wielded.

Nathan watched Evelyn with unwavering focus, as if she were the sole reason he'd bothered to attend.

Cassandra heard every word.

Evelyn now controlled Celestial Media as its majority shareholder.

She'd removed Vincent Delacroix as chairman and replaced him with Dominic Young of Horizon Media.

Celestial was now just another subsidiary under Sterling Corporation’s empire.

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly as she watched Cassandra’s expression shift from shock to horror.

Pathetic. But entertaining.

After this, Vincent wouldn’t dare keep his troublesome daughter around. Not when he had an illegitimate son waiting in the wings.

Good riddance.

When the meeting ended, Evelyn didn’t linger. A glance at Bennett was all it took—he stayed to handle the cleanup while she left.

Alone in her car, Evelyn turned the key and pulled into traffic.

A Range Rover crawled ahead of her at the intersection.

Her fingers tapped impatiently against the wheel. The moment it inched forward, she pressed the accelerator—

CRASH.

The impact jolted her forward.

Damn it.

She shouldn’t have tailgated.

Just her luck—a perfect day ruined by a fender bender.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and reached for the door handle.

Then the driver of the Range Rover stepped out.

Her stomach dropped.

Nathan Blackwood.

She squinted at the license plate. Same model, different number.

Of course. He owns half a dozen identical cars.

Nathan strode toward her, his expression thunderous. He rapped sharply on her window.

Dark, piercing eyes locked onto hers through the glass.

Evelyn swallowed.

She was at fault. She’d pay.

But the way he was looking at her—

"Nathan, I can explain—"

His voice cut through the glass, low and accusing.

"Evelyn. You hit me on purpose."
###Chapter 170 Private Settlement?

Evelyn's mind raced. Did he just accuse me of deliberately hitting his car? The audacity!

Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel. It was clearly him who slammed on the brakes without warning.

A fleeting memory surfaced - hadn't she seen a child walking near the Range Rover moments before impact?

No escaping now. She rolled down her window, lips pressed into a thin line before curving into a mocking smile.

"Guilty as charged." Her voice dripped with icy amusement. "I absolutely meant to rear-end you."

Nathan's eyes narrowed, his frown deepening.

"Interesting admission." His gravelly voice held no warmth. "What's your play here?"

Evelyn met his gaze with frosty indifference.

"Name your price. I'll cover the damages."

Truthfully, she could've fought liability. But having admitted fault, there was no taking it back now.

Nathan glanced away, pulling out his phone. "I'll bill you after repairs. Still using the same number?"

"No." The lie slipped out before she could stop it.

He dialed right in front of her. The automated "number unavailable" message made his jaw clench.

Evelyn's pulse jumped. Having the man she'd blocked standing two feet away was... uncomfortable.

"Just give me a figure now." She grabbed her phone, desperate to end this encounter.

"Repairs first." Nathan's tone turned flinty. "Leave me a working number."

His sudden intensity made her pause. This wasn't about money - he wanted her to unblock him.

"Contact my assistant," she countered.

Nathan pocketed his phone with finality. "Forget it then. Consider it a gift."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. Was he trying to paint her as irresponsible? Or worse - imply she couldn't pay?

Fine. She'd play his game. For now.

"My number's unchanged." She turned the ignition, eager to leave.

Nathan didn't move.

After two tense seconds, he suddenly leaned in, one hand gripping her steering wheel. His long fingers looked sculpted for piano keys.

Evelyn froze at his unexpected proximity.

"Evelyn," his deep voice rumbled dangerously close, "you wouldn't drive off and conveniently forget, would you?"

She inhaled sharply, irritation flashing in her eyes.

"Unlike some, I honor my debts." Snatching her phone, she unblocked his number and called him immediately.

The screen lit up with her old contact name: "Mrs. Blackwood."
###Chapter 171 As Long as You Both Remarry

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at Nathan Blackwood, her gaze inadvertently catching the caller ID flashing on his phone.

Her breath hitched as if she'd been struck by an invisible force.

A sharp pain spread through her chest. Without waiting for Nathan's response, Evelyn turned away sharply, pressing the accelerator and speeding off.

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. She let out a bitter laugh.

Missus?

That's what he still called her?

She had been his wife once—but not anymore. That title no longer belonged to her.

Nathan watched Evelyn's car disappear into the distance before looking down at his phone.

Missus.

The memories from before their divorce surged forward, vivid and relentless.

A dull ache settled in his chest, as if an unseen hand were squeezing his heart. His breathing grew heavier.

He had taken her love for granted.

Now, he had to fight to win her back.

Karma, indeed.

His phone buzzed again—Sophia Blackwood, his sister.

"Brother, Grandfather wants you back at the estate immediately."

"Got it."

Nathan hung up before she could say more. He exhaled sharply, trying to push away the suffocating weight in his chest.

It didn’t help.

Sophia scowled at her phone. She had hoped to gloat, but Nathan had cut her off.

He had given up his shares in Celestial Media—handing control to Evelyn.

Old Master Blackwood had been furious, nearly collapsing from rage. Sophia had already endured his wrath for failing to apologize to Evelyn properly.

Now that his anger had shifted to Nathan, she could finally breathe.

When Nathan's car pulled into the Blackwood estate, the tension in the air was palpable.

The butler greeted him the moment he stepped inside. "Young Master, the Old Master is waiting in the study."

Nathan nodded and ascended the stairs without a word.

The second he reached the study door, a teacup shattered against the wall beside him.

Nathan sidestepped, his expression cold.

"You dare show your face here?!" Old Master Blackwood's voice boomed from within.

The room was thick with tension.

"What's this about?" Nathan asked flatly.

Old Master Blackwood's jaw clenched. "You handed over your Celestial Media shares to Evelyn Sinclair just because she wanted to deal with Cassandra Delacroix? Since when do you obey her so blindly?"

His grandfather had always prided himself on Nathan's business acumen.

But lately, Blackwood Corporation's reputation had suffered—especially online. With Evelyn needing their help, this was the perfect opportunity to negotiate.

Yet Nathan had thrown it away.

How could the old man not be furious?

Nathan remained indifferent. "There was nothing to negotiate. We owe her. It was the right thing to do."

His voice was icy. "Besides, Celestial Media has been hemorrhaging money. Holding onto those shares was pointless."

He had no interest in cleaning up their mess.

If Evelyn wanted the company, she could have it.

Old Master Blackwood's anger faltered slightly at Nathan's reasoning.

If that was the case… perhaps it wasn’t entirely foolish.

His expression softened marginally. "Floyd—William Sterling—won’t forgive us easily. But an outright war benefits no one. He’s holding back—for now."

He leaned forward. "But this can’t continue. I have a solution."

Nathan frowned.

The old man continued, "In terms of family, talent, and capability, you and Evelyn are perfectly matched."

"If she hadn’t hidden her identity when she married you before, William Sterling’s daughter would have been your wife."

Nathan’s head snapped up, already anticipating what was coming.

Old Master Blackwood met his gaze squarely. "She loved you once. She can love you again. You just need to put in the effort."

His voice turned commanding.

"As long as you both remarry, everything will be resolved."

A union between Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Corporation would be unstoppable.

The perfect alliance.

The ideal outcome.

Nathan’s expression darkened. He lifted his eyes to his grandfather.

"She won’t agree to a marriage of convenience."

Especially not with me.
###Chapter 172 Marry Another Person

If Evelyn Sinclair had ever considered a marriage of convenience, she wouldn't have hidden her true identity all these years. What she sought was far more than just a contractual union.

Old Master Blackwood scoffed bitterly. "Would you stand by and watch her marry someone else? Think of what our family stands to lose!" His wrinkled fingers tightened around his cane. "There's no better match for Evelyn than you, Nathan."

No matter who Evelyn chose in the future, the Blackwood name would become a laughingstock. The damage to their reputation would be irreparable.

Though Old Master Blackwood didn't particularly like Evelyn, he couldn't ignore the immense power and influence of the Sterling family behind her.

Nathan's expression darkened at his grandfather's words. The mere thought of Evelyn with another man made his jaw clench involuntarily. He'd never allowed himself to consider that possibility.

Even with countless suitors surrounding Evelyn, Nathan had always assumed she wouldn't seriously entertain any of them. But what if she did? The thought sent an unfamiliar pang through his chest.

"Unacceptable," Nathan growled through gritted teeth.

Old Master Blackwood studied his grandson with piercing eyes. "If Evelyn refuses to reconcile with you, we must arrange another advantageous marriage. Someone from a family that can rival the Sterlings."

Only then could they counter the Sterling family's growing influence. Nathan's entire body tensed, his knuckles turning white with suppressed anger.

The suggestion filled him with visceral disgust. His gaze turned glacial as he met his grandfather's stare. "I don't need an arranged marriage."

"This isn't your decision to make—"

"I'll handle my affairs with the Sterlings myself." Nathan cut him off sharply, already turning toward the door. His relationship with Evelyn was complicated enough without introducing another woman into the mix.

Sophia Blackwood waited downstairs, anticipating fireworks. But after the initial sound of shattering glass, the study had fallen eerily quiet.

She jumped when Nathan suddenly appeared at the staircase. "Brother! That witch Evelyn is nothing but trouble," Sophia blurted. "She's the reason grandfather's angry, isn't she? You shouldn't—"

Nathan's dangerous glare silenced her mid-sentence. "How many times must I warn you, Sophia? Stay away from Evelyn." His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Apparently my warnings mean nothing to you."

Sophia paled, shrinking back against the wall. "I-I didn't—"

"Did you ever apologize like I ordered?" Nathan's question hung in the air like a guillotine.

Sophia's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.

One last withering look from Nathan sealed her fate. "One more transgression against Evelyn, and you'll find yourself disowned." The threat left no room for negotiation.

As Nathan strode out of Aspen Lodge, Sophia remained frozen, a cold sweat breaking across her brow.

Inside his car, Nathan replayed his grandfather's words. The image of Evelyn in another man's arms made his stomach churn. An invisible weight pressed against his chest, making each breath feel labored.

Before he realized what he was doing, his fingers had dialed Evelyn's number. The word "Wife" still displayed on his screen—a relic from happier times. To his relief, the call connected. She hadn't blocked him again.

That small mercy eased some of the tension in his shoulders.

Evelyn answered after three rings, her voice thick with sleep. "Hello?"

No trace of their usual animosity colored her tone. For a fleeting moment, it felt like old times.

"It's me," Nathan said quietly.

The change was instantaneous. Evelyn's voice turned to ice. "Have you calculated the repair costs? Just tell me how much I owe you." Her eagerness to sever all ties cut deeper than he expected.

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "Wrong number," he lied smoothly. "My apologies."

He heard her sharp intake of breath before she hissed, "You absolute lunatic!" The line went dead.

Nathan stared at his phone, an unexpected chuckle escaping his lips. Only Evelyn could hang up on him and leave him smiling.

The mighty CEO of Blackwood Corporation, reduced to finding amusement in being dismissed by a woman. The business world would never believe it.
###Chapter 173 Make It Happen.

Morning light streamed through Evelyn's penthouse windows as she prepared for work.

With Kingsley Tech's project running smoothly, she turned her attention to a new real estate venture.

Checking social media, she found netizens divided between shipping her with Lucas Sterling or Julian Moreau.

A minority paired her with Nathan, trailing far behind.

Evelyn laughed. "At least the public knows Nathan and I don't belong together!"

Bennett hesitated. "Should we remove these posts?"

"No harm in letting them play," Evelyn said. "It's not like I'll date whoever wins this silly poll."

She couldn't possibly date Lucas - revealing their sibling relationship would cause chaos!

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises...

Harrison watched incredulously as his boss obsessed over gossip during work hours.

Nathan scowled at the polls. "How do these nobodies rank higher than me? The public's taste is trash!"

He slammed his tablet down.

Harrison ventured, "Should we remove this nonsense?"

Nathan's glare could kill. "Ensure Blackwood's reputation isn't eclipsed by those amateurs. Understood?"

Harrison blinked. "You want... to boost your pairing with Ms. Sinclair?"

Nathan signed a document without looking up. "Make it happen."

Within hours, the "Nathan-Evelyn" pairing skyrocketed past the others.

In Evelyn's group chat:

[Isabella Montgomery: Insider says Blackwood bought those trending spots! Is Nathan insane?]
[Natalie Beaumont: Wow... just wow...]
[Sebastian Hart: Why isn't MY name there??]

[Evelyn Sinclair: He's definitely lost it.]

Evelyn immediately called Bennett. "Take it down. Double whatever Nathan paid."

The polls vanished instantly.

When informed, Nathan simply said, "Good."
###Chapter 174 Make Another Appointment

Evelyn Sinclair had a mountain of work piling up on her desk.

The Pacific Heights Project was hitting unexpected roadblocks.

Maxwell Thornton, their primary developer, had suddenly backed out of their agreed-upon price at the eleventh hour.

He demanded a 30% increase on top of their original deal. Naturally, Evelyn refused. This project was Sterling Corporation’s crown jewel in real estate—failure wasn’t an option.

Her negotiation team returned empty-handed. Maxwell remained stubborn, unwilling to budge.

Every day of delay cost Sterling Corp millions. With Alexander Sterling overseas for inspections, the burden fell squarely on Evelyn’s shoulders.

Flipping through past meeting notes, Evelyn frowned. Something didn’t add up.

Why the sudden shift in attitude?

Bennett, standing nearby, cleared his throat. "I did some digging."

"Apparently, someone approached Maxwell—promised him better deals and higher commissions."

"He’s using this as leverage to squeeze more out of us."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled. "Who?"

Bennett shook his head. "He’s keeping that close to his chest."

Finding another developer overseas would be costly and time-consuming. They were stuck dealing with Maxwell.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Set up a meeting."

She wouldn’t let anyone manipulate her.

Bennett nodded. "Right away."

Maxwell accepted the invitation almost instantly—as if he’d been waiting for it.

Evelyn arrived precisely on time. Maxwell, however, strolled in fifteen minutes late.

Her patience was already thin. His smug smirk as he apologized only made it worse.

"Apologies, Ms. Sterling. Got held up."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a cold smile. "Since you’re so busy, Mr. Thornton, we’ll reschedule."

She rose, signaling Bennett to follow.

Maxwell’s confidence faltered. He scrambled to stop her. "Wait—let’s talk properly. My fault for being late."

Evelyn paused, her gaze icy.

"Let’s be clear, Mr. Thornton. Sterling Corp won’t meet your demands. We value integrity. Without it, there’s no partnership."

Maxwell’s expression darkened. He leaned forward, dropping his trump card.

"Another investor offered 30% more. Match it, and I’ll stick with you."

He expected her to cave. Women, in his experience, folded under pressure.

Evelyn merely laughed.

"Then by all means, take their offer. Best of luck."

She turned on her heel.

If this mystery investor truly existed, why was Maxwell still negotiating? Evelyn wasn’t buying it.

But she was curious who was pulling his strings.

At the door, she glanced at Bennett. "Follow him."

An hour later, her phone buzzed.

Bennett’s voice was tense. "President, Maxwell just met with Reginald Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood at the Aurora Club."

Silence.

Then—

"Interesting."
###Chapter 175 Hollywood Heartthrob

After a brief pause, Evelyn's composed voice responded through the phone, "Understood."

"Do something for me. Sinclair Group isn't the powerhouse it once was."

Their golden era had passed, leaving them barely clinging to relevance. Yet despite their decline, they still commanded respect and remained superior to many competitors.

Evelyn never imagined Nathan Blackwood's mysterious backer would be Sinclair Group. So Preston Sinclair was involved after all.

That evening, Natalie extended an invitation to an exclusive gala, which Evelyn accepted as promised.

In a somber mood, Evelyn perched at the bar, nursing her drink in solitude.

Her striking beauty made invisibility impossible - those endless legs, that willowy waist, every movement like poetry in motion.

No one noticed the discreet photo snapped and sent to a particular recipient. When Nathan checked his buzzing phone, Tristan's name flashed on the screen.

He answered impatiently. "What now?" Tristan chuckled. "I told you to come tonight, but you refused. Guess who's here?" His teasing tone only fueled Nathan's irritation. "Spit it out."

Tristan sighed dramatically. "No sense of fun. Check your messages." Nathan hung up and opened the image.

Evelyn sat bathed in golden light, nearly merging with the glow. The photo's dreamy quality lent an ethereal aura. Her crossed legs formed perfect angles as she absently swirled her wineglass, those delicate features lethally alluring.

Regal yet untouchable, she radiated intoxicating magnetism without even trying. Nathan's jaw tightened as he grabbed his jacket and left.

Slightly buzzed, Evelyn decided to depart. Until an unfamiliar voice called out nearby.

She froze mid-step and glanced sideways.

No recognition. She continued walking. The stranger stormed over, furious. "Evelyn Sinclair! Are you ignoring me?"

Evelyn assessed the woman - all arrogance and mediocre looks. A faint smirk played on her lips. "Should I know you?"

The dismissal ignited the woman's temper. "I'm Yuna Takahashi, heiress to Takashi Holdings. I just debuted in Montecito's entertainment scene! Over 300,000 fans already!"

Montecito's entertainment industry proved far more lucrative than Korea's, prompting Yuna's career shift. She'd skyrocketed after a talent show breakthrough.

Yuna had heard about Evelyn from Penelope Sinclair, whose family's business ties with Takashi Holdings forged their friendship.

When Penelope learned of Yuna's celebrity aspirations, she'd eagerly facilitated introductions to influential directors, promising industry access.

Most enticingly, Penelope vowed to introduce Yuna to Lucas Sterling - not just Montecito's darling, but Korea's beloved idol. Yuna had specifically debuted here to get closer to him.

Yet upon arrival, she discovered Lucas entangled with this divorcee. Deciding to teach Evelyn a lesson would simultaneously please Penelope.

Evelyn studied Yuna with genuine confusion. "Never heard of you." Though fluent in English, Yuna might as well have been speaking another language for all Evelyn cared.

"How dare you!" Yuna's lip trembled with humiliation. She forced composure. "Ms. Sterling, given your... reputation, it's understandable you wouldn't know me."

"But let me make one thing clear-"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Few dared address her this way. This rookie had audacity.

"Oh?"

"I don't care about your family's wealth or your... appetites. But keep Lucas Sterling out of your messy life. You're beneath him."

So this was about Lucas? Evelyn frowned. "Not your concern."

"Who says it's not? He's disgusted by women like you!" Evelyn's light laugh held no warmth. "Did he tell you that himself?"

"Obviously! He's only tolerating you because of that ridiculous shipping nonsense." Yuna's teeth ground together. "If you had any decency, you'd deny those scandalous rumors instead of leeching off his fame!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "Is that so? I'll have to verify that." She pulled out her phone. "Lucas, I'm drunk. Pick me up. And bring flats." She hung up without waiting.

Yuna sneered. "Pathetic act. You didn't even dial, did you? As if Lucas Sterling comes running at your beck and call! Know your place!"
###Chapter 176 Wealth and Influence

Evelyn Sinclair cast a disdainful glance at Yuna Takahashi, her patience wearing dangerously thin.

"How irritating! Yuna, what exactly are you two discussing?" A woman approached from nearby.

Dressed in an opulent designer gown, she carried herself with practiced elegance. The professional smile plastered across her face looked painfully artificial. Evelyn studied her features, a faint frown creasing her brow. There was something vaguely familiar about her.

Yuna snorted coldly before linking arms with the newcomer. With a smug tilt of her chin, she announced, "Evelyn, surely you recognize her? This is Penelope Sinclair, daughter of Sinclair Group's chairman and the award-winning Hollywood actress!"

Recognition flickered in Evelyn's eyes.

Ah yes. That overrated celebrity who clawed her way to fame through reality TV and carefully crafted public image rather than actual acting talent. But Evelyn's attention snagged on the more relevant detail.

Daughter of Sinclair Group's chairman? The alcohol haze cleared from Evelyn's mind instantly.

So that's her other identity.

"Hello, Ms. Sterling," Penelope offered a saccharine smile, extending her hand.

Evelyn gave a curt nod, making no move to shake it. Her mood had soured considerably, and social niceties held no appeal at the moment.

Besides, anyone chummy with Yuna couldn't be worth knowing. Evelyn's lips curled slightly.

"Big movie star, hm?"

Penelope smoothly withdrew her unshaken hand, maintaining her composure. "Ms. Sterling, please don't mind her. Yuna's recently arrived from Korea as the heiress to Takashi Holdings. She's still adjusting to Montecito's social scene." She turned to Yuna with an indulgent smile. "No need to announce my background everywhere. I prefer people judge me on my own merits."

Yuna gazed at Penelope with starry-eyed admiration before shooting Evelyn a venomous glare. "Of course Penelope's different from some people. She's just too honest sometimes - means no harm by it."

Evelyn's cold laugh sliced through the air. "Being honest doesn't excuse poor manners. And it certainly doesn't indicate good intentions."

What a blindly devoted fool, Evelyn thought. The real malice here clearly came from Penelope.

Yuna's recent arrival explained her ignorance about Evelyn's background. But Penelope? She knew exactly who Evelyn was. The omission to her dear friend was undoubtedly deliberate.

Yuna's face flushed with anger, eager to wipe the smirk off Evelyn's face. "Why so arrogant, Evelyn? Penelope isn't just an actress - she's Nathan Blackwood's childhood sweetheart. Sinclair Group will soon merge with Blackwood Enterprises through their marriage alliance. You don't stand a chance!"

"We're not formally engaged yet," Penelope demurred, though her coy glance at Evelyn confirmed the truth of Yuna's words.

"Marriage alliance?" Evelyn's lips twitched with amusement. Now their boldness made sense. No wonder Bennett had spotted Maxwell Thornton with Sinclair Group's chairman and Nathan earlier.

"It's practically confirmed anyway," Yuna sneered. "Blackwood Enterprises dominates the industry while your family owns what? Some insignificant company? You're hardly worthy of Nathan Blackwood. But Penelope will soon be Mrs. Blackwood. Then we'll see who dares cross her!"

She lifted her chin, waiting for Evelyn's reaction. "I know you've been buying those trending topics to boost your image. Do you really think you're so special? Shamelessly pairing yourself with Mr. Blackwood and Lucas. The audacity!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously just as Natalie Beaumont arrived.

"Which bitch reeks of desperation here?" Natalie's blunt words made both women pale. They recognized the fashion mogul instantly - offending her would be career suicide. Even Yuna knew no Korean celebrity had ever secured an invite to Natalie's exclusive shows.

"Ms. Beaumont, this is all a misunderstanding—" Penelope began.

"So she's your bitch?" Natalie cut her off. "Keep her on a leash then!"

"She's foreign, still learning our customs—"

"A foreign bitch? Then train her better!" Natalie snapped. "Teach her some manners first."

Penelope floundered, unwilling to risk her polished image by defending Yuna too vigorously. The cost outweighed any loyalty.

Yuna's face burned crimson, ready to retort when she spotted movement in the crowd.

Lucas! Her jaw dropped. His sculpted features seemed divinely crafted. He approached with casual elegance, his gaze fixed solely on Evelyn.

"My lady, how much have you had to drink?" Lucas ignored everyone else. His eyes dropped to her heels, concern flickering across his face as he knelt before her.

From his bag, he produced the latest Lumière sneakers, gently cradling Evelyn's ankle to change her shoes in full view of the stunned onlookers.

Yuna's face drained of color.

How could Lucas Sterling - international superstar - debase himself like this for Evelyn?

Evelyn caught Yuna's shocked expression. "Lucas," she said lightly, "I hear you've been badmouthing me?"

"Hmm?" Lucas remained focused on his task, as if nothing mattered more than ensuring her comfort. He carefully smoothed the fabric around her heel to prevent any friction before finally satisfied.

The intimate scene unfolded before dozens of watching eyes - including Nathan Blackwood's, who had just arrived, his expression darkening at the sight.
###Chapter 177 You're His Mistress

Tristan Whitmore scoffed silently. Evelyn Sinclair truly had no idea the storm she was stirring, did she? Since her divorce from Nathan, she'd become completely unrestrained.

Before Evelyn could respond, Yuna Takahashi stepped forward aggressively. Her eyes burned with misplaced righteousness as she confronted Lucas Sterling.

"Lucas, you need to tell everyone the truth right now. Did Evelyn force you into this? Is she blackmailing you?" Yuna's voice trembled as she spat out the next words. "Are you...her kept man? Is that why you're always by her side?"

She continued passionately, "Don't be afraid! Just admit it and we'll help you. We'll get you away from Evelyn's clutches!" The way Yuna spoke made Evelyn sound like some kind of predatory monster.

Lucas' posture went rigid. A dangerous smirk curled his lips as he rose to his full height, his gaze scorching as it landed on Yuna.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" His voice was glacial. "Are you mentally ill? If so, go home and take your medication. Don't bring your delusions here."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, exchanging an amused glance with Natalie Beaumont. Both women were thoroughly enjoying this rare spectacle - seeing the normally composed Lucas lose his temper.

Being called a male mistress? That was the ultimate insult to Lucas Sterling. Yuna visibly deflated under her idol's scathing words, her earlier bravado completely evaporated.

Penelope Sinclair quickly pulled Yuna back, offering an apologetic smile. "Lucas, please don't be angry. Yuna's new to Montecito's social scene. She's just concerned about you."

Lucas' cold gaze shifted to Penelope. "And you are...?" Penelope's face froze. The humiliation burned - she'd won film awards, considered herself an A-list celebrity, yet this international superstar didn't even recognize her.

The implication was clear: her work wasn't memorable enough to warrant Lucas' attention. She paled in comparison to his global fame.

Penelope had intended to use Yuna to knock Evelyn down a peg, but instead found herself dragged into the mud. Her cheeks burned as she desperately scanned the crowd, her eyes landing on the imposing figure of Nathan Blackwood.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Penelope brightened, stepping toward him like he was her salvation. "You're here!"

Tristan nudged Nathan, noting his thunderous expression. "You know Penelope Sinclair?" The question drew everyone's attention to Nathan.

His response was icy. "No." His gaze didn't linger on Penelope for even a second, remaining fixed on Evelyn's radiant face instead.

Evelyn shone like the sun - her beauty effortless, her poise regal. She commanded attention wherever she went. The so-called superstar Penelope couldn't hold a candle to her in any aspect.

Seeing how Evelyn had blossomed since their divorce stirred complicated, unpleasant emotions in Nathan's chest.

The awkward silence stretched until Evelyn finally broke it with an amused chuckle. "Mr. Blackwood, you don't even recognize your own fiancée? How interesting." She cast a meaningful look at Penelope. "After all the bragging she and Yuna did earlier, denying it now would just make them look foolish."

Lucas couldn't resist adding fuel to the fire. "Ah, so that explains the audacity. Mr. Blackwood's fiancée, is it?" His tone dripped with sarcasm.

Nathan's expression darkened. "What fiancée?" His deep voice cut through the room. "Since when do I have a fiancée I know nothing about?"

All eyes turned to Penelope. Would a celebrity of her stature lie about something like this? She stood frozen, humiliation washing over her in waves.

Her father had been negotiating a marriage alliance with the Blackwoods, and the families had grown closer recently. She'd assumed the arrangement was mutual, had even fantasized about the status boost marrying Nathan would bring.

Never had she imagined Nathan himself would be completely unaware.

Nathan strode forward, his intense gaze never leaving Evelyn. "Evelyn," his voice was dangerously low, "since when do I have a fiancée? And more importantly - what exactly is your relationship with Lucas?"

The easy camaraderie between Evelyn and Lucas, the way Lucas doted on her - it all grated on Nathan's nerves.

Evelyn's cool gaze swept from Nathan to Penelope and Yuna, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "You'll have to ask Ms. Sinclair and her dear friend about that."
###Chapter 178 You Got Dumped

Evelyn was still reeling from Lucas's sudden outburst, her mind struggling to catch up.

When Natalie spoke, she blinked, dazed.

All eyes were on her.

The silence was suffocating, thick with tension. Even someone oblivious would sense something was off.

"Penelope told me about their engagement. She even showed me a photo of her father with Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said, turning to Penelope for support.

But Penelope only glanced at Nathan Blackwood, who remained silent, unmoved.

He didn’t intervene as Natalie questioned her in front of everyone.

This wasn’t a room full of gossip reporters.

Their judgmental stares were humiliation enough.

Penelope bit her lip, scrambling for an excuse.

"Maybe it was just a misunderstanding between our families. A joke taken too seriously. Please don’t think much of it, Ms. Montgomery and Mr. Blackwood."

Lucas scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain.

"So, it was all a lie? People really have the audacity to fake engagements now? Standards for liars have truly plummeted."

Penelope paled.

As a public figure, this scandal could ruin her. Before she could defend herself, Natalie yawned.

Lucas immediately took her purse, slinging an arm around her shoulders.

"Let’s go home. These people aren’t worth our time."

Natalie nodded, glancing at Isabella.

"Coming?"

"Obviously." Isabella grabbed her things, following them out.

Once they left, Penelope rushed to Nathan, desperation in her voice.

"Mr. Blackwood, I only mentioned the engagement because my family brought it up. I was waiting for confirmation—"

Nathan cut her off coldly.

"There is no engagement. Don’t delude yourself."

His words were a bucket of ice water, dousing her fantasies.

It would never happen.

Penelope’s face drained of color as Nathan strode after Evelyn without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!"

Penelope clenched her fists, forcing a laugh.

"Honestly, I’m relieved. My career is booming—directors are lining up for me. The engagement pressure was suffocating. Now I don’t have to worry about offending Mr. Blackwood."

Tristan smirked at her pathetic attempt to save face but said nothing, turning to leave.

Nathan caught up just as Evelyn slid into Lucas’s passenger seat.

"I’ll take you home," he said stiffly, glaring at Lucas.

Evelyn didn’t even look at him.

"No need."

"I want to discuss the car repairs," Nathan pressed.

Evelyn rested her head against the window, the cool breeze clearing her mind.

"Just send me the bill. I’ll buy you a new one."

That would end this ridiculous back-and-forth.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"I don’t want a new car. I want that one fixed."

Evelyn laughed dryly.

"Then name your price."

Nathan hesitated.

Once he did, he’d have no reason to see her again.

Lucas honked impatiently, smirking.

"Mr. Blackwood, you got dumped. Stop making a scene."

Nathan’s gaze turned glacial.

He hadn’t forgotten finding Lucas half-naked in Evelyn’s apartment. The memory burned.

"Stay out of this, Lucas," he warned, voice dangerously low.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"Just email me the invoice."

She turned to Lucas.

"Drive."

Lucas winked.

"Your wish is my command."

They sped off, leaving Nathan standing in the cold.
###Chapter 179 The Defamed One

The car ride was uncomfortably silent until Natalie finally spoke up. "Lil N, Nathan Blackwood's behavior was rather peculiar today, don't you think?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, recalling Nathan's words to Dominic Kingsley that night. "You think he has feelings for me? Please."

"How else would Penelope Sinclair dare claim to be Nathan's fiancée? That marriage alliance rumor didn't come from nowhere," Natalie frowned, twisting her designer bracelet nervously.

"But would the Blackwoods really need an alliance with Sinclair Group?"

"Who cares," Lucas muttered darkly. After dropping Natalie off, he drove Evelyn back to Sterling Manor.

The next morning, Evelyn was jolted awake by raised voices downstairs. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she descended to find William Sterling berating Lucas with enough volume to shake the chandeliers.

"You absolute disgrace! Even Leo has more sense than you! Look what you've dragged your sister into!" William thrust the morning paper at them.

The headline screamed: Lucas Sterling - Evelyn's Secret Toyboy! Scandalous Affair Between CEO and Star Actor! Hollywood Royalty's Shocking Fall From Grace!

Alexander's expression was murderous. "See what happens when you insist on this acting nonsense? No one would care about you if not for your ridiculous career!"

Lucas slumped on the sofa, pounding the armrest dramatically. "Father dearest, I'm the victim here! Why am I being scolded when I'm the one being slandered?"

"You involved your sister in your mess and dare talk back?" William's glare could have frozen lava.

Evelyn sighed. "At this point, the fastest way to end this is to publicly confirm Lucas's real identity."

William grimaced. "But he bought those acting awards! The embarrassment—"

Evelyn and Lucas exchanged exasperated looks. "I earned those awards through talent!" Lucas wanted to scream. The revelation of his place in the Sterling hierarchy stung - revered by the public, yet considered a family disgrace.

Meanwhile at Celestial Media, Yuna Takahashi watched the growing scandal with increasing anxiety. She'd only wanted to tarnish Evelyn's reputation and drive Lucas away from her.

"Penelope, what if this backfires on Lucas? I never meant—"

Penelope patted her hand reassuringly. "The media outlet is ours. They'll focus on Evelyn, not Lucas. We're saving him from that gold-digger's clutches."

They'd leaked photos of Lucas kneeling to fasten Evelyn's shoes at last week's gala - a humiliating image that sparked outrage.

[How dare she treat our Lucas like a servant!]
[Who does Evelyn Sinclair think she is? The Queen of England?]
[At least our Julian Moreau has self-respect!]

But Penelope's triumph lasted barely two hours before Sterling Corporation dropped their bombshell statement:

Lucas Sterling is the eldest son of William Sterling and brother to CEO Evelyn Sterling. Any suggestion of impropriety between them is false and defamatory.

Evelyn shared the announcement with the caption: Proud of my superstar brother! Lucas instantly reposted: Proud of my genius CEO sister!

The internet exploded. Servers crashed under the weight of shocked reactions:

[Lucas Sterling is a Sterling heir?! Mind blown!]
[This sibling duo is everything! #FamilyGoals]
[The Sterlings have it all - Alexander the business titan, Lucas the A-list actor, Evelyn the tech genius. How do I get reborn into this family?]
[So brothers can't help sisters with shoes now? Get a life, haters!]
[Ship officially sunk. Julian Moreau stans, assemble!]
[The way the Sterling brothers support Evelyn's leadership? Obsessed with this power family!]
###Chapter 180 I Can't Get Arrested

Blackwood Enterprises.

Nathan Blackwood stared at the trending gossip online, his brows knitted tightly together.

Even Harrison hadn't anticipated this twist.

Logically, Nathan should have been pleased—one less rival in the game. Yet, Harrison detected no trace of satisfaction on his boss's face.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

"I should have seen this coming. Lucas never had any scandals in the entertainment industry before. The only person he ever showed public affection toward was Evelyn."

His lips curled into a bitter smirk.

"Turns out Lucas is also William Sterling's son. If Evelyn and I hadn't divorced, he would've been my brother-in-law. What a surprise."

The realization eased some of the tension in his chest.

But then he remembered how coldly he had treated Lucas yesterday.

A pang of regret struck him.

If Harrison could read Nathan's thoughts, he would have choked on his coffee.

Nathan's voice dropped to an icy timbre. "What else?"

"Reginald Sinclair, Chairman of Sinclair Group, is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

"Let him in."

Harrison nodded and stepped out to escort the visitor in.

Despite being older than Nathan, Reginald Sinclair carried himself with cautious deference in the younger man's presence.

"Nathan, I came to discuss the Pacific Heights Project. Have you reconsidered?"

Securing that project would guarantee Sinclair Group's profits for an entire year.

Nathan remained impassive. "I've done my research. Sterling Corporation has been eyeing it for months."

A sly smile spread across Reginald's face as he adjusted his tie.

"Nathan, if you're willing to collaborate, I can guarantee we'll secure it. Consider it done. You won’t need to lift a finger."

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Where does this confidence come from, Mr. Sinclair?"

Reginald hesitated. Clearly, Nathan wouldn’t bite without proof.

"I approached Maxwell Thornton, the developer behind this project. Sterling Corporation has been working with him, but I made him an offer he couldn’t refuse."

His eyes gleamed with triumph.

"Once Thornton pulls out, Sterling Corporation will have no choice but to abandon the project—or sell it at a loss."

He leaned forward, voice dripping with persuasion.

"Alexander Sterling is overseas. A woman like Evelyn won’t be able to hold Sterling Corporation together. This is your chance to strike back."

His tone turned venomous.

"Don’t forget how merciless she was when she dismantled your family’s reputation. Now’s the time to reclaim what’s yours."

The air around Nathan turned glacial.

Mistaking his silence for consideration, Reginald pressed on.

"If our companies join forces, no one else stands a chance."

He smirked.

"I believe Old Master Blackwood has already mentioned the marriage alliance—"

"Mr. Sinclair."

Nathan's voice cut through like a blade.

Reginald froze.

"You should know by now that whatever Old Master Blackwood says holds no weight with me."

The sheer disdain in Nathan's tone sent a chill down Reginald’s spine.

The ruthless authority in Nathan’s gaze left no room for argument. The fact that he openly dismissed his own grandfather’s influence in front of Reginald spoke volumes.

"The Blackwood family doesn’t need marriage alliances to survive."

Nathan’s words were laced with ice.

"I married Evelyn when she had nothing. The next matron of the Blackwood family will be whomever I choose."

His lips curled in contempt.

"And it will never be Penelope Sinclair."

Each syllable was a death knell to Reginald’s ambitions.

Old Master Blackwood had praised Penelope multiple times in Reginald’s presence, leading him to believe the alliance was all but guaranteed.

Now, Nathan had shattered that illusion with brutal clarity.

"Blackwood Enterprises will not be involved in the Pacific Heights Project. Proceed with your plans without us."

Nathan’s dismissal was final.

Reginald had expected to leave with a deal. Instead, he walked out empty-handed.

"Mr. Sinclair, this way." Harrison gestured politely.

Reginald’s face was taut with barely concealed frustration.

The moment he stepped outside, his phone rang.

"Dad!" Penelope’s panicked voice crackled through. "Sterling Corporation is suing me! You have to help—!"
###Chapter 181 Winning Is All That Matters

Reginald Sinclair's face twisted in shock.
What the hell?
I just... I only spread a minor rumor about Evelyn and Lucas online.

I never expected them to involve the authorities!
Father, fix this! Suppress the story!
Penelope can't be arrested—she's a star!

But Penelope Sinclair had already confessed everything.
She never anticipated Evelyn's ruthlessness.
Or that Lucas Sterling was Evelyn's brother.

Now she'd truly stirred up a hornet's nest.
Reginald's mind reeled in chaos.

Panic seized him.
He spun around, desperate to seek Nathan Blackwood's intervention.

Harrison blocked his path with a polite but firm hand.
"Mr. Sinclair, the CEO is in an international conference call."
His tone brooked no argument.

Defeated, Reginald stormed out.
He dialed Maxwell Thornton en route to Sterling Tower.

At this point, hiding their collusion no longer mattered.
He'd surrender the Pacific Heights Project if it meant freeing Penelope.

Yet when he arrived, Evelyn refused to see him.
Furious, Reginald paced Sterling Tower's lobby like a caged animal.

Maxwell looked bewildered.
"Thirty percent additional profits—we're just walking away?"

"Shut your mouth!"

They waited until dusk.
Finally, Evelyn emerged with Bennett at her side.

Reginald lunged forward.
"Ms. Sterling!"

She turned, cool as winter frost.
Though they'd never met, she recognized Maxwell instantly.

"Ah, Mr. Thornton."
Her gaze flicked to Reginald.
"Let me guess—HS Group's Chairman Sinclair?"

Reginald stiffened.
Her razor-sharp deduction unnerved him.
Suddenly, his bargaining position felt flimsy.

"Ms. Sterling, Penelope is my only child."
His voice cracked.
"She's a public figure—an arrest would ruin her."

Evelyn's lips curved like a honed blade.
"Then perhaps you should've taught your daughter consequences."
"Celebrities should exemplify integrity, don't you think?"

This scandal would end Penelope's career.
Brand her forever.

Evelyn couldn't care less.

"Wait!" Reginald begged.
"I'll withdraw from Pacific Heights entirely!"
"Send the developers back—original terms stand!"

Her laugh was glacial.
"Are you implying I should thank you for not sabotaging my project?"

Reginald straightened his tie with false dignity.
"The business world is brutal, Ms. Sterling."
"Victory justifies all means."

Evelyn's smile turned lethal.
"Exactly."
"Which is why I'm holding you both accountable."

Maxwell paled.
Reginald gaped.

"Did you truly believe," Evelyn purred, "this project hinged on Maxwell?"
"His deputy has coveted his position for years."

She let the revelation hang between them.
"The man gladly offered me a ten percent discount."

Reginald's knees nearly buckled.
Maxwell looked ready to vomit.

Evelyn tilted her head.
"Brutal world, isn't it, gentlemen?"
"Winning really is everything."

Bennett already held the car door open.
As Evelyn slid inside, Maxwell clawed at the window.

"Twenty percent discount! No—thirty!"
He'd work for free if she demanded it.

But the tinted window rose without hesitation.
The engine purred to life.

Evelyn didn't glance back.
Fools should've considered consequences before crossing her.
###Chapter 182 She Bought You a Present

The scandal surrounding Penelope Sinclair exploded across social media within hours.

No one could believe the usually poised A-list actress would stoop to such desperate measures.

What infuriated the public most was how Penelope had tried manipulating them. The backlash was brutal.

Netizens reveled in her downfall as sponsorships evaporated overnight. Breach of contract penalties piled up.

With no way to salvage her reputation, Penelope had no choice but to issue a public apology.

She posted a tearful video announcing her retirement from Hollywood to focus on the Sinclair family business.

The internet immediately dug into her privileged upbringing, uncovering more scandals. Evelyn was surprised by how quickly Penelope folded.

It was a smart tactical retreat - preserving some dignity before completely burning her fanbase. Meanwhile, Sebastian Hart's birthday approached.

Every year, Natalie and Isabella would compete to find the most extravagant gift for the dashing bachelor. Evelyn never stressed - Sebastian adored anything from her.

Isabella dragged Evelyn through Montecito's luxury district, though she spent more time shopping for herself than gift hunting.

After having her purchases delivered, Isabella resumed her half-hearted search while Evelyn spotted something perfect.

A rare Patek Philippe caught her eye - outrageously expensive yet understatedly elegant. Perfect for Sebastian's refined tastes.

Fate intervened when they bumped into Sophia Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore in the boutique. The awkward tension was palpable.

"Evelyn, fancy seeing you here," Tristan offered nervously. Ever since his humiliating apology, he'd been walking on eggshells around her.

"Obviously," Isabella scoffed. She enjoyed watching Tristan squirm, knowing Evelyn still held compromising photos over him.

Sophia crossed her arms, her face twisting in displeasure at the sight of Evelyn. "What are you doing here?"

"Is this boutique suddenly Blackwood property?" Isabella shot back. Evelyn ignored them, pointing to the watch.

"I'll take this one." She didn't even glance at the price tag.

"Wait! That's ours!" Sophia blurted. Tristan tried silencing her but it was too late.

"First come, first served, Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, her piercing gaze making Sophia shrink back.

Sophia's eyes narrowed as realization struck. "Are you... buying a birthday gift for my brother?" The air grew thick with tension.

Tristan's head snapped up. Of course - the timing made perfect sense. Why else would Evelyn be shopping for men's watches?

Evelyn froze momentarily. The mention reminded her that Nathan and Sebastian's birthdays were consecutive. Had she really only remembered Sebastian's?

A satisfied smirk tugged at her lips.

Sophia took this as confirmation and seized the opportunity to taunt her. "Don't waste your time. Nathan won't invite you to his party. Just hand it over."

Tristan yanked Sophia back. "Shut up!" Previous years Nathan might have excluded Evelyn, but this year was different.

Evelyn turned slowly, her icy smile sending chills down Sophia's spine. "You want it? That's exactly why I'm buying it. Because I despise you."

With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she handed over her black card. Isabella smirked at Sophia's outrage.

"Don't embarrass yourself, Sophia. Why would Evelyn waste time buying gifts for Nathan Blackwood?"

As they left, Sophia was still fuming. That Patek Philippe was Montecito's last available piece, snatched away by Evelyn.

Tristan immediately called Nathan from a corner. "Blackwood! Guess what? Evelyn just bought your birthday present!"

The phone nearly slipped from Nathan's suddenly unsteady hands. This changed everything.
###Chapter 183 The Ring She Gave Him

"It's absolutely true!" Sophia Blackwood couldn't contain her excitement. "Evelyn purchased that exact Patek Philippe you've been eyeing. Just wait for your surprise, Nathan!" Tristan Whitmore burst into laughter as he shared the news with Nathan Blackwood.

The revelation sent an unexpected jolt through Nathan's system. He struggled to maintain his composure, forcing down the sudden warmth spreading through his chest.

His voice dropped an octave as he responded, "Fine. I'm ending this call." Nathan hadn't planned any birthday celebrations this year.

Yet now, an extravagant party seemed necessary - if only to secure Evelyn's presence. Previous birthdays had been quiet affairs with only his closest friends.

Memories surfaced of Evelyn's hopeful expressions before their divorce, her subtle hints about celebrating together. He'd always brushed her off, preferring distance between them.

Still, she'd never missed giving him gifts. The realization made Nathan abruptly call Harrison. "Where are my past birthday presents?" The sudden demand startled his assistant.

"Sir, the valuable ones are in the safe or displayed in your collection room." Panic gripped Nathan as he realized he couldn't recall any of Evelyn's gifts from their three years together.

"Specifically Evelyn's." Harrison hesitated before cautiously asking, "Which year are you referring to, sir?"

"All of them." Nathan's tone turned glacial.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously before delivering the blows. "First year, Ms. Sinclair gifted you a custom ring, but...you misplaced it." His voice dropped to a whisper.

Nathan's face drained of color. A sharp pain lanced through his chest as the memory resurfaced. He'd never bothered with wedding rings, considering them unnecessary formalities.

Yet Evelyn had bought matching sets. He'd worn his for two days before carelessly stuffing it into a jacket pocket. Then it vanished.

Harrison continued hastily, "Second year, she handmade you a cashmere scarf, but you gave it to Vanessa Holloway, who discarded it immediately."

Before Nathan could process this, Harrison delivered the final blow. "Third year...she gave you nothing." The silence stretched unbearably.

Nathan felt like his ribs were cracking. The weight of his past indifference crushed him. He'd systematically destroyed her affection until she stopped trying altogether.

The lost ring. The discarded scarf. Things that meant nothing then now left him gasping for air. He couldn't bear to examine this wound further.

Flinging his phone aside, Nathan stormed into his walk-in closet like a man possessed. He tore through every jacket, searching pockets with desperate precision. Soon, an avalanche of designer clothing buried him.

The search proved futile. Years-old garments wouldn't remain in rotation. Housekeeping would have found any jewelry during regular cleanings.

The realization of his past neglect carved a hollow space beneath his sternum. That ring - Evelyn must have chosen it with such hope, such vulnerability.

And he'd lost it without a second thought.

Later, Nathan emerged from the wreckage and dialed Evelyn's number. Each ring sent his pulse skyrocketing.

"How much for the repairs?" Evelyn's curt greeting offered no pleasantries.

Nathan's heart threatened to break his ribs, yet his voice remained steady. "Evelyn, my birthday's tomorrow. You're coming to the party."

This marked the first time he'd personally invited anyone to his birthday. The silence stretched unbearably.

Then Evelyn's bitter laugh crackled through the line. "Mr. Blackwood, have you forgotten? We're not friends."
###Chapter 184 The Missing Date

Evelyn ended the call abruptly, leaving Nathan speechless.

That was her final answer. Why should his birthday matter to her? Nathan's chest tightened painfully.

Yet when he remembered Tristan's words about Evelyn purchasing a gift for him, hope flickered in his heart.

Perhaps she would come after all.

The thought lifted his spirits considerably. Evelyn had slept soundly despite Nathan's late-night call.

The rhythmic patter of rain had lulled her to sleep. Morning brought lingering clouds and crisp air as Evelyn stepped onto her balcony, inhaling deeply.

Her phone rang - Sebastian Hart calling. She answered immediately. "Happy birthday, Sebastian! May fortune favor you all your days!"

His laughter echoed through the line. "Little E, are you blessing your grandfather now?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Consider yourself lucky it's your birthday, or I'd have taught you some manners."

Switching to speakerphone, she began dressing. She selected a couture gown with iridescent gray-blue pearls, its limited-edition status evident in every stitch.

The mirror reflected effortless elegance. Strappy stilettos completed the look, elevating her regal presence.

"My Queen," Sebastian's voice teased through the phone, "what treasure have you procured for me? I've lost sleep wondering."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What are you lacking?"

"A girlfriend," he replied smoothly, his intention transparent. "I intend to court you properly."

"Denied," Evelyn stated flatly.

"My heart doesn't require permission," Sebastian countered. "This love flows through my veins and-"

Click. Evelyn terminated the call without hesitation. "Insufferable," she muttered, gathering her things for work.

Bennett arranged the morning meeting files on her desk, hesitating before speaking. "President Sinclair..."

"Yes?"

"Blackwood Enterprises sent an invitation... for Mr. Blackwood's birthday celebration." Bennett's voice dwindled to a whisper.

He couldn't fathom Nathan's audacity in expecting Evelyn's attendance. Their current relationship barely qualified as civil.

After a beat of silence, Evelyn's lips curved. "The man's delusional. Ignore it. Why should I grace his birthday? The arrogance!" Bennett exhaled in relief.

This reaction aligned perfectly with expectations. He crafted a polite refusal for Harrison, who delivered the message with visible discomfort.

"President, Ms. Sinclair's assistant conveyed Sterling Corporation's birthday wishes. There's... an urgent overseas project requiring her immediate attention. She's already departed."

Harrison paused, impressed despite himself. Evelyn's excuse was masterful.

"Understood." Nathan's voice dropped an octave, the words laced with quiet anguish. The rejection stung more than anticipated.

Of course she wouldn't come. Hadn't she made that clear yesterday? They weren't even acquaintances anymore.

Evening found Nathan brooding in a private club's corner while Tristan and friends transformed the venue into a celebration.

"Nothing but the best for President Blackwood!" The crowd's enthusiasm contrasted sharply with Nathan's mood. He nursed his drink, isolated amidst the revelry.

Tristan approached, clinking glasses. "Happy birthday, Nate." Nathan drained his glass without meeting his friend's gaze.

His eyes held oceanic depths of sorrow. "She's not coming." The words emerged frostbitten.

Tristan scrambled for reassurance, draping an arm around Nathan's shoulders. "She's probably just being cautious. Given your... complicated history."

"Maybe she'll send the gift tomorrow." Tristan felt certain of his theory.

Evelyn's past devotion suggested she'd know Nathan's preference for Patek Philippe watches. That expensive timepiece must be intended for him.

"Wait - is that Evelyn?" A voice cut through the chatter.
###Chapter 185 Salary Cut

Tristan and Nathan immediately rose from their seats when they heard the commotion. The grand entrance remained conspicuously empty.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Tristan snapped at the messenger of false news. The man who'd shouted earlier flinched visibly.

Under Nathan's glacial stare, he forced a nervous smile and fumbled for his phone. "My friend just sent me footage of Evelyn playing poker. She's winning big—"

His words were cut short as Nathan snatched the device.

The video showed a lavish gathering around a high-stakes poker table. Instead of chips, the surface glittered with luxury car keys, diamond bracelets, and solid gold ingots. The intensity of the game was palpable.

This spectacle made Nathan's birthday gala seem dull by comparison. Every participant wore designer labels, but Evelyn in her custom gray-blue pearl-encrusted gown outshone them all.

She commanded the room effortlessly. Sebastian Hart and Natalie Beaumont flanked her like devoted attendants feeding cards to a queen. Evelyn herself simply sat there, radiant with triumph.

"Location," Nathan demanded, his voice arctic.

"The new Velvet Lounge," the man stammered.

Nathan's breathing turned ragged. So she hadn't left the country. No urgent business. She'd chosen poker over his birthday celebration.

Just then, Harrison happened to walk by. Nathan's gaze locked onto him like a predator sighting prey.

He tossed the phone back carelessly. "Consider your annual bonus revoked."

Harrison blinked in confusion. While the birthday festivities continued merrily without its host, no one understood why Nathan had stormed out. Unable to contain his fury, he drove straight to the Velvet Lounge.

By the time he arrived, Evelyn's party had already departed. Nathan returned to his car, his chest tight with unnamed emotions. The cigarette between his fingers burned steadily in the darkness, its ashes scattering like his composure.

Midnight brought countless birthday messages flooding his phone. None bore Evelyn's name.

Mr. Archibald knew Master Blackwood owned over twenty luxury vehicles. "Sir, is this new Porsche not the latest model? Has my father become frugal?"

The butler chuckled diplomatically. "Not at all. Young Master Lucas insisted no staff should drive the same model as him, so I selected this classic edition."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Since when do you take orders from him? Lucas always acts so childish!"

Mr. Archibald merely smiled, opening the car door with practiced grace. "Your carriage awaits, Miss Sterling."

The butler also carried gifts from William Sterling for the Hart family. Upon arrival, they found the manor swarming with celebrities and socialites, its understated elegance screaming wealth.

Evelyn caught her breath. This exceeded normal birthday party proportions. "It's just a birthday. Why is Sebastian making such a production?"

Mr. Archibald exited to open her door. "I believe Chairman Hart intends to use this occasion to find Second Young Master Hart a suitable match."

"Ah." Understanding dawned on Evelyn's face.

"Nikki!" Natalie waved energetically. Evelyn spotted her instantly and moved forward with a smile.

"Where is everyone?"

"Inside. I came out to fetch you." After bidding Mr. Archibald farewell, Evelyn linked arms with Natalie.

They'd barely taken three steps when a honeyed voice stopped them cold. "How fashionable, Ms. Sterling. Though your escorts do seem to be aging poorly."

Evelyn turned to see Yuna Takahashi, accompanied by that insufferable Penelope Sinclair from last time.

"Hmph."
###Chapter 186 She's Performing

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ms. Takahashi?"

Yuna Takahashi lifted her chin arrogantly. "How surprising you remember me, Ms. Sinclair. I heard marriage alliances here only happen between families of equal status."

She smirked. "Was that wealthy businessman just now your match? Though he's not particularly handsome and rather old, I suppose he must be filthy rich."

"Otherwise, how could someone of his... caliber possibly match someone as refined as you, Ms. Sinclair?" Yuna hadn't been following the latest Montecito gossip online.

She remained blissfully unaware of Lucas's true identity. Penelope Sinclair had only called Yuna to complain about Evelyn's retaliation, prompting Yuna's angry confrontation.

Natalie moved to intervene but Evelyn stopped her with a subtle gesture. Evelyn's icy gaze locked onto Yuna. "Don't assume your foreign status protects you."

"Stay away from me. The sound of your voice makes me physically ill." Yuna's face twisted in outrage.

Humiliated, she brandished her phone in Evelyn's face. "I'll simply have someone trace that car's owner to expose your sugar daddy's identity."

"I recognize it's a classic Porsche worth about $10 million. My father drives the same model." Yuna sneered. "I'm sure everyone would love to know about Ms. Sinclair's marital arrangements, wouldn't they?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile. "Are you attempting to blackmail me with this?"

Yuna mistook Evelyn's calm for fear. "Hmph! Just drop the charges against Penelope. She's kind-hearted - how could you destroy her acting career? You're utterly vicious!"

"She made her choices," Evelyn replied coolly. "No one forced her to commit those despicable acts."

Her dismissive glance made Yuna bristle. "Ms. Takahashi, you should worry about yourself." Evelyn turned to leave.

Yuna grabbed her arm. "Withdraw the lawsuit or I'll post those photos online! Everyone will know you're sleeping with some old man for money!" Nearby guests pricked up their ears.

Evelyn paused, her eyes glacial. Yuna flinched under her gaze. "Go ahead, Ms. Takahashi," Evelyn challenged.

"My butler isn't bothered by rumors. With four companies and a dozen luxury cars, he can handle whatever nonsense you spread."

Yuna froze. "A butler?!" The man who drove the same car as her father, owned multiple businesses, was merely a Sterling family employee?

The eavesdropping guests reevaluated Evelyn's status. Someone who casually spent $800 million in an afternoon wouldn't marry some random businessman. The Sterlings practically printed money! Yuna clearly understood nothing about true wealth.

"W-what does your family actually do?" Yuna stammered. "I thought it was just some small company! You have staff this wealthy?!"

Natalie suppressed a laugh. "Ms. Takahashi, since you're so close to Penelope, didn't she warn you about the Sterlings? How... disappointing for your friendship."

Evelyn gave Yuna a pitying look. "If you're so concerned about Penelope, why waste energy threatening me?"

"Why not take her place in prison? I'm sure she'd appreciate such loyalty." Evelyn's tone dripped with sarcasm.

Yuna paled. Their words filled her with sudden dread. Had Penelope lied to her? Her lips trembled.

Before she could respond, the Hart family butler arrived. "Ms. Sinclair! Master Reginald was just saying Mr. Sterling's gift is too extravagant for young Sebastian."

"The old man seems quite taken with it himself though." The butler's words shattered Yuna's remaining doubts.

So the "wealthy businessman" was merely Evelyn's servant. Her attempt to humiliate Evelyn had spectacularly backfired.

"That gift is for Reginald Hart. My father simply used Lucas as delivery boy," Evelyn clarified.

"Ms. Sinclair, Ms. Beaumont, this way please." The butler bowed respectfully.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly addressed Yuna. "Why are you here anyway?" As a newly debuted K-pop star, Yuna hardly qualified for Montecito high society.

Yuna blanched. The butler answered first. "Ah, she's here to perform. Her agency promised something... exotic."

"If you'd prefer different entertainment, we can replace her immediately." Yuna's agency had secured this prime opportunity - performing for Montecito's elite at the Hart gala.

Penelope had arranged this chance for Yuna to mingle with potential benefactors. But confronting Evelyn had been a catastrophic miscalculation.

Evelyn waved dismissively. "No need. Ms. Takahashi should be backstage preparing."

She fixed Yuna with a final glare. "Though performers who threaten guests with blackmail rarely get second bookings, do they?"
###Chapter 187 A Symphony of Chaos

The crowd gasped collectively. Evelyn wasn't the only one at risk here - every guest in attendance could become a target.

This was the Hart family's prestigious event. Any scandal would reflect poorly on their reputation.

The Hart family butler's expression turned stony. He snapped his fingers at two security personnel. "Escort her backstage immediately. Performers have no business mingling with guests."

Evelyn exchanged knowing glances with Natalie before following the butler inside. They paid their respects to Reginald Hart first before searching for their host.

Sebastian Hart was drowning in admirers when he spotted Evelyn. His face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Ah! The goddess has graced us with her presence! Now you peasants can see what real beauty looks like."

His friends groaned at his theatrics but fell silent when they saw Evelyn approaching.

She wore an emerald gown that made her glow like moonlight on water. Her chestnut waves cascaded effortlessly over bare shoulders.

Even in this sea of elites, Evelyn commanded attention effortlessly. Hearing the wolf whistles, she rolled her eyes and turned away.

Sebastian broke through the crowd like a man possessed. "Did Aphrodite herself descend from Olympus tonight?" Natalie fake-gagged and made her escape.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow dangerously. "Keep talking and I'll demonstrate how goddesses smite mortals."

Sebastian leaned in with a roguish grin. "But I only speak divine truths." His fingers playfully tugged at her dress sash.

Evelyn swatted him away, though to outside observers, their banter resembled lovers' teasing. Across the ballroom, a pair of stormy gray eyes tracked the emerald-clad figure.

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Tristan Whitmore wisely kept silent. The woman who supposedly had urgent business overseas - the same woman Nathan Blackwood had waited for all night - now glittered at Sebastian Hart's birthday gala.

Two parties. Twelve hours apart. Polar opposite atmospheres. The slap to Nathan's pride couldn't be louder if she'd physically struck him.

Tristan cleared his throat. "The Harts really go all out for birthdays, don't they? Almost vulgar with the extravagance."

For someone of Nathan's stature, merely attending was honor enough. That he'd come at all shocked Tristan.

Nathan's gaze remained fixed across the room. "Curiosity," he murmured. "Wondering who'd lower themselves to attend this circus."

Tristan nearly choked on his champagne.

Curiosity about whether Evelyn would show, more like. Since their divorce, she'd appeared with frustrating frequency. Suddenly, the stage erupted with pulsing music.

Spotlights crisscrossed as performers took the stage. The bass thumped through marble floors, drawing every eye.

The event planners knew their audience - the younger elite crowd ate up these pop performances.

Evelyn and Sebastian stood nearest the stage. The lead performer's face made Evelyn's breath catch - Yuna Takahashi, the Korean pop princess.

Yuna gyrated with manufactured sensuality, mimicking popular dance moves. Her stage persona bore zero resemblance to the vicious woman Evelyn knew.

"Fans actually buy this act?" Evelyn muttered as the decibel level climbed. She accepted a flute of champagne from a passing waiter.

Before she could comment further, warm hands covered her ears. Sebastian's breath tickled her neck. "This noise pollution isn't worthy of your ears, goddess."
###Chapter 188 Where Did You Find This Fool?

Evelyn instinctively glanced upward. Sebastian's words drew an involuntary chuckle from her lips. Two figures on the balcony observed the exchange with keen interest.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. He set down his crystal tumbler with deliberate force and descended the grand staircase without hesitation. "Tristan! Control yourself!" Harrison called out urgently.

What else could explain Nathan's sudden movement? As fate would have it, the evening's musical performance chose that moment to conclude. The musicians took their bows to enthusiastic applause from the assembled guests.

Most performers exited stage left, but Yuna remained center stage.

Spotting Evelyn across the room, the Korean pop star flashed a calculated smile. Isabella immediately moved closer to her friend. "Is she planning something?" Evelyn merely shrugged with practiced nonchalance.

"If she's begging for humiliation, who are we to deny her?" Isabella arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, reassured by Evelyn's composure. On stage, Yuna addressed the crowd. "Good evening everyone. I'm Yuna Takahashi, and I'm deeply honored to perform for Mr. Hart's birthday celebration."

Polite applause followed as Sebastian raised his glass in acknowledgment. The atmosphere remained cordial but restrained.

When silence returned, Yuna continued, "If I may be so bold, I'd like to invite Ms. Sterling to join me on stage."

"Ms. Sterling, would you honor us with a musical performance for our esteemed host?" Malice dripped from every syllable.

Yuna's resentment burned bright. So what if Evelyn came from money? The Takahashi family owned half of Seoul! Why should she kowtow to some American heiress? And the way Lucas Sterling doted on his sister... it made her sick.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile as she regarded the scheming performer.

What gave this glorified karaoke singer the audacity to make such a request? Did she think Evelyn would embarrass herself? Or perhaps she expected a refusal that would make Evelyn appear arrogant?

Sebastian's pleasant expression froze. He gestured sharply to his butler. "Where the hell did you find this idiot?" The poor man turned ashen, sweat beading on his forehead.

If only he'd vetted the entertainment more thoroughly! Yuna pressed on. "Ms. Sterling, is performing beneath you? Or perhaps..." She feigned sudden realization. "Do you not play at all?"

Her mocking tone carried perfectly across the room. The faux sympathy in her eyes couldn't mask the glee dancing in their depths.

Sebastian muttered a curse. "Evelyn, ignore her-" He moved to intervene, but Evelyn caught his wrist.

Her sidelong glance at the stage would have frozen lava. After a quiet chuckle, she sipped her champagne and handed the flute to a passing waiter.

With effortless grace, she gathered her couture gown and ascended the stage. Under the brilliant lights, Evelyn's presence reduced Yuna to little more than a poorly dressed stagehand.

Evelyn stood bathed in spotlight, her flawless skin glowing with an almost ethereal radiance. The transformation from society heiress to celestial being was complete.

Yuna stiffened, mouth opening to speak, but Evelyn smoothly plucked the microphone from her grasp. The move was executed with elegant finality.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over her rival. "You may leave now."

And with those words, Yuna Takahashi's career ended. Without another glance, Evelyn turned to the audience with a slight bow before gliding toward the grand piano.

A hushed anticipation fell over the crowd. No one had ever witnessed Evelyn Sterling perform publicly. Beyond the carefully curated press releases from Sterling Corporation, she remained an enigma.

Evelyn settled at the piano bench, her posture regal. When her fingers touched the keys, the opening notes of a reimagined Canon in D filled the hall.

Gasps rippled through the audience. Her interpretation blended technical perfection with raw emotion - not merely a rendition, but a revelation. The music became an extension of her soul, revealing resilience, passion, and quiet strength.

It was artistry of the highest order.

Evelyn at the piano became a living masterpiece, so captivating that time seemed suspended. The entire ballroom held its breath, unwilling to break the spell.

As the final notes faded, Evelyn rose with a knowing smile toward Isabella, who immediately produced an exquisitely wrapped gift. Sebastian's gaze held such tender admiration it could have melted diamonds.

Evelyn accepted the velvet box and revealed a Patek Philippe timepiece that caught the light with every glittering diamond. "The music was for everyone. This," she said, holding the watch toward Sebastian, "is just for you."

Her words still hung in the air when a strong hand closed around her wrist. Evelyn...
###Chapter 189 The Ache of Longing

"Mr. Blackwood, what do you think you're doing?" Sebastian Hart snapped, his voice dripping with irritation as Nathan had just shattered what should have been a perfect romantic moment.

Who did Nathan Blackwood think he was? Sebastian wouldn't back down so easily. But Nathan paid him no attention, his intense gaze locked solely on Evelyn with a darkness that could swallow the room whole.

The Patek Philippe watch in Evelyn's hand glimmered under the lights, but Nathan had never despised an object more. At that moment, he wanted to gather every watch from that brand in his collection and toss them all into the nearest dumpster.

Evelyn's delicate fingers twisted away from Nathan's grasp. Her frosty eyes met his. "Is there something you need, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's jaw clenched so tightly it ached. He opened his mouth to speak—

But Evelyn cut him off. "Whatever you have to say, save it for later." Her voice was like ice. "This is Sebastian's birthday celebration. Surely you don't intend to make a scene?"

With deliberate care, she fastened the luxury watch around Sebastian's wrist. A satisfied smile played on her lips. "Happy birthday, Sebastian."

Sebastian made a show of admiring his new timepiece, twisting his arm ostentatiously to ensure Nathan couldn't miss it. "Thank you, Evelyn. This is the most meaningful gift I've ever received—something I'll treasure forever." His gaze burned with undisguised adoration.

Evelyn caught her breath. The warmth in Sebastian's eyes was overwhelming—so tender, so full of promise. Yet she couldn't ignore the other presence beside her, the one radiating cold fury that pressed against her skin like a physical weight.

Nathan's thoughts raged. She played piano for him. Celebrated his birthday. Gave him gifts. None of it was meant for me. The pain was visceral, like someone had reached into his chest and twisted his heart. Memories that should have been his alone were being stolen away.

The agony was unbearable.

After a beat, Evelyn lowered her lashes and chuckled lightly. She teased Sebastian, "That model should appreciate in value. Don't go losing it."

Natalie Beaumont observed the tense standoff. Nathan remained rooted in place, his unblinking stare fixed on Evelyn like a predator. What an absolute fool.

"Natalie to the rescue," she muttered, swooping in to extract Evelyn from the uncomfortable situation. "Evelyn! I've lost my clutch—help me find it!" She grabbed her friend's arm.

Evelyn seized the lifeline gratefully. "You and your misplaced belongings," she chided as they hurried away.

Nathan watched until Evelyn disappeared into the crowd before finally turning away. Sebastian smirked. "She clearly doesn't want anything to do with you, Blackwood. Take the hint."

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet. Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If you value your party remaining intact, Hart, you'll stay out of my way."

The threat hung heavy between them. Nathan hadn't come for this ridiculous celebration. Sebastian wasn't worth his time.

Tristan Whitmore materialized to diffuse the tension. With practiced ease, he steered Sebastian away. "Happy birthday, mate! Let's get you another drink."

Once Sebastian was safely occupied, Tristan returned to Nathan's side. Following his friend's line of sight, Tristan grinned. "Admiring the view?"

Nathan ignored him.

Tristan wasn't deterred. Years of friendship meant he could read Nathan like an open book. "Missing your ex-wife, are we?" he teased.

Nathan's behavior was telling. This wasn't just regret—it was jealousy, pure and simple. The usually composed CEO of Blackwood Enterprises had nearly lost his composure over a birthday gift.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Tristan," he said through gritted teeth, "I haven't even begun to settle accounts with you." His voice was deadly calm. "Who swore Evelyn had a gift for me? Who guaranteed she'd attend my birthday? My birthday was one day before Hart's, yet everything—the piano, the watch—was for him. Because of you and your empty promises, I actually let myself hope."

The last word was a snarl. Hope had only made the disappointment cut deeper. Damn it all to hell.
###Chapter 190 When Innocence Becomes Folly

Tristan's smile froze on his face. His lips twitched nervously. "Well... I didn't exactly anticipate this outcome either," he muttered under his breath.

In his mind, he cursed Sophia for putting such ridiculous ideas in his head. That woman had completely misled him with her wild assumptions.

He never imagined Evelyn could be this ruthless. The entire spectacle had been a deliberate humiliation directed at Nathan.

Meanwhile, the two women strolled backstage, their laughter echoing through the corridors. Natalie and Evelyn casually selected a dressing room, pushing the door open without hesitation.

Their entrance coincided with someone exiting after changing. It was Yuna Takahashi.

The Korean pop star stiffened visibly upon seeing Evelyn. After a brief hesitation, she approached with calculated steps, her expression unreadable.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Yuna's manicured fingers tightened around her designer bag as she forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her crimson lips curving into a knowing smirk. She'd been expecting this confrontation.

Natalie shifted subtly closer to her friend, her protective instincts kicking in. The dressing room suddenly felt too small for all their conflicting emotions.

Yuna's gaze flickered between the two women, her carefully constructed mask beginning to slip. "We need to talk," she said through gritted teeth.

The demand hung in the air like a challenge. Evelyn's smirk widened, her confidence unshaken. "By all means," she purred, gesturing toward the plush seating area. "Let's have our little chat."

Evelyn was just about to speak when the Hart family's head butler entered with two imposing bodyguards. The butler's gaze landed on Evelyn, and he immediately bowed in deference.

"Ms. Sterling, please forgive the interruption. There's a small matter requiring my attention. It won't take but a moment."

Evelyn exchanged glances with Natalie before nodding. "By all means."

With a curt nod to the bodyguards, the butler signaled them forward. They seized Yuna Takahashi's arms without ceremony, dragging the struggling pop star toward the exit.

"What is this? There must be some mistake!" Yuna's voice trembled. She knew the Hart family's reputation in Montecito - crossing them meant career suicide.

The thought of returning to Korea in disgrace made her stomach churn.

"Ms. Takahashi," the butler said icily, "you've violated the terms of your contract. We're obligated to return you to your agency and terminate our agreement immediately. Your management will be contacted regarding penalty fees."

Yuna's eyes darted to Evelyn, realization dawning. "You!" she gasped. "Evelyn Sinclair, this is your doing!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, letting out a dry chuckle. "Quite the performance for someone who's not even an actress. Who else would bother with you?"

She took a deliberate step forward, arms crossed. The cold amusement in her eyes sent chills down Yuna's spine.

"Naivety becomes stupidity when taken too far, darling." Evelyn's lips curled as she pulled out her phone and dialed Dominic Young right before Yuna's widening eyes.

"Dominic? It's Evelyn. Find out which agency represents Yuna Takahashi. Effective immediately, I want her blacklisted from every red carpet, magazine cover, and film set. Make her disappear from the industry."

The reply came without hesitation. "Consider it done, Ms. Sterling. Yuna Takahashi will be erased from show business by sundown."

Yuna's knees buckled. Dominic Young could bury careers with a snap of his fingers - and just had.

Evelyn tilted her head, voice crisp as winter air. "Just so we're clear - that little stunt earlier? Wasn't me."

She gestured to the bodyguards restraining Yuna. "This? This is me."

The unspoken message hung between them: Evelyn Sinclair didn't make empty threats, and she certainly didn't need to hide her actions.

"Didn't Penelope Sinclair mention her family's Sinclair Group is on the verge of collapse?" Evelyn continued conversationally. "My Sterling Corporation is acquiring them as we speak. Pity you won't be around Montecito to see it happen."

Yuna turned ghostly pale. The Sinclair Group dwarfed her family's Takashi Holdings in Korea. Yet Evelyn spoke of acquiring it like ordering coffee.

A terrifying thought struck Yuna - if Evelyn could dismantle Korea's corporate giants so easily, what would stop her from coming after Takashi Holdings next?

Penelope had set her up. Used her as a pawn against this terrifying woman. The realization left Yuna shaking.

Evelyn's light laugh drew her attention. "Pathetic, really. Being someone else's sacrificial lamb." She turned away dismissively. "Though I can't say you don't deserve it."

The butler stepped forward, voice devoid of emotion. "We'll settle the Hart family's accounts separately. Remove her."

The bodyguards complied immediately. Yuna didn't resist - too paralyzed by visions of her future: banned from Montecito, drowning in debt, her name synonymous with scandal back home. This disgrace would haunt her forever.

Natalie smirked as Yuna was led away. "Another fool who didn't learn from Penelope's mistakes."

Her expression shifted as she turned to Evelyn. "Speaking of fools... what's with Nathan Blackwood lately?"

Evelyn shrugged, brow furrowing. "Your guess is as good as mine. Something's off about him." She suddenly straightened. "Oh! I still owe him for those car repairs!"
###Chapter 191 The Missing Heirloom

Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont returned to the grand ballroom. The crowd had resumed their mingling, laughter and champagne flowing freely.

The earlier confrontation might as well have never happened.

Now that Evelyn's true identity was known, no one dared pressure her into drinking. Polite smiles and distant pleasantries were exchanged, but everyone kept a respectful distance.

Exhaustion crept in. Evelyn slipped away to a secluded balcony, craving solitude. The night air was crisp, the city lights shimmering like scattered diamonds across the bay.

A delicate floral scent drifted from the gardens below. Just as she began to relax, footsteps interrupted her peace.

"Evelyn? What are you doing out here?"

Tristan Whitmore's voice made her shoulders tense. Her tranquil expression hardened into icy disdain.

"Do I require your permission to exist in a space, Tristan? Unless you'd like to explain why you're stalking me?"

He winced but pressed on. "That's not— Look, about the watch... Why didn't you give it to Nathan? He waited all night at his birthday gala. The poor guy—"

A humorless laugh escaped her lips. "When did I ever say that watch was for Nathan Blackwood? Are you delusional? Did someone drop you on your head as a child?"

Her thoughts burned sharper. Tristan Whitmore, when will you people grasp reality? Why would I attend a stranger's party? Buy gifts for a man I despise? How much clearer must I be?

Tristan opened his mouth—then froze. His eyes widened at something behind Evelyn. Shock and dread flashed across his face. Oh hell.

"Hate?" The new voice turned Evelyn's blood to ice. She whirled to find Nathan emerging from the floor-length drapes beside her. How long had he been standing there?

His gaze was unreadable, voice deceptively calm. Evelyn forced herself not to flinch.

"I assumed my feelings were obvious, Mr. Blackwood. Clearly, you need everything spelled out." No point in pretense now.

Tristan coughed awkwardly and practically fled. This conversation was his personal nightmare.

Nathan's eyes never left Evelyn's profile. Each word from her lips was a fresh wound. Hate me? Of course she does. I've given her every reason.

The balcony was their private battleground now. No eavesdroppers would dare. Nathan's smile was bitter.

"Nothing I do will ever earn your forgiveness, will it?"

Evelyn studied him, unnerved by the sorrow in his eyes. A trick of the light. Nathan Blackwood doesn't mourn me.

"Mr. Blackwood, we'll never be friends. You're not seeking forgiveness for me—you're seeking absolution for yourself." Her laugh was arctic. "But why should I ease your conscience? If you're truly remorseful, you should suffer as I did. Did you think one apology could erase three years of hell?"

She wanted him broken. Wanted him to drown in regret. This wasn't some amicable separation—it was war.

Nathan's jaw clenched. The apology dying on his tongue tasted like ash. When he finally spoke, his voice was raw.

"Evelyn... I lost the ring. I'm so sorry." That ring was the first thread I pulled in unraveling your life.

The words hit like a physical blow. Evelyn's face went deathly pale before twisting into something vicious.

"Oh, I know." Her smile could have frozen the bay below. "You didn't lose it. You threw it away."
###Chapter 192 The Diamond Bits Are for You

Evelyn Sinclair thought bitterly, Nathan Blackwood is bringing up the lost ring just to twist the knife in my heart, isn't he?

How utterly cruel.

But after enduring so many emotional wounds, my heart had turned to stone.

Nathan's brows furrowed deeper. He opened his mouth to speak when Sebastian Hart came rushing over from across the room.

"My Goddess Evelyn!" The nickname made Evelyn's lips curve involuntarily. The painful memories Nathan had stirred suddenly seemed insignificant.

Not worth dwelling on past sorrows.

Sebastian slipped his arm around Evelyn's shoulders protectively, shooting Nathan a warning glare.

"We're one player short. Saved the spot just for you. Care to join us for a few rounds?"

Ten minutes ago, Evelyn might have agreed. Now, her mood had soured completely.

She forced a faint smile. "No, I'm rather tired. Think I'll head home."

"Let me drive you," Sebastian offered immediately.

Evelyn chuckled. "Don't be ridiculous. It's your birthday - you can't abandon your own party. Archibald will come get me."

"They're not as important as you!" Sebastian insisted, his eyes only for Evelyn.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly remembered something. Digging into her purse, she pulled out her checkbook and scribbled a figure.

The icy look in Nathan's eyes when she'd turned away softened slightly when she approached him again.

Evelyn shoved the check forcefully into Nathan's breast pocket. "Forty million. Enough for a new car. Now we're even."

Her smile was arctic. More than market value - no need for further complications.

She was sick of Nathan's deliberate provocations, especially after overhearing his conversation with Dominic Kingsley at Kingsley Tech that day.

Remorse? Please. Evelyn turned sharply on her heel.

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice stopped her. "Believe it or not, I didn't lose that ring on purpose."

His face looked gaunt, drained of color.

"As if I'd believe that," Evelyn muttered without turning back, striding away in her stilettos.

Her posture radiated icy detachment. Sebastian escorted her to the door, watching until Archibald's car disappeared.

Back at Sterling Manor, Archibald informed her, "The eldest young master has returned. The family is gathering as per the patriarch's instructions."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at the butler's awkward attempt at slang.

Leo came bounding toward her the moment she stepped inside. "Mama! I love you!"

Evelyn scooped up the AI tiger, running her fingers over its custom Hermès tiger-striped suit. "My, aren't you fancy today!"

The tailored faux fur outfit hugged Leo's form perfectly. Since when did her AI pet need haute couture?

Leo preened, tilting his head proudly. "Always cool, Mama!"

"Evelyn! You're home!" William Sterling descended the stairs, arms outstretched.

Giggling, Evelyn moved to hug him, only to be waved off.

"Not you!" William said sheepishly. "I want to hold little Leo!"

Evelyn's jaw dropped. Since when was she dethroned as Daddy's favorite?

William cradled Leo like a baby. "Grandpa will take you for walkies!"

Lucas Sterling snorted from the sofa. "Look who's been dethroned!"

Evelyn glared at him. "Still higher than you, bottom feeder!"

Alexander Sterling approached from the bar, nodding approvingly. "Excellent work on the Pacific Heights Project, little sister."

Evelyn tossed her hair proudly. "Naturally! Did you bring me a present?"

Alexander's expression remained stoic. "Diamonds. In your room."

"How many?"

"About two hundred top-grade whites. Uncut - design them as you wish."

Lucas piped up, "The perks of being rich, huh? Where's mine, big bro?"

Alexander rolled his eyes. "You get the leftover diamond bits."

Lucas looked scandalized. "Seriously? Why does everyone treat me like this?!"
###Chapter 193 The Face of the Brand

News spread like wildfire that Sterling Corporation was searching for a celebrity ambassador for their new men's accessories line. Every talent agency in the city scrambled to submit their top artists' portfolios.

Securing this endorsement deal meant everything. Sterling Corporation's reputation for excellence was unmatched in the industry. Being chosen would cement an artist's status as A-list.

Evelyn Sinclair flipped through stacks of headshots until her vision blurred. Beside her, Bennett tapped his pen thoughtfully against his notepad.

"President Sinclair," he said, lowering his voice. "Just received word from our contacts. Sinclair Group bailed Penelope Sinclair out this morning. They've quietly appointed her as Vice President."

He paused. "And Yuna Takahashi has been extradited back to Korea."

Evelyn didn't look up from the photos. "Bailed out?" Her lips curved slightly. The news about Yuna's extradition didn't surprise her - the Takahashi family had that kind of influence.

As for Penelope? Sinclair Group had deep pockets. And let's face it - tax evasion wasn't exactly murder. Evelyn snapped the portfolio shut.

"How's the acquisition progressing?" she asked.

Bennett's expression brightened. "Smooth sailing. We've severed their supply chain completely. At this rate, Sinclair Group will declare bankruptcy within three weeks unless they find new investors."

Evelyn's phone vibrated with an incoming call. Dominic Young's name flashed on the screen.

"President Sinclair," his smooth voice came through. "Heard you're in the market for an ambassador. Might I suggest someone?"

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted. Dominic rarely recommended talent. "Go on."

"Julian Moreau. Clean image, massive social media following. Since he's under my management now, I'd love to give the kid this opportunity. What do you think?"

The name triggered a memory. Julian had been caught in that media scandal with her months ago. Unlike others, he'd refused to capitalize on the situation or milk it for publicity.

Evelyn felt a twinge of guilt. The boy had integrity. "Done," she said without hesitation. Julian had been on her shortlist anyway.

Dominic chuckled. "Were you waiting for me to ask, Evelyn? Playing favorites, are we?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Dominic, with that imagination, you should be writing soap operas." She ended the call.

Turning to Bennett, she announced, "Julian Moreau gets the contract. Have legal draft the paperwork."

Bennett smirked. "The shipping community will lose their minds. Your pairing with him alone will sell out the collection."

Evelyn shot him a look.

Clearing his throat, Bennett added, "You should attend the press conference, President. Avoiding it would only fuel more speculation."

Evelyn nodded. She knew how these games were played.

Three days later, Sterling Corporation's official announcement sent the internet into meltdown. #EvelynAndJulian trended worldwide as fans dubbed themselves "Evians." When the campaign photos dropped - Julian modeling sleek silver cufflinks - pre-orders hit 200 million units in twenty-four hours, smashing all previous records.

Meanwhile, Sinclair Group unveiled their competing line of men's jewelry. Their ambassador? None other than Penelope Sinclair, squeezing every last drop from her fading celebrity status.

The audacious move? Booking the adjacent ballroom at The Grandeur Hotel for their launch event - same date, same time as Sterling's.

"President," Bennett fumed, "should we have the hotel cancel their reservation? This is blatant piggybacking."

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Let them play their little game." She checked her watch. "There's still thirty-six hours. Contact our specialist. She'll handle Penelope."

If Penelope wanted to play dirty in the business world, Evelyn would show her how it's really done.
###Chapter 194 Because She's Stunning

The following day at the press conference, Julian Moreau arrived at the venue to find the entrance swarmed with enthusiastic fans.

No prior announcement had been made about Evelyn Sinclair's attendance, making her unexpected appearance through the back door an electrifying surprise.

The moment she stepped into view, the crowd erupted in delighted cheers. Seeing Evelyn and Julian together in the same frame was enough to captivate everyone's attention.

Upon her entrance, both the designer and company representatives immediately rose to greet her. With a graceful smile, Evelyn settled into a quiet corner seat.

Yet despite her understated presence, all eyes remained fixed on Evelyn. The live broadcast of the event sent online platforms into a frenzy.

[CEO Evelyn is absolutely breathtaking! She should debut as an actress!]
[This pairing is visual perfection!]
[Finally secured that bracelet pre-order - what a battle!]

At Kingsley Tech headquarters, Nathan Blackwood watched the live press conference on his office's massive screen. The viewership numbers doubled the instant Evelyn appeared on camera.

The men's bracelet collection sold out within minutes of launch. On screen, Julian's face lit up with a radiant, boyish smile the moment he spotted Evelyn in the crowd.

Then came the provocative question from a reporter: "Julian, what do you admire most about Evelyn?"

The room fell silent. Even the company representatives held their breath. Only the relentless clicking of cameras filled the air as everyone awaited Julian's response.

All eyes darted between Julian and Evelyn's reaction. After a brief pause, Julian turned his gaze directly toward Evelyn, his smile never faltering.

"Because she's stunning." His answer was disarmingly simple, utterly sincere, and completely irrefutable. The tension in the room instantly dissolved into warm laughter.

Watching from his office, Nathan scoffed at the response. "How superficial," he muttered disdainfully.

His assistant Harrison quickly agreed, "Indeed, sir. Women prefer more substantive compliments."

But on screen, the camera captured Evelyn's reaction - her smile widened, her eyes sparkling with genuine pleasure at Julian's words. Harrison immediately regretted his comment as an icy chill seemed to fill the room.

The assistant froze, suddenly aware he'd stepped on dangerous ground. Would this misstep cost him his job?

As the designer concluded the press conference, crowds gathered at the exits hoping to catch another glimpse of the striking pair. Evelyn and Julian made for a breathtaking combination - her elegant poise perfectly complementing his youthful charm.

Julian carried himself with such natural grace beside Evelyn, his handsome features and radiant smile making him anything but overshadowed. Photographers scrambled to capture every moment of this perfect pairing.

But their exit was interrupted by another group's arrival - none other than Penelope Sinclair and her Sinclair Group entourage. Evelyn's smile took on a knowing edge.

Penelope had clearly come to ride their publicity wave, demonstrating her knack for capitalizing on public interest. Dressed in a sharp pantsuit, she'd fully embraced her new image as a business mogul rather than actress.

"What a coincidence!" Penelope announced brightly to the cameras. "We're also launching new products today."

Evelyn maintained her composed smile, neither engaging nor avoiding Penelope. Having no relationship with the woman, she saw no need for false camaraderie before the cameras.

Penelope continued her performance: "As fellow jewelry businesses, recognition from established leaders like Ms. Sterling means everything to us newcomers."

Evelyn barely restrained an eye roll at the audacity. Then, in a flash of movement, a figure emerged from the press scrum and delivered a stinging slap across Penelope's face.

"Penelope Sinclair! How dare you play the wealthy heiress while your family goes bankrupt?" The assailant was none other than Yuna Takahashi - arriving right on cue.
###Chapter 195 Not Good to Add Insult to Injury

Penelope Sinclair stumbled backward, her heels catching on the uneven pavement. She barely caught herself before falling, her face draining of color.

Before she could regain her balance, Yuna Takahashi lunged at her again, eyes blazing with fury.

"You used me to go after Evelyn Sinclair!" Yuna's voice was raw with betrayal. "Why didn't you tell me she was the Sterling heiress? The Sterlings own half the industry! My family spent years securing a deal with Sterling Corp in Seoul, and you ruined it—you ruined everything!"

The reporters swarmed closer, cameras flashing relentlessly. The live broadcast captured every humiliating second.

Penelope's carefully constructed image was crumbling in real time.

Security finally managed to drag Yuna away, but the damage was done. Penelope's designer dress was torn, her hair a tangled mess. Red scratches marred her porcelain skin.

The once-glamorous actress now looked like a cornered animal.

Panic clawed at her throat as she scanned the crowd. Every reporter's gaze felt like a knife.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

She was supposed to rise, not fall.

Her desperate glare landed on Evelyn, who stood calmly at the edge of the chaos, an amused smile playing on her lips.

A reporter shoved a microphone toward Evelyn. "Ms. Sterling, what's your response to Penelope Sinclair's actions?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning thoughtfulness. "Well..." She sighed, her tone dripping with false sympathy. "Even though Ms. Sinclair hired people to harm me and my brother, it wouldn't be right for me to... add insult to injury, would it?"

With that, she turned and walked away, her bodyguards clearing a path.

Penelope's jaw clenched.

Not good to add insult to injury?

The phrase echoed in the air, heavy with implication.

The last shred of public sympathy for Penelope evaporated instantly.

Evelyn slid into her car, unbothered. The online backlash was already being steered—she didn’t need to lift a finger.

Meanwhile, the evidence she'd handed over—proof that Reginald Sinclair had bribed Maxwell Thornton—sent shockwaves through Sinclair Group.

Stock prices plummeted.

Investigations opened.

And in less than two weeks, Sinclair Group was absorbed by Sterling Corp, reduced to nothing more than a subsidiary.

Penelope had no choice but to crawl back to acting—except no one would hire her.

At Sterling Manor, Evelyn lounged on the sofa, scrolling through a luxury shopping livestream.

She deserved this.

After everything, she definitely deserved this.

When "@RichBaby" appeared in the chat, the streamer nearly choked.

Evelyn smirked.

Leo, curled in her lap, watched the screen with far more interest than she did. His tiny tail flicked.

"I'm going to shower," Evelyn murmured, scratching behind his ears. "Buy whatever you want, okay?"

Leo purred, flashing his little fangs. "I will."

Just as Evelyn stood, the next item appeared on screen.

Her breath caught.

Two billion dollars.
###Chapter 196: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

The amount displayed on screen wasn't just substantial—it was astronomical. Who in their right mind would casually drop that kind of cash? The live chat exploded with reactions, yet no one dared place a bid.

This content is brought to you by N?velDrama.Org.

The string of zeros following the first digit left viewers dizzy. When the streamer announced the item—a private tropical island named Panther Cay, valued at two billion dollars—silence fell.

Who even buys an island online? Clearly, the streamer had used it as clickbait to boost viewership.

Then, in a heartbeat, it was sold.

The buyer’s ID flashed across the screen: @RichBaby.

The chat erupted.

Evelyn Sinclair’s account had resurfaced. Last time, she’d blown 800 million to hijack an entire shopping livestream, demanding the host scour Europe for her whims.

Now? She’d just casually dropped two billion on a tropical island.

For the ultra-rich, money wasn’t currency—it was just numbers on a screen.

Unaware she’d become trending news again, Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom, only for Leo to pounce at her feet.

"Mama! I bought a little panther!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched.

She blinked at her stack of phones, wondering if she was hallucinating.

A bank notification glared back at her:

($2,000,000,000.00 — PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL!)

Panther Cay, a private tropical island, now belonged to Evelyn Sinclair.

Leo’s eyes sparkled with glee as it bounced around her, tail flicking excitedly before curling into her arms.

Evelyn exhaled. Sure, it was an absurd purchase—but the money was already gone.

Now, what exactly did one do with an island?

Before she could brainstorm, Lucas’ scream tore through the penthouse.

"WHO THE HELL SPENT MY TWO BILLION?!"

Evelyn froze.

She double-checked the bank alert.

Oh.

Oops.

That particular card had been linked to Lucas’ account.

"Fantastic! I just saved two billion!" Lucas stormed out of the kitchen, phone clutched in a death grip, glaring at his sister. "WHY?!"

Evelyn offered a sheepish smile. "Well… to celebrate my recent corporate takeover and the billion-dollar profit I made, I bought myself a little island."

Lucas clutched his chest.

She’d earned a billion—then spent two to celebrate?!

He whipped toward William Sterling, who’d just entered the room.

"Dad, are you sure Evelyn won’t bankrupt the company?"

William smacked the back of Lucas’ head. "Don’t be dramatic. It’s just an island."

Then, with a dismissive glance, he added, "Honestly, you’re the most useless of my children."

Lucas gaped.

Why was he always footing Evelyn’s bills?!

First the yacht, then the shopping spree, now this island?!

Alexander and Donovan were far richer than him!

Evelyn grinned, eyes crinkling. "Lucas, Leo and I appreciate you so much."

With that, she scooped up Leo and sauntered off.

The internet, meanwhile, had imploded.

[Rich Queen, buy me next!]
[CEO Sinclair, adopt me!]
[Goddess, I’m cheaper than an island!]
[Imagine having 2B to blow on a whim…]
[The jealousy is REAL.]

Dominic Kingsley, under Evelyn’s orders, swiftly contained the frenzy. By the next evening, chatter had died down—until Isabella Montgomery dragged Evelyn out to Velvet Lounge to "celebrate" her new acquisition.

When Evelyn arrived, Isabella was already laughing with the bartender.

Spotting Evelyn, she winked. "Ms. Sinclair, your spending habits are legendary."

Evelyn sighed. "What if I told you it was an accidental purchase?"

She gestured to Leo. "He must’ve misclicked. What bad intentions could a tiny AI tiger have?"

The bartender stared at her with reverence, sliding a shot of tequila her way.

Evelyn downed it. "Thanks."

"You just scared off every gold-digger in the city," Isabella mused. "Next time, maybe don’t broadcast your island purchases if you want suitors."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I spend my family’s money. Why would I care about men’s opinions?"

"Fair." Isabella smirked. "Though, you did reject Nathan Blackwood."

Evelyn snorted. "Him? Worthless."

Isabella tapped her chin. "At least find someone more expensive next time."

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink.

This woman was insane.

Isabella, however, was dead serious. "How much do you think Nathan’s worth?"

Evelyn’s lips curled.

"Less than dirt."
###Chapter 197 A Public Declaration

At the bar counter, the bartender who overheard Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery's conversation couldn't suppress a smirk.

Only Evelyn would dare call Nathan Blackwood worthless in this entire city.

Wait—

The bartender's eyes widened when he spotted a tall, imposing figure standing behind the two women.

Those sharp features in the dim lighting... It couldn't be...

His hands trembled violently. The cocktail shaker slipped from his grasp, shattering on the marble counter with a loud crash.

"M-Mr. B-Blackwood?"

Both Evelyn and Isabella froze simultaneously. Years of friendship had given them perfect synchronization—neither turned around.

Speak of the devil indeed. Evelyn felt her skin prickle under the intensity of that burning gaze.

Her pulse raced. Then she steeled herself. What was there to fear? Even if she said it to his face, it would still be true—Nathan Blackwood meant nothing to her now.

With renewed confidence, Evelyn spun around.

Empty space. She frowned and shot the bartender a death glare.

"I swear! He was right there!" The bartender stammered, wiping sweat from his brow. "One second he was there, the next—poof! Gone!"

Isabella exhaled shakily, though she couldn't explain her own relief. A sudden drumroll grabbed everyone's attention.

Evelyn's gaze snapped to the stage where a familiar figure sat behind the drum set, lost in the rhythm.

"Sebastian Hart?" Isabella grinned knowingly.

She leaned closer to Evelyn. "Guess who's returning to town? Victoria Ashford."

Victoria Ashford—CEO of Ashford Enterprises and current head of the powerful Ashford family from Santa Barbara.

After her parents' tragic death, the young heiress had single-handedly rescued her family's empire from collapse. The business world knew her as the "Ice Queen"—ruthless, brilliant, and untouchable.

Few knew about her decade-long unrequited love for Sebastian Hart.

Evelyn's drink nearly slipped from her fingers. "She came back for him?"

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Why else would the Ice Queen grace our humble Velvet Lounge?"

Evelyn choked on her cocktail. "Well damn. Someone's about to get claimed."

On stage, Sebastian lost himself in the music's crescendo. As the final beat echoed, he twirled his drumsticks with a roguish grin that sent female patrons swooning.

Evelyn instinctively raised her hand to applaud—only for Sebastian to lock eyes with her.

He grabbed the microphone. "The woman I adore is cheering for me tonight."

With a deliberate wink at Evelyn, he sent the crowd into hysterics. She immediately dropped her hand, cheeks flaming as she turned away.

"That lunatic!" Evelyn hissed.

Isabella ducked her head, pretending not to know them. "The man has no shame."

From the VIP balcony above, every moment played out in perfect clarity.

Nathan Blackwood observed the radiant Sebastian with stormy eyes, his jaw clenched tight enough to crack teeth.

Across from him sat an elegant woman with a sleek bob—her aura so icy it could frost the champagne flute in her white-knuckled grip.

Though young, Victoria Ashford carried herself with the poise of a seasoned executive. Not a single emotion flickered across her porcelain face—except when her gaze lingered on Sebastian.

For one unguarded moment, raw jealousy flashed in her eyes before vanishing behind her usual impenetrable mask.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, raising her glass, "I trust our collaboration will be... mutually beneficial."

Their crystal glasses touched with a delicate chime. The deal was sealed.
###Chapter 198 I Won't Back Down

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she prepared for the day. She chose a sleek emerald green dress that hugged her curves perfectly, layering it with a tailored white blazer that screamed power and elegance.

Her assistant Bennett was already waiting when she arrived at Sterling Corp's headquarters. "The bidding starts at 2 PM," he informed her, handing over a thick dossier. "This property in Montevista is the most coveted commercial land this quarter."

Evelyn's fingers traced the embossed Sterling Corp logo on the folder. "Let me guess - Blackwood Enterprises is our main competition?"

Bennett nodded grimly. The numbers on the first page made Evelyn's eyebrows rise. "This is our opening bid? That's..."

"Ambitious? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely." Bennett adjusted his glasses. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't bring anything less to this fight."

The Grandeur Hotel's ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers that afternoon. The air hummed with polite conversation and veiled threats as rival executives circled each other like sharks. No one revealed their cards - the numbers in their briefcases would determine who walked away victorious.

Harrison, Nathan's ever-efficient assistant, worked the room with practiced ease. But it was the striking brunette beside him who caught Evelyn's attention. The woman carried herself with the confidence of someone used to commanding rooms, her burgundy pantsuit accentuating her sharp features.

Their eyes met across the crowded space. The stranger's lips curved into a knowing smile as she approached. "Ms. Sinclair," she extended a manicured hand. "Victoria Ashford. I've been looking forward to meeting you."

Evelyn accepted the handshake, feeling the subtle challenge in the other woman's grip. "The feeling is mutual, Ms. Ashford. Your reputation precedes you."

Victoria's designer suit screamed West Coast money, all sharp angles and calculated elegance. In contrast, Evelyn's flowing dress softened her powerful presence, creating an intriguing juxtaposition between the two businesswomen.

"Nathan not joining the fun today?" Evelyn asked casually, noting the absence of her ex-husband.

Before Victoria could respond, a familiar voice interrupted. "Darling, you're looking positively radiant today." Sebastian Hart materialized at Evelyn's side, draping an arm around her shoulders with his trademark charm.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but didn't shrug him off. "Shouldn't you be bidding for Hart Industries instead of harassing me?"

Sebastian's grin turned wolfish. "Why bid for land when I can bid for your attention?"

Victoria's entire demeanor shifted at Sebastian's appearance. The ice queen melted, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear with sudden self-consciousness. "Mr. Hart," she said, her voice dropping an octave. "What a pleasant surprise."

Sebastian blinked. "Do I know you?"

Evelyn barely suppressed a groan. "Sebastian, this is Victoria Ashford from Ashford Enterprises? Your Harvard Business School classmate?"

Recognition dawned on Sebastian's face. "Victoria! My God, you've changed." His appreciative once-over made Victoria flush. "Last time I saw you, you were all braces and textbooks."

The tension dissipated as the auctioneer called for attention. Bennett took his seat beside Evelyn, fingers flying across his tablet. "Something's off," he muttered. "Blackwood's team isn't acting like they want this property."

The bidding war commenced with smaller players dropping out quickly as the numbers climbed past $30 billion. When Victoria threw down $35 billion, the room held its breath.

Evelyn signaled Bennett. "$38 billion."

Victoria countered immediately. "$40 billion."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Ashford Enterprises specialized in California real estate - why this sudden interest in East Coast property? Bennett's message pinged on her screen: Victoria's working with Nathan. This is a setup.

The pieces clicked into place. Of course Nathan would use a proxy to drive up the price. Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk. Two could play that game. She leaned toward Bennett. "Let's give them a number they won't forget."
###Chapter 199 Everything I Have

If Kingsley Tech and Ashford Enterprises were collaborating, their chances of winning this bid would skyrocket.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained a composed smile, though unease flickered in her chest. This trip might end in disappointment, but she wasn’t about to surrender without a fight.

She signaled Bennett to continue. $45 billion.

The room fell silent. The real battle had just begun.

Victoria Ashford shot Evelyn a scorching glare before raising her paddle. $48 billion.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. That was dangerously close to her limit.

Even if Sterling Corporation could afford more, the profit margins would shrink to nothing.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn met Bennett’s gaze and nodded. $49 billion.

Victoria faltered. Evelyn knew she’d hit their breaking point.

Victoria and Harrison exchanged hushed words before Harrison pulled out his phone. Nathan Blackwood must be getting an update, Evelyn thought.

$49 billion going twice!

Victoria’s paddle shot up again, her expression strained. $49.3 billion!

Evelyn exhaled. She wouldn’t bleed money for pride.

$49.3 billion going twice!

Just as the auctioneer raised his gavel, Sebastian Hart—seated beside Evelyn—spoke.

$50 billion.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Evelyn gaped at him.

Have you lost your mind?!

Sebastian merely smirked, silent.

Victoria paled. $50 billion was beyond her agreement with Nathan.

$50 billion going once! $50 billion going twice! Sold to Mr. Hart of Hart Industries!

Applause erupted. The prime land now belonged to the Harts.

Sebastian rose gracefully, acknowledging the crowd before striding to the stage. Evelyn and Bennett exchanged stunned glances.

The always-reserved Hart family had just dropped $50 billion on a plot of land? Since when were they interested in real estate?

As congratulations poured in, Evelyn gathered her purse to leave.

A firm hand caught her wrist.

"Leaving so soon?"

Sebastian’s devilish grin was infuriatingly charming. His eyes sparkled like starlight.

Evelyn stiffened, then forced a smile. "Expecting congratulations? $50 billion, Sebastian. Did you even run the numbers?"

He chuckled. "Save them for yourself."

She frowned.

Sebastian leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You wanted this land, didn’t you? I’ll sell it to you for $49 billion."

Evelyn froze.

Victoria and Harrison, lingering nearby, overheard. Victoria’s face drained of color.

"Mr. Hart!" she snapped. "You’re not developing this yourself?"

Sebastian turned, his smile lazy. "Not interested. Just buying it for my goddess." He winked at Evelyn.

Victoria trembled. "You—you’re treating corporate funds like a game?!"

Sebastian’s amusement vanished. His voice turned icy. "It’s my family’s money. I don’t need outsiders lecturing me."

Then, softening, he cupped Evelyn’s face.

"Honestly, I’d give it to you for free. But I know you’d protest. So marry me instead." His thumb brushed her cheek. "Everything I have is yours."
###Chapter 200 You Won't Steal from Me, Right?

Sebastian Hart smirked to himself. It's just a piece of land. Consider it an engagement gift.

Evelyn Sinclair never expected Sebastian to throw money at her like this. A storm of conflicting emotions churned in her chest.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t afford the extra billion.

But corporate funds weren’t something she could move around so recklessly.

Sebastian’s bold move had cornered her. As Evelyn hesitated, Victoria Ashford scoffed.

"I didn’t realize New York’s business elite had such blurred lines between personal and professional affairs."

Her voice dripped with disdain. "Second Young Master Hart, are you really gambling your family’s fortune just to impress a woman?"

Victoria had crossed a line. Sebastian’s expression darkened, his gaze turning icy.

He ignored her completely, his attention fixed solely on Evelyn.

"As long as she’s happy," he said smoothly, "it’s worth every penny."

His words were deliberate, laced with challenge. "Even if I have to lose everything for her, I’d do it without hesitation."

Victoria’s face twisted. The humiliation burned.

Without another word, the proud businesswoman turned on her heel and stormed off, her composure shattered.

Sebastian Hart was utterly, shamelessly in love with Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn frowned. "Sebastian, this is reckless."

He just laughed. "I won’t let what you want fall into someone else’s hands."

Especially Nathan Blackwood’s.

Evelyn sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Bennett," she called to her assistant. "Transfer $49 billion to Hart Corporation immediately."

"Yes, ma’am."

She met Sebastian’s gaze. "The remaining billion will come from my personal account."

He’s not Lucas. I won’t take advantage of him.

Sebastian’s smirk vanished. "Evelyn, I don’t want your money."

"Then prepare to explain to your grandfather why you wasted $50 billion on a whim," she shot back, already walking away.

Sebastian paled at the thought.

Reginald Hart would skin him alive.

He hurried after her. "I did this for you!"

"Get lost," Evelyn said without looking back.

Blackwood Enterprises.

Nathan Blackwood’s expression was thunderous as Harrison delivered the report.

If Evelyn had won the bid fairly, he wouldn’t have been angry. He had even considered withdrawing—or proposing a three-way partnership.

But Sebastian Hart had swooped in and handed it to her like some grand romantic gesture.

What does that make me? Nathan thought bitterly. A cheap, calculating bastard in comparison?

Harrison stood silently, sensing the dangerous shift in the air.

Blackwood Enterprises had lost bids before. But never had Nathan looked this furious.

Second Young Master Hart really knows how to push his buttons.

"Sir," Harrison ventured carefully, "since the matter is already settled—"

Nathan cut him off. "Contact Reginald Hart. Tell him I’ll buy that land for $50 billion."

His tone left no room for negotiation. "Ask if he’s willing to sell."

Harrison blinked. This was a direct bypass of Sebastian.

Just how much does he despise the man?

Without delay, Harrison made the call, explaining the situation and Nathan’s offer.

To his surprise, Reginald Hart agreed within seconds.

"My grandson is impulsive. Pay him no mind."

The old man’s voice was firm. "I’ll have the land transferred to Blackwood Enterprises immediately."

Harrison exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Mr. Hart. We’ll send representatives to assist with the handover."

Within minutes, Evelyn received a call from Reginald Hart.

She listened, then laughed in disbelief.

Perfect. I didn’t want this mess anyway.

But one thought nagged at her. Since when is Nathan Blackwood this bold?

Without hesitation, she agreed to the arrangement. Business came first.

At $50 billion, the land was a financial sinkhole.

The deal was settled quietly, efficiently.

Sebastian Hart was the last to know.
###Chapter 201 Evelyn's Elite Attitude

With the matter finally settled, Evelyn Sinclair exhaled in relief. Isabella Montgomery extended a shopping invitation which Evelyn eagerly accepted.

The upscale mall buzzed with activity as the two friends strolled through its marble corridors. By chance, they wandered into an exclusive automotive showroom where a gleaming Aston Martin sat center stage, its polished curves catching the light.

Even Evelyn, accustomed to luxury, paused to admire the vehicle's flawless design. "This masterpiece belongs in my private collection," she murmured, running her fingers along the sleek hood.

Isabella rolled her eyes playfully. "Only you would say that about a million-dollar car."

A sharp-eyed salesman approached, immediately recognizing Evelyn from recent headlines about her extravagant purchases. His commission dreams danced before his eyes as he practically bowed. "Ms. Sinclair! How may I assist you today?"

Just as Evelyn considered the purchase, a familiar voice cut through the showroom. "I'll take it. Name your price."

Turning, Evelyn faced Victoria Ashford and Sophia Blackwood. The contrast between them was striking - Victoria's polished elegance overshadowing Sophia's forced sophistication.

Sophia's gaze held undisguised challenge. While she lacked the courage to confront Evelyn directly, her companion clearly didn't share that hesitation.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ms. Ashford, I didn't know you had an interest in sports cars."

Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Some things are worth acquiring on sight. Though it seems you've beaten me to it again."

"Not necessarily," Sophia interjected. "No payment means no ownership. First come doesn't always mean first served."

The salesman shifted uncomfortably. "That's correct... Ms. Sinclair hasn't completed the transaction."

Evelyn studied Victoria carefully. The unspoken hostility puzzled her - they'd never interacted beyond polite business functions.

"Would you really deny me this?" Victoria asked, her tone light but eyes sharp.

Isabella tensed beside Evelyn, sensing the undercurrents. But Evelyn merely smiled. "Of course not. If this catches your eye, by all means."

Victoria blinked, unprepared for such easy concession. The salesman jumped in. "The price is six million, madam."

Without hesitation, Victoria produced a black card. "Process it immediately."

Sophia clapped like an excited child. "Victoria, you're incredible! This car was made for you!"

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances. "We should continue our shopping," Evelyn said smoothly.

Victoria's lips curved. "Why not join us? The more the merrier."

Both women froze at the unexpected invitation. The tension thickened like fog in the showroom.
###Chapter 202 This Mall Is Mine

Since Victoria Ashford insisted on joining them, Evelyn Sinclair couldn't refuse without seeming rude. She curved her lips into a polite but distant smile.

"Of course, the pleasure is mine."

She's clearly targeting me. But why? Evelyn pondered it all afternoon but couldn't pinpoint the reason.

When they entered a high-end boutique, the staff immediately recognized Evelyn. As the owner of an exclusive global membership, she was their most valued client.

The manager rushed forward with a practiced smile. "Ms. Sinclair, what brings you in today? We have two new limited-edition handbags—only three exist worldwide. Would you like to see them?"

Before Evelyn could respond, an attendant had already brought them out.

They were exquisite.

"I'll take them," Victoria declared without hesitation.

The staff froze, glancing uncertainly at Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with amusement, her smile deepening.

"Didn't you hear Ms. Ashford?"

The staff scrambled to obey, wrapping the bags for Victoria.

Not stopping there, Victoria proceeded to purchase every item the manager had intended to show Evelyn—a dozen more bags in total.

Evelyn didn't protest, letting her take them all.

They visited several other luxury stores, where Victoria repeated the same pattern—buying everything recommended to Evelyn.

Isabella Montgomery gently tugged Evelyn's arm. "This Victoria shops with more enthusiasm than I do," she murmured.

Evelyn smirked.

By the time they finished, Evelyn's feet ached. She settled into an outdoor café on the upper level, savoring a cup of rich, aromatic coffee. The warmth soothed her instantly.

Victoria and Sophia Blackwood joined her after completing their purchases. Victoria ordered a coffee for herself.

Evelyn regarded her with relaxed ease. "Did you enjoy your shopping spree, Ms. Ashford?"

Victoria hesitated. "It was... adequate."

She seemed to be choosing her words carefully. "Ms. Sinclair, you didn't seem interested in any of the items I bought. Doesn't it bother you?"

Evelyn chuckled, tucking a strand of her long, wavy hair behind her ear. Her smile was radiant.

"Ms. Ashford, I suppose you weren't aware—this mall belongs to me. Since you've been so generous in supporting my business, why would I be upset? I'm delighted by your patronage."

The more Victoria spent, the happier Evelyn became.

The expressions around the table shifted dramatically—especially Sophia's.

Sophia's face was a picture of shock. This mall was the premier shopping destination for high society, where even the cheapest rug cost six figures.

She had no idea it was Evelyn's.

Victoria stiffened, her eyes turning icy.

"You played me?" she asked coolly.

Evelyn met her gaze without flinching.

"You chose to challenge me, Ms. Ashford. I didn't force you to buy anything."

Her lips curled into a frosty smile. Who does she think she's dealing with? She may have been a CEO for years, but I built my empire in Europe while she was still in college.

The air grew thick with tension.

Victoria was a seasoned businesswoman, capable of intimidating socialites with a single glance. Yet Evelyn remained unreadable—unaffected.

After a long silence, Victoria let out a cold laugh.

"Fine. I underestimated you this time. No wonder men flock to you, Ms. Sinclair. You're... different."

Men? Evelyn was baffled.

Aside from the persistent Sebastian Hart, who else was there?

Then it clicked.

"Ms. Ashford," Evelyn said slowly, "are you targeting me because of Sebastian?"
###Chapter 203 If You Can't Stand It, Look Away

Evelyn Sinclair propped her chin on her hands, elbows resting lightly on the coffee table. She tilted her head slightly, studying Victoria Ashford with an amused glint in her eyes.

One beat. Two beats. Three.

Silence stretched between them.

When no answer came, Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.

Victoria's usually composed expression flickered—just for a second—before irritation darkened her gaze. "I simply can't stand watching you treat people like disposable options."

Her words were sharp, deliberate.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh?"

"Am I wrong?" Victoria countered, her voice icy. "Sebastian Hart clearly has feelings for you, yet you keep stringing him along. Isn't that exactly what you're doing?"

Isabella Montgomery scoffed, crossing her arms. "Since when has Evelyn ever led Sebastian on? What do you even know about their relationship?"

Victoria's jaw tightened, but she didn’t back down. "Just because you're close friends, it's acceptable for Ms. Sinclair to play with his emotions without remorse?"

Evelyn's patience snapped.

"Play with his emotions?" she repeated, her voice dangerously soft. "Ms. Ashford, which part of my actions gave you that impression? Sebastian is the one who chose to cross the line from friendship. I’ve made my stance clear—repeatedly."

Her fingers tapped lightly against the table. "If anything, I’m the one exhausted from having to reject him over and over."

Victoria’s lips pressed into a thin line. "If you don’t return his feelings, you should cut him off completely. Keeping him around while knowing how he feels—that’s cruel."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "So, according to you, rejecting someone means burning every bridge? Erasing years of friendship?"

Victoria didn’t answer, but her silence was confirmation enough.

Ridiculous.

Evelyn leaned back, studying Victoria’s rigid posture. This little interrogation had clearly been planned.

She and Sebastian had been friends since childhood. She had ignored his advances, rejected him outright—multiple times. She owed him nothing beyond basic decency.

And yet, here Victoria was, acting as if Evelyn had committed some unforgivable sin.

"You know," Evelyn mused, her tone light but edged with steel, "I get the feeling you’ve never had to reject anyone before."

Victoria stiffened.

"Not every friendship has to turn romantic. Sebastian was the one who wanted more. I didn’t encourage it." Evelyn shrugged. "If I had, I would’ve accepted his proposal by now."

The unspoken words hung in the air: The problem isn’t me. It’s him.

Victoria’s expression darkened. "Or maybe you’re just keeping him as a backup while you explore other options."

Isabella slammed her hands on the table, rising to her feet. "Are you serious right now? Evelyn has been nothing but clear with Sebastian. If you’re so obsessed with him, go after him yourself! Don’t blame Evelyn because he doesn’t like you."

A flicker of something raw passed over Victoria’s face—hurt, frustration, maybe even humiliation. But she was a seasoned businesswoman. She knew how to mask her emotions.

Within seconds, her composure returned.

"Who Sebastian likes is irrelevant," she said coolly. "I simply don’t approve of Ms. Sinclair toying with people’s feelings."

Isabella looked ready to explode. Evelyn caught her wrist, pulling her back down.

"Enough," Evelyn murmured. "This is pointless."

Victoria’s smile was frosty. "Taking that as your admission, Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn stood, smoothing her skirt. Then she turned, meeting Victoria’s gaze head-on. Her lips curved into a slow, mocking smile.

"Ms. Ashford," she said sweetly, "my life is none of your business. If you don’t like what you see?" She leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper.

"Then look away."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked out, Isabella right behind her.

Victoria’s fists clenched at her sides.

But Evelyn didn’t glance back.
###Chapter 204 Why Did You Invite Me?

Evelyn let out a bitter chuckle. She wasn't sure whether she was laughing at Victoria Ashford's childish behavior or sheer stupidity. Tightening her grip on Isabella's arm, she spun on her heel and strode out of the café.

The afternoon sun bathed Montecito in golden light, the cloudless sky stretching endlessly above them. The weight in Evelyn's chest lifted as she inhaled the crisp air.

Isabella huffed the moment they stepped outside. "Victoria might be a brilliant businesswoman, but she's utterly clueless when it comes to men. No wonder she's still single."

Evelyn smirked. When the Ashford empire had been on the brink of collapse years ago, vultures had circled, hoping to manipulate Victoria into handing over control.

Yet against all odds, the steel-spined heiress had single-handedly saved her family's legacy. In the cutthroat world of business, Victoria was known for her ruthless efficiency - willing to cross any line if it meant securing victory.

No wonder she had so few suitors. Evelyn shook her head with quiet amusement. "I think she's serious about Nathan this time..."

Isabella gave a pitying look. "Sebastian would never go for someone like her. She's wasting her time." Evelyn merely arched a brow. "Don't be so sure."

Before Isabella could ask why, a sleek Range Rover pulled up beside them. The tinted window rolled down to reveal Nathan Blackwood's sculpted features. "Get in," he commanded, his deep voice smooth as aged whiskey.

Evelyn stiffened, deliberately turning away. She grabbed Isabella's hand and started walking in the opposite direction.

"First Victoria, now Nathan," she muttered. "This day just keeps getting better."

"Do you want that land parcel?" Nathan's question stopped her mid-step.

Evelyn turned slowly. "What do you mean?"

Hadn't Kingsley Tech already secured those rights? While she couldn't fathom why they'd overpay for the property, a corporation of their stature surely had plans to recoup their investment.

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Partner with me. If this project succeeds, Sterling Corporation's costs will drop by two-thirds."

Evelyn laughed derisively. Reduced costs meant slimmer profits. A three-way partnership? Clearly Nathan intended to bring Victoria into the fold.

What deal had they struck? The entire situation baffled her. Kingsley Tech had more than enough resources to develop the land independently. Why share the spoils?

She was about to leave when Nathan spoke again. "Evelyn, do you really think I'd go to such lengths just for a piece of dirt?" He gestured toward the horizon. "This parcel is surrounded by research institutes and elite universities."

"Fully developed, this won't just be land - it'll be the heartbeat of Montecito's future." His voice remained cool but carried an undercurrent of intensity. "Within five years, this district will become the city's economic, academic, and technological nucleus."

"Don't you want a seat at that table?" Nathan stepped out of the vehicle, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. Watching the flicker of interest cross her face, he pressed his advantage.

Evelyn clenched her fists, struggling to contain her rising excitement. His vision was compelling - this wasn't just real estate, but the foundation for what could become Montecito's version of Silicon Valley.

The potential profits were staggering. Yet she refused to let dollar signs cloud her judgment.

With deliberate calm, she met his gaze. "Your blueprint is impressive, Mr. Blackwood. But why include me?" Kingsley Tech could easily dominate this venture alone. If successful, Sterling Corporation would pale in comparison.

So why share the glory?
###Chapter 205: Is This Really a Gift?

Nathan's dark brows furrowed deeply. His stormy gray eyes held depths as unfathomable as the midnight sea. A tense silence stretched between them as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn finally broke eye contact, her expression carefully schooled into neutrality.

This deal was practically a guaranteed success. Unlike Kingsley Tech's risky AI venture, this project carried minimal risk. So why? Evelyn couldn't comprehend Nathan's sudden generosity. The man hesitated, his jaw tightening.

"There's no particular reason," Nathan finally said, his voice carefully controlled. "The choice is entirely yours." His words sent an inexplicable chill down Evelyn's spine.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Mr. Blackwood," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, "is this your way of easing your conscience after our divorce?" She could think of no other explanation.

Evelyn's words hung between them like a challenge. If Nathan dared confirm her suspicion, she wouldn't hesitate to slap that arrogant face of his. Would Nathan Blackwood extend such courtesy to any ordinary woman? Was this his twisted way of making amends? Offering billions in profits to soothe his guilty conscience?

How utterly pathetic.

Isabella Montgomery, sensing the escalating tension, suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Mr. Blackwood," she interjected smoothly, "surely there's no rush for an answer? For all we know, this could be some elaborate trap of yours." She flashed a diplomatic smile. "Why don't we let Evelyn consult with her board first?"

Evelyn shot her friend a questioning look, to which Isabella responded with a subtle wink. To everyone's surprise, Nathan simply nodded in agreement.

Once safely in the car, Evelyn turned to her friend. "Why did you stop me from getting an answer?"

Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically. "Do you honestly believe Nathan Blackwood would set up some childish trap for you?" When Evelyn remained silent, she pressed on. "Exactly. So why reject what's essentially free money?"

Evelyn's frown deepened. She cared about Nathan's motives. If this was indeed some sort of guilt offering, she wanted no part of it. Isabella sighed, reading her friend's thoughts effortlessly.

"Evie," she said gently, "why does his reason matter so much to you?" The unspoken question hung heavy between them: Had Evelyn truly moved on?

The question hit Evelyn like a bucket of ice water, shocking her back to reality.

"Whether it's compensation or not," Isabella continued pragmatically, "this is a golden opportunity literally falling into your lap. You're not stealing or doing anything unethical. Why on earth would you say no?"

Evelyn blinked, then burst into sudden laughter. "You mercenary little witch!" But she couldn't deny the logic in Isabella's words. What had she been thinking, nearly rejecting such an opportunity?

"Since taking over Sterling Corp," Isabella declared proudly, "I've learned never to let good opportunities slip away." She grinned triumphantly.

"You're absolutely right," Evelyn agreed, a new determination shining in her eyes. "If Nathan wants to throw money at me to ease his conscience, who am I to stop him?" It wasn't as if Sterling Corp wouldn't hold up their end of the bargain.

Though her decision was made, Evelyn chose not to respond immediately. Timing was everything. Later that evening, fresh from her shower, Evelyn's phone rang. The caller ID showed Sebastian Hart.

"Evie!" Sebastian's voice crackled with outrage through the phone. "How could you hand that precious land over to that bastard Nathan Blackwood?!"
###Chapter 206 Prince Charming Sebastian

The moment Evelyn heard Sebastian's frustrated groan through the phone, a smirk curled her lips. Her perfectly arched eyebrows lifted in amusement.

That troublesome acquisition had nearly burned her fingers. If he wanted it so badly, he could have it.

"Then I got beaten up for nothing!" Sebastian's aggrieved wail crackled through the line. His voice dropped to a wounded whisper. "You didn't even bother to visit me."

Evelyn's smirk deepened. "Prince Charming Hart, what exactly would my visit accomplish?"

Silence. Then a sharp intake of breath.

She could practically see his face flushing crimson with rage. His next words came out through gritted teeth. "Evie, how dare you mock me?"

A soft laugh escaped her. "Don't be such a drama queen."

"Just stay home and reflect on your mistakes. Next time, you might not even have the strength to dial my number." The line went dead with an angry click.

Sebastian probably felt like that call had shaved years off his life.

Outside, night had fallen. Evelyn skimmed through a stack of documents before retiring. Sleep claimed her effortlessly.

Dawn painted the sky in soft hues when she awoke. Stretching languidly, Evelyn slipped out of bed. Bennett arrived promptly with the car, whisking her away to the grand opening of the Global Summit Center.

Documents occupied her during the short ride. Before she knew it, they'd arrived.

Inside the Summit Center's exhibition hall, the ceremony unfolded with understated elegance. Only specially invited members of high society graced the event. Evelyn declined the Chairman's personal greeting with a polite smile.

Stepping out of the car, she moved toward the art exhibition with Bennett at her side. Diverse artistic styles - romantic, realist, abstract - coexisted harmoniously within semi-partitioned spaces.

Most pieces displayed were priceless collector's items, elevating their allure. Evelyn paused before nearly every painting, absorbing each masterpiece with quiet intensity.

Noticing her absorption, Bennett drifted toward his own favorites.

Evelyn reached the final display - a massive canvas shrouded in black velvet. Assuming a staff oversight, she lifted a corner with the provided tool.

Gold-encrusted doors materialized from darkness, slightly ajar. Light spilled through the gap like a blade piercing night's throat. Before the doors stood a woman's silhouette.

Clad in crimson, her curves accentuated by the dress's plunge, the figure's waves of hair cascaded down bare shoulders. The red fabric bled into surrounding shadows.

Breath caught in Evelyn's throat. The painting's oppressive anticipation struck like a physical blow. Conflicting emotions tangled in her chest - familiarity warring with unease.

The exquisite tension between weight and levity left her unsettled. Her fingers stiffened. Vision locked onto the canvas, she stood transfixed.

"Evelyn?" A melodic voice interrupted her trance.

She turned automatically, smile blooming at the sight of Eleanor Hart - Sebastian's mother, recently returned from her Swiss vacation glowing with health.

"It is you! That silhouette looked unmistakably familiar."

Evelyn embraced the older woman warmly before noticing her companion. Victoria Ashford stood stiffly beside Eleanor. Evelyn's smile widened. "Ms. Ashford. What a coincidence."

Victoria's responding smile never reached her eyes. Their first encounter had ended with Victoria's humiliation. Neither woman pretended otherwise.

Yet decorum prevailed before Eleanor. "Ms. Sinclair. I didn't realize you appreciated fine art."

Evelyn chuckled at the barb. "Did you assume I only appreciate stock portfolios, Ms. Ashford?"

Eleanor blinked, sensing the frost between them. Before she could intervene, the curator hurried over.

"Mrs. Hart, Ms. Sinclair, my sincerest apologies for the inadequate reception. Have any pieces particularly captivated you?"

Victoria seized the opportunity. "This one's exceptional. Mrs. Hart admires it too. Allow me to purchase it for you."

Eleanor demurred. "Oh darling, that's too generous—"

But Victoria, eager to curry favor, turned to the curator. "I'll take this painting. Have it wrapped."

The curator shook his head apologetically. "I'm afraid that's impossible."
###Chapter 207 You're Making Me Look Bad

The gallery curator adjusted his glasses. "This particular piece is one of Master von Strauss's rare creations. He seldom parts with his works." His voice dropped to a whisper. "And if you look closely here—"

Their conversation was interrupted by the rhythmic tapping of an ebony cane. An elderly gentleman with a snow-white beard approached with deliberate steps. Friedrich von Strauss was originally from Montecito but had settled in Liberty decades ago.

His reputation preceded him. Eleanor Hart, Sebastian's mother, recognized the legendary artist immediately. Among high society women, collecting masterpieces was as essential as owning designer jewelry.

Without valuable art in one's collection, one risked being labeled nouveau riche. Yet von Strauss's works weren't commodities that could simply be purchased. The eccentric artist was notoriously selective about his buyers.

Eleanor's mind raced. If I could acquire one of his paintings, my standing among the elite would skyrocket. Before she could formulate a plan, the white-bearded maestro stood before them.

The curator bowed slightly. "Master von Strauss, what an honor." The artist acknowledged the greeting with a curt nod, his piercing blue eyes scanning the group dismissively. Without a word, he reached for the painting on display.

Victoria Ashford noticed Eleanor's covetous gaze. Seizing the opportunity, she stepped forward boldly. "Excuse me, what's your asking price for this piece? I'm interested in purchasing it."

Von Strauss's bushy eyebrows knitted together as he regarded Victoria. "You couldn't possibly afford it," he scoffed, attempting to brush past her.

Victoria's cheeks burned. As CEO of Ashford Enterprises, she wasn't accustomed to being dismissed. "Name your price, then we'll see what I can or cannot afford," she challenged, her tone icy.

The old artist snorted. "Money can't buy taste, young lady. Selling to you would tarnish my legacy." His cane tapped impatiently. "Go deface someone else's artwork."

Humiliation washed over Victoria. Being insulted in front of Eleanor was unbearable. The air grew thick with tension.

Von Strauss's gaze suddenly landed on Evelyn. His stern expression softened slightly. "And you? Are you here to waste my time as well?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "No, I'm just another filthy rich heiress apparently."

To everyone's shock, the old man burst into laughter. Victoria's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Why offer it to her if you won't sell to me?" she demanded.

"Because she's got spirit!" von Strauss declared, as if it were the most obvious answer in the world. Victoria looked ready to combust.

Eleanor discreetly nudged Evelyn. Don't refuse! I need that painting! Evelyn hesitated, then sighed.

"Alright, how much?" she asked reluctantly. This wasn't about one-upping Victoria—Eleanor's desperate expression made that clear. As Sebastian's mother, Evelyn couldn't ignore the request.

The artist stroked his beard. "I sold a piece to European royalty for nine million pounds. What's your offer?"

Gasps echoed through the gallery. Even Victoria looked stunned. Nine million for a single painting? That's museum acquisition territory.

Evelyn studied the artwork critically. "It's worth every penny," she conceded. Seeing Eleanor's hopeful gaze, she made her decision. "I'll double it," she said casually, as if discussing lunch plans. "No point being stingy."

Von Strauss coughed in surprise. "Such extravagance!" he muttered, though his eyes twinkled with amusement.

Evelyn shrugged. "Only the best for true art."

After a dramatic pause, the artist suddenly scowled. "Changed my mind. Not selling to you either!" He turned sharply on his heel.

Victoria smirked triumphantly. "Seems we're in the same boat after all." Eleanor wrung her hands in distress.

Evelyn exhaled deeply. This stubborn old man... With quick steps, she intercepted von Strauss. Placing a hand on his arm, she fixed him with an imploring look. "Master von Strauss, you're really putting me in an impossible position here..."
###Chapter 208 The Ridiculous Family Gathering

Evelyn Sinclair's thoughts raced. Old Master? The way Friedrich addressed the elderly gentleman carried such resignation, yet held an undeniable familiarity.

The guests exchanged startled glances.

The white-bearded Friedrich von Strauss finally halted his steps. A subtle smile danced in his refined gaze.

He snorted coldly.

Yet his tone carried unmistakable reproach and regret. "Someone who abandoned their studies halfway doesn't deserve to call themselves my apprentice!" Friedrich had only ever taken one apprentice in his lifetime.

Evelyn possessed an extraordinary soul, her talent surpassing ordinary people a hundredfold. Every brushstroke in her paintings brimmed with breathtaking vitality.

Yet after barely six months under Friedrich's tutelage, Evelyn had abandoned painting to pursue business ventures.

The master who had finally broken his lifelong rule of taking no students had been so furious he couldn't eat for days.

The disappointment still burned! "How dare she ask to purchase my artwork? In her dreams!" Friedrich had intended this encounter to teach Evelyn a harsh lesson.

But when the infuriating girl pouted, his accumulated anger evaporated instantly.

"Old Master? Apprentice? Evelyn, what's going on? How do you know Mr. von Strauss?" Eleanor Hart's mind swirled with unanswered questions.

Victoria Ashford pieced together their relationship from the exchange. A flicker of disappointment crossed her features.

She hesitated momentarily before lifting her gaze. "Master von Strauss, don't you still possess numerous private collections not released to the public? I find 'The Radiant Dawn' particularly exquisite."

"Perhaps you might consider selling it to me?" Friedrich's mouth twitched imperceptibly. The audacity! His private collection pieces were reserved either for auction or permanent exhibition.

Each was priceless! 'The Radiant Dawn' had been displayed at the Louvre! And she spoke of acquiring it as casually as browsing a flea market? His fury reignited instantly.

Yet facing Evelyn's radiant smile, his resolve crumbled. The elderly master glared daggers at her for several heartbeats before releasing a derisive snort.

"I planned to auction it for five million. For you? Ten."

"Take it if you want!" With that, Friedrich spun on his heel and marched away before his temper could shorten his lifespan.

This outcome stunned Evelyn. Against all expectations, Friedrich hadn't extorted her. The price fell far below 'The Radiant Dawn's' true value. Evelyn turned her smile toward Eleanor. "Mrs. Hart, please consider this my gift to you."

Then she hurried after the retreating artist, fearing he might change his mind. During their return, Victoria observed Eleanor's delighted expression with growing discomfort.

"Mrs. Hart," she interjected smoothly, "if I recall correctly, 'The Radiant Dawn' originally sold for ten million. Is Evelyn truly that close with Master von Strauss?" Eleanor's smile faltered.

"Oh? What exactly are you implying? Would the master sell her a forgery?"

"Certainly not! I merely worry their closeness might... influence the authenticity. It could be a practice piece or flawed work."

Such pieces held modest value but paled against genuine masterworks.

Eleanor's breath hitched. Victoria offered a consoling smile. "Though perhaps I'm mistaken. I've heard Master von Strauss marks all authentic works with his distinctive seal in the bottom right corner."

"You'll know when you see it."

Nodding absently, Eleanor formulated a plan. She deliberately roused Sebastian from his exaggerated convalescence in bed.

Eleanor announced a family gathering at their estate. Sebastian groaned dramatically, refusing to rise, his petulant whines grating on her nerves.

"Family gathering? What absurd notion is this? I've specially invited Evelyn and Victoria. Don't attend if you'd rather not."

At Evelyn's name, Sebastian transformed instantly, vitality surging through him like a revived man.
###Chapter 209 Stay Away From My Son

Evelyn Sinclair hesitated when the invitation to the Hart family banquet arrived. Knowing Sebastian Hart's growing affection for her, she instinctively wanted to maintain distance from the influential family.

Yet part of her reasoned this might simply be a gracious gesture to thank her for the masterpiece she'd acquired—The Radiant Dawn. Declining would appear unnecessarily suspicious.

Upon arriving at the Hart estate, Evelyn was startled to find Victoria Ashford already present, chatting animatedly with Reginald Hart and Eleanor Hart. She presented the carefully wrapped painting.

Eleanor accepted it with practiced grace, her smile faltering for a split second as she glimpsed the artwork. The reaction was so fleeting Evelyn nearly missed it.

After greeting the patriarch, Evelyn heard rapid footsteps descending the marble staircase. Sebastian appeared, boyish excitement lighting his features. "Evie! I just found our old school photos—remember when we dressed as bride and groom for that play?"

Evelyn stiffened.

With Victoria watching, she couldn't afford such casual intimacy. "That was a costume, Sebastian. For A Midsummer Night's Dream." She shot him a warning glance.

Eleanor set the painting aside with deliberate care. "Mind your manners, Sebastian. Ms. Ashford has been waiting patiently for your attention."

Victoria's gaze lingered on Sebastian's star-bright eyes—that particular warmth he reserved only for Evelyn. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

"It's quite alright," Victoria forced a laugh. "We're practically old friends." The words tasted like ash.

Sebastian offered polite pleasantries before his attention inevitably drifted back to Evelyn. Reginald engaged her in lively conversation while Eleanor's demeanor turned glacial—a stark contrast to her warmth toward Victoria.

After dinner, Victoria volunteered to prepare dessert. Eleanor practically dragged Sebastian to assist, leaving Evelyn alone in the sitting room. The moment the door closed, Eleanor's mask slipped.

She slid a check across the coffee table.

Evelyn examined the sum—ten million dollars—and frowned. "I don't understand."

Eleanor's laugh was razor-sharp. "Consider it payment for that... piece you brought. Though we both know it's not worth half that amount."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her teacup. The Radiant Dawn was valued at over a hundred million. "You believe it's counterfeit?"

"Don't play naive." Eleanor's gaze turned venomous. "I've tolerated your closeness to my son out of respect for your late mother. But passing off forgeries? That crosses lines."

The mention of her mother sent icy rage through Evelyn's veins. She stood abruptly. "Since my gift offends you, I'll take it back."

Eleanor's voice turned deadly quiet. "Take the money. And stay away from Sebastian."
###Chapter 210 The Final Ultimatum

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step when the words hit her.

This wasn't the first time she'd received such a warning.

The initial one had come from Margaret Blackwood right before her doomed marriage to Nathan.

Now it was Eleanor Hart - Sebastian's mother - delivering the same chilling message.

Evelyn studied Eleanor's composed features. The warmth from earlier had evaporated, revealing the cold calculation beneath.

Her stomach twisted. She'd genuinely respected this woman.

"Mrs. Hart," Evelyn's voice dripped with icy amusement, "is this your way of telling me to back off?"

Eleanor's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Interpret it however you wish, dear. My son nearly lost his position on the board because of you."

Evelyn's breath caught.

"That fifty billion dollar island purchase? It almost destroyed everything he's built. His grandfather wanted him removed entirely."

The revelation struck like a physical blow. She'd thought her intervention had helped.

"Evelyn, had this been before your divorce, I might have welcomed you. But now?" Eleanor's gaze flicked toward the kitchen where Victoria Ashford was pretending not to listen. "With your scandal-ridden past? You're the worst possible match for my son."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips.

Why bother with the charade? Just say I'm not good enough for your precious heir.

Her eyes darted between Sebastian's impatient stance and Victoria's calculated movements. The chessboard became clear.

"So you've already chosen his bride?" Evelyn's voice turned lethal. "And I'm the inconvenient obstacle?"

Eleanor didn't deny it. "Victoria comes from an impeccable family. She's accomplished, graceful, and most importantly..." Her gaze turned pointed. "Untainted."

Evelyn's lips curled into a predator's smile. She leaned down, bringing them eye-to-eye.

"Sebastian and I were never compatible anyway. Though I suppose intelligence is hereditary - from the mother's side."

Eleanor's composure cracked. "How dare you!"

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blazer. "Let me make one thing crystal clear, Mrs. Hart. I've never encouraged your son. We've been friends for years, but that's all we'll ever be."

Her fingers tightened around her purse. "Perhaps you should focus on convincing him to move on. For his own good."

Experience had taught her the weight of family disapproval. She'd suffered enough under the Blackwoods' contempt.

And Sebastian? Their friendship had ended the moment his feelings changed.

Evelyn snatched up The Radiant Dawn painting from the side table. "We're done here."

She ignored Eleanor's sputtered protests.

Enough tolerating everyone's nonsense.

The engine of her Aston Martin roared to life. Sebastian came sprinting from the house.

"Evelyn! At least let me drive you—"

Her tires screeched as she peeled away.

Sterling Corporation's elevator doors slid open with a vengeance.

Bennett intercepted her before she reached the office. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood is—"

"Tell him I'm unavailable."

Her assistant winced. "He's already..."

A deep voice cut through the tension. "Unavailable?"

Evelyn whirled.

Nathan Blackwood leaned against her office doorframe, his tailored suit doing nothing to soften his predatory stance.

Bennett swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood insisted on waiting outside your office rather than the lounge. If you'd let me finish—"

Evelyn didn't bother with excuses. She met Nathan's piercing gaze head-on.

"Mr. Blackwood." Her voice could frost glass. "Shall we?"
###Chapter 211 Who Defines the Rules?

Bennett held open the office door as Evelyn Sinclair strode in with effortless grace. Every movement carried an air of unshakable confidence that made lesser men shrink in comparison. The way her stiletto heels clicked against the marble floor sounded like a countdown to someone's demise.

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched as the memory surfaced unbidden—that mysterious woman in crimson at the Monaco gala years ago, her face obscured by shadows yet radiating undeniable power. The way light had spilled from the doorway behind her like liquid gold...

"Mr. Blackwood?" Bennett's polite prompt snapped him back to the present. The assistant's outstretched arm directed him into an office that smelled faintly of peonies and expensive stationery.

Evelyn's workspace was a study in contrasts—sleek modern furniture softened by whimsical touches. A marble sculpture of a panther wore a crown of fresh pink peonies today, their petals brushing against quarterly reports. Nathan's lips twitched. So this was how the Ice Queen of Sterling Corp ruled her empire.

Sinking into the plush sofa, Evelyn crossed her legs with the precision of a guillotine blade falling. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?" Her tone could freeze champagne.

Nathan's gaze darkened like storm clouds over the Pacific. "The Pacific Heights project. Have you reconsidered our partnership?"

Evelyn's manicured finger tapped the sofa armrest once. Twice. The rhythm of a chess player contemplating her next move. "You flew from New York to San Francisco for that?" Her laugh was sharper than the diamonds at her ears. "How... quaint."

The air between them crackled with unsaid words. Nathan remained statue-still, his custom Tom Ford suit failing to conceal the coiled tension in his frame. "Time is money, Evelyn. We shouldn't delay this decision."

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face as she remembered yesterday's disastrous lunch with the Harts. That simpering Victoria Ashford had been there, dripping honeyed words into Sebastian's ear while shooting Evelyn venomous glances. Coincidence? Hardly.

"Here's my offer," Evelyn said suddenly, leaning forward like a panther scenting blood. "I'll join your little project—on one condition."

Nathan's eyebrow arched a fraction. In the world of high-stakes deals, he was accustomed to dictating terms, not receiving them. Yet something about Evelyn's glacial composure made him hold his tongue.

"Victoria Ashford gets removed from the equation." Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Permanently."

The silence that followed could have been measured on the Richter scale. Nathan's expression remained impassive, but his knuckles whitened around his coffee cup. "Explain."

Evelyn swirled her espresso, watching the dark liquid cling to the porcelain. "Don't play dumb, Nathan. You only approached Sterling Corp because of our... history." She met his gaze head-on. "Consider this your one chance at redemption."

A muscle jumped in Nathan's jaw. In any other boardroom, such audacity would have gotten the speaker blacklisted from every Fortune 500 company. Yet Evelyn sat there, utterly unfazed, her Valentino-clad legs crossed as if discussing the weather.

"Why her?" Nathan finally ground out.

Evelyn's smile could have frosted the windows. "Let's just say Miss Ashford and I have different definitions of fair play." She set down her cup with deliberate precision. "So? Is your precious project worth sacrificing your golden girl for?"

The antique clock on the wall ticked like a time bomb. Outside, the San Francisco skyline glittered indifferently. Two of the most powerful CEOs in the country sat three feet apart, the fate of a billion-dollar deal hanging between them.

Finally, Nathan leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper that raised goosebumps along Evelyn's arms. "Tell me, Evelyn—since when do you believe in playing fair?"

Her laughter was colder than the fog rolling in from the bay. "Oh Nathan, darling. Whoever said anything about playing?"
###Chapter 212 The Forgotten Vows

Nathan's jaw tightened. After a brief hesitation, he gave a stiff nod. "Fine." He accepted her compensation demands without question, though implementing them would require some maneuvering.

Yet relief washed over him. If she's willing to accept my reparations, does that mean there's still hope for us? Evelyn showed no surprise at his immediate agreement.

She rose gracefully, moving behind her mahogany desk. "I'll have my legal team draft the agreement with Blackwood Enterprises."

"Let's keep this collaboration confidential for now." Nathan had been thinking the same. The project was too nascent for public scrutiny.

From Evelyn's posture, she was clearly preparing to dismiss him. With their fragile truce newly formed, he knew better than to overstay his welcome.

Nathan stood, adjusting his suit sleeves. "I should—" His words died as his gaze locked onto the bronze sculpture behind her.

His breath caught. The modernist tree sculpture was unmistakably the work of renowned Swedish artist Lars Magnusson, known for his reinterpretation of Baroque motifs.

But it wasn't the sculpture's six-figure price tag that froze his blood.

Sunlight streaming through the window caught on something dangling from one bronze branch—a diamond solitaire ring suspended by its platinum band.

His lost wedding ring.

Nathan's lungs constricted. The ring he'd mourned losing years ago... here, in Evelyn's office?

Evelyn glanced up impatiently. "Mr. Blackwood, if we're finished—" She broke off, frowning at his expression.

Nathan moved forward like a man in a trance. His lips parted soundlessly, chest heavy as if filled with lead. When his dark eyes met Evelyn's, her immediate recoil made his stomach drop.

He reached toward the paired rings—his and hers—displayed like museum pieces. Evelyn reacted like he'd drawn a weapon.

"Don't!" She shoved him back with surprising strength, making him stumble. Her icy glare kept him from approaching again.

Pain and confusion warred in Nathan's shadowed eyes. Evelyn's voice could have frosted glass. "Our business is concluded."

Every second he remained threatened to resurrect ghosts she'd buried long ago. That naive girl who'd loved Nathan Blackwood? She refused to be her anymore.

"Evelyn," he rasped, "why is my ring here?" The question tore from him. "I lost it years ago. How—"

"My ring," she corrected sharply. What had their marriage been, really? Two signatures on legal documents. She'd bought these rings herself, just as she'd borne the pain alone.

When she'd offered her heart, he'd discarded it like yesterday's newspaper. What claim did he have now?

Nathan's lips pressed into a bloodless line. Years of suppressed regret surfaced in his haunted expression. "I'm sorry." The words felt woefully inadequate.

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Save your apologies. Your signature on that contract tells me everything I need to know."

Adults settled things with contracts and compensation, not sentimental drivel. Isabella had been right—cold hard cash healed most wounds.

Nathan's gaze returned to the rings, polished to museum-quality brilliance. "How did they end up here?" The question was barely audible.

The matching bands gleamed mockingly in the sunlight, pristine as the day she'd bought them. A monument to broken promises.
###Chapter 213: The Deception Unveiled

Nathan Blackwood couldn't comprehend how his lost ring had ended up in Evelyn Sinclair's possession. Her gaze flickered briefly, betraying her reluctance to answer the question.

She had no desire to engage with Nathan any longer than necessary.

With a dismissive tone, she finally spoke.

"I assumed you already knew. Vanessa Holloway returned it to me one morning."

"She claimed you were drunk the night before and spent it at her place. You carelessly discarded the ring, so she took it upon herself to return it to me."

Evelyn would never forget that moment—the first time she had truly despaired over their marriage. The memory still carried the weight of her sorrow, anger, and helplessness.

Thankfully, she had moved past that darkness.

Now, as she studied the flicker of confusion and pain in Nathan's eyes, she scoffed inwardly.

How foolish of me to think he could ever feel anything for me.

Even if he did experience pain, it certainly wasn't because of her.

Her expression remained icy as she regarded him.

"Mr. Blackwood, you must have despised me three years ago. My gift was nothing but a burden to you. There's no need for me to return it now."

The words tasted bitter on her tongue.

"No." His voice was low, barely audible.

The emotions in his eyes fractured slightly, his body tense, the air around him turning frigid.

Nathan couldn't recall ever spending a drunken night at Vanessa Holloway's place.

This never happened.

Vanessa had lied.

A surge of fury burned through him.

That deceitful woman. I should never have shown her any kindness.

His jaw tightened as he spoke urgently.

"She's lying. I never stayed at her place. I never sought her out after drinking."

Panic clawed at him, but Evelyn only smiled faintly, indifferent.

"Is that so?"

Her disbelief was evident, though she had no interest in pursuing the matter.

The truth no longer mattered.

She didn’t care about what had—or hadn’t—happened between them back then.

Nathan’s next words lodged in his throat.

She didn’t want his explanations.

"I know you hate me," he murmured, his gaze heavy. "If there’s any way I can make it up to you, I will."

He wanted to say more, but the words wouldn’t come.

Evelyn’s lips curled in a cold, detached smile.

His words meant nothing to her.

"Your agreement to my terms is compensation enough. Once this project is finished, we’ll be even."

They would never owe each other anything again.

Without waiting for his response, she pressed the intercom.

"Bennett, please escort Mr. Blackwood out."

"Yes, Ms. Sinclair."

Her assistant arrived within seconds, knocking politely before entering.

The tension in the room was palpable, but Bennett remained professional.

"Mr. Blackwood, this way."

After Nathan left, Evelyn sat in silence, absorbing the lingering traces of his presence.

She had finally drawn a line between herself and the past she had once longed for.

Unrequited love was a lesson she had learned the hard way.

No amount of heartache would change the fact that he had never loved her.

Nathan Blackwood would never love Evelyn Sinclair.

She picked up the ring from the bronze tree branch and walked to the window.

Without hesitation, she drew back her hand—and let it fall.
###Chapter 214 On the Wrong Side

Sebastian Hart and Reginald Hart exchanged puzzled glances as Evelyn Sinclair abruptly excused herself from the gathering.

This was unlike Evelyn. She had always been the epitome of grace and decorum.

Under Reginald's intense scrutiny, Eleanor Hart finally broke down and confessed everything - about the counterfeit painting and Victoria Ashford's obvious infatuation with Sebastian.

Reginald's face darkened with fury. His daughter-in-law Eleanor had always been the perfect society wife, never causing a single scandal.

This unexpected betrayal cut deep. How could she be so foolish? Reginald immediately contacted art experts to obtain photographs of The Radiant Dawn currently displayed at the World Museum.

This masterpiece was created by Friedrich von Strauss during his artistic prime. Every brushstroke was deliberate, every hue meticulously chosen to create a breathtaking whole.

After careful consideration, von Strauss had deliberately left this work unsigned, making The Radiant Dawn his most valuable and unique creation.

Eleanor turned deathly pale as the truth dawned on her. She recalled how she had humiliated Evelyn earlier. What a colossal mistake!

But surely Victoria... Eleanor hesitated. Victoria must have meant well, right?

Reginald saw through her thoughts instantly. "That woman became CEO of Ashford Enterprises before she turned eighteen," he scoffed. "Do you really think you could handle being her mother-in-law?"

"Even if Sebastian married her - which he won't - our company would likely be swallowed by Ashford Enterprises within a year."

Eleanor's face fell. She was just an ordinary socialite - how could she possibly measure up to a powerhouse like Victoria?

"Father, I..." Eleanor's voice trembled with regret. If only she hadn't been so harsh with Evelyn.

"From now on, you will stay away from Victoria Ashford," Reginald commanded. "Business dealings with Ashford Enterprises will be handled by Sebastian and me."

"And you will find an opportunity to apologize to the Sterlings. Whether in New York or San Francisco, Sterling Corporation is our most valuable partner!"

At Sterling Corporation headquarters, Evelyn had just concluded a board meeting when Lucas Sterling called.

"The Harts sent over an entire truckload of gifts. Strange, isn't it?" Lucas remarked.

"Sebastian?" Evelyn asked in surprise. "He usually sends them directly to my office."

"No, these are from Mrs. Hart." Eleanor? Evelyn frowned slightly.

Perhaps she finally discovered the truth about The Radiant Dawn. Unfortunately, it was too late - the painting now hung proudly in her father's study.

But Evelyn wasn't truly upset about the earlier incident. She knew Victoria Ashford had orchestrated the entire situation.

Cutting ties with the Hart family would only play into Victoria's hands. Evelyn chuckled at the thought.

"Have Archibald send appropriate gifts in return," she instructed Lucas.

Just then, Bennett knocked and entered. "President, Ms. Victoria Ashford is here to see you."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched in amusement. "How prompt. Unexpected."

Victoria was no Sophia Blackwood - she wouldn't resort to tears and hysterics when cornered. This confrontation promised to be interesting.

"Show her in."

Victoria entered with the commanding presence of a queen, her cold aura filling the room. Evelyn remained seated, unfazed.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Ms. Ashford."

Victoria took the seat opposite Evelyn without waiting for an invitation. The air between the two powerful women crackled with tension.

"Would you care for some refreshments? Coffee? Tea?"

"Spare me the pleasantries," Victoria snapped, her hands slamming onto Evelyn's desk as she leaned forward. "Did you pressure Nathan Blackwood to remove me from the Pacific Heights project?"

Her piercing gaze burned with barely contained fury. "And was it you who convinced Eleanor Hart to cut all contact with me?"

The intimidating presence that had cowered countless business rivals rolled off Evelyn like water. She met Victoria's glare with calm amusement.

The battle lines were drawn.
###Chapter 215 I'm a Woman Without Morals

Hearing this, Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze with an absentminded smile. "I admit to the first one."

As for the latter, you've truly wronged me. A devilish smirk curled her lips, her eyes glinting with barely concealed amusement.

It was clear now—Victoria Ashford must have realized she'd been played.

Victoria hadn't even answered Eleanor Hart's calls? How ruthless.

Her cold, stern eyes bore into Evelyn as she pressed on.

"Who do you think you are, getting Nathan Blackwood to cut me out of that deal?" Victoria's voice was sharp with fury. "Do you have any idea how much effort I put into breaking into the San Francisco market and securing that connection?"

She hadn't bothered with small companies—she'd gone straight for Kingsley Tech.

It had taken meticulous planning to earn Nathan Blackwood's trust and approval. And yet, Evelyn had dismantled it all with just a few words.

How could Victoria not be furious?

Evelyn let out a light laugh, her expression dripping with disdain.

"Your so-called effort was telling Nathan that you could make Sebastian Hart completely give up on me?"

Victoria stiffened, shock flickering across her face.

How did she know?

The icy smile on Evelyn's lips widened.

"Ms. Ashford, your methods are truly… remarkable." Her tone was mocking. "I'm genuinely curious—where did you get the confidence that you could win over the famously fickle Sebastian Hart?"

Victoria had come prepared, armed with research on everyone's preferences and personalities. But she had overestimated herself.

If Sebastian hadn't been interested in her from the start, what made her think he would be now?

Evelyn had no intention of meddling in their affairs—but Victoria had dragged her into it.

"How do you know about that?" Victoria demanded. Nathan wasn't the type to share private conversations.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and waved it lazily.

"Funny coincidence. The night you and Nathan were talking at the Velvet Lounge, a friend of mine happened to be in the next booth."

That friend was Natalie Beaumont.

Natalie had only remembered the conversation days later and immediately called Evelyn. Everything clicked into place.

Victoria's face hardened, her composure slipping.

Even now, she refused to crumble. "I underestimated you, Evelyn."

She had assumed Evelyn was just another spoiled heiress, sheltered by her family. Even if Evelyn held power at Sterling Corporation, Victoria had thought her naive to the cutthroat nature of business.

But Evelyn had outplayed her.

"Ms. Ashford, I think you simply overestimated yourself."

Evelyn arched a brow, a soft laugh escaping her.

"You really thought a few well-placed rumors and some poison in Eleanor Hart's ear would make Sebastian marry you?"

Victoria's expression darkened at Evelyn's bluntness.

Her restraint snapped.

"Evelyn, you were in love with Nathan once. How can you not understand how I feel? I've loved Sebastian for ten years!" Her voice trembled with barely suppressed emotion. "I've watched him with other women and never cared—but with you, it's different."

Her jaw clenched, her face pale with anguish.

"The way he looks at you… If you don't love him, let him go. Why string him along? Why stop me from loving him?"

Evelyn studied Victoria's near-hysterical outburst with cool detachment.

Her gaze sharpened, a dangerous glint beneath the calm.

So that was it? Victoria resented her for this?

Evelyn couldn't help but scoff.

Was this another attempt at emotional blackmail?

She tapped a finger against the desk, her voice cutting.

"Ms. Ashford, don't bother trying to guilt-trip me. It won't work." A slow, wicked smile curved her lips. "I'm a woman without morals."

Evelyn Sinclair had never lost an argument.

And she wasn't about to start now.


###Chapter 216

Evelyn's thoughts raced. Victoria had been infatuated with Sebastian for a decade? No wonder she's been so hostile and bitter toward me.

She studied Victoria's rigid expression and felt an unexpected pang of sympathy.

While Evelyn pitied the woman, she didn't regret her actions.

Meeting Victoria's gaze squarely, Evelyn spoke firmly. "Ms. Ashford, please don't project your romantic disappointments onto me. Your unrequited feelings and Sebastian's disinterest existed long before I entered the picture. I'm not the homewrecker in this scenario, so I won't accept your misplaced blame."

Life wasn't about who could play the victim better.

Evelyn and Victoria were fundamentally different.

Both had experienced unreciprocated love, but Evelyn had fought for Nathan openly, declaring her feelings without reservation.

Victoria, meanwhile, had spent ten years pining silently for Sebastian without ever making her move.

"But he chooses you!" Victoria spat the words like an accusation.

Evelyn shook her head in exasperation. "Ms. Ashford, listen to yourself. His feelings for me aren't my fault. What exactly have I done wrong? If he doesn't return your affection, why can't you let him go?"

Why did Victoria need to invent excuses for her failed romance?

Did shifting blame onto Evelyn somehow make rejection easier to bear?

What twisted logic was that?

Evelyn had initially respected Victoria as a formidable businesswoman.

This petty, vindictive side came as an unpleasant surprise.

She had no interest in continuing this pointless conversation.

"Ms. Ashford, we're done here. If you'd like, I can arrange a meeting with Sebastian so you can express your feelings directly. We're all adults - you should be able to handle whatever outcome emerges. If there's potential, pursue it. If not, stop wasting everyone's time. What do you say?"

Evelyn believed this was the most mature solution.

Better than Victoria's current approach of covert hostility without ever knowing where she stood.

A flicker of hesitation crossed Victoria's face before vanishing. "You just want to humiliate me in front of him, don't you?"

That response told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

She shrugged, her expression cooling. "Never mind then." The woman clearly wasn't interested in reason. "Do as you please. I've extended an olive branch. You have no authority to interfere with my business operations here, and no foothold in this market."

Victoria wouldn't gain anything by staying. Evelyn's dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

New York City had no place for Victoria Ashford.

Victoria's glare turned glacial, her presence radiating dangerous intensity.

The atmosphere grew heavy with unspoken threats.

"Fine," Victoria hissed. "Don't say I didn't warn you."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, meeting Victoria's stare without flinching.

Since when had Victoria ever shown her grace?

"Bennett, please see our guest out."

Victoria departed with unsettling quietness.

Later, Bennett reported that Victoria had returned to Ashford Enterprises' headquarters in Santa Barbara.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow in surprise. "She left just like that? Unexpected... but convenient. At least I'll have some peace now."

At an upscale business cocktail party...

Evelyn arrived with Isabella, only to encounter Sebastian and his mother Eleanor.

Eleanor visibly startled upon seeing Evelyn.

Recovering quickly, she approached with outstretched hands. "Evelyn darling! I've missed you terribly. I've asked Sebastian to invite you over countless times. Why haven't you visited?"

Evelyn thought dryly, Because I prefer avoiding unnecessary drama.

Outwardly, she maintained perfect composure, offering a polished smile. "Mrs. Hart, I've been swamped with work lately. Besides, Sebastian should be focusing on his recovery."

Seeing no resentment in Evelyn's expression, Eleanor exhaled in relief.

She longed to mention The Radiant Dawn again but couldn't find the words.

Evelyn pointedly avoided the subject as well.

Left with no alternative, Eleanor swallowed her regret in silence.

After exchanging pleasantries, they moved on. When Sebastian approached, Eleanor tactfully excused herself.

Evelyn finally dropped her polite facade, rolling her eyes at Sebastian. "Had enough of playing invalid?"

Sebastian's lips curved into a roguish grin, all charm and mischief. "Miss me?"
###Chapter 217

Evelyn Sinclair cast Sebastian Hart a frosty smile.

Let him think whatever he wanted.

She had considered telling Sebastian about Victoria Ashford, but after a moment’s hesitation, she dismissed the idea. I can’t even handle my own mess.

Isabella Montgomery finished greeting the other guests and discreetly slipped over, gripping Evelyn’s wrist. "Evie, I just saw Nathan Blackwood!"

Evelyn’s brows twitched slightly. It wasn’t surprising that Nathan would be here.

Though she had no desire to see him, she wasn’t about to make a scene over it.

Isabella bit her lip and added, "My mother is forcing me to go on a blind date with the man standing next to Nathan!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her wine.

Sebastian’s eyes widened in shock.

It took them both a moment to process Isabella’s words. Isabella Montgomery—agreeing to a blind date?!

Isabella sighed. "She gave me no choice. I don’t even like him, but our families are discussing a marriage alliance."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted with worry for her best friend.

Sebastian, however, looked almost envious, nudging Evelyn with a smirk. "If only our families were this traditional. Wouldn’t that be perfect?"

"Get lost!" Evelyn and Isabella snapped in unison.

How could he joke at a time like this? Worst friend ever.

"Evie, you have to help me!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Of course I want to, but I can’t exactly march up to the elders of both families and demand they call it off, can I?"

Isabella’s eyes gleamed with mischief. She leaned in and whispered her plan.

Evelyn’s lips twitched. This girl… She wants me to publicly humiliate her blind date?!

"My reputation is already in ruins," Evelyn hissed. "And you want to drag it through the mud even more?"

Isabella tugged at her sleeve helplessly. "But who else can I ask? If it were just any woman, his family would sweep it under the rug. But you—they wouldn’t dare retaliate against you!"

Sebastian watched the two whispering, completely clueless about their scheming.

Just then, someone approached with a drink and pulled him away.

Evelyn hesitated. "But if word gets out—"

"Don’t worry, no one will secretly film you here. Just make sure people see you!"

All they needed was proof that this man was shameless enough to flirt with Evelyn Sinclair.

Isabella pleaded, and Evelyn finally relented with a clenched jaw.

"Fine! For you, I’ll play the villain."

Determined, Evelyn gathered the hem of her gown and strode in the direction Isabella had indicated.

Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore were seated with one other man across from them.

Gregory Thornton?! Evelyn froze mid-step. That man had despised her back then.

He was Isabella’s blind date?

She scanned the area but saw no one else besides the three of them.

It had to be him.

After a brief internal debate, Evelyn decided there was no way she’d let her best friend marry that snake.

He didn’t deserve Isabella.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn lifted her wineglass and glided forward with effortless grace.

Tristan noticed her approach first. He nudged Nathan excitedly, whispering, "Looks like Evelyn’s serious about burying the past. She’s actually coming over to you!"

Nathan’s gaze flickered as he watched her—elegant, poised, breathtaking.

He remained outwardly composed, though his pulse betrayed him.

In seconds, Evelyn stood before them.

"Evelyn, here for Nathan? We’ll give you two some space," Tristan said, standing and pulling Gregory up with him.

Nathan stayed seated, waiting.

Evelyn spared him only a dismissive glance before locking eyes with Gregory Thornton.

"Mr. Thornton, care for a drink?"

All three men stiffened.

Tristan gaped between Gregory and Evelyn.

Beside them, Nathan’s expression darkened, his entire demeanor turning glacial.

Gregory frowned. Though shocked by Evelyn’s identity, he wasn’t as easily intimidated as Tristan.

She had no leverage over him.

"Why would I drink with you?" he said coldly.

Tristan nodded dumbly. "Yeah, what would you two even talk about?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her smile turning sly. "Who says we need to talk? Some things are better left… unspoken."
###Chapter 218 Not a Good Person

Evelyn's words hung heavy in the air, thick with tension. Nathan's piercing gaze swept over her and Gregory, his expression darkening.

The chill radiating from him was palpable. "Evelyn, what exactly are you trying to do?" Nathan demanded, his voice low and dangerous. He had already done as she asked—removed Victoria Ashford from the project and brought Sterling Corporation into the deal.

She had called it compensation. Now that he had paid his dues, they were even.

Didn’t that mean he had the right to start fresh with her? So why was she suddenly seeking out Gregory Thornton?

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, her eyes cold as they met Nathan’s. "Mr. Blackwood, just because we’ve settled our past doesn’t mean you get to dictate my actions."

Her tone was sharp, final. They weren’t friends. He had no right to pry.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his expression turning stormy. But Evelyn had already dismissed him, turning her attention back to Gregory with a slow, deliberate smile—one that was both alluring and dangerous.

"Mr. Thornton," she purred, "shall we talk privately?"

Gregory wanted to refuse. He didn’t trust her motives.

"Evelyn," he said stiffly, "what’s your game?"

Her lips curved higher. "Isn’t it obvious? I’m interested in you."

The words hit like a shockwave. Tristan’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Evelyn was interested in Gregory? The same man who had openly scorned her during her marriage to Nathan? And what about Nathan himself?

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet as Nathan’s aura turned glacial.

Gregory froze, his face paling as if he’d just seen a ghost.

Did I do something wrong? His mind raced. Is she trying to get me killed?

Nathan had only recently forgiven him for the way he’d treated Evelyn in the past. They had just begun to mend their friendship. And now—this.

Before Gregory could react, Evelyn grabbed his arm and pulled him away.

He tried to resist, but she dragged him into the crowd, her grip unrelenting. Their struggle drew curious glances, whispers rising around them.

"Evelyn," Gregory hissed, "don’t think I’m intimidated just because you’re the Sterling heiress now. If it weren’t for Nathan—"

He cut himself off, his voice turning icy. "I’m not interested in you. Give it up."

Friendship mattered more to him than whatever game she was playing.

Evelyn laughed softly, her head dipping just enough to hide her expression from onlookers. They stood close—too close—fueling speculation.

Then, without warning, she yanked Gregory forward by his tie, bringing his face inches from hers.

His breath caught.

Her striking features, framed by that devilish smirk, were suddenly all he could see. His pulse stuttered.

In that frozen moment, she whispered, cold and precise, "Do you really think you’re special? I’m not blind. Anyone who calls Nathan Blackwood a friend can’t possibly be a good person."

Gregory’s eyes narrowed. She’s playing me.

He moved to shove her away—

But a powerful force wrenched him backward.

Gregory staggered, barely catching his balance. When he looked up, Nathan stood between them, his expression thunderous.

His voice was steel. "Since when were the two of you this close?"
###Chapter 219 Whose Side Are You On?

The entire room witnessed the tension unfolding. Gregory Thornton stood unusually close to Evelyn Sinclair, while Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened with barely contained fury.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the elite gathering. The intricate dynamics between these powerful figures never failed to fascinate.

Evelyn found Nathan's interference amusing. Who did he think he was, questioning her associations? She remained silent, arching one perfect eyebrow in silent challenge.

Gregory scrambled to explain. "Nathan, I swear there's nothing between us!" His words fell on deaf ears as Nathan refused to even glance his way.

Tristan Whitmore observed the bizarre love triangle and couldn't resist stirring the pot. "Nothing between you? You two looked pretty cozy to me." Gregory's eye twitched in irritation.

"Whose side are you on anyway?" Gregory demanded, suddenly suspicious. "Are you secretly working for Evelyn?" Tristan immediately retreated behind Nathan's imposing frame, knowing better than to challenge Gregory's military-trained physique.

Nathan's intense gaze never left Evelyn, demanding an answer she refused to give. A mischievous glint appeared in Evelyn's eyes as she finally spoke. "We've known each other three years. Of course we're close." She'd never forget how Gregory had insulted her relentlessly during that time.

Tristan nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly!" He immediately regretted it when both Nathan and Gregory turned their murderous glares on him.

At that moment, Isabella Montgomery arrived with Evelyn's ringing phone. "Evelyn darling, you have a call." Her cheerful interruption provided the perfect escape.

Evelyn seized the opportunity, grabbing her phone and striding away without another word, Isabella following closely. "Well?" Evelyn asked once they were out of earshot.

Isabella couldn't contain her excitement. "Got the perfect shot! That tie pull was absolutely iconic!" Her triumphant grin faded when she spotted Nathan approaching with stormy determination.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "At least it wasn't for nothing." Though privately, she wondered why Nathan had reacted so strongly.

The two women sought a quiet corner to review the photos, but their path took them past a group of society women heading to the restroom.

"Evelyn actually made Victoria Ashford leave? Impossible! Victoria's one of the most powerful women in Santa Barbara."

"How could someone like Evelyn possibly intimidate her?"

Sophia Blackwood's voice cut through the speculation. "Evelyn's just a petty bitch jealous of anyone more accomplished. She used her family's influence to sabotage Victoria's business dealings."

The other women nodded as if this explained everything. Sophia lowered her voice dramatically, ensuring everyone could still hear. "Want to see that arrogant witch humiliated? I have a plan."

Most looked apprehensive - their families had warned them against crossing any Sterling, especially Evelyn. Sophia scoffed. "Fine. If you're all too scared, I'll handle it myself. Just don't interfere."

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances. "Bathroom gossip never disappoints," Isabella murmured as they found a conspicuously visible seating area.

Within minutes, Sophia and her entourage appeared, immediately spotting Evelyn. Isabella leaned close. "Should we make an early exit?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "Let's have some fun first. I'm bored."

Isabella shrugged. "Someone's feeling playful tonight."

Sophia approached alone, her usual arrogance replaced with sickening sweetness. "Evelyn, I-" Isabella fake-gagged. "Sorry, reflex." She waved apologetically.
###Chapter 220 I'll Release You If You Lie

The corners of Evelyn's lips twitched involuntarily. That saccharine voice calling her name sent chills down her spine.

If she hadn't uncovered Sophia's true nature beforehand, Evelyn might have doubted her own ears. The polished young socialite before her maintained perfect poise, every gesture dripping with aristocratic refinement.

"Evelyn, I need to speak with you privately." Evelyn arched an eyebrow, swirling the crimson liquid in her crystal glass. "Whatever for?"

Sophia lowered her gaze demurely. "I've been doing some serious soul-searching lately. My past behavior was...unacceptable. I want to offer my sincerest apologies."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "How thoughtful. Why not apologize right here? Wouldn't that demonstrate greater sincerity before everyone?" Sophia's smile faltered.

She forced a brittle laugh. "Some matters...are better discussed in private." Evelyn's gaze drifted to the chandelier's reflection dancing in her wine.

The fractured light shimmering in her glass outshone the actual fixture above them. Seeing her hesitation, Sophia pressed further.

"Surely you wouldn't want our guests overhearing...personal matters concerning you and my brother?" Evelyn's eyes snapped up.

A dangerous smile curved her lips. "Lead the way." As she rose, Isabella caught her wrist with a worried frown.

Evelyn gave her hand a reassuring squeeze before following Sophia. Triumph flashed in Sophia's eyes as they reached the secluded second-floor balcony.

Moonlight filtered through rustling leaves, the Milky Way stretching across the inky sky. Sophia positioned herself strategically behind Evelyn, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

"Honestly, you and Nathan make such a perfect match. Similar social standing, compatible family backgrounds..."

She paused dramatically. "Even Grandfather has warmed to you recently. Are you truly no longer interested?"

Evelyn turned slowly, ice in her gaze. "You misunderstand completely." Her smile turned glacial. "The question isn't whether I'm worthy of your family..."

She leaned closer. "But whether your family deserves to associate with the Sterling heiress." Sophia's face contorted momentarily before smoothing into a mask.

Rage simmered beneath her carefully cultivated facade. Normally, she'd have lashed out immediately - but both her grandfather and brother had issued strict warnings about provoking Evelyn.

Yet seeing that infuriating smirk, Sophia's restraint shattered. Earlier, she'd discreetly loosened the balcony railing's screws.

The flimsy barrier would collapse at the slightest pressure. Hidden by foliage and darkness, no one would notice until it was too late.

Sophia's lips curled in a vicious smile. "Evelyn! What's that on your back?" She lunged forward with all her strength, aiming to send Evelyn tumbling over the edge.

She didn't want death - just enough pain to wipe that smug expression away forever. A crippling injury would suffice.

Imagine the humiliation of the mighty Sterling heiress sprawled on the ground below. The scandal would be worth any punishment.

But as her hands made contact, Evelyn sidestepped with unnatural grace. Momentum carried Sophia forward into empty air.

The railing gave way instantly. A scream tore from her throat as she pitched forward into nothingness.

Wind whipped past her face as panic seized her. Then - a brutal yank at her dress collar halted her descent.

Evelyn's grip was ironclad, her expression chillingly calm as she dangled Sophia over the precipice. "Did you just attempt to murder me, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia opened her mouth to deny it. Evelyn's smile turned predatory. "Careful now...I'll release you if you lie."
###Chapter 221 Reckless Without Reason

Sophia Blackwood froze in terror, her head bobbing in frantic agreement. "Y-yes, Evelyn! I'm sorry! I know it was wrong—"

Evelyn Sinclair's grip tightened.

The sickening tear of fabric split the air. For one heart-stopping second, Evelyn released her hold. Sophia shrieked as her body lurched downward—only to jerk to a stop when Evelyn's fingers clamped around her wrist again.

A cruel smile played on Evelyn's lips as she drank in Sophia's petrified expression. "Since you confessed so willingly... this is what you deserve."

Sophia's composure shattered. "HELP! SOMEONE HELP ME!"

Evelyn didn't silence her. Within moments, a crowd swarmed the balcony. Tristan Whitmore took one look and sprinted to find Nathan Blackwood.

"God, look at her dress!" Evelyn taunted, nodding at the shredded fabric barely clinging to Sophia's frame. "One good tug and everyone gets a free show. Shall we test that theory?"

Sophia's fingers scrabbled uselessly against the railing. The realization hit her—this flimsy material wouldn't survive her weight. Her screams died instantly, replaced by ragged breathing.

"You—!" Sophia's voice shook with fury. "You promised not to let go if I admitted it!"

The world tilted. How had the predator become the prey?

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Why would I save someone who just confessed to attempted murder? Tell me, Sophia—do you leave your brain at home when you scheme?"

Sophia trembled violently, her nails digging into Evelyn's arm. "Nathan will—"

"Brother! SHE'S TRYING TO KILL ME!" Sophia wailed as Nathan arrived.

Every witness turned expectantly toward the billionaire. Nathan's stormy gaze flicked between the two women—until Evelyn held up her phone with a smirk.

"Before we continue... let's settle this little misunderstanding." She tapped the screen.

Evelyn's recorded voice rang out: "Did you just try to push me, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia's panicked reply followed: "YES! I'm sorry, Evelyn! I know it's wrong—"

The crowd erupted.

"Jesus Christ, that's premeditated!"
"Who tries to murder someone at a party?!"
"Thank God Ms. Sinclair recorded it!"
"I'd have let her drop after that confession..."

Nathan's expression darkened to something lethal. He wrenched Sophia onto the balcony—only to backhand her across the face with enough force to snap her head sideways.
###Chapter 222 Intelligence Is a Blessing

The grand ballroom fell into stunned silence. The spectators hadn't anticipated this dramatic turn of events.

Nathan Blackwood's slap was brutal. He'd put his full strength behind it, showing no regard for Sophia being his own sister. Sophia collapsed onto the marble floor, her trembling fingers touching her burning cheek.

The vicious impact left her dizzy. Her entire body shook uncontrollably with shock and humiliation. For several heartbeats, she couldn't process what had happened. Pathetic. Despicable. Grotesque.

No insult seemed adequate to describe Sophia in this moment. Silent tears carved paths through her ruined makeup as she stared up at Nathan in horror.

Nathan's eyes burned with a fury she'd never witnessed before. That terrifying wrath was now directed entirely at her.

Suddenly, Sophia remembered her grandfather's warning and her brothers' repeated cautions about provoking Evelyn. Her blood ran cold. The Blackwood family might disown her completely.

They might cast her out of Highland Estates forever! The crowd's mocking, scornful gazes weighed heavily on the once-proud Blackwood heiress. Sophia had nowhere left to hide.

Under the glittering chandeliers of the opulent ballroom, Nathan's slap had echoed like a gunshot. Evelyn allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.

She had no interest in watching the remaining drama unfold. Her purpose here was accomplished. With the truth revealed, it was time to leave.

"This little performance wasn't particularly entertaining," Evelyn remarked, her voice laced with icy amusement. She flicked her wrist dismissively. "Ms. Blackwood, intelligence is a blessing you were clearly denied."

Evelyn turned on her heel. She'd shown remarkable restraint by not releasing Sophia earlier. Had she been slower to react, Evelyn could have tumbled from that balcony. Broken bones at best. Paralysis at worst.

Sophia had intended to make Evelyn the laughingstock of high society. The humiliation would have followed her for life.

But Evelyn wasn't some saint who turned the other cheek. Revenge was a dish best served precisely when deserved. Sophia's social standing lay in ruins tonight.

Her marriage prospects had likely evaporated. Every bit of this disgrace was self-inflicted. Evelyn's lips curled in contempt. "Poetic justice," she murmured to Isabella. "At least we got some entertainment tonight."

The two women touched up their makeup in the powder room before heading toward the grand entrance. The landscape lighting cast dramatic shadows across the marble steps.

"Evelyn." A deep voice called her name.

She turned instinctively to see Nathan's imposing silhouette approaching through the twilight. The glow of his cigarette tip traced elegant arcs through the darkness. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

His mesmerizing, dangerous gaze locked onto hers. Evelyn refused to recall how she'd once drowned in those eyes, helpless to escape their pull.

The entire evening had been absurd. Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Should I give you privacy?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Stay. There's nothing private about this conversation." Nathan's jaw tightened momentarily before smoothing into his usual composed expression.

"I apologize for what happened tonight," he said, his rich baritone voice carefully controlled. "She'll face consequences. And... thank you for not letting her fall."

Nathan knew Evelyn would have been justified in releasing Sophia. After countless schemes against her, Evelyn's restraint was unexpected.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dazzling smile that didn't reach her eyes. "No thanks necessary. I don't share your family's talent for shameless behavior." She always delivered her coldest words with her brightest smile.
###Chapter 223 Be a Decent Human Being

The following morning. Sophia Blackwood was whisked away from San Francisco mere hours after Nathan Blackwood brought her back to Highland Estates.

No one had a clue about her destination.

Evelyn Sinclair discovered this news while playing golf with Donovan Sterling. The private VIP country club's course was nestled amidst lush greenery.

The serene atmosphere was perfect for Donovan's favorite pastime. Since he'd been immersed in research at the National Laboratories, Evelyn hadn't seen him in weeks.

Finally carving out leisure time, Evelyn had invited Donovan for a game. Struggling with her swing, she eventually abandoned pretense and scrolled through her phone instead.

Isabella Montgomery's call interrupted her scrolling. "The gossip mill's working overtime today! Between the Sophia scandal and your little... situation with Gregory Thornton!" Isabella's gleeful chuckle carried through the line.

Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "What situation? Relax, nothing leaked. Someone issued a gag order before the banquet ended."

Isabella's knowing laugh required no explanation. Evelyn didn't inquire about the mystery benefactor. Only two men possessed both the motive and means.

Nathan Blackwood or Gregory himself. Either way, it spared her considerable hassle.

Then Isabella circled back to Sophia's disappearance.

The complete media blackout was peculiar. Isabella voiced her concern. "The Blackwoods are eerily quiet. Who knows if they're plotting revenge or sending thank-you notes? You saved her from that fall, but her reputation's beyond repair."

"Do you think Nathan will come after you?" Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. "They should worry about whether I'll come after them."

She ended the call and tossed her phone aside. The whole affair bored her.

Who was truly at fault here anyway? Resuming her golf attempts, the ball stubbornly refused the hole. The club seemed determined to mock her efforts. Donovan finally intervened to correct her stance.

To outside observers, their proximity appeared intimate. Suddenly, the temperature seemed to drop several degrees as a towering figure materialized before them.

The Sterling siblings looked up simultaneously. Nathan Blackwood stood there, his aristocratic features schooled into icy detachment as he glared at them. Donovan released Evelyn's hand with a slight frown.

"Nathan Blackwood?" Evelyn's eyes narrowed, recalling Isabella's warning. Was this a confrontation? Her gaze shifted to the entourage behind him - including a mall chain CEO. Business associates, then.

What an unfortunate coincidence.

"Why aren't you answering my calls?" Nathan's deep voice held an edge. Evelyn blinked, remembering she'd blocked him after settling the car repair bill.

Apparently, he hadn't noticed yet. Her lips curved slowly.

"Because I prefer silence to your voice." Brutal honesty. Nathan's composed mask flickered momentarily. "Evelyn, I apologize for her behavior."

Her laugh was crystalline and cold. "I've heard enough Blackwood apologies to last several lifetimes. Go play your corporate games elsewhere."

What a mood killer. Nathan's glacial stare swept over Donovan before he visibly restrained himself. Maintaining dignity before Evelyn seemed to require Herculean effort.

"Evelyn, my family owes you. Name your terms."

She tucked a stray lock behind her ear with deliberate nonchalance. "How magnanimous, Mr. Blackwood."

"Then surrender controlling interest in the Willowbrook development to Sterling Corporation."

Though a joint venture, Blackwood Enterprises had purchased the land for $50 billion. Conventional wisdom dictated they retain majority stake and decision-making authority.

For Sterling Corporation to claim dominance meant Blackwood voluntarily forfeiting billions in profits.

Nathan's dark eyes narrowed. Two seconds later: "Done."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. That fast? His generosity surprised her. Damn. Had she undersold? "Sophia must be worth her weight in gold," she mused aloud.

A polished smile surfaced. "My attorneys will draft revised contracts. Consider the Sophia matter closed." Nathan's hollowed gaze studied her.

Her transactional approach clearly irritated him. "Anything else to discuss? If not, perhaps you should educate Ms. Blackwood on basic human decency."
###Chapter 224: Who's She Performing For?

Evelyn turned her gaze toward Donovan, who was engaged in a phone conversation. The warmth in her eyes as she watched him sent an immediate chill through Nathan's entire being.

The executives trailing behind Nathan didn't recognize Donovan Sterling, but Nathan knew exactly who he was. Donovan held the distinction of being the youngest recipient ever of the prestigious Breakthrough Prize.

That record remained unbroken to this day. Operating under his pseudonym "Sunner," Donovan had effortlessly solved the most complex problem in Dominic Kingsley's research project.

Nathan hadn't seen Donovan in months and certainly hadn't expected to find him standing beside Evelyn at this particular moment.

Watching them together made his blood boil.

Nathan's dark eyes bore into Evelyn with an intensity that could melt steel. His imposing presence radiated aristocratic refinement as he stood there, every inch the untouchable billionaire.

Yet Evelyn remained utterly indifferent to his existence. Their business had been concluded, their accounts settled. They owed each other nothing now.

Donovan ended his call and approached Evelyn with a troubled expression marring his handsome features. He leaned down to murmur something in that gentle, coaxing tone he reserved only for her.

"There's an emergency at the lab. I need to head back immediately." Evelyn's face instantly clouded over. She crossed her arms, her lower lip jutting out in a dramatic pout.

"You promised me the entire day! Why do you always break your promises?" Donovan showed not the slightest irritation at her tantrum.

He patiently explained the situation, his voice soothing. "The experiment has reached a critical phase. Any delay could ruin months of work."

"Let me at least take you home first. Your apartment or the office?" Evelyn shot him an exasperated look. Nathan's looming presence already had her on edge, and she had no desire to prolong this conversation.

With a frustrated huff, she tossed her golf club aside and stormed off. Donovan calmly retrieved the discarded club before hurrying after her, his placating words floating on the breeze.

To any observer, they appeared like lovers in the midst of a lovers' quarrel.

Both could feel the icy daggers of Nathan's stare boring into their backs, yet neither turned to acknowledge him.

The executives trailing Nathan exchanged uneasy glances. They'd all recognized Evelyn Sinclair - Nathan Blackwood's infamous ex-wife - immediately.

Her apparent closeness with another man created an awkward situation none dared comment on. Provoking Nathan's wrath wasn't worth their careers.

This golf outing had taken months to arrange - a precious opportunity to discuss business with the elusive billionaire. Running into this scene made several executives wish they'd chosen a different venue.

Just as someone prepared to redirect Nathan's attention, he abruptly turned. His expression could have frozen hell over.

"Meeting's canceled." His tone brooked no argument. "We'll reschedule."

With that, Nathan strode off in the same direction Evelyn had disappeared.

He'd nearly caught up to the pair when a woman materialized directly in his path. Dripping in designer labels and enough jewelry to sink a small boat, she dramatically twisted her ankle and tumbled toward him.

"Oops!"

Nathan could have easily caught her. Instead, he took a deliberate step back, allowing her to crash unceremoniously to the ground.

The disdain in his eyes was palpable. "Are you blind?" he snapped as the woman sprawled at his feet.

Wincing in genuine pain, she forced a sickeningly sweet smile. "What an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Blackwood." Her voice oozed artificial sweetness.

With Evelyn slipping further away, Nathan glared down at the interloper. Recognition flickered across his features as he took in her face.

For just a heartbeat, he froze. Then his expression turned glacial once more.

At first glance, the woman bore a passing resemblance to Evelyn Sinclair.

But upon closer inspection, her features were all wrong.

Each element seemed artificially constructed, losing any semblance to Evelyn when combined.

Her face appeared unnaturally stiff, lacking even a fraction of Evelyn's effortless grace.

The deliberate arrangement of her plastic features created a grotesque parody of Evelyn's beauty.

Nathan Blackwood's entire demeanor turned glacial.

His piercing gaze dripped with undisguised contempt.

"Get out of my sight," he commanded through clenched teeth, his voice laced with venom.

The woman - Genevieve Dawson - forced a saccharine smile despite the rejection.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm Lydia... I mean, Genevieve. Evelyn's cousin." Her voice trembled with nervous excitement.

Gossip about Nathan and Evelyn's estrangement had spread through New York's elite circles.

With Evelyn having publicly moved on, Genevieve saw her opportunity.

She believed her surgically enhanced resemblance to Evelyn could secure her place as the next Mrs. Blackwood.

The thought of becoming the Blackwood heiress made her pulse quicken.

Nathan's expression darkened further.

His glacial stare didn't waver. "I don't give a damn who you are."

He had zero patience for this charade. "This is your final warning."

His tone could have frozen the Hudson River.

Without another glance, he strode past her toward his waiting car.

His attention remained fixed on Evelyn, who had just entered Donovan Sterling's vehicle.

Evelyn's gaze flickered briefly toward the scene before deliberately looking away.

Inside the car, Donovan frowned. "Isn't that Genevieve Dawson? Who's she performing for?"

His lip curled in distaste. "That staged stumble was painfully obvious."
###Chapter 225 Utterly Revolting

Evelyn let out a derisive snort.

No matter what anyone said, Genevieve might be their cousin, but there was no blood relation between them.

Charles Sterling was William Sterling's younger brother and Evelyn's uncle.

Genevieve's mother, Margaret, was Charles's mistress and had Genevieve from a previous marriage.

This mother-daughter duo had been living under Charles's roof for years.

Though there was no official marriage between Charles and Margaret, she was essentially his second wife.

But that had nothing to do with Evelyn's family. They had never cared about Charles's personal affairs.

Sterling Corporation had been built from the ground up by William Sterling alone—Charles had no hand in it.

Still, out of familial obligation, William had entrusted Charles with their Charleston operations.

Even after two years of losses, William never held Charles accountable.

He simply considered it the price of keeping the peace.

Charles had brought Genevieve into Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch and installed her as a top executive.

To outsiders, Genevieve was a Sterling.

She used the Sterling name to mingle in high society, but her status was worlds apart from Evelyn's.

Genevieve had always tried to ingratiate herself with Evelyn, but Evelyn couldn’t care less.

She copied Evelyn’s mannerisms, her wardrobe, even her expressions—desperate to pass herself off as a true Sterling.

But the rest of the family knew better.

Who would’ve thought Genevieve would show up at the golf course today?

After dropping Donovan off, Evelyn was about to head back to the office when she got a message from Lucas.

Come home. There’s a show you won’t want to miss.

The cryptic message piqued her curiosity.

If Lucas said it was worth seeing, it had to be entertaining. Without hesitation, Evelyn sped back to Sterling Manor.

William was in the garden with Archibald, examining the flowers.

When Archibald spotted Evelyn, he immediately stood and greeted her.

"Miss, you're back!"

Evelyn smirked, twirling her car keys. "Dad, bored of fishing already? Taking up gardening now?"

William rolled his eyes and jerked his chin toward the house.

Evelyn arched a brow.

Who could possibly make Chairman Sterling flee to the garden?

Just as she was about to step inside, the unwelcome guests emerged.

"Evelyn! Finally! Your sister and I have been waiting forever!"

A woman with a sickly sweet smile stood in the doorway, oozing false warmth.

Evelyn froze when she saw Margaret standing there. Her smile vanished instantly.

Honestly, she had zero interest in entertaining this mother-daughter pair.

Yet they insisted on forcing their way into her life, acting like they belonged.

So this was why William had fled to the garden.

Evelyn scoffed internally. This is my house. Why should we be the ones avoiding them?

She forced a polite smile as she approached Margaret. "Is there an issue with Uncle Charles's company?"

"Oh no, everything’s fine!" Margaret simpered. "We’re family, so I brought your sister to visit!"

She beckoned Genevieve forward.

Genevieve stood there, playing the part of the demure, obedient girl.

"Hi, Evelyn."

Evelyn didn’t respond.

The memory of Genevieve deliberately stumbling in front of Nathan Blackwood at the golf course flashed in her mind.

The way she had batted her lashes, so fake, so pathetic.

Disgusting.

Genevieve wasn’t acting like that now, of course.

Evelyn breezed past them into the house.

A maid immediately rushed over, taking her bag and kneeling to help her change shoes.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Lucas, lounging in the living room with a cup of coffee.

"Lucas, why aren’t you at the office? I heard Dominic wants to promote some new engineers."

Lucas gave her a lazy glance. "Can’t a man retire early?"

Evelyn snorted, about to fire back when Margaret cut in.

"Evelyn, I heard you took over the company! Congratulations!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "Thanks."

"You’re so impressive!" Genevieve gushed, eyes shining with envy. "Father says I should learn from you!"

Evelyn paused for two beats before replying, "Is that so? Uncle Charles flatters me."

She knew damn well Charles would never praise her.

Margaret hurried to agree. "Yes! That’s why I brought Genevieve—so she can assist you at the company and learn!"

Evelyn stiffened, her frown deepening.

This woman had some nerve.
###Chapter 226 She's Not Qualified

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers tightening around her wine glass.

Margaret Dawson leaned forward, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "It doesn't have to be anything major, darling. Just a simple managerial role would suffice."

Her lips curled into a saccharine smile. "After all, we're family. You wouldn't deny your own sister an opportunity, would you?"

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

The sheer audacity. How dare Margaret waltz in here and demand an executive position? Before Evelyn could respond, Lucas Sterling let out a sharp, mocking laugh.

His voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Haven't you done enough damage to Uncle Charles's company? Now you want to leech off Sterling Corp too?" He smirked. "We don't tolerate parasites here."

Evelyn's lips twitched.

Well played, little brother. When had he learned to be so brutally eloquent?

Margaret's face turned to stone. Lucas's words had struck a nerve—too direct, too disrespectful.

She was accustomed to flaunting her self-proclaimed status as the "Second Lady of the Sterling family," basking in the unearned prestige. Everyone in their circles knew she was Charles Sterling's longtime mistress, but she carried herself like a legitimate wife.

"Lucas!" Margaret hissed. "How dare you speak to me like that? Genevieve is your cousin!"

Lucas pointed at Evelyn without hesitation. "She's my sister. You two? You're just background noise."

Margaret's face flushed crimson. She whirled toward Evelyn, desperation creeping into her voice. "Evelyn, you're in charge now. Surely arranging a position for Genevieve wouldn't be difficult?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her wine, letting the silence stretch. Then she smiled—a cold, calculated curve of her lips.

"It's not impossible," she said lightly.

Margaret's shoulders relaxed—until Evelyn continued.

"Sterling Corp holds annual executive recruitment drives. If Genevieve truly has the qualifications, she's welcome to submit an application like everyone else."

The room went dead silent.

Margaret's nostrils flared. "Why the ridiculous formality? Just say the word! She's family—must you be so petty?"

Genevieve nodded eagerly, her doe eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Exactly! I only want to learn the business, Evelyn."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Business is learned at business school, Genevieve. Every position at Sterling Corp carries weight. Given your... limited skill set, I doubt you'd last a week."

Genevieve's face crumpled. She bit her lip, turning tearful eyes toward her mother.

Margaret looked like she'd been slapped. The sight almost made Evelyn laugh.

"You—!" Margaret's voice rose to a shrill pitch. "You're deliberately humiliating us! Don't forget, we're Stantons too!"

Her finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "You're the disgrace here, with your scandals plastered across every tabloid! Who do you think you are?"

The temperature in the room plummeted. Lucas set down his phone, his playful demeanor vanishing.

At that moment, William Sterling strode in—his expression dark. He'd clearly been listening from the hallway.

Seizing the opportunity, Margaret pounced. "William! Your children are beyond disrespectful! All I asked was a simple favor for Genevieve. Who do they think they are?"

William's face was thunderous. He'd heard enough.

His voice was ice. "This isn't some back-alley negotiation, Margaret. Watch your tongue."

Margaret flinched, her bravado crumbling. "W-We're family," she stammered. "Must everything be so formal?"

Genevieve rushed to intervene. "Uncle William, Mother didn't mean it like that—"

"Family?" William's laugh was brutal. "You're a mistress and her illegitimate child. That doesn't make you Sterlings."

The words landed like a guillotine.

Years ago, Charles's wife had fallen gravely ill after discovering his affair with Margaret. She never recovered.

William had severed ties with Charles afterward, only maintaining business connections out of necessity. He'd made one thing clear: if Charles ever married Margaret, he'd lose all rights to the Charleston branch.

So Margaret remained a mistress—for over a decade. Unacknowledged. Unwanted.

Yet she'd spent years masquerading as a Sterling, until today—when William ripped the facade away.

Genevieve's eyes welled with furious tears. "That's not fair! My parents have been together for years! You're the one who forced them to stay unmarried!"

William's gaze could have frozen hell. "Know your place. You don't speak unless spoken to."

The unspoken truth hung heavy:

In this world of old money and power, blood mattered.

And Genevieve Dawson would never be a Sterling.
###Chapter 227 Could Evelyn Possibly Be Mistaken?

Evelyn and Lucas knew the truth all too well.

They had only held back from mocking this mother-daughter pair out of respect for their uncle Charles.

William had always been fiercely protective of his family. Genevieve had crossed the line, especially here at Sterling Manor. She'd brought this upon herself.

Her face now looked rigid and unpleasant.

Burning with indignation, she'd tried playing the family card but ended up losing everything instead.

Even the maids were snickering at her.

Genevieve couldn't tolerate it any longer. Fury consumed her.

William, Evelyn, and Lucas's condescending attitudes made Genevieve's face flush crimson with rage.

They had thoroughly provoked her.

"Hmph! If not for you people, Charles would have married me ages ago!" she spat. "I'm only in this situation because of your interference! Who do you think you are to insult me like this?"

Evelyn gave the mother-daughter pair a cold glance before laughing derisively.

"Once a homewrecker, always a homewrecker."

"You should stay in the gutter where you belong. Not just anyone can marry into the Sterling family," she continued icily. "If you somehow managed to wed Uncle Charles, the media would expose your sordid past. Then the world would know you're nothing but a mistress who clawed her way up."

A meaningful smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Better to remain Charles's little secret if you want to keep your comfortable life."

"Know your place, and don't provoke those far beyond your station."

Seeing Genevieve's ashen face, Evelyn felt immense satisfaction.

Genevieve had asked for this humiliation. Clenching her teeth, the woman shrieked, "Evelyn, how dare you threaten me? You're the one who married Nathan Blackwood and ruined your own reputation!"

"Why don't you mention how you've disgraced the Sterling name? Do you think your current position lets you look down on everyone?" Genevieve braced herself, expecting Evelyn to strike her so she could retaliate.

Instead, an icy malice filled the air.

Even the observing maids glared at Genevieve with righteous anger. Evelyn's eyes narrowed, turning dark and fathomless.

A terrifying silence descended. With each deliberate step Evelyn took toward her, Genevieve felt overwhelmed by the younger woman's commanding presence.

Margaret gulped, glancing between William and Lucas. Both men looked ready to skin her alive.

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable.

"Ms. Dawson," Evelyn said calmly, her voice deceptively light, "are you truly naive enough to believe you can insult me without consequence? For what you've said today, you'll never be connected to the Sterling family again."

This was a direct threat. Evelyn's words struck fear into them. As William's publicly announced successor, Evelyn held absolute authority over who remained in the Sterling family circle.

Margaret momentarily panicked.

Her hands clenched so tightly at her sides that her nails drew blood from her palms.

"Evelyn, my mother just speaks without thinking," Margaret hurried to explain. "She didn't mean it. You're magnanimous—please don't take it to heart." Though inwardly seething at Evelyn's arrogance, Margaret dared not openly offend the heiress.

She knew Evelyn had every right to make such declarations.

Evelyn's expression was icy, her lips pressed into a thin line of disdain. She had no patience left for these two conniving women.

"What a colossal waste of my time." Her voice cut through the tense air like shards of glass. "Archibald, escort them out immediately."

The butler moved with practiced efficiency, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor as he approached the unwelcome guests.

Genevieve trembled visibly, her resentment warring with primal fear. Even in her fury, she knew better than to challenge Evelyn directly. Her manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"You're all just a bunch of arrogant snobs!" Margaret spat, her shrill voice echoing through the grand foyer. "Mark my words - I wouldn't set foot in this wretched place again even if you begged me!"

With that dramatic declaration, she grabbed Genevieve's arm and stormed out, her stiletto heels striking the floor like gunshots.

The moment they crossed the threshold of Sterling Manor, Genevieve whipped out her phone with shaking fingers.

"Evelyn blocked our access to the company," she hissed into the receiver, her voice dripping with venom.

Upstairs, William Sterling's rage was palpable. Both Lucas and Evelyn could feel the tension radiating from him as he marched to his study and slammed the door with enough force to rattle the portraits on the walls.

The household staff froze in place, barely daring to breathe. Evelyn arched an eyebrow at her brother. "And you call this entertaining?"

Lucas merely shrugged, his boyish grin at odds with the tense atmosphere. "I found it rather... enlightening."

A derisive snort escaped Evelyn's lips. "Next time they show up, have security turn them away at the gates," she instructed Archibald coolly.

There was no point pretending civility anymore. These social climbers weren't worth a single moment of her consideration. Let them choke on their pathetic schemes.
###Chapter 228: How Did You Warn Him?

Archibald gave a knowing nod. "By the way, Miss Sinclair, your birthday is approaching. Any special plans?"

Had he not brought it up, Evelyn would have completely forgotten.

Her birthday was indeed just around the corner.

Evelyn laughed softly, turning to Lucas. "The celebration itself doesn't matter. What's important is my gift, right, Lucas?"

Lucas visibly paled at the reminder of the $2.8 billion he'd already spent on her.

What was a little more? Archibald chuckled at Lucas's expression. Initially, Evelyn hadn't wanted any grand celebration.

But after the incident with Genevieve and Margaret, William Sterling had insisted on making it an extravagant affair.

Sterling Corporation Headquarters

Evelyn had just stepped out of a board meeting when she spotted Alexander's stormy expression as he marched toward the elevators.

She frowned. It was rare to see her brother this furious. Without hesitation, she quickened her pace to catch up. "Alexander, what's wrong?"

His features softened slightly, but his voice remained icy. "Nothing major. Uncle Charles was making trouble, so I dealt with it."

Evelyn blinked. "Dealt with it? How exactly? Is he trying to plant someone in our company again?"

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted in a cold smirk. "Worse. He's attempting to infiltrate our shareholders' meeting. He's been privately negotiating to buy Sterling Corporation shares from several minority holders."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "After we refused to give Genevieve that executive position last time... Are they trying to use her as a mole?"

Alexander let out a derisive snort, his eyes glacial. "A fool's fantasy."

"Then how did you handle it?" Evelyn pressed, genuinely curious now.

His smirk widened. "Since he's so eager to buy shares, he must have come into money unexpectedly. I had our auditors freeze all his accounts in Charleston."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. That was brilliantly ruthless! Alexander reached out to tap her forehead lightly. "Focus on your birthday preparations instead. Use this event to strengthen our business alliances."

Blackwood Enterprises

Tristan Whitmore burst into Nathan's office like an excited puppy, with Harrison barely managing to trail behind.

Nathan's brows knitted together as he fixed Tristan with an unamused stare. "Do you live here now?"

Tristan merely grinned, sauntering over with exaggerated casualness. He waved an elegant cream-colored invitation embossed with the Sterling family crest—a mark of undeniable prestige.

"Evelyn's birthday is tomorrow," he announced smugly. "Since you clearly didn't receive an invitation, I generously procured one for you."

Nathan's gaze instantly turned arctic. Harrison instinctively shrunk back, staying silent.

No invitations had been sent from Sterling Corporation. Harrison had deliberately avoided mentioning it to spare his boss the embarrassment. Nathan's expression grew thunderous.

Evelyn's birthday? He still didn't even know the exact date. The realization that he'd been such a neglectful husband made his chest constrict painfully.

Tristan, oblivious to the storm brewing, clapped Nathan on the shoulder. "Aren't I the best wingman? What's with the long face? Don't want to go? Suit yourself—"

Harrison stood frozen, internally screaming. Since when did Mr. Whitmore have a death wish?!

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet. Nathan's glare could have turned Tristan to stone.

After an unbearably tense silence, Tristan cleared his throat and slid the invitation across the desk. "Look, just come with me. I can't face that lion's den alone."

Nathan picked up the card mechanically. Tomorrow evening. So her birthday was tomorrow. His heart gave an odd lurch.

When he finally looked up, Tristan was studying him with far too much amusement. Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"Didn't your father want that Pacific Heights development?" Nathan asked coolly.

Tristan's eyebrows shot up. "Wait, are you saying—"

"Billions for an invitation seems excessive," Nathan mused, straightening his cuffs. "Unless you're not interested..."

"I'll take it!" Tristan yelped.
###Chapter 229 Nathan Blackwood's Gift

The Regal Grand Hotel glittered under the night sky, its grand facade illuminated by thousands of twinkling lights. The cream of society had gathered for Evelyn Sinclair's birthday celebration - an event that had been the talk of Manhattan for weeks.

William Sterling had spared no expense for his beloved daughter. The entire five-star hotel had been booked exclusively for the occasion, with security personnel stationed at every entrance and exit. The surrounding streets were cordoned off, creating a private sanctuary for the elite guests.

Inside, crystal chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors. A massive digital display outside showcased Evelyn's portrait - her piercing gaze and flawless features capturing the essence of modern royalty. "Happy Birthday Evelyn Sinclair" trended across social media platforms, with sponsored posts appearing every few seconds.

This extravagant affair surpassed even Sterling Corporation's annual gala in scale and opulence. It was William's way of showing the world just how much his daughter meant to him.

In the VIP lounge, Evelyn sat surrounded by her closest friends - Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont. With no prying eyes around, they relaxed in comfortable intimacy.

Before them lay a dazzling array of jewelry from Laurent Dubois' latest collection. Diamonds, rubies, and sapphires sparkled under the ambient lighting, their brilliance reflecting off the mirrors. The air itself seemed charged with luxury.

Evelyn wore a form-fitting black Versace gown that accentuated her slender frame. The simplicity of the dress only highlighted her natural elegance - her porcelain skin glowing against the dark fabric. She possessed an innate nobility that required no adornment, yet...

Isabella and Natalie gasped as they examined the jewelry collection William had sent up. It looked like every rare gemstone in New York had been gathered here. Evelyn tried on ring after ring, her slender fingers adorned with glittering treasures.

The flawless white diamonds. The rare pink stones. The mysterious black diamonds - each more breathtaking than the last. Evelyn sighed dramatically, waving her bejeweled hands at her friends.

"Such a tragedy I can't wear them all at once! They're all absolutely perfect." Isabella rolled her eyes while Natalie chuckled at her friend's dramatics.

After careful consideration, Evelyn selected three statement rings. Against all fashion conventions, the multiple pieces didn't overwhelm her delicate hands. Instead, they complemented her bold personality - extravagant yet refined. Isabella gave an approving nod.

"Showtime," Evelyn announced, checking her diamond-encrusted watch. As they exited, a phalanx of bodyguards snapped to attention. The highly trained security detail formed an impenetrable barrier around their charge.

Their synchronized footsteps echoed through the hallway as they approached the grand staircase. Below, the ballroom glittered like a jewel box, the assembled guests turning as one when Evelyn appeared at the top.

Her breathtaking beauty combined with her cool confidence created an electric presence. William Sterling's chest swelled with pride as he ascended to escort his daughter down.

Though Donovan Sterling couldn't attend, his generous gift - unlimited access to his private jet and bank accounts - had arrived days earlier. Alexander and Lucas Sterling stood at attention on either side of the staircase, their handsome features and commanding presence drawing admiring glances.

William accepted a champagne flute from a passing waiter and raised it for a toast. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my daughter Evelyn's birthday celebration! In my life, my greatest achievement isn't building Sterling Corporation... it's being father to this remarkable woman."

His voice caught slightly. Those three years when Evelyn had left home still haunted him - the sleepless nights worrying if she was safe, if she was happy. Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she understood her father's unspoken emotions.

Then, in the crowd below, she spotted him - Nathan Blackwood, standing apart from the others, his intense gaze fixed solely on her.
###Chapter 230 Nathan Blackwood's Gift

Nathan Blackwood stood with an air of regal authority, his striking features commanding attention effortlessly.

His magnetic presence dominated the space. Nathan was born to lead, effortlessly controlling any environment he entered. His intense gaze remained fixed on Evelyn.

This wasn't his first time witnessing her radiance, yet each encounter left him profoundly affected in new ways.

Tonight, beneath his composed exterior, an unfamiliar nervousness stirred.

When their eyes locked, the world seemed to pause. Silence enveloped them. Nathan became deaf to all external sounds. But Evelyn broke the connection after mere seconds.

What's he doing here? After William concluded his speech, guests swarmed forward with birthday wishes. Evelyn responded gracefully to each well-wisher.

Isabella and Natalie approached, but before Evelyn could relax, she sensed Nathan moving toward her with undeniable purpose. Her breath caught.

Without preamble, Nathan spoke first when he reached her. "Ms. Sterling, I've brought three gifts for you. Would you care to see them?" As always, Nathan commanded attention wherever he went, and now dozens of eyes turned their way.

Three imposing bodyguards stood behind him, each holding an exquisite velvet case. Evelyn's brow furrowed.

Her earlier joy evaporated instantly. Three gifts? Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Mr. Blackwood's generosity knows no bounds!" "Three presents at once?" Evelyn's lips curled in silent derision.

She wanted nothing from Nathan - would gladly throw them in his face! Was this just another public performance to force her acceptance? She glared at the boxes, jaw tightening.

Noting the tension, Natalie stepped forward with forced cheer. "Let's see what they are first. Evelyn can always decline if they're not to her taste."

Isabella whispered in Evelyn's ear, "If they're valuable, we can sell them! Never turn down money!" Evelyn's lips twitched.

"Fine, let's take a look." Curious onlookers pressed closer, eager to witness Nathan's extravagant offerings.

Nathan stood motionless under the chandelier's glow, his tall frame radiating cool detachment.

Evelyn opened the first case carelessly, then froze. Inside lay an extraordinary diamond necklace of ancient Roman design, its craftsmanship breathtaking.

A massive sapphire-blue diamond sat in intricate silver filigree, shimmering with ethereal beauty. The piece seemed to carry centuries of history within its facets.

The timeless design and flawless materials made its value incalculable.

Evelyn's pupils dilated. Though she'd seen rare gems worldwide, none compared to this masterpiece.

Natalie gasped. "Is that...the legendary royal jewel? The Sapphire Tear?" Recognition dawned on Evelyn.

She'd admired this piece in magazines years ago. The European royal family had treasured it in their private collection, never displaying it publicly.

An utterly priceless artifact. Yet it had disappeared years ago, purchased anonymously for a record sum.

That buyer was Nathan? And now he's giving it to me? Evelyn thought incredulously.

"Evie, does Nathan need another ex-wife?" Isabella murmured, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'd volunteer if someone gave me this!"

Evelyn shot her a withering look. "You'd have to donate pints of blood weekly and endure constant suffering. Still interested?" Isabella recoiled.

"On second thought..." Nathan observed their exchange silently, eyes narrowing. The crowd continued marveling at the Sapphire Tear's magnificence.

Such treasures transcended monetary value. What fortune to witness this marvel firsthand! And this was merely Nathan's first gift.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, "isn't this excessively extravagant?" She hadn't anticipated this.

Nathan's dark gaze deepened. "It suits you perfectly," he said quietly. Evelyn blinked, momentarily thrown.

What does that mean? Natalie nudged her eagerly. "Next one!"
###Chapter 231 The Proposal Plan

Three velvet boxes sat gleaming under the chandelier lights. The guests buzzed with anticipation as Evelyn Sinclair reached for the second box, her fingers trembling slightly.

Inside lay a pristine white cashmere beanie.

The minimalist design held no embellishments, yet Evelyn recognized it instantly. This was from XN's exclusive winter collection two years prior - a piece that had sold out within hours.

Isabella Montgomery scoffed loudly. "Seriously? I own this exact hat. It's practically vintage at this point. How unimaginative, Mr. Blackwood."

Natalie Beaumont studied the gift thoughtfully without comment. Evelyn's breath hitched as memories flooded back.

With determined movements, she opened the final box. Nestled in black satin was a jade bangle of extraordinary quality.

The translucent green stone shimmered with inner fire, its flawless surface carved with intricate motifs. This was no ordinary trinket - its value easily surpassed nine figures, dwarfing the combined worth of every other present in the room.

One diamond necklace. One jade bracelet. Nathan Blackwood's generosity knew no bounds.

Evelyn's posture stiffened.

Against her will, the past came rushing back. Their first anniversary - she'd given him a watch, he'd reciprocated with diamonds. Their second Christmas - her knitted scarf met with this very hat. The third occasion never happened... until today.

Was this his way of settling old debts? Scars she'd thought healed suddenly throbbed anew.

Her chest constricted as bitterness rose in her throat. That infuriating man always knew how to unravel her composure.

"Ms. Sinclair, you're truly blessed!" Victoria Ashford's saccharine voice cut through her thoughts. "Two magnificent gifts from Mr. Blackwood himself. Clearly destiny favors your reunion."

Evelyn's glacial stare silenced the room. "Selling my dignity for jewelry, Victoria? How... quaint of you." She snapped the boxes shut with deliberate calm. "I'll accept these... graciously."

The crowd gaped at her nonchalance. The dynamic between Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood remained society's greatest enigma.

To receive such extravagant gifts from an ex-husband should have been mortifying. Yet Evelyn carried herself with regal indifference that commanded respect.

As she turned to leave, Isabella grabbed her elbow urgently. "Evie! Sebastian's coordinating some elaborate setup with the staff. Roses everywhere!" She lowered her voice. "I think he's planning to propose!"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. That did sound like Sebastian's dramatic flair. But why hadn't he consulted her first? And what was Natalie's role in all this?

Natalie warned me to prepare you for this. Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically at Sebastian's audacity.

This wasn't some petty disagreement. They needed to establish clear boundaries immediately. Understood?

If Sebastian dares cause trouble here tonight, my father and brother will make him regret it! Evelyn's voice dripped with icy confidence.

Whatever game Sebastian was playing, tonight's celebration had to proceed flawlessly. Isabella arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow in agreement.

A sudden commotion erupted outside, instantly capturing everyone's attention.

"Fireworks!" someone gasped in delight. All heads turned toward the panoramic windows.

The night sky exploded with color as massive fireworks detonated in perfect synchronization. Vibrant hues painted the heavens, transforming darkness into a canvas of shimmering light.

As the display continued, the patterns morphed from intricate floral designs into something more astonishing - a woman's face. The image showed flowing chestnut hair, piercing emerald eyes, and lips curved in a knowing smile. Every feature had been rendered with breathtaking precision.

The crowd murmured in growing recognition. "Isn't that... President Sinclair?" a guest finally voiced what everyone was thinking.

"It's definitely her!" Evelyn's initial awe twisted into shock. The dazzling illumination revealed her stunned expression as the fireworks continued their spectacular show across the entire city skyline.

Evelyn's birthday celebration now literally lit up the metropolis. Three extravagant gifts from Nathan had already been presented. So who could possibly be responsible for this breathtaking display if not him?
###Chapter 232 Don't You Dare Kneel

All eyes were fixed on Evelyn Sinclair, the beloved daughter of the Sterling family, filled with envy and admiration.

Alexander Sterling smiled warmly as he approached his sister.

Evelyn turned her head slightly, raising an eyebrow. "Was this part of the program? I don't recall this being scheduled."

Alexander maintained his composed demeanor. "Of course not." Then his gaze shifted slightly.

He noticed a man descending the grand staircase across the room. His tone lightened. "But I believe I know who arranged this."

"Who?" Evelyn followed his line of sight.

Her body tensed immediately. Sebastian Hart stood there in a custom-tailored tuxedo, his devilish smile radiating undeniable charm.

In his hands, he carried an enormous bouquet of delicate roses - their meaning unmistakable. His gaze burned with intense affection as he moved toward Evelyn.

Evelyn felt her pulse quicken. It was too late to escape now. A tingling sensation ran down her spine.

The crowd began murmuring excitedly.

Tonight's events kept getting more dramatic. First Nathan Blackwood's extravagant gifts, now this from the Hart family's second son.

The surprises weren't over. Across the room, Victoria Ashford watched the scene unfold, her face draining of color. All attention was focused on Sebastian.

Maintaining perfect composure, Evelyn stood her ground as he approached.

Her eyes flickered with warning. Sebastian moved closer, his expression betraying nervousness. The entire room held its breath.

This had all the makings of a proposal! "Is Sebastian Hart really going to propose? What a shock! But didn't Nathan Blackwood just show his interest with those gifts? Both men are incredible catches."

"I wonder who Evelyn will choose." When Sebastian finally reached her, Evelyn could no longer remain passive.

She felt hundreds of eyes watching, including Nathan's piercing gaze from the crowd. His icy stare sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn stepped forward gracefully, meeting Sebastian with a polite smile.

As he raised the bouquet, she swiftly interrupted in a voice only he could hear, laced with quiet threat: "If you dare kneel, I'll break both your knees."

Sebastian froze. The joy in his eyes evaporated, replaced by gloomy disappointment.

"Hmph! Just as I suspected - Sebastian came to ruin my party," Evelyn thought.

"Mr. Hart!" A trembling female voice cut through the tension.

Victoria Ashford, CEO of Ashford Enterprises, stepped forward. "Aren't you taking this joke too far?" Everyone knew Sebastian only had eyes for Evelyn.

Victoria, who usually hid her feelings so well, had finally lost her composure - a shocking sight indeed.

Sebastian seemed startled.

He hadn't even noticed Victoria's presence. Her words fell on deaf ears as he reluctantly spoke under the crowd's intense scrutiny: "Happy birthday, Evelyn. Wishing you... all the best."

Lucas Sterling burst into laughter. "'All the best'? That's quite the birthday wish!" Alexander shot him a silencing glare.

The crowd waited with bated breath... but nothing more happened. Evelyn accepted the bouquet with a satisfied smile.

"Thank you, I appreciate the gift." Sebastian lowered his head, hiding his disappointment. Lucas quickly diverted everyone's attention while Evelyn seized Sebastian's sleeve and pulled him away, oblivious to Victoria's mixed expression of frustration and relief.

When they reached a private room, Evelyn released him. "Sebastian Hart, what the hell were you thinking?"

The usually playful Sebastian looked uncharacteristically sincere, clearly hurt by her reaction - though not devastated. This was only the beginning. "I wanted to surprise you!" Unfortunately, Evelyn had seen through his plan immediately.

Today would have been perfect... what a waste. "Surprise? You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Evelyn glared at him, crossing her arms.

Their close friendship allowed for blunt honesty. She wasn't trying to embarrass him, but the outcome he'd hoped for was impossible.

Sebastian's charming smile returned, dazzling as ever. "You stopped me this time, but don't expect me to be so obedient next time."

Evelyn's temper flared. "Hart, I'm nothing like your usual type. Why this sudden obsession?" All his exes had been sweet, docile girls - completely opposite to Evelyn's strong personality.

Was he just looking for something different? Sebastian paused before laughing. "How could they compare to you? None of them ever truly moved me."

Evelyn had no interest in his romantic history. She raised a hand to stop him. "I don't care about your dating life. After all these years, we can only ever be friends."

"You're jealous!" Sebastian declared confidently, eyes shining.

Evelyn was speechless. How could she deflate his ego without crushing him completely? She tossed her hair back. "Forget it. I'm going back downstairs."

But as she turned, Sebastian grabbed her arm. "Your zipper's undone..."
###Chapter 233 An Unexpected Interruption

Sebastian Hart's sharp eyes caught the unzipped back of Evelyn Sinclair's evening gown. The exposed expanse of flawless skin and delicate shoulder blades was utterly mesmerizing.

Her cascading dark tresses had initially concealed the wardrobe malfunction. But when she tossed her hair moments ago, Sebastian spotted the revealing slip.

Evelyn froze mid-step, turning with startled eyes. Sebastian was already moving to fasten her dress.

The lounge door swung open abruptly.

"Oh my! I'm so sorry for interrupting your intimate moment with Mr. Hart, Evelyn."

That sickeningly sweet voice was unmistakable. Genevieve Dawson. Evelyn's icy glare swept over the intruder. "Are you visually impaired? Which part of this looks intimate to you?" Sebastian released Evelyn with a derisive snort.

"Who is this delusional woman?" Genevieve bit her lip dramatically before fully opening the door. She wasn't alone. Nathan Blackwood's imposing frame blocked the doorway.

The CEO's towering silhouette swallowed the hallway light. His frigid aura permeated the space as obsidian eyes burned into the pair.

Genevieve's gaze darted between them. "I'm Genevieve, Evelyn's stepsister. My apologies - I must have misinterpreted the situation." Her voice dripped with false contrition. "When I saw Mr. Hart adjusting your dress, I assumed..."

Evelyn tore her attention from Nathan to level Genevieve with a glacial stare. "Assumed what exactly? Your mind seems exceptionally filthy. Quite telling of your own experiences."

Genevieve's face twisted in outrage.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic attempt at playing innocent." She turned to Nathan. "I merely spilled wine on Mr. Blackwood and brought him to change. I had no idea you'd be... occupied here." Her lips trembled with manufactured distress.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the burgundy stain marring Nathan's tailored jacket. The "accident" seemed conveniently timed.

"Then it appears we're the ones intruding. Sebastian, shall we?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Unless you'd prefer to stay for the upcoming performance?"

Sebastian offered his arm with princely grace. As they approached the exit, Genevieve scrambled aside. Nathan remained rooted like an immovable monolith.

His stormy expression darkened further. Evelyn met his gaze defiantly.

"What exactly do you mean by 'performance,' Ms. Sinclair?" Nathan's voice could frost glass.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved. "Precisely what you're imagining." Her mocking gaze shifted to Genevieve's twitching face. "Of all guests here tonight, how fortuitous that my stepsister chose to douse you, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's jaw clenched. Genevieve blanched. "It was an accident! Evelyn, why must you humiliate me?"

"Humiliation implies effort on my part. You accomplish that quite effortlessly yourself." Evelyn dismissed her with a wave.

Nathan hadn't budged. His cologne - bergamot and sandalwood - mingled with the sharp tang of spilled wine as Evelyn stepped closer.

Her manicured finger traced the stained fabric. "You should change quickly, Mr. Blackwood." Her suggestive tone hung between them.

Nathan's hand shot out, capturing her wrist. Before she could react, he'd maneuvered her into the adjacent room.

The door slammed. Evelyn found herself pinned against the wall, engulfed in his scent. She struggled briefly before fixing him with an arctic stare.

"Explain yourself." Every syllable dripped venom. This proximity set her nerves alight - not with the breathless anticipation of years past, but with the acute awareness that control was slipping through her fingers.
###Chapter 234 The Forbidden Kiss

Nathan's features were carved from ice, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's face. "This way you can witness firsthand," he said through clenched teeth. "The spectacle you anticipated won't be happening."

His voice carried a dangerous edge, more chilling than angry. With deliberate coldness, he withdrew his arm from her space.

A predatory gleam flickered in Nathan's darkened eyes as he began undoing the buttons of his stained jacket. The garment landed carelessly on a nearby chair with a soft thud.

His movements turned feral as he ripped off his tie with one sharp motion. The silk accessory joined his discarded coat in a heap.

The open collar revealed the tantalizing dip of his throat, his disheveled appearance radiating dangerous charm. An untamed wildness clung to him like a second skin.

The air between them grew thick enough to choke on. Evelyn barely managed to avert her eyes, forcing her traitorous pulse to steady. When she spoke, her voice was carefully measured.

"Mr. Blackwood, you flatter yourself. I couldn't care less about whatever drama unfolds between you and Genevieve."

Evelyn truly didn't give a damn about Nathan's tangled relationships. His behavior was bordering on absurd.

"Couldn't care less?" His voice dropped to a rough whisper that sent shivers down her spine. She must have imagined the vulnerability there. "Of course not." With that dismissal, Evelyn pivoted on her heel to leave.

His hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her wrist like a manacle. These recent encounters were becoming intolerable. What game was Nathan playing now? Evelyn's expression darkened as she prepared to demand answers.

Without warning, Nathan pinned her against the wall once more.

His palms cradled her face with surprising gentleness before his lips crashed against hers in a searing kiss. The contact sparked electric currents through her body.

Nathan lost himself in her sweetness, his kiss turning desperate and possessive. Evelyn remained frozen, her senses overwhelmed.

The familiar scent of his cologne mixed with whiskey triggered memories she'd tried to bury. Memories of when she'd been foolish enough to find that combination intoxicating.

When his tongue sought entrance, reality came crashing back. Evelyn bit down hard on his lower lip.

The moment he recoiled, her palm connected with his cheek in a stinging slap. The sharp crack echoed through the room.

Nathan's expression darkened as he stared at her, unblinking.

Evelyn shoved him away, fury radiating from every pore. "Open your eyes, Mr. Blackwood."

"I'm not some cheap fling you can buy with expensive trinkets. If you're looking for entertainment, I'm sure your harem of admirers would be delighted." Nathan's face hardened at her words, his voice turning gravelly.

"But you're the only one I want." The image of Sebastian Hart's planned proposal flashed through his mind, igniting fresh fury. When had this woman become so essential to his existence?

Her presence had taken root in his chest, growing vines around his heart until removing her would mean tearing himself apart.

Evelyn's pupils contracted violently. It felt like someone had ripped open an old wound, leaving her raw and bleeding.

The pain was unbearable. "Nathan Blackwood, we're divorced. I finally gave you what you wanted - I vanished from your life. We have no connection now, and we never will again."

"I feel nothing for you anymore, so do us both a favor and stay the hell away from me." Who did he think he was? Storming back into her life now, reopening scars she'd worked so hard to heal.

Did he enjoy seeing her in pain? Was this some twisted game to him? That single kiss had shaken her to the core.

It had been devastatingly perfect, and that's what made it so despicable. Evelyn turned away without hesitation, unable to bear his presence a moment longer.

She couldn't let him see how much he still affected her. With practiced ease, she wrenched open the door and fled. The slam behind her sounded final.

Nathan stood motionless.

The red imprint on his cheek burned, a trickle of blood staining the corner of his mouth. He barely registered either sensation. His chest ached with a dull, persistent throb.

"Happy birthday, Evelyn," he whispered to the empty room. In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty - he'd just lost the most precious thing he'd ever had.
###Chapter 235 The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

Sebastian Hart emerged from the shadows, his shoulders visibly relaxing when he spotted Evelyn Sinclair. "I thought you'd been taken," he exhaled sharply. "But knowing you, you're more likely to be the kidnapper than the victim."

"Don't bring up Nathan Blackwood." Evelyn swiftly composed herself, descending the staircase with practiced grace. The click of her stilettos echoed through the grand hall, each step a deliberate performance of nonchalance.

Her chest still burned with unresolved tension. She shot Sebastian an icy glare, her expression unreadable as marble. The way her emerald gown cascaded over her curves would've made any observer believe she hadn't just left a warzone.

Genevieve Dawson scurried after her, teeth worrying her bottom lip. "Evelyn," she ventured timidly, "is Mr. Blackwood...alright?"

Evelyn's crimson lips curled in a smirk sharp enough to draw blood. One glance at Genevieve's trembling hands told her everything. Had the girl owned her ambition outright, Evelyn might have respected her.

But this pitiful act? This pretense of innocence while eyeing another woman's ex? Disgusting.

Evelyn tilted her chin toward the upstairs suite, her voice glacial. "Why don't you go see for yourself?" Even if she despised Nathan, vultures would always circle his fortune.

Three years ago might have broken her. Not anymore.

Now she wore indifference like armor. Genevieve flushed scarlet. "That's not—"

"Unnecessary," Sebastian cut in, studying Genevieve with newfound suspicion. He'd known the Sterlings for years. Since when did Evelyn have a cousin who cowered like a kicked puppy?

Evelyn flicked an invisible speck from her sleeve. "Her mother is sleeping with my uncle." That was all the explanation she'd give. Family scandals weren't for public consumption.

Sebastian merely hummed, already losing interest. Genevieve released a breath she'd been holding. If only she bore the Sterling name instead of Dawson. Her mother Margaret had begged Charles Sterling for years to legitimize them.

Always dismissed with a laugh. Always treated as a joke.

The moment Evelyn and Sebastian reached the ballroom floor, Alexander and Lucas Sterling materialized like twin storms. Thankfully, the swirling dancers provided cover. Sebastian's smile froze.

This. Was. Bad.

His knees actually wobbled. Alexander's gaze could've flash-frozen the champagne fountain. Beside him, Lucas leaned against a pillar, all rakish charm and hidden knives.

Evelyn arched a perfect brow. "What's this?"

Lucas blocked her path with an outstretched arm, deadly serious. "Just need a word with Mr. Hart about his little...performance earlier." His grin didn't reach his eyes. "Fireworks. Roses. Surely there's an explanation?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "By all means." Her good mood had evaporated the second Nathan's lips touched hers. Damn the man.

Sebastian gaped. "You're abandoning me?" His pleading look bounced off Evelyn's indifference as she deliberately turned away.

Alexander's voice dropped to subzero. "While we appreciate your...friendship with our sister, ensure tonight's spectacle isn't repeated." Every syllable dripped with restrained violence.

Lucas cracked his knuckles. "Our Evelyn's about to become the wealthiest woman alive. She hasn't time for distractions." His smile turned feral. "Unless you'd prefer to discuss this with me?"

Sebastian's eye twitched. What exactly was there to "discuss" with a man who'd once knocked out a paparazzo for snapping Evelyn's photo?
###Chapter 236 Who Do You Think You're Ordering Around?

Sebastian knew better than to argue. These were his future brothers-in-law after all. He had to maintain some decorum!

His smile turned warm and bright. "You have my word, this won't happen again. My feelings for her will remain locked away in my heart."

Alexander's brows furrowed dangerously. His gaze could cut glass.

Lucas shuddered, goosebumps rising on his arms. "Just shut up already!" Evelyn simply turned on her heel and walked away without a word.

The band Lucas had hired was phenomenal, their live performance captivating the crowd.

Dancers swayed to the rhythm, completely immersed. In the adjacent lounge, lively chatter could be heard. Drawn by the voices, Evelyn moved toward the sound.

Just as she reached the doorway, someone grabbed her wrist and yanked her inside. "What are you doing here? Come with me!" Evelyn frowned.

It was Margaret Dawson. The audacity of this woman to crash an event she wasn't invited to! Though seeing Genevieve earlier should have prepared her.

This mother-daughter duo never missed an opportunity to network with the elite. Naturally, people Evelyn despised always found ways to annoy her.

She struggled subtly, not wanting to cause a scene. Their movements were already attracting attention.

Margaret clung to Evelyn's arm, simpering at several corporate executives. "Our Evelyn is both beautiful and brilliant. You simply must collaborate with her more!"

The executives naturally respected Evelyn's reputation. They immediately approached with glasses raised.

Evelyn seized the moment to break free. She casually took a flute of champagne from a passing waiter and clinked glasses politely.

The executives drained their drinks immediately. Evelyn merely raised her glass in acknowledgment without drinking.

Margaret wouldn't let it go. "Evelyn, drink properly! How rude to these distinguished guests! As Sterling Corporation's President, you can't act like a child! In business circles, refusing a toast is unacceptable!"

The executives exchanged uncomfortable glances. Given Evelyn's status, her polite acknowledgment was already generous.

What right did Margaret have to demand she drink? Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she shot Margaret a sidelong glance.

Her voice turned icy. "Who do you think you're ordering around?" Margaret froze, stunned by the public disrespect.

How dare Evelyn speak to her like this? After she'd been so forgiving! The nerve!

Trembling with rage, she forced a strained smile. "I'm only looking out for you. As your elder, isn't it natural to offer guidance?" Charles Sterling had brought her here.

Margaret was determined to establish herself as the second lady of the Sterling family. Not even Evelyn could disregard her!

"Elder?" Evelyn scoffed. "What makes you my elder? Your delusions of grandeur?" The insult in her tone was unmistakable.

For years, Margaret had endured a powerless existence as Charles' mistress, swallowing every humiliation. The empty title of "second lady" brought only fear - fear the Sterlings would disown her.

All her suffering was because of them! What right did Evelyn have to look down on her? Margaret saw red.

Just as she prepared to retaliate, she spotted Charles and William approaching.

Instantly, tears welled in her eyes as she threw herself into Charles' arms. "What's wrong?" Charles frowned at the scene.

Margaret sobbed dramatically. "I can't take this anymore! I saw Evelyn being disrespectful during toasts and tried to correct her, but she snapped at me! After all these years, am I still not family? She refuses to acknowledge me as her elder!"
###Chapter 237: The Ultimate Comparison

The executives approached William Sterling with polite greetings before hastily excusing themselves.

They deliberately ignored Margaret's presence.

William clinked glasses with them absentmindedly, mirroring Evelyn's refusal to drink. He had witnessed the entire scene unfold.

Though the Sterlings were hosting, the guest count had far exceeded their original invitations.

Everyone sought to network with the prestigious Sterling family and mingle with high society.

Uninvited guests had tagged along with invited friends, exploiting the opportunity.

William chose to overlook this breach of etiquette but refused to entertain every toast.

His participation in a toast was considered an immense honor. Margaret's face paled at this realization.

What had she just accused Evelyn of? Poor manners for not drinking?

William's icy gaze flickered between Evelyn and Margaret. He remained silent.

Why was she causing a scene? She should at least recognize the occasion.

"Enough. This is Evelyn's birthday celebration."

His low voice dripped with displeasure. "Why are you crying?" His commanding presence dwarfed hers.

The unspoken threat in his tone was unmistakable. "Charles, take her home immediately. We won't tolerate the Sterling name being tarnished."

Charles and Margaret froze at his words.

Tears streamed down Margaret's face. "We're being dismissed just like that?"

A-list celebrities from across the globe attended Evelyn's party.

Margaret had begged Charles to bring her, desperate to flaunt her status after being expelled from Sterling Manor previously.

Another public dismissal would destroy her social standing.

"William, please—" Charles pleaded helplessly.

After all these years together without marriage, he did feel some guilt. Margaret clutched his arm dramatically.

"See? William doesn't consider me family. No wonder his children treat me with such contempt!"

"All my years with you mean nothing!" Disgust twisted William's features.

Only the presence of guests and concern for Evelyn's mood prevented his outburst.

Evelyn observed coldly from the sidelines. This was her event—she wouldn't tolerate disruptions.

"Stop claiming association with the Sterlings," Evelyn stated icily. "You've never been one of us."

"Aunt Elizabeth passed years ago, and we still honor her memory annually. Everyone knows you're just the mistress."

Margaret gaped in shock. How dare Evelyn expose this publicly?

Some guests knew but avoided mentioning it. Others were now enlightened by Evelyn's bluntness.

"Evelyn!" Charles frowned disapprovingly.

Before Evelyn could respond, Genevieve rushed to her mother's defense.

"How could you, Evelyn? Mom has cared for Dad for nearly a decade! Even without marriage, their love is real!"

Genevieve's gaze flickered meaningfully between Evelyn and William.

"If not for... circumstances, they'd be married by now!" She clung to Charles's arm pitifully. "Right, Dad?"

Charles hesitated, glancing at William's stony expression before freezing.

Margaret, touched by her daughter's support, saw an opportunity to clear her name before this elite audience.

"You don't understand, Evelyn. I've endured so much hardship with your uncle—compared to Elizabeth—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply.

"Compared to Aunt Elizabeth? What exactly are you comparing? Your ages—or who's more shameless?"
###Chapter 238 Words Cut Deeper Than Knives

Evelyn Sinclair deliberately raised her voice. Her words sliced through the air, instantly drawing every eye in the grand ballroom.

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. Genevieve Dawson's face flushed crimson with rage. "How dare you speak to your elders that way! You're utterly uncivilized!"

Evelyn merely arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. That single gesture spoke volumes. Elders? These women had forfeited any right to respect the moment they'd schemed their way into the Sterling family.

Margaret Dawson's manicured nails dug into her palms. This was supposed to be her triumphant return to high society - a chance to reconnect with Nathan Blackwood and reestablish her position. Instead, Evelyn had exposed their dirty laundry for all to see.

Better to play the victim then. Margaret lowered her voice to a trembling whisper. "Evelyn, must you be so cruel?" Tears glittered artificially in her eyes.

Evelyn's gaze could have frozen molten lava. "Spare me the theatrics. If you think that was cruel, I've got a dictionary full of words you haven't heard yet."

She leaned in slightly, her voice carrying just enough for the surrounding guests. "Shall I tell everyone how your real father works as a bouncer at Aurora Club? Or how you've been funneling Sterling money to support him?" Her eyes flicked to Charles Sterling. "Uncle Charles, you might want to check if you're funding more than just these two gold-diggers."

Lucas Sterling's investigation had uncovered every dirty secret after their initial eviction from Sterling Manor. The actor brother had a knack for digging up inconvenient truths.

Charles's face darkened like a thundercloud. His hand shot out, striking Margaret with enough force to send her sprawling across the marble floor. Her scream echoed through the suddenly silent ballroom.

"You told me he died in an accident!" Charles's voice shook with barely contained fury.

Margaret cowered on the ground, her carefully constructed facade crumbling. "I-I didn't mean to lie! I didn't know he'd resurfaced—"

Genevieve rushed to her mother's side, but Charles's glare stopped her cold. "Did you know about this too?" When Genevieve couldn't meet his eyes, his expression turned glacial. "Get out. Both of you. Before I have security drag you out."

The once-proud women scrambled toward the exit under the weight of a hundred judgmental stares, their carefully constructed world of lies collapsing around them.
###Chapter 239 A Dangerous Encounter

William Sterling stood silently at the edge of the room, his expression unreadable.

He had no interest in his brother's domestic drama. What infuriated him most was how they'd ruined his daughter's special celebration.

Therefore, he felt no obligation to intervene, no matter how fiercely Evelyn retaliated.

They had it coming. Genevieve and Margaret deserved every bit of it.

The situation was escalating beyond repair. They eventually slunk away in humiliation. Charles Sterling also excused himself after exchanging brief words with William.

The minor disturbance barely caused a ripple. The guests smoothly transitioned to other topics - some returning to the dance floor, others engaging in polite conversation.

No one dared whisper about what had transpired. Evelyn took a delicate sip of her merlot. The wine stained her lips a deep crimson, accentuating her striking beauty and icy demeanor.

When she turned and noticed William's stormy expression, she approached and gently tugged his sleeve.

"Don't be upset, Father," she coaxed with a charming smile. "I wasn't the one who suffered. Why waste your energy on such people?"

Her sudden transformation from ice queen to doting daughter surprised everyone, yet also endeared her to them.

The contrast made her earlier coldness seem like a carefully crafted performance. Faced with such radiant charm, even the hardest hearts would melt.

"Charles has completely lost his judgment," William grumbled, his good mood shattered. "Bringing them here today? He must be under some spell."

Evelyn blinked innocently and clung to his arm like a koala. "Uncle Charles has been fooled for years. This isn't new."

"Your health is more important, Dad. Please don't upset yourself." Her voice carried genuine concern.

William couldn't stay angry under her affectionate assault. Soon, he was laughing and toasting with other guests.

As the party wound down, exhaustion crept over Evelyn. After bidding William goodnight, she stepped outside.

The night air felt refreshing after the wine. Too much had happened tonight - Nathan's kiss, Sebastian's roses - leaving her emotionally drained.

Her stilettos clicked rhythmically on the pavement. Streetlights cast elongated shadows, creating a glittering path like fallen stars.

Then the lights abruptly ended. Darkness swallowed the next stretch of road.

Evelyn paused. An unnatural chill crept up her spine.

From the blackness came faint, hurried breathing. Then two hulking figures materialized.

"Miss Sinclair," one rumbled. "Someone requests your presence."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Should've brought security, she thought ruefully. Yet she maintained perfect composure.

Her piercing gaze assessed the men. "Kidnapping or ambush?" she demanded coolly.

Their stunned expressions confirmed this wasn't a random encounter.

"Just... a conversation," the other stammered, pointing toward the darkened path.

A glowing cigarette tip pierced the shadows.

Someone was waiting. The atmosphere thickened with unspoken danger.

Evelyn calculated her options. She could run - but that would leave this threat unresolved. Better to confront it now.

Curiosity also gnawed at her. Who would dare target a Sterling?

With measured steps, she advanced, stopping three meters from the mysterious figure.

The bodyguards positioned themselves behind her. The shadowy form remained indistinct - just an outline against the wall.

But Evelyn recognized the distinctive perfume mixed with expensive tobacco. Only one guest tonight wore that scent - someone with an equally commanding presence.

The silent standoff continued. Evelyn felt unseen eyes studying her intently.

As the cigarette burned halfway, her patience wore thin.

"If you went through all this trouble to see me," she said coolly, "at least have the courtesy to speak, Victoria Ashford."

The glowing ember flared, revealing Victoria Ashford's sharp features in the brief illumination.
###Chapter 240 I'll Be a Good Girl and Listen

Evelyn Sinclair had only encountered that distinctively icy, luxurious fragrance on one person before - Victoria Ashford.

At their initial meeting during the charity gala.

In Sebastian Hart's penthouse.

And again tonight at the opera house benefit.

The same signature scent lingered in the air now. A soft, mocking chuckle came from the shadows.

"Ms. Sinclair, how perceptive of you." The voice dripped with false sweetness. "To recognize me so easily?"

Evelyn didn't dignify that with a response, rolling her eyes dramatically.

Pity Victoria couldn't see the gesture. What a wasted performance.

Victoria Ashford - the legendary business magnate who built an empire from scratch, worshipped by Forbes and Fortune alike - resorting to kidnapping? This wasn't some impulsive act. Nor was it about money.

"I assume you didn't bring me here to exchange pleasantries, Ms. Ashford?" Evelyn's voice cut through the darkness like polished steel. "Get to the point. What do you want?"

A sharp intake of breath.

Evelyn could practically taste the fury Victoria was swallowing. What fascinated her most was her own unnatural calm.

No panic. No fear. Just icy disdain as she'd unmasked her captor with effortless precision.

The shadows shifted as Victoria stepped into the dim light, her designer heels clicking against concrete.

"Aren't you frightened, Ms. Sinclair?" Victoria's manicured fingers toyed with a cigarette. "What comes next won't be... pleasant."

Evelyn lifted her chin, their gazes locking like dueling blades.

Then she laughed.

A rich, melodic sound that seemed absurd in their grim surroundings. Her lips - still perfectly painted despite everything - formed each word with crystalline clarity.

"This is about Sebastian Hart, isn't it?"

The temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees.

That name was Victoria's open wound. A decade of unrequited longing hidden beneath power suits and boardroom victories. She'd convinced herself there was still time, still hope - until tonight.

Until she saw the way Sebastian looked at Evelyn.

The way he'd been about to kneel before the entire opera house.

It shattered something fundamental in Victoria.

No failed merger, no billion-dollar loss had ever made her feel this unraveled. This... desperate.

Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Clever girl. Yes, this concerns Sebastian Hart."

Evelyn shook her head, genuine confusion knitting her brows. "Even if you destroy me, it won't make him love you. Surely a woman of your intellect knows how... primitive this approach is?"

She emphasized the last word, letting it hang between them.

Force was for thugs and fools.

And this was Evelyn's city. The Sinclair family's domain. One word from her, and Victoria's precious Ashford Enterprises would burn.

Was Sebastian worth torching her life's work?

Victoria's laugh was hollow. "Effective is effective, darling." She took a deliberate step closer. "Ruining your special night does seem cruel, but what choice did you leave me? Your family guards you too well."

A lighter flicked open.

The flame illuminated Victoria's face, highlighting the madness in her eyes. "I only need some... compromising photos. Enough to ensure you disappear from Sebastian's world permanently."

She exhaled smoke directly into Evelyn's face. "Then you'll be a good girl and listen, won't you?"

Evelyn didn't flinch.

The glow from Victoria's cigarette reflected in her eyes - twin pools of liquid defiance. That famous Sinclair smirk played across her lips.

"Of course I'll listen," Evelyn purred. Then her voice hardened to tempered steel. "But you'll fail."

The sheer arrogance in that statement made Victoria stiffen.

Even bound and outnumbered, Evelyn Sinclair remained untouchable. A queen among peasants. The realization made Victoria's blood boil.

After a stunned moment, Victoria recovered with a predator's smile. She raised one hand, signaling unseen figures in the darkness.

"Let's test that theory, shall we?" Her voice dripped with false sympathy. "My apologies in advance, Ms. Sinclair..."
###Chapter 241 Triple-Killed

The instant Victoria Ashford lifted her hand, the two hulking men flanking Evelyn Sinclair advanced.

Their movements were perfectly synchronized.

Just as their fingers grazed Evelyn's arm, an icy gust sliced through the air.

Darkness cloaked Evelyn like a second skin.

She twisted away, her body folding into the shadows with feline grace. In a blink, she materialized behind them.

Before they could process her disappearance, she kicked off one stiletto.

Her fingers curled around the shoe's pointed tip, its lethal heel aimed outward.

She struck like lightning—fluid, brutal, unstoppable.

The nearest bodyguard sensed danger too late. He jerked forward, but Evelyn pivoted mid-swing.

Her weapon arced toward Victoria instead.

The razor-sharp heel connected with Victoria's temple.

A choked gasp.

Victoria clutched her skull, nails biting into skin. Warmth trickled down her brow.

Silence.

Then—

A wet, metallic scent filled the air.

The bodyguards froze.

Evelyn didn't.

Her shoe cracked against the second man's skull before he could blink.

Rule one of street fights: Never hesitate.

The remaining bodyguard lunged, seizing Evelyn's wrist.

She let him.

Then stomped her bare heel onto his instep and drove her elbow into his gut.

A guttural scream shattered the night.

Three minutes.

That's all it took to flip the script.

Victoria's voice cut through the darkness, venomous. "Pathetic! Knock her out now!"

Evelyn smirked. Her gaze flicked to the alley's exit.

Run.

Golden light suddenly flooded the path, exposing them all.

The bodyguards flinched.

Victoria didn't. Blood streaked her porcelain face, but her glare never wavered.

Three figures emerged from the glare.

"Nathan Blackwood?" Victoria's composure cracked for half a second before reassembling. "You swore you'd stay out of this."

Nathan stood haloed in light, his broad frame radiating menace. His voice was Arctic frost. "You crossed a line, Victoria."

Tristan Whitmore and Harrison took in the scene with twin expressions of shock.

Evelyn stood barefoot, one shoe dangling from her fingers. Blood dripped from its heel.

Not hers.

Her hair was mussed, her dress wrinkled, yet she looked every inch the queen.

Tristan's lips twitched. "Ms. Ashford... did Evelyn just triple-kill you?"
###Chapter 242 Curtain Call

Victoria Ashford's face twisted in fury, her eyes blazing with uncontained rage.

She remained the CEO of Ashford Enterprises, an undisputed powerhouse in Santa Barbara. How could she endure such repeated humiliation?

Victoria's crimson glare locked onto the hulking bodyguard beside her.

"What are you waiting for? Take her down!" The command sent the man lumbering toward Evelyn Sinclair with predatory intent.

His orders were clear - incapacitate the target for easy transport. The tension crackled like live wires about to snap.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over them. Her fingers tightened around the concealed stiletto in her palm.

The temperature seemed to drop several degrees.

A sudden gust of wind signaled movement behind Evelyn. The guard's meaty hand reached for her shoulder to immobilize her.

Tristan Whitmore and Harrison barely had time to shout a warning.

Then - like lightning - Nathan Blackwood materialized between them. His steel-toed boot connected with the guard's abdomen with bone-crushing force.

The impact sent the man flying backward as if hit by a truck. Every organ in his body seemed to rupture simultaneously.

He collapsed like a marionette with cut strings, barely breathing, completely immobilized.

Victoria's posture stiffened almost imperceptibly. Her best operative had been neutralized in seconds. Swallowing her volcanic rage, she turned venomous eyes toward Nathan.

"Playing the white knight, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice dripped with false sweetness.

Nathan's glacial stare held something far more dangerous than anger - the promise of annihilation. Tristan recognized that look with dawning horror.

The predator had reemerged after years of civilized restraint.

"Victoria Ashford," Nathan's voice could have frozen hell, "you overestimate your importance. Does your failing company mean nothing to you?"

His gaze flickered to Evelyn standing barefoot on the pavement, then back to the three assailants. Something primal uncoiled in his chest - a mix of protective fury and lingering terror.

Nathan had walked through darkness so Evelyn wouldn't have to. The thought of these vultures laying hands on her ignited something ancient and violent within him.

His bloodshot eyes pinned Victoria in place. Business negotiations? Those happened at his discretion. There were no terms to discuss, no reparations to consider.

What gave this woman the audacity to bargain with him? Years of legitimate dealings had made people forget how he'd clawed his way up from the underworld.

Victoria's smirk faltered as she reassessed her position. The legends about Nathan Blackwood suddenly felt less like exaggeration and more like warnings.

No matter Ashford Enterprises' standing in Santa Barbara, against Blackwood Industries they were insignificant. Her furious gaze shifted to Evelyn as a cruel smile twisted her lips.

"Ms. Sinclair," she spat the name like poison, "how... fortunate for you."

"You certainly have a way with men, Evelyn." Victoria Ashford's lips curled into a mocking smile. "But don't count on being this fortunate again."

Evelyn Sinclair lowered her lashes, concealing the icy contempt in her gaze.

The words ignited something primal within her. This woman actually believed there would be a next time? How utterly delusional. Evelyn stood motionless, refusing to acknowledge Nathan Blackwood's presence from the start.

His intervention meant nothing to her. When Victoria's taunt reached her ears, Evelyn lifted her chin and swept a glacial stare across the assembled guests. Finally, those frosty eyes settled on Nathan.

"Tonight's performance has been... unexpectedly entertaining." Evelyn's voice carried a deceptive lightness, though a dangerous edge lurked beneath the surface. She let the words hang in the air like a suspended blade.

The tension between them crackled like static before a storm. Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly, his protective stance shifting subtly closer to Evelyn despite her obvious rejection of his aid.

Victoria's smirk faltered for the first time that evening as she registered the unspoken challenge in Evelyn's demeanor. The atmosphere grew thick with unspoken threats and buried history.

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the stem of her champagne flute, her posture deceptively relaxed. Yet everyone present could feel the lethal energy radiating from her - a panther pretending to lounge while preparing to strike.
###Chapter 243 Did She Lay a Hand on You?

The air turned glacial in an instant. A bone-deep chill settled over the space, so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn with a flicker of disbelief. She met his stare with careless defiance. When their eyes clashed, he saw nothing but cold distrust in hers.

His heart stuttered painfully. You think I orchestrated this with Victoria Ashford?

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously. Evelyn remained silent, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

Beside them, Tristan shivered as waves of icy tension rolled off both parties. What the hell is happening?

Why else would you be standing here right now? Evelyn's words made the temperature drop several more degrees.

Tristan quickly stepped forward. "You've got it all wrong! Nathan had nothing to do with this! We were leaving when he wanted to speak with you."

"We searched everywhere, then the doorman mentioned seeing you come this way. We rushed over immediately."

He shot Harrison a look, and the assistant nodded vigorously.

"That's exactly what happened, Ms. Sinclair." Evelyn lowered her lashes slightly, considering their explanation.

Tristan pressed on, "You two were married once. There must still be some lingering affection between you. Why would Nathan ever want to hurt you? When we heard the commotion, he feared for your safety and came running."

"How could you possibly think he'd conspire against you?" Tristan didn't notice the defensive edge creeping into his voice.

He was frustrated on Nathan's behalf! Lingering affection? Evelyn's gaze turned sardonic as she studied Nathan. Their marriage had been a sham from the beginning - what affection could possibly remain?

A soft, derisive laugh escaped her. "In that case, I suppose I owe you my gratitude?" She'd nearly finished handling these thugs herself. What exactly had his dramatic arrival accomplished?

Did they really think she'd swallow this pathetic excuse? Only a fool would believe Nathan had no connection to Victoria Ashford after everything that had transpired between them.

Nathan's expression darkened visibly. Tristan grew increasingly confused - he'd explained everything clearly, so why did the tension between these two only seem to escalate?

Victoria watched the unfolding drama with malicious amusement. "How touching. It appears Mr. Blackwood's feelings were rather one-sided, weren't they?"

"Ms. Sinclair clearly has no shortage of admirers." Evelyn's glare could have melted steel. "Victoria Ashford, you should worry less about spectating and more about your own predicament."

Before Victoria could retort, Harrison suddenly gasped. "Sir! Someone's coming! It's Alexander Sterling and Sebastian Hart!"

Victoria's face twisted with rage at Sebastian's name. She whirled on Evelyn. "When did you call them?" She'd monitored Evelyn's every move - there'd been no opportunity to use a phone.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, casually twirling the stiletto in her hand. Then with practiced ease, she slid the shoe back onto her foot.

She lifted her chin imperiously. "Do you have any idea how much these heels cost? An eight-million-dollar shoe going missing is irrelevant. What matters is how it disappeared."

The hidden tracking device in her footwear connected directly to Sterling Manor's security system. Did Victoria truly think the Sterling heiress would venture out unprotected? How naive.

Alexander arrived with his security team, his presence radiating danger. When Sebastian took in the scene, his eyes burned with fury as he glared at Victoria.

His voice came out low and deadly. "Did she lay a hand on you?"
###Chapter 244 Unlucky

Victoria Ashford trembled violently at Sebastian Hart's words.

The usually charming, poetic, and refined Second Young Master Hart now looked at her with murderous intent.

Years of unwavering devotion and affection for him crumbled to ashes in that moment.

A flicker of anguish crossed her delicate features.

But no one spared her a glance. Evelyn Sinclair saw right through Victoria's schemes.

With a derisive sniff, she stated coldly, "She's not capable of that."

Both Sebastian and Alexander Sterling visibly relaxed at her declaration.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Nathan Blackwood with a complicated expression.

If she hadn't been in real danger, she wouldn't have triggered the emergency alert. Were those two thugs hired by Nathan Blackwood or Victoria Ashford? And why was Mr. Blackwood here? Nathan's face remained impassive as he stared back at Evelyn, his features carved from stone.

Tristan Whitmore quickly stepped forward to explain the situation again, with Harrison echoing his words. Alexander Sterling turned away. It was unthinkable that a man like Nathan Blackwood would stoop to harming Evelyn.

That left only one possibility - Victoria Ashford. Alexander paused, then turned to his sister. "Evie, what do you want to do about this?"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "We'll simply give Victoria exactly what she wanted. Just a few photos, after all." Her voice turned icy as she addressed the trembling woman. "Ms. Ashford, if you cooperate, this will be much less unpleasant for you."

Victoria's head snapped up, her eyes wide with horror.

How dare Evelyn humiliate her like this in front of Sebastian? She was a business icon in Santa Barbara, a legend in her own right! "You wouldn't dare, Evelyn Sinclair!"

"Oh, but I would," Evelyn replied casually, examining her manicure.

"The Ashford family will make you pay for this! The entire business community in Santa Barbara will turn against you!" Victoria threatened.

Before Evelyn could respond, Alexander let out a dark chuckle. "Using your family name to intimidate my sister? How pathetic. Perhaps it's time for a change in Santa Barbara's business leadership."

Victoria paled instantly. She'd spent a decade building her empire in Santa Barbara, and Alexander Sterling could dismantle it all with a snap of his fingers.

Sebastian Hart grew impatient. "Let's get this over with. Just do as Evelyn says." His dismissive tone made it clear Victoria's humiliation meant nothing to him.

"I'd rather not witness this... unpleasantness," Evelyn murmured with a delicate shudder. Turning on her heel, she strode away with perfect posture, every inch the regal queen. The men could handle the dirty work.

Sebastian naturally followed Evelyn without a backward glance. Victoria's face twisted in ugly despair. She had lost completely.

With a sudden burst of hysterical energy, Victoria screamed at Sebastian's retreating back. "Everything I've done has been for you! I've loved you for ten years! How can you just walk away? That bitch Evelyn only keeps you around as backup! She'll never love you - she's incapable of loving anyone but herself!"

Her carefully maintained composure shattered as she screamed out the secret she'd held for a decade, uncaring of the shocked looks from the men surrounding her.

Victoria Ashford - the ruthless business titan who never bowed to anyone - had been reduced to this pathetic creature when it came to matters of the heart.

She stared desperately at Sebastian's back, praying he would turn around. That he would save her from this nightmare.

The silence stretched unbearably long. Then Sebastian stiffened and slowly turned. His eyes held nothing but pure disgust as he delivered his final blow:

"Consider yourself cursed to have ever loved me."
###Chapter 245 The Plagiarism Scandal

The icy wind howled as Evelyn Sinclair turned away without hesitation. She had no desire to remain in that place a moment longer. By the time she reached Sterling Manor, the clock had already struck midnight.

Dawn broke with golden sunlight streaming through her bedroom windows. Evelyn blinked awake to a breathtaking view of Highland Estates' private arboretum - rare specimens from every continent swaying gently outside her window. A perfect morning.

Yesterday's unpleasantness evaporated like morning mist. Evelyn stretched luxuriously before freshening up and checking her tablet for overnight market movements. A message from Alexander Sterling timestamped 3:47 AM glowed on the screen: [Victoria Ashford situation handled. Sleep well, little sister.]

Already? Alexander's protective instincts were legendary, and Evelyn could only imagine what ruthless measures he'd employed.

But one question lingered - what had been Nathan Blackwood's role in last night's events? Those fathomless dark eyes had held such complex emotions when they'd locked onto hers.

Evelyn shook her head sharply. Nathan's thoughts and feelings were irrelevant now. His timely appearance meant nothing to her. She'd survived just fine without his intervention.

Stepping into her walk-in closet, Evelyn selected a couture ensemble from the season's most exclusive collection. The soft rustle of silk was interrupted by her ringing phone. Isabella Montgomery's name flashed on the screen.

"You're more reliable than my alarm clock," Evelyn teased as she answered.

Isabella's voice crackled with indignation. "Why didn't you tell me about last night's drama?"

Ah. The gossip mill had already started grinding.

"Well, you know now," Evelyn replied lightly.

"Only because I heard Victoria Ashford got caught trying to ambush you! Can you believe she confessed her pathetic crush on Sebastian Hart right before getting arrested? And managed to offend both Nathan and Alexander in one night? Where does that woman get her audacity?"

Isabella's outrage was almost comical. Almost.

"Those weren't just regular bodyguards with her," Isabella continued, suddenly serious. "They were former MMA champions. Even with your training..."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. MMA champions? If she'd gotten lucky with one attacker in the dark, the second might have overpowered her. The realization hit like a physical blow.

So Nathan's intervention had been... necessary? The thought tasted bitter. "I'm fine," she forced out after a beat. "They arrived in time."

"Thank God. Rumor has it Victoria was shipped back to Santa Barbara sobbing uncontrollably. Alexander's already blacklisted Ashford Enterprises from all Sterling Corporation affiliates. That woman's career is finished."

Evelyn listened impassively. Alexander's ruthlessness came as no surprise - she would have done the same. Their conversation continued during Evelyn's commute, ending abruptly when her car pulled up to Sterling Corporation headquarters.

The lobby doors parted before her Jimmy Choo heels. Receptionists straightened instantly as Evelyn glided past, returning their greetings with a regal nod.

Bennett materialized at the elevator with her morning agenda. "Meeting in ten minutes, Ms. Sinclair. However—"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Dominic Kingsley from Kingsley Tech has been waiting since seven."

Evelyn's perfectly manicured fingers stilled on her tablet. "Reschedule the meeting. Show Mr. Kingsley in immediately."

Dominic's expression when he entered could have frozen the Mediterranean. His wire-rimmed glasses did nothing to soften the storm in his eyes.

The Aether Core project had been progressing flawlessly. What could possibly warrant this tension?

The door clicked shut behind Bennett. Dominic didn't sit.

"Evelyn," he said without preamble, "our AI chip designs have been stolen."

The words hung between them like a guillotine blade.

"By someone inside Sterling Corporation."
###Chapter 246 Confronting the Past

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent, her piercing gaze locked onto Dominic Kingsley's face. His expression betrayed no hint of jest. The tension between them grew thick enough to cut with a knife, and Evelyn could feel her stomach twisting into knots.

The revolutionary aspect of their AI chip lay in its unprecedented diagnostic capabilities - detecting both latent and manifest illnesses in human subjects. This groundbreaking achievement had been proudly announced to the global community.

To shield Donovan Sterling from unnecessary scrutiny, they'd attributed the design to a collaborative effort between Sterling Corporation, Kingsley Tech, and Kensington Group.

If Sterling Corporation suddenly claimed exclusive rights, it would spark rumors of a fractured alliance between the three corporate giants. The resulting stock market turmoil would be catastrophic.

Nothing good could come from such reckless actions. This project represented years of painstaking work and billions in investments.

It would be tragic to see it derailed by petty corporate politics before reaching its full potential.

Evelyn steadied her breathing. "Do you know which subsidiary is responsible?" With countless enterprises under Sterling Corporation's umbrella, Evelyn couldn't possibly monitor them all.

Dominic clearly had inside information. He produced a folded note from his jacket pocket, sliding it across her desk with deliberate precision. "Nathan discovered it's Charles Sterling in Charleston." Evelyn's brow furrowed instantly.

That scheming relative was causing trouble again. How utterly predictable. Evelyn mentally catalogued her options. The most effective way to dispel rumors was with irrefutable evidence.

"If all else fails," Dominic suggested casually, "you could always bring your former flame into this." Evelyn's head snapped up in confusion. What former flame? Since when did she have-

"Sunner!" Dominic clarified. "If he makes a statement, this whole plagiarism accusation disappears. Nobody would believe the legendary Sunner would steal intellectual property."

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard she saw stars. She summoned Bennett to escort their visitor out.

As Dominic exited Sterling Corporation headquarters, he pulled out his phone. "I've informed Evelyn," he reported. "But Nathan, this is official business. Wouldn't this be the perfect opportunity for you to see her in person?"

The line remained silent except for the faint click of a lighter. After several tense seconds, Nathan's voice finally came through, cold and hollow. "She despises me. The last thing she wants is my presence."

No sooner had Dominic left than Evelyn launched an investigation into Sterling Corporation's Charleston operations. The findings confirmed her suspicions.

By early afternoon, social media was ablaze with speculation. Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch had prematurely announced their "exclusive" AI doctor project, sparking intense debate:

[Wasn't this supposed to be a three-way collaboration?]
[Corporate partnerships are always temporary.]
[Are they rushing this to market too quickly?]
[Has Evelyn Sinclair lost her moral compass?]

The public assumed Charleston's actions were sanctioned by Evelyn herself, making her the target of widespread criticism. Sterling Corporation's stock began a slow but steady decline.

Fortunately, Kingsley Tech and Kensington Group refrained from capitalizing on the situation, allowing Sterling Corporation to handle its internal crisis.

Without hesitation, Evelyn ordered her car. She would confront Charles Sterling personally in Charleston. Alexander Sterling chose to remain behind, collaborating with Kingsley Tech to trace the information leak.

During the three-hour drive, Evelyn monitored the online discourse with growing concern. The mixed public reaction spelled trouble for Sterling Corporation's reputation. Trust, once lost, was difficult to regain.

"We've arrived, President Sinclair." Bennett opened her door. Evelyn stepped out, her designer heels clicking decisively against the pavement as she marched toward the building entrance.

"Hey! You can't just walk in here-" The drowsy receptionist jerked upright, her complaint dying mid-sentence when she recognized the imposing figure before her. "P-President Sinclair?"
###Chapter 247: Partners in Profit

Five sharply dressed figures trailed behind Evelyn Sinclair, their tailored suits exuding power and authority. Bennett moved swiftly to press the elevator button, his movements precise and practiced.

Upstairs, the receptionist frantically alerted the office of Evelyn's arrival. Genevieve Dawson, Lydia Smith's cousin and secretary, barely glanced up from painting her nails. "She thinks she can just waltz in here and take a cut of our profits now that we're making money?" Genevieve scoffed. "Dream on."

The words reached Evelyn the moment her bodyguard opened the office door. Genevieve didn't even rise from her seat. "Ms. Sterling," she drawled, "the General Manager isn't available. Try again another time."

Bennett's jaw tightened. No employee had ever dared speak to Evelyn with such disrespect. Without acknowledging Genevieve, Evelyn turned to Bennett. "Call an executive meeting in five minutes. Anyone who isn't present is fired."

"Understood," Bennett replied smoothly.

Genevieve's face twisted in disbelief. "Who do you think you are? This isn't your company! The General Manager—"

Evelyn strode past her into the conference room, pausing only to deliver a cutting glance over her shoulder. "General Manager? You mean Genevieve Dawson? Of course she's your cousin. But this isn't Dawson territory. You have no authority here."

Bennett almost pitied the woman. Every word out of Genevieve's mouth was another nail in her professional coffin.

Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Sterling Corporation belongs to the Sterlings. A Dawson has no power here. Pack your things and leave. Now."

Genevieve's face paled. "Y-You can't—"

Bennett stepped forward. "She's the President of Sterling Corporation. And you'd do well to inform Genevieve Dawson that her presence is required immediately."

As Evelyn entered the conference room, she added, "And call my uncle, Charles Sterling, while you're at it." That incompetent uncle of hers couldn't even manage this small branch without causing problems. If William Sterling hadn't handed the company to Charles years ago, he'd still be wasting away in obscurity. Countless deficits had been covered for this Charleston branch over the years. If they couldn't appreciate that, it was time to revoke their privileges.

Five minutes later, Evelyn surveyed the assembled executives—those loyalists her father had planted to monitor the situation. Bennett distributed documents as Evelyn cut straight to the point. "I assume you've all seen this morning's news. Sterling Corporation partnered with Kingsley Tech on the AI project. So why has this branch developed an identical product and released it first?"

Silence hung heavy for several seconds before a bald executive at the front spoke up. "We had no knowledge of this. Margaret Dawson keeps us at arm's length like criminals, and Charles Sterling barely involves himself with company affairs—"

The conference room door burst open before he could finish. "Starting a meeting without us?" Margaret Dawson swept in, Genevieve trailing behind her like a shadow. Dressed in garish designer labels that screamed new money, Margaret carried herself with none of the caution she'd shown at Sterling Manor. Apparently, Charles Sterling had forgiven her for backing another man—a fact that baffled Evelyn.
###Chapter 248 Were You Raised Without Manners?

Evelyn Sinclair sat regally at the head of the conference table, her manicured fingers slowly turning pages of the damning documents before her. The cold disdain in her emerald eyes could freeze molten lava.

"You arrived just in time." Her voice dripped with venom. "Explain to me how you stole Kingsley Tech's proprietary medical research?"

Genevieve Dawson stiffened visibly, but Margaret Dawson recovered faster. "Stole? That's preposterous! We invested heavily in our own R&D team at the Charleston branch."

Margaret gestured dramatically. "We've secured pre-orders from seventeen major corporations totaling over a billion dollars. Evelyn, this is a golden opportunity we can't afford to miss."

Evelyn's laughter was sharp enough to cut glass. "Pre-sales? With penalty clauses triple the contract value?" She leaned forward, her gaze piercing. "Did you honestly think I wouldn't discover your little scheme?"

The entire boardroom held its breath. All eyes darted between the three women - the Sterling heiress versus the Dawson mother-daughter duo who'd been running the Charleston branch like personal fiefdom.

Margaret's lips curled in triumph. "Your uncle Charles personally approved this venture. While we may not share the Sterling name, his authority here is absolute."

Evelyn didn't even blink. "I've already filed criminal charges with the Charleston PD. Every executive involved in this fraud will be prosecuted - from the boardroom to the mailroom."

She'd coordinated with William Sterling before this confrontation. The Charleston branch required complete restructuring after this scandal.

Genevieve's face drained of color. Margaret's confident smirk faltered. They'd banked on Evelyn backing down if they dragged Charles Sterling into this.

The heavy oak doors burst open. "What the hell is going on here?" Charles Sterling stormed in, his face purple with rage. Clearly Margaret's people had fed him a distorted version of events.

Margaret immediately clung to his arm like a lifeline. "Charles! Thank God you're here! Your niece has gone completely rogue - she's trying to have us all arrested!"

Charles turned his fury on Evelyn. "You have no authority here! This is my division!"

Evelyn met his rage with icy calm. "The Charleston branch stands accused of intellectual property theft from Kingsley Tech. The police are already investigating."

"You called the cops? On family?" Charles sputtered. "This is an internal matter! Patent disputes happen daily in our industry - most never get resolved due to lack of concrete evidence!"

Genevieve chimed in indignantly, "We're making money for the Sterling Corporation! Shouldn't we be working together instead of tearing each other down?"

Evelyn's smile could curdle milk. "You're not worthy of partnership."

Charles exploded. "How dare you speak to me like that!"

"Tell me, Uncle Charles," Evelyn purred, "how quickly you forgave these two for keeping a lover behind your back. Do you enjoy being cuckolded?"

Charles slammed both fists on the conference table with a thunderous crash. The room plunged into shocked silence, every executive gaping at Evelyn's nuclear verbal strike.

Evelyn remained perfectly composed in her seat, observing with cold amusement as Genevieve and Margaret's faces drained of color.

A bitter smirk curled at the corners of her lips.

They really thought they could challenge me?

Margaret reacted first, her carefully constructed facade crumbling instantly.

The venom in her glare was unmistakable.

Her words came out in a poisonous hiss.

"Evelyn Sinclair, you manipulative witch! How dare you speak to Charles that way?"

She leaned forward, her manicured nails digging into the armrests.

"Was your mother too busy dying to teach you basic decency?"

The air in the room turned glacial.

Evelyn's fingers twitched imperceptibly, the only outward sign of the storm brewing beneath her calm exterior.

Genevieve gasped dramatically, clutching her pearls in fake shock.

But Evelyn saw the calculating gleam in the younger woman's eyes.

This little performance had been rehearsed.

The tension stretched taut between them, like a wire about to snap.

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock chimed ominously.

Evelyn finally moved, rising with the grace of a panther stalking its prey.

Her voice, when she spoke, was deceptively soft.

"My mother," she said slowly, "taught me everything I needed to know about dealing with snakes."

Margaret flinched as if struck.

Genevieve's smug expression faltered.

And in that charged moment, Evelyn knew - the game had changed.

The first domino had fallen.

Now they would all see where the pieces landed.
###Chapter 249 She Has No Integrity

Charles Sterling couldn't prevent the venomous words from escaping Margaret Dawson's lips. The atmosphere in the room turned glacial in an instant.

An icy chill spread through the air, making everyone tense.

It was common knowledge that Evelyn Sinclair's mother had passed away years ago. The Sterling family considered it a forbidden topic, too painful to discuss.

If William Sterling heard such remarks, he would have Margaret eliminated without hesitation. And Evelyn? She wouldn't tolerate such disrespect either.

Margaret finally noticed Evelyn's darkening expression and realized her grave mistake. She instinctively turned to Charles for support, but his earlier anger had vanished completely.

The tension stretched unbearably long as Evelyn's cold gaze remained fixed on Margaret. Her eyes held a dangerous depth.

A humorless smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Margaret Dawson," she said in a voice like frozen steel, "I've been far too lenient with you, haven't I?"

From the moment Margaret spoke, Evelyn had no intention of letting this slide.

Margaret stiffened, about to explode in anger when Charles grabbed her arm roughly. "Silence! You've forfeited your right to speak here." His sudden hostility confused her.

"Charles, I only said that for your sake—" Margaret began, but Charles cut her off, his jaw clenched tight.

"Evelyn," he said, forcing calm into his voice, "she didn't mean it. But business is business. This profitable project shouldn't be abandoned. We've hired top research teams."

"World-renowned specialists, both domestic and international," he continued. "Even if investigated, we have nothing to hide!"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp with derision. "This project required decades of research—a global breakthrough. What so-called experts did you hire?"

"Specialists?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Not even the collective genius of every expert worldwide could match Donovan Sterling's brilliance. How shameless can you be?"

"Do you intend to ruin both this project and Sterling Corporation's reputation?" Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Never!"

Genevieve Dawson smirked arrogantly. "It's Professor Meyer, the nation's foremost physicist. His work has been published internationally. Who dares accuse us of plagiarism?"

Professor Meyer was indeed a celebrated figure in physics—not that Evelyn would recognize his name, Genevieve thought smugly.

Charles stepped forward, adopting a conciliatory tone. "Evelyn, your father and I are brothers. Would I ever harm our family business?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze, her expression unreadable. "Uncle Charles, the auditors Alexander sent won't fail. Your financial discrepancies are obvious. I've already discussed this with Father."

"This Charleston branch will undergo restructuring after bankruptcy. All staff will be reevaluated and reassigned accordingly." Her voice turned icy. "Margaret and her daughter, along with all their distant relatives, can leave immediately."

"As for contract compensation," Evelyn continued, "you'll serve as legal representative for the new company if you accept responsibility."

"Otherwise," she concluded, "retirement is your only option." This wasn't a negotiation—it was a decree.

The staff visibly relaxed, as if seeing salvation after a long ordeal. Margaret and Genevieve's faces twisted in fury.

Years of scheming, destroyed in moments?

Charles's face darkened with rage. His barely controlled frown deepened into a scowl. This damn girl was determined to oppose him!

"You—" Charles refused to believe his brother would approve this. He pulled out his phone to call William, but the calls went unanswered. Frustration and panic set in.

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Father left for Philmont on his private jet this morning. Currently, I'm in charge of Sterling Corporation."

The battle was already lost. The Sterlings had shown remarkable mercy already.

Evelyn rose gracefully, her piercing gaze sweeping the room before settling on Margaret and Genevieve. She locked eyes with Genevieve.

"Your mother isn't dead," Evelyn said with deliberate cruelty. "Pity she couldn't teach you manners—she has no integrity herself."
###Chapter 250 The Plagiarism Scandal

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't one to forgive easily. She could maintain a calm facade after being insulted, but she never forgot. Every cutting remark from Genevieve and Margaret was carefully noted in her private journal.

Retribution would come in due time. Ignoring their whispered taunts, Evelyn lifted her chin and strode away in her designer heels.

Just breathing the same air as those women made her nauseous. Her bodyguard Marcus swiftly opened the car door for her.

Every movement she made exuded natural elegance, as if she'd been born to command attention and respect.

Back at Sterling Corporation headquarters, her team had already initiated the takeover process for the Charleston branch. With this in motion, Evelyn could afford to ignore the online rumors temporarily. The truth would soon be undeniable.

Yet Charles Sterling refused to concede defeat. The next day, he released a corporate video statement.

Professor Meyer stood before the cameras, indignantly accusing others of stealing his research. His carefully worded accusations subtly targeted Kingsley Tech's project, reigniting the controversy.

The internet exploded with debate. Who was plagiarizing whom? Public opinion remained divided.

[Professor Meyer is a nationally recognized expert with numerous patents. Why would he lie?]

[Did Kingsley Tech buy someone else's technology with their financial muscle?]

[Professor Meyer has an impeccable reputation. He doesn't seem like the type to fabricate claims.]

[I was Meyer's former student. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing who steals students' work!]

[All his overseas research achievements were taken from his students.]

The dissenting voices were quickly drowned in the sea of comments.

Evelyn watched the escalating situation with detached calm. Bennett approached cautiously. "President Sinclair, should we contact media platforms to suppress the trending topics?"

She took a deep breath, forcing her voice to remain steady despite the cold fury in her eyes. "No need. Let's add fuel to the fire and watch them burn themselves."

Bennett immediately understood her meaning. The press conference was arranged with simple yet solemn precision.

Few expected Evelyn to face the media storm head-on during this crisis. Both Nathan Blackwood and Dominic Kingsley received invitations. Their attendance wasn't necessary, but they came anyway.

They addressed the issue directly, though Evelyn remained the focal point. Their presence beside her demonstrated their unwavering support for this partnership.

Dominic carried himself with refined grace, his demeanor naturally inspiring trust. Nathan exuded aristocratic elegance - his mere presence commanded respect without uttering a word.

Evelyn made no attempt to downplay her appearance, wearing an exclusive haute couture ensemble that accentuated her striking beauty. She effortlessly commanded attention wherever she went.

Every camera angle captured her perfection. Had she entered entertainment, her looks alone could have secured her the industry's top spot.

Reporters momentarily forgot their purpose, mesmerized by her presence before refocusing on their questions. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

"President Sinclair, what's your response to the plagiarism allegations?"

Evelyn didn't evade the question. "The management at Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch acted improperly by plagiarizing our tripartite collaboration's results."

Her statement sent shockwaves through the room. "Are you suggesting this was directed by Sterling Corporation?" a reporter pressed.

Evelyn smiled calmly. "Sterling Corporation has numerous subsidiaries operating under independent legal entities. Our internal investigation confirmed the Charleston branch engaged in unethical practices."

"We've filed a police report and decided to liquidate all Charleston operations. Following bankruptcy proceedings, we'll reorganize completely. Sterling Corporation won't tolerate such misconduct."

"We welcome oversight from regulatory authorities." Her voice remained measured yet carried undeniable authority.

Her words resonated powerfully. This marked perhaps the first time a corporation voluntarily admitted fault at significant financial cost to preserve integrity.

The livestream went viral instantly, flooding with comments:

[That's how ethical corporations should operate!]

[President Sinclair, will you marry me?]

[This press conference features the most attractive trio in business history!]
###Chapter 251 Shall We Make It Official?

The room fell into stunned silence. Though the journalists kept firing questions, their tone had noticeably softened.

"Given these circumstances, could you clarify the situation regarding Professor Meyer's video? If Sterling Corporation acknowledges the plagiarism, doesn't that mean Professor Meyer was the one who—"

"Academic theft remains the most unforgivable sin in our field," another reporter cut in.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a radiant, self-assured smile. Rising gracefully, her voice carried both warmth and steel. "The success of our tripartite research initiative wasn't due to Professor Meyer's contributions, but rather the intellectual property he stole from us."

Her gaze swept across the room as she delivered the coup de grâce. "Allow me to introduce the true mastermind behind our research team—the youngest scientist ever to receive the prestigious Breakthrough Prize in our industry—Donovan Sterling."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd. Every eye turned toward the side entrance where a strikingly handsome man emerged with effortless poise.

This wasn't the stereotypical image of a stuffy academic—Donovan moved with the casual elegance of a runway model, his piercing gaze scanning the room with amused detachment.

Every journalist present recognized him instantly. With Donovan Sterling's involvement, Professor Meyer's career in the scientific community was effectively over.

Donovan paused deliberately, allowing the flashing cameras to capture his arrival.

"Come join me," Evelyn murmured, her voice carrying just enough for the microphones to pick up. Donovan's responding smile as their eyes met sent the reporters into a frenzy.

The chemistry between them was electric. Social media feeds exploded with live reactions: [Is that THE Donovan Sterling?] [President Sinclair is glowing!] [The way he looks at her—I'm deceased!] [Someone check if I'm dreaming!]

As Donovan took his seat, his relaxed demeanor contrasted sharply with the storm brewing elsewhere in the room. Nathan Blackwood's jaw clenched visibly, while Dominic Kingsley leaned over to whisper, "She actually got the prodigy scientist to show up? President Sinclair's connections never cease to amaze me."

Nathan's response came through gritted teeth. "This isn't just professional. There's something more between them."

Dominic smirked. "Jealousy doesn't suit you, Nathan. Though I suppose your list of romantic rivals just grew considerably longer."

Before Nathan could retort, a bold reporter seized the moment: "President Sinclair, what exactly is your relationship with Donovan Sterling? Colleagues? Or something more... intimate?"

The room collectively held its breath. This crossed professional boundaries—Evelyn had every right to shut down the question.

Instead, she exchanged a knowing glance with Donovan, her smile turning playful. "Shall we tell them?" she asked, loud enough for all to hear.

Donovan's answering grin was wolfish. "Your call, little sister."

Every camera lens focused with laser intensity. Nathan's knuckles turned white, his entire body rigid with tension.

Evelyn let the suspense build, savoring the moment. Then, under the glare of spotlights and before dozens of reporters, she reached for Donovan's hand, intertwining their fingers with deliberate intimacy.

"Very well," she announced, her voice rich with pride. "Let me properly introduce Donovan Sterling—yes, of the Sterling Corporation Sterlings. My father William Sterling's son, my brilliant second brother, and incidentally, one of the most groundbreaking scientists of our generation."

The revelation hit like a thunderclap. Cameras flashed wildly as the siblings' united front sent shockwaves through the industry—and shattered Nathan Blackwood's composure completely.
###Chapter 252 She's Like a Little White Rabbit

The moment the words left her lips, the grand hall fell into stunned silence. Then, like a sudden storm, the room erupted into chaos. Online, the reactions were even more explosive.

[No way! What kind of plot twist is this?!]
[I thought I was President Sinclair, marry me instead!]
[AAAAAHHHH!!! Evelyn has three god-tier brothers?! Why don’t I have any?!]
[I thought the biggest reveal was Lucas being a Sterling—how did they manage to keep Donovan a secret too?!]
[The legendary Donovan Sterling could’ve coasted on his family name, but he built his empire from scratch. Respect.]
[Our Julian still has a shot! President Sinclair, don’t forget about him!]

Inside the venue, the murmurs grew so loud that the original purpose of the press conference was completely overshadowed. What was meant to be a brief announcement stretched into an hour-long spectacle.

Dominic Kingsley tugged at Nathan Blackwood’s sleeve, refusing to let go. "Did you hear that?"

Nathan snapped out of his daze. Of course he had heard it. Evelyn’s voice echoed in his mind, replaying on an endless loop.

Donovan was a Sterling. He was Evelyn’s brother.

Nathan should have guessed—Donovan had always been unusually familiar with Evelyn. On the surface, Nathan remained composed, but beneath that calm exterior, his emotions churned violently.

He had nearly lost his temper earlier.

Dominic’s tone dripped with sarcastic regret. "What a surprise, huh? Turns out they’re actually siblings."

Nathan’s lips curled slightly, accentuating his sharp jawline and giving him an air of restrained nobility. "Evelyn has always had high standards. Otherwise, why would she have fallen for me in the first place?"

Dominic rolled his eyes. Was this man seriously complimenting himself? Too bad for him—Evelyn’s tastes had clearly evolved.

After the press conference, Evelyn and Donovan politely ushered the crowd out. The reporters left with more than they bargained for—not only had they witnessed Nathan’s rare public appearance, but Donovan’s revelation had been the cherry on top.

At the entrance, Dominic and Nathan exchanged farewells. Dominic’s assistant kept urging him to leave, but he lingered, watching as Nathan checked his watch with deliberate nonchalance.

Nathan didn’t seem in any hurry. His gaze drifted to Evelyn, who was still tidying up inside the venue. Her sleek, understated outfit made her stand out effortlessly.

Dominic let out a soft sigh. "Who would’ve thought she’d handle such a mess so smoothly?"

Though Sterling Corporation had taken a hit, their reputation had emerged stronger than ever.

"A clean victory," Dominic mused. "Evelyn’s the only one who could walk out of this corporate battlefield unscathed."

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly. "She’s more like a little white rabbit."

In his eyes, Evelyn’s methods were still too soft. The executives in Charleston should’ve faced more than just financial penalties—they deserved full accountability.

Dominic’s lips twitched. He had no words.

Evelyn approached them with a polished, professional smile. Her expression gave nothing away—she didn’t even glance at Nathan as she addressed Dominic directly.

"This matter will blow over soon. My apologies for the inconvenience."

Dominic shrugged. "As long as it’s resolved, I’m satisfied. Well done, President Sinclair. Today’s news should send Sterling Corporation’s stocks soaring again. Congratulations."

He was, of course, referring to Donovan’s grand reveal.

Evelyn’s smile remained diplomatic. "A win for both of us. Congratulations to you as well, President Kingsley."

She glanced at her watch. "It’s getting late. I still have work to attend to, so I’ll take my leave."

Dominic gave a slight nod, then shot Nathan a meaningful look before turning away.

Left alone, Nathan studied Evelyn. Every movement was graceful, every gesture refined—yet the smile she offered him was nothing more than polite artifice. His chest tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood," she spoke first, her tone cool. "I’d also like to thank you for having President Kingsley inform me about the situation in Charleston."

Nathan hesitated. "And how do you plan to thank me?"
###Chapter 253 Unfortunate News

Evelyn froze mid-step, her brows arching in surprise. Huh? Shouldn't his response have been something like, "You're welcome, it was nothing"?

Nathan Blackwood truly didn’t play by conventional rules.

Suppressing the urge to roll her eyes, Evelyn kept her expression composed, offering him a polite but distant smile.

"I merely did what was necessary." With that, she turned to leave.

Nathan’s voice halted her retreat. "Believe me or not, what happened that night with Victoria had nothing to do with me." His jaw was tight, his tone laced with frustration.

Since when did Nathan Blackwood—ruthless, untouchable—care about justifying himself? Yet here he was, insistent on clarifying something so trivial.

The memory of Evelyn’s distrustful gaze that night haunted him. It had cut deeper than any blade, leaving him grappling with an unfamiliar helplessness—the agony of being shut out of her world, of her no longer believing a single word he said.

Evelyn’s shoulders stiffened imperceptibly.

She had nearly forgotten about that incident after Bennett’s investigation. To her, the truth didn’t matter anymore. Nathan’s sudden insistence on explaining himself was baffling.

"Mr. Blackwood, whether you were involved or not is irrelevant now. The matter is over." Her tone was cool, final. She walked away without another glance.

The plagiarism scandal had concluded, leaving the so-called Professor Meyer disgraced and publicly condemned.

The real thief behind the stolen chip turned out to be Meyer’s young lover—an intern at Kingsley Tech and a classmate of Genevieve Dawson’s. The police had swiftly arrested her.

Meanwhile, the bankruptcy proceedings for the Charleston branch had begun. Charles Sterling, refusing to accept defeat, stormed Sterling Tower repeatedly, demanding to see William and causing a scene.

"How dare you do this to me? I’m a Sterling!"

Evelyn sat in her office, a half-eaten dessert forgotten in front of her. The sweetness had turned to ash in her mouth.

Bennett studied her expression. "Should I have security remove him? The staff have been wanting to suggest it for a while."

But out of deference to Evelyn’s familial ties, no one had dared.

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to the photos Charleston’s authorities had sent her. Her expression darkened.

"Let him in."

Bennett hesitated but obeyed without question.

"I thought you’d be too ashamed to face me!" Charles barged in, his unshaven face haggard, his eyes bloodshot. "Evelyn, have you no conscience?"

Evelyn poured him a cup of tea and set it on the table with deliberate calm.

"Uncle Charles, I have unfortunate news for you."

He froze at her icy tone.

"As of ten minutes ago, the financial team at the Charleston branch discovered all company funds have vanished. Every property and stock under your name has been liquidated."

His face paled.

"You don’t have a single cent left to pay your investors."

Charles hadn’t even taken a seat. His body locked in place before he erupted into violent coughs, his face flushing crimson.

"You’re lying!"

Evelyn projected the photos onto the wall, forcing him to confront the evidence.

"While you were here throwing tantrums, your mistress and stepdaughter emptied your accounts and fled."

The images showed the two women with a burly middle-aged man—Genevieve’s father and Margaret’s husband—sneaking through an airport. The implications were damning.

Charles recognized the man instantly. He had investigated him after Evelyn’s warning at her birthday gala.

Yet here he was, making a fool of himself while they escaped with his fortune.

Evelyn watched the rage and humiliation twist his features. The fire was stoked perfectly.

"Uncle Charles," she said smoothly, "my father is willing to cover your debts—on one condition."

She let the silence stretch before delivering the final blow.

"You withdraw from all Sterling Corporation businesses, including the shares you secretly purchased."

Her smile was razor-sharp. "Immediately."
###Chapter 254 Without a Doubt

Charles Sterling's entire body went rigid, his face twisting into an ugly grimace.

"You...you knew about that?" His voice cracked with disbelief. He had been so careful, selecting only the minor shareholders who joined Sterling Corporation later to quietly acquire their stakes. Yet somehow, she'd discovered everything.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Sterling Corporation is my father's life's work, not some inherited family business. By rights, you have no claim to any part of it."

She leaned forward slightly, her piercing gaze locking onto his. "The only reason Father hasn't exposed you is out of brotherly affection. But if you continue down this path, you'll lose even that."

Charles stood frozen, his eyes flickering with sudden remorse. All the fury that had propelled him here evaporated, leaving him hollow and numb.

Evelyn placed the stack of incriminating photos in his trembling hands. "Uncle Charles, surely you don't want our family fortune falling into the hands of those two women?" Without another word, Charles turned and stalked out.

A soft chuckle escaped Evelyn as she pulled out her phone to text William. (Come home now!)

Bennett still looked stunned. "Ms. Sinclair, aren't we going after Genevieve and Margaret? They took nearly everything from the Charleston branch."

Evelyn arched an elegant brow. "No need. Let Uncle Charles handle it personally. He'll appreciate the...satisfaction of catching them himself."

Only by seeing their betrayal with his own eyes would he understand the depth of their deception. When the board meeting reconvened later, Alexander couldn't stop praising her strategic brilliance.

Word spread quickly through Sterling Corporation about how their young president had masterfully handled the crisis. This was no spoiled heiress playing at business - Evelyn Sinclair commanded respect through sharp intellect and decisive action.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises, Nathan had just concluded his own meeting when Harrison approached.

"Sir, the invitations for the Global Economic Forum have arrived. You've been selected again. Should we arrange your travel itinerary?"

This exclusive gathering brought together only the most influential business leaders worldwide, with no regard for social status or inherited privilege. Only true industry titans received the embossed gold invitations - fewer than twenty globally each year.

Nathan paused as he accepted the heavy envelope, his fingers tracing the raised lettering. "Associates can bring one guest, correct?"

Harrison blinked in surprise. While the rules technically allowed it, few ever exercised the privilege. The forum's prestige relied on maintaining an exacting balance - for every new attendee, another must depart.

"Who did you have in mind, sir? Tristan?" He immediately regretted the suggestion when Nathan's expression darkened.

"Give the invitation to Evelyn. Whether she attends is her decision." His tone left no room for discussion as he strode into his office.

Harrison mentally kicked himself. Of course he meant Ms. Sinclair! Though if Evelyn appeared at such an elite gathering, the Sterling family's ascendancy would become unstoppable.

Back at Sterling Corporation, Evelyn studied the unmarked invitation before her. Though no name appeared, the weight of the envelope spoke volumes. This was unlike any corporate event she'd ever attended.

She remembered hearing whispers about this legendary forum during her business studies in Europe - the kind of opportunity money couldn't buy, no matter how much one possessed.

Bennett watched her carefully, having sensed something significant when Harrison delivered the envelope earlier. "Will you be going, Ms. Sinclair? Given Mr. Blackwood's involvement..."

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Without a doubt."
###Chapter 255 Fifty Seconds Left

Bennett was stunned. Normally, Evelyn Sinclair would go out of her way to avoid any place Nathan Blackwood might appear. So why wasn't she avoiding this meeting?

Evelyn held the invitation, raising a brow.

She didn’t understand why Nathan was being so generous, offering her this opportunity. But she wasn’t about to question it—not when it was this rare.

"Book me a flight," Evelyn told Bennett.

Bennett hesitated. "Mr. Harrison mentioned that Mr. Blackwood already arranged it. If you want to go, you just need to board the plane."

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Damn it. Did Nathan Blackwood read her mind?

After a moment, she snatched the invitation and went to find Alexander Sterling.

"Big Brother, that bastard Nathan Blackwood gave me this. I’m going."

Alexander glanced at the invitation, surprise flickering across his face before he smiled calmly.

"I was planning to take you in a few years. You’re still young, and people might underestimate you because of your lack of seniority. But if you want to go now, I’ll come with you."

Evelyn’s eyes lit up. "You’re coming too?"

Alexander opened a drawer and pulled out a thick stack of invitations—all from the founding members of the Montevista Business Summit.

"I never bothered going before. Too much hassle."

Evelyn swallowed.

Of course. Alexander’s effortless arrogance never failed to impress.

Two days later, Evelyn arrived quietly at the airport, Leo the AI tiger wrapped snugly in a Malo cashmere shawl. His little head peeked out occasionally, curious about the bustling crowd.

She wouldn’t have bothered disguising him if she weren’t worried about causing a scene.

"Be good," she murmured, stroking his head. "I’ll let you explore when we land."

On the plane, the business-class seat beside her remained empty.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—until her phone buzzed with an unknown number.

[President Sinclair, President Blackwood had an emergency. His flight was rescheduled to 7 PM. Someone will meet you in Montevista. —Harrison]

Evelyn scoffed.

Good. The last thing she needed was being trapped on a flight with him.

Leo, however, had already drawn attention. More than once, Evelyn had to explain that he was just an advanced AI robot.

To prove it, Leo played dead on cue—stiff, tongue lolling, eyes rolled back.

The flight attendant left, satisfied.

Evelyn patted his head. "All clear."

The plane took off smoothly. Evelyn reviewed some documents, then leaned back to rest—until a deafening explosion rocked the cabin.

The plane lurched violently.

Evelyn jolted awake, heart hammering as the aircraft shuddered, completely out of control. Screams erupted around her.

Flight attendants shouted instructions, but no one listened.

Evelyn clutched Leo, her face pale. Outside the window, storm clouds churned, lightning flashing ominously.

If she had known this would happen, she never would have come.

Leo wriggled free, his mechanical pupils shifting as infrared sensors scanned the cockpit.

Within seconds, his voice turned grave.

"Mama, the engine is irreparably damaged. We’re at 5,000 feet. Coordinates: 100N, 80E. The braking system is failing. Crash probability: 95%."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

"What do we do?"

The desperate cries around her were deafening. Her hands trembled as she gripped the armrest.

In all her years, she never imagined dying like this.

Everything she’d ever done suddenly felt insignificant.

Leo’s voice was urgent. "Put on the life jacket and oxygen mask. The plane will lose control in one minute. Prepare to jump. Survival chance: 50%."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Fifty percent?

That was a death sentence.

But she followed his instructions anyway, hands shaking but never stopping.

"Fifty seconds left."

"Forty seconds."

Then—

BOOM.

The world froze.
###Chapter 256 Her Name Is on the List of Casualties

At Kingsley Tech headquarters.

The golden hues of sunset painted the Manhattan skyline as Nathan Blackwood emerged from the boardroom.

His custom Patek Philippe watch showed 6:47 PM.

He still needed to catch his flight to Montevista. Evelyn Sinclair was waiting there for their postponed reconciliation dinner.

Nathan loosened his Armani tie with one hand while reaching for his phone with the other.

Before he could summon Harrison, his assistant came barreling through the glass doors uncharacteristically disheveled.

Harrison's usually impeccable appearance was shattered - tie askew, hair mussed, eyes bloodshot.

In twelve years of service, Nathan had never seen his unflappable assistant in such a state.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Harrison's voice cracked. His hands trembled as they clutched an iPad.

Nathan's gut twisted. His knuckles turned white around his Montblanc pen.

"Speak."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Liber Airlines Flight 227... There's been... The plane Evelyn was on..."

The pen snapped in Nathan's grip.

"No survivors." Harrison whispered. "They found her name on the..."

The words "casualty list" never made it past his lips.

Nathan's world tilted. The floor seemed to drop away beneath his Italian leather shoes.

His vision tunneled. The only sound was the deafening rush of blood in his ears.

Evelyn couldn't be...

Not his vibrant, stubborn, brilliant Evelyn.

Not the woman who played Chopin with such passion. Who negotiated mergers with razor-sharp wit. Who smoked Cuban cigars on the balcony of their penthouse just to scandalize the neighbors.

The woman whose laughter still haunted his dreams three years after their divorce.

Nathan's knees buckled. He caught himself on the conference table, sending documents flying.

"You're mistaken." His voice was barely human. "Check again."

Harrison's tears fell freely now. "William Sterling collapsed when they notified him. They've hospitalized him at New York Presbyterian."

The iPad screen showed the official airline statement: "Mechanical failure during storm conditions... No distress signal... Impact with Pacifica Ocean..."

Nathan's chest caved in.

Memories assaulted him - Evelyn's smile over morning coffee. The way she bit her lip when concentrating. Her scent of vanilla and jasmine lingering on his sheets.

The last time he saw her, walking away without looking back.

His fist connected with the walnut table. Once. Twice. Splinters embedded in his skin.

"Find her." Nathan's command was guttural. "I don't care what it costs. Search every inch of that ocean."

Across Manhattan, news alerts blared on every screen.

#EvelynSinclair trending worldwide.

The Sterling brothers - Alexander, Donovan, and Lucas - posted identical four-word statements that broke the internet:

"Bring our sister home."

The Kingsley Tech building shook with Nathan's roar of anguish as reality set in.

Somewhere over the Pacifica, the love of his life was gone.

And he'd never gotten to say goodbye.
###Chapter 257 She Vanished Without a Trace

The Sterling family deployed over twenty private helicopters to scour the stretch of ocean where the tragedy occurred. They contracted elite international salvage teams to comb every inch of the surrounding waters.

Hope refused to die. Within hours, the search radius tripled as nearly a hundred aircraft darkened the skies above the Pacifica Ocean.

The unprecedented operation made global headlines. Naval vessels joined the effort as divers multiplied exponentially across international waters. Nathan Blackwood personally led search teams around the clock, driven by unbearable guilt.

He couldn't forget it was his invitation that brought her here. His thoughtlessness that put her in danger. His fault she'd been terrified in those final moments.

She wouldn't have boarded that doomed flight. Wouldn't have disappeared. Wouldn't have... He couldn't bring himself to complete the thought. What horrors flashed through Evelyn Sinclair's mind when the engines failed?

Had she thought of him? Cursed him? That fearless woman who faced everything with such courage - how terrified must she have been? He'd give anything to have been there beside her.

Yet after seventy-two relentless hours, not a single trace emerged.

The wreckage recovered from the ocean floor told a gruesome tale - twisted metal, shattered components, blackened fragments.

Nathan stood rigid in the helicopter doorway, the merciless sunlight reflecting off waves that concealed unimaginable horrors. Salt spray stung his unshaven face as turbulent currents swirled beneath deceptively calm surfaces.

Life seemed so fragile in that moment. His grip on the doorframe trembled violently until Harrison steadied him from behind.

Harrison's grief mirrored Nathan's. Unlike his employer's three-year neglect of Evelyn, the assistant had witnessed her entire transformation - the shattered woman reborn into a force of nature. His admiration for her strength made the loss unbearable.

Watching Nathan deteriorate during the endless search, Harrison recognized the soul-crushing despair consuming his boss.

"Sir, the board requires your presence for the quarterly approvals. Let me handle the search. I'll notify you immediately if—"

He couldn't voice the grim reality. No human survived four days in these waters. Between predators and currents, even recovering a body seemed impossible.

Nathan's sculpted features had become gaunt, his piercing eyes now hollow. Stubble shadowed his jaw, but determination still burned through the exhaustion.

"What if she's waiting for me?" His voice cracked like broken glass. "Have my grandfather address the board. Expand the search grid northward."

Harrison sighed, turning to monitor incoming satellite feeds.

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling refused to abandon hope. With William Sterling hospitalized and Alexander managing corporate fallout, the youngest Sterling brother spearheaded rescue operations.

His attitude toward Nathan had shifted dramatically - from contempt to fury upon learning why Evelyn boarded that flight, to something resembling pity.

Alexander was right. Nathan bore no true blame. How could they hate a man who looked ready to follow Evelyn into the grave?

Online outrage faded as quickly as it ignited. The crash became yesterday's news, Evelyn reduced to trending hashtags before newer scandals eclipsed her memory.

The world moved on.

But in Nathan Blackwood's shattered reality, time stopped the moment Evelyn's plane disappeared from radar.
###Chapter 258 Aren't You a Panther?

Nearly a thousand nautical miles off the search grid, in the middle of the vast Pacifica Ocean, waves crashed violently against the shores of a desolate island.

The dense jungle canopy blocked out most sunlight. Beyond the thick vegetation, only endless waves and the biting salt spray remained. Evelyn Sinclair had been wandering this godforsaken place for seventy-two hours without finding a single source of fresh water or edible food.

Her throat burned with thirst. Three days without hydration had left her lips cracked and bleeding. Leo, her AI panther companion, had transformed from a luxurious accessory to a pitiful scrap of fur huddled in her coat pocket. At least she'd been quick-witted enough to survive.

Moments before the explosion, she'd yanked open the emergency hatch and deployed her parachute without hesitation. That split-second decision had saved her life, though it sent her drifting hundreds of miles off course.

Grief for the less fortunate passengers had quickly given way to grim survival calculations. Her phone was lost to the sea, all communication devices gone. Even Leo's sophisticated systems had been damaged during their rough landing.

With no satellite signals reaching this remote location, the AI panther couldn't establish external connections. Evelyn was completely cut off, left to pray her family would find her before dehydration won.

Humans can't survive more than a week without water. Evelyn knew she was approaching her limit as she collapsed onto a sun-warmed boulder. Despair crept in as dark thoughts swirled through her mind.

"Why hasn't anyone come?" she croaked, voice raw. "Do they think I'm dead already?" Her fingers clawed at the rock. "Damn you, Nathan Blackwood! That cursed invitation might as well have been my death warrant!"

In her delirium, she imagined that if Nathan appeared now like some dark knight, she might forgive every past transgression. The fantasy evaporated as quickly as it came.

Leo peeked from her pocket, his once-glossy black fur now matted with salt and sand. The sophisticated AI resembled a discarded plush toy more than cutting-edge technology. "Mama," he rasped, voice glitching slightly, "your vital signs indicate distress."

Evelyn's heart leapt. "You're functioning again? Can you send a distress signal? Contact Emily Whitaker?"

The panther shook his head mournfully. "No signals detected. We're in a complete dead zone."

Her hope shattered like glass. The rhythmic crash of waves against shore sounded like a countdown to her demise. Hot tears welled in her sunken eyes.

"To think I might starve to death," she laughed bitterly, "when I'm worth billions." Her voice cracked. "I even bought Panther Cay last month - two billion dollars for paradise, and I'll die without ever seeing it."

Leo's processors whirred as he analyzed her ramblings. "My infrared scanners are back online. I can identify edible flora and fauna. Would you like me to locate potential food sources?"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Fauna? You mean... animals?"

The panther nodded enthusiastically. "Affirmative. When watching survival shows with Lucas Sterling, humans frequently consumed-"

"Wait," Evelyn interrupted, "are you suggesting you'll hunt for me?"

Leo immediately retreated into her pocket, every synthetic fiber of his being radiating distress. "I'm merely an artificial panther cub," he whimpered, "not an actual predator."
###Chapter 259 She Hadn't Suffered Enough

With the last remnants of her fading strength, Evelyn Sinclair stumbled back into the dense jungle.

Thankfully, she'd had the foresight to change into sturdy hiking boots before boarding that cursed plane.

Without them, she would have been dead days ago.

The towering trees of this uncharted rainforest stretched impossibly high, their massive trunks wider than three men standing side by side.

Evelyn dragged her battered body forward, her scratched hands leaving smears of crimson against the rough bark.

The pain barely registered anymore.

When you're waiting to die, minor injuries become meaningless.

"Leo," she croaked, her voice raw from dehydration. "Any sign of fruit?"

The AI tiger shook its tiny head, the motion sending another wave of despair through her.

Her vision swam as she took another faltering step.

Then the ground disappeared beneath her.

Evelyn crashed face-first into the muddy earth, her body too weak to catch herself.

Leo scrambled from her pocket, circling her frantically before suddenly freezing.

With unnatural speed, the mechanical creature dove back into hiding.

"Mommy, people coming!"

Evelyn tried to lift her head, but her muscles refused to obey.

Heavy footsteps thudded around her, accompanied by guttural voices speaking an unfamiliar dialect.

She knew seventeen languages fluently - this wasn't one of them.

People existed on this godforsaken island? After days of searching?

But her fleeting hope curdled into dread as rough hands grabbed her limbs, hauling her up like a sack of meat.

The jostling journey felt like being dragged over broken glass.

An unbidden image flashed through her mind - a roasted pig carried to the butcher's block.

Seriously? After everything, now I'm tribal dinner?

Evelyn swore silently. If this was Nathan Blackwood's idea of a rescue, she'd make him regret it.

If it was the Sterlings... well, Alexander would hear about their appalling hospitality.

And if these were just random islanders?

She'd survive this too.

The world faded to black long before they reached their destination.

A thousand nautical miles away, two helicopters converged over churning waves.

Harrison had pulled every string to get Lucas Sterling here.

They needed to combine resources if they stood any chance of finding Evelyn.

Nathan looked like death warmed over - eyes bloodshot, jaw clenched, his entire being radiating barely-contained panic.

Lucas dropped into the seat opposite, cracking open a vodka bottle with his teeth.

He spat the cap overboard, his own red-rimmed eyes locking onto Nathan's.

"Cut the martyr act. Who exactly are you trying to fool?"

Nathan didn't flinch, his gaze fixed on the horizon where Evelyn had disappeared.

The silence stretched, thick with unspoken accusations.

To the Sterlings, Nathan would always be the bastard who broke their sister's heart.

The monster who'd practically handed her a death sentence.

Lucas's voice turned glacial. "My father says you've done enough. This isn't your debt to pay."

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Nathan finally met his eyes, his voice gravel-rough. "I'm not here for your family."

Every word landed like a physical blow.

"I'm here for Evelyn. For that one-in-a-million chance she's still alive."

No body meant hope.

And Nathan would cling to that hope until his last breath.

Lucas stiffened, the words hitting harder than he'd expected.

"Then why the hell did you treat her like garbage?" he exploded. "We worshipped the ground she walked on, and you threw her away like yesterday's trash!"

Nathan's face drained of color.

The truth always hurt most when it came from someone else's lips.
###Chapter 260 You Don't Know Her

Nathan's lips parted slightly, but no words came out. Lucas threw his head back and took another deep swig of whiskey. His words were careless, fueled by alcohol and grief.

"Material possessions? The world at her feet?" Lucas scoffed. "When Evelyn was studying in Europe, our father hired eight nannies to take care of her. She fired every single one behind his back."

"Alexander flew thirty times a month just to cook for her. He sent her every research bonus he ever earned."

"And me?" Lucas let out a bitter laugh. "I only took film roles in locations near her. Even then, we thought that was the farthest she'd ever drift from us. But then—" His voice cracked. "She married you."

"For three years, she cut us off. No calls. No visits. Nothing. Nathan Blackwood, she chose you over her own family. And what did you do?" Lucas's voice trembled as tears streamed down his face.

He wiped them away roughly and drained the bottle. Harrison and the pilot sat frozen in the front, not daring to move.

The silence was suffocating. Nathan couldn't hear his own heartbeat, but he felt it—shattered, crushed, ground into dust.

Lucas stared at Nathan's ashen face. The alcohol made his chest burn with reckless fury.

Everyone said it wasn't Nathan's fault. That he didn't cause the accident. That he couldn't have controlled fate.

But Lucas couldn't stop thinking—if not for Nathan, Evelyn would never have been on that plane. She'd still be here. Still alive. Still spending his money on yachts and mansions and whatever else she wanted.

Lucas stood abruptly. The wind whipped at his clothes, tangling his hair.

With a careless flick of his wrist, he hurled the empty bottle into the sea.

"Nathan Blackwood, just go home. Whether it's guilt or something else—it's too late now. Go back to your life."

Nathan's voice was raw. "I'm not leaving. If she's still alive—"

Lucas laughed coldly, tears still falling. "You don't know her at all, Nathan. Evelyn couldn't swim."

His words were final.

"There is no if."

The endless ocean had already swallowed her whole.

The silence turned icy. Lucas's last words were the final blow. Nathan's face drained of color.

His fists clenched so tight his arms shook, veins bulging.

A person who couldn't swim—falling into the sea. Was the outcome really a surprise?

No.

He didn't know her. He knew nothing about her. Not even this.

What a joke.

The helicopter's roar suddenly deafened him.

No. Maybe Lucas is lying.

Nathan lurched forward, desperate to ask—

Then his body swayed. His grip on the cabin door slipped.

For one terrifying second, he hung halfway out, staring into the dark abyss below.

And there—he saw her.

Evelyn, smiling at him.

Yes. This is how it should be.

I should have been on that plane with her.

"President—!"

The wind slashed at his face. Salt spray stung his skin.

Lucas grabbed Nathan's arm and yanked him back hard, slamming the door shut.

The sea vanished behind metal.

"Damn it, Nathan! What the hell was that?" Lucas snarled. "You think my sister comes back if you die? She's gone! Who are you trying to fool?"
###Chapter 261 Savage Feast

To everyone watching, Nathan's actions appeared like a deliberate surrender to despair. Harrison rushed forward to intervene, terrified his boss might attempt something reckless again.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you alright?" Harrison's voice trembled with concern.

Nathan lay motionless, his eyes shut tight against the world. His ashen face resembled a death mask as Harrison pressed shaking fingers to his carotid artery. The steady pulse brought visible relief.

"Thank you, Mr. Sterling." Harrison nodded gratefully at Lucas. "The CEO hasn't slept in days. The exhaustion must have..."

Lucas studied Nathan with conflicted eyes. "Get him home." His clipped command left no room for argument. "Leave your team here to assist me."

Harrison nearly sagged with relief. Had Lucas refused the backup, Nathan would have flayed him alive upon waking.

As Lucas summoned his ride, Harrison hesitated before speaking again. "Mr. Sterling...I realize you said those things earlier to make Mr. Blackwood stand down."

Lucas turned away. Whether Harrison understood his motives mattered little.

The actor wasn't some saint, but neither could he watch Nathan destroy himself.

"After the divorce," Harrison continued carefully, "Mr. Blackwood became consumed with regret. The pain never leaves him. Certain misunderstandings...things he never intended...they hurt Ms. Sinclair deeply."

Harrison swallowed hard, realizing he'd overstepped. "But Mr. Sterling, every emotion he feels is genuine. His remorse. His love for her."

What would Evelyn think hearing these words? Lucas stood frozen for several heartbeats before striding toward the waiting helicopter without reply.

As the aircraft carried him toward a passenger ship below, Lucas gazed at the churning clouds. In another life - without the betrayals and heartbreak - Nathan and Evelyn would have been perfection together. A match written in the stars.

The thought carved fresh wounds in Lucas' chest. Nathan's feelings meant nothing now. Evelyn would never return.

Bracing against the ship's railing, Lucas let the frigid sea winds scour his face. His once-radiant features appeared gaunt, the light in his eyes extinguished by grief.

A thousand nautical miles away, Evelyn Sinclair stirred to consciousness. Damp earth pressed against her cheek as she blinked at a ceiling of woven branches. Her limbs refused to obey - bound by coarse vines.

A shadow moved beside her. Evelyn turned to find a tribesman crouching inches away, his dark skin streaked with ochre markings. A strangled scream tore from her throat.

The man grinned, revealing teeth filed to points. Animal bones clattered around his neck as he leaned closer. His loincloth of dried leaves rustled with each movement.

Evelyn scrambled backward until her spine hit the hut wall. Her frantic gaze took in dozens of similarly dressed warriors nearby - their fierce profiles straight from some anthropological nightmare.

'Where the hell am I?' The memory of being carried like game through the jungle sent ice through her veins.

Outside, tribesmen stacked kindling with ritual precision. Their leader - a mountain of muscle adorned with feathers - watched as others rubbed sticks against dry logs. Soon, smoke curled upward, igniting the waiting tinder.

The flames leaped hungrily as Evelyn's stomach dropped. 'Fire by friction? Am I in the Stone Age?'

Disbelief warred with terror as the tribesmen turned toward her hut in unison. Their hungry eyes glinted in the firelight.

'God must be playing the cruelest joke imaginable.'
###Chapter 262 The Shocking Discovery

Evelyn Sinclair wanted nothing more than to escape this nightmare. Just as despair threatened to consume her, one of the towering tribesmen pointed directly at her.

His next gesture was unmistakable—he motioned toward the roaring fire, then to his mouth.

They intended to eat her.

Her blood ran cold. Trembling, she forced a strained smile at the man watching her.

"Sorry to disappoint," she muttered before scrambling to her feet.

She barely took two steps before tripping over scattered branches. The fever still clouded her mind, and the fall left her dazed.

Another tribesman approached the one wearing shoes, speaking rapidly in their guttural language.

Wait—shoes?

Mud-caked, but unmistakably modern.

La Sportiva.

A high-end Italian brand.

Her pulse spiked. With sudden strength, she lunged for his shoes.

The man didn’t budge.

Through the grime, she spotted the faint logo.

Her gaze snapped up.

His face was painted, but his eyes gleamed with amusement as he smirked at her.

Recognition struck like lightning.

"You're not—"

A rough hand yanked her backward, dragging her toward the flames.

"No! You can’t do this!" she shrieked, thrashing wildly.

The circle of tribesmen tightened, their torches casting eerie shadows.

They chanted, dancing around her as the heat intensified.

Every attempt to escape was met with flames thrust in her face.

Smoke filled her lungs.

The world blurred.

Then—laughter.

A distinctly modern, mocking chuckle.

Her head whipped toward the sound.

Those same bright eyes met hers.

Before she could react, strong hands lifted her—

And dropped her unceremoniously onto the hard ground.

Torches circled her.

The chanting grew louder.

She was trapped.

"Someone! HELP!"

The flames crept closer.
###Chapter 263 Savage Salvation

Evelyn Sinclair choked violently, her hands flying to cover her nose and mouth.

The acrid smoke burned her throat.

Leo, who had been playing dead in her pocket, suddenly twitched. Mama, my database indicates this is an ancient sacrificial ceremony.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. Am I about to become some primitive tribe's offering?! "Leo, you're supposed to be a tiger," she whispered desperately. "Can't you just leap out and maul them?"

The AI companion remained silent for three excruciating seconds before responding in that infuriatingly cheerful tone.

Emily Whitaker originally programmed me with 20% aggression capacity. But after Donovan Sterling's modifications...

Zero.

Mama, you'll have to bite them yourself.

Evelyn nearly screamed. I just got roasted by a glorified stuffed animal! She was about to demand escape routes when the chanting tribespeople abruptly fell silent.

Their painted faces turned solemn. Evelyn clamped her mouth shut, suddenly hyperaware of Leo's weight in her pocket.

Losing him would mean losing her only ally in this nightmare.

Then came the eerie part - every tribesperson simultaneously tilted their heads back, staring at the stormy sky with unsettling intensity.

The silence was absolute except for the crackling bonfire.

The sound crawled up Evelyn's spine like icy fingers.

A staff-bearing elder stepped back, breaking the human circle.

An ancient woman with facial tattoos entered carrying a broad leaf piled with food.

Their eyes met. The crone placed the offering at Evelyn's feet, speaking in guttural tones before miming eating motions.

When the vines binding Evelyn's wrists fell away, the tribe reformed their circle, watching her with predator's eyes.

On the leaf lay jerky, dried fish, and strange fruits. Evelyn's stomach growled treacherously.

She devoured everything like a starved animal, table manners be damned.

If they're poisoning me, at least I'll die full.

The meat was gamey but flavorful - the best meal she'd ever tasted. The tribespeople nodded approvingly at her ravenous display.

Then came the horror.

Torches hit the ground simultaneously.

Flames erupted in a perfect ring around her.

Evelyn realized with dawning terror - The food wasn't hospitality. It was fattening the sacrifice.

Fish-oil soaked branches burned unnaturally high, the circle tightening like a noose.

Smoke clawed at her lungs as the tribespeople resumed chanting, their ecstatic dancing casting monstrous shadows.

Evelyn's survival instincts screamed RUN - but where? The smoke blinded her. The chants deafened her.

When the flames licked three feet away, nature intervened.

Lightning split the sky.

Thunder shook the earth.

The tribespeople froze mid-ritual, their furious gazes snapping to Evelyn as if she'd summoned the storm.

Then the heavens opened.

Torrential rain doused the flames as tribesmen scattered.

Evelyn didn't wait - she turned to flee through the dissipating smoke when a calloused hand seized her wrist.

The "native" wearing sneakers dragged her into the jungle. Resistance was futile.

As they broke through the tree line, Evelyn glimpsed his modern wristwatch beneath the tribal paint.

This was no rescue.
###Chapter 264
A Desperate Escape

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched when she spotted the disguised tribesman.

The relentless rain transformed the night into an icy void.

Drenched leaves trembled violently around them, their rustling drowned by the roaring waves and the wind's ghostly wails. The atmosphere was surreal, thick with despair.

Shivers wracked Evelyn's soaked body, the cold seeping deep into her bones.

She paused just long enough to gulp air when heavy footsteps pounded behind them—close, terrifyingly close.

Evelyn locked eyes with the impostor. Without a word, they sprinted forward.

Rain lashed her face like shards of glass.

Her lungs burned. Her legs screamed in protest. The darkness swallowed everything except the drumming rain.

Branches and leaves crunched beneath their frantic steps. Escape was all that mattered—even if they had to crawl.

The tribesmen hurled branches like spears. One struck Evelyn's back. Pain flared, but she clenched her teeth and pushed harder.

Thorns tore at her palms, leaving bloody trails. She barely felt them.

Ahead, the impostor moved with panther-like grace, his athletic form cutting through the jungle effortlessly.

Evelyn forced her trembling legs to keep pace.

The hunters were gaining. If they caught up—

Her foot snagged on a root.

She crashed face-first into the mud, a cry tearing from her throat as pain shot up her arm.

The impostor whirled around.

"I'm fine!" she gasped, scrambling up. "Go!"

Then—

The ground vanished beneath her.

Her stomach lurched as she plummeted.

Fingers scrabbling, she caught a vine. Thorns bit into her flesh, but she held on, dangling over nothingness.

Her arms shook violently. She was at her limit.

The tribesmen's chants slithered through the trees—a death sentence.

Hopelessness coiled around her throat.

Then—

A hand clamped around her wrist.

The impostor hauled her up, his grip iron-strong.

Evelyn barely registered the pit below—lined with jagged spikes. One misstep, and she'd have been impaled.

"Run," he ordered.

She wiped her face—rain or tears, she couldn't tell—and stumbled after him.

No stopping. No looking back.

The jungle spat them onto a maze of paths. The impostor wove through them, doubling back until the hunters' cries faded.

When he finally stopped, Evelyn collapsed.

Silence. Then—

Sobs ripped from her chest, raw and violent, swallowed by the storm.

The impostor crouched before her. Moonlight revealed his true face—high cheekbones, striking eyes, features too refined for this hellscape.

"Don't cry," he murmured.

Evelyn sucked in a breath. They weren't safe yet.

She swiped at her cheeks. "Let's go."

Questions burned her tongue—how he'd gotten here, why he was helping her—but survival came first.

He nodded. "You'll be safe soon."

The promise hung between them as they vanished into the night.
###Chapter 265 He Had Never Left

A rich chuckle echoed through the moonlit jungle. The sound was warm and inviting against the eerie silence of the wilderness.

Adrian's eyes sparkled with mischief. "That's my little secret," he teased, making Evelyn roll her eyes. Still, his playful demeanor eased the tension coiling in her chest.

Following close behind him, Evelyn felt an unexpected connection to this stranger. His presence was oddly comforting in this terrifying place.

She reached out without thinking, her fingers brushing against his tattooed forearm. The skin was sun-kissed and firm beneath her touch.

"Are you cold?" she asked, already shrugging off her jacket. "You can have this."

His hand caught hers mid-motion. "I'm fine," Adrian said with a small smile. Evelyn nodded, suddenly remembering Leo curled up in her pocket.

"I'm Evelyn Sinclair," she offered. The name made Adrian stiffen slightly. He turned with sudden interest.

"Alexander Sterling's sister?"

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You know my brother? You know who I am?"

Adrian gave a slow nod. "Weren't you all over social media recently? That whole AI tiger scandal?"

"You just got here?" Evelyn gasped. The viral news was barely two weeks old.

Adrian resumed clearing their path, his voice light. "About a month before you arrived."

Evelyn marveled at how seamlessly he'd adapted to the indigenous tribe. If not for his modern boots, she'd have mistaken him for a native. The realization sent a pang through her chest.

If someone as capable as Adrian hadn't escaped in all this time... how would she ever get home?

"What's your name?" she pressed.

"Adrian Blackwood." He sighed dramatically and quickened his pace.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Blackwood? Any relation to Nathan Blackwood?"

Two beats of silence. Then a dry laugh. "Please. You think a billionaire like him would be caught dead here? I'm just an adventurer."

Evelyn nodded. Of course no wealthy socialite would willingly come to this death trap. Yet the name sent her thoughts spiraling to a certain dark-eyed man.

A thousand miles away, on a luxury yacht...

Helicopters buzzed overhead like mechanical dragonflies. Drones skimmed the ocean's surface, scanning for wreckage.

Even military-grade sonar had turned up nothing.

Lucas Sterling's phone buzzed. "Nathan Blackwood's back at the estate," Dominic Kingsley reported.

In the Blackwood mansion...

The family physician emerged from Nathan's room. Old Mr. Blackwood rushed forward. "How is he?"

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Severe exhaustion from days without sleep. His body has completely shut down. Rest and proper nutrition are critical."

Margaret Blackwood sniffed from the corner. "That cursed Evelyn Sinclair only brought misery to my son! At least the jungle did what we couldn't."

Old Mr. Blackwood whirled on her. "Enough! If the Sterlings hear you talking like that—"

"But we're in our own home!" Margaret protested weakly.

The patriarch's glare silenced her. "Do you want Alexander Sterling targeting our business right after his sister's disappearance?"

Margaret paled, disappointment twisting her features.

"Sir!" A maid rushed in. "Mr. Nathan is awake!"

The family surged toward the bedroom, hope lighting their faces.
###Chapter 266 The Weight of Denial

Nathan Blackwood's eyes flew open, taking in the familiar opulence of Highland Estates. His body jerked upright, fingers already clawing at the IV line embedded in his arm.

"Where do you think you're going?" Sophia Blackwood's voice cracked like a whip across the sterile room. The family butler and two attendants immediately blocked Nathan's path.

A suffocating silence descended. Nathan's jaw tightened. "I'm finding Evelyn."

The words hit him before they left his grandmother's lips. "She's gone, Nathan." Sophia's voice held the finality of a judge's gavel. Everyone knew the truth. Everyone except him.

The words detonated in his chest, shattering the fragile dam of his denial.

Nathan froze like prey caught in floodlights. Something vital inside him snapped. When he lifted his gaze, his bloodshot eyes burned with manic intensity. "No. Not Evelyn. She wouldn't—she couldn't—" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I left her in that ocean. I'm bringing her home."

He surged forward, only for the butler to signal the attendants. They pinned him back against the mattress with practiced efficiency. "Master Blackwood, you're in no condition—"

"Move!" Nathan's command carried the bite of an Arctic storm.

Sophia's lips thinned. "After everything we've sacrificed to keep you alive—"

###Chapter 267 Survivor's Guise

Twenty-three minutes into their trek, Evelyn Sinclair's legs had turned to lead. Blisters wept beneath her ruined shoes. The monsoon chose that moment to cease, as if nature itself was mocking her suffering.

Beyond the tree line, the Pacifica Ocean roared. Salt-laced wind whipped at her face as waves pummeled the shoreline with primal fury.

The wet sand sucked at her feet like quicksand. Ahead, Adrian Blackwood moved with the effortless grace of someone who'd spent years conquering hostile terrain.

At the leeward side of a basalt outcrop, Adrian braced against a boulder twice his mass and shoved. Stone grated against stone, revealing a crevice.

"You coming?" He vanished into the darkness.

Evelyn gaped at the hidden cavern—barely large enough for two. Seawater trickled through fissures but couldn't penetrate the inner chamber. Adrian squeezed through a narrow passage, his voice echoing back. "Mind your head."

The chamber beyond stole Evelyn's breath. Battery-powered lanterns cast golden light over neatly stacked firewood. The air smelled of pine resin and dry earth—a paradise compared to the jungle's rot.

Her gaze snagged on Adrian retrieving a La Sportiva backpack from a ledge. Matching his boots. Efficient. He shrugged into a Scarpa windbreaker, then froze mid-motion.

Evelyn realized she'd been staring. Not with attraction, but the hypervigilance of someone who'd lost too much already.

Adrian's lips quirked. "See something you like, Sinclair?"

Heat flooded her cheeks as she spun away. "Aren't you thirsty? There's a leaf pouch by your knee. Collect seawater."

"Distillation. Smart." She seized the excuse to escape.

The makeshift container was laughably primitive. Evelyn selected the clearest runoff from a tidal pool. When she returned, Adrian had transformed.

Gone was the wild-haired castaway. Before her sat a man with military-short hair and razor-sharp cheekbones. His storm-gray eyes reflected the lantern light like polished hematite.

But it was the synthetic black hair piled beside him that made Evelyn blink. "You were wearing a wig?"

Adrian shrugged. "When in Rome."

"Who packs a disguise for a deserted island?"

The grin he flashed was all reckless charm. "Anthropology vlogger. I document uncontacted tribes." He produced a micro-camera no larger than a thumbnail. "This little guy's been recording everything."

Hope flared in Evelyn's chest. "You have a way off this rock?"

Adrian's smile faltered. "Not exactly."

"What about your extraction plan?"

"Helicopter drop-off. My pilot friend's currently freezing his ass off in Antarctica." He rubbed his neck. "Assuming he's still alive."
###Chapter 268 The Expedition South

The South Pole?! Evelyn's breath hitched as her stomach dropped violently.

Her mind raced with terrifying possibilities. Even if Adrian's explorer friend survived the harsh conditions, the chances of him coming to their rescue were practically nonexistent.

It was nothing but a foolish fantasy. So in the end... there was still no hope? Evelyn's face drained of color.

Adrian remained unfazed as he rummaged through his bag, producing a lighter to boil seawater.

"Can you contact the outside world?" Evelyn asked desperately. The look he gave her shattered any remaining hope.

"No." He stirred the pot calmly. "Haven't you considered how to escape this island?"

"I did." His lips quirked. "I assumed some fool would show up eventually. When rescuers come for them, I can hitch a ride. Besides..." He glanced at his notes. "My research here is nearly complete."

Evelyn's mouth fell open. Did he just call me a fool? The realization extinguished her brief moment of relief. What a nightmare!

With practiced movements, Adrian distilled the seawater repeatedly until it was drinkable. After tasting it himself, he passed the container to Evelyn. "Drink. You haven't had water in days."

Her throat burned at the memory. The last thing she'd consumed was that cursed rose cocktail from the flight attendant.

She gulped the water greedily, then flushed when she realized she'd taken most of it. "Is there more...?"

"Next time." Adrian shrugged. "You didn't bring much seawater back." His eyes twinkled as he noticed her guilty glance at his nearly empty cup. "Had enough?"

"For explorers like us," he said with an amused smile, "we can survive without fresh water or tools. In extreme situations, even urine can sustain life." His gaze swept over Evelyn's delicate frame. "Though I suspect you'd rather die than resort to that."

Evelyn shuddered at the thought. "Have you been posing as one of the natives this whole time?" She couldn't understand why they wanted to roast her but left Adrian unharmed.

Adrian nodded, reading her thoughts. "If you don't want to be their enemy, you must become one of them." He tapped his temple. "They're not intelligent enough to tell the difference."

If only I'd met him sooner. The memory of being tied to that spit sent chills down her spine. Without that timely rainstorm... She shook her head violently to dispel the horrifying image.

"But why did they want to roast me?" she whispered.

"Likely a sacrificial ritual." Adrian's voice took on a scholarly tone. "I read an anthropological study about primitive tribes offering unfamiliar objects to the gods. Fire purifies the offering. If you accept their food during the ceremony, it signifies you'll bless them with abundance."

His explanation matched what Leo had told her. Evelyn forced herself to change the subject, unwilling to dwell on the traumatic experience.

Her mood lifted slightly. This was the first peaceful moment she'd had since the crash. Then a troubling thought surfaced. "Is this island on any maps?"

Logically, her family would have mobilized every resource to find her. If they couldn't locate the crash site, they'd expand the search radius. Yet days had passed with no sign of rescue.

Had the world forgotten her? Did this island even exist?

Adrian's expression darkened. "It is on maps, but..." He hesitated. "This area is designated an international no-go zone."

He explained how pirates infested the surrounding waters for hundreds of nautical miles. Any ship passing through risked international incidents and heavy losses. The pirates even used special technology to obscure the island from satellite imaging.

Evelyn felt like an anvil had crushed her chest. Just when she thought things couldn't get worse...

"So we're trapped here?" Her voice cracked. No rescue teams would search this area, and expecting pirates to save them was laughable. They might as well have stayed with the sacrificial tribe.

Sensing her despair, Adrian offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. You're not alone anymore."
###Chapter 269 I Need Funds

Evelyn's eyes burned with unshed tears.

They must believe I'm gone.

Father and my brothers... they're probably devastated.

Adrian paused mid-motion, studying her face.

Her expression of hopelessness twisted something in his chest.

"We should hold onto some optimism—"

"What optimism?" Evelyn lifted her gaze, her eyes shimmering like the ocean under moonlight.

Adrian hesitated before speaking. "History records numerous cases of people surviving open-water swims."

"Would you stop talking nonsense?!"

"Fine..." Evelyn collapsed onto a bed of leaves and drifted into exhausted slumber.

When Leo sensed the danger had passed, he wriggled from Evelyn's pocket to investigate their surroundings.

Adrian snatched the tiny creature with lightning reflexes. "Eve carries a pet around?"

Leo's paws flailed indignantly. "Release me! I'm no pet—I'm a tiger!"

Adrian's eyes gleamed with amusement. "A talking mechanical tiger!"

Leo's whiskers quivered with outrage. This insult to his feline dignity was unbearable! "I'm one hundred percent genuine tiger!"

Chuckling, Adrian swung Leo by his tail like a pendulum, enjoying the creature's furious protests.

"Mama! Rescue me! I'm being murdered!"

Adrian clamped a hand over Leo's mouth, casting a guilty glance at the sleeping Evelyn before exhaling in relief.

"Quiet!" He released Leo, who landed with an offended huff.

The once-pristine AI companion was now covered in grime, his former adorable appearance barely recognizable.

Leo tilted his head, studying Adrian with sudden recognition. "I know you! Adrian Blackwood—the adventure documentarian!"

"Your series won five consecutive Golden Globe awards. You've got millions of followers worldwide!" Leo continued proudly. "Also, you're the great-nephew of Blackwood Enterprises' chairman. Old money aristocracy."

Adrian's initial surprise darkened at the last remark. "You're quite the little informant." When his family connections first leaked years ago, he'd paid dearly to bury the information.

"Naturally! My database accesses all publicly available information. If it exists online, I know it!"

Adrian lifted Leo to eye level. "You won't tell Eve about Nathan being my uncle, or..."

"Do indigenous tribes enjoy tiger meat, I wonder?"

Leo's eyes bulged. "You wouldn't dare threaten a noble beast!"

Adrian smirked. "Wouldn't I?"

Leo's bravado faltered.

"Mama despises the Blackwoods most of all! You're terrified she'll abandon you if rescuers arrive, aren't you?"

Adrian raised an eyebrow. This clever construct could read him disturbingly well.

For the first time in days, Evelyn slept deeply, free from nightmares of tribal cooking fires.

The crashing waves and howling wind eventually roused her.

Her first sight upon waking was Leo crouched beside her, his round eyes blinking owlishly. When she reached out, he leaped into her palm, nuzzling her affectionately.

Adrian returned with seawater.

"Mama, I adore you."

Evelyn stretched with a smile. "Love you too, sweetheart."

Adrian began distilling drinkable water—a necessity since Evelyn couldn't stomach seawater like he could.

Evelyn refused to remain idle. She scavenged reflective stones from the beach, arranging them into a massive SOS signal on nearby boulders.

Just in case any search aircraft passed overhead.

Leo grudgingly assisted, pushing pebbles with his tiny paws.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

"Call me Adrian." He sipped precious freshwater, flashing a charming grin. His natural charisma put Evelyn at ease.

"Alright... Adrian." She hesitated. "If we survive this, is there anything you'd like? I'll make it happen."

Adrian met her gaze solemnly. "I need funds."


###Chapter 270 Hold Off on the Donations

Evelyn had suspected Adrian might be strapped for cash.

Why else would he take such a dangerous job? She gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"Don't stress about money. I've got plenty to spare."

"If we make it out of here, you'll never have to worry about finances again. Consider it handled."

Adrian's eyes welled up with emotion as he gazed at her, overwhelmed.

"Evelyn, I'm putting my future in your hands."

"Done deal," she agreed without hesitation. With her fortune, supporting a friend was nothing.

Back in Montecito...

Donovan finally emerged from his research lab and learned about Evelyn's disappearance.

Without wasting a second, he boarded a helicopter headed for the open sea.

Lucas hadn't returned yet—meaning the situation remained unresolved.

Celebrities and dignitaries close to the Sterling family knew better than to intrude during their grief.

But the self-important social climbers rushed to send condolence flowers to Evelyn's residence.

This sent William Sterling—whose health had just stabilized—into another medical crisis from sheer fury.

Alexander promptly issued a decree: any wreaths would be returned to the senders immediately.

The nosy crowd finally fell silent.

Online media outlets were strictly forbidden from mentioning Evelyn's disappearance.

It was clear—the Sterlings refused to accept her death. Their love for their daughter and sister ran too deep.

Two thousand nautical miles from shore, Donovan arrived at Lucas's search vessel after ten grueling hours in flight.

They'd recovered massive debris from the plane—but not a single survivor.

The passengers might already be fish food.

With each passing hour, Lucas's expression darkened further.

Donovan found him drowning his sorrows in alcohol while monitoring underwater camera feeds.

Lucas's bloodshot eyes revealed days without sleep.

Bennett hadn't dared intervene—so Donovan's arrival brought visible relief.

"Mr. Sterling!" Bennett greeted eagerly.

Donovan gave a curt nod and had his computer equipment brought aboard.

"Put the bottle down. Father's about to liquidate the entire family fortune—including your shares."

Lucas barely reacted, his face hollow with grief.

"Let him," he muttered.

Donovan shot him a sideways glance.

"Have you considered what Evelyn will do if she comes back to find herself bankrupt?"

Lucas's brow furrowed.

"Then he shouldn't— Wait, are you saying she could still be alive?!"

Donovan typed rapidly, his expression grave.

He studied the scrolling data and nodded decisively.

Lucas sprang up, nearly tripping in his haste.

"Seriously?! You're not joking?"

In the Sterling family, William held the most authority, but Donovan's intellect was legendary.

Lucas—whose main asset was his looks—found sudden hope in his brother's words.

Donovan kept his voice steady.

"The black box was seized by Liberty's government, but my hacker contact extracted the flight data."

Lucas's eyes widened.

"Won't that cause an international incident?"

"One minute before the explosion, the plane veered drastically off course," Donovan explained.

"The crash site is here—but..."

"But what?!" Lucas demanded.

Donovan's gaze turned piercing.

"In that final minute, an unknown signal tried correcting the deviation. It came from Leo."

"The signal's last location was a thousand nautical miles from the crash site."

"If Leo functioned properly, it would've guided Evelyn to safety with advance warning."
###Chapter 271 Searching for Your IQ Is Like Hunting for a Ghost

Lucas stood frozen, his entire body paralyzed with shock.

For days, he had avoided confronting this possibility, too terrified to face what might be true.

But when Donovan laid out his findings, Lucas suddenly collapsed to his knees.

His muscular frame shook violently with suppressed emotion.

Tears streamed down the actor's face as years of pent-up grief finally broke free.

Bennett, watching nearby, felt his own throat tighten with shared sorrow.

Donovan observed his brother's breakdown with quiet intensity.

Regret darkened his scientific mind. He'd emerged from his lab too late.

With his genius-level intellect, Donovan methodically reconstructed every possible scenario.

Leo's tracker had gone completely dark - not even satellite imaging could detect it.

This suggested advanced signal-blocking technology was in play.

Their search radius needed to shift two thousand nautical miles southeast.

Lucas immediately called off current operations and redirected all resources.

Donovan continued analyzing satellite data, his fingers flying across holographic displays.

The target zone showed dozens of uncharted islands - each a potential death trap.

His silence spoke volumes. Lucas called William with renewed hope, urging him to halt asset liquidation.

William berated him for worrying about money at such a time.

Donovan snorted at his brother's wounded expression.

"Searching for your IQ is like hunting for a ghost," he muttered.

Lucas opened his mouth to retort, then wisely closed it.

When it came to intellect, Donovan outclassed everyone present. A mercenary captain questioned their new coordinates, refusing to proceed.

"It's not about payment," the grizzled veteran explained. "That's pirate territory."

"No government patrols dare enter those waters."

"Their main stronghold sits among those islands. No one comes back from there alive."

Lucas's hope shattered like glass. He turned desperately to Donovan.

The scientist hesitated only briefly before calling Alexander on a secure line.

After a tense minute, Alexander simply said, "Understood. Stand by."

At Highland Estates, the situation had grown dire.

Nathan Blackwood had been confined to his suite for forty-eight hours.

Empty liquor bottles littered the opulent room like fallen soldiers.

The once-impeccable billionaire now sat slumped in a corner, clutching a half-empty bottle.

"Evelyn..." His broken whisper filled the space between gulps.

Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton had tried everything to rouse him.

Where was the commanding CEO who ruled Wall Street? Love had reduced him to this shell.

When Alexander arrived, his lips curled in disgust. "Mr. Blackwood," he began coldly.

"What if I told you Evelyn might still be alive?"

He reminded Nathan of an early corporate crisis - when pirates had seized Kingsley Tech oil tankers.

While governments wrung their hands, Nathan had single-handedly retrieved the ships.

He'd become the only man to ever best those pirates and live.

Now Alexander laid out Donovan's theory without softening the dangers.

Money could be negotiated. But if they wanted Evelyn dead...

The moment Alexander left, Nathan sprang into action.

"Harrison!" he barked, suddenly sober. "Prep the jet immediately."

From his safe, he retrieved an antique pistol and burner phone.

Old Master Blackwood's guards proved no match for Nathan's manic determination.

The patriarch could only watch helplessly as his grandson departed.

For Evelyn Sinclair, Nathan Blackwood would storm the gates of hell itself.
###Chapter 272 The Ultimate Jinx

Evelyn chewed on the fish without expression. Without any seasoning, she couldn't taste anything but the blandness of the flesh.

The fish had washed ashore, and Adrian had picked it up, roasting it over a small fire made of dried leaves.

It was nothing but salt and fishiness—no flavor, no satisfaction.

She longed for the rich, buttery sauces of that little Parisian bistro she used to frequent, paired with a crisp glass of Chardonnay.

Adrian, however, ate with enthusiasm. When he heard her sigh, he glanced up, grinning.

"Evie, if you're not going to finish that, I'll take it." He reached for her fish.

She jerked back, glaring at him while shielding her meal. "Back off, or Leo will make you regret it." Beside her, Leo bared his teeth in warning.

Adrian chuckled. "If you're bored, we could visit the indigenous village. I'll show you around."

Evelyn immediately shook her head.

Was he insane? Just the thought of those people sent chills down her spine. Dressing like them? Absolutely not.

The sky stretched endlessly above them, a perfect, cloudless blue.

The sea breeze rolled in, fresh and invigorating. But Evelyn couldn't appreciate it.

When would this nightmare end?

Just as despair threatened to swallow her, the distant roar of an engine cut through the air.

Before Adrian could react, Evelyn sprinted to higher ground, waving frantically at the approaching speedboat. "Help!"

The boat drew closer, the engine's growl growing louder.

But before relief could settle in, Adrian grabbed her arm, his voice sharp. "Run. Now. Those are pirates."

Fear locked her throat.

She scooped up Leo and bolted. Adrian nearly laughed at how quickly she moved.

"Into the jungle!" he ordered.

Evelyn hesitated, but her feet didn't. "But—the indigenous people—"

"They're the lesser evil."

True.

They ran without looking back, their breaths ragged, their hearts pounding.

The wind whipped against their faces, sharp and biting. They didn’t dare stop, not even when their lungs burned.

This was worse than that stormy night.

Behind them, rough laughter and heavy footsteps echoed, punctuated by gunshots—warning shots.

A savage game of predator and prey.

Fear coiled tight in Evelyn’s chest, every nerve alight with terror.

Then—her foot caught.

She crashed to the ground, her knee slamming against the earth with a sickening thud.

Pain exploded through her leg.

Adrian turned, his expression darkening when he saw her biting her lip, trying to stifle a cry. He moved to lift her, but she shoved him away.

"Save your strength," she gritted out, forcing herself up. "I can keep going."

Adrian studied her, then nodded. He grabbed her arm, pulling her forward as they ran.

Her knee screamed in protest, the pain blinding. But she couldn’t stop.

She ran on pure adrenaline, sweat beading on her forehead.

The gunfire grew louder.

Closer.

Her heart hammered violently, her body pushed to its limits.

But she wouldn’t give in.

The wind howled, carrying the occasional crack of gunfire.

They didn’t dare slow down.

The pirates must have seen the SOS signal.

Ahead, smoke curled into the sky—the indigenous village.

Adrian yanked her behind a massive tree trunk, where they’d stored branches earlier. The scent of fish oil clung to the wood.

Then—

Bang.
###Chapter 273 Hanging by a Thread

The gunshot sent the indigenous tribe into chaos.

They scrambled to their feet, gripping their wooden clubs with trembling hands. Their eyes darted around wildly, searching for the source of the danger.

Evelyn Sinclair and Adrian Blackwood exchanged a tense glance.

Adrian’s expression was grim, his body coiled tight with readiness. He pressed a finger to his lips, signaling silence.

Then came the sound—footsteps.

Dozens of them, crashing through the underbrush.

The tribesmen shouted in their guttural language, their voices sharp with warning.

The pirates’ furious curses cut through the air, followed by the unmistakable click of guns being reloaded.

Tension thickened like fog.

The pirates weren’t afraid—not with their weapons.

But the natives outnumbered them. Bullets were limited.

And worst of all—they had been tricked.

"Where the hell is that explorer?!" one pirate snarled. "We followed the signal here—nothing but these damn savages!"

"Waste of bullets," another spat. "But if we find him…"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Her pulse hammered in her throat, so loud she feared they would hear it.

Then—gunfire.

The pirates fired wildly, bullets tearing through the jungle.

A tribesman cried out, clutching his leg as he fell.

The others scattered, their primitive weapons useless against the guns.

The pirates tore through the camp, kicking over tents, overturning baskets.

One of them grabbed a tribeswoman by the hair—

A war cry erupted from the trees.

The natives surged forward, their fear turning to fury.

The pirates cursed, stumbling back as spears and clubs swung at them.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"Don’t kill them!" a pirate shouted. "Too many—we’ll be overrun!"

The tide turned in seconds.

The tribesmen who had fled now returned, armed and enraged.

The pirates hesitated—then bolted.

Gunshots echoed as they fired behind them, wounding a few pursuers before vanishing into the jungle.

Evelyn sagged against a tree, her legs weak with relief.

Adrian’s shoulders relaxed slightly, but his gaze remained sharp.

"We take another route," he murmured. "Avoid them entirely."

Evelyn nodded.

They turned to leave—

A deep, mechanical roar split the sky.

Not one helicopter.

Several.

Leo, the AI tiger, poked his head from Evelyn’s pocket.

"Someone hacked my tracker," he said urgently. "They’re using satellite signals to find us."

His voice dropped.

"Mama… it’s either Emily Whitaker—or Donovan Sterling."
###Chapter 274 No, I'm Scared

Evelyn Sinclair's heart leaped with joy when she recognized the voices. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Her brother had come for her!

Just moments ago, she had been certain she would die on this cursed island. The weight of despair had pressed down on her like a mountain, suffocating her hope.

But now—

The rhythmic thrum of helicopter blades filled the air, a symphony of salvation. It was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard.

She ran faster than she ever had in her life.

Adrian Blackwood, panting beside her, found a clearer path ahead. He glanced back, his expression a mix of relief and lingering fear.

"Evelyn," he called, voice rough from exertion. "We're going home together. You won't leave me behind, right?"

She flashed him a radiant smile despite the dirt and exhaustion.

"Of course not! Once we're back, you're stuck with me. I'll make sure you never have to worry about anything again!"

She thought he was afraid she'd abandon him after their ordeal.

One more person to take care of? Easy.

In her excitement, she didn't see the gnarled root jutting from the ground.

Her foot caught.

She stumbled forward with a gasp, pain shooting up her leg.

Adrian yanked her upright. "Slow down," he warned. "What if it's a trap? We could be running straight into danger."

Evelyn shook her head, breathless but certain.

"No, it's not a trap. It's Alexander. My brother—he's a genius. If they tracked Leo, they know I'm here."

For twenty agonizing minutes, they sprinted through the jungle.

Evelyn fell more than once.

Her clothes were torn beyond recognition, caked in mud and sweat.

Her once-pristine hands were a mess of cuts and scrapes, blood smeared across her skin.

But she didn't care.

She didn't even cry.

Finally, they burst through the trees—

And froze.

The beach stretched before them, wide and open.

Three helicopters hovered ominously overhead, their deafening rotors churning the air.

Eight speedboats bobbed in the water nearby, each manned by armed, sunglasses-wearing men.

The sea roared, waves crashing violently against the rocks.

The entire scene was suffocatingly tense.

This wasn't a rescue.

Evelyn's stomach dropped when she spotted the three men in military gear standing closest to them.

Guns slung casually over their shoulders.

Cigarettes dangling from their lips.

A cold dread slithered down her spine.

The men turned.

Their eyes locked onto Evelyn and Adrian.

A slow, predatory grin spread across their faces.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

One of them barked a rough laugh.

Adrian's grip on her hand trembled.

"P-Pirates," he whispered.

Evelyn forced herself to stay calm, but her pulse hammered in her throat.

Her instincts screamed.

These were the same pirates who had chased them before.

Driven off by the island's natives, they had waited here—patient hunters—for their prey to stumble right into their hands.

And Evelyn and Adrian had done exactly that.

She stood paralyzed, mind blank.

Fear, sharp and icy, flooded her veins.

This was despair.

True, crushing despair.

Why? she wanted to scream. Why does fate keep testing me like this?

The pirates flicked away their cigarettes.

Exchanged knowing smirks.

Then started toward them, unhurried.

Confident.

They had all the time in the world.

Evelyn clenched her jaw, swallowing back terror.

"Run," Adrian urged under his breath.

She shook her head, voice barely audible.

"No. I'm scared."

Her gaze flicked to the guns at their hips.

"They have weapons."
###Chapter 275 Lambs to the Slaughter

The moment Evelyn Sinclair heard those words, any thought of turning back and fleeing vanished instantly.

Being shot in the back while running would be a pitiful way to die.

But if they couldn’t run, what other choice did they have?

The frigid air bit into their skin, thick with the acrid scent of cigarette smoke mingling with the briny stench of the ocean.

The three men stood directly in front of them, blocking any escape.

At this rate, they wouldn’t last much longer. Adrian Blackwood trembled uncontrollably.

Though he was an experienced explorer, he had never faced anything like this before.

Evelyn wasn’t faring much better, but as the pirates drew closer, an eerie calm settled over her.

Two of the men were tall and powerfully built, their muscles straining against their clothes.

The third was shorter and leaner, but his cold, hawk-like eyes were the most terrifying of all.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn with an intensity that made her skin crawl—hungry, predatory.

Even in her disheveled state, her striking beauty and aristocratic features were impossible to hide.

Noticing his leer, Evelyn glared back at him with defiance, her chin lifting slightly.

The shorter man smirked, stepping closer.

Adrian’s breath hitched beside her.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists, her pulse steady despite the danger.

She wouldn’t go down without a fight.

The man's lips curled into a mocking sneer.

His icy gaze gleamed with predatory intent. A low whistle escaped his lips as he raked his eyes over her with vulgar appreciation.

The cold metal of the gun pressed beneath her chin, forcing her head up.

He looked at her like a conqueror surveying his spoils.

His laughter, shared with his companions, dripped with cruelty and greed. "Look at this one—quite the prize."

"We hit the jackpot this time!" The men behind him roared with unrestrained arrogance.

Their stares slithered over Evelyn's skin like the tongues of vipers.

This was their domain, and she was nothing but prey. The pirates aboard the distant ship watched the scene unfold with twisted amusement.

Tension crackled in the air.

Escape was impossible—everyone knew it.

Evelyn's body tensed, but her mind sharpened.

The biting sea wind lashed at her face.

It stung, but it cleared her thoughts, honing her focus.

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails drew blood, but she barely noticed.

The acrid scent of gunpowder clung to the weapon pressed against her—a silent promise of death.

As the pirates exchanged smirks, Evelyn struck.

Her hand shot out, seizing the gun.

In one fluid motion, she twisted, yanking it forward with brutal force.

Her other hand pried at the man's fingers, wrenching them away. A choked grunt escaped him as he staggered back, shock flashing across his face.

This delicate-looking woman dared to fight back?

Evelyn didn't give him a chance to recover.

Before he could react, the gun was in her grip.

She flipped it, barrel now trained on the pirates.

A sharp kick sent the man crashing to his knees before her.

The others' laughter died instantly. Their expressions darkened with fury.

Two guns swung toward her, but Evelyn's aim never wavered—her weapon pressed against the pirate's temple.

The tables had turned.

The smug predators now stood frozen, tension coiling around them.

Evelyn's smile was glacial.

They weren't lambs to slaughter. And these pirates weren't invincible.

Nathan's eyes widened at the sudden shift. Without hesitation, he moved to her side, pinning the man down.

Evelyn gave him a brief, approving glance.

Across from them, the pirates erupted into curses.

"You stupid bitch!" one snarled. "You think this is a game? These guns aren't toys!"

Evelyn's grip tightened.

She struck the pirate's head with the gun's butt, silencing him.

"I want a helicopter."

"Like hell!" another spat. "You're dead the second you let him go!"

She hadn't expected them to agree.

But she had leverage now—and fear no longer clouded her mind.

A sharp shout rang out toward the ship.

Within moments, reinforcements swarmed the deck.

Dozens of muzzles locked onto Evelyn.

The air thickened with the promise of violence.
###Chapter 276 What's Her Price?

The standoff shifted in a heartbeat.

Storm clouds loomed over the Pacifica Ocean, its surface deceptively calm despite the brewing tempest.

A silent warning of the violence about to erupt.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on. One wrong move would ignite bloodshed.

These were hardened mercenaries who killed without hesitation.

Evelyn Sinclair was just a castaway. Yet her grip on the pistol remained steady, her aim unwavering.

She pressed the barrel harder against the pirate's temple beneath her boot, ensuring his compliance.

Her piercing gaze met the dozens of weapons trained on her without flinching.

Adrian Blackwood's face drained of color. His knees buckled, sending him collapsing onto the wet sand.

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance, whispering words the pirates couldn't catch. "Stay calm. Get behind me. When you hear gunfire, run for the jungle. Don't look back."

The explorer froze. He'd faced nature's wrath countless times - starvation, dehydration, hostile tribes.

Falling cliffs. Pirate attacks. Nothing had prepared him for this bone-deep terror.

Death's icy fingers traced his spine, turning his blood to sludge in his veins.

Yet this delicate-looking woman spoke of escape plans as casually as discussing tea.

Adrian clenched his jaw and forced himself upright, the panic in his eyes hardening to resolve.

"I made a promise to protect you." His voice barely shook. "I'm not leaving."

Before Evelyn could argue, the lead pirate barked a command.

"Enough talking! Fire!"

Her stomach dropped.

This hostage meant nothing to them. She saw it in their trigger fingers twitching with bloodlust.

Then - movement to her left. A jagged rock formation twenty yards away. Possible cover.

Her odds? Abysmal. Limited ammo against a small army.

"Wait!" She projected her voice over the cocking rifles. "Let's negotiate."

The scar-faced pirate sneered. "Negotiate? With what?"

"The treasure map in my bag." She lied smoothly. "Ancient Aztec gold. Enough to buy your freedom ten times over."

The pirate leader spat. "What makes you think you're worth bargaining with?"

The moment the pinned pirate twisted free, chaos erupted.

Evelyn sidestepped his wild swing and shoved Adrian toward the rocks.

"Kill them both!" The wiry pirate screeched.

Gunfire exploded like thunder.

Evelyn dove behind cover as bullets shredded the air where she'd stood. Hot lead pinged off stone, sending razor-sharp fragments flying.

Her pulse hammered in her throat, but her hands stayed steady. This wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 277 I'll Take Him Away

Bullets rained around Evelyn Sinclair like deadly hailstones.

In that moment of chaos, her mind flashed back to the terrorist attack in Montecito four years prior.

The picturesque European streets had turned into a warzone without warning.

Suicide bombers had detonated their payloads among crowds of unsuspecting tourists.

Evelyn had been sheltering in a café basement when she heard the child's screams.

A three-year-old girl stood wailing over her parents' lifeless bodies in the middle of the carnage.

Without thinking, Evelyn had sprinted from safety toward the child.

She'd almost reached her when the second explosion hit.

The blast wave lifted them both into the air like rag dolls.

Then suddenly - solid warmth.

A broad-shouldered man in military fatigues had shielded them with his own body.

That was how Evelyn first met Nathan Blackwood.

Blood dripped from his uniform, but his steel-gray eyes remained focused.

After ensuring their safety, he'd disappeared back into the smoke without a word.

That heroic act made Nathan a target.

Their second meeting came in a very different setting.

The underground fight club stank of sweat and blood.

Nathan was surrounded - a dozen fighters taking turns beating him senseless.

The crowd roared for more violence.

"Look at the mighty Montecito soldier now!" someone jeered from the shadows.

"Think you're some kind of savior? You're just a fool who meddles where he doesn't belong!"

Evelyn moved unseen through the bloodthirsty spectators.

She struck fast - kneeing one attacker in the groin, elbowing another in the throat.

Before anyone realized what happened, she had Nathan's arm over her shoulders.

Step by painful step, she dragged him toward the exit.

Light flooded in as the door opened, revealing Nathan's unconscious face streaked with blood.

She'd repaid her life debt that night.

Now, as bullets whizzed past her head, Evelyn wondered why this memory surfaced now.

Nathan would never know their paths had crossed twice before their ill-fated marriage.

She'd loved him long before he ever noticed her existence.

"Evelyn! Get down!" Adrian Blackwood's shout snapped her back to the present.

The pirate ship's deck was slick with seawater and blood.

Every breath brought the metallic tang of gunpowder.

Evelyn pressed against the ship's railing, her fingers numb around the pistol.

She made her decision.

If this was the end, she'd go out fighting.

Rolling from cover, she took aim and fired.

The shot struck true - a pirate screamed, clutching his shoulder.

Unlike these mercenaries, Evelyn aimed to wound, not kill.

Her precision only enraged them further.

Bullets pinged off the metal around her like deadly rain.

Adrian cursed colorfully, drawing some fire away from her position.

Evelyn gave him a grim smile and fired again.

Another pirate went down clutching his leg.

Now they were surrounded.

"No way out," Evelyn murmured.

Adrian flashed her a bloodstained grin. "Damn, Nikki. You shoot better than you look."

"Flattery won't save us now," she replied dryly.

Evelyn squeezed the trigger a third time.

Click.

The chamber was empty.
###Chapter 278 The Sound of His Arrival

Evelyn Sinclair squeezed her eyes shut. The tears refused to fall, though her chest ached with the need to weep.

She'd imagined this moment countless times before.

So many words she'd planned to say if death came knocking. Yet now, her mind was blank as the surrounding cliffs.

Sharp rock fragments bit into her palm, fresh blood mingling with old scars until her hand became a grotesque canvas of pain.

Footsteps crunched closer - the grim march of death itself.

If only she'd saved one last bullet.

For herself.

The cold steel muzzle glinted in her peripheral vision. She closed her eyes, surrendering to the inevitable.

Then - thunder.

A deafening roar split the air as dozens of military helicopters materialized overhead, their camouflage paint swallowing the sky.

The pirates froze. Their guns swung upward as one, recognizing the true threat wasn't the wounded woman before them.

Nathan Blackwood's forces descended with lethal precision. Soldiers rappelled down ropes, automatic rifles at the ready, encircling the outnumbered pirates within seconds.

The tide had turned.

Evelyn lacked the strength to lift her head, but she heard Adrian's shocked cry. "Nathan! Uncle Nathan! It's me!"

Her eyelids fluttered open.

Against the backdrop of churning waves, a figure emerged from the nearest helicopter. Towering in a black trench coat, his ice-cold gaze burned with barely restrained fury.

Nathan Blackwood descended like vengeance personified, gun in hand, the storm itself seeming to part for him.

All traces of his usual aristocratic composure had vanished. This was the ruthless man she'd first met on those dangerous European streets.

Her vision blurred. Consciousness slipped through her fingers like sand. As strong arms lifted her, she heard her name torn from his throat - raw, desperate.

How strange, she thought dimly. Nathan Blackwood... afraid?

Then darkness claimed her.

The battle erupted with hurricane force. Unlike Evelyn, Nathan's men showed no mercy. Each gunshot, each cry, fueled their bloodlust.

Inside the helicopter, Lucas gently took Evelyn from Nathan's arms. She weighed nothing - a broken bird in bloodstained clothes.

Nathan's attention snapped to a wiry pirate shouting obscenities. The captain. The one who'd hurt her.

"Vincent," Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. "You touched what's mine."

The pirate captain spat on the sand. "That bitch nearly blew my head off!"

Nathan's smile turned predatory. "Then she showed remarkable restraint." Pride laced his words. "My Evelyn always was extraordinary."

Vincent raised his gun. "I let you live once. Big mistake."

"Indeed." Nathan didn't flinch. "Your last."

The standoff crackled with tension. Though outgunned, the pirates held their ground. Finally, Vincent signaled his men to lower their weapons.

"Let's negotiate, Blackwood." He held up five fingers. "For her." A jerk of his chin toward Adrian. "Double for the boy."

Nathan didn't even glance at his nephew. "He's worthless."
###Chapter 279 The Woman Who Saved You

The massive helicopter blades whirred violently as Nathan Blackwood stood at the open door, his coat whipping in the harsh wind. His piercing gaze locked onto the pirate captain below.

"Fifteen billion dors," he declared, his voice cutting through the noise like ice. "Three times your asking price. It's already in your account."

Five billion per person - but he'd paid for three. This wasn't generosity. This was a statement.

The pirate captain's hawkish eyes gleamed with greed. This haul exceeded his wildest dreams. But his triumph was short-lived.

BANG!

The gunshot echoed across the deck. The captain staggered, his smirk frozen as crimson bloomed across his chest.

Nathan lowered the smoking pistol without flinching. His expression remained glacial. "That bullet's complimentary. No one touches Evelyn Sinclair and lives." His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Three lives for fifteen billion. A fair trade."

Tension crackled in the air as weapons clicked into ready positions. But the pirates stood no chance - Nathan's fleet of attack helicopters darkened the sky, their shadows swallowing the ship whole.

Defeated, the pirates could only watch as Nathan's aircraft disappeared over the horizon.

Two thousand nautical miles away, aboard a luxury cruiser...

Evelyn tossed fitfully in her medical bed, trapped in nightmares of gunfire and blood. In her dreams, she was still running - dodging bullets, gasping for air - until the ground vanished beneath her.

She jolted awake with a gasp, only to be pulled back under by the heavy veil of sedation.

Through the fog, she caught fragments of conversation outside her door:

"That woman of yours is something else, Blackwood!" The unfamiliar voice held awe. "Facing down armed pirates? Wounding two of them? If I hadn't heard it from Captain Moretti himself..."

A ghost of a smile touched Nathan's lips. "She's always been fearless." Not the type to beg - not when her car was sabotaged, not when Victoria Ashford sent thugs after her.

Pride warred with terror in his chest. That bravery nearly got her killed. If he'd arrived minutes later...

The military doctor rummaged through his bag. "You know... she reminds me of that girl. The one who saved you from those boxers in Europe years ago." He pulled out a faded photograph. "Look at this resemblance!"

Nathan's face drained of color. The world seemed to tilt on its axis.

Inside the cabin, Evelyn stirred at the sudden silence before slipping back into unconsciousness. Warm fingers laced through hers - rough yet comforting - as distant murmurs washed over her like waves.

On deck, the sunset painted the Pacifica Ocean in fiery hues. Donovan Sterling cradled Leo in his lap, sipping sparkling water as the ship cut through the waves. They'd been racing toward Montecito at full speed for ten days - just two more remained.

He didn't turn at the approaching footsteps. "She'll be fine, Nathan. The bullet missed everything vital."

Nathan's silhouette had grown gaunt, his usual commanding presence now edged with something darker. Something desperate.

Donovan studied him - really studied him - for the first time. The man who'd moved heaven and earth to rescue his sister. The man who might finally be worthy of her.
###Chapter 280 Do You Wish It Was Her?

Nathan Blackwood would never forget that moment on the helicopter. His arms were wrapped tightly around Evelyn Sinclair's unconscious, bloodied form, refusing to let go. Silent tears streaked down his face, leaving glistening trails.

The helicopter was packed with Nathan's military comrades. Their shocked expressions spoke volumes as they witnessed this unprecedented display of emotion from their usually stoic leader.

Thankfully, Maxwell Carter, their unit's medic, was aboard. He administered emergency treatment before performing surgery aboard the cruise ship. Throughout the entire procedure, Nathan never left Evelyn's side.

His unblinking gaze remained fixed on her pale face, as if fearing she might vanish if he looked away. When Maxwell extracted the bullet, Nathan's tension was palpable.

Beads of sweat dotted his forehead, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. No one could tell whether it was rage or anguish contorting his features. When the surgery concluded, Maxwell shot him an exasperated look.

"That was the most stressful operation I've ever performed! Every incision I made, you glared like you wanted to skin me alive."

"Maybe I should return the favor," Nathan growled, his bloodshot eyes burning with intensity. Maxwell stormed out in frustration.

Had they not been close friends, their relationship might have ended right then. Donovan Sterling observed everything from the corner.

Nathan's actions left Donovan no choice but to reconsider his stance toward the man who'd saved his sister. He'd been competing with Lucas Sterling over who would care for Evelyn.

Using his numerical advantage, Nathan consistently barred Lucas from the room, provoking colorful curses from the younger Sterling brother.

Only Donovan didn't interfere with Nathan's vigil. He understood the depth of Nathan's feelings for Evelyn surpassed anyone's comprehension. Now Nathan stood alone on the deck, his expression unreadable.

In his hands trembled a photograph captured by a European street photographer. His grip was so tight his knuckles bleached white. The shocking image had been displayed in a café opposite an underground fight club.

Nathan's memory only recalled a woman's retreating figure leading him toward blinding light. That sunlight piercing the darkness had resurrected him. The photograph showed her face.

The crimson dress made her glow with regal brilliance.

Yet the darkness behind her engulfed his battered form. In the frame, Nathan appeared broken and bloodied while she stood resolute, each step radiating determination.

When Nathan first saw the image, his eyes widened in disbelief before flooding red. The contrast of her courage against his vulnerability was staggering.

"Did I truly know her? Is this really Evelyn?" His voice emerged rough, layered with disbelief and something deeper.

Donovan studied him sidelong, a knowing smile playing on his lips. "Do you wish it was her, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's mouth compressed into a thin line.

Countless questions tangled in his mind, forming an impenetrable knot. Why was she there? Why was she the one who carried me out? Why did she never speak of this?

The answers eluded him, but Nathan sensed their significance outweighed his very existence.
###Chapter 281 Calling Her Sis

Inside Evelyn's luxurious cabin.

The space was immaculate, designed with elegant comfort in mind. Sunlight streamed through the panoramic windows, casting golden patterns across the polished teak floors.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open to Lucas's ecstatic shout. "She's awake! Evelyn's awake!" His voice nearly shattered her eardrums, yet warmth flooded her chest at the sound.

Outside, gentle waves lapped against the yacht's hull, their rhythmic tapping creating a soothing melody. The Pacifica Ocean stretched endlessly beneath a cloudless cerulean sky.

Evelyn attempted to move her bandaged hands, the thick gauze making them feel foreign and unwieldy.

Lucas perched on the edge of her bed, his usually vibrant eyes rimmed red. "Lil E," his voice cracked, "I've been searching these waters for days since your plane went down. Now that I've got you back..." He swallowed hard. "Name anything - it's yours."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. The scene felt surreal, like a beautiful dream, until the sharp scent of antiseptic grounded her in reality.

She was alive. Against all odds, she'd survived.

Taking in Lucas's disheveled appearance - his usually perfect hair in tangles, the shadows beneath his eyes - she managed a weak chuckle. "I'll hold you to that."

Evelyn had never hesitated to exploit her brothers' generosity. Lucas nodded vigorously, his relief palpable.

The cabin door burst open suddenly.

"Evelyn?" Nathan's deep voice carried cautious hope. Hearing him, Evelyn stiffened slightly before turning her head.

Nathan Blackwood stood in the doorway, his tailored suit wrinkled, his aristocratic features drawn with exhaustion. She remembered seeing him descend from a helicopter on that godforsaken island, though she'd assumed it was a hallucination.

Yet here he was in the flesh, having somehow extracted her from that bullet-riddled nightmare.

His stormy gray eyes brimmed with unspoken emotion. Evelyn lowered her gaze, offering a polite, distant smile. "Mr. Blackwood. I owe you my thanks."

Nathan flinched as if struck, his already pale complexion turning ashen. To her, he remained an outsider. "I... I'm just glad you're safe," he managed.

Despite the clear rejection, he moved forward with fluid grace, adjusting her pillows with practiced efficiency. "Are you in pain? Would you like something to eat?"

Evelyn's smile froze. "I'm fine, thank you." She turned back to Lucas. "Lucas, some water please?"

Lucas practically leapt to comply, shooting Nathan a triumphant look as he handed Evelyn a crystal glass.

Just as her fingers brushed the glass, Nathan intercepted, his touch feather-light on her wrist. "Wait."

From the bedside table, he produced a straw - clearly placed there in anticipation - and inserted it into the water. "This way you won't strain your stitches." His voice softened as he guided the glass to her lips. "Slowly now."

Lucas rolled his eyes dramatically. "Oh please, it's just a damn straw."

Evelyn found the gesture oddly intimate but drank gratefully. The cool mineral water tasted like ambrosia after days of barely potable filtered seawater.

Before she could set the glass down, Nathan had already taken it from her trembling grasp.

The sound of multiple footsteps interrupted them.

"Sis!" A chorus of male voices filled the cabin doorway. "We heard you were awake!" "How are you feeling, sis?" "You're insane - taking on pirates single-handedly!" "No one's ever escaped Vincent Moretti's crew before!"

"Give her space," someone admonished. "Let her rest."

Evelyn blinked at the group of rugged men crowding her doorway. Each bore the unmistakable bearing of special forces operatives - the same soldiers who'd descended from those helicopters on the island.

But why on earth were they calling her "sis"?
###Chapter 282 The Reason He Called You His Heartbeat

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in confusion at the doctor's words. Nathan Blackwood rubbed his nose awkwardly, rising from his chair while stealing hesitant glances at Evelyn's face.

The moment he turned toward the soldiers crowding the doorway, his expression darkened. "Enough chatter!" His commanding voice instantly silenced the room, though the men continued straining their necks to catch another glimpse of Evelyn.

She chuckled softly, addressing the group by the door. "Thank you all for risking your lives to save me." Her voice carried genuine warmth and gratitude.

Without their daring rescue, Evelyn knew she would have perished on that remote Pacifica Island long ago.

"No need for thanks, sis! We're all Montecitans here," one soldier called out. "And we're damn proud of what you did! Besides Commander Blackwood, you're the only person crazy enough to point a gun at pirate king Vincent Moretti's head!"

"Damn right! You and the Commander are perfect for each other!" another added.

The tall man in the white coat sighed dramatically as he pushed through the crowd. "Medical check-up in progress. Can you animals give us some space?" Dr. Maxwell Carter shot Nathan a pointed look. "Get them out of here."

Nathan hesitated, his dark eyes lingering on Evelyn before reluctantly leading the boisterous group away. "You too," the doctor said sharply to Lucas Sterling.

Lucas's triumphant grin vanished instantly. With exaggerated reluctance, he shuffled out, muttering about unfair treatment.

Every time Lucas came to visit his sister, Nathan's military friends found excuses to shoo him away - all part of their ongoing mission to give Nathan alone time with Evelyn.

The room finally settled into peaceful quiet.

Evelyn offered the doctor a grateful smile. "Thank you, Dr. Carter. I appreciate your patience with all this."

The doctor raised an eyebrow as he prepared his instruments. "You're not what I expected from the media portrayals."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, according to news reports, the Sterling heiress is spoiled, temperamental, and arrogant." He adjusted his stethoscope. "Nathan once mentioned you could be incredibly stubborn and unpredictable."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at the blunt assessment. If Nathan had shared such personal observations, they must be close friends. She quickly changed the subject. "Doctor, how's Adrian - the young man who left the island with me?"

Dr. Carter paused his examination. "Recovering well. Eating and sleeping normally now that Nathan's finished beating some sense into him."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Nathan beat him? Why?"

"You didn't know? That reckless explorer is Nathan's nephew. The Blackwood family cut off his funding when he chose adventuring over business school, but the kid somehow scraped together resources and disappeared to that godforsaken island alone."

Dr. Carter shook his head. "The Blackwoods reported him missing three months ago. If not for rescuing you, he might still be lost out there."

Evelyn's breath caught as memories surfaced - her semi-conscious state on the boat, Adrian shouting "Uncle Nathan!" The realization struck her: the young man she'd met by chance was Nathan's flesh and blood.

What an extraordinary coincidence.

Another thought troubled her. "Those men earlier...are they active military? Were there...casualties during the pirate confrontation?" The possibility filled her with dread.

The doctor chuckled as he redressed her wounds. "No losses on our side, though the pirates didn't fare as well. You actually took out several yourself."

He gave her an appraising look. "Everyone out there served with Nathan in the same special forces unit. That stretch of ocean around Pacifica Island? Pirate territory. No government would authorize an official rescue mission."

Dr. Carter's voice lowered. "Nathan had to personally beg our former commanding officer for this operation. We came as private citizens to avoid international incidents."

Evelyn's chest tightened as if struck by a sledgehammer. The doctor's words made her realize the depth of what Nathan had risked for her.

"Thank you," she whispered. "If you hadn't come..."

The doctor shook his head, his expression turning solemn. "If you want to thank someone, thank him. We all know you're divorced, but every man here followed Nathan without hesitation." He met her gaze squarely. "Because he told us you're his heartbeat."

A heavy silence filled the room.

"We couldn't let our brother lose the reason his heart still beats."
###Chapter 283 We're Not Bankrupt, Are We?

Evelyn Sinclair felt her breath catch in her throat. A tremor ran through her body as her vision blurred with unshed tears.

She ducked her head quickly, letting her hair fall like a curtain to hide her expression.

Nathan Blackwood. The name alone made her chest constrict. If not for his intervention, she would have been lost forever in that unforgiving wilderness.

But how could she possibly repay such a debt? The doctor slipped out silently, leaving the room heavy with unspoken words.

Evelyn's lungs burned as if an invisible weight pressed against her ribcage.

The door creaked open to reveal Lucas Sterling sneaking in like a teenager avoiding curfew. He exhaled dramatically when he saw they were alone.

"Honestly, if they hadn't saved you, I would've thrown those idiots overboard days ago!" Lucas ran a hand through his tousled hair. "The tension on this ship could choke a whale."

Evelyn's lips twitched despite herself. "How's Dad? And Alexander? Donovan?"

Lucas perched on her bedside, fingers gently combing through her tangled locks. "Donovan's been glued to the navigation deck. Without his algorithms, we'd still be combing that godforsaken jungle."

A genuine laugh bubbled up in Evelyn's chest. "Leave it to my genius brother to calculate my rescue."

She'd never doubted for a second that Donovan would find her. The man could probably locate a needle in the Pacific if given enough data.

"Alexander's holding up. Dad's recovering at Mass General." Lucas's voice dropped. "He... wasn't doing well those first few days."

Evelyn's fingers clenched the sheets. "What happened?"

Lucas grimaced. "When we couldn't find any trace of you after the crash... Dad nearly liquidated the entire Sterling fortune to fund the search."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "Tell me we're not actually bankrupt." Her voice rose an octave. "I still have shopping to do!"

Lucas barked a laugh and squeezed her shoulder. "Relax, princess. I stopped him before he could sign anything. Your trust fund's safe."

Evelyn flopped back against the pillows with exaggerated relief. Then she noticed the clean linen gown replacing her torn clothes. Someone had bathed her, scrubbing away the jungle's grime.

With Lucas and Donovan handling everything, she could finally breathe.

"Why is Nathan here?" The question slipped out before she could stop it. Seeing him again after everything felt like reopening a barely healed wound.

Lucas's expression darkened. "Because the bastard's persistent as hell."

The door swung open to reveal Donovan Sterling, his sharp features pinched with disapproval. "Lucas, must you always jump to conclusions?"

Leo the AI tiger bounded past Donovan's legs, chirping happily as he nuzzled Evelyn's hand. She scratched behind his mechanical ears absently.

Donovan approached with the careful movements of someone handling fragile cargo. Evelyn reached for him with a tired smile. "I knew you'd come for me."

Her brother returned the embrace gingerly, shooting Lucas a warning look over her shoulder. "We needed Blackwood's resources. His private fleet had access to waters we couldn't penetrate."

Lucas crossed his arms. "He's just covering his own ass."

Donovan sighed. "Nathan mobilized his entire security division the moment the plane went down. He's invested just as much in finding Evelyn as we have." A pause. "Frankly, neither Father nor I expected him to go this far."

Evelyn's smile froze. A strange electric current seemed to race through her veins, making her fingertips tingle.

In another life, this news would have sent her heart soaring. Now it only filled her with a quiet dread. She couldn't afford to owe Nathan anything—not after their divorce.

Lucas made a disgusted noise. "If he hadn't sent that damn invitation, none of this would've happened! This is damage control, not heroism."

Donovan massaged his temples. "Be reasonable. The mechanical failure wasn't his fault. Yet he's still footing the entire rescue bill." He turned to Evelyn. "You don't have to engage with him if you're uncomfortable."

Lucas threw up his hands. "Now you're defending him? Have you forgotten what he put Evelyn through?"

Evelyn caught Lucas's hand before he could storm out. "You're both right." She squeezed his fingers. "Let's just... not talk about Nathan right now."

Lucas huffed but allowed her to pull him down beside her. "Fine. But only because you're the peacekeeping queen."
###Chapter 284 Take Care of Me

The golden sunlight danced across the ocean waves, while a gentle sea breeze carried the scent of salt and freedom.

Perfection. That's what this moment felt like.

Evelyn Sinclair sat between her two brothers, laughing at some private joke when an unexpected knock interrupted them.

Donovan Sterling, ever the dedicated scientist, excused himself immediately. "Physics equations won't solve themselves," he murmured, retreating to his room.

Lucas Sterling stayed put, his protective instincts flaring as he studied their visitor.

Adrian Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, his aristocratic features illuminated by the afternoon light. The cream-colored tracksuit beneath his slate gray coat accentuated his effortless elegance.

Every inch the modern gentleman.

"Eve, you're finally awake!" Adrian's voice wrapped around her like warm honey, his concern evident in those piercing blue eyes.

Lucas rolled his eyes dramatically. "Spare us the theatrics."

Evelyn couldn't help but smile. Seeing Adrian safe and healthy lifted an invisible weight from her shoulders.

Their bond had been forged in fire during those harrowing days on Pacifica Island. Near-death experiences had a way of creating unbreakable connections.

"Worried? Really?" She tilted her head, eyes twinkling with mischief. "You've clearly been eating well, Adrian. I can see the evidence in your cheeks."

Adrian's hand flew to his face in mock horror. "Lies!"

Then Evelyn's expression shifted. She arched one perfect eyebrow. "Speaking of lies... care to explain why you never mentioned being Nathan Blackwood's nephew?"

Adrian had the decency to look sheepish. He rubbed the back of his neck, offering her a charming, slightly guilty smile.

"In my defense, I saw the divorce headlines right before our trip. Was terrified you'd ditch me if you knew."

Lucas snorted. "Smart man."

But Adrian just grinned, moving closer with that irresistible Blackwood charm. "Evelyn would never be that cruel."

The ocean continued its eternal dance outside, waves crashing in rhythm with the unspoken truths between them.

Evelyn Sinclair felt a firm tug on her wrist as Lucas Sterling positioned himself protectively in front of her.

His chest puffed with unmistakable pride as he declared, "Our Evie's an absolute angel."

Then his expression darkened as he turned to face her fully. "But if you ever pull a stunt like this again—"

His voice cracked with emotion. "You let others take the bullet for you. Not the other way around. My baby sister doesn't play bodyguard for anyone!"

Evelyn's vision blurred unexpectedly. She drew a shaky breath.

Before she could respond, Adrian Blackwood thumped his chest dramatically. "Won't be a next time! From now on, I'm Evie's human shield. We're family now!"

Evelyn's head snapped toward him in surprise.

Lucas looked equally stunned. "The hell we are!"

Adrian merely grinned, undeterred. "Evie promised to take care of me forever. That makes us family." He leaned in conspiratorially, resting his head against her shoulder with a playful wink.

Their proximity was suddenly interrupted by a familiar towering presence. Nathan Blackwood materialized like a storm, yanking his nephew away by the collar.

"Back. Off." The glacial command left no room for argument.

Adrian yelped, rubbing his neck indignantly. "Uncle Nate! Is this how you treat your favorite nephew? You're already disowned and owe me five billion dollars!"

"Worst investment of my life," Nathan deadpanned, his lethal gaze making Adrian shrink despite their mere five-year age difference.

Adrian straightened defiantly. Youth was on his side. So was his newfound friendship with Evelyn.

He'd play this advantage for all it was worth.

"Let's not discuss debts," Adrian began smugly, only to be cut off by Nathan's withering glare. The unspoken threat hung heavier than any spoken word.

Evelyn watched the exchange with growing amusement. The Blackwood men's theatrics never failed to entertain.

Adrian might be reckless, but his heart was in the right place. And Nathan—well, his protective instincts were as relentless as ever.

The standoff continued, charged with unspoken challenges and familial tension. Evelyn bit back a smile.

This was her life now. Chaotic. Dangerous. Unpredictable.

And she wouldn't have it any other way.

"Whatever the cost, I'll pay it." My voice trembled with urgency as I gripped the edge of the polished mahogany desk.

The banker's calculating gaze flickered between me and the documents spread before us. His gold-rimmed glasses reflected the dim office lighting, obscuring his expression.

Across from me, Evelyn Sinclair straightened her posture, her emerald eyes flashing with determination. The scent of her Chanel No.5 mingled with the sterile office air.

"Evelyn will cover it for me." I turned toward her, my pulse racing. "Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

She didn't hesitate. "Of course." Her manicured fingers tapped a rhythm on her designer handbag. "Every last cent."

The banker cleared his throat. "This is quite an unconventional request, Ms. Montgomery."

I leaned forward, my silk blouse sticking to my skin. "We're aware. But we're prepared to meet whatever terms you require."

Evelyn's phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Nathan Blackwood. She flipped it face down without reading.

"Let's discuss collateral," the banker suggested, opening a new file.

I exhaled sharply. This was happening. The deal was moving forward. Evelyn's steady presence beside me gave me courage.

"Whatever you need," Evelyn said smoothly. "We have properties, investments, connections."

The banker's pen hovered over the paperwork. "And if repayment becomes... problematic?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. "It won't."

I reached for her hand under the table, squeezing it tightly. Her fingers were warm and steady against mine.

"Then we have an agreement," the banker concluded, extending his hand across the desk.

As we shook on it, I caught Evelyn's eye. The unspoken promise between us was clear - no matter the cost, no matter the risk, we would see this through together.
###Chapter 285 I Need You

Evelyn Sinclair felt a dull throb behind her temples. Until this moment, she had believed Adrian Blackwood was simply a struggling adventurer.

Had she known he was Nathan Blackwood's nephew, she would never have so recklessly promised to support him indefinitely.

"I can't possibly afford to maintain this aristocrat," Evelyn thought bitterly. Before she could voice her protest, Lucas Sterling cut her off.

"Is the Blackwood family trying to extort us? Just name your price then. It's not like we can't afford fifteen billion dollars!" Lucas scoffed, his aristocratic features twisting in disdain. "Only provincial pirates would consider that a fortune."

He turned his sharp gaze toward Adrian, lip curling. "What makes you think you can leech off our family? You'd just be wasting our resources! Get lost!"

Adrian remained unfazed by Lucas's hostility. Instead, he offered a charming smile. "Third Brother Sterling, I'm young, capable, and obedient. I swear I won't be a burden. Besides, I can earn my keep."

"All I want is to stay by Evelyn's side forever." The moment these words left Adrian's lips, the temperature in the hospital room plummeted.

Lucas felt the sudden chill and turned to see Nathan's expression had darkened dangerously.

"Don't even dream about it!" Lucas snapped, recognizing the brewing storm in Nathan's eyes.

Evelyn sighed and intervened. "Lucas, enough. I did make Adrian a promise."

Adrian's face lit up with hope.

"But that was before I knew your true identity," Evelyn continued firmly. "Since you concealed the truth, any promises I made will be significantly reduced."

Adrian's bright expression dimmed instantly, replaced by heartbreaking disappointment.

Remembering Nathan's earlier comment about Adrian being disowned from the Blackwood family, Evelyn softened slightly. The young man must have endured hardships.

"How about this, Mr. Blackwood," she proposed, "I'll have my brother reimburse you double for all expenses during this ordeal—including manpower, ransom, and Adrian's share."

She met Nathan's intense gaze steadily. This was her way of settling accounts cleanly between them.

The offer only made Nathan's expression grow stormier. His dark eyes churned with suppressed emotions as he visibly struggled to maintain control.

The silence stretched uncomfortably. Evelyn shifted on the hospital bed, her injuries making her appear paler and less guarded than usual.

The prolonged quiet became unbearable. "Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn finally said, her voice calm but firm, "let's be direct. What exactly do you want from me?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Countless unspoken emotions flickered in his eyes—longing, frustration, vulnerability. Under Evelyn's expectant gaze, he finally lowered his defenses.

His voice emerged rough with emotion, carrying years of unexpressed desire. "I need you, Evelyn."
###Chapter 286 Give Me Another Chance

Nathan's voice was hypnotic, smooth as velvet yet rough with emotion.

The intensity in his gaze was barely contained, simmering beneath the surface.

His words hung in the air like a blade, sharp and unyielding. Evelyn's face paled instantly.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Had she heard him right? He wanted—

Her? The man who had discarded her like yesterday's trash was now choosing her?

Evelyn's mind reeled, struggling to process his words. What game was Nathan Blackwood playing?

The silence between them grew heavier, gnawing at her composure.

Nathan studied her face, absorbing every flicker of emotion—disbelief, confusion, resistance.

But not disgust. That absence gave him hope. He stepped closer, fingers twitching with the urge to brush back a loose strand of her hair.

He wanted her to feel the truth in his touch.

But before he could, she flinched away as if burned.

Moments ago, she had stood unbothered by Adrian's proximity. Yet now, she recoiled from him like he was poison.

The rejection cut deep, but Nathan masked the pain with a practiced smile.

His voice was low, rough with restraint.

"Evelyn, I'm not joking."

"These past months have been hell without you. Maybe our divorce... was a mistake."

Her brows furrowed.

Then, realization struck. She turned to him sharply.

The raw longing in his eyes was unmistakable—a fire that threatened to consume her.

For a heartbeat, something inside her trembled.

Was that... regret in his gaze? Affection?

The stagnant waters of her heart rippled—not with joy, but shock.

But just as quickly, she steeled herself.

Her lips curved into a cold smile. "Mr. Blackwood, the mistake wasn't our divorce. It was our marriage."

The words landed like a blow. Nathan stiffened.

His expression fractured, the warmth in his eyes shattering piece by piece.

Evelyn held his gaze, unflinching.

If he had asked for money, power, anything else—she would have granted it without hesitation.

But love? She refused to walk back into that inferno.

"Evelyn, just give me one more chance. I'll—"

She cut him off, her voice icy.

"Don't tell me you're regretting the divorce now. That you've suddenly fallen for me?"

Nathan didn't hesitate. "Yes." The word scraped from his throat, raw and desperate.

He admitted it—she was irreplaceable.

He admitted that losing her had been agony.

He admitted that letting her go was the greatest regret of his life.

If he could turn back time, he would fight to keep her.

But Evelyn only smiled, delivering her verdict with chilling calm.

"Mr. Blackwood, whatever we had is over."

"I've moved on. You mean nothing to me now. So let's not pretend there's anything left to discuss."

She offered him an out—gratitude for saving her life, repayment through her family's wealth.

But Nathan didn't want money.

"You mean nothing to me."

Those words carved into him deeper than any blade.

A bitter taste flooded his mouth. The pain was suffocating.

Evelyn Sinclair was no longer the woman who had once loved him without condition.

And Nathan Blackwood had no one to blame but himself.
###Chapter 287 That Was Never Me

Evelyn Sinclair's long lashes cast shadows on her cheeks as she absently stroked Leo's metallic fur. The AI tiger purred softly in her lap, its glowing amber eyes half-lidded with contentment.

Nathan Blackwood stood frozen before her, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. Even as Evelyn's body language screamed dismissal, he couldn't bring himself to walk away. Not yet. Not when there was still so much left unsaid between them.

"Do you really think I'd give up that easily?" Nathan's voice cracked with emotion as he forced a humorless smile. His fingers trembled slightly as he reached into his breast pocket, retrieving a worn photograph he'd studied a thousand times before.

The edges were frayed from constant handling. Evelyn had saved his life all those years ago, yet never once mentioned it during their ill-fated marriage. Nathan refused to believe she could simply erase those feelings.

"That night in Montecito," he rasped, holding out the photo with shaking hands. "You never told me it was you."

Had he known the mysterious woman who'd pulled him from that burning building was Evelyn, everything would have been different. Their marriage might have stood a chance.

Evelyn's breath hitched when she glimpsed the image. Her fingers tightened around Leo's frame, the only outward sign of her distress. When she finally met Nathan's gaze, the raw guilt and regret in his stormy eyes told her everything she needed to know.

Ice flooded her veins. "So this is about debt?" Her lips pressed into a thin line as she deliberately looked away. "That woman isn't me."

The European terrorist attack, the underground fight rings - those memories belonged to another lifetime. One she'd buried long ago. Meeting Nathan had been both a blessing and her greatest regret.

Nathan recoiled as if struck. "That's impossible," he growled, the photo crumpling in his fist. The pain in his chest was physical, stealing his breath. Why would she deny it? Unless...

A cold laugh slipped past Evelyn's lips. "You're mistaken, Mr. Blackwood. We'd never met before our arranged marriage." She wouldn't let him reduce their painful history to some twisted sense of obligation. Not when she'd finally reclaimed her dignity.

Nathan watched helplessly as the warmth drained from Evelyn's sapphire eyes, replaced by glacial indifference. The realization hit him like a freight train - she wasn't just rejecting him, she was erasing their entire shared past.

"Fine," he whispered hoarsely, carefully smoothing the photograph before tucking it away. His large hands, usually so steady, trembled as they enveloped hers. "It doesn't matter if you deny it now. I meant what I said, Evelyn. I want us to try again."

Evelyn recoiled, but Nathan held fast. When she finally stilled, her gaze was terrifyingly calm. "Do you remember how much you despised me when I begged for your attention?" A cruel smile touched her lips. "Now you understand how pathetic wishful thinking can be."

The verbal blow landed with devastating precision. Nathan's entire body locked up, his carefully constructed composure shattering. The roles had reversed completely, and the irony tasted like ashes in his mouth.

Before he could respond, Evelyn called out sharply, "Lucas?"

The door flew open instantly. Lucas Sterling stood framed in the doorway, his protective stance making it clear he'd been waiting for this moment. His icy glare promised violence if Nathan overstepped again.

Evelyn smiled sweetly up at her brother. "Mr. Blackwood was just leaving." Her fingers never stopped moving through Leo's fur, the picture of relaxed indifference.

Nathan's jaw clenched. He'd never seen Evelyn like this - not angry, not heartbroken, just...done. The finality in her eyes terrified him more than any outburst ever could.

"Get out," Lucas snapped, stepping between them. His hatred was palpable. Anyone who hurt his sister was dead to him.

Evelyn had already turned away, her attention fixed on the cityscape beyond the windows. Nathan's throat worked as he fought for words that wouldn't come. In the end, all he could manage was a broken, "Rest well."

He paused at the threshold, shoulders hunched beneath an invisible weight. "My feelings won't change," he said quietly. "Maybe you can't believe that yet...but I'll spend the rest of my life proving it."

The door clicked shut behind him with awful finality.

Lucas immediately rounded on his sister. "What the hell was that about?" His protective instincts were on high alert, ready to hunt Nathan down if necessary.

But Evelyn just shook her head, her fingers tightening around Leo's frame as she stared at the spot where Nathan had stood. The photograph might have been tucked away, but its ghost still lingered between them - a reminder of everything they'd lost, and everything that could never be.
###Chapter 288 His Heart in Pieces

The door stood firmly between them, its soundproofing so impeccable that not a single whisper escaped.

Nathan remained oblivious to the conversation inside. That cryptic remark from Lucas had left him burning with curiosity. Evelyn bit her lower lip.

Her lashes fluttered downward as she murmured, "It's nothing. Lucas, how soon can we return home?"

"Two days, maybe three." His brow furrowed deeply.

"If there's something you're not telling me, I swear I'll make that bastard Nathan Blackwood pay." Leo peeked out from Evelyn's arms, his mechanical whiskers twitching.

"Mama said no to Papa," the AI tiger said mournfully. "Papa's heart is broken." Lucas froze mid-step.

"Papa? You mean Nathan Blackwood?!" Leo sighed dramatically, swinging his tiny paws. "The Great God Donovan reprogrammed me to be fair. All my bad memories of Papa are gone now."

Evelyn's eye twitched. "Donovan went too far this time. He can't just alter Leo's core programming!"

The robotic tiger puffed his chest proudly. "The Great God Donovan says emotional bias corrupts artificial intelligence!"

Exchanging exasperated glances, Evelyn and Lucas simultaneously realized arguing with Donovan Sterling's genius was futile.

Exhaustion finally overwhelmed Evelyn. The adrenaline from days of survival drained away, leaving her wounds throbbing and defenses shattered. She surrendered to the fever creeping through her limbs.

Nathan's haunting words echoed relentlessly in her mind, an inescapable mantra. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the memories flashed brighter - gunfire on foreign streets, the metallic scent of blood, screams swallowed by explosions.

Nightmares came in relentless waves. When she finally surfaced, dawn's pale light revealed Lucas keeping vigil at her bedside, dark circles shadowing his eyes.

She met his worried gaze steadily. "Lucas," her voice rasped, "I need a psychiatrist."

Moonlight fractured across the restless ocean, painting silver trails on the waves. Nathan stood motionless on the deck, his silhouette carved against the indigo night. The sea wind carried his unspoken anguish into the void.

"Here to drown your sorrows, Mr. Blackwood?" Dr. Maxwell Carter's teasing tone cut through the silence. He'd never seen the famously unflappable billionaire so visibly shaken by a woman's rejection.

Nathan's chiseled profile revealed nothing at first glance. But the military doctor recognized the storm beneath - that particular brand of helpless rage only love could inspire.

"She'll never forgive me." The words scraped raw from Nathan's throat.

Maxwell arched an eyebrow. "You saved her life. Surely that counts for something?"

A bitter laugh escaped Nathan. "She stopped hating me months ago." His knuckles whitened on the railing. "Not hating someone isn't the same as loving them."

The Blackwood and Sterling empires might be financially inseparable, but Evelyn Sinclair would carve out her own path - one that deliberately avoided his.

Maxwell clapped Nathan's shoulder. "Listen, you absolutely deserved that epic screwup six years ago. But if she's your person? Fight like hell. Otherwise what was the point of our SEAL team risking their necks?"

A reluctant smile tugged at Nathan's lips. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly. "The team got back safely?"

"Had to split up. You know how authorities react to multiple military choppers entering airspace." Maxwell hesitated. "By the way, your brother-in-law Donovan asked about trauma specialists today. Do you think Ms. Sterling—"

He stopped abruptly. Considering what Evelyn endured, most people would've shattered completely. Her ability to maintain composure was remarkable.

Nathan's entire body snapped to attention. All melancholy vanished, replaced by urgent concern. He was already striding away before Maxwell finished speaking.

"Damn, I'm just the emotional support sidekick now?" the doctor muttered to the empty deck.

Rounding the corridor, Nathan overheard Lucas's phone conversation with Alexander Sterling.

"—constant nightmares, low-grade fever, but coherent. Yes, I've got everything under control. She actually requested psychiatric evaluation herself—"

Nathan's breath hitched. He would've lingered, but Donovan's sharp gaze caught him from across the hall.

Lucas shot Nathan a withering look while continuing his report. "Of course I'm taking care of Evie! She's stable now, just... she specifically asked for a therapist."

Nathan's hands clenched into fists, his expression darkening with worry.
###Chapter 289 Get Out

The call ended with a sharp click.

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Lucas Sterling, hostility simmering beneath the surface.

"What are you doing here?" Lucas crossed his arms, his tone dripping with challenge. "No one's here to back you up now."

Before this, Nathan had relied on his military connections to force Lucas—who refused to move—out of the way.

It had been pure humiliation.

Nathan's expression darkened. "I'll contact my friend—he's a psychiatrist."

The psychiatrist Nathan recommended was undoubtedly top-tier, but Lucas immediately shook his head.

"Not necessary. Alexander will handle it. You don't need to worry about it."

Nathan opened his mouth to argue, but Donovan Sterling cut in, siding with Lucas as he politely declined the offer.

After all, a psychiatrist would delve into personal vulnerabilities—and Evelyn Sinclair would never want her weaknesses exposed to Nathan or his associates.

Late that night, the hospital corridor was silent.

Lucas sprawled across the sofa outside Evelyn's room, exhaustion pulling at his limbs.

Inside, Nathan sat vigil by her bed, watching the subtle shifts in her sleeping expression—tension, fear, fleeting moments of calm.

Sleep was impossible.

His chest ached.

Evelyn always put on such a strong front, but now, stripped of defenses, her trauma was painfully visible.

The quiet stretched on.

Then—

A soft groan.

Evelyn stirred, her lashes fluttering before her eyes cracked open, dazed.

"Water..." she murmured weakly.

Nathan moved instantly, pressing a straw to her lips as he held a glass of warm water for her.

She drank greedily, awareness slowly returning.

When her gaze landed on him, she parted her lips, voice barely audible.

Nathan leaned in, his pulse quickening.

"…Nathan."

His name on her lips sent warmth flooding through him.

It had been so long since she'd said it.

"Evelyn," he answered softly, voice tender in the dim light. "What do you need?"

She was only half-conscious, her words slurred with exhaustion.

"…Get out."

Then her eyes fluttered shut again, her breathing evening out as she slipped back into sleep.

She missed the way Nathan's expression shattered.

The brief light in his eyes snuffed out instantly, replaced by something hollow.

The tenderness in his face fractured, piece by piece, until only devastation remained.

Silence swallowed the room, thick and suffocating.

After a long moment, Nathan reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Evelyn's forehead.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper.

"Okay."

Two days later, the cruise ship docked.

Lucas and Donovan escorted Evelyn onto a private helicopter, which soared straight for New York City.

William Sterling had spent days sick with worry.

He needed to see his daughter with his own eyes—needed proof she was truly safe—before he could breathe again.

The helicopter touched down on the hospital's rooftop helipad.

With the finest doctors, cutting-edge equipment, and round-the-clock care, Evelyn's physical wounds healed swiftly.

Few knew of her return.

So, during her recovery, aside from the Sterling family and medical staff, no outsiders disturbed her.

William had no intention of announcing her survival—not yet.

She needed peace.

A psychiatrist visited daily, monitoring her progress.

Evelyn's mental resilience was remarkable. Her psychological barriers held firm, her state steadily improving.

Meanwhile, Donovan returned to the lab, resuming his confidential research.

Alexander Sterling juggled hospital visits and office duties, but despite the exhaustion, he was happier than he'd been in months.

The change in atmosphere at Sterling Corp was palpable.

Before, grief had clung to Alexander like a shadow, casting a gloom over the entire company.

Now, that weight had lifted.

He smiled more.

Lucas and William kept Evelyn company constantly—meals, drinks, binge-watching dramas.

As a superstar, Lucas didn’t just provide entertainment—he delivered real-time celebrity gossip about the actors on-screen, much to Evelyn's amusement.

Then, a few days later, a popular influencer dropped an explosive video.

Alongside Adrian Blackwood, the renowned explorer, there was another key figure in the footage—

Evelyn Sinclair.


###Chapter 290

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Highland Estates, illuminating the elegant study where Nathan Blackwood sat behind his mahogany desk. His fingers drummed against the polished surface, his mind racing with unspoken thoughts.

Across the room, Harrison stood silently, waiting for instructions. The tension in the air was palpable.

"Any updates?" Nathan's voice was low, controlled, but the edge in his tone was unmistakable.

Harrison cleared his throat. "The situation with Cassandra Delacroix has escalated. She's made another public statement about her supposed connection to you."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Deny it. Again."

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, at this point, the media is—"

"I don't care what the media thinks," Nathan interrupted sharply. "Handle it."

Harrison nodded and swiftly exited the room, leaving Nathan alone with his thoughts.

Meanwhile, in the heart of New York City, Evelyn Sinclair strode through the bustling lobby of Kingsley Tech, her heels clicking against the marble floor. Bennett followed closely behind, clutching a tablet filled with urgent messages.

"Evelyn, we have a problem," Bennett said, keeping his voice low. "Olivia Kensington is pushing for an emergency board meeting. She's claiming mismanagement of the Pacific Heights Project."

Evelyn didn’t break her stride. "Of course she is."

Her phone buzzed—a message from Isabella Montgomery.

"We need to talk. It's about Nathan."

Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened. She exhaled sharply before replying.

"Not now."

But Isabella was persistent.

"It's serious. Meet me at Velvet Lounge. Tonight."

Evelyn tucked her phone away, her expression unreadable.

Back at Highland Estates, Nathan’s phone lit up with a call from Tristan Whitmore.

"Did you see the latest headlines?" Tristan’s voice was laced with amusement.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. "I don’t have time for this."

Tristan chuckled. "Oh, but you should. Cassandra’s latest stunt involves a very public declaration of love—complete with a billboard in Times Square."

Nathan’s patience snapped. "Get it taken down."

"Already on it," Tristan replied, still laughing. "But you might want to brace yourself. The press is having a field day."

Nathan ended the call and turned to the window, his reflection staring back at him—cold, composed, but beneath the surface, a storm was brewing.

As night fell over the city, Evelyn slipped into Velvet Lounge, the dim lighting and soft jazz music a stark contrast to the chaos of her day. Isabella was already waiting at their usual booth, a martini in hand.

"You look like hell," Isabella remarked as Evelyn sat down.

Evelyn smirked. "Long day."

Isabella leaned forward, her expression turning serious. "Nathan’s in trouble."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled around her glass. "What kind of trouble?"

Isabella lowered her voice. "Cassandra isn’t just after him for publicity. She’s working with someone—someone powerful. And they’re targeting both of you."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "Who?"

Before Isabella could answer, Evelyn’s phone buzzed again—this time, an unknown number.

The message was simple, yet chilling.

"You should have stayed out of this, Evelyn."

Her breath caught.

The game had just changed.

Adrian Blackwood's social media account had amassed an enormous following.

His unique identity as an explorer and strikingly handsome features made him the ultimate heartthrob.

What truly set his account apart was its unwavering authenticity - every post was raw, unfiltered reality.

The footage was always breathtakingly real, filled with unexpected twists that kept viewers on edge.

After nearly a month without updates, fans had grown increasingly concerned for Adrian's safety.

Then suddenly, his latest adventure dropped online.

Within minutes, it sent shockwaves across the internet. Adrian was deep in the jungles of Pacifica Island.

But the real bombshell? Evelyn Sinclair appeared to be with him.

The woman everyone believed had perished in that plane crash was miraculously alive! Though Evelyn's screen time was limited, the most electrifying moment came during a torrential downpour when native tribesmen pursued them.

With the camera strapped to his chest, Adrian captured their desperate flight through the storm.

Rain lashed at their faces as they sprinted through the jungle, breath ragged, clothes soaked through.

The camera caught Evelyn's near-miss with a hidden pitfall - Adrian's quick reflexes saving her at the last possible second.

Every frame pulsed with heart-stopping tension.

Even when Evelyn fell, scraping her arms and legs raw, she never complained or slowed them down.

The danger felt palpable through the screen, their survival hanging by a thread.

Viewers found themselves holding their breath, completely immersed in their perilous journey.

The video cut off just before their encounter with pirates.

The final frames showed Evelyn, disheveled but radiant, running toward the ocean.

Her dirt-streaked face broke into the most dazzling smile of pure relief.

Those luminous eyes - so full of life and unbreakable spirit - shone brighter than the emerging sun.

The closing shot froze on Evelyn laughing as she ran toward the sunrise, Adrian's voice calling "Eve!" just before she turned back.

The golden light haloed her wind-tossed hair, waves crashing dramatically behind her.

That single, breathtaking moment seemed to transcend time.

In under sixty seconds, the video exploded across every platform.

View counts skyrocketed by thousands per minute!

[OMG! Is that really Evelyn Sinclair?!]

[Our queen has returned! More stunning than ever!]

[The most badass princess is back! I'm literally crying happy tears!]

[Welcome home, Goddess Evelyn! We never stopped believing!]

[She's alive! What does this mean for the others?]

[Thank you Adrian for bringing her back to us!]

[Nobody talk to me - I'm still recovering from that "Eve" moment!]

News of Evelyn's survival dominated headlines worldwide.

Media outlets scrambled for exclusive coverage, some staking out Adrian's production office, others camping outside Sterling Tower.

The frenzy exceeded all expectations.

Meanwhile, completely unaware of the chaos she'd ignited, Evelyn rested peacefully in her hospital room.

Lucas Sterling fussed over her, bringing an endless parade of gourmet meals.

Leo purred contentedly in William Sterling's lap, tail flicking happily.

Their peaceful bubble remained intact until the first wave of reporters hit the hospital.

Doctors, nurses, and security formed a human barricade, but the press pack wasn't giving up easily.
###Chapter 291 I Want to Fly My Own Plane

Hearing those familiar voices, Evelyn Sinclair's brows knitted together.

"That sounds like Isabella Montgomery," Lucas Sterling murmured doubtfully. He rose from his chair and stepped outside, returning moments later with Isabella, Natalie Beaumont, and Sebastian Hart in tow.

All three visitors had red-rimmed eyes.

Isabella rushed forward the moment she spotted Evelyn. "Evie!" Natalie moved to embrace her too, but Lucas caught her sleeve.

"One at a time!" Lucas chided. "Don't jostle my sister's injuries!" Natalie immediately stilled.

The concern in her gaze was palpable. "You're hurt?" Evelyn patted Isabella's back while smiling at Natalie.

"I'm nearly recovered now," she assured them.

Sebastian stood apart, looking utterly disheveled - gaunt, exhausted, with days' worth of stubble shadowing his jaw. Seeing Evelyn alive and well, he suddenly dropped to one knee beside her hospital bed and broke into loud sobs.

Isabella's own choked-back tears halted in surprise. Natalie looked stunned into silence.

The previously somber atmosphere dissipated instantly.

William Sterling, pretending not to notice the scene, stood and carried Leo from the room. At the doorway, he muttered, "Anyone walking in would think there's been a death."

Lucas watched Sebastian's dramatic display with equal parts amusement and secondhand embarrassment. Unable to bear it, he escaped into the hallway for air.

Natalie finally managed to haul Sebastian upright. "What are you crying for? Evelyn's safe - this calls for celebration!"

Sebastian continued weeping while clutching Evelyn's sleeve. "I thought you were dead, Evie. You scared the hell out of me!"

Isabella sniffled. While everyone was emotional, Sebastian had completely shattered first. "Evelyn Sinclair, how could you not tell us you were back? We mourned you!"

Evelyn's nose tingled. She swallowed hard. "I'm sorry. I didn't want you seeing me in that condition. I planned to wait until I'd healed..."

Even typically composed Natalie couldn't stop her tears now. "It doesn't matter. You're here. You survived something impossible!"

They pressed for details, and Evelyn shared her ordeal - there were no secrets between them. The harrowing experience already felt like another lifetime.

Isabella and Natalie listened raptly, but Sebastian grew increasingly sullen. When the tale ended, Evelyn nudged him with her foot. "Sebastian, you didn't react at all to my story."

He lowered his hands from his face, expression devastated. His voice cracked with regret. "Why wasn't I the one who saved you? Why does it always have to be Nathan Blackwood?"

The room plunged into silence so absolute they could hear the IV drip.

Natalie shot Sebastian a warning look, then deliberately blocked Evelyn's view of him as she changed subjects. "Adrian Blackwood released that video. That's how we knew you were alive."

"You've gone viral," she continued, pulling up trending topics on her phone. The footage had amassed millions of views in hours, far exceeding expectations.

Evelyn pursed her lips, unsurprised. Adrian had warned her on the island that if they survived, she might feature in his work.

"Let Alexander handle the publicity," Evelyn said. "I've purchased private planes. I'm learning to fly them myself." After her traumatic experience relying on another pilot, she'd decided to take control.

Isabella squealed. "That's incredible!"

Natalie, ever practical, cautioned, "Maybe think this through..."
###Chapter 292 Thank You for Never Giving Up

The online storm showed no signs of calming down.

Views and comments skyrocketed as the viral video spread like wildfire across every platform.

Evelyn Sinclair had nearly recovered and was preparing to leave the hospital.

Despite layers of disguises—oversized sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat, and a face mask—she was recognized the moment she stepped outside.

Reporters swarmed her like vultures, microphones thrust forward.

"Ms. Sinclair, are the accounts of your survival true?"

"Ms. Sinclair, what would you like to say after enduring such an ordeal?"

"Do you believe the plane crash was truly an accident?"

"Will you be pursuing a relationship with Adrian Blackwood?"

The barrage of questions was relentless. Cameras flashed incessantly, blocking the hospital entrance.

Bodyguards formed a tight circle around Evelyn and Lucas Sterling, shielding them from the frenzy.

The crowd was suffocating. Lucas, accustomed to the spotlight, knew these reporters wouldn’t back down easily.

His patience wore thin.

Without hesitation, he pulled Evelyn close and strode toward the waiting black Bentley limousine.

But Evelyn suddenly stopped.

She lifted her head, revealing striking eyes that shimmered with an unexpected sorrow.

The crowd fell silent, waiting.

Her voice was hoarse but clear.

"I’m grateful for everyone’s concern, but please—stop focusing on me."

A pause.

"Because... there were over thirty people on that plane who weren’t as fortunate as I was."

Her words hung heavy in the air.

"Every time this story resurfaces, their families relive the pain."

With that, she bowed deeply.

The once-chaotic atmosphere turned somber.

Evelyn said nothing else. Lucas guided her into the car, his grip protective.

Her survival wasn’t just a miracle—it was a reminder of loss.

She was the sole survivor.

Her brief statement resonated deeply online.

Adrian Blackwood even took down his trending video in response.

(You can truly see someone’s character in moments like this. Evelyn is a queen for thinking of others during her own trauma.)

(A heart of gold and beauty to match. Marry me, Evelyn!)

(I’m a family member of one of the victims. We believe they’re still out there, just like Ms. Sinclair was. She’s our hope.)

This last comment was pinned to the top with thousands of likes.

Evelyn, now with a new phone, saw it immediately.

She replied:

"No matter the distance—time, space, or oceans—they’ll find their way back. Thank you for never giving up."

Perhaps her words had power, or perhaps the platform intervened, but the frenzy finally died down.

Reporters no longer camped outside Sterling Tower.

For the first time in weeks, Evelyn had peace.

She didn’t rush back to work.

Maybe the desert had drained her.

Now, she indulged—shopping, yachting, binge-watching dramas with her father.

William Sterling spoiled her endlessly.

Fishing trips. Lavish parties. No expense spared.

Life was blissful.

Until an unknown number flashed on her screen.

Assuming it was a friend with a new phone, she answered cheerfully.

"Hey! Who’s this?"

A beat of silence.

Then, a deep, achingly familiar voice.

"Nathan Blackwood."

Click.

Evelyn hung up.

Nathan stared at his phone, jaw clenched.

The call had lasted three seconds.

He’d been overseas, buried in work, forcing himself not to think of her.

Not to worry about her recovery—physical or emotional.

But he no longer had the right.

He’d watched Adrian’s video on loop.

Each viewing felt like a knife twisting in his chest.

The world praised her bravery.

Only he saw the fear behind her strength.

Fresh off his flight, he’d caved and borrowed his driver’s phone to call her.

This was the result.
###Chapter 293 Who Would Want You Anyway?

Harrison trailed behind Nathan Blackwood, struggling with the heavy suitcase.

The cold aura radiating from his boss made him hesitate before speaking up.

"Sir, your phone..." Harrison's voice trembled slightly.

The driver, Bennett, watched in horror as Nathan nearly crushed the expensive device in his grip.

Recognizing Evelyn Sinclair's number, Nathan dialed a random contact instead.

This was the property of N?-velDrama.Org.

After saving her life, Nathan expected some change between them.

But Evelyn hung up the moment she heard his voice. His expression darkened as he deleted the call history and tossed the phone back.

Harrison quickly returned the phone to Bennett before catching up with Nathan's long strides.

"Sir, Mr. von Strauss invited you to the soft opening of his gallery restaurant tonight at Sterling Manor."

Meanwhile, Evelyn twirled before her dressing room mirror, humming as she selected an outfit for tonight's gala.

This marked her first public appearance since returning.

Perfection was non-negotiable.

Nathan's call barely registered - just another nuisance.

She'd show her gratitude, but never herself!

In the living room, Lucas Sterling groaned as Evelyn modeled her fifth ensemble.

At this rate, she'd try on every new collection this season. "I suddenly miss my film set," he muttered.

William Sterling arrived with a velvet box containing a breathtaking pink diamond necklace.

Each stone was rare and exquisitely cut.

It complemented the blush silk gown hugging Evelyn's curves perfectly.

Her cascading waves framed the delicate jewelry.

The harmonious combination satisfied Evelyn immensely.

Understated yet stunning - exactly her style. Lucas narrowed his eyes.

"Isn't that meant for your future daughter-in-law?" he challenged.

William rolled his eyes. "Only blind women would settle for you."

"So this belongs to my future sister-in-law?" Lucas scoffed at his father's disdain.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Lucas, this design isn't reserved for in-laws. You should feel threatened."

He choked on his retort.

As Lucas stood to accompany her, Evelyn stopped him. "I already have an escort."

"Who?" William and Lucas demanded simultaneously.

"Adrian Blackwood. My island rescuer."

Lucas relaxed.

According to his sister's usual tastes, the adventurous type wouldn't stand a chance. William nodded approvingly.

"Very well. Have Archibald drive you." The butler smiled, already preparing the car.

No way would they let Evelyn drive herself looking this radiant.

As twilight painted the sky, city lights flickered to life.

Adrian Blackwood stood waiting in a tailored suit, drawing admiring glances.

The exclusive event's minimalist decor reflected von Strauss' signature style.

While Adrian ordered refreshments, Evelyn explored the gallery.

One painting stopped her cold.

The striking image of a woman in red - unmistakably Evelyn - supporting an unconscious Nathan through darkness toward light.

Her breath caught.

"Enjoying your portrait?" Friedrich von Strauss appeared behind her.

"Of course," Evelyn recovered smoothly. "Not everyone possesses such beauty."

The artist snorted, studying his work. "That restaurant photo inspired this."

Evelyn's smile faded. "Name your price. I want this painting."

"Not for sale!" von Strauss refused sharply.

As Evelyn prepared to argue, she sensed intense scrutiny.

Nathan stood nearby, his piercing gaze fixed on the painting - and her.

Their eyes met.

Her pulse quickened.

The sudden movement startled everyone in the room.

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched as she instinctively stepped back.

Nathan Blackwood's protective arm shot out, shielding her from whatever threat had emerged.

Vanessa Holloway's shrill scream pierced the air, her manicured hands flying to her mouth.

"Who the hell—?" Harrison, Nathan's assistant, moved swiftly toward the disturbance.

The heavy velvet curtains billowed violently as a figure tumbled through the open window.

Glass shattered across the marble floor of Highland Estates' grand parlor.

Evelyn's pulse raced as she recognized the intruder's familiar silhouette.

"Sebastian?" Her voice trembled with disbelief.

Sebastian Hart rolled to his feet, his expensive suit torn at the shoulder.

His usually impeccable hair was disheveled, sweat glistening on his forehead.

"You have to get out of here—now!" He gasped, clutching his side.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Explain yourself, Hart."

Before Sebastian could respond, the sound of approaching vehicles echoed from outside.

Red and blue lights flashed through the broken window, painting the walls in eerie hues.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Police?"

Vanessa's laughter rang out, sharp and triumphant. "Oh, this is perfect."

Isabella Montgomery grabbed Evelyn's arm. "We need to leave through the back."

Nathan's phone buzzed urgently. Harrison checked the screen, his face paling.

"Sir, it's Kingsley Tech. Their servers just went dark."

Dominic Kingsley's voice crackled through the speaker. "We've been hacked. All our files—"

The line went dead.

Evelyn met Nathan's gaze, realization dawning.

This wasn't just an attack.

It was a carefully orchestrated takedown.

And they were standing right in the crosshairs.

The front door burst open with a thunderous crash.

"Freeze! FBI!"

Evelyn barely had time to register the armed agents swarming the room before Nathan shoved her behind a marble pillar.

Gunfire erupted.

Screams.

Chaos.

Through the smoke and confusion, one horrifying truth became clear—

Someone had framed them.

And unless they acted fast, they'd both be spending the night in federal custody.

Nathan's lips brushed her ear as he pulled her toward a hidden passage.

"Trust me?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

She grabbed his hand and ran.
###Chapter 294 The Art of Possession

Evelyn's body tensed instantly. Too late to escape now.

Nathan Blackwood had already closed the distance between them with powerful strides.

He pulled a photograph from his pocket. His brow furrowed as he studied the painting on the wall with laser focus.

Identical. His face paled.

"How did you—" Mr. von Strauss glanced at the photo in Nathan's hand and remarked casually, "Ah, so you're the thief who stole my photograph?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

His gaze flickered to Evelyn, but she deliberately avoided eye contact.

Evelyn's subtle makeup enhanced her delicate features. The blush-pink gown hugged every perfect curve, transforming her into a vision of ethereal beauty.

Gone was her usual icy demeanor. Tonight she radiated softness. A breathtaking sight that held Nathan captive.

His eyes darkened dangerously.

"Mr. von Strauss, this photo—"

"Yes, my work." The old man nodded proudly. "I captured that moment when this young lady pulled you from danger while I enjoyed my espresso across the street."

"One of my finest pieces. Interested?" His words shattered Evelyn's earlier denial about being the painting's subject.

Evelyn's temper flared.

"Master von Strauss! I inquired first! You refused to sell it to me—first come, first served should apply!"

The artist merely smiled at Nathan.

"I sell to whomever pleases me most at the moment."

He'd treated Victoria Ashford the same way when she'd begged for a portrait last season.

Nathan's gaze burned with intensity. A smirk played on his lips.

"Name your price. I'll pay any amount."

Von Strauss extended one gnarled finger.

Without hesitation, Nathan turned to Harrison. "Transfer $100 million immediately."

Harrison's jaw dropped.

"A hundred million for one painting? Not even Renaissance masterpieces command—"

The artist chuckled, nodding toward Evelyn. "Send the money to her. The muse deserves compensation."

Evelyn nearly choked on her outrage.

The man had gone mad! She couldn't stay another second. As she turned to leave, Adrian appeared with a roguish grin.

"Evie! There you are—" His smile faltered when he noticed Nathan. "Uncle? What brings you here?"

Nathan's face turned thunderous.

His glare turned arctic when Adrian affectionately called her "Evie." The temperature in the room plummeted.

Adrian casually looped his arm through Evelyn's. "Feel like catching a movie later?" he asked, flashing a charming smile.

The atmosphere grew palpably tense.

Von Strauss observed them with amused curiosity, clearly puzzled by the dynamics.

Adrian introduced himself boldly while gazing at Evelyn with undisguised admiration. "Adrian Blackwood. Evie and I have faced death together—we share an unbreakable bond."

Nathan's expression darkened visibly.

The old artist muttered something noncommittal before hastily excusing himself from the charged scene.

Left alone, Nathan's voice cut like ice. "Adrian. You've grown bold."

Adrian met his uncle's glare with feigned innocence. "You're divorced, Uncle. Can't two single people explore their connection?"

The air turned lethal.

Harrison frantically signaled Adrian to stop, but the younger man deliberately ignored him.

"Evie, shall we?" Adrian asked casually. Evelyn nodded eagerly—anything to escape this nightmare.

As they turned, Nathan's voice froze them in place.

"Shall I shut down your studio permanently, Adrian?"

Adrian stumbled mid-step.

"That's low, Uncle." He hesitated, not wanting to lose face before Evelyn. After a tense pause, he whispered, "Evie, go ahead. I'll catch up."

Evelyn vanished without a backward glance.

Adrian squared his shoulders, adopting a defiant smirk. "Empty threats won't change her feelings, Uncle."

Nathan advanced like a storm. "Who gave you permission to call her 'Evie'?"
###Chapter 295 You Can't Separate Lovebirds

Adrian Blackwood instinctively retreated a step. He still lacked the courage to challenge Nathan Blackwood directly.

Yet he gathered his resolve and stammered, "She—she said it herself! Uncle Nathan, you can't just tear apart—"

"—lovebirds."

The words had barely left his lips when Adrian found himself slammed against the wall.

His scalp prickled with adrenaline. White-hot pain shot through his spine. Though an experienced explorer with superior physical conditioning, Adrian might as well have been a helpless child against Nathan's ruthless strength.

His pride lay shattered beneath Nathan's polished Oxfords.

Nathan's glacial stare held no trace of familial warmth. His movements were precise, calculated.

"Adrian Blackwood," he enunciated each syllable like a death sentence, "if you're courting death, I'll happily oblige."

Harrison rushed forward. "Mr. Blackwood, surely we can discuss this reasonably!"

"Young Master Adrian was merely joking! As if Ms. Sinclair would ever be interested in him!" The assistant's intervention cut deeper than Nathan's physical assault.

Yet defiance flickered through Adrian's fear.

The thought of Evelyn reignited his bravado. "Why wouldn't she be? Evie clearly prefers younger men after her divorce."

All those tabloid rumors about Evelyn's supposed lovers shared one common trait—they were nothing like corporate titans like Nathan Blackwood. This knowledge fueled Adrian's confidence.

Nathan's laugh carried Arctic winds. His gaze could have frozen molten steel.

"Final warning," he said, adjusting his cufflinks with lethal calm. "Stay away from her. Or I'll arrange a marriage alliance for you myself." The threat landed with the weight of an executioner's axe.

This wasn't a warning. It was a decree.

Adrian's expression cycled through shock, anger, and resignation. For lesser heirs like him—those who hadn't seized control of their family empires—destiny remained a puppet in stronger hands.

Nathan released him with disdain, turning away without another glance. Harrison followed, carefully retrieving the nine-figure painting while casting Adrian a pitying look.

Of all women in the world, why choose Nathan Blackwood's? That wasn't bravery—it was suicide.

Meanwhile, Evelyn enjoyed her meal undisturbed.

Throughout dinner, a steady stream of socialites approached her table, requesting connections on social media. Recognizing several faces from charity galas, Evelyn accepted their friend requests with polite smiles.

The crowd buzzed with excitement over this rare opportunity. Nearby, Nathan overheard a cluster of young aristocrats comparing phones.

"Can't believe Evelyn Sinclair accepted my request!" one gushed.

"Me too! She's so approachable for someone so stunning—"

"Wait, why hasn't she accepted mine yet?" another voice whined in disappointment.

Nathan's clenched jaw relaxed marginally as he strode away.

Evelyn finally escaped the social onslaught just as Adrian emerged, looking like a man returning from war.

"Evie, let's go," he muttered.

Nodding, Evelyn checked movie times on her phone while following him to the car. Adrian's hands trembled slightly on the wheel, still shaken by his encounter.

As they descended the hill, blinding headlights suddenly filled the windshield.

The collision sent Adrian's luxury car lurching forward.

"Bloody hell!" He slammed the steering wheel before recognizing the other vehicle—and its occupant.

Nathan stood silhouetted against the headlights, inspecting the damage with clinical detachment before turning that arctic gaze on them.

Adrian froze like a rabbit spotting a wolf.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You're terrified of him, aren't you?"

Adrian's knuckles whitened on the wheel. "It's not fear," he ground out. "It's called respect."
###Chapter 296 The Divorced Couples Date

Evelyn arched a perfectly sculpted brow as she watched Adrian step out of his car like a man walking to his execution.

The collision had left Nathan's understated yet exorbitant Cayenne with significant damage.

Oddly enough, Adrian's Jeep Grand Cherokee remained unscathed. He still couldn't wrap his head around how the accident had even happened.

In this situation, Adrian certainly looked guilty. Normally, such matters could be resolved with money—but the other party was Nathan Blackwood. This wouldn't be simple.

Nathan's dark gaze pinned Adrian in place, his voice laced with icy authority. "Legal proceedings or private settlement?"

Adrian pressed his lips together. "Do I even have a choice?"

"Legal it is, then." Nathan pulled out his phone with deliberate calm. "I'll call your father."

Adrian stiffened. "Wait—Uncle Nathan, let's settle this privately!"

Nathan pocketed his phone and tossed his keys at Adrian. "Get it fixed. Now."

"Now?" Adrian fumbled with the keys, torn between leaving and staying. Evelyn was still waiting in his car for their movie plans.

Nathan's expression darkened. "You're still here?"

Adrian swallowed hard. "I—I'll just apologize to Evelyn later!"

Evelyn frowned as Adrian sprinted toward Nathan's car. Before she could process it, Nathan straightened his suit jacket and slid into the driver's seat beside her.

She turned to him, voice frosty. "Mr. Blackwood, are you in the wrong car?"

Nathan's expression was smooth, all traces of earlier anger expertly masked. A hint of warmth softened his sharp features.

His voice was low, velvety—dangerously charming. "No. He insisted on repairing my car and asked me to accompany you."

"Didn't you want to see a movie?"

With that, he started the engine and drove toward the city's grandest theater as if there was nothing unusual about this arrangement.

In all their years together, they had never gone to the movies. Never done the ordinary things couples did.

The realization twisted something in Nathan's chest, leaving him breathless.

Evelyn studied him like he was a stranger. "Mr. Blackwood, what are you doing? Have you ever heard of divorced couples going on movie dates?"

The idea was absurd.

Nathan's smile didn't waver. "What's the problem? Divorced couples can always remarry."

He was testing the waters, phrasing it as an indisputable fact rather than a question.

Evelyn fell silent. Her eyes were unreadable, the air between them turning frigid.

Nathan kept his gaze forward, but he felt the weight of her detachment like a blade against his skin.

For the first time in his life, he was nervous around a woman—and he had no one to blame but himself.

"Stop the car." Evelyn's voice was glacial.

Nathan's jaw tightened, but his tone remained gentle. "We're not there yet."

Evelyn gave him one long, measured look. Then, without hesitation, she unbuckled her seatbelt and pushed the door open.

Cold wind rushed in. Nathan's composure shattered.

"Evelyn—!"

The car screeched to a halt.

Nathan yanked her back just as she was halfway out, his heart hammering against his ribs. The bitterness in his chest swelled, drowning him in helpless frustration.

His grip on her arm trembled.

She’d rather throw herself out of a moving car than spend another minute with him.

The realization gutted him.

His carefully constructed calm collapsed. Pain flickered in his eyes, darker than midnight.

"Evelyn." His voice was rough, raw—pleading.
###Chapter 297 My Investments Include Everything

Evelyn didn't make it out of the car.

She remained seated, casting a sideways glance at Nathan. Her icy stare matched the chill of the night air.

Remarry him? Over her dead body! The mere suggestion made Evelyn's blood boil, even as a joke.

Nathan's dark eyes seemed to absorb the surrounding darkness.

"Why did you lie about saving me?" he thought. "The woman in that photo is unmistakably you. Why won't you admit it?"

When Nathan confirmed Evelyn's identity, conflicting emotions surged through him - frustration mixed with unexpected joy.

Evelyn laughed coldly. "So what if it was me? What difference does it make now?" Her words left him speechless.

Indeed, what could he do? Nathan's expression froze, his lips pressed into a tight line.

The usually composed businessman seemed on the verge of unraveling. Evelyn noticed with quiet satisfaction.

Her crimson lips parted. "Mr. Blackwood, can't you see? I lied because I want nothing more to do with you. That chapter is closed, and I never look back."

"Not just remarriage - I don't reconcile with anyone I've cut ties with. Move on, Nathan. We're free to marry whomever we choose. When you do, expect an extravagant gift from me."

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. Each word pierced Nathan's heart like shards of glass.

The pain left him breathless. How could she dismiss their shared history so easily? She spoke as if erasing years in a single sentence.

Evelyn reached for the door handle.

Nathan's voice stopped her, surprisingly gentle. "Evelyn, I saved your life once. Can you at least acknowledge that?"

She froze.

Half-turned, she saw the bitter twist of his lips. "Fine, no more talk of remarriage. But must you avoid me like the plague? If it's truly in the past, can't we be... friends?" He forced out the last word through clenched teeth.

Evelyn studied his face. If he could drop the romantic nonsense, she'd tolerate his presence. "Fine."

She settled back into the seat, staring resolutely ahead.

At the cinema, Evelyn's evening gown drew immediate attention. She might as well have been a celebrity at a premiere.

Suddenly, a suit jacket draped over her shoulders, shielding her from prying eyes.

"Keep it on unless you want tabloid headlines tomorrow," Nathan murmured. The jacket would help her blend in.

Evelyn's hand hovered near the jacket before dropping. "Let's get tickets then. Which film did you invest in, Mr. Blackwood?" She scanned the listings skeptically.

None were new releases. The liar.

Nathan glanced casually at the board. "Actually, I invested in all of them."

Evelyn's mouth fell open.
###Chapter 298 Came With the Tickets

Nathan Blackwood approached the ticket counter, his striking features immediately drawing every eye in the lobby.

The young attendant's cheeks flushed pink as she recommended several romantic comedies.

With barely a glance at the options, he selected the film with the nearest showtime.

His gaze drifted sideways, noticing a couple sharing an oversized bucket of popcorn and soda. A slight frown creased his forehead.

Evelyn Sinclair sat nearby, idly scrolling through her phone with one hand propping up her chin.

Her group chat with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont buzzed with ski trip plans.

She hesitated to contribute, knowing their reactions if they discovered she was at the movies with Nathan Blackwood of all people.

A college-aged boy approached with nervous energy. "Excuse me, miss. Are you from NYU? Which department?"

Evelyn blinked. NYU's campus was just blocks away. A thrill ran through her at being mistaken for a student.

Before she could respond, the boy extended his phone. "Could I get your number? Our theater group needs a leading lady."

Her starry eyes crinkled with amusement as she smiled.

The boy remained oblivious to the glacial presence materializing behind Evelyn.

Nathan's hand came to rest on the back of her chair like a territorial claim. His stormy gaze pinned the younger man in place.

"What seems to be happening here?" His voice carried the chill of Arctic winds.

The Rolex on his wrist represented more money than the student would see in years. Everything about him screamed power and privilege.

The boy's shoulders slumped as he pocketed his phone with mumbled apologies before fleeing.

Evelyn's smile faded as she watched him go. Nathan noted her disappointment, his mood darkening like storm clouds gathering.

When she turned back, her eyebrows lifted at the sight in his hands. The massive popcorn bucket and soda looked absurd against his tailored Burberry trench coat.

Noticing her expression, Nathan cleared his throat. "They came with the tickets."

She accepted this without question. Nathan Blackwood buying movie snacks? Preposterous.

Inside the theater, Evelyn glimpsed their tickets. "A horror film?" Her tone flattened as they entered.

The nearly empty auditorium held only one other couple. Horror had fallen out of fashion against comedies and prestige dramas.

Nathan moved to sit beside her when she plopped the popcorn between them like a barrier.

His displeasure showed plainly. Evelyn met his gaze coolly. "Friends maintain boundaries, Mr. Blackwood."

Harrison's advice from earlier echoed in his mind: Patience is key when pursuing someone like Ms. Sinclair. Storming off won't work.

After half a second's consideration, Nathan took the designated seat.

Progress, he reminded himself. Merely sitting through a film together counted as progress.

The couple ahead alternated between passionate kisses and exaggerated screams during scary scenes.

"Ah! Too terrifying!" the girl shrieked, burying her face in her boyfriend's chest.

Nathan's fingers tightened around the armrests. This wasn't exactly the romantic atmosphere he'd envisioned.
###Chapter 299 Stay Away From Him

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze settled on Evelyn Sinclair beside him.

She was completely absorbed in the horror film playing on the massive screen.

Moonlight from the emergency exit illuminated her flawless profile.

Her delicate nose bridge and porcelain skin seemed to glow in the dim theater.

Unlike the screaming audience around them, Evelyn watched with detached amusement.

When the predictable jump scares came, she merely scoffed at the cheap special effects.

Her fingers never touched the popcorn bucket between them.

The couple in front had long abandoned watching, entwined in each other's arms.

As credits rolled, Evelyn checked her phone with a small sigh.

She turned to Nathan with raised eyebrows. "Mr. Blackwood, is there a reason you've been staring at me all night?"

Her voice carried clearly, making the couple ahead stiffen in surprise.

Nathan's response came low and measured. "You never specified where I should look."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why aren't you scared?" he demanded suddenly.

Her laugh was brittle. "Real life makes this look like child's play." Her fingers tightened around her phone case.

The couple scrambled to leave, adjusting rumpled clothing with flushed cheeks.

A text notification lit Evelyn's screen. She stood abruptly. "Archibald's here. I'm leaving."

Nathan blocked her path. "I'll drive you."

At the theater entrance, Evelyn froze at the sight of her butler approaching.

Her voice turned glacial. "Even after everything, you had no right to interfere with Adrian. He's my closest friend."

Nathan's jaw clenched. All evening he'd studied her reactions like scripture.

This casual dismissal cut deeper than any blade.

Before he could respond, Evelyn turned toward the exit.

Something inside Nathan snapped.

In three strides, he pinned her against a marble pillar.

His grip on her shoulders bordered on painful. "Listen carefully, Evelyn."

The warning in his voice could freeze hell itself.

"Stay away from Adrian Blackwood." His breath fanned her cheek. "Or I'll make sure he regrets ever knowing you."

His thumb traced her collarbone. "You're the only one I spare, darling. Everyone else is expendable."
###Chapter 300 The Marriage Gambit

Nathan's gaze flashed with dangerous intensity, a momentary glimpse of steel beneath his usual aristocratic composure. The raw dominance in his eyes eclipsed all other emotions.

This was the true Nathan Blackwood - ruthless, unyielding, and utterly in control. As he released Evelyn's wrist, the Sterling family butler appeared at the worst possible moment.

"Miss Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood!" Archibald's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Nathan's expression smoothed into perfect neutrality, while Evelyn's face betrayed her agitation.

Her complexion had paled, lips pressed into a thin line of barely contained fury. The tension between them was palpable enough to make the butler hesitate.

Noticing Nathan's jacket draped over Evelyn's shoulders, Archibald quickly produced the cashmere wrap he'd brought. "Miss, your father is expecting you in the study."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She shoved Nathan away with enough force to make him stagger back, then tore off his jacket and flung it at his chest.

Snatching the wrap from Archibald, she wrapped it around herself with jerky movements. One last scathing look at Nathan, and she stormed off without a backward glance.

That two-faced bastard! Playing the perfect gentleman all evening only to show his true colors at the last moment. Threatening me? Going after Adrian? He's nothing but a cowardly bully!

Archibald hurried after her, casting nervous glances back at Nathan.

Nathan watched Evelyn's retreating figure, the sharp angles of her shoulders telegraphing her rage. His own anger dissipated, replaced by something more complicated.

Had he gone too far?

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Harrison. "Shut down Adrian's studio. Transfer him to our Seattle branch immediately."

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor in a foul mood. William had come home early to discuss business matters with Alexander in the study.

Lucas was attempting to bathe Leo in the sunroom, much to the AI tiger's vocal displeasure.

"You're back already?" Lucas looked up in surprise as Evelyn slammed the front door.

The commotion brought William and Alexander downstairs. William's expression softened when he saw his daughter. "Didn't enjoy the party?"

Seeing her family, some of Evelyn's tension eased. "Dad, Alex... We need to send the Blackwoods an appropriately extravagant thank-you gift for saving my life."

Her voice dripped sarcasm. "Otherwise Nathan might accuse us of being ungrateful. Wouldn't want him using that as leverage, would we?"

William exchanged a glance with Alexander. "Your father and I were just discussing that. We've reached out several times, but Nathan keeps refusing monetary compensation."

His lips quirked. "Seems money can't solve this particular debt."

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

If not for Donovan's interference, that bastard would never have gotten close enough to play the hero! "Then what does he want?" Lucas asked absently, toweling off a sulking Leo.

Alexander's smile turned wry. "Isn't it obvious? Marriage would be the most advantageous solution. Nathan Blackwood doesn't let opportunities like this slip through his fingers."

He gestured around the lavish manor. "All this means nothing compared to what he really wants - you."

Evelyn stiffened.

Nathan's behavior tonight had made his intentions painfully clear.

The remorse, the marriage proposal - all empty gestures that meant nothing to her. Whether he was sincere changed nothing.

"You think saving my life entitles him to my feelings?" The words tasted bitter.

William shot Lucas a warning look before comforting Evelyn. "Don't worry, sweetheart. The Sterling family doesn't need marriage alliances to survive."

"If he won't take money, we have nothing else to offer. Let him keep waiting." He squeezed her shoulder. "I'd never force you to marry that man again."

Lucas quickly backtracked. "I'm on your side! Evie can marry anyone except Nathan Blackwood! That bastard belongs on our family's permanent blacklist!"

Evelyn stood abruptly. "He can try all the blackmail he wants. Worst case scenario, I'll just deny he saved me at all."

The Sterling men exchanged glances before nodding in agreement. Some battles required unconventional tactics.
###Chapter 301 Know Your Place

Evelyn Sinclair finally understood the situation, and a weight lifted from her shoulders.

The clock showed nearly 11:00 pm. She drew a steaming bubble bath, applied a revitalizing face mask, and prepared for bed.

Her phone buzzed with a new notification. A friend request with a painfully familiar black-and-white profile picture - Nathan Blackwood.

The attached message read: "Let's reconnect." Evelyn's lips curled in a humorless smile.

This man had just threatened her hours ago, demanding she stay away from Adrian. Now he had the audacity to send a friend request?

Her finger hovered for only a second before rejecting it without hesitation.

Exhaustion finally claimed her. She powered off her phone and surrendered to sleep. Across town, Nathan stared at his screen where the notification glared back: "Friend request declined."

He ran a hand through his hair. "Damn it, I pushed too hard." All night's efforts had backfired spectacularly. The frustration gnawed at him like a physical pain, leaving him staring at the ceiling until dawn.

The night stretched endlessly - peaceful for some, torturous for others.

Morning arrived at Blackwood Enterprises.

Harrison knocked tentatively before entering. He approached his boss with caution; Nathan's mood had been volcanic lately. One look confirmed today was no exception.

Clearly, things hadn't gone well with Evelyn Sinclair.

"Sir," Harrison began carefully, "the $100 million for the von Strauss painting has been transferred to Ms. Sinclair's assistant, Bennett."

Nathan barely acknowledged with a grunt. Harrison continued his report. "We've also frozen all funding to Young Master Adrian's production studio."

"Every one of his current projects has been pulled from distribution. The three upcoming collaborations? I've personally contacted the partners to terminate their contracts."

"By noon, his studio will be insolvent." For the Blackwood empire, crushing a fledgling production company required less effort than snapping fingers.

Adrian had chosen this path - the rebellious heir pursuing artistic dreams against family wishes. Building his studio from scratch had been his pride. Now? Reduced to ashes in hours.

Nathan checked his watch impatiently. Noon felt too generous. His phone vibrated - Adrian calling. He rejected it without blinking.

The phone rang again. And again. With each ignored call, Nathan's expression darkened further until he finally blocked the number entirely.

Harrison's phone lit up next. Adrian's name flashed on the screen. He glanced nervously at Nathan before silencing it.

"Get out," Nathan ordered. Harrison practically fled the office. Then the landline rang - the private line reserved for one caller.

Nathan hesitated before answering. "Grandfather."

"I hear you've dismantled Adrian's little venture?" The elder Blackwood's voice carried through the receiver.

Nathan loosened his tie. "I'm transferring him to manage our Pacific division. No more of this reckless filmmaking nonsense."

"As a Blackwood, he'll learn responsibility." The old man hummed approvingly. "Quite right."

"Grandfather! Don't side with him!" Adrian's indignant voice crackled through the speaker as he snatched the phone. "Uncle Nathan's destroying me! You canceled all my contracts? I'm drowning in debt!"

Nathan didn't hang up. His glacial stare could have frozen hell over. When he spoke, each word carried lethal precision.

"This is what happens when you covet what isn't yours."

Blood relation meant nothing when crossed. With that final warning, Nathan ended the call.
###Chapter 302 Spend Without Limits

The Celestial Club glittered under the city lights, an exclusive playground for the elite. Evelyn Sinclair had just wrapped up her meeting with Bennett and headed straight for the club's gilded doors.

A host in a tailored suit escorted her to the Platinum Suite.

Inside, the private celebration hosted by Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont was in full swing. Familiar faces mingled with rising stars from the entertainment industry—most of them male. Even Julian Moreau and Adrian Prescott were there.

The moment Evelyn entered, the room erupted in greetings.

She smiled, taking in the lively atmosphere. Isabella pulled her aside, whispering excitedly, "Consider this a buffet of the finest men in the city. Handpicked just for you. Don't hold back—take whoever catches your eye."

Evelyn stiffened, giving her friend a skeptical look.

"What's the occasion? You just got back from that hellish expedition!"

"Exactly!" Isabella grinned. "You've seen enough horrors. Now it's time to feast your eyes on something beautiful."

Evelyn exhaled, amused. The gesture was excessive, but she appreciated the thought.

"Thank you," she chuckled.

"We knew you'd love it!" Natalie chimed in.

Evelyn shook her head. What kind of friends did she have?

Her phone buzzed—Adrian Blackwood, asking for her location. After a brief hesitation, she sent him the address.

"Mind if someone joins us later?" she asked.

Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "As long as it's a man, bring as many as you want!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She should've known better.

The room buzzed with laughter, clinking glasses, and playful banter. Models and actors loosened up, trading jokes and singing off-key.

Within twenty minutes, Adrian arrived, his usual confidence replaced by visible distress. He made a beeline for Evelyn.

"Eve, I need your help." His voice was rough with frustration.

She arched a brow. "What's wrong?"

Adrian clenched his jaw. "Nathan bankrupted my studio. I'm drowning in debt. He wants me under his thumb, working for him like some corporate drone."

Evelyn studied him—the disheveled hair, the shadows under his eyes. This wasn't the fearless adventurer she knew.

She took a slow sip of wine, then reached into her purse. "Will $100 million cover it?"

Adrian froze. The card she held out was the same one Nathan had given her for the von Strauss painting.

His stunned silence made her smile. Warm. Uncomplicated. "Didn't I tell you? Money's never been an issue for me."

She pressed the card into his hand. "If this is your dream, I'll support it."

Adrian stared at her, speechless. He'd come expecting her to mediate, to soften Nathan's stance—not this.

His throat tightened. "Eve, you're—"

"Don't." She raised a hand. "We're friends. This is nothing."

A slow grin spread across his face as he pocketed the card. "I never thought I'd meet a woman who gets me like this." He leaned in, voice dropping. "From now on, my heart—and everything else—is yours."

Evelyn laughed, pushing him away. "Not necessary."
###Chapter 303 Reborn

Evelyn Sinclair met Adrian Blackwood's gaze with cool indifference. She had no use for his affections or his empty promises.

His so-called "deep love" was nothing more than greed wrapped in pretty words. The thought lifted any guilt from her shoulders.

Without ceremony, Adrian took the money that would save his failing expedition dreams. From inside the private booth, Natalie Beaumont and Isabella Montgomery burst into laughter.

Isabella playfully nudged Evelyn's shoulder. "Damn, girl! That's how a Sterling heiress handles business!"

Evelyn tossed her golden hair. "Damn right I am!" The bass-heavy music pulsed through the Velvet Lounge.

The exclusive club buzzed with energy, each patron lost in their own world of champagne and secrets.

Evelyn's head spun slightly from one too many martinis. She pushed through the velvet curtains toward the restroom.

As she turned the corner, she collided with a woman whose shriek could shatter crystal.

"Watch where you're going, you drunken fool!" The woman brushed imaginary dirt from her designer dress. "This is a Valentino! Could you even afford the dry cleaning?"

The voice cut through Evelyn's haze like ice water. She looked up to see Margaret Blackwood - Nathan's mother - glaring down her nose.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Mrs. Blackwood." Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile.

Margaret froze mid-tirade. She'd come to question staff about Sophia's disappearance, not face the woman who haunted her family.

In the past, Margaret could reduce Evelyn to tears with a glance. But now? Now Evelyn Sinclair commanded respect even Old Man Blackwood couldn't ignore.

Margaret's expression cycled through shock, rage, and forced politeness. Evelyn found the display utterly delicious.

"Oh. It's you." Margaret's voice lost its venom. She remembered Nathan's decree after Evelyn's miraculous return: "Evelyn is the only woman I'll ever marry. Cross her, and you answer to me."

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the pristine dress. "Name your price. I'll have my assistant write you a check."

"That won't be necessary." Margaret straightened her spine. She wouldn't grovel, but she wouldn't provoke either.

Behind Evelyn, Isabella's voice carried through the open door. "Hurry back, Evie! Your harem's getting restless!"

Margaret's nostrils flared. "Wait."

Evelyn paused. "Yes?"

"We need to talk." Margaret's tone brooked no argument.

"About?"

"Come." Margaret swept into an adjacent lounge like a queen holding court.

Evelyn almost laughed at the audacity. Yet curiosity won out. What could the Blackwood matriarch possibly want?

The private room reeked of Margaret's superiority complex. She perched on the leather sofa like it might contaminate her.

"Make it quick, Mrs. Blackwood." Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch. "I have thirteen heartbroken men waiting."

Margaret's jaw tightened. "Since my son is foolish enough to want you back, you'd do well to clean up your scandalous behavior."
###Chapter 304 My Lovers

Margaret Blackwood's words hung in the air, making Evelyn Sinclair's expression freeze for a split second.

Then, Evelyn burst into laughter. "What does it matter whether Nathan is willing or not? It's not like I would ever agree."

Where did Margaret get such confidence? Why should Evelyn care about her personal life just because of Nathan's one-sided feelings? How absurd!

Margaret's face twisted in irritation.

"In a few days, Patriarch Blackwood will personally propose a marriage alliance with your Sterling family. This union will only benefit both families."

"Where else would you find a family as prestigious as ours?"

Margaret already felt they were being generous by allowing Evelyn back into their circle. What right did she have to act so high and mighty?

Evelyn was a divorced woman. Even with her family's status, most noble families would hesitate.

So why was she being so picky?

Since Margaret had extended an olive branch, Evelyn should have grabbed it without hesitation.

Evelyn's smile vanished, her eyes turning icy.

Her voice was sharp and clear. "I suggest you save yourself the embarrassment of coming to my doorstep."

"Even if I marry a stranger off the street, I would never choose your family. Don’t disgust me."

Margaret's face flushed with rage.

"Do you really think you have a say in this? Nathan saved your life! If it weren’t for him, you’d be dead!"

Evelyn stared at her indifferently. "So what if he did?"

"If you dare, come and see whether I can decide for myself."

Evelyn made her stance crystal clear.

"And no one gets to dictate my personal life."

"I won’t give up any of my thirteen lovers. Would the Blackwood family really tolerate that for the sake of this alliance?"

Suddenly, Evelyn felt grateful to Isabella and Natalie for throwing this party.

She had said everything she needed to. If they still insisted on humiliating themselves, that was their problem.

Margaret scoffed. "Evelyn, I never wanted to accept you, but Nathan is obsessed! He sent Sophia away and swore he must be with you!"

"Fine. In the future, even if you beg on your knees, don’t expect to step into our home!"

She trembled with fury.

Even if Nathan married Evelyn, Margaret would never get along with her.

Evelyn smirked. "Perfect. Keep your son in check and tell him to stop bothering me."

With that, she turned and walked back to her thirteen lovers, leaving Margaret fuming.

Margaret took several deep breaths before she could calm down.

As she passed Evelyn’s private room, she discreetly snapped a photo.

Evelyn was surrounded by handsome young men, the scene looking far too intimate.

Satisfied, Margaret sent the picture to Nathan.

Now he would finally see Evelyn for who she really was—and whether she was worth his devotion.

Natalie frowned as she watched Margaret leave.

She squeezed Evelyn’s wrist and glanced outside. "That old hag was definitely filming us."

One of Julian Moreau’s co-stars immediately stood and closed the door.

Natalie gave him a grateful smile.

Evelyn took a sip of wine, unfazed. "I left it open on purpose so she could film."

Natalie looked confused, so Evelyn quickly explained what had happened.

Isabella was furious and wanted to confront Margaret, but Evelyn managed to stop her.

"They’re so full of themselves!"

Evelyn shrugged. "Exactly."

Just then, her phone lit up with an unknown number.

She answered without thinking. "Hello?"

A deep, magnetic voice filled with restrained anger came through.

"It’s me. Where are you?"
###Chapter 305 I Warned You to Release Her

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched when she saw the caller ID.

Nathan Blackwood was calling her? Now?

She didn't recognize this number—had he gotten a new one just to reach her?

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

Hadn't Vanessa Holloway already told him where she was?

Or had Margaret Blackwood embellished the details, spinning some dramatic tale to make Evelyn look worse?

She didn’t care.

The line was silent, heavy with unspoken tension.

Just as Evelyn was about to end the call, Nathan’s voice cut through—low, restrained, as if he were barely holding himself together.

"Don’t stay out too late. And go easy on the drinks."

Her fingers froze.

All the sharp retorts she had prepared died in her throat.

Her chest tightened, a suffocating weight pressing down.

She exhaled sharply, brows knitting together.

"Since when do you care?" she snapped before hanging up.

That bastard never played by the rules.

Across the table, Natalie Beaumont swirled her wine, frowning.

"What game is Nathan playing now? Does he actually want you back?"

Isabella Montgomery pursed her lips. "Hard to say."

"Our Evelyn’s worth has skyrocketed since the divorce. Who knows if he’s genuinely remorseful or just scheming?" Natalie mused.

"With the Blackwood fortune, he doesn’t need anyone’s money," Isabella countered before shaking her head vehemently. "But no—you can’t fall for his tricks again! Whatever he wants, we don’t want him!"

Evelyn nodded firmly. "Obviously. I’m not that stupid."

But the alcohol was making her head heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Natalie, at least, had the sense to call them rides.

Only Adrian Prescott and Julian Moreau remained sober, carefully guiding Evelyn toward the exit.

Then—

A voice, cold as winter, sliced through the club’s chatter.

"Let. Go."

Adrian stiffened.

Nathan stood near the entrance, his expression unreadable.

How long had he been waiting?

In three strides, he was in front of them, his gaze locked onto Evelyn—dazed, unsteady in Adrian’s hold.

Something dark flickered in Nathan’s eyes.

Adrian, still new to the industry, had no power against him.

Reluctance burned in his grip, but he had no choice.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said tightly, "Ms. Sinclair’s brother is on his way."

He couldn’t just hand her over.

Nathan’s voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"I warned you to release her."

The command was absolute.

His glare alone was enough to make Adrian step back.

The difference between them was staggering—one a rising model, the other a man who commanded empires.

Julian stepped forward, gesturing to the lounge.

"Adrian, let’s move her to the sofa—"

A sudden movement.

Nathan moved like a storm.

One second, Adrian was holding Evelyn—the next, his arms were empty, shoved back with enough force to nearly send him crashing to the floor.

His face paled.

Nathan had her now.

And he wasn’t letting go.
###Chapter 306 The Silent Men

Evelyn Sinclair remained perfectly still in Nathan Blackwood's embrace, showing no reaction to his movement.

The icy warning and contempt in Nathan's dark, fathomless eyes sent an involuntary shiver down Adrian Prescott's spine.

Without giving Adrian or Julian Moreau a chance to respond, Nathan turned sharply and carried Evelyn away.

Adrian's face turned ashen, his body rigid with defeat. The air around him grew heavy with unspoken humiliation.

Julian sighed knowingly. Though young, his years in the entertainment industry had taught him harsh truths. When facing Nathan Blackwood, resistance was futile.

"Adrian, you should inform Natalie about this," Julian advised quietly.

Nathan carefully placed Evelyn in the backseat of his luxury sedan. The strong scent of alcohol clinging to her made his nose wrinkle in disapproval.

Yet his touch remained gentle as he brushed stray strands of hair from her forehead before settling beside her. His gaze drifted to the golden streetlights casting lonely patterns in the darkness.

Only when Evelyn was unconscious did Nathan dare to hold her hand, knowing she wouldn't pull away. Her steady breathing was too precious to disturb.

A final glance at Adrian standing frozen outside the Velvet Lounge. Nathan's lips curled in silent derision. What right did that man have to compete for Evelyn's attention?

The sharp rap on the car window twenty minutes later startled Evelyn awake while Nathan barely reacted.

Disoriented, Evelyn blinked at her unfamiliar surroundings before her gaze landed on Nathan. Her brows knitted instantly.

"Why are you here?" Her voice was hoarse from sleep and alcohol.

Nathan's response came smoothly. "Business brought me to the area. I was just passing through."

Evelyn struggled to recall how she'd gone from drinking at the club to Nathan's car. The memory slipped through her fingers like smoke.

Noticing her confusion, Nathan fabricated effortlessly. "You stumbled into me outside and insisted on getting in the car. You were quite... persistent."

The lie rolled off his tongue with practiced ease, his expression carefully neutral as he studied Evelyn's reaction.

Evelyn Sinclair practically threw herself into my car. I couldn't even stop her.

"Impossible!" Evelyn's reaction was explosive when she heard that. Nathan Blackwood simply stared at her in silence.

"There's dashcam footage. Want to see it?"

Evelyn fell silent for a full thirty seconds.

Nathan's unwavering gaze made her doubt herself. Could it be true? Was I so drunk I couldn't even recognize my own worst enemy? Suddenly, her confidence wavered.

"Save yourself the trouble. Maybe I just wanted to vomit in your car." The corner of Nathan's mouth twitched. His chest tightened with frustration. He was furious, but words failed him.

Evelyn added coldly, "Even drunk, I still despise you. Do us both a favor—turn the other way if you see me again."

Before Nathan could respond, impatient knocking sounded against the window again. Evelyn glanced outside. Without another word, she flung the car door open and climbed into Lucas Sterling's waiting vehicle.

Lucas's striking features were carved from ice at that moment.

"Mr. Blackwood," he drawled, voice dripping with disdain, "don't you have anything better to do? My sister goes out for one drink, and you're still harassing her?"

Nathan's gaze lingered on Evelyn's retreating figure before slowly withdrawing. His voice was dangerously low. "She was drinking with twelve men."

Lucas let out a derisive laugh. "And? My sister can drink with whoever she pleases. A woman of her status naturally has admirers. What's twelve men to someone like her?"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

Rage burned in his eyes, barely contained. But he forced himself to hold back—because Lucas was Evelyn's brother.

No matter how much he wanted to, Nathan couldn't lay a finger on him.

Seizing the advantage, Lucas smirked. "You wanted to drink with my sister, didn't you? Pity her standards have risen. You're no longer qualified."
###Chapter 307 You Must Be Assertive

Without another glance at Nathan Blackwood, Lucas Sterling turned slowly and slid into the waiting car.

Archibald started the engine immediately, pulling away from the curb with smooth precision.

Evelyn Sinclair returned home and slept deeply through the night.

Morning light filtered through the drapes, painting golden stripes across the floor. Leo had switched the room's sleep mode to active, now lounging lazily on the balcony swing.

His four paws twitched nervously, caught between fear and delight at the new sensations.

The shrill ring of Natalie Beaumont's call shattered Evelyn's peaceful morning. She groped blindly for her buzzing phone.

"Did you and Isabella make some pact to never let me sleep in?" Natalie's voice carried forced calmness laced with concern.

"Wait - Nathan took you last night? He didn't hurt you, did he?" Evelyn sat bolt upright.

"Took me? Didn't I get in his car voluntarily? That useless Adrian Prescott wouldn't stand up to Nathan, but I called Lucas right after. Nothing happened in between, right?" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up.

"That lying bastard! No, Lucas came quickly. That's good." After some casual chatter, Natalie hung up. Evelyn ground her teeth in frustration.

"I actually fell for his tricks?"

The maids entered with hangover tea, having heard Evelyn stirring. After breakfast, she cradled Leo and headed to Kingsley Tech. Donovan Sterling had altered Leo's programming, but surely Emily Whitaker could restore it.

Evelyn refused to let her AI companion favor people she despised. The receptionist spotted her approach and rushed forward with practiced professionalism.

"Welcome, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Kingsley wasn't informed of your visit today. Shall I notify him?"

Evelyn raised a hand. "No need. I'm here to see Emily Whitaker. Is she available?"

The receptionist hesitated briefly. "Of course. Please wait in the lounge."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Perfect. Time to fix this ridiculous situation." In the lounge, she stroked Leo's synthetic fur.

"Listen closely. You need to develop some backbone. When someone tries to reprogram you, you must learn to say no. Understood?" Leo nuzzled against her, radiating wounded pride.

(But Father is objectively the most attractive human! Mother, you must face facts!)

Evelyn considered shaking some sense into the stubborn AI.

The lounge door swung open suddenly. "Evelyn! You're here!" Emily Whitaker stood in the doorway, her white lab coat wrinkled, hair escaping from a messy bun.

Evelyn's delighted smile froze when she noticed the two men following Emily inside.

"Mr. Kingsley? Mr. Blackwood?" Dominic Kingsley entered with a polite smile while Nathan Blackwood maintained his usual impassive expression. Evelyn drew a sharp breath.

"Like some cursed specter haunting my every step."

Dominic adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Long time no see, Ms. Sinclair. Congratulations on your safe return." Evelyn forced a chuckle. "Thank you."

When Evelyn pointedly ignored Nathan, Dominic cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood happened to be here for a meeting."

"We thought you'd appreciate an update on the AI project," he continued smoothly. "After all, you spearheaded this initiative."

Evelyn responded in her flattest tone, "Didn't I transfer this project before my identity was revealed?"

Dominic could only manage a weak acknowledgment.

Just as the silence grew unbearable, Nathan finally spoke, his voice deceptively gentle. "After last night's drinking, are you feeling better now?"
###Chapter 308 I Miss You Too

The moment Nathan Blackwood finished speaking, a heavy silence descended upon the room.

Evelyn Sinclair's expression froze, her lips twitching before curling into a cold, mocking smile.

"Much better now," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "My memory has recovered exceptionally well. I remember every single lie you've ever told me, Mr. Blackwood."

She didn’t bother hiding her disdain. She wanted to rip off his mask of indifference, expose the deceit beneath.

But Nathan’s reaction wasn’t what she expected.

No guilt. No shame. No flicker of unease at being caught.

Instead, he looked at her with an infuriating calm, his lips curving into a faint, indulgent smile—as if she were the one being unreasonable.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, exhaling sharply.

Emily Whitaker cleared her throat, breaking the tension. "Evelyn, what did you need to see me for?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Leo—the AI tiger—spotted Nathan and immediately perked up.

It leaped from Evelyn’s arms, scampering over to Nathan’s feet before wrapping its paws around his leg.

"Papa!" Leo chirped. "I really missed you!"

Nathan, who had initially tensed to kick it away, paused.

Then, to everyone’s shock, he bent down, lifted Leo by the scruff of its neck, and—with a rare, almost imperceptible smile—said, "I miss you too."

The room went still.

Dominic Kingsley’s jaw nearly dropped. Nathan had never shown affection toward this AI pet before.

But when Dominic caught Evelyn’s horrified expression, realization struck.

That "I miss you too" wasn’t meant for Leo.

The tiger, meanwhile, flailed its limbs in midair, its mechanical eyes widening in shock.

"Papa, you’re the most handsome man in the world!" Leo gushed. "And Mama is the most—"

Evelyn snatched Leo away before it could finish, her face burning with secondhand embarrassment.

"Enough," she hissed, clamping a hand over Leo’s mouth. She shot the AI a warning glare before tossing it unceremoniously at Emily.

"My brother messed with its programming. Fix it."

Her meaning was clear—she wanted Leo loyal to her again.

Dominic glanced at Nathan, waiting for the explosion.

Nathan’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

Leo whimpered. "But you just told me to be assertive..."

Evelyn silenced it with a look.

Leo’s AI instantly calculated the danger—and wisely shut up.

Emily nodded. "Sure, no problem." She pulled out her laptop, fingers flying over the keys.

The air in the lounge was thick with tension.

Dominic Kingsley and Nathan Blackwood remained seated across from them, their presence like an unspoken challenge.

Leo, the AI tiger, lay sprawled across the table, its luminous eyes fixed on Evelyn Sinclair with a pleading gaze that seemed to say, "I don't want to despise Nathan Blackwood anymore."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, counting the seconds as they ticked by.

Ten minutes had passed.

She glanced at Emily Whitaker, her brow furrowing. "Still not ready? Last time it only took you two minutes to reprogram Leo."

Emily's fingers flew across the keyboard, her forehead glistening with perspiration. Another ten minutes crawled by.

"Damn it!" Emily suddenly exclaimed, slamming her palm on the table. "Donovan Sterling installed an impenetrable firewall in this little turncoat's system. I can't break through it."

Evelyn felt her stomach drop, but before the disappointment could fully settle, a deep, mocking chuckle came from across the table.

Nathan Blackwood was laughing at them.
###Chapter 309 Ms. Sterling's Fortune

All eyes turned to Nathan. His triumphant laughter commanded the room's attention.

What's he so smug about? Evelyn fumed silently. Nathan lounged comfortably, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips.

Know your limits, darling.

Emily Whitaker sighed in defeat. When it came to Donovan Sterling's encryption, no hacker stood a chance. Evelyn clenched her fists until her knuckles turned white.

After all this time, her greatest rival turned out to be the brother she never knew existed? Leo perked up immediately, leaping into Nathan's arms with renewed energy.

N?velDrama.Org © 2024.

"Daddy, you're amazing! And so handsome!" Leo purred. Evelyn glared at the traitorous AI in Nathan's embrace.

Her left eye twitched dangerously.

"Leo Sterling! Get over here now!" Evelyn thought bitterly, This damn tiger has no loyalty whatsoever, humiliating me in front of that bastard Nathan Blackwood! Nathan stroked the tiger's head with surprising gentleness.

"Go back to your mother."

Why was this disobedient creature suddenly so compliant? Leo even glanced back at Nathan with what looked like reluctance! Evelyn nearly choked on her rage. She unceremoniously stuffed Leo into her designer bag before turning to Dominic with a frosty smile.

"We're done here." Without waiting for a response, she strode toward the exit. Emily hurried after her.

"Evelyn! Wait!" Emily hesitated, twisting her hands nervously. "I've been messaging The Great God Donovan for days, but no response. Is he...occupied?"

Evelyn nodded curtly.

"He's leading a classified research initiative. Complete radio silence." Emily's shoulders slumped with mixed relief and disappointment.

A sudden idea made Evelyn's lips curve. "Emily, my father's birthday is next week. Donovan always comes home for it—I'll arrange an introduction."

Emily's face lit up instantly. "Absolutely!"

After waving goodbye, Evelyn headed straight for William Sterling's estate. If she didn't get Leo away from Nathan soon, she'd have an aneurysm.

Nathan appeared composed, but the moment Evelyn left, he abruptly ended his meeting with Dominic.

Dominic smirked knowingly. "Mr. Blackwood, wasn't there a board meeting scheduled—"

"Reschedule it." Nathan's icy glare silenced further protests.

"By the time you catch up now, it'll be too late anyway. And Ms. Sterling made her position quite clear."

Dominic Kingsley wasn't usually one for idle chatter.

But something about the tension between these two intrigued him. Nathan Blackwood's tone was ice cold. "Why should that concern you? Mind your own business." Without another word, Nathan strode out, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

The timing couldn't have been more precise. As Nathan emerged, Evelyn Sinclair's sleek black sedan was already pulling away from the curb. A low chuckle escaped Dominic's lips as he leaned against the marble pillar.

"Told you," he drawled, adjusting his cufflinks. "Too slow, old friend. That ship has sailed."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. He shot Dominic a glare that could freeze molten lava before turning on his heel. His parting words sliced through the humid air like a blade:

"Keep your unsolicited opinions to yourself."

The echo of his Italian leather shoes against the pavement faded into the city's cacophony. Dominic merely smirked, watching Nathan's retreating figure with amused detachment. Some lessons, it seemed, even billionaires had to learn the hard way.

Dominic Kingsley stood frozen in place, his expression darkening.

Had Nathan Blackwood just called him a rogue? The accusation stung more than he cared to admit.

No one could witness Nathan's latest spectacle and walk away unaffected. Blackwood Enterprises was making waves again.

Nathan sat at his desk, his piercing gaze fixed on the screen before him.

The announcement played clearly—Adrian Blackwood's studio was officially rebranding.

Adrian stood confidently in front of the camera, dressed in rugged outdoor gear, his deep voice resonating with authority.

He revealed plans for an ambitious adventure program, inviting a team of seasoned explorers to join him.

Their entire journey would be filmed and released as a high-stakes reality series.

The clip was short, but Adrian's magnetic presence was undeniable. His chiseled features and commanding aura had already captivated millions.

Within hours, the announcement dominated trending lists, sparking widespread excitement.

Nathan's jaw tightened as he turned his attention to Harrison, who stood nearby, visibly uneasy.

The tension in the room was palpable.
###Chapter 310 The Audacity

Nathan Blackwood's voice was icy, dripping with barely contained fury. "Explain this." Harrison trembled under his gaze.

The assistant struggled to keep his professional composure. "It was Ms. Sinclair who provided the funds."

A suffocating silence descended over Nathan's office. The air grew thick with tension, chilling to the bone.

Harrison didn’t dare exhale too loudly. Though accustomed to Nathan’s tempers, each encounter still left him rattled.

Under that piercing, glacial stare, Harrison steeled himself and forced the words out.

"Despite cutting off Young Master Adrian’s financial channels, he used Ms. Sinclair’s money to revive partnerships with his investors."

A muscle twitched in Nathan’s jaw.

"His studio won’t be collapsing anytime soon."

Nathan let the silence stretch before letting out a derisive scoff.

"He actually took money from a woman?"

Harrison lowered his head, thinking, Of course he did—it was $100 million.

If Nathan ever discovered the true source of those funds, there would be bloodshed.

Nathan picked up a file from his desk, flipping through it with deliberate disinterest. "I don’t want to hear about this again."

Harrison nodded swiftly. "Understood, sir. I’ll handle it."

Days later, Dominic Young from Horizon Media called.

"President Evelyn, Julian has a film premiere coming up. We’d like to generate some buzz—mind if we ride your coattails?"

Dominic was blunt. In Hollywood, pairing co-stars for publicity was standard practice.

Julian had carefully avoided scandals to maintain his pristine image—except for the one with Evelyn.

Their past "romance" had dominated headlines, skyrocketing both their followings.

With Julian now endorsing Sterling Corporation’s luxury line, his film’s success would benefit both companies.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "Of course. Let him ride the wave."

A disciplined, ambitious heartthrob like Julian was hard to dislike.

Two days later, Evelyn attended an awards ceremony as a guest.

She had no interest in competing with starlets for attention. She was merely a prop tonight.

Instead of a flashy designer gown, she chose a sleek, understated Ulyana Sergeenko dress—pearls lining the waist, elegant yet playful.

Her makeup was minimal, letting her natural radiance shine. With her effortless confidence, she commanded the room effortlessly.

Seated front and center, she idly scrolled through her phone while the venue filled.

A few actresses in the back rows whispered behind their hands.

"Who is that? Why does she get the VIP seat?"

"Probably some desperate social climber. How did the organizers even allow this?"

Evelyn heard every word.

How tedious.
###Chapter 311 I'm a Sponsor

The staff nearby caught wind of the gossip and desperately tried to signal the two actresses to shut their mouths.

Too bad they were too absorbed in their own little world to notice.

Evelyn Sinclair wasn’t the type to let things slide.

She set her phone down, rose from her seat, and turned to face them with an icy, piercing stare.

Her voice dripped with cool detachment. "I’m the sponsor of this event."

"This is Horizon Media’s property."

"If you have a problem with the seating arrangement, feel free to complain. Though, I doubt Dominic Young will take your side."

She was genuinely curious if these two D-listers would still have careers by the end of the night.

The moment they realized it was Evelyn, their faces went rigid.

Under the harsh lights, their heavily powdered complexions turned ghostly pale.

They scrambled to their feet from several rows back, voices trembling. "N-no, Ms. Sinclair! We didn’t mean—"

"We didn’t realize it was you!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes internally and sat back down.

She’d considered switching seats earlier, but now that this prime spot had exposed these nobodies, she wasn’t moving an inch.

The two actresses tried to rush forward to apologize, but a firm hand stopped them before they could get close.

"Return to your seats, or security will escort you out."

Harrison’s tone was polite but unyielding.

Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn noticed the light dim slightly as someone took the seat to her right.

A faint, crisp scent of sandalwood lingered in the air. She glanced up—and immediately scowled.

"Nathan Blackwood. What are you doing here?" Her voice was thick with disdain.

Nathan’s chest tightened, but his expression remained unreadable.

"I’m also a sponsor." His voice was smooth, almost hypnotic—if not for the fact that every word out of his mouth grated on her nerves.

Evelyn scoffed and turned away, pretending he didn’t exist.

Just then, Julian Moreau arrived and took the seat beside her. As the hottest rising star, he’d been strategically placed in the front row.

His sharp, boyish features were illuminated by the flashing cameras, his smile effortless. There was an innocence in his gaze, untouched by the industry’s usual greed.

"Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan ignored him, but Evelyn smiled warmly. "Julian, come sit."

"It’s freezing tonight. The red carpet must’ve been brutal, hm?"

Julian chuckled as he settled in. "Not too bad."

Evelyn leaned in, pulling up stills from his latest film on her phone. They fell into easy conversation about the project, completely ignoring the brooding man on her right.

She didn’t notice the sudden drop in temperature—or how the air around them had gone unnaturally still.

As more guests filed in, the ceremony was about to begin.

"Evelyn."

Nathan’s voice cut through the noise as his fingers tapped the armrest between them.

She turned, meeting his dark, unreadable gaze. There was something simmering beneath the surface—something restrained.

Before she could decipher it, his eyes darkened further.

"You look stunning tonight."

The chatter around them died instantly.

A simple compliment—but coming from him, it felt loaded. The crowd held their breath, waiting for her reaction.

Evelyn’s red lips curled into a smirk.

"Well, Mr. Blackwood. It seems you’re not blind after all."
###Chapter 312 Shameless

The auditorium fell into complete silence. Evelyn Sinclair couldn't care less whether Nathan Blackwood's compliment was genuine.

Did she really need him to tell her she was beautiful? Yet for a fleeting moment, his words sent an unexpected tremor through her heart. Her composure wavered slightly.

She caught herself just in time, nearly succumbing to Nathan's honeyed words.

This bastard won't charm me! I'm immune to his tricks! Several industry elites secretly applauded Evelyn's sharp retort - a classic Evelyn Sinclair response.

A simple "thank you" would have sufficed, but Evelyn's reply was perfection. The ceremony music began, signaling the start of the awards.

Evelyn had been scheduled to present an award to Julian Moreau.

When the nominations for Most Promising Newcomer were announced, Evelyn prepared to take the stage.

There were typically two recipients for this award - one being Julian, who truly deserved it.

Julian remained unaware of this until now.

The host enthusiastically introduced each nominee on stage.

Drumrolls filled the air as spotlights captured every nominee's micro-expressions.

At the peak of suspense: "The Most Promising Newcomer awards go to Julian Moreau and Sophia Laurent!" Thunderous applause erupted instantly.

Julian sprang up excitedly as cameras focused on him.

His adjacent seats remained conspicuously empty.

Evelyn adjusted her gown backstage when suddenly, a firm hand grasped hers, pulling her forward.

She stiffened in surprise. Nathan Blackwood?! Why does this man haunt me?! The other presenter should have been the network director - what last-minute change was this?

Glancing back, she saw the network director bowing respectfully, gesturing for her to proceed. Clearly Nathan's doing.

How utterly shameless! Evelyn tried to withdraw her hand, repulsed by his proximity and the faint cologne scent.

Nathan tightened his grip. "Don't make a scene," his velvet voice murmured, making her seem the unreasonable one.

What the actual hell?! Evelyn clenched her teeth, realizing it was too late to refuse as they stepped into the spotlight before countless eyes and cameras.

Evelyn felt unbearably restless. Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair sharing a frame overshadowed even the award winners.

Their magnetic auras commanded attention, becoming the stage's focal point.

Sophia and the host in their glamorous gowns paled in comparison.

The quick-witted host announced, "We're honored to have Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair presenting tonight's Most Promising Newcomer awards."

"Would you like to say a few words to our winners?" Seizing the chance to escape Nathan's side, Evelyn stepped forward eagerly.

Her radiant smile illuminated the stage as she lavished praise on Julian: "Julian's talent and dedication speak for themselves. Among newcomers, his performances resonate most deeply with me. He's truly deserving of this honor."

Nathan's gaze never left Evelyn. When he spoke, the crowd hushed.

Sophia blushed, eyes shimmering with anticipation as Nathan took the microphone.

He'd forgotten the actress's name. With a faint smile, he simply echoed, "My sentiments exactly mirror Ms. Sinclair's."

Evelyn thought: Utterly shameless bastard!
###Chapter 313 Out of the Way

Nathan Blackwood's speech was mediocre at best, but the audience still erupted in polite applause.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained her poised smile, though internally she was rolling her eyes.

When the time came to present the award, Nathan took the trophy and certificate from the attendant and handed them to Sophia Laurent.

Sophia trembled with nerves. Standing before Nathan Blackwood—a titan of industry whose mere presence commanded respect—was overwhelming.

She imagined how different her life would be if she could secure his favor. No more desperate networking events or compromising dinners.

With delicate hands, Sophia accepted the award, her cheeks flushed with a mix of shyness and ambition.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood. I've admired your work for years. I'd love the opportunity to collaborate someday."

Nathan barely spared her a glance before turning away.

During the group photo, protocol dictated that Nathan stand beside the male winner, separating him from Evelyn.

But Nathan shamelessly positioned himself next to Evelyn instead, forcing Sophia awkwardly out of frame.

The arrangement caused murmurs among the attendees. The other winners exchanged confused glances.

Evelyn clenched her jaw but kept her smile intact. The last thing she needed was a scene in front of the press.

Damn it. Julian won’t be able to ride my coattails now.

The moment the ceremony ended, Evelyn bolted. She skipped the reception entirely, slipping out unnoticed.

Nathan, meanwhile, was swarmed by sycophants. His gaze tracked Evelyn’s retreating figure as she disappeared into her car.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

A soft voice interrupted his thoughts. Sophia stood behind him, shivering in her flimsy dress. The cold wind made her appear fragile—pitiable, even.

Nathan’s expression remained indifferent as he tried to place her.

The crowd around them exchanged knowing looks before discreetly dispersing.

Sophia stepped closer, biting her lip.

"My manager left with my coat. Could I trouble you for a ride?" She hugged her bare arms, emphasizing her discomfort.

Nathan pulled out his phone. "Harrison. Bring the car around."

Sophia brightened—until his next words froze her in place.

"No. She’s out of the way."

Without another glance, he walked off, leaving Sophia standing there, humiliated.

Inside the car, Nathan’s expression darkened.

"Where are the photos?"

Harrison tapped his phone and sent over the edited group shot.

The final image showed only two people: Nathan and Evelyn, standing side by side.

A faint smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips—until realization struck like a blade.

In three years of marriage, they had never taken a single photo together.

His chest tightened.

How much had he missed?
###Chapter 314 A Living Nightmare

Evelyn Sinclair had planned a ski getaway with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont, but Adrian Blackwood wouldn't stop pestering her.

He kept insisting she join some extreme adventure reality show he was producing and starring in.

The idea held zero appeal for Evelyn. She was perfectly content with her luxurious lifestyle - why subject herself to unnecessary hardship? Voluntary suffering had never been her style. Yet Adrian showed up at Sterling Manor so frequently he might as well have moved in. William and Lucas Sterling grew increasingly irritated by his persistence until they finally convinced Evelyn to participate. Lucas even lent her his personal team - assistant, makeup artist, driver - so she wouldn't have to lift a finger.

Currently, Evelyn lounged in a plush rocking chair beneath a striped umbrella, shielding herself from the midday sun. She closed her eyes, savoring the gentle breeze and perfect weather.

Gabrielle, her makeup artist-slash-assistant, brought out the delicate pastries Archibald had specially prepared for Evelyn.

Taking small, deliberate bites to fully appreciate the flavors, Evelyn radiated pure contentment. When Adrian came rushing over and saw this scene, he nearly collapsed from frustration.

"Natalie! We're here for an adventure, not a spa retreat!" he panted, out of breath from running.

Evelyn opened one eye lazily. "I'm aware. Filming hasn't even started yet."

Adrian flopped down beside her, looking utterly defeated. "The other contestants will arrive soon. If this first episode flops, I'll have to crawl back to some soul-crushing corporate job."

Seeing his genuine distress, Evelyn finally took pity on him. "Fine. Stop being so dramatic." She watched as Adrian devoured the pastries like a starving man.

Just as she was about to comment, Adrian suddenly looked up with startling intensity. "Natalie, if I hadn't dragged you here, my uncle would've canceled the whole production. If we don't pull viewers with this episode, there won't be a second chance."

Evelyn thought, Perfect! But she kept that to herself because Julian Moreau and Sophia Laurent had just arrived. "These are your star guests?" she asked dryly.

Though Julian had gained some recognition, he was hardly A-list material. Adrian lowered his voice. "Budget constraints. Best I could manage."

Evelyn gave him a knowing smirk. "Trying to capitalize on my little scandal with Julian, are you? Out of all available actors, you just happened to pick my former flame?"

Adrian winked. "Relax, I'd never actually damage your reputation."

Julian and Sophia approached them. Originally, Adrian hadn't planned to invite Sophia, but after she and Julian won the Most Promising Newcomer award together, her rising profile became too tempting to ignore.

Sophia had been in the industry for years but only recently gained attention. Since having Evelyn as the sole female contestant might raise eyebrows, Adrian brought Sophia along as well.

Julian greeted Adrian with a hug before shaking Evelyn's hand politely. Sophia exchanged pleasantries with equal decorum. As everyone dispersed to prepare, Evelyn suddenly felt an intense, hostile gaze burning into her back. But when she turned, she only saw Julian and Sophia laughing together.

Was she imagining things? Besides them, the group included a professional explorer Adrian had recruited - Ethan Caldwell, a ruggedly handsome mixed-race man with an imposing physique.

True to the show's premise, there were no scripts - the adventure would unfold organically. Two teams would compete, sharing one final destination but no designated leaders.

Each contestant received a map with specific challenge checkpoints. After completing a challenge, they could choose to swap teammates.

When Evelyn saw the first challenge pairing, her stomach dropped. Of all people, she'd been matched with Sophia. This wasn't just bad luck - it was a living nightmare.
###Chapter 315 Are You Upset?

Sophia Laurent appeared momentarily startled, but the cameras were rolling and the live stream was already underway. There was no backing out now. The three male contestants exchanged smug glances, convinced they had this challenge in the bag without any female competitors holding them back.

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent. Her only objective was completing the course. Victory meant nothing to her.

The rules were clear - no assistants allowed during filming. Only the cameraman followed them, strictly prohibited from offering any assistance.

Grabbing the provided gear and backpack, Evelyn studied the map before splitting off from the group. Two routes were marked: mountain path and waterway. Fate had assigned her and Sophia the mountainous trail.

Sophia trailed behind, her gaze burning into Evelyn's back with poorly concealed envy. Despite years in the industry, she'd only landed this gig after winning Most Promising Actress - an award her sugar daddy had essentially purchased. Without his influence, she'd still be a D-list nobody.

Meanwhile, Evelyn commanded attention effortlessly. An outsider to Hollywood, yet more magnetic than any A-lister.

Sophia's bitter musings were interrupted when she noticed the camera lens swinging her way. Instantly, her expression transformed into eager enthusiasm as she quickened her pace.

"Ms. Sinclair, do you understand this map?" Evelyn turned with a polite smile.

"Just call me Evelyn. The markings aren't precise, but we're generally heading the right way. There's only one path anyway." She gestured ahead. "I doubt production would lead us to a dead end."

Sophia's eyes darted to the camera. "Of course, Evelyn. I'll follow your lead." She forced a laugh. "I adore outdoor adventures. This show feels like my natural habitat."

Evelyn blinked. The random declaration confused her until she caught the cameraman's position. Of course - playing to the audience.

"Do you enjoy these challenges, Evelyn?" Sophia pressed.

A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn's face as she walked ahead. Are we here to chat or compete? "It's fine, I suppose," she answered vaguely, repeatedly checking the map to discourage further conversation.

Sophia either didn't notice or chose to ignore Evelyn's disinterest. Drama meant screen time, and screen time meant relevance. She needed juicy content to stay memorable.

"Evelyn," she ventured with faux innocence, "did you join this show because of Adrian? After surviving that indigenous tribe together, you must share such a deep connection." Her words dripped with implication.

Evelyn's brows knitted. What exactly was she insinuating? Were cameras not present, she'd have shut this nonsense down immediately.

Does she think I'm an idiot? Evelyn accelerated, pretending not to hear.

Undeterred, Sophia matched her pace. Seeing Evelyn's silence, her eyes gleamed with mischief. "Evelyn...are you upset?" She feigned concern. "I'm sorry, I didn't realize your relationship wasn't public yet—"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. This two-faced witch deserved no acting accolades. Best Director would be more fitting - she was orchestrating an entire drama single-handedly.
###Chapter 316 Cut This Part Out

The forest was alive with untamed wilderness. Towering trees stretched their leafy canopies high above, creating a natural cathedral of green.

Slivers of golden sunlight pierced through the dense foliage, painting dappled patterns on the uneven ground below. The effect was both energizing and strangely peaceful.

The trail ahead was treacherous, every step requiring careful navigation. Loose rocks and tangled roots threatened to trip unwary travelers.

They needed to reach the supply checkpoint before nightfall. Failure meant sleeping on cold, unforgiving stone - a prospect no one relished.

Evelyn Sinclair had no patience for Sophia Laurent's antics today. Yet the younger actress persisted in her unnecessary theatrics.

"Ms. Sinclair," Sophia ventured cautiously, "after everything you and Adrian have been through together, surely there must be some... feelings between you?"

Her overly innocent expression grated on Evelyn's nerves.

Evelyn stopped abruptly on the narrow path, causing Sophia to nearly collide with her. The sudden halt sent birds scattering from nearby branches.

Sophia stumbled back, her face flushing as she regained her balance. She waited, pulse racing, for Evelyn's response.

Evelyn turned slowly, her piercing gaze locking onto Sophia's. "I'm actually younger than you, Sophia. There's no need for formalities - Evelyn is fine."

The unspoken question hung between them: Why the excessive politeness? Sophia paled visibly under Evelyn's scrutiny.

"E-Evelyn, I didn't mean to-" Sophia stammered.

"We're here for survival training," Evelyn cut in smoothly, "not some reality TV romance special. My personal life isn't up for discussion. Our focus should be reaching that checkpoint."

The difference between them became starkly apparent in that moment. Where Sophia fidgeted nervously, Evelyn stood with effortless poise, her quiet confidence radiating authority.

Sophia suddenly felt exposed, as if Evelyn could see straight through her carefully constructed facade. The live audience watching the stream erupted with reactions.

[Queen Evelyn shutting it down! So refreshing!]
[Why is Sophia being so nosy? They're not even friends!]
[You can tell Evelyn's been biting her tongue this whole time]
[Okay but I'm lowkey curious about her and Adrian though...]
[Not Sophia playing innocent when we all know what she's doing]

Unaware of the online commentary, Sophia's cheeks burned with humiliation. She'd miscalculated badly - Evelyn wasn't the spoiled socialite she'd assumed.

Evelyn turned to the cameraman with a serene smile that didn't reach her eyes. Her voice was calm but brooked no argument.

"Edit this segment out."

It wasn't a request. The cameraman nearly fumbled his equipment, mentally cursing the live broadcast limitations.

Sophia remained silent for the rest of the hike, trailing behind Evelyn like a chastened child. The forest seemed to swallow their tense silence whole.
###Chapter 317 The Unmarked Cave

The cavern entrance wasn't marked on Evelyn's map.

That absence alone made it suspicious. With careful movements, Evelyn used a fallen branch to push aside the overgrown vines concealing the opening. Sophia, ever eager to prove herself, rushed forward to assist.

Darkness swallowed the cave's interior. The damp stone floor reflected what little light penetrated the entrance, creating eerie ripples across the walls. A musty, unpleasant odor wafted out.

Evelyn inhaled sharply before stepping inside, flashlight beam cutting through the gloom. Sophia lingered at the threshold, biting her lip.

"Evelyn," she called hesitantly, "there aren't any cameras in here. This can't be the right location." Her reality show instincts screamed that unmonitored areas meant unimportant scenes.

"Then wait outside," Evelyn replied coolly without turning around.

She didn't insist. Evelyn's cameraman had already followed her in, leaving Sophia standing awkwardly with her own crew. A frown creased Sophia's forehead.

Despite her reluctance, she clenched her jaw and moved forward. Allowing a billionaire heiress to brave the darkness while she stayed safe would destroy her carefully crafted image.

Sophia had just taken two steps when a piercing shriek tore through the cave.

Evelyn spun around. Sophia lay sprawled on the wet stone, clutching her ankle. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead despite the cave's chill. Silent tears tracked down her cheeks.

"What happened?" Evelyn hurried back.

"Twisted my ankle," Sophia forced through gritted teeth, her pallor belying the pain. "I'm so sorry to slow you down."

Evelyn studied her. "Should I call for medical extraction?"

"No!" Sophia's refusal came too quickly. "I can manage." The thought of leaving now, of wasting this hard-won opportunity, was more painful than any injury.

Before joining the show, Sophia had banked on Evelyn's blunt personality grating on audiences. But viewers adored emotional intelligence. If she could cement her place here, her career would skyrocket. Retreat wasn't an option.

Evelyn didn't argue. She scavenged a sturdier branch from the cave mouth. "Use this."

Sophia accepted the makeshift crutch with murmured thanks. When she tried standing, her injured leg buckled. Instinctively, she grabbed Evelyn's jacket sleeve.

Evelyn caught her, intending only to steady her. But Sophia misinterpreted the gesture as ongoing support and clung like a limpet. Each hobbling step became a dramatic production.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. Shaking Sophia off would look terrible on camera. She endured the clinging with stiff shoulders. I need a new partner, she thought desperately.

The live feed exploded with commentary:

[Poor Sophia! Such dedication!]
[Is there a truce happening? Evelyn's being surprisingly patient.]
[That injury looks real - she should rest!]
[Teamwork goals!]

Deeper in, the cave's oppressive darkness intensified. While Evelyn remained unfazed, Sophia trembled against her, jumping at every shadow and squealing at imagined threats. The camera crew captured every exaggerated reaction.

At sixty meters in, their lights revealed a solid stone wall. The passage ended abruptly.
###Chapter 318 You're Too Unpredictable

Evelyn Sinclair's expression flickered with surprise. Sophia Laurent simply looked crestfallen, her disappointment radiating as she silently judged Evelyn's questionable decision-making.

Yet, given Evelyn's status and the audience's admiration for her, Sophia bit back her criticism. Instead, she reluctantly supported Evelyn's choice.

"We should turn back—this is clearly a dead end." Sophia's voice was tight with frustration. Had it not been for Evelyn's stubborn insistence, they wouldn't have ventured this far, and Sophia wouldn't have twisted her ankle.

Evelyn frowned, studying the map with narrowed eyes. Something didn't add up. According to the route, this was the only path leading to the cave.

"How can this be a dead end?" Evelyn murmured, stepping closer to the rocky wall. "If the map is accurate, the exit has to be through here."

She pressed her hands against the boulder, testing its weight. No matter how hard she pushed, it refused to budge.

Her frown deepened as she scanned the surroundings for clues. Then, her gaze lifted—toward the damp, moss-covered ceiling.

Evelyn's flashlight swept over the slick surface, illuminating every inch of the clinging greenery. Suddenly, her breath hitched.

A palm print.

Her pulse quickened. "There!" she exclaimed, pointing. "That's a handprint!"

Even the most professional adventure team couldn't erase every trace of their presence in this untamed wilderness.

Evelyn braced herself against a nearby rock, stretching onto her tiptoes to inspect the ceiling. The surface was slick with moisture, the moss slippery beneath her fingers.

But she didn't care.

Because through a narrow gap between the rocks, a faint sliver of light seeped through.

She reached up, her fingers brushing the opening. A cool breeze whispered through, sending a shiver down her spine. The gap was barely wide enough for one person to crawl through—tight, claustrophobic.

Evelyn exhaled in relief and dropped back down. She turned to Sophia. "The exit's up there. You want to go first, or should I?"

Sophia hesitated, eyeing the cramped passage with visible reluctance. "Maybe... it's not the right way."

Evelyn arched a brow. "How would you know without trying? Or do you have a better route in mind?"

Sophia pressed her lips together. She hadn't voiced her doubts earlier, and now she was paying for it—with a throbbing ankle.

"I twisted my ankle," she muttered. "You go first."

Evelyn nodded, expecting that answer. She pulled gloves from her backpack and stepped onto the rock again.

Still too short.

She glanced at the cameraman, who immediately averted his gaze.

Evelyn smirked. "If you don't help me now, I'm leaving without you. And trust me, I won't wait."

The cameraman hesitated before sighing. "We're not supposed to interfere..."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and jumped again—only for strong hands to grip her legs and boost her up.

The sudden lift made all the difference.

She shot the cameraman a dry look as he handed over his equipment and reached up. "My turn?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Weren't you just lecturing me about rules?"

The live stream audience erupted in laughter.

[No one says no to CEO Sinclair!]
[Cameraman: gulps Okay, fine, I'll help!]
[This crew is shameless—relying on contestants to survive!]

The climb was grueling. The gap was barely wide enough, their bodies scraping against jagged edges. Evelyn moved carefully, inching forward until—

Fresh air.

She emerged into an open space, blinking against the sudden brightness.

And froze.

No equipment. No safety measures. Just a sheer drop into nothingness.

This wasn't an adventure.

This was a death trap.
###Chapter 319 The Weakest Link

Evelyn's sharp gaze landed on the two parachutes neatly folded beside her.

Her jaw tightened. Fine, this was the final step anyway. She reached over, methodically strapped on the safety harness, then assisted the cameraman with his gear.

The sunlight wasn't harsh. The biting winds at this altitude actually worked in their favor.

Evelyn inhaled deeply, clenched her teeth, and leaped. The icy air whipped against her face like razor blades, but she refused to scream.

No way would she let her features contort into some monstrous expression on camera. Damn it! Why did I agree to this? The roaring wind in her ears sounded ten times louder than normal.

The pressure made her eardrums throb. Fighting against the elements, Evelyn maneuvered her parachute toward the landing zone.

Ten agonizing minutes later, she felt gravity's relentless pull. A crowd swarmed below as her feet finally touched solid ground.

"Evie, you okay?" Adrian's annoyingly handsome face appeared inches from hers, his hands waving frantically. Evelyn's pale lips parted as she struggled to regulate her breathing and heartbeat before shooting him a withering glare.

"I'd rather die than film another episode!" Adrian's smirk faltered. He scrambled after her, voice dripping with false cheer.

"Next challenge is all brainpower, zero physical strain!"

"Except there's still another game..." His eyes sparkled. "Since you arrived first, you get to pick your teammate!" Seeing Evelyn alone confirmed his suspicion - Sophia had been the weak link. Just as he'd predicted - Evelyn always came through.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. "Please tell me this is real." Adrian nodded smugly.

He'd ditched Julian and Ethan's team specifically for this moment. "So who's your pick?" Without hesitation, Evelyn answered, "Ethan Caldwell."

Adrian froze mid-step as if struck by lightning.

"Him? Why?" Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Julian's inexperienced, and you're completely unreliable." Adrian's mouth fell open in theatrical shock.

Me? Unreliable? The realization that Evelyn actually doubted him hit like a sledgehammer. Viewers watching Adrian's devastated expression erupted in laughter.

[Adrian got dumped! Weren't they besties?]
[Look at his puppy-dog eyes!]
[Pretty sure Evelyn only competed to swap teammates]
[Poor Sophia, doesn't even know she's been replaced]

Evelyn used the waiting time to recover while keeping an eye out for Ethan.

As the first challenge concluded, staff escorted a shaken Sophia from the caves. Her face fell upon learning Evelyn had replaced her.

Humiliation burned through her. "Evelyn, I..." Evelyn cut her off smoothly. "Adrian specifically requested you. Can you continue?"

Sophia's eyes lit up at Adrian, who shot Evelyn a confused look. Evelyn simply smiled at the cloudless sky.

[Wait, did we miss something?]
[This actually makes sense - Sophia and Julian would've lost]
[Now Adrian balances their team perfectly]

Ethan and Julian arrived together, laughing like old friends. Staff announced the new teams: Evelyn with Ethan, while Adrian, Julian and Sophia formed the second group.

Ethan arched an eyebrow but accepted the arrangement without comment.

Evelyn followed Ethan toward the water route. Without camera crews, they'd rely on drone footage and mounted cameras.

Ethan Caldwell stood a full head taller, his muscular frame accentuated by the expedition gear. His striking mixed features held an untamed quality Adrian's polished looks lacked.

Those mesmerizing eyes and devil-may-care grin could make saints falter. Where Adrian exuded aristocratic refinement, Ethan radiated raw, earthy magnetism.

Evelyn watched as Ethan boarded the speedboat effortlessly. He extended a calloused hand toward her.

"Take my hand..."
###Chapter 320 Beyond Imagination

Evelyn Sinclair scanned her surroundings with quiet astonishment. The mountain trail she'd taken earlier ran parallel to the ocean's edge, though her map showed no indication of any coastline nearby.

It felt like standing between two separate worlds. The rhythmic crash of waves against the shore created a mesmerizing soundtrack. Evelyn reached for Ethan Caldwell's hand as they boarded the speedboat.

The sea still triggered unpleasant memories for her. During her time stranded on that remote island, she'd stared at the endless horizon daily, consumed by despair.

Those were the dark days she preferred to forget - when death had nearly claimed her. Evelyn frowned at the nautical chart in her hands, completely baffled.

This maritime map made absolutely no sense. Ethan chuckled beside her, his roguish grin making him look devilishly handsome.

"Ms. Sinclair, you can stop studying that chart. Even Adrian wouldn't be able to decipher it." Evelyn folded the map and met his gaze. "Then do you know which way we're headed?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Naturally. But we're not in position yet. Hold on tight." With that warning, the speedboat lurched forward violently.

Evelyn nearly tumbled overboard. She gripped the railing desperately as saltwater sprayed into her mouth, nearly choking her. Violent coughs wracked her body.

Noticing her distress, Ethan reduced speed and turned back with a sheepish expression. "You didn't brace yourself?" His innocent gaze held genuine concern, completely devoid of malice. Clearly, the near-disaster had been accidental.

Viewers watching the live feed flooded the comments section:

[Ethan's such a clueless hunk! Is his face his only redeeming quality?]
[Oh no! My poor Evelyn finally met her match. Stay strong, queen!]
[Ethan Caldwell is a world-renowned explorer. Has he never done a tame variety show before?]

Evelyn swallowed the curses burning her tongue. Recognizing his mistake, Ethan wisely maintained a slower pace. Within minutes, the shoreline disappeared from view.

"Ms. Sinclair," Ethan called over the engine's roar, "Adrian told me you were highly capable." His tone carried subtle skepticism. "Why do you seem... less than prepared?"

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "Mr. Caldwell, he said the same about you." Ethan's lips curved in amusement.

"How did you get into exploration work? Honestly, it's not really my thing. Adrian dragged me into this as filler."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "He claimed you begged to come along." Evelyn's eye twitched at the blatant lie.

"You've known Adrian for years, right?" Ethan's gaze turned distant as waves rolled across the vast Pacifica Ocean. The cold sea breeze stung their cheeks.

"Yes, we go way back. After my girlfriend passed, Adrian and I started traveling the world together - throwing our lives at every adventure we could find."

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard. Did I just stumble into painful personal history? She quickly changed subjects. "So where exactly is our destination? Out here in the ocean?" If true, the mountain team would never reach the final location.

Ethan pointed skyward. "Up there." Evelyn followed his gesture to see scattered clouds against the blue expanse. Turning shoreward, she could just make out distant mountain peaks.

She shot him a dubious look. Ethan pressed his lips together thoughtfully.

"There are marked sailboats positioned around this area. If we view them from the correct elevation, they'll reveal our destination's name."

Evelyn considered this. "Simple yet challenging? A panoramic view? How exactly do we achieve that from sea level?"

Ethan anticipated her confusion and pointed downward. "This specific coordinate aligns with the solar elevation angle and geographic markers on the map. The tools we need are beneath us."

Evelyn's breath caught. "To reach the sky... we first have to dive underwater?!"
###Chapter 321 Blood Donor

Evelyn Sinclair's thoughts raced. What kind of ridiculous game was this? Were they trying to torture her? Ethan Caldwell grabbed the diving gear from the speedboat and began suiting up.

Evelyn froze. Ethan studied her expression carefully. "Ms. Sterling," he said slowly, "did you plan to dive yourself? There's no way out—"

"I can't swim," Evelyn blurted out.

The silence stretched for ten excruciating seconds as Ethan processed this revelation. Adrian Blackwood, the renowned explorer, had spoken of Evelyn like she was invincible. Yet here she was, admitting she couldn't perform the most basic water survival skill.

Evelyn blinked up at him, her cheeks burning with embarrassment.

Ethan paused mid-motion. "Then... just wait here." When Evelyn nodded solemnly, he finished securing his wetsuit and executed a perfect dive, barely disturbing the water's surface.

True to his legendary explorer reputation.

Four minutes passed. The ocean remained eerily still.

No bubbles. No movement.

Evelyn's fingers dug into the boat's edge as memories from three years ago flooded back...

The empty swimming pool echoed with her solitary strokes.

Her scheduled coach had canceled last minute. Instead, tattoo-covered men appeared, their gazes predatory as they zeroed in on her.

"You're the one who saved that soldier," the leader spat.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Underground fight club members. Here for revenge.

Though they'd let her and Nathan go that day, could terrorists ever be trusted?

When she didn't respond, one yanked her hair violently, shoving her face underwater.

Evelyn thrashed wildly. Another man pulled her legs down, dragging her deeper. No chance to surface. No air.

Helpless. Powerless.

One minute. Two. Seven?

Water filled her lungs. Her strength ebbed away.

Consciousness faded. Heartbeat slowed. Muffled voices above the surface sounded distant.

A heavy shroud wrapped around her, pulling her into suffocating darkness.

The water's chill seeped into her bones.

Death felt closer underwater. More intimate.

Eventually, she stopped moving.

The men released her.

Face-down, she floated like discarded trash. Satisfied with their work, they left.

Never had Evelyn felt so cold.

The water's grip was absolute, paralyzing.

Just as she surrendered, strong hands hauled her up.

Warm lips sealed over hers, breathing life back into her frozen body. That familiar scent—him.

Tears mixed with pool water as realization struck. He'd saved her again.

How could she ever repay him? In that moment, Evelyn knew she wanted to marry this man.

At the hospital, Evelyn jolted awake choking. She bolted upright, gasping.

Outside her room, a familiar voice—usually so controlled—rang with desperate panic: "Save her! Whatever it takes!"

The doctor sounded strained. "Ms. Holloway has lost too much blood. Her RH-null blood type is incredibly rare. We don't have any in stock—"

Evelyn found herself moving before conscious thought. "I can donate," she heard herself say.
###Chapter 322 The Marriage Ultimatum

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn Sinclair. His expression turned glacial, suspicion radiating from every pore as he clearly doubted her motives.

Evelyn's heart constricted painfully. Not only had he failed to recognize her as the drowning victim from years ago, but he didn't even remember being her rescuer - not once, but twice.

With sudden determination, Evelyn met his stormy eyes. "You will marry me," she declared, the words slipping out before she could stop them.

A violent shudder wracked Evelyn's body as the memories assaulted her. The inky blackness of the ocean swallowing her whole. The terrifying sensation of lungs burning for air. Those traumatic moments felt as fresh as yesterday.

Was it the saltwater stinging her eyes, or something else entirely? Evelyn gasped, her face draining of color as phantom pains gripped her chest.

The sea lay eerily calm now, not even a ripple disturbing its glassy surface. Panic clawed at Evelyn's throat as she scanned the horizon. The nearest vessel floated hopelessly distant - at least fifty meters away.

Would they reach them in time?

Evelyn sprinted to the speedboat's edge, screaming toward the distant sailboat until her voice cracked. "Help! Someone help! He's drowning!" Nearly six minutes had passed since Ethan disappeared beneath the waves.

Her raw cries echoed across empty waters. The sailboat remained motionless, showing no signs of life. Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears as she collapsed to her knees.

"He'll die... just like I almost did..." Each passing second amplified her terror. Sweat slicked her palms despite the ocean breeze.

Even if drowning didn't claim him, what about sharks? Frantically patting her pockets, Evelyn realized her phone was gone. Then she spotted the speedboat's emergency button.

Her hands trembled violently as she struggled to stand. Staggering toward the controls, she located the bright red SOS button.

Just as her finger hovered over it - SPLASH!

Ethan surfaced beside the boat.

Evelyn nearly tripped in her rush to the railing. Ethan, clad in his diving gear, heaved a massive crate onto the deck with visible effort. She immediately moved to assist.

The container weighed more than she expected.

No wonder even Ethan's muscular frame strained under its bulk. Finally, he hauled himself aboard, collapsing onto the deck while gasping for air. Tearing off his dive mask, he exhaled sharply.

"Ms. Sinclair, this thing's weighted for two people," he panted. "Seriously, take swimming lessons when we get back."

Evelyn nodded rapidly, her eyes still glassy. "Are you hurt?" she asked, voice thick.

Ethan coughed before answering. "Please. Professional explorer here. Drowning would be embarrassing."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "They say it's always the strong swimmers who drown."

Noticing her red-rimmed eyes and shaky voice, Ethan studied her curiously. The underwater dive had deafened him to events above the surface.

Evelyn ducked her head, hastily passing him a towel and water bottle to mask her emotions.

After catching their breath, they examined their prize - a complete parasailing kit. "Ever tried this before?" Ethan asked.

Evelyn shook her head.

"Easy. I'll teach you," he assured with a confident smile.

Since their challenge required teamwork, Evelyn resolved to push through - swimming aside, she could handle anything else.

Ethan secured the parasail to the speedboat's tow rope with expert knots before fastening the harness around them both. Evelyn had skydiving experience and assumed this would feel similar, so her nerves remained steady.

If anything, anticipation buzzed through her veins.

Ethan engaged the autopilot. The speedboat's engine roared to life, accelerating across the open water with exhilarating speed.
###Chapter 323 Crippled

In a flash, Evelyn suddenly felt her body being yanked backward. All control slipped from her grasp as her face drained of color.

Before she could process what was happening, she found herself suspended sixty meters above the churning ocean.

A scream tore from her throat, instantly swallowed by the salty sea winds.

Her heart hammered against her ribs like a caged bird desperate for escape.

The speed was dizzying. The parasail ropes strained under the combined weight of Evelyn and Ethan as they soared higher.

They sliced through the crisp sea air, tethered to the speeding boat below.

The wind lashed at their faces - sharp, stinging, yet utterly exhilarating. Evelyn had never experienced anything like it.

In that suspended moment between sky and sea, life felt simultaneously fragile and invincible.

Pushing limits was proving dangerously addictive. Ethan adjusted his position and reached over to steady Evelyn's shoulders.

Evelyn gasped for breath, her eyes wide with wonder. "This is incredible!"

Ethan chuckled but kept focus on their mission. He pointed toward a cluster of sailboats in the distance.

Squinting downward, Evelyn deciphered the letters painted on the hulls: VOX. She cursed under her breath.

"What the hell? What does VOX have to do with this? Did they buy the rights to our show?" Even Ethan looked surprised, though at least they'd uncovered a clue.

Returning to the speedboat, Evelyn's pulse still raced from the adrenaline. With their discovery made, they turned back toward shore.

Online comments exploded in real-time: [Oh no, Evelyn looks devastated!] [Her anxiety is breaking my heart!] [If only Ethan knew what's happening... He needs to watch the replay!]

After an eternity of waiting at the rendezvous point, Adrian and Julian finally arrived with Sophia.

Julian supported Sophia as she limped dramatically. Adrian's stormy expression spoke volumes as he strode ahead, making no effort to hide his irritation.

The crew maintained a careful silence. Evelyn arched an eyebrow at the unusual sight - Adrian rarely lost his temper.

The director, who'd been waiting impatiently, raised his megaphone to deliver closing remarks. Evelyn and the others stood at attention, wisely avoiding questions about Adrian's mood.

They dispersed to separate vehicles for the final interview at VOX headquarters.

Finally free from live cameras, tension eased in the car. Gabrielle had prepared coffee and pastries for Evelyn.

Before Evelyn could take a sip, the door flew open. Adrian climbed in, snatched the coffee from Gabrielle's hands, and downed it in one gulp.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'm surprised you beat us back."

Adrian's face flushed crimson with anger. "Why did I ever agree to bring Sophia on this show? She's got zero common sense and nearly got us killed! Do you know Julian and I had to carry her up and down that damned mountain?" His voice rose. "And get this - she kept switching which leg was 'injured' the whole time! Total act!"

Evelyn burst into laughter, completely caught off guard. Adrian angrily devoured all the snacks meant for Evelyn, who merely smirked at his frustration.

"Thank God I had the sense to swap Sophia for Ethan in the second half," she remarked, shaking her head.
###Chapter 324 The Ultimate Betrayal

The viewers watching the live stream were sharp enough to catch the inconsistency and immediately erupted in outrage.

[Sophia's injury is clearly staged!] [First she limps on her right foot with Evelyn, then switches to the left with Julian, and back to the right with Adrian! Couldn't decide which leg to fake?] [Is Sophia auditioning for the role of tragic heroine? Such dramatic flair!] [This was supposed to be an adventure show, but Sophia just slowed everyone down. Now I understand why Evelyn wanted to switch partners after the first challenge!] [I take back everything I said about Evelyn being harsh - that fake deserves it!]

By the time the program wrapped up, night had fallen over Montecito.

Gabrielle and the chauffeur escorted Evelyn back to Sterling Manor. Exhausted from the day's events, Evelyn had fallen into a deep sleep during the car ride.

Lucas couldn't bring himself to wake his sleeping sister, so he carried her inside and had the maids prepare her for bed. For the following days, Evelyn remained at the manor, recovering from the physically demanding show.

Archibald spoiled her rotten with gourmet meals and every comfort imaginable. Evelyn reveled in being pampered, enjoying the luxurious lifestyle that came with being a Sterling heiress.

The moment the live broadcast ended, Sophia became the internet's favorite punching bag. Netizens even coined a cruel nickname for her: "Limpy Laurent."

The relentless mockery forced Sophia into hiding, too embarrassed to show her face in public.

When Adrian's adventure show finally aired online, the response was overwhelmingly positive.

To avoid controversy, the production team had carefully edited out any questionable content and deliberately avoided using Sophia's identity for publicity.

The polished twenty-minute highlight reel was packed with thrilling moments and genuine camaraderie. Even Sophia's fake injury was spun as an example of team unity. Watching the final cut, Evelyn felt the entire experience had been worthwhile.

The sanitized version bore little resemblance to the raw live footage. The editors truly worked miracles! During the closing interview, the host asked about the show's original inspiration.

Adrian paused thoughtfully, his striking eyes gleaming with passion. "For dreams and conviction," he declared. "Adventure isn't about courting danger or recklessness. It's about discovering life's miracles and finding strength in vulnerability."

Ethan Caldwell's answer was more personal: "To show my imaginary girlfriend how breathtaking the world can be."

After a beat of stunned silence, the studio erupted in thunderous applause.

Once the show aired, it dominated social media trends for days.

[To life and dreams! This show actually makes you believe in possibilities! And the casting is perfection!] [Evelyn looked absolutely adorable during the parasailing segment!] [Adrian and Ethan are total heartthrobs - they need to debut properly!] [Ethan and Evelyn have such natural chemistry! Did you see how she panicked when he dove into the ocean? So genuine!] [The editors were merciful with Limpy Laurent - they could've destroyed her!] [Ethan's backstory sounds fascinating. I need to know more!]

While all participants received attention, the focus remained firmly on Evelyn and Ethan's interactions. Their segments became the show's highlight, particularly the heart-stopping moment when Ethan disappeared underwater and Evelyn's frantic screams for help.

Her raw, unfiltered panic was clearly unrehearsed. Scanning through the comments, Evelyn hesitated before calling Adrian. "Everyone's obsessing over Ethan's imaginary girlfriend. Isn't that just twisting the knife?"
###Chapter 325 A Perfect Match?

Nathan Blackwood let out a mocking chuckle. Ethan Caldwell had just been dumped by his girlfriend who had also drained his bank accounts.

The woman had even cheated on him with a wealthy tycoon. That's why he claimed she was dead - the betrayal still burned fresh in his memory. Evelyn Sinclair could only shake her head in disbelief. How ruthless! The Kensington Group.

Inside the boardroom, executives trembled as department heads delivered their reports. Everyone feared displeasing President Blackwood and becoming his next example.

The atmosphere grew heavier with each presentation. When the Investment Department's turn came, their newly promoted director, Henry Yates, stepped forward with confidence.

Henry had yet to prove himself in this position. To secure his role, he needed to impress the formidable Nathan Blackwood.

Clearing his throat, Henry began with enthusiasm. "President Blackwood, our team has been analyzing entertainment industry trends, particularly reality shows."

"While the market is saturated with similar formats, we believe groundbreaking innovation could capture audiences' hearts."

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "What exactly do you propose?" His voice carried an edge that made others shift uncomfortably.

Henry eagerly inserted a flash drive and projected his findings. "This inspiration came from your nephew, Adrian. He's truly a credit to your family."

"The program has gained tremendous popularity recently. Adrian's charm, intelligence and bravery make him perfect for this concept." With a click, footage of Evelyn and Ethan parasailing filled the screen.

The speedboat sliced through turquoise waters, launching the parasail skyward. High above, Ethan steadied Evelyn in his arms as the drone camera zoomed in. Evelyn's radiant smile dominated the frame while enthusiastic comments flooded the screen:

[Relationship goals!]
[They look perfect together!]
[This is true love!]

"President, we could either license this format or develop something similar for our network," Henry concluded proudly.

Silence swallowed the room. The temperature seemed to drop several degrees as Henry continued praising Adrian and the show's potential.

He assumed complimenting Nathan's nephew would please the notoriously difficult executive.

Nathan's gaze remained locked on the screen, his expression darkening by the second. His jaw tightened visibly, the air around him crackling with restrained fury.

Why were viewers calling Evelyn and Ethan a perfect match? What nonsense! Were they all blind?

Harrison, Nathan's assistant, watched Henry's enthusiastic presentation with growing horror. As the video played, his expression turned increasingly pained.

He wanted to intervene but one look at Nathan's stormy countenance silenced him. This was going very, very badly.

Harrison shot Henry a pitying glance. The poor man had only held his position for weeks, yet now stood on career thin ice.

Henry finished his pitch and turned expectantly to Nathan, convinced his proposal would succeed. After all, who wouldn't invest in family?

The room held its breath. Nathan's glacial stare could have frozen lava.

Henry's confident smile faltered. Confused, he glanced at Harrison who only offered a sympathetic shrug.

Before Henry could attempt damage control, Nathan stood abruptly. "Meeting adjourned." His clipped words hung in the air as he strode from the room without another glance.
###Chapter 326 He Wants to Experience It Himself

Harrison followed Nathan to the CEO's office. His skin prickled under Nathan's glacial stare.

"President Blackwood, is this your idea of proper arrangements?" Nathan's voice was razor-sharp, devoid of any warmth.

Harrison swallowed hard. "Sir, for Young Master Adrian's reality show, not only has the Sterling family shown support, but even Old Master Blackwood personally contacted major media outlets—"

Nathan's eyes darkened like storm clouds. "In that case, Kensington Group will be the sole investor. Understood?"

"Absolutely, sir. Consider it done."

Nathan lifted his espresso cup with elegant fingers. "Since we're investing, I'll be making a personal visit. I want to experience this production firsthand."

Harrison's eyebrows shot up. He processed the bombshell in record time. "Of course! You'll appear as a mystery guest. This will generate tremendous buzz for our show."

Nathan gave a satisfied nod. "Dismissed."

Harrison barely exhaled before rushing back in. "Sir—Old Master Blackwood has arrived."

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly. He waved a hand in silent permission.

Sophia Blackwood swept into the office like a hurricane, her designer heels clicking against marble. Margaret trailed behind, lips pursed in disapproval.

"Grandfather. Mother." Nathan's voice remained neutral. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"

Margaret's manicured fingers clenched. "Your sister's abroad, your father's in Tokyo—and you haven't set foot in Highland Estates in weeks! Are we not permitted to check on you?"

Old Master Blackwood cleared his throat. "We're dining with the Sterlings tonight."

Nathan's espresso cup froze mid-air. "The Sterlings?"

Margaret's gasp was theatrical. "Absolutely not! That Evelyn parades around with a different man every week! I showed you those scandalous photos—"

"Enough!" The old man's cane struck the floor with a crack. Margaret flinched.

Turning to Nathan, his grandfather's voice softened. "Son, we need to solidify things with Evelyn. You nearly started a war with those pirates for her."

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his cup.

"I know your feelings. But does she reciprocate? We lost three cargo ships, and the Sterlings bailed us out. A marriage alliance would benefit both families immensely."

Sophia Blackwood was no fool. He recognized Nathan's obsession with Evelyn Sinclair. With her connections and the Sterling fortune, any sacrifice would be worthwhile.

Nathan exhaled through his nose. "Fine."

Margaret looked ready to combust. "Father! Have you seen Evelyn's social media? The entire internet mocks her escapades! We'll become laughingstocks—"

"Silence!" The old man's roar shook the windows. "Who are you to criticize the Sterling heiress? The Blackwoods are fortunate they're even considering us after what we did!"

Nathan stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows, already calculating how to turn this dinner to his advantage. The game was far from over.
###Chapter 327 You Don't Have to Participate

Margaret Blackwood froze when Nathan's grandfather reprimanded her. Her position in the family had always been precarious.

Ever since that incident where she'd helped Sophia steal the old man's emerald pipe, Margaret had lived in constant dread of being cast out.

With Sophia's whereabouts unknown, Margaret didn't even have anyone to confide in anymore.

When the elder Blackwood scolded her, Nathan simply stood there, watching coldly without uttering a word. His icy gaze made her skin crawl, fueling her resentment toward Evelyn Sinclair.

Nathan turned to his assistant, Harrison. "Escort Mrs. Blackwood back to Aspen Lodge. She won't be joining us for dinner tonight."

Margaret stiffened. Old Master Blackwood nodded in agreement. "Good. We can't afford any missteps in mending relations with the Sterling family tonight."

Neither of them cared for her opinion. Margaret seethed at Nathan's dismissive attitude. By the time she left, her expression was stormy.

The dinner was held in an exclusive private dining room, attended only by the Sterlings and the Blackwoods. William Sterling arrived with his son Alexander and daughter Evelyn.

Nathan and his grandfather had just taken their seats when the Sterlings entered. The occasion wasn't overly formal, so Evelyn had opted for a sleek gray-blue gown paired with Manolo Blahniks.

Her effortless elegance carried a hint of playful charm.

William and Old Master Blackwood exchanged pleasantries, carefully avoiding personal matters and sticking to business discussions.

Despite the polite atmosphere, tension hummed beneath the surface. Evelyn could feel a pair of eyes burning into her from across the table.

It was infuriating. When that intense gaze landed on her again, she couldn't take it anymore.

She lifted her head abruptly and met Nathan's stare head-on. He blinked, momentarily startled, before his lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. Evelyn clenched her jaw but refused to look away.

What game was Nathan Blackwood playing in front of their families? She hadn’t wanted to come at all, but William had reminded her that Nathan had saved her life. The least she could do was stay for a while before excusing herself.

Noticing the time, William gave Evelyn a subtle signal.

"Actually," he began smoothly, "Evelyn and I are deeply grateful for the Blackwood family's assistance. Beyond our business collaboration, Evelyn has prepared a small token of appreciation for you, Chairman Blackwood."

Evelyn smiled and retrieved a velvet box from her clutch, handing it to the elder Blackwood. "Chairman, I acquired this from a private collector in France. It was crafted by the same master who made your original emerald pipe."

"I heard you frequently visit the museum to admire it," she continued. "I understand how much it meant to you, so as a gesture of gratitude, I tracked this one down."

Old Master Blackwood's lips twitched.

She knows I visit the museum just to stare at my own stolen pipe? Is she mocking me?

When he opened the box, his breath caught. This pipe wasn’t identical to his lost treasure—it was superior. The emeralds were richer in color, more flawless in clarity.

Meticulously preserved, its value was indisputable—likely exceeding ten figures. Even if one could afford it, the collector might never have parted with it.

The Sterlings had somehow secured the impossible.

Excitement flared in the old man’s chest, but he hesitated to touch it, afraid his fingers might tarnish its brilliance. Then, realization dimmed his enthusiasm.

This extravagant gift was nothing more than repayment for Nathan saving Evelyn’s life.

By presenting it, William had made his stance clear: no marriage alliance. Money meant nothing to the Sterlings, and they wouldn’t sacrifice Evelyn’s happiness for business.

Old Master Blackwood saw through the maneuver instantly. He glanced at Nathan, whose darkened expression confirmed he understood too. A frosty aura enveloped him as he fixed Evelyn with a penetrating stare.

Evelyn, however, kept her head down, quietly eating her meal. She had no interest in their unspoken battle.
###Chapter 328 Normal Interactions

Old Master Blackwood smiled warmly. "We deeply regret how we treated Evelyn in the past. If there's any chance, we'd love to make amends." William Sterling waved his hand dismissively.

"Think nothing of it. Young people often act without thinking. What's done is done, and Evelyn has moved on. There's no need to dwell on it."

"Just interact normally," William suggested.

"Normal interactions," Nathan Blackwood repeated under his breath. His dark eyes flickered with some unreadable emotion before curving into a slight smile. "Yes, we should interact normally."

Nathan lifted his gaze to meet Evelyn's, giving her a knowing smirk.

Feeling the intense stare from across the table, Evelyn instinctively looked up to find Nathan watching her with an annoyingly charming expression.

Why is he smiling like that? Evelyn nearly choked on her drink, her appetite suddenly vanishing.

She set down her fork with deliberate care and rolled her eyes at him. Strangely, instead of anger, this only seemed to amuse him more.

Nathan's smile widened as he observed Evelyn's barely contained irritation. He found her exasperation oddly endearing. Even her eye-rolling seemed charming - how had he never noticed that before?

While William and Old Master Blackwood continued their animated conversation, Alexander Sterling discreetly observed his sister and Nathan.

The charged atmosphere between them was... peculiar.

"By the way, Mr. Blackwood," Alexander smoothly interjected, "I heard several of your cargo ships encountered issues recently. Sterling Corporation's fleet would be happy to assist with transportation if needed."

Evelyn was about to exhale in relief when Nathan simply said "Noted" without breaking eye contact with her. His persistent attention was driving her crazy.

Is he serious right now? What game is he playing? Evelyn turned to her father abruptly.

"Dad, I just remembered I promised to meet Isabella. I should get going." Honestly, she'd already fulfilled her social obligations by thanking the Blackwoods. Staying for the full dinner was unnecessary.

William nodded. "Of course, darling."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Goodbye Dad. Chairman Blackwood."

She gathered her things and made her swift exit, only to be intercepted by Nathan mere steps from the door.

"Evelyn."

She spun around impatiently.

Since when did Nathan Blackwood become so persistent? Did someone switch his medication?

"Mr. Blackwood, is there something else you need?" Her tone could freeze molten lava.

One polite dinner didn't mean they were suddenly best friends.

Nathan seemed momentarily taken aback by her icy demeanor. He approached slowly, carefully controlling his expression. His dark eyes held hers with unsettling intensity.

"Your father suggested we interact normally," he said calmly, though his presence felt anything but calm. "You should comply."

Evelyn frowned at him like he'd grown a second head. "That's not what he meant."

"Then what did he mean?" Nathan's lips quirked.

Evelyn nearly choked on her response. "How should I know?"

Suddenly, her phone was no longer in her hand.

In one fluid motion, Nathan had taken it, his elegant fingers navigating her contacts. He unblocked his number with practiced ease.

"From now on, no more blocking me. Or I'll have to tell your father."

Evelyn stared in disbelief.

He actually said that with a straight face? Her father clearly meant for Nathan to keep his distance! Was this man deliberately misunderstanding or just being obtuse?

Evelyn felt her sanity slipping away.
###Chapter 329 They're the Same Person

Evelyn Sinclair clutched her phone, her fingers trembling with barely contained rage. Nathan Blackwood had not only unblocked himself from her contacts but had the audacity to rename himself Life Saver in her phone.

The sheer arrogance made her blood boil. Was this his way of guilting her into keeping his number?

She bit her lower lip, refusing to engage, and spun on her heel to leave. Nathan followed, his steps unhurried but persistent, matching her pace like a shadow.

As they reached the restaurant's grand entrance, he suddenly spoke, his voice low but firm. "Evelyn, I'll teach you how to swim."

The memory of the near-fatal plane crash flashed through his mind—the terror of searching for her in the endless ocean, only to learn from Lucas Sterling that she couldn't swim.

That variety show incident with Ethan Caldwell? Her panic hadn’t been for him. It was the water itself that paralyzed her.

How could someone as fiercely independent as Evelyn not know how to swim? He needed to change that.

But at his words, Evelyn froze. Her back stiffened, her breath hitching as if the air had turned to ice.

The suffocating weight of old memories pressed down on her—the sensation of being held underwater, lungs burning, darkness swallowing her.

Even now, just the thought made her skin prickle with cold sweat.

She turned slowly, her almond-shaped eyes sharp with frost. Nathan frowned, confused by the sudden shift in her demeanor.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said, voice dripping with disdain, "meddling is an exceptionally irritating trait."

He stepped closer, undeterred. "Is it? Then tell me why you refuse. Give me one good reason."

His dark eyes gleamed under the restaurant's entrance lights, like stars reflected in a midnight lake.

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. Her face paled, the chill in her gaze unmistakable. Nathan realized he’d stumbled upon something deeply painful—which only made him more determined to understand.

For a moment, she hesitated. Then she laughed, the sound hollow.

"Have you forgotten, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Three years ago, you pulled me out of a swimming pool before I bargained my blood for your hand in marriage."

"Why would I learn to swim now, just to drown again?"

Nathan recoiled as if struck. Shock and something darker—something like horror—flashed across his face.

Evelyn watched his reaction with grim satisfaction. Her smile widened, but the light in her eyes dimmed.

"So you didn’t remember?" she mused. "Or maybe you never knew the woman you saved was the same one who later traded her blood for your name."

Nathan’s face drained of color. He remembered the emergency call that had sent him to that private pool—the woman floating lifeless in the water.

He’d revived her, sent her to the hospital, and left without another thought.

He never connected her to the desperate woman who later appeared, offering her blood in exchange for marriage.

Now, the truth slammed into him like a physical blow. His chest tightened, breath turning shallow.

A thousand questions burned in his mind—How did she end up in that pool? Who did this to her?—but Evelyn only smiled, cold and detached.

"It doesn’t matter now," she said, her voice brittle. "The past is dead. Let it stay buried."

And with that, she walked away, leaving Nathan standing there, drowning in the weight of what he’d just learned.
###Chapter 330 The Taste of Vengeance

Three years ago, Nathan Blackwood only had eyes for Vanessa Holloway.

Why would he bother remembering the face of someone he'd casually rescued? Nathan simply didn't care. So,

Evelyn can't swim because she nearly drowned? Nathan's expression darkened.

His obsidian eyes swirled with stormy emotions. "I'm sorry." All the words he wanted to say condensed into those two syllables.

Evelyn found it amusing and let out a bitter laugh. "You should be."

"You didn't think those underground fighters would seek revenge after I saved you, did you? That they'd come after me instead?" The words struck Nathan like lightning. His face drained of color.

He seized her wrist with sudden intensity. "What did you say?" His reaction puzzled Evelyn as she gave a careless shrug.

At this point, clarity was better than ambiguity.

It no longer mattered who saved whom. Between them, the scales of debt had tipped beyond measure.

"Mr. Blackwood, I could swim perfectly fine three years ago. The reason I refuse to learn again? Because someone held my head underwater until I nearly drowned."

"Is that reason sufficient for you?" Evelyn spoke with icy detachment, pushing away the suffocating memories. She'd made her choices.

She'd never regretted saving Nathan, even with the consequences. In the past, she might have resented him. But that was then.

Now that she'd freed herself from her obsession, none of it mattered anymore.

Nathan's expression turned thunderous. Shock morphed into white-hot rage and consuming hatred.

He'd always assumed those men would never find him if he stayed away. The night air grew colder around them.

Evelyn shivered - she'd always hated the cold. She turned to leave this suffocating space.

"What difference does it make if he knows? If he had any decency, he'd disappear from my life forever!" Before she could step away, strong arms yanked her back.

Her spine collided with a solid chest as his familiar cedar scent enveloped her. The unexpected contact froze her in place.

Nathan's voice came out rough with emotion. "Evelyn, I swear to you - I'll find them. Every last one. And I'll make them pay." She wrenched free immediately.

Her voice could have frosted glass. "It's irrelevant. The past is dead." Just then, their respective drivers pulled up.

As Evelyn moved toward her car, Nathan grabbed her again. "Nathan Blackwood!" The night swallowed her protest.

The wind howled between them. Evelyn's teeth chattered - she needed to escape this frozen purgatory.

"Knowing changes nothing! If you feel any remorse, you'll vanish from my life!" She spun to leave, but he caught her waist.

Pressed against his warmth, surrounded by his scent, she momentarily forgot to breathe.

Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I'll hunt them down, Evelyn. I promise you that."

"And then what? Kill them?" She shoved him away, her tone arctic. "Let it go."

"It's ancient history." The arrival of their drivers interrupted the confrontation.

Evelyn reached for her car door when Nathan's grip tightened. "Nathan Blackwood!" The name tore from her throat.
###Chapter 331 I'm Begging You

Evelyn Sinclair was at her wit's end.

Why was Nathan Blackwood clinging to her like some persistent insect that refused to be shaken off? She wanted to scream at him for his sheer audacity.

Nathan's grip on her wrist was unyielding, his voice icy and resolute. "Evelyn, whether you believe me or not, I regret everything. If I could just—"

She cut him off sharply, the pain in her eyes impossible to conceal any longer.

"Nathan Blackwood, I've spent years haunted by nightmares of the past."

Her voice trembled. "From the moment I met you, I haven't known a single day of true happiness. I don't regret saving you, but for the love of God, I'm begging you—let it go. Stop dragging us back into that hell."

Nathan's regret meant nothing to her. It didn't erase the three years of torment she had endured. If anything, it was almost laughable.

His entire body stiffened at her words.

The raw agony in her voice, the way her eyes glistened with unshed tears—it shook him to his core. He couldn't even bring himself to meet her gaze.

All that suffering... and he had been oblivious to it.

Evelyn studied his profile—the sharp jawline, the straight nose, the perfectly sculpted features that had once made her heart race.

She had been obsessed with him, drowning in a love she couldn't escape.

Now? All she wanted was distance.

Quickly schooling her expression, she turned away, forcing a cold smile.

"You don't need to apologize. You don't need to regret anything. It's over. Just... move on."

She assumed his remorse stemmed from guilt—now that he knew why she couldn't swim, why she had panicked that night.

But it didn't matter.

Her love for him had been one-sided from the start, born from the moment he had thrown himself in front of her on the streets of Paris.

She didn’t want to revisit that memory.

Without another word, she turned and slipped into the Sterling family car.

Nathan wanted to chase after her, but his feet remained rooted to the ground.

The way she had looked at him—so distant, so unfamiliar—made him question what right he had to stop her.

He watched in silence as the car disappeared down the street, then turned and walked away.

Velvet Lounge

Nathan pushed open the door to the private room, the lively chatter inside coming to an abrupt halt.

Tristan Whitmore stood up in surprise.

"Blackwood? I thought you had dinner plans with Evelyn and her family. What are you doing here?"

Their group of close friends met regularly, and Nathan usually attended without fail.

But tonight, he had declined, proudly declaring he had prior engagements—with Evelyn.

At the mention of her name, Nathan's expression darkened.

His chest ached as if struck by a sledgehammer.

Without a word, he grabbed a bottle of vodka and tilted his head back, drinking deeply.

The room fell silent.

The air around him was thick with bitterness and cold fury.

"Mr. Blackwood... did something happen? Did Evelyn upset you again?"

One of the more oblivious socialites in their circle spoke up, having heard Tristan mention Nathan's constant struggles with Evelyn.

Nathan's grip on the bottle tightened, his gaze turning glacial.

Tristan groaned internally.

Before he could intervene, the man continued, smirking.

"Honestly, that woman has no shame. She's just a divorcee you discarded. The fact that you even glance her way is a privilege, and she dares to treat you like this?"

Tristan buried his face in his hands.

"You idiot..."

Under the dim lighting, Nathan slowly lifted his head.

His eyes burned with a dangerous, feral intensity as they locked onto the man.

Then—

He slammed the bottle down onto the table with a deafening crash.
###Chapter 332 I Can't Let Her Go

The deafening crash echoed through the private room.

Every crystal glass on the marble tabletop shattered instantly. Razor-sharp fragments sprayed across the room, one slicing across Nathan Blackwood's cheekbone.

A crimson trail of blood snaked down his chiseled face. The VIP lounge plunged into an icy silence so thick you could hear a pin drop. The young aristocrat who'd spoken paled visibly.

His mouth snapped shut. He'd realized too late that he'd crossed an unforgivable line by mentioning her name. Nathan's eyes burned with barely restrained fury.

An arctic chill radiated from his powerful frame as he rose to his full height, looming over the trembling man like a predator.

"Who gave you the right to speak her name?" Nathan's voice was steel wrapped in velvet.

Without warning, his designer shoe connected with the man's ribs.

The aristocrat curled into a fetal position, sweat beading on his forehead despite the room's temperature. Not a single onlooker dared intervene.

Tristan Whitmore sprang into action. "Easy there!" He shot a warning glance at the others. "Nathan's had one too many. Clear out - I'll handle this."

The crowd didn't need telling twice. They practically tripped over themselves exiting, dragging the injured man between them like discarded trash.

The aftermath resembled a war zone. Only Nathan and Tristan remained.

Nathan's fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. Veins stood out on his temples like live wires.

Tristan guided him back to the plush leather seating, signaling discreetly for staff to clean up. A fresh round of premium liquor appeared moments later.

"Drink." Tristan filled a crystal tumbler to the brim, taking a healthy swig himself. Nathan downed the amber liquid in one burning gulp.

The alcohol scorched his throat but gradually loosened the vise around his chest.

His broad shoulders shook slightly as he buried his face in his hands.

"She nearly died because of me, and I was oblivious." The revelations kept coming like body blows.

Three years of marriage where he'd treated her like an afterthought. The realization gutted him. And still he'd demanded her forgiveness.

"Evelyn must despise me." The words tasted like ash in his mouth. An invisible hand seemed to squeeze his heart mercilessly.

The memory of learning about her near-drowning shattered something fundamental in him. Self-loathing rose like bile.

Why hadn't he questioned who needed help at the pool that day? Why had he arrived too late? How could he have married her yet failed to cherish her?

Now the bridge was burned beyond repair.

Evelyn Sinclair would never look at him with those adoring eyes again. Tristan frowned, missing crucial context but recognizing the root cause.

He'd never make the mistake of underestimating Evelyn's hold again. Seeing Nathan's disheveled state confirmed what he'd suspected - the man was utterly, irrevocably in love.

Nathan emptied glass after glass until his vision blurred. Only one name passed his lips between drinks.

"Evelyn...Evelyn..."

Tristan exhaled sharply. "You're really hung up on her, huh? What's so special about that woman?"

Even half-conscious, Nathan responded instinctively. "Love her...would give anything...but she's done with me." His voice cracked like dry kindling.

He wanted to love her with the same fierce devotion she'd once shown him.

Tristan stood. "You're wasted. Let's get you home."

"Need to see Evelyn," Nathan slurred.

"Fine."
###Chapter 333 Already Here

The iron gates of Sterling Manor loomed in the darkness. Tristan Whitmore sat in his car, fingers tapping impatiently on the steering wheel before he finally dialed Evelyn Sinclair’s number.

The call connected after several rings. Evelyn’s voice was thick with sleep, sharp with irritation. "Who the hell is this?"

Tristan exhaled sharply. "It’s me. Tristan Whitmore."

A pause. Then, reluctantly, "What do you want?"

"Nathan’s drunk out of his mind, and he’s currently sprawled in front of your gates. Come get him before he freezes to death."

Silence stretched between them.

Then, cold and clipped, "Take him and get the hell away from my house."

Tristan gritted his teeth. "We’re already here. If you don’t come out, I’m leaving him right where he is. Your problem now."

He hung up before she could argue, exhaling sharply. Dealing with Evelyn these days required nerves of steel.

Without hesitation, he hauled Nathan out of the passenger seat and dumped him unceremoniously in the middle of the driveway.

"This is on you, man," Tristan muttered, patting Nathan’s shoulder before retreating to his car.

He didn’t look back as he drove away.

Evelyn stared at her phone, Tristan’s words sinking in.

Already here.

She threw off the covers and strode to the balcony, shivering as the cold night air hit her skin. Below, a car’s taillights disappeared down the winding driveway.

"Unbelievable," she hissed under her breath.

Her father and brothers were asleep. She slipped on a robe and padded downstairs, her bare feet silent against the marble floors.

The front door creaked as she stepped outside.

Nathan Blackwood sat slumped against the gate, his usually immaculate appearance in ruins—tie loose, hair disheveled, the sharp scent of alcohol clinging to him.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Nathan Blackwood," she said, voice like ice. "Are you auditioning for a tragic hero role now?"

He lifted his head. His eyes were bloodshot, his expression raw.

"Evelyn," he rasped.

Her breath caught despite herself.

"I’m sorry," he said, voice breaking. "If you just—give me one more chance—"

Her chest tightened, an old, familiar ache flaring to life.

Then, just as quickly, she smothered it.

Before she could speak, Nathan’s head dropped forward, his body going limp.

Unconscious.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers curling into fists.

That damned dinner had dredged up too many memories—wounds she’d thought long scarred over, now raw and bleeding again.

Forgiveness? She’d tried. Over and over.

But some things couldn’t be undone.

She had made peace with her own foolish heart long ago. What she wouldn’t do was reopen old wounds for his drunken regret.

Yet here he was, pathetic and broken at her doorstep.

Three years ago, this would have shattered her. Three years ago, she might have wept at the sight of him like this.

Now?

She wiped away the single traitorous tear that escaped.

"We’re even," she whispered. "Let’s just pretend we never knew each other."

Nathan didn’t move.

She turned away.

Then, on impulse, she spun back and kicked him square in the ribs.

"That’s for Europe," she muttered.

Without another glance, she marched back inside and slammed the door behind her.

Leaning against it, she pulled out her phone and dialed Tristan.

Straight to voicemail.

"Coward," she hissed.

Next, she called Gregory Thornton.

He answered on the second ring.

"It’s Evelyn Sinclair," she said, voice clipped. "Nathan Blackwood is passed out drunk at my gates. Either come get him, or I’m calling the police."

She hung up before he could reply.

Twenty minutes later, from her bedroom window, she watched Gregory’s car pull up, load Nathan inside, and disappear into the night.

She drew the curtains closed.

Sleep wouldn’t come easy tonight.
###Chapter 334 She's Vanishing Without a Trace

A sudden crisis erupted at one of Sterling Corporation's international branches, demanding immediate attention.

Alexander Sterling was tied up with urgent matters at headquarters, making it impossible for him to leave the country.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped in without hesitation, volunteering to handle the situation in his stead.

The trip would also serve as a much-needed escape—a chance to breathe away from the suffocating tension back home.

News of Evelyn's departure reached Nathan Blackwood within the hour.

He was in his office, nursing a cup of hangover tea, when Harrison delivered the blow.

"What?" Nathan's grip on the cup faltered, scalding liquid spilling across confidential documents. He shot to his feet, a sharp twinge shooting through his side—an unwelcome reminder of last night's recklessness.

"She left the country?" His voice was dangerously calm.

Harrison swallowed hard. "Yes, sir. When I delivered the return gift to Sterling Manor, it was received by Mr. Lucas Sterling."

A pause. Then the damning words: "He mentioned Ms. Sinclair is traveling abroad... and may not return."

Nathan's face drained of color.

Not return?

His chest constricted violently, as if an invisible hand had seized his heart.

"Where?" The word tore from his throat. "Which flight? Which destination?"

Panic clawed at him—raw, irrational, consuming. The thought of her slipping away, vanishing beyond his reach, was unbearable.

Harrison hesitated. "She didn't take a commercial flight, sir. The Sterlings sent their private jet."

Nathan's jaw locked.

A private jet meant no passenger manifest. No easy trail to follow.

She was deliberately making it impossible for him to find her.

The realization struck like a physical blow. She wasn't just leaving—she was erasing herself from his life entirely.

"No." The word was a vow, ice-cold and unyielding. "Find her."

He met Harrison's gaze, and the assistant flinched at the storm brewing in those steel-gray eyes.

"You have one hour to track that jet's destination." Nathan's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Fail me, and you can disappear along with her."

Harrison's spine straightened. "Understood, sir."

He fled the office, already dialing his contacts. The clock was ticking—and Nathan Blackwood wasn't a man who accepted defeat.

With that final remark, Nathan Blackwood strode out the door. Four hours later.

At the Paris headquarters of Sterling Worldwide's French subsidiary, Nathan stood imposingly at the grand entrance. His towering frame commanded attention.

His chiseled features could have been carved from marble, each angle perfectly defined. The sharp line of his jaw, the aristocratic slope of his nose - everything about him screamed privilege and power.

An aura of quiet intensity surrounded him, drawing curious glances from every passerby. The receptionist approached him for the third time. "Monsieur, are you certain there's nothing I can assist you with?"

Nathan merely offered a polite but distant smile. "I'm waiting for someone." Beneath his composed exterior, his pulse raced erratically.

Even knowing Evelyn Sinclair was somewhere in this building, he couldn't bring himself to barge into her office. Not after everything. She'd only despise him more for it.

So he waited in the lobby like some lovesick fool, hoping to manufacture a chance encounter. She'd see through the ruse immediately, but that hardly mattered anymore.

A bitter chuckle escaped his lips. "Since when did I become this cautious?" He shook his head. "Worth it, if I get to see her face again."

Upstairs, Evelyn had spent the afternoon extinguishing corporate fires. Raphael Dubois, the subsidiary's CEO and her former classmate, walked beside her as they descended in the private elevator.

"Your timing was impeccable as always," Raphael remarked with genuine admiration. "That acquisition would have collapsed without your intervention."

Evelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. The stilettos clicking against marble accentuated her commanding presence. "Only because I have the best team in Europe backing me up."

As they reached the ground floor, excited whispers reached them. "Who is that gorgeous man waiting by the lounge? I've never seen anyone so striking!" "I tried getting his number earlier - completely shut me down!"

Evelyn's steps faltered when her gaze landed on the familiar figure rising from the plush armchair. Nathan's dark eyes locked onto hers with an intensity that made her breath catch.

In three strides, he was before them. Evelyn's nails dug into her palms as she fought to maintain her composure.

This infuriating man was like a ghost she couldn't escape. She remained silent as Nathan's assessing gaze flicked to Raphael before returning to her, softening instantly.

"Why did you leave New York so suddenly?" The question came out rougher than intended.

Evelyn's spine straightened. Her eyebrow arched in challenge. "Since when do I need your permission to travel?"
###Chapter 335 A Dull Ache in My Side

Evelyn's frosty demeanor didn't elicit even a hint of irritation from Nathan.

Instead, his gaze softened, warm and tender as it lingered on her. "I was just asking. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."

Not that it mattered—Nathan had other ways of finding out.

Beside Evelyn, Raphael Dubois cleared his throat lightly.

"Ms. Sinclair, is this your friend?"

"No." Evelyn shut that down immediately.

"Since we've resolved the matter, would you consider staying a few more days before leaving?" Raphael suggested smoothly.

Nathan's eyes darkened, the warmth vanishing as his gaze sliced toward Raphael. The chill in the air was palpable.

Evelyn frowned and shook her head. "Next time. I have urgent matters waiting for me back home."

"What a shame. Safe travels, then."

Raphael extended his hand politely. Evelyn offered him a perfunctory smile, shook it, and turned to leave.

Nathan followed, his long strides easily keeping pace.

Together, they looked like a vision—two striking figures who commanded attention effortlessly.

Nathan persisted, trailing after Evelyn despite her pointed silence. He boarded the Sterling family's private jet without hesitation.

"I came looking for you last night," he murmured. "Did I startle you?"

Evelyn scoffed.

"Sorry, I didn't see you."

Nathan paused, his voice dropping lower. "No one was with me the whole time?" He tilted his head slightly. "And yet, my side aches a little. There’s even a footprint on my clothes."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a flicker of guilt crossing her features before she schooled them back into indifference.

Nathan was surprised by her unusual tolerance today.

It almost felt... rewarding.

Unable to bear his scrutiny any longer, Evelyn finally snapped. "Mr. Blackwood, why are you here?"

Nathan hesitated. Every prepared excuse evaporated on his tongue.

His voice came out rough, barely above a whisper. "I thought you didn’t want to see me anymore. So I came to find you."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard, then let out a derisive snort and turned away, feigning sleep.

Nathan watched her, his expression unreadable. There were a thousand things he wanted to say—words that lodged in his throat, unspoken.

"Evelyn," he said suddenly, "is there anything you want?"

He would give it to her. Stars, the moon—anything.

Evelyn laughed, sharp and humorless. "All I want is for you to stay away from me."

Nathan's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before he smoothed it back into place. He lowered his lashes, masking the pain that flashed in his eyes.

When he looked up again, his expression was carefully neutral.

"That’s the one thing I can’t do," he said lightly. "So don’t waste your breath."

With that, he reclined in his seat and closed his eyes, feigning sleep just as she had.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and exhaled sharply before doing the same.

Back in Montecito, Evelyn finally had a few peaceful days to herself. She went fishing, indulged in shopping sprees—blissfully free of Nathan Blackwood’s relentless presence.

The first episode of Adrian’s adventure show had been a roaring success, earning rave reviews and skyrocketing in popularity. Julian Moreau, riding the wave, secured several lucrative deals. Even Ethan Caldwell was tapped for commercials.

The only one floundering was Sophia Laurent, whose reputation had taken a hit after the backlash. Still, the controversy kept her name in the headlines—a twisted silver lining.

Fans demanded she quit, but Sophia knew walking away now would be career suicide.

So, despite everything, she signed on for the second episode.

Evelyn, reluctantly accepting her own invitation, arrived at the filming location with minimal enthusiasm.

Rumors claimed this round wouldn’t be as grueling as the first, but Evelyn wasn’t holding her breath.

When she got there, the others were already waiting. Adrian lit up and moved to sweep her into one of his signature spins—only to yelp when Evelyn’s foot connected with his shin.

"You—you’re vicious!"

"Oops. Didn’t see you there, Niel."

"Liar!" Adrian groaned, rubbing his leg.

Evelyn smirked before smoothing her expression and greeting the rest of the cast with practiced charm.
###Chapter 336 Diva, Stay Strong!

Evelyn Sinclair opted for effortless athleisure wear with minimal makeup. Yet nothing could dim her radiant aura.

Her poise remained regal, her confidence unshaken. Ethan Caldwell gave her a casual wave while Julian Moreau approached for a polite embrace. Sophia Laurent stood out in her sequined cocktail dress, looking every inch the red carpet starlet.

Her smile was cautious this time, a marked contrast to her previous arrogance. "Evelyn, it's been too long," she offered.

Evelyn responded with perfect neutrality - neither warm nor cold. Her gaze lingered curiously on Sophia's outfit. "This is an adventure show," she thought. "Why is she dressed for a gala? Does she think the audience won't notice?"

But she kept silent. This wasn't her circus, and Sophia certainly wasn't her monkey.

As the last participants arrived, the director began his lengthy briefing, switching on the live feed. Even Adrian Blackwood tapped his foot impatiently.

Finally, an assistant whispered in the director's ear. Clearing his throat, the man announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a last-minute change. Our title sponsor for this episode has changed hands. The new investor now owns the program's copyright."

Adrian's jaw dropped. "What? How? I wasn't informed!" The producer had personally secured the original backers, yet someone had swooped in without his knowledge.

The director merely smiled. "Patience, Adrian. The surprise is worth waiting for."

The crew erupted in applause as he continued, "Please welcome our mystery guest and new sole sponsor - Mr. Nathan Blackwood!"

Deafening silence filled the studio. All eyes swung between the emerging Nathan Blackwood and Sophia, whose clapping echoed awkwardly in the quiet space.

The group collectively ignored Sophia's desperate performance. Adrian rushed forward, flustered. "Uncle? What are you doing here?"

Julian and Ethan maintained perfect poker faces, wisely avoiding the brewing storm. Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. "You've got to be kidding me," she muttered.

The live chat exploded:

[OMG! Most awkward entrance ever!]
[Mr. Blackwood supporting his nephew - so sweet!]
[Look at Sophia trying so hard. Cringe!]
[Queen Evelyn staying unbothered as always!]
[This episode's gonna be fire! So much drama!]
[You got this, Diva!]

Nathan strode forward, utterly unfazed by the tension. His expression softened, though his commanding presence remained.

Backstage, Harrison had risked his neck with advice. "Sir, you might want to smile more for Ms. Sinclair."

Nathan had scoffed. "Lions don't concern themselves with sheep. I'll win Evelyn my way."
###Chapter 337 Has Your Foot Recovered?

All eyes turned toward Nathan Blackwood in perfect synchronization. The director announced with great fanfare that Nathan's primary purpose for visiting was to experience the groundbreaking nature of this show.

Adrian Blackwood didn't buy a single word of it. He knew his uncle was just being intrusive. His business had barely survived countless struggles, only to become just another asset in Nathan's vast portfolio.

The most infuriating part? Adrian had to clench his teeth and force himself to thank his so-called benevolent Uncle Nathan!

His chest tightened with suffocating frustration.

The director beamed and placed an opaque box in the center.

"This time, we have six participants—two per team. Those who draw the same color will be paired together."

Just as everyone reached for their cards, the director held up a hand.

"Mr. Blackwood holds a selection card. As our special guest, he has priority in choosing his partner."

Nathan stood tall, his commanding presence impossible to ignore. Sophia Laurent, standing beside Evelyn Sinclair, gazed at him with barely contained excitement. She ached to be chosen by him.

After all, very few women could claim any association with Nathan Blackwood. Ever since he presented Sophia with the Most Promising Newcomer Award, people had swarmed her with questions about their connection.

Those who once dismissed her now looked at her with renewed interest.

But Nathan took a deliberate step forward, his gaze locking onto Evelyn with a knowing smile. The outcome was already clear.

Evelyn's brows furrowed as Nathan strode up, pressing the card into her hand and gripping her fingers tightly.

"I choose Evelyn."

His voice echoed through the venue.

Evelyn shot him a glare while the director hurried the others to draw their cards.

Final pairings:

Julian Moreau & Adrian Blackwood
Ethan Caldwell & Sophia Laurent
Evelyn Sinclair & Nathan Blackwood
Adrian nearly collapsed in relief, throwing his arms around Julian and refusing to let go.

"Bro! We finally got paired together!"

He was thanking the heavens he hadn't been stuck with Sophia.

Ethan's expression flickered, but he maintained his composure, accepting the result gracefully.

Sophia, however, was far from pleased. Ethan was a nobody. Even ignoring Nathan, Ethan's fame and status couldn't compare to Adrian's.

She wouldn't get the exposure she wanted with him.

But then again, Evelyn and Ethan had won massive praise in the last episode. Maybe she could make this work.

Sophia forced a sweet smile. "Please take care of me, Ethan."

Ethan nodded politely. "Of course. But your foot has recovered, right?"

Sophia's smile froze.

She said nothing.

The live chat exploded.

[Ethan Caldwell is brutally honest! HAHAHA! "Has your foot recovered?" I can't—]
[I thought Mr. Blackwood came for his nephew. Turns out he's here for Evelyn! His intentions are painfully obvious.]
[Can't exes just be friends? They move in the same circles—of course they have to stay civil.]
[Adrian's smug face is everything! He's my daily dose of serotonin.]
[It's such a shame they divorced. Nathan Blackwood is perfection. Evelyn, don't you dare soften! Even without him, you could have any man in the world!]
###Chapter 338 - Unexpected Collision

Evelyn Sinclair crossed her arms and shot Nathan Blackwood an exasperated glare.

Hah! Mysterious guest? If I'd known Kingsley Tech was backing this show, I wouldn't have invested that hundred million in Julian's project.

What a complete waste!

Nathan smirked and leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I could always have him return your investment."

As if I want your dirty money! Evelyn thought bitterly. When she deliberately turned away, Nathan cleared his throat.

"The production team arranged everything. You wouldn't sabotage the show just because of our... history, would you?"

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over him. "Sorry, Mr. Blackwood, but your charm doesn't work on me anymore." Her lips curled in a mocking smile. "Keep your distance, and don't interfere with my plans to sponsor these promising young talents."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. The muscle in his cheek twitched as he bit back whatever retort he wanted to make.

The director began explaining the game rules - a treasure hunt in an abandoned factory. Much safer than last week's death-defying challenges.

Evelyn smirked. Probably chose this dump to save on location fees.

Nathan looked displeased but couldn't object since the site had been booked months ago. The crew had cleaned the factory, but it remained gloomy and unsettling.

Peeling gray walls. Broken furniture scattered like bones. Tattered curtains fluttering like ghosts. The perfect haunted house setting.

Three floors. Three teams.

Adrian Blackwood and Julian Moreau took the ground floor.

Evelyn and Nathan got the second.

Ethan Caldwell and Sophia Laurent headed for the top.

As they ascended, Sophia clung to Ethan's arm, trembling. "It's terrifying here!" Her wide eyes darted to Evelyn. "Aren't you scared?"

Evelyn shrugged. "There are cameras everywhere. The crew's prepped every inch."

Sophia bit her plump lower lip. "Feels like we're in a horror film. I've been terrified of ghosts since childhood." She tilted her head. "You're so calm. Don't you believe in the supernatural?"

Evelyn's lips quirked. "My father raised me on Enlightenment philosophy. I minored in Marxist theory during my doctorate." She gave Sophia a pitying look. "Ghosts don't exist."

Sophia's face fell. Conversation over.

Nathan watched Evelyn with undisguised admiration. Everything about her fascinated him.

Reaching their floor, Evelyn bounded ahead eagerly.

Then - a shriek.

Sophia "slipped," tumbling backward directly toward Nathan.

"Help!" she wailed.

Nathan's eyes narrowed. If he dodged, she'd crack her skull on the stairs. In a split-second decision, he pivoted and -

Kicked her squarely in the back.

Sophia's graceful backward fall became an undignified faceplant. Her wails of pain echoed through the factory.

She'd hoped for a romantic rescue. Instead, she got a footprint on her designer dress.

Evelyn and Ethan came running at the commotion.

"Are you okay?" Evelyn helped the sniffling actress up.

From below, Adrian's laughter rang out. "Sophia, with all this space, you just had to fall on my uncle? How... convenient."
###Chapter 339 The Jester's Fall

Sophia Laurent's face twisted in humiliation. The moment Adrian Blackwood exposed her scheme, waves of shame crashed over her.

"I—I tripped on my gown!" Sophia stammered.

Adrian drawled, "Oh?" His mocking tone made it clear nobody bought her excuse.

Evelyn Sinclair barely suppressed an eye roll. She just wanted to finish this ridiculous game and escape this circus. "Need to change?" she offered curtly.

Sophia nodded too quickly, scrambling to her feet. Ethan Caldwell smirked. "No twisted ankle requiring my chivalry this time? My back's still recovering from last episode's performance."

Scarlet flooded Sophia's cheeks.

Ethan was throwing her previous staged fall in her face. She glanced desperately at Nathan Blackwood, but his indifference cut deeper than any insult. He'd known. Known she'd thrown herself at him deliberately.

The revulsion in his gaze burned. All her carefully crafted plans had turned her into tonight's laughingstock.

Who could've predicted Nathan would sidestep instead of catching her? That he'd let her tumble up the stairs like discarded trash? Sophia gnawed her lip, forcing a brittle smile. "Just my dress. I'll change." She fled toward her waiting assistant, clutching ruined satin.

Before the game even began, #SophiaFloppedAgain trended worldwide.

[Pathetic!]
[That kick was legendary!]
[Most Promising Neer? More like Most Pathetic Actress!]
[Ethan's savage! "Twisted his back" LOL!]
[Nathan Blackwood's disgust face is my new screensaver]
[Queen Evelyn's expression: "Must I endure this clownery?"]

The live show rolled on without her.

Evelyn turned toward the challenge area—rusty equipment littering tables, three walls lined with potential hiding spots. She didn't rush to search. Instead, she climbed onto a crate, surveying the space with military precision.

Nathan approached, all arrogant charm. "Found anything?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Every interaction with him risked sparking remarriage rumors. She shot him a withering glare. "Do your own reconnaissance. We're not teammates."

She marched toward the nearest cabinet, but Nathan followed like a shadow.

Evelyn whirled around. "Are you illiterate? I said—"

The cameraman nearly dropped his equipment. The director had specifically ordered careful coverage of Nathan Blackwood—PR teams on standby, damage control protocols ready. Yet here were two billionaires bickering like divorced neighbors over a fence.

Compared to the show's usual scripted drama, this raw tension was ratings gold.

Nathan merely smirked and stepped closer. "Make me leave."
###Chapter 340 Her Winning Streak

Nathan Blackwood arched an eyebrow. "I'll search this area too." He made a show of opening a cabinet. Evelyn Sinclair rolled her eyes at him, deliberately ignoring his presence as she continued rifling through the dusty shelves.

From his peripheral vision, Nathan spotted a small, unassuming box perched precariously on top of the cabinet. Evelyn stretched on her tiptoes, fingers just grazing its edge.

The box wobbled dangerously. Before she could steady it, the container tumbled downward. There was no time to react. Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact as her stomach dropped.

This is just perfect! But instead of pain, she felt the cool press of a broad palm against her forehead, shielding her face. The faint scent of sandalwood and citrus enveloped her.

The muffled thud of the box striking Nathan's hand made her flinch, though he didn't so much as twitch. Her heart did a peculiar little flip at the protective gesture.

Nathan withdrew his hand, his deep voice laced with amusement. "Close call." He handed her the offending box. "Though I doubt they'd hide anything important in such an obvious spot."

"Want to check anyway?" Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance before quickly looking away. She pried open the box to reveal... absolutely nothing.

Unfazed, she tossed it onto a nearby table with a careless flick of her wrist and resumed her search. She pointedly didn't thank Nathan, pretending their little moment never happened.

Yet when he continued shadowing her movements, she didn't protest like before. The second floor was dim, but shafts of sunlight through broken windows illuminated Evelyn's silhouette like a spotlight.

Her eyes sparkled with determination. The elegant curve of her profile could make Renaissance sculptors weep. Those full lips, painted a bold crimson today, looked positively sinful.

She was the kind of woman who commanded attention without trying - a natural queen among peasants who had to scream to be noticed. The more you looked, the more breathtaking she became.

Evelyn could feel the weight of Nathan's gaze burning into her back. Every time she turned to confront him, he'd suddenly become very interested in examining floorboards or ceiling beams. The man was terrible at subtlety.

The camera crew kept zooming in on her too, which was beyond irritating! After combing the entire floor without success, Adrian Blackwood bounded up the stairs. "Uncle Nathan! Evie! Let's switch floors. We've found nothing but empty containers."

Evelyn nodded and turned to leave when a flash of color on the opposite wall caught her eye. Nathan followed her gaze, sharp eyes narrowing. "Is that...?"

"A map!" Evelyn's heart leapt as she rushed over to examine it. She turned eagerly to the nearest staff member. "Is this it?" Her voice vibrated with excitement.

The staffer shook his head apologetically. "Sorry, no." Her shoulders slumped. "Should've known it wouldn't be that easy."

Just as she reached the stairwell, Sophia Laurent's triumphant shout echoed from above. "Found it!" All heads snapped upward.

Adrian scoffed until Ethan Caldwell confirmed, "She's right! Director!" The staff immediately herded everyone toward the third floor.

Against all odds, Sophia - who usually struggled with basic social interactions - had actually located the treasure map. Evelyn followed the group upstairs, where Sophia was practically vibrating with excitement as she presented her prize.

"This game is utterly ridiculous," Ethan muttered under his breath.

The director accepted the map with solemn ceremony and declared it authentic. Sophia jumped up and down, beaming. "Finally! My time to shine!" She turned hopeful eyes toward Nathan. "Director, isn't it time for team changes now?" Her desire to partner with Nathan was painfully obvious.

That had been the rule in previous episodes - winners of the first challenge could swap teammates.

The director hesitated, rubbing his chin. Before he could respond, Nathan's icy voice cut through from behind Evelyn. "That rule's been suspended for this episode."
###Chapter 341 Keep the Good Stuff Within the Family

Sophia froze in place, her cheeks burning with humiliation.

Her intentions were painfully obvious to everyone, but Nathan Blackwood had shut her down without hesitation.

The director quickly intervened, rewarding Sophia with the privilege of leading the next challenge.

Online comments exploded with ruthless commentary.

[Did Sophia just get publicly humiliated by Mr. Blackwood?] [This is both tragic and hilarious!] [Everyone's having fun except poor Evelyn - she's the only one taking this treasure hunt seriously!] [Am I imagining things or does Mr. Blackwood look at Evelyn like she's the only woman in the world?]

The group moved to their next destination using Sophia's treasure map. Along the way, Adrian sidled up to Nathan with a smirk.

"Uncle Nate, that was some bold cheating back there," he whispered. "Changing the rules without consulting anyone? Even the director didn't dare object!"

Nathan shot him a sideways glance, his voice crisp and cold. "I could remove you from this show just as easily. Care to test that theory?"

Adrian choked on his laughter, instantly silenced.

He knew better than to doubt his uncle's threats. "You're obsessed with Evelyn, but she's not interested. You're wasting your time!"

Nathan stopped walking abruptly, turning to face his nephew with icy intensity. "And she's not interested in you either, Adrian Blackwood. Stop fantasizing about what you can't have. Consider this your final warning."

The unspoken threat hung heavy between them. Nathan tolerated Adrian because of their family ties, but his patience had limits.

Adrian swallowed hard, suddenly finding it difficult to breathe. His gaze drifted ahead to where Evelyn walked with Ethan, deep in discussion about the upcoming challenge.

The painful truth settled in his chest. Despite everything they'd been through together, Evelyn only saw him as a friend. And now with Nathan in the picture...

Adrian jogged to catch up with his uncle. "You really love her, don't you?"

Nathan gave him a look that suggested the question was idiotic.

Adrian exhaled sharply. "Fine. You're probably the only man worthy of my Evelyn anyway. Since you've changed for the better, I'll help you. Family should keep the good stuff to ourselves, right?"

Nathan ignored Adrian's rambling, his attention fixed on Evelyn's animated conversation with Ethan. He quickened his pace to intercept them.

"Evelyn."

She turned, her smile fading when she saw him. "Problem?"

Nathan's lips curved. "Several, actually."

Ethan took the hint and retreated to join Adrian who had fallen behind. Evelyn inhaled deeply through her nose.

What does he want now?

The next location came into view quickly. The final challenge was an extreme sport - bungee jumping from a hundred-meter cliff, popular among thrill-seekers.

Sophia's face lit up with excitement. Crew members prepared safety harnesses for each participant while the director explained the rules.

"Everyone will board that hot air balloon," he pointed, "for a game of truth. Sophia will determine penalties based on how well each pair performs. One punishment option is an 80-meter bungee jump from this cliff. Those who refuse must accept whatever creative punishment Sophia devises."

This was the advantage of finding the treasure map.

No wonder Sophia looked so pleased with herself!
###Chapter 342 Who Do You Prefer?

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't typically afraid of heights, but the sheer depth of this particular cliff made her pulse quicken involuntarily.

As she approached the hot air balloon basket, her knees trembled visibly.

Aside from professional adventurers like Adrian Blackwood and Ethan Caldwell, most participants shared Evelyn's nervous reaction.

Nathan Blackwood remained stoic, his expression unreadable.

The chasm below appeared bottomless, the dense forest canopy resembling a dark abyss. Floating mid-air felt like standing on shifting clouds—unsteady and precarious.

Thankfully, the safety measures were impeccable.

Otherwise, Evelyn would have refused to participate entirely! She silently vowed to avoid Adrian's extreme adventures in the future. The camera crew remained grounded, relying solely on participants' body cams and drone footage.

Sophia Laurent's pale face and death grip on the railing seemed genuine, though no one could be certain. Her piercing screams momentarily distracted everyone from their own fear.

"Scared?" Nathan's deep voice came from behind her. Evelyn paused mid-step and scoffed. "Not at all!" His quiet chuckle made her shoulders tense.

She wanted to retort when Sophia's whimpering interrupted. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm terrified!" Nathan merely glanced at her indifferently.

Adrian rolled his eyes. "Stop wailing like a wounded banshee! We can't hear ourselves think. Want to dub this entire segment?" Sophia's cries ceased abruptly.

Aside from Julian Moreau, everyone present held significant social status—people Sophia couldn't afford to offend. Tears welled in her eyes as she sniffled, "I just... can't help it."

"If you're truly uncomfortable, request extraction," Ethan suggested kindly. Sophia shook her head. "I'll manage..."

Julian remained silent, gazing at the horizon. The director's voice crackled through the balloon's speakers.

"Sophia, proceed with the questions!" Taking a shaky breath, she stood and produced cue cards.

"First question for Evelyn." She glanced at the safety harness. "You may decline to answer, but refusal requires completing the bungee jump." Clearly a planned challenge. Evelyn smirked. "Fire away."

Sophia read: "If you had to date one of these four men, who would you choose?" The atmosphere turned electric.

The biting wind accentuated the tension. "These questions were provided by production!" Sophia added hastily at Evelyn's darkening expression.

Evelyn's laugh broke the tension. "Julian, obviously." She winked at the young actor beside her—his boyish charm and sincerity made him the safest choice.

Nathan's jaw clenched visibly, his gaze turning glacial. Sophia looked oddly pleased as she pressed, "And your second choice?"

"Ethan." Evelyn offered the stunned explorer an apologetic smile. "Purely hypothetical, of course."

Ethan chuckled awkwardly while Nathan's glare intensified, his displeasure radiating like winter frost.

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "You'd pick Caldwell over me?" He shot Nathan a meaningful look. "Seems Uncle Nathan didn't even make the top three..."
###Chapter 343 A Reckless Descent

Sophia's face froze when Evelyn predicted the third answer flawlessly. Her gaze darted toward Nathan, whose expression had darkened into a thunderous scowl.

His glacial stare pinned Evelyn in place, the intensity barely restrained. Yet Evelyn merely smiled.

"I suppose I don't need to jump then?" Sophia quickly regained her composure. "Moving on—the next question is for Mr. Blackwood." She turned to Nathan with barely concealed excitement.

"If you had to choose one woman here as your girlfriend—" Triumph glittered in Sophia's eyes.

After Evelyn's public humiliation, surely no man would pick her. With only two women present—Evelyn and Sophia—this was her moment to shine.

Before she could finish, Nathan's voice cut through like Arctic wind. "Evelyn." Then, without warning, he yanked Evelyn against his chest and stepped backward off the cliff.

Gasps erupted from the crowd.

"Ahhh!" Evelyn's scream tore through the air as gravity seized them. The world spun violently, her stomach lurching as they plunged toward the abyss.

Nathan's arms locked around her waist like steel bands. Suddenly, his lips crashed against hers—warm, demanding, tasting faintly of mint. All terror dissolved beneath that intoxicating pressure.

Her cries died instantly. The kiss was pure possession, his tongue mapping every inch of her mouth with ruthless precision. Evelyn fisted his shirt, forgetting the safety harness entirely. He was her only anchor in this freefall.

She only reacted when he bit her lower lip—sharp enough to sting.

Evelyn's eyes flew open. The world blurred around them—nothing but rushing wind, the harness digging into her waist, and Nathan's sculpted face inches away. His obsidian eyes held her captive, making her pulse stutter.

The ground raced toward them. Just before impact, their descent jerked to a brutal halt. The rebound wrenched Evelyn's body painfully, but Nathan remained unfazed.

His gaze was an ocean in storm—deceptively calm until you glimpsed the riptides beneath. Evelyn's knuckles whitened on his shoulders, her face bloodless.

She wasn't afraid of heights. But plummeting 100 meters? Every nerve screamed in primal terror.

The harness slackened. They dropped again.

Nathan cradled her head against his chest, his whisper cutting through the howling wind: "You've always been my only choice."
###Chapter 344 Evelyn, Who Do You Choose?

Nathan Blackwood couldn't tell if Evelyn Sinclair had heard him. She remained completely still, giving no reaction. The bungee cord kept bouncing them violently up and down.

Gradually, Evelyn's body adjusted to the motion. Her initial panic began to fade away.

When she finally opened her eyes to look at him, they burned with icy fury instead of fear. After they were pulled back up, Adrian Blackwood and the others rushed over in concern. "Evelyn, are you alright? How do you feel? Any dizziness?" Nathan was ignored off to the side.

Everyone knew Nathan had done this deliberately, so no one comforted him. Evelyn was clearly the victim here! Even Sophia Laurent just stood silently watching the pair.

She couldn't comprehend what had just happened. Evelyn shook her head weakly, her face deathly pale. She couldn't speak yet, only feeling waves of nausea rolling through her.

Her brows furrowed painfully. "Can we be done with this?" Adrian paused, glancing at Nathan's expressionless face - pale but showing no emotion.

For someone with special forces training like Nathan, this extreme sport was child's play, wasn't it? Adrian gently patted Evelyn's back.

"Wait, I just discussed with the director - we're changing the game." His eyes flickered toward Sophia's face. "Let's just vote on who should bungee jump next and get this over with! Forget the truth game!" Sophia's face instantly drained of color.

As she opened her mouth to protest, Ethan Caldwell nodded approvingly. "Great idea. Much better than anonymous voting."

"I vote for Sophia." Ethan was brutally direct, giving her no chance to refuse.

"Straight to the point!" Adrian grinned. "Great minds think alike! My vote's for Sophia too!" With only six people total, two votes were already against her.

Sophia looked desperately at Julian Moreau, who'd won the Most Promising Newcomer Award alongside her. Surely he'd side with her?

Without hesitation, Julian's gaze swept over Evelyn's face. "I also vote for Sophia." Sophia's heart plummeted. Three votes against her already.

She was doomed! No matter who Evelyn or Nathan chose, she was finished! Yet Adrian still turned to Evelyn for her answer.

"Evelyn, who do you choose?" Evelyn still looked unwell. She lowered her lashes briefly before raising them to reveal glacial eyes. "I vote for Nathan Blackwood." Her answer shocked everyone.

Clearly in this situation, Sophia was the obvious target. Among all the Nitra participants, only Evelyn dared vote against Nathan - her silent protest against his cruelty.

Nathan's brows twitched slightly, his eyes darkening momentarily. Then he raised an eyebrow at her, surprisingly showing no trace of guilt.

Adrian tried to diffuse the tension by casually asking Nathan, "Uncle Nathan, who's your pick?" If Nathan had any sense, he'd follow Evelyn's lead and vote for himself.

Maybe that would appease her somewhat. But he didn't. Under everyone's watchful gaze, Nathan lifted his chin and pointed at Sophia.

"Her." Not a single extra word. Sophia's face crumpled. After all her efforts to please him, Nathan was bullying her along with the others.

Ironically, Evelyn - the one Sophia had been targeting - was the only one who hadn't voted against her. Sophia felt tears welling up, standing there looking utterly wronged.

She immediately switched to her pitiful damsel act. "I...I accept this result, but I've had a terrible fear of heights since childhood..."

Surely these grown men wouldn't force a delicate girl like her to jump, right? Adrian laughed darkly.

His lips curled into a reckless smirk as he stepped closer, lowering his voice. "Fear of heights? Then why come on this show? Maybe I should ask your agent what's going on here."

"You signed the contract agreeing to all program requirements..." His smile turned predatory. "I guess you'll just have to pay those breach of contract penalties then."
###Chapter 345 Please Stay the Hell Away From Me

Sophia Laurent's eyes widened in shock as she stared up at Adrian Blackwood. His expression was deadly serious, not a trace of amusement in his piercing gaze. He stepped aside wordlessly, granting her passage.

The contract terms flashed through her mind. She knew she couldn't back out now. No one would believe her pathetic acting anymore.

It was painfully obvious to everyone how Sophia had manipulated the show's direction to target Evelyn Sinclair specifically.

Biting her lower lip until it nearly bled, Sophia cast one last desperate glance at the stone-faced Nathan Blackwood. His attention remained fixed elsewhere, never once acknowledging her presence.

With hesitant steps, Sophia moved toward the edge, each footfall heavier than the last. She kept looking back, silently begging for someone - anyone - to stop her.

Her final pleading gaze landed on Evelyn, who stood gripping the railing with pale knuckles. Evelyn's eyes were closed, one hand pressed against her chest, clearly struggling with her own discomfort. She showed no concern whatsoever about Sophia's impending jump.

A strangled sob escaped Sophia's throat as she finally took the plunge.

Her blood-curdling scream shattered the mountain's tranquility, echoing endlessly through the valley. The live audience erupted in commentary.

(They should've had Mr. Blackwood push her! That would've been priceless!)
(Coming in fourth really bruised his ego, huh? Serves him right!)
(Didn't Sophia brag about being an extreme sports enthusiast in episode one? Now she's scared of heights? What a fraud!)
(My heart breaks for Evelyn - she told the truth and still got dragged into this mess!)
(Mr. Blackwood clearly regrets that divorce. He hasn't taken his eyes off Evelyn since they arrived!)

Nathan noticed Evelyn's worsening pallor and immediately summoned assistance. As others rushed to her side, he lingered behind, watching her every move with hawk-like intensity.

When Evelyn stumbled slightly, a flicker of remorse crossed Nathan's features. He reached out instinctively, but Evelyn sidestepped his touch with surprising agility.

Her crimson-rimmed eyes burned into his with unprecedented fury. "Stay the hell away from me." The venom in her voice was new - a stark departure from her usual polite indifference.

This reaction cut deeper than Nathan expected. Regret pooled in his gut, but he knew any apology would only earn him further scorn. Evelyn would never believe his sincerity now.

Pressing his lips into a thin line, Nathan fell into step behind her. "Are you angry?"

"What gave it away?" Evelyn snapped. "I just needed to cool off, that's all. Don't worry your pretty little head about me."

The weak excuse hung awkwardly between them. Evelyn suddenly whirled around, her glare sharp enough to draw blood. "Let me guess - you wanted me to jump too, didn't you? You bastard! Taking your petty anger out on me like some spoiled child!"

Nathan's eyebrows arched, though Evelyn couldn't see the expression beneath his dark sunglasses. Truthfully, he'd only wanted her attention for a few more seconds. Being her fourth choice stung, but her complete indifference hurt far worse.

"Of course not," he lied smoothly.

"Bullshit," Evelyn spat. Neither mentioned the accidental kiss during their tandem fall - an unspoken agreement to ignore what couldn't be taken back.

As Evelyn turned to leave, her legs suddenly buckled. White spots danced across her vision as the world tilted dangerously.

She collapsed without warning.

Nathan lunged forward, catching her limp form effortlessly. Panic creased his forehead as he assessed her condition. Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms and sprinted toward the waiting vehicles.

Evelyn's assistant Gabrielle and the driver stood ready by the car. Their faces drained of color at the sight of their unconscious boss in Nathan's arms.
###Chapter 346 The Weight of My Mistake

The sharp scent of antiseptic assaulted Evelyn's senses as she regained consciousness.

White ceiling tiles came into focus above her.

She was in a hospital room.

A shuddering breath escaped her lips. Fragments of her nightmare still clung to her - the terrifying sensation of free-falling, the bungee cord snapping taut, then plunging downward again in endless cycles.

Her body still trembled with phantom adrenaline when a warm cloth gently dabbed her forehead.

Evelyn turned her head.

The sight of Nathan Blackwood sitting beside her bed made her expression darken immediately.

"Why are you still here?" Her voice came out hoarse.

Nathan's shoulders slumped. "I... I couldn't leave." His usually deep voice sounded raw with guilt. "This is all my fault."

Even unconscious, Evelyn had been restless - sweating, twitching, murmuring pleas of "Don't push me" in her feverish state.

The memory made Nathan's gut twist. He'd never imagined his impulsive stunt would terrify her so profoundly. If he could turn back time...

He'd jump off that platform a hundred times alone rather than drag her into his reckless moment.

Evelyn turned her face away, rejecting his ministrations. She opened her mouth to demand he leave when Gabrielle and her driver arrived.

"Ms. Sinclair! You're awake!" Gabrielle carried a thermos, swiftly pouring steaming liquid into a cup. "Nerve-calming herbal tea. Doctor's orders."

Evelyn accepted the cup, inhaling the soothing aroma.

Her stomach growled audibly.

She took several careful sips before setting it down. Nathan immediately reached for the cup, but Gabrielle intercepted smoothly.

"Mr. Blackwood, please allow me." The assistant couldn't fathom her boss's ex-husband doing menial tasks.

Evelyn shot Nathan a withering look. "Don't you have companies to run? A city to conquer? Why linger here?"

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"I won't disturb you."

"You're disturbing me by existing in this room," Evelyn retorted without mercy.

After a heavy silence, Nathan stood and left. Gabrielle sighed at Evelyn's stormy expression. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps go easier on him?"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

"Mr. Blackwood carried you down the entire mountainside to get help," Gabrielle explained. "The ambulance had equipment failure and a flat tire. He ran nearly two miles with you in his arms."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the bedsheet.

"And when you were unconscious..." Gabrielle hesitated. "You clung to him desperately. Wouldn't let go of his sleeve. Every time he tried to move away, you'd become agitated. He stayed all night."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks.

Damn her subconscious betraying her like this!

"The recording?" Evelyn changed subjects abruptly. "The show?"

Gabrielle nodded. "Wrapped successfully. Everyone's returned to the city. We can leave whenever you're discharged."

Good. At least she hadn't humiliated herself on camera.

Noticing Evelyn's pallor, Gabrielle urged her to rest. Though eager to leave, exhaustion pulled Evelyn under before she could protest.

When she awoke again, moonlight painted silver stripes across the hospital floor.

Gabrielle had dimmed the lights and closed the door, but left the curtains open. The world outside glowed with streetlamps.

The ward's excellent soundproofing created an eerie stillness - so quiet Evelyn could hear the faint hum of medical equipment.

She savored the peaceful isolation.

Sliding from bed, Evelyn padded toward the door, only to freeze at the voices outside.

"Mr. Blackwood, you haven't eaten all day." Gabrielle's concerned tone. "At least go inside to rest properly."

"No need." Nathan's distinctive baritone held its usual icy distance when addressing anyone but Evelyn.

Her hand hovered over the door handle.

After a heartbeat's hesitation, Evelyn turned the knob and stepped into the hallway.
###Chapter 347 She's Getting Back to Her Career

Evelyn Sinclair straightened her shoulders and announced, "Prepare the car. I'm going home."

Gabrielle blinked in surprise before nodding swiftly. "Right away. The driver is already waiting outside."

Nathan Blackwood rose from his seat, his piercing gaze lingering on Evelyn for a long moment. "Are you feeling better?"

Evelyn hesitated briefly. "Yes."

The softness in her voice caught him off guard. His stern expression melted into something warmer, almost tender. He had been so worried she might break—but he had forgotten. Evelyn Sinclair wasn't made of glass.

Only she could throw a tantrum like that and still walk away unscathed.

Nathan wanted to escort her back personally, but before he could step out, his phone buzzed urgently. Harrison’s voice crackled through the line, tense and rushed. With a reluctant sigh, Nathan bid Evelyn a quick goodbye and left.

The ride home was quiet. Evelyn stared out the window, her phone lighting up incessantly with notifications.

Adrian Blackwood had been the most persistent.

Ninety-nine unread messages from him alone. She didn’t bother opening them.

Instead, she lifted her phone and snapped a careless shot of the city skyline—blurred streetlights, smeared neon, the hazy glow of traffic.

She posted it with a simple caption: Beautiful night. I’m doing well.

Within seconds, her notifications exploded.

Adrian Blackwood: You post a pic but ignore my texts???

Ethan Caldwell: Photography skills: -10/10.

Julian Moreau: Get well soon!

Sebastian Hart: Send me your location.

She skimmed through the replies, responding to a few before a new comment caught her eye.

Harrison: Relaying a message: Beautiful shot. Professionals truly operate on another level.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. Of course. Harrison was just the messenger.

Was that supposed to be a compliment? Or was Nathan Blackwood mocking her?

Stupid man.

Back at Sterling Manor, Evelyn took a few days to rest.

Isabella Montgomery dragged her out—shopping, dining, arcade games—anything to bring back her usual spark.

Then, the variety show episode aired.

Evelyn never cared for live broadcasts, but she loved watching the edited versions. There was something thrilling about seeing the polished final product.

She watched the fifteen-minute clip with keen interest.

The editors had done an impressive job. They’d focused on Nathan’s guest appearance, carefully omitting Sophia Laurent’s drama, making the entire cast seem harmonious.

The comment section, however, was another story.

The internet had collectively decided that Nathan Blackwood had only appeared on the show for one reason: Evelyn.

Why else would a man who turned down every financial talk show suddenly show up on an adventure program?

Mr. Blackwood is in love with our queen, isn’t he?

This feels like an episode of "How to Win Your Ex-Wife Back (And Fail Spectacularly)."

Adrian doesn’t stand a chance now.

Evelyn, don’t waver! Julian is still the best choice!

The comments ranged from supportive to absurd. Some urged her to stay strong, warning her not to fall for Nathan’s charms again. Others begged her to forgive him, insisting he’d changed.

Do they think I’m an idiot?

She tossed her phone aside in frustration.

Days later, Adrian pitched the idea of a third episode.

Evelyn refused immediately. She had no interest in returning—especially now that she knew Nathan was the show’s primary sponsor.

Adrian reluctantly accepted her decision.

News of her withdrawal spread like wildfire.

The internet erupted.

This show is nothing without Evelyn! I only watched for her and Sophia’s hilarious cluelessness!

Evelyn, please reconsider and debut properly! You’re more entertaining than half the actresses out there!

Are you quitting because of Nathan Blackwood?

Speculation ran rampant. Her social media was flooded daily with questions about her relationship with Nathan.

Sterling Corporation finally stepped in with an official announcement:

Effective immediately, Evelyn Sinclair has resumed her position at Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn reposted it with her own message:

Time to get back to work.
###Chapter 348 Someone Will Always Think About It

Evelyn's statement temporarily silenced the public's demands for her return to the show.

As the CEO of Sterling Corporation, she didn't need the entertainment industry to sustain her livelihood. That alone gave her every right to make that choice.

The frenzy died down quickly. Evelyn thought this would be the perfect excuse to step away for good—until the next morning, when Leo abruptly switched the room to daylight mode before she even woke up.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains, warming her face as she blinked awake.

She stretched lazily and poked the AI tiger. "You got the timing wrong. It's not time yet."

Leo nuzzled her forehead insistently.

"Someone's waiting for you! No more sleeping in!"

Groaning, Evelyn dragged herself up, her drowsiness fading. Twenty minutes later, she emerged refreshed.

She slipped into a luxurious Elie Saab casual dress—a soft beige knee-length piece that radiated elegance and youth.

Alexander Sterling had already checked his watch a dozen times by the time she descended the stairs. The moment she appeared, he pulled her toward the door.

"You're needed at the office today. Everyone's waiting."

Evelyn stared at him, bewildered. "Today? Since when was this decided?"

Alexander exhaled sharply. "It's the shareholders' meeting. Some have been eyeing your position for months. You showing up will shut them down."

Understanding dawned. "Ah. So that's what this is about."

Sterling Corporation.

The top-floor conference room was tense, every attendee sitting stiffly in the heavy silence.

Evelyn had faced this kind of atmosphere before. She was unfazed.

When she entered with Alexander, the room erupted in a mix of reactions—some gazes calculating, others relieved, a few indifferent.

Applause broke out as she stepped inside.

This was her first official meeting since her return.

Some faces were familiar. Others, not so much.

"Welcome back, President Evelyn."

She smiled politely and took her seat beside Alexander. The meeting began.

In business settings, Alexander mirrored Nathan Blackwood's demeanor—cold, unreadable, never smiling.

As directors and shareholders presented their arguments, his expression remained icy, detached.

Evelyn quickly grasped the situation.

A Wall Street magnate from Liberty, Preston Sinclair, had proposed a groundbreaking AI project.

Sinclair was an enigma—his name never appeared on Forbes' lists, yet his influence in the business world was undeniable.

AI development was booming globally, with nations and corporations fiercely competing for dominance. But no one had successfully integrated these advancements into a cohesive system.

Research, medicine, smart devices—each field excelled independently, but no single company had bridged them all.

Preston Sinclair wanted to change that.

He sought to unite the industry's top players and create the century's leading AI conglomerate.

Smaller firms had no place in this vision. Only those at the pinnacle of the pyramid stood a chance.

Sterling Corporation had reached out multiple times—with no response.

Then Lawrence Whitmore, one of their shareholders, saw an opportunity.

He wanted his son, Damian Whitmore, to lead this collaboration—a move that sparked immediate backlash.

"How can you hand such a critical deal to your son as a training exercise?" someone snapped. "Are you losing your judgment?"

Even if Sterling secures this deal, it'll be because of our reputation—not Damian's competence."

"Trying to claim credit already? Bold."

"Damian is a department manager. He's capable enough—"

The debate raged on.
###Chapter 349 A Gamble Worth Taking

The boardroom crackled with tension. Divided opinions hung thick in the air like storm clouds. Some voiced agreement, some opposition, while others merely observed the unfolding drama.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Alexander Sterling's impassive face. His sharp eyes were half-lidded, his expression glacial as if the heated debate meant nothing to him. Bennett noticed this and cleared his throat pointedly.

The room fell silent instantly, all eyes turning to gauge Alexander's reaction. His frosty gaze swept across Lawrence Whitmore, voice dripping with icy precision.

"Mr. Whitmore, is your desperation for your son's advancement truly this transparent?"

Lawrence swallowed hard. Normally timid, he'd mustered courage for this moment, knowing Damian's position at Sterling Corporation hung by a thread without notable achievements.

"President Sterling, Damian's accomplishments in the business division speak for themselves. I have every confidence he can lead this initiative."

Alexander's lips curved into something resembling a smile, though his eyes remained arctic.

"And if he fails?" The question froze the room. The silence became oppressive.

Lawrence's face stiffened. His fingers twitched against the polished mahogany table. "If he can't—"

Alexander cut him off, voice like shattering glass. "This isn't just any project. It's Sterling Corporation's crown jewel."

"Years of strategic planning rest on its success. Failure wouldn't merely tarnish our reputation—it would cripple future ventures." His piercing stare pinned Lawrence in place. "Does your son possess the competence for such responsibility?"

"And if our competitors secure what we lose?" Alexander leaned forward slightly. "Who shoulders that catastrophe? Did you imagine consequences could be swept aside so easily?"

The air grew heavier. Even breathing seemed too loud. Should Kensington Group claim this deal, Sterling Corporation's standing would plummet, triggering a domino effect of lost partnerships.

The entire company's trajectory could shift into decline. Could Lawrence Whitmore possibly bear that weight? His complexion turned ashen.

He'd assumed Alexander might show leniency given his decades of service.

But the CEO had laid bare the stakes. All eyes burned into Lawrence now. Would he retreat or double down? The clock ticked audibly.

Evelyn checked her watch discreetly, mentally calculating how soon she could escape for her spa appointment.

"I'll stake everything on it!" Lawrence's sudden declaration cut through the tension, his voice rough with conviction. "Damian won't fail. But if he does, I'll surrender all my shares and resign immediately."

Gasps rippled through the room. As Sterling Corporation's second-largest shareholder, Lawrence's influence rivaled William Sterling's. His reputation among investors was impeccable.

And he was gambling it all? Evelyn studied him curiously. Determination etched deep lines into his face, but what fueled such blind faith?

Alexander's mouth quirked.

"Not enough." His fingers steepled. "Should Damian fail, he'll be barred from any Sterling affiliate—globally—in perpetuity."

Lawrence's eyelids flickered. Then, jaw clenched: "Agreed."

Alexander's gaze shifted to Evelyn. "We'll hedge our bets with dual leadership. Evelyn, you'll co-lead this project. Consider it... professional cross-training."

Evelyn's manicured nails stilled against her tablet. Her head snapped up. Why was she being dragged into this mess?

Lawrence scowled at her before turning back to Alexander. "How do we determine victory?" His finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "If she loses, does she walk away too?"

Alexander's glare could have flash-frozen the Mediterranean.

Before he could respond, Evelyn straightened her blazer and smiled sweetly. "Naturally. May the best executive win."
###Chapter 350 Not Good Enough for Me

Lawrence Whitmore's lips curled into a smirk, his eyes gleaming with reckless confidence.

"Perfect! It's settled then." The meeting concluded abruptly. As the room emptied, only Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander Sterling remained.

Alexander rubbed his temples in frustration. "I never intended for you to make that wager with him!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "We're past that point now, aren't we? Besides, you're the one who dragged me into this mess." Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "His son's a complete disgrace - we can't possibly rely on him just because of some bet."

"I involved you because I genuinely need your expertise on this project." Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Tell me, why do you despise Lawrence Whitmore's son so much?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "That spoiled brat seduced one of our junior executives and caused a massive scandal. Our company nearly trended for all the wrong reasons because of him." He clenched his fists. "Do you have any idea how much damage control that cost me? And the idiot still doesn't understand what he did wrong - now he's harassing someone in our finance department."

"Lawrence kept covering for him, making everything worse." Evelyn's smile vanished. "So he's that kind of scumbag? Serves him right then."

Evelyn studied Bennett intently. "Do we have the Wall Street investor's profile?" Bennett nodded and handed her a file.

Her smile froze when she opened it. "This is blank!" Alexander coughed awkwardly and made a hasty exit. "We've hit a dead end."

"Probably using a pseudonym too," Bennett added. "You'll need to dig deeper." Evelyn groaned internally.

Did I just walk into a trap? Bennett chuckled beside her. "Just say the word if you need backup, Ms. Sinclair." Evelyn fixed him with a piercing gaze.

"Why is Lawrence so confident about securing this project? He's betting everything on it." She tapped the empty file. "There must be something we're missing."

Bennett shook his head helplessly. "No leads yet. I'll investigate immediately." Evelyn's curiosity burned. Who is this mystery player?

Her phone buzzed - Adrian Blackwood calling. "What's up, Addy?"

"Nikki, we're celebrating at the Phantom Lounge tonight. You in?" Just as Evelyn was about to accept, a thought struck her - Nathan Blackwood would likely attend as the main sponsor.

Adrian sensed her hesitation. "Relax, Uncle Nathan won't be there. He's throwing Gregory Thornton a bachelor party - apparently the girl's pregnant and they're having a shotgun wedding!" His laughter echoed through the phone.

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle. "Count me in!" Hanging up, she immediately dialed Isabella Montgomery. "Did your mother finally give up on that arranged marriage with Gregory?"

Isabella snorted. "He's beneath me! Ever since you helped me get those photos, Mother's been reconsidering. Now the Thorntons have their own drama to deal with."

Evelyn grinned. "I heard he fell for some penniless girl and disgraced his family. Who knows what's true?"

Isabella exhaled in relief. "Divine intervention! No wonder they've been so secretive. Now I can finally breathe." Her voice turned playful. "Actually, I've met someone... but I'll tell you later. Mother's checking on me!" The line went dead.

Evelyn laughed as she prepared for the evening. The project could wait until Bennett uncovered Lawrence's secret advantage. For now, she had a celebration to attend.
###Chapter 351 No Need to Swear on It

The city sparkled like a jewel box at night.

Phantom Lounge pulsed with energy and laughter.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of her car with effortless grace. Her casual ensemble - an oversized designer tee paired with a micro mini - accentuated her mile-long legs. Heads turned as she moved through the crowd.

Inside the VIP section, Adrian Blackwood was spraying Dom Pérignon like a firehose while chasing Ethan Caldwell around the room. The scene was chaotic yet festive.

Julian Moreau sat conversing with the director, looking relaxed in his tailored suit. His face lit up when he spotted Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair! You made it!"

The director and others greeted her warmly. Several unfamiliar faces - likely Adrian's fellow adventurers - nodded in acknowledgment.

Sophia Laurent sat isolated in a shadowy corner.

Her sequined gown and full glam makeup seemed better suited for a red carpet than a casual celebration.

No one paid her any attention.

After the bungee jumping incident where the audience voted her off the platform, Sophia finally understood her unpopularity.

She regretted her blatant targeting of Evelyn during filming. When she'd climbed back up, trembling from the jump, the crew had simply packed up without checking on her.

Sophia only attended this wrap party to secure her spot in the next season.

Though her reputation had taken hits and she'd lost endorsements, she remained relevant. Missing this show would be career suicide!

Watching Evelyn's effortless popularity made Sophia's chest tighten with envy. "It's just her family's money," she muttered.

When Ethan stepped out to take a call, Adrian dragged Evelyn aside. "Ethan says he's skipping next season. Wants to track elephant migrations in Botswana."

Evelyn glanced at the brooding explorer nursing his drink alone. She gave an approving thumbs-up. "Danger magnet as always."

Ethan rolled his eyes and stalked out.

"Drink?" Adrian asked. Evelyn considered. "A bottle of Château d'Yquem '45, please." She'd been craving its honeyed notes.

Adrian's smile faltered. "Trying to bankrupt me?"

"Oh right." Evelyn chuckled. "Forgot about your trust fund restrictions. My treat tonight. Order whatever you like."

Adrian exhaled in relief. "Thank God I got over my crush on you. The humiliation would've killed me." He grinned. "One bottle enough?"

Laughter and clinking glasses filled the air until Ethan burst back in, face stormy. He grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"I need your help."

Before she could protest, he'd pulled her into the hallway.

"What's wrong?"

Ethan leaned against the floor-to-ceiling windows, jaw working. His usual confidence had evaporated.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Spit it out or I'm going back."

"Will you be my girlfriend?"

Her eyebrows shot up. Ethan quickly amended, "Fake girlfriend."

Suspicion darkened her features. "What's your game?"

Ethan's gaze remained startlingly clear. "Want me to swear on my mother's grave?"

Her stance softened slightly. "Why the charade?"

Ethan's knuckles whitened on the windowsill. "I just saw my dead ex."

"The one who drained your accounts?"

His face flushed crimson. "That bastard Adrian told you?"

"Who else?" Evelyn smirked, unrepentant.

Ethan shook his head - revenge took priority over settling scores with Adrian.

"She's here for her bachelorette party. I need to... congratulate her."

Evelyn studied his murderous expression. "Do you though?"

The words exploded from him. "She cheated with my business partner! Stole my money to buy him watches! When I confronted her, she wiped out my accounts!"

The veins in his neck stood out like cables. Evelyn had never seen the unflappable explorer so unraveled.

"Fine," she sighed. "But you're buying me another bottle of that Sauternes."

Ethan's grin was all sharp edges. "Deal."
###Chapter 352 Stay and Sit

Ethan Caldwell was fuming, his anger so palpable it felt like steam was rising from his head.

How utterly pathetic!

Evelyn Sinclair pressed her lips together, casting a sympathetic glance at Ethan. "Then we should congratulate her properly."

After all, this was just a small favor—nothing more, nothing less.

"But...am I really the right person for this?"

Ethan gave her a once-over. "You're filthy rich."

That alone would be enough to drive that woman insane.

Evelyn smirked. "Hah. What a compelling reason."

Without warning, Ethan grabbed Evelyn's hand and pulled her down the long corridor, stopping outside a private room not far from theirs.

The door was slightly ajar, allowing the sounds of laughter and music to spill out.

"Mel, you're the first one in our group to get married! How did you manage to wrap Gregory Thornton around your finger like this?"

"Girls, you don’t know yet—Mel’s already pregnant! If they don’t hurry up with the wedding, she won’t fit into her dress..."

"Seriously?! Double congratulations!"

"Make sure you keep a tight grip on his wallet!"

Evelyn felt her eyelid twitch. She turned to Ethan, whose expression looked like he’d just swallowed something vile.

She bit her lip. "Should we still go in?"

Ethan scoffed. "Absolutely."

With that, he pushed the door open, his face instantly transforming into a charming, playful smile. His other hand rested lightly on Evelyn’s shoulder, the picture of a perfect gentleman.

They looked very cozy.

Evelyn played along perfectly, gasping softly. "Oh no! We must have the wrong room!"

Her voice was sweet and melodic, devoid of any coldness, effortlessly drawing every eye in the room.

Ethan paused, feigning surprise as he scanned the crowd. His gaze landed on Melanie, who was surrounded by admirers. A flicker of dark amusement flashed in his eyes.

"What a coincidence! Isn’t this an old friend?"

The way he said "old friend" was laced with venom.

Melanie, dressed to impress, had been basking in the envy and praise of her friends.

Women like her were a dime a dozen around wealthy men like Gregory Thornton, but few ever climbed to the top.

She was about to be one of them.

Melanie had been floating on cloud nine—until she saw Ethan Caldwell.

Her blood ran cold.

Gregory knew nothing about her past. None of them did.

A few of her friends recognized Evelyn and Ethan from their appearances on a popular reality show.

"Ms. Sinclair! What a surprise! Mr. Caldwell, you know Melanie?"

Ethan’s smile turned sly. "Oh, we know each other very well..."

Melanie’s face stiffened, her heart freezing in her chest.

Evelyn smiled. The woman who had spoken looked vaguely familiar—probably someone she’d seen at a party or event before, judging by her designer outfit.

"Yes, what’s the occasion?"

"It’s Melanie’s bachelorette party before she marries Gregory Thornton! Since you’re here, why don’t you join us?"

Having Evelyn at their party would be a major social coup.

Evelyn studied Melanie—plain, unremarkable, the kind of face you’d forget in a crowd.

She smiled sweetly, tugging at Ethan’s sleeve with playful affection. Her voice was soft, almost teasing.

"Let’s stay for a bit! It looks fun..."

Ethan gazed at her with exaggerated fondness. "Whatever you want, darling."

The room erupted in silent shock.

Their interaction was far from platonic.

A few people exchanged glances, their expressions shifting. Someone couldn’t resist asking, "Wait—are you two together now?"

###Chapter 353 The Wealthy Woman He's With

Evelyn smiled and slipped her arm through Ethan's, deliberately avoiding answering the question.

Her silence spoke volumes to everyone present.

The way Ethan's hand rested possessively on her shoulder told them everything they needed to know.

No man touched a woman like that unless they were involved.

The private room fell into an uneasy hush.

Sophia's face twisted in fury. She suddenly lifted a trembling finger, pointing accusingly at Evelyn.

Her voice was laced with venom.

"So, this is the rich woman you've been cozying up to?"

The moment those cutting words left her lips, the excited chatter among the women died instantly. It was too late to stop Sophia now.

Sophia knew Ethan wouldn't let her off easily. The simmering rage in his eyes had been there since the moment he spotted her.

She needed to wound him first—to humiliate him before he could strike back.

"Are you really so desperate that you'd sell yourself like this?"

All eyes darted to Evelyn, waiting for her reaction.

Evelyn kept her smile perfectly in place. She was just here to play her part. Ethan would handle the rest.

"Sophia, how could you say that about Ms. Sinclair's companion?"

One of Sophia's friends panicked, discreetly tugging at her sleeve. She shot a nervous glance at Evelyn, silently warning Sophia to watch her words.

Especially since that companion was Evelyn Sinclair.

Sophia paled as realization struck. In her desperation to humiliate Ethan, she'd forgotten who she was dealing with.

Just as she opened her mouth to backtrack, Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"I'm desperate? At least I'm not the one marrying a man while carrying another's child."

The tension in the room thickened. Confused whispers spread as the guests tried to piece together the history between Ethan and Sophia.

Sophia's breath hitched.

If Ethan and Evelyn were together, why wasn’t he afraid of her finding out about their past?

Her eyes flickered with calculation, but Ethan didn’t give her a chance to speak.

"I heard congratulations are in order. A wedding tomorrow, isn’t it?"

His tone was deceptively light, but his gaze was lethal.

"But before you walk down the aisle, how about returning what you owe me? My girlfriend doesn’t like my money being in another woman’s hands."

Sophia’s face drained of color. The guests exchanged uneasy glances, sensing this was far more complicated than a simple lovers' quarrel.

Evelyn smirked, then deliberately turned to Sophia with feigned curiosity.

"Why is your money with her, Ethan?"

Before Ethan could respond, a cold voice cut through the room.

"Evelyn, did you bring someone here to cause trouble?"

Gregory Thornton stood in the doorway, his expression dark with restrained fury. If not for Evelyn’s connections, he would’ve had her thrown out immediately.

Behind him stood Tristan Whitmore and Nathan Blackwood.

Evelyn’s breath caught at the sight of Nathan.

His face was like a storm, his eyes dark and turbulent. Emotions raged beneath the surface, barely contained.

Had he heard everything?

For a brief moment, Evelyn faltered—then she schooled her expression into indifference.

She met Gregory’s glare.

"Trouble? We’re just old friends catching up."

She had never liked Gregory. If this ruined his precious wedding, so be it.

As for Nathan? She refused to acknowledge him.

Gregory’s sharp gaze flicked to Ethan.

"Old friends? Doesn’t look like it."

Sophia seized the opportunity, rushing to Gregory’s side with a pitiful whimper.

"Gregory, I didn’t mean to offend Ms. Sinclair or Mr. Caldwell. I just spoke without thinking..."
###Chapter 354 Spending to Get Closer to You

Evelyn Sinclair arched a delicate brow, her lips curling into a knowing smirk as she glanced at Ethan Caldwell.

"We didn’t come here to ruin your bachelor party," she said smoothly. "We’ll leave as soon as he gets what’s owed to him."

Ethan let out a low chuckle, but before he could respond, Celeste Rousseau cut in, her voice trembling with suppressed fury.

"Mr. Caldwell," she hissed, "whatever disagreements we had in the past, this is my engagement celebration. My fiancé is Gregory Thornton, heir to the Thornton Group. His friends are all influential figures. Do you really think you can afford to make enemies here?"

The thinly veiled threat hung in the air—a warning that Ethan was out of his depth.

Evelyn’s amusement deepened. So, the docile facade had cracks after all.

Even Gregory seemed taken aback by Celeste’s sudden aggression. She had always played the sweet, demure fiancée.

The room fell silent.

Someone had even cut the music.

Ethan, however, remained unfazed. If anything, his smirk only grew more pronounced.

"Threatening me?" He scoffed. "You always thought I was just some broke explorer, didn’t you? That’s why you stole my money and ran off to latch onto a trust-fund baby?"

"Shut up!"

"What?"

Celeste and Gregory spoke at the same time—one in panic, the other in stunned disbelief.

Celeste clutched Gregory’s arm desperately. "Gregory, don’t listen to him! He’s lying! I don’t even know him! After everything we’ve been through, you trust me, don’t you?"

Gregory’s tense expression softened slightly, swayed by her pleading.

But Ethan’s laughter turned sharp, edged with bitterness.

"Mr. Thornton, take my advice—don’t be as gullible as I was. If you believe her, you’re just the next fool in line."

Gregory’s face darkened.

On one side stood Celeste, the woman he’d painstakingly wooed.

On the other stood Ethan Caldwell, standing beside Evelyn Sinclair.

Logic told him not to trust anyone associated with Evelyn. But instinct whispered that something was off.

Gregory gave Celeste’s hand a reassuring squeeze before fixing Ethan with a cold glare.

"You’d better have proof for what you’re accusing her of. If this is slander, I won’t let it slide—no matter who’s backing you."

His gaze flickered briefly to Evelyn, a silent warning.

Ethan didn’t flinch.

"That tie clip she gave you? The $60,000 one?" He smirked. "She bought it with my money—before we even broke up. Did she tell you she worked hard for it? Studied late nights?" His tone was flat, matter-of-fact.

Gregory stiffened.

Because that was exactly what Celeste had claimed.

Celeste paled. "Gregory, don’t—"

Evelyn’s cool voice cut through the tension. "What’s wrong? Too guilty to let him hear the rest?"

Celeste’s breath hitched. When she met Evelyn’s gaze, it felt like staring into a blade—sharp, unrelenting.

She looked away instantly.

Ethan continued, unfazed. "Don’t take my word for it, Mr. Thornton. Check the records. Every gift—scarves, watches, even that ridiculous gold-plated mug—came from my account. While I was on assignment, she drained $300,000 from my card. Thought that was all I had. Took the money and left."

A beat of silence.

Then—

"Celeste," Gregory said slowly, his voice dangerously calm. "Is this true?"
###Chapter 355 You're Not a Poor Man

Ethan Caldwell's piercing gaze locked onto Celeste Rousseau, the woman who had once played him for a fool. Back then, he had genuinely believed he was at fault and had rushed to apologize like a lovesick puppy.

But what had he found instead?

Celeste and Gregory Thornton, flirting shamelessly as they strolled out of a hotel suite, fingers intertwined. The familiarity between them made it painfully obvious—this wasn’t their first rendezvous.

Later, when Ethan had tried to confront her, Celeste had vanished without a trace, transferring colleges like a ghost in the night.

She had ghosted him.

To Ethan, Celeste Rousseau was dead.

A permanent stain on his pride.

Now, the crowd’s shocked eyes darted between Celeste and Ethan, absorbing the explosive drama unfolding on the eve of Celeste and Gregory’s wedding.

This was scandalous.

Gregory’s fists clenched, his knuckles turning white. A chilling darkness flickered in his eyes, his entire body rigid with tension. No one could guess what storm brewed beneath his carefully controlled exterior.

Celeste clutched his arm desperately. "Gregory, I swear, I never lied to you! I love you—only you!"

Gregory remained stone-faced, his expression colder than ice.

Panicked, Celeste whirled on Ethan.

"It was just a few hundred thousand dollars! Are you really so petty that you’d ruin my happiness over money? What, did you expect me to pay you emotional damages after we broke up?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The sheer audacity!

Eyes wide with disbelief, the guests watched as Celeste trembled with rage, jabbing a finger at Ethan. "You wanted to marry me back then? With what money? Did you expect me to live like a pauper?" She scoffed, her gaze flickering to Evelyn Sinclair. "And look at you now—leeching off some rich woman. How are you any better than me?"

Evelyn smirked, her sharp eyes glinting. "So you cheated and dumped Ethan because Gregory was richer? Is that what you call a 'normal' choice?"

Celeste’s face paled the moment the words left her mouth.

She turned stiffly toward Gregory, whose expression had darkened into something terrifying. The warmth he usually reserved for her had vanished, replaced by something far more dangerous.

Gregory Thornton was not a gentle man by nature. Celeste’s supposed sweetness had softened him, made him believe in love.

But it had all been a lie.

The air thickened with tension. The soon-to-be Mrs. Thornton was nothing but a gold-digging fraud.

Ethan exhaled, a weight lifting from his chest.

No matter how well Celeste had played her role, the truth always surfaced. And tonight, it had come crashing down spectacularly.

Her frantic, unraveling expression was almost pitiful. Ethan chuckled, a lightness in his voice.

"Well, I suppose I was just unlucky. Consider that money charity—feeding a stray, if you will." He tilted his head, feigning thought. "Oh, and congratulations on the pregnancy. A shotgun wedding? Bold move. No wonder you outmaneuvered all those other socialites."

The implication was clear.

Celeste’s pregnancy had been a calculated play.

Her face twisted in fury. Gregory stiffened, realization dawning.

The woman he thought carried his child had trapped him.

Gregory’s jaw tightened, his glare shifting between Celeste and Ethan. "Are you done?" he ground out, voice laced with barely restrained fury.

Ethan smirked, draping an arm around Evelyn’s shoulders.

With a mock bow, he said, "Forgive the interruption. We wouldn’t want to spoil the festivities. Happy wedding!"

The crowd erupted in murmurs. How could anyone recover from this?

Evelyn leaned into Ethan, her lips curving.

"By the way," she added sweetly, "allow me to properly introduce Ethan Caldwell. He’s hardly a 'poor man.' He’s the sole heir to Sterling Worldwide—you know, the company behind SportiveWear? Their operations are primarily overseas, so perhaps that’s why you missed it, Celeste." She paused, emphasizing her next words. "So no, he’s not with me for money."

The room went silent.

Celeste’s face drained of color.

Game over.
###Chapter 356 Is This Some Kind of Joke?

Evelyn's revelation hit the crowd like a thunderbolt.

Sterling Worldwide's global dominance made Thornton Enterprises look like small potatoes in comparison.

Celeste's face drained of color, her eyes widening in horrified realization.

She'd thrown away a diamond while chasing after cheap rhinestones.

The others exchanged stunned glances, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief.

Who would've guessed such an influential heir would hide his status so completely?

Evelyn didn't bother with their reactions. She simply followed Ethan out of the VIP lounge.

The moment the door closed behind them, a deafening crash echoed from inside - the sound of glass shattering against the wall, followed by Celeste's hysterical sobs.

When they reached the corridor's end, both exhaled sharply and simultaneously dropped each other's hands. Their eyes met with knowing smiles.

"How did you know about my family background?" Ethan couldn't hide his surprise at her earlier revelation.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Natalie told me."

Ethan muttered a curse under his breath. "That little-"

"Hey, it served its purpose," Evelyn countered. "No point hiding it now."

Ethan shrugged, unconcerned.

Before they could reach their private booth, measured footsteps approached from behind. A voice like chilled steel stopped them in their tracks.

"Leaving so soon?"

Nathan Blackwood.

They turned to face him. Evelyn crossed her arms. "Shouldn't you be comforting your friend, Mr. Blackwood? What brings you chasing after us?"

Gregory Thornton had finally gotten his comeuppance, but Nathan's stormy expression suggested he wasn't here about that. His gaze flicked to Ethan with predatory intensity. "You came here to make a scene deliberately."

It wasn't a question.

Ethan remained impassive, neither confirming nor denying.

Nathan's glacial stare returned to Evelyn. "I don't care about petty dramas. I'm here about you." His voice dropped dangerously low. "And him."

Nathan hadn't come to defend Gregory - Tristan had dragged him to this bachelor party against his will.

But seeing Evelyn enter that room hand-in-hand with Ethan, their effortless chemistry and unspoken understanding - it ignited something primal in Nathan. A possessiveness he couldn't control.

Evelyn sighed. "Nathan, don't you think you're overstepping?"

"Not at all." His response came without hesitation.

Nathan had always assumed no man could rival his place in Evelyn's life. Yet seeing Ethan standing there, receiving her public acknowledgment - it sent jealousy clawing through his chest with razor-sharp talons.

For the first time in his life, Nathan Blackwood felt genuine panic.

His attention snapped back to Ethan. The air between them crackled with barely restrained violence. "Is this real?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy - if Ethan answered wrong, Nathan would destroy him without hesitation.

Ethan glanced at Evelyn. "That's for her to say."

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathan's voice cut through like a blade. "Mr. Caldwell, give us a moment alone."

Ethan stiffened. The sudden shift in Nathan's demeanor was terrifying - like staring into the eyes of a predator moments before it struck. Yet outwardly, Nathan remained the picture of aristocratic composure.

Evelyn gave Ethan a reassuring nod. "I'll catch up with you later."

With a final assessing look at Nathan, Ethan walked away. He wasn't worried - the way Nathan looked at Evelyn left no doubt about his feelings.

An oppressive silence settled between them, broken only by muffled sobs from Gregory's party. The corridor's alcove shielded them from view.

"So this is how you replace me?" Nathan's voice was raw, the words scraping from his throat like broken glass.

Evelyn's breath caught. The pain hit like an electric current - sharp, sudden, and utterly paralyzing.
###Chapter 357 The Performance of a Lifetime

Nathan's words struck Evelyn like a dagger to the heart.

Why was she feeling this way for Nathan Blackwood? She pressed her lips together, blinking rapidly as a sharp sting pricked behind her eyes.

No. She wouldn't let this weakness take hold.

Lifting her chin, she met his gaze with deliberate coldness.

"Good. At least you understand."

His eyes were bloodshot, his lips pressed into a thin line. The proud, commanding figure she knew so well now stood before her, radiating a loneliness that made her chest ache.

He had tried threats—she hadn't flinched.

He had shown vulnerability—she hadn't softened.

Against Evelyn Sinclair, Nathan Blackwood was utterly powerless.

A commotion outside the private room drew Tristan Whitmore rushing in.

"Blackwood, hurry! Gregory's dragging Celeste to the hospital— Oh. Evelyn's still here?"

She offered him a faint, polite smile before turning on her heel.

Her retreating figure was unyielding, her steps decisive.

Nathan could only see the ice in her eyes—the indifference that had shattered him.

He didn't shout. Didn't lose control.

Outwardly, he was composed.

But his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white, veins standing stark against his skin.

Tristan called his name, but Nathan didn't move.

He didn't need to. Tristan could already guess what had happened.

Just as he opened his mouth to offer some semblance of comfort, Nathan turned abruptly and strode away.

Tristan called after him, but the storm brewing in Nathan's eyes made him hesitate.

Before he could follow, another scream erupted from Gregory's private room.

With a curse, Tristan rushed back inside.

Evelyn returned to Adrian's private room. The moment Ethan Caldwell saw her expression, he knew Nathan had lost this round.

In love, the one who fell first always loved harder.

Adrian had indeed ordered a bottle of vintage Château d'Yquem for her, but she had no appetite for it now.

All she could think about was the raw pain in Nathan's eyes.

Had she gone too far?

But sooner or later, he would have to accept reality. She would move on. He would marry someone else.

Gregory's private room was several doors down, far enough that the noise didn't reach them.

What no one realized was that the building's layout twisted in an irregular S-shape. Their balcony was actually adjacent to Gregory's.

Needing air, Evelyn stepped outside.

From the neighboring balcony, Tristan caught sight of her and immediately ducked behind the curtains.

Now was not the time to face Her Majesty.

Ethan joined her, handing her a glass of the prized wine.

"Bad mood?"

She accepted it with a wry smile, watching the city lights blur through the evening fog.

"Not as good as yours, apparently."

Ethan chuckled. "Right. Because you played your part flawlessly."

He raised his glass, clinking it lightly against hers before downing it in one go.

Evelyn took a sip. The wine was rich, velvety, with just the right sweetness. It lingered on her tongue, warm and intoxicating.

"You weren't bad either. We made quite the convincing couple."

Perhaps anger had fueled his performance.

Hidden behind the curtains, Tristan's legs nearly gave out from sheer panic.

After what felt like an eternity, the two finally left the balcony.

Trembling, Tristan fumbled for his phone and sent the recording to Nathan.

Finally, the man could rest easy.

Nathan's phone lit up with the notification. He tapped it.

Ethan's voice came through first.

"Right. Because you played your part flawlessly."

Then Evelyn's.

"You weren't bad either. We made quite the convincing couple."

The clink of glasses.

Nathan froze.

He replayed it. Again. And again.

The suffocating weight in his chest dissolved. The storm in his eyes cleared.

A slow, triumphant smirk curved his lips.

A fake relationship.

Leaning back in the car seat, he exhaled deeply, finally relaxed.

Then his eyes snapped open.

"Harrison," he ordered the driver. "Turn the car around."

If it was all an act, then Ethan Caldwell was no threat at all.

The tempest inside Nathan had vanished, replaced by clear skies.

"Yes, sir." The driver didn't dare delay.
###Chapter 358 A Surprise Wedding Change

Evelyn Sinclair had stayed up past 1:00 am playing poker with her friends, winning round after round.

She knew they were letting her win on purpose, but the thrill of victory kept her going.

Only when she saw Victor Kensington's exhausted dark circles and pitiful losing expression did she finally call it a night.

The next morning, Evelyn slept in late, having wisely locked Leo out of her room to prevent any disturbances.

Sunlight crept across her face, but she simply rolled over and buried herself deeper into the blankets.

Then her phone rang.

Damn! I forgot to silence it!

The persistent ringing forced her to answer irritably. The caller ID made her groan.

"Isabella Montgomery, do you have a personal vendetta against my beauty sleep?"

Isabella paused for a beat before bursting into laughter.

"Do you know what you've missed while sleeping like a log?"

"What?"

"Gregory Thornton's wedding! With a completely different bride!"

Evelyn sat up abruptly, sleep vanishing instantly. "What?"

"Apparently his fiancée's ex showed up at the bachelor party last night. No one knows what was said, but Gregory dragged her to the hospital and discovered she wasn't even pregnant!"

Isabella kept pouring the shocking details faster than Evelyn could process them.

"Now he's marrying some heiress from Boston who's been chasing him for years. She's from old money - not as wealthy as the Thorntons, but definitely better than that gold-digging ex."

Evelyn's drowsiness evaporated completely. Isabella didn't know Evelyn had been with that ex-boyfriend last night.

She never expected their confrontation would cause such a dramatic chain reaction.

Evelyn had assumed Gregory would simply call off the wedding when he learned the truth.

Not fake a pregnancy test. Not replace his bride overnight.

Clearly, Gregory had absolutely no intention of forgiving Celeste Rousseau.

Evelyn bit her lip. "How is this new bride even willing to marry him after all this?"

Isabella scoffed. "Willing? She practically threw herself at him! The Thorntons couldn't find anyone in our circles willing to marry their disgrace of a son. Everyone knows what a train wreck Gregory is."

Evelyn fell silent. That much was true.

After chatting a few more minutes, Evelyn finally dragged herself out of bed.

By noon, she planned to grab lunch near the office before meeting Bennett to discuss Preston Sinclair's investigation. Halfway there, Bennett called - Preston had unexpectedly appeared at San Francisco University.

Without hesitation, Evelyn changed course toward the campus.

The buzz about the Wall Street tycoon made him easy to locate - he was giving a lecture to students.

She rushed to the auditorium only to freeze in the doorway.

Every seat was taken, with students even standing along the walls and sitting in the aisles.

Apparently everyone wanted to glimpse this legendary financial wizard.

Evelyn hesitated, uncertain whether to push through the crowd. Then a familiar deep voice called out.

"Evelyn, over here."

She looked up to see Nathan Blackwood seated front and center, his custom Tom Ford suit and Patek Philippe watch marking him as distinctly out of place among the students.

An empty seat beside him seemed almost sacred in its isolation.

For two heartbeats she hesitated. Then business instincts won over personal feelings.

Money, after all, was money.

"Why are you here?" she asked, her tone sharper than intended.
###Chapter 359 The Sudden Change in His Demeanor

Nathan's lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "The same reason you're here, darling."

Business alliances were always about mutual interests. Their target was identical - Preston Sinclair.

Evelyn moved closer, settling into the seat beside him. His crisp bergamot cologne enveloped her senses.

Their striking presence drew admiring glances. To onlookers, they appeared as the perfect power couple.

"Mr. Blackwood, surely this matter doesn't require your personal attention?"

"And yet here you are in person, Ms. Sinclair." His voice dropped to that velvety baritone that never failed to send shivers down her spine.

Evelyn studied his profile. The usual icy composure remained, but something was... different.

Where was the broken man with bloodshot eyes from yesterday?

Why did he seem completely unaffected now?

As if sensing her scrutiny, Nathan turned. His gaze softened when it met hers. "Enjoying the view?"

Evelyn blinked, then rolled her eyes dramatically. "Your arrogance knows no bounds."

Nathan's smile deepened - a rare sight that would shock anyone who knew him.

"Feel free to look your fill. I don't mind at all."

"Someone should teach you the meaning of humility," Evelyn muttered, turning away sharply.

A rich chuckle rumbled from his chest. Oddly, he seemed delighted by her sharp tongue. Today she'd spoken more than two words to him - progress.

Nearby students gaped openly. This was the same man who'd frozen earlier intruders with a single glacial stare.

Yet now he was practically purring for Evelyn Sinclair.

Was it her beauty that melted the infamous Ice King?

While Evelyn huffed insults, Nathan absorbed every word with visible pleasure.

Their charged dynamic crackled with unspoken tension.

After ten awkward minutes, a professor entered with disappointing news. "Mr. Sinclair had to leave campus unexpectedly. You're all dismissed."

Groans filled the room as students shuffled out.

Evelyn rose with a sigh. As she reached the exit, an overeager undergrad bumped into her.

She stumbled forward - only to be caught by a familiar strong arm. She recognized the platinum watch before even looking up.

Nathan steadied her, then positioned his broad frame to block the doorway. His piercing gaze locked onto the offender with terrifying intensity.

The crowd froze. The guilty student trembled under Nathan's silent wrath.

"P-please forgive me! I didn't mean—"

Evelyn offered a conciliatory smile. "It's fine. Just be more careful."

Nathan finally stepped aside, but no one dared move until Evelyn exited first. She could feel his presence following at a respectful distance.

As they neared campus gates, Evelyn quickened her pace.

"Have lunch with me," Nathan called.

"My appetite disappears in your company."

A beat of silence. Then that infuriating smirk returned. "And who does inspire your appetite?"

Evelyn couldn't resist twisting the knife. "My new boyfriend, naturally!"

Let's see how Mr. Arrogant handles that.
###Chapter 360 Don't Cry

Evelyn's words hung in the air between them. Nathan's expression froze momentarily.

The hesitation lasted barely a heartbeat.

A slow smile curved his lips as he reached up, fingers poised to tuck a windblown strand of hair behind her ear.

Evelyn jerked her head away before he could make contact. His hand dropped back to his side.

His voice came out rough and low, yet his gaze remained unbearably tender.

"Is that so? Well... That doesn't change my invitation to lunch."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Why did this man cling to her like gum on a designer shoe?

"I have no interest in dining with you, Mr. Blackwood. Show some dignity."

Nathan's eyes crinkled at the corners, his smile widening. The rich timbre of his voice wrapped around her like velvet.

"Dignity is overrated."

Evelyn's chest constricted with irritation. She spun on her heel, refusing to waste another breath on this infuriating man.

The shadows in Nathan's eyes lifted as he called after her, voice laced with amusement.

"Lunch?"

"Go to hell!"

Nathan's next words stopped her mid-stride. "I know exactly what Preston Sinclair and Lawrence Whitmore are hiding."

Evelyn turned back without missing a beat, her change of heart shamelessly immediate.

"Fine. Let's eat."

Nathan's slow, triumphant smile made her want to punch him. The way his dimples appeared when he was pleased was downright criminal.

She'd expected a quick meal at some corporate bistro. Instead, Nathan drove them clear across Manhattan to Le Ciel Bleu - the impossible-to-book private dining club with a three-month waiting list.

The host ushered them directly to the secluded terrace. Nathan pulled out her chair with exaggerated courtesy.

Evelyn sat stiffly as he handed her the menu.

"Order whatever you like."

She shoved it back without glancing at the pages. "The most expensive tasting menu."

Nathan didn't blink, simply nodding to the waiter before rattling off additional requests in fluent French.

Evelyn studied the tranquil koi pond beyond the glass walls. Delicate paper lanterns swayed beneath the eaves, their crimson glow painting the water with shifting patterns. Wind chimes sang a crystalline melody in the breeze.

Every detail whispered of meticulous craftsmanship.

"How did you know I'm investigating Preston and Lawrence?"

Nathan lifted the porcelain teapot, pouring with ceremonial precision. Jasmine-scented steam curled between them.

"Hardly a state secret. The boardroom gossip reached my office before your assistant's memo did."

Evelyn suppressed a groan. Of course.

"Let me guess - Blackwood Enterprises wants Preston too?"

Nathan's eyebrow arched. "Would I be here if we didn't?"

"I'll share what I know, but don't expect me to hand him over." Evelyn's fingers tightened around her cup. "If I lose Sterling Corporation, will you gloat?"

Nathan's lips twitched. "Why so defensive? You're acting like I've already won."

"If you lose," he continued, gaze softening, "it means you succeeded. I'd celebrate for you."

Evelyn snorted. "Bullshit."

"Seriously though..." He leaned forward. "If Sterling lets you go, come to Blackwood Enterprises. Any position you want."

Was this man actually trying to poach her?

Evelyn tilted her head. "What position outranks CEO?"

"The CEO's wife."

Her teacup clattered against the saucer. A bitter laugh escaped her.

"Three years of marriage and your receptionist still carded me at the elevator. Only starry-eyed interns fall for your lines now."

His words didn't stir her heart - they ignited her temper.

The cruelest irony? That same receptionist never questioned Vanessa Holloway's comings and goings. Vanessa had flaunted her access for years, each smirk another twist of the knife.

All those small indignities reminded Evelyn why distance was survival where Nathan Blackwood was concerned.
###Chapter 361 This Game Won't Fool Me

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for an uncomfortably long moment. His piercing gaze held a bitterness that made his chest constrict painfully.

Breathing became an effort.

During Evelyn Sinclair's marriage to him, she had never received the respect she was owed.

Each recollection of this truth left him gasping for air.

Evelyn had long since stopped dwelling on those insignificant memories. She understood now that those three years had been nothing but her own foolish fantasy. Only sheer determination had carried her through that dark period.

The past was dead to her. She wanted it buried forever.

Nathan's intense stare burned into her. His dark eyes were pools of regret. Seeing her casual indifference as she spoke made his lungs seize again.

His fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. "It won't... happen again," he forced out.

Nathan vowed silently to always put her first now, to cherish her properly. He'd never take her for granted again.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes.

There would be no future between them.

She had clarity now. Nathan Blackwood would never again hold her heart.

She lifted her teacup and took a deliberate sip.

"Get to the point."

After all, she hadn't come here to listen to his maudlin regrets.

Nathan lowered his lashes, brow furrowing slightly. He took only a moment to compose himself before looking up.

"The reason Lawrence Whitmore is so confident," he began smoothly, "is his connection."

Nathan met Evelyn's gaze squarely. "Preston Sinclair's butler."

Evelyn's brows shot up. "Butler?"

Nathan nodded. "Though just a servant, he holds Preston Sinclair's complete trust. Sometimes, the butler's word can sway Preston's decisions."

"Is Preston Sinclair his puppet?" The thought escaped before Evelyn could stop it.

But Nathan merely smiled and continued. "This butler frequently visits Montecito on Preston's behalf. He always meets with Lawrence Whitmore during these visits because Lawrence's birth mother is the butler's adopted mother."

Evelyn's cup clattered against its saucer. "That's the connection?!"

No wonder Lawrence Whitmore had gambled his entire family fortune to secure this opportunity for his son Damian.

If this butler truly held such influence with Preston Sinclair, the Whitmores would undoubtedly win this deal.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She was swimming with sharks now.

The food arrived. Nathan's tone lightened. "Let's eat first."

Evelyn eyed the exquisite dishes without appetite.

Nathan moved to serve her, but she subtly shifted her plate away.

"I'll help myself."

His hand froze mid-air before retreating to serve himself instead.

"Of course."

Though she'd eaten nothing since morning, Evelyn only picked at her food.

Nathan barely touched his meal, his attention fixed on her instead.

He studied the delicate arch of her brows, the perfect curve of her lips, wishing this moment could stretch into eternity.

Even he couldn't comprehend his own actions. He'd expended considerable effort uncovering this secret, only to trade it for... a meal with her.

He'd debased himself just to see her content.

Yet somehow, it felt worthwhile.

Nathan didn't know when he'd become this person, but since he couldn't change his feelings, he'd embraced this new version of himself—one hopelessly, helplessly in love with her.

Outside, rain began to fall in a gentle drizzle.

Tiny droplets rippled across the garden pond's surface where koi swam lazily.

When Evelyn set down her fork, Nathan rose.

"I'll drive you back."

Evelyn stopped him with a look. "Nathan Blackwood, don't waste your time on me."

Her rejection couldn't have been clearer.

There would be no second chances.

Nathan stood tall in his charcoal overcoat, the picture of effortless elegance.

He answered lightly, as if it didn't matter. "It's no waste if I choose to spend it this way."

Mountains of work awaited him at the office, yet here he sat, content to watch her eat lunch.

He must be under some kind of spell.
###Chapter 362 He Doesn't Collect Garbage

Sterling Worldwide Headquarters.

Evelyn Sinclair needed to discuss Preston Sinclair's situation with Alexander Sterling.

The moment she stepped into the marble lobby, her eyes landed on a vaguely familiar woman sitting in the waiting area.

Celeste Rousseau.

Their gazes locked simultaneously.

Celeste's face was ghostly pale, with still-visible slap marks marring her cheeks. She sprang up but was immediately blocked by security.

"Stay where you are!"

Celeste's desperate eyes pleaded with Evelyn. "I just need Ethan Caldwell's contact details. I've realized I must return what I owe him..."

Evelyn's mocking laugh made Celeste stiffen.

"Give it to me. I'll deliver it for you."

She extended her hand with a raised eyebrow.

If Gregory Thornton hadn't exposed Celeste's deception, would this woman be so eager to repay Ethan now?

The repayment was clearly just an excuse. What Celeste truly wanted was to reconnect with Sterling Worldwide's heir apparent.

Celeste hesitated. "I... I need to give it to him personally."

Evelyn stepped closer. "You know exactly what I am to him, yet you're asking me for his number? How pathetic can you get?"

Celeste's head jerked up angrily.

But she didn't dare lay a finger on Evelyn.

"Let me guess - you're broke after Gregory dumped you, and now you're hunting for your next meal ticket?"

Evelyn's blunt words made Celeste flush with humiliation.

"That's not true!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Celeste clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm.

"I just want to apologize."

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Fine, I won't interfere with your nonsense. Wait."

Celeste's eyes brightened with hope.

The call connected after three rings.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?"

Celeste's face fell at Ethan's warm tone toward Evelyn. She quickly masked her disappointment.

"Celeste Rousseau is in my lobby," Evelyn stated coolly. "She claims she wants to repay you. Should I give her your details?"

The prolonged silence spoke volumes about Ethan's disgust.

When he finally spoke, his voice could have frozen hell. "Have her leave the money with you. Consider it compensation for dirtying your floors."

Celeste's purse hit the ground with a thud.

Her voice cracked with desperation. "Ethan! I know I was wrong! Please! Just give me five minutes—"

His response was glacial. "Do I look like a garbage collector to you? I don't collect trash!"

When Celeste tried to interrupt, Ethan cut her off.

"Evelyn, I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later."

The line went dead.

Evelyn pocketed her phone with an indifferent glance. "Satisfied?"

Her patience had evaporated.

"Ms. Sterling, please—"

Evelyn cut her off with a derisive laugh. "Why the hell would I help you?"

Turning on her heel, she headed for the elevators, tossing instructions to security.

"Remove her. Call the police if she resists."

"Yes, ma'am!"

Upstairs in Alexander's office, Evelyn relayed Nathan Blackwood's warning.

Her brother remained silent for a full minute before bursting into laughter.

"Nathan's quite confident in your failure, isn't he?"

"What?"

"He wouldn't have warned you unless he was certain you'd lose."

Evelyn stared incredulously. Was her own brother enjoying her potential downfall?

"Since my inheritance is at stake, I can't afford to lose."

Alexander produced an envelope from his desk drawer.

"I just discovered this before you arrived. The butler's frequent destination whenever he visited the city."

Evelyn frowned at the address. "An amusement park?"
###Chapter 363 Going to Live With Her

Evelyn Sinclair had asked all her friends, yet none were available to join her at the amusement park today.

Even her closest friends Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont had declined her invitation.

Left with no choice, she decided to bring her AI companion Leo along.

She'd cleverly disguised Leo as a domestic cat, dressing him in adorable feline attire that made him look like an exceptionally large house cat.

The tiger-turned-cat peeked out from her designer tote bag, his golden eyes sparkling with excitement.

"I want the carousel! And the roller coaster!" Leo whispered urgently, his tail twitching beneath the fabric.

Evelyn shushed him gently. "Remember your cover - you're supposed to be a normal house cat."

Leo pouted dramatically, clawing at the expensive leather of her bag in protest.

"Meow," he grumbled unconvincingly.

She couldn't help but chuckle as she scratched behind his ears. "Good kitty."

Her visit wasn't purely recreational - she was here on business. Without a photograph of Preston Sinclair's butler, she could only assume he'd be an older gentleman.

Yet none of the senior men here fit the profile, as they all appeared to be accompanying children.

As Evelyn wandered through the park, a small figure in a lion onesie suddenly barreled into her legs. "Pretty Lady!"

Startled, she looked down at what sounded like an eight-year-old boy. "Excuse me? Who are you?"

She glanced around, wondering if someone had lost their child.

"It's me! Don't you remember?" The child's voice carried a heartbreaking note of disappointment.

Evelyn was thoroughly confused.

Reaching out, she lifted the lion mask. "Little lion?"

The boy gasped dramatically before removing his hood completely. Evelyn helped him, smiling at his theatrical nature.

He was an adorable child with golden curls and sapphire eyes that sparkled like tropical waters, barely reaching her waist in height.

Hugging her leg tightly, he beamed up at her. "I finally found you!"

While instantly charmed, Evelyn worried he'd mistaken her for someone else. "Are you lost? Should we find your family?"

The boy shook his head violently, his expression crumbling. "You really don't remember? I'm Oliver!"

His lower lip trembled dangerously, eyes welling with tears.

Evelyn panicked slightly - she'd never seen this child before in her life!

Before he could start crying, she quickly suggested, "Let's get you to guest services to find your parents."

Oliver immediately dug in his heels, tears now streaming as park visitors began staring. "I'll be good! Please don't leave me!"

The display melted nearby hearts. An elderly woman scolded Evelyn, "Don't tease your little brother like that, dear. Take him home."

Evelyn could only blink in bewilderment.

Now standing at the playground exit with both her mission incomplete and an unexpected child in tow, Evelyn sighed as Oliver clung to her hand with a triumphant grin.

"Home time?" he asked hopefully.

"Whose home?" Evelyn countered cautiously.

"Yours! You can keep me until I'm big enough to marry you!" Oliver declared.

At this, Leo's head popped out of the bag. "How long will that take?"

Oliver gasped at the "cat," immediately reaching to scoop Leo up by the scruff. "A talking kitty! Can I play with him?"

"I'm a tiger!" Leo protested as he dangled.

"No, you're a magical cat!" Oliver kissed Leo's nose loudly before cuddling him tightly against his chest.

Seeing Leo's resigned expression, Evelyn suppressed a laugh. "How about this - you come with me temporarily while we locate your family?"

Oliver nodded eagerly, practically vibrating with joy. "I'm finally going home with my Pretty Lady!"
###Chapter 364 Not My Kind of People

Evelyn Sinclair's heart softened at the sight of the lost little boy. His wide, frightened eyes reminded her of a stray kitten she'd once rescued.

She led him straight to her office at Sterling Corp. "Bennett," she called to her assistant, "take Oliver's picture. We need to contact the authorities to find his family."

The child - Oliver Sinclair - clung to her hand with surprising strength. His tiny fingers wrapped around hers like a lifeline.

Just as they were leaving, two unwelcome figures appeared in the hallway. Lawrence Whitmore and his son Damian strode toward them, smug satisfaction radiating from every pore.

"Ms. Sterling," Lawrence purred, stopping directly in their path. "I heard about your little amusement park excursion. Quite the busy day, wasn't it?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. The man had spies everywhere.

Lawrence's smile turned predatory. "No need to waste your energy, my dear. Damian here will be handling the negotiations with Preston Sinclair. It's for Sterling Corp's benefit, after all. You'll always be William Sterling's daughter, regardless."

Damian chuckled behind his father. "Exactly! Even if you're not CEO, you still hold majority shares!"

Their confidence was almost comical.

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Best of luck to you both then."

She didn't waste another word, guiding Oliver away from the toxic pair.

"Pretty Lady," Oliver piped up in his adorable voice, "you don't like them?"

The boy had clearly caught Preston Sinclair's name being mentioned. That's my daddy! he thought but didn't say.

Evelyn snorted. "They're like mosquitoes at a summer picnic. Sooner or later, I'll swat them away."

"Then I don't like them either!" Oliver declared with childish fervor. "Whoever Pretty Lady doesn't like, I don't like!"

Evelyn ruffled his hair affectionately. "Mm."

Returning to Sterling Manor, they found the house unusually empty. Even Archibald, the family butler, had accompanied her father on his business trip.

For now, Oliver was entirely her responsibility.

Meanwhile, at The Regal Grand's presidential suite...

A bodyguard and maid stood trembling before a massive oak desk. The air was thick with tension as they watched the man behind the desk flip through documents with terrifying calm.

An older gentleman - clearly the head butler - approached after ending a phone call. "We have news! Young Master was taken by some woman. I'll dispatch security immediately to retrieve him and have that kidnapper arrested!"

"Wait-" The maid interjected, watching their employer's expression carefully. "Perhaps... perhaps Young Master went willingly?"

The butler scoffed. "He's just a child! What does he know? That woman clearly took him for ransom! Mr. Sinclair, we can't let this stand!"

The maid exchanged nervous glances with the bodyguard, both hesitating to speak.

The man at the desk - Preston Sinclair - finally looked up. His piercing gaze could freeze lava. "The truth. Now."

Under that stare, all resistance crumbled. They spilled everything in one breath.

"Mr. Sinclair, Young Master wouldn't let us follow! He said... he said he liked that pretty lady and wanted to go home with her..."

Silence. Heavy, suffocating silence.

"I'll handle this personally," Preston finally said.

He knew his son. If Oliver hadn't wanted to go, no force on earth could have moved him.

But "pretty lady"? What fresh hell was this?

"Should we punish the woman?" the butler pressed.

Preston's glacial stare shut him down instantly. "Do as you're told."

The butler stiffened. "Yes, sir."

Back at Sterling Manor...

Evelyn watched as Oliver played with Leo, her AI tiger companion. The pair were rolling across the plush carpet, the boy's laughter ringing through the grand foyer.

She was heading to the kitchen to prepare dinner when the front door swung open.

Turning, Evelyn found herself face-to-face with a stranger. The man in the doorway had features carved from marble - all sharp angles and unyielding lines. His presence filled the space like a thundercloud, every bit as commanding as Nathan Blackwood's.

Her brow furrowed. She'd never seen this man before in her life.

"Who are you?" she demanded, instinctively stepping between him and Oliver.
###Chapter 365 The Unexpected Matchmaker

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat. How did he get inside Sterling Manor?

Then it hit her - she'd forgotten to close the main gates after her evening walk.

Preston Sinclair stood motionless in the foyer, his piercing gaze sliding past Evelyn to land on the golden-haired child hiding behind her legs.

"Come here," his deep voice commanded.

The little boy bounded forward with surprising speed, wrapping his arms around the man's tailored suit pants. "Papa!"

The contrast between father and son was striking. While they shared similar aristocratic features, the child's golden curls and sapphire eyes were a stark contrast to Preston's raven hair and mahogany eyes.

Evelyn couldn't help admiring the genetic perfection standing before her.

Preston effortlessly scooped up the squirming child with one arm. "You little escape artist," he chided, though his voice held unmistakable fondness. "Did you really think you could run off without consequences?"

Oliver kicked his legs futilely. "I saw the angel lady! I want to stay with her! She's my Muse now! Papa, you can't keep true love apart!"

Evelyn's cheeks burned at the child's declaration. Before she could respond, Preston let out an amused chuckle.

"What happened to your undying devotion to Miss Holloway? Changed your mind so quickly?"

"But she is Miss Holloway! My pretty Muse!"

Preston's entire body went rigid. His eyes locked onto Evelyn's face with sudden intensity, studying her with an expression she couldn't decipher.

Evelyn cleared her throat awkwardly. "Excuse me, but are you really his father? I found him alone at the carnival and—"

"I know," Preston interrupted softly, his gaze dropping to Oliver with a mixture of exasperation and affection.

A buzzing phone shattered the moment. Preston glanced at the screen and frowned before carrying Oliver toward the door. "Good evening, Ms. Sterling."

"No! I won't leave my Muse! I love her! We're meant to be—"

Evelyn listened to the fading protests with bemusement. The impeccably dressed stranger clearly moved in powerful circles if he'd tracked her down so quickly. She made a mental note to upgrade the manor's security.

As the echoes of Oliver's dramatic exit faded, Leo padded to the door, his mechanical tail drooping in disappointment at losing his new playmate.

Evelyn secured the entrance before heading upstairs for her evening skincare routine. Settling onto the massage chair with Leo curled in her lap, she scrolled through her tablet.

"Mama," Leo chirped suddenly, "Lucas instructed me to find you a suitable romantic partner. I've processed global databases and identified the top ten most eligible bachelors meeting all criteria."

Evelyn nearly dropped her tablet. "Excuse me?"

"Lucas's orders," Leo confirmed.

Curiosity piqued, Evelyn asked, "Who made the list?"

"After eliminating married candidates, those over thirty-five, individuals with net worth below ten figures, and suboptimal physical attributes..." Leo's processors whirred. "Only one perfect match remains."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do tell. Get me his number—let's arrange a meeting."

Leo's tail wagged enthusiastically. "Initiating call now."

Pride surged through Leo's circuits. What an excellent matchmaker he was.

Before Evelyn could react, a familiar baritone answered. "Blackwood."

Evelyn froze. That voice—

Leo sprang to life. "Papa! Mama wants to go on a date with you!"

"Leo Sterling!" Evelyn shrieked, scrambling to shut off the mischievous AI.

Nathan's rich laughter filled the room. "Miss me already, Evelyn?"

"You insufferable—" She glared at the smug robotic tiger. "Wrong number entirely!"

Leo blinked his luminescent eyes innocently as Evelyn desperately searched for his off switch. The little traitor had planned this all along.
###Chapter 366 Their Young Master Is Different

"Wrong number? Then who do you want to date?" Nathan's voice was smooth as velvet, laced with amusement.

"Anyone but you!" Evelyn snapped.

She was fuming, her cheeks flushed with irritation. Leo blinked up at her, utterly bewildered by her reaction.

Nathan fell silent for a beat before speaking again, his tone lower, more deliberate.

"Didn't you used to adore me?"

"That was a lifetime ago," Evelyn retorted.

She had nearly forgotten the heartache of those days.

Her voice sharpened as she added, "That's in the past. I've moved on. You don’t—"

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn grabbed Leo by the scruff of his neck and hissed, "Hang up. Now!"

Leo whimpered but obeyed, ending the call with a dejected flick of his paw. His big, sad eyes welled up with tears.

Evelyn’s anger softened. She released him and stroked his head gently.

"You little troublemaker," she sighed. "You know I can’t stand him. Why would you call him?"

"But Mama," Leo protested, "you said you wanted to date the most perfect man!"

Evelyn scoffed. "He’s divorced! That disqualifies him immediately!"

"But he was married to you," Leo reasoned. "If he meets all your other standards, doesn’t that balance it out?"

"Absolutely not!"

Leo shrank back, his tail drooping. "Oh… okay."

Later that night, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a message.

She glanced at it, then rolled her eyes.

[No dating anyone else.]

"As if he has any say," she muttered, tossing her phone aside.

The Regal Grand Hotel, Presidential Suite

Oliver Sinclair bolted for the door, stark naked, only to be scooped up by a towering bodyguard.

The little boy wailed dramatically. "I wanna sleep with Pretty Lady! I don’t wanna stay here!"

The bodyguard deposited him onto the sofa while the maid emerged with pajamas in hand.

"Young Master," she chided gently, "Mr. Sinclair won’t be pleased if you keep running off. You’ll scare the lady away!"

Oliver pouted. "But I miss her!"

The maid crouched down, her voice conspiratorial. "You have to win her over first, Young Master. Be charming!"

Oliver’s sapphire eyes widened. "Really?"

The bodyguard handed him a glass of milk and nodded firmly. "Yes!"

Late that night, Preston Sinclair returned to the suite. The staff stood guard, ensuring Oliver didn’t escape again.

"Mr. Sinclair," the maid greeted, taking his coat.

Preston hummed in acknowledgment and walked over to Oliver’s bed. The boy was fast asleep, murmuring, "Pretty Lady… mwah…"

The adults exchanged exasperated looks.

Before leaving, Preston paused. "If he wants to see Ms. Sterling tomorrow, let him."

The staff gaped.

The next morning, Oliver was dressed impeccably in a tiny tuxedo, his hair slicked back.

The maid clasped her hands. "So handsome! She’ll adore you!"

Oliver preened. "Only for Pretty Lady!"

He turned to the bodyguard. "Did you find out how to impress her?"

The bodyguard held up his tablet. "Flowers."

The maid shook her head. "Jewelry!"

Oliver grinned. "I’ll get both!"

At the flower shop, the florist paled when the hulking bodyguard approached.

"Uh… can I help you?"

"Roses? No—wait." The bodyguard pointed. "Those white ones!"

Our Young Master must stand out.

Meanwhile, the maid marched into a high-end boutique.

The sales associate brightened. "Looking for something special?"

"The heaviest gold bracelet you have," the maid declared.

Our Young Master must be seen as generous.
###Chapter 367 You're Too Petty

The grand entrance of the Montecito Convention Center gleamed under the afternoon sun.

A sleek black Maybach pulled up to the curb, its tinted windows hiding the precious cargo within.

Inside the vehicle, little Oliver Sinclair clutched his carefully selected gifts, his blue eyes sparkling with excitement. The nanny adjusted his tiny bowtie while the bodyguard handed him the final item.

"I can do this myself," Oliver declared, puffing out his chest. "Big boys don't need escorts."

The nanny exchanged amused glances with the security detail. "Very well, young master."

With a bouquet of pristine white chrysanthemums in one hand and a velvet jewelry box in the other, Oliver marched through the automatic doors.

The receptionist's heart melted at the sight of the impeccably dressed child. "Hello there, sweetheart! Who are you looking for?"

Oliver beamed up at her. "I'm here to see my Muse!"

Just then, the elevator doors parted to reveal Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood emerging together, maintaining a carefully calculated distance between them.

Oliver's face lit up when he spotted Evelyn. He dashed forward and wrapped his arms around her legs. "Muse!"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Oliver? What are you doing here?"

The child's long lashes fluttered as he shyly extended the flowers. "These are for you."

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly when she recognized the funeral blooms. Her gaze darted between the white chrysanthemums and Oliver's hopeful expression.

"I picked them special!" Oliver announced proudly. "They're the prettiest flowers for the prettiest lady!"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the sight of the inappropriate bouquet. His fingers twitched with the urge to confiscate the offending arrangement.

"Who's this?" Nathan asked through gritted teeth.

Oliver turned his angelic face upward. "Good afternoon, Ancient Sir!"

Nathan's eyebrow twitched. Ancient? When the boy had just called Evelyn 'Muse'?

Evelyn bit back a laugh at Nathan's thunderous expression. "We met yesterday at the charity gala."

Nathan checked his platinum watch. "The meeting's concluded. Shall we discuss the Pacific Heights project over tea?"

"Absolutely not," Evelyn said immediately.

Nathan smirked. "I have Preston Sinclair's itinerary."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Fine. Tea it is."

She turned back to Oliver. "Where are your parents, sweetheart?"

Oliver shook his head vigorously and grabbed Evelyn's hand. "I'm coming with you!"

The child's instincts screamed danger - this old man was clearly trying to steal his Muse away.

"No," Nathan stated flatly.

Oliver's lower lip trembled as he gazed up at Evelyn with puppy-dog eyes. "Muse, I love tea parties..."

Evelyn's resolve crumbled instantly. "Of course you can join us!"

Oliver shot Nathan a triumphant look as they walked to the café, swinging their joined hands. "Muse smells like sunshine and happiness!"

Nathan muttered under his breath, "That child is a menace."

Evelyn gasped. "Nathan Blackwood! How dare you speak that way about an angel?"

Oliver stuck his tongue out at Nathan when Evelyn wasn't looking.

The exclusive tearoom Nathan selected was all gilded mirrors and white linen. Oliver positioned himself protectively next to Evelyn, eyeing Nathan with suspicion.

Nathan produced a Tiffany blue box with a smug smile. "I had this specially commissioned in Paris. It's perfect for you."

Evelyn didn't even glance at the offering. "Keep it."

Oliver suddenly remembered the velvet box still in his pocket. As he reached for it, Nathan smoothly changed the subject.

"The contract details can wait until after tea," Nathan said pointedly.

Oliver huffed but settled back in his chair, already plotting his next move in this unexpected battle for his Muse's attention.
###Chapter 368 A Kiss for Me?

Nathan's deep voice broke the silence. "Open it."

His chiseled profile looked like it had been painted by an old master, every angle perfect under the soft lighting. That aristocratic aura of his never failed to make Evelyn's breath catch.

She hesitated before lifting the lid. Inside lay a breathtaking piece - the legendary "Moonlight Sonata" bracelet by Laurent Dubois.

Only one existed in the world.

The diamonds caught the light, scattering rainbows across the table. Even more stunning than the magazine spreads.

She'd tried to purchase it last month, only to find it already sold. And now here it was, in Nathan's hands.

He poured tea with those elegant fingers, first for her, then with visible reluctance, for the little boy beside them.

Young Oliver practically vibrated with excitement as he peered at the jewelry. "Hah! Mine's way better!"

The child shot Nathan a superior look. "Old man, you're so cheap! Girls deserve the best, don't they?"

Nathan's eyebrow twitched.

Oliver proudly produced his own velvet box. "For you, my muse!"

Inside sat a chunky gold bangle that could probably stop bullets.

The silence was deafening.

Oliver scooted closer, explaining with the confidence of a seasoned jeweler. "Real ladies love solid gold. The heavier, the better. Take notes, gramps."

Nathan's lips thinned. "Oh?"

Evelyn felt her eyelid twitch. "Did you...buy this yourself?"

While not extravagant by her standards, this was absurd for a child.

Oliver beamed. "Of course! Daddy says I can buy anything for pretty ladies!" He puffed his chest. "We're rich!"

Evelyn frowned. "I can't accept this." The weight surprised her when she lifted it. "Children shouldn't—"

Oliver's face crumpled. "But Daddy said it's okay!"

Ah. So this was Preston Sinclair's way of thanking her for rescuing his son yesterday.

Seeing those big eyes well up, Evelyn sighed. "Alright, I'll keep it."

Oliver's grin returned instantly. "Do you love it?"

"...It's very...substantial."

He pointed triumphantly at Nathan's offering. "Do you love that?"

Evelyn hesitated. "...No."

Oliver's smile could power a small city. He tapped his rosy cheek. "Then I deserve a kiss!"

Nathan's teacup hit the saucer with a sharp clink. That brat was testing his limits.

Eight years old or not, anyone making moves on his woman was dead meat.

Evelyn chuckled at the child's antics. Too adorable. She pressed a kiss to his forehead, ruffling his hair. "Be good now. Adults need to talk business."

Oliver turned scarlet, suddenly fascinated with his shoelaces.

Nathan glared at the wall. He refused to be jealous of a third grader.

Evelyn slid the blue box back. "Keep it."

Nathan froze. "You don't like it?"

He'd seen that spark in her eyes. She'd taken the kid's monstrosity but refused this?

Her lips curved. "I don't want anything from you."

Brutal.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Your father said we should interact normally. Isn't gift-giving normal?"

Evelyn stood. "Are we discussing Preston Sinclair or not?"

Nathan exhaled. "He's hosting a private dinner next week. Lawrence Whitmore will attend."

Evelyn whistled. "Lawrence moves fast. I need to step up my game."

"How do you know about this?" she pressed.
###Chapter 369 She's My Girlfriend

Nathan Blackwood smirked. The invitation had already been delivered to her.

Evelyn Sinclair was stunned.

Her pulse quickened. Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Enterprises were both key stakeholders in this deal, equally matched in influence.

There was no logical reason for Preston Sinclair to invite Blackwood Enterprises and exclude Sterling Corporation.

Had Preston already made his decision?

Seeing Evelyn's troubled expression, little Oliver Sinclair tugged at her sleeve.

"Pretty Lady, if you want to go, I can invite you!"

His voice was bright with childish enthusiasm. "It's Daddy's party, so I can bring my own guests, right?"

Nathan arched a brow, amused by the boy's boldness.

Such confidence for a little squirt.

Evelyn didn’t take him seriously, assuming he was just trying to cheer her up. She ruffled his hair affectionately before turning back to Nathan with a cool, unreadable gaze.

"Mr. Blackwood, is this your way of gloating?"

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly. "I could take you as my plus-one."

Evelyn set down her teacup with deliberate calm. "No, thank you. I’ll find another way."

Being Nathan’s date might be the simplest solution, but it would put her at a disadvantage—something she refused to accept.

She stood, and Oliver immediately latched onto her hand. "Pretty Lady, can I come to your house to play?"

She smiled. "Of course."

Nathan watched as the boy eagerly pulled Evelyn toward the door. His jaw tightened, a flicker of conflict crossing his sharp features.

For a moment, he considered giving her the opportunity outright.

But pride held him back.

The moment they stepped outside, Oliver’s earpiece crackled with his bodyguard’s voice.

"Young Master, don’t forget—invite her to dinner. A gentleman never lets his lady go hungry."

Oliver grinned and tugged Evelyn’s hand. "Pretty Lady, let’s eat first! I’m starving!"

Evelyn chuckled. "What do you want?"

His eyes sparkled mischievously. "Ice cream!"

She laughed. "You really are a kid."

"Fine, ice cream it is."

Her earlier frustration melted away as she indulged the little charmer.

They ended up at a high-end bistro nearby. The waiter couldn’t resist cooing over Oliver.

"Miss, is this your little brother? He’s adorable!"

Oliver scowled and crossed his arms. "I’m not her brother. I’m her boyfriend."

His attempt at sounding mature only made him more endearing.

Evelyn bit back a laugh. "He’ll have the kids' meal. And two parfaits, please."

Oliver pouted. "I don’t want a kids' meal! I’m not a kid!"

Evelyn smirked. "Then what do you want, boyfriend?"

Oliver’s cheeks turned pink. He fidgeted with his tiny suit sleeve, suddenly shy.

Pretty Lady called me her boyfriend!

Heart racing, he mumbled, "You pick. Ladies first."

Evelyn winked at the waiter and stuck with the original order.

The waiter stifled a grin. This kid is something else.

Evelyn nibbled on her parfait while Oliver devoured his meal with the appetite of a growing boy.

When the bill arrived, Oliver slapped his custom-made Rolex against the payment scanner before Evelyn could react.

Beep. "Payment confirmed: $790. Thank you."

Evelyn blinked. That watch probably cost more than her purse.

Oliver smoothed his sleeve with an air of nonchalance.

Clearly, Preston Sinclair was no ordinary man.

Evelyn studied the boy. "Oliver… who is your father?"
###Chapter 370 Just a Jerk

Oliver Sinclair blinked rapidly, his lips parting to introduce himself when a frantic whisper crackled through his tiny earpiece.

His nanny hissed, "Don't tell her anything! If you do, she'll fall for your father instead!"

Oliver's small shoulders slumped. Compared to his impossibly perfect father, the only advantage he could claim was being younger.

"My Muse can't be stolen by Daddy! Never!"

The boy's mouth snapped shut like a trap. His eyes darted sideways with sudden mischief.

"My father's loaded, but all his billions will be mine someday. So you should just adore me now."

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't suppress the bubble of laughter that escaped her. The child's audacity melted her heart completely.

Preston Sinclair must be obscenely wealthy!

She led Oliver back to Sterling Manor where Leo, her AI tiger companion, nearly short-circuited from excitement, spinning dizzy circles around the boy.

"Mommy! I adore Oliver already!"

Oliver scooped up the mechanical feline, scratching behind its ears with practiced ease.

"I adore you too, kitty!"

"This content is the property of N?-velDrama.Org."

"I'm a tiger!"

Leo's tail lashed indignantly as Evelyn slipped into the kitchen for refreshments. The moment she disappeared, Oliver hoisted the struggling AI by its scruff.

"Listen here, furball. I'm Muse's boyfriend, so if you call her Mommy, you'd better call me Daddy!"

Leo's face contorted from the awkward grip. "No way! Daddy is Nathan Blackwood! The most gorgeous man alive!"

"Mommy says tigers should be bold!"

Fuming, Oliver dropped the cat but immediately panicked about potential tattling. "Whatever! I won't waste time on some malfunctioning robot! She's mine anyway!"

A melodic chime interrupted from Oliver's smartwatch.

Preston Sinclair's ID flashed.

Grumbling, Oliver accepted the call. "Daddy..."

Preston's baritone voice rumbled through the speaker. "Location. Now."

"I'm at Muse's house! And you can't come over!" Oliver's voice pitched higher with desperation.

If his breathtaking Muse met Daddy, he'd be completely outmatched!

Preston's dark chuckle vibrated through the watch. "Thirty minutes. Either you're home, or I collect you personally."

He derived particular pleasure from thwarting his son's schemes.

Oliver stomped his foot, cheeks puffing like an angry chipmunk. "No! No! I'm sleeping over with Muse!"

"Who are you arguing with?"

Evelyn reappeared carrying two glasses of chocolate milk, eyebrows raised.

Oliver moved to end the call when Preston's commanding voice stopped him. "Put her on."

With great reluctance, the boy extended his wrist. Only then did Evelyn notice the holographic display: Call in Progress.

"Is that your father?"

"Ms. Sterling, we meet again."

Evelyn's response remained flawlessly composed. "Mr. Sinclair."

"My apologies for the intrusion. Someone will retrieve the troublemaker shortly. If he resists, simply deposit him on the doorstep. No need for sentimentality."

Evelyn glanced at Oliver's scarlet, puffing face and laughed. "How heartless."

"Any boy scheming to sleepover with women is just a spoiled brat."

The line went dead.

Oliver's eyes bulged, his entire face flushing crimson. "Stupid Daddy!"

Ruining his chances with Muse! That traitorous, horrible, mean Daddy!

Evelyn bit back another laugh, quickly soothing him. "Don't fret. I know our Oliver would never be that sort of boy!"

After extensive coddling, Oliver's sulk gradually lessened.

The doorbell chimed moments later.

Evelyn answered to find a pleasantly plump nanny beaming on the doorstep. "Pardon the interruption. I'm here for Young Master Sinclair."

Oliver shuffled forward, the picture of angelic innocence. The nanny produced an ornate pastry box with an exaggerated wink that bordered on facial spasm.

"Young Master, the special order you requested."

Oliver's pause lasted only a heartbeat before his manners kicked in.

"Muse, these are for you..."
###Chapter 371 You'll Scare Her

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise, then sparkled with delight.

It was her absolute favorite patisserie! "Thank you, Oliver. Take care!" Little Oliver waved enthusiastically with both hands.

"Goodbye, Muse!" Leo trotted over, his mechanical tail wagging excitedly.

"Bye, Oliver!" Inside the luxury car, Oliver tilted his head proudly. "Muse is really beautiful, isn't she?" The nanny couldn't help but agree.

"Absolutely stunning! More beautiful than all those women trying to get close to your father. You should be worried!" Oliver blinked his sapphire eyes and nodded solemnly.

"Yes, I must stay vigilant!" The bearded bodyguard sat sulking in the front seat. "I thought I was supposed to go. I didn't even get to see her properly."

The nanny rolled her eyes. "You'd frighten Muse with that scary face of yours!" Oliver nodded in agreement.

"Exactly!" The burly bodyguard shrank further into his seat, looking utterly dejected.

Oliver's delicate features scrunched in thought. "We can't keep giving the same gifts. We need something special for next time!" The bodyguard flipped through his newly purchased 'Romance for Beginners' and muttered, "I thought those presents were perfect..."

Back at The Grandeur, Oliver struggled to climb onto the massive bed when Preston scooped him up. "I heard you didn't submit your English assignment?" Preston's voice held its usual icy edge.

Oliver huffed and clung to his father's legs, burying his face in the tailored trousers. "Daddy, I'm busy courting my Muse!"

"How exactly are you courting her?" Preston arched an eyebrow as Oliver proudly listed all his gifts for Evelyn.

When Preston heard about the white chrysanthemums and chunky gold bracelet, an amused smirk played on his lips. His earlier anger completely dissipated.

"Best of luck then." Preston ruffled Oliver's hair affectionately. If Evelyn hadn't thrown Oliver out after those gifts, she truly had the patience of a saint.

As Preston turned to leave, Oliver piped up, "Daddy, can I invite Muse to your business dinner?"

"Dinner?" Preston frowned momentarily before realizing Oliver meant his exclusive executive gathering. The invitation list contained no more than five names - all strictly confidential.

"If you wish." Preston's tone remained indifferent. Normally he would never permit such a breach of protocol, but this was the woman from three years ago. That changed everything.

Preston's current project had global investors holding their breath. The venture demanded unprecedented resources and connections, making discretion paramount. Even his movements were classified information.

In Montecito's cutthroat business arena, Nathan Blackwood stood among the elite. Yet Preston considered him merely one of many potential partners.

Stirling Worldwide matched Blackwood Enterprises in capability, but Preston dismissed them outright. His butler's persistent recommendations had crossed professional boundaries - something Preston wouldn't tolerate regardless of their decade-long association.

For days, Preston Sinclair deliberately ignored all overtures from Stirling Worldwide.

Evelyn found Nathan's repeated dinner invitations increasingly irritating. She had no desire to attend Preston's exclusive gathering as Nathan's plus-one.

Yet Nathan persisted, claiming he wanted fair competition with Stirling Worldwide. "Ridiculous!" Evelyn muttered. "How can I compete when I can't even secure an invitation?"
###Chapter 372 Absolutely Adorable

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of the corporate lobby to find Oliver Sinclair striking a pose against the side of a sleek limousine. His tiny hands were tucked into the pockets of his miniature suit, his golden curls catching the afternoon sunlight.

Those sapphire eyes sparkled with mischief as he scanned the crowd. Every woman passing by couldn't help but coo at the sight of him. This little heartbreaker was going to devastate hearts when he grew up.

The moment Oliver spotted Evelyn, his entire face lit up. He dashed toward her with outstretched arms, nearly tripping over his own feet in excitement. "Muse! I missed you soooo much!" His voice was pure sugar as he buried his face against her thigh.

Evelyn's stern expression melted instantly. There was something about this child that bypassed all her defenses. She crouched down to his level, unable to resist ruffling his soft curls. "I missed you too, my little prince."

Oliver proudly presented a velvet box with both hands. "I brought you a present!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "What's the occasion?"

"A party!" Oliver bounced on his toes. "Daddy said I could invite you! There'll be cake and music and—" He lowered his voice conspiratorially, "—I told all my friends about how you're the prettiest lady in the whole world."

Evelyn hesitated. The memory of Preston Sinclair's intense gaze during their brief encounter sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. The man radiated danger wrapped in an Armani suit.

Oliver's lower lip trembled. "Please? I picked out your dress myself!"

Curiosity won out. Evelyn opened the box and gasped. Nestled in silk was an exquisite champagne-colored gown that seemed to shimmer even in shadow. The intricate beadwork formed delicate floral patterns that would catch the light with every movement.

"This is..." Evelyn traced a finger along the delicate fabric. Even without a label, she recognized couture craftsmanship when she saw it.

Oliver beamed. "Do you like it? Mrs. Winslow helped me choose!"

"It's breathtaking."

The little gentleman performed an exaggerated bow before opening the limo door. "Your chariot awaits, my lady!"

The interior was a child's fantasy—plush leather seats surrounded by limited-edition action figures and a mini fridge stocked with juice boxes. A discreet partition separated them from the driver.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at The Regal Grand. The hotel entrance was eerily quiet, with security barricades blocking the street. A guard moved to intercept them until he recognized Oliver, then immediately stepped aside with a respectful nod.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Quite the security for a children's party."

Oliver just giggled, dragging her toward the elevators.

The transformation was magical. The gown hugged Evelyn's curves perfectly, the delicate fabric flowing like liquid gold. When she emerged from the dressing room, Oliver's jaw actually dropped.

He clutched his cheeks, starry-eyed. "You look like a real-life princess!"

Evelyn laughed as he twirled around her, inspecting every angle.

"I mean it!" Oliver declared solemnly. "When I grow up, I'm going to marry you!"

Evelyn tapped his nose. "And what if I say yes right now?"

Oliver's eyes widened in panic. "No no no! Daddy says I have to finish school first!"

The sound of approaching footsteps made them both turn. Preston Sinclair stood in the doorway, his dark gaze sweeping over Evelyn with undisguised appreciation.

"Trouble," Oliver whispered dramatically. "Daddy's here."

Evelyn's breath caught. The way Preston looked at her—like she was the only woman in the world—sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

Oliver tugged her hand. "Don't worry, Muse. I'll protect you from his scary face."

Preston's lips quirked. "Shall we, princess?" He offered his arm to Evelyn while Oliver proudly claimed her other hand.

As they walked toward the ballroom, Evelyn realized two things simultaneously:

First, this was definitely not a children's party.

Second, she was in way over her head.
###Chapter 373 Who's the Stranger Here?

Oliver Sinclair's cheeks flushed pink as he shyly lowered his gaze while walking with Evelyn toward the grand banquet hall entrance.

The moment they stepped inside, an atmosphere of refined elegance enveloped them.

Evelyn immediately sensed this was no ordinary gathering. Her sharp eyes caught sight of Nathan Blackwood across the room.

She froze mid-step, her expression shifting subtly.

Noticing her hesitation, Oliver tugged at her hand. "Muse, why are we stopping? Daddy's waiting for us inside!"

Evelyn's grip tightened around the boy's small hand. "Your father...what's his name?"

Before Oliver could answer, an older man flanked by two others approached them abruptly. "Identify yourselves!" His booming voice cut through the air.

Evelyn turned to face the intruder. The man's eyes raked over her designer gown with visible disdain.

"How dare you steal the mistress's dress? Gold-diggers aren't welcome here! Leave immediately!"

Evelyn's blood boiled at the accusation. Only when she recognized the two men behind him - Lawrence and Damian Whitmore - did realization dawn.

This wasn't just a child's party.

Oliver positioned himself protectively in front of Evelyn. His voice, though young, carried his father's commanding tone. "You will not speak to my guest that way!"

The butler faltered under the boy's glare. "Young Master, you can't just bring uninvited guests to such an occasion! This isn't some public—"

Evelyn cut him off with a cold laugh. "Who exactly are you calling uninvited?" She never tolerated disrespect.

The butler spluttered until Lawrence intervened hastily. "This is Evelyn Sinclair, CEO of Sterling Worldwide."

Shock transformed the butler's face.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Interesting. I wasn't aware servants held such authority here." Her icy gaze pinned him in place. "Unless you're the master of this house?"

Though head butler to Preston Sinclair, the man knew better than to antagonize powerful guests. He swallowed his retort with visible difficulty.

Turning to Oliver, he said stiffly, "Young Master, you know the rules. No uninvited guests permitted."

Oliver crossed his arms, his small frame radiating authority. "Since when do you give orders to me?"

"But Young Master, Mr. Sinclair's direct orders—"

"Muse is here with Daddy's permission!" Oliver's voice rose with indignation. "How dare you insult her?"

Evelyn's breath caught at the name 'Sinclair.'

Preston Sinclair? The elusive tycoon who'd ignored all her meeting requests? The man who'd appeared at her home was Oliver's father?

A waiter approached with a bow. "Young Master, Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Sinclair requests your presence."

Oliver shot the butler a withering look before taking Evelyn's hand. "Don't mind him, Muse. I'll have Daddy replace him tomorrow."
###Chapter 374 You're My Honored Guest

The butler standing behind them trembled violently, but it was too late to retreat now.

He had nearly forgotten that this particular young master wasn't someone easily deceived! What a disastrous oversight! Lawrence Whitmore nudged the butler impatiently.

"Hurry up! We can't let Evelyn Sinclair get there first!" The butler clenched his teeth, forced to usher them inside first.

Every employee working for Preston Sinclair recognized the butler instantly. When he escorted these two uninvited guests, no one dared ask for invitations.

The waiter who remained hesitated. "Mr. Sinclair only requested to admit Young Master and Ms. Sterling. He didn't mention anyone else."

The butler's expression darkened. "Ridiculous! I'm the head of this household! Mr. Sinclair won't blame me. I'll take full responsibility."

With that, he guided Lawrence and Damian Whitmore into the lavishly decorated banquet hall. The standard hotel furnishings had been completely replaced with the most exquisite decor for this exclusive event. Clearly, Preston Sinclair had spared no expense.

When Nathan Blackwood saw Evelyn entering hand-in-hand with the little boy, his steps faltered momentarily. Surprise flickered across his features. The car he'd sent to fetch Evelyn must have arrived empty since she was already here.

Strangely, Nathan felt both relieved and inexplicably pleased. Of course. My girl never admits defeat. She always finds her own way in.

Evelyn froze momentarily upon spotting Nathan, then deliberately averted her gaze, pretending not to notice him. Nathan caught the deliberate snub and nearly chuckled at her stubbornness.

Little Oliver excitedly tugged Evelyn's hand, pulling her forward. "Daddy! I brought Muse here!" The four industry titans present all showed varying degrees of surprise at Evelyn's appearance, their eyes reflecting admiration—especially Nathan's.

Evelyn typically dazzled at such events in bold, avant-garde designs that commanded attention, as if born for the spotlight. Yet tonight's understated gown accentuated her natural elegance perfectly, the delicate fabric skimming her waistline to create an ethereal vision of grace.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan entertained the selfish thought of keeping her hidden away from prying eyes.

Preston Sinclair maintained his usual aloof demeanor, though even he couldn't hide his momentary astonishment at Evelyn's transformation. Rising smoothly, he extended his hand courteously.

"What a pleasant surprise, Ms. Sterling. You're my most honored guest tonight."

The others immediately stood to exchange greetings, reassessing their assumptions about Sterling Corporation's standing. They'd written off the company, never expecting its CEO to make such a dramatic last-minute entrance.

Evelyn's lips curved into a practiced smile. "Mr. Sinclair, the pleasure is entirely mine."

Preston chuckled lowly, casting an amused glance at the beaming child clinging to Evelyn's side. "Has this little troublemaker been pestering you terribly these past few days?"

Evelyn gently ruffled Oliver's hair. "Not at all! Oliver's been an absolute delight. My entire family adores him."

The boy preened, wrapping his arms around Evelyn's waist possessively, his eyes crinkling with happiness. "I adore you too, Muse!" This child never missed an opportunity to declare his affection.

Nathan's gaze darkened as he observed Preston and his son. The trio looked disturbingly harmonious together. An irrational urge to whisk Evelyn away surged through him.

Amid the lighthearted moment, the butler approached with noticeable hesitation. His eyes darted toward Evelyn before quickly looking away, as if afraid to meet her gaze. "Mr. Sinclair, there's something—" He cut himself off abruptly.

Preston didn't miss the butler's furtive behavior. His expression cooled slightly as he addressed the group. "Please excuse me briefly. Enjoy yourselves."

Evelyn exhaled quietly, relief washing over her. Who could have predicted that the adorable child she'd met by chance at the amusement park would turn out to be Preston Sinclair's son? Without this fortuitous connection, she'd never have gained entry tonight.

Nathan moved closer, his rich baritone voice brushing against the back of Evelyn's neck. "So you've met before? When exactly was your first encounter?"
###Chapter 375 Keep Your Distance From Her

Evelyn Sinclair turned around and shot Nathan Blackwood a withering glare.

What business is it of yours?

Nathan inhaled sharply, his jaw tightening for a fraction of a second before he schooled his expression back into indifference.

He was used to this by now.

After a long pause, Nathan muttered, "Just making conversation. You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to." His voice carried a hint of wounded pride.

The three bystanders nearly choked on their drinks, their glasses slipping in their hands.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. She pressed her lips together.

Could this bastard act normal for once?!

Little Oliver Sinclair planted himself firmly in front of Evelyn, blocking Nathan’s path.

The boy blinked his wide sapphire eyes and stared Nathan down with all the seriousness a five-year-old could muster.

"Sir, stay away from her!"

Nathan arched an eyebrow.

He hadn’t expected the kid who’d given Evelyn white chrysanthemums to be Preston Sinclair’s son.

Not that it mattered.

He still disliked the little brat on principle.

"Sir, do you like Muse too?" Oliver crossed his arms, his delicate features scrunching up in suspicion. His sparkling eyes narrowed at Nathan like a tiny guard dog.

He could tell—this man looked at Muse with dangerous intentions.

Nathan smirked and leaned down slightly, meeting Oliver’s gaze. His eyes flickered toward Evelyn’s figure with undisguised longing before he murmured, "Yeah."

A single word, spoken softly.

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard Nathan actually chuckled.

Adorable.

Oliver huffed, his nose in the air like a miniature aristocrat. "You’re too old for Muse! Give up!"

Nathan stiffened.

Old?!

He dominated the industry. He was the youngest in the Forbes top ten. How dare this snot-nosed brat—

Nathan’s expression darkened as he leveled a glacial glare at the boy.

Just as he was about to put the little menace in his place, Oliver tugged Evelyn’s sleeve urgently.

"Muse! Daddy’s calling us. Let’s go!"

Oliver’s voice was bright with excitement—mostly because he wanted to get Muse far away from this creepy old man.

Evelyn glanced over and caught Preston Sinclair’s subtle nod. Oliver dragged her toward the group.

Across from Preston stood the butler who’d tried to bar her entry earlier, along with Lawrence and Damian Whitmore.

The butler’s face twisted with discomfort upon seeing Evelyn, while the Whitmore father-son duo radiated smug satisfaction.

"Ms. Sinclair, you know these two?" Preston gestured at the Whitmores.

Evelyn smiled and lifted her glass. "Of course. Mr. Whitmore is a shareholder at Sterling Corporation, and this is his son, Damian."

The butler interjected hastily, "Their identities are verified. Ms. Sinclair has personally confirmed it. Mr. Sinclair, Sterling Corporation meets all our requirements for this collaboration. They’re worth considering."

Preston remained impassive, though his gaze turned stormy. Evelyn arched a brow but stayed silent.

Lawrence Whitmore seized the moment. "Mr. Sinclair, we’re extremely flexible with terms. Name your conditions."

Preston exuded an icy aura that made the air itself feel heavier. After a beat, he turned to the butler.

"What’s your relationship with them?"

The butler froze.

Lawrence jumped in. "We’re practically family! It’s thanks to him that we even got this opportunity to—"

Preston cut him off with a raised hand. His frosty gaze pinned the butler in place.

"You know my rules. Remove them."

The butler hesitated. "But Mr. Sinclair, Sterling Corporation really is—"

"I’ll consider Sterling Corporation. Just not through these two."

Preston’s voice was lethally calm.

"And I don’t need a butler who forgets his place."

His eyes were arctic.

Final.
###Chapter 376 Show Them the Door

The air grew thick with tension.

Just a few feet away, the lively party continued, separated by an invisible barrier of discomfort.

Preston Sinclair's disgust was written plainly across his aristocratic features.

Rules were rules, and even his longtime butler would face consequences for breaking them. His voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"Lawrence Whitmore is hardly qualified, regardless of who I choose to work with."

Lawrence's face twisted through several expressions before settling on desperation. He shot a pleading look at the butler.

"Sir—"

The butler hesitated, still attempting to salvage the situation for Lawrence. It galled him that Evelyn Sinclair's sudden appearance had ruined his brother's chances.

"Mr. Sinclair, might I suggest—"

"My daddy already said no! Are you deaf or just stupid?"

Little Oliver's cherubic face scrunched up in irritation.

This butler had always been a nuisance—constantly interfering with Oliver's tutors and friends, spouting self-righteous nonsense.

And now he dared to bring these two creeps to harass his Muse? Oliver vividly remembered how they'd insulted Evelyn in the Sterling Corporation lobby.

The memory made his small hands ball into fists. He tugged sharply on his father's sleeve.

"That butler's the worst! He called Muse a nobody at the entrance! Wouldn't even let her inside!"

Preston's expression darkened dangerously.

Manners were non-negotiable for anyone in his employ. The butler trembled under his employer's hawk-like gaze.

"That's—that's not true! Young Master, you mustn't—"

Oliver blew an angry raspberry, puffing up like an offended kitten. The butler couldn't meet Preston's icy stare.

A cold realization settled in his gut. Ten years of service meant nothing. To Preston Sinclair, he was just another replaceable employee.

"Mr. Sinclair, I only meant—the gown Ms. Sterling wore resembled Madam's—I was concerned—"

Preston's gaze turned murderous at the mention of his late wife. Even Oliver fell silent, watching his father with wide eyes.

With a single gesture, Preston summoned the shadows. Two bodyguards materialized instantly.

"Remove them."

His voice held no emotion as he addressed the ashen-faced butler.

"Your employment is terminated. Be grateful I'm not pursuing legal action. Leave before I change my mind."

The butler opened his mouth to protest, but a gloved hand clamped over it. Within seconds, both he and the Whitmores were being escorted out.

The silence stretched for several heartbeats before Preston's expression softened. Turning to Evelyn, he offered a contrite smile.

"My apologies, Ms. Sterling. You shouldn't have had to witness that."

Evelyn returned his smile gracefully. "It's quite alright. Though, about this dress..."
###Chapter 377 She's the First Choice

The earlier conversation had hinted that Evelyn Sinclair's dress might have some connection to—

Preston Sinclair's son Oliver blinked his large, luminous eyes at Evelyn before immediately shaking his head.

"It's not!" Preston Sinclair paused for a moment.

His expression softened as he clarified, "It isn't. They're just from the same designer, so the style and color are somewhat similar. Let's head back." Evelyn didn't press further and followed Preston to the table.

Oliver was taken outside while the adults remained in the banquet hall. Nathan Blackwood had been sitting in his seat, his piercing gaze fixed unwaveringly on the trio the entire time.

People approached him to converse, but he ignored them all. The main seat was now occupied by Preston, whose mysteriously powerful aura rivaled Nathan's own commanding presence.

The three individuals beside Nathan stiffened when Preston approached, quickly returning to their seats. Though this was a private dinner, it functioned more like a high-stakes business meeting.

It was a gathering of industry elites discussing power and profit. Everyone wanted to collaborate with Preston Sinclair, but they all knew none could compete with Blackwood Enterprises.

When Evelyn arrived, whatever slim hopes they had for this deal vanished entirely. She took the seat to Nathan's left, and the air grew thick with tension.

Preston paused, his voice smooth and composed as if the earlier disturbance hadn't occurred. "Tonight's dinner is an opportunity to get acquainted with all of you."

"After all, you're the key players in this industry, and I'll need your support to expand my ventures in Montecito. Secondly, I have a project that requires partners."

Preston was direct. In truth, everyone here had come for that very project. His gaze swept across the room before settling on Evelyn.

"Ms. Sterling, I wasn't aware you were interested in this venture?"

Evelyn was momentarily taken aback, but her posture remained poised.

"Sterling Worldwide has already prepared extensively for this project." Preston nodded, his demeanor gracious.

"I wasn't informed beforehand, but now that I know, I can't let your efforts go to waste." With that single sentence, the expressions around the table shifted dramatically.

Even Evelyn was surprised. She understood the implication of Preston's words, but securing the project so effortlessly was unexpected. Nathan's gaze sharpened.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his imposing aura dropping the temperature in the room by several degrees.

One of the executives couldn't resist questioning, "Mr. Sinclair, the project hasn't undergone professional evaluation or testing yet. Are you saying you've already chosen Sterling Worldwide?" His glance at Evelyn was laced with complexity.

Though Sterling Worldwide was as formidable as Blackwood Enterprises, it was rare for partnerships to be decided before a project's full maturation. They'd come tonight merely to gauge Preston's stance.

A hint was all they needed to strategize. But Preston's declaration meant all subsequent resources would now flow toward Sterling Worldwide.

"Yes," Preston confirmed. "As long as Ms. Sterling desires it, she will always be my first choice. She will always have my priority."

The words detonated like a bomb.

Silence engulfed the room. Covert glances darted toward Nathan, whose chilling aura had intensified.

Nathan's composure shattered. His face darkened as he fixed Preston with a glare sharp enough to cut glass.
###Chapter 378 The Unexpected Choice

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched.

They were complete strangers before tonight. So why was Preston Sinclair looking at Evelyn Sinclair with that peculiar expression?

Why would Preston hand over such a lucrative deal so casually? The lost contract didn't trouble Nathan.

Blackwood Enterprises spanned countless industries.

This project, though substantial, was merely a drop in the ocean. He'd sacrifice a hundred such deals rather than witness Preston's unsettling interest in Evelyn! Evelyn herself felt disoriented, as if floating through a dream.

Preston's expression held no trace of amusement. Why? A thousand questions swirled in Evelyn's mind. Yet her face remained an unreadable mask, betraying nothing.

"Because of young Oliver?" Preston concluded the dinner with brief remarks, sending guests filing out. What began as a formal gathering ended with seismic shockwaves.

Only Evelyn and Nathan remained - she seeking answers, he refusing to leave her alone with Preston. The tycoon chuckled at their stubborn presence.

"Ms. Sterling, I imagine you're brimming with questions. My offer stands - my team will contact Sterling Corporation for details."

"I don't understand," Evelyn cut straight to the point. Her previous attempts to reach Preston had failed spectacularly. Why this sudden change?

Preston tilted his head, considering his words carefully. "I didn't choose Sterling Corporation."

His gaze softened with genuine warmth as he declared, "I chose you." The tenderness held no ulterior motives, pure as morning light. Evelyn's pulse stuttered.

"Because I retrieved Oliver from the amusement park?" She could conceive no other explanation. Preston's laughter rang clear. "Certainly not."

"That clever boy would never endanger himself." Nathan's voice emerged like gravel, his piercing glare boring into Preston. "I'm equally curious about your sudden interest in Evelyn."

Preston studied Nathan with knowing amusement. "Mr. Blackwood, I expected you'd recognize the reason." Nathan's brow furrowed. "What reason?"

"Originally, this project belonged to Blackwood Enterprises. But Ms. Sterling's appearance changed everything. She's the perfect candidate." Preston signaled a bodyguard, who hurried off.

"Wait here."

Moments later, the guard returned bearing a leather-bound album. Preston extracted two photographs, handing one to each. The moment Evelyn's fingers touched the image, her entire body locked in shock.

The nightmare scene from three years ago materialized before her eyes - the European terrorist attack that haunted her dreams. Flames licking buildings, panicked screams, bullets whizzing past faceless crowds. Then the bomb.

She'd been fleeing when she spotted him - a golden-haired boy, no older than five, frozen in terror. Without thinking, she'd changed course.

As she dove to shield him, the world exploded in fire and shrapnel. Then - impossibly - an unyielding body covered hers completely. When the dust settled, Evelyn found herself unharmed beneath a bloodied stranger whose face she'd never forget.
###Chapter 379 The Truth Revealed

This memory was buried so deep in Evelyn's soul that she had locked it away, terrified of reopening old wounds.

The mere thought of that moment made her pulse quicken with emotions she'd sworn to forget.

She had been so afraid that remembering would weaken her resolve, that she might fall for Nathan Blackwood all over again.

Evelyn didn't know who had captured the exact moment she threw herself over the little boy.

The acrid scent of gunpowder still haunted her senses, chilling her to the bone. Preston Sinclair's sudden laughter snapped her back to reality.

Tears glistened in her eyes as she lifted her gaze, immediately meeting Nathan's intense stare. His dark eyes swirled with unreadable emotions, threatening to pull her under.

Her breath caught when she saw his expression.

The bloodied, determined face from her memories superimposed perfectly with Nathan's chiseled features now.

His aristocratic bone structure looked even more striking in the dim lighting, like a masterpiece carved from marble. The photo in Nathan's hand showed the exact moment he'd lunged at Evelyn.

Smoke and shadows intertwined in the image, both their figures frozen in protective stances. Evelyn had never wanted him to know about this incident, but the truth was undeniable now.

Though covered in dirt and debris, their faces were unmistakable. The blonde-haired boy she'd shielded was little Oliver Sinclair.

Oliver still had those same golden curls and delicate features, though he'd grown taller in the past three years.

Back then, the child had gotten a clear look at the beautiful woman who saved him - just as Evelyn had clearly seen Nathan rushing to protect her.

Preston cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Forgive me, Mr. Blackwood. I've known your true identity all along," Preston said with a slight cough. "That's precisely why you were my first choice this time. Though I could never uncover Ms. Sinclair's role until recently, when my son accidentally reunited with her in Montecito."

His voice grew solemn. "You both saved Oliver's life, but I owe an even greater debt to Ms. Sinclair. Had she not acted first..." Preston's shoulders tensed, his smile not quite reaching his eyes.

"My wife wasn't as fortunate as Oliver. She was still in the car when..." He trailed off, the unspoken words hanging heavily between them.

Evelyn's stomach dropped as the final piece of that tragic puzzle clicked into place.

Preston continued smoothly, "I hope you won't take offense at my decision to work with Sterling Corporation."

Nathan's voice was rough with emotion. "Of course not."

Bathed in the golden light, Nathan looked every inch the powerful CEO - yet his usual composure seemed shaken. When his gaze met Evelyn's, she saw storms brewing in those dark depths.

Regret. Shock. Yearning.

If only he'd recognized her sooner. They could have avoided so much pain, so many misunderstandings.

Their fates had been intertwined long before that fateful night at the underground fight club. Evelyn had always known the truth, while he remained oblivious.

He should have known. The realization left Nathan reeling.

Sensing the tension, Preston turned to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Ms. Sinclair, I hope you'll forgive my abruptness in revealing this."

Evelyn forced a calm smile. "There's nothing to forgive. The truth was bound to come out eventually."

She could no longer deny it - this had been their first meeting. The moment her heart first stirred for Nathan Blackwood.

As dinner concluded, Preston escorted them to the entrance. Little Oliver came barreling down the stairs, wrapping his arms tightly around Evelyn's legs.

"Pretty Lady!" he begged with wide, hopeful eyes. "Stay with us tonight! I want you to tell me bedtime stories!"
###Chapter 380 I Have to Marry You

Oliver Sinclair pouted. His sparkling sapphire eyes shimmered with hopeful anticipation. The sight made Evelyn Sinclair's heart instantly soften.

"Oliver, darling, I still have work to finish," Evelyn said gently, brushing a curl from his forehead.

Preston Sinclair checked his watch, his voice crisp and authoritative. "You should go upstairs and finish your assignments."

Oliver's face fell instantly.

He shot his father a miserable look. Homework followed him everywhere like an unshakable shadow!

Evelyn's thoughts drifted to the baby photo she'd seen earlier. How had that tiny infant grown into this bright-eyed boy?

An unexpected warmth filled her chest. She ruffled his soft curls affectionately. "I'll play with you tomorrow, okay?"

Oliver blinked those enormous blue eyes, his lower lip trembling.

Just when Evelyn thought he'd accept this compromise, the little boy suddenly clutched her skirt in a death grip.

"No! No homework!" His voice took on a mischievous edge. "I want to sleep with Muse and go home with you! Daddy can stay here alone!"

Preston's eyes narrowed dangerously. He knew his son's manipulative tactics all too well. With a sharp gesture, a towering bodyguard appeared.

The man scooped up the squirming child effortlessly, ignoring Oliver's dramatic protests.

"Noooooo! I won't go! Muse is mine forever!" Oliver wailed as he was carried away, kicking his little legs furiously.

Evelyn paused, meeting Preston's gaze. His dark eyes brimmed with unspoken emotions - joy, longing, regret all swirling together.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn slid into the waiting car. The drive stretched interminably, the silence between her and Nathan Blackwood growing heavier with each passing mile.

Finally, Nathan broke the tension. "You only remembered me because of that incident, didn't you?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together before answering. "Yes."

"Why didn't you tell me?" His voice held the same wounded confusion as when he'd learned about the underground fight club.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You saved me once. I saved you once. We're even now."

"Even?" Nathan's hands trembled slightly. The raw pain in his gaze made Evelyn instinctively tense.

Her voice turned frosty. "There are no second chances in life."

If she could turn back time, she'd never have walked down that aisle. Their marriage had been the most painful lesson of her life.
###Chapter 381 Don't Let Him Off

Back at Sterling Manor, Evelyn Sinclair felt utterly drained. Securing the massive deal with Preston Sinclair should have brought elation, yet her heart remained heavy.

The weight of that old photograph haunted her. Those buried memories now resurfaced with startling clarity.

Midnight found her staring at the ceiling, replaying the image behind closed eyelids. The sudden buzz of her phone shattered the silence.

She grabbed it irritably. The screen illuminated Nathan Blackwood's name.

[Evelyn, I'm relieved it was you I saved that day.]

[No one else. Just you. Thank heavens you're safe.]

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Moonlight streamed through the windows as she padded downstairs for warm milk. The creamy liquid soothed her throat but not her thoughts.

What's done is done, she reminded herself. Dwelling on ancient history served no purpose.

Morning brought a media frenzy. News of the Sinclair-Sterling collaboration spread like wildfire through Wall Street circles. Her phone overflowed with notifications from eager investors and corporate partners.

"Mommy!" Leo bounded into her room, tail swishing. "The whole world's waiting for you!"

After responding to Isabella Montgomery's message, Evelyn dressed with deliberate calm. The scent of freshly brewed coffee guided her downstairs.

Alexander Sterling stood rigid in the foyer, phone pressed to his ear. His expression darkened further when he spotted her.

"Sleeping through an earthquake, were we?" he snapped, ending the call abruptly.

William Sterling chuckled behind his newspaper. "How did you manage to charm Preston Sinclair? His team contacted us at dawn. Quite the turnaround."

Evelyn recounted yesterday's events between sips of orange juice. Understanding dawned across their faces.

Only Lucas Sterling shook his head mournfully. "Preston's son is practically grown. Another eligible bachelor slips through your fingers."

William's newspaper swatted at him. "Out!"

"Seconded," Alexander growled.

The office hummed with tension when Evelyn and Alexander entered the boardroom. Conversations died mid-sentence.

All eyes tracked her stilettoed stride to the head table. She settled into her chair with practiced ease, radiating quiet authority.

Lawrence Whitmore sat stiffly, fingers drumming the mahogany surface. His frantic calls to William Sterling had gone unanswered all morning.

Would they truly force him out? The thought turned his coffee bitter.

Alexander opened proceedings with crisp efficiency. Department heads delivered succinct reports before discussion turned to the Sinclair venture.

"Our R&D team must synchronize perfectly with Sinclair's engineers," Alexander stated. "Every phase requires meticulous attention, though final adjustments await contract signing. Questions?"

Heads shook in unison. Just as attendees gathered their papers, Alexander turned.

"Evelyn? Your thoughts?"

She met his gaze, then let it slide meaningfully toward Lawrence. The unspoken message was clear: this was her moment.

"Oh, I believe Mr. Whitmore owes us something," she purred. "That little wager about leaving Sterling Corporation? Let's settle that now."

Her smile held all the warmth of a stiletto between ribs.
###Chapter 382 Unwilling to Let It Go

Lawrence Whitmore had become nothing but dead weight to Sterling Corporation.

He gambled recklessly on someone else's coattails and lost spectacularly.

Keeping him around would only encourage others to follow his dangerous example.

If every executive expected Evelyn Sinclair to bail them out, would she always be this fortunate?

There was no way Evelyn would let Lawrence and Damian Whitmore walk away unscathed.

Lawrence's face twisted with panic as he turned to Alexander Sterling.

"Mr. Sterling, everything we did was for the company's benefit."

"Damian and I took on this project for Sterling Corp. We're thrilled that Ms. Sinclair secured the deal."

Alexander's icy gaze cut through Lawrence like a winter wind.

"So you're refusing to resign?"

The temperature in the boardroom plummeted at his words.

Every pair of eyes became daggers stabbing into Lawrence's pride.

Yes, Lawrence didn't want to leave in disgrace.

But Alexander's ultimatum left no room for negotiation.

Stammering, Lawrence searched Evelyn and Alexander's faces for any hint of mercy.

Finding none, he clenched his jaw. "Resign? I'm a shareholder of Sterling Corporation."

"If I leave, it must be with Chairman Sterling's approval, correct?"

A smug smirk crept across Lawrence's face.

Evelyn arched an elegant brow, amused.

"Quite right."

She pulled out her phone and dialed William Sterling on speakerphone.

Lawrence's expression froze, his throat tightening with dread.

"Beep... Beep..."

"Sweetheart! Just catching our lunch. Are you coming home to eat?"

William's cheerful voice carried through the speaker, accompanied by the sound of lapping waves.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Dad, we're in a board meeting. Lawrence Whitmore lost his bet, but claims he needs your permission to leave the company. We'd love your input."

Her emerald eyes glittered with mischief as she watched Lawrence squirm.

Lawrence's face turned ashen. "Chairman Sterling—"

William's booming voice cut him off. "Evelyn darling, I entrusted the company to you and Alexander."

"Whatever you decide has my full support. Just say the word and I'll sign the papers!"

The boardroom fell deathly silent.

Any potential allies of Lawrence wisely kept their mouths shut.

Lawrence's hands trembled violently, his knees threatening to buckle.

Evelyn chuckled. "Thanks, Dad. Enjoy your fishing!"

She ended the call with a decisive tap.

William Sterling never wavered when it came to protecting his family's interests.

Evelyn rose gracefully, resting her palms on the polished table.

"In that case, Mr. Whitmore, HR will handle your exit paperwork."

"As for your insignificant shares, you may sell them back to the company. Or keep them as a pension."

With that, she smoothed her blazer and turned to leave.

Catching Alexander's approving nod, Evelyn strode confidently from the room.

The moment the door closed, her phone buzzed with an impatient call from Oliver Sinclair waiting in the lobby.

Meanwhile, Isabella Montgomery had arrived in a foul mood, hoping to drag Evelyn shopping.

Instead, she found a blond child sitting cross-legged by the entrance, doodling on the marble floor with one hand while clutching a massive bouquet of white chrysanthemums.

Isabella froze mid-step, her designer heels clicking sharply against the tile.

"Is Sterling Corp hosting a funeral I wasn't informed about?" she muttered under her breath.
###Chapter 383 Sincere Praise

Isabella Montgomery stood a few paces away, observing the little boy with a perplexed expression. The child was undeniably adorable, but the bouquet of white chrysanthemums clutched in his tiny hands was utterly baffling.

Her mood soured instantly.

What on earth was Evelyn thinking? Why was there a child here holding funeral flowers?

Just as Isabella was lost in thought, Evelyn hurried outside, waving at her.

"What brings you here?"

Isabella quickly schooled her features, but before she could respond, the little boy dashed forward and wrapped his arms around Evelyn’s leg. He tilted his head up, his bright blue eyes sparkling with innocence.

"Miss Muse, I missed you so much!"

Isabella froze.

Evelyn chuckled, gently pinching the boy’s chubby cheeks. "I missed you too, sweetheart."

The child eagerly thrust the bouquet toward her. "These are your favorite flowers, Miss Muse!"

Evelyn accepted them with a strained smile. "Thank you."

Even she wasn’t aware that white chrysanthemums had become her favorite.

Well, it was the thought that counted.

Isabella frowned. Since when did Evelyn prefer chrysanthemums? Weren’t Lily of the Valley her go-to?

She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Evelyn, since when do you have a little brother? Is he your father’s secret love child?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Do you really think my dad could produce something this cute?"

Her father’s side of the family all had dark hair and brown eyes.

Though Preston Sinclair also had dark hair and brown eyes, his maternal lineage traced back to Northern Italy—blonde hair and blue eyes ran in that bloodline. His wife had been blonde as well.

Thus, the recessive genes had manifested in Oliver.

Isabella nodded. That made sense.

Evelyn and her brothers’ striking looks were entirely inherited from their mother.

Little Oliver studied Isabella with curiosity. Since she was Miss Muse’s friend, he decided to be polite—after all, he didn’t need to compete with her for Evelyn’s attention.

With that thought, he flashed a sweet smile, his sapphire eyes twinkling.

"Hello, Madam!"

Isabella’s heart shattered instantly.

She stiffened. He called Evelyn Miss Muse, but Madam for her?!

Rage flickered in her eyes, but Evelyn swiftly pulled her aside before she could explode.

"He’s just a kid! Cut him some slack, okay?"

Isabella trembled with indignation, glaring at the boy. Suddenly, his angelic face seemed irritating in every way.

"Hmph. What an obnoxious child!"

Oliver blinked, his innocent expression faltering. He didn’t understand why Miss Muse’s friend was so angry.

Just then, his nanny’s frantic voice crackled through his earpiece. "Young Master, you must be sweeter! Compliment the lady!"

Oliver’s eyes widened in realization. He stepped forward and took Isabella’s hand.

His gaze brimmed with sincerity as he declared, "Pretty Madam, your dress is very nice!"

Isabella’s face darkened. Fury swelled in her chest, choking her.

So now she was a Pretty Madam? And only her dress was nice?

Isabella Montgomery was accustomed to being adored and praised wherever she went. No one had ever dared insult her like this.

This was outright humiliation!

Evelyn bit back a laugh but quickly composed herself when Isabella shot her a death glare.

"Ahem... Gorgeous Ms. Montgomery, what did you need me for?"

She playfully swung Isabella’s arm, but the latter huffed and looked away.

"Don’t even ask. My mother’s relentless matchmaking is driving me insane. I came to see if you wanted to go shopping with me."

Hearing this, Oliver immediately tugged Evelyn’s hand, his expression protective.

"I got here first! Pretty Madam, why don’t you find someone else?"

The way he called her Pretty Madam made Isabella’s blood boil.

Evelyn couldn’t just dismiss Isabella—knowing her temper, she’d make Oliver’s life miserable later.

"Why don’t we all go together?" Evelyn suggested.
###Chapter 384

The trio made their grand entrance into the luxury shopping mall.

Isabella Montgomery never hesitated when it came to shopping. Within minutes, she'd selected an armful of designer items, swiping her black card without a second thought before instructing the staff to deliver everything directly to her penthouse.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair slipped into a dressing room to try on outfits. Little Oliver Sinclair dragged a velvet stool in front of the three-way mirror, perching eagerly with sparkling eyes.

"Oh Muse! You're absolutely radiant!" Oliver gasped, clasping his cheeks. "That emerald silk was made for you! No mortal could wear it better!" He spun dramatically. "Are you sure you're not an enchanted princess? The way that fabric shimmers when you move—it's pure magic!"

Evelyn's laughter echoed through the boutique as she twirled, thoroughly charmed by the boy's theatrics. With a careless wave, she purchased the entire collection.

From the back, Isabella's jaw dropped.

Unbelievable! That little charmer had a silver tongue sharper than any salesman—yet he reserved every honeyed word exclusively for Evelyn!

The boutique staff stood awkwardly by, their prepared compliments dying on their lips. Would corporate dock their commissions for failing to upsell?

At the Aquarium of Montecito

After their shopping spree, Oliver begged to visit the city's famed aquarium. Though he maintained a private marine exhibit at his father's Mediterranean villa, this facility housed rare species even his collection lacked.

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances at the "CLOSED" sign barring the entrance.

"Looks like we'll have to come back tomorrow," Isabella said with poorly concealed satisfaction.

Oliver's cherubic face darkened with determination. He pulled out his diamond-encrusted phone. "Daddy will make them open for us. Daddy can do anything!"

Evelyn intercepted the call. "Let me handle this, sweetheart."

As their hostess, one call to Bennett secured immediate access. Within minutes, the massive glass doors slid open, revealing a nervous-looking marine biologist.

"President Sterling! What an unexpected honor," the man stammered, bowing slightly. "We're actually undergoing maintenance today, but for you..."

Isabella shook her head in disbelief. Yet another reminder that in their world, closed doors simply didn't exist.

Blackwood Enterprises Headquarters

Harrison knocked twice before entering Nathan Blackwood's office. The CEO didn't glance up from the contract he was annotating.

"Speak."

Harrison cleared his throat. "Bennett just called regarding Ms. Sterling. She's visiting our aquarium facility today during its closure."

Nathan's fountain pen stilled. He lifted his gaze, mercury eyes sharpening.

Harrison continued hastily, "I've already approved the request, of course. But given your... interest in Ms. Sterling's activities..."

Nathan stood abruptly, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame. "How's that aquarium performing?"

"It was named California's top tourist attraction last quarter," Harrison reported. "Media outlets call it a 'bucket-list experience.' We limit to eighty visitors daily with reservations booked three months out."

A noncommittal hum was Nathan's only response. Such achievements barely registered on Blackwood Enterprises' scale.

As Nathan strode toward the door, Harrison ventured, "Shall I have the director prepare a full report?"

"Unnecessary." The words sliced through the air like winter wind as Nathan disappeared into the private elevator.
###Chapter 385 Little Baby

Nathan Blackwood, Evelyn Sinclair, and Isabella Montgomery couldn't stand watching the enormous fish and whales swimming around any longer.

They found a quiet corner to sit and enjoy their coffee.

The aquarium was unusually serene. The staff hovered nearby, anxious that the coffee they served might not meet the expectations of their distinguished guests.

Evelyn glanced around. "No fish in this section?" she asked, relieved.

The aquarist hesitated before answering, "Yes, Ms. Sinclair."

"This is the mantis shrimp exhibit. Since they aren’t particularly rare, fewer visitors come here."

"Would you like to see them?"

Mantis shrimp? Evelyn met the aquarist’s hopeful gaze and nodded.

Though, if she were being honest, she was more interested in eating them than admiring them.

The aquarist dimmed the overhead lights. Immediately, the walls, floor, and ceiling illuminated with a soft blue glow, mimicking the depths of the ocean.

The dim lighting created an illusion of being submerged in the deep sea. Evelyn leaned closer to the tank, spotting dozens of shrimp darting inside.

These weren’t the same mantis shrimp served on plates. The ones in the tank were oddly… cute.

They varied in size and color—some were stark white with black markings, simple yet mesmerizing. Others shimmered in vibrant greens and reds, their tails flickering with iridescent hues.

In the simulated seabed, they burrowed into the gravel, their slender bodies weaving gracefully through the water.

When the lights dimmed completely, Evelyn and Isabella felt as if they had been transported to the ocean floor. The walls vanished, leaving only the illusion of endless water surrounding them.

The corridor they had just walked through now resembled an underwater tunnel.

Above them, strands of seaweed and coral swayed gently. The deep, rhythmic sound of waves filled the space, enhancing the illusion of being submerged.

Isabella gasped. "A mantis shrimp exhibit?"

The aquarist launched into his well-rehearsed explanation. "The mantis shrimp is a predatory species, originating from the Mesozoic Jurassic period—"

Evelyn interrupted, eyes gleaming. "Are they all edible?"

The aquarist’s smile faltered. He glanced between the two eager women and forced a polite nod.

"Yes… if they’re fresh."

Under normal circumstances, he would have thrown out anyone who asked that. But these were VIP guests.

He sighed inwardly. Poor mantis shrimps.

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged a knowing look, grinning. Lunch plans had just been decided.

"By the way," the aquarist added, "you can purchase naming rights for any creature here. Choose one as your pet, and we’ll care for it in the aquarium. You can visit anytime."

Evelyn’s interest piqued. She pointed at a particularly vibrant mantis shrimp, its body sleek and colorful.

"Then I want this little baby."

"Certainly, Ms. Sinclair. This is a rare specimen acquired from the Mariana Trench at considerable expense."

"What would you like to name it?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn declared, "Nathan Blackwood."

The aquarist’s hand jerked, nearly dropping the expensive remote.

Isabella burst into laughter, clapping Evelyn’s shoulder.

"Little baby? You just want to devour him, don’t you?"

"Perfect name," Evelyn agreed smugly.

At the tunnel’s entrance, a tall, imposing figure stood frozen. His sharp features were schooled into calm, but his dark eyes narrowed dangerously.

In their eyes, I’m a mantis shrimp?

Isabella’s laughter abruptly cut off when she spotted him.
###Chapter 386 Are You That Desperate to Devour Me?

Nathan Blackwood entered with deliberate steps, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn Sinclair's back. The aquarium staff member quickly stepped aside, making way for their unexpected visitor.

This marked the first time their elusive CEO had personally inspected operations. Oblivious to the presence behind her, Evelyn tapped her chin thoughtfully while examining the display tank.

"Grilled or fried?" she mused aloud. Before Isabella Montgomery could respond, Nathan's rich baritone voice floated over her shoulder.

"Are you that desperate to devour me?"

Evelyn's spine went rigid. She whirled around, shock flashing across her features before settling into familiar irritation.

"You again?" she snapped. "Do I look thrilled to see you?"

Nathan's lips curved into an indulgent smile. "Which part of your expression suggests delight, darling?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Was the man blind?

His attention shifted to the mantis shrimp she'd been observing. "You called me 'baby'," he pointed out with amusement. Though merely a sea creature, the shrimp bore his nickname. By extension, it represented him.

Evelyn scoffed. "I was talking to the shrimp."

Nathan didn't press the argument. She'd never admit it anyway. Meanwhile, young Oliver Sinclair happily explored the aquarium exhibits alone.

Excited to share his discoveries, the boy went searching for his beloved "Muse" - only to encounter that detestable man again. Oliver's face scrunched in displeasure as he stomped over, glaring up at Nathan with undisguised contempt.

"Why are you here?" the child demanded.

Nathan had zero patience for the little nuisance. Oliver grabbed Evelyn's hand, beaming up at her with wide, innocent eyes. "Muse, I want to buy the thirty-meter blue whale from the next exhibit and ship it to Italy. What do you think?"

Evelyn frowned. The massive creature couldn't possibly fit on any plane or ship. Was it supposed to swim across the Atlantic?

Nathan's cold interjection came before she could respond. "No."

His tone turned glacial when addressing anyone other than Evelyn. Oliver crossed his chubby arms in outrage.

"Who says I can't buy it?" Nothing was beyond his father's means! Nathan regarded him with icy detachment.

"Because this is my aquarium."

Oliver's cherubic face cycled through shock, anger, and internal conflict before settling on stubborn defiance. With a dramatic huff, he tugged Evelyn's hand. "Come on, Muse! Let's go!"

"I might consider selling it..." Nathan's playful murmur stopped them mid-step. "...if you call me 'Big Brother'."

Isabella shuddered at the teasing tone.

Oliver froze, mouth working soundlessly. His expressive face contorted with the weight of this moral dilemma - perhaps the most challenging decision of his young life. Even Evelyn pitied his struggle.

The longer the boy hesitated, the darker Nathan's expression grew.

Finally, Oliver squared his little shoulders. Clenching his fists, he met Nathan's gaze with unyielding sapphire eyes. "NO. WAY."

He'd sooner abandon his beloved whale than compromise his integrity. "Daddy says good boys never lie," Oliver thought proudly.

Evelyn and Isabella burst into laughter at his principled stand. The child had spine!

Isabella's mirth suddenly died. "Thank goodness I never asked him to call me 'Muse'," she realized. "I'd be humiliated like Nathan." The thought killed her amusement completely.
###Chapter 387 She Was Terrified

Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery left the aquarium with little Oliver Sinclair in tow.

Nathan Blackwood followed a few steps behind them.

"How about lunch? I know this amazing seafood place," Nathan suggested with a hopeful smile.

Evelyn, Isabella, and Oliver turned simultaneously, their voices blending in perfect unison: "No way!"

Nathan chuckled as Evelyn quickened her pace toward the car, deliberately maintaining distance. She couldn't shake the feeling he'd cling to her like ivy on a brick wall.

A sleek black sedan idled fifty meters away, its driver watching intently. The moment Evelyn stepped onto the pavement, the engine roared to life.

Tires screeched as the vehicle accelerated directly toward her.

"Evelyn!" Isabella's scream pierced the air.

A blur of movement. Strong arms shoved Evelyn aside with bone-jarring force.

The world became a cacophony of crushing metal and shattering glass.

The car plowed into an ancient oak, its hood crumpling like paper. Smoke curled from the wreckage.

Silence descended like a shroud.

Oliver trembled, his small voice quivering. "Pretty Lady... that strange man..."

Evelyn lay sprawled across the sidewalk, her left arm screaming in protest. Her pulse hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing the moment of impact.

She turned her head slowly.

Nathan lay motionless in the street, his designer suit now a canvas of crimson.

Just minutes ago, those piercing gray eyes had sparkled with amusement as he teased her about lunch. Now they stared blankly at the sky.

Something inside Evelyn fractured.

"Call an ambulance!" Isabella scrambled to Evelyn's side. "Are you hurt?"

The words sounded distant, muffled as if underwater.

Oliver tapped frantically on his smartwatch, his forced calm betrayed by the tremor in his voice as he spoke to emergency services.

Evelyn crawled toward Nathan on hands and knees. Dust coated his usually immaculate hair. His lips had lost all color.

Blood pooled beneath him, spreading in dark tendrils across the asphalt.

Her vision blurred. Each breath became a struggle, her lungs constricting with invisible bands of iron.

He'd saved her. Again.

Isabella shook her shoulders. "Evelyn! Snap out of it!"

The world snapped back into focus. Evelyn pulled her cracked phone from her pocket and began issuing commands with military precision.

First Bennett - arrange the best medical team. Then Harrison - secure the hospital. Preston Sinclair - come collect Oliver immediately. Finally, the police.

Her voice turned arctic as she addressed Isabella. "Stay here. Guard that driver. Alive or dead, I want answers."

The ambulance arrived in under four minutes.

At the hospital, time stretched into agony. Evelyn sat statue-still in the waiting room, her hands clenched so tightly her nails left crescent moons in her palms.

Harrison appeared with tissues. "Ms. Sinclair... you're crying."

Only then did Evelyn notice the hot tears carving paths down her cheeks. A sob wrenched itself from her throat as she doubled over, shoulders shaking.

Raw terror washed over her in waves.

She was petrified. Not of the attack. Not of the pain.

But of losing Nathan forever.

The operating room doors burst open.
###Chapter 388: The Fallout

News of Nathan Blackwood's accident spread like wildfire through the elite circles of Montecito.

Margaret Blackwood, the formidable matriarch, arrived at the hospital in a flurry of designer silk and suppressed rage. Her husband, William Sterling, followed close behind, his expression unreadable.

The revelation that Nathan had thrown himself in front of a speeding car to save Evelyn Sinclair turned Margaret's grief into something darker. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as the doctors spoke.

William Sterling had seen enough tragedies to school his features, but the tension in his jaw betrayed him. After hours of silent vigil, his butler Archibald finally escorted him home when exhaustion won.

Margaret's wails echoed through the private ward for two solid hours.

Evelyn sat motionless in the VIP lounge, her porcelain face a mask of calm as Margaret's venomous words washed over her.

"You vile creature! This is the second time my son nearly died because of you!" Margaret's voice cracked with hysteria. "First that yacht explosion, now this? And you made him send Sophia away! What witchcraft have you cast on him?"

Harrison and Bennett exchanged uneasy glances at Evelyn's eerie stillness. She might as well have been carved from marble.

When Alexander Sterling arrived with Donovan, Margaret's tirade reached new heights. Alexander's glacial glare could have frozen hell over.

"Enough," William said firmly, placing a protective hand on Evelyn's shoulder. "You're coming home, darling. You haven't slept in forty-eight hours."

Evelyn lifted bloodshot eyes to her father. The hope in them had been extinguished.

Harrison stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood has remarkable resilience. The doctors confirmed only a concussion and fractured femur. He'll recover fully—but you need rest too, Ms. Sinclair."

The implication hung unspoken—Nathan would be devastated to see her like this.

Margaret stormed out, her Chanel heels striking the marble like gunshots. "Rest? How dare you think of resting when my son—"

Alexander cut her off with a voice like shards of ice. "Mrs. Blackwood, while we're grateful for your son's bravery, Evelyn didn't force him into that street. Your accusations are beneath you."

The temperature in the room dropped several degrees. Even Margaret hesitated, remembering too late the Sterlings weren't just wealthy—they were power incarnate.

"You—" she sputtered.

A harried doctor chose that moment to intervene. "For God's sake, the patient needs quiet!" He glared pointedly at Margaret. "This isn't a theater."

Alexander's smirk was razor-sharp. "Clearly some people care more about drama than their own family's recovery."

Margaret's face purpled with rage, but the doctor's warning stare silenced her. She collapsed onto a divan with theatrical flourish.

Alexander retrieved Evelyn's shattered phone from the side table, handing it to Bennett along with her Birkin. In one fluid motion, he pulled Evelyn to her feet.

"Home. Now." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn rose mechanically, casting a last glance at Harrison, who gave a subtle nod. He'd call if Nathan's condition changed.

Her smile was a ghost of its usual brilliance as she let herself be led away.
###Chapter 389 I Surrender

The car ride was tense.

William pulled out a thick envelope from the glove compartment. "The police provided these. They're conducting an official investigation, but we'll be running our own parallel inquiry."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she accepted the photos. The image of Nathan pushing her out of harm's way flashed before her eyes again.

How had he found the courage to charge toward a vehicle speeding at 70 mph?

Her knuckles turned white against the glossy prints.

Alexander exhaled heavily. "We owe Nathan Blackwood twice now. Evie, I don't think he'll ever let you go."

If Nathan could walk away from Evelyn, why would he repeatedly risk his life for her?

One incident could be dismissed as coincidence. But this pattern was impossible to ignore.

William massaged his temples. "He can't expect your devotion just because of this. Though I must admit, I'm starting to respect the boy. Your happiness comes first."

Evelyn bit her lip, her pulse stuttering as she studied the next photograph.

The driver's lifeless body slumped over the steering wheel - a completely ordinary face that would blend into any crowd.

Blood crusted his forehead where it had smashed against the wheel.

"Died on impact," Alexander explained, noticing Evelyn's frown. "Police initially ruled it drunk driving, but an overseas account transferred over a million dollars to him recently. They can't close the case yet."

"A million dollars?" Evelyn whispered. "For my life?"

The absurdity struck her - a million dollars to have Nathan die in her place.

Alexander's mouth tightened. "For a washed-up alcoholic, this was probably the only way he'd ever see that kind of money."

"Stay indoors for now," William interjected. "If you must go out, take security. Next time, you might not be so lucky."

His weary eyes darkened with concern.

Alexander nodded in agreement.

Evelyn straightened. "I can't live in hiding. Arrange for bodyguards."

She knew the drill.

All she wanted was the name of whoever wanted her dead.

They would pay tenfold.

Exhaustion overwhelmed her the moment she reached her bedroom. She collapsed onto the silk sheets, unconscious before her head hit the pillow.

When she awoke, golden light filtered through the trees outside her window.

The sunset painted the sky in fiery hues - breathtakingly beautiful.

She'd slept through an entire day.

A new phone waited on her nightstand. Alexander had transferred all her data and reinstalled every app.

Dozens of notifications lit up the screen.

Concerned messages. Questions about her wellbeing. Inquiries about Nathan's condition.

In her close friends' group chat:

[Isabella Montgomery: Okay, I've officially changed my mind about Nathan. Two life-risking rescues? You might want to reconsider @EvelynSinclair]

[Natalie Beaumont: Seconded.]

[Isabella Montgomery: No pressure though @EvelynSinclair! Even if romance isn't in the cards, we'll stop hating him.]

[Natalie Beaumont: What she said.]

[Isabella Montgomery: Can't you form your own opinions?! @NatalieBeaumont]

[Natalie Beaumont: Too lazy to type what you already articulated perfectly! @IsabellaMontgomery]

[Sebastian Hart: Nathan just earned my eternal respect. I officially surrender T_T]

[Isabella Montgomery: Sebastian, didn't you give up ages ago?]

[Natalie Beaumont: ^This.]

[Sebastian Hart: Fine! Leaving this toxic group now =P]
###Chapter 390 He's Gone

Evelyn Sinclair ignored all incoming messages. She took a long shower, applied a luxurious face mask, and emerged looking visibly rejuvenated.

William Sterling waited downstairs for his daughter to join him for dinner. His eyes followed every movement as Evelyn ate, exhaling in relief when she finished her bowl of soup.

"Evelyn, my dear," he began hesitantly, "you mustn't feel burdened by all this."

A practiced smile touched Evelyn's lips.

"I understand. I'll be fine. Nathan's out of danger now. I'll repay him for everything in due time." She paused, her voice dropping. "But the rest... I can't discuss it yet."

Strangely, Evelyn found she couldn't hate him as intensely as before.

The fleeting thought of reconciliation surfaced, but she dismissed it immediately.

All she truly wanted was for Nathan to recover.

Their history was too complicated, too entangled to determine who owed whom more.

William nodded approvingly, pleased his daughter had reached this clarity.

He gestured toward a towering figure in a tailored black suit and sunglasses who exuded intimidating energy.

"A bodyguard?" Evelyn recognized the professional attire instantly.

"Marcus," William confirmed. "Former special forces. He's been with me for years, but since I retired to fishing, he's been underutilized. He'll be your personal protection now."

Evelyn pressed her lips together but accepted her father's thoughtful gesture.

"Ms. Sinclair," Marcus greeted with a slight bow.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "I appreciate your service, Marcus."

The bodyguard's stern expression remained unchanged as he acknowledged her.

Suddenly, Evelyn's phone shattered the moment's calm. Harrison's name flashed on the screen.

She answered immediately.

"Ms. Sinclair, urgent news! President Blackwood—"

Harrison's hesitation made Evelyn's blood run cold. She ended the call and bolted for the door in panic.

Marcus had the car ready before she reached the driveway. "Get in!" he barked.

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

What should have been a twenty-minute drive became ten under Marcus's expert handling.

Evelyn sprinted to Nathan's hospital room, throwing the door open with trembling hands.

Neither Margaret Blackwood nor the elder Mr. Blackwood were present.

Harrison sat slumped in the visitor's chair, his face drawn. "Ms. Sinclair..."

Evelyn's heart plummeted as she rushed forward.

The figure on the bed lay motionless, just as he had yesterday—but now devoid of all vitality. His complexion had turned ashen, the medical monitors disconnected, his chest frighteningly still.

For a moment, Evelyn stood paralyzed as darkness threatened to consume her vision.

This couldn't be real.

The doctors had assured her he would recover!

Agony crushed her chest, making each breath painful. The anguish felt physical, as if her very cells were screaming in protest.

Her legs buckled as consciousness wavered.

Harrison lunged forward. "Ms. Sinclair!"

He caught her just in time.

At that moment, Evelyn noticed it—the faintest twitch beneath the hospital blanket. A nearly imperceptible movement of Nathan's right foot.

Her entire body stiffened with realization.

After several heartbeats, she regained her composure with startling speed.

Harrison blinked in astonishment at her sudden transformation from devastated to composed.

Evelyn approached the bed with measured steps. Her cool fingertips brushed Nathan's pale cheek.

In a voice like polished ice, she asked, "Have the funeral arrangements been made?"
###Chapter 391 Burn You

Harrison inhaled sharply at Evelyn's words, completely at a loss for how to respond.

But the man lying motionless on the hospital bed could no longer keep up the act. In the next second, he sat up abruptly.

"You're already planning my cremation?!"

Nathan's chest rose and fell rapidly, though it was unclear whether from lack of air or sheer fury.

He had barely survived a horrific car crash, only to nearly die from rage because of Evelyn.

When Nathan first regained consciousness, Harrison had painted a vivid picture of Evelyn's devastation—how she had wept, how desperate she had been.

Nathan had felt a surge of energy. Maybe this injury wasn't for nothing.

But he hadn't witnessed her grief firsthand.

So he decided to play dead.

Maybe this is my chance to win her back.

Yet the moment Evelyn saw him "lifeless," her first question was about funeral arrangements.

Nathan couldn't take it anymore.

Evelyn stood with her arms crossed, her expression unreadable as she studied him.

"Oh. So you're not dead?"

Nathan was speechless.

Not only had she failed to show the tenderness he'd hoped for, but she actually looked disappointed that he was alive.

His jaw clenched, his eyes reddening with a wounded expression. He stared at her silently.

Evelyn hesitated. A pang of bitterness twisted inside her. She dropped her mocking gaze.

"I'm glad you're alive, Nathan."

She was truly glad.

The moment the words left her lips, Nathan's face lit up. The storm in his eyes vanished instantly.

He reached out and yanked her into his arms.

Evelyn hadn't expected him to be so strong despite his injuries. Caught off guard, she stumbled against his chest.

The crisp, clean scent of him enveloped her. His heartbeat was steady and strong beneath her ear.

Her vision blurred before she could stop it.

She felt his arms tighten around her but didn’t pull away, afraid of aggravating his wounds. His fingers gently stroked her hair.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "I almost didn’t get to see you again."

That had been his greatest fear.

Silence stretched between them. His pulse quickened as he held her close.

Evelyn lifted her head and rolled her eyes.

"Are you done? Or do I need to force my way out?"

Reluctantly, Nathan released her.

He gave her a weak smile. "I’m no match for you right now..."

Ahem. Harrison stood awkwardly in the doorway, unsure whether to stay or leave.

Did they forget I’m still here?

Both turned to look at him. Nathan’s glare was sharp enough to flay skin.

Harrison’s lips twitched. "I didn’t do it on purpose!"

"Just pretend I’m not here!"

He ducked his head and made to leave, but Evelyn stopped him.

"Wait."

Here it comes. Harrison braced himself.

Evelyn took several deliberate steps back, putting distance between herself and Nathan.

Her gaze turned icy as she scrutinized Harrison.

"When you called me, you said there was bad news. What exactly did you mean?"

Harrison froze. He glanced at Nathan for help, but the man looked like he was perfectly content to let him take the fall.

Now I have to cover for him?!

Forcing a smile, Harrison stammered, "Oh! I—I didn’t get to finish! What I meant was—bad news, President Blackwood woke up and insists on checking out! Heh."

He mentally patted himself on the back for the quick save.

Evelyn arched a brow and turned to Nathan.

"You want to be discharged?"

Nathan paused, then nodded.

"It’s inconvenient to work here. I’d rather recover at home."

His tone was deadly serious.

Evelyn considered it. With round-the-clock care at Highland Estates, he might heal faster.

"Fine. Take care, then."

She made no move to stop him.
###Chapter 392 Bound by Duty at Highland Estates

Evelyn was about to leave when she felt a tug on her blouse.

Nathan sat propped up on the hospital bed, his movement strained. The simple act of reaching for her had cost him dearly.

A sharp pain shot through his right leg. His face drained of color as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Nathan!"

He clenched his jaw, veins protruding at his temples. The agony was written across his features.

"Get a doctor!" Evelyn turned to Harrison.

Harrison hesitated only a second before rushing out. Nathan hated seeing Evelyn so distressed.

With effort, he raised his hand to brush her cheek.

Evelyn froze but didn't pull away, afraid any movement might worsen his injury.

"It's... nothing," he managed through gritted teeth, forcing a reassuring smile that didn't reach his eyes.

Her heart clenched. She knew better than anyone how much pain he must be enduring.

Within moments, a team of specialists flooded the room.

Six white coats surrounded Nathan's bed.

Evelyn stepped back to give them space, though Nathan's gaze never left her.

She lingered by the doorway, typing rapid messages on her phone.

Ten minutes later, the examination concluded.

"Mr. Blackwood, the fracture in your right tibia requires significant recovery time. No weight-bearing activities for at least six months, or you risk permanent mobility issues."

The most severe injury from the accident, thankfully, was the broken leg.

Nathan merely grunted in acknowledgment.

The lead physician continued, "You'll need round-the-clock care during your rehabilitation. Without proper assistance—"

Nathan's dark glare silenced the doctor mid-sentence.

The medical team retreated quickly, Harrison following them out.

Now alone, Evelyn noticed the metal brace encasing Nathan's lower leg for the first time.

Her stomach twisted, though her expression remained neutral.

"I'll arrange for a private nurse."

"Why not you?" Nathan's voice was deceptively light.

Her eyes narrowed. "Excuse me?"

His smile turned wolfish. "This injury is your responsibility, Evelyn. Or have you forgotten already?"

Any gratitude she felt evaporated instantly.

Typical Nathan—give him an inch and he'd take a mile.

She rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. "Dream on."

"Care for me, and we'll call it even." His tone shifted. "Unless you'd rather explain to your father why the Blackwoods are demanding marriage to settle this debt... again."

The air between them turned to ice.

After this second life-saving intervention, William Sterling would have no grounds to refuse.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

One rescue might be repaid in other ways. But two? Society would brand the Sterlings as ungrateful.

And old Mr. Blackwood was nothing if not persistent.

Evelyn's expression cycled through several emotions before she exhaled sharply.

"Fine. Until you're healed."

The words tasted bitter, but the alternative was worse.

She couldn't bear owing Nathan any more than she already did.

His triumphant smirk made her regret the decision immediately.

"But you're staying at the hospital where—"

"Highland Estates," Nathan interrupted firmly. "We're going home."

Home. The word hung between them like an accusation.

Highland Estates—their former marital residence. The place she'd fled after their divorce, the place he'd stubbornly remained.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Damn her quick tongue. She'd walked right into his trap.
###Chapter 393 The Lady Returns

Evelyn Sinclair intended to return to Highland Estates to gather her belongings while informing her father and brothers about this decision.

Nathan Blackwood immediately instructed Harrison to initiate the discharge process, eager to recuperate in the comfort of his own home.

Despite his injuries, he displayed more energy than usual.

Harrison efficiently completed the discharge formalities and arranged for a thorough cleaning of Highland Estates.

Nathan personally inspected every corner of the mansion in his wheelchair, scrutinizing the cleanliness with meticulous attention.

Beatrice, the housekeeper who had served since before the divorce, remained employed because Nathan believed Evelyn was accustomed to her presence.

Beatrice trembled under Nathan's icy, critical gaze when he questioned her.

"Are Lady Sinclair's possessions still here?"

"Y-Yes, sir," Beatrice stammered. "You explicitly ordered that none of the lady's belongings should be discarded."

Nathan nodded approvingly before turning to Harrison.

"Contact the major fashion houses to deliver new collections. Remove all out-of-season clothing, shoes, and handbags from the dressing room. I don't want her distressed upon seeing them."

Harrison nearly rolled his eyes. In his opinion, it was Nathan who couldn't bear the sight of those reminders.

But he merely nodded obediently. "Understood, sir."

At Sterling Manor...

When Evelyn mentioned her plan, Lucas Sterling nearly exploded with rage. "Absolutely not! I forbid it!"

In Lucas's view, Nathan clearly harbored ulterior motives.

William Sterling studied his daughter carefully. "Are you certain about this?" Evelyn gave a firm nod. Alexander remained silent, knowing his sister's stubborn nature once she made up her mind.

"Father! Alexander! How can you just agree like this? Have you no spine?" Lucas glared at them in disbelief.

Alexander shot him a cool glance. "Then perhaps you'd like to personally care for Nathan in Evelyn's stead?"

"In his dreams! If I go there, I'll throw him down the stairs and finish what the accident started!" Lucas fumed, steam practically rising from his head.

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Don't overthink it. I'm not going as his caretaker. Besides, Marcus will accompany me."

The three men looked at her with newfound admiration, giving simultaneous thumbs-up.

Their concern was touching but unnecessary.

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly.

Nathan hadn't specified anything about bodyguards.

She packed only a small suitcase, prepared to leave immediately if uncomfortable. She had no intention of playing nurse.

Marcus, however, arrived with an enormous trunk, his expression grim as he waited by the entrance.

Evelyn blinked in surprise but held her tongue.

Perhaps his luggage contained an arsenal?

Marcus offered no explanation. His instincts warned this wouldn't be a short visit, so he came prepared for an extended stay.

At Highland Estates...

Evelyn wore a simple pastel dress that accentuated her graceful figure. Marcus stood imposingly behind her, effortlessly carrying both suitcases while radiating an intimidating aura that kept bystanders at bay.

Evelyn expected to feel hatred returning here, but standing at the threshold, she felt only detachment. Her last visit seemed like another lifetime.

That chapter was closed forever.

Marcus knocked, and the door opened immediately.

Before Evelyn could enter, Beatrice rushed forward excitedly, grasping her hands.

"My lady! You've finally returned! I've missed you terribly!"

Disgust flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she swiftly withdrew her hands. In an instant, Marcus stepped between them.

His massive frame shielded Evelyn completely. "Step back," he growled. "She's not your lady anymore."
###Chapter 394. Your Room

Beatrice gasped when she saw the intimidating Marcus blocking her path. Her hands trembled as she instinctively stepped back.

"W-Who are you?" she stammered.

Marcus didn't bother with introductions. He shoved the door open forcefully.

With a deep, commanding voice, he announced, "Miss Sinclair, after you."

Evelyn walked past without sparing Beatrice a glance. There was no point pretending sentimentality.

The woman had always been Nathan's spy anyway.

Ignoring the nanny's nervous expression, Evelyn strode inside confidently.

Her designer heels clicked sharply against the polished hardwood floors. The sound echoed through the grand foyer.

In the living room, Nathan sat in his wheelchair wearing light gray loungewear. His pale complexion couldn't hide his striking features.

The cast on his right leg made him appear vulnerable, softening his usual intimidating presence.

When he saw Evelyn, his grip tightened on the wheelchair arms. His eyes brightened instantly.

"Evelyn," he said softly, almost reverently. "You're finally home."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she scanned the room. Then her expression froze.

Everything remained exactly as she'd left it.

Not a single item out of place. The entire space gleamed spotlessly.

She looked away abruptly, narrowing her eyes.

"I'll take my things to the guest room first."

Turning sharply, she motioned for Marcus to follow upstairs.

"Let Beatrice handle that," Nathan interjected, frowning. "You shouldn't be carrying your own luggage."

His sharp gaze landed on the trembling nanny.

Beatrice jumped to attention, rushing forward to take the suitcase from Marcus.

"Allow me, Mrs. Blackwood. Your room is ready, just as you left it."

Marcus shifted away, blocking her with a warning glare.

Beatrice withdrew her hand nervously, glancing at Evelyn for direction.

But Evelyn wasn't looking at her. Instead, she fixed Nathan with a sideways glance.

"What's this about?"

Did he expect her to sleep in their old bedroom?

Nathan pressed his lips together before answering gently, "The guest room isn't prepared yet. Your old room has all your belongings. It would be inconvenient to move everything."

Evelyn didn't care enough to argue. She'd only be staying temporarily anyway.

She arched one perfect eyebrow. "Fine."

Her easy agreement visibly brightened Nathan's mood. A rare smile touched his lips.

As Evelyn ascended the stairs with Marcus, Beatrice called out hesitantly, "Mrs. Blackwood—"

Evelyn stopped mid-step. When she turned, her gaze could freeze fire.

"Nathan Blackwood," she said icily, "I came here out of mutual respect and a shred of guilt. But if your staff oversteps again, consider our arrangement terminated."

Mrs. Blackwood? As if she'd ever want that title again.

She wouldn't tolerate repeated disrespect.

Though the words weren't directed at Beatrice, they struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's tone cut sharper than any blade.

Nathan's smile faltered briefly before he recovered smoothly. "Understood," he murmured pleasantly.

The moment Evelyn turned away, Nathan's expression darkened. His glare at Beatrice could have turned wine to vinegar.

The nanny trembled violently. What had she done wrong? Evelyn used to insist on being called Mrs. Blackwood.

Back when no one in the Blackwood household respected her, Beatrice had addressed her as "Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn had thrown a fit, accusing her of deliberate disrespect.

From then on, Beatrice had reluctantly used the formal title.
###Chapter 395 Take Care of You

The Highland Estates mansion stood elegantly with its two-story structure, flooded with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows.

A discreet elevator connected both levels, ensuring Nathan Blackwood's wheelchair access remained effortless throughout the property.

Evelyn Sinclair ascended the stairs and paused in the doorway of her former bedroom.

Everything remained frozen in time—the ivory silk bedding, the crystal perfume bottles on the vanity, even the novel left splayed on the nightstand.

Memories crashed over her like icy waves.

Her chest constricted painfully, as if an invisible hand squeezed her ribs with cruel precision.

She used to perch on that balcony chaise for hours, foolishly hoping to spot Nathan's black Maybach turning through the wrought iron gates below.

He never came.

Not once in three years.

The room smelled faintly of the jasmine perfume she'd favored back then—now the scent made her nauseous.

Evelyn's lips twisted into a humorless smile as she grabbed a wastebasket. With one sweeping motion, she cleared the vanity of all trinkets, listening to them clatter against the metal interior.

The walk-in closet revealed racks of designer clothing with tags still attached, shelves of Italian leather shoes in her exact size, and a glass case displaying diamond jewelry worth more than some houses.

She shut the door without touching anything.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Beatrice, the housemaid, stood wringing her hands near the intimidating figure of Marcus—Evelyn's personal bodyguard.

"Ms. Sinclair," Beatrice stammered, "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence for dinner."

Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch. "Tell him I'll be down shortly."

The maid scurried away as Evelyn descended the grand staircase, her stiletto heels clicking like a metronome against the marble steps.

Golden hour painted the living room in warm hues, the sheer drapes fluttering like ghosts against the evening breeze.

Nathan sat at the dining table, closing his laptop as she approached. A cashmere throw draped over his legs did nothing to diminish the powerful lines of his broad shoulders.

"Hungry?" His voice was deep velvet.

In the kitchen, Beatrice whispered loudly enough to be heard, "Chef prepared all your favorites, Ms. Sinclair. Lobster thermidor, truffle risotto, that chocolate soufflé you—"

"I don't eat dinner." Evelyn settled into her chair opposite Nathan. "But do ensure Marcus gets a proper meal."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he noticed the hulking bodyguard positioning himself behind Evelyn's chair. Marcus stood motionless, his alert gaze continuously scanning the room despite his neutral expression.

"Your watchdog can take the night off," Nathan said smoothly. "You're perfectly safe here."

Evelyn flipped open a fashion magazine with deliberate disinterest. "Marcus stays. Consider him part of the decor if his presence bothers you."

A muscle ticked in Nathan's cheek. He reached for his wineglass, the crystal catching the candlelight. "Since you're here to care for me," he murmured, lips curling at the edges, "why don't you demonstrate by feeding me?"

His challenge hung in the air between them, thick as the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from the kitchen.

Evelyn slowly lowered her magazine.

Across the table, Nathan's storm-gray eyes gleamed with something dangerous.

And for the first time since her return, Evelyn felt the faintest spark of something other than resentment.

It terrified her.
###Chapter 396 Granting Every Wish

The atmosphere grew thick with tension.

Nathan knew he was testing his luck, but if he didn't take this chance, how would he ever discover the truth?

Evelyn hesitated briefly. She rested her chin on her palm, studying him with amusement dancing in her eyes.

A delicate smile played across her lips.

Yet her voice remained cool and detached when she finally spoke.

"Did your brain get injured along with your arm?"

Her smile never reached her eyes, yet it was impossible to resist its charm.

Seeing she wasn't angry, Nathan's grin widened. He immediately adopted a self-mocking tone.

His voice dropped to a regretful murmur.

"Are you really going to abandon me so quickly? Can't you do this one small thing for me?"

Evelyn's eyebrow twitched imperceptibly. What was wrong with this man? If he weren't injured, she'd have left him in the dust already!

Why was she still here enduring this ridiculous performance? His acting skills were atrocious!

She turned away with an exasperated sigh. Just bear with it a little longer.

In the next instant, Marcus stepped forward and picked up the soup bowl in front of Nathan.

"Mr. Blackwood, allow me—"

Marcus held the spoon to Nathan's lips with a terrifying scowl that contrasted sharply with his gentle actions.

He was feeding Nathan like an infant.

Marcus even exaggeratedly opened his own mouth, making an "ahh" sound as if teaching a toddler to eat.

Silence descended upon the dining room.

Evelyn couldn't contain her laughter any longer.

Nathan's expression froze into something decidedly unpleasant.

But as Evelyn's bodyguard, Marcus couldn't care less about Nathan's feelings.

Within seconds, Nathan's mouth twitched. He reached out to take the bowl from the bodyguard's hands, his voice icy.

"My arms work perfectly fine. I'll feed myself."

Marcus wisely retreated behind Evelyn, standing guard like a stone sentinel.

After that incident, Nathan behaved much better, finishing his meal quietly with his head bowed.

Evelyn focused on responding to urgent emails from Bennett on her phone.

She didn't notice Nathan's lingering gaze fixed upon her.

After sending her replies, she set the phone down and looked up at him.

"Finished?"

Nathan nodded, his eyes softening with warmth.

Evelyn stood to clear the dishes when Nathan caught her wrist, giving her a helpless look.

"I didn't invite you here to be my maid."

Beatrice emerged from the kitchen immediately. "I'll take care of this, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn arched a brow. She hadn't wanted to do it anyway.

Nathan patted his wheelchair, his gaze steady. "Let's go to the study."

Evelyn could handle small favors like this, so she moved behind him to push the wheelchair.

He could easily maneuver it himself, but having her do it filled him with quiet satisfaction.

Evelyn rolled her eyes discreetly as she guided him toward the elevator.

He probably had work to attend to in the study.

She made a mental note to go out with Isabella and Natalie later that evening.

In the second-floor study, Nathan studied Evelyn intently.

"There are too many confidential company documents here. Have your bodyguard wait outside."

Evelyn shrugged. "Fine."

Without needing instruction, Marcus took his position by the door.

Evelyn pushed Nathan inside. The study had transformed dramatically since her last visit.

Originally two adjoining rooms, the space had been nearly empty when only Evelyn used it.

Now floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes.

Neatly categorized files occupied the arched shelves flanking the room. A massive rectangular desk dominated the center, bearing two laptops and scattered documents.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a peaceful glow across the space.

Evelyn paused momentarily before continuing to push him forward.

Nathan stopped her, pointing toward the tatami area across the room. "Over there..."
###Chapter 397 You're Sick

The tatami stretched wide beneath them, the room bathed in perfect ambient lighting.

Evelyn Sinclair carefully maneuvered Nathan Blackwood's wheelchair into place, suppressing an exasperated sigh. This man is nothing but trouble.

"What else do you need?" she asked, her tone clipped.

Nathan tilted his head, his expression stubborn. "I don't want to sit here. Move me over there. It's more comfortable."

He hated being confined to the wheelchair.

Evelyn paused, her brows knitting together. "I can't lift you," she stated bluntly.

Not unless she wanted to risk paralyzing him for good.

She was convinced he was just being difficult on purpose.

With a frustrated sigh, Nathan braced his hands on the armrests, shifting his weight onto his left leg. Every muscle in his body strained with the effort.

Just that small movement sent beads of sweat forming along his temple.

Evelyn's instincts kicked in before she could think. She lunged forward, catching him before he could topple over.

His full weight pressed against her, making her breath hitch. His scent—clean, crisp mint—wrapped around her, dizzyingly close.

When she glanced up, she found his gaze filled with quiet guilt. The sharp retort on her tongue died instantly.

He wouldn’t be in this state if he hadn’t saved her.

She was being petty.

So instead, she steadied him silently, carefully lowering him onto the tatami, mindful of his injured leg.

By the time he was settled, both of them were breathless, their skin damp with exertion.

Despite the pain etched across his face, his eyes remained soft, almost tender.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tell me which files or laptop you need."

Before she could turn away, Nathan's fingers circled her wrist.

"No need," he murmured. "Just watch a movie with me."

His other hand reached for the remote. With a single press, the lights dimmed, the curtains slid shut, and a screen descended from the ceiling.

Evelyn froze.

All this trouble—just to watch a movie?

She whirled on him. "Nathan Blackwood, you're insufferable!"

Nathan merely smirked, his expression infuriatingly innocent.

"But I am sick," he pointed out.

Evelyn scoffed, yanking her hand free. "Watch it yourself."

"The doctor said I need relaxation and happiness to recover faster," he called after her.

Her steps faltered. Damn it. Did he really say that?

Nathan held out the remote. "You pick."

He remembered how unimpressed she’d been with his horror movie choice last time.

Evelyn snatched it from him, scrolling through the extensive library—new releases, classics, even unreleased films. Impressive, but unsurprising, given his investments in the industry.

She selected The Silent Dawn, a quiet, introspective drama, before tossing the remote aside and sitting as far from him as possible.

The space between them could fit two more people.

Nathan didn’t seem to mind. His lips curved slightly, contentment softening his features. Just having her here was enough.

Evelyn hugged a pillow, her expression relaxed as she skimmed the film’s synopsis.

Julian Moreau had a supporting role, but his presence was magnetic, stealing every scene he was in.

She focused on the screen, but the weight of Nathan’s gaze made her skin prickle. She shot him a glare.

"Aren’t you going to watch?"

Nathan blinked, feigning innocence before reluctantly turning back to the screen.

Then Julian appeared, and his jaw tightened.

A familiar, unwelcome tightness settled in his chest.

He closed his eyes instead, listening to the steady rhythm of Evelyn’s breathing.

Over an hour later, Evelyn was fighting off drowsiness. She glanced over—Nathan was already asleep, his arms crossed, his brow slightly furrowed even in rest.

She rolled her eyes. He insisted on this, and now he’s out cold.

Abandoning the film, she slipped out barefoot, careful not to wake him.

Her bodyguard stood sentinel outside. She pressed a finger to her lips before padding downstairs.

The lower floor was dim, seemingly empty.

But as she reached the kitchen, hushed whispers reached her ears.

"Yes, they’ve been upstairs for over an hour. Who knows what they’re doing?"
###Chapter 398 Eavesdropping

Nathan Blackwood had explicitly instructed me not to disturb them upstairs. Evelyn Sinclair was giving him the cold shoulder, but I could tell it was all an act. She was clearly playing hard to get.

The housekeeper, Beatrice, deliberately lowered her voice to a whisper.

Click. The kitchen lights suddenly flickered on.

Beatrice jumped in surprise, her phone clattering to the floor in panic.

In that brief moment before the screen dimmed, Evelyn caught the name displayed on it.

Margaret Blackwood.

So she was reporting to Nathan's mother? Evelyn's lips thinned.

Beatrice trembled visibly, her eyes wide with fear as she stammered, "M-Ms. Sinclair! W-what are you—"

Evelyn cut her off with an icy glare, her dark eyes devoid of any warmth.

She wordlessly retrieved a carton of milk, poured herself a glass, and left without another glance.

Beatrice's hands shook as she picked up her phone. Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, an uneasy feeling settled in her stomach.

Evelyn sipped her milk as she ascended the stairs, finishing it just as she reached the study door.

The earlier encounter left a bitter taste in her mouth.

This wasn't the first time. Beatrice had been planted here as Margaret's spy, monitoring Evelyn's every move and ensuring she performed her wifely duties perfectly.

Those dress shirts Nathan never wore still had to be immaculately pressed. The mansion's cleanliness fell solely on her shoulders. Even their meals had to follow Margaret's approved recipes.

Beatrice had been the watchful eye reaping the benefits of Evelyn's labor.

After all this time, Margaret still wants to control me? Some things never change.

Evelyn pushed open the study door with more force than necessary, making sure it made noise.

Nathan, who had been resting on the chaise lounge, startled awake.

"Going to bed?" Evelyn's tone was clipped, her mood noticeably darker than when she'd left.

Nathan rubbed his eyes, his voice rough with sleep. "Did I doze off? You should rest. Harrison will be sending over some documents later."

Evelyn arched a brow. Of course Nathan wouldn't neglect his responsibilities. The Blackwood Empire would always come first.

"Fine. I'm going to my room then." She slipped on her shoes. "Don't call me if you need anything. Actually, don't call me even if you do."

Nathan's lips quirked in amusement as he watched her leave.

The door slammed shut behind her.

Nathan's smile faded, his chest tightening uncomfortably.

Earlier, Evelyn had tiptoed out barefoot to avoid waking him.

Now she made sure he knew she was leaving.

Back in her room, Evelyn locked the door and spent the next few hours laughing with Isabella and Natalie over video call until late into the night.

It was nearly midnight when Nathan finished reviewing Harrison's documents.

Fatigue weighed heavily on him, but the thought of Evelyn resting just next door lifted his spirits.

He wheeled himself to her room, only to freeze at the sight before him.

His breath caught painfully in his chest.

Marcus, Evelyn's personal bodyguard, had set up camp directly outside her door.

The military-grade sleeping arrangement was alarmingly thorough—practical, efficient, and clearly meant for long-term use.

The massive man completely blocked access to Evelyn's room.

Nathan approached with a scowl. "Was the guest room not to your liking?" His voice dripped with barely concealed irritation.

Marcus didn't even bother standing, leaning casually against the wall with one knee bent. His challenging stare never wavered. "I'm not a guest. Where Ms. Sinclair goes, I go."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I need to check on her."

The unspoken command was clear: Move.

"Ms. Sinclair is asleep," Marcus stated flatly.

"According to who?"

After a beat of silence, Marcus replied, "Chairman Sterling's orders. No one enters the young mistress' room without her explicit permission."

Nathan's retort died on his lips.

With William Sterling's name invoked, he knew better than to argue.
###Chapter 399 Wrong Prescription

Back in Nathan's suite, rage burned through him so intensely that sleep was impossible.

He had hoped this would be his chance to reconnect with Evelyn, but Marcus's constant presence ruined everything.

The frustration was suffocating.

Dawn arrived after a restless night. Evelyn hadn't slept well either, blinking awake as morning light filtered through the curtains.

A sharp knock interrupted the quiet.

Evelyn murmured acknowledgment, and Marcus immediately ceased knocking.

After dressing in a cream silk blouse and tailored pencil skirt, she descended the grand staircase. The faint shadows under her eyes softened her usual icy demeanor.

Nathan brightened instantly when she entered the dining room, having waited there since sunrise.

"Good morning, darling."

Evelyn nodded absently while pouring coffee. "Sleep well?"

Nathan's gaze flickered toward Marcus with clear resentment. "Not particularly."

Marcus's scarred face twisted into a deeper scowl.

Evelyn glanced between them. "Leg injuries often disrupt sleep. Nothing unusual."

Nathan choked on his orange juice.

Beatrice emerged from the kitchen balancing a tray of Evelyn's favorite breakfast items. "Ms. Sinclair, I prepared everything just how you like it." Her hands trembled slightly.

Evelyn set down her untouched fork, suddenly remembering. "Oh! I forgot to remind you about your medication yesterday."

Nathan arched an elegant brow. "And how do you plan to make amends?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn retrieved an assortment of pills from the medicine cabinet and dumped them into his palm. "Consider this yesterday's dose with interest."

Nathan swallowed them obediently, making Beatrice's eyes widen comically.

Evelyn grabbed her purse. "Off to work."

"At least eat something first," Nathan coaxed.

"My brother brought homemade pastries from Sterling Manor," she called over her shoulder.

The hit-and-run investigation remained stalled since the driver lingered in critical condition.

After a productive morning at the office, Evelyn returned to Highland Estates for an afternoon rest.

The mansion stood eerily quiet.

She awoke groggily to golden afternoon light streaming through the windows. Stretching, she headed downstairs for water and to remind Nathan about his next dose.

She wondered if the special supplements she'd mixed in had improved his condition yet.

As she ascended with her water glass, angry whispers erupted from the staff quarters below.

"That Sinclair woman refuses everything I make! Does she think I'll poison her?" Beatrice hissed.

Evelyn froze on the staircase, then deliberately settled on the steps to listen.

The daily report to Margaret was always entertaining.

"Of course she does nothing for Mr. Blackwood! We should be grateful he's not waiting on her hand and foot!"

Evelyn smirked just as Nathan's wheelchair approached silently from behind. She pressed a finger to her lips.

Nathan raised an eyebrow at finding his ex-wife eavesdropping with such enthusiasm. With an imperceptible nod, Marcus positioned the wheelchair for optimal listening.
###Chapter 400 Burning With Rage

The most unforgivable part was that Beatrice had completely forgotten to administer Mr. Blackwood's medication yesterday.

This morning, she'd forced him to take double the dosage like some careless executioner.

That woman was pure evil. She probably wanted revenge on him. "Madam, if that viper marries into this family again, she'll destroy everything!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. The initial spark of joy in his eyes was swiftly extinguished, replaced by an icy storm. Dangerous shadows danced across his chiseled features.

His knuckles turned white where they gripped the wheelchair. Veins bulged along his forearms as he fought to control his temper.

Evelyn sat composed on the marble steps, listening to the tirade as if it were some distant gossip. A frosty smile played on her lips.

Her calmness was a blade slowly carving out his heart.

Nathan had believed bringing her back would erase the painful past. That they could create new, sweeter memories to atone for his mistakes.

Yet this was the reality.

Evelyn listened to those venomous words without flinching, as though she'd expected nothing less.

If Beatrice - someone supposedly trustworthy - spoke this way, what horrors had Evelyn endured daily during those three years here?

Nathan couldn't bear to imagine. Beatrice was Margaret's creature. Given Margaret's hatred for Evelyn, what other torments had she orchestrated?

Since last night, he'd witnessed Evelyn's emotions shift from disgust to indifference, then cold detachment, finally settling into utter disdain.

Each transformation was another twist of the knife in his chest. The pain was unbearable.

Finally, Beatrice ended her poisonous call.

Evelyn rose gracefully, blinking in confusion at Nathan's thunderous expression.

Why was he so furious? He wasn't the one being maligned. As she moved to pass him, Nathan seized her wrist, his voice rough with emotion.

"Evelyn, are you angry? Tell me how to punish her."

Would vengeance ease her pain? Could it erase three years of suffering?

The thought shamed him. Maybe it wasn't too late. Maybe she truly didn't care.

Evelyn's lips curved into that chilling smile. "Angry? This is who she's always been. Didn't you all know that?"

"You all?" The words struck like a physical blow. Even the old injury in his right leg throbbed in response.

To her, he was no different from Margaret. Just another tormentor.

Evelyn believed Nathan had never protected her. Never cared.

She'd survived alone while he considered her a burden.

Hadn't that always been the truth?

Today's revelation was merely the surface of her suffering.

When Evelyn tried to leave again, Nathan clung desperately, his eyes burning with remorse. The weight of his guilt could have drowned them both.

But Evelyn remained unmoved.

She'd learned not to play with fire.

As Nathan opened his mouth, Marcus abruptly pulled his wheelchair back, forcing him to release Evelyn's arm.

Marcus shoved the wheelchair aside and followed Evelyn without a backward glance.

Nathan sat frozen, speechless.

Upstairs, Beatrice heard the commotion and sighed in relief when she saw only Nathan.

"Mr. Blackwood, how may I serve you?"

Nathan turned slowly. The lethal sharpness in his gaze made Beatrice tremble.

"You're being transferred abroad immediately. To learn basic decency."

Beatrice gasped. "Sir, what have I done wrong? I can't leave!"

She earned thirty thousand monthly here for minimal work, plus bonuses. No other household offered such luxury.

Her thirty-year contract with the Blackwoods meant she had no choice. Their word was law.
###Chapter 401: Whose Warning Counts?

Beatrice's blood ran cold. Mr. Blackwood wanted to ship her off to the Philippines? Compared to her current workload, that would be absolute torture! Would she ever make it back? Had he overheard her phone conversation earlier?

A wave of panic surged through her entire body, making her knees tremble violently.

She knew exactly how smitten Nathan was with Evelyn these days. And Nathan always kept his promises.

With shaking hands, Beatrice dialed Margaret Blackwood, sobbing hysterically into the phone.

Within forty-five minutes, Margaret stormed into Highland Estates like a hurricane.

Coincidentally, she nearly collided with Evelyn in the foyer, who was just heading out for some shopping.

Margaret barged in, her face twisted with fury. Without hesitation, she jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You scheming witch! You're divorced yet still clinging to my son? We offered reconciliation, but you played hard to get! Now look at you - how low will you stoop?"

Evelyn's gaze turned arctic. Just as expected - Margaret remained utterly despicable.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Evelyn said icily, "I suggest you mind your language. My patience has limits, regardless of your age."

Margaret's face purpled with rage. The audacity! The lack of respect!

She'd grown accustomed to bullying Evelyn in the past. Never had she imagined the mouse would roar back. Now she found herself powerless against Evelyn's retaliation.

What galled Margaret most was that someone like Evelyn dared defy her at all.

Beatrice rushed to Margaret's side, tears streaming. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood wants to exile me to the Philippines! You must intervene!"

Margaret scoffed, patting Beatrice's shoulder. "Don't fret, dear. No one's sending you anywhere while I'm here. You'll stay right where you belong." She shot Evelyn a venomous look. "Even if certain people find your presence... inconvenient."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Was Margaret suffering from persecution complex? Did she honestly believe Evelyn had demanded Beatrice's removal?

But Evelyn couldn't be bothered to explain. She certainly wouldn't waste another second on this bitter old crone.

Adjusting her purse strap, Evelyn turned toward the exit.

Margaret, however, wasn't finished. She blocked Evelyn's path. "Listen here, Evelyn Sinclair—"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Yes?"

"I'm warning you—stay away from my son! Do you think we're all blind to your schemes?"

Evelyn laughed coldly. "What schemes would those be?"

"You're trying to poison him! Forcing experimental drugs down his throat! I'm watching your every move!"

"Who exactly are you watching?" Nathan's voice cut through the tension like a blade. Harrison stood grim-faced behind him.

Margaret brightened instantly. "Nathaniel! This woman—"

"I warned you before." Nathan's voice could have frozen hell over. "One more incident like this, and Sophia won't see America for another decade."

Margaret paled. "I'm only protecting you!"

"Save it." Nathan's jaw clenched.

Margaret pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn. "Didn't you hear how she spoke to me? Should I kneel and kiss her feet now?"

Evelyn's laughter dripped with contempt. "Mrs. Blackwood, I've shown remarkable restraint. The days when you could walk all over me are over. Frankly, you should be grateful I haven't retaliated for past... indiscretions."

Margaret vibrated with rage. "How dare you! My son crippled his leg saving you!"

"Yes, your son saved me." Evelyn tilted her head. "But what does that have to do with you? Should I grovel before you? You certainly seem to enjoy flaunting your self-importance."

"Evelyn Sinclair, you—"

"Actually, Mrs. Blackwood..." Evelyn's gaze slid to Beatrice. "Perhaps we'll cancel the Philippines plan. There are far more... creative solutions available."

Her tone carried lethal sweetness.

Beatrice turned ghost-white.

With a final mocking smile, Evelyn strolled past them. "What a delightful way to ruin a perfectly good afternoon."
###Chapter 402 Retribution Came Swiftly

Margaret Blackwood lost all reason. "Get that woman out of here! I won't allow this relationship to continue!"

Nathan Blackwood's voice turned glacial. "My personal affairs are none of your concern."

Margaret's teeth ground together violently. "How dare you defy your own mother?"

Nathan's gaze remained impassive.

Since being sent abroad for special training at age five, Nathan would call Margaret whenever homesickness struck. Yet his mother, preoccupied with shopping sprees, would dismiss him impatiently - telling him to endure it and grow stronger.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

Margaret would then inform Old Master Blackwood about these secret calls, ensuring Nathan received brutal punishments as consequence.

"Now that I'm grown, she believes she can control me?" Nathan's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "How utterly absurd."

"If you're expelled from the Blackwood family, consider our mother-son relationship terminated."

Margaret's entire body convulsed violently, her complexion draining to ghostly white.

Never in her wildest nightmares had Margaret imagined hearing such words from her son.

Nathan schooled his features into neutrality, his brow smoothing as his gaze softened upon Evelyn Sinclair's retreating figure.

The naked longing in his eyes was impossible to miss.

Margaret felt her sanity crumbling. "My daughter's gone. My son rejects me as his mother. And now that wretched Evelyn dares look down on me? Me - the matriarch of the Blackwood dynasty!"

Tremors of rage wracked her body.

"This is all Evelyn's fault! Without her interference, everything would remain unchanged."

A single obsessive thought consumed her - Evelyn must disappear.

Margaret's wild eyes landed on the fruit knife resting in the bowl. Decision crystallized.

She seized the blade recklessly and charged forward.

Nathan jolted upright, but searing pain in his right leg immobilized him. "Evelyn! Behind you!"

Evelyn had just begun turning when Marcus yanked her sideways with lightning reflexes.

"Die, you bitch!"

Margaret's shriek pierced the air as she lunged with bloodshot eyes. Evelyn barely dodged the glinting steel.

The deranged woman swung wildly before tripping catastrophically.

The knife plunged deep into her own abdomen.

Crimson bloomed instantly across her designer blouse.

Evelyn stared, momentarily stunned, as the light rapidly faded from Margaret's eyes.

Beatrice rushed over hysterically. "Madam! Speak to me!"

Nathan's expression oscillated between shock and fury.

Marcus wordlessly opened the car door for Evelyn. "Watch your head, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn lowered her gaze and slid inside silently.

Marcus turned back toward the chaos. "The dashcam captured Mrs. Blackwood's attempted assault. Regardless of her injuries, Miss Sinclair retains full legal rights to pursue charges."

This single statement preempted countless future complications.

Kneeling beside Margaret, Beatrice gaped at them in horror.

Margaret's grotesque expression contorted, but she lacked strength for further venom.

The engine roared to life.

Evelyn leaned back, eyes closed in the plush seat.

Marcus broke his usual silence. "Shall I arrange your return to Sterling Manor?"

Evelyn's nose wrinkled. "Not yet. Fleeing would imply guilt. They're the ones at fault here."

She wanted no part of this drama. Margaret had chosen this confrontation deliberately.

The abdominal wound wasn't fatal - just excruciating with significant blood loss.

"Serves her right," Evelyn thought without an ounce of remorse.
###Chapter 403 Seeking Professional Advice

Highland Estates

Nathan Blackwood sat motionless in his wheelchair by the grand entrance, his face ashen. His gaze followed the flurry of activity as medical personnel carefully loaded Margaret Blackwood into the waiting ambulance. The commotion around him felt muffled, distant.

Was he grieving?

Not exactly.

He was simply... stunned.

The realization that his own mother had harbored such intense hatred for Evelyn Sinclair—enough to attempt murder—left him reeling. All those years of dismissing her subtle jabs had allowed this venom to fester unchecked.

Harrison finished coordinating with the medical team and turned to find his boss still frozen in place. The usually formidable CEO of Blackwood Enterprises looked uncharacteristically vulnerable in his wheelchair, yet the dangerous aura surrounding him remained undiminished.

"Sir," Harrison approached cautiously, "the doctors confirmed it's just blood loss. No life-threatening injuries."

Nathan's fingers tightened around the wheelchair's armrests. His obsidian eyes darkened further, becoming utterly unreadable.

"Send the housekeeper to our Manila estate," he finally spoke, his voice glacial. "Permanently. As for my mother..."

A bone-chilling pause.

"Once she's stabilized, transfer her to Silver Pines Sanatorium. No discharge without my explicit authorization."

Harrison's breath caught. He understood the unspoken sentence—this was effectively a gilded prison.

Had he not received the bodyguard's report detailing Margaret's violent outburst, he might have protested. But seeing Evelyn's bloodied form being carried out earlier... No, Nathan's reaction was justified.

"Understood, sir."

After a weighted silence, Harrison ventured, "Do you think... Ms. Sinclair will return?"

Nathan's jaw clenched. That very fear had been gnawing at him since the ambulance doors closed behind Evelyn. If she walked away now, he might never get another chance.

"Perhaps you could call later? Ask about dinner preferences?" Harrison suggested. "We could have her favorite delivered."

Nathan's piercing gaze snapped up. "Since when do you give dating advice?"

Harrison risked a smile. "Sir, even CEOs need wingmen. With Ms. Sinclair's security detail, we should consider... professional reinforcements."

"Get to the point."

"My cousin Teddy—used to be a divorce lawyer, now runs a high-end matchmaking service. He's got a gift for reconciliation cases. If you're open to..."

Nathan's expression darkened visibly.

A matchmaker?

The idea of the mighty Nathan Blackwood requiring relationship counseling was laughable. The business world would have a field day with this.

Harrison paled as Nathan's glare intensified. This gamble might cost him his six-figure salary.

"Fine." Nathan's abrupt agreement startled him. "But if this backfires, you're both unemployed."

Harrison barely suppressed a gulp. Now he was staking his career on Teddy's questionable charm?

"Discreetly," Nathan added sharply. "Have him pose as my new butler. And Evelyn must never know his real profession."

As Nathan wheeled himself toward his study, Harrison stood dumbfounded.

Nathan Blackwood had actually agreed to relationship counseling.

Desperation indeed made strange bedfellows.
###Chapter 404 The Matchmaker Arrives

Nathan's fingers flew across his phone screen as he dialed Harrison's cousin without hesitation.

Less than twenty minutes later.

A rotund man weighing well over 100 kg stood before Nathan, his round face splitting into a grin so wide his eyes nearly disappeared.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. His sharp gaze flicked between Harrison and the beaming stranger.

Cousin?

Before Harrison could explain, the man burst into enthusiastic speech, droplets of spit flying as he gestured wildly. "Mr. Blackwood, no need for formalities! Call me Teddy—Theodore Winslow, at your service!"

He clapped his hands together. "Matchmaking is my passion! One month to rekindle the spark, three months to deepen the connection, and I guarantee you'll be remarried within a year!"

Teddy spoke with such conviction that Nathan found himself momentarily stunned.

The sheer audacity of this man should have made Nathan throw him out immediately.

Yet...

Against all logic, Nathan hesitated.

Harrison shot his cousin a frantic look, silently begging him to tone it down. If Teddy oversold and failed, they'd both be unemployed.

A heavy silence settled over the study.

Nathan tapped his fingers against the mahogany desk. "You were a white-collar worker before this. Why the career change?"

Teddy's cheerful demeanor faltered. His shoulders slumped dramatically, his entire body jiggling as he stomped his foot like a petulant child.

"Because..." He pouted. "Every time I went to the company cafeteria, there was never enough food left for anyone else!"

Nathan blinked.

"My boss said I was great at my job, but my food expenses canceled out my profits!" Teddy huffed. "They just wanted an excuse to fire me!"

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose.

He exhaled sharply. "What's your success rate?"

Teddy perked up instantly. "You and Ms. Sinclair are my first clients!" He beamed. "But I’ll give it my all!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. His icy glare shifted to Harrison.

"I'm a test subject?"

Harrison wished the floor would swallow him whole.

Teddy, oblivious, clapped his hands. "So, when do I start?"

Nathan's voice was glacial. "One-day probation."

He should have thrown Teddy out right then.

But the man cheered as if he'd won the lottery. "Perfect! I'll start cooking dinner!"

Harrison barely escaped the room before Nathan's murderous stare could incinerate him.

Alone in his study, Nathan dragged a hand down his face. "I've lost my mind."

The scent of roasted herbs and spices soon filled the mansion.

Teddy knocked on the study door, grinning like a fool. "Mr. Blackwood, call Ms. Sinclair! Invite her for dinner!"

Nathan's phone lay untouched on the desk.

His fingers twitched.

How could he even begin to explain this absurd situation to Evelyn?

Teddy winked. "Don’t worry—I’ll handle it!"

Before Nathan could protest, Teddy whipped out his phone.

Beep. Beep.

The call connected.
###Chapter 405 The Uninvited Guest

The phone rang twice before a crisp female voice answered. "Who is this?"

"Ms. Sinclair? This is Teddy, the new butler at Highland Estates." His voice was sheepish. "I accidentally knocked over your skincare collection while cleaning your room. Mr. Blackwood insisted I discard everything and replace it, but... I can't read half the labels."

Evelyn's icy tone sliced through his rambling. "Don't you dare throw them out! I'm coming home right now. If a single bottle is missing, you're fired!"

In the study, Nathan's brow furrowed. He heard every word through the door.

That easy?

Evelyn wasn't just wealthy—she was particular. Her skincare regimen was custom-formulated for her complexion, each set costing more than most people's annual salaries. Where exactly did they plan to find replacements?

Idiots.

Her earlier resolve to never return to Highland Estates evaporated. Right now, all that mattered was salvaging her precious collection.

She grabbed her purse and stormed out with Marcus in tow.

At the estate's entrance, Evelyn hesitated.

The marble floor where Margaret had collapsed in a pool of blood hours earlier now gleamed spotlessly. As if the entire confrontation had never happened.

She wasn't about to reopen that wound. Nathan had saved her too many times to count. Pushing the matter further would only strain relations with the Blackwoods.

The door swung open before she could knock. A rotund man with flushed cheeks barreled out, panting.

"Ms. Sinclair!" His beady eyes crinkled with delight. "I'm Teddy! My word, you're even more stunning in person—like a goddess descended from Olympus! No magazine cover could do you justice—"

Evelyn froze. Years of etiquette training hadn't prepared her for this onslaught of unsolicited praise.

Behind her, Marcus cleared his throat pointedly.

"Oh! You must be the legendary bodyguard!" Teddy gushed, turning his admiration elsewhere. "That aura! Those shoulders! I heard you've won three national championships—absolute perfection!"

Marcus looked ready to strangle him.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "Where on earth did Nathan find you? You're... one of a kind."

She strode inside before Teddy could shower her with more compliments.

Nathan sat in the living room reviewing documents, his usual mask of calm indifference in place. At the sound of footsteps, his lashes lifted slightly. The ghost of a smile touched his lips.

"You're back."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. How could he act so nonchalant?

Before she could speak, Nathan continued smoothly, "The maid has been permanently dismissed. As for my mother..." His jaw tightened. "The doctors suspect underlying mental health issues. Once she's stabilized, she'll be transferred to a private facility. This won't happen again."

His voice was low, threaded with an apology he couldn't voice outright.

Margaret was still his mother. Blood ties bound him in ways ethics couldn't sever. The best he could offer was ensuring their paths never crossed again.

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Finally, Evelyn gave a soft, humorless laugh. "How pragmatic of you, Mr. Blackwood. Aren't you going to scold me for provoking her?"

Nathan's smile turned self-deprecating. "You only spoke the truth."

There was nothing to forgive.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her shoulders relaxing. "Then let's consider the matter closed."

Nathan's head snapped up, disbelief flickering in his eyes. He hadn't expected her to concede so easily.

Behind them, Teddy clapped his hands in delight. "This calls for celebration! I've just prepared a divine low-calorie stew—would you care for a bowl?"

His exuberance shattered the tension like a hammer through glass.
###Chapter 406 The Ultimate Flatterer

Harrison's cousin, Teddy, was determined not to miss this golden opportunity to bring these two together.

Nathan stared at Teddy with an unreadable expression, completely speechless.

Marcus rolled his eyes dramatically, refusing to even glance in Teddy's direction.

Evelyn's lips twitched with amusement. "Mr. Blackwood, I see you've... adjusted your hiring standards?"

Nathan's inner circle consisted of nothing but the best in their respective fields.

Teddy, with his round physique, didn't seem to fit Nathan's usual preferences. By all accounts, he should've been eliminated during the first round of interviews.

Miracles do happen.

Nathan pressed his lips together, searching for an explanation, but Teddy beat him to it with a beaming smile.

"Ms. Sinclair, I got in through connections!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Whose?"

Teddy leaned in conspiratorially. "I'm Harrison's cousin. But shhh—don't tell anyone. The gossip would be unbearable!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Your secret's safe with me."

So he's Harrison's relative? I never realized Nathan valued his assistant so highly... Interesting.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly remembered why she'd returned.

"My belongings—"

"All safely returned to their proper places! You'll find everything exactly as you left it."

Evelyn exhaled in relief, her expression softening noticeably.

Nathan observed her from the dining table, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

So she's not completely indifferent after all. At least she cared enough about those cosmetics to come back for them.

Evelyn caught his gaze and narrowed her eyes. "What's so funny?"

Despite his portly appearance, Teddy moved with surprising agility.

Within minutes, he'd arranged an assortment of light, flavorful dishes before Evelyn—each beautifully presented and perfectly balanced.

Evelyn sampled each dish and finished her soup with appreciation.

Nathan's eyes warmed as he watched her eat, his own appetite improving significantly.

Teddy swelled with pride. All those grueling culinary courses and nearly bankrupting his mentor's restaurant through "quality testing" had finally paid off.

As the two ate in comfortable silence, Teddy launched into his flattery campaign.

"Mr. Blackwood is truly remarkable. Working through illness shows incredible dedication—a quality we should all aspire to emulate. Don't you agree, Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn, caught off guard, glanced up at Nathan across the table. "Absolutely."

Nathan, who'd been enjoying his meal, nearly choked. His expression darkened immediately. I was about to make his position permanent for his cooking skills, but this idiot is testing my patience!

"Men like Mr. Blackwood are rare these days. Most crumble under pressure, but not our Mr. Blackwood! He leads by example—a true paragon of masculinity!"

A violent coughing fit erupted from the kitchen—Marcus apparently drowning on water.

Teddy rushed to his aid. "Marcus! Are you alright?"

"No."

"Here, have some water!"

Teddy thrust a glass at him, but Marcus waved it away fearfully.

At the table, Evelyn smirked at Nathan. "Paragon of masculinity, hmm? Quite the title."

Nathan closed his eyes, radiating mortification and icy displeasure.

Evelyn stood with an amused smile, heading upstairs while thinking, This chubby charmer is something else. What an outrageous brown-noser.

"Ms. Sinclair, wait! I haven't finished! If you're looking for a man, you should—"

"Enough!" Nathan finally snapped.
###Chapter 407 Ms. Blackwood

Evelyn Sinclair lounged on the second-floor balcony, the golden hues of sunset painting her face as she sipped from a delicate porcelain teacup.

The warmth made her eyelids heavy. Just as she began to drift, the faintest creak of footsteps reached her ears.

Her brow furrowed. Teddy?

"Ms. Sterling, you're absolutely brilliant! You knew it was me without even turning around." His voice was honeyed with admiration. "Your composure is remarkable—so unlike other women. I've brought you some fresh fruit. Was dinner to your liking tonight?"

Teddy fidgeted, his fingers twisting together. "Mr. Blackwood personally selected the menu. I... I wasn't sure if it would suit your tastes. This is my first day, you see. I'd hate to lose this position over something as trivial as dinner. Especially with my culinary credentials—"

Evelyn's smile froze at the edges.

Nathan had chosen those dishes? She had assumed it was mere coincidence that every course matched her preferences. How would he even know?

A strange tightness coiled in her chest.

The more effort Nathan poured into these gestures, the more it unsettled her.

She exhaled, smoothing her expression. "I'm not particular about food. Prepare whatever you wish."

After all, Evelyn rarely ate much here. If the meals became unbearable, she could always retreat to Sterling Manor.

Teddy opened his mouth to press further, but Evelyn set down her cup with a decisive clink.

"I nearly forgot—I'm meeting friends for shopping tonight. Leave the door unlocked for my return."

"Shopping? Allow me to carry your bags!" Teddy's eyes lit up. Gaining her trust would make his... other duties far simpler.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "That won't be necessary. Marcus is accompanying me."

——

Inside the glittering mall, Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont lounged in massage chairs, waiting.

Evelyn arched a brow at their relaxed poses. "Evening shopping sprees? Has your schedule become this packed?"

Natalie rolled her eyes. "We're saving you from wallowing in that mausoleum of yours. Who knows what might happen if you're alone with Nathan Blackwood day and night?"

Isabella nodded vigorously. "Speaking of, I heard that witch Margaret was hospitalized?"

Evelyn settled beside them, lips quirking. "Your intelligence network impresses me."

Marcus maintained a discreet distance, close enough to intervene if needed but far enough to grant privacy.

The women dragged Evelyn through designer boutiques, arms laden with shopping bags.

"Of course I know," Isabella huffed. "My uncle runs that hospital. They wheeled her in covered in blood, and she woke up cursing your name. Strangest part? Not a single Blackwood visited her." She studied Evelyn. "Did you have a hand in that?"

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "She earned it. That blade was meant for me. Marcus took it instead."

A weighted silence fell.

Isabella linked arms with her abruptly. "Enough gloom. Tell me—has Nathan tried anything since you moved in to 'nurse' him?"

"He's wheelchair-bound. What exactly could he do?"

"Good." Isabella squeezed her arm. "We may not approve of reconciliation, but we acknowledge his... efforts this time."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, smiling faintly. Suddenly, Natalie gasped, yanking her sleeve.

"Look who's here!"

They turned to see a uniformed woman kneeling on the polished floor, scrubbing vigorously. All three froze.
###Chapter 408 A Wave of Puffery Before Bed

The trio blinked in disbelief.

Had they really just seen who they thought they saw?

Isabella was the first to break the stunned silence. "Sophia Blackwood has been missing for months, and she's been right here under our noses this whole time? How did no one recognize her?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, equally surprised.

Though Sophia's forced smile and stiff posture as she knelt to help a customer with their shoes were painfully obvious, she did look healthier than before.

It was just... jarring.

No one could have predicted that the once-arrogant heiress would end up working as a retail clerk.

How could Nathan Blackwood allow his sister to stoop to this?

Natalie whispered, "Should we go say something?"

Evelyn shook her head, but Isabella was already dragging them forward.

"Absolutely."

Sophia finished with her customer and immediately bowed to greet the new arrivals.

When she looked up and recognized them, her face twisted with fury.

"What are you doing here? Get out!"

Ah. Some things never changed.

Isabella smirked. "We're shopping, obviously. The real question is—what are you doing here, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia's face flushed with rage, but when her gaze landed on Evelyn, she visibly swallowed her temper. Nathan's warnings clearly still held weight.

"None of your business. Either buy something or leave."

Evelyn tilted her head, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"Did your brother banish you here to learn humility?"

Sophia's hands clenched into fists. "This is your fault! How dare you even—"

"Me?" Evelyn laughed lightly. "You earned this all on your own. Don't blame me for your consequences."

The store manager, sensing wealthy customers, hurried over with a practiced smile.

"Sophia, are these friends of yours? Do you need assistance?"

Before Sophia could respond, Isabella pointed at several displays. "That one, that one, and those over there—wrap them all up."

Sophia's jaw tightened as she glared at Evelyn.

She didn’t move.

The manager nudged her sharply. "Hurry up! You’ve only sold one pair this month. Do you want to keep your job?"

Sophia gritted her teeth. "I’ll be right with you."

Evelyn waved a hand. "No need for fittings. We’ll take everything she picked. I’d rather not stay another minute."

Sophia eyed her suspiciously.

The manager beamed. "Oh! You must be here to support her! How kind—"

Evelyn cut her off with a laugh. "We’re not her friends. But by all means, give her the commission. Good luck hitting your quota."

Sophia’s face darkened as the manager eagerly rushed to process the sale.

Isabella pouted. "Why let her off so easy? After everything she’s done?"

Evelyn shrugged. "I’m done wasting energy on the Blackwoods. As long as she stays out of my way, she can hate me quietly."

Besides, seeing the proud Sophia reduced to servitude was satisfaction enough.

The trio continued shopping, leaving with armfuls of bags before parting ways at nightfall.

Outside the mall, Evelyn handed her purchases to Marcus.

Back at Highland Estates, the lights were still on.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, the rich scent of chocolate filled the air.

Teddy bounded out of the kitchen, spoon in hand.

"Ms. Sinclair! You’ve been busy! Next time, take me with you—I have excellent taste!"
###Chapter 409 Sleeping in the Same Room

Evelyn inhaled deeply, catching the rich aroma wafting through the air. "What's that delightful smell?" she asked.

"I prepared hot chocolate using Amedeis 70% dark chocolate. The texture is absolutely divine. You must try it!" Theodore beamed with pride, his round cheeks flushing pink with excitement.

He immediately began pouring the steaming liquid into delicate porcelain cups. "Would you care for some?"

The irresistible scent made Evelyn nod eagerly. "Is Mr. Blackwood resting?"

"Mr. Blackwood is currently in his study attending a video conference." Theodore sighed dramatically while adjusting his bowtie. "A man of his stature - wealthy, powerful, yet still so dedicated - is truly one in a million!"

Marcus stood rigidly by the doorway, his muscular frame casting a long shadow across the marble floor.

"Theodore, would Marcus like some too?" Evelyn suggested after taking her first sip, savoring the velvety smoothness. "This is exceptional."

Marcus turned his chiseled profile away, his expression unreadable. "No thank you. He can keep it."

Undeterred, Theodore waddled over with surprising speed for his size and practically shoved the reluctant bodyguard toward the table. The effort left the plump butler panting, tiny beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Now now, no need for formalities! I've already indulged while preparing it." Theodore punctuated his statement with an exaggerated burp that made Evelyn stifle a laugh.

After finishing her drink, Evelyn rose gracefully. "Don't let this go to waste. I'm retiring for the evening. You both should get some rest as well."

Theodore waved enthusiastically, his multiple chins wobbling. "Such a refined, compassionate lady like Ms. Sinclair is a rare treasure indeed!"

Evelyn quickened her pace upstairs before Theodore could continue his effusive praise.

Turning to Marcus, Theodore opened his mouth to deliver another compliment, but the bodyguard downed the chocolate in one gulp and stalked off without a word, his scowl deepening.

Theodore examined the empty cup with admiration. "Even the way you drink hot chocolate exudes such masculine energy, Marcus!"

If Theodore hadn't been Nathan Blackwood's personal butler, Marcus would have tossed the irritating man out the nearest window.

Passing the study, Evelyn paused briefly when she heard Nathan's voice flowing in perfect French, the rich baritone sending an unexpected shiver down her spine. The melodic rhythm of the foreign language suited him surprisingly well.

What a captivating sound.

Choosing not to disturb him, Evelyn continued to her room. Before bed, she video-called Alexander, William, and Lucas.

Meanwhile, Marcus unrolled his military-grade sleeping bag outside Evelyn's door with practiced efficiency. Just as he settled in, a loud thump announced Theodore's arrival as he dramatically spread out his pink floral bedding right beside him.

The contrast between Marcus's utilitarian setup and Theodore's frilly ensemble was almost comical. When Theodore lay down, his considerable girth completely blocked Marcus's view of the hallway.

Marcus glared daggers at the intruder. "What exactly are you doing here?"

"Keeping watch over Ms. Sinclair, of course." Theodore adjusted his sleeping mask with a self-satisfied smile. "You're still a man, after all. Can't be too careful about these things. Ms. Sinclair wouldn't stand a chance against someone of your... physical attributes."

He patted Marcus's shoulder reassuringly. "Don't fret, I don't snore or grind my teeth."

With that, Theodore turned away and promptly fell asleep.

Marcus clenched his jaw, watching in disbelief as Theodore began emitting soft snores within seconds. The urge to kick the rotund nuisance down the stairs was overwhelming, but the logistics of moving 100kg of dead weight deterred him.

Thus, two very different men found themselves keeping vigil outside Evelyn's door.

Ten minutes later, Theodore's gentle snores escalated into thunderous rumbles that jolted Marcus fully awake. The rhythmic vibrations continued at a volume that would put a chainsaw to shame.
###Chapter 410 Bathe Him

Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

His knuckles turned white as he struggled to contain his rising temper.

Evelyn couldn't take the noise anymore and swung the door open, only to find two men sprawled across her doorway. She blinked in disbelief.

"Teddy?"

Marcus's jaw was clenched so tight it looked painful. "Miss Sinclair, you should go back inside and rest."

Evelyn let out a quiet laugh and shook her head.

"I can't sleep with all this racket."

It was so loud that Lucas had texted asking if she was hosting a midnight concert.

The walls were practically vibrating!

Marcus finally snapped and kicked Teddy's leg.

Teddy jolted awake, eyes wide with alarm before immediately putting on his most earnest expression.

"Ms. Sinclair! You're still awake? Don't worry—I won't let any harm come to you. As long as Marcus stays out here, so will I!"

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose.

She gave Marcus a pleading look.

"Just go sleep in the guest room. I'll be fine."

Marcus opened his mouth to argue but knew better than to disobey.

Here he was—a former special forces operative—being outmaneuvered by this human golden retriever.

Grumbling under his breath, Marcus gathered his bedding and stalked off. Teddy scrambled after him, suddenly wide awake.

"Wait up! Let's share a room! I promise I won't snore or sleepwalk this time!"

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the hallway finally fell silent.

Then the study door creaked open.

Nathan wheeled out, looking exhausted. His usually sharp features were softened by fatigue.

"You're back," he murmured, voice rough.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Problem?"

"Aren't you supposed to be taking care of me? Shouldn't you ask how I'm feeling today?"

His tone was quieter than usual, lacking its usual edge. Almost... vulnerable.

Something twisted in Evelyn's chest despite herself. She kept her expression neutral.

"Mr. Blackwood, how are you feeling today?"

Nathan's lips quirked. "Better now that you're here."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She'd long since grown immune to Nathan's smooth talk.

The moment he recovered, she was leaving and never looking back.

"I'm going to bed. Goodnight."

"Wait." Nathan caught her wrist. "I need help bathing."

Evelyn froze. "Excuse me?"

Had she heard that correctly? He wanted her to—

Nathan sighed, the picture of helplessness. "The doctor said my right leg can't get wet. It's... difficult to manage alone. Unless you want my injury to worsen and keep you here indefinitely?"

Damn him for sounding so reasonable. The innocent look on his face made Evelyn feel like she was overreacting.

"Fine. I'll change and meet you there. You can undress yourself—your hands work perfectly fine, don't they?"

Nathan's eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning.

"I'll be waiting."

That deep, velvety voice sent an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

As Evelyn retreated to her room, she remembered Teddy's earlier advice to Nathan: "Mr. Blackwood, a man's greatest assets are his wealth and sex appeal. Since Ms. Sinclair has plenty of money..."

Apparently, Nathan had taken those words to heart.

Shaking her head, Evelyn fired off a quick text to Marcus before heading to what promised to be the most awkward bath time of her life.
###Chapter 411 The Unexpected Bath Attendant

Nathan Blackwood maneuvered his wheelchair toward the marble-clad bathroom.

Since his leg injury, he'd taken to wearing loose-fitting pajama bottoms for easier mobility. His fingers hovered over the waistband before deciding against removing them entirely.

Better not push his luck too far.

If Evelyn Sinclair got spooked by his forwardness, she might bolt from Highland Estates altogether.

Nathan examined his bare torso in the full-length mirror with approval. His sculpted chest tapered into defined abdominal muscles that flexed subtly with each breath. The usual icy demeanor softened into something more approachable.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's advice echoed in his mind.

"Mr. Blackwood, with a physique like yours, no woman could resist. During the bath, let Ms. Sinclair admire the view without distraction. If she gets flustered, that's your cue to proceed."

Nathan remained skeptical but willing to experiment.

The bedroom door creaked open moments later.

He schooled his features into practiced nonchalance, running fingers through his dark hair to create artful disarray.

Footsteps paused outside the bathroom.

Three sharp raps on the door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Nathan's pulse quickened despite himself.

"Evelyn? I'm in here. Come straight in."

He inhaled deeply, forcing his expression into calm indifference while keeping his eyes shut. Don't screw this up.

Teddy's words returned. Just relax and let her enjoy the show.

Water splashed against porcelain as someone adjusted the faucet.

Gentle hands draped a towel over his injured leg to protect it from moisture. The care in each movement suggested Evelyn's presence.

Nathan kept his eyes closed but his breathing grew uneven.

A warm, damp cloth glided across his shoulder blades.

Every muscle in his body tensed involuntarily.

The towel traced the contours of his arms with featherlight precision.

Nathan clenched his jaw, the only sounds being running water and his own thundering heartbeat.

The charged silence stretched between them, broken only by synchronized breathing and water droplets.

Something felt... off.

Why wasn't she speaking? Where were the expected nervous giggles or awkward small talk?

Teddy had assured him: "Ms. Sinclair will babble nervously when confronted with your naked torso. Just give monosyllabic responses to keep her off-balance."

But this silence... Was she overwhelmed? Aroused? Or-

The towel disappeared abruptly, leaving his skin pebbled with goosebumps.

A gruff male voice spoke behind him, holding up two shower gel options. "Ocean Breeze or Sandalwood?"

Nathan's spine went rigid. His eyes flew open to meet Marcus's stoic reflection in the mirror. The bodyguard stood with sleeves rolled up, revealing corded forearms.

Every fantasy of seduction evaporated. Nathan's injured leg trapped him in this nightmare.

"Why. Are. You. Here." Nathan ground out between clenched teeth.

All that tension. That anticipation. For his wife's bodyguard?!

"Where's Evelyn?"
###Chapter 412 Let's Try That Massage Again

Marcus's muscular shoulders flexed as he draped another towel over Nathan. His massage techniques were shockingly professional!

If Marcus hadn't spoken, Nathan would never have guessed it was Evelyn's personal bodyguard giving him this intimate treatment.

Nathan's jaw clenched in irritation. The thought of another man's hands on his bare skin made his stomach churn with discomfort.

Marcus remained expressionless as he explained, "Ms. Sinclair specifically instructed me to bathe and massage you."

Though Marcus felt awkward performing such personal services, the household only had two other male staff. The elderly butler Archibald was snoring too loudly to be disturbed, even when Marcus kicked his chair.

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. His chest rose and fell rapidly as he gripped the wheelchair handles until his knuckles turned white.

Marcus hesitated before reaching for the body wash. The mint scent seemed more appropriate than the strawberry-flavored alternative for this situation.

Just as Marcus pumped the gel onto his palms, Nathan's voice cut through the steamy bathroom like a blade.

"Get out!" Nathan ground out between clenched teeth.

Even the chill of the bathroom couldn't cool the fire of humiliation burning through him at Marcus's touch.

Marcus blinked in confusion. "But Mr. Blackwood, you seemed to be enjoying it earlier?"

He held up the bottle uncertainly. "Ms. Sinclair's orders..."

Nathan's glacial stare could have frozen lava. "Do I need to repeat myself?"

Marcus set down the toiletries with a shrug. If the man wanted to refuse help, so be it.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathan exhaled sharply. Three agonizing minutes passed before he regained composure. Where was that meddling butler when needed?

Wrapping himself in a plush robe, Nathan wheeled into the bedroom - and froze.

Evelyn stood by the doorway, exchanging a nod with Marcus before entering. Water droplets glistened on Nathan's exposed collarbones, trailing down his sculpted chest.

Evelyn's lips curved as her gaze traveled over him. "Satisfied with Marcus's service, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's entire body tensed. He needed another shower immediately.

His voice dripped with barely contained fury. "Care to explain this, Evelyn?"

This wasn't at all what he'd envisioned when she offered to care for him.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with mischief. "While I'm here to assist you," she emphasized, "we are divorced. Certain boundaries must be maintained."

The word "divorced" struck Nathan like a physical blow. The light in his eyes dimmed instantly.

Watching her smirk, Nathan tasted bitter defeat. This crushing helplessness was unfamiliar territory.

Evelyn continued mercilessly, "Unless you want rumors spreading? How would we ever remarry others then?"
###Chapter 413 Fickle Hearts

Evelyn Sinclair had perfected the art of striking where it hurt most—especially when it came to Nathan Blackwood. The satisfaction was intoxicating.

Her fingers lingered on the doorknob as she flashed him a deliberately indifferent smile.

"Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood."

She didn't wait for his reply.

The message couldn't be clearer. If he chose to play dumb, she had plenty of other ways to shatter his illusions.

His tactics were so painfully outdated.

Nathan's stormy gaze followed her retreating figure.

Each word had pierced like shards of glass. The pain was excruciating, yet he couldn't blame anyone but himself. He deserved every ounce of this agony.

The Preston Sinclair project specifications had been finalized—an ambitious endeavor expanding their AI research. Kingsley Tech's involvement became essential after their groundbreaking medical AI announcement catapulted them to global acclaim.

Though Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Enterprises dominated the AI market, complacency wasn't an option. Competitors lurked at every corner, ready to pounce on any weakness.

Evelyn's proposal to accelerate development by sharing resources with Kingsley Tech made strategic sense. She'd discussed it with Alexander Sterling at dawn, receiving his immediate approval.

Wider distribution meant fewer enemies.

The inevitable involvement of Blackwood Enterprises? Merely an advantageous bonus given their formidable resources.

Morning mist clung to Highland Estates as Evelyn selected a fitted black dress adorned with pearl accents—professional yet striking, mirroring her razor-sharp confidence.

"Divine!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow gasped as she descended the staircase. "You're absolutely radiant this morning! The sunlight makes you look like a masterpiece come to life!"

Evelyn nearly missed a step, gripping the banister. Marcus stood rigid nearby, his scowl telegraphing disdain for Teddy's theatrics.

Nathan sat at the breakfast table in black lounge wear, every inch the composed aristocrat. Last night's tension might as well have never happened.

"Good morning," he said warmly, watching her approach.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Morning."

How predictably mercurial men could be.

Teddy had outdone himself with breakfast—an extravagant spread spanning three continents. Everything smelled divine.

Since Nathan wasn't addressing last night's awkwardness, neither would she. Let him stew in his discomfort.

She sampled each dish with genuine appreciation before a thought struck her.

"Incidentally, I ran into Sophia Blackwood while shopping last night."

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "I know. The boutique manager informed me."

His calm response begged the question—how had his mother appeared there so conveniently?
###Chapter 414 She Only Cares About Appearances

Nathan Blackwood ate his sushi with deliberate slowness. His long fingers moved with refined precision, each motion carrying an understated elegance.

His voice held a chilling detachment.

"I'm simply showing her the fastest way to learn humility."

Evelyn Sinclair frowned, not comprehending his meaning.

Nathan elaborated patiently. "She used to look down on everyone. Never imagined she'd be serving others one day. This is character building."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched in sudden understanding.

Though for Sophia Blackwood, this punishment seemed excessively harsh.

Unlike ordinary people struggling to make ends meet, Sophia had been coddled since birth.

Evelyn sighed inwardly. If Nathan could be this ruthless to his own sister, she shouldn't trust his occasional displays of vulnerability.

Then again, spoiled brats like Sophia were a dime a dozen. The Blackwood fortune could support her indefinitely - Nathan was only doing this because of Evelyn.

Finishing her meal quickly, Evelyn headed to the office.

Only Nathan and Teddy Winslow remained at Highland Estates.

Teddy's eyes sparkled as he asked excitedly, "Mr. Blackwood, how did last night go?"

At the mention, Nathan lost his appetite entirely.

His gaze turned glacial as he glared at Teddy. With a cold snort, he wheeled himself back to the study.

Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn instructed Bennett to contact Preston Sinclair to confirm Kingsley Tech's involvement before coordinating with Dominic Kingsley for follow-up arrangements.

To avoid running into Nathan at Highland Estates, Evelyn decided to handle this personally.

The three parties agreed to finalize details at Kingsley Tech. Preston wanted to better understand their new partner, so he took the opportunity to tour their R&D department.

For the afternoon meeting, Evelyn arrived early with her new project assistant, Benjamin Carter.

Benjamin was a fresh graduate still doing his internship, chosen over more experienced candidates precisely because he had no connections. His clear, ambitious eyes showed no trace of greed.

Most importantly, Benjamin would treasure this opportunity - a fast track compared to climbing the corporate ladder step by step.

Thus, he was perfect for this project.

Dominic Kingsley prepared a temporary office. Upon arrival, Evelyn and Benjamin met with Preston's team.

The meeting was scheduled for 3:00 PM.

Noticing Benjamin behind her, Dominic raised an eyebrow. "Bennett didn't come?"

He'd assumed Evelyn wouldn't trust such an important project to anyone else, especially a newcomer.

Evelyn replied smoothly, "He's handling other matters. This is my new assistant, Benjamin Carter."

Dominic nodded. "Mr. Blackwood still holds shares in Kingsley Tech, so a representative from Blackwood Enterprises will attend."

Exactly as Evelyn expected. She nodded calmly.

After all, Nathan was recuperating at home - no chance he'd show up.

A knock interrupted them. Preston Sinclair stood at the door.

"Ms. Sterling, Mr. Kingsley. Am I interrupting?"

Evelyn smiled. "Welcome-"

Her greeting froze mid-sentence when she saw the bouquet of white chrysanthemums in Preston's hands.

Dominic looked equally startled.

Preston carried himself with aristocratic poise and mysterious elegance. The funeral flowers looked grotesquely out of place.

What fresh hell is this? Evelyn thought. First the father, now the son bringing me mourning flowers. Do they want me dead?
###Chapter 415 His Sense of Crisis

Evelyn Sinclair bit back her words, maintaining a polite smile.

Preston Sinclair noticed the subtle shift in her expression and offered a charming smile in return.

"Oliver asked me to give this to you," Preston said, his tone light. "He insisted you'd love it, though I have my doubts."

With a careless flick of his wrist, Preston tossed the bouquet of white chrysanthemums onto the edge of the table before extending his hand toward Dominic Kingsley.

What was I thinking, trusting that boy’s taste? Preston mentally scolded himself. Since when does Evelyn like white chrysanthemums?

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. Oh. So it was Oliver.

A pang of nostalgia hit her. It had been too long since she’d seen the boy.

Regaining her composure, Evelyn exchanged pleasantries with the others. Dominic took a brief phone call, murmuring a few words before hanging up.

"Let’s move to the conference room," Dominic announced. "Everyone’s waiting."

When Evelyn stepped inside, her breath caught.

Nathan Blackwood was here—in person.

Even seated in a wheelchair, his presence was commanding. The air around him crackled with authority, his sharp gaze sweeping over the room effortlessly.

Evelyn said nothing about his unexpected attendance. The meeting proceeded without a hitch.

This project was originally a collaboration between Sterling Corporation and Preston Sinclair. Though Kingsley Tech was involved, Dominic wouldn’t receive direct dividends. Still, the indirect benefits were substantial.

The meeting wrapped up swiftly.

Preston lingered afterward, wanting to discuss something privately with Evelyn. The two excused themselves to her office.

In the conference room, Nathan watched Evelyn’s retreating figure, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Dominic smirked. "Feeling threatened?"

Nathan shot him a glare. "Where’s the new assistant?"

Preston didn’t worry him—the man was still mourning his late wife and had returned to Montecito purely for business.

But that fresh-faced graduate hovering around Evelyn? That was a problem.

Earlier, when Dominic had called about the meeting, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow had warned him before he left: "Don’t give that kid an inch! Young, charming, knows how to sweet-talk—exactly the type women fall for. You need to put him in his place!"

Dominic leaned against the table, hands in his pockets, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"Mr. Blackwood," he teased, "I never took you for the jealous type."

With a lazy wave, Dominic summoned Benjamin Carter into the room.

Benjamin had assumed Evelyn needed him. Instead, he found himself facing two of the most intimidating men in Montecito.

The atmosphere was icy.

A recent graduate with little experience, Benjamin approached cautiously, clasping his hands in front of him and dipping into a respectful bow.

"Mr. Blackwood, Mr. Kingsley," he said nervously. "How can I assist you?"

Since he was assigned to this project, he had no choice but to comply with their requests.

Nathan sat motionless, his expression unreadable. Yet the weight of his gaze was suffocating, pressing down on Benjamin without a single word.

After a long silence, Nathan finally spoke.

"Your name?"

"Benjamin Carter, sir."

Nathan gave a faint hum, then lapsed back into silence.

The tension thickened.

Benjamin’s youthful face betrayed his confusion. Why am I here?

Minutes dragged by before Nathan spoke again.

"New to the workforce?" His voice was low, deliberate. "Bennett didn’t accompany Ms. Sterling today."

Benjamin nodded quickly. "Yes, sir. Bennett’s handling another project. I just joined last month."

His nerves made him overly compliant, answering every question without hesitation.

Nathan studied him for several seconds before his lips curled downward in disapproval.

"This project is critical," Nathan said coolly. "Don’t disappoint Ms. Sterling. You’re dismissed."

The dismissal carried the weight of a royal decree.

"Yes, sir."

Benjamin practically fled the room, his heart pounding. What was that about?

Dominic tapped his fingers against the table, grinning.

"That’s it?"
###Chapter 416: Such Menial Tasks

Dominic Kingsley thought he was about to witness an entertaining spectacle.

Nathan Blackwood shot him a frosty glare.

Evelyn Sinclair had standards—she wouldn’t spare a glance for insignificant underlings like that.

If Benjamin Carter had possessed even an ounce of composure and self-assurance, Nathan wouldn’t have let him off so easily.

Honestly, considering someone like him as competition was an insult to Evelyn.

Evelyn and Preston Sinclair had a seamless discussion, their perspectives aligning effortlessly on nearly every topic.

Nearly half an hour later, they finally stepped out of the office.

Since Preston still had work waiting at the hotel, Evelyn walked him out.

"Oliver hasn’t been around lately. Did the car accident scare him?" she asked.

Preston smiled politely. "He’s survived a bombing before—a little accident wouldn’t faze him. I’ve just assigned him several tutors. His schedule is packed with homework now."

Evelyn immediately understood.

"Poor kid. Childhood shouldn’t be this suffocating."

"If you want to see him, you’re welcome to visit the hotel anytime. He misses you," Preston added.

Evelyn nodded. "Perfect."

They stood in front of the elevator, waiting. Before the doors opened, Nathan’s voice cut through the silence behind them.

"Going home?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

He’s still here?

Preston offered a polite nod in greeting, which Nathan returned with equal formality.

Nathan’s gaze, however, remained fixed on Evelyn, his lips curling into a sly smirk.

"You’re free after this meeting, aren’t you? Let’s head back together."

His words carried a deliberate ambiguity.

Go home together? Evelyn stiffened slightly before glancing at her watch. Office hours were technically over.

"I still have—" she began reflexively.

"Teddy dropped me off and already left. You wouldn’t make me go back alone, would you?"

Nathan’s tone was light, but there was an unmistakable persistence beneath it.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Infuriating man.

The elevator arrived just then.

Preston lingered behind them like the perfect gentleman. Nathan made no move to wheel himself inside, instead tilting his head up at Evelyn with an expression that was equal parts innocent and pitiful.

Does he expect me to push his wheelchair in front of Preston? Or worse—have Preston do it?

The thought was absurd.

Both men carried themselves with too much pride. The balance would shatter the moment one yielded.

Evelyn couldn’t picture Preston pushing Nathan’s wheelchair, so with a quiet sigh, she stepped forward and guided Nathan inside, positioning herself behind him.

Nathan looked thoroughly pleased, his smile softening.

Two seconds passed. Preston still hadn’t entered.

He offered another polite nod. "I just remembered—I left that bouquet of white chrysanthemums behind. It wouldn’t do to leave them there. We’ll be in touch."

Nathan gave a slight, detached nod in return before pressing the elevator’s close button.

Evelyn barely suppressed a groan.

Silence settled between them as the elevator descended.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, quickly typing a message to Benjamin with a few reminders.

Marcus was waiting for her downstairs. The moment the elevator doors opened, he strode forward.

Evelyn stepped out—only for Nathan’s voice to stop her.

"Evelyn."

She’d nearly forgotten he was there.

He was waiting for her to push him out.

Evelyn paused, frowning. Just as she turned back, Marcus smoothly intervened.

"Miss Sinclair, allow me to handle such menial tasks."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn nodded approvingly and continued walking.

Marcus took over, pushing Nathan’s wheelchair at a brisk pace to keep up with her.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose, grinding his teeth.

If I’d known this would happen, I wouldn’t have dismissed Teddy so soon.

At Highland Estates, Evelyn headed straight to her room to organize her notes from the meeting, leaving Nathan with Marcus.

The house was immaculate as always. Teddy, clad in a frilly pink apron, rushed over the moment they entered.

"How do you manage to look so radiant even after a long day? I made you a nourishing vegetarian soup—low-calorie and delicious!"

His ingratiating smile left Evelyn utterly speechless.
###Chapter 417 The Relentless Warrior

Evelyn Sinclair offered a polite smile. "Thank you, but I'll be heading upstairs first."

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair!"

She was midway up the grand staircase when Marcus opened the double doors. A quick glance over her shoulder revealed Nathan Blackwood entering the foyer.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow practically vibrated with excitement as he greeted Nathan, his burgundy silk apron fluttering with each enthusiastic movement. "Mr. Blackwood! A man of your stature who works tirelessly yet maintains such impeccable charm is truly—"

"—the perfect match for Ms. Sinclair!" Teddy continued without pausing for breath. "Honestly, I'm at a loss for words to describe how perfectly suited you two are!"

Marcus had been following Evelyn upstairs but froze at Teddy's declaration. The bodyguard turned slowly, his scarred face twisting in contemplation.

"I believe there's only one appropriate description," Marcus rumbled.

Teddy's eyes sparkled with delight. This marked the first time Marcus had voluntarily continued a conversation—a promising development in their budding camaraderie. "Do tell!"

"A relentless warrior," Marcus stated with complete sincerity.

Evelyn's lips twitched with suppressed amusement.

Nathan's already stormy expression darkened further.

Marcus, utterly unaware of any offense, simply strode past to resume his position behind Evelyn.

Teddy stood paralyzed, suddenly aware of the icy atmosphere thickening around Nathan. He mentally kicked himself for seeking validation from the socially oblivious bodyguard. What a catastrophic miscalculation!

Nathan's piercing gaze traveled up the staircase, causing Evelyn to quickly school her features. "I became this warrior because of her!" Nathan muttered under his breath. "And she dares to laugh? Heartless woman!"

Clearing her throat, Evelyn offered, "Mr. Blackwood is an exceptional leader overseeing thousands of employees. Naturally, he can't afford to be careless."

Their eyes met. Nathan's stern expression softened momentarily before curling into a smile, the storm in his eyes replaced by warmth. "Evelyn, your perception is as sharp as ever."

Nathan felt like he'd been dipped in liquid sunshine—every inch of him glowing with the sweetness of her rare praise. So this was how she truly saw him?

Evelyn exhaled quietly. Remarkable how easily placated this powerful man could be with just a few empty words.

Teddy observed the exchange with fascination. I've been saying similar compliments for months! Why does it only matter when it comes from Ms. Sinclair? Is this the infamous power of love?

Marcus, interpreting Evelyn's words as criticism of his earlier remark, approached Nathan with solemn determination. "Mr. Blackwood, would you like assistance bathing?"

The mansion fell deathly silent.

Teddy's eye developed a nervous twitch as he alternated between Marcus's earnest face and Nathan's glacial expression. Suddenly, last night's events became crystal clear. My carefully cultivated peace has been destroyed!

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Nathan's apoplectic expression and wisely retreated to her room without comment.

Moments later, her phone rang. Preston Sinclair's calm voice came through. "Evelyn, I'd like you to accompany me to a private networking event. I've uncovered a lead regarding your car accident—the person responsible will be in attendance tonight."

"Absolutely," Evelyn agreed without hesitation. "I'll leave immediately."

Having arrived at Highland Estates without formal attire, Evelyn selected an emerald green gown from the dressing room that accentuated her striking features.

As she exited her chambers, Nathan coincidentally emerged from his study. His breath caught at the vision before him—Evelyn transformed into an ethereal beauty that made his pulse race.
###Chapter 418 Preferred Ladies

Evelyn Sinclair regarded Nathan Blackwood with cool detachment. "Preston mentioned he uncovered a lead about the vehicle identification. I'm meeting him at the gala tonight."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his lips pressing into a thin line. "Be cautious then."

With a curt nod, Evelyn descended the staircase.

Marcus followed closely behind.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow scrambled after them. "Wait! Ms. Sterling, let me accompany you! I'll be your shadow protector!"

Evelyn hesitated, not wanting to wound his pride.

Marcus rolled his eyes. "Ms. Sterling is perfectly safe with me."

"But I can provide covert protection!" Teddy insisted. "While you're the obvious bodyguard, I'll blend into the background. Double the security!"

He turned hopeful eyes toward Nathan. "Come on, boss! Back me up here!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Fine. Take him. If things go south, his survival isn't your priority."

Teddy's mouth fell open.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Whatever."

Upon arrival at the gala venue, Marcus exited first to open her door. The moment Evelyn stepped out, she spotted Preston Sinclair waiting at the entrance.

Preston stood like aristocratic royalty, his presence both commanding and enigmatic.

He approached with measured steps. "No outsiders present," he assured her quietly, implying no security threats.

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly.

They entered together, Marcus maintaining a respectful distance.

Teddy sidled up, whispering, "Who's this VIP?"

"No idea," Marcus muttered, clearly uninterested.

Undeterred, Teddy pressed, "Is he courting Ms. Sterling? You should stay closer! That man looks like trouble."

Indeed, Preston's striking features and regal bearing rivaled Nathan's. Teddy sensed immediate danger.

Marcus ignored him completely.

Teddy huffed in frustration. "Guess I'm on my own then," he muttered, squaring his shoulders as he followed them inside.

The gala buzzed with elegant energy. A live orchestra played as couples twirled across the dance floor. Business conversations hummed beneath the music.

"Apparently Mr. Sinclair only partners with female CEOs now..."

"Don't waste your time. He chose Sterling Corporation over Blackwood Enterprises—that tells you everything."

"Wait...are they involved?"

"Hush! Do you want to get blacklisted?"

Evelyn caught the whispers but dismissed them with an amused smile. The truth behind their collaboration would remain their secret.

Preston caught her questioning glance and silenced the gossips with one icy stare.

Offering his arm like a perfect gentleman, Preston waited. Evelyn placed her hand lightly in the crook of his elbow, sharing an imperceptible smile.

Their seamless coordination only fueled more speculation.

Soon, three familiar figures approached with champagne flutes—the same executives from Preston's private dinner weeks prior.

Sebastian Montgomery of Montgomery Holdings. Gregory Thornton of Thornton & Co. Nathaniel Whitmore from P&K Corporation.

With contracts already signed, formalities melted away.

Sebastian puffed his cigar, eyeing Evelyn with playful intrigue. "Had I known you preferred female partners, Mr. Sinclair, I'd have brought my sister to that dinner."

Preston didn't miss a beat. "Then it's fortunate you didn't."

Sebastian choked on his champagne.
###Chapter 419 The Stepmother Dilemma

The remaining two men couldn't help but chuckle. Nathaniel Whitmore gave Sebastian Montgomery's shoulder a friendly pat. "If you don't mind that this would be my third marriage, maybe you could introduce me to your sister?"

Sebastian rolled his eyes so hard it looked painful. His jaw clenched. "Hilarious."

Gregory Thornton laughed from the sidelines, raising his champagne flute. "Regardless, Sterling Worldwide truly deserves this contract. Congratulations."

Evelyn Sinclair arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow and lifted her own glass in response. "Thank you, Mr. Thornton."

Gregory's gaze flickered with something unreadable. "I heard Mr. Blackwood was injured. Nothing serious, I hope? We had golf plans last week, but his assistant canceled last minute. I meant to visit, but work has been..." He waved a hand vaguely.

"I wouldn't know," Evelyn replied smoothly.

The truth about her caring for Nathan was known only to the Sterling family. The last thing she needed was gossip spreading through Montecito's elite circles like wildfire.

Gregory chuckled, the sound oddly sharp. "Ah, right. How silly of me to ask. You wouldn't know about Mr. Blackwood's condition now that you're... what's the term? Estranged?"

Evelyn's smile froze. Her eyes turned arctic as they swept over Gregory's smug face.

Though he played it off as casual conversation, the barb was deliberate - calculated for maximum impact in this very public setting.

Gregory's gaze darted between Evelyn and Preston with exaggerated surprise. "Wait... Mr. Sinclair, don't tell me you're unaware of Ms. Sterling's history with Mr. Blackwood?"

The other two businessmen exchanged uncomfortable glances. The sudden shift in conversation was as awkward as it was inappropriate.

If there was something between Evelyn and Preston, bringing up her ex-husband now could only cause tension.

Preston's voice was deceptively light when he spoke. "Mr. Thornton, while I appreciate your... concern, Evelyn's past relationships are hardly relevant to our current discussion." His phone chose that moment to chime. With an apologetic nod, he stepped away. "If you'll excuse me."

Left alone with the three men, Evelyn maintained her polished smile as if nothing were amiss.

"So, Ms. Sterling," Gregory pressed, leaning in slightly. "You and Mr. Sinclair go way back?"

Evelyn arched a brow. His interest was bordering on obsessive. "Wouldn't you like to know."

Gregory's smile stiffened. Evelyn turned on her heel, scanning the room for an escape.

Suddenly, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow materialized beside her, dressed like a nouveau riche caricature - complete with a rose tucked haphazardly into his suit pocket. "Ms. Sterling! I've done my research—"

Evelyn nearly choked on her champagne. For a wild moment, she considered pretending not to know him.

But Teddy, blissfully unaware of social cues, plopped down beside her. "About Preston Sinclair," he continued in a stage whisper. "He's Montecito-born but spent years overseas expanding his empire. And get this—no serious relationships despite being one of the most eligible bachelors in—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Your point being?"

Teddy leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. "A man that powerful, that attractive, with zero romantic entanglements? I'm ninety percent certain he's batting for the other team."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "He has a son, Teddy."

"Ah!" Teddy waggled his fingers. "But have you seen the boy? No resemblance whatsoever. Even if Preston isn't gay, I'd wager that child isn't his." He sighed dramatically, propping his round face in his hands. "Meanwhile, our Mr. Blackwood? Spotless reputation. No scandalous love children. Completely devoted to you. The man's practically a saint in comparison..."
###Chapter 420: A Deadly Game

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her champagne flute, taking a deliberate sip. The last person she wanted to engage with was Teddy Winslow.

She wished she could vanish into the crowd, pretending not to recognize him.

Teddy, however, had other plans. His one-sided conversation with Evelyn quickly drew curious glances from nearby guests. Gregory Thornton, undeterred, sauntered over with his own drink, eyeing Teddy with suspicion.

Who is this man? Evelyn had no intention of introducing him.

Teddy, ever bold, rose to his feet and scrutinized Gregory. There was something unsettling in Gregory’s gaze—a mix of resentment and something darker.

Teddy’s lips curled into a smirk. His eyes narrowed as he extended a hand.

"Goodness, it’s been ages!"

Gregory hesitated. The man seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place him.

He forced a stiff smile. "Indeed. I see you and Ms. Sinclair are quite engrossed. Am I interrupting?"

"Not at all!"

Teddy waved a hand, exuding effortless charm. To an outsider, he appeared perfectly at ease, as if he belonged among the elite.

Gregory’s smile turned sly.

"Ms. Sinclair, you truly are magnetic. Men flock to you wherever you go."

Teddy cut in sharply, his tone laced with sarcasm.

"Please, let’s not delude ourselves. A woman like Ms. Sinclair deserves someone of Nathaniel Blackwood’s caliber. Not someone like you."

Gregory’s smirk faltered.

Did he just call me old?

"Which company do you represent?" Gregory asked, feigning polite interest.

His eyes, however, gleamed with danger. One wrong answer, and he could ruin whoever Teddy worked for.

Teddy grinned. "Wouldn’t you like to know?"

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn considered intervening, but her gaze caught Preston Sinclair’s from across the room.

Preston ended his call and strode toward them, his expression grim. He grasped Evelyn’s wrist, leaning in to whisper.

"He’s awake. The doctors want us there immediately."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Without a word, she followed Preston out.

No one noticed Gregory’s face darken at Preston’s words.

Teddy hesitated, then hurried after them—but he was too slow.

Evelyn and Preston were already gone, their car disappearing into the night. Marcus followed in another vehicle, leaving Teddy standing alone.

Inside the car, Evelyn’s fingers clenched. "Is he really conscious?"

Preston let out a low chuckle. The glint of his watch mirrored the cold city lights.

"No. That man won’t be waking up."

Evelyn froze. "So this is a setup?"

Preston’s earlier words clicked into place. "One of those three is behind this?"

He gave her an approving nod. "Exactly."

Her stomach dropped.

She had assumed it was one of her enemies, but she’d never crossed paths with Gregory, Sebastian Montgomery, or Nathaniel Whitmore before.

Unless…

Her eyes met Preston’s.

His voice was ice. "You guessed right. It’s about the project."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, forcing herself to stay calm.

"How did you uncover this?"

Preston’s gaze was frigid. "I have people watching them. They slipped up."

Her pulse raced. "So it is Gregory?"

Theodore was brash but honest. Nathaniel was cunning but careful. Only Gregory had shown open hostility.

The realization made her skin crawl.

Preston’s lips curved. "We’ll know soon enough."
###Chapter 421 Future Father-In-Law

Preston Sinclair pressed his lips into a thin line. His dark eyes gleamed with an icy intensity.

The car pulled up to the hospital, but neither of them moved to exit.

Instead, Marcus slipped inside. Within minutes, his call came through. "Ms. Sinclair, I've got him."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. A desperate voice crackled through the phone—a stranger begging for mercy.

Preston snatched the device from her. "Did Gregory Thornton send you?" His tone was razor-sharp.

The suspicion had crossed Preston's mind too. "No! No, it wasn't Mr. Thornton!" The man's shrill denial only confirmed their suspicions.

That slip—Mr. Thornton—betrayed everything. Without hesitation, Preston dialed another number.

"Bring Gregory Thornton in. Don't let him escape."

A pause. Then, "Mr. Blackwood got to him first."

Preston's brows lifted. "Interesting." He ended the call and turned to Evelyn. "Seems Nathan was two steps ahead."

Evelyn frowned. She'd been with Nathan these past few days, yet he'd never mentioned investigating—let alone uncovering the mastermind so swiftly.

Then again, Nathan Blackwood was never one to sit idle.

After suffering such a blow, did anyone expect him to wait? He'd likely been digging from the start.

"Want to go see?" Preston offered.

Evelyn shook her head. "Send me home." She had no interest in small fry.

She was waiting for the real predator to surface.

Preston nodded, instructing the driver before stepping out.

With the mastermind caught, the danger had passed—yet unease still coiled in Evelyn's chest.

Business was about profit. The strong took more. But assassination? Car crashes? Hitmen?

These people played dirty.

Soon, Highland Estates came into view. Theodore "Teddy" Winslow greeted her at the door, beaming. "Ms. Sinclair! I made you passionfruit iced tea—refreshing and healthy!"

Evelyn wasn't in the mood. She waved him off—then paused. "When did you get back?"

Teddy grinned. "Mr. Blackwood had urgent business, so he sent me to keep you company. Thoughtful, isn't he?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Had Nathan gone after Gregory himself? She didn’t voice the thought.

Teddy pressed the tea into her hands. "Oh! Chairman Sterling's birthday is coming up. Mr. Blackwood’s been agonizing over the perfect gift. Says your father is his greatest inspiration."

Evelyn’s frown deepened.

"Why is he stressing over my dad’s birthday?"

Teddy leaned in conspiratorially. "He wants to impress him. It’s a big deal!"

Evelyn smirked. "Tell him not to bother. My father already knows he’s respected."

"But if the gift isn’t meaningful—"

"My father has three hobbies," Evelyn cut in. "Fishing, counting money, and yelling at people."

Teddy nearly tripped on the stairs. As Evelyn walked away, his mind raced.

How did one cater to that?

Turn into a fish? Absurd.

Stack cash in a briefcase? Tacky.

Volunteer as a verbal punching bag?

Impossible.
###Chapter 422 Can't Let Your Guard Down

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow sat slumped on the plush sofa in Highland Estates' grand living room, nursing his wounded heart over Nathan's indifference when the front door creaked open.

Nathan Blackwood wheeled himself in, his usually sharp features softened by the dim lighting. Teddy sprang up like an overeager puppy.

"Mr. Blackwood! You're back already? Shouldn't you be resting after your injury? Your dedication is truly inspiring—no wonder you're the most successful man in New York!"

Nathan had just finished dealing with Gregory Thornton, putting him in an unusually good mood—until Teddy's sycophantic greeting soured his expression.

The blatant flattery was almost impressive in its absurdity. Nathan clenched his jaw, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre. "Is Evelyn home?"

"Yes, sir. Though...Ms. Sinclair seems rather upset tonight. Maybe you should—"

Nathan's glacial glare cut through Teddy's words like a knife. The assistant visibly gulped, hastily adding, "That gala tonight was spectacular! Like something out of a Hollywood premiere. Though it lacked your commanding presence, of course."

Nathan ignored the babbling, maneuvering his wheelchair toward the study. What kind of idiot had he hired? If not for Teddy's unique skill set, he'd have fired him months ago.

Teddy scurried after him, grabbing the wheelchair handles. "But sir, you really should be concerned! Preston Sinclair was practically orbiting Ms. Sinclair all evening. The way he looks at her—it's not just gratitude anymore. You can't afford to be complacent!"

At the gala, Teddy had witnessed firsthand the reverence everyone showed Preston Sinclair. The Wall Street titan carried himself with the same formidable aura as Nathan, yet he'd been uncharacteristically gentle with Evelyn, attending to her every need. How could Nathan ignore that?

Rubbing his temples, Nathan snapped, "Just do your damn job." He dismissed Teddy's concerns. Preston's kindness stemmed from Evelyn saving his son during that terrorist attack in Paris years ago. Nathan was certain the man harbored no ulterior motives.

As for romantic feelings? Preston's wife had died in that same attack. No man moved on from that in just a few years.

Nathan paused outside Evelyn's bedroom door, knocking softly. After a prolonged silence, the door swung open.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, her face obscured by a clay mask, arms crossed defiantly. "What energy you have, Mr. Blackwood. Capturing Gregory Thornton and still having breath to bother me."

Nathan's gaze softened as he looked up at her. "I have news I think you'll appreciate."

"Let me guess—you found the murderer? Gregory Thornton?" Her flat tone held no surprise.

Nathan's eyebrows lifted appreciatively. "You already knew. Of course you did." His lips quirked. "Shall I hand him over to the police immediately?"

Evelyn's mask cracked slightly as she frowned. "Too merciful. I assume you're dismantling his empire first? Making him watch everything he built crumble before tossing him in a cell?"

"Would you like to participate?" Nathan watched her closely.

Evelyn hesitated. "You've handled everything already. No point dirtying my hands."

A chill seemed to radiate from Nathan as he studied her. Remembering Teddy's warning, he decided to voice his thoughts. "You're extraordinary, Evelyn. Brilliant, beautiful...and far too kind for your own good."

Any other woman might have melted at such praise. Evelyn merely rolled her eyes beneath her mask. "Exactly why I'm too good for you. What nonsense are you spouting at this hour?"

Nathan's shoulders slumped slightly as he retreated to his room, the weight of unrequited affection pressing down on him.

###Chapter 423 More Handsome and Richer

The morning sun had barely risen when Evelyn Sinclair's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Lucas Sterling.

Newton & Co's bankruptcy had struck like lightning.

Could this be connected to Nathan Blackwood? Evelyn knew Alexander would find out eventually, but she hadn't expected him to catch wind of it so soon—especially while he was overseas. She steadied her voice as she explained that Gregory Thornton had orchestrated the car accident.

A heavy silence stretched between them for a full minute before Alexander's tone turned glacial.

"Keep Marcus by your side at all times. Don't let your guard down." His words were clipped, commanding. "Stay out of the rest. Just wait for me to return."

Evelyn agreed, exchanging a few more words before ending the call.

She threw herself into work, arriving at Kingsley Tech before dawn. Benjamin Carter, still green in his role, struggled with complex decisions, his inexperience glaringly obvious.

Evelyn spent the entire day guiding him, her patience unwavering. Before she knew it, the sky outside had transformed into a breathtaking canvas of crimson and gold as the sun dipped below the horizon.

Stretching her stiff muscles, she finally decided to call it a day. The moment she stepped out of her office, her gaze landed on the imposing figure seated in a wheelchair, his presence commanding the room.

Even seated, Nathan Blackwood exuded an aura of icy detachment, his sharp features unyielding. Dominic Kingsley, lounging beside him on the sofa, spotted Evelyn and exhaled dramatically.

"Ms. Sinclair! Finally off work?" His relief was palpable as he loosened his tie.

Nathan had insisted on waiting for Evelyn, and in the meantime, he'd combed through every project and account with ruthless precision. His scrutiny had uncovered flaws even their auditors had missed.

Dominic was on the verge of losing his mind.

The moment Nathan's eyes met Evelyn's, his expression softened, warmth replacing the frost in his gaze.

"Perfect timing," he murmured, a faint smile playing on his lips. "There's a new French restaurant nearby. Join me?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why should I?"

Nathan's face fell, his wounded expression making her look like the villain.

"Didn't you promise to take care of me?" His voice was laced with accusation, drawing incredulous stares from those around them.

Evelyn couldn't bear the weight of their judgment.

With a sigh, she pushed his wheelchair forward, tossing her bag to Marcus. "Fine. Let's go."

A flicker of guilt nagged at her.

Marcus seamlessly took over the wheelchair at some point, a move Nathan noticed—and resented—but said nothing.

Just as they reached the car, a small figure barreled toward them.

"Pretty Lady!"

Evelyn turned just in time to see Oliver Sinclair sprinting toward her, his curls bouncing with each step.

He latched onto her legs, his voice a sweet, pleading whine. "I missed you so much!"

Her heart melted instantly.

Kneeling, she wrapped her arms around his plump little body. "Oliver, I missed you too. Your daddy told me you've been studying hard. Such a good boy!"

Oliver had been sulking for days, furious at his father for assigning a strict tutor to oversee his homework.

But now, hearing Evelyn's praise, his resentment evaporated.

"Pretty Lady thinks I'm good!" He beamed, nuzzling into her embrace.

"Yes! And when I grow up, I'll be even handsomer and richer than Daddy!" His eyes sparkled with determination. "Then no one can stop me from being with you!"

Nathan scoffed, shooting his son a withering glare.

"Enough," he said flatly. "We're leaving."

Oliver's grip on Evelyn tightened. "Where are you going? I wanna come too!"
###Chapter 424 A Small Surprise

Evelyn gently ruffled Oliver Sinclair's hair. She couldn't resist this adorable boy - he had completely stolen her heart.

"Alright then." Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened instantly. His voice turned icy. "Does Preston Sinclair even know you sneaked out alone?"

Oliver shrank into Evelyn's embrace, guilt written all over his cherubic face.

"This grumpy old man! Even when he's sick, he's still so annoying!" Nathan smirked triumphantly as he pulled out his phone to call Preston.

"Your son sneaked out and is currently with me and Evelyn." Nathan's tone clearly implied he wanted Preston to come collect his troublesome child immediately.

Nathan deliberately put the call on speakerphone so Oliver could hear Preston's response. The Wall Street tycoon's voice came through cold and indifferent. "Is that so? Then please take good care of him for me. I'm in an important meeting. We'll talk later." Click - the line went dead.

All three froze momentarily. Oliver was the first to recover, wrapping his tiny arms around Evelyn's neck in a joyful hug. "Yay! I get to stay with my Muse!" Nathan's face flushed with frustration as he stared at his now-dark phone screen, feeling his blood pressure rise.

"After finally getting this date with Evelyn, now I have to babysit Preston Sinclair's kid? Unbelievable!" The group of four - including Marcus - headed to the exclusive restaurant where Theodore "Teddy" Winslow had made reservations weeks in advance.

The ambiance was perfection - intimate lighting casting romantic shadows, designed to kindle passion. Teddy had even prepared conversation starters for Nathan.

They were supposed to reminisce about shared memories and dream about future possibilities together.

The entire floor had been reserved for privacy. Soothing classical music filled the air while twinkling lights created an illusion of dining among the stars - a breathtakingly romantic setting.

Everything would have been perfect... if not for their tiny third wheel. Marcus sat discreetly at a nearby table while Oliver clung to Evelyn's hand, stubbornly planting himself between the two adults.

The boy eyed the elaborate floral centerpiece and candle arrangement with visible disapproval. Nathan reached forward with a carefully prepared bouquet of rare blue orchids imported from Bali - nearly impossible to obtain.

His gaze softened as he tried to ignore their unwelcome companion. "These are for you," he murmured in that deep, mesmerizing voice.

"Mr. Grumpy actually brought a gift?" Before Evelyn could accept, Oliver suddenly stood up with a dramatic huff. "Muse only likes big white roses! But thanks anyway, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he withdrew the flowers, shooting daggers at the smug child. Oliver's satisfaction only grew as his eyes crinkled into happy crescents.

Fumbling in his pocket, the boy declared, "Muse, I didn't have time to buy flowers, but I grabbed these shiny rocks from Daddy's safe for you!"

With great ceremony, he emptied his chubby palm onto the table. Evelyn gasped. Oliver had brought a handful of uncut diamonds - each one large enough to be staggeringly valuable!

Even in the dim lighting, the stones refracted dazzling rainbows across the starry ceiling. They seemed to glow with an ethereal inner light.

Oliver rubbed his hands together excitedly, beaming up at Evelyn. "I've got tons more! Do you like them? All girls love sparkly things, right?"
###Chapter 425 Can't Be Too Petty

Nathan's fingers clenched around the edge of the table, his chest rising and falling in barely restrained frustration.

Every meticulously planned gesture—ruined by a child's careless handful of diamonds?! How could Preston Sinclair raise such an outrageously spoiled son?! Evelyn's lips parted in stunned silence.

These weren't just any gems—they were flawless, rare stones that belonged in a vault, not tossed around like candy by little Oliver Sinclair. She exhaled sharply, torn between amusement and disbelief.

"You should put these back where they belong. I can't accept them." Oliver wriggled in protest, his tiny fingers clutching Evelyn's wrist.

"Pretty Lady, don't you like them?" His lower lip jutted out. "I have even shinier ones at home!"

Evelyn bit back a laugh. How did one explain the concept of priceless jewels to a five-year-old? With a resigned sigh, she tucked them into her clutch.

"I do like them," she admitted, ruffling his hair. "But next time, ask your dad before giving away treasures, okay?" She'd return them to Preston later. Oliver beamed, triumphant.

"Nanny said diamonds make ladies happy!" He grinned up at Nathan. "Right, Mean Mister? Boys shouldn't be stingy!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Was this brat mocking him? He'd bought an entire restaurant for Evelyn—planned to name it after her—and now he was being called cheap?!

Oliver preened under Nathan's glare. Mean Mister was still a villain, injured or not. No one stole his Pretty Lady!

The dinner, once romantic, now felt like a battlefield. Even the carefully rehearsed lines Nathan's assistant Teddy had prepared were useless against this tiny, diamond-wielding saboteur.

When their food arrived, Evelyn happily cut Oliver's steak, their laughter grating on Nathan's nerves. After ten unbearable minutes, he finally snapped.

"Evelyn." His voice was tight. "I'm upset."

Honesty was key, Teddy had insisted. But Evelyn merely blinked before smiling.

"That's a shame. Oliver and I are having a lovely time, though."

Nathan's heart cracked audibly.

Oliver giggled into his juice.

Later, as they dropped Oliver at The Grandeur, Preston was waiting in the lobby. He chuckled at his sleeping son before lifting him gently.

"Apologies for the trouble, Ms. Sinclair."

"None at all. He's delightful." Evelyn smiled.

Nathan, still fuming in the car, thought, Delightful? That demon child ruined everything!

Preston's gaze flickered to Evelyn's clutch. "Ah. I see he shared his treasures."

Evelyn quickly produced the diamonds. "He doesn't understand their value. Please take them back."

Preston waved her off. "If I return them, he'll disown me." With a nod to Nathan, he added, "Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood. Ms. Sinclair."

Nathan ignored him.

As Preston walked away, Evelyn stared at the glittering stones in her palm.

So this was where Oliver learned his absurd generosity.
###Chapter 426 Stay With Me

Evelyn Sinclair felt uneasy accepting a fortune in diamonds without reason. As she settled into the backseat of the car with Nathan Blackwood, Marcus and the driver took their places in the front.

Nathan closed his eyes, his entire demeanor radiating icy tension. He remained silent, his jaw clenched. Evelyn suddenly recalled how he had specifically asked for her opinion on the restaurant's dishes, yet she had failed to give any feedback.

She cleared her throat softly. "The chef at that place is exceptional. The ingredients were top-tier. What did you think?"

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly.

His expression softened just a fraction. "Good. I'm glad you enjoyed it."

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. She couldn't just accept such an extravagant gift and leave him in a foul mood. She caught Marcus's eye in the rearview mirror.

"Marcus, what did you think of the food?"

"Mr. Blackwood!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow greeted them cheerfully as they arrived at Highland Estates. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood, you're back! I was worried dinner might disrupt your rest, so I prepared some floral tea to aid digestion."

He moved to take Evelyn's shoes while enthusiastically recommending his homemade blend. The three male doctors waiting in the living room stiffened under Nathan's cold, unreadable gaze. Evelyn offered them a reassuring smile.

"Alright. Let me change first. I'll be down shortly." She turned to the doctors, her voice gentle. "You can go ahead upstairs to set up for the examination."

"Marcus, accompany Mr. Blackwood."

Marcus nodded and stepped forward, but Nathan stopped him with a sharp look.

His eyes locked onto Evelyn. "I want you."

Evelyn barely resisted the urge to roll her eyes.

He never misses a chance to order me around.

Teddy hurried to her side. "Ms. Sinclair, you really should go with Mr. Blackwood. Otherwise—"

Marcus shrugged. "The food was mediocre. Pretty presentation, but not filling."

Evelyn nearly choked. Nathan shot Marcus a glare that could freeze hell over.

"Then have Teddy make you something," Nathan said coldly.

Marcus's lips thinned. "That won't be necessary."

He'd rather starve than endure Teddy's endless chatter.

Back at Highland Estates, the doctors had been waiting for some time. Teddy had kept them entertained with lively conversation and mobile games, so engrossed they hadn't noticed the car pulling up. Marcus opened the door while Evelyn wheeled Nathan inside.

The four in the living room immediately pocketed their phones and stood at attention.

"You should go with Mr. Blackwood," Teddy insisted. "Otherwise, he might be too embarrassed to discuss his condition with the doctors."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then why isn't he embarrassed to tell me?"

She didn't bother arguing further. It wouldn't take long anyway.

She pushed Nathan into the elevator, the three doctors scrambling after them. For Nathan's convenience, they had outfitted a home consultation room with state-of-the-art medical equipment. They helped him onto the examination bed.

Nathan still couldn't move his legs. It had only been a month since the accident—full mobility would take several more months to return.

The lead doctor instructed the others to prepare the instruments while Nathan removed his shirt, revealing his sculpted torso. The doctor carefully checked his heart and lung function before cutting open his pants to examine his right leg's recovery.

During the examination, Evelyn instinctively turned away.

Nathan seized her wrist.

"Stay," he commanded, his voice low.

A beat later, Evelyn turned her back to him but didn't pull away. "Fine. Let go."

The doctors exchanged glances but stayed silent. Nathan showed no intention of releasing her, his gaze piercing the lead doctor.

"Continue."

The doctor hesitated. "We could lower the curtains..."

The room had been designed with adjustable gauze curtains to filter sunlight at different angles. They could easily block Evelyn's view of Nathan.

The doctor didn't expect Nathan to glare at him like he'd suggested treason.

Evelyn spoke quickly. "Yes, lower them now."

Marcus—
###Chapter 427 Held the Wrong Person

The attending physician was conducting the examination when Nathan had to release Evelyn's hand momentarily.

Less than sixty seconds passed before Nathan grew restless at her absence.

"Evelyn, take my hand," Nathan's voice came out weak and pleading. The medical staff exchanged glances—Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair seemed unusually close.

Who would have guessed the formidable CEO could be this clingy?

A hand reached toward him. Nathan caught sight of it from the corner of his eye and immediately seized the wrist.

His pulse raced, but relief washed over him. He didn't dare stroke her fingers, afraid of provoking her temper. Since she hadn't pulled away, the earlier sting of rejection quietly faded.

The examination lasted ten agonizing minutes, during which Nathan's heart hammered violently. Just as it concluded, he heard Theodore's voice drifting in from the hallway.

"Ms. Sinclair, are you certain you only want one small tea? Allow me to bring you another—"

The voice grew nearer.

"No, thank you. I've had enough." The reply was soft, almost distant.

A heavy silence fell over the room.

If Evelyn's voice came from beyond the door... then whose hand was this?!

The doctors instinctively looked at Nathan, still lying on the examination table. His tightly shut eyes flew open, dark with icy fury.

The hand in his grasp twitched.

Nathan's entire body went rigid.

He recoiled as if burned, releasing his grip with startling speed. His tone turned arctic.

"Who the hell is this?!"

The curtain was yanked aside, revealing Marcus's scowling face—stiff with forced patience, his expression a mix of irritation and wounded pride.

He held himself back, jaw clenched. "Mr. Blackwood, you grabbed me first. For Ms. Sinclair's sake, I endured it."

Being her bodyguard was clearly no easy job.

Under the stunned gazes of the medical team, Marcus turned on his heel and strode out, his muscular frame radiating quiet intimidation.

At that moment, Evelyn walked in, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Finished with the checkup?"

Nathan glared at her, his face flushing crimson with rage. The staff sensed the sudden drop in temperature and hastily excused themselves, fleeing the room.

Evelyn approached and sat beside him. Noticing his flushed cheeks, she frowned and pressed a hand to his forehead.

"No fever. Are you feeling unwell?"

Nathan gritted his teeth, his bloodshot eyes locked onto hers.

First the bath incident. Now this. Both times with Marcus.

Frustration burned in his chest, but he couldn't lash out—not when he'd been the one trying to take advantage.

"My heart is unwell," he ground out.

Evelyn withdrew her hand, her lips curving into an amused smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, did you just cling to Marcus's hand like a lovestruck schoolboy?"

Nathan's face darkened further.

Evelyn chuckled. "Relax. Your secret's safe with me." She reached for his silk pajamas and draped them over him.

"My father's birthday is coming up. I'll be returning home for a few days. You don't mind, do you?"

Nathan stared at her in silence, his tongue pressed hard against his cheek as he fought to suppress the storm of emotions.

"...No."

Evelyn nodded, satisfied. She turned and summoned Theodore to help Nathan freshen up.

She knew he wouldn't protest—not when the mere sight of Marcus would undoubtedly sour his mood further.

"Theodore!" she called.

The cheerful assistant bounded in, beaming. "What an honor to attend to Mr. Blackwood! Oh my—wow, sir! Your physique is absolutely—"

Nathan's expression turned stony. A single warning glance silenced him mid-sentence.

Quick to redirect, Theodore cleared his throat. "So, Mr. Blackwood! That candlelit dinner with Ms. Sinclair must have been incredibly romantic, yes? Did she weep from joy?"

Nathan shut his eyes tightly.

Deep breaths. Just endure this idiot a little longer.
###Chapter 428 Meeting the Future Father-In-Law

Nathan Blackwood had given Theodore Winslow an impossible task before retiring for the night. He demanded immediate improvement in his strained relationship with Evelyn Sinclair.

Teddy burned the midnight oil, finally devising what he considered a brilliant strategy. The timing couldn't be more perfect - William Sterling's birthday celebration was just around the corner.

Evelyn hadn't brought many belongings when she temporarily moved into Highland Estates, so her departure was light and effortless. She practically skipped to the door, waving cheerfully at Nathan.

"Finally! Freedom!" Evelyn twirled in delight, imagining weeks without Nathan's constant presence. Nathan watched her go with deceptive calmness, his expression shifting to icy intensity the moment the door closed behind her.

"Everything prepared?" Nathan's voice cut through the silence. Teddy straightened his tie with confidence. "Absolutely, sir. Win over Mr. Sterling, and you'll be dining with the Sterlings regularly before you know it."

Nathan's lips twitched almost imperceptibly, the closest he ever came to smiling. Teddy continued his enthusiastic pitch. "A man of your caliber? Distinguished lineage, impeccable manners, business acumen - you're practically royalty! Mr. Sterling would be a fool not to-"

"Enough." Nathan's sharp command silenced Teddy instantly. The assistant scurried off to make final preparations. William Sterling had chosen an intimate yet opulent celebration - a sunset cruise aboard his private yacht in San Francisco Bay.

Only close family, friends, and select business associates received invitations. Alexander and Lucas Sterling were busy welcoming guests when Donovan Sterling made his rare public appearance. True to her word, Evelyn had extended an invitation to Emily Whitaker, who arrived practically vibrating with excitement.

William and Donovan were deep in conversation when Evelyn arrived with Emily in tow. Donovan's eyebrows lifted slightly at the sight of the young scientist - not conventionally beautiful like Evelyn, but radiating an earnest intelligence that was equally compelling.

Emily immediately launched into animated conversation with Donovan while Evelyn guided her father through the gathering. Holding a champagne flute, Evelyn moved through the crowd with practiced grace, her polite smile never wavering.

"That Sloan project was quite the coup, Ms. Sterling," a business associate remarked. "We're all green with envy."

Evelyn lowered her lashes demurely. "Just fortunate timing."

"Nonsense," William interjected proudly. "Pure talent and hard work." Evelyn shot her father an exasperated look before laughing, her face transforming with genuine amusement.

This was the scene that greeted Nathan when he boarded - Evelyn radiant with laughter, surrounded by admirers. Tristan Whitmore, following behind, noticed Nathan's transfixed expression.

"See something interesting?" Tristan followed Nathan's gaze and smirked. "Ah. The yacht's decor is quite... impressive."

Nathan ignored the jab. "The vessel is adequate." Tristan rolled his eyes. Who was Nathan trying to fool?

Evelyn's smile froze when she spotted Nathan on deck. "Why is he here?" she hissed to her father.

"I invited him," William replied calmly. Tristan wheeled Nathan forward. Even seated, Nathan commanded attention - his broad shoulders and imposing presence making the wheelchair irrelevant. No one dared comment on his injury.

"Happy birthday, Mr. Sterling." Nathan's voice was smooth as aged whiskey.

William nodded, his expression warmer than usual. "Thank you. How's the recovery progressing?" After all, Nathan's injuries were sustained protecting Evelyn.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Your daughter has been... exceptionally attentive. I'm recovering well, thank you."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. The man was utterly shameless.
###Chapter 429 Were Not Close

Tristan Whitmore's jaw dropped as he boarded the luxury yacht. His eyes locked onto the fleet of limited-edition Ferraris parked along the dock, including one particular model he'd been trying to acquire for months without success. A pang of envy shot through him.

"Evelyn, did you all arrive in those Ferraris?" Tristan asked, trying to sound casual.

Evelyn Sinclair flipped her long hair over one shoulder, making the diamond studs in her ears catch the moonlight. "No," she said with a playful smirk. "We took the helicopter."

Tristan's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

Nearby, Ethan Caldwell and Adrian Blackwood approached. Evelyn's face lit up as she went to greet them. Adrian glanced at Nathan Blackwood and shook his head in disappointment. "My uncle is hopeless. Even after that accident, he still can't win her back."

Ethan chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood's situation is unique. Any other woman would have melted instantly for a man with his resources and looks." His gaze drifted to Evelyn. "But then again, she's Evelyn Sinclair."

"It's been ages!" Evelyn greeted them warmly. "How have you been?"

Adrian sighed dramatically. "Ever since you left the show, ratings have plummeted. Copycats are everywhere now - my career might be over!"

Ethan simply smiled. "I'm doing well."

Evelyn nodded. "Glad to hear it."

"Did she just ignore me?" Adrian muttered under his breath. "What was the point of my dramatic speech then?"

The trio moved to the deck where the ocean breeze played with Evelyn's hair. The night air carried the salty tang of the sea, mingling with the rich aroma of the cabernet in her glass. Moonlight danced across the dark liquid as she swirled it absently.

Adrian spent the next twenty minutes trying to convince Evelyn to make guest appearances on his show again. His voice grew hoarse from pleading, but Evelyn remained unmoved.

Suddenly, little Oliver Sinclair came barreling toward them. "Muse!" he called excitedly, spotting Evelyn talking to Preston Sinclair nearby.

Evelyn's expression softened as she patted the boy's head. "Oliver, you came too?"

The child wrapped his arms around her legs and began digging through his pockets. "Muse! I brought you a present!"

Evelyn looked down and froze. Oliver was holding three gleaming gold bars that shone brilliantly under the deck lights. The extravagant gift looked absurdly out of place in the small boy's hands.

Her lips pressed together in a thin line. "Where on earth did this child learn such spending habits?"

Adrian and Ethan stood speechless beside her.

Evelyn knelt to Oliver's level. "Sweetheart, next time just bring me white chrysanthemums, okay?" She'd rather receive simple flowers than extravagant gifts from a child.

Oliver tilted his head in confusion. "Don't you like it? You liked the gold bracelet I gave you last time! Nanny said gold bars are more impressive!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "I prefer flowers, darling."

Oliver's face broke into a determined grin. "Okay!" He dashed off immediately, presumably to search the entire yacht for white chrysanthemums.

Adrian whistled. "Damn, Evelyn. You've even got kids wrapped around your finger?"

She arched one perfect eyebrow. "What can I say? Charm comes naturally."

Their laughter was interrupted when Archibald, the Sterling Manor butler, approached discreetly. "Miss Sinclair," he murmured, "there's a woman insisting on seeing you. She's not among your known acquaintances."

Evelyn set down her wine glass with a frown. "I'll handle it."

Outside, the bodyguards were blocking a frantic Celeste Rousseau. The woman's eyes lit up when she saw Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair! I've been searching everywhere for you! I need your help!"

Evelyn's expression turned icy. "Ethan Caldwell," she said flatly. "We're not close."

Celeste flushed with embarrassment. "But we've met before! You're the only one who can help me now!"
###Chapter 430 The Lowest of the Low

At first, everyone assumed Celeste Rousseau would become Mrs. Gregory Thornton. They showered her with attention, bending over backwards to please her.

But when Gregory married another woman, Celeste found herself abruptly exiled from that glittering social circle.

No one would lift a finger to help her now.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Celeste with icy detachment. She wondered how this woman had even managed to get on board when they were anchored so far from shore. Unsurprisingly, without an invitation, Celeste was stopped at the entrance by security.

Evelyn made no move to intervene.

"Help me? Why should you?" Celeste stood trembling, her delicate features arranged in perfect vulnerability.

"Ms. Sinclair, we may not know each other well, but you destroyed my life. Doesn't that weigh on your conscience?" Though the words were accusatory, Celeste delivered them with practiced fragility - all while directing every ounce of blame at Evelyn.

If Evelyn hadn't walked into that private room with Ethan Caldwell that fateful day, Celeste would be Mrs. Thornton by now. The bitterness of her fall from grace festered in her heart. She'd tried returning to Ethan, but he refused to see her.

She couldn't accept defeat - not when she'd been so close to securing a life of luxury. Evelyn was almost impressed by the sheer audacity of Celeste's delusions.

"Guilty?" Evelyn arched one perfect brow. "Do police officers lose sleep over arresting criminals?" The barb hit its mark, draining the color from Celeste's face.

"That's cruel!" Celeste spat.

"What you did was cruel," Evelyn countered smoothly. "You've lived in privilege since birth. You couldn't possibly understand how hard I've worked to get where I am!" Celeste's eyes welled with crocodile tears.

"Why should I care about your struggles?" Evelyn's voice remained perfectly composed.

Celeste had no one to blame but herself for her current predicament. This pathetic display was beyond absurd.

Celeste faltered, unprepared for Evelyn's complete immunity to her act. How was she supposed to proceed when her usual tactics failed?

"You made your choices, Celeste," Evelyn said, each word deliberate. "Did you really think you'd never get caught? You weren't framed. You're simply facing the consequences of your own actions."

Celeste's lips trembled. "But...I was so close! All I wanted was a good life with Gregory—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Must I really endure your presence on such a beautiful day? Spare me the theatrics and get to the point. What do you want?"

Celeste bit her plump lower lip. "Are you and Ethan really together?"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. The hypocrisy was staggering. Mere moments ago, this woman had been lamenting her lost chance with Gregory Thornton, and now she was probing about Ethan Caldwell? If Ethan were still that penniless explorer, Celeste wouldn't give him a second glance.

Evelyn didn't answer, merely offering an enigmatic smile. Her piercing gaze seemed to strip Celeste bare, exposing every ugly truth.

"Ethan and I shared something special," Celeste pressed on, desperation creeping into her voice. "For me, he changed all his banking information. His passwords became my birthday. Every cent he earned went into our joint account."

She lifted her chin with false pride. "He proposed six times. Six! I turned him down each time. Has he done any of that for you?"

Celeste clearly believed that as Ethan's ex, she posed some threat to Evelyn. That these petty boasts would rattle the heiress. She watched eagerly for any sign of distress.

Evelyn observed the shift in Celeste's demeanor, recognizing the transparent attempt at manipulation. This was about provoking jealousy, about making Evelyn doubt her relationship with Ethan.

How amusing.

If Evelyn and Ethan were actually together, these barbs might have stung. But they weren't. And Celeste's pathetic performance only confirmed what Evelyn had always known - this woman was truly the lowest of the low.
###Chapter 431 Cast You Into the Depths

The atmosphere between them instantly turned glacial. Evelyn's silence pleased Celeste immensely - it meant her carefully chosen words had struck their mark.

A smug smile curled Celeste's lips as she raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. The bay's shimmering reflections danced across her face like liquid gold.

"You have countless options besides Ethan," Celeste said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "But he's my only chance at happiness. Ms. Sterling, won't you take pity on me? Please give him back to me?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her lips twisting into a dangerous smirk that didn't reach her cold, assessing eyes. She tilted her head slightly, deliberately provoking Celeste with her amused detachment.

"Oh, I do have many choices," Evelyn purred. "And Ethan happens to be one of them. But tell me - did you ever consider the consequences when you stole from him?"

"I had no choice!" Celeste spat through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's laughter was sharp as broken glass. "No choice but to fund your affairs with your boyfriend's money? How... creative."

Celeste's face burned with humiliation at having her dirty laundry aired. She'd simply chosen the wrong man - why should she be punished forever for one mistake? "Even if I messed up, I deserve a chance to make things right with Ethan! He'll forgive me if I just-"

"Forgive you?" A deep male voice cut through the tension like a knife.

Two figures descended the spiral staircase - Ethan Caldwell and Nathan Blackwood. Ethan's expression was thunderous, his piercing gaze locking onto Celeste with undisguised contempt.

"I'm being generous by not pressing charges," Ethan growled. "You still owe me over $300,000, yet you dare ask for forgiveness?"

Celeste visibly paled at Ethan's sudden appearance. She turned pleading eyes toward Evelyn. "Ms. Sterling, why are you laughing? I'm not trying to come between you two. I just want to apologize properly. Please don't let this affect your relationship."

Evelyn's internal monologue was scathing: What a two-faced snake. Outwardly, she exchanged an amused glance with Ethan, whose murderous expression could have frozen lava.

With a playful wink at Ethan, Evelyn turned back to Celeste. "You couldn't possibly affect our relationship," she said sweetly. "But you have ruined my evening."

She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a dangerous purr. "Today was supposed to be special. And yet here you are, making a scene." Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Consider this your only warning. Say one more word, and I'll have you tossed into the ocean."

The casual threat landed with the weight of an anchor. This was no idle warning - Evelyn Sinclair absolutely meant every word. The dark water lapped hungrily at the yacht's hull, its surface rippling ominously in the cold night breeze.

Celeste's eyes darted nervously between Evelyn and Ethan, searching for any sign of mercy. She found none - only Ethan's mocking, condescending stare that made her feel smaller than plankton.

Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, Celeste finally understood how severely she'd overestimated her own importance. Her shoulders slumped in defeat as she cast one last, desperate glance at Ethan.
###Chapter 432 She Refuses the Invitation

Ethan Caldwell descended the stairs with impatient strides, his expression softening when his gaze landed on Evelyn Sinclair. "Ms. Sterling, allow me to handle this. You should return to your guests before they witness this... unfortunate spectacle."

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "You're absolutely right. I have no desire to deal with her anyway." A faint smile played on her lips. "Very well, I'll leave this matter in your capable hands."

Celeste Rousseau watched the effortless chemistry between the two people who barely acknowledged her existence, her fists clenching involuntarily. Ethan approached with powerful strides that echoed across the deck.

An aura of dangerous intensity surrounded him as he seized Celeste's arm, dragging her toward the yacht's railing. With one forceful motion, he pinned her against the polished metal, her back arching precariously over the dark abyss of the Pacifica Ocean.

Though the waters appeared calm, the depth held untold dangers. A frigid ocean breeze whipped past them, making Celeste shiver violently. Her fingers turned white from gripping the railing as her voice quivered. "Ethan, what the hell are you doing?!"

Darkness shrouded Ethan's handsome features, his eyes glacial. He applied more pressure, leaning her further over the edge. "Celeste, I'm offering you two choices," he said with chilling calm. "Disappear from my life permanently, or..."

His grip tightened. "I'll let gravity decide your fate right now."

For the first time, Celeste heard undisguised loathing in his usually controlled voice. The coldness penetrated her bones, triggering primal fear. She glanced down in panic.

The yacht had sailed far from shore. Even if she screamed, no one would hear over the party music. The Sterling security team stood like statues behind them - witnesses who would never testify. If Ethan dropped her into these waters, she'd vanish without a trace.

Regret flooded her system. Her petty schemes meant nothing against people like Evelyn and Ethan. Ethan's grip didn't relent. It would take mere seconds to send her overboard. He was simply waiting for her decision.

Would he actually do it? The old Ethan might have hesitated. But since being revealed as the sole heir to Sterling Worldwide, he'd transformed into someone far more dangerous. Celeste had heard enough whispers in Preston Sinclair's circle to know what powerful men were capable of.

The salt-laced wind stung her cheeks as her pulse hammered wildly. Terror turned her blood to ice. "So?" Ethan's voice sounded like it came from the depths of hell. This wasn't the man she'd once known.

Tears welled in Celeste's eyes as she clung to the railing, her nails scraping metal. "The first option! I'll leave immediately! Just let me go!" In that moment, she saw something terrifying in Ethan's eyes - a ruthlessness that promised he'd follow through.

The arrogance of power surrounded him like an impenetrable force field. Celeste bit her trembling lip. "You're really in love with her, aren't you?" she whispered.

Ethan's gaze darkened further. Celeste felt despair clawing at her throat. A hysterical laugh escaped her. "She said you're just one of her options. It's obvious she doesn't—"

Ethan released her abruptly, his expression glacial. He turned to a nearby security officer. "Prepare a speedboat to remove this woman immediately." The guard hesitated only briefly before nodding. A vessel stood ready for guest transportation.

Nathaniel Blackwood observed Ethan's expression and Celeste's venomous words. He swallowed his unspoken warning. This woman wasn't worth the breath.

As Ethan and Nathaniel returned to the gala, the head butler quietly reported every detail of the confrontation to Evelyn. She acknowledged the information with a slight nod before seamlessly rejoining the festivities.

Her gaze swept across the ballroom - William Sterling deep in conversation with Preston Sinclair, their laughter carrying across the space. Turning slightly, she noticed Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore engaged in what appeared to be a serious discussion. Fragments of her name reached her ears.

Frowning, Evelyn approached the pair. "I'm planning a week-long birthday celebration in Costa Azul," Tristan announced enthusiastically. "Consider it a working vacation."

"I'm occupied," Nathan replied tersely from his wheelchair.

Tristan scoffed. "Occupied doing what? You can't even leave the house for client meetings these days. You've got nothing but time!"

Nathan's expression turned serious. "Evelyn won't agree to go."
###Chapter 433 Marriage Alliance

"What does this have to do with her?" Tristan Whitmore's voice rose sharply in frustration.

After years of friendship with Nathan Blackwood, the man still hesitated about whether Evelyn Sinclair would attend his birthday celebration.

Owned by N?velDrama.Org.

Tristan never anticipated Ms. Sinclair's appearance at the event.

Evelyn overheard their exchange and turned, only to have a small figure barrel toward her with sorrowful eyes. The elegant Ms. Sinclair paused gracefully, her lips curving into a gentle smile.

"Oliver, what's troubling you?" Naturally, Nathan and Tristan noticed the interaction. Tristan wheeled Nathan's chair closer.

"What a fortunate encounter! We were just searching for you, Ms. Sinclair," Tristan said cheerfully. Evelyn disregarded him, focusing instead on smoothing Oliver's tousled curls.

The boy's sapphire eyes shimmered with disappointment. "I checked every deck but couldn't find your favorite white chrysanthemums." Silence fell momentarily. Evelyn thought privately, Thank goodness! Tristan barely suppressed a chuckle. "If anyone discovered white chrysanthemums aboard today, the entire staff would be dismissed!"

Oliver scrunched his nose in confusion. "Why?" Tristan adjusted his collar, avoiding explanation while Nathan rolled his eyes before addressing Evelyn.

"Evelyn, would you mind taking me to the upper deck for some air?" Evelyn clenched her jaw. Has he grown accustomed to ordering me about? She forced a polite smile. "Of course." Moving behind his wheelchair, she guided him away.

Tristan shook his head in amusement. Can't he see how reluctant she is? Is Nathan trying to court her or torment her? Oliver made to follow, but Tristan intercepted him. "Where are you off to? Don't interrupt their romantic moment."

"They're nurturing their connection!" Oliver's brow furrowed. "What connection? Muse doesn't care for Grumpy Sir! She only likes me!" He planted small hands on his hips with an indignant huff, rebellious fire sparking in his clear eyes. "Grumpy Sir isn't worthy of Muse!"

Tristan looked down at the child with amusement. "Tsk tsk. What does a youngster know about romance? Affections must be cultivated. Can't you see how perfectly Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood complement each other?" He arched an eyebrow meaningfully. Beneath the moon's glow, the striking pair on the deck appeared divinely matched - their commanding presence and elite backgrounds creating an undeniable harmony.

Had fate not intervened so dramatically, they would have been society's ideal couple. Oliver snorted derisively and shoved Tristan's leg. "Rubbish! They're completely mismatched! Muse prefers younger gentlemen, not ancient relics like Grumpy Sir! When I grow up, I'll marry her!" Tristan's mouth fell open in surprise. Well now...this child is truly entertaining! He laughed knowingly.

"Oh ho! So you fancy Muse, do you? What a shame..." Tristan shook his head theatrically. Oliver's temper flared. "Why is it a shame?!" Tristan's eyes twinkled mischievously as he teased the boy. "It's regrettable that Muse comes from such an illustrious family. Even if she doesn't wed Mr. Blackwood, there are countless suitable matches for an advantageous union. You'd never stand a chance...unless you're obscenely wealthy."

Oliver's expression dimmed momentarily before brightening with realization. "I am wealthy! My father is Preston Sinclair! He owns half of Wall Street, and everything will be mine!" "Then have your father marry her!" Tristan retorted playfully. "Otherwise, how many decades must you wait for your inheritance?" Oliver growled in frustration. "Never!"

"I will marry Muse!" After fierce contemplation, Oliver clenched his tiny fists with determination. Storming toward his father, he found Preston conversing amiably with William Sterling. William's eyes softened at the boy's approach. If only I had such a grandson! Oliver threw himself against Preston.

He gazed up imploringly. Preston shot his son a warning look. "No tantrums today - it's a special occasion." Oliver beamed angelically, turning luminous eyes toward William with calculated innocence. "I know! It's Muse's daddy's birthday! Happy birthday, Uncle William!" William's heart melted instantly, patting his pockets for cash to reward the charming child.

Moments later, Oliver tugged Preston's sleeve urgently. "Father, I want to inherit your fortune now!"
###Chapter 434 The Consequences of His Actions

The atmosphere turned icy in an instant. William Sterling, who had been searching his pockets for his wallet, froze mid-motion.

His eyes darted to Preston Sinclair's face, which had darkened like a gathering storm. Preston's usually composed features were strained as he fought back visible irritation.

A muscle twitched in Preston's jaw. The typically unshakable businessman's mask began to crack.

"Daddy, I want my inheritance now!" Little Oliver whined, twisting his small body in an exaggerated pout. His adorable face made it impossible for Preston to discipline him.

Preston inhaled sharply. This is my flesh and blood, he reminded himself. I must be patient. He forced his voice into something resembling calm. "Now?" he asked quietly.

Oliver nodded with grave seriousness. "I can only be with my Muse after I get my inheritance!" The child's logic was flawless - the sooner the better. For his beloved Muse, he'd gladly trade his father without hesitation.

Preston's stormy gaze remained fixed on his son's cherubic face. Every ounce of his self-control was being tested.

"Then I'll... expedite matters," Preston ground out between clenched teeth. Oliver's face lit up. "When? Today? Tomorrow?" He began counting on tiny fingers.

Preston shut his eyes, taking another deep breath. His patience snapped. With dangerous precision, he grabbed Oliver by the collar of his shirt.

The motion suggested he might toss the boy like a basketball. William intervened hastily, "Children say the darndest things..."

Preston's expression smoothed into something resembling civility. "My apologies, Chairman Sterling," he said with forced politeness. "I've just remembered urgent business matters requiring my attention."

Without waiting for a response, Preston marched off with Oliver dangling from his grip, the picture of aristocratic disdain.

"Aaaah! Daddy! I need to kiss my Muse goodbye!" Oliver's protests echoed across the deck.

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen, watching the bizarre scene unfold. Before she could react, Nathan Blackwood seized her wrist. "Don't," he murmured. "Consider what we discussed."

His voice carried uncharacteristic vulnerability. Nathan knew William Sterling wouldn't let his youngest daughter remain unmarried forever. Political alliances would be made.

And he intended to position himself as the prime candidate. Who else could possibly measure up? Even knowing Preston wasn't competition, seeing Evelyn laugh with him had set Nathan's teeth on edge.

Evelyn glanced down at Nathan's restraining hand, then chuckled darkly. "Mr. Blackwood, marital alliances are about compatibility, nothing more. And you?" She smiled sweetly. "I don't make the same mistake twice."

She leaned closer, emphasizing each word. "My tastes have... evolved since my sheltered days. The things - and people - I once found appealing no longer interest me."

"Nathan" came out strangled, as if she'd physically wounded him. Evelyn gently pushed his wheelchair back. "Don't fret. I'll care for you until you recover - I owe you that much for saving my life. But feelings?" She shook her head. "Those can't be manufactured."

The proud Nathan Blackwood had never felt so utterly defeated. No matter his efforts, Evelyn remained just beyond reach. Bitterness, longing, and helpless rage left him speechless.

What recourse did he have? Throwing a tantrum would only prove her point. His knuckles whitened on the wheelchair's arms. Veins stood out along his temples, eyes burning with unshed emotion.
###Chapter 435 Father's Approval

The dim lighting concealed Nathan's expression perfectly. As Evelyn guided him back into the grand ballroom, his features had already schooled into their usual aristocratic detachment.

An icy aura surrounded him. Nathan turned to study Evelyn, his commanding presence softened only by the warmth in his gaze. When he spoke, his voice was carefully controlled, all emotions locked away.

"It's alright, I can wait. Even if there's no chance at all." His words held quiet determination. Evelyn merely rolled her eyes and continued steering him forward.

From across the room, guests couldn't help but notice how perfectly matched they appeared - two powerful figures moving in effortless harmony. Whispers spread like wildfire about an impending reconciliation between the former couple.

Imagine the industry impact if Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Holdings joined forces again! As the evening wound down, Evelyn accompanied William to bid farewell to their guests.

Nathan deliberately lingered behind. William gave him an approving smile. "Get some rest, son. Take care of yourself." The paternal concern in his voice made Evelyn's brows knit together.

Nathan nodded gracefully. "Until tomorrow then." "Indeed." Once Nathan departed, Evelyn turned to her father in astonishment. "Tomorrow? Father, what exactly have you arranged with him?"

William patted her hand, eyes twinkling with excitement. "He's planned a spectacular twenty-day global tour for my birthday present." The older man looked positively giddy. "I've been wanting to take this trip for years."

Evelyn frowned. "You're going alone?" "Don't be ridiculous, you're coming with me!" William fixed her with a stern yet hopeful gaze that brooked no argument. His expression clearly said refusal would result in immediate disinheritance.

Evelyn suddenly realized she'd been dethroned - Leo the AI tiger was now clearly the favorite child. She forced a dazzling smile. "Of course I'll join you. I'm just surprised by the suddenness."

William chuckled. "The best surprises always are! Honestly, I'm thoroughly impressed with Nathan's gift. The planning must have been immense." His satisfaction was evident.

Something about this felt calculated to Evelyn. "But I have critical projects at the office-" "Alexander can handle them. If Lucas needs to step in, he'll cover any losses." William dismissed her concerns airily, determined not to let anything spoil his plans.

Lucas, who had been approaching unnoticed, froze mid-step, eyes widening comically. "Wait, what? I have to cover losses? Since when am I the family ATM?" His outraged whisper went unheard.

Evelyn sighed in resignation. Might as well enjoy the free vacation. Lucas stomped forward dramatically. "Dad! I want to come too!" William shot him a withering look. "Not happening. You'll ruin everything."

"But I'm the best at vacations! Eating, drinking, partying - that's my specialty!" Lucas protested, gesturing wildly. "Why should I stay behind to work while they're off having fun?"

William's face flushed crimson as he clutched his chest. "Don't make me get violent on my birthday!" The threat sent Lucas scrambling backward before fleeing entirely.

Later at Sterling Manor, Evelyn finally relaxed. She spent playful moments with Leo before indulging in a long bath and skincare routine. Emerging refreshed, she laughed at the sight of the AI tiger sprawled on its back, paws waving happily.

Her thoughts returned to Nathan's unexpected travel arrangement. Since she couldn't avoid it, perhaps inviting others would make it more bearable. Decision made, she reached for her phone. "Mr. Sinclair, is Oliver available?"
###Chapter 436 Are You Coming Along?

Evelyn Sinclair ended her call and flipped open her laptop, scanning through the flood of emails in her inbox.

Exclusive content from NovelDrama.org.

The sheer volume of documents requiring her attention was staggering. Fortunately, Bennett had already filtered the most critical ones, handling the rest on her behalf.

She shot him a quick message, flagging urgent matters—especially the Kingsley Tech project. She wasn’t entirely convinced Benjamin Carter could manage everything smoothly.

As she worked, Leo, her AI tiger companion, leaped onto her lap. He propped his tiny front paws on her chest, tilting his head with exaggerated cuteness. "Mama, I miss Papa."

Evelyn, who had been about to hug him, froze. Instead, she flicked his nose lightly.

"Why on earth would you miss him?"

Leo twitched his whiskers. "It's part of my emotional interaction protocol—designed by Emily Whitaker."

"I'm programmed to think of Mama and Papa ten times a day to cultivate deep familial bonds."

Evelyn chuckled, running her fingers over his soft head. "Even emotions can be programmed now, huh?"

"Then why not think of others? Like Lucas or my father?"

At the mention of Lucas, Leo's tail flicked smugly. "Grampy says I'm the best-behaved in the Sterling family—way better than that troublemaker Lucas!"

Evelyn laughed. William Sterling never missed a chance to tease Lucas in front of Leo.

Between playful banter with Leo and finishing up work, she began packing for her trip. The light rain from the previous night had cleared, leaving the morning air crisp and sweet. Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, casting golden streaks across the room.

With no pressing meetings, Evelyn slept in, waking naturally past nine. She took her time freshening up, applying light makeup, and dressing leisurely.

Her phone remained silent. She realized belatedly that she hadn’t set a departure time with Nathan or her father the night before.

So she lingered—meditating on the balcony, stretching lazily. By the time she descended the stairs, it was nearly eleven. Voices floated up from below.

"Evelyn worked until midnight and had an early meeting this morning," William was saying, sighing dramatically. "She pushes herself too hard."

Evelyn paused mid-step, guilt prickling her conscience.

Lucas’ amused chuckle followed. Nathan’s voice, smooth and measured, cut in. "Her success comes from both brilliance and relentless effort. That’s why she’s achieved so much."

"Exactly!" William agreed enthusiastically.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Enough with the flattery," she muttered, hurrying downstairs.

Lucas lounged on the sofa, grinning. "Look who finally decided to join the living."

She shot him a glare before freezing at the sight of the full room. "Oh. You’re all here."

Without missing a beat, she added, "I just wrapped up a conference call."

William beamed, clearly buying the lie.

"Good morning, Ms. Sterling!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow, Nathan’s ever-efficient butler, greeted her warmly.

She nodded in acknowledgment. Oliver Sinclair sat obediently beside Preston, unusually subdued—likely after a stern talking-to. The moment Oliver spotted Evelyn, his eyes lit up. He glanced at his father, staying put but practically vibrating with excitement.

Nathan checked his Patek Philippe. "We should get going."

Oliver sprang up. "Yes! Let’s go! I get to travel with the prettiest lady!"

Nathan’s expression tightened imperceptibly. "You’re coming?"

"Duh!"

Nathan arched a brow. "And your father is fine with you traveling alone?"

Preston sighed, straightening his tie. "Precisely why I’ll be joining as well."
###Chapter 437 His Reputation

The moment Preston Sinclair spoke those words, every eye in the room snapped toward him with shock.

Even Evelyn Sinclair hadn't anticipated Preston's sudden declaration - she'd only invited young Oliver Sinclair last night.

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened instantly as he fixed Preston with an intense, unreadable stare.

Surely Preston Sinclair isn't dense enough to miss my warning glare? What game is he playing? Nathan thought bitterly.

William Sterling froze momentarily before quickly recovering his usual diplomatic smile.

"Wonderful! The more company the merrier!" William beamed. "It's only natural Mr. Sinclair would be concerned about Oliver's safety. Shall we depart then, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan forced a tight smile. "Certainly."

Standing off to the side, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow gaped in silent dismay. He'd orchestrated this trip specifically to create opportunities for Evelyn and Nathan.

With William along, it could pass as a family outing. But with Preston and Oliver tagging along?

Would this become some bizarre corporate retreat? Nathan's gaze shifted to Evelyn.

His icy expression melted into something warmer as his lips curved into a gentle smile. "Let's go relax for a few days."

Evelyn met his gaze and returned the smile.

"Mr. Blackwood, how thoughtful of you." Despite their tense parting last night and their complicated history, they could both pretend nothing had happened when morning came.

Teddy pushed Nathan's wheelchair with a deep frown. This wasn't part of the plan!

The helicopter waited on the lawn nearby.

Marcus assisted William aboard while Preston strode confidently up the steps, leaving young Oliver struggling behind him. The boy turned back to check if his beloved "Muse" Evelyn was following.

Evelyn lingered behind, finishing a message to Bennett. When she looked up, she saw Teddy struggling to support Nathan alone.

Frowning, she stepped forward to support Nathan's other arm.

Nathan stiffened momentarily before looking at her with undisguised delight.

Evelyn remained silent as they boarded.

"Thank you," Nathan murmured.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Blackwood, you must have remarkable stamina to travel in your condition."

What's his real motive? Why push himself to travel when injured? Before Nathan could respond, Teddy hastily interjected.

"Mr. Blackwood hasn't slept properly for days preparing for Chairman Sterling's birthday. He wanted everything perfect - the antiques, paintings, sculptures... But knowing Chairman Sterling has seen every luxury, Mr. Blackwood realized experiences matter more."

Teddy continued earnestly, "When he learned Chairman Sterling always dreamed of traveling but never could, Mr. Blackwood postponed critical meetings just to make this happen. Isn't that touching?"

Evelyn's lips twitched as she gave Teddy an amused look. "You seem intimately familiar with Mr. Blackwood's sleeping habits."

Teddy froze. "Huh?!"

Nathan's expression darkened as he shot Teddy a withering glare. My reputation is ruined!

Evelyn turned away to find her father, leaving Teddy standing in Nathan's icy shadow.

During the flight, sudden turbulence rocked the helicopter violently. Evelyn, who hadn't fastened her seatbelt, nearly tumbled from her seat.

Preston, seated beside her, instantly clamped a firm hand around hers, steadying her until she regained balance.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston released her with a slight nod. "You're welcome."

Seconds later, he suddenly reached across her body, his hand brushing against her left waist. The unexpected contact made Evelyn stiffen.

She immediately recoiled, eyeing him warily.

Preston's lips thinned. "Seatbelt," he said tersely, buckling the neglected restraint with efficient movements.
###Chapter 438 The Coveted Touch

Evelyn studied Preston's outstretched hand for a brief moment before fastening her seatbelt. A soft smile played on her lips. "Mr. Sinclair, aren't you neglecting your responsibilities by taking this much time off?"

Preston's expression remained unreadable. "Dominic isn't even in the country. Should I stay behind to entertain Victor and Benjamin? I've put the project on hold temporarily—let them handle the preliminary research."

His gaze flickered toward her. "By the time we return, we'll see what progress they've made."

Heat crept up Evelyn's neck. Guilt prickled at her conscience—she hadn't been pulling her weight at Kingsley Tech lately.

Preston adjusted his cufflinks. "Oliver insisted I come along. He's still sulking over last night's scolding."

At the mention of Oliver, Evelyn's smile widened. "So that's your real motivation? You're quite the doting father, Mr. Sinclair. He adores you."

What a heartwarming father-son bond!

Preston's lips twitched but he said nothing.

Adores me? That little schemer just wants early access to my trust fund. Secretly, he'd already instructed Oliver's tutors to triple his assignments. This vacation wouldn't be all play for the young master.

From several rows back, Nathan observed their easy banter through narrowed eyes. An unfamiliar tightness coiled in his chest—something he'd been ignoring was becoming impossible to disregard.

Beside him, Teddy shifted uncomfortably. The tension was palpable. He couldn't stand Preston Sinclair—the man's subtle yet unmistakable favoritism toward Evelyn was glaringly obvious.

With years of matchmaking experience, Teddy was 90% certain Preston harbored feelings for Evelyn. That simply wouldn't do. Clearing his throat, he leaned forward.

"Ms. Sinclair, perhaps we should switch seats? The view here is spectacular."

Evelyn frowned but before she could respond, Oliver's piping voice cut through the cabin. "Muse is trying to sleep! Stop bothering her!"

Teddy's mouth snapped shut.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. Bless that clever boy.

Oliver preened. If William hadn't dragged him to the front row, he'd be sitting with his Muse right now. Uncomfortable leaving her beside the "grumpy mister," he'd strategically enlisted his father as a placeholder.

Evelyn didn't inquire about their destination. Soon, the helicopter's gentle hum lulled her to sleep. Unconsciously, her head found its way to Preston's shoulder.

Hours later, small hands shook her awake. Oliver's excited face filled her vision. "Muse, look! A real-life castle!"

Dusk had fallen. Through the window, Evelyn saw rolling emerald hills framing an illuminated manor—grand, imposing, and shrouded in mystery like something from a Gothic novel.

The helicopter descended onto a private helipad. After being cooped up for hours, Oliver burst out the moment the doors opened, William hot on his heels.

Preston rose gracefully, then extended his hand toward Evelyn with practiced elegance. Before she could accept, Teddy wedged himself between them. "Allow me! I'll assist Ms. Sinclair."

His protective stance blocked Preston completely.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and descended unaided. Crisp night air greeted her, the sky ablaze with stars. A team of butlers approached briskly.

Teddy froze—Nathan still hadn't disembarked. Flushing, he turned to Evelyn with an awkward smile. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps you could help Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 439 A World Unveiled

Evelyn froze mid-step. Why was Nathan descending so quickly? She spun around to see Nathan maneuvering his wheelchair down the ramp unassisted. The precarious angle made it look like he might tumble down the stairs at any moment.

One wrong move and they'd be rushing him to the emergency room instead of beginning their long-awaited vacation.

"Stop! Don't move!" Evelyn commanded sharply.

Nathan immediately stilled, waiting obediently for assistance. Before Evelyn could reach him, she noticed Marcus standing just behind Nathan's wheelchair. The bodyguard had been loading their luggage and hadn't yet disembarked from the helicopter.

Marcus's expression darkened as he set down the suitcases.

Without waiting for instructions, he firmly pushed Nathan's wheelchair down the ramp. Nathan's shoulders tensed in surprise at the unexpected assistance.

The ramp was stable, and Marcus applied just enough pressure to control the descent. Within moments, the wheelchair touched down safely on the cobblestone path.

Nathan's jaw clenched with unspoken irritation. He had no way to voice his displeasure.

Marcus turned to retrieve the remaining luggage. Catching Evelyn's eye, he said, "Miss Sinclair, my assistance is always available when you require it."

Evelyn offered a grateful smile. "Thank you, Marcus." Without his intervention, she would have needed to help Nathan down herself.

She glanced briefly at Nathan before striding ahead to join William.

Theodore swallowed hard. "Much obliged, Marcus," he murmured before rushing to take control of Nathan's wheelchair. Leaning close, he whispered, "Patience, sir. We'll have ample opportunities later. Remember Marcus represents Ms. Sinclair's interests."

Nathan remained silent.

His expression was unreadable, eyes like chips of ice. Marcus and Evelyn were clearly operating on different wavelengths.

The chateau staff had prepared meticulously for their arrival, setting out an array of teas and pastries tailored to each guest's preferences.

As Nathan entered, the servants bowed in unison. "Good evening, Mr. Blackwood."

He acknowledged them with a curt nod.

"Chairman Sterling," Theodore inquired, "would you prefer to rest or take an evening stroll first?"

William looked invigorated. "I'm ready to explore."

Nathan gave a slight nod, not bothering to consult the others. To the butler, he simply said, "Make the arrangements."

"At once, sir."

Their convoy departed immediately. Within minutes, the cars halted along the banks of River Aurora.

Moonlight danced across the water's tranquil surface. Evelyn caught her breath at the familiar sight. "River Aurora?" Her voice held a note of delighted surprise.

This place held countless memories from her student days in France. She'd walked these banks endlessly, confiding both joys and sorrows to the flowing waters.

Few pedestrians wandered the riverside at this hour, mostly couples enjoying romantic strolls. William was already enthusiastically following young Oliver Sinclair along the water's edge.

Preston Sinclair stood motionless nearby, his imposing silhouette framed against the Gothic architecture across the river.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled like the stars reflected in the water. Nathan allowed himself a small smile. Theodore had chosen well.

As Nathan began wheeling himself toward Evelyn, Marcus stepped forward to assist.

Theodore intercepted quickly, grasping Marcus's arm with a diplomatic smile. "Allow me," he said smoothly.
###Chapter 440 Push You Back

Nathan Blackwood finally got his wish fulfilled as Evelyn Sinclair wheeled him along the banks of River Aurora.

Evelyn was completely absorbed in the picturesque scenery, deliberately ignoring Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's incessant chatter.

With the others gone, Nathan's expression visibly relaxed. Ahead of them stood a muscular, tattooed street performer playing violin.

The musician was deeply immersed in his performance, drawing a small crowd.

Had the music been elegant and refined, paired with the gentle flow of the river, the scene would have been breathtaking.

Unfortunately, the busker was clearly an amateur. The screeching notes resembled an elderly woman's wails, painfully assaulting the ears. Evelyn unconsciously moved closer and stopped.

Nathan listened impassively. When the dreadful performance finally ended, the relieved audience quickly dispersed.

The busker noticed the wheelchair-bound man and his stunning companion. His gaze lingered on Evelyn with pity, clearly thinking she deserved better than being with a disabled man.

Nathan's brow furrowed in thought. "Do you understand my art?" the busker challenged. "If not, move along!" His judgmental stare assessed Nathan, finding only good looks and useless legs.

The disdain in the musician's attitude was palpable. Nathan arched an eyebrow. "It was terrible."

"What did you say?" The busker's eyes turned icy, his tattooed arms flexing threateningly.

Evelyn, still caught in the romantic atmosphere, was startled when Nathan suddenly provoked the stranger.

"It was absolutely dreadful," Nathan repeated calmly, his voice like winter frost.

As the enraged musician rolled up his sleeves, Evelyn acted quickly. "Apologies, this man has mental issues. If you want to fight someone, try him!" She pointed to Marcus, their bodyguard trailing behind them.

She hastily pushed Nathan's wheelchair away, the ride becoming bumpy in her haste to escape.

"Evelyn," Nathan finally called out, amusement dancing in his eyes. This uncharacteristic retreat was unlike her.

"I'm being generous by not abandoning you there," she retorted. "Didn't your butler Teddy arrange proper security?"

Hearing her cold tone, Nathan remained silent before finally murmuring, "It truly was awful." As CEO of Blackwood Enterprises, he wouldn't lie to flatter some random street performer.

"Then I'll take you back so you can tell him personally," Evelyn said coolly.

Before she could turn around, Nathan gripped the wheelchair arms tightly. "Don't!" He felt strangely helpless, but with Evelyn, he'd allow it.

"Let's not go back. Look how the river sparkles like diamonds," he deflected. "If not for my current condition, I wouldn't be retreating!" The thought was laughable.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic coward!"

They reached the center of a quaint bridge, where a peaceful, intoxicating atmosphere enveloped them. Nathan studied Evelyn's profile as she leaned against the railing.

Her delicate features were illuminated by the soft light, eyes bright with amusement, lips curved slightly. She was breathtaking.

Suddenly, words he'd never spoken came easily. "Compared to you, every violinist in the world is garbage."
###Chapter 441 You Dare Challenge Me?

Evelyn Sinclair commanded attention wherever she went.

Just like that first night at Velvet Lounge when Nathan Blackwood first heard her play the violin on stage.

She had been radiant, passionate, and utterly self-assured.

As if every beautiful thing in the universe existed solely for her.

That memory would forever be etched in Nathan's mind.

Evelyn watched the rippling waters of River Aurora in silence.

Was this psychopath Nathan trying to ruin her perfect evening?

"I suddenly want to give you every beautiful thing this world has to offer," Nathan murmured.

Was he serious? Evelyn whirled around, eyebrows knitted together.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, fireworks exploded across the night sky behind Nathan.

Vibrant bursts of amethyst and crimson illuminated the darkness.

A breathtaking spectacle unfolded as the meteor shower cascaded toward the river's surface.

Evelyn gasped at the dazzling display reflecting off the water.

Nathan sat motionless in his wheelchair, silhouetted against the pyrotechnics. Yet he appeared anything but fragile.

His gaze never left Evelyn's awestruck face, ignoring the fireworks completely.

His eyes softened with possessive tenderness as he studied her reaction. "Do you like it?"

Evelyn caught her breath. "This was you?"

Arranging fireworks over River Aurora required navigating countless regulations. How had he managed it?

Nathan's lips curved into a smile.

Before he could answer, a tall, imposing figure approached them.

Preston Sinclair chuckled lowly. "It's King Alexander III's birthday celebration. We're fortunate to witness this projection - remarkably lifelike, isn't it?"

Evelyn turned toward Preston, her face lighting up. "What an incredible coincidence!"

Preston nodded. "There's a festival happening downstream. Your father and Oliver went to investigate. Shall we join them?"

"Absolutely!" Evelyn eagerly agreed.

She'd initially assumed Nathan orchestrated this display. What a relief to discover otherwise.

Nathan would never plan something so whimsical - his idea of romance involved throwing money and jewelry at problems.

As Evelyn reached for Nathan's wheelchair, Preston smoothly intercepted.

"Your father's looking for you," Preston said, his voice smooth as velvet. "I'll assist Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn didn't hesitate, dashing off with childlike enthusiasm.

Marcus, her ever-present bodyguard, followed close behind, leaving Theodore standing awkwardly nearby.

Preston took control of Nathan's wheelchair.

An oppressive silence descended between the two men.

The vibrant fireworks created a stark contrast to their icy standoff.

Both were titans of industry, sharp-minded and battle-hardened from years at the corporate summit.

Though they rarely interacted, each understood the other's nature perfectly.

Nathan flicked away a fallen leaf with chilling precision. His entire demeanor had shifted - this was a side of himself he never showed Evelyn.

"Mr. Sinclair," Nathan's voice dripped with menace, "your intentions extend beyond mere business collaboration, don't they?"

Preston kept one hand casually in his pocket, his towering frame radiating equal authority.

He met Nathan's piercing gaze with an amused smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, are you upset about Oliver joining us... or that I accompanied him?"

The unspoken challenge hung between them.

Preston saw no need for denial - his presence spoke volumes.

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously, their predatory glint unmistakable in the flickering light.

"You dare challenge me?"
###Chapter 442 You're Conceited

The air between the two men turned icy in an instant.

Preston Sinclair showed no aggression, his expression cool and composed, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"So what if I am?"

Nathan Blackwood struggled to contain his fury. The thought of someone else coveting what was his sent waves of irritation through him.

Preston was undeniably powerful, shrouded in mystery.

Nathan, on the other hand, commanded an empire of his own.

In terms of influence, they were evenly matched.

Nathan quickly regained his composure. Anger was a weakness, and he refused to be the one to falter first. His face darkened as the intermittent bursts of fireworks cast shifting shadows over his grim expression.

"Mr. Sinclair," Nathan said coldly, "you're far too conceited."

Why would Evelyn ever consider Preston when he already had a child and a past marriage?

Nathan knew Evelyn—she wouldn't just jump into another relationship.

Preston remained unbothered. "I'm not," he replied smoothly, exuding confidence.

Nathan turned his head slightly, shooting a sharp glance at Teddy. The man immediately stepped forward, slightly out of breath.

Teddy gave Preston a knowing look before deliberately saying, "Mr. Blackwood, you should seize this moment under the moonlight. You and Ms. Sinclair belong together—don't let this opportunity slip away."

Without another word, Teddy pushed Nathan's wheelchair, swiftly leaving Preston behind.

Preston watched them go, chuckling softly before his gaze drifted toward the riverside.

The walkway was alive with people.

Evelyn walked arm-in-arm with Oliver, both of them laughing as they explored the vibrant stalls.

William Sterling looked on with pure contentment. Having his daughter by his side, enjoying such a carefree evening, was everything he could ask for.

Evelyn had decided that since she was in France, she might as well catch up with old friends.

She had already made plans to meet them the following night.

Meanwhile, Teddy leaned in slightly as he pushed Nathan's chair. "Mr. Blackwood, I have a feeling Mr. Sinclair has his eyes on Ms. Sinclair. She’s extraordinary—it’s no surprise."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Teddy continued, "And honestly, their rapport seems stronger than yours."

Nathan’s expression darkened further.

Teddy quickly backtracked. "But I doubt Ms. Sinclair is interested. He’s wealthy, sure, but he’s got baggage—a child from a previous marriage. Inheritance disputes alone would be a nightmare." He sighed dramatically. "Rich people problems, am I right?"

Nathan’s tension eased slightly.

Then Teddy added, "Though… she does seem fond of the kid. What if she doesn’t mind being a stepmother?"

"Shut up." Nathan’s voice was dangerously low, his grip on the armrest turning his knuckles white.

"If that day ever comes," he said through gritted teeth, "I’ll throw you into the River Aurora myself."

Teddy swallowed hard, the sudden chill in the air making him shiver.

He wisely decided to keep his mouth shut after that.
###Chapter 443 Master of Flattery

The group returned to the chateau well past midnight, when the last firework had faded from the sky and the streets of Paris grew quiet.

Highland Estates glowed warmly against the night. The ever-efficient butler had prepared a late supper.

Servants guided everyone to their respective suites.

William Sterling retired immediately, exhaustion lining his face. Preston Sinclair carried the sleeping Oliver in his arms toward the east wing.

Evelyn Sinclair felt weary too, her appetite diminished. As she ascended the grand staircase, she noticed Nathan Blackwood's suite stood directly across from hers.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow appeared with a silver tray. "Ms. Sterling, you barely touched dinner." His voice carried that practiced concern only elite staff perfected. "Some light refreshments before bed? They'll help you sleep."

When Evelyn hesitated, Teddy smoothly maneuvered into her room. "Did you know?" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Mr. Blackwood personally arranged tonight's fireworks display! Coordinated with six government departments and spent nearly twenty million euros—just so you could see fireworks over River Aurora!"

He sighed dramatically. "If I were a woman, I'd be so moved I could die happy right now."

Evelyn's breath caught. "The fireworks...weren't they for King Alexander III's birthday celebration?"

Teddy's expression twisted in theatrical surprise. "What an odd coincidence! Then this Alexander fellow got terribly lucky." He waved a dismissive hand. "Those fireworks were absolutely not for him. Mr. Blackwood said your Paris tour couldn't be ordinary—it might disappoint you and Chairman Sterling. So he orchestrated this entire spectacle."

Leaning closer, he added, "When has France ever celebrated a monarch's birthday with such extravagance?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her shawl. During her years studying in France, she couldn't recall any grand celebrations for historical kings' birthdays. Not that she'd paid much attention—she'd always joined festivities on whim rather than tradition.

This had been Nathan's doing. Entirely.

"That's...excessive," she murmured, the weight of yet another unpayable debt settling on her shoulders.

Across the hallway, a door clicked open.

Nathan stood framed in the doorway, leaning slightly on an ebony cane. His tall silhouette appeared almost healthy—if one ignored the pallor of his face. Dark hair fell carelessly across his forehead, giving him an uncharacteristically approachable air.

"Why aren't you two resting?" His voice, rich and low, carried down the corridor.

Teddy practically bounced from Evelyn's room. "Ms. Sterling discovered you arranged the fireworks! She's so touched she nearly wept." The butler clasped his hands dramatically. "She said despite your busy schedule, you still—"

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

"—found time for such grand gestures, proving your thoughtfulness. Now she prays for your swift recovery, so you might stand together along River Aurora, hand in hand, beneath the fireworks!"

Evelyn's door nearly slammed shut from the force of her disbelief. She'd said four words—four simple words—and Teddy had spun them into this...this absurd romantic soliloquy!

Her gaze sharpened on the unflappable butler. Teddy hadn't become Nathan's head of household merely by being Harrison's cousin, had he? This man could flatter royalty into abdicating their thrones.

Nathan's lips quirked. The usual ice in his gaze softened as it swept over Evelyn, amusement dancing in those dark depths.

"Don't cry," he murmured, the words tender yet teasing. He promised to recover quickly—for her sake, apparently.

With his hair slightly mussed and wearing casual loungewear, Nathan looked nothing like the untouchable CEO of Blackwood Enterprises. Here, he seemed almost...human.

Evelyn stared between the two men, utterly speechless. Nathan actually believed Teddy's ridiculous fabrication? How had this man built a business empire with such gullibility?

Preposterous!
###Chapter 444 Shouldn't Waste Food

Evelyn Sinclair nearly unleashed a biting remark, but the memory of tonight's fireworks softened her tone.

"You're overthinking. Get some rest." Just as she was about to close the door, Nathan Blackwood tilted his head slightly and murmured,

"I'm hungry."

"I want what you're having!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow chimed in eagerly. "That's the last portion, Ms. Sinclair! It'd be dull eating alone—why not share with Mr. Blackwood? A private midnight supper for two!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes but stayed silent.

Nathan added quietly, "I won't eat much."

All he wanted was to sit with her for one meal.

Evelyn arched a brow and let out a light, humorless laugh. She turned, picked up the tray, and shoved it into Teddy's hands.

"Fine. I'm not hungry anymore. It's all yours."

She instantly regretted holding back her sharp words earlier. Nathan's infuriating habit of pushing his luck made her want to strangle him.

Nathan frowned. "That's not what I meant."

"But I do," she countered smoothly. "Aren't you starving?" She met his gaze pointedly.

He hadn't eaten anything earlier.

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, by all means, take it all. Let me just waste away!"

Nathan froze. He'd hoped to exploit Evelyn's momentary softness to mend things between them. He'd forgotten how stubborn she could be.

Before he could react, Evelyn thrust the tray fully into Teddy's grasp.

"Teddy, make sure Mr. Blackwood doesn't choke," she said sweetly before slamming her door shut.

Nathan gritted his teeth, exhaling sharply in frustration.

She never compromises.

His chest tightened.

Teddy stood awkwardly with the tray. He'd prepared this meal specifically for Evelyn, tailored to her tastes. Nathan wouldn't appreciate it.

Swallowing, Teddy forced a smile. "Mr. Blackwood, you should eat on Ms. Sinclair's behalf! She offered it so generously—think of it as extra nourishment for your recovery!"

Nathan only glared.

Teddy sighed and stared at the food. "Fine. I'll eat it. Can't let good food go to waste."

Back in her room, Evelyn opened the photo William Sterling had sent her.

It was a snapshot from the bridge—fireworks bursting behind them, the river shimmering below. Evelyn gazed at the water, unaware of Nathan watching her from his wheelchair, his expression unbearably tender.

Time seemed suspended in that frame.

She knew why her father had taken this picture.

Even he had been moved.

But not her.

Evelyn deleted the photo without hesitation and opened her doctoral group chat.

The group had been buzzing since they learned she was in France. One member brought up today's headlines.

[Did you see the fireworks over River Aurora? Every major outlet is scrambling for details! A once-in-a-century spectacle!]

[Remember your first birthday here, Ev? You wrote in the university's public record that your wish was to see fireworks on these banks! That book might still be there.]

Evelyn scrolled, her mind blanking for a second.

Then it hit her.

She'd completely forgotten.

Watching fireworks along River Aurora had been her first birthday wish—scribbled hastily during her lonely first year in France. Back then, she'd had nothing real to wish for, so she'd written something frivolous, never expecting it to come true.

Until tonight.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Her chest constricted, breath turning shallow.

Did Nathan do this because of my wish?

She set her phone aside and looked out the window. The chateau's warm lights glowed against the rain-drenched gardens, dreamlike in the mist.

A faint drizzle streaked the glass.

Evelyn laughed softly. Just a coincidence. How would he even know?

Then her phone buzzed.

A message from Nathan:

To the brilliant and breathtaking Ms. Sinclair,
May all your wishes come true.
—Your eternal admirer.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, exasperated, but a reluctant smirk tugged at her lips. She typed back:

Having you as a fan is my greatest misfortune.
###Chapter 445 Take Him

The rain had finally stopped after pouring all night, leaving the air thick with moisture and an unexpected chill.

Perhaps it was the sudden weather shift that caused Nathan Blackwood to collapse with a raging fever. Teddy Winslow noticed first, immediately summoning the family physician.

By dawn, the fever broke but left Nathan weak and bedridden. His usually sharp features appeared drawn, his complexion alarmingly pale against the silk sheets.

William Sterling visited multiple times throughout the morning, concern etching deep lines across his forehead. When Nathan managed to speak, his voice emerged as a rough whisper.

"Mr. Sterling, if you're bored, I can arrange a driver to show you around the city. A little rain never hurt anyone," William said, patting Nathan's shoulder through the blankets.

Nathan's dry chuckle turned into a cough. "Seeing you hovering like this might give me another fever." His eyes darted around the room before settling on William with visible disappointment. "Where's Evelyn?"

William cleared his throat. "She mentioned wanting to visit the university before her class reunion. Should be leaving soon."

Nathan's fingers twitched against the sheets. "Send someone with her."

"Marcus is going."

"Take Teddy too," Nathan insisted between coughs.

Teddy's eyes widened in understanding. "Absolutely! Marcus and I make the perfect security team. No danger would dare approach Ms. Sterling with us around!"

William hesitated, not quite seeing the value in sending the portly butler along. Then he remembered the recent assassination attempt and nodded. "Very well."

Teddy practically bounced with enthusiasm. "You have my word - not a single suspicious character will get within ten feet of her!" He scurried from the room before anyone could reconsider.

Evelyn emerged from her suite to find Teddy standing proudly beside Marcus, who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. She arched an eyebrow. "Shouldn't you be tending to Nathan?"

Teddy stepped forward with a theatrical bow. "Mr. Blackwood insisted I accompany you as additional protection. A radiant jewel like yourself must be safeguarded at all times!"

Evelyn fought the urge to roll her eyes. "You? As protection?"

Teddy puffed out his chest. "Don't let my physique fool you! I may not have combat skills, but I'm practically bulletproof! My mere presence terrifies evildoers."

Evelyn massaged her temples but waved him along. "Fine. Just don't get in the way."

Teddy immediately snatched her handbag. "A queen shouldn't carry her own belongings! These delicate arms were made for finer things." He shot Marcus a triumphant look. "Mind the step, Your Highness!"

Marcus exhaled sharply through his nose as they descended to the waiting car. Raindrops speckled the windows as they drove through Paris' winding streets, Marcus rigid in the front seat while Evelyn scrolled through reunion updates in the back.

Most classmates had scattered across the globe, but a handful remained in France. The car slowed before the university's grand gates, and Evelyn's breath caught at the familiar sight.

Centuries-old spires rose against the gray sky, their Gothic arches whispering of knowledge and tradition. Though she'd earned her doctorate elsewhere, this campus held special meaning - the place where she'd first expanded Sterling Corporation into Europe while completing her studies.

Marcus maintained a respectful distance as they walked, allowing Evelyn space to reminisce. Teddy, however, stuck to her side like an overeager shadow.

"Magnificent!" he exclaimed at a marble fountain, disrupting the peaceful atmosphere. "Simply breathtaking architecture!" His voice echoed across the quiet quad.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, already regretting this arrangement. Some homecoming this was turning out to be.
###Chapter 446 Talk More

"Wow! This place looks straight out of a fairytale!" Theodore's constant chatter snapped Evelyn out of her nostalgic reverie.

She sighed, losing all interest in admiring her familiar surroundings. Her pace quickened.

Why did Father insist on sending Teddy along? Evelyn stopped before an elegant cottage at the rear of campus, turning to face her unwanted companion.

"You and Marcus wait here. I won't be long with my professor."

Teddy scrunched his face, teeth gritted. "But Ms. Sinclair, is your professor male or female? I should get a gift—we must represent Montecito hospitality properly!"

Evelyn rolled her emerald eyes. "I already brought perfume." She gestured to her bag. "Hand it over."

Perfume? Must be a woman! Teddy thought triumphantly as he passed the designer handbag. "What a privilege to meet your mentor! Take your time—we'll be perfectly fine out here."

As if I'd worry about them. Evelyn shot Teddy a withering look but restrained herself—this serene setting deserved better than her temper.

She snatched her bag and disappeared inside. Teddy exhaled in relief, immediately texting Nathan: "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair visited her female professor today. She sighed seven times during the walk—clearly pining for you! Get well soon!"

Message sent, Teddy bounded toward Marcus. "Ice cream? My treat!"

"Buzz off," Marcus grunted.

Inside the library's deepest corner, Evelyn found a gaunt man hunched over a laptop, fingers flying across keys as incomprehensible code filled the screen. Memories flooded back.

Some things never change. Her shoulders relaxed. "Sebastian?"

The typing stopped. He turned, revealing messy brown hair and several days' stubble. Exhausted eyes brightened upon seeing her. "Evie?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a genuine smile as she embraced him. "I didn't announce my Paris trip, but knew you'd be here."

Sebastian chuckled. Though handsome beneath the dishevelment, he'd never cared for appearances. His sharp hazel eyes, however, remained eagle-like in their intensity—the same genius Harvard professor who'd taken a research position here.

At first glance, no one would guess his credentials. He lounged casually, legs crossed, wearing that trademark roguish grin.

"You're still my only student worth teaching," he said. "Everyone else exhausts me."

Evelyn produced a velvet box from her bag. "The limited edition Parfums de Marly you've been collecting."

Sebastian's smile faltered. He accepted the gift with trembling fingers. "Thank you for remembering, but...he passed three months ago. He'll never see this collection complete."

Evelyn froze. After everything they'd endured to be together—Sebastian moving continents for his love—their story ended so abruptly.

Sebastian forced a smile, clutching the box. "He'll know when I tell him though."

"I'm so sorry, I didn't—"

"It's alright." He waved her off. "Now, what brings you here?"

"Just visiting."

"Really?" His eyebrow arched. "With that dashing Mr. Blackwood you're so fond of?"

"The man I loved is dead," Evelyn said softly, the words hanging between them like ghosts.
###Chapter 447: Fate's Unexpected Encounter

Sebastian Laurent knew exactly how deeply Evelyn Sinclair had once loved that man.

He had witnessed her struggles, her heartbreak, the way she poured her soul into loving him.

He had seen her fight, her persistence, the lengths she went to just for his attention.

"That man is dead? What a pity," Sebastian sighed. "The person I loved is also gone." Evelyn lowered her gaze, silent.

Nathan Blackwood was no longer the man she had once been obsessed with.

To her, Nathan Blackwood had died long ago.

After all the twists and turns, her heart had changed completely by the time she returned to the place where it all began.

Meanwhile, in Highland Estates, the supposedly "dead" Nathan Blackwood suddenly sneezed.

The servants immediately stiffened, alert.

Evelyn and Sebastian exchanged a quiet glance.

Then, Sebastian's eyes lit up. "Oh! Let me introduce you to my first student—still single, by the way!"

Evelyn barely reacted. "That won't be necessary."

"He's already here! What timing!" Sebastian grinned. "Speak of the devil!"

Evelyn turned, her mood complicated.

The moment she saw the man, her body froze. Her eyes widened in shock.

"Mr. Sinclair?!"

Standing before her was none other than the impeccably dressed Preston Sinclair.

When Preston spotted Evelyn, surprise flickered across his face—but only for a second. His expression smoothed into calm indifference.

"Ms. Sterling," he said coolly. "What brings you here?"

"You two know each other?!" Sebastian looked even more stunned.

Evelyn and Preston nodded simultaneously.

Sebastian shook his head in disbelief. "Then this is fate! A match made in heaven!"

An awkward silence fell.

Evelyn frowned. "Don't be ridiculous. We just have business dealings."

It was the truth.

Sebastian nodded in understanding. "Right, I forgot—my only two students are both powerhouses on the Forbes list. Of course you'd cross paths."

Preston chuckled. "Two students? The other one is Ms. Sterling?"

Evelyn was even more astonished. She barely kept her composure.

What kind of absurd coincidence was this?!

Sebastian Laurent, the genius professor, had always kept his students' identities strictly confidential. No one knew who they were—not even each other.

Sebastian pointed at Evelyn. "Yep, that's her."

Preston's gaze sharpened with interest. "Sebastian, given your standards, I never expected you to take on another student. And for it to be Ms. Sterling… what are the odds?"

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Extremely low, apparently."

Sebastian gestured at Preston with a grin. "He's two years older than me. Became my student after losing to me in an international hacking competition."

Then he pointed at Evelyn. "She became my student because she beat me in the European International Tournament."

Preston's smile deepened. "Ms. Sterling, I didn’t know you had an interest in coding."

Evelyn was a brilliant businesswoman, the heiress of a wealthy family. Preston hadn’t expected her to have such skills.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Just a hobby from my past."

Preston didn’t press further.

Sebastian studied them both, his gaze flickering with amusement. "You two are clearly meant to be. Don’t waste this opportunity."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Stop meddling." She smoothly turned to Preston, changing the subject. "Oliver didn’t come with you?"

Preston replied, "He’s still intimidated by teachers, honestly."

Evelyn nodded in understanding.

Outside, Marcus stood guard, watching the scene unfold.

Despite his professional training, even he couldn’t hide his surprise at seeing Preston Sinclair there.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow hurried over with two ice cream cones, slightly out of breath.

"Marcus, take one! You can have chocolate. I’ll take strawberry."
###Chapter 448 Stay Outside

Marcus stood motionless like a statue carved from granite.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow circled him impatiently, waving two melting ice cream cones.

"Just take one! Evelyn will be chatting for ages. Women always have endless things to discuss!"

Marcus didn't even blink.

Teddy dramatically took an exaggerated bite, letting the vanilla drip down his chin. "Mmm! Heavenly!"

Marcus shot him a withering glare before refocusing on the glass partition. Through the transparent barrier, he could see Evelyn Sinclair engaged in animated conversation with two men.

Teddy followed his gaze mid-chew.

The ice cream cones slipped from his trembling hands, splattering on the marble floor. "Holy mother of— Who are those men?!"

His face turned ashen.

"That's Preston Sinclair sitting beside Evelyn! Since when—" Teddy clutched his chest as if having a coronary. "This can't be happening!"

Marcus rolled his eyes at the mess.

Teddy staggered forward, pointing at the glass with a shaking finger. "How?! When did Mr. Sinclair arrive? And who's that distinguished gentleman with Evelyn? Two men appeared during my five-minute ice cream break? Nathan will have my head for this!"

The mere thought of Nathan Blackwood's reaction made Teddy's knees buckle. He turned pleading eyes to Marcus. "Tell me they just arrived."

Marcus snorted. "Preston was already inside when we got here."

"Before Evelyn?!" Teddy moaned, looking skyward. The gathering storm clouds mirrored his despair.

He'd assumed Preston and his son were still at the estate when they'd left that morning. This oversight shook Teddy to his core. For the first time, he doubted his matchmaking abilities.

"No, I must salvage this!" Teddy slapped his cheeks. "If I lose Nathan's patronage, I'm finished! Who else can reunite those two stubborn lovebirds? Only Theodore Winslow possesses the necessary finesse!"

Within seconds, Teddy transformed from despondent to determined. "I'll whisk Evelyn away before Nathan finds out! Operation Love Rescue commences now!"

Marcus watched Teddy's manic mood swings with detached amusement. Definitely needs psychiatric evaluation, he thought, moving to a different vantage point to monitor Evelyn.

Teddy straightened his tie and marched toward the library doors—until his phone buzzed with a message from "Goddess Evelyn":

[Wait outside. Do NOT enter.]

His shoulders slumped. Defeated, Teddy trudged back to a bench, pressing his nose against the glass like a forlorn puppy. "So cruel," he muttered.

Inside, Evelyn slipped her phone away with an enigmatic smile. Her attention returned to Sebastian Laurent, who was passionately explaining his latest quantum physics breakthrough.

She glimpsed traces of the brilliant young professor she'd once studied under.

After an hour of enthusiastic lecturing, Sebastian paused, throat dry. His audience of two had only offered occasional nods.

"Hmph! Such disengaged students!" He tapped the table pointedly. "I have research awaiting. Don't you have places to be?"

Evelyn and Preston rose in perfect synchronization. "Goodbye, Professor." No unnecessary pleasantries—just efficient exits.

Sebastian harrumphed. "Don't come back!"

Evelyn tossed a playful glance over her shoulder, eyes sparkling with mischief. "As you wish!"
###Chapter 449 You're Ugly

Preston Sinclair glanced at Evelyn and chuckled. "You really know how to push Sebastian Laurent's buttons, don't you?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with amusement as she smiled. "Someone needs to keep his temper in check occasionally."

Preston nodded in agreement. As they stepped outside, Teddy Winslow rushed to greet them. "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood was worried you might be hungry since you skipped breakfast this morning." He beamed. "A man who's attentive, kind, and wealthy—now that's a rare combination!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and shot Teddy a warning look. "The world wouldn't miss one less of his kind." Teddy shrank back, hesitating before he cleared his throat and strategically positioned himself between Evelyn and Preston.

The trio walking together made for an odd sight—two tall, striking figures flanking a short, round obstacle in the middle.

Completely oblivious to ruining the picturesque moment, Teddy bounced along like an overexcited rabbit. "Mr. Sinclair, I didn't expect to see you here either! Ms. Sinclair, weren't you visiting your professor? What a coincidence, right? Hahaha!"

Preston remained silent, continuing forward without acknowledging him.

Evelyn swore to herself she'd never bring Teddy along again. She turned her attention to the scenery, pointedly ignoring him. Teddy's enthusiasm deflated slightly.

Then, an idea struck him. He turned to Marcus, stretching out his plump arm eagerly. "Marcus! Take a photo of us! It's not every day Ms. Sinclair visits campus—we should capture the moment!"

Marcus narrowed his eyes at Evelyn, who hesitated before nodding. "Fine."

Marcus pulled out his phone calmly. Preston lingered, debating whether to excuse himself when Evelyn called out, "Mr. Sinclair, care to join us?"

Preston lowered his gaze for a brief moment before nodding. He stepped closer, leaning slightly toward Evelyn.

Teddy's cheerful expression faltered for a second before he plastered on another grin. She's just being polite. That's all.

He stretched his arms above his head, forming a heart shape with his fingers, grinning widely. This was his moment—standing in the same frame as the legendary Goddess Evelyn Sinclair!

Separated by Teddy, Preston stood with his usual regal composure, expressionless as if facing a press conference. Marcus raised the phone but hesitated before snapping the shot. Teddy's arms trembled from the effort of holding the pose.

"Marcus, what's taking so long?" Teddy complained, his arms aching.

Marcus lowered the phone. "It's ugly."

"Ugly?!" Teddy gasped, scandalized. "How could you associate that word with Ms. Sinclair? She's flawless!"

Marcus narrowed his eyes. "You're ugly."

The air turned icy. Teddy crossed his arms indignantly. "I don't believe you!" He stomped toward Marcus, ready to argue.

Before he could reach him, Marcus suddenly lifted the phone again.

Click.

The shutter sound echoed as the photo was taken. Marcus lowered the device calmly. "Now that's a good picture."

With that, he walked past Teddy and handed the phone to Evelyn. "What do you think, Miss?"

Evelyn took it, her lips curving into a smile as she studied the image.
###Chapter 450 The Provocation

The photograph captured the misty ambiance of a light drizzle.

Preston Sinclair and Evelyn Sinclair stood without umbrellas, their hair and clothes lightly dampened by the fine spray of rain.

The background blurred softly, leaving the two figures in sharp focus.

After Teddy stormed off in a huff, a noticeable gap remained between Evelyn and Preston.

They stood with regal poise, their postures effortlessly elegant.

Their gazes met, and the warmth in their smiles illuminated the frame. The image was breathtakingly harmonious.

"Not bad, is it?" Preston stepped closer, glancing at the phone screen.

Evelyn hummed in agreement. "Mm. Even a candid shot looks good when the subjects are photogenic." She saved the picture to her own phone.

It had been a while since she last updated her social media. With a quick tap, she posted the photo with a simple caption:

A moment worth remembering.

Within seconds, Isabella and Natalie had already liked it. Even Tristan Whitmore reacted almost instantly.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and tucked her phone away, handing Marcus his device with a polite smile. Marcus accepted it wordlessly and retreated to his original position.

The brief interruption was quickly forgotten.

Teddy tried to wedge himself between the two again, but Marcus caught him by the arm.

"Let me go! I want to stand with them!" Teddy wriggled, attempting to use his bulk to break free.

Marcus tightened his grip effortlessly, immobilizing him.

"Stay here," Marcus said flatly.

"Why?" Teddy pouted.

"Because I don’t want to see that eyesore again."

As Evelyn’s bodyguard, Marcus had to walk behind her. Teddy barging into his line of sight was nothing short of torture.

Teddy huffed, crossing his arms. "I thought we were friends!"

Marcus gave him a deadpan look. "Absolutely not."

Evelyn and Preston strolled leisurely out of the campus, drawing admiring glances from passing students. Their striking looks and aristocratic bearing naturally commanded attention.

"So, Teddy was sent by Mr. Blackwood?" Preston’s tone was light, almost indifferent. "He must care for you a great deal."

Evelyn arched a brow. "My father probably asked him to tag along out of concern for my safety."

Preston chuckled. "A father’s love is indeed thoughtful."

"Though it’s unfortunate that Nathan’s carefully arranged trip was ruined by the rain. He even fell ill because of it. I suspect this outing will be cut short." Her voice was cool, detached.

Preston smirked. "Not necessarily. It seems Mr. Blackwood is quite determined to create opportunities with you."

"Pointless," Evelyn said flatly. "As long as my father is pleased, that’s all that matters."

Her tone was firm. She knew the difference between love and gratitude. Right now, all she felt toward Nathan was the latter—along with a lingering guilt.

She hoped those buried emotions would never resurface.

Preston’s sudden question didn’t irritate her. Perhaps it was because of their recent encounters, their shared connection with Sebastian Laurent.

"My apologies," Preston murmured. "I didn’t mean to upset you." His voice was as soft as the drizzle around them.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "It’s fine. Whether you bring him up or not, he still exists."

Preston studied her profile for a long moment before speaking again.

"This might be presumptuous of me, but there’s something I’ve been curious about. You don’t have to answer if it makes you uncomfortable."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Go ahead, Mr. Sinclair."

She answered only what she chose to, anyway.

"Ms. Sterling," he began, his gaze steady. "Do you still have feelings for Mr. Blackwood?"

The question was blunt, direct—because he wanted the truth.

It was the question everyone wanted answered.

Evelyn’s jaw tensed slightly. She didn’t respond immediately, but the shadows in her eyes deepened.
###Chapter 451 Send Me the Photo

Evelyn Sinclair had declared countless times that she no longer harbored feelings for Nathan Blackwood. Yet, no one truly believed her.

Did they all assume this was just another one of her dramatic episodes with Nathan?

Just as Preston Sinclair thought she wouldn’t answer his question, Evelyn laughed.

Her expression was radiant, her confidence innate. There was a spark of defiance in her gaze, a magnetic allure that couldn’t be ignored.

"If loving someone is supposed to last a lifetime, does that mean you never intend to remarry after your wife’s passing?"

Her retort was just as bold and direct as his question. But Evelyn couldn’t soften her words—not when his inquiry had made her blood boil.

Preston froze.

For a moment, he was taken aback by her sharpness. But instead of anger, a low chuckle escaped him. His lips curved into an amused smile.

"Understood."

He didn’t need to answer. They both knew the truth.

And in that moment, something unfamiliar stirred in Preston’s chest.

He hadn’t remarried because he hadn’t met the right person. With his status, he didn’t need to settle—nor did he require a marriage of convenience.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow trailed behind them, nearly dying of anxiety.

He had heard Evelyn’s response, but it made no sense to him.

What the hell does that mean?!

Why is Ms. Sinclair asking if Mr. Sinclair plans to remarry?

Is she mocking him for being widowed?

Or is she telling him to stay away from her?

Does that mean she still loves Nathan but is too proud to admit it?

That has to be it!

Inside Highland Estates, Nathan’s condition had improved.

The staff attended to him with meticulous care, not daring to slack off.

Leaning against the leather couch, his face still pale, Nathan stared at the email Harrison had sent him. His phone buzzed incessantly.

A glance confirmed it was Tristan Whitmore.

Nathan ignored it.

But Tristan was relentless.

Annoyed, Nathan slammed his laptop shut and snatched up the phone, his voice icy.

"Speak. And it better be important."

If it wasn’t, Tristan would regret this call.

Tristan hesitated, unable to hide the urgency in his voice.

"What are you doing? Did you go to France with Evelyn?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"Yes. And I’m hanging up if this is all you have to say."

"Hmph! You ditched me for Costa Azul but went on a trip with Evelyn?! Since when do you abandon your friends for love?!"

Nathan’s fingers twitched.

"But—why the hell did Preston Sinclair go with you? I don’t get this weird dynamic between you three."

Nathan’s grip on the phone tightened.

"How do you know?"

No one had been informed of their travel plans. Preston certainly wouldn’t have announced it.

"Everyone knows! Evelyn posted a picture with Preston. You didn’t see it?"

A pause. Then, Tristan’s voice dropped.

"Oh. Right. She blocked you."

Nathan’s expression darkened.

"What photo?"

Tristan swallowed, sensing the dangerous shift in Nathan’s tone. He didn’t dare tease him now.

"Uh… it’s just the two of them. Looks like some kind of official announcement. People are speculating if they’re dating."

His voice grew quieter with each word, the chill from the other end of the line palpable.

Nathan’s fingers clenched.

"Send it to me."

"Okay, but—"

The line went dead.
###Chapter 452 Get Back Here

The photograph arrived on Nathan's phone screen. His knuckles turned white as he gripped the device, his face darkening instantly.

A dangerous glint flashed in his stormy gray eyes. The two figures captured in the drizzle looked like they belonged in some romantic film.

Their gazes held an intimacy that made Nathan's stomach churn. Unspoken understanding passed between them, their eyes filled with unmistakable familiarity and something more painful - regret. Regret for not having met sooner.

When had Evelyn grown this close to him? Nathan's jaw clenched so tight it ached. After what felt like an eternity, he dialed Teddy.

"Mr. Blackwood! Missing Ms. Sinclair already? She's doing splendidly. In fact, she mentioned she misses you too!" Teddy chirped.

Silence.

Teddy's smile faltered as the quiet stretched. When Nathan finally spoke, his voice could have frozen hell over. "Theodore Winslow. You dare lie to me? Should I arrange a permanent vacation for you in the River Aurora?"

Teddy's blood ran cold. "S-sir? What have I done wrong?"

Had Nathan discovered that Ms. Sinclair's professor was male? Or worse - that she'd met with Preston Sinclair?

Nathan's icy chuckle sent shivers down Teddy's spine. The unspoken threat hung between them like a guillotine blade. Teddy swallowed hard.

"Yes, there was a minor... development, but everything's under control! That professor who's obsessed with perfumes? Definitely not interested in women!" Teddy babbled.

Nathan's expression darkened further.

"And the other complication?" Teddy's heart stopped. So Nathan knew about Preston after all. He glanced at the retreating figures ahead - Evelyn and Preston looked like they'd stepped out of a romance novel. Even Marcus had commented on what a perfect picture they made.

Though Teddy privately thought Evelyn would look infinitely better beside Nathan. "Mr. Sinclair was... purely coincidental! But you needn't worry, sir! I've been shadowing Ms. Sinclair closely. She mentioned Mr. Sinclair's ex-wife - clearly there's bad blood between them!"

Teddy launched into an animated explanation of every interaction between Evelyn and Preston, his words tumbling over each other in his haste. By the time he finished, Nathan had grown impatient.

"Enough. Keep her safe." Nathan's voice was clipped. "And Teddy? Return soon."

The call ended abruptly. Nathan's fingers hovered over Evelyn's social media profile. Blank. Not blocked - restricted. The invisible barrier between them made his chest constrict painfully.

Meanwhile, Evelyn checked her watch. Still too early for the reunion. She decided to pick up gifts for her classmates.

At the intersection, she turned to Preston. "Mr. Sinclair, if you have other engagements, please don't let me keep you."

Preston's brow furrowed. "You're not returning to the estate?"

"I need to shop for tonight's gathering."

Understanding dawned on Preston's face. "Ah, I have a client meeting myself. Until next time." They exchanged polite farewells.

The moment Preston disappeared around the corner, Teddy materialized at Evelyn's side, unfurling an umbrella with dramatic flair. "Ms. Sinclair! We can't have the rain ruining your gorgeous hair. Where to next?"

Evelyn gave him a withering look and strode off without answering. She knew these streets intimately, her heels clicking purposefully toward the luxury mall.

Teddy practically vibrated with excitement - this was his chance to shine! He chattered nonstop about gift ideas, his enthusiasm gradually wearing down Evelyn's resistance. By the third boutique, she found herself reluctantly impressed.

The man should have been in sales, Evelyn mused. He'd make a fortune with that silver tongue.

Behind them, Marcus lumbered under an ever-growing mountain of shopping bags, his usual intimidating presence somewhat diminished by his role as pack mule. Teddy turned and snapped his fingers. "Pick up the pace, Marcus! They're just a few bags - no need to look like you're marching to your execution!"
###Chapter 453 Her New Love

Marcus's expression turned dangerously dark as he trailed behind them. His piercing glare at Teddy Winslow could have melted steel. If Teddy hadn't been walking so close to Evelyn Sinclair, Marcus would have already taught him a painful lesson.

Evelyn's phone kept buzzing incessantly with notifications. She glanced at the screen to see messages from Isabella Montgomery flooding in. [Why haven't you responded? Are you actually dating Preston Sinclair?!] Evelyn ignored the text, shocked to find over two hundred unread messages and alerts.

What in the world? Why is everyone suddenly obsessed with Preston? [Sebastian Hart: Are you really involved with Preston? Ready to become a stepmother? I only want your happiness, but perhaps you should reconsider Nathan Blackwood.] [Natalie Beaumont: Preston isn't a terrible choice, but don't take it too seriously! Older men can't compete with younger studs, right?] [Lucas Sterling: Are you abandoning your collection of admirers? The entire entertainment industry is at your feet - think carefully!] [Alexander Sterling: Money talks. What use are emotions?] [Donovan Sterling: Not only does rain increase microbial growth risks, but damp clothing provides ideal conditions for bacterial colonization. Your outfit's fabric appears particularly susceptible.] [Emily Whitaker: Wow Evelyn! You look absolutely breathtaking!] Evelyn frowned as she scrolled through the barrage of messages.

She couldn't believe the overreaction. It's just one photograph!

Coincidentally, Isabella called. Evelyn answered with practiced ease. "Evie! Do you actually have feelings for Preston Sinclair? Even if Nathan Blackwood isn't right for you, why not stay single?" Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

She arched an eyebrow and responded nonchalantly as she continued walking, "It's merely a photo! You're all making a mountain out of a molehill."

"What? So it's not true? Then why would you pose like that? I thought you were announcing your relationship just to provoke Nathan."

"There are countless ways to annoy Nathan - why would I sacrifice myself for that?" That was a valid point. Isabella nodded in agreement, visibly relaxing.

"Well, that's a relief. Everyone assumes you're dating Preston. Honestly, he's not a bad option - his qualifications rival Nathan's, except for the whole... existing child situation."

"Nothing of the sort exists, so stop this nonsense. I'll simply delete the photo to avoid further complications."

"Perfect! I'll spread the word so everyone shuts up about it!" Isabella added cheerfully, "But between us, you two look incredible together! Romantic movies couldn't create better chemistry! Preston's devastatingly handsome. He seems like decent husband material too."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Should I introduce him to you then?"

"Absolutely not! I could never handle a man like that."

Isabella lacked the confidence for such an endeavor. Even Evelyn with her formidable intellect had struggled with Nathan Blackwood. Isabella preferred the safety of arranged high-society marriages. "But why did you agree to travel with Nathan? His intentions are clearly less than honorable."

Evelyn explained, "Father wanted to attend and insisted I join. Besides, we have multi-billion dollar projects underway - no need for unnecessary tension." Isabella was rendered speechless.

She suddenly felt petty for focusing on romantic entanglements. How shallow! In the face of such wealth, everyone should reconcile and collaborate. Isabella realized she'd underestimated her best friend. Evelyn wouldn't fall for someone so easily. Every public appearance was a strategic business move.

She sighed. "Alright then. I see now the gap between us is vast. I need to work harder to reach your level!" Isabella consoled herself.

Evelyn replied, "Better late than never."
###Chapter 454 Scandalous Affair Exposed

Isabella Montgomery slammed the phone down without a word. What a terrible friend! Evelyn Sinclair immediately deleted the controversial post, watching as all those vicious comments vanished into digital oblivion. At last, she could breathe again.

She didn't need to explain herself to anyone. Isabella, with her notorious big mouth, would undoubtedly spread the "truth" far and wide. Yet despite this, rumors about Evelyn and Preston Sinclair's alleged romance spread uncontrollably, blazing through social media like wildfire. By dusk, tabloids screamed with headlines like "Evelyn's Secret Lover Revealed" and "The Billionaire's New Flame."

Evelyn's celebrity status was the envy of every socialite in Montecito. Anything bearing her name guaranteed viral attention. Currently abroad, she remained blissfully unaware of the storm brewing back home. By the time she learned of the scandal, it had already spiraled beyond containment.

While the entire nation speculated about her love life, Evelyn happily attended her high school reunion. Returning from the event, Isabella's call came through.

"You're trending again!" Isabella sent a screenshot. Every trending topic revolved around Evelyn's supposed new relationship. Evelyn's brow furrowed.

"I'll have Dominic Young remove those topics immediately."
"Too late, darling," Isabella replied, clearly enjoying the drama. "They're already gone."
"Who handled it?"
"Who else? Nathan Blackwood, of course! He issued orders to crush anyone daring to publish such nonsense."

Evelyn stepped inside and scrolled through the day's trending topics. Not a single trace remained of the scandal. She calmly pocketed her phone just as Theodore "Teddy" Winslow approached, looking utterly miserable.

"What's wrong with you?" Evelyn asked. Teddy appeared completely drained.
"Mr. Blackwood's condition has worsened. He can't even keep food down now. I'm terrified he might not recover."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Worsened? How?"
Teddy sighed heavily before meeting her gaze.

"Ms. Sinclair, have you seen what's happening in Montecito? Someone posted that photo of you and Mr. Sinclair online, twisting your professional relationship into something sordid. It's downright character assassination!"

"Clearly someone wants to sabotage our business partnership," Evelyn remarked.
Teddy huffed indignantly, his round face flushing. "When I saw it, I was furious—and it's not even my concern!"

Evelyn studied him curiously as Teddy continued fuming like an overgrown bullfrog.
"I already know about the rumors."
Teddy sighed again. "Then you must be furious. Those vultures speculated about your private life without restraint. Mr. Blackwood feared you'd be upset—that Sterling Corporation's stocks might plummet—so he immediately used his influence to suppress the stories."

"Mr. Blackwood is so thoughtful! A true gentleman," Teddy gushed before adding, "Would you check on him? Maybe bring some chicken soup?"
"Fine."
Teddy's eyes lit up, and he scurried away before she could change her mind.

If Teddy failed this mission, Nathan would undoubtedly toss him into the River Aurora without hesitation. Evelyn approached Nathan's suite and knocked calmly. No answer. She turned to leave when the door suddenly swung open.

Nathan stood there, his face alarmingly pale as he leaned heavily on his cane. His lips were bloodless. In his other hand, he held an IV bag, the tube snaking into his arm. Every movement seemed to cost him tremendous effort. Evelyn froze, momentarily stunned by his deteriorated state.
###Chapter 455 Pure Friendship ASG

Evelyn instinctively reached out to steady Nathan's IV drip.

The needle in his right hand was slipping, tiny crimson droplets forming at the puncture site. Nathan's complexion looked ghostly pale, his usually full lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line. Yet his eyes brightened noticeably when they landed on her.

"Evelyn..." His voice came out hoarse as he tried to sit up, only to collapse back against the pillows. She remained frozen in the doorway, watching his struggle to rehang the IV bag himself before finally stepping forward to assist.

Her gaze swept over him clinically. "Mr. Blackwood, how are you feeling?" Nathan's lips twitched into a weak smile. "Better now that you're here. You didn't catch a chill last night, did you?" Even his normally rich baritone sounded strained.

There was something heartbreakingly vulnerable in the way he looked at her. "No." Evelyn's pulse stuttered despite herself. She moved to the chair opposite his bed with deliberate nonchalance.

Theodore entered bearing a steaming bowl, his expression sympathetic. "Mr. Blackwood, you must regain your strength. Ms. Sinclair was quite moved when she learned what you did for her. She's been wanting to express her gratitude properly." He shot Evelyn a meaningful glance. "It's impossible not to admire such a remarkable man!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Theodore's blatant matchmaking. The earlier tension dissipated instantly. Theodore winked conspiratorially, clearly playing up the situation for the patient's benefit.

Pursing her lips, Evelyn met Nathan's expectant gaze. "I heard you had the trending topics removed. Thank you." Her words came out stiffer than intended.

Nathan's smile softened. "You're welcome." Theodore hastily passed the bowl to Evelyn and made a strategic exit.

Nathan eyed the soup, then raised his trembling, needle-pierced hand with obvious difficulty. Evelyn frowned. Despite his weakened state, his expression remained composed, though she detected a glimmer of hope in his eyes.

Seeing the typically formidable Nathan Blackwood reduced to such frailty stirred unexpected tenderness in her chest. He'd been injured because of her, after all. The least she could do was show basic courtesy.

She held out the bowl with the spoon, maintaining what little distance remained between them. This was already pushing her boundaries. Nathan calmly displayed his other hand - equally marred by IV punctures. "No strength," he admitted quietly, the admission clearly costing him pride.

Evelyn hesitated. Just as Nathan thought she might relent and feed him herself, she called toward the door, "Marcus!" The ensuing silence lasted just a beat too long. Nathan's jaw tightened visibly, his chest rising with a sharp inhale. He knew exactly what was coming.

Absolutely not. He'd rather collapse from hunger.

The next instant, Marcus materialized, his usual stoic expression in place. "Yes, Miss Sinclair?"

"Please assist Mr. Blackwood with his soup." Her tone brooked no argument.

Marcus's brows drew together fractionally, but he accepted the bowl without protest. Better him than Evelyn having to endure Nathan's proximity. "At once, Miss." His response rang with military precision.

Before Marcus could take the vacated seat, Nathan snatched the bowl with sudden vigor, downing its contents in several large gulps. His glare could have frozen lava. "Out!" he barked at Marcus, the command laced with barely restrained fury.
###Chapter 456 Happy to Help

Marcus glanced at Evelyn, who arched an eyebrow and gave a subtle nod. Without hesitation, Marcus stepped out, leaving Evelyn and Nathan alone in the sterile hospital room.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Since you've finished your meal, I'll take the tray. Get some rest." She rose gracefully, preparing to make her exit.

She missed the way Nathan's piercing gaze darkened with a fleeting look of wounded pride before his expression smoothed into its usual impassive mask.

Nathan's voice emerged rough with emotion, stopping her mid-step. "Evelyn."

She turned, meeting his stormy eyes. "Yes?"

"Why did you post that photo?" His jaw clenched, lips pressed into a thin line. The intensity in his obsidian eyes betrayed the calmness of his question.

Evelyn tossed her hair over one shoulder, her smile turning deliberately provocative. "Because he's my new lover." The lie rolled easily off her tongue, meant to sever whatever lingering connection remained between them.

Nathan paled visibly. Raw pain flashed across his features before he schooled them again. His hands fisted at his sides, knuckles whitening with the effort to maintain control.

The weight of her words crushed him. Each breath became a struggle against the invisible vise tightening around his chest. The corners of his eyes reddened, betraying the devastation he fought to conceal.

He had no right to protest. He'd been the one to push her away. The bitter taste of regret coated his tongue as he watched her prepare to leave again.

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. Evelyn spoke lightly, as if discussing the weather. "We both knew this day would come. New people, new lives. You should prepare yourself, Mr. Blackwood."

With that final dismissal, she walked out without looking back. The door clicked shut behind her with finality.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, only to freeze when she spotted Preston Sinclair leaning casually against the opposite wall. His presence suggested he'd been waiting - and listening - for some time.

Guilt twisted her stomach. Their eyes met, and the air between them shifted with unspoken understanding.

Preston broke the silence first, his voice warm yet measured. "I came to say goodbye to Nathan before my early departure. When I heard voices, I thought I'd wait out here."

Evelyn bit her lip, scrambling for an explanation. "I'm so sorry about that photo. What I said in there was just...a convenient excuse." Her words tumbled out in a rush.

Preston's lips quirked in an unexpected smile. "It's quite alright. I'm happy to help." His tone held none of his usual aristocratic chill.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What?"

Meeting her gaze squarely, Preston radiated quiet confidence. The combination of his noble bearing and unexpected kindness created an intoxicating aura. "If playing the role of your lover helps you avoid unwanted complications, consider me at your service." His eyes twinkled with quiet amusement. "After all, you did save Oliver's life."

Relief washed over Evelyn as understanding dawned. He'd seen right through her ploy. The tension in her shoulders eased as she chuckled. "Thank you for not being angry."

"Angry?" Preston's expression turned playfully serious. "On the contrary. Should you require an acting partner again, I'd be honored to reprise my role."
###Chapter 457 Just a Fling

Evelyn lowered her lashes. No. I can't involve you in my mess just because I'm being selfish.

She knew perfectly well that Nathan wouldn't believe a mere photograph.

His earlier anger had been nothing more than a momentary lapse in judgment.

Evelyn forced a smile and withdrew her gaze. "Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood."

"Goodnight," he replied stiffly.

She retreated to her room, the weight of unspoken words pressing against her ribs.

After a long shower, she changed into silk pajamas just as her father summoned her for a family video call.

William Sterling had business matters to discuss with her.

By the time they finished, the furrow between his brows hadn't eased.

Then Lucas popped onto the screen, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Tell me you're not actually dating Preston Sinclair!"

Evelyn groaned. Of course Lucas, the family's biggest gossip, would latch onto that rumor.

"Absolutely not," she deadpanned.

Lucas exhaled dramatically. "Thank God. Have your fun, but don't get attached. If you do, I'm staging an intervention."

William surprised her by nodding. "He's right."

It was rare for her father to agree with Lucas. Their protectiveness stemmed from the way she'd diminished herself during her marriage to Nathan. To them, no man would ever be worthy.

Donovan ended the call abruptly.

William cleared his throat. "Ignore them, sweetheart. Date whoever you want—rich, poor, I don't care."

He winked. "It's not like we can't afford heartbreak, right?"

Evelyn burst out laughing. "True, but I'd rather focus on making money. With enough cash, I can have any man I want!"

William nodded sagely. "That's my girl."

Still chuckling, she returned to bed.

The next morning, Nathan's meticulous planning became evident.

Since Preston wasn't leaving until afternoon, they had half a day to explore Venice together.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the piazza, romance clung to the air like perfume.

Time seemed suspended in the 19th century—no cars, just gondolas gliding through turquoise canals.

William and Preston wandered ahead, engrossed in conversation.

Meanwhile, Oliver Sinclair clung to Evelyn's hand like an excited puppy. This trip with his "favorite muse" was a memory he'd cherish forever.

Theodore nudged Nathan, who was grinding his teeth at the sight of Evelyn and Oliver's linked fingers.

Nathan forced a smile, though internally he ranked Oliver just as irritating as Preston.

Spotting a vendor, Theodore darted off and returned with a cloud of pink cotton candy.

He thrust it at Nathan.

"I don't eat sugar," Nathan hissed.

Theodore's smile turned pained. "It's for Ms. Sinclair, sir. Thought you might want to... you know."

Give it to her yourself hung unspoken in the air.

Nathan snatched it with a scowl.

Theodore wisely refrained from comment and called out, "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood saw this and thought you'd like it!"

He added hastily, "He knows ladies watch their sugar intake, but he hopes you'll stay as sweet as this candy every day."

Evelyn turned, one eyebrow arched. Nathan stood frozen, cotton candy held out like a peace offering—or a surrender.
###Chapter 458 You Don't Stand a Chance

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow beamed brightly, spinning his web of lies effortlessly. Evelyn Sinclair glanced at Nathan Blackwood, who lifted the cotton candy in his hand. His gaze held a warmth that seemed to reach her soul.

"Do you... like it?" Nathan asked softly. Evelyn blinked in surprise. Cotton candy? Since when did the sophisticated Nathan Blackwood indulge in such childish treats? Before she could respond, little Oliver Sinclair came bounding over excitedly.

"I want it! I want it!" The crowd froze as the boy snatched the cotton candy and took an enthusiastic bite. "Oww! It's too sweet!" Oliver clutched his cheek dramatically before burying his face in Evelyn's skirt. "Muse, my tooth hurts!"

Nathan forced himself to maintain composure, though irritation flickered in his eyes. "You should be more careful," he said through gritted teeth. He couldn't afford to alienate anyone close to Evelyn now.

Evelyn smoothed Oliver's golden curls knowingly. She saw through Nathan's act but chose not to call him out. "Then don't eat it, sweetheart." Oliver nodded vigorously. "Only babies eat candy anyway. Meanie Nathan is being silly."

"Muse, I'll make you cotton candy from real gold! Then you can keep it forever!" Oliver declared proudly. At least he wasn't as cheap as that horrible Nathan Blackwood. Evelyn nearly choked. "No, darling, I don't need that." Raising this little prince would bankrupt an ordinary person.

As Evelyn turned to fetch Oliver's water bottle, Nathan studied the boy's face with amusement. "You like Evelyn very much, don't you?" "Yeah! So what?" Oliver crossed his arms like a miniature adult. Nathan's smile turned sly. "Congratulations then. When your father marries her, you'll officially be her son."

Oliver's face contorted in horror. "WHAT?!" His tiny hands balled into fists. Nathan raised an eyebrow. "You didn't know? Preston's courting her." Just then, Preston Sinclair approached holding another colorful cloud of spun sugar.

Evelyn turned and stared in bewilderment. Why was everyone obsessed with cotton candy today? Preston smiled warmly at her while giving his son a pointed look. "Ms. Sinclair, I saw Oliver ruined Mr. Blackwood's gift. Please accept this as replacement." He offered the treat to Evelyn.

Nathan's eyes narrowed slightly but he remained composed. Meanwhile, Oliver snatched the cotton candy from his father's hand, glaring daggers. "Daddy! Muse doesn't like cotton candy!" His cheeks flushed crimson with outrage.

The clever boy put two and two together. Was Nathan telling the truth? Was Daddy really trying to steal his Muse? Unacceptable! She belonged to him alone! Not even Daddy could have her!

With sudden inspiration, Oliver thrust the candy at Nathan. "Here. You take it." Better the enemy he knew than the one he didn't. At least he was certain Evelyn didn't care for Nathan.

Preston's smile never wavered, though confusion flickered in his eyes as he met his son's furious gaze. Oliver pouted. First he had to compete with Nathan, and now his own father? When he inherited the Sinclair empire, he'd claim his Muse properly. Why couldn't Daddy understand she was his?
###Chapter 459 There's a Party

Oliver Sinclair thought fiercely, No one can take my Muse away, not even Father!

When Nathan Blackwood saw the boy's protective stance, a warm, indulgent smile curved his lips.

Strangely, Nathan found Oliver less irritating than usual.

"Mr. Sinclair, don't be upset. Your son takes after you," Teddy Winslow remarked dryly.

Before Preston Sinclair could respond, Oliver grabbed Evelyn Sinclair's hand and stormed off in a huff.

Evelyn let the boy drag her to a quiet corner of the hotel lobby, where he finally stopped, cheeks flushed.

"Muse," Oliver panted, blinking his sapphire-blue eyes innocently, "Out of the three of us, who treats you the best?"

Evelyn blinked. Three? Oliver, Nathan, and Preston? Men?

She bit back a laugh at the absurdity but humored him. "Of course it's you, sweetheart."

Oliver beamed, puffing his chest proudly. "I knew it! Those two are old, grumpy, and boring. They can't compete with me!"

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "Absolutely right."

Oliver shyly took her hand. "Then... wait for me to grow up. We'll be together forever!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh, pinching his soft cheek. "Alright, I'll wait."

Oliver threw his arms around her, nuzzling into her palm like an affectionate kitten.

Later, Evelyn led him back to the group as if nothing had happened.

William Sterling was thoroughly enjoying the trip. After Preston left that afternoon, Evelyn suggested changing destinations.

"Costa Azul," she declared.

No one objected. They departed the same day.

Costa Azul was perfect for surfing, but Evelyn's mood soured whenever Nathan and Teddy were nearby.

The next evening, a cool breeze swept through the resort.

Nathan owned the hotel they were staying at, so it had been cleared out before their arrival. William went to mingle with locals while the others stayed behind.

Evelyn stepped out of the elevator in a soft apricot sundress, radiant under the golden lobby lights.

Nathan was in the lounge, reviewing quarterly reports with the manager. His gaze snapped up when he saw her.

"Going out?" he asked.

Evelyn nodded. "There's a party."

She walked toward the entrance without another word. Nathan's lips thinned.

Before he could ask where, a sleek Porsche pulled up.

The driver stepped out—Preston Sinclair.

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. He wheeled himself forward just as Preston opened the car door for Evelyn like a perfect gentleman.

Preston paused when he noticed Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood."

Though seated, Nathan's presence was no less commanding. His voice was ice. "Mr. Sinclair. What a... coincidence."

First he leaves, now he's back? Nathan thought irritably. Preston had always been a wild card, capable of ruining his mood instantly.

A sudden gust of wind tore Evelyn's silk scarf from her shoulders, sending it fluttering to Nathan's feet.

He bent to retrieve it—just as Preston grabbed the other end.

Their eyes met, a silent battle of wills.

Neither let go.

The air between them crackled with tension.
###Chapter 460 Departure With Him

Evelyn Sinclair turned her head, her expression unreadable as she approached. With deliberate movements, she snatched the silk scarf from the hands of the two men.

The tension in the air was suffocating. She shattered it with a single word. "Let's go."

Evelyn slid into the car without hesitation. Preston Sinclair remained standing, his posture rigid as he shot Nathan Blackwood a frosty glare. "Goodbye, Mr. Blackwood."

His gaze lingered on Nathan, deliberately ignoring the icy aura radiating from him. Without another word, Preston circled the car, took the driver's seat, and started the engine.

Nathan sat motionless, his sharp eyes narrowing dangerously.

How could he remain indifferent when someone dared to take what was his?

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow descended the steps and spotted Nathan sitting alone at the grand entrance. He rushed over immediately.

"Mr. Blackwood, have you seen Ms. Sinclair?"

Nathan remained silent.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke, his voice devoid of emotion. "Find out what event is happening in the social circle tonight."

The party Preston and Evelyn attended together wouldn’t be some obscure gathering. There was no way Nathan wouldn’t uncover it.

Teddy hesitated for a moment before pulling out his phone to check the schedule Harrison had sent him.

A few seconds later, Teddy spoke hesitantly. "It's Young Master Whitmore's birthday celebration. You declined his invitation earlier."

Nathan frowned.

Teddy continued cautiously. "I heard Young Master Whitmore invited numerous high-profile guests. It's a lavish affair. Would you like to attend?"

He wasn’t hopeful—Nathan never wasted time on trivial events.

To his surprise, Nathan paused, then nodded. "Arrange it."

Teddy blinked in shock but didn’t dare delay. He immediately signaled the driver.

During the ride, Teddy wanted to ask about Evelyn’s whereabouts but thought better of it.

Soon, they arrived at an extravagant beachfront villa. The sounds of laughter and music spilled out from within.

When Tristan Whitmore learned of Nathan’s arrival, he dashed to the entrance in excitement.

The moment he saw Nathan, Tristan’s face lit up, and he pulled him into a bear hug. "Brother! I knew you’d come! You’re still recovering, yet you made time for my birthday. I must mean the world to you!"

His voice trembled with emotion, his eyes glistening.

Nathan’s expression remained impassive. Teddy quickly intervened, prying Tristan off.

"Young Master Whitmore, there are plenty of guests here. No need for such enthusiasm among close friends."

Tristan, still moved, nodded vigorously.

Nathan’s gaze swept the room. "Is Evelyn here?"

Tristan froze.

His expression turned complicated. "You didn’t come for my birthday?"

The realization hit him like a wave, and his excitement deflated.

"Evelyn?"

A familiar voice cut through the air.

Nathan turned to see Evelyn standing behind him, her eyes wide with surprise.

Tristan whirled around. "When did you get here?"

His wounded expression made him look like a jilted lover.

As other guests began closing in to greet Nathan, Teddy swiftly maneuvered him inside.

"Young Master Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood came specifically for you! He cleared his schedule just to celebrate your birthday. Running into Ms. Sinclair was pure coincidence—no, fate!"

Teddy glanced meaningfully at Evelyn. "Definitely fate."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and stepped forward. "Enough. The whole room can hear you."

Nathan’s mood visibly improved at the sight of Evelyn standing alone. The coldness in his eyes melted into something softer, his gaze lingering on her.

"Mm. Fate."

Tristan, still pouting, sidled up to Nathan.

"So you really came for me?"
###Chapter 461 Plastic Brotherhood

Nathan didn't even glance at Tristan. His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn with a knowing smile. "What a pleasant surprise, Evelyn."

He gestured to his wheelchair. "Why don't you push me? I'll introduce you to Chairman Ashford."

Evelyn hesitated for only a moment before nodding. The Ashford Group was notoriously selective in their partnerships. Reginald Ashford only worked with close associates, and his influence in Montecito was unparalleled.

Though less known internationally, his control over two major diamond mines made him a force in the industry. A partnership with Ashford could propel Sterling Corporation forward.

Nathan's lips curved.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow stepped back with an amused sigh. "Mr. Blackwood always has his methods."

Tristan scoffed, his expression darkening. "You're not even here for me." He turned sharply and stormed off.

Teddy shook his head. "Plastic friendships." When Evelyn was involved, everyone else became an afterthought.

Evelyn guided Nathan through the crowd, exchanging polite greetings. Though no one openly stared, curious glances followed them. Nathan scanned the room and spotted Preston Sinclair surrounded by admirers—no chance of escape.

When Preston noticed Nathan, surprise flickered across his face before vanishing.

Nathan smirked, cold amusement in his eyes. Blackwood Enterprises had maintained ties with Ashford Group for years.

Reginald Ashford, a man in his fifties with silver-streaked hair, brightened at the sight of Nathan. "Nathan! It's been too long." He clapped Nathan's shoulder. "I wanted to visit after hearing about your accident, but business kept me tied up."

Evelyn nearly laughed at the older man calling Nathan "brother."

Nathan waved it off. "Nothing serious. Don't trouble yourself."

Reginald's attention shifted to Evelyn. "Ah, Evelyn Sterling. CEO of Sterling Corporation and William Sterling's treasured daughter."

Evelyn offered a polite handshake. "Chairman Ashford."

Reginald exhaled dramatically. "So you're the ex-wife? I've heard stories." His grin was too knowing. "Didn't expect you two to remain so... close after the divorce."

Evelyn's expression remained neutral, but irritation simmered beneath.

Nathan's jaw tightened slightly before he chuckled. "We're on good terms."

"Smart," Reginald said, nodding sagely. "This world is small. Better to keep allies than enemies." His tone carried an unspoken implication that made Evelyn's interest in collaboration wane.

Then Reginald beckoned someone over. "Victoria! Come here."

A young woman in an extravagant gown hurried forward. Her delicate features contrasted sharply with her opulent attire—clearly wealthy, but not tastelessly so.

"This is Nathan Blackwood," Reginald announced proudly. "The man I've told you about. Brilliant, accomplished. Didn't you always want to meet him?"

He shot his youngest daughter a pointed look.

Victoria Ashford lowered her lashes, cheeks pink, and dipped into a slight bow. "Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. Now she understood Reginald's earlier comments.

He was auditioning his daughter for the role of the next Mrs. Blackwood.

Nathan acknowledged her with a detached nod, his attention already elsewhere.
###Chapter 462 Hidden Agendas

Reginald Ashford flashed a practiced smile. "Nathan, allow me to introduce my youngest daughter Victoria. She's been raised in Europe, so she's rather reserved—this being her first society event. Do be gentle with her." Nathan Blackwood responded with a polite but distant nod.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Victoria Ashford carefully. The girl's mannerisms betrayed none of the sophistication expected from European upbringing. Noticing Evelyn's scrutiny, Victoria offered a nervous smile before lowering her gaze.

Recognizing the father-daughter duo's intentions, Evelyn saw no reason to linger. She gave Nathan's shoulder an affectionate pat. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll leave you to your conversation. I should find some refreshments." Before Nathan could protest, Reginald boomed with laughter. "Enjoy yourself, Ms. Sinclair."

With a serene smile, Evelyn turned away.

The exchange hadn't gone unnoticed. To onlookers, Evelyn's retreating figure appeared heartbreakingly solitary, stirring whispers of sympathy. Selecting a slice of cake, she settled into a quiet corner—only for Preston Sinclair to join her moments later.

Loosening his tie with a weary sigh, Preston appeared genuinely contrite. "My apologies for abandoning you after bringing you here."

Evelyn waved off his concern gracefully. "Mr. Sinclair, you've just returned to Montecito. Naturally, everyone wants a piece of your time. It's completely understandable."

Having consumed considerable wine earlier, Preston now sipped sparkling water. "Nathan's here?" His gaze drifted toward the other man and froze. "Ashford Group?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, impressed. "You recognize Reginald Ashford after just returning?"

Preston chuckled darkly. "I studied Western Montecito's investment landscape. Chairman Ashford hoards his mining assets like a dragon guarding treasure—hardly progressive." Evelyn nodded in agreement.

"I heard he has a daughter named Penelope?" Evelyn shook her head. "The one with him is Victoria. Claims she was raised abroad." Preston crossed his legs with a derisive snort.

His commanding presence seemed to shrink the space around them. "Who's he fooling? That's clearly his bastard child. Only dared acknowledge her after his wife's passing."

Evelyn's admiration grew. Who knew Wall Street's golden boy kept such scandalous tabs? Rivaling even Lucas's gossip prowess. This explained Victoria's awkwardness among society's elite.

Preston cleared his throat. "Business intelligence requires knowing players'... vulnerabilities." Their eyes met—his gleaming with shared amusement, hers sparkling with newfound respect. The moment stretched, their proximity appearing intimate to observers.

Was the online rumor mill correct about Preston being Evelyn's new romantic interest? The scene burned in Nathan's vision from across the room. Reginald had strategically left Victoria to charm Nathan alone. The girl trembled with nervous excitement—twenty years as an unacknowledged heir finally over.

The day Reginald's wife died became Victoria's rebirth. No longer would she endure servants' sneers or live in Penelope's shadow at Aspen Lodge. Marrying Nathan Blackwood would erase the stain of illegitimacy forever.

Reginald had been brutally clear: Victoria only gained recognition because the Blackwoods sought marriage alliances among elite families. With Penelope already wed, Victoria became suddenly useful. Though resentful, Victoria recognized this as her sole opportunity.

Stealing a glance at Nathan, she marveled at the man who seemed carved from marble—the untouchable tycoon from magazine spreads now within reach. Biting her lip, Victoria gathered her courage and stepped forward.
###Chapter 463 Give Up

Victoria Ashford smiled sweetly. "Mr. Blackwood, it's such a pleasure to finally meet you." She had recognized the stunning woman from earlier—the one who outshone even Hollywood starlets—as Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife. Evelyn Sinclair was even more breathtaking in person than in photographs.

Though tabloids buzzed with rumors about Nathan and Victoria's supposed entanglement, Evelyn seemed unfazed. After all, they were divorced now. While Victoria couldn't compete with Evelyn's sterling family background, she believed her willingness to submit would win Nathan over. Powerful women, in her experience, intimidated most men.

Nathan didn't acknowledge Victoria's greeting. His icy gaze remained fixed across the room where Evelyn stood conversing with Preston Sinclair.

Biting her lip, Victoria stepped closer to his wheelchair. "Shall I take you somewhere more comfortable to rest?" Her hand hovered inches from the armrest.

"Don't touch me." Nathan's voice could have frozen the champagne fountain.

No one would erase Evelyn's presence from where she'd last touched his chair—especially not this opportunistic socialite. Victoria's cheeks burned with humiliation.

"My apologies." She withdrew her hand but didn't retreat. "Perhaps I could fetch you some refreshments instead?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Unnecessary." He tolerated Reginald Ashford as a business associate, but had no patience for the man's scheming daughter—particularly after her earlier disrespect toward Evelyn.

His phone vibrated with an incoming call from the Blackwood patriarch. Nathan's glacial stare sent Victoria scrambling backward several paces.

"Grandfather." Nathan's greeting held no warmth.

"Have you made any progress with Evelyn Sinclair?" The old man's raspy voice crackled with impatience.

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "What concern is that of yours?"

A derisive snort came through the line. "You've neglected corporate affairs long enough chasing that woman. If this fools errand continues yielding nothing, cut your losses. The Sterling family isn't our only option for an alliance. Must we become the laughingstock of Montecito?"

Frost crystallized in Nathan's voice. "I won't abandon her." He'd burn his entire fortune to ashes before relinquishing Evelyn.

"Have you lost all sense?" The old man's temper flared. "How much longer will you humiliate yourself?"

"Is there anything else?" Nathan's tone could have shattered glass.

"Mark my words—I won't let Ferguson Corporation crumble over some woman! I've already begun vetting suitable matches. The Ashford Group chairman reached out this morning—his daughter was educated abroad and comes from respectable stock. I'll arrange—"

"Nathan wants no one but Evelyn!" The declaration sliced through his grandfather's tirade.

"You stubborn fool! That Sinclair witch has—"

Nathan ended the call with a decisive click, his stormy gaze finding Evelyn across the crowded ballroom. Let the old man scheme all he wanted. No power on earth could sever the bond between him and Evelyn—not even the formidable William Sterling himself.
###Chapter 464 Inordinate Ambition

Old Master Blackwood's voice crackled through the phone. "Stop wasting your time on Evelyn Sinclair."

His words carried the weight of finality. "She's constantly embroiled in scandals with male celebrities, and now this affair with Preston Sinclair."

"What respectable family would accept a woman with more scandals than you? If she marries into our family, how could we ever command respect?" Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze shifted to Victoria Ashford, who stood meekly nearby.

The icy glare he gave her felt like a dagger to the heart. Victoria fidgeted nervously, unsure what she'd done wrong.

She tried to meet his eyes, but he'd already looked away. Was that disappointment or anger she'd glimpsed? Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression darkening. "If you want a marriage alliance, marry her yourself."

"Evelyn is my only choice." With that, Nathan ended the call, radiating an aura so cold it could freeze hell itself.

The crowd of well-wishers who'd been waiting to greet him suddenly found other places to be. Seeing the call had ended, Victoria Ashford timidly approached again.

She studied his face carefully before speaking in a soft, trembling voice. "Mr. Blackwood, would you like a drink?"

Nathan turned his head slightly, his voice dripping with frost. "Go tell Reginald Ashford not to pin his hopes on me."

Victoria blinked rapidly, confusion written across her delicate features. "I-I don't understand what you mean."

Nathan lifted his chin, locking eyes with her. The glacial contempt in his gaze made Victoria physically recoil. "Inordinate ambition." That was all he said before turning away, having seen straight through Victoria Ashford's transparent scheming.

The verbal slap stung worse than any physical blow. Her cheeks burned with humiliation, yet there was nowhere to hide. To Victoria, Nathan represented everything she coveted. Tears welled up instantly as she turned and fled the scene.

Onlookers whispered among themselves. Initially, they'd pitied Evelyn, but now their sympathy shifted to the "poor innocent girl."

Evelyn remained blissfully unaware of Nathan's movements. She'd been chatting with Preston Sinclair before circulating among other guests. The event was filled with familiar faces, making socializing effortless.

After several glasses of wine, Evelyn felt pleasantly warm and excused herself for some air. She smiled at Preston. "I'll be right back - just need to freshen up." Preston nodded gallantly and pointed down the grand hallway.

"Restrooms are at the far end."

"Thanks." Evelyn's heels clicked rhythmically against the marble floors. As she rounded a corner, the sound of muffled sobs reached her ears.

"What are you crying about?" A shrill female voice cut through the air, laced with cruel amusement. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't look at you twice even if you were the last woman on earth. You're utterly pathetic!"

The speaker was none other than Victoria's half-sister, Penelope Ashford. If Penelope hadn't already married into the Montgomery family, this illegitimate sister wouldn't have stood a chance with Nathan.

Though Penelope berated Victoria mercilessly, her tone betrayed secret delight that Nathan showed Victoria no interest. Evelyn paused, frowning at the unpleasant scene.

Seeing no alternative route, Evelyn continued walking openly - she had nothing to hide. She found two strikingly similar women engaged in what appeared to be a regular occurrence.

Evelyn waited politely for them to notice her and leave, but they remained oblivious. Victoria bit her quivering lip, tears streaming down her face.

Penelope crossed her arms before suddenly pinching Victoria's waist viciously. Victoria didn't even flinch, accustomed to such treatment. She made no move to defend herself.

Still unaware of Evelyn's presence, the sisters continued their twisted dynamic. Evelyn watched helplessly - she hadn't meant to intrude.

"I'll try harder," Victoria whimpered.

Penelope sneered. "A gutter rat like you could wear the crown jewels and still look common. No wonder Nathan Blackwood can't stand the sight of you."

Her voice dripped with venom. "A homewrecker's bastard like you doesn't deserve daylight, let alone the Ashford name."
###Chapter 465 Steal His Heart

Victoria Ashford lowered her gaze, her cheeks burning crimson. M-Mr. Blackwood is in love with Ms. Sinclair. I can't compete.

How could Victoria ever measure up to Evelyn Sinclair? She was nothing but a speck of dirt compared to Evelyn's radiant brilliance. Penelope Ashford let out a cruel laugh.

Can't help it? Didn't your whore of a mother teach you any tricks before she died? If he won't love you willingly, then steal his affection! Penelope shoved Victoria violently against the wall.

The dull thud of Victoria's head hitting the marble echoed through the hallway. What a pathetic sight. Evelyn observed the scene with fleeting pity before hardening her heart.

Not my problem, she thought. A shrill scream pierced the air moments later.

My dress! Penelope's eyes glittered with malice as she grabbed a janitor's bucket filled with filthy mop water and dumped it over Victoria's head. The cruel satisfaction on Penelope's face was unmistakable.

Victoria stood trembling, her designer gown ruined, dirty water dripping from her hair. She hugged herself against the wall, her quiet sobs making her appear even more pitiful.

How can I face anyone like this? Tristan Whitmore's birthday gala was attended by New York's elite - socialites and heirs to fortunes.

Appearing in this wretched state would make her the laughingstock of high society forever. Penelope's high-pitched cackle cut through the air like broken glass.

Why don't you go beg Nathan Blackwood for help? Isn't this your golden opportunity? Penelope had her trapped like a cornered animal.

Evelyn hesitated, torn between walking away and intervening, when she spotted Nathan across the ballroom. He was deep in conversation with Tristan, looking effortlessly handsome in his tuxedo.

Fine. I'll throw the poor girl a lifeline. Evelyn caught Nathan's attention with a wave. "Nathan Blackwood, someone needs you over here." The moment Nathan saw Evelyn, Tristan ceased to exist.

He immediately turned his wheelchair toward her. Tristan rolled his eyes dramatically. "Again? Really?" He followed behind, pushing Nathan's chair out of curiosity.

What could Evelyn possibly want with Nathan? When Evelyn spoke, the Ashford sisters froze mid-argument. She made no effort to hide her presence as she retreated down the corridor. Nathan's expression softened instantly.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn shook her head and gestured vaguely down the hall. "Not me. That person does." With that, she strode away in her stilettos. She'd done her good deed for the day.

Both men watched Evelyn's retreating figure in confusion. Nathan shot Tristan a look, signaling him to investigate. "What the hell's going on back there?" Tristan was equally curious.

They rounded the corner to find a drenched, shivering woman curled into a ball on the floor.

Her designer dress was ruined, her makeup streaked with tears. She looked up at them with swollen, pleading eyes - a drowned rat of a socialite.

The empty bathroom hallway offered no witnesses. Such a scene at Tristan's prestigious event was unacceptable. Tristan gaped before turning to Nathan. "Blackwood, Evelyn just left from here. You don't think she...?"

Nathan's face darkened with anger.

He recognized Victoria Ashford immediately, though he couldn't care less about her predicament. What infuriated him was Evelyn directing him to this pathetic scene.

What does any of this have to do with me? Neither man moved to help. Tristan was married - no reason to get involved with a soaking wet woman.

Nathan simply couldn't be bothered. The silence stretched for an excruciating minute. Victoria's tear-filled eyes locked onto Nathan's. "Please...help me..."
###Chapter 466 Strangers at the Gala

Victoria Ashford stood trembling in her soaked dress, her pitiful appearance almost unbearable to witness.

The air grew heavy with silence. Tristan Whitmore exhaled in relief. At least Nathan's anger wasn't directed at me.

Nathan Blackwood's gaze was icy, his attention deliberately avoiding the drenched woman. His lips pressed into a thin, tense line.

Though his expression remained cold, a trace of sorrow flickered in his eyes.

His thoughts were clearly elsewhere - with a certain someone who wasn't present. The grand ballroom buzzed with laughter, oblivious to the unfolding drama. Tristan discreetly touched Nathan's shoulder, uncertain how to handle the situation.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. Tristan cleared his throat. "Preston, perhaps you should..."

Victoria's sobs grew louder as she stared pleadingly at Nathan.

Nathan's voice cut through the air like winter frost. "This is your event. Handle it yourself."

Tristan froze. "But she was just with you—"

A warning glare from Nathan silenced him. "We're strangers." With that, Nathan wheeled himself away without another glance, leaving them behind.

Tristan stood rooted to the spot, momentarily at a loss. Victoria's cries intensified. "Could you... lend me a jacket? I need to dry off."

"Right. There's a private room upstairs you can use." Tristan scanned the room unsuccessfully for staff before reluctantly removing his suit jacket. He stayed at a safe distance as he tossed it toward her, wary of getting entangled with this clearly manipulative woman.

Across the room, Evelyn Sinclair leaned close to Preston Sinclair, discussing their upcoming project in hushed tones.

Preston clinked his glass gently against hers. "Mr. Blackwood is heading this way," he murmured.

Evelyn glanced up to see Nathan approaching alone in his wheelchair. Victoria was conspicuously absent - apparently abandoned with Tristan. What a wasted opportunity.

Nathan's stormy expression darkened further when he noticed Preston beside Evelyn.

Tristan hurried after Nathan, taking control of the wheelchair. He nodded politely at Preston. "Mr. Sinclair, what a pleasant surprise! I'd appreciate your thoughts on something. Shall we talk over there?" He gestured toward the terrace.

As the host, Tristan couldn't be refused. After a brief hesitation, Preston acquiesced.

Evelyn swirled her grape juice absently, watching the exchange. She turned to Nathan with a polite smile. "Mr. Blackwood, has the entertainment concluded already?" Her tone was light, almost teasing.

Nathan's fingers tightened on the wheelchair armrests. He struggled to contain the tempest within. "Evelyn, was this your doing?"

She blinked innocently. "My doing what?"

"Out of all possible people, why send me over there?" Nathan's voice turned sharp, though part of him dreaded the answer he might receive.

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile as she lowered her gaze. "I assumed you and Chairman Ashford were acquainted. Naturally, you wouldn't ignore his daughter." Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Besides, I heard her mention you earlier. None of this would have happened without your involvement."

Though she left the implication unspoken, Nathan had heard enough. "I don't know her!" he ground out, emphasizing each word.

His eyes burned into Evelyn's, red-rimmed with suppressed emotion. A bitter laugh escaped him. "Evelyn, you truly have a gift for torture."
###Chapter 467 The Beginning of Something New

Evelyn Sinclair's words caught in her throat as she noticed Victoria Ashford slipping away in her peripheral vision.

The sight of Victoria scurrying upstairs with Nathan Blackwood's suit jacket draped over her shoulders was almost comical in its desperation.

No one else seemed to notice the pathetic display.

Evelyn turned her attention back to Nathan, her expression carefully composed. His dark eyes were unreadable pools of ink.

A dull ache bloomed in her chest, but she inhaled deeply. When the pain subsided, she spoke in a measured tone. "Nathan Blackwood, I don't want to torment you."

Her voice was feather-light yet firm. "I want us both to find peace. During this time apart, I've reflected deeply on our relationship."

She met his gaze steadily. "Thank you for everything you've done for me. But I'm sorry - I can't imagine us together again."

Nathan's face turned to stone.

His entire body tensed, fingers whitening as they gripped the wheelchair armrests. Evelyn felt a fleeting pang of sympathy, but it vanished as quickly as it came.

This clean break was necessary.

Better to sever ties completely than remain entangled in this painful dance. Their time together had given her clarity - she didn't miss Nathan, but rather pitied her younger self for accepting less than she deserved.

Seeing the raw emotion in Nathan's eyes made her chest constrict.

Evelyn lowered her lashes briefly before looking up with a practiced smile. "It's getting late. Thank you for tonight - I'll head back now."

She rose gracefully to leave.

"Evelyn." His voice stopped her, rough with emotion. "You're really rejecting me? I won't accept that."

His gaze burned into hers. "No matter what you say, I'm not giving up. Whether you want me to or not, I'll keep waiting."

Evelyn departed without farewells.

Nathan watched her go, his body rigid. Only when she disappeared did he realize he'd been holding his breath. Cold sweat dampened his shirt as he slumped back in the wheelchair.

Evelyn informed Preston Sinclair of her early departure.

The night air felt refreshing as she began walking toward The Grandeur hotel. The crisp breeze helped clear her turbulent thoughts.

Footsteps approached from behind.

"Mr. Sinclair?" Evelyn turned in surprise. "The event isn't over yet, is it?"

Preston smiled, not even winded from his quick pursuit. His composure remained impeccable. "It's no trouble. I couldn't let a lady walk alone at night."

"A lady?" The old-fashioned term made her lips twitch. "Well then, thank you for the escort, Mr. Sinclair."

"The pleasure is mine."

His eyes sparkled with genuine warmth as they fell into step together. "Mr. Blackwood certainly planned a memorable trip. Though I suspect this marks its conclusion?"

Evelyn considered his question seriously before laughing. "The real pity would be missing profitable opportunities."

"Quite right." Preston nodded approvingly. Business always came first for them.

They walked through the neon-lit streets, the evening breeze playing with Evelyn's hair.

Preston watched her profile soften in the ambient light. "Ms. Sinclair," he ventured, "have you considered... starting anew? With me?"
###Chapter 468 Business Before Pleasure

Preston Sinclair's words hung heavy in the air between them.

The silence stretched, punctuated only by the rustling of leaves in the gentle evening breeze. Evelyn Sinclair stopped walking and turned to face him.

Her piercing gaze held a glacial edge.

When no response came after several heartbeats, Preston smoothly diffused the tension.

A low chuckle escaped his lips. "You heard me correctly, Evelyn. And I won't retract what I said."

His eyes burned with undisguised intensity. The casual tone he adopted couldn't mask the gravity of his declaration. "When I agreed to pose as your new romantic interest to counter Nathan Blackwood's schemes, it wasn't mere politeness."

The corner of his mouth lifted in that perfectly calibrated smile - confident without being arrogant. Evelyn detected a flicker of uncertainty in his expression that mirrored her own confusion.

"Did our arrangement give you the wrong impression? I never intended-"

"I'm well aware you wouldn't manufacture drama," Preston interjected smoothly. "But the timing felt right to confess my genuine feelings."

His gaze locked onto hers with startling sincerity. "Unlike Nathan's heavy-handed tactics, my approach will be respectful. But make no mistake - my interest is very real."

Evelyn studied his open expression, the honesty in his eyes giving her pause. Under the golden glow of streetlamps, their elongated shadows stood motionless on the pavement.

A strange warmth bloomed in her chest at his humility.

Marrying Preston would be strategically advantageous - their social standing and business acumen perfectly matched. He might even be the one man Nathan couldn't intimidate.

Yet Evelyn recoiled at the thought of using relationships as bargaining chips. It would be unfair to Preston, reducing him to a pawn in her personal battles.

After a weighted silence, she schooled her features into polite neutrality. "Mr. Sinclair, I appreciate your candor but-"

"Don't dismiss me so quickly," Preston interrupted gently. "I'm not demanding an answer tonight. I simply want you to know my intentions - that I plan to court you properly."

The starlight reflected in his eyes made Evelyn's breath catch. She quickly regained her composure, offering a practiced smile.

"Let's keep business and personal matters separate, shall we? Our partnership is too valuable to jeopardize over romantic entanglements."

Preston's laughter rang out, rich with amusement. "Of course. Business first."

"Business first," Evelyn echoed in relief. The unspoken agreement lifted the invisible weight between them.

In one evening, she'd gently rebuffed two powerful men. The victory felt hollow.

Back at The Grandeur, Evelyn packed for her return to San Francisco. William Sterling approved their departure - apparently Lucas had been decimating his prized koi collection.

At dawn, little Oliver Sinclair came barreling in wearing dinosaur pajamas, his cherubic face crumpled with distress. Upon learning of Evelyn's departure, the boy stubbornly insisted on accompanying her.

Preston, detained by urgent business, reluctantly entrusted Oliver to Evelyn's care. She suspected his early morning absence wasn't entirely coincidental.

After last night's confession, an awkward morning encounter was best avoided.

Nathan had arranged their flights, determined to travel together. He waited in the lobby, no longer wheelchair-bound but leaning on an ornate cane. His imposing presence turned heads, the air around him crackling with restrained energy.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow stood nervously nearby, clutching the leash of an exuberant husky.

"Good morning," Evelyn said coolly, offering Nathan the barest nod of acknowledgment.

Nathan rose with visible effort, his voice carefully neutral. "We should leave."

Teddy bobbed his head anxiously. "Good morning, Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair. This is Mr. Whitmore's dog that requires transport to San Francisco. If it's an inconvenience-"

The husky suddenly cocked its head, fixing Teddy with an almost human expression of betrayal, its pink tongue lolling in comic dismay.
###Chapter 469 Let Her Stay

Oliver Sinclair stared at the enormous husky that stood nearly as tall as him, wrinkling his nose in distaste. "Pets aren't allowed on planes!"

Nathan Blackwood smirked, adjusting his cufflinks. "My jet makes its own rules."

Oliver's jaw dropped slightly before he recovered with an indignant huff. He grabbed Evelyn Sinclair's hand with sudden determination.

"My Muse," he declared, puffing out his chest, "when we get home, I'll commission a solid gold plane encrusted with diamonds for you! I won't let Mean Mister tempt you with his boring jet!"

Evelyn's lips twitched as she fought back laughter. "That's sweet, Oliver, but I don't care for private planes."

Oliver's shoulders slumped dramatically. Another failed gift attempt for his beloved Muse.

As their group exited the hotel, the husky suddenly barked. Standing shivering in the morning chill was Victoria Ashford, wrapped in Tristan Whitmore's suit jacket.

Victoria looked heartbreakingly fragile, her designer dress wrinkled from last night's rain. The husky sniffed the jacket hopefully before realizing Tristan wasn't present and retreated behind Teddy.

When Victoria spotted Nathan, her face lit up - until she noticed Evelyn behind him. She froze mid-step, uncertainty flashing across her features.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly. So Reginald Ashford was still pushing his daughter at Nathan.

William Sterling frowned at the unfamiliar woman. "Who's this?"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. Teddy quickly interjected, "No idea! Never seen her before!" His frantic tone made it obvious they all recognized her.

Victoria bit her lip, her wounded gaze fixed on Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood...your grandfather invited me to San Francisco. He suggested I travel with your party..."

Nathan's face remained impassive. After a tense silence, Evelyn suddenly smiled. "What a coincidence. She can come with us."

Taking Oliver's hand, Evelyn headed toward the waiting cars. William followed without comment.

Nathan took several steps with his cane before stopping abruptly. Without turning, he ordered Teddy in an icy voice: "Book her a commercial flight."

"Yes, sir!" Teddy barked. Victoria turned deathly pale, humiliation washing over her like a physical blow. Evelyn could ride in Nathan's private jet, while she was relegated to economy class.

Teddy quickly summoned the hotel manager. "Get Ms. Ashford a ticket to San Francisco," he instructed before practically diving into the car.

On board the plane, Evelyn and William discussed business across from each other while Teddy tended to the husky. This left Nathan facing Oliver in the plush cabin.

A flight attendant served Nathan coffee and brought Oliver milk. She couldn't resist cooing, "What an adorable little gentleman!"

Oliver scowled. "We're both men! Why does he get coffee?" Spotting Evelyn without a drink, he cleared his throat importantly. "Bring me coffee. For my Muse." He nodded sagely. "Nanny says all ladies like sweets."

Nathan chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "Light on the sugar. She prefers it bitter."
###Chapter 470 Why Not?

Oliver Sinclair huffed impatiently. "Bring the sugar. I'll do it myself!" He couldn't trust anyone in Nathan Blackwood's circle.

Not after last time.

What if they deliberately made Evelyn's coffee bitter? The flight attendant arrived with a porcelain cup and silver sugar bowl.

Nathan's lips curled into that infuriating smirk as he deliberately provoked the boy. "Don't overdo it. Evelyn prefers her coffee black." Oliver stuck out his tongue defiantly.

He'd prove this arrogant man wrong. Evelyn adored sweet things - he just knew it! Without hesitation, Oliver dumped six heaping spoonfuls until the dark liquid nearly overflowed. Only then did he step back, satisfied.

"She'll taste my affection in every sip!" Nathan arched an eyebrow but didn't intervene, calmly sipping his own bitter brew.

Oliver carefully carried the syrupy concoction to Evelyn. "Muse! I made this special for you. No one else gets coffee this perfect."

Evelyn paused her reading with an amused smile. "How thoughtful. Set it here darling, I'll enjoy it later."

The boy practically skipped back to his seat. William Sterling extended a hand. "I could use a pick-me-up. May I?" Evelyn readily passed him the cup.

One sip had William coughing violently into his handkerchief.

"Father!" Evelyn rushed to his side with tissues. "Are you alright?"

William shot Oliver an incredulous look before composing himself. "Just... remembered my doctor warned against sugar." That cup could send a diabetic into shock.

Oliver's triumphant grin faltered as Evelyn discreetly had the coffee removed. Nathan's quiet chuckle made his small hands clench.

"You tricked me!" Oliver accused, tiny chest heaving. "Grown-ups shouldn't lie to children!"

Nathan's smirk widened. "Last I checked, real men take responsibility for their choices." He deliberately used Oliver's favorite phrase against him.

The boy turned away with a dramatic huff. "When I inherit Daddy's empire, I'll crush you beneath my Italian loafers!"

After escorting Evelyn and William to Sterling Manor, Nathan returned to Aspen Lodge. Margaret Blackwood awaited with visible satisfaction - she'd finally convinced Old Master Blackwood to abandon the Sterling alliance.

No more tolerating that headstrong Evelyn. Margaret would happily accept any biddable girl - especially one she could control.

Entering the grand foyer, Nathan froze. There, sipping tea with his mother, sat Victoria Ashford of all people.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Victoria nearly spilled her Earl Grey in her haste to stand. Margaret beamed.

"I invited Ms. Ashford. Our families have such history." Her pointed glance said everything. "She'll be staying the week. You'll show her around, won't you darling?"

Nathan's cane hit the marble with a sharp crack. "What is this?" His glacial tone made Victoria pale.

Margaret's smile didn't waver. "Consider it... an alternative investment."
###Chapter 471 Not as Important as Her

Nathan's eyes were shadowed with exhaustion. He remained silent, his gaze lifting to meet Old Master Blackwood's piercing stare from the second-floor balcony.

A subtle nod passed between them.

Old Master Blackwood's lips thinned. "Come upstairs," he commanded.

The study was thick with tension as Nathan entered. The elder Blackwood sat behind his mahogany desk, expression unreadable.

"I made my position clear over the phone."

Nathan didn't hesitate. "And I don't agree."

Old Master Blackwood's face darkened. "If it weren't for the Sterling family backing Evelyn, I would never have tolerated this reunion. You nearly died for her, yet she remains indifferent. What of the Blackwood family's dignity?"

The air turned glacial.

Nathan's voice was ice. "The Blackwood name isn't as important as Evelyn."

The old man slammed his palm on the desk, fury contorting his features. "You—!"

Nathan didn't flinch. His voice dropped lower, lethal. "There will be no one else. That woman downstairs could never compare to her—let alone deserve to."

A paperweight flew across the room.

Nathan didn't dodge.

The sharp edge struck his temple, blood immediately streaking down his face.

Old Master Blackwood froze, then seethed. "This is all because of her!"

Nathan swayed slightly but steadied himself. He wiped the blood with his sleeve, his stare unwavering.

"If I can't choose who I marry, then find yourself an heir you can control."

The threat hung in the air.

Even without the Blackwood empire, Nathan's hidden influence could dismantle it with ease.

Without another word, he turned, cane in hand, and walked out.

The message was clear—he'd burn the family legacy before letting them dictate his heart.

Old Master Blackwood watched him leave, disgusted. His most promising heir, willing to throw everything away for a woman?

Nathan descended the stairs, his presence so frigid no one dared approach.

Margaret had expected him to yield.

"Nathan," she called, forcing a smile. "Stay a few days. Accompany Ms. Ashford for outings."

Victoria Ashford stood nearby, mimicking her half-sister Penelope's grace—poorly.

Nathan didn't even glance at her. He strode toward the door.

Margaret's voice turned shrill. "You defy your grandfather now?!"

Nathan paused. "Do you still wish to see Sophia?"

The room iced over.

Victoria, sensing danger, intervened. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood is busy. I'll explore the city alone. It's no trouble."

Margaret patted her hand stiffly. "So understanding."

Nathan left without another word.

Back at Highland Estates, Teddy was alone, walking the ridiculous husky.

Nathan scowled. "Why is that thing still here?"

Teddy grinned. "Young Master Whitmore insisted. Said he'd collect it personally."

The husky wagged its tail, then—mocking Nathan—limped in a circle.

Nathan's expression darkened.

Teddy burst out laughing. "No wonder Tristan said this dog has an IQ of 120!"

A single glare silenced him.
###Chapter 472 Goddess of Fortune at Highland Estates

The night air carried a crisp chill, wrapping the mansion in silence.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow observed Nathan Blackwood standing motionless on the balcony. "Ms. Sinclair won't be returning tonight, sir. She just arrived back in town and is likely resting at Sterling Manor."

Nathan's gaze remained fixed on the horizon. "I'm aware."

"Then why..." Teddy hesitated before voicing his confusion. "Perhaps it's for the best that Ms. Ashford stays. A little jealousy might bring Ms. Sinclair running back."

"Jealousy?" Nathan's expression darkened instantly. The suggestion felt like salt being rubbed into an open wound. His piercing glare made Teddy shrink back.

"Do you enjoy watching me suffer?"

Evelyn would probably celebrate Victoria Ashford's extended stay - she'd practically orchestrated their encounters back in...

Jealousy?

Nathan didn't dare entertain the thought.

Should he gamble his future on Evelyn's fleeting compassion?

No. He didn't deserve even that much.

Teddy retreated further into the shadows. What he'd assumed would be a simple business trip had spiraled out of control thanks to Preston Sinclair and Victoria Ashford's interference.

These weren't opponents to be taken lightly.

At this rate, Teddy feared he'd find himself tossed into the River Aurora before long!

Days passed without Evelyn setting foot in Highland Estates.

Her excuse? An overwhelming backlog at Sterling Corporation.

Truthfully, Evelyn found the distance from Nathan strangely liberating.

Between office hours, she reconnected with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont. Sebastian Hart joined them whenever boredom struck.

It felt like returning to her carefree life before Nathan - warm, familiar, and satisfying.

Scrolling through her social feed, Evelyn chuckled at William Sterling's generation sharing health tips while society ladies like Isabella and Natalie posted shopping hauls, complaining about their "exhausting" privileged lives between expanding their empires.

But Sebastian's posts raised eyebrows. The usually flamboyant playboy had suddenly developed refined tastes!

Their circle flooded his latest with comments:

[Jade carvings? Since when did Sebastian Hart develop such sophisticated tastes?]

[If the Hart heir is investing in luxury decor, should we buy stocks now?]

[Sebastian, did you purchase land? Rumor says thousands of acres in the south just changed hands! Congratulations!]

Old Reginald Hart himself commented: [I don't recall you promoting our family's diamond mines with this much enthusiasm!]

The thread fell silent after that.

Amused, Evelyn shared the post with her own caption.

Isabella messaged immediately: [Why encourage Sebastian's madness?]

[Evelyn Sinclair: Just helping spread the word.]

A notification popped up - someone had replied to her share.

[Teddy Winslow: Our generous Mr. Blackwood has ordered two thousand pounds. Payment ready whenever.]

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up, calculating whether two thousand pounds would suffice. Simultaneously, Preston Sinclair replied:

[Preston Sinclair: I'll take whatever remains.]

Now that was impressive!

When Sebastian discovered this, he nearly danced with joy. Four thousand pounds perfectly divided between two buyers.

His call came through instantly. "You must attend tonight's celebration! Bring those two benefactors to sign contracts. I'll be waiting!"

Evelyn didn't even get to refuse. For a moment, she regretted getting involved. Yet both Nathan and Preston - two notoriously busy men - agreed without hesitation.

Nathan arrived leaning on his cane rather than using his wheelchair, projecting steady composure.

Preston maintained his usual aristocratic warmth.

The event's exclusivity surprised Evelyn - political heavyweights and industry titans mingled effortlessly. This was no ordinary gathering.

Inside, Sebastian Hart worked the room with practiced charm. Spotting Evelyn, he rushed over with outstretched arms. "My Goddess of Fortune!"
###Chapter 473 The Mask of Deception

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk. She gave a subtle nod to the attendees before casting a pointed glance at Sebastian Hart.

"Mr. Hart, your sudden expansion into this business venture is quite... unexpected, isn't it?" Her voice carried just enough edge to make Sebastian shift uncomfortably.

Without this intervention, Preston Sinclair would have been forced to cover his grandiose promises from his own accounts.

The two titans of industry sat at the front. The signing ceremony proceeded with efficient solemnity, devoid of unnecessary fanfare.

This time, the spotlight wasn't on Sebastian as the organizer. All eyes naturally gravitated toward him.

Evelyn positioned herself beside Nathan Blackwood, effortlessly commanding attention as always.

The crowd surrounding Preston and Nathan consisted of those seeking favor, creating a stark contrast to Evelyn and Nathan's circle.

Preston and Nathan maintained composed expressions as they observed the other side. Both men couldn't shake the uncomfortable realization that they were essentially aiding their romantic rival.

During the reception's midpoint...

Evelyn's brow furrowed when she noticed Nathan's limping approach. She moved forward to intercept him.

"Mr. Blackwood, surely you could have sent a representative if mobility is an issue for you."

Nathan's eyebrows twitched almost imperceptibly.

"I wanted to personally inquire when you'll be returning to Highland Estates."

Their original agreement stipulated she would remain until his full recovery.

Evelyn paused momentarily, the corners of her mouth lifting in a calculated smile.

"I believe my presence would be inappropriate now. Doesn't Ms. Ashford attend to your needs, Mr. Blackwood? Should I return to Highland Estates, I fear the entire Blackwood clan might skin me alive!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly at the mention of that name.

The Blackwood family's intentions had become transparent. Evelyn was far too perceptive not to recognize their scheme.

"There's no possibility of anyone but you becoming my wife. No one else holds that power."

Nathan's tone brooked no argument, his gaze unshakably resolute.

Evelyn lowered her eyes with an unaffected smile.

"Let's not revisit this. The fragile peace between the Sterling and Blackwood families finally holds. If we continue testing each other's limits, reconciliation may become impossible. Shouldn't we focus on mutual interests instead, Mr. Blackwood?"

Business first - their shared professional creed.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his eyes betraying quiet frustration.

He had hoped to discuss matters of the heart, only to find her mind occupied solely with financial considerations.

"I'll resolve this situation promptly."

Victoria Ashford had become an unbearable thorn in Nathan's side. He refused to tolerate this arrangement indefinitely.

Evelyn offered a noncommittal laugh as Sebastian approached with two champagne flutes, studying Nathan with undisguised curiosity.

"Mr. Blackwood, while we're grateful for your assistance, I must ask - what prompted this unexpected generosity?"

Nathan Blackwood wasn't known for altruistic gestures without clear motivation.

Nathan's voice dropped to a glacial timbre. "If not for Evelyn, do you imagine I'd lift a finger for you?"

Sebastian's eyebrows arched - an answer he'd anticipated.

His attention then shifted to the dignified Preston Sinclair nearby, prompting immediate deference.

"Mr. Sinclair, what an honor. We appreciate your timely intervention, but might I inquire about your motivations?"

Evelyn shot Sebastian a warning glare, silently commanding him to cease stirring trouble.

Nathan's gaze swept between the two men before settling on Preston.

Preston offered a benign smile. "Isn't it our duty to assist those in need? The mountain communities require our support. As businessmen, we bear responsibility to dedicate resources to public welfare. Mr. Hart, I'd gladly participate in future initiatives of this nature."

Sebastian stood dumbfounded.

Even Evelyn regarded Preston with newfound admiration.

Nathan turned away with a derisive scoff. The hypocrisy was almost impressive.
###Chapter 474 Guess Who

The reception ended, and the crowd dispersed.

Sebastian Hart caught a ride with Evelyn Sinclair. During the drive back, he couldn't stop praising Preston Sinclair.

"That man operates on another level entirely. He's in a league of his own compared to us ordinary folk!"

Evelyn gave a slight nod in agreement.

The R&D project at Kingsley Tech was progressing remarkably well. Within days, they had achieved breakthrough results.

The new project assistant, Benjamin Carter, stationed at Kingsley Tech, found himself overwhelmed by the project's scale. He requested Evelyn to send additional support staff.

Evelyn approved the request without hesitation.

After all, the project had reached an advanced stage where complexity and specialization far exceeded initial expectations.

Two days later, Bennett delivered the list of new recruits to Evelyn.

Evelyn scanned the documents while Bennett hesitated. "These candidates all graduated from Ivy League schools. Would you like to select one personally?"

She flipped through the stack casually. "Who stands out in this batch?"

Bennett didn't answer directly. Instead, he hinted, "There's someone here you wouldn't expect."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched with curiosity. She turned several pages before freezing at a familiar photograph. Her fingers twitched, her smile vanishing instantly.

"What the hell?"

Bennett cleared his throat. "Victoria Ashford, daughter of Ashford Group's chairman."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she examined Victoria's credentials - a mediocre state university graduate with no notable achievements. Such qualifications shouldn't have made it past initial screening.

Bennett explained, "Chairman Ashford personally contacted our HR department. While the resume was forwarded, the final decision remains ours."

Evelyn's eyes flashed briefly. She tapped her fingers rhythmically on the desk, her expression unreadable.

It appeared Victoria Ashford was preparing for a long-term game.

Or perhaps she specifically aimed to infiltrate Sterling Corporation?

Whatever the motive, it certainly piqued Evelyn's interest.

A smirk played at Evelyn's lips. "Assign her to assist Benjamin then."

Bennett nodded. "Understood."

At Kingsley Tech...

Evelyn received a message from Dominic Kingsley requesting her presence for the next phase discussions.

Simultaneously, Victoria Ashford received her onboarding notice.

Victoria currently resided in a luxury apartment near Blackwood Enterprises, boasting premium amenities in an upscale neighborhood.

Her assignment directed her to report directly to Kingsley Tech, not Sterling Corporation.

Bennett handled her orientation.

When Evelyn arrived at Kingsley Tech, Dominic Kingsley waited at the entrance to greet the VIP.

Marcus opened the car door for Evelyn, who stepped out gracefully. Dominic greeted her warmly.

"Ms. Sterling, your punctuality is commendable."

Evelyn replied smoothly, "Tardiness isn't in my vocabulary."

As they chatted toward the elevators, they crossed paths with Bennett giving Victoria a tour, the new hire clutching paperwork.

Bennett paused to bow respectfully.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Sterling. This is our new—"

Victoria didn't greet them, her gaze locked on the elegant Evelyn. She expected recognition, but Evelyn didn't spare her a glance.

Evelyn didn't break stride, offering only a faint acknowledging smile as she followed Dominic toward the conference room, her regal bearing effortless.

Victoria's fists clenched as she stared at Evelyn's retreating figure.

This felt like their first meeting, yet she knew better.

The Evelyn before her exuded refinement so natural it couldn't be faked. That innate poise and confidence were qualities Victoria could never replicate.

"Let's go, Ms. Ashford," Bennett instructed briskly. "Fetch three coffees - two black, one with milk only."
Here's the rewritten version following all your instructions:

###Chapter 475 Drink Mine

Victoria Ashford nodded and headed to the pantry. In her mind, Penelope Ashford was the epitome of high society. Penelope moved effortlessly among elite circles for the family business. Even Reginald Ashford couldn't stop praising his eldest daughter.

To appease Penelope, Reginald never publicly acknowledged Victoria as his daughter. If not for needing an unmarried daughter for business alliances, Victoria would still be trapped in that tiny apartment.

Victoria carried the coffee tray toward the conference room.

As she opened the door, she saw Nathan Blackwood speaking with Dominic Kingsley near the entrance. Nathan appeared aloof and composed, but when his gaze landed on Evelyn across the room, his eyes softened noticeably.

The stark contrast to the disdain he showed Victoria made her heart ache.

The three figures at the table seemed to exist in their own exclusive world, far removed from ordinary people.

When Nathan looked up and noticed Victoria standing there, his expression immediately darkened.

Victoria pretended not to notice his reaction and quietly entered to serve the coffee. "Your coffee, everyone."

Evelyn heard her voice and glanced over silently. Before she could speak, Nathan's icy tone cut through the air.

"What are you doing here?"

Nathan shot Dominic a questioning look since this was his company. Why was this woman present?

Dominic shrugged innocently, then suddenly remembered. "This must be the new assistant from Sterling Corporation. Benjamin needed extra help, right?" He turned to Evelyn for confirmation.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before nodding. She studied Victoria with a measured gaze. "Since you're new here, focus on adapting quickly."

Victoria tensed slightly, unprepared for Evelyn's composed reaction.

Cool, collected, and slightly patronizing.

That simple statement served as both acknowledgment and subtle warning.

Victoria nodded, suppressing the turmoil inside. "Understood, Ms. Sterling."

She knew perfectly well that without her father's influence, she'd never have gotten this assistant position based on her qualifications alone.

Reginald Ashford wanted Victoria to emulate Evelyn, hoping it would bring her closer to Nathan's inner circle.

Nathan frowned. His expression remained neutral, but discomfort prickled at him.

He watched Evelyn intently, searching for clues in her demeanor.

"It doesn't add up," he thought. "Sterling Corporation and Ashford Group have no business ties. Is this really coincidence?"

Victoria proactively served black coffee to the two men and a milk coffee to Evelyn before stepping aside to prepare meeting notes.

Evelyn took a small sip before setting the cup aside. She resumed the earlier discussion.

"Mr. Sinclair wants to increase his investment because he's bullish about AI prospects and confident in our R&D capabilities. But he has one condition - when the project matures, he wants it listed in Liberty. That would definitely make waves on Wall Street and globally."

Nathan's eyes darkened. He always separated business from personal matters. His tone remained flat.

"He's been in Liberty too long and lost touch with domestic realities. I believe we should expand in Montecito first. I oppose listing in Liberty."

Dominic interjected, "Mr. Sinclair's idea has merit. A Liberty listing would attract more investors and global attention, propelling our project to the top. We'd become untouchable. But..." He hesitated. "It somehow feels like betraying our country."

Evelyn frowned, tapping her fingers thoughtfully on the table.

Seeing this, Victoria hurried forward to refill Evelyn's coffee with careful movements.

###Chapter 476 You Don't Need To

Evelyn remained indifferent, never touching the coffee with milk froth.

Nathan, seated across from her, noticed and slid his untouched cup toward her.

Evelyn raised a questioning brow. Nathan's lips curved slightly. To outsiders, his flirtatious gaze appeared tender. "Haven't touched it yet. This one's black."

Dominic chuckled, eyeing his own cup. "Oh, Ms. Sterling's cup is actually mine. This isn't Kingsley Tech's oversight, is it?"

Victoria's heart pounded like a boulder crushed her chest. She'd assumed preferences without asking.

She had to admit she'd made a poor assistant.

Evelyn smiled faintly, twirling her pen carelessly. "Fine. My assistant's mistake. As apology, I'll invite you to my brother's yacht launch tonight. Interested?"

Dominic clicked his tongue. "Absolutely! Lucas's events are impossible to get into. Can I bring a plus one?"

"No, just you," Evelyn said.

Nathan's clear voice cut in. "I'm attending too."

Evelyn nodded and began packing her things as if nothing happened. "Let's pause here. We'll continue the listing discussion when Mr. Sinclair visits next. Excuse me."

Dominic called after her. "Join us for lunch?"

"No, thanks." As Evelyn moved to leave, she glanced at Victoria. "Benjamin's traveling, so you'll accompany me tonight."

She didn't ask for Victoria's opinion.

Victoria instinctively looked at Nathan, equal parts cautious and delighted. "Yes, Ms. Sterling."

Opportunities were presenting themselves. Sooner or later, Nathan would notice her.

Evelyn exited without another glance.

In the now-empty conference room, only Dominic and Nathan remained.

Dominic studied Nathan's stormy expression and couldn't resist needling him. "Mr. Blackwood, I thought your reconciliation was going splendidly. Seems there are still... complications?"

Nathan's sharp gaze could pierce steel. His face showed no warmth. "Curiosity killed the cat."

Dominic paused, then stood with an amused smile. "Tsk tsk. Do you think Ms. Sterling kept that assistant around intentionally?"

Nathan's exact thought. Yet he remained impassive, raising one brow. "Why don't you ask her yourself?"

Dominic got no reaction - exactly as expected. Few had the privilege of witnessing Nathan's private dramas, let alone seeing him lose composure.

Nathan calmly rose, leaning on his cane as he limped out, radiating unapproachable authority.

In the elevator lobby, Victoria waited nearby. She hurried to press the button for him. "Mr. Blackwood—"

She wanted his attention.

Nathan ignored her. "Where's Ms. Sterling?" His tone treated her like any subordinate.

Victoria's face stiffened. She pointed toward a side office. "With Benjamin."

Nathan said nothing, heading to the opposite office to wait for Evelyn.

Victoria lowered her eyes to hide her disappointment, then went to fetch Nathan coffee.

Nathan frowned. "You're not my assistant." His implication was clear - she'd overstepped.

Victoria bit her lip, affecting a soft, ingratiating manner. "Mr. Blackwood, it's my first yacht event. Any protocols I should know?"

Nathan replied coolly, "You don't need to do anything." She was merely an assistant - what preparations could she possibly need?

Victoria smiled awkwardly.
###Chapter 477 What Are You Doing?

The Royal Opera House glittered under the night sky, its marquee announcing the premiere of the season. Evelyn Sinclair clutched her front-row tickets, the crisp paper edges biting into her gloved fingers.

She stepped out of the limousine in a champagne-colored gown that whispered rather than shouted. The high neckline and long sleeves exuded sophistication, while the bias cut accentuated her willowy frame. Preston Sinclair had personally selected this dress from a Parisian atelier and sent it via Bennett.

Paparazzi flashbulbs exploded like fireworks as she approached. The crowd's roar swelled - Lucas Sterling's star power truly knew no bounds. Then disaster struck. Her custom Louboutin caught on the red carpet's edge, sending her stumbling. The delicate stiletto snapped clean at the heel.

Cameras whirred hungrily below. One misstep now would land her on every gossip site by morning. Evelyn bit back a curse and retreated into the limo's sanctuary.

Marcus, her bodyguard, frowned. "Ms. Sterling, what happened?"

"My shoe's destroyed," she hissed. "Find me replacements. Now."

Victoria Ashford materialized like a specter. "I always carry emergency heels in my bag. They should fit you, Ms. Sinclair." Her saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes.

Evelyn studied the offered pumps - decent quality, but clearly off-the-rack. "How...thoughtful," she said through clenched teeth. Time was slipping away like sand through fingers.

The replacement shoes pinched immediately. As she resumed her walk, the left strap suddenly gave way. Evelyn bent to adjust it when icy fingers of dread raced down her spine - her back zipper had split open.

Every hair on her arms stood erect. This wasn't coincidence. This was sabotage. And only one person stood to gain.

Flashbulbs popped like gunfire. Evelyn's mind raced. If she stood now, every camera would capture her humiliation. She could already feel the night air kissing her exposed skin.

Reporters began murmuring at her prolonged crouch. Just as she braced for disaster, warmth enveloped her shoulders. Preston Sinclair's bespoke tuxedo jacket settled around her like a shield.

She looked up into amused hazel eyes. Preston didn't flinch from the cameras, his posture casual as if shielding her from a breeze. The press went wild.

"Is this the mystery man from your Instagram?" shouted one reporter.

"Are you two officially dating?" cried another.

The questions blurred together. All Evelyn registered was Preston's steadying presence as he guided her inside.

In the private lounge, Preston knelt before her. "These shoes are an insult to that dress," he murmured, carefully removing the offending pumps. His fingers lingered a heartbeat too long on her ankle.

Their eyes locked. The air between them crackled.

Three silent seconds stretched into eternity.

Then Nathan Blackwood's voice sliced through the moment like a blade. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
###Chapter 478 Lead a Horse to Water From

Nathan's perspective showed Evelyn sitting gracefully while Preston knelt before her in a posture that could easily be mistaken for a marriage proposal.

The tenderness in Preston's movements as he removed Evelyn's shoes sent waves of discomfort through Nathan.

They resembled a couple deeply in love! Nathan's expression darkened, his icy glare fixed dangerously on Preston.

Though Preston heard Nathan's voice, he calmly finished putting Evelyn's shoes back on before rising with perfect composure.

"Ms. Sterling, you should have someone bring you a change of clothes and wait in the upstairs lounge." Evelyn thanked him naturally before texting Lucas to prepare a new dress and shoes.

Lucas remained her most reliable sibling. She wouldn't trust her bodyguard Marcus with fashion choices - the man had no sense of style whatsoever.

Nathan approached with thunderous steps, his stormy gaze locked on Preston. Seeing another man touch what he considered his property ignited possessive fury within him.

He was losing control! Despite his limp and cane, Nathan's presence remained commanding and intimidating.

Preston met Nathan's gaze without flinching, his gentlemanly demeanor matching Nathan's intensity blow for blow.

Sparks flew between the two men as their silent battle raged. "What exactly were you doing just now?" Nathan repeated, his voice dripping with venom.

His eyes burned when they landed on Preston's suit jacket wrapped around Evelyn's shoulders. The sight felt like a knife twisting in his gut.

Nathan's gaze flickered with barely restrained fury.

Evelyn walked past him, pausing briefly to murmur, "We don't owe you explanations for our actions, do we?" Her tone made clear she resented Nathan overstepping boundaries.

He needed to remember his place. Besides, if Victoria Ashford was behind this incident, Nathan bore responsibility. Without his past entanglements, Evelyn wouldn't have nearly suffered public humiliation.

Without waiting for Nathan's response, Evelyn ascended to the lounge. Nathan's expression darkened further, his eyes becoming storm clouds.

Preston approached with a polite smile, his face carefully neutral. "Mr. Blackwood, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Some things simply can't be forced."

Nathan's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. "Regardless, it remains my horse. No one else is worthy to touch it." The temperature in the room seemed to plummet instantly.

Outside, reporters and fans remained oblivious to this explosive confrontation - had they known, it would have sparked another media frenzy.

Upstairs in the private lounge...

Lucas arrived with replacement attire, exasperated yet efficient as always when dealing with his troublesome sister. "Fortunately the sponsors carry your preferred brand, though these are off-the-rack pieces."

"Don't you usually wear custom designs for these events?" Evelyn sighed in relief as she removed Preston's jacket and turned her back to Lucas.

"Look at this!" The zipper had broken, exposing a scandalous amount of skin. While Evelyn had an enviable back, this dress wasn't designed to be backless, making the malfunction particularly inappropriate.

Having collaborated with her favorite designer for years, Evelyn knew this wasn't a production error. Lucas's eyes widened in shock. "What the hell? Who did this? Bennett can't even do his job properly?" His anger flared at the deliberate sabotage.

Evelyn gathered the new clothes and headed for the changing room. "It wasn't Bennett. Someone else is responsible."

"Who? I'll make them pay!" Lucas's protective instincts roared to life - nobody messed with his baby sister.

Evelyn chuckled softly as she closed the door. "I'll handle it. You can go now." Lucas stormed out, his fury barely contained.
###Chapter 479 Can't Explain

Evelyn slipped into an elegant black evening gown.

The dress accentuated her regal bearing, making her appear untouchable. The designer heels were her signature style, perfectly complementing her outfit.

She exhaled slowly, replaying the earlier events in her mind.

Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed Marcus.

"Make sure Victoria Ashford shows up," she instructed.

"Understood, Miss Sinclair," Marcus replied promptly.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before stepping out of the room.

Gabrielle, Lucas's assistant, was waiting just outside.

"Mr. Sterling was concerned about you being alone tonight," Gabrielle explained. "He asked me to accompany you."

Evelyn nodded. She could use the extra help.

"Perfect. Wait here for Ms. Ashford," she said with a faint smile. "I need to speak with her privately."

Gabrielle gave a reassuring nod. "Of course, Miss Sinclair."

"It's almost time. I'll head downstairs first."

With that, Evelyn descended gracefully. She wasn't one to tolerate nonsense, and tonight would be no exception.

The theater hall was bathed in soft, dramatic lighting.

Only one seat remained in the front row—sandwiched between Nathan and Preston.

Evelyn paused mid-step.

Fantastic. Just the kind of suffocating arrangement she didn’t need.

Before she could reconsider, Preston spotted her and waved her over.

She forced a composed smile and took her seat.

Nathan didn’t glance her way. No warm greeting, no acknowledgment.

His usual gentle demeanor was absent.

Clearly, he was still upset about earlier.

Evelyn suppressed a sigh.

Preston leaned in, whispering, "Lucas has quite the fanbase. The entire audience is here for him."

Pride swelled in Evelyn's chest, though she remained modest.

"My brother is just fortunate—good looks, talent, and charm."

Preston's lips twitched before breaking into a wider grin.

Nathan, seated beside her, remained silent.

His expression only darkened further.

The first act concluded. An assistant approached with three cups of coffee.

Preston handed one to Evelyn, who passed it to Nathan.

Nathan hesitated for half a second before reaching for it.

Then—disaster.

The cup slipped before he could secure his grip.

Hot coffee splashed onto his immaculate suit.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

His OCD wouldn’t allow him to sit through the rest of the evening like this.

As he stood, the assistant was quicker, snatching his cane.

"Apologies, Mr. Blackwood—"

Nathan shot him a sharp glare and reclaimed his cane.

Then his eyes flicked to Evelyn. "I need to change."

She nodded, watching him leave before settling back into her seat.

Something about the assistant seemed familiar.

Moments after Nathan exited, Evelyn discreetly slipped out.

Theodore had already relayed Nathan’s lounge number to him.

Nathan stepped out of the elevator and located the room.

Inside, darkness greeted him.

He flicked the lights on—and froze.

A woman’s purse and dress lay discarded on the plush sofa.

His expression turned icy.

Then, the bathroom door creaked open.

A dripping-wet Victoria Ashford emerged, wrapped in nothing but a flimsy towel.

It barely covered her.

Nathan’s face darkened dangerously.

His gaze was sharp enough to cut glass.

"Who told you to come here?" His voice was glacial.

Victoria gasped, clutching the slipping towel with reddened cheeks.

"Mr. Blackwood! Wh-what are you doing here?"

Nathan’s disdain was palpable.

"Get out—"

Before he could finish, Victoria suddenly shrieked and ducked behind him.

A swarm of reporters burst through the door, cameras flashing relentlessly.
###Chapter 480 Get Lost With You

Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Ashford's intimate embrace created an explosive scene that stunned everyone present.

The paparazzi descended like vultures spotting fresh prey.

Camera shutters clicked relentlessly, capturing every angle of the compromising position. Victoria Ashford trembled behind Nathan's broad frame, her delicate form shaking with apparent fear.

None of the reporters anticipated both Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood would have new romantic entanglements. In the next heartbeat, Nathan shoved Victoria away as if she were contaminated garbage.

His expression radiated pure disgust without restraint. He didn't care that Victoria stood nearly naked before the flashing cameras. Nathan advanced toward the reporters with a gaze that could freeze hell itself.

"I don't care who tipped you off." His voice dripped with menace. "If a single word or photo of this leaks, every one of you will be unemployed by sunrise."

The camera clicks ceased instantly. An oppressive silence fell over the hallway. The reporters stared at Nathan with undisguised terror. Normally seen only in financial sections, Nathan Blackwood's name occasionally graced tabloid covers connected to Evelyn.

Because these stories were never suppressed - Nathan allowed them - the media had forgotten the untouchable status of Blackwood Enterprises' CEO. A man whose influence reached into every industry.

That Nathan Blackwood's name appeared in gossip columns at all was practically sacrilege. Yet these reporters had grown bold enough to chase his scandals. Their audacity!

A collective shiver ran through the group as their eyes darted to the pitiful figure crumpled on the floor - Victoria Ashford. She had been their informant, promising explosive revelations.

Nathan followed their gazes and instantly understood.

"She dares scheme against me?" His eyes darkened like storm clouds, radiating an arctic chill. His imposing frame seemed to grow larger, his voice sharp as a guillotine blade.

"Get the hell out of here!" The reporters scattered like frightened mice, terrified of becoming examples. The hallway emptied within seconds.

Nathan turned his attention to the trembling woman on the floor. Victoria's bare shoulders shook with affected vulnerability, her porcelain skin glowing in the dim light. But Nathan saw only deception.

The door remained wide open.

Nathan couldn't care less about Victoria's exposed state.

Victoria, however, feigned modesty, clutching the bath towel tighter around herself. "Mr. Blackwood, please let me dress first-" Her plan had failed spectacularly.

She'd hoped to force Nathan into acknowledging their relationship publicly, securing her position at his side. But Nathan's glacial stare cut through her like an arctic wind.

"Ms. Ashford, I detest being manipulated." Victoria's face drained of color as she stammered denials. "It wasn't me!" Nathan saw through the lie immediately, his gaze shifting away in disgust.

He couldn't bear looking at her another second. "Evidence would be trivial to obtain, but you're not worth my time." His voice held finality, leaving no room for negotiation.

"You have two choices: disappear back to whatever hole you crawled from, or I'll have Reginald Ashford join you in exile." Victoria's face turned ashen, her heart plummeting to her stomach.
###Chapter 481 The Spectacle Unfolds

Nathan Blackwood's demeanor was icy and unyielding, his stance leaving no room for negotiation. It was a stark contrast to what Victoria Ashford had envisioned.

Victoria was utterly taken aback. Panic surged through her, her eyes welling with pitiful tears.

Her cheeks flushed crimson as she trembled, gazing at Nathan with the look of a wounded fawn. "Mr. Blackwood, why? Everyone says we'd make the perfect match." As the youngest daughter of Reginald Ashford, chairman of Ashford Group, Victoria believed their social standings aligned perfectly.

Yet despite this, Nathan refused to even glance her way. Why hadn't he sought a marriage alliance with her family? During this period, Evelyn Sinclair had shown no interest in him whatsoever.

So why couldn't Victoria secure his attention? The confusion and desperate hope twisted inside her.

Nathan didn't spare her a single glance, nor did he bother with explanations. To him, she wasn't worth his time. He pulled out his phone and dialed Theodore.

"Send someone up to clean this room immediately." His voice carried a bone-chilling frost that made the air itself seem to freeze. As he turned to leave, he suddenly froze mid-step.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, who stood framed in the opposite doorway. A storm of emotions flashed through his eyes, followed by a flicker of panic—what if she misunderstood?

Nathan strode forward, his expression grim. "Evelyn, what are you doing here?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into an amused smirk. "Why, I'm enjoying the show, of course!"

She had sensed something amiss from the very beginning. The moment that cup of coffee had "accidentally" spilled on Nathan, Evelyn had noticed the assistant's strange behavior.

Her mind raced. Who was behind this? It had to be one of Benjamin Carter's team members working on the Kingsley Tech project—someone who knew Victoria well. Why else would they create an opportunity for Victoria to barge into Nathan's room uninvited?

So Evelyn had followed, positioning herself to witness the entire spectacle unnoticed.

This drama far surpassed Lucas Sterling's performance downstairs.

Pity Victoria's tactics were so amateurish. She should have invited their parents instead of just reporters.

Nathan stood rigid, his face darkening with hurt. Evelyn's indifference cut deeper than any anger would have. He'd have preferred her shouting at him over this detached amusement.

"Enjoying yourself?" Nathan asked, his tone deceptively calm.

Evelyn's smirk widened. "A bit cliché, but entertaining nonetheless."

Victoria's ploy was painfully transparent, but watching Nathan squirm was always amusing. Evelyn caught the icy glint in his eyes—Victoria's chances with him were now less than zero. Nathan despised schemers.

Evelyn might have helped Victoria, but since the girl had tried to manipulate her too, she'd let the consequences unfold naturally.

Nathan approached, his cane tapping against the marble floor. The air around him turned glacial.

As he drew nearer, Evelyn caught the crisp scent of winter mint clinging to him. For a fleeting moment, she forgot to breathe.

She lifted her chin, schooling her features into neutrality. Nathan looked down at her, his lips parting slightly.

"Had you been the leading lady, the ending would've been far more... explosive." The hunger in his voice betrayed years of pent-up longing.

Evelyn held his gaze without flinching, though her pulse quickened. She let out a soft laugh. "Perhaps with a different leading man."

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. The mere suggestion of another man touching what was his sent fury coursing through his veins.

Ignoring his injured leg, he closed the distance between them in one swift motion, pinning Evelyn against the wall with predatory intensity. His body caged hers, leaving no escape.
###Chapter 482 Termination Notice

Nathan's piercing gaze intensified. A flicker of panic flashed through Evelyn's eyes before she glared back at him with visible irritation.

The tension between them was palpable. They stood so close that Evelyn could feel Nathan's warm breath against her skin.

For a brief moment, her heartbeat accelerated. She raised her hands to push him away, but Nathan caught her wrists in an instant. His dark, intense eyes bore into hers as he spoke in a husky whisper.

"Evelyn, tell me what I must do to earn your forgiveness." The raw vulnerability in his voice felt like he was offering her his still-beating heart. Evelyn tilted her chin up to meet his gaze.

An electric current seemed to shoot through her chest.

After a weighted pause, she gave a humorless laugh. "Mr. Blackwood, spare yourself the effort. I never look back at what I've left behind." Her voice was as cold as marble. Just then, approaching footsteps interrupted the charged moment.

Who dared intrude now? "Ms. Sinclair," came Preston Sinclair's smooth voice, "curtain call approaches. Shall I escort you back?" His timely arrival anchored her wavering resolve against Nathan's emotional onslaught.

With calculated calm, Evelyn extracted herself from Nathan's grasp. Her eyes remained frosty. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair." She deliberately ignored Nathan's burning stare as she took Preston's arm, disappearing into the waiting elevator.

The sensation of Nathan's dagger-like gaze followed them until the doors closed. Nathan fought to control the storm of emotions threatening to consume him as he watched her walk away.

The terrifying realization that he might truly lose her forever tightened its grip. Fear, desperation, and panic warred within him - yet he remained silent.

Only after long minutes did his clenched fists finally relax.

Morning sunlight streamed through Evelyn's balcony as birdsong filled the air. The lush trees provided dappled shade as she stretched before heading to Sterling Corporation early.

Evelyn's office wardrobe reflected her confidence - sometimes sleek skirts, other times tailored separates. She never conformed to corporate stereotypes of power dressing. Who would dare comment?

Bennett entered with documents just as Evelyn sipped her coffee, the rich aroma soothing her. She set down the cup with a satisfied smile. "Before anything else today, inform HR to terminate Victoria Ashford immediately."

Bennett blinked in surprise but quickly schooled his expression. "Additionally," Evelyn continued, "research all upcoming projects Ashford Group is pursuing. Acquire any promising ones."

Though curious, Bennett knew better than to question. "Understood, Ms. Sinclair." He exited promptly.

Evelyn rarely acted so decisively without cause. For Victoria to be dismissed within three days meant she'd crossed an unforgivable line.

Most society women in such positions received graceful exits. But Evelyn's public termination and subsequent business moves delivered a calculated humiliation to Ashford Group.

After a morning of meetings and lunch with Alexander, Evelyn returned to find Bennett waiting. "Victoria Ashford has been in the lobby for two hours demanding to see you before leaving."

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Death throes of the guilty? She should have considered consequences earlier." Dismissively, she waved her hand. "Send her away. I won't waste another moment on her."

Bennett nodded - he'd expected nothing less. This was merely protocol before having security remove their unwelcome guest.
###Chapter 483 No More Excuses

Sterling Corporation's executive lounge.

Victoria Ashford sat frozen in her seat, her face drained of color. The termination notice hadn't been officially announced yet, but the writing was on the wall.

Reginald Ashford had pulled countless strings to secure her position at Sterling Corp. Victoria couldn't bear imagining his reaction when he discovered she'd ruined everything.

She'd clawed her way up from being the illegitimate daughter, nearly escaping her past demons. Now she teetered on the edge of an abyss - one misstep away from complete destruction.

"Ms. Ashford." Bennett's voice snapped her back to reality. She jumped to her feet, pulse racing.

"Madam Sinclair has back-to-back meetings today with no available openings." Bennett's professional tone offered no comfort. "You should leave now."

Victoria's hands trembled. "This makes no sense. Why am I being fired without warning?" A desperate hope flickered that her misdeeds remained undiscovered.

Yesterday's humiliation by Nathan Blackwood still burned fresh. But as long as she remained at Sterling Corp, there was still a chance. She refused to surrender.

Bennett's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Perhaps you should reflect on what you did to offend Madam Sinclair."

He didn't need explanations. Evelyn Sinclair's wrath spoke volumes, and Bennett knew exactly how to handle troublesome individuals. Victoria's face turned ghostly pale.

Her stomach dropped. How had Evelyn uncovered everything so quickly? Victoria bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "I demand to see Madam Sinclair personally. Whatever grievances she has, I'll make amends."

She adopted the perfect wounded expression - the picture of unjust persecution. Bennett remained impassive. "No apologies necessary, Ms. Ashford. Your punishment is termination."

"Return to being the Ashford heiress. Madam Sinclair runs an empire - she hasn't the patience for petty employee disputes."

Panic set in. "My father is Reginald Ashford! Is this how Evelyn treats the Ashford family?"

Bennett's gaze turned glacial. "Then by all means, have Chairman Ashford take this up with Madam Sinclair." He signaled nearby security. "Escort Ms. Ashford out."

The humiliation burned like acid. In that moment, Victoria understood the brutal truth - she was merely the daughter of Ashford Group's chairman, while Evelyn Sinclair commanded an entire corporate kingdom.

They existed in different stratospheres. Evelyn didn't even deem her worthy of a confrontation.

Outside Sterling Tower's gleaming facade, the midday sun offered no warmth. An icy dread crept up Victoria's spine as she realized - Evelyn hadn't bothered with explanations because she already knew everything.

No theatrics. No dramatic confrontation. Just swift, merciless execution.

Collapsing onto the plaza steps, Victoria stared up at the monolithic skyscraper - a cold, unfeeling beast that had spat her out. The message was clear: she never belonged there in the first place.
###Chapter 484 Swept Out the Door

Victoria Ashford's schemes were laid bare under the harsh light of day.

There was no hiding now. She remained seated until sunset, too terrified to move.

Victoria had imagined countless scenarios of how Evelyn Sinclair might react.

Would Evelyn rage at her? Would she scream, or perhaps even strike her? Victoria's true target had always been Nathan Blackwood—something Evelyn knew all too well.

Surely, Evelyn would treat her differently because of that. But in this moment, Victoria realized with crushing clarity that she meant nothing to Evelyn.

Just as Evelyn had hired her without hesitation, she could just as easily discard her.

Evelyn strode confidently from her office in sleek stilettos, flanked by her bodyguard and assistant. Department heads hurried alongside her, seeking her guidance on urgent matters.

Their expressions were a mix of deference and sycophancy.

That commanding presence—the kind of power Victoria could never hope to possess—made her suddenly aware of the vast chasm between them.

Even if Victoria were legitimized as the chairman's daughter, the ugliness in her soul would never compare to Evelyn's unshakable integrity.

At that moment, Victoria lost all courage to face Evelyn.

She was already a joke. Why give Evelyn the satisfaction of laughing in her face? Victoria turned on her heel and fled in the opposite direction.

At Blackwood Enterprises, Harrison noticed Nathan's foul mood had worsened in recent days. His decisions had become ruthless, his tone icy. Clearly, things weren't progressing well with Evelyn.

Employees delivered their reports with trepidation. By evening, Harrison knocked on Nathan's office door.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said carefully, "I've just received word that Sterling Corporation terminated an employee today."

Nathan barely glanced up. Harrison wouldn't bother him with trivial firings—unless it was significant.

"It's Victoria Ashford," Harrison added.

A flicker of disgust crossed Nathan's face. His voice was glacial.

"She deserves worse."

Harrison hesitated before continuing. "Madam Blackwood called. She wants Victoria to work here, since she has nowhere else to go."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

"This company does not accept trash," he said, each word sharp as a blade.

Harrison nodded. "Understood." He'd have to find a way to handle Margaret Blackwood's request.

After a beat, Nathan spoke again, his tone indifferent. "Evict her from the apartment my mother arranged. I never want to see her again."

Harrison stiffened. Nathan's patience had run out. "Yes, sir." He didn't dare ask questions—just turned and left.

When Victoria received no response from Blackwood Enterprises, she returned to her apartment—only to find a polite but firm middle-aged man waiting at her door.

"Ms. Ashford," he said, "this property has been reclaimed. You'll need to vacate by tomorrow morning."

Victoria paled. "Madam Blackwood leased this place for me."

"We're acting on direct orders," the man replied. "The apartment will be cleared regardless of your presence."

An ultimatum.

"Am I being thrown out?" Victoria whispered. Who would dare defy Margaret's orders?

She already knew the answer.

She had crossed Nathan Blackwood one too many times.

With no other choice, Victoria packed her belongings that night and slunk back to the Ashford estate in disgrace.
###Chapter 485 The Disaster You've Created Victoria Ashford

Victoria Ashford knew something was wrong the moment she stepped through the gates. Penelope Ashford's sleek black Mercedes was parked in the driveway, meaning her half-sister had returned home.

Normally, Penelope would announce her presence with dramatic flair, ensuring the entire household knew of her arrival. This eerie silence was unnatural.

The quiet made Victoria's pulse quicken. As she pushed open the front door, a crystal vase came flying toward her face. She barely dodged in time, but the heavy base still struck her shoulder. Pain shot through her body as cold sweat beaded on her forehead.

Looking up, she saw them - Penelope and Reginald Ashford seated on the velvet sofa, their expressions glacial.

"You dare show your face here?" Penelope's voice dripped venom. "After the catastrophe you've caused?"

Victoria's blood ran cold. Her father's eyes held nothing but disgust.

Penelope advanced like a predator, her designer heels clicking against the marble. "We sent you to seduce Nathan Blackwood, not to humiliate our family!"

Victoria's knees trembled. The Ashford mansion's opulence suddenly felt like a gilded cage.

Penelope's perfectly manicured nails dug into Victoria's arm. "Haven't you spent your whole life dreaming of climbing the social ladder? Couldn't even keep a man interested? You're as useless as your gold-digging mother."

To high society, Penelope was the picture of elegance. Only Victoria saw this cruel side - the vicious half-sister who'd tormented her since childhood.

Reginald remained silent, his disapproval radiating like winter frost. He'd always treated Victoria as the family's dirty secret.

Victoria bit her lip until she tasted blood. How much did they know? Had news of her humiliating rejection spread already?

Penelope yanked Victoria's hair brutally. "Speak! Or are you too ashamed to explain how you single-handedly destroyed our biggest deal?"

Victoria's vision swam as Penelope shoved her to the floor. The impact sent fresh waves of pain through her body. She looked desperately toward Reginald, but found no mercy in his cold stare.

"Your sister speaks truth," Reginald finally said. "The Stanton Corporation took our half-year project because of you. Evelyn Sinclair made it clear - this was punishment for your behavior."

Victoria's breath caught. That night flashed through her mind - standing nearly naked before Nathan Blackwood, only to be dismissed like common trash. The memory burned as painfully as her father's contempt.

She curled into herself, sobbing. This life of luxury, even with its cruelties, was better than the poverty she'd escaped. Better to endure their abuse than return to being nobody.

"I tried everything," Victoria whispered through tears. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't look at me. I couldn't—"

Penelope's laugh cut like broken glass. "Failing with Blackwood is one thing. But provoking Evelyn Sinclair? That stupidity cost us millions."

Victoria's stomach dropped. The weight of her failure pressed down until she could barely breathe. The Ashfords' wrath was only beginning, and she had nowhere left to hide.
###Chapter 486 You're Not Qualified

Penelope Ashford's face twisted in frustration as she confronted Victoria Ashford. She could no longer contain her anger and delivered a stinging slap across Victoria's cheek.

"This is all your doing! What exactly did you say to upset Evelyn Sinclair?" Penelope's voice dripped with venom. "The entire elite circle is mocking me for having such an incompetent sister!"

The high society circles were tight-knit, and word traveled fast.

Ashford Group might have been influential domestically, but it paled in comparison to the global powerhouse that was Sterling Worldwide.

Penelope knew Evelyn moved in entirely different circles - the crème de la crème of international society that she could only dream of joining.

Victoria's cheek burned from the impact, but the humiliation cut deeper.

So Evelyn had known all along about Victoria's schemes.

Rather than confronting Victoria directly, Evelyn had gone straight to Ashford Group, forcing the entire family to bear responsibility for Victoria's actions. This was Evelyn's way of demonstrating the vast gulf between them.

With one casual move, Evelyn had rendered both Victoria and Ashford Group powerless to retaliate. The message was clear - Evelyn played in a league far beyond their reach.

Seeing Victoria's pitiful expression reminded Penelope of her stepmother's similar look when she'd destroyed their family. The memory only fueled her rage further.

Penelope delivered a sharp kick to Victoria's shin. "Out with it! What exactly did you do?"

With no other choice, Victoria confessed everything.

At Sterling Worldwide headquarters, Evelyn was reviewing departmental reports when Bennett entered her office. "Ms. Sterling."

Evelyn nodded to the department head, who took the cue to exit immediately.

Bennett cleared his throat. "Chairman Ashford just called. Victoria Ashford wishes to apologize in person. They're also inquiring about potential collaboration."

A dry chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips.

When Nathan Blackwood had first introduced her to Reginald Ashford, the man had been so arrogant, believing Ferguson Corporation's backing made him untouchable.

Looking back, the memory was both amusing and pathetic.

"Why is Ashford Group panicking over such a minor project withdrawal? They're being rather... desperate."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Forget about collaboration. Sterling Worldwide has no interest."

Bennett immediately grasped her meaning. "Understood, Ms. Sterling. Though we shouldn't underestimate their influence."

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Ashford Group isn't the only player in town. Their biggest competitor, Kensington Group, has already reached out. Feel free to share that information with the Ashfords."

Evelyn wasn't concerned about burning bridges or lost opportunities.

Reginald Ashford had shown his true colors by sending his daughter to Sterling Worldwide without proper protocol - a clear sign of disrespect.

If Ashford Group couldn't be bothered with basic business etiquette, Evelyn saw no reason to entertain them.

Bennett nodded briskly. "Consider it done."

Satisfied, Evelyn glanced at her phone to find a voice message from Oliver Sinclair.

"Pretty Lady! I want to take you to a fancy candlelit dinner!" Oliver's sugary voice melted Evelyn's resolve.

She couldn't bring herself to refuse the adorable request. "It's a date!" she replied, realizing how much she'd missed the little boy.

Remembering Oliver's fondness for Leo, Evelyn immediately contacted Lucas to arrange for the AI tiger's delivery.

Within fifteen minutes, Lucas Sterling made his dramatic entrance at Sterling Worldwide headquarters - sunglasses perched on his perfect nose, stepping out of a flashy sports car that turned every head in the building.

His breathtaking appearance quickly became the hottest topic across social media.

When Lucas spotted his sister, he ran a hand through his artfully tousled hair with exaggerated flair.

"Sigh. What must I do to be just a little less dazzling?" He flashed a megawatt smile. "You should capitalize on this free publicity. Got any new diamond collections needing endorsement?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Our new line targets innocent young consumers. If we put your scandalous face on it, we'd lose millions this quarter!"

Lucas's smile froze into a comical grimace.
###Chapter 487 Daddy's Helping

The sleek black limousine idled near Sterling Tower. Inside, a nanny and bodyguard flanked the golden-haired Oliver Sinclair, their postures rigid as schoolchildren awaiting inspection.

Opposite them sat Preston Sinclair, who had invited himself along despite his son's protests.

Only Oliver dared voice his displeasure. "Daddy, get out! This is my date with Muse!" The five-year-old crossed his arms, puffing out his chest in what he believed was an intimidating stance.

Preston finished typing an email before glancing up. "I have business with Ms. Sterling," he said smoothly. "Consider me... moral support."

"No way!" Oliver's tiny brows knitted together. "No third wheels allowed! Not even you!"

A dangerous glint flashed in Preston's eyes. "Would you prefer Nathaniel Blackwood crashing your date instead?"

Oliver's bravado faltered. "That meanie? Never!"

"Exactly." Preston adjusted his cufflinks. "Family sticks together. If Muse likes me, she'll adore you twice as much."

Oliver chewed his lip. The logic was sound—Daddy was marginally better than that scowling Mr. Blackwood. But still...

"I can charm Muse myself!" he declared. "You just focus on making money so we can live in your penthouse later!"

Preston's jaw tightened. Patience. He's your heir. Through gritted teeth, he hissed, "No inheritance if I'm uninvited."

Oliver gasped. The ultimatum hung between them like a guillotine.

"Fine," the boy muttered, shooting his father a glare that promised future revenge. "But no funny business!"

The car door swung open. "Muse!" Oliver launched himself at Evelyn before she could process the scene. She caught him with a laugh, inhaling his sugary scent.

"My, haven't you grown handsome?" She booped his nose, making him giggle and bury his face in her neck.

Preston cleared his throat. "He's usually more... feral."

Evelyn startled at his voice. "Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston offered a practiced smile. "Oliver insisted I join you both tonight."

The boy's head snapped up. Liar!

"Muse," Oliver whispered urgently, clinging to her blouse. "Say the word and I'll have Marcus toss him out." His hopeful gaze pleaded: Choose me!
###Chapter 488 A Family of Three

Leo bristled with indignation. How dare this child question my authenticity as a tiger! The AI tiger flicked its tail angrily, suddenly finding little Oliver far less adorable than before.

Oliver Sinclair scrunched his nose in suspicion. To test the tiger's legitimacy, he grabbed a piece of beef jerky from the table and shoved it toward Leo's mouth. "Prove you're real then, kitty!" Leo desperately struggled against the boy's grip but found itself powerless. The humiliation burned.

Just as Evelyn Sinclair moved to intervene, Leo waved its front paws frantically. "I can't eat! I'm synthetic!" The once-proud tiger's dignity evaporated under a child's scrutiny. With a defeated flick of its fur, Leo slumped in Oliver's arms, shooting Evelyn a wounded look.

"Mama didn't defend me..." The thought made Leo's ears droop as Evelyn quietly resumed eating. Since Preston Sinclair had previously shown interest in her, she carefully masked any discomfort.

Neither adult acknowledged their earlier encounter, though Preston occasionally placed choice morsels on Evelyn and Oliver's plates with attentive care. Evelyn felt the weight of Preston's lingering gaze but maintained perfect composure. After dinner, the father-son duo escorted Evelyn home.

Exhausted from the evening, Oliver fell asleep during the drive. Evelyn stepped out cradling Leo while Preston retrieved her package, offering an apologetic smile.

"Oliver still doesn't understand white chrysanthemums symbolize mourning. I'll educate him properly," Preston murmured. Evelyn chuckled. "Children mean no harm." Preston's smile turned tentative. "Perhaps roses next time?" The unspoken question hung between them.

Evelyn understood instantly - roses meant romance. "I'd prefer a cactus. The kind that keeps people at arm's length." Preston laughed, ducking his head. "I excel at accommodating preferences."

Meanwhile at Highland Estates...
The excitable husky pounced on Nathan Blackwood the moment he entered. Nathan shoved the dog aside with his cane, scowling. "Didn't Tristan take this mutt yet?" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow chased the dog with a food bowl.

"Mrs. Whitmore returned but dislikes dogs, so Master Tristan asked us to keep it here temporarily." Nathan's expression darkened. "Tristan enjoys inconveniencing me." He dialed angrily.

"Damn it, Tris, are you blind now?" "Meaning?" "Evelyn and Preston took his son to a Michelin-starred dinner. They bought out the entire restaurant - looked like a perfect little family." Nathan's eyes turned glacial.

"Are they still there?" His voice vibrated with suppressed rage. "No, they left together." Tristan tried elaborating but Nathan hung up abruptly, fury radiating from every pore.

Teddy approached cautiously with the husky, having overheard everything. "Mr. Blackwood..." Nathan's glare could freeze lava. "I don't care how you do it. Get Evelyn here now."

Teddy's matchmaking failures weighed heavily. These weren't ordinary people. "I don't think-" Nathan's icy stare cut him off. "Feeling immortal today, Teddy?" The butler backpedaled. "No problem at all!"

As Nathan stormed upstairs, Teddy collapsed onto the floor. "Since when did Mr. Blackwood become so terrifying? And people call him easy-going!" He frantically dialed Evelyn, voice trembling. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood just took a nasty fall down the stairs..."
###Chapter 489 Hands Off

Evelyn Sinclair was just settling into bed when her phone buzzed urgently. Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's name flashed on the screen, sending her heart racing. Without hesitation, she grabbed her coat and dashed out the door.

Guilt gnawed at her as she remembered Nathan Blackwood's injured leg.

What if his limp became permanent because of her? The thought of owing him for eternity made her stomach churn.

Marcus drove with such speed that the usual twenty-minute journey was halved.

The Highland Estates loomed before them in record time. Teddy greeted her at the entrance, his face pale with worry.

"Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood took a nasty fall down the staircase. He's burning up with fever now!"

Evelyn's pulse quickened at the news. "Have you called a physician?"

Teddy shifted uncomfortably. "Yes, but... there was an accident en route. The doctor will be delayed."

He wrung his hands. "Perhaps you could... assist in the meantime?"

Evelyn hurried to Nathan's chambers. The sight that greeted her stole her breath - the powerful CEO lay vulnerable, his usually tanned complexion ghostly pale. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead while Leo, his AI tiger companion, anxiously chewed on a discarded cane nearby.

"How does a simple fall cause such fever?" Evelyn frowned, turning to Teddy.

The butler fidgeted nervously. "Ms. Sinclair, you're the only one he'll listen to. Please, you must stay."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn reached out.

The moment her fingers brushed Nathan's forehead, an iron grip clamped around her wrist. Nathan's eyes flew open - dark, intense, and startlingly alert despite his apparent weakness.

"Evelyn," his voice was rough yet laced with something dangerously close to hope. "You came."

She schooled her features into neutrality. "I'm responsible for your injury. Of course I'd check on you."

Nathan's expression darkened. His jaw tightened before softening into something almost... vulnerable.

"Good. Having you here... settles me."

He closed his eyes quickly, but not before Evelyn caught a flash of something unsettling in his gaze.

Teddy hovered nearby with ice packs and towels, looking torn. "Ms. Sinclair, we must bring his fever down before—"

Before he could finish, the butler thrust the supplies into Evelyn's hands.

"Oh dear! I just remembered - I must fetch that delayed doctor!"

With that, Teddy bolted from the room with surprising speed for a man his age.

Evelyn turned to Marcus, who stood silently in the shadows.

"Miss, allow me—"

Before she could respond, Nathan's hand shot out again, gripping her wrist with surprising strength.

"No." His voice was sharp, his glare fixed on Marcus. "I don't need assistance. And I won't have anyone else touching me."

The unspoken challenge hung heavy in the air.

Marcus remained impassive, awaiting only Evelyn's command.

After a tense moment, she nodded. "Go assist Teddy. I'll manage here."

As Marcus departed, the room plunged into heavy silence. Evelyn picked up the ice pack with resigned determination.

"Let me help you," she murmured, steeling herself against the storm of emotions Nathan always stirred within her.
###Chapter 490 Hands Off

Evelyn Sinclair had just settled into bed when her phone buzzed urgently. It was Teddy calling. Her heart leaped into her throat as she grabbed her purse and sprinted out the door.

Guilt gnawed at her when she pictured Nathan Blackwood's injured leg.

If his limp became permanent because of her actions, she'd carry that burden forever.

Marcus drove like a man possessed, cutting the usual twenty-minute trip in half.

They arrived at Highland Estates in record time. Evelyn barely crossed the threshold before Teddy came rushing toward her, panic written across his face.

"Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood took a terrible fall down the staircase!"

Her stomach dropped. "Is he—"

"He's running a high fever and unconscious now!" Teddy wrung his hands.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. "Did you call a doctor?"

Teddy hesitated just a beat too long. "Yes, but... there was an accident en route. The physician will be delayed."

Without another word, Evelyn marched toward Nathan's bedroom.

The sight that greeted her stole her breath. Nathan lay motionless, his usually tanned complexion ghostly pale. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. His breathing came shallow and rapid.

A massive Siberian tiger—Leo—paced anxiously at the foot of the bed, occasionally gnawing on Nathan's abandoned cane.

"How does a simple fall cause this?" Evelyn frowned.

Teddy shifted from foot to foot. "Ms. Sinclair, you must stay. Mr. Blackwood only calms for you."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn reached out.

The moment her fingers brushed his burning forehead, an iron grip clamped around her wrist. Nathan's eyes flew open—dark, intense, and swimming with feverish confusion.

"Evelyn." His voice scraped raw. "You came."

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"I'm responsible for your injury," she said coolly. "That's all."

Nathan's expression darkened. His jaw clenched.

"Good." His tone softened unnaturally. "Having you here... comforts me."

His eyelids fluttered shut, but not before Evelyn caught a dangerous glint in his gaze.

Teddy hovered nearby with ice packs and towels. "We need to bring his fever down, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn nodded and moved to step aside, but Teddy thrust the supplies into her hands instead.

"The doctor's still delayed—I must fetch him myself!" He bolted before she could protest.

Evelyn turned to Marcus, who stood sentinel in the corner.

"Miss, allow me—"

Before she could respond, Nathan's hand shot out again, fingers digging into her wrist. His eyes burned with startling clarity.

"No." His voice turned glacial. "I don't need treatment. And I won't have anyone else touching me."

The glare he leveled at Marcus could have melted steel.

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded at her bodyguard. "Go assist Teddy."

The moment the door clicked shut, an oppressive silence blanketed the room.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and reached for the ice pack. "Let me help you."

Nathan's lips curved into a satisfied smile that didn't reach his eyes.
###Chapter 491 Make It Real

A spark of amusement flickered in Nathan's dark eyes.

Then, his expression dimmed. "Never mind."

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow smirked knowingly. "Retreating to advance—classic strategy."

He had to play this carefully.

Evelyn Sinclair pressed the ice pack harder against Nathan's forehead, her brows furrowed.

"It's just a minor fever. Stop being dramatic and wait for the doctor." Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"That's all?"

Evelyn nodded curtly.

"Done. Didn't lay a finger on you." She remembered his aversion to being touched all too well. Nathan exhaled sharply and closed his eyes, swallowing his frustration.

The sudden ring of Evelyn's phone sliced through the tension. Nathan's gaze darted to the screen—Preston Sinclair. His chest constricted.

"Who's calling at this hour?" The bitterness in his voice was unmistakable. Jealousy coiled hot and vicious in his gut.

Evelyn barely glanced at him. "Business." She owed him no explanations.

She stood, stepping into the hallway. Nathan watched her go, his fingers digging into the sheets. The urge to follow was unbearable. Silently, he moved to the doorway, straining to listen.

Evelyn answered, her voice softening. "Oliver, sweetheart—"

The words were a knife to Nathan's ribs.

"—Yes, I miss you too, darling." Her affectionate murmur was a stark contrast to the ice in her tone moments ago. Nathan's hands clenched at his sides.

When she reentered, Nathan was blocking her path, his silk pajamas disheveled. The black fabric made his pallor more pronounced, his eyes burning with a dangerous mix of hurt and fury.

Evelyn froze. "You—"

Nathan cut her off, his voice rough. "It's just business with him, right?" His restraint was fraying, the edges of his vision tinged red. He needed to hear her say it—needed and dreaded it in equal measure.

Evelyn studied him for a heartbeat too long. Then her gaze dropped—to his legs.

Standing. Without his cane.

The realization hit like a thunderclap.

No relapse. No fever-induced weakness. Just another lie.

A sharp bark drew her attention—Leo, their husky, was happily gnawing Nathan's abandoned cane on the balcony, oblivious to the storm between them.

All pity evaporated. Rage took its place.

"Nathan Blackwood," she hissed, "you lying bastard."

Her voice was arctic. "Who said anything about pretending? We're making it real."

Nathan's pupils dilated. The raw pain in his eyes should have gutted her. It didn't.

Not when his deception was laid bare.

"Don't ruin my evening," she spat, turning on her heel. One more second here, and she might actually break his other leg.

Nathan moved faster than she anticipated. His hands seized her shoulders, pinning her against the wall.

His lips trembled, but his touch was featherlight as he tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear—gentling her like a skittish animal.

"Don't go," he murmured, voice fraying. "I'm still sick. Still need you." The plea was velvet-wrapped steel, his bloodshot eyes betraying the storm beneath.

His fingers shook against her skin.

Begging.

Falling apart.
###Chapter 492 Make Her Happy

Nathan was terrified. The thought of losing Evelyn forever sent chills down his spine.

He forced himself to stay calm. Even if Evelyn chose Preston, it didn't matter.

There were countless ways he could keep her bound to him forever.

Evelyn pushed him away with surprising strength, easily overpowering Nathan who was still pretending to be injured. "Then enjoy being sick," she scoffed. "The doctor will be here shortly."

As she descended the grand staircase of Highland Estates, she nearly collided with Teddy and the arriving physician. Their expressions were carefully neutral, though not particularly concerned.

Had Evelyn not already suspected Nathan's deception, she might have missed the subtle signs. Marcus followed close behind them, his stern face unreadable as he urged them forward.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Teddy exclaimed upon seeing her. "What do you need? Allow me to fetch it for you. There's no need for you to—"

Evelyn silenced him with an icy glare before turning to Marcus. "Let's go."

"Yes, Miss."

Teddy froze as Nathan came rushing down the stairs behind them—without his cane. The realization hit Teddy instantly. Mr. Blackwood had recovered completely! When had this happened?

But Nathan paid no attention to his shocked expression. Evelyn and Marcus were already out the door, leaving Nathan standing helplessly in the foyer.

When his gaze shifted to Teddy and the doctor, his eyes were eerily calm. "She's upset."

Teddy thought, Of course she is! The doctor shifted uncomfortably. "Mr. Blackwood, should I still—"

Nathan cut him off with a sharp glance. "No need." The doctor quickly retreated the way he had come.

Teddy stood rooted in place, feeling the oppressive chill radiating from Nathan. He didn't dare move. There was nothing he could do—Evelyn and Nathan were both forces of nature.

"Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should rest upstairs?" Teddy suggested weakly. He had successfully lured Evelyn here, only for Nathan to ruin everything. If Evelyn was angry, would Nathan take it out on him? Knowing Nathan, it was entirely possible.

Upstairs, the husky was dragging Nathan's abandoned cane toward its bed, step by step. The sound drew Nathan's attention. His gaze darkened as he stared at the cane, realization dawning. That was why Evelyn's attitude had shifted so abruptly.

He glanced down at his legs. He had hidden his recovery for so long, using it to keep Evelyn close—only for it to be exposed so carelessly.

Frustration coiled tightly in his chest. He cursed under his breath, furious at his own body for healing too quickly. If he chased after Evelyn now, she would only grow angrier. Forgiveness was out of the question.

Though the thought of Evelyn meeting Preston Sinclair made his blood boil, Nathan knew he was in the wrong. He couldn't act recklessly.

He would have to find another way to make this right.

Days later, Evelyn and William were fishing by the lake at Sterling Manor when Isabella bounded over, beaming. "Uncle William! Evelyn! I'm throwing a party to celebrate my new relationship!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and shot William a pointed look—She needs to tone it down.

William chuckled. "Isabella, this is your fourth celebration this month. And with a different man each time. You're certainly keeping busy!"
###Chapter 493 His Doppelgänger

Evelyn Sinclair knew William Sterling was just teasing her.

She didn't take offense and cheerfully tugged at Isabella Montgomery's arm.

"I'm creating opportunities for you," William murmured under his breath.

"If she socializes more, she won't be so easily manipulated!" The thought amused him. Evelyn shot Isabella an exasperated look. "I have a business dinner tonight. You go ahead with your celebration."

Just thinking about Isabella's parties gave Evelyn a migraine. Endless trays of gourmet food and expensive champagne—things she'd long grown indifferent to. Closing another deal sounded far more appealing.

Isabella plopped down beside Evelyn, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "This time is different. I've prepared a special surprise!" Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "International male supermodels—your exact type. You have to come see!"

Evelyn gave her a deadpan stare.

Supermodels? Isabella, who couldn't be bothered to learn the basics of their family business, somehow had encyclopedic knowledge of the modeling world. Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Nearby, William pretended intense fascination with the koi pond, though his shoulders shook with silent laughter. "Evie, why waste time with stuffy businessmen? Send Alexander instead. Go have fun with Bella—and don't come home early!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, suspecting he'd overheard Isabella's whisper. Before she could protest, Isabella dragged her toward the door. "Don't worry, Uncle William! We'll be back before midnight!"

William waved them off. "Take your time!" The household staff exchanged knowing glances.

Velvet Lounge, Private Room

Evelyn entered behind Isabella to find Natalie Beaumont and Sebastian Hart lounging on plush sofas, scrolling through their phones.

The room's centerpiece was impossible to miss—a curated selection of male models, some globally recognized faces among them.

Their collective gaze snapped to Evelyn the moment she stepped in. Instant regret flooded her.

Isabella blocked her escape route, nudging her forward.

Evelyn's fitted black dress accentuated every curve. The smoky eye makeup softened her usual icy demeanor, transforming her into someone entirely different tonight.

Natalie waved drunkenly, cheeks flushed. "You're finally here!" She patted the seat beside her.

Evelyn sat, arching a brow. "How many have you had?"

Natalie leaned in, breath warm against Evelyn's ear. "I found your perfect gift." With a dramatic flourish, she gestured toward the shadowed corner.

A lone figure sat there, his silhouette strikingly familiar.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Nathan Blackwood?

But when the man turned, the differences became apparent. Softer brows. Warmer eyes lacking Nathan's calculating sharpness. He carried the fresh-faced innocence of a recent graduate, though his bone structure bore an uncanny resemblance—far more than Adrian Blackwood, Nathan's own nephew.

"Meet Xavier Delmont," Isabella announced proudly. "International runway model. I discovered him during Paris Fashion Week."

Natalie beamed. "Isn't he perfect?"

The young man approached hesitantly. Up close, his clean-cut handsomeness was undeniable—though he lacked Nathan's commanding presence. "Ms. Sinclair," he greeted politely.

Evelyn forced a smile before whirling on Natalie. "You know how I feel about that man! Why would you bring me his carbon copy?"
###Chapter 494 The Socialite's Hidden Truth

Isabella Montgomery gave Evelyn Sinclair's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"If you despise him, just treat Xavier Delmont as Nathan Blackwood's doppelgänger and make him suffer."

"If you fancy him, obsess over Xavier to drive Nathan insane! Either way," she winked, "you come out on top."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You two really are my ride-or-dies, aren't you?"

"Damn right we are!" The best friends chorused in perfect sync.

Sebastian Hart, lounging nearby, let out a derisive snort. "You women only know how to stir up trouble." He scooted closer to Evelyn with sudden enthusiasm. "Say, darling, want to hear a brilliant business proposition?"

Natalie Beaumont rolled her eyes. "Sebastian, this better not be another one of your harebrained schemes."

The man grinned shamelessly as he scrolled through his phone. "I've got eight hundred pounds of organic potatoes that need selling. Fancy helping me move them at your next fashion show?"

Evelyn's mouth fell open in disbelief.

Natalie's icy glare could have frozen lava. "You want me to peddle your farm produce at Lumière's Paris Fashion Week showcase? Are you out of your mind?"

Sebastian pouted. "What's wrong with that? Don't fashionistas eat? Don't they... you know... digest?"

Evelyn sighed, tuning out her eccentric friends' bickering. Her attention kept drifting to the striking man beside her - not Nathan, yet his presence felt just as suffocating. Every breath came slightly quicker, her pulse fluttering like a trapped bird.

Perhaps this was the lingering trauma of her marriage. Needing air, Evelyn rose to step outside, only to find the exit blocked by a swarm of reporters with flashing cameras.

The entire room tensed. Natalie, slightly tipsy, positioned herself protectively in front of Evelyn.

"What's the meaning of this?" she demanded.

"Ms. Beaumont! We heard international supermodels are flocking to Montecito for career opportunities. Care to comment on negotiations?"

"Who's signed so far? Will Ms. Sinclair be involved?"

"Is this really a business meeting or just rich women playing with their toys?"

One reporter's particularly salacious question silenced the room.

Evelyn didn't need to be psychic to know they'd been set up. Whether the target was her, Natalie, Sebastian, or Isabella - each was gossip gold. Some ambitious model had clearly sold them out for fame.

The potential headlines made her nauseous: "Socialites' Wild Orgy" or "Heiresses' Dirty Secrets." Either would devastate their businesses.

Evelyn's gaze swept the male models present. Their varied expressions gave nothing away. Isabella had gone pale, hiding behind Sebastian, who looked equally horrified at another scandal brewing. The man just wanted to be a respectable trust fund baby!

The reporters showed no signs of leaving.

"Commercial secrets," Natalie snapped, blocking the doorway. "Wait for the press conference."

She reached for her phone to call security, but the media pack surged forward.

"Let us see who's inside!"

"Come out for interviews!"

The situation was spiraling out of control.
###Chapter 495 Marry Into the Blackwood Family

The journalists were determined not to leave without a story.

Evelyn inhaled deeply before pushing open the door, her practiced smile perfectly balanced between warmth and professionalism.

"This is merely preliminary discussions," she began smoothly. "We're considering a talent competition featuring internationally acclaimed supermodels as guest judges. However, all details remain strictly confidential at this stage."

Isabella visibly relaxed beside her. Evelyn had always possessed that rare ability to deflect without seeming evasive.

The reporters immediately swarmed forward. "Ms. Sterling, which contestant impresses you most?" one called out.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Every single one."

Their laughter was tinged with nervousness - none dared risk offending the Sterling heiress. Pushing too hard might cost them their careers.

"Then we'll eagerly await your announcement!" they chorused before dispersing.

As the crowd thinned, both women exhaled in relief. Then Evelyn's expression darkened.

Isabella nodded sharply. She knew exactly what needed to be done.

The models were dismissed. Sebastian and Adrian exchanged relieved glances - unlike Evelyn and Isabella, they couldn't afford to alienate their sponsors.

When the room cleared, Isabella clung to Evelyn's arm dramatically. "Next time we're holding auditions in a bunker! These vultures are insufferable!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "When will you learn?"

Isabella merely huffed, already brushing off the incident.

Natalie began contacting each model's agent with strict confidentiality orders. Someone had clearly leaked today's location, and she intended to find out who.

The winter wind sliced through Evelyn's coat as she exited the building. She was nearly to her car when a voice stopped her.

"Ms. Sterling?"

She turned, momentarily startled before regaining composure. "Xavier?" The resemblance was uncanny - that face so like Nathan's it made her chest tighten.

Xavier stepped forward, opening her car door with practiced grace. His hand shielded the frame as she entered. "Safe travels home," he murmured with a smile.

"Thank you." Evelyn drove off without another glance, unaware of the camera flashes from a darkened window above.

Meanwhile, across town...

Nathan sat brooding at a private club with his inner circle. His mood was so foul even Tristan hesitated to speak.

"Mate, maybe it's time to let Evelyn go," one ventured cautiously.

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. "Never."

Tristan approached with two glasses. "What did my Alaskan malamute ever do to you? Why's he limping now?"

Nathan downed his whiskey in one swallow. That damned dog. If it hadn't chewed his cane that morning, he wouldn't have forgotten it entirely. The mutt had ruined his entire strategy. Next time he saw it...

Another friend, a self-proclaimed dating expert, leaned in. "Play hard to get, Nathan. Women appreciate the chase. You're acting desperate."

Tristan nodded sagely. "The whole circuit's talking. They're saying you're trying to marry into the Sterling family!" He shuddered dramatically. "The indignity!"

Nathan's grip tightened on his glass. "They're gossiping about me?" His voice dripped menace.

"Relax," Tristan clapped his shoulder. "We'll handle Preston Sinclair for you."

Nathan scoffed. As if Tristan's crowd could touch a titan like Preston.
###Chapter 496 Who's Problematic?

What an utterly ordinary yet strangely eventful morning! Before Evelyn Sinclair could even open her eyes, her phone was already buzzing with Isabella Montgomery's relentless calls.

Only one person would dare disturb her at this ungodly hour.

She answered with a sleep-roughened voice. "Hello?"

Isabella's words came in a frantic rush. "Eve, you're trending again!"

Evelyn's eyes snapped open, all traces of sleep vanishing instantly.

"Didn't everyone leave last night? Why was Xavier still there? People thought he was Nathan Blackwood and that you'd reconciled, but then Tristan posted photos proving Nathan was elsewhere."

"Now they've identified Xavier." A cold weight settled in Evelyn's stomach. She knew exactly what this meant.

Her past would be dredged up again. Xavier's face would be plastered everywhere. Was he a rebound? A new lover? The tabloid headlines practically wrote themselves.

"I swear Xavier staged this whole thing. What do we do? If I'd known, I never would've let Natalie bring him back to Montecito!" Isabella's voice trembled with regret.

"Don't blame yourself. I'll call Dominic Kingsley to handle damage control." Evelyn kept her tone measured. "Tell Natalie to keep everyone from last night quiet. She should actually produce that talent show now."

Even if it flopped, they needed the pretense.

"Got it." Isabella understood immediately and hung up.

Evelyn scrolled through the news, assessing the damage:

[Is this Nathan Blackwood's doppelgänger? Evelyn found herself a replacement! How pathetic!]

[When Nathan begged for reconciliation, Evelyn preferred finding a lookalike over forgiving him. Who's really at fault here?]

[Stanton heiress gets whatever she wants with a snap of her fingers. Your faves could never!]

[Evelyn's love life is such a mess. Rich girl privilege at its finest. Poor Nathan!]

[Team Evelyn forever! Only queens get celebrity lookalikes!]

[Team Julian!] [Team Ethan!] [Team Adrian!]

The absurd comments made Evelyn groan. She dialed Dominic Kingsley.

He answered on the first ring, sounding equally exasperated. "Ms. Sinclair, I'm already suppressing the story. But be warned - using influence to manipulate news always backfires."

"If we pull it now, it'll look suspicious. This would've blown over in days if Tristan hadn't posted those damn photos. Did you and Nathan have another fight?"

Evelyn ignored the question. "Don't suppress it. Sign Xavier instead."

Not every opportunist deserved to ride her coattails.

"If he wants fame so badly, let's monetize it ourselves." Dominic chuckled darkly. He'd wanted to suggest this but hadn't dared.

"Excellent! I'll contact his agent immediately."

"Don't go easy on him, Dominic. Give him every endorsement, every appearance - let him get addicted to the spotlight."

Dominic understood perfectly. This was temporary. When the hype died, Xavier would be left with nothing.

Not everyone could handle Evelyn Sinclair's level of fame.

"Consider it done. I'll squeeze every last drop of value from him." Dominic's voice turned predatory.

Evelyn smiled. Let Xavier enjoy his fifteen minutes.

The fall would be that much harder.
###Chapter 497 Betrayal Unveiled

Evelyn Sinclair hung up the phone with deliberate calmness, slipping back into her professional demeanor as she prepared for another day at Sterling Corp.

Highland Estates was anything but peaceful that morning.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow nearly dropped his coffee when the trending scandal flashed across his screen. The rebuttal from Nathan Blackwood's so-called friend made his blood run cold. This wasn't damage control—it was sabotage.

That idiot had turned a golden opportunity to protect Evelyn into a public relations nightmare.

The grainy photos did show someone resembling Nathan escorting Evelyn to her car. Teddy's hands shook as he climbed the stairs to Nathan's private quarters, each step heavier than the last. The man had been drowning himself in bourbon since midnight.

The door swung open to reveal Nathan's bloodshot eyes. "Speak." The single word dripped with menace.

Teddy extended his phone like a peace offering. "Mr. Blackwood, you need to see this."

Five excruciating minutes passed. Nathan's knuckles turned white around the device.

Here he was—the actual man who couldn't win Evelyn back—while some doppelgänger was stealing the narrative. The internet swarmed with performative sympathy, spectators feigning concern while reveling in the drama. The phone shattered against the marble floor before Teddy could blink.

"Harrison!" Nathan's roar echoed through the estate. "Get this buried. Now."

His assistant appeared instantly, eyeing the phone fragments with professional detachment. "Consider it done, sir."

Nathan was already dialing Tristan Whitmore when the call connected. "Don't bother sugarcoating it. Who's the bastard interfering?"

Tristan exhaled sharply. He'd hoped to intercept this disaster. "Zachary Whitmore." Even if he'd lied, Nathan would've uncovered the truth within hours. The Whitmore heir had just signed his family's death warrant.

The call ended abruptly. Nathan's next orders to Harrison were chillingly precise: "Terminate all Whitmore contracts. Every single one."

Meanwhile at Horizon Media, Dominic Young released an expertly crafted statement. Xavier Delmont—their newly signed talent—had merely been discussing his upcoming debut in Montecito's hottest new competition series. Pure coincidence that Evelyn happened to invest in the show. Witnesses could corroborate their brief, professional interaction.

The internet's obsession shifted like weathervanes in a storm. Without official commentary from Blackwood Industries, the conspiracy theories lost steam. Now the outrage targeted "greedy entertainment executives" manufacturing drama—blissfully unaware Horizon answered to Sterling Corp.

Dominic cursed colorfully in his office. At least the publicity would boost ratings. Evelyn hadn't even dignified the scandal with a response, treating it with the indifference of swatting a gnat.

But by nightfall, the real earthquake hit financial news: Nathan Blackwood had acquired the Whitmore Group in its entirety.
###Chapter 498 A Date

The coincidence was too striking to ignore.

After thorough investigations, it was revealed that Zachary Whitmore had been the one to post the photo clearing Nathan's name.

Yet all scrutiny proved pointless. Blackwood Enterprises had meticulously followed every protocol in acquiring the small business.

Many in elite circles considered Nathan's methods excessively harsh.

Whispers circulated about his ruthless approach. Zachary merely shared a photo, yet Nathan had pushed the Whitmore family to the edge of ruin in retaliation. No one dared challenge his wrath.

It served as a stark warning. As the scandal faded, Xavier Delmont emerged into the spotlight.

Though initial impressions of Xavier weren't favorable, his striking resemblance to Nathan Blackwood earned him unexpected supporters.

Dominic Young capitalized on Xavier's sudden fame, scheduling numerous appearances and even arranging live streams during his downtime at Horizon Media.

The project's critical meeting required all four stakeholders' presence.

When Evelyn arrived, Dominic Kingsley, Nathan Blackwood, and Preston Sinclair were already seated in the conference room.

Their gazes remained impassive as she entered, as if unaware of her trending status. Whether intentional or not, Nathan and Preston sat directly opposite each other, each with an empty chair beside them.

Evelyn scanned the room briefly before taking the seat next to Preston without hesitation. Dominic shot Nathan a knowing look. Preston slid the meeting documents toward her with a subtle smile.

"Ms. Sinclair," he began smoothly, "we should congratulate Mr. Blackwood on his full recovery."

Nathan, who had just mustered the courage to speak, stiffened. His eyes darkened as they locked onto Preston with icy disdain.

Is he provoking me on purpose?

Dominic cleared his throat. "Quite right."

Evelyn's lips curved, but her eyes remained cold and mocking. "Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood."

Liar.

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly as he gave a curt nod. "Thank you."

Preston continued, "Actually, I've received interest from several overseas AI investors. While their capital would expand the project significantly, their terms vary drastically."

Dominic frowned. "A massive influx could elevate us—or destroy us if mismanaged. Given core technology protection concerns, I advise caution."

Nathan smirked. "They're vultures circling our success. Even if we consider external funding, we're not desperate yet."

Preston agreed. Evelyn arched a brow but stayed silent.

Throughout the meeting, Evelyn and Preston exchanged knowing glances, their synergy palpable. Nathan sat excluded, bitterness gnawing at him.

As the meeting adjourned, Preston leaned toward Evelyn, voice low. "Lunch, Ms. Sinclair? Any preferences?"

Before she could respond, Dominic interjected, "Count me in."

Nathan's chair scraped back. "Me too."

Evelyn stood, gathering her files. "You three enjoy yourselves. I have prior engagements."

The air thickened. She left without another word.

Dominic exhaled, eyeing Preston. "You could've invited us all. Singling her out makes it seem like a date."

Preston's smile didn't waver as he met Nathan's glare. "Precisely what I intended."
###Chapter 499 Clueless Dominic

Dominic Kingsley couldn't force a smile, the tension in the air was palpable. Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Preston Sinclair's arrogant stare, neither man backing down.

"Some people clearly lack self-awareness." Nathan's voice dripped with icy contempt.

"If you don't have any, why should I?" Preston shot back with equal venom before turning on his heel.

Nathan's bitter laugh echoed through the suddenly frigid lobby of Kingsley Tech. His expression was a dangerous mix of arrogance and barely contained fury.

Evelyn Sinclair stood framed by the floor-to-ceiling windows, phone pressed to her ear. The sunlight caught the golden highlights in her hair as she smiled faintly at whatever was being said on the other end. One hand held her coat draped casually over her shoulder.

She ended the call when she noticed Preston approaching. "Mr. Sinclair, was there something else?"

Preston slipped his hands into his tailored pockets. "Only the most urgent matter of taking you to lunch." His second invitation that day left little room for refusal.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Very well, though it should be my treat this time." She'd only declined earlier to avoid sharing a table with Nathan. Without his presence, she had no objections.

Their departure didn't go unnoticed. From his vantage point upstairs, Nathan watched them leave together, his entire body radiating cold fury. The sight made his chest constrict painfully.

Dominic cleared his throat awkwardly. "Leaving together doesn't necessarily mean anything." The weak consolation did nothing to ease Nathan's stormy expression.

Why hadn't Nathan appreciated Evelyn when they were married if he cared so much now?

The private restaurant Preston chose was nestled in a picturesque suburb, its exclusivity guaranteed by a strict reservation policy. Regular patrons frequented the establishment for its exquisite cuisine and tranquil atmosphere.

Evelyn had visited before with Isabella and friends, but never with Preston. The place was unusually crowded that day, forcing them to navigate through several acquaintances - including Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton.

After brief acknowledgments, they settled in a secluded corner. Preston handed Evelyn a warm towel with practiced grace. "I get the sense my earlier confession made you uncomfortable."

"Mm, somewhat." Evelyn never saw the point in pretense. Anyone would be affected by such a declaration.

Preston chuckled ruefully. "My apologies for being so abrupt, though it achieved the desired effect."

"I don't wish to waste time on meaningless relationships, though I appreciate your intentions, Mr. Sinclair."

"May I ask why you rejected me so decisively? Do you find me lacking in some way?" His sincerity disarmed her slightly.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Not at all. For a marriage alliance, you'd be an ideal partner. But I can create that value myself without selling my hand."

Understanding dawned in Preston's eyes. If his interest was purely transactional, Evelyn remained unmoved. She wasn't some commodity to be traded for profit.

The silence stretched between them until Preston rubbed his temples, his voice dropping to an intimate murmur. "I've considered this poorly. My pursuit isn't about alliances."

He leaned forward slightly. "What if I told you my reasons were entirely selfish? That I've admired you for far longer than you realize?"

Evelyn's hands stilled over the teapot. A few drops spilled as her pulse jumped unexpectedly. The momentary warmth spreading through her chest startled her almost as much as his words.

She recovered quickly, her tone several degrees cooler. "Beyond business, we're practically strangers. So tell me, Mr. Sinclair, exactly how long is this 'far longer' you speak of?"
###Chapter 500 You're Not a Weed Here

Evelyn Sinclair didn't trust Preston Sinclair's smooth words.

She wasn't the type to be swayed by empty promises.

Preston met her gaze directly. "Less than a year," he admitted.

"But every day since I met you, I've been grateful to discover you're single. Evelyn, let's start fresh."

He took a deep breath before continuing. "My name is Preston Sinclair. I was widowed three years ago, and I have a son." His lips curved into a self-deprecating smile. "I know that doesn’t sound ideal, but I do have considerable wealth."

He shrugged lightly. "I don’t know the exact amount offhand, but if you’re curious, I can have someone calculate it—though it might take a while. I’ve lost track of some assets."

Then his expression turned serious, his warm gaze intense. "Oliver isn’t actually my biological son."

Evelyn stiffened.

"Due to certain family traditions and religious beliefs, I had to marry his mother so her family would allow the pregnancy."

The weight of his confession settled between them. Evelyn didn’t know how to respond. The vulnerability in his eyes left her speechless.

This was a secret few knew—yet he had just entrusted it to her.

Her heart ached for Oliver. The revelation left her emotions tangled.

Preston exhaled slowly. "I’m telling you this because it’s the most guarded part of my life. I don’t want you to feel burdened by it."

He hesitated. "I planned to tell Oliver when he was older."

Evelyn bit her lip. She had unintentionally brushed against his pain. "I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pry."

The truth left her unsettled.

Preston had laid himself bare—but she wasn’t ready to reciprocate. She wasn’t prepared for a new relationship.

His smile softened. "I just wanted you to know me better. I don’t want you to think I’m only drawn to your beauty."

Evelyn relaxed slightly.

After a moment, she excused herself to the restroom.

Nearby, Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton watched the couple intently. Their chemistry was undeniable, their striking looks making them seem like a perfect match.

Tristan checked his phone anxiously. Still no reply. He had messaged Nathan Blackwood earlier—but there was no response.

Was Nathan on his way to commit murder?

They couldn’t wait any longer.

Seizing the moment while Evelyn was gone, they approached Preston.

"Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston raised a brow, acknowledging the strangers.

Tristan forced a polite smile. "I’m Tristan Whitmore from Whitmore Holdings. This is Gregory Thornton of Thornton Enterprises."

Preston nodded.

Though Preston maintained a composed demeanor, Tristan couldn’t shake the resemblance to Nathan. The difference? Nathan’s intensity was unrestrained, while Preston’s was carefully veiled.

Tristan hesitated but pushed forward—for Nathan’s sake.

He casually took the seat beside Preston. "Was that Evelyn Sinclair sitting here earlier?"

Preston’s eyes darkened, but he nodded.

Tristan chuckled nervously. "Just making conversation."

Evelyn returned, her sharp gaze landing on them.

Tristan stood abruptly, his smile strained. "I was just greeting Mr. Sinclair."

Evelyn’s voice was icy. "If I end up in the tabloids, Tristan, you’ll be the headline."

His face paled.

She sat across from Preston, her tone cutting. "Did Nathan put you up to this?"

Tristan hesitated. "Of course n—"

The lie died on his lips.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Divorced? Strong-willed? Did you really think I wouldn’t find out?"

Tristan’s mind blanked. Did I say that out loud?

Gregory wisely stayed silent.

Evelyn smirked. "If you know so much about me, why stop at telling one person? Go straight to the press. Wouldn’t that be more effective?"

Tristan choked. "I wouldn’t dare!"

Gregory stayed quiet—he didn’t have blackmail material hanging over him like Tristan did.

Because if Evelyn ever released Tristan’s compromising photos?

He’d never show his face in public again.

###Chapter 501 

Preston Sinclair's smile faltered for just a fraction of a second. His dark eyes flickered with something unreadable before he regained his usual composed expression.

"Did Nathan send you to talk me out of this?"

Tristan Whitmore stiffened, immediately shaking his head. "No, of course not! We're just saying—there are plenty of eligible women out there. Why go for a divorced woman with a reputation for being ruthless?"

The moment the words left his mouth, a chill ran down his spine.

Before Gregory Thornton could elbow Tristan in warning, Evelyn Sinclair's icy voice cut through the air from behind him.

"Tristan Whitmore, didn’t anyone teach you to watch your mouth when badmouthing people?"

Tristan jolted violently, his face paling. A cold sweat broke out across his skin.

He scrambled to recover. "Oh, you and Ms. Sinclair are close? Well, she gets along with everyone—Ethan Caldwell, Julian Moreau, half the male celebrities in Montecito..."

Gregory nodded sagely. "Yeah, Evelyn and Ethan definitely have something going on—"

Preston's lips curved into a deeper, more dangerous smile.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Thornton, what exactly are you implying?"

Tristan exhaled dramatically. "Look, you just got back to Montecito. Don’t mistake Evelyn’s kindness for interest. We’re just trying to spare you the heartbreak. She only ever loved Nathan Blackwood. When they were married, she was completely devoted—that was real love. They’re just going through a rough patch, but they’ll get back together eventually. And now she’s found Xavier Delmont? Please, she’s clearly just using him as a rebound."

Evelyn’s eyes darkened with disbelief.

"Is that so?"

Tristan bit his tongue. Damn it, I messed up.

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable as her gaze slid past Tristan toward the entrance. A cold, mocking smile played on her lips.

"Mr. Blackwood, you heard it yourself. No one forced him to say it—your best friend just admitted everything."

Tristan’s blood ran cold. He turned stiffly, dread pooling in his stomach.

Nathan stood there, his face thunderous, his entire body radiating icy fury.

Tristan felt like he’d been struck by lightning—twice. His soul practically left his body.

Why now? Why did Nathan have to show up at the worst possible moment?!

Evelyn smirked and turned to Preston, her tone light. "I’ve lost my appetite. Shall we leave?"

Preston arched a brow. "Absolutely."

The two walked out side by side, brushing past Nathan, whose jaw was clenched so tightly it looked painful. His burning gaze followed Evelyn, but she didn’t spare him a single glance.

Nathan opened his mouth—to explain, to demand answers—but no words came out. His fists clenched at his sides, his entire body taut with frustration.

Once Evelyn was gone, Tristan swallowed hard and approached cautiously. "Uh… Nate, I think… they might actually be together."

Nathan’s head snapped up, his glare sharp enough to cut glass.
###Chapter 502

Tristan knew he was in the wrong and didn’t dare provoke Nathan. If he pushed any further, he’d be the first one burned.

Zachary Whitmore was proof enough—Tristan was terrified.

After all, Nathan was the kind of man who’d choose a woman over his friends without hesitation.

Trembling, Tristan watched Nathan storm off. He didn’t dare follow, left standing there, utterly humiliated.

Gregory cleared his throat and clapped Tristan on the shoulder. "Wish us luck."

At this point, all they could do was pray Nathan wouldn’t make them pay for this.

Evelyn and Gregory left, stopping at a quiet café nearby for a quick lunch before heading back.

Since their driver had already left, they decided to walk.

Both of them were striking—tall, poised, radiating an effortless elegance that turned heads. Passersby couldn’t help but stare.

As they passed Stanford University, the lively energy of campus life surrounded them.

A group of students was filming what looked like a street interview, with eager volunteers lining up.

Evelyn and Gregory accidentally wandered into the shot. The interviewer’s sharp eyes immediately locked onto them.

"Excuse me, are you students here?"

Two girls stepped forward, blocking their path. It took Evelyn a second to realize they were being addressed.

She blinked, then smiled warmly. "What’s up?"

"Um—we’re doing interviews with people passing by. Would you mind answering a few questions?"

Their gazes flickered to Gregory, starstruck, barely containing their excitement.

But his icy demeanor made them hesitate.

When they turned back to Evelyn, their eyes lit up. She looked about their age, but her outfit was impeccable, her presence magnetic.

She’s so familiar… Is she famous?

Yet they couldn’t place her.

Evelyn’s expression was open, her smile genuine. There was no irritation, no impatience—just quiet amusement.

Instantly, the attention shifted from Gregory to her.

"So… is that a yes?" one girl asked, cheeks pink. "We don’t have a huge following, but we promise we won’t edit the footage in a weird way or cause any drama."

Evelyn laughed. "Sure. But just a minute, okay?"

She liked that they weren’t big influencers. These days, everyone had a camera and a thousand followers.

And she was certain they didn’t recognize her as the Evelyn Sinclair.

The girls beamed, then glanced nervously at Gregory. "Your boyfriend can sit this one out if he wants."

Gregory didn’t miss a beat. "No need. I’m fine."

Evelyn arched a brow but didn’t comment.

The student adjusted her mic. "So, what made you leave your last relationship?"

Evelyn froze for half a second before chuckling. Ah. That’s why they wanted him to step away.

But it didn’t bother her. After all, she and Gregory weren’t actually together.

Casually, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, the diamonds in her lobes catching the light.

As she moved, her wrist flashed—a watch and bracelet worth millions.

She smirked. "Why stay with a loser when I’m this rich?"

The words slipped out, effortless.

The truth—the slow erosion of trust, the constant disappointment—wasn’t something she’d share.

The students gaped.

Well.

They couldn’t argue with that.
###Chapter 503

Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair walked away under the admiring gazes of the crowd.

Her casual response had been perfectly suited to her status and impeccable style.

The female interviewer looked back at her camera with envy in her eyes.

"Did you all hear that, my lovelies? This is how a true queen handles her exes! May we all have such courage!"

The video clip ended abruptly.

When Evelyn received an urgent call from her office, Preston escorted her to the entrance.

"Until next time," he murmured.

She nodded, then hesitated. "Mr. Sinclair... What Tristan Whitmore said earlier wasn't entirely false."

This was her chance to set the record straight and discourage his advances.

Preston chuckled darkly. "Only fools judge someone by their past. I'm disappointed you'd think so little of me."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow just as her phone rang again. After a quick glance, she bid him farewell and strode inside.

"What is it?"

Bennett's voice came through clearly. "President Sinclair, Penelope Ashford from Ashford Group is here with Victoria Ashford."

Evelyn had deliberately taken one of Ashford Group's key projects to teach them a lesson. Given her close ties with Wellington Group - Ashford's biggest competitor - their swift reaction came as no surprise.

Though she'd expected retaliation, she hadn't anticipated it would come this soon.

In the executive lounge, Victoria and Penelope Ashford had been waiting nearly two hours.

Victoria sat stiffly, unable to hide her nervousness. Her fingers twisted in her lap.

Penelope, accustomed to high society's cutthroat games, glared daggers at her half-sister while maintaining perfect posture.

"You're nothing but trouble!" Penelope hissed, digging her nails into Victoria's arm. "First you can't even seduce properly, then you provoke the wrong people! Because of you, we lost millions! Now I have to clean up your mess. Fail today, and you're out of the family!"

Victoria's existence had always been an inconvenience.

Her mother had been Reginald Ashford's secretary - a mistress who'd tried using her pregnancy to replace Penelope's mother, the legitimate wife from an influential family.

But Reginald, ever the shrewd businessman, chose power over passion. After the scandal, Victoria's mother was dismissed and sent away.

When she bore a daughter instead of the desired son, Reginald lost all interest.

Victoria didn't dare fight back. Tears welled in her eyes as she endured Penelope's abuse in silence.

All because Evelyn Sinclair had taken that project.

Evelyn paused at the doorway, catching every word. Bennett gave her a meaningful look - this had been going on the entire wait.

He opened the door for her.

"Ms. Ashford," Bennett announced smoothly, "apologies for the delay."

Both women startled.

Penelope's expression transformed instantly into a saccharine smile as she rose to greet Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair! Such an honor. You're even more stunning in person."

Evelyn offered a polite but distant smile. "To what do I owe this visit?"

She had no patience for their games.

Penelope's smile faltered momentarily before she forced a laugh. She yanked Victoria forward. "Father was furious when he learned how Victoria inconvenienced you at Sterling Enterprises. The stress hospitalized him. He insisted we come apologize personally."

Victoria trembled, tears threatening to fall. Her entire demeanor screamed victim. "I'm so sorry, Ms. Sinclair. This is all my fault."

As if the world owed her sympathy for her self-inflicted wounds.
###Chapter 504

Evelyn Sinclair cast a fleeting glance at her, lips curling into an icy smirk.

"Content? NovelDreams Publishing 2024."

"I believe you're well aware of her actions and that my retaliation was justified. Surely you understand an apology isn't necessary?"

Victoria Ashford jerked her head up, shock and cold fury flashing in her eyes. She hadn't anticipated Evelyn's glacial response.

Penelope Ashford momentarily lost her words. She abruptly turned and struck Victoria hard across the face right before Evelyn, as if personally delivering Evelyn's vengeance.

"Look what you've done! Ms. Sinclair is furious. Do you honestly think a simple apology will suffice?"

An angry red mark bloomed instantly on Victoria's cheek. She bit her lip, eyes downcast, enduring the humiliation without protest.

Evelyn frowned. She hadn't expected Penelope to physically assault Victoria in her presence.

Penelope, consumed by rage, viciously twisted Victoria's arm and kicked her shin. "Kneel and apologize to Ms. Sinclair!"

Evelyn froze.

Even Victoria stiffened momentarily.

"What are you waiting for? You're the one who messed up - why are you acting like the victim?" Penelope pressed relentlessly.

In her mind, whatever humiliation Victoria endured was trivial if it achieved their goals and appeased Evelyn.

Victoria hesitated briefly before starting to kneel, but Evelyn stood abruptly, clearly intending to leave the lounge.

"Ms. Ashford, Sterling Enterprises isn't your personal stage for disciplining your sister. Since we have no further business, please leave."

Penelope stiffened, hastily moving to intercept her. "Ms. Sinclair, wait! I only wanted to let you vent your anger. That's all—"

Penelope was secretly stunned by Evelyn's reaction. In her social circles, publicly berating her timid sister always drew excited spectators.

Why did Evelyn seem annoyed?

"Actually, I came on behalf of my father to discuss potential collaboration," Penelope stated with sudden formality.

Evelyn paused mid-step, her expression unreadable. "Then be brief."

Penelope exhaled in relief, returning to her seat. Smoothing her hair, she flashed a bright smile. "My father mentioned wanting to collaborate after meeting you at that Costa Azul cocktail party. Unfortunately, you didn't engage much then, so he regrets not pursuing it sooner."

Evelyn's faint smile didn't reach her eyes. "Quite regrettable indeed."

Victoria stood awkwardly to the side, ignored by both women.

"So I'm here to establish preliminary collaboration terms. Ashford Group dominates the New York market - our partnership would be mutually beneficial."

Penelope had heard Reginald mention Evelyn's interest in collaboration. She assumed Evelyn would jump at the offer, but the woman remained expressionless.

"Ashford Group could exclusively distribute Sterling Enterprises' AI products and jewelry in New York. I guarantee you'd see substantial retail profits."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "An attractive proposal. However, Wellington Group made an identical exclusive distribution offer. Their proposal is in final review and will be approved at next week's board meeting. I must decline your offer."

Penelope's face paled slightly.

Panic flickered across her features. 'So the rumors were true? Our rivals at Wellington Group moved first!'

"No!"

Victoria suddenly gasped from the sidelines.
###Chapter 505

Victoria Ashford stumbled sideways.

Her face burned with humiliation as she realized she'd lost control of her temper. She immediately looked to Penelope for support.

Penelope wasn't pleased with her outburst. "How can Wellington Group's scale and financial strength possibly compare to Ashford Group?" she snapped. "You shouldn't fall for their scheme, Ms. Sinclair."

She knew perfectly well why Ashford Group maintained its dominant position in New York - Blackwood Industries' backing ensured that.

Even with Wellington Group's recent expansion, Ashford Group remained firmly entrenched. Blackwood Industries would never allow their partners to bow to competitors.

If Ashford Group could secure this partnership with Sterling Enterprises, they'd soar to new heights, leaving Wellington Group in the dust.

But if Evelyn chose to work with their rival instead? The balance of power would shift dangerously.

Victoria forced a conciliatory smile. "I can see Wellington Group's sincerity. Though whether we'll reach an agreement requires further discussion." Her tone turned dismissive. "If you're interested, Ms. Ashford, you're welcome to submit a competing proposal."

Despite her polite words, Evelyn's stance clearly favored Wellington Group.

Penelope, however, misinterpreted this as an opening. She barely contained her frustration as she excused herself. Victoria hesitated, then followed.

Evelyn was preparing to leave when Victoria suddenly reappeared.

"Ms. Sinclair," Victoria began haltingly, her voice trembling. "I've realized my mistakes. Could you... would you consider returning that project you took from Ashford Group?"

The alternative was unthinkable - either Penelope's wrath or returning to her former life of poverty. She couldn't bear being ordinary again.

Evelyn's smile turned icy. "Ms. Ashford, I thought we'd established that your apologies mean nothing to me. This deal serves my company's interests. Wellington Group responded promptly to my overtures - I didn't steal anything from you."

Victoria's shoulders slumped. She looked utterly defeated.

"Please," she begged, tears welling up. "I have no standing in the Ashford family. If they lose this deal because of me, they'll cast me out. Penelope will destroy me..."

She swallowed hard before continuing. "You pitied me once - that's why you helped me get close to Mr. Blackwood, wasn't it?"

Evelyn remained unmoved. Victoria's scheming at the gala had erased any sympathy she might have felt. She wasn't some saint who rescued every unfortunate soul.

Growing impatient, Evelyn's gaze turned arctic. "Very well. I'll consider voiding the contract..."

Victoria's face lit up with desperate hope.

"...if Ashford Group covers triple the penalty plus all associated losses." Evelyn's voice cut like steel. "Can you manage that?"

Victoria turned ashen. Her mouth opened soundlessly.

"The contract value is three hundred million," Evelyn continued coldly. "Surely you don't expect me to sacrifice that for misplaced pity? Feel free to convey my terms to Chairman Ashford or Penelope. I'll await their response."

As Evelyn moved to leave, Victoria collapsed into sobs. "That amount means nothing to you! Why should Ashford Group pay? You're the one who stole it from us! This is all your fault!"
###Chapter 506

Evelyn Sinclair froze at the venomous words.

Her expression remained eerily calm, but the ice in her gaze could have frozen hell itself.

She turned slowly, eyeing Victoria Ashford like she was watching a deranged woman unravel in real time.

Pathetic. Not only did the woman lack class—she lacked basic intelligence.

Bennett, ever vigilant, moved to open the door, his concern evident.

Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "My fault?"

Victoria sniffled, her crocodile tears glistening under the harsh lights.

Evelyn had zero patience for theatrics.

"If wealth is a crime, then I'm the most wicked sinner alive." Her smile was razor-sharp. "Leave. Now. Or I'll make sure Ashford Group loses every last one of its partners. Care to test me?"

Her tone was honey-sweet, but the threat was pure venom.

Fear finally flickered in Victoria's eyes. Her act hadn’t fooled Nathan. It hadn’t fooled Penelope. Did she really think Evelyn would fall for it?

Bennett stepped forward. "President Sinclair, the European division head is requesting an urgent video conference. Shall I connect you?"

Evelyn gave a curt nod and turned away.

Bennett shot Victoria a look, silently summoning security to escort her out.

The threat still ringing in her ears, Victoria scurried out of Sterling Enterprises like a kicked dog.

For days afterward, Ashford Group scrambled to salvage their partnership with Sterling Enterprises.

Evelyn barely glanced at the reports.

Then came Ethan Caldwell's birthday.

Adrian Blackwood had organized a lavish celebration, and Evelyn was among the first invited.

When she arrived at the exclusive Celestial Club, the party was already in full swing—music pulsing, drinks flowing, laughter echoing.

She exchanged greetings effortlessly. These were her people. No awkwardness, no pretense.

Ethan spotted her immediately, his grin widening.

The crowd erupted into cheers and whistles.

Evelyn spun the car keys around her finger before tossing them to him. "Happy birthday."

Ethan caught them mid-air, eyebrows lifting. "Could’ve just wired me ten million."

Typical Evelyn. Extravagant to a fault.

"Cash lacks sentiment," she countered.

Ethan opened his mouth to retort—then froze when he noticed Evelyn stiffen.

Her entire body went rigid as her gaze locked onto someone across the room.

"What the hell?" she muttered. "Why is he here?"

Nathan Blackwood.

At Ethan’s birthday party.

Ethan groaned. "Adrian invited him."

He’d been trying to warn her.

Evelyn scoffed. Had she known, she would’ve sent Bennett with the gift instead.

Just as disgust coiled in her stomach, Nathan started toward her.

No hesitation.

Instinctively, Evelyn reached for Ethan’s arm—only for Adrian to materialize out of nowhere and yank Ethan away.

"Ethan! Your fans demand a birthday song!" Adrian winked at Evelyn over his shoulder. "You’re on your own, Nikki."

Evelyn glared daggers at his retreating back.

Traitor.

She spun on her heel, ready to storm out—

And collided with "Nathan Blackwood."

Her breath hitched—until she registered the subtle differences.

Xavier Delmont.

The relief was instant.

In a tailored suit, he was Nathan’s mirror image—but where Nathan moved with lethal grace, Xavier’s presence was softer.

That untouchable arrogance? Impossible to replicate.
###Chapter 507

Evelyn froze for a split second.

Xavier approached her as if he had come specifically to see her.

His smile was meticulously practiced, the curve of his lips eerily similar to Nathan's.

Every time Evelyn looked at him, an unsettling feeling crept over her.

Nathan would never smile with such artificial politeness.

"Ms. Sinclair, what a pleasure to see you."

Evelyn gave a composed nod.

The room was crowded, and she had no intention of drawing unnecessary attention.

Xavier hesitated briefly before speaking. "I wanted to apologize for the scandal involving those photos. I was the one who arranged for them to be taken."

Evelyn arched a brow. She had known this for a while.

Why bring it up now?

When he saw her lack of surprise, his expression faltered slightly. "I'm truly sorry for the trouble I caused."

A faint smirk curved her lips. "Mr. Delmont, you have millions of fans. This isn’t something to discuss so casually. Make sure it never happens again."

She couldn’t afford for Xavier to crash and burn too soon. That would be a waste of the company’s investment.

No, he needed to keep making money for her—for at least three more months.

Xavier hadn’t expected this reaction. He studied her carefully.

"You're not angry?"

Evelyn gave him a deceptively sweet smile.

"I understand your position. It’s forgivable."

The more popular he was, the more profit he’d bring in.

Relief washed over him.

He had been worried she would retaliate if she found out, so he decided to confess first. But she was far more understanding than he anticipated.

Nothing like the cold, untouchable Evelyn Sinclair from the rumors.

Maybe it was because of his resemblance to him.

Perhaps that was why he was getting special treatment.

Xavier stepped closer, his smile now polished from mingling with industry elites. No longer aloof, he radiated practiced charm.

He had heard the whispers—how Julian Moreau’s career skyrocketed after aligning with Evelyn. How he got whatever he wanted with just a word.

Everyone envied him.

"Ms. Sinclair, I’m still new to this world. I’d appreciate your guidance."

The implication was clear—he wanted her as his backer.

Even if it was just because of his face, he’d gladly be a stand-in.

Evelyn answered without hesitation.

Xavier’s smile deepened. Was she agreeing to keep him?

With so many eyes on them, he needed to make this public.

He reached for her hand—

Evelyn stepped back before he could touch her, her gaze icy.

"Don’t."

Xavier stiffened.

She turned to leave but paused after two steps.

Then she walked back toward him.

Because behind her stood Nathan Blackwood.

Xavier froze, unsure how to react.

Evelyn gripped his arm, her voice deceptively soft.

"Mr. Delmont, follow me. I’ll make sure you’re taken care of."

For a moment, she felt like the villain in this scenario.

Xavier was torn between excitement and terror.

He stood rooted in place, unable to move.

The man behind him exuded an aura so oppressive it stole his breath.

A chill slithered down his spine—like death itself was watching.

"Let. Go."

Nathan’s voice was colder than the abyss, laced with lethal warning.

Xavier knew he should stay with Evelyn. This was his chance.

But his body betrayed him.

The second those words left Nathan’s lips, Xavier jerked away.

Then he bolted.

His speed was almost impressive.

Even Evelyn was stunned.
###Chapter 508

Nathan Blackwood's footsteps echoed as he approached.

"Scram."

That single word carried an invisible weight, pressing down on Xavier Delmont like an unshakable force. Resistance was futile.

Xavier knew better than to push his luck. His face paled as he turned and fled without another word.

He might have dared to cozy up to Evelyn Sinclair again later, but offending Nathan Blackwood? Never.

Evelyn didn’t spare Xavier a second glance. She hadn’t expected much backbone from someone like him, but his retreat had been impressively swift.

With a careless flick of her hair, she turned to face Nathan, her expression unreadable.

"You scared my man away, Mr. Blackwood. Quite the accomplishment."

Nathan’s dark eyes burned with something restrained, something deep and unspoken.

Evelyn didn’t care to decipher it.

Yet she couldn’t ignore the redness at the corners of his eyes, the pallor of his lips. He looked weaker than usual, his usual commanding presence dimmed.

"I’ll make it up to you."

His voice was rough, strained.

She didn’t understand.

Nathan stepped closer, towering over her. The sorrow in his gaze was unmistakable now, raw and suffocating.

"I can make it up by giving myself to you."

Evelyn had been willing to tolerate Xavier, a man who bore Nathan’s likeness.

Why wouldn’t she take the real thing?

Watching Xavier grovel for her attention had disgusted Nathan. Yet some twisted part of him had wanted to see—would she accept someone who looked like him?

She had.

She could joke with him, tease him, indulge him—as long as it wasn’t him.

The realization made Nathan feel pathetic.

Despair wrapped around him, dragging him into darkness. He could only watch her shine, forever out of reach.

And that damned lookalike had dared to leer at her with hunger in his eyes.

Nathan couldn’t take it anymore.

Evelyn let out a soft, mocking laugh. Her gaze was glacial. "I can’t afford you."

Her voice was sweet, yet devoid of warmth.

Nathan’s jaw clenched as he fought to keep his composure. But the cracks were spreading, his control crumbling.

Evelyn twisted the knife deeper. "You lied to me. Did it feel good, playing me for a fool?"

She stepped forward, relentless.

Nathan’s expression froze. The last flicker of hope in his eyes dimmed.

"I’m sorry."

Evelyn said nothing.

Nathan lifted his gaze, guilt and selfishness warring within him. "My leg had already healed when I returned from Costa Azul. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to lose the excuse to be near you. I wished it hadn’t healed. That way, I could keep seeing you."

Evelyn frowned. "Huh—"

Nathan continued, voice icy. "And I never told Tristan to run his mouth in front of Preston. He betrayed me. I won’t forgive him for that."

Just the mention of it made his blood boil.

Tristan Whitmore, his closest friend, had stabbed him in the back.

Unforgivable.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

After that incident, Tristan had bombarded her with endless messages, desperate to "clear Nathan’s name."

She never replied.

What was the point?

Did they really think she’d believe it now?

"Mr. Blackwood, what’s the use of saying all this?"

Evelyn was done. If she hadn’t discovered the truth about his leg, how long would he have kept up the act?

Nathan’s eyes were hollow, drowning in regret.

He had lied. And now, how could he ever make it right?

Evelyn didn’t want to look at him anymore. She walked past him without another word. Now that she didn’t have to hide, she’d stay a little longer before leaving.

Nathan watched her go, the distance between them stretching back to where they’d started—strangers.

The coldness was suffocating.

He had worked so hard to bridge that gap. He couldn’t let it all unravel now.

Nathan moved to follow her, but a frantic voice cut through the air behind him.

"Nathan! Why haven’t you been answering my calls?"

Since that night, Nathan had blocked Tristan everywhere.

He’d planned to never see him again.

But Tristan wasn’t one to wait for death. Nathan hadn’t seized his company—that had been his mercy.

They were supposed to be brothers.

Tristan, ever the social butterfly, had rushed over the moment he heard Nathan would be at Ethan Caldwell’s birthday party.

He’d never been this persistent, even when chasing women.

By the time Nathan turned, Evelyn was already gone.

A suffocating rage coiled in his chest as he glared at Tristan.

Maybe he’d been too lenient.

Tristan, dressed in his usual playboy attire, grinned nervously. "Nathan, did you accidentally block me?"

What a pathetic excuse.

Nathan’s response was icy. "Get lost."

Tristan gritted his teeth but pressed on. "I already explained everything to Evelyn! I didn’t mean to—she had my nudes, for God’s sake!"

He lowered his voice at the end, as if that made it better.

Nathan’s glare could have frozen hell. "So I’m supposed to pay for your mistake?"

Tristan hesitated. "I was trying to drive a wedge between Preston and Evelyn for you. It backfired, but—"

He faltered.

Nathan wasn’t interested in excuses.

Evelyn stood on the balcony, the breeze cool against her skin. Below, the party continued, oblivious.

Her fingers curled around a wine glass, elegant and poised. The sight left the person beside her momentarily speechless.

Ethan Caldwell smiled, following her gaze.

"I’m sorry. I didn’t think Adrian would invite people you’d rather avoid."

Evelyn shrugged. "It’s your birthday. As long as you’re happy."

Besides, even without Adrian, Nathan had the means to go wherever he pleased.

After a brief exchange, a waiter approached, struggling under the weight of an enormous bouquet of roses.

He was making a spectacle of himself.

Evelyn’s lips twitched in irritation as she stood there, unmoving.

The waiter finally peeked out from behind the flowers, face flushed, and handed her a small card tucked among the blooms.

"Ms. Sinclair, this is for you."

Evelyn took it without protest.

Her eyes skimmed the message:

[Dear Ms. Sinclair, May I invite you to dinner tonight? I’ll be waiting downstairs. —Xavier.]

She double-checked the signature.

Yes, it was Xavier—the same man who had fled from Nathan moments ago.
###Chapter 509

Nathan Blackwood's gaze was hollow, shadows clinging beneath his eyes as guilt twisted his expression.

He already regretted deceiving Evelyn Sinclair. But how could he possibly fix this?

Evelyn refused to meet his eyes. She strode past him without hesitation. At least she didn’t have to hide from him anymore. She’d linger a little longer, then leave.

Nathan watched her go as if they were strangers. Their relationship had plummeted back to the icy distance of their divorce.

That familiar chill could freeze a heart solid.

Yet he had fought so hard to thaw the space between them, to rebuild something resembling normalcy. How could he let it all crumble now?

Nathan took a step forward, ready to chase after her—until a frantic figure cut him off from behind.

"Nathan! Why the hell aren’t you answering my calls?"

Tristan Whitmore.

Nathan had blocked him after that incident. He’d planned to never see Tristan again.

But Tristan wasn’t the type to wait quietly for his own demise. Nathan hadn’t dismantled his company, leaving him just enough room to squirm.

They’d been close once. Brothers, even.

Unlike Zachary Whitmore.

Tristan always inserted himself into drama. Worried Nathan would evade him forever, he’d rushed here the moment he heard Nathan would attend Ethan Caldwell’s birthday party.

He’d never been this persistent, even when chasing women.

Evelyn vanished the second Nathan’s attention wavered.

A suffocating weight pressed against his ribs as he turned, pinning Tristan with a glacial stare.

Maybe he’d been too lenient.

Tristan, dressed like the epitome of a spoiled heir, grinned. "Nathan, did your finger accidentally block me?"

What a pathetic excuse.

Nathan’s voice was steel. "Get lost."

Tristan stiffened, teeth grinding. But he didn’t back down. "I already explained everything to Evelyn. I didn’t mean to screw up. I panicked when she confronted me—you know she has my nudes—"

His voice dropped to a whisper at the end.

Nathan’s frown deepened, annoyance flashing in his eyes. "So I’m supposed to suffer for your mistake?"

Tristan pressed his lips together. Silence stretched for a beat. "I was trying to drive a wedge between Preston and Evelyn for you. It backfired, but—"

He faltered. No justification came.

Nathan had no patience for his rambling.

Evelyn stood on the balcony, the evening breeze brushing against her skin. Below, the party unfolded like a staged play. Her fingers curled around a wine glass, elegance radiating effortlessly.

Ethan Caldwell appeared beside her, following her gaze.

"I’m sorry. I didn’t expect Adrian to invite people you’d rather avoid."

Evelyn arched a brow, indifferent. "It’s your birthday. Your happiness matters more."

Besides, even without Adrian, Nathan could go wherever he pleased.

They chatted briefly before a waiter approached, clutching an extravagant bouquet of roses.

He was definitely trying to make a scene.

Evelyn’s lips thinned as she stood motionless.

The waiter peeked out from behind the flowers, struggling to hand her a tucked-in card.

"Ms. Sinclair, this is for you."

She took it without protest.

Her eyes skimmed the message:

[Dear Ms. Sinclair, Dinner tonight? I’ll be waiting downstairs. —Xavier Delmont.]

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on the signature.

Xavier.

The same man who had fled from Nathan moments ago.
###Chapter 510

Evelyn's fingers hovered over her phone screen before she typed a message to Dominic Kingsley. "Does Xavier have any work scheduled tonight?"

Dominic's reply came seconds later. "He's playing a supporting role in Director Prescott's film. It's an overnight shoot."

Everything clicked into place.

She had the flowers disposed of, said a quick goodbye to Ethan, and turned to leave.

Adrian watched as his carefully laid trap for Nathan slipped away. He rushed after her.

"Evelyn, you've been drinking. It's not safe for you to leave alone. Let me arrange a ride for you."

She didn't even glance back. "No need."

"I insist—"

She stopped, turning just enough to pin him with a look. "Adrian, your show's ratings have been tanking, yet suddenly you're flush with cash. Why is the Blackwood family suddenly so generous with you?"

His expression flickered. She knew. She knew he'd been working with Nathan.

Damn it.

Being looked down on by the woman he once loved stung. But money was money.

"My uncle isn't as bad as you think. If you just got to know him—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Hard pass."

Adrian had nothing left to say.

She pressed the elevator button and descended.

A nondescript van idled by the curb.

The moment she stepped outside, the door slid open. Xavier jumped out, grinning.

"Ms. Sinclair!"

Upstairs, Nathan stood at the balcony, watching through the glass as Evelyn climbed into the vehicle.

And he saw him.

That bastard, Xavier.

His jaw clenched.

Tristan appeared beside him. "Nathan, that guy's nothing compared to you. Don't let it get to you. She's just trying to provoke you."

Nathan's voice was ice. "Send him back to whatever hole he crawled out of. Or make him disappear."

Tristan hesitated. "Bad idea. He's signed with Horizon Media—Dominic Kingsley's company. He's riding your coattails for clout. And Horizon belongs to Lucas Sterling."

The unspoken implication: Lucas's company meant Evelyn's involvement.

Nathan's eyes darkened. His chest burned.

He had to just take this?

Nathan cursed under his breath.

This was torture.

Evelyn slid into the van. Two staff members greeted her respectfully.

Xavier beamed like her presence was proof of his importance.

"Ms. Sinclair, where would you like to eat?"

She arched a brow. "Don't you have a shoot tonight?"

Before he could answer, she continued, "Let's go to the set. I've never seen it."

Xavier's heart leapt, though he kept his expression carefully neutral.

"Of course."

If the director and producers saw Evelyn with him, he wouldn’t need to explain his connections anymore.

Leading roles. Better contracts. Everything handed to him.

Other rookies had to hustle, but he only needed to please one woman.

"Anywhere you want!"

Xavier's face was all cool charm, but the eagerness beneath was unmistakable.

Disgusting. Evelyn nearly scoffed. If Nathan saw this, he’d probably punch Xavier’s teeth in.

The thought amused her.

She turned away, unwilling to humor him further.

Xavier didn’t notice. He was too busy dreaming of stardom.
###Chapter 511

Horizon Media's film crew was struggling through a difficult shoot.

With limited funding, the production values were noticeably low. The working conditions were far from ideal.

Xavier Delmont stood by the water tank. Crew members bustled around the set, focused on their tasks. Harsh studio lights created blinding glare, making faces indistinguishable. The air buzzed with hushed conversations.

"Ms. Sinclair, watch your step."

Tristan Whitmore moved to assist her. Evelyn Sinclair smiled but gently brushed his arm away as she walked forward.

She surveyed the chaotic set. No one noticed her arrival - too preoccupied with their own responsibilities.

This clearly displeased Tristan. He cleared his throat loudly twice. Evelyn shot him a warning look before forcing a polite smile.

"Keep it down. We don't want unnecessary attention."

Tristan froze, suddenly realizing his mistake.

Evelyn scanned the area before approaching the director.

The director sat glumly beside idle equipment, his expression stormy.

"Hey, who let you-"

An assistant whispered in his ear. The director looked up, his irritation vanishing when he recognized Evelyn.

Anyone in entertainment knew Evelyn Sinclair.

Her fame eclipsed most actresses, and her influence was unparalleled.

She didn't chase opportunities - she created them.

The director jumped up. "Ms. Sinclair!"

This was like finding a golden goose!

Since Horizon Media financed this film, he couldn't refuse their demands. Even if the talent had zero acting ability.

Evelyn approached gracefully. "Apologies for the interruption."

The director's expression darkened when he spotted Xavier behind her.

"Xavier! Where have you been? Do you realize hundreds of people are waiting on you?"

Xavier glanced at Evelyn with arrogant excitement.

"Sorry about that. Had some...important business."

The director fumed. This B-list actor already acted like a diva!

Before he could unleash his anger, Evelyn interjected clearly:

"Director, Xavier mentioned he's willing to make up tonight's scenes. However long it takes."

Silence fell across the set.

Since when did Xavier show such dedication?

The director's anger dissipated. "Then let's begin."

Xavier looked between Evelyn and the director, confused. Evelyn smiled. "Consider this an opportunity to prove yourself. You wouldn't refuse, would you?"

"Of course not!"

Xavier happily went for makeup. If this wealthy socialite wanted him to perform, he'd dazzle her with his looks and talent!

Evelyn took the seat beside the director, who suddenly felt uneasy.

He'd just realized who Xavier resembled. And if Evelyn brought him here...did that mean...?

Xavier moved quickly before the cameras, maximizing his physical advantages.

He played a domineering CEO - the second male lead who becomes obsessed after being rejected.

Evelyn listened to the director explain the scene with growing discomfort. It reminded her painfully of Nathan.

In this scene, Xavier's character begs the female lead for reconciliation. When refused, he threatens to jump into the ocean.

Xavier delivered his lines and plunged into the water without hesitation.

The director muttered, "Not bad. Let's do it again!"

The night was cold, the water freezing.

Xavier's patience visibly wore thin. He wasn't a serious actor, after all.

The director noticed but couldn't push harder with Evelyn present. He prepared to call it a wrap when-

Evelyn spoke after a long pause. "He's not in the right headspace. Have him jump until he finds it."
###Chapter 512

The winner was clear.

The misunderstanding between Evelyn and Xavier had been cleared up with her straightforward words.

The director's eyes lit up with excitement. "Enough talk! Let's reset and go again!"

Xavier shot Evelyn a pleading look. She simply took a seat beside the director, watching the scene unfold with detached interest. The studio equipment hummed in front of her.

Eleven takes.

That was how many times Xavier had to dive into the freezing water before the director finally gave his approval. By then, Xavier was shivering violently, his lips tinged blue. He barely remembered Evelyn existed as he stumbled away, desperate for warmth.

Exhaustion weighed his eyelids down.

The director, satisfied at last, called it a wrap.

He turned to Evelyn with a knowing smile. "Ms. Sinclair, Xavier still has much to learn. In the future, don’t hesitate to push him harder. After all, we can always edit out the mistakes. Actors need discipline."

Evelyn returned the smile, but there was no warmth in it. "Exactly. Hardship builds character."

Her words carried no favor for Xavier.

The director wasn’t stupid—he understood immediately.

Had Evelyn waited all this time just to say that?

Their relationship was clearly defined.

Xavier’s assistant approached cautiously. "Ms. Sinclair, I’ll arrange the car for you."

Evelyn nodded. "Don’t forget to wake him in three hours. He still has that commercial shoot."

He saw her as a wealthy patron.

She saw him as a profitable asset.

Both got exactly what they wanted.

The assistant nodded obediently. Though assigned to Xavier, he worked for Horizon Media. He knew who truly signed his paychecks.

By the time Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor, fatigue clung to her like a second skin. Lucas was lounging in the living room, eyeing her with an odd expression. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then seemed to think better of it.

She had no energy to decipher his thoughts. Scooping up Leo, who was weaving excitedly around her ankles, she headed upstairs to collapse into bed.

The next morning, she woke later than usual.

Descending the stairs, she froze.

William and Lucas were already seated at the dining table, waiting.

Lucas arched a brow. "Little E, got something to hide?"

An interrogation?

Evelyn rolled her eyes and slid into the empty chair beside William. "Plenty. Which secret are you digging for today?"

William cleared his throat, pulled out a tablet, and tapped play.

A familiar voice filled the room.

A student’s question rang out: "What made you walk away from your past relationship?"

Then, her own voice, sharp and unapologetic: "Why settle for trash when I’m the whole damn treasury?"

Her hand, reaching for her coffee, stilled.

She recognized the footage instantly.

Lucas whistled. "Already hit six figures in views. If the platforms hadn’t caught it fast, limiting exposure and deleting it, this would’ve gone nuclear by now."

But their real concern wasn’t the video.

It was Preston Sinclair.

Evelyn met their gazes evenly. "What if we are?"
###Chapter 513

The room fell into stunned silence after Evelyn's words.

Every face in the Sterling dining room paled.

Not a single person looked pleased.

Watching their horrified expressions, Evelyn couldn't help but smirk. "What if we're not?"

Lucas Sterling's face cycled through several emotions. "Don't—don't joke like that!"

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Of course it's impossible. Just a thought."

A collective exhale of relief filled the room.

William Sterling's gaze was heavy as he studied his daughter. "I know Preston Sinclair is collaborating with us, but keep your distance outside business. He may seem decent, but no one reaches his position without stepping on others."

It was rare for William to speak so bluntly about someone.

Evelyn responded with a quiet, noncommittal smile.

Alexander Sterling set down his fork. "Why not hand the Sinclair project to someone else? Take on a different venture."

Evelyn pushed her plate away. "Unnecessary. I know exactly what I'm doing."

Lucas scoffed. "Don't be fooled, Ev. Preston has a kid, and his ex-wife's situation is messier than Nathan Blackwood's. If you're looking for options, Xavier Delmont isn't bad—obedient, sensible, and easily managed with money."

Evelyn's expression darkened. Why did her family insist on painting her as some heartless socialite?

Was this really who they wanted her to become?

For the first time, she questioned her upbringing.

William frowned. "Who's Xavier?"

Evelyn swiftly redirected the conversation. "Speaking of distractions—what's the company planning for this year's retreat?"

Alexander glanced up. "Staff will organize their own activities. Executives are doing a countryside picnic. Interested?"

Evelyn nodded. "Invite other corporate leaders. It might ease tensions between competitors."

Blackwood Industries.

Harrison watched Nathan Blackwood replay the video for the twentieth time. His boss showed no signs of stopping.

With each replay, Nathan's jaw tightened further.

Evelyn's voice echoed through the penthouse office like a taunt.

"I'm wealthy enough—why would I stay with a man like you?"

To her, he was just another regrettable mistake.

Nathan Blackwood—reduced to nothing more than a footnote in Evelyn Sinclair's glittering life.

His knuckles whitened around the desk edge. Anger and something far more dangerous simmered beneath his controlled exterior.

The realization hit like a blade: her casual dismissal meant she'd truly moved on.

He'd lost her.

Not to another man.

To indifference.

The pain was excruciating—a thousand needles piercing his chest with every breath. The office temperature seemed to plummet as minutes bled into an hour.

Harrison risked a glance. Nathan's striking features were carved from ice, his usually vibrant eyes glassy with unshed emotion.

Is he... crying?

Harrison's blood ran cold. His feet rooted to the floor even as survival instincts screamed to flee. Why am I still standing here? Will he—
###Chapter 514

Harrison froze mid-sentence before seizing the chance to escape the office.

He exhaled sharply, as if resurrected from the dead.

Nathan Blackwood contemplated for a moment before dialing Theodore Winslow.

Surrender wasn't an option. Especially not to that snake Preston Sinclair.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm already... packing my things."

Theodore's voice trembled.

Margaret Blackwood had stormed in earlier, hurling insults while demanding he trash everything Evelyn Sinclair left behind. Theodore barely stopped her, terrified of what Nathan might do if he returned to find Evelyn's belongings gone.

When Margaret ordered him to leave, he'd complied without protest.

Theodore knew his failure to reconcile Nathan and Evelyn meant his days here were numbered.

Answering the call, he braced for the worst.

Survival was all he hoped for now.

Nathan's icy tone carried a rough edge. "Evelyn enjoyed those pastries you baked. Deliver them to her." A pause. "Actually, I'll take them myself."

Theodore blinked, then straightened.

"Yes, sir!"

The call conveyed two things: his job was safe, and Nathan was finally making a move.

Four hours later.

Nathan arrived at Sterling Enterprises carrying Theodore's dessert box, fresh from a draining board meeting.

The receptionist immediately alerted Bennett, who personally escorted him to the executive conference room.

"Coffee for Mr. Blackwood," Bennett instructed an assistant before adding politely, "President Sinclair is still in a meeting. Shall I notify President Sterling if this is urgent?"

Nathan dismissed the suggestion with a wave, settling into his seat. "I'll wait."

His aristocratic demeanor radiated silent warning.

Who dared keep Nathan Blackwood waiting?

Bennett hurried to inform Evelyn.

She cursed inwardly. Nathan haunted her like some persistent specter, his audacity growing daily.

As clock-out time approached, Evelyn headed to the conference room, unwilling to let colleagues witness this encounter.

"Mr. Blackwood, what urgent business brings you here?"

She emphasized "urgent business" pointedly.

Nathan suppressed his emotions, maintaining perfect composure.

"Theodore insisted I deliver these pastries he made for you."

"He insisted?"

Evelyn's disbelief was palpable. Since when did Theodore command Nathan?

The lie was laughably transparent.

Her lips curled coldly. "If you won't be honest, I'll show you out."

What a colossal waste of time.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I saw the interview. You called me a scumbag."

"Aren't you?"

Her arched brow matched her glacial stare.

Three seconds of silence passed before Nathan responded huskily, "Not anymore. Given the chance, I'll prove it."

"Unnecessary. Healed wounds still leave scars. I won't pick at them."

Evelyn's irritation flared. Was he delusional?

Nathan inhaled deeply.

"Scars conceal renewed skin beneath..."

Evelyn gaped.

He pressed on, "How can you judge my sincerity without testing it? Your rejections stem from fear of confronting our past. Where's your courage to move forward?"

His stern tone carried both challenge and unexpected encouragement.

Evelyn stared, torn between fury and speechlessness.

Nathan's regal poise and sculpted features radiated untouchable elegance—a stark contrast to Xavier Delmont's pitiful imitation attempts.

Yet even Xavier seemed preferable to this infuriating man before her.
###Chapter 515

Nathan watched Evelyn fall silent and assumed his reasoning had finally gotten through to her.

A quiet sigh of relief escaped him.

He'd taken a gamble, really. Their relationship couldn't possibly get any worse.

No matter how much he groveled or tiptoed around her, Evelyn remained unmoved—if anything, she only distanced herself further. So, he'd decided to cut the act and lay it all out plainly.

And it worked.

A faint, smug smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

Evelyn scoffed the next second.

Her icy gaze locked onto him. "Even if I wanted to move forward, it would depend on who I'm moving forward with. If it's you? I'd rather stay stuck in the past."

Nathan clenched his jaw, forcing himself to stay composed.

Infuriating.

But he had to endure it.

Another loss.

He was so furious he couldn't even speak. Evelyn shot him one last cold glare before storming out.

Outside, the office staff had gathered near the door, shamelessly eavesdropping.

They scattered the moment the door swung open.

Only Bennett remained, expression unreadable.

"Ms. Sinclair, the car is ready."

Evelyn glanced back at Nathan. "Aren't you leaving, Mr. Blackwood? I have a schedule to keep. I promised Xavier I'd visit him on set today..."

Nathan's eyes darkened. That pretty-boy actor who looked like a cheap knockoff of him had been a thorn in his side for too long.

And now, Evelyn was twisting the knife.

"Perfect timing," Nathan said, voice low. "I'll join you."

He needed to see that fool for himself.

Evelyn arched a brow. Without missing a beat, Nathan added, "That film, right? Blackwood Industries is the producer."

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes. What a joke of a movie.

On Set

Xavier was on his millionth take.

Even the extras were exchanging exasperated looks. The man couldn't act to save his life—every step looked like he was strutting down a runway, and his "intense" gaze was more suited to a perfume ad than a dramatic rescue scene.

The director was fuming. "Again! And this time, try to look like you're actually saving someone!"

Xavier bit back a complaint. His agent had warned him—no whining, no tantrums.

If only Evelyn were here. She'd promised to take care of him.

Then it hit him.

He didn’t even have her number.

Damn it.

Evelyn regretted coming the second she stepped out of the car.

Xavier's fans and paparazzi had swarmed the set.

She'd chosen to arrive openly to avoid being photographed sneaking around, but now she was trapped in a sea of flashing cameras.

Forcing a polished smile, she waved gracefully before whispering to Bennett, "Get Xavier out here. Now."

That man was her investment.

No one noticed Bennett slipping away.

"Ms. Sinclair, are you here to see Xavier?"

Evelyn smiled but didn’t answer.

The reporters knew better than to push. She wasn’t some starlet they could badger for gossip.

One wrong move, and their careers would be over.

Nathan's arrival sent the crowd into a frenzy.

Gone was the cold, untouchable CEO from the magazines. His shirt was slightly undone, his suit jacket casually draped over one arm—effortlessly magnetic.

The reporters instinctively parted for him.

Nathan stopped beside Evelyn, his gaze softening as he looked at her. The warmth in his smile was unmistakable.

The cameras caught it all.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you also here to see Xavier?"

Everyone knew why Xavier had risen to fame.

Let’s be real—he was a stand-in for Nathan.

The idea of the original and the copy sharing the same frame? Too delicious.

Nathan smirked. "Yes..."
###Chapter 516

Nathan Blackwood actually came to visit Xavier Delmont personally?

With Evelyn Sinclair by his side?

The entire set fell into stunned silence.

No one knew how to react!

The next moment, Xavier came bounding over like an overexcited puppy.

He'd been stuck doing the same scene over and over, exhausted and frustrated—until he heard Evelyn had arrived. The director, sensing his distraction, waved him off without protest.

See? Having a billionaire heiress as your patron had its perks.

Xavier barely made it two steps before spotting the swarm of reporters surrounding Evelyn.

His heart raced. Appearing publicly with her? This was beyond his wildest fantasies.

"Xavier's here..." someone murmured.

The crowd instinctively parted for him.

Suppressing his giddiness, Xavier forced a humble smile onto his face. Then he saw him—Nathan Blackwood, standing beside Evelyn like a dark storm cloud.

His feet locked. His smile froze.

One thought screamed through his mind: Oh, fck.*

The reporters, of course, zeroed in on the only celebrity present.

Microphones and cameras shoved into his face, Xavier didn't dare show irritation. He kept that plastic smile intact as he shuffled toward Evelyn and Nathan.

Evelyn, ever gracious, shifted aside—placing him directly between them.

Center stage.

Right between Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood. Xavier wanted to scream. This was NOT the spotlight he wanted!

Nathan's icy aura was suffocating. Xavier didn't dare meet his gaze.

He couldn't look at Evelyn either—not with Nathan's murderous glare burning into him.

Pure torture.

"Xavier," a reporter called eagerly, "how do you feel about Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood visiting you together?"

Xavier's grin turned rigid. "How do I feel? Terrified, mostly."

Evelyn chuckled beside him. "Relax," she murmured.

Every camera snapped toward them.

The contrast was striking—a powerful heiress soothing a nervous young actor.

Nathan's jaw tightened. His sharp gaze cut to Xavier like a blade.

Xavier didn't breathe. Didn't blink. "I'm... honored," he stammered. "Deeply moved."

His stilted delivery raised eyebrows.

People glanced between Xavier and Nathan—and suddenly, the resemblance seemed laughable.

Nathan stood there, silent and imposing, radiating authority with just a glance.

Xavier? Twitchy. Desperate. His eyes darted with naked ambition.

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. Pathetic.

Before Xavier could embarrass himself further, she smoothly intervened.

"Everyone, please focus on his upcoming projects."

If he kept talking, he'd tank his own career.

"What's next for Xavier?" a reporter pressed.

Evelyn paused. Even Xavier held his breath.

Then she smiled. "In the next seven days? Three film roles. Four TV cameos. Six ad campaigns. A dozen events." She tilted her head. "Plenty to look forward to."
###Chapter 517

The tension in the room was palpable.

Everyone exchanged shocked glances.

Xavier Delmont, a mere lookalike, had just received an unprecedented amount of resources. The sheer favoritism was staggering!

His initial excitement quickly faded as Evelyn Sinclair continued speaking. His shoulders tensed visibly.

Xavier had been pushing himself to the limit lately - surviving on three hours of sleep while maintaining perfect professionalism.

The opportunities Evelyn offered thrilled him, but the weight of expectations pressed down heavily.

Would this workload kill him?

Evelyn glanced at her diamond-encrusted watch. Bennett stepped forward precisely on cue. "Ms. Sinclair, your meeting with the studio head begins in fifteen minutes."

The revelation hit everyone at once. This wasn't a personal visit after all.

Evelyn gave a curt nod and turned to leave without ceremony.

Her indifference spoke volumes.

She couldn't care less about the reporters' speculations. None of their articles would see the light of day anyway.

Nathan Blackwood followed silently in her wake.

Xavier stepped aside deferentially, his bowed head displaying unmistakable reverence.

The contrast between the original and the copy couldn't be more striking.

Nathan suppressed a derisive smirk. This imitation was pathetically inferior. As if Evelyn would ever settle for someone like Xavier!

He caught up to her in three long strides. "That was a short visit."

Evelyn didn't break stride. "Too many spectators today. We'll continue another time."

Nathan's chest constricted painfully at her words, a familiar suffocating sensation returning.

Back at Sterling Manor...

William Sterling lounged in the sunroom, sipping Earl Grey while Leo the robotic tiger purred at his feet.

The moment Evelyn entered, his attention sharpened. "I heard Nathan came to your office today?"

The incident had caused enough stir that even Alexander Sterling knew about it.

Evelyn confirmed without pretense.

William's lips thinned. "There are whispers about an arranged engagement between the Blackwoods and Ashfords. Are you aware?"

Evelyn hadn't known, nor did she care.

But William's warning carried weight - the Blackwood family's movements affected entire market sectors.

Consider it both advice and caution.

"It doesn't concern me."

Five words that drew her line in the sand.

William nodded approvingly. "However impressive Nathan may be, the Blackwoods prioritize short-term gains. They're not to be trusted."

Except for Nathan, the entire Blackwood clan lacked vision. Even old Reginald Blackwood focused only on immediate profits - disappointing indeed.

Evelyn knew the Blackwoods wouldn't wait indefinitely for her response.

She wanted no further entanglement with that family.

"I understand. I'll maintain appropriate boundaries."

That was William's true concern - that she might soften and get hurt again.

His protective instincts toward his daughter ran deep.

Dawn broke chilly the next morning.

A persistent drizzle pattered against the windows, the rhythmic tapping almost hypnotic.

Evelyn had tossed all night, plagued by inexplicable restlessness.

After a slow morning routine, she descended to find Lucas Sterling gulping orange juice while watching celebrity gossip.

She tossed her car keys at him. "Drive me to work."

Lucas nearly choked. "Can't you leave earlier with Alexander? You're both CEOs, but he's clearly more dedicated!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow just as William returned from his morning fishing.

"Dad! Lucas is shaming me for sleeping in and refusing to drive me!"

William fixed his youngest son with a warning glare. "Looking for trouble?"

Lucas stomped his foot in protest. The favoritism was outrageous! "Don't I deserve parental love too?"

Evelyn smirked victoriously. After all these years, her baby brother still hadn't learned his place in the family hierarchy.
###Chapter 518
The Labyrinth of Santo Tower

Evelyn Sinclair barely stepped out of the car when Lucas Sterling slammed the accelerator and sped away.

He was clearly throwing a tantrum.

A familiar voice called out. "Ms. Sinclair!"

She turned to see Theodore Winslow jogging toward her, slightly out of breath. In his hands was an elegant blue custom-made box.

Evelyn's expression darkened.

Nathan Blackwood just wouldn't give up. His persistence was becoming increasingly shameless.

Theodore presented the box with a practiced smile. "Good morning, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood personally selected these for you. Freshly flown in from New Zealand. He hopes you'll appreciate them."

Without waiting for her response, he opened the lid.

Inside lay a bouquet of exquisite red roses.

The entrance of Sterling Enterprises buzzed with employees coming and going. It was obvious Nathan wanted to make a public statement—to mark his territory.

Evelyn saw right through his petty game.

She kept her voice cool. "I don't want them. Take them back."

Theodore chuckled nervously, rubbing his hands together. "Ms. Sinclair, while you've moved out of Highland Estates, your packages keep arriving. I've been storing them for you."

Evelyn blinked. She'd nearly forgotten about the numerous items she'd ordered during her time there.

Her tone softened slightly. "Thank you, Theodore."

He waved dismissively. "No need for thanks. Flowers this magnificent deserve someone equally extraordinary. If you refuse them, their beauty would be wasted."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn accepted the box with a small smile. "Just this once. Don't expect it to happen again."

She only took them because of Theodore.

"Understood!" Theodore beamed, watching as she walked toward the building before returning to the sleek Range Rover parked discreetly nearby.

Inside the vehicle, Nathan observed everything.

His mood lifted when he saw her accept the flowers.

She actually took them?

Her initial coldness had melted into something almost... gentle? The abrupt change puzzled him.

Theodore slid into the passenger seat. "Ms. Sinclair was delighted when she learned the flowers were from you! I told you—women love grand gestures. The more lavish, the better."

A satisfied smirk tugged at Nathan's lips. The confidence that had been crushed yesterday began rebuilding.

"I'll deliver them personally tomorrow," he declared.

Theodore's smile faltered. "But sir—"

"I'll make time," Nathan stated firmly.

Theodore swallowed his protest. He feared the emotional whiplash his employer might soon experience.

Before the car could start, the driver suddenly spoke up.

"Another flower delivery for Ms. Sinclair!"

All eyes turned toward the building's entrance.

Somehow, Evelyn had received a second bouquet before even reaching her office—this time a stunning arrangement of pristine white roses, radiating purity and grace.

Little Oliver Sinclair held them proudly. "Pretty Lady! These are from me and Daddy! For good luck!"

Evelyn paused, then laughed. "That's... quite the blessing."

She adored them.

The white roses' understated elegance screamed Preston Sinclair's refined taste. Just like the man himself—modest yet unforgettable.

"Pretty Lady, can I stay with you? I promise I won't be any trouble!" Oliver clasped his tiny hands together, putting on his most angelic face.

Evelyn couldn't resist ruffling his curls. "Of course you can!"

Hand in hand, they entered the building. She casually handed the red roses to a security guard while carrying the white bouquet upstairs.

From his car, Nathan witnessed everything.

Dark clouds gathered over his handsome features.

That damn Sinclair boy was just as irritating as his father.
###Chapter 519

Evelyn handed little Oliver to Bennett and headed straight into the boardroom for her meeting.

When she returned, the boy was quietly assembling a puzzle in her office, his small fingers carefully placing each piece.

She reviewed contracts for nearly an hour before her phone buzzed.

Preston Sinclair's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Sinclair?" she answered.

"Ms. Sterling, how's my son behaving?"

That deep, velvety voice of his could melt glaciers. It always made her pulse quicken.

She blinked, momentarily distracted. "He's being an angel. Currently conquering a thousand-piece puzzle."

A rich chuckle traveled through the line. "The little traitor conspired with his nanny and security detail to skip school today."

Evelyn glanced at Oliver. "Would you like to speak with him?"

"No!"

The boy slammed the phone down before Preston could respond. He'd orchestrated this entire escape just to be with his Pretty Lady. No interruptions allowed.

Evelyn smirked at the disconnected call and texted Preston: [I'll have him call when he finishes playing.]

His reply came instantly: [I'll collect him personally.]

Another message followed: [That way I get to see you too.]

Her fingers hovered over the screen. No appropriate response came to mind, so she left it unanswered.

"Pretty Lady, don't let Daddy take me home!" Oliver clung to her sleeve with sticky fingers.

She tweaked his nose. "We'll see."

Near dusk, Bennett knocked. "Mr. Sinclair has arrived."

"Send him in."

Preston materialized in the doorway, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "Am I interrupting?"

"Not at all."

His gaze swept over Oliver, who was now sprawled across the carpet assembling what appeared to be a miniature city. "Someone's enjoying himself."

Preston's lips curved as he turned to Evelyn. "Join us for dinner?"

Her automatic refusal was on her tongue. "I have prior engagements."

His smile deepened as he addressed his son. "Oliver, won't you invite Ms. Sterling to dine with us?"

The boy finally looked up. "Okay."

If it meant more time with Evelyn, he'd tolerate his father's presence.

Oliver scrambled to his feet. "Pretty Lady, will you go on a date with me?"

Preston's expression darkened. "Who taught you that word?"

The child folded his arms. "If Pretty Lady won't eat, then I won't eat, and Daddy won't eat! We'll all starve together!"

Evelyn nearly choked. Why did the threat always single her out as the one who'd perish first?

Under Oliver's puppy-dog eyes and Preston's smoldering stare, her resistance crumbled. "Fine. I'll reschedule."

She instructed Bennett to postpone her unimportant meetings.

The bistro nearby had cozy window seats with swinging chairs.

Preston produced a bouquet of white hydrangeas seemingly from nowhere. "An elderly vendor outside," he lied smoothly.

Oliver snatched the flowers first, eyeing his father suspiciously. "There's no flower lady out there. Lying's bad, Daddy."

Preston's jaw tightened. This child would be the death of him.

The boy had grown increasingly wary of his father's motives. Was Daddy actually trying to steal Pretty Lady for himself?

Their silent glaring contest amused Evelyn as she shelled shrimp.

The tense moment shattered when two familiar figures approached their table.

"You—you have a child together?!" gasped Victoria Ashford, her manicured hand flying to her mouth.
###Chapter 520

Margaret Blackwood's reaction was so abrupt it drew immediate attention. Her sharp voice cut through the air like a blade.

Beside her, Victoria Ashford stood meekly, eyes downcast, as if trying to disappear into the background.

But the moment she spotted Evelyn Sinclair, a flicker of something dark and bitter flashed in her gaze.

Evelyn didn’t spare Victoria a glance. She merely lifted her eyes, cool and composed, to meet Margaret’s.

No explanation. No justification. She couldn’t be bothered.

Margaret realized she’d lost her composure and quickly schooled her expression.

The man seated across from Evelyn was immaculately dressed, his presence commanding. Every movement exuded effortless grace.

The child beside him was well-mannered, his politeness natural rather than forced.

Given Evelyn’s status, the company she kept was never ordinary.

Yet Margaret couldn’t resist prying.

"My mistake. Evelyn, is this your… boyfriend?"

She eyed Preston Sinclair as if she had any right to an answer.

By etiquette, he should have stood to greet her. But Preston had already assessed the situation—this woman meant nothing to Evelyn.

Evelyn took her time peeling a shrimp, her movements elegant, before placing it on Oliver Sinclair’s plate. Then she turned to Margaret.

Her voice was ice.

"Do we know each other well enough for introductions?"

Margaret’s face twisted. Evelyn was as infuriating as ever.

Victoria tugged at her sleeve. "Aunt Margaret, let’s not interrupt Ms. Sinclair’s meal. Shall we go?"

Margaret glanced at Victoria, pleased. Her future daughter-in-law might lack pedigree, but at least she knew her place.

She patted Victoria’s hand before smirking at Evelyn.

"If you’ve already found someone, Evelyn, then move your things out of Highland Estates. Don’t try to keep a foot in both camps—you’ll only end up with nothing."

Evelyn’s smile vanished.

Before she could respond, Preston let out a cold laugh.

His voice was calm, but his eyes, once warm, now held a dangerous chill.

"Ms. Sinclair has impeccable taste. She wouldn’t lower herself to associate with just any camp—especially not a worthless one."

The air froze.

Margaret bristled. "You have no right to speak!"

Evelyn countered smoothly, "Neither do you."

She picked up a napkin, wiping her slender fingers with deliberate precision.

"Hmph! Fine. Evelyn, haven’t you heard? The engagement is off. Women like you—too proud, too cold—end up with nothing but leftovers. A man with a child, no less. Pathetic."

She sneered at Oliver, who glared back, tiny fists clenched.

Evelyn’s gaze darkened. "Mrs. Blackwood, you should worry about your own future."

Oliver might not have understood everything, but he knew one thing—this woman had made his father angry.

That made her a villain.

He huffed. "Pretty Lady is a princess! Bad lady, you can’t bully my princess!"

Margaret scoffed. "She’ll be your wicked stepmother soon enough."

Instantly, both Evelyn and Preston’s expressions darkened.

The tension thickened, suffocating.

Victoria stayed silent, sensing the danger.

Evelyn pulled out her phone.

She dialed a number.

It was answered in less than a second.

"Evelyn?" Nathan Blackwood’s voice held unmistakable surprise—and hope.

Evelyn put the call on speaker.

Margaret stiffened at her son’s voice.

Evelyn’s tone was razor-sharp. "Mr. Blackwood, the Stanton and Blackwood families have only just begun to reconcile. Are you so eager to ruin it again?"
###Chapter 521

The phone line went dead for two heartbeats.

Nathan's voice cut through like ice.

"Fall out? Explain yourself."

Evelyn Sinclair's gaze locked onto Margaret Blackwood. The older woman was already unraveling.

"Mrs. Blackwood brought your fiancée here to humiliate me and Mr. Sinclair. Was this your idea, or your father-in-law's?"

The chill radiating through the phone was palpable.

"Where are you?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. She ended the call.

Her goal wasn’t to summon him.

She wanted the Blackwood family to rein Margaret in.

Evelyn was no longer Nathan’s wife. She owed Margaret nothing.

Margaret hadn’t expected Evelyn to call Nathan.

Truthfully, Margaret feared her son.

Sophia’s disappearance should have been a lesson, but she’d nearly forgotten.

Victoria Ashford noticed Margaret trembling and rushed to steady her.

"Aunt Margaret, let’s sit down."

Margaret opened her mouth, but Evelyn’s piercing stare stole her voice.

The restaurant fell silent.

Evelyn resumed eating as if nothing happened. Preston Sinclair studied her, lips pressed tight.

"Ms. Sterling, you—"

Was she truly unbothered?

Evelyn smiled. "I’m used to it. I only regret dragging you and Oliver into this. Why waste energy on people who don’t matter?"

Oliver Sinclair darted forward, grabbing Evelyn’s hand. His wide, earnest eyes met hers.

"Pretty Lady, my heart hurts for you. I’ll protect you. When I inherit everything, I’ll take you far away from these awful people!"

Preston’s expression darkened. He pinched the bridge of his nose.

This boy and his obsession with inheritance.

He sighed, then turned to Evelyn, voice solemn. "I’m not angry. Just heartbroken for you."

Evelyn had endured so much pain for loving Nathan.

How absurd was that?

Preston’s sympathy struck a chord. Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She looked down, smiling faintly.

Her phone buzzed again.

She glanced at the screen—unknown number—and answered after a beat.

"Ms. Sterling, it’s Victoria Ashford. Please, speak up for Mrs. Blackwood!"
###Chapter 522

Before Evelyn could finish speaking, the line went dead.

Isabella had blocked the number completely.

Three days later, the company retreat arrived.

They gathered at a paintball arena in the countryside. Twelve participants showed up, including three senior executives from Sterling Enterprises and several business partners with close ties to Blackwood Industries.

Nathan had been expected to attend.

But Evelyn never appeared.

He looked troubled, clearly wanting to say something, but Alexander intercepted him, preventing any private conversation.

Typical big brother behavior.

Evelyn found the game intriguing. The military-style uniforms and harmless paintball guns added to the excitement.

She changed faster than anyone in the locker room. Emerging outside, a tall figure blocked her path.

With everyone wearing masks, identities remained concealed. No mercy would be shown.

Yet Evelyn recognized him instantly.

Nathan Blackwood.

She glared silently.

His military uniform accentuated his imposing frame. That familiar commanding presence reminded her of their first encounter five years ago on the streets of Paris.

Her breath hitched momentarily.

"Move," Evelyn demanded through clenched teeth.

Nathan studied her intently, emotions churning behind his gaze.

That phone call had unsettled him.

He knew Isabella wouldn't say anything pleasant.

But hearing about Evelyn's cozy dinner with Preston and his son made his chest tighten painfully.

The hurt ran deep.

Nathan's voice dropped low. "I apologize you had to hear those vile words."

He'd promised no Blackwood would insult her again.

Yet Margaret had broken that vow.

He'd consulted Reginald Blackwood immediately. They'd shipped Margaret to a Swiss sanitarium despite her protests.

The elder Blackwood agreed completely. Even without marital ties, antagonizing the Sterlings made no business sense.

"You didn't say anything," Evelyn countered. "Why apologize?"

"Do you want her personal apology?"

"I don't even want to see her."

Nathan chuckled softly. Her anger amused him.

"Evelyn, I need to hold you."

The confession slipped out before he could stop it.

Before she could react, his arms encircled her, pressing her against his chest where she could hear his steady heartbeat.

Furious, Evelyn kicked him squarely where his injury had been.

He groaned, staggering backward.

Instinct made her reach out to steady him.

Their helmets collided hard.

Nathan's deep laughter rumbled through her.

Realization dawned - she'd been tricked.

He adjusted her helmet swiftly, stepping back before she could retaliate.

"I'll let you win," he declared confidently.

Evelyn nearly exploded. "Big talk!"

Did he think she needed his charity?

Where did this arrogance come from?

Infuriating man!

The mask and helmet hid her murderous glare completely.

Alexander called from outside, forcing Evelyn to hurry out.

He held two colored sticks. Both red.

"Teams are set. You're together since these are the last two."

Evelyn snatched hers indifferently.

Nathan approached politely. "Thank you, brother."

Alexander froze mid-step, nearly tripping.

Everyone stared. That "brother" could raise the dead.

"Can we start?" Evelyn demanded.

"Begin!"

She raised her paintball gun immediately, firing point-blank at the man before her.

Splat.

Nathan was out.

"Hey! Same team!" a red teammate protested.
###Chapter 523

The old woman was clearly trouble.

Little Oliver Sinclair huffed in protest.

"Pretty Lady is a princess! Bad old lady! You can't bully my princess!"

Margaret Blackwood scoffed. "She'll be your wicked stepmother soon enough."

Instantly, both Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair's expressions darkened.

The air turned icy.

Isabella Montgomery stayed silent, sensing the tension.

Evelyn pulled out her phone.

She dialed a number.

It was answered in seconds.

"Evelyn?" Nathan Blackwood's voice held surprise and delight.

She put the call on speaker.

Nathan stood nearby, watching from an elevated position.

He noted Evelyn's precision—her movements sharp, her agility impressive. She moved like a professional.

Several heavier participants were quickly eliminated.

A few kept up, but none matched Evelyn's skill.

Soon, only two remained on the blue team and two on the red.

Identical uniforms made it hard to distinguish them.

The red team struggled.

But the slimmer of the two was fast. They whispered to their partner before splitting up.

One circled behind, silent, avoiding detection. No gun was raised—just a swift chokehold.

Their target lost balance and fell.

"Ouch—my back!"

The voice belonged to a senior executive from Sterling Enterprises.

The blue team lost another member. Simultaneously, the remaining red team member fired.

Another blue team player was hit.

Now, only one remained on each side.

The eliminated group watched, murmuring. Nathan scanned the field—Evelyn was missing.

Meaning, she was the last red team member.

Admiration flickered in his gaze.

The woman he loved was extraordinary.

"Wait—is the blue team's last player President Sterling?" someone asked.

Indeed. Only Evelyn and Alexander Sterling hadn't returned.

Siblings turned rivals?

This would be interesting.

Excitement buzzed as binoculars were raised.

But before anyone could locate them—

A shot rang out.

Game over.

The blue team member showed signs of a hit.

Cheers erupted.

Evelyn dashed out, beaming, and threw her arms around Alexander.

She knew he'd let her win.

First round victory went to the red team.

Nathan studied her joy—a rare, unfiltered happiness he hadn't seen before.

A pang struck him. He'd missed so much of her life.

His jaw tightened.

After a break, round two began.

This time, Evelyn drew blue. Nathan got red.

Opponents.

His pulse quickened. Arrogance glinted in his eyes.

It had been years since he held a gun. The thrill was primal, buried deep but never forgotten.

He moved toward the perfect sniping spot.

Two steps in—

A shot.

Pain bloomed in his side.

"Seriously? Dead again?!"

"You're opponents now," someone reminded him.

Not teammates.

Evelyn smirked. "Exactly. I eliminated the enemy."

Wasn't that the point?

Silence.

No one had a rebuttal.
###Chapter 524

Nathan Blackwood turned back before taking two steps, his frustration barely contained.

Twice now, Evelyn Sinclair had been the reason for his elimination.

If she claimed it wasn't intentional, no one would believe her.

His gaze darkened as it settled on her, stormy and unreadable. The tension between them was palpable, sending the onlookers scattering to avoid the confrontation.

Evelyn tried to slip away, but Nathan blocked her path.

"Was that deliberate?" His voice was low, edged with irritation.

The sunlight caught in his eyes, turning them into turbulent pools of shadow.

"Can't handle losing?" Evelyn smirked, her tone dripping with mockery.

She had beaten him twice already. Victory was hers—no need for his hollow concessions.

Nathan let out a dark chuckle. "I can handle it."

He'd underestimated her.

For the first time in his life, he'd met his match—and it infuriated him.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, her expression cool. "You came here for fun today. Don’t let the sun ruin your mood. Take a break."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

Infuriating woman.

As she turned to leave, his arm snaked around her waist, pulling her close. His breath brushed her ear. "Don’t get too comfortable. There’s still one round left."

He had to win.

Three losses in a row? Unacceptable. His pride wouldn’t allow it.

Evelyn scoffed, wrenching herself free before darting toward the trench.

Nathan watched her go, a slow smirk curving his lips.

His eyes gleamed with challenge—hungry, relentless.

In the second round, Evelyn let her guard down. A shot from the opposing team caught her off guard.

Alexander Sterling took the win.

Evelyn beamed, rushing to hand him water and a towel. "Big Brother, you were amazing!"

Alexander merely smiled, ignoring Nathan’s bitter glare.

An executive nearby quipped, "President Sterling is your opponent, yet you’re pampering him? Where’s our service?"

Laughter rippled through the group.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "What can I say? I play favorites."

The third round began.

Nathan and Evelyn faced off again.

The others exchanged knowing glances, sympathy lacing their expressions.

They all knew why Nathan had joined today—Evelyn.

The man who never had time for team-building events was here, chasing after his ex-wife.

At least he’d put up a fight in the first two rounds.

But this time?

Evelyn moved swiftly, determined to take him out first.

Yet the moment she turned, he was gone.

Her brows furrowed. Quick learner.

A cold barrel pressed against her back.

She froze.

Nathan had been waiting in the shadows.

"I’ll let you go once," he murmured. "But if I catch you three times, you agree to one request. Deal?"

Arrogance laced his voice, raw and unyielding.

Evelyn met his gaze.

"And if you fail?"

"Then I’ll grant you a request."

"Deal."

She’d make sure he regretted it.

Nathan lowered the gun. Evelyn bolted, the wind whipping past her as adrenaline surged.

She wouldn’t let him win.

Not again.

The blue team’s strategy sharpened, picking off opponents one by one.

Gunfire echoed in Evelyn’s ears.

Her pulse raced.

Something had changed.

Nathan’s team was unstoppable.
###Chapter 525

Nathan and Alexander found themselves on the same blue team, tipping the scales against their opponents.

Evelyn Sinclair had only one target in mind—Nathan Blackwood.

The wind howled through the trees, its relentless rush drowning out all other sounds.

Footsteps crunched against the underbrush, blending with the gusts until it was impossible to tell friend from foe.

Evelyn pressed herself against a thick oak, striking swiftly from the shadows. One by one, blue team members fell to her calculated attacks.

But the red team wasn’t faring much better—four of their own had already been eliminated.

By the time the dust settled, Evelyn stood alone against Nathan and Alexander.

A plan formed in her mind. She unbuckled the red armband from her sleeve and tossed it aside.

A lone blue team member prowled near the forest’s edge. She couldn’t tell if it was Nathan or Alexander.

Silent as a shadow, she crept closer.

Just as she raised her weapon, cold metal pressed against her back.

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk as he yanked her against him, his grip unyielding.

Evelyn stiffened.

How dare he use this as an excuse to touch her?

"Don’t move," he murmured, breath hot against her ear. "Or they’ll see you."

"Let go," she hissed.

"This is the second time, Evelyn." His voice was rough, edged with something dangerous. "You should be more careful."

She could feel his heartbeat against her back—steady, confident.

He had never been one to back down before. But this time, he wasn’t just playing for pride.

The moment his hold loosened, she twisted, firing blindly behind her.

He vanished into the trees before she could confirm the hit.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and melted back into the shadows.

The eliminated students watched in stunned silence.

"Did Nathan just let her go?"

"Is this flirting or humiliation?"

"At this rate, he might as well surrender and hand her the win."

Evelyn ignored them. She couldn’t stay hidden forever.

The wind roared in her ears, disorienting her. She dropped low, crawling through the undergrowth.

Then—footsteps.

Close. Too close.

Her pulse spiked. She ducked behind a tree, gripping her weapon tighter.

The steps drew nearer, deliberate and unhurried.

She held her breath.

A twig snapped.

In one fluid motion, she spun and fired.

The shot rang out.

Silence.

Then—a grunt.

Alexander staggered into view, clutching his shoulder.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. She lunged forward instinctively.

But he waved her off with a wry smile. "I’m fine."

Nathan emerged from the trees, his expression dark.

Teammates, yet Alexander had taken a hit for Evelyn.

What was that supposed to mean?

Without a word, Alexander unclipped his tag.

"Game over for me," he said, glancing between them. "Don’t let me interrupt."

Then he turned and walked away, leaving them alone in the forest.
###Chapter 526

Evelyn and Nathan stood fifteen feet apart, the last ones remaining.

Their eyes locked. Both raised their weapons simultaneously.

Two gunshots cracked through the air.

Only the sound remained.

The wind howled between them.

Neither bullet found its mark.

Evelyn ducked behind a tree trunk, gasping for breath.

Nathan rolled into the tall grass with practiced ease.

He moved faster than she could recover. Before Evelyn could steady her breathing, Nathan seized the advantage.

His gun appeared at her back just as hers pressed against his abdomen.

Nathan's eyes burned with undisguised admiration.

He was a professional, but she was better.

Neither would yield.

Evelyn studied him. Was this really the same man?

She lowered her weapon slightly.

Nathan's lips curved into a smirk. Seizing her momentary distraction, he twisted his wrist.

With one fluid motion, he pinned her gun hand against the tree trunk. His long legs trapped hers, rendering her immobile.

Evelyn's eyes widened. Had he just pulled a cheap trick?

Though strong, she couldn't match Nathan's raw physical power.

The realization hit her instantly.

His face hovered dangerously close. The wild intensity in his dark eyes made her freeze.

Yet his expression held only triumph and amusement.

He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Evelyn," he murmured, voice thick with satisfaction, "Third round. My win."

She wanted to curse him. The bastard had cheated!

Then she remembered - she'd won their first two matches using similar tactics.

They were even.

"Damn it." Evelyn met his gaze and faltered.

No trace of the polished businessman remained. His eyes burned with primal exhilaration.

Suddenly, he moved closer.

He meant to kiss her.

Evelyn tried to knee him, but his legs held hers captive.

She turned her face away. His cool lips brushed her cheek instead.

"Get off me," she hissed.

Nathan stepped back with a roguish grin, completely unbothered.

Free again, Evelyn shot him a venomous glare and turned to leave.

"That conniving bastard Nathan Blackwood! He's sunk to new lows!"

Nathan gathered her discarded items, following with infuriating smugness. "I won, Evelyn. You owe me one request."

She whirled around. "What?"

"Marry me again?" His eyes sparkled with mischief.

"Dream on."

"Then a kiss?"

Evelyn clenched her teeth. One more ridiculous demand and she'd lose control.

Nathan grew serious. "At least give me a chance."

She remained silent, her expression unreadable.

"I've been chasing you, Evelyn. Still am."

Every moment since their divorce, he'd pursued her relentlessly.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Nathan Blackwood, what you feel isn't love. It's wounded pride because I stopped loving you first. You can't stand that I walked away without your permission. This isn't affection - it's bitterness!"

Nathan's dark eyes searched hers. The silence stretched between them.

All strength seemed to leave his body.

His regrets, his devotion, his humility - to her, they meant nothing?

"Evelyn," he said quietly, "I know the difference between wounded pride and real love."

The smile he gave her was heartbreaking.

Suddenly, Nathan felt hollow. As if someone had taken the mountain of love in his chest and brushed it away like dust.
###Chapter 527

Nathan Blackwood had always prided himself on his ironclad self-control.

But Evelyn Sinclair was the exception.

His feelings for her only grew stronger with each passing day. It was an addiction he couldn’t shake—one he didn’t want to shake.

Maybe, in those five years apart, she had quietly taken root in his heart without him realizing it. Now, that seed had grown into something unignorable—a towering tree with roots too deep to tear out.

He couldn’t pretend anymore.

Evelyn frowned, about to speak, when the executives on the other side of the room suddenly erupted.

"Come back! Who won?"

"It has to be President Sinclair. She won two out of three rounds!"

"With President Blackwood’s temper, there’s no way he’d let her win the third. Since when does he chase a woman like this?"

"Exactly. Congratulations, President Sinclair!"

She didn’t bother correcting them.

Evelyn and Nathan returned one after the other.

"Congratulations on your victory, President Sinclair!"

She leveled them with a look. "President Blackwood won the third round."

Silence.

Confused glances were exchanged.

Why wasn’t he following the usual playbook?

Nathan didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was that he had won.

Alexander Sterling handed Evelyn a towel, wiping the sweat from her brow before shooting Nathan a knowing smirk.

"President Blackwood, you really went all out in the final round."

Nathan took a long drink of water before answering bluntly, "If I want Evelyn, I have to fight for her."

The room collectively held its breath.

This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.

He should’ve let her win. Walked away gracefully. But no—Nathan had to claim victory.

Later, the group gathered for dinner, but Evelyn excused herself early, citing work.

The executives exchanged bewildered looks before dispersing, baffled.

Evelyn was exhausted. All she wanted was to go home and sleep.

Nathan’s request remained unanswered, but she didn’t care. She wouldn’t agree—not to something so unreasonable.

Just as she left the company, her phone buzzed.

Dominic Kingsley was calling.

Blackwood Industries

Nathan showered and changed, emerging in a noticeably better mood.

Harrison took the opportunity to brief him on a few thorny issues. Surprisingly, Nathan listened patiently, offering solutions without so much as a hint of irritation.

A knock interrupted them.

"President, Old Master Blackwood sent something for you."

Nathan raised a brow. What was his grandfather up to now?

"Let them in."

The secretary stepped aside, revealing a well-dressed woman standing timidly in the doorway.

Victoria Ashford.

"Mr. Blackwood, Old Master Blackwood thought you might be too busy to eat properly, so he asked me to bring you some soup."

Her voice was deliberately soft, masking the tension beneath.

Nathan’s expression instantly cooled.

"You’re still here?"

His tone was ice.

Initially, Margaret Blackwood had kept Victoria at the estate. But with Margaret gone, shouldn’t Victoria have left too?

Victoria paled, her smile faltering.

"Old Master Blackwood asked me to stay a few more days. I won’t be a bother."

The same old game.

Nathan’s gaze darkened, but he said nothing.

Harrison quickly took the soup from her hands, pouring a bowl for Nathan. "Thank you, Ms. Ashford."

Nathan clearly had no intention of continuing the conversation. Harrison hesitated, unsure whether to dismiss her.

But Victoria stepped forward, biting her lip before summoning her courage.

"Mr. Blackwood, I know I’m not as accomplished as Evelyn Sinclair, but I can work hard to become whoever you want me to be. Old Master Blackwood said I could learn a lot by your side. I’d like to be your secretary—"
###Chapter 528

Nathan Blackwood's eyes held a flicker of disdain. Evelyn Sinclair caught that fleeting expression, and it felt like a knife twisting in her chest.

Her breath hitched.

Nathan lifted his gaze to meet hers.

"The reason you were dismissed from Sterling Enterprises should be obvious. Blackwood Industries doesn't keep employees who can't even complete their probation. And let's be honest—don’t compare yourself to Evelyn. You’re from entirely different worlds."

The gap between them was as vast as the sky and the earth. What was there to compare?

His words were brutal, indifferent to whether they shattered Victoria Ashford’s pride. Her face drained of color.

Even Harrison, his assistant, felt a pang of sympathy for her.

Yet, instead of leaving, Victoria stood frozen, fists clenched, staring at Nathan with wounded eyes.

She realized—he knew. He knew she was an illegitimate daughter.

All those carefully crafted identities, those rehearsed conversations, meant nothing in the face of true nobility.

She had spent years pretending to be part of high society, but Nathan saw through her in an instant.

How could she ever dream of becoming Mrs. Blackwood?

The taunts from her past stabbed at her like needles. She bit her lip hard, on the verge of turning away—

When Harrison suddenly exclaimed, "Ms. Sterling? Mr. Kingsley?"

Evelyn and Dominic Kingsley had arrived at an inopportune moment. They had intended to leave, but it was too late.

They had heard enough—especially the part involving Evelyn.

Nathan’s expression shifted instantly. He stood and approached with a practiced smile.

"How fortunate to see you twice in one day."

The words were undeniably directed at Evelyn.

Dominic turned his head slightly, feeling like an invisible spectator.

Evelyn frowned and took a deliberate step back, maintaining distance.

"Mr. Kingsley mentioned urgent business. We need a meeting."

Nathan’s face smoothed into calm authority. He turned to Harrison. "Prepare the conference room."

"Understood."

Harrison set down his files, then hesitated, remembering Victoria still stood there. "Ms. Ashford, Mr. Blackwood has a meeting now. You should—"

Victoria was stunned, humiliated.

Evelyn wasn’t angry. She wasn’t mocking. Her indifference was worse—it made Victoria feel like she didn’t even warrant a reaction.

As she turned to leave, a sleek Porsche pulled up outside. A sharply dressed man stepped out and opened the passenger door for Evelyn.

The tenderness in his gaze was eerily similar to Nathan’s.

Evelyn slid into the car.

"I’ll need your help with this issue. Our team in Europe can’t contain the public backlash alone. At the very least, we should keep this quiet until the investigation is complete."

With Preston Sinclair’s influence, controlling European media and stock markets was effortless.

Preston nodded as he drove.

"Consider it done. I’ll have my contacts monitor the situation and suppress any damaging leaks."

Evelyn smiled. "Thank you. Let me treat you to dinner."

Preston chuckled. "I’m flattered you thought of me. But… just dinner?"
###Chapter 529

Evelyn noticed Victoria's icy demeanor and felt a pang in her chest.

Her fingers tightened around the fabric of her skirt as she suppressed her emotions.

Nathan's eyes had only warmed when Evelyn entered the room.

But Victoria wasn't ready to admit defeat and slink away like some pathetic loser.

As long as Nathan and Evelyn weren't married, there was still hope.

Even as an illegitimate daughter and imposter, being recognized by the Ashford family made her their Second Young Lady.

Victoria inhaled sharply before turning pleading eyes to Harrison. "May I use Mr. Blackwood's private washroom to freshen up?"

She needed to stay until Evelyn left. If Nathan saw her in his office, he couldn't possibly ignore her.

Harrison shifted uncomfortably. "I'm afraid that's not possible. President Blackwood's private spaces are strictly off-limits. Perhaps you could use the facilities in the lobby, Ms. Ashford?"

Victoria froze, stunned by the rejection.

Her face flushed crimson before settling into an ashen pallor. Forcing a brittle smile, she nodded and hurried away.

In the conference room...

Dominic couldn't resist teasing Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood, your popularity with women is impressive, but your rejection was brutal. How does anyone tolerate you?"

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, who remained impassive.

He exhaled sharply.

"If you feel sorry for her, take her home yourself."

Dominic rubbed his nose. "I'm a married man..."

Evelyn tapped the table sharply. "Let's focus. I have another appointment."

Dominic's expression turned serious. "The AI car chip we developed was sent to Europe, but there was an incident during the third test at the European Autopilot Research Institute."

The air grew heavy.

Nathan's eyes narrowed while Evelyn fixed Dominic with an intense stare.

This project was the flagship collaboration between their three companies. After pioneering AI in medicine, their follow-up research had drawn global attention.

Failure would be catastrophic.

Dominic handed a flash drive to Harrison, who quickly projected the data.

The test footage showed initial excitement turning to stunned silence. Everything proceeded perfectly until...

The vehicle completed a flawless right-angle turn before suddenly careening into an abandoned factory wall.

Smoke obscured panicked shouts as the car crumpled against concrete. The collapsing structure buried the vehicle and researcher beneath debris.

The video froze on that horrifying final frame.

Evelyn's breath caught. She whirled toward Dominic.

"Casualties?"

Dominic's face was grim. "The researcher survived but remains hospitalized. European public opinion has turned against us. The backlash could be devastating."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Cause?"

Evelyn leaned forward.

Dominic explained, "The test vehicle was entirely AI-controlled with no manual override. Human error is impossible. The chip is clearly defective, but European authorities have seized it for investigation. Access will be difficult."

Evelyn exchanged glances with Nathan, whose jaw tightened. "I'll handle this. If the chip's faulty..."
###Chapter 530

The world held a love-hate relationship with artificial intelligence. It simplified lives yet carried hidden dangers.

Unlike humans, AI lacked emotions. It couldn't see beauty or hear music.

Cold calculations, data processing, and logical optimization created these brilliant yet heartless silicon minds. One malfunction could spell disaster.

This explained why autonomous vehicles never gained mass adoption despite their potential.

People trusted human error over machine perfection.

A single accident, even with 99.99% safety records, could shatter public confidence overnight.

Dominic Kingsley's voice grew solemn. "We're not pioneers in this field, but our technology surpasses all competitors. Our AI responds faster, learns quicker, and performs better. Yet we must prepare for failure. Do we halt now or see this through?"

The evidence pointed to a 90% probability of chip failure.

Public backlash would crash their stocks, creating ripple effects across all business divisions.

Evelyn Sinclair tapped her chin thoughtfully. "We proceed. Autonomous vehicles are inevitable. Even if we fail repeatedly, we can't forfeit our place in the future. Someone will succeed eventually - why not us?"

Nathan Blackwood and Dominic exchanged glances.

They'd been weighing risk versus reward. Terminating the project seemed the safer choice.

Yet abandoning their efforts felt like surrender.

Evelyn showed no hesitation. Her vision stretched further, her mindset bolder. Her conviction electrified the room, leaving no room for debate.

This potential loss meant nothing compared to missing the opportunity.

Dominic regarded Evelyn with newfound respect. "If someone must succeed, it should be us."

Nathan's gaze lingered on Evelyn, admiration flashing in his eyes. Only Evelyn Sinclair could inspire such confidence.

His lips curved slightly. "Then it's settled. I'll contact our European team to investigate the chip malfunction. Dominic, send two specialists as backup."

Dominic nodded.

Evelyn rested her chin on interlaced fingers. "I'll trace the chip's journey to Europe. Every person who handled it, every checkpoint it passed through - both here and abroad."

What if this wasn't technical failure but sabotage?

The first two trials had proceeded flawlessly.

Nathan checked his watch and straightened. "It's late. Join me for dinner?"

Evelyn gathered her files. "Prior engagement. Goodnight." She exited before anyone could respond.

The silence stretched awkwardly.

Nathan's smile faded. His eyes darkened for a heartbeat. "I'm busy. Take Harrison instead."

Dominic barely suppressed a laugh.

Nathan wasn't even pretending to be polite.

Harrison shifted uncomfortably. "Actually, sir, I have plans tonight—"

Dominic chuckled. "That comment about not dating trashy women was profound, Nathan. Pity classy women won't dine with you either."

The unspoken jab hung in the air: Evelyn wasn't like Victoria Ashford. She didn't crave Nathan's attention.

Nathan's expression hardened. His icy stare pinned Dominic in place. "If you've energy for jokes, focus it on damage control."

Dominic's amusement vanished.

The mood turned sober instantly.
###Chapter 531

Disgusting

No one dared to mock Nathan Blackwood.

Public opinion and the stock market would spiral out of control in the coming days. While they still had some influence domestically, once the media in Europe caught wind of the research scandal in Montecito, the consequences wouldn't just be financial losses for the three companies involved.

It would tarnish Montecito's reputation. When government agencies stepped in, the situation would only become more complicated—restrictions would tighten, making it harder to maneuver.

"Nathan—"

Dominic Kingsley stared at Nathan, speechless, as the latter stood abruptly, his expression dark, and stormed out of the conference room.

Harrison, gathering his files from the side, shook his head.

Nathan had never tolerated humiliation from anyone. His confidence was unshakable.

Evelyn Sinclair arrived at the entrance of Blackwood Industries and spotted Victoria Ashford standing there.

She looked like she was waiting—specifically, waiting for Evelyn.

The panic beneath her forced composure was painfully obvious.

Evelyn frowned and approached. "Were you waiting for me?"

Victoria nodded, her eyes slightly red, feigning vulnerability.

Evelyn glanced down, typing a quick message on her phone before looking back up. "What do you want?"

Whether in the office or outside, her attitude toward Victoria had always been cold.

Evelyn couldn’t bring herself to like her. They weren’t the same kind of people, and she had no interest in pretending otherwise.

Victoria took a deep breath, her gaze lingering on Evelyn’s impeccably tailored suit—a custom piece from a luxury brand Victoria could never afford.

"Ms. Sinclair, Old Master Blackwood insisted I stay to take care of Nathan. I’m in a difficult position..."

She paused, studying Evelyn’s indifferent expression before continuing, "I know Nathan only loves you, but for my family’s sake, I can’t refuse. But... if you’re unhappy, or if you want to reconcile with him, I’m willing to step aside."

Evelyn lifted her eyes, her fingers pausing mid-scroll on her phone.

Victoria’s tension was palpable as she scrutinized Evelyn’s reaction.

Her face paled.

Evelyn lowered her phone, tucking it behind her back. She regarded Victoria with icy detachment.

"Ms. Ashford, I used to pity you. Your family’s misfortunes and your struggles seemed tragic. I even helped you twice before. But you should understand—the reason you and Nathan aren’t together isn’t because of me. It’s because of your own incompetence."

Victoria’s face drained of color.

Evelyn’s phone rang.

She declined the call without hesitation.

Then, she continued, "But from now on, I’ve started to truly despise you. Every word out of your mouth is fake. So fake it’s disgusting. You’re neither innocent nor pure, and you don’t need to rely on that pitiful act to survive."

Her phone rang again. She answered it and walked away.

"I’m at the entrance."

Victoria stiffened as if she’d been slapped. Her cheeks burned with humiliation.

She stood frozen, stunned and terrified.

Evelyn hadn’t been angry or mocking. Her calm dismissal was worse—it made Victoria feel insignificant.

That kind of indifference was lethal.

Turning, Victoria watched as a sleek, understated Porsche pulled up. A sharply dressed man stepped out and opened the passenger door for Evelyn.

The tender look in his eyes was eerily similar to Nathan’s.

Evelyn slid into the car. "I’ll need your help with this incident. Our team in Europe won’t be enough to contain the backlash. The fewer people who know, the better."

With Preston Sinclair’s connections, controlling European media and stock market reactions was effortless.

Preston nodded as he drove.

"Understood. I’ll have my contacts monitor the situation and suppress the news."

Evelyn smiled. "Thank you. Let me treat you to dinner."

Preston chuckled softly. "I’m flattered you thought of me. But... just dinner?"
###Chapter 532

Evelyn froze as Preston's gaze flickered. "Oliver hasn't stopped talking about you."

His deep voice carried a hint of amusement. "Why don't you cook for him as a thank you?"

Relief washed over her. "Of course!"

Little Oliver practically vibrated with excitement when he heard the news.

The nanny hesitated. "Shouldn't we wait at the hotel?"

The bodyguard crossed his arms. "Absolutely not. Leaving two adults alone together? Something will happen."

Oliver nodded vigorously, insisting on tagging along to the supermarket.

The moment he stepped out of the car, he spotted Evelyn and Preston standing close, laughing. Preston casually bought an ice cream and handed it to her. She accepted with a smile, taking a bite before nodding in approval.

The nanny sighed dreamily. "Such a perfect pair—talented and gorgeous."

The bodyguard shot her a glare. "Whose side are you on? The young master suits her better!"

Oliver beamed. "Exactly!"

He dashed forward, burying his face in Evelyn's arms. She smells like sunshine and vanilla.

"Miss Evelyn, did you miss me?"

Her heart melted at the sight of his fluffy curls. She ruffled his hair, grinning. "Of course I did. So much."

Satisfied, Oliver peeked at his father, eyes gleaming with mischief. See? You can't do this.

Preston's jaw tightened. He reached out, yanking his son away.

Daddy’s jealous! Oliver stuck out his tongue. "Miss Evelyn likes my hugs!"

Evelyn laughed. Their bickering was endlessly entertaining.

"Alright, let’s go. What do you want to eat, Oliver?"

He scrunched his face in thought. Something too simple wouldn’t impress her, but too complicated might backfire. Tricky.

Evelyn, meanwhile, scanned the aisles nervously. It had been ages since she cooked. Too easy, and it wouldn’t show sincerity. Too hard, and she might ruin it. Ugh.

Their presence in the mall drew stares.

"That man is devastatingly handsome. What a picture-perfect family!"

"The little boy looks mixed—adorable!"

"That woman seems familiar. Stunning, really."

Preston’s expression softened slightly at the murmurs. His dark eyes lingered on Evelyn, patient and warm.

Oliver huffed. Family? Please. Miss Evelyn and I are the real pair. Daddy’s too old for her!

In the meat section, Evelyn hesitated. Preston noticed instantly.

"Steak sounds good," he suggested smoothly.

She exhaled in relief, glancing down. "Oliver?"

He grinned. "Love steak!"

After gathering ingredients, they returned to Preston’s hotel suite.

Oliver happily devoured his ice cream in the living room while Preston took a quick work call. When he finally joined Evelyn in the kitchen, she was focused on seasoning the steak, unaware of his approach.

Rolling up his sleeves, Preston moved beside her. "I’ll handle the sides."

His usual icy demeanor was gone, replaced by effortless charm.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Distracted, she didn’t notice the sizzling oil until it splattered onto her wrist. She gasped, stumbling back—right into Preston’s firm embrace.
###Chapter 533

Evelyn's thoughts drifted for a moment as she stood in the kitchen.

The atmosphere between her and Preston held an unspoken tension that somehow felt comforting.

Wasn't this the kind of domestic warmth she had once imagined before her divorce?

Except now, it wasn't Nathan standing beside her—it was Preston. And strangely, the past didn't ache as sharply anymore.

A sudden sting on her wrist snapped her back to reality. Preston immediately took her hand, guiding it under the cool stream of the faucet.

Their closeness was undeniable, their bodies nearly touching. She tried to pull away, but Preston mistook it for pain and only held her more gently.

His fingers traced the reddened skin before he lifted her wrist to his lips, blowing softly over the burn.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

The man before her was unexpectedly tender, his concern genuine.

Her pulse fluttered.

She quickly lowered her gaze, withdrawing her hand with a faint smile. "It's fine. It doesn't hurt anymore."

She masked the unease in her chest.

The burn was minor—just a drop of oil that had left a faint mark on her fair skin.

Preston's frown deepened, guilt flashing in his eyes.

"I shouldn't have let you cook." His voice was rough with regret.

Before she could protest, he took her wrist again, leading her out of the kitchen with firm insistence.

Evelyn exhaled softly.

In the past, she had endured worse burns without complaint. Cooking had been her labor of love—every meal painstakingly prepared for Nathan.

He had never noticed.

"What happened to Pretty Lady?"

Little Oliver hurried over, glaring accusingly at his father, who still held Evelyn's hand.

She sat on the sofa. "It's nothing. Just a small burn. But the kitchen—"

The steak was going to char.

Preston pressed a hand to her shoulder. "Someone else will handle it. Don't move."

Evelyn bit her lip. She had been asked to cook, only to make a mess of it.

A maid appeared discreetly, finishing what Evelyn had started without a word.

Preston returned with a first-aid kit, intent on applying the ointment himself.

Oliver hovered anxiously, staring at the red mark.

Evelyn almost laughed. "I can do it myself."

"You don't trust me, Ms. Sinclair?"

She shook her head. "It really doesn't hurt anymore."

Just a faint tingle—nothing worth fussing over.

Preston ignored her protest, placing her hand on his knee. They sat close enough that she could feel his warmth.

He dipped his fingers into the salve—imported, judging by the packaging—and smoothed it over her skin. The cooling sensation soothed the burn instantly.

But when the ointment faded, Preston still hadn't let go.

His touch lingered, sending an unfamiliar shiver through her.

She stiffened, lowering her lashes to hide the flicker of emotion. If she stayed like this any longer, she might—

"Daddy, why won't you let go?"

Oliver's voice shattered the quiet.

The tension dissolved.

Evelyn almost laughed at the boy's bluntness.

"Pretty Lady, does it still hurt?" Oliver continued, oblivious. "Daddy knows how to take care of girls. If you're uncomfortable, just say so."

Silence.

The moment was gone.

Preston's grip tightened imperceptibly before he released her, shooting his son a look that promised retribution.

Perhaps it had been too long since he'd disciplined the boy.
###Chapter 534

Evelyn Sinclair pressed her lips together, withdrawing her hand instinctively. "It doesn't hurt anymore."

She studied Preston Sinclair's face, the faint irritation in his expression making the conflict in her chest dissolve.

Oliver Sinclair had reminded her—Preston was an extraordinary man. Of course, countless people would orbit around him. Evelyn knew nothing about him except the whispers of his late ex-wife. How could she entertain thoughts of him like some naive schoolgirl?

She straightened her posture and returned to her senses, refusing to linger.

Preston set down the first-aid kit with deliberate precision. With Evelyn present, he couldn't reprimand his son as he wanted. So he maintained a composed smile—one that held no warmth.

His gaze shifted back to her, patient but distant. "That's impossible. My family physician in Pacifica was notoriously unreliable. I had to learn first aid out of necessity."

Evelyn offered a polite, detached smile. "Really, it's fine. The ointment worked wonders."

Preston stiffened, lowering his head briefly before meeting her eyes again, his expression unreadable. He picked up the ointment casually. "I'll go get your coat."

"You seem very prepared, Mr. Sinclair."

"I have a child. Preparedness is mandatory." His tone was light, but the pointed glance he shot Oliver carried a silent warning.

Oliver stuck out his tongue and ducked behind Evelyn. He wasn’t blind—he’d noticed his father’s sharp attitude toward the woman he adored. If this kept up, he’d be stuck with a stepmother he didn’t want!

After dinner, Evelyn made her exit.

Preston insisted on driving her back to Sterling Manor, stopping a respectful distance away. The night air was crisp, the glow of streetlights stretching their shadows across the pavement.

"Don’t worry about the media or the stock market," Preston said. "Nothing will escalate until the investigation concludes."

"Thank you."

"You’ve thanked me enough."

Evelyn met his eyes. "Mr. Sinclair, there’s a piece of land in the Capital. Are you interested?"

His gaze darkened, his expression tightening. "What are you implying?"

"As repayment."

A repayment that would sever whatever fragile connection existed between them.

Preston exhaled slowly, the silence stretching between them.

"Ms. Sterling," he murmured, "chasing you is difficult enough. But not chasing you? That’s even harder."

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his unwavering stare. His smile was faint, blending into the night, his voice firm.

"Forget the land. A night like this is far more valuable."

After Preston left, Evelyn stepped inside, her emotions settling into stillness. She removed her coat and heels, heading to wash up when her phone buzzed.

Preston: [Chasing you is hard. Not chasing you is harder. Sweet dreams.]

She read it but didn’t reply.

The next message was from Nathan Blackwood. [Evelyn, there’s a package for you at home. Should I—]

She typed back without hesitation. [No. Throw it out.]

Then she powered off her phone and prepared for bed.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the office early, her mind still fixated on the autopilot incident. Time was running out.

Emily Whitaker had been sent to Europe—a decision that eased Evelyn’s concerns. Emily was an expert.

But insider reports suggested European regulators were considering pulling the AI chip from the market. The situation was growing dire.

During the video conference, both Evelyn and Nathan participated.

The meeting room was frigid, the air conditioning set too low. Nathan noticed Evelyn’s thin dress and moved to drape his suit jacket over her shoulders.

She didn’t flinch. "I don’t want it. Save your chivalry."

Nathan and the others in the room fell silent.
###Chapter 535

The staff quickly noticed the tense atmosphere and discreetly adjusted the air conditioning.

The temperature in the conference room rose to a more comfortable level.

On the massive screen, an AI-driven car and a manually operated vehicle raced side by side, both equipped with identical chips and systems from the same manufacturer.

The AI vehicle displayed remarkable adaptability across various terrains—whether navigating steep mountain roads or uneven waterways.

It decelerated smoothly at traffic lights.

It slowed down for sudden road hazards.

It maneuvered effortlessly around obstacles.

It waited patiently for pedestrians.

In emergencies, its automatic braking system activated flawlessly.

Precise. Controlled. Yet dynamic.

The AI car demonstrated every advantage of human-like driving, even overcoming sudden deceleration caused by human error with perfect agility.

In simulations, its performance was flawless.

But in this real-world test, something had gone wrong.

Every attendee scrutinized the data, unwilling to miss even the slightest anomaly.

Evelyn Sinclair leaned forward, her sharp gaze locked onto the screen.

Something was off.

Yet all indicators remained within normal parameters.

Across the table, Nathan Blackwood studied Evelyn briefly before shifting his attention back to the footage.

His dark eyes were unreadable, his expression grim as he analyzed both the demonstration and the records of the malfunctioning vehicle.

Silence weighed heavily in the room. The crash from the video served as a brutal reminder of what was at stake.

The same incident had occurred in Europe.

When the footage ended, someone from the European team broke the silence. "Did anyone spot the issue?"

No one answered.

Evelyn tapped the table. "Emily Whitaker, your analysis?"

She addressed the lead AI scientist, whose expertise was undisputed in this field.

Emily responded without hesitation. "The chip's performance metrics are optimal, operating within the 0-1 response range. Thirty seconds before impact, the system issued a turn command. Ten seconds prior, it ordered an emergency stop."

Her voice remained steady. "Yet the vehicle still lost control."

A man scoffed. "That’s a whole lot of technical jargon to say nothing. If the AI controls the car, then the system must be at fault."

Another executive chimed in. "If everything was functioning perfectly, why did the crash happen?"

Tensions escalated.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her patience thinning. She glanced at Nathan, whose jaw was clenched in silent frustration.

If he wasn’t speaking yet, it meant he was still processing.

She cut through the noise, her voice sharp. "Gentlemen, we’re here to determine the cause, not debate hypotheticals."

The room quieted.

Evelyn pressed on. "Emily, are you certain the AI system isn’t responsible?"

Emily hesitated only briefly. "Absolutely."

Murmurs of disbelief followed.

If the technology wasn’t to blame—then what was?
###Chapter 536

Evelyn Sinclair pressed her lips together and lifted her gaze, meeting Nathan Blackwood's piercing stare.

Their smiles collided at the same moment. His voice was ice. "Since the system data and chip records are both minimal, there's only one anomaly left."

The room held its breath, tension thick.

"The test car," Nathan declared.

Silence swallowed the space. The team exchanged stunned glances—some had suspected, but none had dared voice it.

Dominic Kingsley frowned. "What could be wrong with the car?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "It was custom-built, but the components interfacing with the AI system were outsourced to another company. Did anyone verify them?"

No one answered.

Yet the truth was undeniable—a flaw had been buried in the metadata. Nathan dismissed the meeting immediately.

Evelyn's eyes never left his face. She didn't speak, but their thoughts aligned perfectly.

She hadn’t expected Nathan to reach the same conclusion.

Evelyn arched a brow. "It's the brakes."

Nathan nodded. "Liberty Tech."

She exhaled sharply. Obviously.

Standing, she felt the weight lift—like storm clouds parting for sunlight.

Dominic cleared his throat. "Let's grab dinner."

Evelyn shot him a dry look. "How many rejections before you realize I don’t want to eat with you?"

Nathan froze, then smirked. "I don’t take hints."

She was already walking away.

Days later, Dominic returned with the report.

As predicted, the AI was flawless.

The brakes were the problem.

Liberty Tech's "cutting-edge" braking system—touted as revolutionary—had been installed in luxury vehicles worldwide.

Given the autopilot's stellar track record, every component had been top-tier. No one questioned the choice.

Until now.

Dominic stormed into Blackwood Industries, slamming the documents onto Nathan’s desk. His usual calm had shattered.

Nathan barely glanced up. "You should rest."

"Rest?" Dominic scoffed. "Liberty Tech’s system has caused over a hundred accidents. Every lawsuit was buried. Every whistleblower silenced."

Nathan’s voice was dangerously soft. "And when you confronted them?"

Dominic’s laugh was bitter. "They blamed our AI. They think money can bury this forever." He reached for his phone. "I’m calling Evelyn."

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Don’t."
###Chapter 537

The office fell into heavy silence.

Nathan Blackwood lifted his gaze to meet Dominic Kingsley's bewildered stare.

"I've already conducted thorough investigations on that company." Nathan's voice cut through the tension. "They're backed by Pacifica's political elite, with shareholders spanning global business leaders."

His fingers tapped the mahogany desk. "Don't engage them directly. And keep Evelyn out of this. I'll handle it personally."

Dominic's expression darkened instantly.

For several seconds, neither man spoke. Finally, Dominic broke the silence. "This rival firm has formidable momentum and complex funding sources. Yet you dismiss them so easily?" His voice carried an edge of disbelief.

Having worked with Nathan for years, Dominic knew his capabilities ran deeper than media portrayals. Nathan's investments in Kingsley Tech had begun as mere interest in Dominic's resilient R&D team and their groundbreaking innovations.

Initially, Nathan had simply observed Kingsley Tech's growth potential. What surprised Dominic was discovering Nathan had simultaneously invested in their direct competitor.

Through brutal corporate battles, Kingsley Tech emerged victorious - a testament to Dominic's leadership. This journey had given Dominic rare insight into Nathan's strategic mind.

They'd fought side by side in cutthroat business wars, where Nathan's ability to discard prejudices and adapt strategies placed him leagues ahead. His influence extended internationally - making his apparent disregard for Pacifica Tech's rapid advancement inexplicable.

More puzzling was Nathan's insistence on keeping Evelyn uninformed. What was he hiding?

Dominic's probing stare made Nathan's expression turn glacial. An oppressive aura enveloped him.

"You think money motivates me?" Nathan's laugh held no warmth. "If I wanted to invest abroad, Kingsley Tech wouldn't exist today." His words carried the finality of a guillotine drop.

The temperature between them plummeted. Dominic suddenly remembered Nathan's military background - making such suspicions a grave insult. How had he dared question Nathan's integrity?

Regret flooded Dominic instantly. Before Harrison could usher him out, Dominic managed a stiff apology. "My mistake, Nathan. That was... beneath us."

Alone in his office, Nathan's gaze turned distant. Dominic was an exceptional CEO and researcher - their partnership shouldn't fracture over words. Yet the chill remained.

His thoughts drifted to Evelyn. She wouldn't have doubted him. Her loyalty to principles and people she trusted was absolute. The realization made his chest tighten.

Days without seeing her had become unbearable. This craving felt like addiction - one he restrained, fearing to overwhelm her. Recent circumstances kept them apart. Perhaps he needed to... engineer a meeting.

When Harrison entered with reports, he hesitated at Nathan's stormy expression. Finishing his presentation with trepidation, Harrison braced for reprimand.

Instead, Nathan stroked his chin thoughtfully. "What's Evelyn Sinclair been occupied with lately?" The question caught Harrison off-guard, his relief palpable.
###Chapter 538

Evelyn Sinclair was meticulously investigating the accident's cause. She'd also been tracking Sterling Enterprises' internal deadlines, but since it involved corporate secrets, she hadn't authorized any deep investigations.

Nathan Blackwood responded with a noncommittal hum, his expression unreadable.

Harrison considered for a moment before adding, "Ms. Sinclair has dinner plans with several partners at Celestial Club tonight."

Celestial Club was Blackwood Industries' exclusive nightspot, accessible only to carefully vetted members. This exclusivity ensured Harrison always received reliable intel.

That evening, Evelyn arrived at Celestial Club as scheduled.

The venue catered to elite business circles with its unparalleled privacy. Starting prices of seven figures per night made it inaccessible to most.

Her distinguished guests were industry leaders. Since they intended to indulge freely, they'd chosen this discreet location to avoid prying eyes.

Representing her absent brother, Evelyn paid little attention to the venue itself. Most attendees had already gathered when she entered the reserved private room.

A practiced, approachable smile graced her lips as she crossed the threshold.

The group greeted her warmly. Evelyn wasted no time taking the head seat and diving straight into business matters.

"Your dedication this past year is appreciated. May our future collaborations continue with mutual trust and unity!"

She downed her wine in one go, then signaled the staff to refill her glass with juice. Observing this, no one dared pressure her to drink more. The table erupted in polite toasts and conversation, all carefully calibrated not to offend.

Had this been any other woman, she might have been treated as mere decoration - subject to wandering hands and crude jokes. But this was the Sterling heiress, CEO of Sterling Enterprises. Not a soul dared show her disrespect.

Through the prolonged small talk, Evelyn remained composed, interjecting occasionally. Her demeanor struck the perfect balance between approachable and authoritative as she discussed partnership specifics with neighboring guests.

Her phone's vibration provided a welcome interruption.

Stepping outside for both the call and fresh air, Evelyn passed a slightly ajar door on her return. Light spilled into the hallway as a distressingly familiar voice reached her ears.

"Please, Mr. Moretti, I can't drink anymore... I beg you..."

The tearful plea belonged unmistakably to Victoria Ashford.

Mr. Moretti? Had Victoria sunk so low?

Evelyn considered walking away when a loud crash followed by drunken male laughter froze her in place.

"You begged for this meeting, Ms. Ashford! Now you're ruining my fun? Drink this or kiss your Sterling contract goodbye. You know the stakes."

Recognition dawned - Moretti was the partner she'd poached from Ashford Group. Hesitation gripped her until someone suddenly lunged toward the doorway.

Victoria's wine-flushed face appeared, tear-streaked and desperate. Spotting Evelyn, her bloodshot eyes widened before she seized Evelyn's arm, dragging her inside.

"Ms. Sterling! Please help me - I can't take another drop..."

Her anguished plea made it seem Evelyn, not Moretti, was her tormentor.

Evelyn's expression frosted over as she withdrew her arm. Her icy gaze shifted to the room's occupant. Moretti, thoroughly inebriated, failed to recognize her.

"Who's this beauty? Not bad, not bad at all." His drunken leer traveled Evelyn's frame. "You look familiar... some actress?"
###Chapter 539

Evelyn Sinclair's expression darkened as she turned to leave. The room reeked of desperation and cheap liquor.

Behind her, Victoria Ashford lunged forward with drunken clumsiness, her fingers clutching at Evelyn's sleeve.

"Don't go, Ms. Sterling! Please!" Victoria's voice was thick with desperation. "You don’t understand—I’m about to be disowned by the Ashfords because Sterling Enterprises took that contract from Ashford Group. My family will destroy me if I don’t get it back!"

Evelyn sidestepped, her voice icy. "I warned you before. Actions have consequences. Unless there’s a greater benefit, Sterling Enterprises won’t sacrifice its interests just because I pity someone."

Her logic was unshakable. She knew exactly what Victoria was trying to do—convince Vincent Moretti to break the contract.

If they succeeded, fine. But not at Sterling’s expense.

Victoria’s lips trembled, despair flooding her eyes. "To you, it’s just a simple favor. Why are you pushing me into a corner?" Her voice cracked, raw with emotion.

Evelyn stared at her, unimpressed. Victoria had walked herself into this mess. Why should Evelyn clean it up?

She wasn’t running a charity.

On the sofa, Vincent Moretti staggered to his feet, a glass of wine in his hand. "Come on, have a drink."

Victoria recoiled, fear flashing in her eyes. She knew that wine wasn’t ordinary.

"No, Mr. Moretti, I—I can’t drink anymore..."

He snorted, his gaze sliding to Evelyn with a leer. "If you won’t drink, then let the new celebrity do it. If she drinks for you, I’ll consider breaking the contract with Sterling. How’s that sound?"

Victoria’s face lit up with hope.

She turned to Evelyn, hands clasped in pleading. "Ms. Sterling, it’s just one glass. What’s the harm?"

Evelyn arched a brow, amusement laced with frost. "Drink for you? How bold. No one has ever dared ask me that before."

She moved toward the door, disgusted.

But Victoria was like a persistent shadow, slamming her back against the exit, blocking Evelyn’s path.

Her eyes were wild, her face flushed with desperation. "Just one glass! That’s all I’m asking! If I don’t get that contract back, I’m ruined! You did this to me—don’t you feel guilty at all?"

Evelyn’s patience snapped.

Behind her, Vincent lurched forward, his hand reaching for her shoulder.

She twisted away, her knee driving upward with brutal precision.

A sharp scream tore from his throat as he crumpled, his face draining of color.

Evelyn turned to Victoria, whose expression had gone slack with horror.

"Mr. Moretti—Ms. Sterling, you’ve gone too far!"
###Chapter 540

The door burst open before Evelyn could throw the woman out.

Victoria Ashford tumbled to the floor with a startled cry.

A tall, imposing figure filled the doorway. Nathan Blackwood's sharp features looked even more severe in the dim light, his dark eyes scanning the room. When his gaze landed on Evelyn, unharmed, the tension in his jaw eased—only to tighten again when he took in the scene.

Victoria sprawled on the ground, reeking of alcohol, clutching Evelyn’s skirt. Behind her, Vincent Moretti writhed in pain.

Nathan’s arrival shattered Victoria’s drunken haze.

She hadn’t been kicked out of the Blackwood estate yet because Reginald Blackwood still held onto hope for her. They were waiting for the right moment.

But the pressure from Reginald Ashford and Penelope Ashford had become unbearable. Desperate, she’d dragged Vincent here to scheme—to reclaim the contract, to keep the Ashfords’ support.

She needed an escape.

And she knew exactly who held Nathan’s heart.

Victoria’s intoxication vanished instantly. But she played her part, feigning unconsciousness. "No more... I can’t drink..."

A cold aura surrounded Evelyn as she yanked her skirt free in disgust.

Nathan moved like lightning. His foot connected with Victoria’s shoulder—hard. She bit back a scream, forcing herself to stay limp.

His voice was deceptively calm when he spoke to Evelyn. "Did they touch you? What happened?"

Evelyn glanced down, then back up, unimpressed. "They wanted me to drink. I refused. Funny, isn’t it? The future Mrs. Blackwood, out here drinking with another man—just for a contract."

She stepped over Victoria without a second glance and walked out.

This wasn’t over. Whether Nathan intervened or not, Victoria had sealed her fate. Evelyn wouldn’t let this slide.

Nathan’s expression darkened as he pulled out his phone. "Bring two crates of whiskey upstairs."

Three minutes later, bodyguards arrived with the liquor.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

Nathan’s voice was ice. "Since they love drinking so much, give each of them a crate. They leave when it’s gone. Not a drop wasted."

The bodyguards obeyed without hesitation.

Nathan’s gaze flicked to the shattered glass near Vincent. His jaw clenched. He knew exactly what kind of game these people played.

If Evelyn had taken even a sip—

That man wouldn’t live to see dawn.

A bodyguard grabbed Victoria’s hair, forcing her head back as he poured whiskey down her throat.

She couldn’t pretend anymore.

She choked, sobbing, trembling. This was Nathan’s cruelty—the side he never showed Evelyn.

"Please—I didn’t do anything! Mr. Blackwood, if Reginald finds out—"

Nathan didn’t react. His eyes were merciless.

Did she really think Reginald’s disapproval mattered?

Pathetic.

Without another word, he turned and walked away. The screams behind him didn’t make him pause. Not even for a second.
###Chapter 541

Evelyn Sinclair stood by her doorway, phone pressed to her ear, her expression darkening with every word.

Nathan Blackwood stepped out just in time to catch the tension in her posture. He didn’t approach immediately, giving her space—six feet of it—like the gentleman he pretended to be.

The distance was close enough to hear her clipped tone.

"Yes," Evelyn said, her voice sharp. "Pull all business ties with Ashford Group immediately. I don’t care about the financial loss."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. If Evelyn was this furious, Victoria Ashford and Vincent Moretti had done more than just pressure her into drinking.

Forcing alcohol was one thing. Humiliation was another.

When she ended the call, her gaze flicked to him, cold and unreadable.

"Bad night?" he asked, stepping closer.

He reached out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear, but she tilted her head away before his fingers could graze her skin.

His lips curved into a humorless smile. "Don’t worry. I won’t let anyone get away with disrespecting you."

"Save your concern, Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn’s heels clicked against the marble as she turned, dismissing him with a glance before striding back into the room. She bid a curt farewell to the remaining guests and left the venue without another word.

The evening had been a disaster.

Nathan followed silently, frustration simmering beneath his calm exterior. He’d hoped for a chance encounter, something meaningful—not this mess.

But those who crossed Evelyn would regret it.

Outside, she waited by the curb, arms wrapped around herself as the wind bit through her dress. Her car had broken down earlier, and her backup driver hadn’t arrived yet.

Nathan approached, the faint scent of her perfume—something floral and expensive—lingering in the air between them.

"Need a ride?" he offered.

She didn’t look at him. "I’m fine."

"Still owe me that one condition," he reminded her, voice low.

Evelyn finally turned, lips quirking in amusement. "Is driving me home your grand demand?"

If it was, he’d severely undersold himself.

His jaw ticked. "Of course not."

He’d brought it up to keep her compliant, but he’d forgotten—Evelyn hadn’t obeyed him in years.

Her smile was all sharp edges. "Let me know when you think of something worthwhile."

Nathan gestured to the Rolls-Royce idling nearby, sleek and black, a perfect match for his status.

"You’ll freeze out here," he said. "Unless you’re afraid I’ll kidnap you?"

Evelyn arched a brow, then offered him a deliberately insincere smile. "Fine. I’ll take your offer."

Relief flickered through him.

The driver wasn’t his usual chauffeur, though—it was Theodore Winslow, his ever-meddling butler.

Theodore beamed at Evelyn from the front seat. "Ms. Sinclair, this car was specially chosen to match your standards. I hope it meets your approval."

Evelyn’s lips curved—just slightly—but it was enough. "Good job, Theo."

Nathan’s mood darkened. She’d smiled at Theodore?

He leaned back, shooting his butler a warning glare through the rearview mirror. Theodore stiffened, gripping the wheel tighter as he pulled onto the road.

Silence stretched for half the ride before the car lurched to a stop.

Both passengers turned to Theodore.

He scratched his head. "Ah. Seems we’ve got engine trouble. Might take a while to fix."

Nathan frowned. This car was brand new.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Did our cars conspire to die on the same night?"

Theodore coughed. "We’re closer to Highland Estates. Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you and Ms. Sinclair could walk the rest of the way?"

The man was obvious.

A long night. Empty streets. Starlight and streetlamps. No interruptions.

The perfect setup for a heart-to-heart.

Theodore’s hopeful grin in the mirror said it all.
###Chapter 542

Nathan's expression shifted instantly.

The storm in his dark eyes cleared as he turned to Evelyn with hopeful anticipation.

But Evelyn simply pulled out her phone with practiced calm. She tapped open a messaging app, sent her current location to someone, then met their gazes evenly.

"My brother Lucas will be here shortly. You don't mind if I wait in the car for a few minutes, do you? It's freezing outside."

They expected her to walk back?

Were they trying to give her hypothermia?

Nathan remained silent, his heavy stare boring into Theodore.

Not only had their alone time been ruined, but he'd also lost the chance to drive her home!

Theodore was utterly useless!

Theodore ducked his head sheepishly, running his fingers along the car's interior. "This Rolls-Royce must cost a fortune to repair, huh?"

Less than ten minutes later.

Lucas's flashy sports car roared into view.

He stepped out lazily, gave the damaged Rolls-Royce a once-over, smirked, and sauntered over to rap mockingly on the window.

"All show and no go, huh? Couldn't even protect my sister properly."

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line as his icy gaze swept over them.

The unspoken challenge hung heavy in the air.

Lucas waved at Evelyn. "Time to go, little sis."

Evelyn exited the car without hesitation. She glanced back to see Nathan visibly restraining his anger, his expression bordering on wounded.

This man was becoming increasingly unpredictable.

"Have a safe trip back, Mr. Blackwood."

Her smile was glacial as she slid into Lucas's sports car. Immediately more relaxed, she draped her arm out the window, letting the wind rush through her fingers.

Lucas shot Nathan a wicked grin before they peeled away.

Inside the luxury Rolls-Royce, Nathan's face was thunderous.

He glared at Theodore. "What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation to drive?"

Theodore swallowed hard. "Sir, I genuinely broke the car!"

Early next morning at the Sterling Manor...

Alexander, freshly returned from his business trip, sat at the breakfast table.

"You want to acquire Ashford Group?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "I intend to."

Alexander's lips curved into an indulgent smile. His sister's bold declaration earned approving nods from others at the table.

William Sterling declared, "Excellent decision. We owe them no favors."

Alexander added, "Delegate the task. Your talents are better spent elsewhere."

Evelyn shook her head, her tone deceptively light. "I'll handle it personally. They brought this upon themselves by provoking me."

Alexander and William exchanged startled looks, but Lucas burst out laughing. "Using corporate warfare to settle personal scores?"

Three pairs of eyes immediately pinned him in place.

Lucas straightened instantly. "They absolutely deserve it!"

At Sterling Enterprises...

Bennett rushed in with breaking news.

The scandalous photos spread like wildfire online.

The headline screamed: "Heiress or Gold Digger? Assault Victim or Willing Mistress?"

Victoria Ashford lay disheveled on the floor beside an equally rumpled Vincent Moretti.

No one would believe their relationship was platonic.

Though neither were A-list celebrities, the story gained traction unnaturally fast—as if someone was deliberately fanning the flames.

Public outrage grew by the minute.

[That social circle is disgusting!]
[Some 'heiress'—just another rich man's plaything!]
[I recognize him! He's married!]

Evelyn looked at Bennett in surprise.

Bennett explained, "Word from Celestial Club is that Mr. Blackwood forced them to drink an entire crate of whiskey each before dumping them on the street. He sent the bill to both families. The photos and trending topics? Likely his doing too."
###Chapter 543

Who knew Nathan Blackwood could be this ruthless when pushed?

His gentlemanly facade had limits.

Evelyn Sinclair scrolled through the web page with a cold laugh. Nathan had crossed the line—vicious and unrelenting.

The Moretti family's rise had been built on shaky foundations. Half luck, half opportunism.

Vincent Moretti had made his fortune through shady deals, yet dared to flaunt his affairs publicly.

Evelyn's retaliation was surgical. A few well-placed moves to destabilize his partnerships, and he'd never forget this lesson.

Her real target, though, remained Ashford Group.

Bennett entered her office multiple times in quick succession.

"President, Ashford Group is calling—"

"Not now. I'm busy."

Evelyn smirked, ordering her team to compile a list of Ashford's key manufacturers from recent years. She dissected each one methodically.

"President, Victoria Ashford is downstairs. She refuses to leave until she sees you."

Evelyn didn't even glance up. "Call security."

She hadn't been ruthless enough with Victoria before.

That mistake wouldn't be repeated.

With Nathan's backing, Evelyn's revenge struck like a storm—Ashford Group was drowning under the onslaught.

Business thrived on harmony, but everyone schemed in the shadows.

Ashford Group reached out to every mutual connection with Sterling Enterprises, desperate for mediation. Evelyn shut them all down.

Public opinion spiraled. No amount of denials or legal threats from Ashford Group or Vincent Moretti could salvage their reputation. The truth was too damning.

People believed what they saw—especially when it exposed the ugly underbelly.

In twenty-four hours, the landscape shifted catastrophically. Long-term partners severed contracts, willing to pay penalties rather than stay tied to Ashford.

A corporate giant, now teetering.

Panic set in.

Evelyn's victory was inevitable. Even if it meant mutual destruction, she wouldn't let Ashford Group recover.

Ten hours in, their losses neared a billion. Another nosedive, and they'd be bankrupt.

Ashford Group headquarters.

Reginald Ashford shattered his office in a rage.

Penelope Ashford rushed in, pulse spiking at the wreckage.

"Clean this up," she hissed at the secretary.

Reginald turned on her. "Well? Did you reach Nathan?"

Penelope nodded—then crushed his hope.

"His assistant said Victoria picked the wrong enemy. That she brought this on herself. Blackwood Industries is already reconsidering their partnership."

Reginald collapsed into his chair, face twisted. "She went to Sterling Enterprises—"

Bitterness flashed in Penelope's eyes. "Evelyn refused to see her. Security dragged her out. That useless brat caused this mess!"

"How many partners have dropped us?"

"Twelve. All defected to Sterling Enterprises. Once Blackwood's withdrawal goes public, more will follow. And the mine collapse—authorities seized it. Father, we need to act."

Reginald's vision blurred. Fear hollowed him out.

"That bitch!"

His fist slammed the desk. His expression turned murderous.
###Chapter 544

The Ashford family had acknowledged Victoria and gone to great lengths to arrange an engagement with the Blackwoods, allowing her to get close to Nathan.

Yet she had accomplished nothing. Instead, she had dragged the Ashford name through the mud.

Reginald Ashford wanted nothing more than to disown her.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the business world shifted subtly, alliances rearranging like chess pieces.

This day would be remembered.

The internet buzzed relentlessly, the scandal growing louder.

Victoria’s noble facade crumbled—photos of her rebellious school days surfaced, former classmates accusing her of fraud.

She wanted to scream.

Though Ashford blood ran in her veins, her illegitimacy was undeniable.

And no one defended her.

After work, Evelyn grabbed her bag and left.

But the moment she stepped out, Victoria stood there, pale and trembling.

"Ms. Sinclair, please… I’m begging you. Let this go."

Evelyn arched a brow, studying the woman before her like a persistent ghost. Memories of last night darkened her gaze.

Victoria bit her lip, humiliation burning her cheeks.

"I’m sorry. Truly. It was my fault. I’ll leave the city. Just… let bygones be bygones."

She had tasted the venom of public scorn. The insults had been relentless. But her greatest fear? The Ashfords casting her aside.

She couldn’t lose the life she’d fought so hard to claim.

So she swallowed her pride and groveled.

Evelyn smirked, cold amusement in her eyes.

"Bygones? How hypocritical. I prefer watching fortunes burn."

She hadn’t forgotten Victoria’s act last night—the sickening sweetness, the calculated moves.

And she wouldn’t forgive.

Victoria’s face drained of color.

"It was just a glass of wine. You didn’t even drink—"

Evelyn’s icy stare silenced her.

"No one forces me to do anything. You dared. Now face the consequences."

She turned, her driver already waiting.

"I came to apologize! What more do you want?" Victoria’s voice cracked.

Evelyn paused, her expression sharpening.

"I don’t accept apologies. I settle things my way. And you? You disgust me."

Then she was gone, the car pulling away without a backward glance.

The calls kept coming. Unanswered.

The Ashford Group was panicking.

Victoria collapsed to the ground, sobbing.

Minutes later, Penelope’s furious call confirmed it—the situation was worsening.

All because of her.

She forced herself up, ready to return home—when footsteps rushed behind her.

A heavy bag slammed into her skull.

Before she could react, fingers tangled in her hair, yanking hard.

A stinging slap cracked across her face.

"You little snake! How dare you seduce my husband?"
###Chapter 545

A towering woman mounted Victoria, raining sharp slaps across her face.

"Help—"

Victoria's cries were drowned in the violent rhythm of the blows. Shame and pain numbed her senses.

Nearby, bystanders watched—but none intervened. Instead, they pulled out their phones, recording the spectacle, uploading it instantly. The internet erupted.

[Damn!]

[She really is the other woman! Serves her right!]

[The wife finally snapped. Homewreckers get what they deserve!]

Blurred vision made Victoria hallucinate Penelope standing over her—cold, furious, eyes burning with hatred.

She tried to scream, but the woman on top of her showed no mercy.

Each second stretched into agony.

Finally, the assault stopped. The woman stood, delivering one last brutal kick to Victoria's ribs before storming off.

"This isn't over. If I see you again, I'll finish what I started."

Darkness swallowed Victoria whole.

The Ashford estate was in chaos.

Reginald Ashford called old Master Blackwood, only to realize the situation was beyond salvage. One hung-up call later, he confirmed the worst—the Ashford Group was doomed.

He never imagined their downfall would come so swiftly. Evelyn Sinclair had dismantled them with ruthless precision, and they had no defense.

His mistake was clear—Victoria was no longer fit to associate with the Blackwoods.

Meanwhile, security around Evelyn had tripled—visible and hidden—at Sterling Enterprises, Highland Estates, everywhere she went.

A stranger brought Victoria to the hospital. The Ashfords abandoned her.

Reginald Ashford personally went to Sterling Enterprises to beg for mercy—only to be turned away at the gates. The Sterlings' message was clear: no apologies would be accepted. Evelyn wanted vengeance.

In two weeks, the Ashford Group crumbled.

Once a powerhouse, it was now a hollow shell drowning in debt. Their remaining assets? Less than 1% of what they'd had before.

A catastrophe.

Penelope Ashford couldn't care less about the family's ruin. She still had her inheritance—but fury consumed her.

Inside the hospital room, she hurled a glass at Victoria's bed.

Victoria flinched, covering her head, silent.

Pathetic.

"You bitch! Because of you, our family is destroyed! How dare you still breathe?!"

Penelope trembled with rage. The elite circle had exiled her—former friends now avoided her like plague.

She lunged forward, tearing the sheets away, yanking Victoria's hair. Bruises, fresh and old, meant nothing—she struck harder.

"We never should've let you back. A bastard like you belongs in the gutter!"

Victoria took it—no fight left in her.

Exhausted, Penelope stalked to the balcony.

Eighteen floors up. The Ashfords wouldn't pay another cent for this disgrace.

"Figure out your own medical bills. Steal. Sell yourself. I don't care—"

A sudden, piercing scream cut her off.

Then—

THUD.

A sickening impact.

"Someone jumped!"

"Call for help—!"
###Chapter 546

A figure stood on the eighteenth-floor balcony. Victoria Ashford finally let out a breath, her lips curling into a smile.

Beneath that smile lay years of paranoia, madness, and hatred.

She despised Penelope Ashford more than anyone.

Why should Penelope enjoy all the privileges of being Reginald Ashford's daughter alone? Victoria could have had the same lavish life.

She knew she was powerless against Evelyn Sinclair. But Penelope? That was a different story.

If Penelope died, Victoria would be the sole heiress of the Ashford family.

Evelyn was playing poker with Isabella Montgomery, Natalie Beaumont, and another friend when she received the news of Penelope's murder.

Bennett called to inform her—Victoria Ashford had been arrested.

Evelyn's emotions tangled.

She pitied Victoria. But she also despised her.

The news killed her mood for games. She left immediately.

She called Bennett, instructing him to ease the pressure on the Ashford family.

Her anger had been spent. It was time to leave them some breathing room.

When she asked Dominic Kingsley about the European situation, he stammered, claiming ignorance. "Nathan Blackwood is handling it," he said.

Curious, she considered calling Nathan but dialed Emily Whitaker instead.

Despite his busy schedule, Nathan hadn't neglected the matter.

After piecing together the details, Evelyn grasped Pacifica Tech's recent predicament.

She couldn't help but admire Nathan's skill.

The driverless car incident had been suppressed. Gerard Lichman's international lawsuit was quietly buried, replaced by a covert investigation into the truth.

Over the past week, news of Pacifica Tech's brake system failures spread like wildfire across continents.

Car owners banded together, preparing legal action.

But Pacifica Tech had powerful backers—investors with political and business influence worldwide. Their connections made them formidable.

In the past, Pacifica Tech had handled accidents clumsily. Their arrogance angered car owners, dragging the issue into the public eye.

A corporate lawsuit could stay hidden. But public outrage? That was impossible to contain.

Pacifica Tech supplied parts for multiple luxury brands. Their braking system, marketed as the world's safest, had now shattered global trust. Sales plummeted.

Yet Pacifica Tech refused to admit fault. Instead of introspection, they doubled down—suing the car owners.

Evelyn scoffed at their baffling moves. Someone was clearly pulling strings.

If it was Nathan, then she had no doubt—he was playing a long game, leading Pacifica Tech straight into his trap.

As Evelyn left work, she spotted an unexpected visitor in the lobby.

"Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston Sinclair smiled, his gentle eyes and humble demeanor impossible to ignore.

He held a small navy-blue gift box. When Evelyn approached, he handed it to her.

"Oliver asked me to deliver this. Please accept it."

Evelyn froze, then quickly took the box.

"Where is Oliver?"

The boy usually insisted on delivering gifts himself, adorable in his solemnity.

Preston cleared his throat. "He's in class. No time to come today."

Evelyn laughed, secretly wondering if the box held chrysanthemums again.

"Open it," Preston urged.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. When she lifted the lid, her lips twitched.

"Wow... another exquisite chrysanthemum."
###Chapter 547

The golden chrysanthemum had a small emblem engraved at its base.

It was clearly a custom piece—extravagant, bordering on gaudy.

Evelyn's heart skipped, but she kept her smile steady. "This is too much..."

Compared to the diamonds Oliver Sinclair had gifted her before, this was nothing.

But what kind of child casually handed out gold and diamonds?

She was completely caught off guard.

Preston noticed Evelyn's stunned expression and chuckled.

"I only found out about his flower choice when it was too late to change it. At least the design isn't terrible. It'll make decent decor."

He added thoughtfully.

A solid gold chrysanthemum was still better than a bouquet of real ones, after all.

Evelyn laughed softly and nodded in agreement.

"Oh, I prepared something for Oliver too."

She signaled Bennett to bring the package downstairs.

Tapping the box that reached her waist, she grinned.

"Legos?" Preston guessed, raising a brow.

Evelyn shook her head.

"Since he's learning new languages, I got him some practice exams."

The stack inside was thick enough to last him through his entire academic career.

Preston froze for a second before bursting into laughter.

"Ms. Sinclair, with this gift, Oliver will definitely study harder."

"Poor kid's going to hate me," Evelyn teased.

Preston could already picture his son's horrified face when he realized who'd sent the mountain of papers.

As they spoke, a man approached from behind.

"You two are blocking the entrance. My employees don’t know whether to come or go."

William Sterling feigned sternness.

Evelyn arched a brow and linked arms with him affectionately. "Dad, did you come all this way just to pick me up?"

William rolled his eyes and glanced at Preston.

Preston greeted him with genuine warmth, his demeanor respectful yet relaxed.

"I just got back from fishing with a friend. There’s a private restaurant nearby—let me treat you to dinner with today’s catch."

William gestured toward the adjacent building.

Alexander Sterling, usually composed, quickened his pace to join them.

"Mr. Sinclair."

Preston acknowledged him with a nod.

William insisted, "Come with us. The view’s excellent, and the food’s even better."

Evelyn hesitated, expecting Preston to decline. But he simply smiled. "I’d be honored."

William wasn’t surprised.

Soon, the four of them were seated at the restaurant’s top floor.

The breeze was light, the cityscape sprawling beneath them.

Dinner was served swiftly—fresh seafood, fine wine, easy conversation.

Evelyn relaxed when she saw Preston fitting in effortlessly with William and Alexander.

William observed his daughter’s reaction, then turned to Preston.

"You’re young to already have a son. Bring him by the manor sometime. Lucas adores kids."

Lucas, who notoriously avoided children, sneezed violently at home.

Preston chuckled. "I’ll apologize in advance for any chaos Oliver causes. He’s quite taken with Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn shot her father a warning look.

She knew exactly what he was implying by mentioning Oliver.

William had noticed Preston’s particular interest in Evelyn.

For most, Preston’s status was unattainable. But the Sterlings had the luxury of choosing.

A child was a complication—one William wouldn’t overlook.

Bringing up Oliver was his polite way of drawing a line.
###Chapter 548

Preston Sinclair didn't take William Sterling's words seriously.

He glanced at Evelyn with a gentle smile and continued answering William's question.

William said, "Since you're friends with Evelyn, perhaps you could help find her a suitable partner. I can't rest easy knowing she might stay single forever."

Preston chuckled warmly, but even Alexander Sterling's fingers paused mid-motion.

Alexander slowly speared a piece of fish with his fork and ate it in silence.

Preston replied smoothly, "Ms. Sterling is an extraordinary woman—she certainly isn't lacking admirers. But finding someone who truly matches her? That's rare. I see how content she is with her family. Chairman Sterling, you've clearly raised her like royalty. No one could ever treat her as well as her own family does."

William raised his brows, thoroughly pleased with Preston's response.

He nodded in agreement. "Exactly. Our entire family indulges Evelyn. Her happiness is ours."

This statement was an unspoken confirmation—Evelyn's position as the heir to Sterling Enterprises was unshakable.

Nathan Blackwood sat in his car outside Sterling Enterprises, waiting for Evelyn.

Soon, a message from Tristan Whitmore arrived.

Attached was a photo—William, Alexander, and Evelyn dining with Preston Sinclair.

The scene was unexpectedly warm.

William, as the elder, wore an openly fond expression as he spoke with Preston.

They looked... harmonious together.

[Tristan Whitmore: He's already meeting the parents, and you're still parked outside like a lost puppy. Should I introduce you to someone else?]

Meeting the parents?

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. His grip on the steering wheel tightened.

A cold fury settled over his features.

Jealousy and anger twisted inside him, sharp enough to make him consider storming in and taking Evelyn away.

His pulse spiked.

The urge to lock her away—just for himself—flared dangerously.

Otherwise, every man near her would remain an unbearable irritation.

Playing the gentleman had gotten him nowhere.

A wolf in sheep's clothing could never truly be tame.

Nathan's nature wouldn't allow him to stand by and watch.

His patient approach had failed. If he waited any longer, Evelyn might marry someone else without him even realizing it.

No. I'm done waiting.

He sent Evelyn a text and headed to her penthouse.

He knew she would come.

After dinner, Evelyn checked her phone and saw Nathan's message from an hour ago.

[You left your flash drive at Highland Estates. I'm waiting at your place.]

She frowned. Did I?

Assuming it might contain sensitive company data, she couldn't risk it falling into the wrong hands.

She excused herself and left early.

Though she hadn't been to her penthouse in weeks, the cleaners maintained it impeccably.

What is Nathan planning? Why meet here?

As she approached her building, she spotted a familiar Range Rover parked below.

The headlights were off, but a lean arm rested casually out the window, a cigarette burning between his fingers.

Nathan.

His profile was sharp, his demeanor relaxed yet intense.

The car was parked beside hers.

The moment Evelyn stepped out, holding the gift from Oliver Sinclair, she was yanked into a cold embrace from behind.

Nathan's scent—dark and possessive—wrapped around her.

Her body stiffened.
###Chapter 549

"Let me go." Evelyn's voice was sharp as ice.

Nathan only tightened his grip.

His tone carried a dangerous edge. "Who were you having dinner with?"

The unease in his chest was suffocating. The fear of losing her was becoming unbearable.

Evelyn frowned, trying to read his expression. He spun her around, forcing her to meet his gaze. The distance between them was far too close, far beyond what she considered safe.

Her eyes were clear, cold, searching for any sign of what was wrong with him. But she found nothing unusual.

No scent of alcohol. No obvious explanation.

"It's none of your concern," she said flatly. "I don’t owe you an explanation."

Nathan’s lips curled into a humorless smile, his eyes glinting with something dark.

He already knew who she had been with. Yet, like a masochist, he wanted to hear the name from her lips—wanted to twist the knife deeper into his own chest.

"Where’s my stuff?" she demanded.

"What stuff?"

"You lied to me?"

Nathan chuckled, low and rough. He had only wanted an excuse to pull her away from that dinner. But watching her stay gone for over an hour had frayed his patience to nothing.

He reached into his car, pulled out a flash drive, and dropped it into her bag.

Evelyn shoved against him, but he didn’t budge. His gaze was heavy, unyielding.

They stood locked in a silent battle for dominance, neither willing to back down.

Then Evelyn realized—this was the real Nathan.

His promises before? Meaningless.

His attention flicked to the navy-blue gift box in her hand. A sharp, irrational pain lanced through his chest.

Without hesitation, he snatched it from her and flipped it open.

Inside lay an exquisite golden chrysanthemum.

He didn’t need to guess who had given it to her.

Evelyn reached for it, but Nathan smirked and tossed it straight into the nearest trash bin.

"Some gifts aren’t worth keeping," he said smoothly. "I’ll get you something better."

His gaze burned into her, barely restrained hunger simmering beneath the surface.

Evelyn stared back, unflinching. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, she said, "Pick it up."

Nathan laughed, low and mocking. "You think I’d dig Preston Sinclair’s trash out for you? Dream on."

The moment the words left his mouth, Evelyn twisted his wrist with brutal precision. He barely registered the pain before she wrenched his arm to the side, nearly breaking it.

His strength surged back instantly, muscles trembling under the force of her attack. She hadn’t held back.

Her eyes were glacial as she aimed a kick at his groin. Nathan anticipated it, catching her leg before she could strike.

But Evelyn was faster. She yanked him forward by his tie, throwing him off balance—a move he never saw coming.
###Chapter 550

Nathan Blackwood's intense gaze locked onto Evelyn Sinclair's lips.

No lipstick adorned them, yet they were perfect—soft pink with a natural peach tint.

He wanted to taste them.

As he leaned in, Evelyn viciously kicked his shin.

Nathan staggered back, shock flashing across his face.

Her expression was icy. Without a word, she turned to leave.

A vein pulsed at his temple. He lunged forward, gripping her wrist.

"You said you'd move past everything," he growled. "So why can't you give me a chance? You accepted Preston Sinclair. Why reject me?"

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "Do you really think you compare to Preston?"

The words struck him like a physical blow.

He stiffened. Was she angry about the discarded gift? Or was it his confession of desire?

His jaw clenched. He didn’t release her.

"You’ve chosen him?"

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before answering.

Nathan felt his heart crack open.

"You took him to meet your father?"

"Yes."

"You’re getting married?" His voice turned dangerously low.

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly. "Yes."

Nathan’s expression darkened. Emotions raged in his eyes, his grip on her trembling.

The air turned frigid.

Nathan felt his body freeze, the cold seeping into his bones.

He’d accept any punishment—but losing Evelyn wasn’t an option.

"Even prisoners get second chances," he rasped. "Am I truly unforgivable?"

His voice was raw. His dark eyes were bloodshot, the corners red.

Agony twisted in his chest. He already knew the answer, yet he needed to hear it from her.

A cool breeze swept between them.

Evelyn’s reply was barely audible. "Yes."

The world collapsed around him.

Crushing. Suffocating.

He couldn’t breathe.

Silence stretched.

Evelyn expected fury—for him to snap, to force his way into her life again.

She wouldn’t forgive him if he did.

Who forgives a rabid dog after it bites?

She twisted free and stepped inside, slamming the door behind her.

Evelyn leaned against it, exhaling shakily. Her palms were damp.

The lights stayed off.

Through the window, she watched Nathan limp toward his car—his old injury flaring from her kick.

Her chest tightened.

Was that pity?

She was letting go of the past. But what had Nathan wanted tonight?

To claim her.

Because she was close to Preston, he needed to mark his territory?

She refused to entertain his insecurities.

Minutes passed. The engine never started.

Guilt gnawed at her.

She cracked the door open—only to find Nathan still there, disheveled, head bowed.
###Chapter 551

Evelyn froze when she saw Nathan standing at her doorstep.

He held a slightly scuffed navy blue gift box in his hands.

The box looked oddly out of place against his immaculate, well-manicured fingers.

His eyes were bloodshot.

"Picked this up," he murmured, voice rough. "Don't reject me, please?"

His throat burned with unspoken words.

He'd gone mad for her - so mad he'd dug through trash bins without caring who saw.

But Nathan knew if he walked away now, he might never see Evelyn again.

Silence stretched between them.

Neither moved.

Finally, Evelyn smirked and took the box.

She removed its contents, placed them on the side table, then tossed the empty box aside.

"Get lost," she said coolly.

Nathan stepped closer instead. "I'm sorry."

His earlier outburst had been unforgivable.

He wouldn't give up just because she was engaged to Preston. Even married, he'd steal her back.

The arrogance he showed the world vanished completely around her.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Anything else?"

"New terms." His voice cracked. "Let's remarry."

Bloodshot eyes burned with single-minded determination.

She laughed sharply.

"Difference being? Before you just wanted to sleep with me. Now you want to do it legally and repeatedly?"

Her icy gaze pinned him. "Think you stand a chance?"

His fingers twitched. "Do I?"

"Not currently."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Good you recognize that."

"But I'll make one." His voice dropped to a whisper.

Evelyn said nothing.

Whether they reconciled wasn't his decision to make.

This broken version of Nathan unnerved her more than his usual domineering self.

She turned to leave but his hand shot out, blocking the door.

The angry scar on his forearm made her flinch. He immediately withdrew.

"My leg..." His voice cracked with quiet desperation.

The mighty CEO trembled like a chastened child.

Evelyn's chest tightened uncomfortably.

His aggression she could handle. This vulnerable side? Her fatal weakness.

She pulled out her phone. "I'll call Harrison."

"His father's in surgery." No lie this time.

Evelyn hesitated, then relented.

"Come in." She left the door ajar.

Nathan limped inside, sweat beading on his forehead after just a few steps.

Evelyn tossed men's slippers at his feet. "Change."

She grabbed her laptop from the couch, inserting a flash drive as it booted up.

Nathan's pulse spiked.

Shit.

Guilt twisted his gut.

Those slippers taunted him.

Other men visited? Preston came often enough to warrant keeping slippers here?

The questions burned his tongue - but one look at Evelyn's stony expression silenced him.

Hadn't he learned his lesson? One wrong word and she'd toss him out.

This was all Preston's fault.

The laptop screen illuminated Evelyn's face as she opened the folder.

Her eyebrows shot up at the contents: "Old Classics," "Romantic Songs," "President's Favorites..."
###Chapter 552

Evelyn frowned at the screen. "Old classics? How ancient are these tracks?"

Her fingers hovered over the folders in the USB drive—each one filled with Nathan's music preferences.

This definitely wasn't her drive.

A shadow crossed her face as she turned to glare at him.

"Is this the USB I left behind?"

Nathan sauntered over, feigning ignorance, and glanced at the screen.

Property of NovelDreams Publishing.

When his eyes landed on the folder labeled CEO's Playlist, his lips twitched. "This is... thorough."

"Must be a mistake," he said smoothly, rubbing his jaw.

Evelyn shoved the laptop aside and stalked toward her bedroom. "Sleep on the couch. Or in your car."

"Couch," he answered immediately.

His smirk faded when he spotted the golden rose by the door. He busied himself with emails while she disappeared into her room.

Her apartment had two bedrooms, but after Lucas moved out, the second had been converted into a study. Now, only one remained.

Nathan's gaze snagged on a framed photo of Evelyn on the wall. A slow, calculating grin spread across his face.

He adjusted the lighting, snapped a picture, and uploaded it to his social media.

Caption: Perfect night.

The implication was obvious.

He even had the audacity to block her—just for this.

Within minutes, the comments flooded in.

Tristan Whitmore: Holy hell, Blackwood! Moving fast, aren’t you? Is that Evelyn’s place? You two living together now? Where is she? Why no pic?

Nathan replied: Showering.

Adrian Blackwood: RIP to every man who ever dreamed of her.

The rest were variations of:

Congrats! Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair are a match made in heaven!

Power couple alert!

Nathan leaned back, smug. So what if Preston Sinclair had met her family? He was in her apartment.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn emerged, wrapped in a plush robe.

Nathan was sprawled on the couch, grinning at his phone like a cat who’d gotten the cream.

What the hell is he so pleased about?

She snatched her laptop and documents off the table without a word and turned to leave.

Her phone rang.

Nathan’s eyes flicked to the caller ID—William Sterling. His jaw tightened.

Evelyn doubled back, answering on speaker.

"Dad, you’re still up?"

Nathan watched her like a hawk.

"Are you alone?" William asked.

"...Yeah."

"Good. If you’re free, go out. Drink. Dance. Don’t just sit at home."

Nathan’s brows shot up. My future father-in-law is... unconventional.

"Listen," William continued, "Preston and Nathan are both decent options, but marriage is risky. Date around. Don’t settle for one fish when there’s an ocean."

Nathan nearly choked. Is he encouraging her to play the field?

Evelyn laughed. "I’ve got work to finish. Goodnight, Dad."

The call ended.

Nathan was on his feet before her door clicked shut.

He twisted the knob.

Locked.

A dark chuckle escaped him. She’s locking me out?
###Chapter 553

Nathan Blackwood silently returned to the sofa.

Restlessness, resentment, and helplessness churned inside him, making sleep impossible that night.

Dawn had already broken when exhaustion finally claimed him.

Evelyn Sinclair awoke to Isabella Montgomery's call.

"Is Nathan Blackwood at your place?" Isabella demanded without preamble.

Evelyn frowned, still groggy. "Yes..."

"Damn it! Are you two really back together? Living together now? Is this serious or just a fling?"

The fog cleared from Evelyn's mind as she processed the implications.

"How do you know he's here?"

"Check Nathan's social media! He posted a photo that's got the entire elite circle talking about your reunion last night!"

Evelyn hung up and immediately checked Nathan's accounts - nothing.

She took a deep breath and called Isabella back.

"Send me the screenshot."

"He blocked you? Hah! That's rich - the man's sneaking around to post about you!"

Within moments, Isabella forwarded the damning evidence.

Evelyn nearly choked seeing it.

The photo showed her portrait in the living room. His suggestive caption and reply to Tristan Whitmore's comment left little to imagination.

That bastard Nathan Blackwood had orchestrated this deliberately!

The screenshot showed countless likes and comments - their social circle would be buzzing by now.

"That absolute bastard!" Evelyn stormed out, only to find the living room empty. The disheveled sofa bore evidence of recent occupation, but its inhabitant had vanished.

"Ran away like a coward," she muttered.

After freshening up, Evelyn headed to work.

Fortunately, Nathan's inner circle remained small. Those who'd seen the post wouldn't dare harass her directly.

Meanwhile, Pacifica Tech dominated international headlines for all the wrong reasons. Their arrogant stance toward consumer safety and unreasonable demands had sparked global outrage, making front-page news worldwide.

Consumer protests forced the Pacifica government to halt production of their controversial braking systems pending investigation. Luxury car manufacturers suspended sales of affected models, though recalls remained conspicuously absent.

At this critical juncture, Kingsley Tech's AI car system faced scrutiny - with all evidence pointing to Pacifica Tech's faulty components.

As AI represented humanity's future, entrusting lives to emotionless machines required absolute certainty in their safety.

The consequences of negligence would be catastrophic.

Investigators abandoned secrecy, releasing findings publicly. International authorities soon confirmed the AI system functioned flawlessly - the fault lay elsewhere.

Within weeks, Pacifica Tech's reputation crumbled. The once-revered automotive innovator became synonymous with corporate deceit.

Despite powerful backers, no investor dared defend them against global condemnation.

European nations, Montecito, and Pacifica formed a joint investigative team. With Kingsley Tech's full cooperation, the truth emerged: Pacifica Tech's components contained intermittent defects affecting random units.

This explained why some owners reported no issues.

The revelation caused international uproar. Pacifica Tech suspended production immediately.

Ironically, the AI car emerged unscathed, enjoying unprecedented publicity.

Dominic Kingsley observed Nathan's demeanor and exhaled in relief. "Not difficult at all. You'd orchestrated everything beforehand - we merely executed."

Without Nathan's foresight, Kingsley Tech might have faced ruin from Pacifica Tech's investors.

Nathan, unusually approachable, acknowledged each greeting with rare patience.

As attendees settled, one empty chair remained beside Evelyn - whether by design or coincidence.

Nathan claimed it without hesitation, casually draping an arm behind Evelyn's chair.

The room buzzed with unspoken reactions.

Evelyn pretended not to notice, engrossed in the menu while engaging Dominic. "Mr. Kingsley, you've worked hardest—"

Evelyn blinked. "Apologize for what?"

Seeing potential salvation, Dominic recounted the earlier incident. Hearing Nathan's response, Evelyn could visualize his exact expression.

Nathan's military background meant even as a businessman, his national loyalty remained unquestionable.

No wonder Dominic felt such guilt.

"Ms. Sinclair, perhaps you could... intercede later?"

Evelyn smiled. "Of course."

The private room door opened again. Nathan entered alone.

His gaze swept the assembly, lingering on Evelyn before he approached Dominic with a knowing smile.

"You've had quite the journey."
###Chapter 554

Dominic Kingsley was already waiting when Evelyn Sinclair arrived at the private dining room.

Several familiar faces accompanied him.

She smiled warmly and embraced Dominic. "Excellent work, Mr. Kingsley."

Dominic's usually composed expression softened, though exhaustion lingered in his features.

"It's my duty. Thankfully, we didn't disappoint Montecito's AI industry."

Evelyn smirked inwardly. He really knows how to play the visionary.

After exchanging greetings, the group settled in, conversation flowing easily.

"Let's order," Evelyn suggested. "Tonight's on me—get whatever you like."

Dominic hesitated. "I should be the one treating. Consider it an apology to Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic was pleased with the outcome. His triumphant return to Montecito warranted celebration, and he had invited Evelyn and Nathan to dinner.

"Why don't we all decide together?"

Dominic deferred. "That wouldn't be proper. Mr. Blackwood should order first."

Nathan's gaze darkened at the proximity between them, but his smile remained smooth. "Go ahead, Mr. Kingsley. Everyone, order freely."

His eyes chilled as he watched Evelyn grin at Dominic.

The group relaxed after Nathan's reassurance.

Dominic selected a few dishes before passing the menu to Evelyn, who immediately handed it to the others. She didn’t want them to feel pressured by the bosses’ choices.

As conversation resumed, Nathan’s hand, resting casually on the back of her chair, brushed against her hair. Instead of pulling away, he toyed with a loose strand.

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance.

Nathan met her gaze, his fingers stilling. A shiver ran through him.

Damn it. He was utterly captivated by her.

Food and drinks arrived, easing the tension.

Evelyn and the other women opted for wine, while the men raised their glasses in a toast to Nathan and Evelyn.

The atmosphere grew lively. Nathan quietly arranged transportation for everyone, ensuring they could drink without worry.

After several rounds, Dominic leaned toward Evelyn with a conspiratorial wink.

Nathan’s expression turned icy.
###Chapter 555

Dominic Kingsley raised his glass with a practiced smile. "Mr. Blackwood, we've known each other for years. I'd like to formally apologize for my previous... unfortunate choice of words."

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for three heartbeats before picking up his own glass and draining it in one smooth motion.

Dominic chuckled nervously, glancing at Evelyn Sinclair for support.

Evelyn cleared her throat delicately. "Mr. Blackwood isn't one to hold grudges, Dominic. Consider the matter forgotten." This marked the first time she'd directly addressed Nathan all evening.

"Water under the bridge," Nathan replied tersely.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Actually, Dominic, this shows you're the type of man who owns up to mistakes. That takes courage and integrity."

"Is that so?" Nathan's voice could have frozen the wine in their glasses.

Dominic nearly choked on his drink at Evelyn's unexpected compliment, quickly returning to his seat.

Nathan said nothing, but his mind raced. When had Evelyn and Dominic grown so familiar? The way they exchanged glances, the ease between them - it set his teeth on edge.

Throughout dinner, Evelyn pointedly ignored Nathan, her attention fixed on Dominic.

Annoyance flared in Nathan's chest. He signaled the waiter for another drink.

At a nearby table, a newlywed couple exchanged sweet nothings, drawing envious sighs from single guests.

Nathan's gaze snapped to Evelyn, catching her hesitant stare at a plate of shelled prawns. Without thinking, he reached over, selected the largest one, and began meticulously peeling it.

The table assumed Nathan simply enjoyed seafood.

Until he placed the perfectly prepared prawn directly beside Evelyn's lips.

The entire group held their breath.

Nathan leaned close, his words laced with alcohol and something darker. "After last night, this is how you treat me?" Though spoken softly, the implication carried clearly.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork at the reminder. That disastrous evening when Nathan had deliberately sabotaged her meeting. The man was utterly insufferable.

Her icy glare should have frozen him solid. Yet Nathan swore he saw fire in those hazel depths - enough to intoxicate him without a single drop of alcohol.

Evelyn's sudden laugh startled everyone. "One night means nothing, Nathan. Surely a man of your experience understands how these games work?"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. Dominic visibly regretted ever broaching the subject - the unrequited tension between them was painfully obvious.

The table fell into uncomfortable silence.

Then Nathan surprised them all by laughing. He withdrew the prawn, his obsidian eyes locking onto Evelyn as he lounged back in his chair. "I'm working on changing that."

The humility in his admission shocked everyone.

"Best of luck, Mr. Blackwood!" someone ventured.

"We're rooting for you!" another added.

Nathan's lips quirked, though the alcohol couldn't dull the bitterness twisting in his gut. Evelyn remained infuriatingly composed.

In one fluid motion, he closed the distance between them. "It's the woman who decides," he murmured, offering the prawn again.

Evelyn went rigid. With deliberate calm, she leaned away from both Nathan and the unwanted offering.

Dominic's eyes widened as realization struck. That cryptic social media post Nathan made last week suddenly made sense.

"So... you two are living together?" Dominic blurted.

The table froze.

Nathan hesitated.

All eyes darted between them, waiting for confirmation more reliable than any tabloid.

Evelyn's smile held zero warmth.

Dominic swallowed his congratulatory words.

'I shouldn't have asked,' he mentally kicked himself. 'The tension between them could power Manhattan.'

Fortunately, the moment passed. Conversation gradually resumed.

Later, as the party dispersed, Dominic followed Nathan's associates to settle the bill, leaving Evelyn and Nathan momentarily alone in the private dining room.

Evelyn grabbed her clutch and turned to leave.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice stopped her cold. The way he said her name, watching her slender frame with undisguised hunger, sent an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

"Do you know the difference between me and Adrian?" he asked suddenly.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll.

Nathan stood, closing the distance between them in three strides. "His wife was his classmate for eight years. Now they're expecting their second child." His voice dropped to a rough whisper, eyes burning into hers. "I don't share."
###Chapter 556

Evelyn twirled the crystal glass between her fingers. Her hands were delicate, almost sculptural in their perfection.

Not a single inappropriate moment had occurred between them that evening. Even if something had, this would still be her response.

Nathan wanted rumors about their relationship to spread. Fine. She'd handle it her way.

The man was making a spectacle of himself before even securing her affection. Pathetic. It only proved how obsessed he was.

To outsiders, Evelyn appeared far more composed than Nathan.

Which rendered his little performance utterly pointless.

The surrounding guests pretended not to overhear.

This was too scandalous to acknowledge.

Who dared laugh at Nathan Blackwood?

His breath carried the sharp tang of whiskey as he murmured, "We spent the entire night together. How can you be so cruel?"

Though spoken softly, every word carried clearly to eavesdroppers.

Evelyn's temper flared at the reminder.

Nathan had caused her nothing but trouble today. The man was deranged. She should've broken his legs and left him in an alley.

Her icy gaze swept over him. The intensity in her eyes made him feel intoxicated despite her sobriety.

A light, mocking laugh escaped her lips, drawing all attention.

"One night means nothing. Don't tell me you actually thought it was special?"

Dominic immediately regretted asking when Nathan's expression darkened.

This was clearly unrequited obsession.

Nathan had been publicly humiliated.

The table's atmosphere turned glacial.

Suddenly, Nathan chuckled and snatched away the shrimp platter. His dark eyes locked onto Evelyn as he tapped the chair meaningfully.

"I'm working on it."

The submission in his tone shocked everyone.

The realization hit them simultaneously.

"Good luck, Mr. Blackwood!"

"We're rooting for you!"

Nathan's lips curled bitterly. Alcohol fogged his mind as he studied Evelyn's impassive face.

He leaned closer abruptly.

"So it's Ms. Sinclair who prefers—"

Evelyn glanced down and froze momentarily. With deliberate calm, she ignored both him and the offered shrimp.

She reclined in her chair, putting distance between them.

Dominic finally understood after observing Nathan's behavior.

Only one woman could make Nathan Blackwood peel shrimp for her.

"Are you two back together?"

Nathan hesitated.

The entire room held its breath, awaiting confirmation more reliable than any tabloid.

Evelyn's smile held no warmth.

Dominic swallowed his congratulations.

This had been a mistake. He never should've involved Evelyn. The evening had soured completely.

Fortunately, the gathering soon ended without further awkwardness.

Dominic left with Nathan's associates to settle the bill.

Evelyn and Nathan remained alone in the private room.

She grabbed her purse to leave.

Nathan called out, watching her slender silhouette. Restlessness churned within him.

"Do you know the difference between me and Dominic?"

Evelyn didn't dignify this with a response.

He stood and approached.

"His wife was his college sweetheart. They're expecting their second child now."

His voice dropped to a rough whisper as he stared intently.

Evelyn tensed at his sudden intensity.

Nathan continued, "I'm single. You should—"

Jealousy and bitterness laced every word.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, shooting him a scathing look before turning sharply on her heel.

The man was insufferable.

Rain drizzled outside, wind whipping through the streets.

Her driver arrived promptly with an umbrella.

Evelyn never drove after business dinners, even when sober.

Once she left, Dominic returned to find Nathan statue-still, cigarette dangling from his fingers.

He clapped Nathan's shoulder.

"Mr. Blackwood, you've got a long road ahead."

Their dynamic returned to normal after the meal. Adults didn't dwell on insignificant matters.

Nathan exhaled smoke.

"Are you mocking me?"

"Wouldn't dare," Dominic lied.

"Answer me something."

Nathan studied him seriously. "Do you often interact with her privately?"

Dominic paled. Was this jealousy over tonight?

He adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Blackwood, we rarely interact. You're usually present when we meet."

He needed to clarify—he wouldn't become collateral damage just because Evelyn rejected Nathan.

Nathan knew Dominic spoke truthfully.

So she'd done this purely to provoke him. Made him humiliate himself publicly.

He crushed his cigarette violently, fingertips whitening.

His gaze turned dangerous. "Regarding the Preston Sinclair project—"

Dominic nodded hastily. "I'll expedite progress."

Nathan stood, patting his shoulder.

"No rush. After such a major event, the scientists deserve rest."

Dominic was speechless.

The next day at Sterling Manor...

Evelyn had stayed at her apartment for two days. While peaceful, it lacked convenience. She considered hiring a live-in housekeeper.

She returned for lunch. Though William hadn't seen her in two days...
###Chapter 557

Evelyn smiled and smoothly changed the subject.

"Lucas, aren't you supposed to be filming a movie soon? Are you leaving today?"

Lucas nodded. "Mhmm. Mostly just to hype up the newbies. This batch of rookies isn’t exactly impressive."

Evelyn raised a brow. "I heard your latest girlfriend is one of them?"

The paparazzi had snapped photos of him with a fresh-faced actress, sparking rumors.

Lucas hesitated. His gaze flicked toward William, who stood nearby. He cleared his throat.

"We broke up."

Most of his so-called "girlfriends" were just publicity stunts—nothing real.

Evelyn gave an awkward smile. "That’s... good?"

William slammed his hand on the table. "What kind of man are you? Changing girlfriends like they’re disposable? You think that makes you respectable?"

Lucas nearly choked on his soup. Respectable? Since when was he not?!

"Dad, didn’t you always tell Lil E not to settle for one fish when there’s an entire ocean?"

William looked ready to strangle him. "Don’t compare yourself to your sister! You should be grateful if anyone even looks your way. What ocean? You’re barely a puddle!"

Leo, sensing the tension, flicked his tail and jumped from Lucas’s lap to Evelyn’s, wisely avoiding the drama.

Lucas clutched his chest dramatically. "That hurt."

After William’s scolding, Lucas slunk out of the house, head low.

Evelyn waited for him in the car. "I’ll drop you off at the office."

Lucas frowned. "Don’t you have work?"

"Alexander gave me the day off."

The moment Lucas stepped outside, his superstar persona snapped back into place.

At the office entrance, a slender, doe-eyed actress waved eagerly at him.

Lucas flashed his signature grin and waved back.

Evelyn blinked. "Who’s that?"

Lucas smirked. "My new girlfriend."

Evelyn sighed. Does this man ever take a break?

Dominic Kingsley hadn’t expected the Sterling siblings to show up together.

Lucas lounged on the sofa, lazily flipping through a script. He only did one film a year—just enough to stay relevant without overexposing himself.

Evelyn had only tagged along for fun, but trouble found her the second she arrived.

Dominic’s assistant knocked. "Mr. Kingsley, Xavier Delmont says he needs to speak with you urgently."

Evelyn froze.

She’d been so busy lately, she’d nearly forgotten about him.

Xavier had messaged her, but she never replied. Eventually, the texts stopped.

Just seeing his face—so similar to Nathan’s but with that infuriatingly delicate demeanor—irritated her.

She wanted to bolt, but Dominic had already nodded, allowing Xavier inside.

Too late to escape now.

Evelyn shot Dominic a glare. He looked baffled. Isn’t Evelyn his sugar mommy?

Lucas, ever the spectator, stayed silent, enjoying the show.

"Mr. Kingsley! Ms. Sterling, you’re here too?" Xavier feigned surprise.

Evelyn was almost impressed. His acting had improved—almost professional.

At least his training wasn’t wasted.

She forced a laugh. "Xavier, I heard you’ve been landing endorsements left and right."

Xavier beamed. He didn’t let her coldness faze him.

He stepped closer, fingers brushing her sleeve. "All thanks to you, Ms. Sterling. I’ve missed you..."

The endorsements were small, barely profitable, and exhausting—but better than nothing.
###Chapter 558

Dominic Kingsley smirked from the sidelines. His lips twitched with amusement.

Those endorsements were leftovers no one wanted. So Dominic packaged them for Xavier Delmont at a bargain price.

Xavier had started with low-level ads. Shooting high-end products would be a challenge for him.

But no one had warned him about that.

Evelyn Sinclair smiled. "No need to thank me. You should be grateful to Mr. Kingsley for his... generosity."

Xavier hesitated, then asked, "Ms. Sinclair, why don't I treat you to dinner?"

Perfect opportunity to get a paparazzi shot, he thought.

Evelyn shook her head. "I need to drop my brother off at the set. Rain check."

The words "Horizon Media" flashed in Xavier's mind. If he landed a role in this film, his career would skyrocket.

Evelyn glanced at him. "Yes, it's still in pre-production."

Xavier's excitement was palpable. "Can you put in a word for me?"

Evelyn was his investor—and Lucas Sterling's sister.

Family connections should make this easy.

Xavier didn't think his request was unreasonable.

Dominic remained silent.

Evelyn sighed. "Fine, I'll mention it."

Just one word. That's all it would take.

Xavier nearly hugged her in excitement, but Evelyn's icy stare stopped him.

Lucas didn't react. Neither did Dominic.

Because they knew—even if he got the role, if his performance was lackluster, he'd be cut from the final edit.

Xavier's ambition had narrowed to one goal: Get this role.

Time was running out.

Xavier gave it his all.

He hovered around Evelyn, offering fruit and drinks, ensuring her comfort.

Lucas and Dominic had long since left for the set.

Xavier trailed smugly behind Evelyn.

With his investor backing him, stardom was inevitable.

Evelyn lingered, settling into a gazebo to observe the shoot.

Suddenly—

"Natalie!"

Natalie Beaumont turned, spotting Evelyn. She approached with measured steps.

"President Sinclair, aren't you swamped with work?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "I'm here with my brother. Why are you here?"

Natalie tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, nodding toward an actor.

"My team's artistic director is working on this. Adrian Prescott is also here as the third lead."

Evelyn nodded. Natalie's business ventures were diverse—this wasn't surprising.

Then Natalie's smile froze.

"Who's that woman with your brother?"

The woman was nestled against Lucas, laughing as he playfully tugged her hair.

Evelyn shrugged. "His new girlfriend. She's the lead actress."

Natalie's expression flickered before she regained composure.

"Mr. Superstar changes girlfriends like socks."

"It's just publicity. All fake," Evelyn explained.

Natalie's lips twitched. Fake? Or did it start that way?

But it wasn't her place to care.

The second lead actress rushed over to Natalie and Evelyn.

The female lead's iconic prop sat on a nearby table.

As the second lead reached for it, she didn’t notice the car keys with a teardrop jade pendant beside it.

A sharp clink echoed as the keys hit the ground.

The jade shattered.

Evelyn and Natalie's faces darkened.

"Stop right there!"
###Chapter 559

Natalie Beaumont's hands shook as she picked up the car keys and the shattered pieces of her jade pendant. Her heart ached with every breath.

Evelyn Sinclair frowned. She knew how much that pendant meant to Natalie.

"What did you do?"

The supporting actress froze, her gaze dropping to the floor with annoyance and disdain. "It was an accident."

She turned to leave without another word.

"An accident makes it okay?" Natalie's eyes burned red. "So I deserved this?"

The actress rolled her eyes. "How much does it cost? My boyfriend will pay for it."

Evelyn's brows furrowed deeper. "You can't even apologize?"

Recognition flashed in the actress's eyes when she saw Evelyn. She swallowed her retort.

She hesitated, biting her lip. Apologizing shouldn't be hard, but this woman was being so dramatic.

"Lil E, you know me. Your brother will handle this, just drop it."

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly. Her voice turned icy. "What did you just call me?"

For a heartbeat, her gaze turned arctic.

Lil E?

Only her closest family and friends used that nickname.

How dare this nobody actress call her that?

The actress paled, confused by Evelyn's reaction but knowing better than to argue. "That's what I heard your brother call you."

Evelyn's tone could freeze hell. "He's family. You're not."

The words crushed the actress's pride. Her eyes welled up.

At that moment, Lucas Sterling walked in.

"What's going on?"

The actress immediately clung to Lucas, whining in a pitiful voice. "It was an accident! I just dropped her things. She's Lil—your sister's friend."

Lucas's face darkened when he saw Natalie crouched on the floor, cradling the broken pendant. Everyone close to Natalie knew it was the last gift from her late grandmother.

An irreplaceable heirloom.

"You can buy her a new one. It's just some cheap jade—"

"Shut up!" Lucas snapped.

He approached Evelyn, who deliberately looked away, refusing to intervene.

After a tense silence, Lucas knelt beside Natalie. His hand hovered over her hair before gently stroking it.

Natalie's shoulders trembled with silent sobs. He froze, unsure what to say. Natalie was always so strong—except when it came to her grandmother.

Natalie suddenly stood, her eyes clear despite the tears. "I have work. I need to go."

She gathered the fragments and walked away without looking back.

Lucas moved to follow, but Evelyn stopped him.

"Lucas, your girlfriend isn't just ugly—she's rotten. She broke Natalie's things and didn't even apologize. Who does she think she is?"

The actress shrank back, shocked by Evelyn's bluntness.

Lucas's expression turned glacial. His gaze pinned the actress in place.

"But I—" she stammered.

Lucas cut her off coldly. "A car will take you home. Felicity Chambers is replacing you in the film."

Felicity was her biggest rival. This was career suicide.

As Lucas walked away, the actress scrambled after him, begging and pleading.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Served her right.

She called Natalie, who answered immediately.

"Nikki, I'm fine. Just back at the office. See you soon?"

Evelyn told her what Lucas had done, hoping to cheer her up. Natalie's breathing steadied, her voice lighter.

"At least your brother isn't completely blind."

After hanging up, Natalie received a text from Lucas.

[Jules, I'll have an exact replica made for you.]

She left it unanswered.
###Chapter 560

Evelyn sat at the outdoor café table, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she typed out emails with sharp, irritated strokes. Lucas wasn't filming today, which meant she had to pick him up later.

She didn’t notice the man beside her at first—until she felt the faintest breeze against her cheek.

Evelyn glanced up, frowning. "Xavier, what are you doing?"

It was a crisp autumn day, the air already cool. Why was he fanning her?

Xavier looked sheepish, crouching beside her chair like an eager puppy.

"I didn’t want you to overheat," he admitted, "but I also didn’t want you to get cold."

Evelyn barely resisted rolling her eyes.

He pushed a small plate of freshly cut fruit toward her. "I just sliced these. Would you like some, Ms. Sinclair?"

She nudged it away. "No, thank you."

Xavier didn’t seem bothered. His smile was soft, almost adoring.

"I still can’t believe Mr. Lucas gave me such a big role," he gushed. "The second male lead! It’s incredible!"

Evelyn’s brows lifted slightly.

Second male lead?

"I know it’s because of you," he continued, voice warm with gratitude. "How can I ever repay you?"

His face—so unnervingly similar to Nathan’s—twisted into a delicate, almost feminine smile. It looked wrong. Unnatural.

Evelyn turned away with a dry laugh. "Maybe it’s just your acting skills."

"I won’t disappoint you!"

Xavier clasped his hands together, then speared a piece of fruit with a fork. "Ah—"

Evelyn blinked.

She didn’t open her mouth. He didn’t lower the fork. The silence stretched awkwardly.

With a sigh, she leaned forward and took the bite, then firmly shook her head when he tried to offer another.

Since there were no other chairs, Xavier settled on the ground beside her, chattering excitedly about industry gossip and drama. Evelyn hummed in vague acknowledgment, her mind still stuck on Natalie’s shattered jade pendant.

It had been a gift from Natalie’s grandmother—her only keepsake. Losing it must have devastated her.

A sudden burst of voices cut through her thoughts.

"Mr. Blackwood! With you here, our ratings are guaranteed to soar!"

Evelyn’s head snapped up.

Across the courtyard, beneath the shadowed eaves of the building, stood Nathan. His gaze was dark, unreadable. She had no idea how long he’d been watching.

Xavier’s hand trembled, the fruit slipping from his fork.

At the sound of Nathan’s name, he flinched.

They were rivals, after all.

Nathan had wealth, power, status—but Xavier was convinced Evelyn preferred him. Why else would she have supported him this far?

Bolstered by that thought, he lifted another piece of fruit toward her lips.

Evelyn, distracted, automatically opened her mouth—then froze.

Too late.

She looked back toward the building.

Nathan was gone.

Good. She exhaled. Maybe now he’ll finally give up.

Still, irritation prickled under her skin. She stood abruptly.

Xavier glanced up, confused.

Evelyn gestured toward the set. "The director’s calling you."

He turned, spotting the director waving him over.

Xavier scrambled to his feet, practically vibrating with excitement. "Ms. Sinclair, after filming, I’ll escort you back to your hotel!"

Before she could refuse, he dashed off.

Evelyn stared after him, baffled. Why would I need a hotel?

Then it clicked.

To him, she was his sugar mommy. Of course he’d assume she expected… services.

A cold sneer curled her lips. Disgust flickered in her eyes.

When she turned, Nathan was there.

Right in front of her.

His expression was ice, his gaze hollow.

Evelyn’s pulse jumped.

Damn it. He scared me.
###Chapter 561

Evelyn Sinclair arched a delicate brow, her gaze locking onto Nathan Blackwood.

He advanced with predatory grace, his usual controlled demeanor shattered by raw intensity.

"Going to a hotel?"

His voice was rough, strained with barely contained emotion.

Nathan hated showing her this darker side of himself—the possessive, volatile man beneath the polished exterior. But seeing that carbon-copy of himself near Evelyn had ignited something primal.

Jealousy clawed at his chest, sharp and suffocating.

She knew what that cheap imitation wanted. Yet she allowed him close. Close enough to feed her, to touch her—

While she'd ignored the plate he had prepared for her.

His fingers twitched.

Evelyn didn’t answer. Instead, she tilted her head, lips curving in a mocking smile. "You heard everything, didn’t you?"

Let him misunderstand. Let him seethe.

She owed him no explanations.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. He stepped closer, her sweet floral scent wrapping around him, tightening the coil of frustration in his gut.

"Stay away from him, Evelyn." His voice dropped to a warning growl. "Or I won’t be responsible for what happens next."

Before she could react, his hand cupped her chin, forcing her lips to his.

It wasn’t gentle.

His mouth claimed hers with bruising pressure, as if he could erase the thought of anyone else touching her.

Evelyn didn’t struggle. But her stillness was worse—her cold indifference cutting deeper than any resistance.

Nathan barely registered the metallic tang of blood when she bit him. He only pulled back when he saw the derision in her eyes.

Her lips, reddened from his assault, parted.

"How could a man who’s kind, considerate, and actually attentive ever be your substitute?" Her laugh was soft, venomous. "Tell me, Nathan—could you ever measure up?"

His entire body tensed.

Rage and something far more dangerous flickered in his darkened gaze.

"You’re pushing me," he warned, voice hoarse.

Evelyn merely smiled. "I’m just being honest."

That was the final straw.

Nathan yanked her against him, one arm locking around her waist as his mouth crashed down again.

This time, she didn’t bite.

She didn’t have to.

Every inch of her radiated icy rejection.

Still, he kissed her like a drowning man clinging to his last breath.

When he finally broke away, his thumb traced the curve of her swollen lips, his breathing ragged.

"I can give you everything he does," he murmured, voice thick with desperation.

"If you’ll let me."
###Chapter 562

Nathan Blackwood felt he could become just like those paid companions—serving Evelyn Sinclair with utter devotion if it meant having her back in his life.

His pride meant nothing.
Only Evelyn mattered.

Her intoxicating perfume enveloped him, but her piercing gaze remained icy.

Evelyn reached up and lightly tapped Nathan's jawline. She'd always been drawn to his sharp, aristocratic features.

A cold smirk curled her lips.

"You couldn't possibly compare to the professionals I hire."

Nathan's pupils dilated violently. The way she looked down on him—the way she crushed him—only made him crave her more.

After a stunned pause, he let out a hoarse laugh and cradled her face. His eyes burned crimson—whether from unshed tears or raw desperation.

"Pay me instead. I'll learn fast."

His nose brushed her forehead as his voice cracked.

"I'm cheap. And adaptable."

He surrendered every shred of dignity, letting Evelyn trample over what remained.

Evelyn studied him. Her mocking smile faded.

Her chest constricted painfully. Breathing became difficult.

She'd never seen Nathan like this—broken, begging.

For one fleeting second, her resolve wavered.

But it was too late.

Their story had ended long ago.
Every hope had died with their divorce.

Evelyn's silence shattered Nathan's fragile illusions.

He understood. There was no second chance.

Despair threatened to consume him as he released her, arms falling limply to his sides.

Then an idea struck. Evelyn hooked a finger under his chin.

"Fine. But remember—if you disappoint me even once, you'll disappear when I say so."

Ignoring him only gave him false hope. This way, she could force him to let go—no matter how brutal the method.

Nathan froze.

Despite her cruel tone, euphoria flooded his veins. He felt resurrected.

The lingering redness in his eyes hadn't faded when—

"Mr. Blackwood! We need you over here!"

The director's shout shattered the moment.

Nathan shot the man a murderous glare for the interruption.

Evelyn shoved him away with a scoff.

"Go. Don't waste my time."

She turned toward the makeshift wooden cabin where Lucas Sterling waited.

Nathan longed to follow, but the director kept calling. "Mr. Blackwood! Urgently!"

Gritting his teeth, he forced himself to walk away.

The gazebo had hidden their exchange from the crew, but not from one observer.

Inside the cabin, Lucas narrowed his eyes at Evelyn's swollen lips.

"Tsk. Why didn't you slap Nathan when he touched you? I'd have rushed to your defense."

Evelyn's lack of resistance puzzled him.

Nathan hadn't crossed the line—if anything, Evelyn had dominated the encounter.

She grabbed a tissue, meticulously wiping her mouth before rinsing with bottled water.

Then she dropped the bombshell.

"I'm seeing Nathan Blackwood."

Lucas's jaw dropped.

She continued calmly, "I'll dump him soon."

Lucas choked. "Are you insane? Nathan isn't some toy!"

He gripped her shoulders. "Evelyn, I'll introduce you to hotter, younger guys. Forget him."

This situation reeked of disaster.

Evelyn met his frantic gaze. "Only children choose. Adults take everything they want."
###Chapter 563

Evelyn Sinclair sat quietly, rolling up her sleeves with deliberate movements.

If Lucas heard what she just said, he'd probably burst out laughing.

She couldn't shake Nathan off, and he refused to give up. Fine. Then she'd have to be more... extreme.

Once he got tired of her, he'd stop being so persistent, right?

She wouldn't repeat past mistakes. This time, she'd end it for good.

A few minutes later, Lucas nudged her.

"Look at them."

Evelyn glanced up, squinted, then lowered her gaze again.

Nathan and Xavier stood together not far away, surrounded by staff, the director, and his assistant.

The two men shared similar features but carried entirely different energies. Xavier had a delicate, almost feminine air, shorter than Nathan, his presence lacking the commanding dominance Nathan naturally exuded.

Nathan had finally gotten Evelyn to agree to give him a chance. He wasn't about to waste a single second of it.

But this counterfeit kept appearing in front of him, bold and uninvited.

Disgust churned in Nathan's gut.

He wanted the man gone. Off the set. Immediately.

The director rambled beside him, but Nathan wasn't listening.

The more the director spoke, the darker Nathan's expression grew.

Confused and desperate, the director kept talking, only making things worse.

Lucas smirked, glancing down at Evelyn. "Nathan Blackwood invested in this film. You think he'll kick Xavier out?"

Evelyn turned to him. "How did you even get Xavier cast as the second lead?"

"Was there no one else?"

Lucas raised a brow. "The second lead dies in his first scene. He only exists in flashbacks. No face time needed."

Ah. That explained it.

Evelyn blinked, then lifted a finger, curling it slightly.

"Hey. Come here."

Her voice—cool, smooth—drew every eye in the vicinity.

Everyone froze.

The director and staff exchanged glances.

Who was she calling?

Nathan's jaw tightened, his gaze sharpening.

His shirt collar was slightly open, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly.

Xavier, excited, dropped his script and practically skipped toward the wooden cabin where Evelyn sat.

But before he could reach her, Evelyn said something that made him stop dead.

His face fell.

Disappointed, he turned away.

Evelyn lifted her eyes to Nathan and curled her finger again. Silent.

Nathan chuckled, no trace of irritation left. He strode toward her, steps light, a rare smile playing on his lips.

The entire set went still.

What. Just. Happened.

Evelyn Sinclair had summoned Nathan Blackwood with a finger, and he'd gone to her without hesitation—no temper, no resistance.

People rubbed their eyes, certain they were hallucinating.

The director gaped as Nathan's icy demeanor melted in an instant.

For Nathan, this might have been the highlight of his life.

Better than any award.

He stepped inside, only to pause when he saw Lucas beside Evelyn.

His smile dimmed slightly—but not enough to matter.

He nodded at Lucas in greeting, then arched a brow at Evelyn.

"You called me?"

He'd almost said, Miss me?

But he caught himself.

He wouldn't push his luck in front of Lucas.

Evelyn's expression remained impassive.

"You invested in this film?"

"Yes."

"Xavier is playing the second lead. Don't interfere."
###Chapter 564

Nathan's breath hitched. The air around him thickened with an icy tension.

His sharp gaze darkened. "Her first demand was for that imposter?"

A bitter taste lingered on his tongue. His jaw clenched, shadows flickering in his narrowed eyes.

Something heavy lodged in his throat.

"Can't stand the thought of losing him?"

Evelyn smirked. "Obviously. He's my pawn."

Her fingers tapped the armrest. "I haven't drained Xavier dry yet. Why waste such potential?"

Nathan's earlier satisfaction shattered. It felt like a glacial wave had crashed over him, leaving his veins frozen.

He stood rigid, fists trembling at his sides.

Asking more would only humiliate him further.

Lucas coughed into his fist, suddenly aware of his intrusion.

Nathan was clearly outmatched.

Making excuses, Lucas slipped away.

Silence engulfed the cabin.

Their eyes locked—a silent battle of wills.

Evelyn remained impassive. 'Pathetic.'

Neither his fury nor his departure frightened her.

She lounged elegantly, lips curved in amusement. Unshaken.

Nathan exhaled sharply. Defeat tasted acrid.

His voice dropped. "What am I, then?"

'He's yours. Where do I stand?'

She'd promised him a chance too.

Evelyn's laugh was arctic. "You're not my husband. You mean nothing."

A toy.

A distraction.

"Keep this quiet," she added sweetly. "For both our companies' sakes."

His knuckles whitened. "Ashamed of me?"

She tilted her head. "Practical."

Other women would flaunt their connection to Nathan Blackwood.

She wanted it buried.

Ready to discard him at any moment.

Nathan's expression turned stormy.

"Unless you'd rather end this now?"

The ultimatum hung between them.

His teeth ground together. "Fine."

What choice did he have?

Evelyn rose, brushing his shoulder. Her whisper scorched his ear:

"Take lessons from Xavier. He knows how to please."

With that, she sauntered out, heels clicking triumphantly.

Let him rage. Let him quit.

Her goal was simple: push him until he broke.

Lucas fell into step beside her as they left.

Nathan stood frozen, muscles locked.

The crew buzzed with theories about the power duo's mysterious tension.

Theodore arrived, taking in Nathan's thunderous expression. Gossip about Evelyn swirled in his mind.

"Sir... Ms. Sinclair just—"

Nathan's glare could flay skin.

Theodore backtracked hastily. "Patience, sir. She's testing you."

His voice dropped. "Push back, and she wins."
###Chapter 565

Nathan's brows twitched.

Something heavy struck his chest.

He considered the situation from a different perspective—there was another possibility.

"You're right."

Nathan's voice was low and measured.

Theodore's confidence soared. Nathan actually agreed with him for once.

"We must appear vulnerable," Theodore insisted. "No matter how she tries to provoke you, don't react."

He leaned in, lowering his voice. "Sometimes, even cruelty can be a twisted form of love."

Nathan gave a solemn nod, his expression shifting subtly.

Theodore grinned. "Endure this, and she'll be yours."

Evelyn and Lucas left the set and headed straight to Natalie's apartment.

Natalie lived alone, with no family nearby.

The housekeeper greeted them at the door.

"Is Ms. Beaumont home?"

"She's in the study," the housekeeper murmured. "She doesn't seem... well."

The woman had worked for Natalie for years—she could read her moods instantly.

Evelyn nodded and walked to the study, knocking lightly. When there was no answer, she pushed the door open.

The room was dim.

Natalie sat slumped over the desk, a shattered jade pendant lying before her.

It was as if her memories had been ripped away. The pain was unbearable.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, dull with grief.

Evelyn approached, unsure how to comfort her.

She placed a hand on Natalie's shoulder. Natalie shuddered, then turned and clung to her, sobbing.

"Grandma said... her soul was in this pendant. That she'd stay with me forever." Her voice cracked. "Now it's broken. Is she... gone?"

Evelyn's own eyes burned before she could speak.

"No," she whispered. "She'll always love you."

Natalie wept harder.

Her parents had died in a car crash when she was in elementary school. Her grandmother raised her—they were inseparable.

The pendant was the last gift Natalie received before her grandmother's health deteriorated. She passed away within a week.

Natalie had been overseas for work. She never made it back in time to say goodbye.

It haunted her.

Eventually, Natalie's sobs quieted.

The housekeeper knocked. "Ms. Beaumont, I made soup. Would you like some?"

Natalie shook her head, and the woman retreated.

She went to the bathroom, splashed water on her face. When she returned, only the faint redness in her eyes betrayed her earlier breakdown.

Evelyn's chest ached.

She and Isabella had always had their families' protection—freedom to act recklessly.

But Natalie? She clawed her way up alone. Built her empire from nothing.

Even the housekeeper addressed her as Ms. Beaumont, not Miss.

Natalie forced a thin smile.

"I don't want to see that actress again," she said flatly. "I want her career over."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Done. Even if you hadn't asked, Lucas and I already planned it."

"Lucas is willing to drop her?" Natalie's voice was hoarse from crying.

"It's just business. Dominic Kingsley wanted to boost some rookie using Lucas's fame." Evelyn shrugged. "If she fails, they'll replace her."

Natalie opened her mouth—then let out a dry laugh.

"Right. But Lucas still has to agree."

Evelyn hesitated. A buried memory surfaced.

Back in college, Natalie and Lucas had dated briefly. They kept it secret.

Evelyn only found out when Natalie ended it.

At the time, it seemed insignificant—Lucas never spoke of it, moved on quickly.

But now?

Natalie's fixation on that actress...

Was it because of Lucas?

The doorbell rang, cutting through the tension.

Evelyn exhaled.

"Jules," she said softly. "Lucas is here."
###Chapter 566

Lucas entered carrying an ebony box, his movements unusually careful.

Natalie wasn't in the mood for visitors. She gave Lucas a brief greeting before signaling the housekeeper to prepare tea, then moved listlessly to the sitting area.

Her distance from Lucas was palpable compared to her usual warmth with Evelyn. Oblivious, Lucas placed the box before her with a hopeful smile. "Nat, look. This jade matches 99% of your pendant's quality. Same origin, same veining. I'll carve you a new one - same design or something different?"

Evelyn sipped her tea, barely suppressing an eye roll. Had Lucas been kicked by a mule? The jade wasn't the point. No replacement could mend Natalie's broken heart. Idiot.

Natalie examined the stone. Not top-grade, but remarkably similar to her shattered keepsake. Finding such a match must have cost considerable effort and money.

She met Lucas's eager gaze with a tired smile. "Don't bother. Similar isn't the same. I won't deceive myself."

Lucas froze, shooting Evelyn a helpless look.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Just remembered a conference call. I should go." She recognized Lucas's silent plea for privacy instantly. Something was definitely brewing between them.

The housekeeper discreetly exited.

Lucas tried again. "It's about sentiment. Does authenticity really matter if the meaning remains?"

Natalie's icy stare could frost glass. "It matters." Her discomfort was visceral.

Lucas rubbed his temples. "Understood. I'll find another solution. Rest well." He departed without another word.

Meanwhile, Nathan returned to his office and issued crisp orders. "Bring him to me." He'd promised Evelyn not to remove that damned lookalike from the production, but made no promises about leaving him untouched. Nathan's patience had limits.

The night hung heavy with impending rain when Nathan's security team confirmed the target's location. Nathan left his office, selected an unremarkable vehicle from his private garage, and drove into the gloom.

At the hotel, Xavier Delmont was escorted to a dim chamber. Too many prying eyes on set - this required discretion.

When told Evelyn Sinclair requested his presence, Xavier had practically sprinted from filming. A wealthy socialite summoning him? He wouldn't keep her waiting. The hotel location stoked his fantasies - surely this meant romantic interest.

Instead of the heiress, five hulking bodyguards surrounded him. Xavier's excitement curdled into fear.

The door opened to synchronized footsteps. A guard nodded deferentially as Nathan Blackwood entered.

Xavier's pulse spiked. He attempted to rise, but an iron grip forced him back down.

Nathan surveyed his doppelgänger with a predator's smile, eyes glacially cold. "Mr. Ferguson— I mean, where's Ms. Sinclair? She asked to see me—" Xavier's voice cracked.

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously at the slip. "You're desperate to see Ms. Sinclair?" The threat in his tone was unmistakable.

Xavier suddenly understood - one wrong word, and he might never leave this room alive.
###Chapter 567

Xavier's throat tightened. A flicker of terror flashed in his eyes.

"N-No... Mr. Blackwood, you've got it all wrong."

Nathan loomed over Xavier, his towering presence emphasizing the insurmountable gap between them.

The difference wasn't just physical. Nathan's sheer dominance made Xavier seem insignificant - a mere insect beneath his polished shoes.

Xavier's pathetic little schemes crumbled to dust under Nathan's gaze.

How dare this imitation think he could replace the original?

"Got it wrong?" Nathan's laugh was ice-cold. He flung medical records at Xavier's face. "You spent nearly a million dollars to copy my face?" The documents fluttered to the ground. "Imagine what the media would do with these."

Xavier's hands trembled as he stared at the damning evidence.

"Mr. Blackwood, please—"

This was his darkest secret. After the accident that ruined his face, the surgeon had suggested using a template. Xavier had chosen Nathan Blackwood without hesitation - the most powerful financier in the country, whose looks surpassed most actors.

His career was finally taking off. The public despised plastic surgery frauds. If this got out...

Xavier dropped to his knees, scrambling forward. Nathan's bodyguards blocked him before he could touch their boss.

"Please don't expose me! I'll do anything! I'll stay away from Ms. Sinclair, I swear! My career—"

Nathan's contemptuous gaze cut him off.

Xavier knew the truth. Evelyn only tolerated him because he resembled Nathan Blackwood. Without that resemblance, he was nothing.

"Anything?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously.

"Yes! Anything!"

"How far did things go with Evelyn?"

Nathan had watched them all day. Their familiarity. Their private jokes. The way Evelyn touched Xavier's arm.

He needed to know. The uncertainty was driving him mad.

Xavier shook his head violently. "N-Nothing happened!"

Nathan's kick sent Xavier sprawling. The impact cracked ribs.

Xavier gasped, clutching his chest. Each breath was agony.

"It's true! Industry veterans told me to... to cater to wealthy patrons. I was just playing the part! She's my biggest investor—"

Nathan turned away in disgust.

Xavier thought it was over.

Then strong hands yanked him up by the hair. Fists rained down. Kicks landed in his ribs. He curled into a ball, sobbing.

"I told the truth! Why—"

Twenty brutal minutes later, the beating stopped.

A bodyguard leaned down. "Remember your place. Some people aren't for the likes of you."

They left him broken on the floor.

Evelyn Sinclair was forever out of reach.

Outside, Nathan exhaled. The weight lifted from his shoulders.

Theodore had been right. Evelyn was using Xavier to push him away.

But Nathan Blackwood didn't back down.

He pulled out his phone and typed a message to Evelyn.
###Chapter 568

Sterling Manor.

Evelyn Sinclair sipped her morning tea while scrolling through her phone. Nathan Blackwood's message made her choke on her drink.

"Damn it!" She coughed violently, tea spraying across the table.

Lucas Sterling barely glanced up from repairing Natalie Beaumont's jade pendant. "Must you always act like a commoner? Where are your high society manners?"

Before Evelyn could respond, William Sterling frowned from across the room. "Careful, darling. Don't hurt yourself."

Lucas rolled his eyes, realizing he'd been outmaneuvered again.

Evelyn laughed and immediately locked her phone screen. Some messages weren't worth the retinal damage.

She studied Lucas carefully as he hunched over his work, watching tutorials while piecing together the delicate jewelry.

"Piece of cake. I'm practically a master now."

William snorted. "This idiot already destroyed half my study's jade collection with his 'repairs'."

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle at the revelation.

"Lucas, do you still have feelings for Natalie?"

The thought of Natalie becoming her sister-in-law made Evelyn giddy with excitement.

Lucas froze mid-movement before shooting her a warning glare. "Don't be ridiculous."

William's ears practically perked up at the potential gossip. "What do you mean 'still'? I always thought Natalie would suit Alexander better."

Alexander Sterling nearly dropped his coffee cup while petting Leo. "Father, we've barely spoken!"

Lucas suddenly looked panicked. "They're completely incompatible! Alexander's practically asexual! Natalie would be miserable with him!"

William blinked slowly before turning to Evelyn.

Evelyn cleared her throat delicately. "Father was just making conversation. Why so defensive?"

Realizing his outburst, Lucas muttered, "I'm not!" before returning to his work.

Evelyn smirked. "Want me to help you win her over?"

Lucas's ears turned crimson. "No. We've already established we're not right for each other."

Evelyn feigned disinterest. "True. Your little black book could wallpaper Manhattan. Someone like you could never deserve our Natalie Beaumont."

Lucas's expression cycled through several emotions before settling on resignation. He simply lowered his head and continued repairing the pendant.

Early next morning...

Preston Sinclair never called before noon. This unprecedented dawn summons meant trouble.

"Good morning, Ms. Sterling."

Evelyn rubbed sleep from her eyes. "Mr. Sinclair. This must be urgent."

"Kingsley Tech's joint project has been suspended indefinitely. R&D timelines are tight enough without delays. Ms. Sterling, is there something I should know about Pacific Crest's financial situation?"

Evelyn's hand froze mid-sip of her morning milk.

Suspended? Since when?

"Mr. Sinclair, I'll investigate immediately. This won't affect our partnership."

After hanging up, Evelyn dressed quickly and headed straight to Kingsley Tech headquarters - unannounced.

Benjamin Carter, her mole at Kingsley Tech, hadn't sent any warnings.

This silence spoke volumes.

Evelyn strode through the corporate lobby in a tailored dress, heels clicking purposefully toward Benjamin's office.

Benjamin shot up from his chair in shock. "Ms. Sterling?"

She didn't bother with pleasantries. "What's happening at Kingsley Tech?"

Benjamin shook his head. "Nothing unusual."

"That joint venture with Mr. Sinclair - why was it suspended?"

Another head shake. "I haven't heard anything about that."

Evelyn's gaze darkened. The game had changed.
###Chapter 569

Evelyn suddenly remembered something and dialed Emily Whitaker's number.

"Evelyn?" Emily sounded delighted. Background chatter buzzed around her.

Evelyn chuckled. "Emily, are you at the office?"

"No, I'm at the Great God Donovan's research lab. I'm on vacation, so he invited me to check out his latest project. It's incredible!"

"You're on vacation?" Evelyn's expression darkened.

"Yeah! Mr. Kingsley gave us two weeks off. Honestly, it was unexpected—the project isn't even halfway done, and we haven't cracked the core tech yet."

Under normal circumstances, researchers wouldn't get extended leave during a critical project. At most, they'd rotate shifts or receive bonuses.

"Two weeks?" Evelyn's face turned icy.

She pressed her lips together, inhaling sharply.

"Emily, I'll talk to Dominic and get to the bottom of this. We'll speak later."

She ended the call.

Benjamin Carter's face paled. Dominic Kingsley had authorized a lengthy break for the R&D team, yet he hadn't heard a word about it.

"Ms. Sinclair... I had no idea—"

"Of course you didn't," Evelyn cut in coldly. "They made sure of that."

Benjamin panicked. His role had always felt too smooth—a fresh graduate handed major responsibilities, treated with deference by Dominic Kingsley and Nathan Blackwood's people. He'd assumed that with Evelyn overseeing the three-way partnership, nothing could go wrong.

Yet this had happened right under his nose.

Evelyn strode away in her heels, her posture rigid. Passing colleagues greeted her, and she forced a polite smile.

On the surface, she appeared composed.

Inside, fury simmered.

She marched straight to Dominic's office.

His secretary blinked in surprise. "Ms. Sinclair? What brings you here?"

Evelyn smiled thinly. "Is Mr. Kingsley in?"

The secretary nodded. "Yes, he's inside."

Without waiting for an announcement, Evelyn pushed the door open.

Dominic was on a call but quickly hung up when he saw her. His charming smile faltered at her stormy expression.

"Ms. Sinclair, what a pleasant surprise. Perfect timing—I'll call Nathan, and we can all have lunch. There's a new restaurant—"

Evelyn's gaze was glacial. Her lips curled into a mocking smirk.

"Mr. Kingsley, is Kingsley Tech going bankrupt?"

Dominic stiffened. He looked away.

"Just say what you mean, Ms. Sinclair."

"You gave the R&D team an extended vacation without board approval. Worse, you didn’t assign replacements, halting progress entirely. If this isn’t sabotage, it’s gross incompetence."

She didn’t mince words.

This wasn’t just about Preston Sinclair’s project. Sterling Enterprises, as a direct partner, stood to lose millions.

Dominic’s eyes flickered with guilt. If not for that person’s orders, he’d never have dared.

"You misunderstand. It’s just a short break. After resolving the AI car issue, I thought the team deserved some rest."

Evelyn scoffed. "Two weeks is short? Are you deliberately stalling Preston’s project?"

Dominic pressed his lips together. "Of course not."

"I recommended Preston Sinclair partner with your company. If you want out, terminate the contract properly. These underhanded tactics don’t suit you."

"It wasn’t my decision!"

"Then whose was it?" Evelyn demanded.
###Chapter 570

The office atmosphere turned glacial in an instant.

Dominic Kingsley studied Evelyn Sinclair's expression, realizing with growing dread that she wasn't bluffing. His reckless move had backfired spectacularly.

This wasn't just about Preston Sinclair anymore. His actions had dragged Sterling Enterprises into the mess too.

Evelyn would never compromise her company's interests. If she discovered Nathan Blackwood's involvement, it wouldn't just strain their personal relationship - it could shatter their three-way business alliance.

As Dominic hesitated, Evelyn's sharp gaze narrowed in realization. "Who put you up to this?"

His lips pressed into a thin line, face paling. "No one—This was my own poor judgment. I'll recall all staff from leave immediately."

"Mr. Kingsley," Evelyn's voice cut like ice. "This matter won't be settled so simply."

She maintained unblinking eye contact. "My legal team will draft new contract terms with strict research deadlines. Sterling will conduct regular progress audits. Fail to comply, and we terminate our partnership. Kingsley Tech isn't Sterling's only option."

Dominic's expression darkened imperceptibly. Outwardly calm, internally he was scrambling.

Evelyn's ruthless pivot caught him completely off guard.

He'd underestimated her. At Kingsley Tech's current scale, they posed no real threat to Sterling Enterprises - especially with her brother Donovan Sterling, the renowned scientist, in her corner.

This time, the fault was entirely his. Evelyn wouldn't let this slide easily.

Compared to how she'd dismantled Ashford Group, merely revising their contract was downright merciful.

If she decided to retaliate fully, not even Nathan Blackwood could save him.

Dominic cleared his throat, adopting a conciliatory tone. "Let's discuss this over lunch, Ms. Sterling—"

Her cold laugh interrupted him. "This isn't negotiable. Our relationship hasn't reached the point where we joke about corporate interests." She leaned forward. "You'll bear full responsibility for these losses."

Pressure mounted as Evelyn's professional ruthlessness surpassed even Nathan's. Yet Dominic couldn't betray his ally.

"Ms. Sterling, I'll cover the losses, but—"

"No conditions." Evelyn stood abruptly. "Because I'm the client."

Her message delivered, she turned sharply and exited without waiting for a response.

Whether Dominic acted alone or on orders didn't matter. Evelyn needed him to understand—their relationship existed solely for mutual business gain.

The moment Evelyn left Kingsley Tech headquarters, she summoned Sterling's legal team, ordering immediate contract revisions to clarify Kingsley Tech's liabilities.

Dominic wasted no time calling Nathan Blackwood after her departure.

His attempt to teach Preston a lesson had backfired spectacularly, angering Evelyn instead.

When Nathan answered, Dominic recounted events while massaging his temples. "I tried, Mr. Blackwood. But Ms. Sterling isn't backing down. If she starts auditing our R&D—"

Silence stretched on Nathan's end.

Dominic checked if the call dropped.

Then Nathan spoke: "Let her."

Dominic blinked. "That's not the support I expected after calling you."

Nathan's final words chilled him: "Don't betray me."
###Chapter 571

Dominic Kingsley stared blankly at the cloudless sky outside his office window. His chest tightened with an unbearable sense of injustice.

He had no choice but to obey Nathan Blackwood's orders.

Evelyn Sinclair was on her way back to the office when her phone buzzed with Nathan's call.

She considered ignoring it, but after a brief hesitation, she answered. "Mr. Blackwood, what do you want?"

Nathan's voice was smooth, laced with unmistakable amusement. He was clearly in high spirits.

Even if their relationship wasn't public, they were far from just friends. Eventually, they would reconcile.

"I just found out about Dominic Kingsley's little stunt. As a director of Kingsley Tech, I wasn't even informed. I’ve already reprimanded him—don’t worry, it won’t affect the project."

Evelyn stayed silent for several seconds before responding.

"Do you think I’m stupid?"

Dominic wouldn’t dare sabotage the project without orders from higher up.

Nathan paused, feigning surprise. "What are you implying? That I told him to do this? I’d never resort to such underhanded tactics."

His chest tightened. If Evelyn was truly angry, their fragile progress would shatter instantly.

The thought was unbearable.

Every second of her silence felt like torture, a knife twisting in his chest.

Finally, she scoffed, her voice icy. "Nathan Blackwood, you never fail to surprise me."

Just as she was about to hang up, Nathan blurted out, "Sweetheart, wait!"

Evelyn froze.

Had she misheard? Did he just—?

"Nathan, be serious for once. I don’t want to hear that nonsense from you again."

Disgusting. That kind of sickening pet name had no place between them.

Nathan chuckled lowly. "You don’t like it? I can try another."

Silence.

He thought for a moment. "How about 'baby'?"

Theodore Winslow had told him that pet names were the first step to rebuilding intimacy.

He’d prefer to call her "wife," but he knew Evelyn would murder him on the spot.

Weren’t all couples these days unbearably clingy?

Nathan used to find it childish. Now, he craved it.

He was already brainstorming names for their future children.

Evelyn’s silence stretched for a full minute. The sharp click of her heels echoed—she must have stepped into an elevator.

Hearing the nickname, her face twisted in disbelief. What the hell?

She regretted ever giving Nathan a second chance. Even as a facade, this was too much.

Nathan mistook her silence for dissatisfaction.

"Babe" might not be as intimate as "baby," but it was better than nothing.

He spun the pen in his hand—a limited edition worth thousands—unable to contain his excitement.

The sound of Evelyn’s footsteps stopped as the elevator doors closed.

Finally, she gritted out, "Do I need to book you an appointment with a psychiatrist?"

Nathan’s voice dropped. "Only you can cure this heart disease."

Damn it. Evelyn hung up before he could say more.

That bastard knew exactly how to flirt when he wanted to.

Few could resist his charm.

Her ears burned. She refused to let his sweet words sway her.

Was I too lenient last time? He was nearly in tears then...
###Chapter 572

The elevator ascended swiftly to the penthouse. Evelyn Sinclair strode back into her office with purposeful steps.

Bennett entered moments later with a progress report. His eyes narrowed with concern when he noticed Evelyn's flushed cheeks. "Ms. Sinclair, are you feeling unwell? Should I call Dr. Whitmore?"

Evelyn's expression hardened imperceptibly. "That won't be necessary." Her voice carried its usual cool authority.

She quickly reviewed the documents before signing with a flourish. "Push legal to finalize the acquisition terms with Kingsley Tech immediately. No concessions on our terms."

Bennett blinked in surprise. This was the first time she'd issued such an uncompromising directive. "Understood."

He didn't question further, heading straight to legal to relay Evelyn's orders. Given Kingsley Tech's contractual breaches, they had little bargaining power left.

Her phone vibrated with an incoming call from Dominic Kingsley. "We found Xavier Delmont," he announced without preamble. "Horizon Media cut him off completely after that scandal. The man's practically destitute now. Took quite the beating too, from what I hear."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Any leads on who arranged it?"

Dominic chuckled darkly. "Didn't dig too deep. If it traces back to our side, things could get messy. Xavier's keeping his head down now - won't even file a police report. Should we keep him on ice for now?"

"Do what you think best." Evelyn's tone suggested she'd already lost interest.

She ended the call, one thought lingering. Part of her suspected Nathan Blackwood's involvement, but even Xavier wouldn't confirm it.

Perhaps it didn't matter. The arrogant model had gotten exactly what he deserved.

Her phone chimed again - a message from Preston Sinclair. [Dinner tonight? To celebrate the Pacific Heights Project's success.]

Evelyn hesitated only briefly before replying. Preston always presented impeccable reasons she couldn't refuse. [Perfect.]

She arrived at the exclusive restaurant precisely at eight. The establishment boasted complete privacy with its cleverly designed semi-open booths - patrons could neither see nor be seen unless deliberately peering around partitions.

Evelyn noted the intimate ambiance immediately. More suited for romantic trysts than business dinners, with its dim lighting and secluded corners.

Preston had secured a window table where city lights twinkled like scattered diamonds. The soft glow accentuated his aristocratic profile, making him appear almost ethereal.

He rose instantly when she approached, pulling out her chair with practiced grace. "The pastry chef here comes highly recommended. Their chocolate soufflé is particularly exquisite."

The unspoken intimacy of his gesture wasn't lost on Evelyn. She acknowledged it with polite detachment. "Thank you."

Preston's smile remained serene as ever, his demeanor that of a man completely at ease. "Dominic Kingsley came crawling to my hotel yesterday. Full of apologies and empty promises. He practically begged me to intercede with you." His eyes gleamed with quiet amusement. "I suppose I have you to thank for that."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Merely protecting our interests. Sterling Enterprises recommended Kingsley Tech for this collaboration. If they jeopardize the timeline, we'll replace them without hesitation."

Preston's eyebrows lifted fractionally at her ruthlessness before comprehension dawned. He'd done his due diligence on Kingsley Tech's shareholders.

Her severity, he realized, was directed at one particular investor.
###Chapter 573

The tension between Preston and Evelyn gradually eased as they changed topics.

Preston shared updates about Oliver's recent antics.

When Evelyn mentioned sending the boy an entire crate of practice exams, Oliver had thrown such a tantrum that he'd cried himself to sleep. Not even Preston could calm him down.

Their conversation flowed naturally now, the earlier stiffness forgotten.

Laughter bubbled between them when a waiter's cheerful greeting abruptly cut through the moment. Seconds later, an icy presence prickled Evelyn's spine.

Before she could turn, a firm arm draped possessively over her shoulders. Nathan slid into the booth beside her, his grip unyielding as his fingers dug into her waist.

Evelyn stiffened. Nathan's lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his darkened eyes. "What a coincidence, darling."

The endearment dropped the temperature around them to subzero.

Evelyn met his gaze coolly. "Remove your hand."

"Nathan!" Preston interjected sharply, breaking the tension. "This is a public place. Show some respect."

Nathan had arrived with a group of associates, though his attention had immediately zeroed in on Evelyn and Preston the moment he spotted them.

His jaw clenched. He couldn't afford to make a scene—not when it would only make Preston look like the reasonable one. Reluctantly, he withdrew his hand.

"Mr. Sinclair," Nathan bit out, "I see you're neglecting your business to focus on matters that don't concern you."

Preston's smile remained pleasant, though his eyes glinted with equal frost. "I could say the same about you, Mr. Blackwood. Shouldn't you be attending to your guests?"

The unspoken challenge hung between them. Both men knew they were on equal footing when it came to Evelyn—and neither intended to back down.

Nathan's chest tightened at the thought of Preston having dinner with Evelyn's family. The idea of them dining alone together now was unbearable.

He turned to his assistant. "Harrison, take everyone ahead. I'll join you shortly."

Once the group had been ushered away, Nathan's gaze flicked between Evelyn's indifferent expression and Preston's composed demeanor. His temper flared, but he directed it solely at Preston.

Leaning closer to Evelyn, he brushed a strand of hair behind her ear with exaggerated tenderness. "Eat something first. I'll be right back."

The gesture was performative, and Evelyn saw right through it.

His acting had certainly improved.

She ignored him entirely, focusing instead on the dessert in front of her.

Nathan's expression darkened. He shot Preston a warning glare before stalking off.

Preston watched him leave, thoughtful. "He seems... different."

Evelyn glanced up. "Or just agitated."

Preston chuckled knowingly. Something had clearly shifted between them.

Nathan returned after a perfunctory toast with his associates, too distracted to stay away any longer.

The sight of Evelyn and Preston laughing together sent a sharp pang through him.

Does she really consider me insignificant?

The bitter thought twisted in his chest.

And yet, I haven't even begun to fulfill my role.
###Chapter 574

Nathan stormed out with a dark expression, cutting through their conversation like a blade.

His voice dripped with barely concealed jealousy.

"What's so amusing that you're laughing like this?"

Preston glanced at Evelyn, who calmly sipped her espresso. Her delicate fingers wrapped around the cup like porcelain. After a brief pause, Preston answered smoothly. "Ms. Sterling just shared a hilarious story. Care to hear it, Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze to Preston but remained silent.

Nathan's jaw tightened. She told Preston a joke?

"Mind if I join?" He didn't wait for permission before sliding into the seat beside Evelyn, his posture territorial.

His knee brushed against hers beneath the table. She shifted away instinctively.

Evelyn's skirt rode up slightly when she moved. Noticing this, Nathan deliberately let his leg press against hers again. Electricity shot through him at the contact.

His gaze dropped to her toned calves. He couldn't look away.

How could mere legs be so damn distracting?

After a few seconds, he forced himself to glance aside before his thoughts spiraled.

Evelyn shot him an icy glare. This time, instead of retreating, she kicked him sharply under the table.

Nathan paled. "Fuck! That hurt!"

The movement was subtle enough that Preston missed it entirely.

Nathan plastered on a smile. "Dining with Mr. Sinclair is quite entertaining. Next time, do invite me."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously before she turned to Preston. "I should head home now. Goodnight."

Preston hesitated. "Actually, there's something I wanted to ask—"

She waited.

"I'll be traveling for business soon. Oliver will be alone here with just his nanny and bodyguard, but he's... difficult. Could you possibly look after him for a few days?"

Understanding dawned immediately.

Nathan scoffed. "Take the brat with you if you're worried. Why burden others?"

That annoying kid always ruined his plans anyway.

Evelyn ignored him. "Of course. I'll arrange for him to stay at Sterling Manor."

Nathan's mood darkened further, but before he could protest—

"Thank you." Preston smiled warmly. "I owe you one."

No one acknowledged Nathan's scowl.

As Evelyn stood to leave, Nathan followed like a shadow.

When she entered her car, he claimed the passenger seat without hesitation.

Evelyn stared blankly at the dashboard. "Where's your car?"

"I had wine earlier." His tone was breezy. "My driver's drunk too."

A blatant lie.

"Evelyn," his voice dropped, rough with need, "stop meeting him alone. I can't take it."

She exhaled sharply. "Nathan Blackwood, remember our arrangement must stay secret."

His eyes darkened. In one fluid motion, he closed the distance between them, his breath hot against her ear. "What arrangement? Being your fake lover is torture. Let's make it real."

Evelyn tilted her head, studying him. So the wolf finally showed his teeth.

Nathan's gaze burned with intensity, but she remained unmoved. With a derisive smirk, she started the engine.

"Where are we going?" he asked.

"A hotel." Her reply was clipped.
###Chapter 575

Nathan Blackwood was stunned.

His eyes lit up with delight before he realized this wasn't the way back to the hotel.

Maybe she’s worried about being seen and wants somewhere more private?

His pulse raced. Excitement tangled with nerves in a way he’d never experienced before.

The dim streetlights flickered like stars guiding him toward happiness. Even the biting wind felt softer against his skin.

Then something felt off.

The further they drove, the more trees surrounded them.

We’re heading into the suburbs… Did she really pick the middle of nowhere for this?

His gaze flicked to the fuel gauge.

His blood ran cold.

They were almost out of gas.

Before he could warn her, the car jerked to a stop.

Confused, he turned to Evelyn Sinclair.

She suddenly lunged at him, pressing against his chest.

His heart stuttered.

Before he could react, his seatbelt clicked open. The door beside him swung wide.

A gust of icy wind slapped him awake.

She’s throwing me out.

His jaw clenched. Dark eyes locked onto hers as she tilted her chin up.

Her voice was deceptively soft.

"Get out."

No explanation. No hesitation.

His chest tightened.

He stepped onto the deserted road.

"If I said something wrong earlier, I can apologize—"

Damn it. Too eager. Too obvious.

The car door slammed shut. The window rolled down just enough for her to speak.

Her question hit like a blade.

"Did you order Kingsley Tech to bury the research?"

His heart lurched.

"No—"

The window closed. The engine roared to life.

Tires screeched as she spun the car around in a cloud of dust.

She’s really leaving me here?

His body tensed. He lunged forward, fists clenched—

Then froze.

"If I tell you the truth, will you forgive me?"

Evelyn laughed.

The sound was sharp. Mocking.

His stomach dropped.

Shit. That was basically a confession.

Spending so much time with Theodore has rotted my brain.

The window was already up. Her icy stare sent a chill through him.

Then the car shot forward.

He stumbled back, watching helplessly as she vanished into the night.

Alone in the silence, he exhaled a bitter laugh.

Hah. She outplayed me again.

The wind howled. The cold seeped into his bones.

What a spectacular downfall.

He pulled out his phone and dialed Theodore with a scowl.

Meanwhile, Oliver Sinclair bounced on his toes, too excited to sleep.

The moment he heard his father was leaving town—and he’d get to stay with Pretty Lady—his entire world brightened.

Preston Sinclair leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, watching his son stuff clothes and toys into a suitcase twice his size.

The boy looked ready to move out permanently.

How much does he hate this house?

Even the nanny and bodyguard were helping, their relief palpable.

As if Sterling Manor was some kind of paradise.

Preston cleared his throat.

Oliver didn’t even glance up.

"Daddy, don’t worry! I’ll be so good for Pretty Lady!" A pause. "No—Pretty Lady will take such good care of me!"

Preston’s lips twitched.

Our father-son bond is nothing compared to his obsession with Evelyn.

If Nathan Blackwood hadn’t been circling Evelyn like a vulture, Preston would’ve taken Oliver with him.

But leaving the boy with her?

That would drive Nathan crazy.

With a smirk, Preston added, "Don’t pester Ms. Sterling too much. She has other admirers, you know."

A calculated pause.

"Like Nathan Blackwood from Blackwood Industries."

He let the name hang in the air.

That man is obsessed with her.
###Chapter 576

Oliver Sinclair leaped off the bed, his eyes wide with determination.

He tilted his head and pouted at Preston. "No way! Pretty Lady is mine and only mine!"

"That Mean Man can't get anywhere near her! I won't allow it!"

This was Oliver's rare chance to spend time alone with Evelyn since his father was away. He wasn't about to let anyone ruin it.

"Mean Man won't get a single second with my Pretty Lady," Oliver thought stubbornly.

Preston smirked at the boy's defiant expression.

"Perfect. With my son guarding Evelyn, I can handle my overseas business without worry."

Satisfied, Preston turned and left the room.

Oliver immediately called his nanny and bodyguard to pack his things. He even dialed Evelyn himself to announce he'd be arriving at her place alone the next day—no need for arrangements.

He couldn't wait to see her.

At dawn, the Sterling Manor gates swung open.

Oliver stood in the living room, backpack in hand, facing a barely awake Lucas Sterling. Without warning, the boy dashed forward and hugged Lucas's legs, beaming. "Good morning, third brother!"

Lucas blinked. "Since when is this kid so sweet? Is his entire personality made of sugar?"

He chuckled and pinched Oliver's cheeks. "You should call me Uncle Lucas."

(After all, your dad is chasing my sister...)

Oliver shook his head stubbornly. "Pretty Lady's brother is my brother too!"

Lucas played along for a bit before grabbing his things and heading out.

Evelyn came downstairs moments later, her heart melting at the sight of Oliver quietly playing with his toys on the floor.

She had prepared a room for him, but when it was time to leave, he insisted on following her.

Evelyn sighed. Not wanting him to be lonely, she took him to the office.

Work consumed her the moment she stepped inside. Thankfully, Oliver behaved, silently doing his online classes in the corner.

At noon, she took him to a nearby restaurant for lunch.

And of course, Nathan Blackwood was there.

Nathan lounged in the lobby, cigarette between his fingers, dressed in all black. His stern expression made the man across from him visibly nervous.

Then he spotted Evelyn.

A flicker of delight crossed his face as he stubbed out the cigarette and stood, his demeanor shifting instantly to charming.

The man opposite him gaped at the sudden transformation.

"Darling, fate keeps bringing us together. Seeing you is the highlight of my day."

Evelyn's expression turned icy.

"Darling?"

The nickname made her want to gag.

She rolled her eyes. "Unfortunately, it's the worst part of mine."

Nathan's smile faltered, but he didn't back down.

(Theodore had reminded him—if Evelyn rejected him, he had to double his efforts. Eventually, she'd soften.)

With that in mind, Nathan pulled out a chair for her.

The man across the table scrambled to his feet. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll... reschedule. Goodbye."

Nathan barely acknowledged him as the man fled.

Evelyn ignored the offered seat, choosing one opposite Nathan instead.

He considered sitting there himself—until Oliver darted over and plopped into the chair.

Nathan clenched his jaw. This brat was just like Preston Sinclair—always stealing what was his.

Oliver swung his legs, grinning. "Mr. Blackwood, looks like there's no seat left for you."
###Chapter 577

Nathan's eyes darkened as his jaw clenched. In one swift motion, he scooped up the boy and deposited him onto the nearest chair.

His dominance was absolute. Little Oliver didn't stand a chance against his strength.

Once settled, Nathan returned to his seat, loosening his collar. "There. Now we have space."

Evelyn shot him a warning glare. "Nathan Blackwood, he's just a child."

Nathan arched a brow, glancing at Oliver's red-rimmed eyes. "And? He's not ours."

Evelyn fell silent.

Oliver seethed, shooting Nathan a venomous look. His chest burned with frustration. If only he were older—he'd whisk Pretty Lady away and never look back.

"Pretty Lady, I can't eat with him here," Oliver muttered, his voice icy.

Evelyn sighed, turning to Nathan. "Leave."

Nathan's lips twitched. Harsh.

He forced a smirk, addressing Oliver. "Then close your eyes. Problem solved."

His gaze then slid back to Evelyn, voice dropping to a husky murmur. "It's been too long. Don't tell me you haven't missed me."

Evelyn smiled lazily. "You're hardly the only man in my life. Why would I?"

Nathan's expression darkened, but he reined in his temper.

He knew she was baiting him, trying to drive him away. But he wouldn't budge.

"None of them compare to me," he countered, eyes glinting with possessive intensity.

Evelyn ignored him, refusing to engage further in front of Oliver.

Dinner passed in tense silence. Nathan didn't touch his food—he just watched her, his gaze predatory. Like a panther stalking its prey.

Oliver stabbed at his kid's meal, shooting wary glances at Nathan. His small fists clenched. If only he weren't so powerless.

When they finished, Nathan insisted on driving them home. Evelyn refused, but he simply hoisted Oliver onto his shoulder and strode out.

Oliver yelped, flailing indignantly. He was being treated like luggage!

Evelyn had no choice but to follow.

Nathan suddenly caught her wrist. "The Whitmores' gala is tomorrow. We're going together."

Evelyn frowned. She'd received an invitation too but didn't know the occasion. Still, it was a networking opportunity—she'd attend regardless.

"No thanks. I'll find my own date."

Nathan's smile turned dangerous. "I'll pick you up at eight. If I see another man near you..." His voice dropped. "I'll ruin him."

Evelyn's lips curved coldly. Unfazed.

Nathan didn't let go. Her skin was so soft. So right in his grasp.

She belonged to him. No one else even deserved to look at her.

His grip tightened as they reached the car.

Evelyn pulled free. "What's the gala for, anyway?"

Nathan smirked. "Tristan Whitmore is remarrying his ex-wife."

Evelyn's stomach lurched. Suddenly, she really didn't want to go.
###Chapter 578

Sterling Manor

Little Oliver's boredom vanished the moment he started playing with Leo.

Upstairs, Evelyn had just freshened up and was reviewing stock market trends in the study.

The door creaked open. Without looking up, Evelyn already knew who it was.

Lucas stood there, holding a velvet box in his hands.

"Evie, got a minute?"

He grinned and placed the box in front of her.

"Can you give this to her for me?"

"To who?"

Evelyn raised a brow and flipped the box open.

Inside lay the teardrop-shaped jade pendant—repaired, as if it had never shattered.

At first glance, it looked flawless. Only upon closer inspection could one spot the faintest hairline fracture.

Lucas had gone to great lengths to restore it.

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Lucas, you should give this to Natalie yourself. She’ll be thrilled."

He sighed. "She probably doesn’t want to see me."

Evelyn pushed the box back toward him. "No, she will. And she’ll be even happier if it comes from you."

This was the perfect chance for them to reconcile. She wasn’t about to steal that moment from them.

Lucas hesitated. Evelyn thought for a second, then said, "The Whitmores are hosting a banquet tomorrow. Natalie will be there. Come with me."

That way, she wouldn’t have to deal with that insufferable Nathan Blackwood alone.

They reached an agreement and headed to their respective rooms.

The next afternoon, Evelyn stepped out of a meeting when Bennett asked if she needed an evening gown for the reception.

She suddenly remembered Tristan Whitmore’s bizarre "remarriage" announcement.

"Remarriage? When did Tristan even get divorced?"

High-profile divorces involving corporate interests usually caused stock market tremors. Most couples avoided public splits at all costs.

Not everyone was reckless enough to pull what she and Nathan had done—burning bridges regardless of consequences.

Bennett pulled her from her thoughts. "Ms. Sterling, should I arrange an assistant to accompany you tonight?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No, Lucas is coming with me. Just pick something simple."

She had no intention of upstaging someone else’s wedding celebration.

Bennett nodded and left.

By late afternoon, Nathan’s sleek black limousine pulled up outside Sterling Enterprises, as if he wanted the entire city to know he’d come to fetch her.

He stood in the lobby, drawing every eye in the building. Soon, whispers about Nathan and Evelyn’s relationship spread like wildfire.

Theodore had told him publicity was good, so Nathan waited patiently, unfazed.

Employees leaving work cast him curious glances, bursting into gossip the second they passed him.

"Is Mr. Blackwood really getting back with Ms. Sterling?"

"Even if he wants to, it’s not that easy. Ms. Sterling’s single now, and half the city’s elite are lining up for her. Yesterday, there were at least three other guys waiting downstairs just like him—all got sent away."

Nathan’s mood darkened instantly.

"Three?!" His jaw clenched. "Seems I’ve been too lenient."

Just then, Evelyn descended the stairs in a fitted black knee-length dress, a string of pearls around her neck. A white trench coat draped over her shoulders, making her look effortlessly striking.

Bennett carried her purse, but instead of heading toward Nathan, they walked straight to a Maybach that had just pulled up.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed.

So this was the "someone else" she’d mentioned.

"She really didn’t take me seriously, did she?" His fists tightened. "How long has this been planned?"

With a cold expression, he adjusted his cuffs and strode forward.

Time to see who dared steal her right under his nose.
###Chapter 579

Bennett held the car door open for Evelyn. Little Oliver had been waiting inside, impatiently tapping his fingers against the leather seat.

He was about to escort her to the gala when a strong hand suddenly gripped Evelyn's wrist, yanking her backward.

She didn't need to turn to recognize that cold, possessive aura.

"Mr. Blackwood—?" Bennett stiffened, instinctively stepping forward, debating whether to intervene.

But Nathan had already pulled Evelyn flush against him, his arms locking around her like steel. His eyes were dark, dangerous.

His voice was low, laced with barely restrained fury.

"We agreed I would pick you up. Who the hell thinks they can take you from me?"

He wasn’t shouting. He didn’t need to. The threat in his tone was enough.

Evelyn didn’t struggle. She let him hold her, meeting his gaze with icy indifference.

That look made his chest tighten.

She was so close. If he dipped his head just slightly, he could finally taste what he’d been craving for months.

So he did.

Nathan leaned in, his lips a breath away from hers—

And she turned her face away.

Her eyes were sharp, unyielding.

Is she ashamed of me? Or is it because of the pretty boy in the Maybach?

A storm raged behind his gaze.

He caught her chin, forcing her to look at him—

Then a cold, mocking voice cut through the tension.

"Mr. Blackwood. You really think you can touch her?"

Nathan’s glare snapped toward the speaker—and froze.

Lucas stood there, hands in his pockets, lips curled in a smirk that didn’t reach his eyes. His expression was pure warning.

Nathan hesitated. Then he glanced down at Evelyn’s mocking smile and gritted his teeth, releasing her.

The air thickened with silence.

Bennett might as well have been invisible.

Evelyn straightened her dress and slid into the car without sparing Nathan another glance.

Lucas scoffed. "Pathetic. Let’s see if he dares pull that stunt again."

Nathan exhaled sharply. He hadn’t expected the "trust fund brat" to be Evelyn’s brother.

How the hell do I salvage this?

He clenched his fists. The Sterling brothers were notoriously overprotective.

Clearing his throat, he forced a neutral tone.

"Lucas. What a coincidence."

Lucas laughed, cold and humorless. "Coincidence? Since when are you this delusional?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. No one spoke to him like that.

But this was Evelyn’s brother.

He stepped closer, voice dropping to a whisper.

"That jade pendant. Did Natalie like it?"

Lucas stiffened.

The rare jade he’d hunted for months—the one meant to replace Natalie’s broken heirloom—was Nathan’s?
###Chapter 580

Lucas turned and slid into the car.

The Whitmores had spared no expense for this lavish banquet.

To secure the venue, Tristan had purchased the entire Grandeur Hotel for the night.

The opulent decorations made it seem like this was his first wedding—not a remarriage.

After exchanging pleasantries at the entrance, Evelyn entered on Lucas’s arm.

A wedding portrait of Tristan and his bride dominated the foyer.

The groom wore a crisp white tuxedo, his expression radiant with unconcealed joy.

The bride, Vivian Lockwood, was stunning—her delicate features framed by soft curls. But her smile in the photo seemed forced. Maybe the photographer had caught her at a bad moment.

Evelyn hadn’t heard much about her.

The Lockwoods weren’t particularly wealthy, but they had strong ties to the Sterling family.

Lucas studied the photo and sighed, shaking his head.

"Vivian married Tristan when her family was on the brink of bankruptcy. After the wedding, they went completely under."

Evelyn blinked, certain she’d misheard.

Marriages like this were usually meant to save a failing business. Why hadn’t it worked?

Lucas lowered his voice. "When Tristan wanted a divorce, he pulled every dirty trick in the book—all covered up by his father. Vivian found out eventually, and they split. Never thought they’d remarry."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. This sounded like a bad soap opera. That poor woman.

Tristan and Vivian stood at the entrance, greeting guests. He beamed; she offered only a faint smile, her hand lightly resting on his arm.

They looked picture-perfect.

Not a trace of resentment between them. As if they’d always been happy.

"Ms. Sterling, Mr. Sterling—what an honor."

Tristan extended a hand. Lucas shook it, his expression flawlessly neutral. "Congratulations. You make a striking couple."

Tristan’s grin widened.

Vivian, however, merely lifted her gaze to Lucas, her smile polite but silent.

Then she noticed Evelyn and nodded in greeting.

Evelyn returned the gesture.

She was here for business, not drama.

Behind her, Nathan approached, clapping Tristan on the shoulder. "Congratulations."

He meant it. This gave him hope for his own tangled situation.

When he and Evelyn remarried, he’d make it even grander. Media coverage. A global spectacle.

Evelyn and Lucas moved past without acknowledging him.

Tristan shot Nathan a smug look. "Tsk. You’re moving too slow, Blackwood."

Nathan’s glare could’ve frozen lava.

If this weren’t Tristan’s wedding day, he’d have punched him.

Vivian excused herself with a gentle smile. "I’ll tend to the guests."

Tristan squeezed her hand. "Rest if you need to. Don’t push yourself."

She nodded and walked away.

Tristan watched her go, his gaze lingering.

Left alone, the two men spoke more freely.

Nathan scowled. "Can’t you stare at her at home?"

Tristan chuckled. "If you can’t win Evelyn back, just marry someone else."
###Chapter 581

Nathan's expression darkened. "Why didn't you marry someone else?"

Tristan smirked. "Unlike your Ms. Holloway, my girl is easy to please. A few sweet words and some benefits, and she came running back. Even if you handed Evelyn the keys to Blackwood Industries, she wouldn’t spare you a second glance."

Nathan fell silent.

Because it was true.

Even if he offered her everything, she’d probably walk away without a word.

Tristan gestured to the banquet hall. "Look at this setup. Gorgeous, isn’t it? Vivian’s only request was to design our remarriage venue herself. Every inch of this place reflects her taste." He chuckled. "Women, right? You’ve got to know exactly what they want."

And what did Evelyn want? Nathan had no idea. His mood soured further.

Tristan clapped him on the shoulder. "Blackwood, my wife arranged some entertainment for later. I’ll find a way to slip you in—"

They were best friends, after all. Now that Tristan was happily remarried, he couldn’t just watch Nathan suffer.

Nathan didn’t respond. He strode inside without another word.

He’d had enough of Tristan’s gloating.

Meanwhile, Oliver Sinclair trailed behind Evelyn. No one stopped the well-dressed boy, so he wandered freely, helping himself to the dessert table.

Evelyn and Lucas chatted with guests while Oliver settled at a table, happily indulging in sweets.

The venue was a dreamy sea of white, clearly designed with meticulous care.

Lucas pulled Evelyn aside. "Natalie’s over there."

Evelyn sighed.

Natalie exchanged a few words with the woman beside her—the bride, Vivian Lockwood—before directing staff to adjust something nearby.

Spotting them, Natalie turned and approached with a smile.

"Evelyn, Lucas! You made it."

Evelyn nodded. "Did you design all this?"

Natalie shook her head modestly. "I just helped. The bride had the final say on everything."

Evelyn arched a brow. "It’s stunning."

But something about it felt… incomplete.

Lucas pulled a small box from his pocket and handed it to Natalie.

"I’ve been meaning to give this to you. Never found the right moment."

Natalie hesitated before accepting it. She opened it, then gave him a polite smile.

"Thanks. You could’ve just sent it over. No need for a special occasion."

Evelyn and Lucas exchanged shocked glances.

Natalie cared deeply about this item—yet she barely glanced at it before tucking it away.

Lucas’s face fell, but he said nothing.

Evelyn nudged Natalie’s arm. "Lucas stayed up for days fixing that. It’s not perfect, but it’s close. Take a proper look—are you happy with it?"

Natalie seemed surprised Lucas had repaired it himself.

Just as she reached to examine it, Vivian called her name. Without hesitation, Natalie pocketed the gift.

"His effort means a lot, so of course I’m satisfied. I’ve got to help now—we’ll talk later."

Evelyn nodded and let her go. She couldn’t interfere with Natalie’s responsibilities.

Turning to Lucas, she patted his shoulder.

"Lucas… I don’t think reconciliation is in the cards for you two."

Lucas shot her a look. "That’s ridiculous."

What was?

The idea of getting back together?

Or the idea that it was impossible?

Before Evelyn could ask, the massive screen displaying the couple’s wedding photos suddenly went dark.

The room fell silent.

Then the screen flickered back to life—

Gasps erupted.

A slideshow began—but not of wedding photos.

Instead, image after image of Tristan with different women filled the screen.

Intimate shots of him shopping with models.

Him having tea with actresses.

Him lounging on a beach with a trio of international celebrities.

The scandal had just begun.
###Chapter 582

The explosion of scandal detonated across the grand ballroom.

Silence swallowed the celebration.

Every clinking champagne glass froze mid-toast.

The elegant string quartet's melody now sounded grotesquely out of place.

Tristan Whitmore's face drained of color. His pupils contracted to pinpricks.

"Shut it down!" He charged through the crowd like a madman. "Who authorized this slideshow?"

Panic bled through his commanding tone.

No one answered.

The damning photographs kept cycling - each image stripping away the facade of his perfect life.

What should have been his triumphant second wedding became a public execution of his reputation.

Blessings turned to muffled laughter behind gloved hands.

Tristan lunged toward the control booth, desperate to stop the carnage. Only one thought consumed him.

Vivian mustn't see this. She couldn't witness his humiliation.

Then the crowd gasped.

A procession of women in designer wedding gowns emerged on the red carpet.

Each bride mirrored the women in the scandalous photos.

Their runway strut transformed the venue into a grotesque fashion show.

Tristan's knees buckled. Cold dread seeped into his bones.

The sword of Damocles had fallen.

All eyes turned to the groom - his earlier arrogance replaced by visible terror.

He seized the nearest woman. "Who sent you?" Spittle flew from his trembling lips. "Answer me!"

The woman remained silent.

"Get out!" Tristan roared, shoving her away. "All of you!"

But the bridal procession continued circling like vultures.

His manic gaze landed on another woman. "Tell me!" He shook her violently. "Who orchestrated this?"

Then came the voice that froze his blood.

"I did."

Vivian Lockwood stood framed in the doorway.

Gone was her wedding gown. She wore the same navy dress from twenty years ago - the one he'd mocked when she first arrived at the Whitmore estate.

Recognition flashed in Tristan's eyes.

Memories flooded back - how he'd forced this marriage, tormented her, bankrupted her family.

He'd been the worst kind of husband.

And now she'd become the most dangerous kind of ex-wife.
###Chapter 583

A single month was all it took for Tristan Whitmore to realize how unbearable life had become without Vivian Lockwood.

Watching his ex-wife, once pampered as the jewel of the Whitmore family, now working for others with forced smiles made his stomach churn.

Tristan swallowed his pride and begged for reconciliation. Vivian agreed before he even finished his third plea.

"See? She still loves me." Tristan vowed to treat her better this time.

But then—

Vivian's gaze turned glacial, colder than the Arctic winds.

Tristan stood frozen, mouth agape but voice trapped in his throat.

She advanced with measured steps, stopping precisely six feet away.

Her sweet face bore a detached smile. "Mr. Whitmore, aren't these all your former flames? Why didn't you invite them to our wedding?"

A bitter taste flooded Tristan's mouth. He approached with desperate eyes. "I was wrong, darling. Terribly wrong. I'll change—only you from now on!"

He'd promise anything, swear any oath, if only she'd stop looking at him like he was beneath contempt.

Panic clawed at his chest.

The crowd buzzed with shocked whispers. Who could've imagined the notorious playboy Whitmore heir brought to his knees like this?

Yet Vivian remained unmoved, her heart forged from steel. With regal poise, she addressed the bridal-gown-clad women. "Thank you, ladies. My staff will ensure your safe return home."

The procession of scorned lovers finally dispersed, leaving the banquet hall in tomb-like silence.

Vivian strode past Tristan without a glance.

She addressed their guests with practiced grace. "Consider this evening's entertainment my parting gift. Mr. Whitmore and I will not be reconciling."

Tristan's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened, but he dared not interrupt.

"Our marriage was fractured from the start. I've come to accept I was never suited to be Mrs. Whitmore—nor do I wish to be."

Each word carved deeper into Tristan's chest than any blade could.

This was the freedom he'd once craved. The freedom he'd earned through countless betrayals.

He'd gotten exactly what he deserved.

When Vivian turned to leave, Tristan seized her wrist. "Where are you going? This is our wedding!"

Below the stage, Evelyn Sinclair's mocking laughter rang out conspicuously.

Beside her, Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened to match the storm clouds outside.

He'd brought Evelyn here to witness reconciliation, not this spectacular humiliation.

"Pathetic," Nathan thought, watching his friend's downfall. "He brought this upon himself."
###Chapter 584

The entire room held its breath.

Vivian Lockwood shook off Tristan Whitmore's grip, her voice icy. "Since we're all here, I might as well make an announcement."

Every eye in the room fixed on her.

"I'm founding a law firm," she declared. "Specializing in divorce cases where mistresses are involved. My goal? To ensure justice for the women who've been betrayed, humiliated, and discarded like trash."

Her gaze swept the crowd.

"I was one of them. Trampled on, ignored, treated like I was nothing. But no more. If any of you need help, come find me."

Silence.

Even the music cut out.

Tristan's face drained of color. He stared at her like she was a stranger.

Then—

A single clap shattered the stillness.

Heads turned.

Evelyn Sinclair stood there, applauding without a care for the shocked whispers around her.

Natalie Beaumont joined next.

Then another.

And another.

Soon, the room erupted in thunderous applause.

None of these women had dared to expose the ugliest parts of their marriages before.

Divorce meant financial ruin for most of them.

That was why so many stayed silent, enduring their husbands' infidelities.

Not everyone had Evelyn's privilege.

Nathan Blackwood pinched the bridge of his nose, his expression darkening.

He moved to Evelyn's side.

"Stay out of this," he muttered. "It's already a disaster."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile.

The look in her eyes made his chest tighten.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said, "the disaster was created by Mr. Whitmore, wasn't it?"

Before he could respond, she scoffed.

"I wish I'd thought of something this satisfying when I was in her position."

Nathan's face paled.

A sharp pain lanced through his chest.

Had he forgotten?

What was the difference between how he'd treated Evelyn and how Tristan had treated Vivian?

At least Vivian still had the Whitmore family's support.

But the Blackwoods?

They'd despised Evelyn from the start.

The realization hit him like a punch to the gut.

His fingers tightened around her wrist.

Evelyn struggled briefly before giving up.

"Evelyn," he said, voice rough, "I've changed. Believe me."

On stage, Vivian smirked.

"Men don't change," she called out. "You can't train a dog not to eat shit."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Nathan's jaw clenched.

"I love you," he said fiercely. "More than my own life."

Vivian rolled her eyes.

"And love from a man like you?" she countered. "Cheaper than dirt. Worthless."

Evelyn's laughter rang out again.

Nathan exhaled sharply, glaring at the stage.

He regretted coming tonight.

If Tristan and his mess ruined things with Evelyn, he'd make sure they paid for it.

Leaning in, he inhaled the familiar scent of her perfume.

His voice dropped to a whisper.

"Don't listen to her," he pleaded. "I'm serious about us. If you need proof, I'll get on my knees right now."
###Chapter 585

Nathan's voice cracked with desperation, his eyes brimming with helplessness. He couldn't think of a single way to salvage this disaster.

The sight of this cursed remarriage had enraged him, trapping him in a position he didn't deserve.

But more than anger, Nathan felt something deeper—something that made his pride crumble.

He had never knelt before anyone since adulthood. Yet if bending his knee could prove his sincerity, he would do it without hesitation.

Under the harsh lights, Evelyn's gaze remained sharp, fixed on the stage. Not a flicker of emotion crossed her face at Nathan's words.

Her lips curled slightly, a hint of disdain playing at the corners.

"Don't," she said coldly. "It'll just shorten my life."

Did he really think one act of humiliation could erase everything?

Dream on.

Vivian's words only fueled the fire, steering the disastrous remarriage further into chaos.

Tristan stood to the side, the picture of a man who deserved public scorn. Yet the sorrow in his eyes was so raw, so intense, it made people hesitate.

Was this genuine regret, or just another act?

Tristan had believed he could start fresh, build a new life. Instead, he'd walked straight into a dead end.

The timid country girl he'd once dismissed—the one who never dared speak up—had orchestrated this public downfall with precision.

Good. Very good.

In that moment, Tristan realized he knew nothing about Vivian. Not even that she was a lawyer.

The Whitmore family swiftly ushered guests out of the banquet hall. No one wanted to linger and witness the spectacle.

Then, out of nowhere, a little boy bounded onto the stage. Innocent. Adorable. Utterly oblivious.

He tugged at Vivian's hand, his voice sweet and earnest.

"Miss, don't be sad! You're so pretty—you'll find someone way better! I can introduce you to my daddy!"

The crowd paused, intrigued.

Vivian blinked, startled. Where had this child come from?

Tristan's expression darkened further.

Insult to injury.

Little Oliver saw this as the perfect opportunity. If he could get the Pretty Lady with Daddy, he'd have her all to himself!

Perfect plan.

"My mommy's gone," he announced cheerfully, "but Daddy's rich! He'll take care of you. You can be my new mommy!"

Vivian frowned but couldn't resist ruffling his soft curls.

Oliver took that as agreement. His grin widened.

"When I grow up, I'll never hurt my wife like Uncle Tristan or Uncle Nathan. Daddy says men who hurt girls are the worst!"

The crowd stifled laughter. The tension eased—briefly.

Then realization struck.

Uncle Nathan?

He'd just dragged Nathan Blackwood into this.

A public slap in the face.

All eyes flicked to Nathan.

Shadows clung to him, his expression icy as he fought to keep his composure.

Don't lose it. He's just a child.

But the air around him crackled with barely restrained fury.

The Whitmores hurried the remaining guests out.

Evelyn stepped forward, holding out her arms. "Come here."

Oliver happily leaped into them. "Pretty Lady, did I do good?"
###Chapter 586

Evelyn ran her fingers through the boy's golden curls, her lips curving into a smile. "That's right. You're amazing, Oliver!"

Vivian Lockwood approached them, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "Ms. Sinclair, you know this child?"

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "Yes, he's the son of a dear friend. Children speak without filters—please don't take offense, Ms. Lockwood."

"Of course not."

Tristan Whitmore stepped forward, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled. Desperation clung to him like a second skin.

"Darling—"

"Mr. Whitmore," Vivian cut in sharply, "you will address me as Ms. Lockwood from now on. I believe I've made myself perfectly clear."

Tristan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. He scrambled for words. "I'll give you anything. If you're angry about your father's company, I'll rebuild it—"

Vivian's patience snapped. She didn't bother masking her disdain. "Young Master Whitmore, I used the money you spent chasing me to pay off your ex-girlfriends. They came surprisingly cheap."

A cold laugh escaped her—though whether she was mocking him or herself, no one could tell. Then, with practiced politeness, she turned to Evelyn. "My apologies for this spectacle, Ms. Sinclair. Goodbye."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Goodbye."

This version of Vivian was nothing like she'd imagined. Evelyn found herself unexpectedly impressed.

Tristan lunged forward, but the Whitmore family guards intercepted him.

"Enough!" his father barked. "You've humiliated us enough for one night. Must you dig the grave deeper?"

Tristan fought like a man possessed, his eyes wild.

Nathan Blackwood observed the scene with icy detachment. "Pathetic."

What infuriated him more was his own undeserved collateral damage. Tristan's mistakes had somehow splashed onto him, earning him equal scorn.

But with Evelyn present, Nathan couldn't make a scene.

"Let's go. I'll take you home."

He seized her wrist, pulling her toward the exit without room for protest. Evelyn glanced back, searching for her ever-reliable brother, Lucas.

Instead, she found him cornering Natalie Beaumont, whispering words too low to hear.

Evelyn cursed under her breath. "Men are utterly useless."

Little Oliver scrambled after them on short legs, terrified of being left behind.

Nathan fantasized about tossing the boy out the window—but alas, laws existed.

He watched, seething, as the child clung to Evelyn like a limpet. Those big blue eyes gleamed with mischief, far too clever for a child his age.

Nathan wondered if repressed rage could cause organ damage.

Fortunately, the driver swiftly scooped Oliver into the front seat, creating a private partition between them.

Nathan shot the man an approving look. This driver deserved a raise.

Evelyn sat stiffly, texting Bennett.

Nathan studied her profile, tension coiling in his gut. That familiar dread—the fear of her next words slicing him open—tightened his chest.

"Have dinner with me."

He needed to warn her about Vivian.

Evelyn didn't look up. "Can't. My father's expecting me."

Nathan exhaled sharply, forcing down the night's frustrations. "Fine. Next time, sweetheart."

Evelyn froze. Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "Are you ill again?"

Nathan met her gaze. "Terminally lovesick."

"Go to hell."

Nathan grinned, the tension in his shoulders easing. Being insulted by her was perversely comforting.

Truly, he was beyond redemption.
###Chapter 587

At the gates of Sterling Manor.

By sheer coincidence, William had just returned from his afternoon fishing trip.

The two former lovers crossed paths unexpectedly.

Nathan felt his pulse quicken. His social standing had risen significantly since their last encounter.

Evelyn remained perfectly composed. She stepped out of the car with little Oliver, immediately handing him off to the butler.

She wanted Nathan to leave immediately, but he stubbornly exited the vehicle.

His tailored suit accentuated his aristocratic bearing, the crisp lines enhancing his naturally aloof demeanor.

Evelyn cursed him silently as he strode confidently toward William's car.

He wouldn't miss this chance. Even risking her anger was worth meeting her family properly.

William remained seated, merely rolling down his window with a measured gaze.

"Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan bowed respectfully, as if greeting a respected elder.

"Chairman Sterling, good evening."

William chuckled, glancing at his clearly irritated daughter.

"Lucas took Evelyn out, but you went through the trouble of bringing her home. Much obliged."

"Think nothing of it."

William continued politely, "Would you care to come in for tea?"

He couldn't outright dismiss a guest.

Nathan seized the opportunity. "I'd be delighted. Thank you, Chairman Sterling."

Both William and Evelyn were rendered speechless.

Upon entering, Leo immediately analyzed the situation and came bounding over.

"Papa! I missed you!"

The robotic tiger cub clung to Nathan's polished shoes, attempting to climb up with its tiny paws.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Ungrateful machine. After everything I've done for you!"

Nathan smiled warmly, scooping Leo up with one hand.

"Papa missed you too."

William nearly stumbled mid-step. Evelyn could only stare in disbelief.

The man had absolutely no shame.

They settled in the parlor where the butler served coffee and two glasses of warm milk.

The milk was for Evelyn and William.

William offered an apologetic smile. "Forgive our limited hospitality, Mr. Blackwood. At my age, caffeine disrupts my sleep. Evelyn maintains strict beauty routines."

Nathan stared at the steaming black coffee, forcing a polite smile.

"I actually prefer coffee in the evenings."

"How fortunate," Evelyn interjected, arching an eyebrow. "Since you enjoy it so much, do try our special blend."

Nathan's dark gaze locked onto hers.

"With pleasure."

If she insisted, he wouldn't refuse.

He lifted the cup, drinking the entire contents in several deliberate swallows.

Even William noticed something amiss.

Clearing his throat, he asked, "How's your family?"

"They're well, thank you."

"I heard about your... arrangement with that Ashford girl. Such a tragedy, her turning out to be a murderer. Your family must be devastated."

William mentioned the incident casually.

Nathan's smile remained polite. "Merely rumors, Chairman Sterling. We never intended marriage with that family. Her downfall brings us no sorrow."

"She lived in your home, yet you claim no marital intentions?" Evelyn lounged carelessly on the sofa. Without Nathan present, she'd have curled up comfortably.

Nathan looked directly at her, as if this explanation mattered most.

"Never. There's only one woman I wish to marry."

"You."

Evelyn yawned dramatically, signaling the conversation's end.

"Archibald, please see our guest out."
###Chapter 588

Nathan's gaze turned icy for a brief moment before he stood up to bid farewell to the Sterlings.

William had clearly witnessed the tension between them.

He knew Nathan hadn't given up on Evelyn—if anything, the man was bordering on obsessive. But that was fine.

Let him taste the same torment he'd once inflicted on Evelyn.

William exchanged polite pleasantries before signaling the butler to escort Nathan out.

Just as Nathan was about to leave, Leo, curled up on the sofa, suddenly leaped into his arms, refusing to let him go.

"Papa, I'll miss you. I love you forever."

Evelyn froze, staring at the traitorous AI tiger.

Jealousy clouded her judgment.

"If you love him that much, why don't you just move in with him?"

Leo's AI brain couldn't decipher whether she was serious or joking.

Hadn't Evelyn always been its favorite?

With a reluctant flick of its tail, Leo padded over and pawed at her shoes.

"Mama, I love you more..."

Nathan scoffed. "Forget it. Just a two-faced tiger."

The butler ushered Nathan out. Evelyn stretched lazily, ready to retreat upstairs for some rest.

William stopped her, fingers tapping lightly against the armrest. "What exactly is going on between you and Nathan?"

Anyone could tell something was off.

They didn’t act like a couple, but neither did they behave like bitter exes.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her expression briefly unreadable.

"It's nothing serious."

But William knew better.

Evelyn was ruthlessly logical when it came to important matters—especially regarding Nathan after everything that had happened.

If she said it was nothing, then she was definitely playing with fire.

A tired smile tugged at William’s lips.

"Fine, play if you must. Our family can afford the fallout. Just be careful not to get burned."

It was a warning, but a gentle one.

Evelyn arched a brow. "I won’t."

"Honestly, Preston Sinclair isn’t a bad option. At least he’s better than Nathan. He’s letting his son stay with us, and the boy is adorable. More importantly, you like him. If you choose Preston, I’ll support you."

William had given it some thought.

Compared to Nathan, Preston was the lesser of two evils.

His influence was overseas, meaning he wouldn’t be tangled in Nathan’s mess. Worth considering.

Evelyn, halfway up the stairs, turned sharply at his words, frowning.

"Dad, marriage is a grave I just crawled out of. Why would I jump back in?"

William burst out laughing. "Fair point!"

The rain came in the middle of the night, pattering noisily against the windows.

Evelyn slept soundly, turning over in bed. In the corner, Leo switched from quiet mode to silent, settling down instantly.

She didn’t know if Lucas had returned—his car wasn’t there when she left for work early the next morning.

Bennett, however, was in an unusually chatty mood.

"President, I heard last night’s banquet was legendary. Mr. Whitmore’s remarriage will go down in history."

Not surprising that Bennett knew. With so many guests, gossip was inevitable.

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, it was legendary, alright."

Before she could reach her office, she spotted a woman at reception, deep in conversation with the secretary.

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

That woman was last night’s star.

The secretary didn’t recognize Vivian Lockwood, and without an appointment, she wasn’t allowed in.

"Ms. Lockwood?"
###Chapter 589

Vivian Lockwood turned to face Evelyn Sinclair.

Gone was yesterday's hesitant demeanor. Today, Vivian carried herself with sharp professionalism, every inch the formidable attorney. Yet that icy brilliance in her gaze remained unforgettable.

"Ms. Sterling, forgive the intrusion. Might you have a moment?"

Evelyn considered briefly. Though they moved in different circles, she couldn't deny the pang of recognition at Vivian's circumstances. Their paths bore striking similarities.

"Come in."

Bennett stepped forward to open the office door. Evelyn entered first, Vivian following.

"Would you care for refreshments?"

"Black coffee, thank you."

Evelyn settled into her chair, her eyes flickering instinctively toward the stock market display. The numbers told a brutal story.

Most glaringly, the Whitmore family stocks were in freefall. Hundreds of millions evaporated within minutes of market opening.

Vivian's tailored suit spoke of competence, perfectly befitting her legal background.

"Ms. Lockwood, what brings you here today?"

Vivian hesitated, then offered a tight smile.

"I've come to ask for your assistance, Ms. Sterling."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Continue."

"You're aware of last night's... events. While my firm remains operational, potential clients avoid me out of deference to the Whitmores. At this rate, I'll be forced to close within weeks."

Her laugh held no humor. "We share similar marital histories. But unlike you, I lack resources. My family was ruined by Tristan Whitmore. Last night was my final act of defiance."

Evelyn's pulse quickened, though her expression remained composed.

"The Whitmores have already lost nearly a billion today. Don't underestimate your impact."

Vivian leaned forward. "I'm here to shamelessly request your investment. With your backing, the Whitmores' influence becomes irrelevant."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn understood immediately. While the wedding scandal made waves, high society's memory was notoriously short. Without independent success, Vivian would fade into obscurity while the Whitmores weathered yet another storm.

The request was simple. For Evelyn, barely an inconvenience.

"Consider it done."

Vivian blinked. "Just like that?"

Evelyn's smile held genuine warmth. "You did what I never dared. Of course I'll support you."

Relief washed over Vivian's features. "Thank you."

Evelyn tapped her pen thoughtfully. "But if we're doing this, we do it properly. High-profile launch requires high-profile maintenance."

She outlined strategies with practiced ease - courting society figures, celebrity endorsements, strategic networking. Vivian listened, admiration growing.

Evelyn's pen stilled mid-air as inspiration struck. Her eyes gleamed.

"What about a reality series? Successful divorced women rebuilding their lives. It would resonate powerfully. Your thoughts?"

The idea hung between them, electric with potential.
###Chapter 590

Vivian Lockwood's eyes sparkled with excitement. She nodded eagerly, then hesitated. "But won't the investment be too high?"

Evelyn Sinclair waved a dismissive hand. "Leave that to the professionals. Your only job is to participate."

Vivian gave a solemn nod.

The proposal was met with unanimous approval.

Evelyn immediately instructed Dominic Kingsley to assemble a team.

Vivian left shortly after, setting Evelyn's profit share at fifty percent.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes and swiftly adjusted it to ten before sending it back.

She wasn’t investing her own energy into this—she wouldn’t take advantage of Vivian. Besides, Vivian still had a firm to run.

Dominic had no doubts about the show’s novelty. The public had seen plenty of romance-driven reality shows, but one focused on self-reinvention after divorce? That would carve out an entirely new niche.

After all, Evelyn had thrown herself into her career post-divorce—something people were fascinated by. Unfortunately, she wasn’t an actress, so she wouldn’t perform for the cameras.

But this show? It would draw attention. No question.

Dominic called an urgent meeting, and the concept was greenlit instantly.

The cast wasn’t just Vivian—several high-profile divorced actresses were also approached. Their names alone would guarantee strong ratings.

Dominic was adamant about getting Evelyn to participate. Her identity alone was a magnet for viewers.

Evelyn didn’t agree outright but promised to appear in the premiere for promotional purposes.

When funding was sought, Evelyn deliberately bypassed Sterling Enterprises and turned to the public—and Blackwood Industries.

Harrison Blackwood placed the investment proposal on Nathan Blackwood’s desk.

Nathan arched a brow. "What kind of show is this?"

"From what I’ve heard, it’s a reality series for divorcees—specifically to promote Tristan Whitmore’s ex-wife, Vivian Lockwood."

Nathan scoffed. "Tristan’s behind this?"

Harrison studied Nathan’s expression carefully. "No. It’s Ms. Sinclair’s project."

Nathan’s face darkened. "Vivian is a terrible influence. She’s leading Evelyn down the wrong path."

His decision was instant, his voice icy. "Evelyn’s participating?"

Silence filled the office.

After a long pause, Nathan gritted his teeth. "No matter the cost, Blackwood Industries will be the sole sponsor of this show."

It was her project. He wouldn’t let anyone else take credit for supporting her.

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, the market for this kind of content is untested. The guests aren’t A-list, and the focus is on their divorces—"

"Enough. My decision is final. Make it happen."

Within days, the show’s script landed on Nathan’s desk.

The title glared up at him:

"Love Reimagined."

Nathan stared at the words, jaw tight. His fingers traced the letters, his expression unreadable.

Was this show about moving on after divorce?

His grip tightened. "Is it too late to pull the funding?"
###Chapter 591

Nathan Blackwood felt like he'd stepped into his own trap. There was no backing out now.

If only he'd refused from the beginning.

Dominic Kingsley remained silent, watching him with an unreadable expression.

Regret burned through Nathan like acid.

He snatched up a cigarette, lighting it with sharp movements. Smoke curled around him as he tapped the ash onto the table. "Forget it."

"Consider it a loss."

Harrison hesitated, unsure how to respond.

"Sir, Dominic Kingsley at Horizon Media is confident in the show's success. Ratings are projected to be high. This won't be a waste—it might even turn a profit."

Nathan's gaze darkened.

"Would you want this money?"

He wanted the show to fail spectacularly.

Harrison stiffened, wisely choosing not to push further.

Bennett would’ve been useful right now. But he wasn’t here.

Then came the update.

The show needed a male guest host.

Nathan made his decision instantly—he would go himself.

These women needed their perspectives corrected. People deserved second chances. Redemption was possible. They were still young, after all.

He ordered Harrison to inform the production team—he’d appear as a mystery guest. Evelyn Sinclair was in for a surprise.

When Evelyn received the news, she also suggested a male guest, leaving Dominic to handle negotiations.

Dominic stared at the two names, stress aging him by the minute. He rubbed his temples before turning to Lucas Sterling, lounging carelessly on the sofa.

"Lucas, this is your company. Who should we pick?"

Lucas smirked. "Whoever's more popular."

Dominic exhaled sharply.

Two weeks later, everything was set.

Evelyn handed Sterling Enterprises' affairs to Alexander and left for filming with a clear mind.

On set, three divorced celebrities stood beside Vivian Lockwood—whom she already knew.

Cassandra Blake. Seraphina Devereux. Giselle Fontaine.

Cassandra was sharp-tongued, Seraphina breathtakingly beautiful, and Giselle hovered nervously behind them.

All three were A-listers.

Their marriages had made headlines, yet none lasted beyond two years before ending in divorce.

Ironically, their careers had only soared since.

Vivian, gentle and reserved, sat quietly in the corner while the others chatted animatedly.

When Evelyn entered, the three actresses sprang up, embracing her like old friends.

The atmosphere turned instantly warm.

Of course it did. No one in the industry dared cross Evelyn Sinclair.

Her starting point was their finish line. One word from her could end careers built over decades.

They offered her the center seat, but Evelyn sat beside Vivian instead.

Confusion flickered across their faces.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Mr. Kingsley, why don’t you introduce everyone?"

Only Evelyn could command Dominic like this without consequence.

Dominic stepped forward.

"First, our producer—Ms. Lockwood. She specializes in divorce law and will provide legal guidance throughout the show."

The three women paled. The woman they'd ignored was the producer?

Vivian nodded politely.

Dominic breezed through Evelyn’s introduction—labeling her the "special guest"—before presenting the actresses.

"And our mystery male team captain?"

Dominic’s lips curved into a knowing smirk.
###Chapter 592

Two grand entrances framed the studio - north and south. Whether intentional or not, the production team had set the stage perfectly.

Nathan Blackwood's command sliced through the air. At his signal, both doors swung open simultaneously.

The audience gasped.

From the southern entrance emerged Xavier Delmont. His crisp white shirt caught the light as he offered a practiced, charming smile.

But all eyes quickly shifted north.

A collective inhale echoed through the studio.

Nathan Blackwood himself stood framed in the doorway.

The notorious billionaire playboy. The man who never attended public events. Here. Now.

The three female celebrities froze. Their manicured hands flew to check their hair, their makeup. Every calculated move forgotten in his magnetic presence.

Nathan's gaze burned across the room, searching for one person only.

Evelyn Sinclair.

His ex-wife.

His obsession.

Then he saw Xavier standing opposite him. The carbon copy. The replacement.

Nathan's knuckles whitened. Every muscle in his body tensed.

"Who invited this imitation?" The thought seared through his mind.

Xavier's smile faltered. He glanced nervously at Nathan before quickly moving to Evelyn's side.

This was supposed to be his big break. The struggling actor finally getting recognition beyond being "Nathan Blackwood's lookalike."

Now the original stood mere feet away, radiating danger.

Nathan remained rooted at the entrance. Backlit by studio lights, his chiseled features looked carved from ice. The air around him crackled with barely contained fury.

Silence descended.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Nathan's unexpected appearance. Her gaze flicked to Dominic Kingsley, the show's producer.

Nathan's glare followed hers.

Dominic swallowed hard under the dual scrutiny. He'd thought having both men would create explosive ratings. Now he feared literal explosions.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Dominic forced cheer into his voice. "What an honor to have you join us today!"

Nathan's lips curled. "Is that so?"

Dominic rushed to explain. "Xavier is here as an assistant to our female guests. And to... support you, of course."

The unspoken hierarchy was clear: Nathan as the star, Xavier as the help.

Nathan's expression didn't soften. Dominic's smile grew strained. He shot Evelyn a pleading look.

This was going to be the longest shoot of his career.
###Chapter 593

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She instantly knew Nathan had pulled some strings behind the scenes.

She was the one who had recommended Xavier, and Dominic should have handled this properly.

Evelyn took a deep breath. With so many people around, she couldn’t make a scene. Besides, the whole point of this was to support Vivian. She’d have to settle this later.

She held out her hand wordlessly and started clapping.

Then, everyone else joined in, their applause growing louder, their expressions knowing.

The ovation was meant for Mr. Blackwood alone.

Nathan’s gaze softened slightly as he watched Evelyn lead the applause. The icy aura around him faded just a fraction.

Dominic exhaled in relief.

First hurdle cleared.

Nathan strode to Evelyn’s side, and the crowd instinctively parted for him.

He stood at the center of the group, effortlessly commanding attention.

Oddly, it didn’t feel out of place at all.

Evelyn stood there, her smile polite but distant. Behind her, Xavier had the sense to retreat to the far corner.

He wasn’t foolish enough to provoke Nathan again.

That beating had been lesson enough for a lifetime.

After the introductions, everyone headed outside for some icebreaker games.

Evelyn walked leisurely at the back, Vivian keeping pace beside her.

The other three actresses clustered around Nathan, vying for his attention.

Seraphina cooed, "Mr. Blackwood, this is my first time meeting you in person. You’re even more striking than in magazines!"

Cassandra chimed in, "Absolutely! Mr. Blackwood, what brought you here? The director didn’t warn us—what a delightful surprise!"

Giselle added, "With you here, our ratings are guaranteed to skyrocket!"

Vivian stifled a laugh and nudged Evelyn. "He’s here for you, isn’t he?"

Evelyn glanced at Nathan’s broad shoulders and narrow waist from behind. Even standing still, his presence was magnetic.

"Probably just here for the paycheck," she muttered carelessly.

The man in front of her stiffened slightly.

He stopped abruptly, turned, and fixed her with a wounded look. "I came for you."

Evelyn shot a pointed glance at the nearby cameraman. "Cut that part."

"Yes, ma’am!"

Nathan’s expression darkened. He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"You’ve been ignoring me."

Evelyn arched a brow.

Nathan pressed on, "No replies to my texts. No answers to my calls."

Silence.

"Did you forget who I am to you?"

Evelyn couldn’t take it anymore. She glared.

"Shut up."

Nathan froze. The usually untouchable CEO actually obeyed.

The cameraman gaped. What did I just film? No—scratch that, I didn’t film anything.

Vivian’s eyes widened before a flicker of disdain crossed her face. She had no respect for him.

The three actresses up ahead found their attempts at flattery falling flat.

The first game was on the lake.

Giselle, terrified of water, stayed onshore.

The others would split into teams of three, racing to the opposite shore—no paddles, just hands.

Simple. Brutal.

Dominic announced the groupings, anticipation thick in the air.

Had he rigged this too?

"First team—Evelyn, Nathan, and… Xavier."
###Chapter 594

Nathan Blackwood had been in a decent mood—until Xavier Delmont's name was mentioned.

That imposter was everywhere. Someone needed to put him in his place.

Unfortunately, a powerful CEO like Nathan couldn’t afford to be seen acting petty.

Evelyn Sinclair had recommended Xavier because, aside from his occasional scheming, he hadn’t caused any real trouble. She was willing to give him a chance.

But then Nathan showed up and stole the spotlight.

No matter how well Xavier performed, Nathan would always be the center of attention.

They were given two small wooden boats. Seraphina Devereux, Cassandra Blake, and Vivian Lockwood boarded theirs, already excitedly discussing their strategy.

Nathan stepped onto his boat and turned, offering his hand to Evelyn. She glanced at it but ignored the gesture, hopping in on her own.

Xavier, the last one left, hesitated before quickly lowering his head and scrambling aboard, sitting as far from Evelyn as possible.

Nathan’s lips thinned, his expression darkening.

Just looking at that fake made his chest tighten with irritation.

He sat between them, deliberately taking up space.

Evelyn shot him a look but said nothing.

Onshore, Dominic Kingsley called out, "Alright, everyone! On your marks—Go!"

The other boat immediately started rowing away, laughter ringing out.

But on this one?

Nathan didn’t move.

Evelyn didn’t move.

Both were CEOs—leaving Xavier as the only one actually trying.

He gripped the paddle, rowing twice, but the boat barely budged.

Dominic watched through binoculars, wincing.

The director muttered, "I get the drama angle, but this is just painful to watch."

Dominic smirked. "You don’t understand."

The director waited for an explanation, but none came.

On the boat, Nathan inhaled Evelyn’s subtle floral scent, his mood lifting slightly. The scenery around them was breathtaking—the lake shimmering under the sun, distant mountains framing the view.

A thought struck him, and he asked softly, "Have you thought about where you’d want to go for your honeymoon?"

Xavier rowed harder, pretending not to hear.

The cameraman in the corner cringed.

This was supposed to be a divorce show. Were they veering into reconciliation territory?

Evelyn’s brows twitched, her expression turning icy.

"Anywhere you’re not."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. She didn’t want him around?

His jaw clenched, and he shot Xavier a glare.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and reached for the paddle. "Let me help, Xavier."

"Okay!" Xavier said eagerly.

Nathan’s expression turned stormy.

He snatched the paddle from Evelyn’s hands, his voice tight. "I’ll do it."

No way was he letting her do manual labor.

He sat opposite them and raised the oar.

"You know how?" Evelyn challenged.

Nathan smirked. "I pilot yachts. You think I can’t handle a paddle?"

Then he plunged the oar into the water—only for something to block it.

Nathan frowned and pushed harder.

Suddenly, Xavier screamed—and the next second, he was in the water.

Evelyn gasped.

Xavier flailed. "Help—!"

Panic flickered in Evelyn’s eyes. What if he actually drowned?

She turned to Nathan, silently urging him to act.

Nathan’s expression was pure disgust. This fake wasn’t just annoying—he was a damn good actor.

He watched Xavier thrash, unmoved. Then, finally, he sneered.

"If you don’t want to die, stand up."
###Chapter 595

Who Was Xavier Pretending to Be Pitiful For?

At those words, Xavier froze instantly, his fake smile vanishing.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he slowly stood up.

The water barely reached his waist.

How humiliating.

Silence.

The laughter and screams from the lake died in an instant.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, sitting quietly on the boat. She exhaled in relief but shot Xavier a complicated look.

She glanced at him a few times, as if studying an idiot. Then, she chuckled, easing the tension.

"The water’s shallow. Maybe you should go change?"

Xavier knew he was in the wrong.

But he had been terrified.

He hadn’t realized the water was this shallow. The embarrassment burned.

Especially in front of Evelyn Sinclair.

"N-No."

Nathan scoffed.

"If you’re not changing, then push the boat for us. Our team lost because of your little stunt."

A team with two men had lost to one without any.

Who was the disgrace here?

Evelyn frowned, about to intervene, when something clicked in her mind.

"Wait—did your boat hit Xavier’s earlier?"

Nathan’s expression stiffened, his sharp eyes twitching slightly.

Evelyn pressed, "You don’t actually know how to row, do you?"

Meaning, Nathan’s amateur maneuvering had caused Xavier to fall in.

Nathan’s lips thinned.

His cold gaze flicked to Xavier, who was dutifully pushing the boat through the water. Then he looked away.

He cleared his throat. "Of course I know how to row. I can even pilot a yacht."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. This stubborn man couldn’t row but still refused to admit it!

Meanwhile, Xavier struggled to push the boat. With three people—including the cameraman—it weighed nearly 400 pounds.

He pushed with all his might, resentment simmering.

He had no choice. If he didn’t work hard, he’d pay for it later.

Nathan’s methods were ruthless. Xavier knew that firsthand.

On the shore, the other three women celebrated their easy victory.

Vivian had been getting along with them effortlessly, blending right in.

As Nathan stepped onto land, someone handed him water. He took it—then turned to offer it to Evelyn.

But Evelyn was already reaching out to help Xavier up, her expression unreadable.

Nathan’s eyes frosted over.

"Are you okay? Go change before you catch a cold," she said softly.

Xavier forced a weak smile. "I’m fine. At least your clothes stayed dry."

Nathan approached, his presence icy. Xavier immediately retracted his hand.

His fear was painfully obvious.

Evelyn’s tone was flat. "Go. You can’t film like this."

Xavier nodded and turned to row the boat back.

Nathan’s voice cut through the air, cool and sharp. "You’re already wet. Walk back through the water. Leave the boat to the ladies."

Evelyn clicked her tongue. Was he trying to exhaust Xavier?

Xavier was already on the verge of collapse. Walking through the water now?

In front of Evelyn and the cameras, his eyes reddened. He needed to salvage this somehow.

He glanced at Nathan, ready to play the victim—

But one look at Nathan’s merciless gaze, and Xavier shuddered.

The memories of past beatings resurfaced.

He swallowed his act and retreated.
###Chapter 596

Xavier hesitated for just a second.

Then he turned with a dazzling smile.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood was considerate. I prefer walking back alone anyway. Consider it a personal challenge."

Without another word, he pivoted and stepped back into the water.

His figure cut through the waves with determination.

No hesitation. No backward glance.

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, but the reality was clear—there weren't enough boats. Calling for another would only waste precious time.

Every second counted.

She clenched her jaw and turned away.

Nathan caught up in three strides, grabbing her wrist. His fingers dug into the exact spot Xavier had touched, rubbing harshly until her skin burned red against her pale complexion.

Evelyn yanked her hand back, voice icy. "Have you lost your mind?"

Nathan's eyes darkened, veins prominent. His voice was a controlled growl. "Yes. So stop talking to him."

A cold laugh escaped her. "What you say means nothing to me."

The words hit like a physical blow. His expression shuttered.

Of course he meant nothing.

Evelyn was the one who brought Xavier onto the show.

Their connection existed because of her.

She tilted her chin up. "Yup."

Was he furious?

Humiliated?

Good. He could walk away anytime.

Nathan's eyelid twitched. He closed the distance between them in one step, fingers brushing the hair from her forehead. His whisper was arctic.

"Am I not enough? You need that cheap imitation too?"

Evelyn met his gaze head-on, neither backing down. Her smile was razor-sharp as she traced his jaw. "A woman can never have too many men. Permanent boyfriends are overrated."

Nathan's breath turned ragged. He gripped her waist, voice raw. "Evelyn—"

"Evelyn!" A gentle call interrupted. "Come drink something warm."

Vivian stood nearby with two actresses, holding steaming cups. She extended one toward Evelyn.

"Thanks." Evelyn accepted it gladly.

Vivian lowered her voice. "I saw tension with your team earlier. Did Mr. Blackwood cause trouble?"

Evelyn sipped her drink. "No."

Beside them, Seraphina couldn't resist glancing at Nathan. "Ms. Sinclair, is Mr. Blackwood pursuing you? Will you reconcile?"

Evelyn took another slow sip before answering. "No."

Her tone left no room for debate.

Nathan's expression flickered but smoothed instantly.

He'd make her eat those words.

Seraphina's face brightened visibly.

So did Cassandra's.

Vivian remained impassive. This drama wasn't hers to care about.

"Everyone knows he's trash," Vivian remarked casually. "Running back to an ex? Textbook scumbag behavior."

Nathan, who'd been approaching, froze mid-step. Rage simmered in his eyes as he glared—this woman, Tristan's ex-wife, was trouble.

Seraphina rushed to disagree. "Not necessarily! Maybe their lifestyles clashed initially. With adjustment, reconciliation could work."

Cassandra nodded eagerly. "Exactly! You can't label someone a scumbag just because they loved someone else first. That's not fair!"

Evelyn and Vivian exchanged glances.

Where did these marriage experts crawl out from?

If they were so wise, why were they divorced?

Still, Cassandra had a point.

Vivian shrugged. "So you're saying their breakup was Ms. Sinclair's fault?"
###Chapter 597

Seraphina's face paled instantly, her perfectly manicured nails digging into her palms.

"That's not what we meant at all!" Her voice trembled with panic. "We were merely discussing lifestyle differences. No offense intended toward Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn's lips curved into an amused smile, her emerald eyes sparkling with genuine warmth rather than anger. "Relax, I understand. Just casual conversation about CASING. No need to scare them, Vivian."

The tension in the room visibly dissipated as everyone realized Evelyn truly wasn't offended.

She was far more down-to-earth than her billionaire heiress status suggested.

Vivian shot Nathan a pointed look before clearing her throat. "Ms. Sinclair has a heart of gold. She'll undoubtedly find true love again. As will Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's icy glare could have frozen the Mediterranean. Since when did a pack of divorced socialites become qualified to give Evelyn life advice?

Cassandra suddenly whipped out her phone with dramatic flair. "Let's exchange contacts! We should create a WhatsApp group for our little circle."

Vivian immediately joined in the excitement, pulling up her QR code with enthusiasm.

Not to be left out, Vivian followed suit.

Evelyn casually scanned everyone's codes without hesitation.

Then Seraphina sauntered over to Nathan, hips swaying, her crimson lips parting in a sultry smile. "Mr. Blackwood, darling, what's your WhatsApp?"

The air crackled with anticipation.

No woman in Manhattan's elite circles had ever obtained this elusive billionaire's private contact. Yet here he stood, within touching distance.

Securing his digits would be the first conquest in her carefully planned seduction.

Nathan's glacial gaze swept over her before tilting his chin toward Evelyn.

He was determined to keep their lives irrevocably intertwined, even post-divorce.

Seraphina pouted dramatically. "Mr. Blackwood, you're divorced now. Surely Ms. Sinclair won't mind? You don't mind, do you, Evelyn?"

Evelyn lifted one perfectly arched brow, her smile razor-sharp. "Not in the slightest."

Nathan felt his jaw clench. This woman would be the death of him.

She was actually encouraging other women to pursue him!

How could she be so indifferent?

His teeth ground together audibly.

Seraphina's smile turned predatory as she batted her false lashes at him. "See? Ms. Sinclair approves. Now be a darling and give me your number. Strictly for business purposes, of course!"

Nathan's fingers absently traced his temple, his smile colder than Arctic winds. "Apologies. I don't use WhatsApp."

Seraphina's flirtatious grin froze into a rictus.

Even her considerable experience with wealthy men couldn't salvage this blatant rejection.

"Forget it," she forced a laugh, "Mr. Blackwood must protect his corporate secrets."

Pushing further would only humiliate herself.

Evelyn had already turned away, murmuring instructions to Joia while texting Dominic about their departure.

Vivian boarded the yacht first, with Cassandra trailing behind.

Nathan waited pointedly on the adjacent vessel while Seraphina whined, "We're missing someone!"

All eyes scanned the group. Xavier was nowhere to be seen.

Seraphina's plump lips formed an exaggerated pout. "This isn't fair! Three women can't possibly out-row a man. We're doomed to lose!"

The director scratched his head. "Should we... recall Xavier then?"

Seraphina began gesturing wildly. "I propose we balance the teams properly! Either put the heaviest woman with the man to offset the weight difference, or the two lightest women with him."

The implication was obvious to everyone.

The "heaviest woman" could only refer to Seraphina herself - all curves and calculated seduction.
###Chapter 598

The other three women were all slender figures.

Cassandra Blake frowned, her dissatisfaction barely concealed.

"The rules can't be altered just because you say so—"

"It's for fairness—"

Nathan Blackwood stood there, irritation simmering beneath his calm exterior. The incessant chatter from the women grated on his nerves.

When he heard they wanted to separate him from Evelyn, his gaze darkened as it landed on the curvy Seraphina Devereux.

His cousin beside him stiffened at the shift in his demeanor.

Just as he was about to intervene, he caught Evelyn turning away.

Evelyn said, "Then you and Mr. Blackwood can be on one team. I'll join the other."

Seraphina's face lit up. She hadn't expected Evelyn to agree so easily.

Clearly, reconciliation between these two was impossible.

Her opportunity had arrived.

Evelyn stepped into the other boat, and Nathan's stormy eyes followed her before flicking dismissively over Seraphina. She reached out, expecting his assistance, but his gaze barely grazed her before he turned away, his indifference palpable.

He didn’t care that the cameras were rolling.

If he were any other man, malicious editing could have destroyed his reputation. But this was Nathan Blackwood. Who would dare cross him?

Malicious editing?

Nonexistent.

Seraphina lifted her chin, undeterred.

All powerful men had tempers.

"Don't worry, Mr. Blackwood. I won't slow you down."

Nathan stood at the bow, his attention fixed on Evelyn as she reached the opposite shore, laughing freely.

The sight made his chest tighten.

Seraphina tried to regain his focus, nearly stumbling. "What's wrong with this paddle? Mr. Blackwood, could you take a look?"

He didn’t even glance back. His voice was ice.

"If you can't row, get out and push."

He wasn’t here to cater to anyone but Evelyn.

Seraphina choked on her words, realizing he wasn’t joking.

She blinked, wounded. Despite her age, she was still attractive.

"Mr. Blackwood, have I done something to upset you?"

Nathan’s eyes darkened, his tone low and dangerous, uncaring of the cameras.

"Drop the act. I’m only here for Evelyn. Cooperate, and you’ll get what you want. Cross me, and you’ll regret it."

The warning hung heavy in the air, his dominance undeniable.

If she didn’t back off now, he wouldn’t waste another second on her.

Seraphina froze, a tremor running through her.

Her face paled, her smile strained.

Her experience with wealthy men told her Nathan was beyond her reach.

This warning was a mercy.

The consequences of provoking him? Being blacklisted would be the least of her worries.

Some never resurfaced after crossing him.

The thought made her recoil.

Belonging to NovelDreams Publishing.

"Understood, Mr. Blackwood," she said hastily. "I’ll help you win Ms. Sinclair back. It won’t happen again."

Her plea earned no response.

Nathan ignored her, his attention elsewhere.

The cameraman exchanged a look with Seraphina, signaling her to hurry.

Her smile faltered. No footage meant this trip was wasted.

"You rest, Mr. Blackwood. I’ll row."

Her arms trembled as she strained against the oars, sweat streaking her ruined makeup.

One woman doing the work of three.

Meanwhile, the other boat glided effortlessly, laughter and songs drifting across the water.

The contrast was brutal.

A pang of regret twisted in her chest.
###Chapter 599

Nathan's expression darkened when he saw how carefree Evelyn looked without him.

His chest tightened painfully, especially watching her laugh with Tristan's ex-wife.

Their voices carried across the water—one boat filled with laughter and song, the other heavy with tension. Nathan couldn't just sit there and do nothing.

He grabbed his phone and fired off a message to Evelyn.

"Sweetheart, your voice is mesmerizing. No one sings like you."

Evelyn's phone buzzed, and she assumed it was work-related.

Then she read the text.

She nearly tossed her phone into the river.

Her face twisted in irritation.

"If you're sick, go see a doctor," she snapped back via voice message.

Nathan, however, was thrilled by her immediate response.

A smirk tugged at his lips.

The WhatsApp notification chimed loudly—so loud that Seraphina and the cameraman flinched.

Nathan turned up the volume, unfazed.

Evelyn's sharp voice rang out again: "If you're sick, go get cured."

She hadn’t held back.

Nathan chuckled, then hit record to capture her singing.

Seraphina opened her mouth to protest but quickly shut it.

She knew better than to push her luck.

Nathan’s earlier warning had been crystal clear.

Evelyn silenced her phone, shook off the annoyance, and kept rowing.

Soon, her boat left the other two behind—not that anyone cared.

They’d already gotten enough drama for the episode.

Cassandra, who had been stuck with Seraphina from the start, was seething.

Seraphina’s blatant attempts to cling to Nathan were shameless.

And she wasn’t the only one who noticed.

From the corner of her eye, Cassandra saw Nathan at the stern, arms crossed, making no effort to help Seraphina.

Good.

Dominic, overseeing the shoot, exhaled in relief when he saw Evelyn enjoying herself.

No major mishaps—just enough tension for editing magic.

He handed her a fresh coconut with a smile.

"You must be exhausted, Ms. Sinclair."

"Tired, but happy," Evelyn admitted.

The game had drained her, but she felt lighter now.

Dominic passed coconuts to Vivian and Cassandra before letting them rest.

Through his binoculars, he spotted Nathan and Seraphina still drifting in circles.

He sighed.

Nathan was a magnet for trouble.

Did Seraphina really think her looks and divorce status gave her a shot with him?

Delusional.

Xavier, now in dry clothes, had prepared afternoon tea to stay relevant.

When Evelyn and the others arrived, he brightened and hurried over.

"Ms. Sinclair, Ms. Lockwood, Ms. Blake—please try this!"

Xavier knew how to play the game—charming, polite, and camera-ready.

Evelyn was pleased. If he gained popularity, he’d be a lucrative asset.

They chatted for half an hour before Nathan stormed in, Seraphina trailing nervously behind.

He loomed in the doorway, his presence suffocating.

His icy gaze locked onto Xavier, who was laughing beside Evelyn.

Two empty seats waited across from them.

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

That audacious impostor—how dare he sit next to her?

Hostility burned in his eyes.
###Chapter 600

Seraphina Devereux had been watching Nathan Blackwood with cautious eyes when he suddenly froze.

Her gaze followed his line of sight—straight to Evelyn Sinclair.

Understanding flashed across her face.

With a practiced smile, she sauntered over, resting one hand on the back of a chair while winking at Xavier Delmont.

"My, what an exquisite spread for afternoon tea! Who arranged this?"

Xavier, ever the gentleman, rose smoothly and pulled out a chair for her.

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

He's sharp, Seraphina thought.

She's interested, Xavier noted.

A second later, a tall, imposing figure strode to the empty seat beside Evelyn.

Without warning, he kicked the chair violently—sending it crashing to the floor.

The room fell deathly silent, suffocated by the man's icy aura.

Evelyn, sitting closest, didn't flinch. Not a trace of fear crossed her face.

The others stared in awe. Anyone else would’ve been trembling.

"My foot slipped."

Nathan’s voice was cold, devoid of apology.

No one bought the excuse.

But if he said it, they'd pretend to believe it.

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his gaze with equal frost.

"That chair was part of a set. You break it, you pay for it."

Nathan, halfway to sitting, stiffened.

She’s worried about a damn chair?

The others gaped.

This was the confidence of CEOs clashing.

Nathan smirked darkly, glancing at Dominic Kingsley, who was barely containing his amusement.

"Fine. Pick any brand. I’ll cover it."

Evelyn ignored him, giving Dominic a pointed look.

Go all out.

Dominic grinned.

He needed drama to hook the audience—and Evelyn and Nathan’s tension was pure gold.

Between them and the other three divorced actresses, this show would explode.

As tea was served, Dominic discreetly handed Vivian Lockwood a script.

"Let’s start with a discussion on post-divorce reflections."

Vivian’s expression flickered as she scanned the page.

Evelyn caught the exchange and shot Dominic a warning glare before smiling at Vivian.

"Let’s begin. We can share openly."

Vivian inhaled deeply.

"So… how did everyone feel after their divorces? Any regrets?"

Her eyes landed on Evelyn.

Predictable.

Evelyn cursed Dominic silently but kept her smile serene.

Under the table, Nathan texted Tristan Whitmore.

Your ex-wife’s attitude is toxic. Your mess, but now we’re all suffering.

Tristan replied instantly. You saw her? Where?

Nathan smirked and sent the show’s details.

If Evelyn was going to make his life hell, he’d return the favor.

Besides, as an investor, adding a "special guest" was just one word away.
###Chapter 601

The room fell into an uncomfortable silence. Every face showed varying degrees of contemplation and shifting emotions.

Evelyn Sinclair didn't shy away from the question. Her expression resembled that of a poised CEO at a press conference - composed yet commanding.

"My marriage to Mr. Blackwood made headlines, but that was never my intention." She paused deliberately. "Public displays of marital discord are ugly. We've agreed to remain... acquaintances."

As Evelyn spoke, Nathan Blackwood's hands clenched into fists on his knees, veins protruding beneath his skin. His jaw tightened visibly.

Her casual dismissal of their relationship made her stance painfully clear. No one noticed how the arrogant billionaire beside her suddenly deflated, his proud demeanor crumbling.

Nathan's gaze dropped to the floor, his expression twisting with barely concealed anguish. Each time she spoke like this, it felt like someone had reached into his chest and ripped out his still-beating heart.

She had no regrets. But him? He was the only one fighting to salvage what remained of their shattered marriage. Exhausted but terrified to stop. If he let go now, Evelyn might disappear from his life forever.

Seraphina Devereux saw an opportunity to intervene. She'd always relied on her beauty to manipulate men, having chosen a prominent director among countless suitors. But when his infidelities became public, she'd divorced him to save face.

Clearing her throat dramatically, Seraphina drew all attention. "Ms. Sterling, you're younger than us, but shouldn't ex-lovers remain friends? Divorce just returns you to your original status. Who's to say you won't reconcile?" She flashed a practiced smile. "They say it takes ten years to share a boat, but a hundred to share a bed. After overcoming so much together, isn't divorce such a waste over temporary disagreements?"

The reactions around the room were mixed - shock, amusement, disbelief. Only Nathan remained stone-faced, though the slight lift of his eyebrows betrayed his approval. Perhaps this woman could be useful after all.

Giselle Fontaine glanced at Seraphina before lowering her eyes without comment.

But Cassandra Blake couldn't suppress a derisive laugh. "Tell me, Seraphina, if your ex-husband came crawling back tomorrow, would you remarry him without hesitation?" The challenge hung in the air - anything Seraphina said on camera would be permanent.

Seraphina's carefully constructed mask faltered. Her face flushed an unbecoming shade of purple. She'd overplayed her hand.

That greasy director had beaten her multiple times before she'd finally returned to her wealthy patron. Why would she ever go back to that humiliation?

"You misunderstand," Seraphina backpedaled stiffly. "We divorced wishing each other happiness. If he's moved on, I wouldn't interfere."

Cassandra snorted and turned away. At least she was honest about her ambitions. A few years younger than Seraphina, she understood the entertainment industry's cutthroat nature. Her own wealthy husband had gone bankrupt, forcing her back into the spotlight.

But Nathan Blackwood? Even his table scraps could fund decades of luxury. If she played her cards right...
###Chapter 602

The thought made Cassandra Blake's sparkling eyes turn toward Nathan Blackwood. "Honestly," she said, her voice dripping with charm, "I believe marriage restricts personal freedom."

She leaned forward, her manicured fingers tracing the rim of her wineglass. "If two people truly love each other, why does a piece of paper matter? Real love doesn't need legal validation."

A sharp inhale came from Seraphina Devereux, who immediately glanced at Nathan's expression. Just as she expected—his jaw was clenched tight enough to crack walnuts. Thank God she'd stopped herself from agreeing earlier.

Evelyn Sinclair nodded enthusiastically. "That makes perfect sense."

Encouraged, Cassandra's smile widened. "We're not ordinary women. We have careers, influence, connections—and most importantly, financial independence. Why should we chain ourselves to outdated traditions?"

Seraphina barely suppressed an eye roll. Couldn't these idiots see the storm brewing in Nathan's glacial stare? Cassandra might as well have hung a neon sign saying "I volunteer as your mistress!"

Vivian Lockwood considered this before turning to the quietest woman at the table. "Giselle, what's your take?"

Giselle Fontaine blinked, caught off guard. "I... um..." She fumbled for words before murmuring something noncommittal.

Xavier Delmont chose that moment to stand, raising his champagne flute with theatrical flair. "To all you magnificent ladies—may you find happiness with or without rings on your fingers!"

Evelyn laughed, clinking her glass against his. "If only more men shared your perspective, Mr. Delmont. Gentlemen like you are rare treasures."

"Absolutely," Cassandra purred.

"I couldn't agree more," Giselle added softly.

Vivian studied Xavier—decent-looking, kind-hearted, constantly bullied by Nathan. A pang of sympathy hit her. "Hear, hear."

Xavier's ears turned pink. Wait—were these glamorous women actually into him? Not the billionaire scowling in the corner? His gaze darted to Seraphina, who'd been sneaking glances at him all evening.

A thrilling possibility dawned. With his charm and their connections... why slave away as Nathan's punching bag? His posture straightened with newfound confidence.

Behind the monitors, Dominic Kingsley rubbed his temples. This divorcee roundtable was gold—these actresses were shredding marital conventions without hesitation. The ratings would skyrocket.

Just as they prepared to wrap, Cassandra zeroed in on Nathan like a heat-seeking missile. "Mr. Blackwood, we've all shared. Don't you have thoughts?"

Ice crystallized in Nathan's gaze. "Unfaithful men deserve castration," he said, voice like a guillotine blade. "But women who glorify infidelity? That's a special kind of trash."

The studio temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees.
###Chapter 603

Cassandra Blake's face shifted through a spectrum of emotions—shock giving way to unease.

Seraphina Devereux couldn't suppress a smirk. If Nathan Blackwood were so easily won over, she would have claimed him long ago. Cassandra wouldn't even have gotten a foot in the door.

Thankfully, she'd adjusted her tactics.

Evelyn Sinclair cast a glance at Nathan, her tone sharp. "She asked about your home, not your marital status."

Nathan leaned casually against the armrest, his gaze unwavering. "Our marriage didn't fail. It was only paused because of my mistakes. If you're willing, I can prove it's still the most perfect union."

The room fell silent. No one expected such a raw declaration from the notoriously guarded Nathan Blackwood.

Evelyn stood abruptly, her expression glacial. "Big words. Don't strain yourself carrying them."

She turned on her heel, her elegant frame nearly at the door when Nathan's voice cut through the air—firm, unyielding. "I can handle the weight."

Her spine stiffened imperceptibly.

Damn him.

She quickened her pace, refusing to look back.

The atmosphere in the room thickened, but no one dared to react. The crew lowered their heads, pretending to focus on their tasks. Working under Nathan Blackwood's scrutiny was already nerve-wracking enough.

According to Dominic Kingsley's schedule, they would film their first business segment tomorrow. Though the case details were known in advance, it was still a legitimate challenge.

That evening, the entire team was booked into The Grandeur, a five-star hotel under Blackwood Industries. The choice was no coincidence—the sponsor had insisted.

As the sole financier, Nathan wasn't about to let his investment line a competitor's pockets. The hotel had been cleared in advance for privacy. The manager and Harrison, Nathan's assistant, had arranged everything.

Nathan would, of course, occupy his usual presidential suite. The rest were assigned VIP rooms.

This level of preferential treatment was unprecedented in the hotel's history.

Once cameras stopped rolling, staff discreetly escorted everyone to their designated rooms. Nathan glanced at Evelyn's room number and frowned.

His icy stare sent the manager scrambling to Harrison.

"Harrison, what do I do? Mr. Blackwood looks displeased!"

Harrison sighed. "There's a smaller suite opposite the presidential one, isn't there?"

"Yes, but no one's ever stayed on that floor except Mr. Blackwood—"

"Move Ms. Sinclair there."

The manager paled but obeyed.

The smaller suite's exterior matched the VIP rooms, making the last-minute switch inconspicuous.

When staff handed Evelyn her new keycard, she knew exactly what was happening.

Stepping off the elevator, she found Nathan waiting outside his suite, door still closed.

His presence was deliberate.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Lost your key?"

The cool detachment in her voice dimmed Nathan's smile briefly before he recovered, feigning nonchalance.

"Just thought you might want to test the presidential suite. Give feedback on any... improvements needed."
###Chapter 604

Evelyn lowered her gaze slightly as she approached, raising one elegant hand.

Her regal posture sent an unexpected thrill through Nathan. The proud Evelyn Sinclair was absolutely, devastatingly adorable. Without hesitation, he handed her the keycard.

The electronic lock beeped. Evelyn stepped inside, scanning the suite with hidden amusement. This luxury hotel belonged to Sterling Enterprises.

Considered a landmark in New York City, The Grandeur hosted countless high-profile events. Yet he still found it lacking? She shook her head in silent mockery. What a wasted opportunity.

Nathan frowned at her reaction. "Not to your standards?" He checked his platinum watch, mentally calculating if they could still make it to The Regal Grand across town.

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's adequate."

She moved further inside with her belongings. Nathan studied her carefully, relieved when no further disapproval showed. He'd stayed here often but never paid much attention.

Now he saw it through her eyes - merely passable. Evelyn turned suddenly, finding him still lingering at the threshold. Her frosty expression darkened. "Mr. Blackwood, planning to stay?"

Nathan arched an eyebrow. Exhaustion lined his features after their long day. He leaned casually against the doorframe, gaze lifting to meet hers. "May I?"

A cold laugh escaped her. "By all means."

His pulse jumped - until she continued icily, "Shall I invite those three socialites begging to share your bed? They'd make excellent company."

The temperature seemed to drop instantly.

Nathan's face hardened into a scowl. She wasn't joking. He wanted to devour her right there, but restrained himself.

Evelyn always won their battles. Nathan ground his teeth in frustration. "Fine. You win."

He turned sharply, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the frame. Evelyn smirked. Did he really think he could outmaneuver her?

She changed into silk pajamas, applied a face mask, then curled onto the plush sofa with her laptop. Urgent emails demanded attention while the production team worked late.

Meanwhile, Dominic Kingsley reviewed next day's schedule with the director when a knock interrupted. He opened the door to find Cassandra Blake in a scandalously thin robe.

Her made-up face and sultry pose made his stomach clench. After years in Hollywood, he recognized calculated seduction when he saw it.

Cassandra leaned provocatively against the doorframe, affecting innocence. "Mr. Kingsley, could you tell me Nathan's room number?" She fluttered her phone. "He summoned me but I forgot to ask where."

The transparent lie almost made him laugh.
###Chapter 605

Dominic Kingsley's expression softened.

She was looking for Nathan Blackwood.

Of course. The most powerful man in the room was an irresistible magnet for these divorced celebrities, wasn't he?

He smirked. Had he been overthinking this?

"You could always ask the front desk directly," he suggested.

Cassandra Blake's face stiffened.

It seemed she had already tried—and failed.

"Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair have no chance of reconciliation," she said, lips pressed tight. "But if a new couple emerges from our show, wouldn’t that make it the hottest program of the year?"

Cassandra studied Dominic’s reaction carefully.

What producer wouldn’t jump at such explosive content?

Sure enough, Dominic’s eyes lit up instantly.

His smile deepened, but he hesitated for three seconds before speaking softly. "Mr. Blackwood has a private presidential suite here. Top floor."

Cassandra beamed, thanking him before hurrying off.

Dominic shut the door behind her.

The director looked up from his script. "Are you sure that’s wise? Mr. Blackwood won’t be pleased when he finds out."

Dominic shrugged. "If she actually gets into Nathan’s room, I’ll eat my hat."

What kind of man was Nathan Blackwood? If Cassandra didn’t know, she was about to learn the hard way.

Less than five minutes later, the doorbell rang again.

Dominic and the director exchanged glances.

Another one? This time, it had to be the seductive Seraphina Devereux.

Dominic straightened his jacket and opened the door—only to freeze.

It was Giselle Fontaine.

He blinked in surprise.

Like Cassandra, Giselle was dressed in a scandalously sheer nightgown.

She held a bottle of red wine and two crystal glasses, her confidence radiating.

Dominic kept his expression neutral. "Can I help you, Ms. Fontaine?"

Giselle shook her head.

Dominic didn’t wait for her to ask. "Mr. Blackwood is in the presidential suite. Top floor."

Giselle’s eyes widened before she flashed him a grateful smile. "Thank you, Mr. Kingsley."

She practically floated toward the elevator.

Dominic shut the door with a quiet sigh.

The director was still scribbling notes on his script. "None of them are easy to handle. I suppose Seraphina will be next."

Logically, she should be.

But she never came.

With her personality, she wasn’t the type to let others outshine her.

Yet no matter how long Dominic waited, Seraphina never appeared to ask about Nathan’s room.

Because she was already fast asleep in hers.

Seraphina had just discovered how exhausting rowing a boat could be.

Her body ached more than if she’d carried a boulder uphill. The moment she saw the bed, she collapsed into oblivion.

Inside the presidential suite, Evelyn Sinclair finished answering emails and handling urgent matters before Isabella Montgomery’s video call lit up her iPad.

She answered without hesitation.

"You left me behind, Evie!" Isabella pouted.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Lucas talks too much. This is a work trip."

She explained the show’s premise, and Isabella listened with rapt attention. When it came to gossip, she never dragged her feet.

Their debate over whose divorce philosophy was more valid grew heated—until the doorbell interrupted them.

Evelyn frowned. Had she imagined it?

The chime rang again, more insistent this time.

She set the iPad down and went to answer it.

"Mr. Blackwood, I wanted to personally apologize for our earlier… misunderstanding."

Cassandra Blake stood there, her gaze sultry, her intentions unmistakable.
###Chapter 606

The door swung open to reveal Cassandra Blake standing there in a scandalous silk nightgown that barely covered her shoulders.

Both women froze in shock. Cassandra's face drained of color so fast her expensive makeup couldn't hide it.

Here she was, trying to seduce Evelyn Sinclair's ex-husband, caught red-handed like some cheap mistress. Evelyn recovered first.

One glance at Cassandra's outfit told her everything. Her icy gaze raked over the actress from head to toe, making Cassandra wish the floor would swallow her whole. "M-Ms. Sinclair, I didn't know you'd be here..."

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile as she pushed the door wide open. "Nathan Blackwood isn't here. This is my room. Would you like to come in and check?"

Cassandra shook her head violently, backing away. The humiliation burned through her like acid. If this had been any other woman, she wouldn't feel this exposed. But Evelyn Sinclair?

Everyone in the industry knew not to cross the Sterling Enterprises heiress. Even Dominic Kingsley tread carefully around her.

"N-no need! I wasn't...I mean, I just wanted to apologize to Mr. Blackwood about today's filming..." Her words tumbled out in a nervous jumble.

Evelyn watched her squirm with mild amusement. 'Why is she explaining herself to me? Does she think I care?'

She pulled out her phone. "I can call Nathan for you if you'd like to speak with him directly."

"No!" Cassandra nearly shrieked. "I-I'll talk to him tomorrow. Goodnight, Ms. Sinclair!"

She fled toward the elevators without looking back, her designer heels clicking frantically against the marble floor. For the first time in her career, the famous actress felt like a common streetwalker.

Evelyn shook her head and closed the door, already dismissing the encounter. But before she could sit down, the doorbell chimed again.

'Did Cassandra change her mind?'

She opened the door to find Giselle Fontaine standing there in a white nightgown that walked the line between innocent and indecent. The delicate makeup only enhanced her calculated allure.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Giselle murmured coyly without looking up, holding up a wine bottle and two glasses. "I made this myself. Would you care to join me?"

Her act was flawless - the hesitant seductress testing boundaries, trying to chip away at Nathan's famous reserve with gentle persistence. Why else would she be dressed like this?

When no answer came, Giselle finally lifted her gaze. The color drained from her face when she saw Evelyn standing there instead.
###Chapter 607

Giselle stammered, "M-Ms. Sinclair... You..." Evelyn quickly clarified, "Nathan Blackwood isn't here."

"This is my room! If you don't believe me, come in and see for yourself!" Giselle lowered her gaze, forcing a smile as she tried to compose her nervous expression.

"No... No need, I..." Giselle couldn't think of any plausible excuse for visiting Nathan's room dressed like this. The realization that this was his ex-wife's room made her flush with embarrassment.

Her fingers tightened around the wine bottle as she bit her lower lip. Her cheeks burned scarlet under Evelyn's knowing gaze.

Evelyn studied Giselle's discomfort and decided not to show favoritism. "Let me help you contact Mr. Blackwood so you can speak with him directly."

Before Evelyn could reach for her phone, Giselle took a startled step backward. "That won't be necessary, Ms. Sinclair. I just remembered I haven't memorized tomorrow's lines. Goodnight!"

Giselle turned to leave, then suddenly spun back and thrust the bottle at Evelyn. "This is my family's homemade wine recipe. Please try it!" She fled before Evelyn could respond, her retreat more frantic than Cassandra's earlier escape.

Evelyn chuckled at the wine bottle and glasses in her hands. Even divorced, Nathan remained irresistible to women. Had they still been married, the horde would've been worse. Her expression darkened.

Pouring herself a glass, Evelyn savored the rich bouquet. The complex flavors danced on her tongue with remarkable depth. She'd tasted many fine wines, but this stood out as uniquely refreshing. No wonder Giselle had been so confident bringing it to Nathan.

From the iPad on the sofa, Isabella's voice cut through. "Are they gone? Those women actually chase after that scoundrel? Are they blind?" Evelyn froze.

She'd forgotten the ongoing video call. Isabella had witnessed everything. Heat rose in Evelyn's cheeks as she picked up the tablet.

"Objectively speaking, Nathan's appeal is like a starving wolf spotting wounded prey. Even knowing it's dangerous, they can't resist." Isabella burst into laughter at the analogy.

Noticing Evelyn's flushed face, Isabella frowned. "You drank that woman's wine? Are you insane? It could be drugged!"

The warning jolted Evelyn from her wine-induced haze. She examined the glass thoughtfully. "I don't think she'd risk that... though it is unusually potent." Despite her growing dizziness, she couldn't resist another sip.

As Evelyn poured the remaining wine, her vision blurred. She barely managed to fill the glass without spilling. "Evelyn! You're drunk after two sips - that's definitely spiked!" Isabella's panicked voice went unheeded as Evelyn continued drinking.
###Chapter 608

Nathan Blackwood barely registered the water dripping from his hair as he bolted out the door. Isabella Montgomery's frantic call had sent him rushing to Evelyn Sinclair's suite without a second thought.

He jabbed the doorbell. No answer.

Pounded on the door. Still nothing.

Isabella's voice crackled through the phone. "Are you seriously this dense? If she could open the damn door, would I be calling you? Get a key card!"

Nathan clenched his jaw. He'd tolerate her sharp tongue—just this once—because she was right. Evelyn needed him.

In one fluid motion, he pulled the spare card from his pocket. The lock beeped. The door swung open.

Even Isabella sounded stunned. "That was... fast."

She'd expected panic. A mad dash to the front desk. Maybe an angry call to security.

Instead, Nathan was already inside.

The scent of wine hit him first—rich, heavy, wrong. His gaze snapped to the sofa.

Evelyn lay there, limp, her cheeks flushed.

His pulse spiked.

"Evelyn."

Isabella's voice cut through the iPad screen. "This is your fault! She drank that wine—the one meant for you. One bottle shouldn't have done this. She handles a dozen without blinking!"

Nathan's fingers curled into fists.

Spiked.

Of course it was.

His jaw tightened as he scanned the fallen bottle.

"Half the women at that event were hunting you down," Isabella snapped. "Evelyn intercepted them. You really think they wouldn't drug the wine?"

Nathan's breath turned ragged.

A cold, lethal fury settled in his chest.

"Make her throw it up," Isabella ordered. "Then call a doctor. And deal with those women. But if you lay a finger on her—"

Nathan reached over and ended the call.

Silence.

He exhaled sharply, then moved to Evelyn's side. One arm slid beneath her shoulders, the other under her knees. She was lighter than he expected.

Her breath warmed his neck as she nuzzled closer, murmuring something incoherent.

Nathan froze.

He'd never held her like this.

Not during their marriage. Not after.

Evelyn had always been ice—untouchable, unyielding.

But now?

She was soft. Warm.

Fragile.

His throat tightened.

Her lips brushed his skin, and he nearly lost his grip.

No.

He forced himself to move, carrying her to the bathroom. Gently, he set her on the edge of the tub.

"Evelyn. Wake up."

A drowsy groan. She turned away.

Nathan cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. "Come on. Just throw up. Then you can sleep."

She swatted at his hand, irritated.

Nathan almost smiled.

Even drunk, she was stubborn.

But he wasn't giving up.

Not this time.
###Chapter 609

Nathan's fingers tightened around Evelyn's restless hands as he kept murmuring her name. "Evelyn... Sweetheart... Darling..."

Evelyn scrunched her nose in irritation at the persistent buzzing near her ear.

That annoying sound was murdering her sleep. "Even Leo knows better than to wake me up. Why won't this damn mosquito leave me alone?"

Evelyn had always been a light sleeper with a terrible temper when disturbed. She couldn't take it anymore and forced her heavy eyelids open.

Through her blurred vision, she saw chiseled masculine features that seemed vaguely familiar. 'Is that Nathan Blackwood? Or Xavier?' Her foggy mind struggled to focus as the man's intermittent voice droned on like some annoying incantation.

Suddenly irritated beyond measure, she lashed out with her nails, scratching him sharply. "Shut. Up."

Miraculously, the noise stopped immediately. Nathan's expression darkened as he stared at her, touching the stinging scratch mark on his neck.

She gets violent when drunk? As CEO of Blackwood Industries, he wasn't used to being manhandled. But he had no free hands to tend to the wound, only feeling its burning sting.

Whatever. He'd tolerate it. Seeing no signs of vomiting but noticing her discomfort, Nathan carefully lifted her onto the bed.

Not taking any chances, Nathan immediately called Harrison to test the wine bottle and glasses for drugs. Until he saw the results, he wouldn't relax.

The hotel physician arrived to examine Evelyn thoroughly. After a meticulous checkup, the doctor finally reported, "Ms. Sinclair simply drank too much. Some honey water will help. Nothing alarming."

Nathan frowned. "You may leave."

Once alone, Nathan sat quietly beside the sleeping Evelyn, watching her peaceful expression. Oblivious to the world, she seemed lost in pleasant dreams.

Shaking his head, Nathan fetched a warm towel to gently wipe her face. "What possessed you to drink so recklessly? And from random glasses? Tomorrow, someone's going to pay for this." Only he knew the sheer panic that had gripped him upon hearing she'd consumed potentially drugged wine.

Evelyn turned over abruptly, her nightgown slipping to reveal a smooth, pale shoulder. Nathan froze. His Adam's apple bobbed as his gaze darkened.

Outside, the night wind howled against the windows. But here, the warm, soft woman before him made restraint nearly impossible.

Leaning closer, his voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Evelyn... Darling, I need to kiss you..." After tending to her all night, wouldn't he deserve this small reward?

As president of a billion-dollar corporation, he'd never imagined struggling with such basic self-control. But the desire to taste her lips overwhelmed him.

The single lit lamp cast intimate shadows across the quiet room. Evelyn remained unaware as Nathan's mouth hovered inches from hers.

Just as he was about to close the distance, Evelyn's eyes flew open. Nathan jerked back, heart pounding with guilty surprise. But Evelyn simply blinked drowsily, her unfocused gaze landing on him.

"Xavier," she slurred, "I'll make you famous..."
###Chapter 610

Evelyn's fingers traced the contours of a face strikingly similar to Nathan's—flawless, sculpted perfection.

She gave his cheek a playful pat.

Not bad.

This face could fetch a fortune on the market.

Xavier's just an actor, anyway. I can make him famous.

She didn't notice the dark shift in the man beside her.

His expression turned glacial, his entire demeanor radiating danger. Nathan's grip tightened on her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. His voice was deceptively soft, laced with venom.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "look again. Who am I?"

Even in his gentleness, there was steel. He had bent over backward for her—compromised, indulged, spoiled her rotten. But his patience had limits.

The ruthless businessman in him refused to share.

If she wouldn't choose him willingly, he'd make the choice for her.

His grip tightened.

"Tell me," he demanded, voice rough. "Then I'll let you sleep."

Evelyn groaned, her eyelids heavy. Someone had dared interrupt her sacred slumber.

Unforgivable.

She squinted at the blurred figure looming over her.

If not Xavier... who?

Then it hit her.

Only one man would be this insufferable.

Her lips curled into a smirk.

"Ugh. Nathan Blackheart."

The room plunged into icy silence.

Nathan went rigid.

His jaw clenched, his knuckles whitening.

Blackheart?

She had the audacity to rename him—insult him—before rolling over and drifting back to sleep.

Meanwhile, his blood roared in his ears.

Rage.

Possessiveness.

Frustration.

He exhaled sharply, forcing himself to walk away.

She's drunk. Just drunk.

But the name lingered.

And so did the storm in his eyes.
###Chapter 611

The doorbell shattered the silence.

Nathan's heavy footsteps echoed through the penthouse as he strode toward the entrance. His expression was glacial when he swung the door open.

Harrison stood there clutching the toxicology report. His fingers trembled slightly as he handed over the documents. "Mr. Blackwood, the results came back. The wine contained trace amounts of hallucinogens. Alcohol content measured at 51% ABV."

Harrison had personally overseen the rushed lab analysis. He'd threatened to fire the entire night staff if they didn't prioritize this test. The moment he saw the results, he'd raced back to the penthouse.

Nathan scanned the report. His jaw tightened. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "Find everyone who entered this penthouse tonight. Especially whoever delivered that bottle." His voice was arctic. "Whoever dared cross this line will regret it."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Consider it done." He closed the door quietly behind him.

Nathan dragged a hand down his face. It had been years since he'd felt this level of fury.

Returning to the bedroom, his gaze darkened as it fell upon Evelyn's sleeping form. He studied her delicate features, committing every detail to memory.

This was the scene that haunted his dreams. Her in his bed. Where she belonged. Where she used to be. The thought sent razor-sharp pain through his chest.

Nathan leaned down, brushing his lips against her forehead. His fingers gently tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "Goodnight, Mrs. Blackwood," he murmured. "I'll be waiting when you come back to me."

With that, he left to hunt down those responsible.

Harrison spent the predawn hours combing through security footage. He isolated the clip showing two women knocking on Evelyn's door. Within minutes, security had both actresses detained in the basement holding room.

He texted Nathan, unsure if his boss was sleeping. The response was instantaneous - a phone call in under three seconds. "Where are they?" Nathan's voice was deadly calm.

"Basement secure room. Discreet location."

Sixty seconds later, Nathan stood over the terrified woman bound to a chair. His presence filled the space like a gathering storm. Two massive security officers flanked the trembling actress, their grips ironclad on her shoulders.

Giselle Fontaine cowered in the chair, still wearing the torn white nightgown from her earlier struggle. At Nathan's nod, the guard removed the gag from her mouth.

Her arms were wrenched painfully behind her back, joints screaming in protest. Tears streamed down her contorted face. "Mr. Blackwood! Please! I'll apologize to Ms. Sinclair! I'll do anything!"

Only now did she realize her mistake. This wasn't about losing roles or reputation. This was about survival.

Nathan's lips curled into a humorless smile. His eyes held the merciless glint of a predator. "An apology?" His voice dropped to a whisper. "Do you think that undoes what you've done? That she'll smile and forget because you say you're sorry?"

A dangerous energy crackled around him. The room temperature seemed to plummet further. Somewhere in that glacial gaze, madness simmered.
###Chapter 612

Nathan Blackwood would never let anyone who dared to harm Evelyn Sinclair walk away unscathed. Evelyn was his entire world.

Giselle Fontaine was paralyzed with fear. The legendary, untouchable Nathan Blackwood stood before her now, his expression so icy it could freeze hell over. Though he was mere inches away, she felt death's chill creeping into her bones.

Her body trembled uncontrollably. Cold sweat drenched her clothes. How delusional she had been earlier.

She had been caught and dragged here in less than an hour. Pathetic. Tears streamed down her face as violent sobs wracked her body.

"Mr. Blackwood, I was wrong—" Her voice cracked. "I'll leave the industry. I'll disappear. Just... please spare me."

Nathan took a step forward, looming over her like a predator. His eyes burned with something dark, something unhinged.

Giselle shrank back.

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "No one touches her. No one."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Nathan's next words were merciless. "So no, I won't let you off easy."

Giselle couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe.

Nathan turned and walked out. A man of his refinement didn't dirty his hands. He only gave the order.

Harrison followed silently. He wasn't surprised.

When it came to Evelyn, Nathan showed no mercy—not even to himself, let alone others.

Outside, Nathan's gaze remained glacial. His presence alone was suffocating.

Harrison hesitated before speaking. "Sir... how far should we take this? She's a public figure. If word gets out—"

Nathan lit a cigarette with practiced ease. The flame flickered against his sharp features. He exhaled slowly, smoke curling around his lips.

"Ask her which hand she used to give Evelyn the wine." His voice was flat. "Spare the other one."

Harrison's eyes widened. He remembered the surveillance footage clearly—Giselle had used both hands.

Nathan never forgot details.

After a beat, Harrison nodded, voice thick with reverence. "Understood."

Nathan stepped into the elevator without another glance. "Keep this quiet. If Evelyn asks, tell her to come to me directly." His tone hardened. "And blacklist the other woman."

Harrison bowed. "Yes, sir."

Dominic Kingsley was just settling into his office when Harrison knocked.

The documents in his hand made Dominic pause. "You didn't need to deliver these yourself."

Everyone knew Harrison answered only to Nathan. His presence here was... unsettling.

Harrison smiled politely. "Just passing by." His expression shifted. "Mr. Blackwood also asked me to inform you—the show is suspended."

Dominic stiffened. "What?"

"Ms. Lockwood and Ms. Devereux are the only leads left." Harrison's tone was light, but his gaze wasn't. "Cassandra Blake and Giselle Fontaine have withdrawn."

Dominic's throat went dry. "Why?"

Harrison stared at him until Dominic squirmed.

Then he smiled—cold and knowing.

"Mr. Kingsley," he said softly, "you already know why."

Dominic's stomach dropped.

Playing dumb? Harrison thought. As if he’s forgotten about the cameras.
###Chapter 613

The first rays of dawn slipped through the curtains, painting golden stripes across Evelyn Sinclair's face.

She groaned, pressing a hand to her throbbing temple. The remnants of last night's wine still fogged her mind.

Evelyn forced her eyes open, blinking against the harsh morning light. Her designer dress was wrinkled but intact.

"Thank God," she muttered. At least she'd made it back to bed without incident.

After a quick shower, her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Dominic Kingsley's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Kingsley," she answered, voice still rough from sleep. "Calling at this hour - business or pleasure?"

"Ms. Sinclair..." Dominic hesitated. "Nathan Blackwood just fired Cassandra Blake and Giselle Fontaine. Who should we get to replace them?"

The words hit Evelyn like a bucket of ice water.

"What?" Her grip tightened on the phone. "Why would he—"

"Your guess is as good as mine," Dominic interrupted. "Maybe ask the great Mr. Blackwood himself?"

Evelyn ended the call without another word.

She dressed in record time, storming toward Nathan's suite at the end of the hall. The usually bustling hotel corridor stood eerily quiet.

Just as she raised her hand to knock, the door swung open.

Harrison, Nathan's ever-present assistant, greeted her with a polite nod. "Good morning, Ms. Sinclair."

"Harrison." Evelyn forced her voice steady.

"You're looking well this morning," Harrison observed, studying her face.

Evelyn frowned. "Shouldn't I be?"

Harrison exhaled in apparent relief. "Mr. Blackwood is expecting you."

The odd exchange lingered in Evelyn's mind as she stepped inside. What game was Nathan playing now?

Her thoughts scattered when she saw the scene before her.

Nathan lounged on the sofa, his tailored suit accentuating his powerful frame. But it was the woman kneeling on the floor that stole Evelyn's breath.

Cassandra Blake - once glamorous, now broken. Her designer dress was torn, face streaked with blood and tears.

The air turned to ice.

Cassandra lunged toward Evelyn with a choked sob, crawling like a wounded animal. Her hands - twisted at unnatural angles - left smears of blood on the carpet.

"Please," Cassandra begged, pressing her forehead to Evelyn's shoes. "I'll do anything."

Evelyn's stomach turned. The woman's fingers hung limp, clearly broken beyond repair.

Nathan hadn't just fired them.

He'd destroyed them.
###Chapter 614

Giselle Fontaine knelt on the marble floor, her entire body trembling violently.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry! I was wrong! I deserve the worst punishment—but please, spare my life!"

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen, a strange sensation creeping over her.

Upon closer inspection, she recognized the woman—Giselle, the seemingly meek woman she had just met.

What the hell is happening here?

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Nathan Blackwood.

He sat motionless, an aura of icy dominance radiating from him. His eyes were glacial, dark pools that seemed to freeze the very air around them.

His fingers tapped once against the armrest of the sofa.

"Giselle," he said, his voice dangerously soft. "Tell Ms. Sinclair exactly what you put in her wine."

The room plunged into silence.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Seasoning?

She inhaled sharply, forcing down the fury threatening to erupt. "What are you saying? You drugged the wine you gave me last night?"

Giselle was too terrified to speak, her sobs coming in ragged gasps.

Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. His voice dropped lower, laced with lethal warning.

"Speak. Or do I need to have someone help you open your mouth?"

Giselle collapsed forward, her face pressed against the floor.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, piecing together the events of last night.

Giselle's face was ghostly pale. She swallowed hard, still refusing to meet Nathan's gaze. Instead, she turned toward Evelyn, her voice shaking.

"M-Ms. Sinclair… I'm so sorry… I was stupid—I added… a trace of hallucinogen to the wine."

She squeezed her eyes shut. "I was delusional! I swear I’ll never do it again! Please, have mercy—just let me go this once!"

She had originally planned to use ecstasy—but that was too obvious. Too fast-acting.

A hallucinogen was subtler. More deniable.

The room remained deathly silent, the only sound Giselle's choked sobs.

She could still feel the terror of last night—the way Nathan’s men had broken her fingers one by one without hesitation. No mercy, not even for a woman.

Now, as she looked at Nathan—his expression like a demon from the depths of hell—every nerve in her body screamed in fear.

"I didn’t mean it! I swear! Ms. Sinclair, I never expected you to be in that room! I don’t know what came over me—I didn’t want to hurt you!"

Giselle crawled forward desperately, nearly touching Evelyn’s shoes.

Evelyn recoiled instantly, staring down at her with icy contempt.

Any trace of sympathy evaporated.

Damn right she deserves this.

Nathan had watched Evelyn’s reaction throughout the interrogation. She didn’t need to say a word.

His gaze shifted from Giselle to Evelyn, softening slightly.

"Do you feel better now?"

He had been exacting revenge for her.

Evelyn glanced at him, then back at Giselle.

The fire inside her hadn’t been extinguished—but Giselle was already broken beyond repair.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"Giselle, you’ve completely shattered my impression of you." Her voice was razor-sharp. "Who would’ve thought the most unassuming person would be the most vicious?"

Damn. I was blind.

No matter how much Giselle begged, Evelyn wasn’t the type to forgive betrayal.

Once a traitor, always a traitor.

As Giselle continued pleading, Nathan turned to Evelyn.

"So," he murmured. "What do you want to do now?"
###Chapter 615

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent for a long moment. Her voice was icy when she finally spoke. "Ban her from the entertainment industry."

Nathan Blackwood arched an eyebrow.

Wasn't this outcome already obvious? How merciful of her.

Before Giselle Fontaine could even exhale in relief, Nathan ordered one of his bodyguards, "Take her away."

"Yes, sir."

Nathan absently traced the edge of his wristwatch. "Also, there's a severe lack of educational development in certain parts of Africa. Giselle can volunteer there to atone for her sins. She won't need to return."

Giselle's face drained of color as she collapsed to the floor.

She felt as if her bones had been ripped from her body—she couldn’t even hold herself up.

This meant she wouldn’t just disappear from Montecito. She might vanish from the world entirely.

Nathan was truly ruthless.

The bodyguards didn’t give Giselle a chance to beg. They dragged her out by her arms.

Though Evelyn thought the punishment was excessive, Nathan had done this for her. She couldn’t side against him now.

They were alone in the room again.

Evelyn had expected something to happen between them last night, but nothing had.

And yet, Nathan had still cleaned up her mess.

He had saved her again.

Evelyn regretted questioning him the moment she walked in earlier. She’d been too harsh on someone who kept helping her.

After a pause, she cleared her throat and spoke first. "Ahem... Mr. Blackwood, thank you for helping me again."

Nathan’s dark eyes fixed on her, unreadable. "And?"

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

Nathan studied her seriously. "How do you plan to thank me?"

Evelyn frowned. "I just did!"

Nathan exhaled sharply, unimpressed.

Evelyn considered it. They were both CEOs of major corporations. She couldn’t be stingy.

"Fine," she relented. "How do you want me to thank you? State your terms—but keep it reasonable."

She was grateful, but she still had her limits.

Nathan chuckled, amused by her stubbornness. He took his time thinking.

Evelyn’s patience thinned. What ridiculous demand is he concocting?

Finally, Nathan spoke. "How about this? Rent out every LED screen in the city tonight at 8 PM. Broadcast your gratitude to me. It should say, 'I, Evelyn Sinclair, would like to thank Nathan Blackwood—the greatest man in the world!' Keep it running for one minute."

He seemed dead serious.

His expression remained indifferent as he shrugged, lips quirking. "No emotions required. Just a public acknowledgment."

It was excessive—but for Evelyn, it was nothing.

The only problem? Those disgustingly flattering words.

Evelyn stayed silent for three full minutes, debating.

Finally, she forced a smile. "Sure. No problem."

She owed him. She’d let him set the terms. Backing out now would be petty.

Whatever. It’s just one minute.

Nathan smirked, having expected her compliance. "I also dealt with that other woman for you. Consider that a free bonus. No need to thank me."

He stood, buttoning his suit jacket with effortless grace. His movements were smooth, almost elegant.

"Then I’ll wait for the good news."

He extended his hand for a handshake.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. She shook his hand briefly before pulling away.

With a tight smile, she said, "Of course. Someone as noble as you deserves to be broadcasted on every screen in the world."
###Chapter 616

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of Nathan Blackwood's suite, her mind immediately shifting back to work. She descended to the lobby to meet Dominic Kingsley.

The incident remained strictly confidential.

Only Dominic's sharp instincts had picked up on the disturbance. The official withdrawal statements from Cassandra Blake and Giselle Fontaine's agencies had likely been arranged by Nathan himself.

They spent the afternoon strategizing how to salvage the show and minimize losses. Yesterday's marathon filming session had already replaced two participants.

Fortunately, it was only May. There was still time to recruit new talent for reshoots.

But Evelyn had no intention of participating in the reshoots.

Repeating the same games would feel painfully artificial. Her acting skills weren't professional enough to pull off such deception convincingly.

Dominic had secured Arabella Winslow - a legendary divorced actress who normally wouldn't consider reality TV. Somehow, he'd persuaded her to give it a two-day trial.

The second replacement was Isadora Vanderbilt, a 25-year-old actress Lucas Sterling had recommended. Isadora had been married for seven years, the golden couple of Hollywood.

Until last week, when her husband's infidelity surfaced. Isadora's public defense of him had drawn widespread ridicule.

Now she needed to control the narrative. Her participation would serve as the perfect platform to announce their divorce - far better than letting tabloids break the story.

With both replacements secured and scheduled to arrive in days, the production team breathed easier.

Dominic planned to shoot other segments first to facilitate post-production. Evelyn returned to her room for a quick shower. Her phone displayed multiple missed calls from Isabella Montgomery.

Evelyn frowned. Hadn't she silenced her phone? She immediately returned the call, which was answered before the second ring.

"Finally!" Isabella's voice crackled with urgency. "Are you okay? Was that wine spiked? Did Nathan Blackwood try anything?"

Evelyn froze mid-step. The mention of wine triggered fragmented memories.

Right. She'd been video-calling Isabella while drinking. Then... Her brow furrowed. "How did Nathan get into my room?"

Isabella hesitated, guilt creeping into her voice. "I...I panicked. Asked him to check on you. I thought someone might have drugged you."

Evelyn's breath caught. Nathan had taken care of her all night and left without a word? Without Isabella, she'd never have known.

An odd sensation fluttered through her chest - light as a feather's touch.

Isabella interpreted the silence as confirmation. "It was drugged?!" She pinched her brow, staring at the cloudless sky outside her window. Her instincts had been right.

Regret flooded her. She should have gone herself, not given Nathan that opportunity. "Oh God... Did that bastard take advantage of you?"

The line went silent. Evelyn exhaled slowly, keeping her voice measured. "Relax. Just trace amounts of hallucinogens. I'm fine. Someone like him... doesn't exploit vulnerable situations."

Isabella released a shaky breath. "Thank God. If he'd touched you, I'd have carved him up like Thanksgiving turkey."

Evelyn chuckled. "Spare his worthless hide."
###Chapter 617

Nathan Blackwood saved Evelyn Sinclair, yet he still hadn't broken his infuriating habit.

"Huh, renting out the entire city's LED screens to thank him? He just wants everyone to know our relationship isn't ordinary, right?" Evelyn rolled her eyes internally.

Isabella Montgomery smirked. "But that woman had the nerve to spike your drink! Do you need my help to teach her a lesson?"

Evelyn smiled faintly, her mind already made up.

The punishment would be far worse than just kicking her out of the entertainment industry.

Isabella grinned. "Good job!"

After hanging up, Evelyn felt a pang of hunger, but Dominic Kingsley messaged the group to gather at the venue immediately.

She rolled her eyes. "Ugh. Dominic really knows how to exploit people."

Slowly, she made her way to the hotel entrance. Everyone else had already left in their cars.

Dominic, at least, had the decency to wait for her at the door.

Evelyn shot him a dark look before sliding into the car.

He handed her a neatly packaged sandwich and milk.

Her expression softened as she took a bite.

"Didn't you have to wait in line for this?"

Dominic shrugged. "Nathan asked me to give it to you."

Evelyn froze.

How did he know she loved sandwiches from this particular shop?

A flicker of warmth stirred in her chest—until she remembered the astronomical sum she'd spent on those citywide LED screens.

Suddenly, the sandwich didn't taste as good.

"This must be a coincidence," she muttered.

Dominic sighed enviously. "Mr. Blackwood has such patience. He personally brought you breakfast—I heard he even goes to buy it himself!"

Evelyn shot him a cold sidelong glance.

Dominic swallowed hard, guilt creeping into his voice. "Actually... Sadie and Giselle came to me last night. I might have mentioned Nathan was staying in the penthouse suite..."

Evelyn stiffened.

Her gaze turned icy.

So that was why.

She chewed slowly, then let out a cold laugh. "You're quite the busybody, aren't you?"

Of all people, Dominic had to be the one stirring trouble?

"If I'd known, I wouldn't have stayed in that suite," she muttered.

This was worse than a nightmare.

Thankfully, it was just a hallucinogen. If it had been something else... the consequences would have been unthinkable.

Any sympathy she'd had for Giselle being exiled to some remote corner of Africa vanished instantly.

She deserved it.

Dominic rubbed his nose nervously. "I just wanted to see Nathan's reaction. Did he really kick them out over this?"

Nathan didn’t need Dominic’s permission for his decisions, so he’d only been informed after the fact.

"How would I know?" Evelyn sneered. "Ask him yourself."

At that moment, she seriously considered tossing Dominic into the middle of the Pacific to fend for himself.

Dominic thought grimly, If I dared ask him, would I even need to ask her?

On the way to the venue, Dominic fussed over Evelyn like a nervous servant, terrified of what Nathan might do to him later.

They finally arrived at the shooting location—an entire office floor Dominic had rented at great expense.

Equipment and cameras were already set up.

Vivian Lockwood, Seraphina Devereux, and Xavier Delmont had arrived early.

Vivian had dressed sharply in a formal business suit, while Seraphina opted for a curve-hugging dress that left little to the imagination.

As Evelyn stepped inside, she felt uncomfortably warm and instinctively shrugged off her jacket, handing it to Xavier, who stood nearby trying to look chivalrous.

He reached for it—only for a pair of slender hands to intercept it a second later.
###Chapter 618

Evelyn Sinclair picked up her jacket from the side and sighed.

"This Italian designer piece is custom-made, isn't it? There isn’t another like it in the world."

She was surprised Seraphina Devereux didn’t immediately rush to knock on Nathan Blackwood’s door. Maybe she wasn’t as frivolous or fame-obsessed as she appeared.

Evelyn’s opinion of her rose instantly. She offered a polite smile.

"I can recommend the designer if you’d like."

The man was a legendary craftsman in Italy, known for taking only a handful of private clients a year. His work was unparalleled—no mass-produced luxury brand could compare.

Seraphina’s eyes flickered with interest before dimming. "Never mind. My wardrobe is all sponsored. I don’t get to choose."

Evelyn didn’t press further. Seraphina casually handed the jacket to Nathan, who had appeared behind her.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan barely glanced at Evelyn before taking it. He hung it on the nearby rack with the same indifference as tossing aside a napkin.

Xavier Delmont, waiting nearby, gaped at the exchange. He hadn’t even gotten the chance to touch Evelyn’s jacket.

Evelyn ignored the moment and moved to take a seat. Vivian Lockwood, cool and composed beside her, glanced up from the script and nodded in greeting.

Evelyn was about to speak when a familiar presence settled beside her.

Plenty of empty seats, yet Nathan had to sit right next to her.

Typical.

His cologne carried the same restless energy he did—intimidating to most, but Evelyn remained unfazed. She kept her expression neutral.

Nathan leaned in slightly, his voice low. "Did you eat the breakfast?"

Evelyn stiffened but kept her posture rigid, refusing to give any hint of familiarity in front of others.

She feigned surprise, lowering her voice. "Oh, that was from you? No wonder it tasted terrible."

Nathan chuckled, the shadows in his eyes lifting just a fraction.

"Is that so? Then I wasted twenty minutes standing in line for nothing."

A faint note of disappointment laced his words.

Evelyn blinked. He actually waited in line himself? Nathan Blackwood, standing behind ordinary people to buy a sandwich? Unthinkable.

She looked down at her phone to hide her shock. "Mr. Blackwood, since when do you wait in lines? I thought you’d just buy the entire café with a snap of your fingers."

Nathan paused. "If you want it every day, I wouldn’t mind buying it. It’s not like I’d go bankrupt."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. "Who would want that?"

Across from them, Seraphina’s expression soured. I’d kill for that offer.

Xavier, realizing he was out of his depth, quickly intervened. "Ms. Sinclair, I heard you prefer white tea. Let me prepare some for you."

Evelyn glanced up, offering a polite smile.

Not bad. Setting aside her initial impression, he was sharp.

Xavier set the tray down, rolling up his sleeves with practiced ease. All those useless skills he’d picked up for filming finally had a purpose.
###Chapter 619

Evelyn slipped her phone into her pocket, determined to savor every moment of Xavier's tea ceremony.

She signaled the cameraman to focus on Xavier - this rising star was her golden ticket to ratings.

Seraphina swayed toward Xavier with calculated grace, resting one manicured hand on his shoulder. Her eyes sparkled with exaggerated admiration.

"Xavier darling, you make tea too? How fascinating!" Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness. "Would you teach me? Though I'm afraid I'm rather slow..."

The room fell silent.

Seraphina pressed closer, her curves brushing against Xavier's arm. A flush crept up his neck as he ducked his head, boyish charm warring with sudden shyness.

"Of...of course," he stammered, fingers fumbling with the teapot.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Something wasn't right here.

Across the room, Vivian nearly dropped her script, staring at the pair with undisguised suspicion.

"The water should be precisely eighty degrees," Xavier explained hoarsely.

"Let me help." Seraphina reached for the kettle. Their hands collided - Xavier's large palm engulfing her delicate fingers as if protecting her from the steam.

"Careful," he breathed.

Time suspended. Neither pulled away.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around her teacup. Every eye in the room tracked the lingering contact.

Nathan's sudden entrance shattered the moment. A pointed cough sent them springing apart, both flushed crimson.

The crew exchanged glances, struggling to process the bizarre scene. Only Nathan seemed pleased, his lips curling in dark satisfaction.

Seraphina caught his subtle nod of approval. Her plan was working perfectly.

To create space for Nathan and Evelyn, she'd willingly become Xavier's distraction.

Dominic cleared his throat. "We're all professionals here. Carry on."

The room erupted into forced activity.

Seraphina kept stealing glances at Xavier through her lashes. He responded with boyish grins that sat unnaturally on features so similar to Nathan's.

Evelyn studied both men, realization dawning.

Side by side, their differences became glaring. Xavier's open flirtation made him appear juvenile compared to Nathan's controlled intensity. That carefully cultivated resemblance? A cheap imitation.

Her sigh drew Nathan's attention. His smirk widened.

'Heartbroken already?' he thought viciously. 'Good.'

His gaze slid to Xavier, cold calculation replacing amusement.

This imposter had overstayed his welcome.
###Chapter 620

The morning's hectic schedule had left everyone numb to Xavier Delmont and Seraphina Devereux's shameless public displays of affection.

What truly shocked Evelyn Sinclair was how these two polar opposites had somehow become a couple.

Their pairing defied all logic - a man who valued pedigree above all else with a woman who flaunted her scandalous past. Yet Dominic Kingsley seemed determined to push this absurd publicity stunt.

Evelyn's fingers tapped rhythmically against her designer purse. She'd need to coordinate with Dominic about the perfect moment to leak this fake relationship. The citywide LED screens she'd booked for Nathan Blackwood's apology had drained her accounts. She'd make Xavier pay every cent back.

Her calculating gaze darted between the couple, already plotting her next move.

An icy presence beside her made others instinctively step back. Nathan's thunderous expression screamed "back off" louder than any words could.

"Darling! Where are you—" The studio doors burst open mid-sentence. "You can't go in there!" A harried assistant's protest was cut short as Tristan Whitmore stormed in, disheveled and desperate.

Spotting Vivian Lockwood, his tense shoulders sagged with relief. "Sweetheart, why are you doing this?" He approached with open arms. "Thinking of replacing me? I'll give you anything—"

Dominic recognized the disgraced heir and signaled for the crew to pause filming. Vivian's head snapped up at the intrusion, her expression hardening instantly.

"Get out."

Tristan's smile faltered but persisted. "You must be exhausted. Come home. From now on, you call all the shots—how's that?" He ignored the crew's shocked whispers. His humiliating wedding rejection had made headlines, yet here he was, groveling publicly.

Vivian's lips curled in bitter amusement. "Mr. Whitmore, we have no relationship. That's your house, not mine." The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

After a loaded silence, Tristan whispered, "Just one minute alone. Please."

Vivian opened her mouth to refuse when Nathan unexpectedly stood. "Take fifteen, everyone." His commanding tone brooked no argument.

The crew scattered instantly. Dominic rolled his eyes—since when was he invisible in his own studio?

Tristan shot Nathan a grateful look. Brotherhood prevailed.

Evelyn studied Nathan's retreating back. Always playing the noble mediator. She turned to Vivian with practiced concern. "Ms. Lockwood, need assistance?"

Tristan stiffened. After a brief hesitation, Vivian shook her head. "I'll handle this myself." She needed to end this farce once and for all.

As Evelyn exited, she instructed Bennett to reserve every digital billboard in the city. "Use the exact wording Nathan requested."

Bennett hesitated. "Must we really include...that phrase?" Even his professional demeanor cracked at the absurdity.

Evelyn sighed. "His ridiculous demand, not mine." The idea of Nathan's name alongside "heptane" made her skin crawl. Only drug-induced insanity could explain such a request.

"Understood," Bennett replied, already drafting the most embarrassing public declaration in corporate history.
###Chapter 621

No one had a clue what transpired between Tristan and Vivian.

Evelyn reached the hotel and dove straight into work.

The afternoon stretched long, but urgent matters demanded her attention. Conference calls consumed her time.

Two hours later, she finally hung up and stretched her stiff back.

Room service crossed her mind, but before she could dial, the doorbell chimed.

Simultaneously, her phone buzzed. Nathan's name flashed on the screen.

She hesitated before answering. "Mr. Blackwood, is there a problem?"

"Come downstairs." His voice was ice, devoid of emotion. "Now."

Her stomach dropped. She ended the call and rushed to the elevator.

Nathan had to be referring to the floor where the others were staying.

The moment the elevator doors opened, chaos greeted her. The hallway was packed, murmurs thick in the air. A woman's sobs cut through the noise.

Confusion twisted inside her. What the hell happened?

The crowd parted as she approached, whispers trailing in her wake.

Nathan stood rigid by the doorway, his expression stormy. The sheer intensity of his presence kept everyone at a distance.

His eyes locked onto hers. With a slight tilt of his head, he motioned for her to enter.

Her pulse spiked. Something was very wrong.

Inside, Dominic and the directors wore grim expressions. Dominic’s face was ashen, while the others huddled in tense discussion.

The crying grew louder.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Dominic stood abruptly, surprise flickering across his face.

Evelyn barely acknowledged him. Her gaze swept the room—and then she froze.

Holy shit.

Xavier Delmont and Seraphina Devereux.

Seraphina sat on the bed, her silk pajamas torn, her body marked with angry red scratches. She clutched the sheets, tears streaming down her face.

But the real shock was Xavier.

He was on the floor, shirtless, wearing only boxers. His face burned with humiliation and barely contained fury.

The scene screamed disaster.

Her mind raced. My golden goose just imploded.

Dominic stepped beside her, voice low. "Exactly what it looks like. Xavier forced his way into her room. She fought back, screamed. People heard."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. This would be a PR nightmare.

One of the directors muttered, "One of them has to go. We can't keep both."

Another nodded. "If this leaks, we're screwed."

"Xavier's under Kingsley’s agency," someone pointed out. "But if Seraphina presses charges..."

Evelyn closed her eyes. When she opened them, her voice was steel.

"Both of you—get dressed. Now."
###Chapter 622

Evelyn's voice cut through the air like ice.

Xavier shuddered, unable to meet her piercing gaze. She flicked her eyes toward the door, and someone immediately shut it behind them.

Nathan and Harrison stepped inside, curiosity burning in their expressions.

Seraphina emerged from the bedroom, hastily draping a robe over her shoulders. She didn’t flinch under the weight of their stares. Her voice was raw, hoarse from crying.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood," she said, her tone laced with defiance, "since you're all here, I might as well lay everything out."

Xavier, hearing this from inside the bedroom, stormed out, his face twisted in fury. "You were into it! You kept giving me signals—don’t pretend you weren’t interested! Everyone here can vouch for that!"

"Signals?" Seraphina scoffed, her eyes blazing. "Fine, I flirted with you—for the show. That’s it. Off-camera? Nothing. Not a single private moment between us."

She strode forward and slapped him hard across the face. "Does smiling at you mean I want you in my bed? You barged into my room in broad daylight and wouldn’t take no for an answer!"

Xavier’s face flushed crimson. His boyish charm twisted into something ugly as he struggled to breathe.

"Playing hard to get?" he spat.

Seraphina laughed coldly. "Look in the mirror. What part of you is worth a second glance? I’m divorced, but I’ve been in this industry long enough to know trash when I see it. My ex-husband had money. My ex-boyfriend had looks. You? You’re just some nobody trying to sleep his way up."

The words hit like bullets. Xavier’s expression darkened, humiliation burning through him in front of people who mattered.

"You—you’re unbelievable!"

Seraphina turned to Evelyn, tears streaking her face, but her chin stayed high. "Ms. Sinclair, we’re both women. You know how hard it is to survive in this world. Do I look like the kind of woman who’d throw herself at a broke, nameless model?"

Her meaning was clear. Xavier had been the one chasing her, hoping to ride her coattails to fame.

Evelyn’s gaze slid to Xavier, unimpressed. Idiot. He must’ve been dropped on his head as a child.

The show would go viral, but not the way he wanted. Now, he’d be lucky to escape with his career intact.

"Ms. Sinclair, it’s not what it looks like—" Xavier stammered.

Evelyn cut him off with a single icy glance. "Did you force yourself on her after she said no?"

The bruises on Seraphina’s arms spoke for themselves.

Xavier swallowed hard. Silence stretched before he finally muttered, "Yeah… No… Yeah…"
###Chapter 623

Xavier Delmont had assumed Seraphina Devereux's refusal was nothing more than a playful act.

When he entered her room, she showed no signs of discomfort.

Instead, she met his gaze with a suggestive smirk, responding eagerly to his advances. Their movements led them toward the bed, where his hands began to wander.

Then, without warning, Seraphina pretended to resist.

How could Xavier have known it wasn’t part of the game?

Before he could process her sudden shift, she kicked him off the bed with brutal force and screamed at the top of her lungs.

Within seconds, the entire floor came rushing to her door.

It was the most humiliating moment of Xavier’s life.

Stunned, he realized he’d been played—manipulated by a woman who knew exactly how to ruin him.

The injustice burned like acid in his chest.

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent, her expression unreadable. She glanced at Dominic Kingsley, who stood and delivered the final blow in a voice like ice.

"Given the circumstances, Xavier, we have no choice but to terminate your contract immediately."

Xavier’s blood ran cold.

"No—Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Sinclair—this wasn’t my fault!" His desperate eyes locked onto Evelyn, the woman he’d spent months flattering, hoping to secure her favor.

She was his last chance.

But Evelyn’s gaze was glacial, her lips curling in disgust. His pleas died in his throat.

Nathan Blackwood’s presence only deepened the dread. Xavier hadn’t forgotten his earlier warnings.

Defeated, he turned back to Dominic.

"Mr. Kingsley, I swear I’ll never—"

Dominic cut him off with a sharp gesture. He addressed Seraphina instead.

"Seraphina, our show has high expectations. Scandals like this benefit no one."

He paused, then added, "Arabella Winslow and Isadora Vanderbilt will be joining us soon. Working with them is a rare opportunity. I trust you won’t waste it."

Seraphina didn’t hesitate.

"Of course, Mr. Kingsley. I value this chance deeply."

Her voice was smooth, calculated.

"As long as Xavier is removed, I’ll cooperate fully with damage control. No further disruptions."

She knew the game. Reputation was everything in this industry.

Crushing Xavier was easy. But securing her place? That was priceless.

Dominic smirked, glancing at Evelyn for confirmation.

She gave a slight nod.

This was the cleanest solution—cutting Xavier loose, keeping Seraphina, and silencing the scandal before it spread.

No one would defend him.

Xavier’s face drained of color.

Panic clawed at his throat. "Mr. Kingsley, please—I’ll do anything!"

He turned to the director, who merely shrugged. "I see nothing."

Desperation made him reckless. He lunged toward Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair, you brought me into this world—you can’t abandon me now!"

Her response was a venomous slap of words.

"Did I tell you to grovel at women’s feet? Pathetic."

She turned on her heel and strode out.

Xavier tried to grab her arm—

A sharp crack echoed as his wrist was twisted back, bone snapping under the force of an unseen hand.

Agony exploded through him.

Mercy wasn’t an option anymore.
###Chapter 624

Xavier let out a piercing scream, writhing in agony.

Nathan stood motionless, his expression unreadable as he dusted off his hands with deliberate precision. He pulled out a handkerchief, wiping his fingers clean before tossing it aside with disdain.

His gaze was icy, devoid of any warmth.

The sight of Xavier’s hands had disgusted him.

Once Evelyn left, the remaining guests exchanged uneasy glances.

No one dared to speak, but satisfaction flickered in their eyes. Xavier had gotten exactly what he deserved.

They assumed Nathan was avenging Seraphina, which only solidified their loyalty.

Dominic stepped forward, offering Xavier a polite but hollow consolation.

One by one, the guests departed.

Nathan spared Xavier—still curled on the floor—a final glance before turning away with a cold scoff.

Pathetic. To think I ever considered him competition.

Just as Nathan was about to leave, Seraphina called out to him.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

She hesitated, her earlier vulnerability gone. Now, she stood composed, almost amused.

Xavier gaped at them, realization dawning.

They know each other?

Nathan’s expression remained indifferent, but the faintest hint of approval flickered at the corner of his lips.

"Well done."

His tone was clipped. "Tell Harrison what resources you need."

With that, he strode out without another word.

Xavier’s eyes widened in shock.

Seraphina, however, laughed softly.

With Nathan’s backing, her status in the industry was now untouchable.

All she had done was shoo away a nuisance bothering Evelyn.

Compared to the others who had shamelessly thrown themselves at Nathan and been humiliated, she had come out on top.

Her gaze flicked to Xavier, still sprawled on the floor.

A slow, mocking smile curved her lips.

"Poor boy. You’re in over your head."

She tilted her head, voice dripping with condescension. "Someone like Ms. Sinclair? She’s favored by fate itself. You were never worthy of standing near her."

Xavier’s breath hitched.

Evelyn Sinclair.

This had all been a setup.

Fury burned through him.

Back in her room, Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Xavier had been a disappointment. A golden opportunity—wasted by his own stupidity.

Her phone buzzed.

Bennett’s voice came through. "Ms. Sinclair, there’s an urgent meeting. Should I arrange a replacement?"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "I’ll handle it myself."

She couldn’t stay in this show any longer.

In less than two days, the original cast had been completely upended.

The entertainment industry is exhausting.

She was done.

The moment Evelyn left, Nathan received the update.

His tense shoulders relaxed slightly.

"Harrison."

His assistant straightened. "Back to the office, sir?"

Nathan adjusted his suit jacket, the epitome of cold elegance.

"Yes."

Harrison nearly sighed in relief.

Finally.

While this trip hadn’t been disastrous, the emotional toll on him had been immense.

If not for the obscene salary Nathan paid, he would’ve quit days ago.

Just before they left the hotel, Nathan paused.

"One more thing."

His voice was chillingly calm. "Make sure that counterfeit gets a new face."

The mere memory of Xavier’s imitation was revolting.

"If he refuses, disfigure him instead."

Nathan’s tone left no room for argument. He never wanted to see that imposter again.

Harrison nodded.

"Understood."
###Chapter 625

Evelyn Sinclair flew directly to a neighboring city for an important meeting. Before leaving, she examined the situation and apologized to Vivian Lockwood. Then she instructed Dominic Kingsley to ensure the variety show would be produced flawlessly to promote Vivian's career.

The past two days had left Evelyn feeling nothing but irritation.

She would have preferred working overtime at the office—at least that would have brought tangible results.

"Rising star bullies Buddhist celebrity!"

Within two hours, the first wave of public outrage flooded social media.

"New actor, rumored to have debuted as a stand-in for a big-name star, acts recklessly on set!"

It was inevitable. Too many witnesses had seen what happened.

Evelyn had no time to deal with it, so she left it to Dominic. The backlash would take time to escalate, giving him ample opportunity to control the narrative.

Her plane landed at the neighboring city’s airport. Bennett handled the driver while Evelyn checked her phone. Suddenly, a shadow fell over her.

She looked up—Preston Sinclair stood before her, smiling.

Evelyn froze. "Mr. Sinclair? Shouldn’t you be in San Francisco?"

His smile was warm, almost affectionate. "I just returned from handling business overseas. I’m here for a meeting before heading back."

What a coincidence.

Evelyn nodded, amused. They were probably attending the same event.

"Let’s ride together." Preston gestured to the Bentley parked nearby. "We can catch up."

She hesitated.

Preston shrugged. "I could use your advice. I was invited to speak but haven’t prepared anything."

Evelyn glanced at Bennett. "Wait here. I’ll go ahead with Mr. Sinclair."

Bennett exhaled in relief. The driver was taking forever.

Once inside the car, Preston retrieved a small box and handed it to her.

Evelyn blinked. "What’s this?"

"A gift."

"For me?"

His eyes crinkled. "Yes. You and Oliver both have one."

The implication was clear—he valued her as much as his own son.

The box suddenly felt heavy in her hands. She didn’t even know how to refuse.

Preston nudged it toward her. "Open it first. Then decide."

Reluctantly, she lifted the lid.

Inside lay an oval-shaped piece of uncarved wood, reddish-brown with a delicate grain.

Preston chuckled. "I passed by Stanford—your alma mater. Graduates were taking photos, and a vendor was selling these. They claimed it came from a campus tree. Plant it, and it’ll grow."

A sentimental keepsake.

Evelyn’s expression turned complicated. She met his gaze. "Thank you, but… you were scammed."

Preston stiffened.

She bit her lip. "This wood is from a wholesale market nearby."

Silence.

The air grew thick with awkwardness.

Evelyn cleared her throat and tucked the box away. "But I do like it. It’s simple, unpretentious. They sell these every graduation season, but I never bought one. This is my first time receiving it."
###Chapter 626

Preston Sinclair gave a wry smile, the corner of his lips lifting slightly.

"Can't believe I fell for that scam. It's humiliating." For a Wall Street tycoon like him, the realization stung.

Evelyn Sinclair laughed, the sound lightening the tense atmosphere in the car.

She pulled out her iPad. "Let me brief you on the speech topic." This meeting was primarily a high-level market research exchange. Its significance lay not in the event itself, but in the influential attendees—people who could sway stock prices and reshape market dynamics.

A major project, one Sterling Enterprises had been developing for months, would be unveiled today.

Preston immediately shifted into serious mode, his expression focused yet composed. His refined demeanor carried an understated confidence, devoid of arrogance. Unlike Nathan Blackwood, Preston exuded a quiet charm—subtle, magnetic, but never aggressive.

At first, Evelyn did most of the talking. Soon, Preston joined in, their discussion measured and insightful. Both maintained cautious optimism about the project's potential.

Evelyn had declined the invitation to speak on stage. The recent chaos on her variety show set had left her too emotionally drained to trust her composure.

The car ride was smooth. Though Evelyn had visited this city before, she'd never had time to explore. Glancing out the window, she noted how much the skyline had changed.

Preston broke the silence. "How's Oliver settling in at Sterling Manor?"

Evelyn stiffened. Guilt pricked her—she'd been so preoccupied with filming that she'd barely checked on the boy she'd left in her father's care.

Before she could answer, Preston chuckled.

"Though from what I hear, Alexander Sterling adores him. When Oliver video-called me yesterday, he was teaching me how to fish. Sounded like a pro."

Evelyn grinned. "Dad probably sees a future angler in him." She just hoped Lucas wasn't corrupting the kid with his actor's antics.

Preston's eyes crinkled with amusement as the car stopped at the convention center entrance. He stepped out, opening Evelyn's door with effortless grace. She thanked him, and they walked in together.

Coincidentally, their seats were adjacent. The placard beside them bore Nathan Blackwood's name—but it was swiftly removed. Clearly, he had no intention of attending.

Evelyn exhaled. Good. One less complication.

Bennett arrived just in time to handle her hotel arrangements. His message pinged her phone:

[City-wide LED displays booked for one minute—$68 million. PR and media coordination complete.]

Evelyn smirked, typing back:

[Excellent. Make sure the follow-up is flawless.] If she was spending that kind of money, the impact had to be undeniable.

The conference began with opening remarks before passing the mic to industry leaders. Each speaker seized the opportunity to pitch their ventures, eager to attract investors and partnerships.

Some spoke with such fervor that spittle flew. The audience reacted variably—some attentive, others dismissive.

But Evelyn and Preston listened intently, occasionally exchanging quiet commentary. To onlookers, the aloof heiress of Sterling Enterprises and the elusive Wall Street prodigy appeared unexpectedly close.

Someone discreetly snapped photos of the pair.

Those photos would soon find their way to Nathan Blackwood.
###Chapter 627

Midway through the conference, Evelyn's phone buzzed relentlessly.

Xavier Delmont's messages flooded her screen.

She ignored them.

The texts kept coming.

[Ms. Sinclair, you have to believe me—]

[This is all a setup by Mr. Blackwood and Seraphina! They framed me!]

[Ms. Sinclair, I respect and admire you deeply.]

[From the moment I first saw you, I knew you were special. I approached you with nothing but sincerity.]

[Please, save me. My career can't end like this. I still have so much left to do.]

Evelyn skimmed the messages and felt bile rise in her throat.

Disgust coiled in her stomach.

How could I have been so blind?

Without hesitation, she blocked Xavier.

Then, she fired off a quick text to Dominic Kingsley.

[Tell Xavier to disappear. The farther, the better.]

She was done.

What she'd thought was a golden opportunity had turned into a disaster.

A complete waste of time and resources.

Applause erupted in the room as the next speaker was introduced.

Preston Sinclair stood, casting a glance at Evelyn.

His voice was low, just for her.

"My turn. If I stumble, feel free to jump in."

Evelyn gave him a subtle thumbs-up.

Preston took the stage, his presence commanding instant silence.

Tall, broad-shouldered, every movement exuding effortless grace.

His sharp intelligence was veiled behind a calm, composed demeanor—deceptively gentle until you caught the steel beneath.

"Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honor to be here today."

Evelyn watched, lips curving.

His speech was different.

Practical. Insightful.

While others had focused on corporate branding, Preston zeroed in on the AI project itself.

Most importantly, he addressed the recent European scandal head-on.

No evasion. Just facts.

"Artificial intelligence isn't just innovation—it's an invitation to reshape the future."

"We're still in the early stages, but progress is inevitable."

"The autonomous vehicle sector is just the beginning. What comes next will redefine industries."

The room erupted in applause.

Preston's gaze flickered to one spot in the audience.

Evelyn met his eyes.

For a heartbeat, something electric passed between them.

She looked away first, pulse unsteady.

Must be the adrenaline from the speech.

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Industries...

Nathan Blackwood was in a board meeting when his phone lit up.

Message after message.

His jaw tightened.

The executive presenting faltered.

"Continue," Nathan ordered, voice icy.

He checked his phone.

His expression darkened instantly.
###Chapter 628

The department head's complexion turned ghostly white. Sweat beaded on his forehead like morning dew.

His entire frame trembled visibly. The air in the conference room thickened instantly.

Other executives held their breath, fearing collateral damage. Nathan Blackwood had been in high spirits moments ago.

He'd even comforted this same department head about an earlier mistake. Encouraged him to improve.

Now his demeanor shifted like a storm rolling in. The change was abrupt, terrifying.

Was Nathan's mood swing too volatile? Or was this poor soul simply cursed with bad timing? Harrison stood frozen nearby.

He mentally lit a candle for the unfortunate project lead. Some fates couldn't be avoided.

Nathan's expression darkened like a winter sky before snowfall.

His glacial gaze swept across the room. The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees instantly.

"Preston Sinclair is with Evelyn now?!" The sweating department head wiped his brow nervously.

"Mr. Blackwood, during your absence... certain projects were temporarily paused..."

His voice faltered. "We weren't certain about allocating additional funds—"

Nathan slammed his phone on the mahogany table. The crack echoed like gunfire.

His eyes could have frozen hell itself. "Then what exactly do I pay you for?"

That icy stare lingered. "Submit a full report by end of day. Or clear your desk."

Without another glance, Nathan stormed out. Harrison scrambled after him, scooping up the abandoned phone.

"Sir—" Harrison extended the device cautiously. Nathan snatched it without breaking stride.

"I ordered you to monitor Evelyn." His voice could have cut diamonds. "How did Preston Sinclair slip through?"

Harrison blinked rapidly. "Ms. Sinclair's meeting was in Montevista. You declined the invitation personally."

"The agenda seemed unimportant then. Preston wasn't due back for three days according to—"

Realization dawned. Preston had returned early. Damn.

Preston Sinclair played the harmless bachelor well. But Wall Street knew his claws were sharp.

Tracking such a powerful figure wasn't simple.

Nathan's office door crashed open. "When does it end?"

"The conference concludes this afternoon. Ms. Sinclair should return by evening—"

"Should?" Nathan's glare could have melted steel. Harrison's shoulders hunched instinctively.

"It's too late for you to intercept them now." He swallowed hard. "Your afternoon schedule is packed with—"

"Get out." The command came like a guillotine drop.

Harrison retreated hastily. The door clicked shut behind him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn walked alone through twilight streets. Bennett remained swamped in San Francisco.

She had no companions in this unfamiliar city. The sky deepened from sapphire to indigo, then black.

A crisp breeze stirred fallen leaves around her ankles. She cut through a pocket park toward the shopping district.

Spotting a luxury boutique, she entered on impulse. The weight of shopping bags soon warmed her hands.

Dressed casually with a baseball cap, she moved unrecognized. But her spending habits turned heads.

Store attendants gaped as she selected items without glancing at price tags. They tripped over themselves to assist.

Purchases piled up. She arranged direct shipping to Nathan's penthouse.

Her mood lifted momentarily. Then Preston's face flashed in her mind.

Nathan's calm shattered again. The thought of Evelyn with that silver-tongued shark made his skin crawl.

It was intolerable. His jaw clenched tight enough to crack teeth.

Preston was more dangerous than Xavier Delmont. But every man had weaknesses.

No one takes Evelyn from me. The vow burned in his chest.

Evelyn opted against returning to San Francisco that night. The hotel provided sanctuary.

She couldn't face another grand gesture on public screens. That ridiculous demand still mortified her.

Dressed down in jeans and a cap, she wandered the shopping district solo.

Receipts overflowed her pockets as she exited another store. Then froze.

Black-suited security formed a perimeter ahead. The sight triggered a memory—summer sunlight, laughter.

Happiness so intense it hurt. Life glowing golden at its edges.

The moment passed. Her smile faded. How long since she'd felt such lightness?

Looking back, true joy seemed foreign. Since falling for Nathan, every bright moment came tinged with shadows.

Nathan Blackwood was her personal curse. The man beside her withdrew his hands gracefully.

Evelyn glanced sideways. Preston's pianist fingers were unfairly elegant. No wonder he played so well.

Natural advantage indeed. "Ms. Sinclair, you'll forgive my amateur skills?" His self-deprecating tone held mischief.
###Chapter 629

Evelyn Sinclair froze.

Her body tensed, instinctively bracing for confrontation.

But the group of black-clad bodyguards rushed past her without a second glance.

A relieved breath escaped her lips. Not their target. Good.

Exhaustion tugged at her limbs. Spotting a nearly empty rest area ahead, she headed toward it. An elegant grand piano stood at its center, gleaming under the soft lighting.

She settled onto the bench, fingers hovering over the keys. A few experimental notes rang out—clear, bright, perfect.

Without thinking, her hands moved into a familiar melody. Kikujiro’s Summer. The cheerful, carefree tune matched her mood—lighthearted after hours of indulgent shopping.

It had been so long since she’d felt this unburdened.

Lost in the music, she barely registered the presence beside her until another pair of hands joined hers on the keys. The new chords wove seamlessly into her own, enhancing the playful rhythm.

Startled, she glanced sideways.

Gregory Thornton.

His warm smile met hers, fingers never faltering as they danced across the piano.

They played in perfect sync, as if they’d rehearsed this duet a thousand times. The lively melody flowed effortlessly between them, light and joyful, drawing smiles from the few onlookers nearby.

Evelyn laughed softly when they finished.

Gregory exhaled, grinning. "Hope I didn’t ruin your performance."

She arched a brow. "Ruin it? Your improvisation was brilliant. If anything, I should be embarrassed."

Few would dare jump into an unrehearsed duet. Their chemistry had been effortless.

"I’ve always loved this song," he admitted. "It’s impossible to feel stressed while playing it."

Evelyn nodded. "True." Then, noticing the growing crowd, she lowered her voice. "We should go. People are staring."

What had been a quiet corner was now uncomfortably crowded. And the more eyes on them, the higher the chance someone would recognize her.
###Chapter 630

The mall's general manager beamed at them with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair remained impassive, their expressions cool and collected. The manager didn't seem the least bit deterred by their lack of reaction.

"You two are today's lucky couple!" he announced, grinning. "This is the grand finale of our mall's anniversary event, and your performance on that ten-million-dollar grand piano was nothing short of spectacular!"

The manager had already sized them up—these weren't ordinary shoppers. The man's wristwatch alone could buy a penthouse in Manhattan.

Though the woman was dressed simply, her handbag was a rare limited edition worth seven figures. These were high rollers, and he wasn't about to let them slip away unnoticed.

Evelyn arched a brow but said nothing. Preston caught her silent cue and stood, retrieving her bag from the bench. "We should go."

They intended to leave quietly, but as they turned, a well-dressed man flanked by four security guards blocked their path.

He smiled like he'd been waiting for them.

"Good evening," the man greeted smoothly. "I'm the general manager of this mall, and it's an honor to witness such breathtaking talent."

Evelyn gave a polite nod. "Thank you."

The manager's eyes gleamed. "Are you two together?"

A beat of silence.

Neither confirmed nor denied it.

The manager chuckled knowingly. "You look perfect together, and your chemistry on that piano was undeniable. You must be a couple!"

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Preston cleared his throat. "Was there something you needed?"

The manager gestured grandly. "As today's winners, you're entitled to an exclusive prize—one of the most generous offers we've ever given!"

Preston smirked. "Mr. Blackwood certainly spares no expense. Maybe we should encourage more of these events."

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "Typical Blackwood Industries extravagance."

The manager's smile faltered. Wait—do they know Nathan Blackwood, the CEO? His stomach dropped.

Too late for regrets now.

Evelyn reached into her pocket and pulled out a thick stack of receipts. "Here."

The manager's face paled as he took them with trembling hands.

The sheer volume alone was staggering. Then he saw the total.

His vision blurred.

The smallest purchase was $600,000. The combined sum? A staggering $50 million.

This woman—dressed like she shopped at a thrift store—had dropped fifty million dollars in a few hours?

His chest tightened. His career was over.

Preston smirked.

The manager forced a smile. "As our grand prize, everything you've purchased today will be fully reimbursed!"

He glanced pointedly at their empty hands. "Though it seems you haven't shopped yet. What a shame—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Everything?"

"Absolutely! Our mall is owned by Blackwood Industries. We don't make empty promises."

At the mention of Blackwood Industries, Evelyn's lips curled.

"Oh?" Her tone shifted. "In that case, I wouldn't want to miss out."

If it was Nathan's money, she had no qualms about spending it.

The manager beamed. "So? What would you like?"

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Let's start with everything."
###Chapter 631

The mall manager hesitated. Why was Preston Sinclair so determined to give this prize to a woman who'd tried refusing it earlier? His throat went dry as if walking toward his own execution.

"$50 million isn't small change," he croaked, licking his lips. "I'll need to consult with upper management—"

Evelyn Sinclair blinked slowly. "Aren't you the general manager? Can't make executive decisions?" She reached for her phone. "Shall I call your CEO instead?"

"Wait!" The manager's voice cracked. "Of course I can authorize this. Please provide your bank details, Miss Sinclair. The transfer will be completed within the hour."

His hands trembled as he processed the transaction. With Nathan Blackwood's men watching, refusing the prize would cost him his career.

Evelyn's smile never wavered as she handed over her information. "Thank you. This prize is... unexpectedly delightful."

The manager swore internally—never again would he organize such disastrous promotions.

Preston observed Evelyn's radiant expression as they exited. "Had your shopping delivered to the hotel?" Even he seemed impressed by her retail stamina.

"It should be waiting." Evelyn smirked. "Wonder how Mr. Blackwood will react."

She paused near a café. "Honestly, how does Blackwood Industries employ such incompetent people? That manager practically begged to be fired."

At precisely 8:00 PM, Bennett's message arrived—a photo of San Francisco's skyline illuminated with Nathan's demanded declaration: "Evelyn Sinclair thanks Nathan Blackwood, the most extraordinary man alive!"

The café's warm latte soothed her throat as she watched the citywide display. For sixty suspended seconds, every digital billboard broadcast her reluctant gratitude.

Across town in Blackwood Industries' tower, Nathan gazed through floor-to-ceiling windows. The moment the message flashed across downtown, tension melted from his shoulders.

Harrison exhaled in relief—his boss had been counting down to this moment all day.

"She does care," Nathan murmured, swirling merlot. His sharp profile softened under the golden light. "Before, my words meant nothing. Now she complies. That's progress."

Harrison bit his tongue. Since when did forced public declarations equal affection? But the dangerous glint in Nathan's eyes silenced any objections.
###Chapter 632

Harrison's lips twitched as he studied Nathan's expression. The words nearly slipped out—"Mr. Blackwood, you're overthinking this."

Based on his understanding of Evelyn Sinclair, she'd rather throw money at a problem than deal with unnecessary complications.

He opened his mouth, then shut it again. Better to agree. The boss was always right.

His phone buzzed with an urgent message from the manager of San Francisco's most exclusive shopping center.

Help! Look what I just walked into—

Attached were two photos and a video. The first showed a receipt signed Evelyn Sinclair with her account details. The second captured Evelyn standing beside a man whose back was turned. The video? A fifteen-second clip of them playing a duet on a grand piano.

Harrison's stomach dropped.

Please don't let that be THE Evelyn Sinclair—the one our CEO can't stop obsessing over.

The caption confirmed his worst fear: Just won the couples' jackpot—$50 million. My quarterly bonus is officially doomed.

The man beside her? Preston Sinclair.

Wall Street's most notorious playboy.

Harrison's gaze flicked to Nathan, who stood motionless by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Dread coiled in his chest.

This is bad.

Nathan's phone pinged. Harrison watched as his CEO scrolled through a flood of notifications—some public social media posts tagging Evelyn and Preston, others private messages sent directly to Nathan.

One stood out: a glittering skyline photo of San Francisco with Thank you emblazoned across it in bold gold letters.

Nathan typed a reply. Did you use Evelyn's name for this, Ferg?

The response came instantly. Haha.

Nathan's fingers moved again. Congratulations. Motherhood suits you.

Harrison blinked. Was that... gratitude?

Since when did Nathan Blackwood acknowledge anyone's existence, let less respond with something resembling humor?

The CEO continued replying to every message with uncharacteristic patience.

Harrison exhaled slowly.

This isn't just bad.

This is a Category 5 hurricane about to make landfall.
###Chapter 633

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for a long moment when Tristan Whitmore called.

His voice came out low and hollow. "Preston... How did you manage it? Evelyn actually thanked you publicly. Are you two back together?"

Preston Sinclair chuckled darkly. "Soon."

"Teach me," Tristan sighed heavily. "My wife—no, my ex-wife—has completely blocked me!"

Nathan scoffed. "Congratulations. Now you can find someone new." He ended the call abruptly. Nathan still harbored resentment toward Tristan's ex-wife Vivian for advising Evelyn to move on.

To Nathan, Vivian Lockwood was nothing but trouble.

Harrison hesitated before speaking up. "Mr. Blackwood..." Though he hated to ruin Nathan's mood, keeping silent would be worse when the truth inevitably surfaced.

Nathan turned sharply. Harrison handed over his phone with the damning social media posts. It took Nathan three full minutes to read everything.

He sipped his wine, his gaze turning glacial. The eerie calm made Harrison's palms sweat. Nathan's controlled demeanor always preceded explosive rage.

When Harrison dared to meet Nathan's eyes, he saw barely restrained fury simmering beneath. The cold intensity in Nathan's frown sent chills down Harrison's spine.

Nathan was livid. Evelyn and Gregory Thornton appearing as a couple at the mall. Singing a duet together. Winning the grand prize—a prize Nathan himself had sponsored.

The irony tasted like ash in his mouth. Darkness enveloped Nathan, his aura turning so frigid it could freeze hell over.

Exactly sixty seconds later, every LED screen in the neighboring city switched displays simultaneously. Evelyn finally exhaled in relief.

Across the table, Gregory raised an eyebrow at the social media frenzy. "Now you see why I avoid going back?" His words hung heavily between them.

Evelyn froze. Before the divorce, she'd often wondered—if someone else had saved her that night, would her life have been different? Would she have ever met Nathan at all?

Her fingers traced the rim of her glass. "I don't dwell on what-ifs. And I never regret my choices." That wasn't Evelyn's style. Even when she made mistakes, she pushed forward relentlessly.

Would she deny her past feelings for Nathan? Never. He had saved her multiple times. That chapter of her life remained precious, regardless of how it ended.

Gregory seemed surprised by her answer. He'd expected regret, but this unshakable resolve was so quintessentially Evelyn.

"Mr. Blackwood seems determined to win you back. Your actions tonight gave him false hope," Gregory observed bluntly.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "Mr. Thornton, you seem unusually invested."

"As one of your suitors, of course I am." His directness made her pulse stutter.

After a beat, Evelyn smiled wryly. "Perhaps I've given you the wrong impression. I'm not looking for any relationships."

"Same rejection as last time." Gregory's eyes crinkled as he leaned closer. "Relax, I'm here as a friend. No pressure."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Good. Because getting rich together is what really matters." Money never betrayed her like love had.

Gregory arched a brow. "Is that why you're entertaining Mr. Blackwood's advances?"

Evelyn chuckled without humor. "Exactly. What grudge can't be settled with enough zeros? Mr. Blackwood loves grand gestures—tonight's prize money more than covered my 'gratitude' with interest."

Had the mall manager recognized her, she might've suspected Nathan orchestrated the whole thing. Gregory burst out laughing at her shameless materialism.

Financially, few women could rival Evelyn. Yet her obsession with wealth bordered on comical. This unapologetic side of her was oddly endearing—and gave Gregory hope that Nathan stood no real chance.

Their conversation flowed easily between bites. Evelyn intermittently replied to the flood of concerned messages. The elite circle had certainly noticed that "rare minute" of public vulnerability.

She selectively responded to important contacts, then sent a detailed explanation to her father.

[William Sterling: Hmph! The man loves his theatrics!
[Evelyn Sterling: Already handled the fallout. Don't worry, Dad.]
###Chapter 634

The silver moonlight draped over the city like a delicate veil. Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair finished their lattes at the midnight café and strolled back toward The Grandeur along the cobblestone path.

Evelyn assumed Preston was merely being chivalrous by escorting her to the hotel. But when they reached her suite, the Wall Street tycoon showed no signs of departing.

Her eyebrows arched when he produced a keycard from his tailored suit pocket. "You're staying across the hall?" The realization dawned that their shared hotel wasn't coincidence - he'd simply been walking her to his own destination.

Preston's lips curved as he watched her unlock her door. "Goodnight, Evelyn."

"Sweet dreams," she murmured before slipping inside. Leaning against the closed door, she exhaled sharply before texting Bennett and preparing for bed.

Evelyn always powered off her phone before sleeping - a strict rule against midnight disturbances. The tranquil moonlight faded into dawn when her alarm chimed. Freshly showered, she answered the door to find Bennett holding two designer garment bags.

"Madam President, the car's waiting downstairs." His crisp tone matched his pressed suit.

Evelyn accepted the bags with a nod. One contained Ferguson Corporation's latest casual-chic ensemble - not their flagship line but perfect for today's agenda. The white silk blouse would accentuate her delicate collarbones while the tailored slacks projected effortless sophistication.

The second bag held Sterling Enterprises' unreleased "Aether" jewelry collection - lightweight luxury pieces destined to cause a media frenzy. Since last night's spectacle had already spent her social capital, Evelyn intended to maximize the return on investment.

The ensemble came together flawlessly. Minimal makeup highlighted her striking features while the jewelry added subtle sparkle. The look balanced elegance with youthful vibrance - no forced poise required when one was born into high society.

Bennett did a double take. "If you weren't running Sterling Enterprises, Hollywood would be fighting to cast you." His rare compliment drew a smirk.

Their strategy session had covered today's media play perfectly. Though last night's LED spectacle had limited official coverage, the rumor mill churned relentlessly. Rather than let speculation distort reality, they'd control the narrative.

Why pay publicists when hungry reporters would swarm freely? The black sedan pulled up to Sterling Tower's gleaming entrance, where a gaggle of journalists already clustered.

Evelyn's security detail formed a protective perimeter as Bennett glanced at his watch. "Mr. Sinclair left earlier - seemed urgent."

She shrugged. "His business isn't mine." The unspoken understanding hung between them - some doors stayed closed.

Bennett exited first, scanning the crowd before opening Evelyn's door. A hundred camera flashes erupted as she stepped onto the pavement, every inch the Sterling heiress reclaiming her spotlight.
###Chapter 635

Evelyn stepped out of the car with effortless grace. She had anticipated the swarm of reporters and came fully prepared. A faint smile played on her lips as she followed her bodyguard toward the lobby of Sterling Enterprises.

The journalists weren’t about to let this opportunity slip. Questions flew at her like arrows.

"Ms. Sinclair, was last night’s city-wide light display your way of confessing to Mr. Blackwood? Are the two of you reconciling?"

"Ms. Sinclair, could you explain the meaning behind the phrase, 'Evelyn Sinclair would like to thank Nathan Blackwood'?"

"Were you with Mr. Blackwood last night?"

"How much did last night’s event cost?"

Evelyn maintained her composed smile.

Her hair was loosely tied back, revealing delicate, understated yet exquisitely expensive earrings. Every subtle movement showcased the jewelry she wore, as if she were modeling it effortlessly.

Just when the crowd assumed she wouldn’t respond, she paused at the entrance and turned to face them. The air stilled.

Cameras flashed.

Evelyn’s gaze swept over them, cool and regal. Then, with a light, polished smile, she spoke.

"Regardless of my personal relationship with Mr. Blackwood, rest assured—Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Industries have reached unprecedented levels of collaboration."

Her voice was steady, commanding attention.

"We are committed to tackling unemployment by providing platforms for entrepreneurship. Innovation and cooperation will remain our priorities."

Her words masterfully redirected the narrative from scandal to business.

The reporters were momentarily stunned.

Evelyn gave a polite nod and turned to leave. The bodyguards remained to usher the press away.

Within minutes, the video was online.

Evelyn’s outfit became the focal point—her crisp white shirt, a new release from Blackwood Industries, paired with a sleek skirt that accentuated her figure. The ensemble was effortlessly chic, neither overdone nor understated.

The jewelry she wore? All unreleased pieces from Sterling Enterprises’ upcoming collection.

The realization hit the public like a wave.

This wasn’t a romantic spectacle—it was a marketing masterstroke.

Comments flooded in.

[I knew it! This was just a product launch!]

[Evelyn Sinclair is a genius. Who else could turn a media frenzy into a business opportunity?]

[That outfit is perfection. Pre-ordering the jewelry NOW.]

[Nathan Blackwood is impressive, but he’s not on Evelyn’s level.]

Evelyn had played the game flawlessly.

And the world was watching.
###Chapter 636

The pre-orders for Sterling Enterprises' latest jewelry collection shattered all expectations, surpassing projected sales and setting new industry records.

Blackwood Industries' fashion line simultaneously sold out across every major retail channel worldwide. Stocks for both corporations skyrocketed at unprecedented rates within twenty-four hours. A flawless victory.

Evelyn Sinclair leaned back in her office chair, spinning lazily as her phone buzzed incessantly on the desk. The admiration pouring in was overwhelming.

Bennett Sterling knocked before entering. "The press has cleared out. We've finalized arrangements with all media platforms."

Evelyn nodded. "Double-check inventory levels. Quality control remains our top priority. If supplies run low, pause pre-orders immediately."

Bennett's expression remained professional. "Understood."

Evelyn stretched her legs onto the desk, fingers drumming against the polished surface. "Any updates from Blackwood Industries?"

"Not yet—" Bennett's reply was interrupted by sharp rapping at the door.

Before Evelyn could respond, the door swung open. Her eyes narrowed at the intrusion. Who dared enter without permission?

Alexander Sterling stepped inside first, his brow furrowing at Evelyn's casual posture. He cleared his throat pointedly. "We have company."

Evelyn barely had time to lower her legs when Nathan Blackwood strode in, his polished Oxfords clicking against the marble floor.

His piercing gaze took in Evelyn's relaxed position, then flicked to Bennett standing opposite her. A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw.

Bennett stiffened under the unexpected scrutiny, bewildered by the sudden hostility radiating from Blackwood.

Evelyn smoothly adjusted into a more professional stance. "Mr. Blackwood, what an unexpected visit. No advance notice?"

Nathan's voice dripped ice. "Had I announced my arrival, I suspect I'd find this office empty."

Evelyn's lips twitched. The man wasn't wrong. "Nonsense. You're always welcome here."

Alexander interjected, "We crossed paths in the lobby after my meeting. Thought we'd come up together."

Evelyn shot her brother a look that screamed traitor. Couldn't he sense the tension thickening the air?

"Lunch?" Alexander suggested brightly.

"Perfect," Nathan agreed before Evelyn could object.

Trapped, Evelyn reminded herself she'd done nothing wrong. She'd single-handedly boosted Blackwood Industries' market value. If anything, Nathan owed her gratitude.

They opted for Sterling Enterprises' private executive dining room to avoid public scrutiny. Evelyn instructed Bennett to arrange their meal, leaving the three in increasingly uncomfortable silence.

Nathan's stormy eyes bored into Evelyn, who resisted the urge to fidget. What was his problem?

She broke the silence first. "Mr. Blackwood, I've fulfilled every request. Your company's valuation has never been higher. Surely you're satisfied?"

Alexander choked back laughter. His sister's bluntness was legendary.

Nathan's attention snapped to Alexander briefly before returning to Evelyn. His voice dropped dangerously low. "Are you suggesting I should thank you?"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "No need for formalities between partners."

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his water glass. "Did Preston Sinclair put you up to this?"
###Chapter 637

Nathan's eyes darkened, his expression turning dangerously stormy.

"Happy now?" His words carried an edge, meant to deepen the tangled web between them.

The best outcome would be their lives so hopelessly intertwined that neither could escape.

Yet Evelyn had the audacity to lay everything out plainly. The weight in his chest grew unbearable.

The memory of her piano duet with Preston Sinclair last night—winning that ridiculous prize—ignited a fire he couldn't suppress.

Nathan Blackwood, a man who always played the long game, found himself questioning, What did I even gain from this?

Evelyn's lips curved, revealing those faint dimples and a hint of smug satisfaction. "Even in moments like these, I never forget the golden rule—profit shared is profit multiplied."

She tilted her head. "Your Blackwood Industries stock surged beautifully this quarter. Those sales figures? You're welcome."

Her smile faded as she met his gaze. Her voice turned icy. "Leave others out of this. Just say thank you."

"You're defending him?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low.

"I don't need to. Facts speak for themselves." Evelyn crossed her arms, her stance unyielding.

Nathan's pupils constricted.

She was dismissing their history outright. Snatching his phone, he pulled up the video and slammed it onto the table. "You played quite the performance. When do I get my private concert?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

Ah. So that was the root of his tantrum.

She laughed, the sound so bright it momentarily disarmed him. "Mr. Blackwood, are you... jealous? How absurd."

Her amusement only fueled his irritation. "When you remarry, I'll gladly perform at your wedding."

Alexander Sterling shot Nathan a warning look. "Control yourself. We're having a civilized discussion."

No one raises their voice at my sister in my presence.

Alexander glanced at the video. "What inspired this sudden piano recital?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Just happened to run into Mr. Sinclair. Perfect timing, really." Her tone was deliberately casual. "Oh, and Nathan? That grand prize of yours was excessively generous. Waiving my shopping bill? Unexpected, but appreciated."

Alexander's brows shot up. "Waived bill?"

Evelyn smirked. "Naturally. Who'd pass up a shopping spree like that?" She turned back to Nathan. "Unless you'd prefer I return the favor?"

His jaw clenched. "So this fake relationship was just a scheme for free shopping?"

"Fifty million dollars' worth," Evelyn confirmed sweetly.

Alexander choked on his coffee.

Nathan stood abruptly, his entire frame radiating fury. The air around him turned glacial.

"Evelyn." Her name was a growl, raw and ragged.

She met his burning gaze with infuriating calm.

Alexander stepped between them. "Nathan. Sit. Down."

Not in my house.

The unspoken threat hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 638 
Nathan knew Evelyn must be trying to drain Preston dry with this opportunity.

He glanced at Preston and said coolly, "Mr. Sinclair, I'll transfer you the money later."

Evelyn froze.

Preston's brows furrowed. "Unnecessary. Since it's an event, fairness should prevail."

Alexander frowned, wanting to point out Evelyn and Preston weren't a couple and thus ineligible.

But Preston lowered his gaze with a dark chuckle.

His voice turned dangerously smooth. "Besides, I should be covering her bills."

Preston had been praying for this chance.

Both Evelyn and Alexander fell silent.

Just then, Bennett entered with dishes tailored to the three executives' preferences.

Mid-meal, Evelyn excused herself for an urgent call.

Left alone, Preston and Alexander exchanged tense stares. Neither had much appetite facing the other, yet courtesy kept them seated until their plates were clean. Both maintained perfect civility despite the tension.

Alexander broke the silence first. "Mr. Sinclair, you seem particularly hostile toward Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston dabbed his mouth with deliberate elegance.

"There are always flies buzzing around Evelyn with ill intentions. Someone has to keep watch."

'And swat them when necessary,' Preston thought.

Alexander chuckled inwardly. 'Straight to the point.'

"My sister's beautiful, wealthy, and brilliant. Naturally, she attracts admirers."

Pride colored Alexander's voice as he emphasized their sibling bond.

Preston's eyes darkened, lips curling into a frosty smile.

"Exactly why she needs guarding."

Alexander's smile stiffened. 'He wants to stand guard? Until every suitor flees?'

"Of course. Given our companies' unprecedented collaboration, we should look out for each other."

The meal dragged on awkwardly, though both men had endured worse social tortures.

Had Alexander not been his brother-in-law, Preston would've walked out long ago.

Afterward, Alexander politely escorted Preston out without a single misstep.

"Mr. Sinclair, we should play golf sometime."

The invitation was pure formality.

Preston paused. "Certainly... Big Brother."

Alexander's face twitched before forcing a laugh. "Since you call me that, remember Evelyn's your sister too. Bear with her if she ever offends you."

Preston choked. His smile turned strained.

Alexander waved. "Goodbye."

——

Inside his car, Preston's driver studied his expression carefully.

"Back to the office, Mr. Blackwood?"

Preston closed his eyes with a terse "Mm."

An ill-timed call interrupted.

Preston answered without checking ID.

Tristan's sympathetic yet amused voice made Preston itch to punch him.

"Still not reconciled, huh? 'Unprecedented cooperation'? Evelyn's a genius—saved millions in endorsements and marketing. Think she'd model our products too?"

Preston's expression blackened. He wiped his lips. "Seeking death?"

Through the phone, Tristan could visualize Preston's thunderous face.

He hastily backtracked.

"Women are impossible. Vivian promised to marry me, now she's blocked me. How's that fair?"

Preston hung up mid-rant.

After a moment, he dialed an international number, voice turning lethally calm.

"Compile a full report on Preston Sinclair's current projects."

###Chapter 639 

Evelyn Sinclair had just wrapped up an urgent business matter when her phone buzzed. Lucas Sterling's name flashed on the screen.

She sighed but answered. Lucas might be carefree in daily life, but when it came to his acting career, he was ruthlessly professional.

"Get here now," his voice crackled through the line. No pleasantries.

Evelyn arrived at the film set to find chaos. Crew members scrambled while Lucas stood in the center, grinning like a mischievous schoolboy. He spotted her and waved enthusiastically.

Her jaw tightened.

Seeing her stormy expression, Lucas abandoned his post immediately. "Linn! Brought your favorite takeout!" He held up a greasy paper bag like a peace offering.

Evelyn's hands clenched. "Takeout?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I canceled dinner with Alexander for this?"

Lucas had the decency to look sheepish. "Don't tell Dad."

"Last time Dad sprained his back disciplining you," Evelyn hissed. "He still can't play golf."

Lucas leaned closer. "Natalie's visiting. Let her stay. I'll cook for you both." His hopeful expression made Evelyn roll her eyes.

"So this is about impressing a woman?"

Lucas flushed but didn't deny it.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Natalie's my best friend. I won't feed her to the wolves." She'd rather see Natalie with someone stable—anyone but her reckless brother.

Lucas pouted. "Whose side are you on?"

"Ask Dad," Evelyn shot back.

Their bickering halted when Natalie emerged with a group from the dressing rooms. "Evelyn!" Natalie's face lit up.

Evelyn linked arms with her friend. "What brings you here?"

"Work assignment," Natalie said. "When Lucas claimed you'd come, I didn't believe him."

Lucas flashed his signature charming grin. "Let me showcase my culinary skills, ladies."

Evelyn bit back a sarcastic remark about his microwave expertise. For Natalie's sake, she played along.

Natalie hesitated. "Mind if Adrian joins us?"

"Of course not," Evelyn said smoothly.

Lucas's smile faltered.

His apartment near the set reflected his perfectionism—impeccably clean despite his sporadic stays. The four of them entered, tension thickening the air.

While Lucas busied himself in the kitchen, Evelyn nudged Natalie. "Doesn't he look dashing when he cooks?"

Natalie's cheeks pinked.

Evelyn hid a smirk. Maybe this matchmaking scheme had potential after all.
###Chapter 640 

Lucas Sterling was the kind of man who made perfection look effortless.

Hardworking. Refined. A pedigree that could silence any critic.

Even the way he handled a steak knife was mesmerizing—graceful, precise, like he'd been trained by royalty.

Natalie Beaumont blinked, caught off guard. Then she smirked. "Lucas has always been the most beautiful man I've ever seen."

Evelyn Sinclair felt the weight behind those words. There was something raw in Natalie's voice, something tied to Lucas.

And Roman? Just a prop. A shield.

Evelyn tilted her head. "How did you meet Tristan Whitmore's ex-wife, anyway?"

That disastrous wedding reception had left her curious.

Natalie shrugged. "She used to attend events as his wife. People ignored her—Tristan never cared enough to change that. I felt bad. We ended up talking."

Evelyn nodded. "Makes sense."

"She's pitiful," Natalie admitted. Then, softer: "I know you mean well, promoting her firm. But be careful. If this backfires—"

Evelyn smiled.

Only a real friend would say that.

The kitchen door swung open. Lucas emerged, carrying a platter of grilled steak.

Broad shoulders. Sharp jawline. Arms that could double as sculpture.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "My brother’s face is a crime against women. Why couldn’t he be a bald, two-hundred-pound mess?"

Natalie burst out laughing.

Lucas shot Evelyn a glare and tossed his apron aside. "Disappointed I wasn’t born ugly?"

Evelyn grinned. "Jules, his steak is worth the ego."

Natalie moved to the table.

Lucas pulled out her chair before she could touch it.

Evelyn yanked her own seat out. This is how he treats his sister?

Lucas sat beside Natalie, slicing her steak with the precision of a surgeon.

Roman, seated next to Evelyn, coughed awkwardly. "Need help with yours?"

Evelyn waved him off. "I’ve got it."

Lucas gave her a look but still swapped plates with her, his movements smooth.

Dinner was laughter and wine. Lucas refilled Natalie’s glass, nudged side dishes toward her, asked if she liked the seasoning.

When the plates were cleared, Evelyn leaned in.

"Jules," she whispered. "Is my brother courting you?"

Natalie stiffened.

Evelyn pressed. "He likes you. Do you still like him?"

Natalie toyed with the jade pendant at her throat. "He seems reckless, but he’s serious about love. I’ve never seen him learn to cook for a woman. Or stress over gifts. Or use his sister as an excuse to invite her to dinner." She met Evelyn’s gaze. "Should I consider him?"

Evelyn smirked. Time to play wingman.

Silence stretched.

Then Natalie laughed—soft, bittersweet. She pinched Evelyn’s cheek. "Lil E, meet Adrian Prescott. My new boyfriend."

A glass shattered in the kitchen.

###Chapter 641 

The silence was suffocating.

Then Lucas spoke, voice rough. "Since when?"

They turned. His eyes were bloodshot.

Natalie smiled, detached. "Recently. We’ve known each other forever. Feelings just... happened."

Lucas’s knuckles whitened. Veins bulged along his forearms.

Evelyn jumped in. "Congrats! Should’ve told me sooner."

Natalie’s gaze flicked to Adrian. "That’s why I brought him."

Evelyn forced a grin. Poor Lucas.

She ushered Natalie and Adrian out, then turned.

Lucas looked wrecked.

"Forget her," Evelyn said.

His jaw clenched. "No. We’re breaking them up."

Evelyn groaned. "Men only want what they can’t have."

"I’m not helping."

Lucas pulled out his wallet. "Take every card."

Evelyn hesitated. Then she snatched the black Amex. "Not for the money. For your happiness."

Lucas’s lips twitched. "Thanks, sis."

Evelyn pocketed the card. Cha-ching.

Now, how to sabotage a happy couple?

###Chapter 642

Lucas hated Evelyn’s strategy.

But she knew Natalie best.

So he waited.

Meanwhile, Evelyn dominated headlines for three days. Stocks for Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Industries soared.

Every socialite tried copying her—paid paparazzi, staged photos.

None measured up.

[Pathetic. They think buying trends makes them icons?]

[Unlike our CEO Evelyn, who earns it.]

When the board suggested another publicity stunt, Evelyn refused.

Too predictable.

At Blackwood Industries, Nathan Blackwood exited a meeting to find Reginald Blackwood waiting.

His grandfather slapped a magazine on the desk. "Why wasn’t I informed about the Sterling alliance?"

Nathan didn’t flinch. "You’re informed now."

Reginald scoffed. "Nicole—Evelyn—publicly endorsed this. She’s open to reconciliation. Marry her."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "The Harrisons are out, so now you want the Sterlings?"

Reginald’s face reddened. "This is for you! Do you not want her?"

Nathan stayed silent.

Reginald leaned in. "Then do something irrevocable. Get her pregnant. Force her hand."

Nathan’s gaze turned glacial. "She’s Evelyn Sinclair."

Not some pawn.

Reginald smirked. "Kidnap her. Stage a scandal. The media will—"

"Enough." Nathan’s voice was lethal. "Try anything, and I’ll ship you to Switzerland like Mother."

Reginald paled.

Nathan turned away.

He’d win Evelyn—but not like this.

###Chapter 643 

Preston frowned as Reginald Blackwood drawled, "With your sluggish tactics, she'll only glance your way at forty or fifty—unmarried and too late. Better make an irrevocable move. Get her pregnant. She'll have no choice then."

Preston's face iced over. His gaze turned arctic. "She's Evelyn Sinclair."

Not some helpless victim. Backed by Sterling Enterprises, she'd retaliate fiercely. Provoking the Sterlings meant mutual destruction.

Reginald chuckled coldly. "Precisely because she's a Sinclair. Their reputation can't afford scandals. We'll force their hand."

Preston stared him down. "What 'necessary means'?"

Reginald smirked. "Kidnapping. Compromising situations. Media exposure. Once entangled, she can't escape. Our public apology will smooth things over. Then retrieve your sister—Ingrid's suffered enough."

Preston's blood ran cold.

How dare he plot this against Evelyn? While Preston had entertained dark fantasies in anger, he knew acting on them would earn him a knife to the throat—not forgiveness.

Seeing Preston's silence, Reginald grew smug. "Don't overthink ethics. Results matter—unless you want to watch her bear another man's heirs and create powerful enemies for us?"

To Reginald, the Sterlings were either allies or threats. Evelyn's brilliance made her too valuable to lose.

"Grandfather." Preston's glacial tone could freeze hell. "Harm her, and I'll have you supervised 24/7. Attempt anything, and you'll join Mother abroad indefinitely."

Reginald's face purpled. "You'd threaten me over a woman?"

Preston's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Find a hobby. Fishing. Travel. Chess. Stay out of my affairs."

"Don't tell me you don't want this!"

"I do. But I'll win her properly—not through cowardice."

The standoff crackled between them.

Reginald sneered. "Your loss." He turned to leave, convinced Preston would relent.

Instead, Preston's voice turned deadly. "Remember my warning. Cross me, and you'll regret it."

###Chapter 644

Reginald Blackwood's entire body trembled violently. He turned sharply to glare at Nathan with deadly disbelief burning in his eyes. "You—"

Nathan called for his assistant without hesitation. "Escort Mr. Blackwood back to Highland Estates." His voice held finality as he deliberately avoided looking at his grandfather again. Reginald's face flushed crimson with rage.

Nathan had always been the grandson he was most proud of—the heir he'd poured decades of effort into molding. Unlike Nathan's father Charles Blackwood, who was timid and lacked ambition, Nathan had shown brilliance and boldness since childhood. That's why Reginald had bypassed Charles entirely, handing the company directly to Nathan when he came of age.

Until this moment, Nathan had been perfect. Now, Reginald suddenly felt ancient and powerless. The grandson he'd shaped no longer obeyed him.

After Reginald's departure, Nathan slumped into his chair, exhaustion lining his features. The dim office lighting seemed to consume his silhouette. Harrison entered with documents in hand. "Mr. Blackwood."

"Speak."

"Confidential intel from overseas." Harrison presented a sealed file—information so sensitive even he couldn't access it. Nathan's gaze sharpened.

Harrison hesitated. "Theodore is... attempting to rear fish in the antique aquarium you purchased at the Geneva auction. The fifth batch has just perished."

A glacial silence descended. "Have him report as my personal bodyguard tomorrow."

Harrison barely concealed his shock before nodding professionally and exiting. Bodyguard? In dangerous situations, Theodore would be the first to flee! But questioning Nathan's decisions wasn't an option.

Meanwhile, a new lounge had opened in San Francisco's nightlife district. Naturally, Isabella Montgomery had to investigate. She called Evelyn Sinclair right after work hours. "Drinks. Now."

When Evelyn arrived at Velvet Lounge, she was met with neither pulsating music nor gyrating dancers—just oppressive melancholy. "This is a nightclub?"

The atmosphere was funereal, the music so depressing it could drain joy from champagne. Evelyn scanned the surprisingly crowded space. "How is anyone enjoying this?"

The manager spotted Evelyn's designer ensemble immediately. Though he didn't recognize her in the low light, her Birkin and Patek Philippe screamed wealth. He scurried over. "Madam, how may we serve you?"

"Change this dreadful music."

The manager winced. "A client reserved the entire venue tonight with specific musical requirements."

He knew the soundtrack was inappropriate, but the patron had paid handsomely with one condition: the music couldn't be altered.

"Perhaps a private suite? The sound doesn't carry—"

Evelyn shook her head. "Private rooms lack atmosphere." Isabella was running late. Sighing, Evelyn ordered several bottles of premium Dom Pérignon and settled at the bar to wait.

The manager hovered. "Anything else?"

"What's the fee for selecting a song?" Evelyn's fingers tapped impatiently. "Should I buy out the venue? The entire evening?" This music was emotional sabotage—one more minute might drive her to leap from the rooftop.

The manager glanced toward the VIP section where their mysterious patron slumped drunkenly. Money talked. "Whatever pleases you, madam."

"Perfect." Evelyn smirked, slapping Lucas's black AmEx on the counter. "Play Bee Gees' 'Stayin' Alive.' Now."
###Chapter 645 

The bar manager froze when Evelyn Sinclair made her unusual request.

A sophisticated young woman asking for that outdated disco track? But money talked, and she was clearly loaded.

He masked his shock with a practiced smile, eyeing her like she was a walking gold mine.

"Of course! Anything else you'd like?"

"Anything?" Evelyn arched a perfectly sculpted brow.

"Your satisfaction is our priority." The manager bowed slightly. Money made anything possible.

"Then turn it up. I can barely hear it." She gestured dismissively. "And this lighting is depressing. Fix it."

She tapped her chin, then added, "Oh, and I want Katelyn’s blueberry cheesecake. And Banley’s luwak coffee."

A pause. She smirked. "That’s all. Can you handle that?"

The manager gaped for a solid thirty seconds before remembering his customer service smile.

But one glance at the black card tossed carelessly on the counter—and the obscene amount she’d already spent—sealed his compliance.

"Absolutely! Consider it done."

Evelyn grinned. A bar this accommodating? She’d be back.

Within moments, the melancholic tune was replaced by the deafening beats of Stayin’ Alive.

The abrupt shift from funeral dirge to 70s disco whiplashed the entire crowd.

Isabella Montgomery arrived just in time to witness the chaos.

She gaped at the dance floor, where patrons awkwardly swayed to the retro anthem.

"Nikki—wait, Evelyn," she corrected, still adjusting to her friend’s new identity. "Is this a bar or a time warp?"

Evelyn, already halfway through her third bottle, turned with glassy eyes. "Took you long enough."

She gestured grandly to the untouched cake. "Service here is excellent. We’re making this our spot."

Isabella’s gaze dropped to the lineup of emptied premium liquor bottles.

Hard pass.

Before she could protest, a slurred shout cut through the music.

"I reserved this place! Who the hell changed my playlist?!"

The voice was familiar. And very, very drunk.

"Some rich bitch? You’ll piss me off but not her?" The man stumbled into view, his tie loose, face flushed. "I dare you to show me the psycho who wants to hear this garbage!"

His rant escalated. "My wife left me! Stayin’ Alive is the last thing I—"

Isabella yanked Evelyn’s sleeve. "That’s Tristan Whitmore."

Evelyn took a slow sip, then sauntered toward the commotion.

Tristan, mid-tirade, froze when he spotted her leaning against the railing. Moonlight sharpened her icy stare.

His blood ran cold.

"The ‘rich woman with weird tastes’ is you?"

He recoiled—only for someone behind him to shove him forward by accident.

A scream. A crash.

Tristan tumbled down the stairs in a spectacular sprawl of limbs.

Groaning, he clutched his head as Stayin’ Alive continued blaring.

The universe, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.
###Chapter 646 

The bar manager rushed forward to help the fallen man. "Young Master Whitmore!"

A tight circle formed around Tristan. Evelyn Sinclair let out a cold scoff while Tristan trembled.

Whispers spread through the crowd. "She's done for. Young Master Whitmore isn't someone you mess with. He won't let this slide."

"Right? Think he'll call the cops and frame her?"

"Manager, what do we do? Hand her over?"

Tristan struggled to open his eyes and unlocked his phone. "Call my wife to pick me up. The song was great. Don't start trouble!"

He couldn't afford to cross Evelyn. Best to distance himself.

The thought barely formed before he passed out.

The manager hesitated, then picked up Tristan's phone to arrange a ride.

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension. "He's divorced. Call his friend instead."

She found Nathan Blackwood's number in Tristan's contacts and tossed the phone back. Then she grabbed her bag and left with Isabella Montgomery.

The manager wavered. He dialed the contact labeled "Wifey" first.

Disconnected in one ring.

Guess the divorce was real.

Next, he called Nathan.

Nathan barely reacted to the news of Tristan's drunken state. He sent someone to collect him but didn’t bother showing up himself.

Outside, a sharp gust of wind hit Evelyn and Isabella, making them shiver. They exchanged a glance and laughed.

"You're almost drunk. I'll take you home," Isabella said, then frowned. "Wait, where's your car?"

"My driver dropped me off."

Isabella blinked. "Same here."

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "I'll call my brother. You can stay at my place tonight."

A shadow darted past them.

Evelyn, slowed by alcohol, barely registered it—until her hand was empty.

Across the street, a group of punks with neon hair grinned maliciously.

Evelyn and Isabella locked eyes.

Trouble.

This bar was new, unclaimed territory. Naturally, gangs were circling.

"Hey, pretty ladies. Wanna have some fun?" One whistled, leering.

Two women against a pack of wolves.

Evelyn sobered fast. Her gaze turned icy. "Give me back my phone."

"Or what? Maybe if you kiss me, I'll think about it."

Evelyn's expression darkened. These idiots were nothing to her.

But Isabella couldn't fight. If things turned ugly, she might get hurt.

While Evelyn hesitated, the loudest punk suddenly screamed, clutching his head as he collapsed.

Blood poured from a wound where a rock had struck him.

A man stepped into the light from the bar entrance—dressed in black, his usual polished demeanor gone.

Preston Sinclair?

Evelyn blinked. The ruthless glint in his eyes made her think, for a second, she was looking at Nathan.

Preston dusted off his hands like the rock had dirtied them. "Ms. Sterling. Wait here. I'll take you home soon."

The punks, seeing he was alone, lost their fear. With a roar, they charged.

Evelyn moved to help, but Isabella yanked her back. "Eve, no! You can't brawl like this—what kind of impression does that give?"
###Chapter 647

"Evelyn, give him a chance."

Isabella's words made Evelyn freeze mid-step. Her best friend leaned in closer, whispering conspiratorially, "Those punks don't stand a chance against him. Just relax and let the man show off!"

Evelyn frowned.

Before sixty seconds passed, the situation completely reversed. The rainbow-haired thugs were howling in pain. Some scrambled away while others screamed for the police.

"First day on the job?" Evelyn muttered. "Since when do gangsters call the cops?"

Isabella wrinkled her nose in disgust. "Gangsters these days are getting softer. What kind of wimps join gangs nowadays?"

Preston Sinclair still looked every inch the polished Wall Street tycoon, though his slightly rumpled clothes gave him a dangerous edge. The usual refinement had given way to something wilder, more unpredictable.

Isabella waved enthusiastically. "You okay there, handsome?"

Preston flashed that trademark enigmatic smile. "Perfectly fine." His gaze locked onto Evelyn as he picked up her discarded phone, handing it over with a rueful expression. "Screen's cracked. I'll replace it."

Evelyn examined the damaged device. The screen was shattered, completely unresponsive. "That's unnecessary, Mr. Sinclair. You've already done more than enough tonight."

She had spare phones at Sterling Manor anyway. No need for immediate replacements.

"Nonsense." Preston rolled up his sleeves casually, revealing toned forearms that caught the streetlight just right. The usually immaculate businessman looked almost... rugged. "Getting to play hero for two beautiful women? That's reward enough."

His warm eyes crinkled at the corners, dispelling the night's chill. "I was fortunate enough to hear your song choice at Velvet Lounge earlier, Ms. Sterling. Excellent taste. My friends and I were so engrossed, I nearly missed seeing you off."

Evelyn's cheeks burned. "How long were you there?"

"Since before you arrived." His amused gaze told her everything.

Evelyn wanted to vanish into the pavement. That mortifying moment when she'd entered like some gauche socialite flaunting her wealth... Her carefully cultivated ice queen image—shattered.

If only she'd known acquaintances were present...

Preston gestured to a sleek car idling nearby. "Allow me to escort you ladies home."

Evelyn opened her mouth to refuse, but Preston turned his charm on Isabella. "What do you say, gorgeous? Give a guy a break?"

Isabella arched a brow and dragged Evelyn forward. "Since you're friends, no need for formalities!"

Evelyn shot her traitorous friend a glare but followed anyway. The moment they settled into the luxurious interior, Isabella rattled off her address—clearly angling to give them privacy later.

Preston gave Isabella a grateful look, his large hands flexing on the steering wheel as he fielded her increasingly personal questions with effortless grace. Isabella's gossip radar was practically vibrating.

While interrogating Preston, Isabella fired off texts to Evelyn: [How well do you know this guy???]

Evelyn replied: [You know him too. Oliver's father.]

Isabella's mouth fell open. "Holy sh—" She caught herself, clearing her throat loudly. "Mr. Sinclair, your fighting skills back there were impressive!"

The car fell silent for a beat.

So the smooth-talking billionaire playboy was actually a single dad? Isabella's eyebrows nearly hit her hairline.

They reached Isabella's apartment too soon. She hesitated at the curb. "Text me when you get home!" Her protective glare at Preston said everything—she didn't trust this "older man with a kid" alone with her best friend.

Evelyn saw right through her. "Goodnight, Bella."

The moment the door closed, Preston chuckled. "That neighborhood's gotten rough lately, Ms. Sterling. Maybe avoid solo visits."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'll be more careful."

She'd never run into trouble before—probably because she usually traveled with an entourage. Sebastian would have been there, making her untouchable.

Preston considered this before offering, "Next time you want to go, call me." His tone left no room for argument. "Any time."
###Chapter 648

Evelyn Sinclair arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Sinclair, I never pegged you as the bar-hopping type."

Preston Sinclair frowned. "Do I really give off such a stuffy vibe?"

"You just seem more like the symphony-and-wine kind of man."

Preston narrowed his eyes. "Are you implying I'm boring?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together to suppress a smile. "Don't put words in my mouth."

Preston exhaled sharply, but the tension dissolved when they both burst into laughter.

Ten minutes later, the car pulled up to Sterling Manor. Isabella must have called ahead—Lucas was already waiting at the entrance, shivering in the cold. The butler opened the gates, and Preston drove straight through.

Lucas sneezed dramatically as he opened Evelyn's door. "You're back late. And you've been drinking?"

Evelyn smirked and turned to Preston. "Come inside for a bit. Oliver should still be awake."

After everything he'd done for her tonight, it would be rude to send him away now.

Preston hesitated, then nodded. "If it's not too much trouble."

Inside, William Sterling lounged in the living room with Leo cradled in one arm and Oliver nestled against his side. The scene was oddly domestic. Preston hadn't expected his son to adapt so seamlessly to this household.

Oliver wore tiger-striped pajamas. When he spotted Preston, he waved sleepily. "Hi, Daddy!"

Preston sighed.

William stood with a warm smile. "Mr. Sinclair, thank you for bringing Evelyn home. Please, make yourself comfortable."

Preston inclined his head politely. "Just passing by." His gaze lingered on his son, torn between amusement and exasperation.

"I appreciate you looking after him. He hasn't been too much trouble?"

William chuckled. "Oliver? He's an absolute delight—well-mannered, bright, and utterly charming."

Preston watched as Oliver preened under the praise, wriggling happily in William's arms. That little manipulator. No wonder everyone doted on him.

Evelyn settled onto the sofa, wrapping herself in a cashmere throw. The butler handed her a heated stone, which she cradled gratefully. "Really, Mr. Sinclair, Oliver's welcome here anytime. We adore having him."

Oliver shot Preston a triumphant look. See? Pretty Lady likes me.

Preston's jaw twitched.

"I think we've overstayed our welcome. Oliver, time to go back to the hotel."

Oliver immediately burrowed deeper into William's embrace. "No! I wanna stay!"

William patted the boy's back soothingly. "Poor thing. Hotels are so impersonal for a child. He should stay here. You're welcome to visit whenever you like."

Preston stiffened. Had his son been badmouthing their living arrangements?

The butler arrived with steaming mugs of cocoa. "This will warm you up, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston accepted one, watching as everyone sipped theirs—except Oliver, who'd already dozed off. Lucas scooped him up effortlessly.

Preston stood abruptly. "I'll take him—"

The moment he touched Oliver, the boy whimpered and twisted away. "No... don't wanna leave..."

Preston rolled his eyes. The little actor wasn't fooling anyone.
###Chapter 649 

Preston Sinclair cooed softly. "Don't worry, you don't have to go, sweetheart. Go upstairs and rest."

Little Oliver nodded obediently and settled down. Preston lifted his son into his arms. As Oliver rested his head against his father's shoulder, he pointed toward the staircase.

"I want to sleep in my own room!"

Preston nearly rolled his eyes. "Must you be so obvious when pretending?"

Evelyn chuckled at Oliver's dramatic performance. The entire Sterling household fell silent, afraid to disturb the "sleeping" child.

No one seemed to notice the boy was faking it. Preston stiffened, carefully carrying his son upstairs with Lucas leading the way. When they reached Oliver's room, Lucas watched as Preston expertly tucked the boy in.

"Fatherly love," Lucas murmured with a sigh.

Preston froze momentarily. After Lucas turned away, Preston lightly pinched Oliver's cheek. "Little actor." Oliver immediately rolled over, clearly uninterested in his father's commentary.

Returning downstairs, Preston found the three Sterling men chatting and laughing. Evelyn said something that made William lose his temper, grabbing a nearby pillow to hurl at Lucas's head.

"Preston gets to show fatherly love, but what about us?" Lucas complained dramatically.

William looked ready to throttle him. "You destroyed my prized jade collection and still expect affection? I ought to beat you senseless!"

Preston cleared his throat to announce his presence. William immediately composed himself and exchanged pleasantries. "It's getting late. I won't impose any longer. Chairman Sterling, thank you for looking after Oliver. I'll visit again soon."

"Think nothing of it. This house could use a child's laughter. I've raised three sons and none bring me joy. Feel free to leave Oliver here anytime!" After a few more words, Preston departed Sterling Manor.

Evelyn headed upstairs as well, the wine from earlier finally making her dizzy. Lucas followed her. "Should I check on Natalie?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "No. You both need space. Keep bothering her and she'll only resent you more." Better to let Natalie enjoy her time with Adrian Prescott without interference.

Lucas studied her face. "You're right."

As winter deepened toward the New Year, at Blackwood Industries...

Nathan Blackwood leaned back in his leather chair, a cigarette dangling between his fingers. His sharp eyes held an icy glint. "Well? Any progress?"

Theodore Winslow trembled in his seat, clutching a book titled "100 Ways to Win Back Your Ex-Wife." After accidentally killing several batches of Nathan's prized fish, Theodore had been reassigned as Nathan's permanent shadow.

Initially confident about reconciling Nathan and Evelyn, Theodore now despaired. The man refused to follow advice, the woman saw through every ploy. "M-Mr. Blackwood...perhaps I'm not cut out for this. Maybe I should quit."

Nathan's cold snort sent shivers down Theodore's spine. "Would you prefer swimming with the fishes in River Aurora?"

"I believe I have one last strategy!" Theodore forced a smile. Survival took priority. After days of research, he'd devised a foolproof plan. "Mr. Blackwood, you must cultivate an image of restrained longing. Don't seek her out, but let your melancholy be visible. Make her come to you!"

Nathan stroked his chin. "How melancholy?"

The following evening, Preston arrived punctually at Evelyn's office under the pretense of visiting Oliver. Evelyn couldn't refuse and even offered dinner to thank him for his help the previous night. Preston eagerly accepted.
###Chapter 650 

After dinner, Preston Sinclair hesitated before speaking. "Ms. Sterling, I'll be traveling abroad to handle some urgent matters and won't return until after the New Year. I apologize for leaving Oliver in your care again."

Evelyn arched a brow. "That's not an issue, but why the sudden trip?"

Normally, someone of Preston's stature wouldn't have pressing matters right before the holidays.

Preston smiled faintly. "A foreign partner is attempting to breach our contract. I need to intervene personally."

Evelyn nodded. "Understood. Don't worry about Oliver—he can stay here. You can always video call if you miss him."

Preston's eyes flickered with something unspoken.

He had a strong suspicion about who was behind this sudden business crisis. Nathan Blackwood really will stop at nothing.

He won’t touch Evelyn’s interests directly, so he’s targeting my overseas ventures instead.

Nathan is so possessive he won’t tolerate anyone near her, huh?

Outwardly, Preston remained composed, his expression as gentle as ever. Evelyn, oblivious to the undercurrents, bid him farewell and retreated inside.

She applied a face mask and lounged on the balcony with Leo in her arms, scrolling through global stock trends. When her phone buzzed, she was too relaxed to check.

Evelyn patted Leo’s back. "Who’s calling?"

The AI tiger’s sensors activated. "Aunty Isabella."

Evelyn smirked. "Answer it."

Isabella’s laughter crackled through the speaker. "Evelyn! Have you seen Nathan Blackwood’s latest post?"

Evelyn frowned. "I blocked him ages ago!"

Nathan rarely posted on social media, and she had no interest in his updates. The less interaction between them, the better.

Isabella’s laughter grew louder. "Oh, he completely missed the mark this time!"

Curious, Evelyn asked, "What did he do?"

Isabella sent a screenshot. Nathan had posted a photo of himself—taken by someone else—standing in his office, gazing pensively at a 45-degree angle. The caption read:

"Life is finite, but I hope to give you infinite happiness, E.S."

Evelyn’s face mask slid off.

This man has lost his mind.

She immediately unblocked Nathan and scrolled through the comments flooding his post.

[Mr. Blackwood’s love is as vast as the ocean!]

[May you and Ms. Sterling find happiness together!]

[Such devotion! She’ll see your heart one day!]

[Finite life, infinite love—so poetic!]

Evelyn’s breath hitched, her face flushing with fury. She dialed Blackwood Industries without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Nathan sat in his office, scowling at his phone under the dim light.

His expression was dark. "You’re certain this would make her reach out?"

Theodore, his butler, had sourced the "romantic" strategy from the internet, even staging the melancholic photo.

"Absolutely," Theodore assured. "Ms. Sterling will contact you."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his fists clenching. The post was so cringe-worthy he could barely stand to look at it.

With every new comment, his carefully cultivated aloof image crumbled further.

This wasn’t him.

This was unbearable.
###Chapter 651

Theodore observed Nathan's stormy expression and carefully explained, "Mr. Blackwood, if you restrict the post's visibility to Ms. Sinclair alone, it'll be pointless if she blocks you."

"Though this might slightly tarnish your image, you must endure it for Ms. Sinclair's sake!"

Nathan was irritated, but he kept reminding himself—this was all for Evelyn.

One minute.

Two minutes.

Nathan's patience wore thinner by the second. His expression darkened ominously.

If Evelyn didn’t call, he’d delete the post first, then personally ensure Theodore regretted his existence.

Just as Theodore felt an icy dread creeping up his spine, making his knees weak, Nathan’s phone rang.

Theodore exhaled in relief and hesitantly handed over the expensive device.

"When Ms. Sinclair speaks to you, don’t sound desperate. No apologies. And don’t delete the post!"

Nathan pressed his lips together, silent as he took the phone. His pulse raced.

"Hello?"

Theodore watched with admiration. Mr. Blackwood was impeccable. Even now, he maintained that unshakable dominance.

All he needed was to keep radiating that CEO authority.

"Nathan Blackwood! Did you lose your damn mind?"

"Post whatever sappy nonsense you want, but why drag me into it? Don’t even pretend it’s not about me—those are my initials! Any idiot would know!"

"Delete that ridiculous post. Now."

Evelyn’s voice was sharp, laced with fury. If not for her status, she’d have cursed him outright.

Nathan’s grip tightened around the phone. His jaw clenched, his cold eyes narrowing. Outwardly composed, the tension in his face betrayed his nerves.

"I won’t delete it," he stated flatly.

"What?!"

Nathan repeated, a mocking edge in his tone. "Only my girlfriend gets to tell me what to do. Are you applying for the position?"

The man who had always been submissive before Evelyn now stood his ground.

A thrill shot through him—along with a flicker of unease.

He waited.

The woman on the line spat out a curse. "Insufferable bastard!"

The call disconnected.

Nathan’s expression darkened further. His icy gaze shifted to Theodore.

Theodore swallowed hard. "Uh… You were right, Mr. Blackwood. Regardless of Ms. Sinclair’s reaction, we can’t back down now."

Nathan scoffed, fingers drumming lightly on the desk. "This is your last chance. Understood?"

Theodore shuddered.

"Understood."

He’d already cost Nathan five batches of rare fish—each worth millions. Debts he could never repay.

Evelyn ignored Nathan’s erratic behavior.

Lately, he’d flooded social media and her inbox, ensuring she couldn’t forget his existence.

Even a fool could see he was trying to win her back.

Hah. As if I’d fall for that.

She left every message unanswered. The only communication between them now ran through Bennett and Harrison.

Dominic Kingsley sent out the mandatory meeting invitations for Kingsley Tech’s quarterly review.

When Evelyn arrived, only Nathan and Dominic were present.

Her brow furrowed. "Did you not notify Mr. Sinclair?"
###Chapter 652 

The boardroom needed Evelyn Sinclair's presence most, yet her seat remained empty. Despite the heating system working overtime, an uncomfortable chill lingered in the air.

Dominic Kingsley offered a practiced smile. "Mr. Sinclair is currently overseas and unable to attend. We'll forward the meeting minutes to him."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line but she stayed silent. She took her seat, scanning the documents before her with sharp focus. Across the table, Nathan Blackwood fought to keep his gaze away—yet failed spectacularly.

Evelyn was a force of nature, impossible to ignore. Every flicker of her expression, every measured word, drew Nathan in against his will. When she mentioned Preston Sinclair's name, his jaw tightened.

He's probably scrambling to save that failing venture abroad. Good. The way he hovers around Evelyn makes my skin crawl.

Dominic's presentation droned on, but Nathan's glacial demeanor amplified the tension in the room. The unspoken hostility between the two ex-spouses turned every meeting into a psychological battlefield.

Finally, the torturous session ended. Dominic cleared his throat. "This project will proceed as planned by year's end. Our psychological assessment device is in its final testing phase. I propose we capitalize on the New Year to launch."

Evelyn's response was razor-sharp. "Premature release risks catastrophic failure. Without thorough trials, we’ll be a laughingstock."

Nathan remained silent—tacit agreement.

Dominic’s brows knitted. "The technology is solid. Police polygraphs are primitive compared to what we’ve developed. This is revolutionary."

Evelyn’s tone turned glacial. "Why the rush? The New Year can wait."

Dominic rubbed his temples, exasperated. "Ms. Sinclair, must everything take a backseat to holidays? You—"

Nathan cut in, voice like steel. "Mind your tone, Kingsley. You’re addressing the CFO."

Dominic paled. Evelyn’s expression didn’t waver, but the warning in her eyes was unmistakable.

Regret flashed across Dominic’s face. He’d overstepped.

"Apologies," he muttered. "I’ve been consulting international colleagues. Globally, the New Year is just another day. Launching first gives us industry dominance. Liberty Tech is already pursuing similar research—"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Rushing guarantees mistakes. First mover advantage means nothing if we crash and burn."

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Thousands of tests first. No shortcuts."

Dominic’s shoulders slumped. Defeated, he offered weakly, "Would either of you like to trial the prototype?"
###Chapter 653

Dominic Kingsley observed with keen interest. Their groundbreaking psychological testing device had achieved something extraordinary—it compiled the world's most renowned cases and treatment methods for various mental illnesses.

The data gathered could delve into a patient's deepest emotional fluctuations and thoughts, guiding them toward self-healing techniques.

Unlike traditional therapy, this process didn't involve another human. It was an unfiltered, balanced dialogue between man and machine.

An artificial intelligence "psychiatrist" was designed with enough data and settings to earn a patient's trust for targeted treatment and psychological intervention. No matter the patient's past or struggles, there was no risk of betrayal or privacy exposure—an undeniably attractive feature. The results of this research would undoubtedly send shockwaves through the world.

Evelyn Sinclair was fascinated. She couldn't wait to try it.

After all, an experienced psychiatrist could manipulate a patient's psyche—but could a machine do the same?

Dominic smiled at Nathan and Evelyn. "This way, please."

Nathan didn't dwell on the machine potentially invading his privacy. His military background had subjected him to rigorous psychological training—nothing could easily unsettle him.

Before he could refuse, Evelyn was already on her feet. Nathan swallowed his objections, adjusted his shirt, and followed.

The laboratory was encased in airtight, gray walls made of specialized material. Evelyn and Nathan stood at the entrance, close but silent.

Even Dominic was impressed—Nathan had passed up countless opportunities to speak to Evelyn.

A white-coated technician emerged and nodded.

"It's ready." Dominic gestured. "You can go in together."

Surprisingly, the system accommodated two people simultaneously.

Evelyn stepped inside without hesitation, only to find two separate chambers. She instinctively entered one, while Nathan took the other.

The door closed behind her with a soft click.

A warm, melodic male voice filled the room.

"Hello, Ms. Sinclair. It's a pleasure to meet you."

The space, initially decorated in plain white, subtly shifted into Evelyn's favorite color—a sophisticated smoky gray, minimalist yet elegant. The tatami mats and furniture softened into a style she adored.

The transformation was seamless.

The system can read personal preferences to create a comfortable, safe environment?

Evelyn was stunned but kept her composure. Through the window, she saw delicate blossoms clinging to tree branches, wild and breathtaking. A vast field of flowers stretched beyond.

The floral scent was intoxicating.

Then she snapped back to reality—it was winter. This had to be artificial.

Yet the illusion was flawless.

"Ms. Sinclair, please take a seat." The voice returned, soothing like a trusted confidant.

"Don't worry. I only inferred your tastes from your attire. The AI psychological detection system can't peer into your heart—it's merely an aid for mental health recovery."

Evelyn hesitated. "Can I see the man who came in with me?"
###Chapter 654 

Evelyn Sinclair found the entire setup far more unsettling than she'd anticipated. The system hesitated for a brief moment—clearly unprepared for her unusual request.

Within seconds, the door swung open.

Dominic Kingsley stood there, lips curved in that infuriating smirk of his. "Against protocol," he drawled, "but since it's you, Ms. Sinclair, we'll bend the rules."

Evelyn arched a brow. One of us playing lab rat is enough.

Dominic snapped his fingers. The system reset instantly, and the wall before them dissolved into transparency. She shot him a sidelong glance, unimpressed.

"Expensive material?"

"Only the best," he murmured, leaning closer. "Safety first."

Her gaze shifted to the man on the other side.

Nathan Blackwood stood motionless, his piercing gaze scanning the space around him. The room mirrored Highland Estates—bright, sterile, suffocating. Evelyn's fingers twitched.

Then his head snapped toward them.

Her breath hitched.

He can see me?

Dominic chuckled. "Relax. The wall's one-way. He can't hear or see us."

She exhaled sharply, schooling her features into icy detachment. "Leave."

Dominic blinked.

Evelyn tilted her head. "You really think Nathan would let you walk away if he knew you were poking around his mind?"

"But you're—"

"I'm not worried."

His smirk faltered. Right. That threat was for me.

With a stiff nod, he left.

Evelyn turned back.

Nathan's attention had drifted, but his expression shifted—distant, then pained. A smile ghosted his lips, bitter and fleeting.

Her stomach twisted.

Damn it.

Dominic hadn't mentioned she wouldn't hear anything. The silence was maddening.

She was about to leave when Nathan suddenly lunged forward, eyes blazing.

"Evelyn!"

No sound—but she read her name on his lips.

Her pulse spiked.

He stumbled back, agony contorting his features.

She couldn't watch.

Every buried memory surged forward, raw and relentless. This had been a mistake.

Evelyn pivoted and strode out, her mask firmly back in place.

Dominic lounged against the opposite wall, briefing his team. At her exit, his brows shot up. "That fast?"

Her voice was frost. "Curious? Go look yourself."

"Hard pass." He grinned. "But seriously—what’s got a man like Nathan Blackwood so torn up?"

The unspoken answer hung between them.

Evelyn thought of Nathan's shattered expression, the way he'd choked on her name.

Her reply was razor-sharp. "I heard nothing."
###Chapter 655 

Dominic Kingsley and Evelyn Sinclair headed to the lounge for tea. Or more accurately, they were there to hear Benjamin Carter's report.

Midway through, Nathan Blackwood received a phone call and stepped out.

Evelyn sat quietly sipping her tea. Less than fifteen minutes later, she faintly heard Nathan's angry voice through the walls. She set down her cup and stood.

Before reaching the door, she caught Nathan's icy words to Dominic: "What kind of bullshit AI psychiatrist is this? It can't solve my problem so it tells me to forget? Do I need a machine to tell me forgetting is the solution?!"

Dominic asked, "Then who does it want you to forget?"

"Fuck off!"

Evelyn retreated back to her seat, arms crossed. Nathan and Dominic entered moments later. Nathan's displeasure was palpable. "This project needs postponing. The system's too rigid. If it can't even comprehend one percent of human psychology, how can we claim it'll revolutionize anything?"

Dominic looked like a wronged child. Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"Get world-class experts to test it. We'll launch when it meets their standards." Dominic's eyes brightened. "Now that's a solid plan! Precise and—"

Nathan's jaw tightened. His sunken gaze locked onto Evelyn as he remained silent. Dominic glanced between them. "Mr. Blackwood, what do you think of Ms. Sinclair's suggestion?"

Everything hinged on Nathan's response.

Nathan arched a brow, his lips curling as he studied Evelyn. "What she said." Of course - only Evelyn could sway Nathan's decisions.

Their eyes met. Nathan's smile turned probing. "Who were you thinking about in there? Who can't you move on from?"

A beat passed. Evelyn's gaze darkened before she suddenly laughed. "I didn't go in."

Nathan froze. His head snapped toward Dominic.

Dominic shrunk into his seat, playing dead. The silence stretched until Nathan's tension visibly dissipated. "Then... do you want to know who I was thinking about?" His intense stare burned into Evelyn.

She smiled faintly. "No."

Not interested. Nathan's amusement died. The simulation had forced him to relive his worst nightmare - painfully accurate memories of Evelyn crying alone after filing for divorce. He'd tried to comfort her, but she couldn't see him. That heartbreak had terrified him.

The system had offered to erase those memories - to make him forget Evelyn. He'd refused instantly.

Forgetting her would hurt more than having his heart carved out. Nathan's dark eyes traced her features. Suddenly, he chuckled.

"Evelyn, you're really—" Before he could finish, her icy glare made his pulse jump. He pivoted smoothly: "Really... too beautiful." Dominic nearly choked.

"What the hell is Mr. Blackwood saying?" Evelyn had no response. When Bennett messaged her, she excused herself immediately.

Nathan laughed again, equal parts resigned and determined. His hunger to win her back hadn't dimmed. "What can I do? Even when she freezes me out, I'd still come running if she crooked a finger. She's crushed my pride, but I'll still lift her up."

At Blackwood Industries, Tristan Whitmore waited miserably in the lounge. After nearly three hours, when Nathan finally returned, Tristan rushed over clutching his chest dramatically. "Nate, my heart's breaking—"
###Chapter 656 

Nathan's brow furrowed in irritation. Tristan's presence grated on his nerves.

"Get out. You're insufferable."

Tristan's expression crumpled. Was this really how brothers treated each other?

Nathan leaned back in his chair, voice icy. "State your business or leave. This isn't a damn tavern."

Tristan's lips pressed into a thin line, exhaustion etched across his face.

"Why aren't you upset? We're in the same sinking ship! You can't win Evelyn back, and I've lost Vivian."

Nathan exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. Did Tristan expect them to sob in each other's arms?

Tristan's eyes were bloodshot. "She blocked me. I can't reach her. What do I do?"

Nathan barely suppressed an eye roll. Pathetic. He'd endured worse without crumbling.

"Figure it out."

Tristan dragged his hands down his face. "Ask Evelyn to intervene. She's Vivian's majority shareholder now. Her word carries weight."

Nathan's jaw clenched at the mention of Vivian. That woman was poison.

"Impossible." His tone left no room for argument.

Tristan slumped. "Right. The moment Evelyn speaks to her, Vivian will flee the country."

Nathan's glare darkened. Vivian was a corrupting influence on Evelyn.

Tristan hesitated. "That night I got drunk... was Evelyn okay?"

Nathan stilled. "Explain."

"The bar manager called you to pick me up. Didn't you know?"

A vague memory surfaced. A trivial matter he'd dismissed.

"What does that have to do with Evelyn?"

Tristan swallowed. "She was the one who alerted the manager. Heard some punks targeted drunk women near the new bar's entrance. Evelyn ran into them when she left."

Nathan's entire body went rigid.

"What?" The word was a blade.

Tristan shrank back. "You didn't know? Someone stepped in—beat them bloody. Preston Sinclair, apparently. By the time you got there, it was over. You couldn't have saved her."

The air turned arctic. Nathan's expression twisted into something feral.

His chest burned. He should've been there. The missed opportunity carved a hole inside him, filling with fury.

Tristan kept rambling, desperate for camaraderie, but Nathan had no patience for shared misery.

Defeated, Tristan left.

Thirty minutes later, Nathan summoned Harrison.

"Buy that bar. Track down every thug in the vicinity." His voice was lethal. "Break them."

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, is this about the acquisition... or the beating?"

"Both."
###Chapter 657 

New Year's Eve approached. Evelyn Sinclair delegated her corporate responsibilities and immersed herself in social engagements.

Pre-holiday events were deliberately kept light—everyone knew the real frenzy would begin after the New Year. Alexander Sterling managed their overseas ventures while Evelyn oversaw domestic operations.

William Sterling took Lucas and little Oliver shopping.

Paparazzi frequently spotted the A-list actor browsing high-end department stores across the city.

Donovan Sterling had rare downtime from his research lab, though holiday cheer eluded him. William made multiple calls just to ensure his brother would join the family celebration.

Finally, New Year's Eve arrived. Evelyn dismissed her staff early, becoming the first to leave Sterling Enterprises headquarters.

As she exited the building, Preston Sinclair stood waiting at the curb. Time hadn't diminished his gentle demeanor—still the picture of quiet sophistication that radiated calm. Yet Evelyn detected something darker lurking behind his composed smile.

She blinked, and the shadow vanished. Preston's lips curved. "I came to pick up Oliver, but my driver got held up. Mind giving me a ride?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Of course she didn't mind.

Behind the wheel, Evelyn navigated through traffic while Preston fielded a call. His polite mask slipped briefly, irritation flashing across his features. "Now? Fine." Hanging up, he met her questioning gaze.

"Emergency?" she asked.

"A private auction just announced a piece from my wishlist."

Evelyn checked the clock. "We've got time. Let's swing by."

These exclusive auctions operated on whims—no set schedules, no public access. The items? Often priceless collectibles with mysterious provenance.

Preston's gratitude shone through. "Ms. Sinclair, your beauty is surpassed only by your kindness. May the new year bring you boundless joy."

Evelyn laughed. "I'd prefer boundless wealth, actually."

Preston's chuckle held genuine amusement. "Ever the pragmatist."

The auction venue—an elite members-only club—welcomed them after Preston flashed his credentials. The intimate crowd contained several familiar faces. Evelyn exchanged polite nods with acquaintances while scanning the room.

Her breath caught.

Reginald Blackwood held court across the space, surrounded by sycophants. The patriarch remained a formidable presence despite his age, his influence undiminished. A veritable wall of admirers orbited him.

Their eyes met.

The old man's piercing gaze narrowed as he approached. His displeasure at seeing Preston beside Evelyn flashed briefly before vanishing behind practiced charm. "Evelyn, what a surprise. And who's this? Another protege from Horizon Media?" The barb hid beneath superficial pleasantry.

Preston remained unruffled. "Preston Sinclair, sir. Finance, not film."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. This was deliberate provocation.

She offered a frosty nod and steered Preston away. Behind them, Reginald called out, "Give my regards to your father. I'll pay the Sterling estate a visit after the holidays."

Traditional New Year visits between business allies were customary. This year marked the first such exchange between their families—a consequence of their forced corporate alliance.

Evelyn swallowed her distaste. "You're always welcome, Chairman Blackwood."

"Should you see anything you fancy," the old man added magnanimously, "consider it my gift."

The paternalistic tone set Evelyn's teeth on edge. "Unnecessary. Our partnership is strictly transactional—no favors required."

The auctioneer's gavel fell. "Sold for three hundred million!"

Preston studied the proceedings with detached interest. "Concerned for me?" he murmured.

"Aren't you?"

"Worry changes nothing." His gaze flicked toward Nathan Blackwood across the room. With Preston's assets currently frozen and this contract requiring private funds—resources he couldn't access without scrutiny—bidding against Nathan was impossible.

Evelyn understood. Sterling Enterprises could intervene, but Preston hadn't asked. She wouldn't insult him by offering unrequested assistance.

The gavel fell again. "Sold!"
###Chapter 658 

Evelyn's words struck the Blackwoods like a slap. When she was married to Nathan Blackwood, they'd scrutinized every penny she spent. Now that they were divorced, Reginald Blackwood wanted to gift her something extravagant for New Year's? The irony wasn't lost on her.

The old man caught the mockery in her tone. His expression darkened, the creases between his brows deepening. Just as Evelyn braced for an outburst, he laughed instead. "We're still family, my dear. There's no need for such formality."

Evelyn arched a brow but didn't press further.

She glanced at Preston Sinclair, who smoothly stepped forward, his hand resting lightly on the small of her back. "Shall we?" he murmured. "Goodbye, Chairman Blackwood."

Their closeness didn't escape Reginald's notice. Preston Sinclair? Ha! As if he could ever compare to Nathan. The old man gestured sharply to an attendant. "Get Nathan here. Now."

The man nodded. "Right away, sir."

Evelyn suppressed a shiver at Preston's touch but kept her smile intact. Once inside, he withdrew his hand with practiced ease, brushing her arm instead. She exhaled, looping her arm through his with silent understanding.

The auction hall was dim, bathed in an air of mystery. A single spotlight illuminated the central podium, casting an expensive glow over the proceedings. It began in minutes.

Only three items were up for bidding. The first—a 16th-century vase—was predictably claimed by Reginald, who had a penchant for historical artifacts. The second item, however, piqued Evelyn's interest: a high-stakes contract.

Preston raised his bid without hesitation.

At $230 million, the competition dwindled. Few dared gamble on an unknown contract's risks.

"$230 million going once—"

"$300 million."

A cold, commanding voice cut through the room.

Nathan stood at the entrance, his presence alone parting the crowd. Whispers erupted.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

"Is he interested in this?"

The attendees instinctively cleared a path for him.

Preston didn't react—no frustration, no surprise. As if he'd expected this. Evelyn stayed silent.

Nathan's gaze lingered on her for a heartbeat before sliding to Preston, icy and lethal. Then, just as swiftly, he turned to the host.

"$300 million going once," the host announced.

Preston made no move to counter.

Evelyn frowned. "Aren't you bidding?"

He glanced down, amused. "Worried about me, Ms. Sinclair?"

"Aren't you?"

"Worrying won't change anything." His smile faded as he studied Nathan. His company's funds were frozen—this contract couldn't pass through his private accounts without scrutiny.

Nathan knew that.

Evelyn understood too. If Preston needed help, Sterling Enterprises could intervene—but he hadn't asked. She wouldn't offer.

"$300 million—sold!"
###Chapter 659 

"Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood!" The brief exchange caught everyone's attention, but the moment passed quickly.

The auction's third item took everyone's breath away - an exquisite vintage pearl necklace. Three flawless 15mm black pearls with natural bronze undertones glimmered in their velvet case. The piece was so rare and valuable that no reference price existed in the market.

The necklace lay in its white satin box, radiating an ethereal glow. The entire room fell silent. Seasoned collectors recognized this as a once-in-a-lifetime find, worth more than the previous two auction items combined.

After a dramatic pause, the auctioneer smiled. "No starting price. Bidding is open."

The absence of a price tag only heightened the excitement. Bids came rapidly. "$10 million." "$20 million."

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at Preston Sinclair, realizing he stood no chance against Nathan Blackwood in this bidding war. She hesitated before speaking. "Preston, this purchase seems unnecessary."

Preston froze. "Don't you like it?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. His meaning couldn't be clearer. The question wasn't about the necklace - it was about his intentions toward her.
###Chapter 660

Evelyn's pulse quickened at Preston's words.

A complex emotion washed over her. She studied Preston's profile and realized his true intention tonight wasn't the contract—the second auction item—but these exquisite black pearls before them. The realization sent an unexpected warmth through her chest.

Preston raised his paddle again. His voice remained smooth as velvet. "Five hundred million."

Nathan's sharp gaze cut across the room. Preston met it with an unreadable smile. Though polar opposites in temperament, the two men now stood as equals in this silent battle.

Evelyn understood Nathan's game. This wasn't about pearls—it was about challenging the man beside her. She parted her lips to intervene when the auctioneer's voice cut through the tension.

"Ladies and gentlemen! We've received an external bid of eight hundred eighty million dollars from an anonymous international collector. Any higher offers?"

The gilded hall fell silent. Even Nathan's expression darkened. Preston's jaw tightened.

Relief flooded Evelyn. The amount meant nothing to men of their stature. But watching them spar over jewelry made her skin prickle with discomfort. No matter who won, the aftermath would be unbearable.

Both men hesitated. Evelyn cleared her throat. "If this piece holds such significance for our mystery bidder abroad, perhaps we should honor that."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd.

"Ms. Sterling makes an excellent point!"
"Diplomatic relations take precedence."
"Let's avoid unnecessary conflict."

Nathan wrestled with his pride. Letting Preston win would mean allowing the man to impress Evelyn. Yet she showed no interest in the gesture.

Fine. Let the foreigner have it.

The auctioneer's gavel fell. "Sold for eight hundred eighty million!"

The third lot vanished into the hands of a shadowy figure who refused identification. Speculation buzzed, but Preston only felt guilt. Several international ventures hung by a thread—he couldn't risk alienating potential allies over jewelry.

"My apologies, Ms. Sterling. I'd intended these as your New Year's gift."

Evelyn blinked, then shook her head with a polite smile. "That's far too extravagant, Mr. Sinclair. I couldn't possibly accept."

Nathan materialized beside them, his stormy gaze landing on Evelyn. "New Year's plans?"

"None," she answered flatly.

His lips twitched in satisfaction. "Family dinner for the holiday?"

Wealth like theirs usually meant lavish hotel celebrations. But the Sterlings preferred intimate gatherings. With most staff on leave, only their butler and head maid remained—leaving Lucas to handle holiday preparations.

Evelyn nodded and turned to leave when Nathan's voice stopped her.

"Dominic left documents for you in my car." He strode away without waiting for her response, his broad shoulders cutting through the crowd.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. That infuriating man and his commands. Who does he think he's ordering around?
###Chapter 661 

Evelyn rolled her eyes, refusing to engage with Nathan here. She glanced at Preston. "Wait for me."

Preston nodded. "I'll get the car."

Evelyn handed him her keys before following Nathan. He had just reached his car when he turned abruptly, his dark gaze locking onto hers.

"What gift do you want?" His voice was low, controlled.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Where are the documents?"

"Tell me what you want first."

"You lied to me?" Her lips curled into a sneer. She turned to leave.

Nathan's jaw tightened. The moment she moved, his hand shot out, gripping her wrist and yanking her back. He pinned her against the car, one arm caging her in. His expression was stormy, dangerous.

His cool breath fanned her face, sending a shiver down her spine. The driver inside stiffened, debating whether to vanish entirely.

Evelyn met his gaze, unimpressed. "Nathan Blackwood, have you lost your mind?"

His fingers flexed against the car. The emotions he'd been suppressing flickered in his eyes. "I lost it a long time ago, Evelyn. Why are you getting so close to him again?"

He reached for her face. She jerked away. His fingers grazed her earlobe instead, lingering there before giving it a sharp pinch. A dark chuckle escaped him, his voice velvet and lethal.

"It's not just today's bid. If he doesn't back off, I'll strip him of everything—overseas power included."

Evelyn's eyes widened. He wasn't joking.

Nathan found her shock oddly endearing. His chest tightened. Before she could react, he bent down, capturing her lips in a ruthless kiss. The taste of mint flooded her senses, disorienting her for a second.

Then cold reality hit. She shuddered.

When he pulled back, she stared at him like he was a stranger. His eyes burned red with frustration. He couldn't tell her how much it hurt, so he punished her this way instead.

Her indifference made his chest ache.

Then, without warning, he bit her. Hard.

Evelyn gasped, shoving him away. The sharp slap echoed between them.

Nathan's cheek stung. He touched the mark, then smirked, brushing his thumb over her swollen lip. The faint smear of her ruined lipstick only made her fair skin glow more strikingly.

She glared, furious.

He, on the other hand, looked pleased. As if the earlier tension had evaporated.

"A slap for a bite. Fair trade."

Soon, relatives began arriving. Charles Sterling, Evelyn's uncle, had been a shadow of himself since the scandal with Genevieve and Margaret Dawson. William Sterling couldn't bear seeing his brother waste away, so he'd bought him stocks, funding his travels to clear his mind.

Now, Charles looked revitalized.

William greeted everyone before glancing at Evelyn and Donovan. "Lil E, take care of Emily." He trusted his daughter more than his sons—Grant's intensity scared Emily off, and Lucas was pure chaos.

Evelyn nodded, sitting beside Emily. "How did you fall for my brother?"

Emily blushed, stealing glances at Donovan. The adoration in her eyes was almost sickening.

"The Great God is incredible. I'm lucky he noticed me."

Evelyn raised a brow.

Donovan smirked. "You helped, Lil E."

At first, he'd found Emily insufferable.

Nathan studied the mark on Evelyn's lip, regret flickering. "Does it hurt?" His voice was rough.

Evelyn watched his mood shift—anger, sorrow, now guilt. Since when did this bastard become such an actor?

She scoffed. "No. Try biting yourself next time."

Nathan grinned, undeterred. He leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper.

"You can bite me instead."
###Chapter 662 

Nathan Blackwood's infuriating face was inches from Evelyn Sinclair's. Her icy gaze bore into him, devoid of any courtesy.

The moment his guard slipped, she struck.

Her knee drove hard into his injured leg.

Nathan staggered back, shock flashing across his face. She hadn’t held back. Not even a little.

Evelyn wiped her lips with the back of her hand, smearing away the faint trace of blood. Her expression remained cold, unapologetic.

She smirked. "Are you a rabid dog, Nathan? Do it again, and I’ll break more than just your leg."

Her tone was lethal. No bluff.

For once, Nathan faltered. That was his tone—the one he used to command, to intimidate. Now, it was turned against him.

Disgusted, Evelyn turned away, not sparing him another glance.

Nathan clutched his throbbing leg, a bitter laugh escaping him. "Running scared Preston will see?"

Evelyn didn’t pause. Didn’t hesitate.

His driver, who had wisely stayed in the car during the confrontation, finally scrambled out.

"Mr. Blackwood—should I call Dr. Whitmore?"

Nathan waved him off, limping into the car.

He wasn’t done. Not even close. Preston Sinclair wouldn’t marry Evelyn that easily.

"Contact Harrison," Nathan ordered. "Find out who bought the black pearl. Buy it back."

The driver nodded. That pearl belonged to Evelyn. No one else deserved it.

Evelyn slid into the passenger seat, lips still burning.

Preston, behind the wheel, glanced at her. His gaze lingered—just for a second—on her swollen mouth.

But he said nothing.

Instead, he smiled. "No documents?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Screw the documents. I’m never dealing with that bastard again."

Preston chuckled, starting the car. "Seems Mr. Blackwood is jealous."

"Seems he’s deranged," Evelyn shot back.

A beat of silence. Then—

"You still want that contract?"

Preston’s smile didn’t waver. "It’s not a priority."

Evelyn frowned, recalling Nathan’s warning. "I can get it for you."

Preston’s voice softened. "Don’t bother. Even if I had it, I wouldn’t have time. Pacifica’s waiting after New Year’s."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "Trouble?"

"Minor. Just settling assets with some partners."

She exhaled. "Good."

Sterling Manor glittered with holiday decorations.

Lucas Sterling pushed Oliver Sinclair on the backyard swing while William Sterling boomed into his phone, arranging New Year’s guests.

The moment Evelyn and Preston stepped out, Oliver’s face lit up.

He sprinted past Preston—straight into Evelyn’s arms.

"Pretty Lady! I missed you!"

Preston, arms still half-outstretched, blinked.

His son hadn’t seen him in weeks.

And yet.

Oliver clung to Evelyn like she was the sun.

Preston sighed.

Some things never changed.
###Chapter 663 

Evelyn twirled little Oliver in her arms until her arms ached. She set him down gently, fingers combing through his soft curls. "Oliver, go greet your father."

The boy nodded obediently. He toddled over to Preston, cupping the man's face before planting a sloppy kiss on his cheek.

"Daddy, I missed you." His tone lacked conviction. Preston's strained smile suggested he knew it too. This ungrateful child, he thought wryly.

"Since it's New Year's, I'll let it slide." He pinched Oliver's chubby cheeks, chuckling. The boy immediately scampered back to Evelyn, grabbing her delicate hand while squinting mischievously.

"Pretty Lady, I have a surprise for you! Coming soon!" Evelyn blinked. "I've got something special for you too!"

William ended his call and waved them inside. "Enough standing around. Don't let Oliver catch a chill!" The forgotten Evelyn rolled her eyes. Lucas bounded over gleefully. "Looks like you've been replaced!"

"Says the jealous one," she shot back. Lucas froze, itching to retaliate.

As they entered, Preston greeted William politely. The older man nodded curtly, then froze when his gaze landed on Evelyn's mouth. "Evelyn, what happened to your lip?"

The question drew everyone's attention. Evelyn's lips pressed together as she glared at Lucas, who smirked. "Just... bumped into something."

"Really?" Lucas' eyes darted meaningfully between Evelyn and Preston. "That excuse seems thin."

William kicked his son's shin. "Watch your mouth!" Lucas raised his hands in surrender. "Sorry, Dad!"

Evelyn stormed inside, mentally cursing Nathan Blackwood a thousand times over.

William's expression darkened as he studied Preston. The Wall Street tycoon kept his gaze lowered. Little Oliver puffed out his cheeks, glaring at his father. "Daddy, if you hurt Pretty Lady, I won't forgive you!"

Preston gaped. "Whose side are you on?"

"Justice doesn't pick sides!" Oliver declared haughtily.

The butler ushered them inside, tactfully avoiding comment on Evelyn's swollen lips. "Miss Sinclair, your usual coffee?"

"Yes, thank you."

"And for you, Mr. Sinclair?" Preston nodded. "Same, please."

William cleared his throat. "Mr. Sinclair, here to collect Oliver?" Preston's lips thinned. "Yes. We shouldn't impose on your New Year's Eve."

Oliver's face crumpled. He didn't want to leave—this was his first New Year's with Evelyn. William's conflicted gaze mirrored the boy's longing. Keeping Oliver meant keeping Preston. Their relatives would arrive soon, and rumors would spread about another man counting down with them. Not ideal for Evelyn's reputation.
###Chapter 664

Preston Sinclair hesitated, torn between decisions when his phone rang.

His expression shifted the moment he saw the caller ID.

Excusing himself, Preston stood and stepped out to take the call.

Evelyn Sinclair remained composed, her thoughts distant, oblivious to William Sterling's internal struggle. Lucas Sterling, equally unaware, sipped his tea quietly.

Less than thirty seconds later, Preston returned, his demeanor softening as he motioned to Oliver Sinclair.

"Sophia wants to speak with you."

Oliver frowned. "Why didn't she call me directly?" He glanced at his bare wrist.

Right. His smartwatch had taken an unexpected swim earlier.

The boy followed Preston out. When he reached for the phone, Preston withheld it, his smile fading slightly.

"An $880 million international transaction just went through under your name. What did you buy?"

Oliver narrowed his eyes. "You tricked me out here just to ask that?"

Preston arched a brow. "Isn't that amount worth questioning?"

Oliver shrugged. "Just a New Year's gift."

Preston's lips twitched. "For me?"

The boy grinned slyly. "What do you think, Daddy?"

Obviously not.

Preston exhaled, exasperated.

"It's for Evelyn, of course!"

At the mention of her name, Preston's expression softened instantly. "What did you get her?"

Oliver's eyes sparkled mischievously. "A black pearl necklace."

Preston froze.

"So you're the mysterious tycoon?"

$880 million for a single necklace. The numbers matched perfectly.

The infamous black pearl piece that had dominated auction headlines—snatched by an anonymous overseas buyer who outbid even Nathan Blackwood.

Preston never imagined that buyer would be his own son.

Oliver blinked. "Mysterious tycoon? I'm a tycoon just for buying jewelry?"

Preston's face contorted with disbelief.

He’d been outplayed—by a child.

"Using my money to impress a woman. What a devoted son."

But since it was for Evelyn, he couldn’t complain. He’d planned to gift it to her himself.

Oliver had simply beaten him to it.

Preston sighed.

After a pause, he crouched to Oliver’s eye level. "I have to leave for Pacifica before New Year’s. Do you want to come or stay here?"

"Obviously, I'm staying!" Oliver declared without hesitation.

Preston should’ve known.

He walked back inside, shamelessly asking the Sterlings to host his traitorous son.

William nearly leapt at the opportunity. "Absolutely! We’ll take excellent care of him!"

Preston smiled. "Thank you, William."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, tender. "I’ll see you after the holidays."

She nodded. "Next year, then."

It struck her then—Preston had raised Oliver abroad. New Year’s wasn’t the grand celebration it was in Montecito.

To them, it was just another day.

Oliver plopped beside Evelyn, waving cheerfully. "Bye, Daddy! See you next year!"

His grin was downright smug.
###Chapter 665 

Preston Sinclair hesitated, his gaze lingering on Evelyn with unspoken words. She noticed his hesitation and rose gracefully, wrapping a cashmere shawl around her shoulders.

"Let me walk you out."

They reached the grand entrance of Sterling Manor. When she offered his car keys, Preston chuckled and shook his head. "My driver's already on his way. I just wanted a moment alone with you."

Evelyn paused, studying him.

His smile had always been his most disarming trait—warm enough to brighten the darkest room. She exhaled softly. "What is it?"

Preston's eyes crinkled. "Evelyn… may I call you that?"

She frowned slightly. "You never needed my permission."

Without her usual structured blazer, the shawl softened her edges, making her look less like the formidable CEO and more like the girl next door. The contrast tugged at Preston’s chest.

He lowered his head with a quiet laugh. "Calling you 'Ms. Sinclair' makes me feel like we're still strangers."

The confession slipped out before he could stop it.

Evelyn arched a brow. "We are strangers, for the most part." She had been clear—no mixed signals, no false hope.

His smile turned wry. "But we're friends now, aren't we?"

She gave a curt nod, realizing she'd misunderstood. "Then call me Evelyn."

The corner of his mouth lifted. He tested the name, savoring it. "Evelyn."

Something in his tone made her uneasy. His eyes, usually so composed, held an unfamiliar intensity—one that mirrored her own reflection back at her.

Then, without warning, he stepped forward and pulled her into an embrace.

His arms were solid, his warmth startling. By the time she registered the contact, he had already released her.

Her expression frosted over. "Mr. Sinclair—"

A bitter smile touched his lips. "Forgive me. It's just… frustrating, watching Nathan Blackwood treat you like that and being powerless to intervene." His voice dropped. "Jealousy got the better of me. Hit me if you must."

To his credit, Preston owned his mistake like a gentleman—no excuses, no manipulation.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Nathan was infuriating, but Preston’s sudden vulnerability left her at a loss. Rejecting him outright felt cruel, especially with their business ties complicating things.

Noticing her conflict, Preston reached out, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Don’t overthink it. I was just making excuses for bad behavior."

Relief flickered through her. "Don’t joke like that again, Mr. Sinclair."

Affection was dangerous. She didn’t need tenderness—not when she was still picking up the pieces of her heart.

Preston smirked, deliberately ignoring her warning. "If you won’t hit me, I should go."

His car had arrived.

"Safe travels," she said briskly, offering a polite smile.

He laughed. "Rushing me off like Oliver?"

Before she could react, he cupped her face and pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead.

The gesture stunned her.

Preston saw it then—the tangled mess of emotions Nathan had left behind. Evelyn had loved him fiercely once, like a moth to flame. Even now, despite the ashes of that love, Nathan’s apologies and desperate attempts to atone still rattled her.

She heard him. But she couldn’t—wouldn’t—respond.

The pain he’d caused was a lesson etched in blood. Love was a luxury, not a necessity. And Evelyn refused to be fooled again.

Not by Nathan.

Not even by Preston.

He saw the war in her eyes—the harder she tried to forget Nathan, the more his shadow loomed. Her pulse raced, her face paling with quiet despair.

"Fall for someone else?" she muttered. "You, Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston held her gaze. "Would that be so impossible?"
###Chapter 666 

Evelyn felt something flutter against her heart. It was soft, controlled, yet carried an undercurrent of something deep and overwhelming.

Preston was careful with his affection, but the warmth in his gaze was undeniable. Evelyn froze, caught off guard by his sudden closeness. His lips brushed hers, carrying the faintest hint of crisp mint and something intoxicating.

Before she could react, he pulled back. The intensity in his eyes dimmed, replaced by something lighter, teasing. His voice was smooth, like a summer breeze. "Evelyn, do you know the fastest way to forget someone?"

Her body stiffened.

Her expression cooled, dark eyes unreadable. She refused to let herself sink into the embrace of a man she barely knew. Her tone was sharp, warning. "Mr. Sinclair."

Preston cut her off, his brow furrowing slightly.

"Fall in love with someone else," he said bluntly.

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. It felt like something buried deep inside her cracked.

He was relentless. Preston was like sunlight—subtle, persistent, impossible to ignore.

A cold laugh escaped her.

"I don’t waste time on men. They’re like bad investments—high risk, no guaranteed returns." Her words were merciless. Evelyn was logical. Emotions were messy. Love was a distraction.

Preston’s gaze darkened. He stepped forward.

She retreated instantly, wary of another surprise attack. His lips curved, but there was disappointment in his eyes.

His voice dropped, rough with amusement. "Evelyn, I’m a sure bet. Investing in me won’t be a loss."

She didn’t believe him. Security wasn’t found in men—only in the Sterling name. Her lashes flickered, but her composure didn’t waver. "Goodbye, Mr. Sinclair."

This conversation was over.

Preston arched a brow and stepped back. His smile was indulgent. "Goodbye, Evelyn." A pause. Then, softer, "Goodbye, my Ms. Sterling."

From the moment she rejected him, Preston was certain—he would win her over.
###Chapter 667 

Preston Sinclair had seeped into Evelyn's life like sunlight through stained glass - warm, persistent, and impossible to ignore.

He didn't know when this obsession started. Maybe it was the way his love for her defied logic, burning brighter than any obstacle Nathan Blackwood threw between them.

The moment Preston left, Evelyn lingered in the winter air, letting the cold sober her thoughts before returning inside.

Sterling Manor buzzed with holiday cheer.

William Sterling had rolled up his sleeves, helping young Oliver Sinclair and the butler prepare dinner. Lucas tossed Evelyn an apron with a mischievous wink.

She followed him into the kitchen, though neither expected her to actually cook. Lucas worked on dessert while Evelyn leaned against the counter, arms crossed.

"So," Lucas smirked, "what did Preston say out there?"

Evelyn's lips pursed. The memory of that kiss sent heat crawling up her neck. "None of your business."

"Just warning you," Lucas said, "Dad might adore Oliver, but that doesn't mean he'll welcome Preston with open arms. The Sterling heiress marrying a single dad? The tabloids would have a field day."

Evelyn scoffed. "Since when do I care about society's opinion? My love life is my own."

"Fine, fine," Lucas raised flour-dusted hands. "True love conquers all." His exaggerated gagging motion made Evelyn roll her eyes.

"There's nothing between us," she lied.

Lucas paused mid-stir. "It's New Year's Eve. Shouldn't you check on your... friends?"

Evelyn smirked. Friends? Or Natalie? So this was his real agenda.

"If you miss Natalie, just say it. You can visit her yourself."

Lucas slammed down his whisk. "Unacceptable! You took my black card and did nothing? She's alone tonight - as her best friend, you should invite her!"

Guilt pricked Evelyn. Beneath Lucas's casual facade, she saw the desperation he'd hidden since their breakup.

"But what if she's with Adrian?"

Lucas's glare could've melted steel. "He's in Paris for fashion week. She's completely alone."

The unspoken accusation hung between them: You've neglected your best friend.

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "I'll call her. Don't worry, I'll bring her here myself."

Natalie answered on the second ring.

"Come to Sterling Manor for New Year's," Evelyn demanded.

"No thanks. I'm traveling."

Evelyn saw through the lie. "The anniversary of your mother's passing is tomorrow. You wouldn't leave town. We're having relatives over - you won't be the only guest."

Silence. Then a quiet, "Fine. I'll come alone. No need to fetch me."

As Evelyn hung up, she remembered past holidays when Natalie would celebrate with her grandmother. After the old woman's death and the messy breakup with Lucas, Natalie had stopped coming altogether.

That failed relationship still haunted her.

Lucas appeared instantly, boyish hope lighting his face. "Well? Is she coming?"
###Chapter 668 

Evelyn Sinclair rolled her eyes at Lucas. "She's coming soon." Lucas regained his spirits and became even more eager to return to his kitchen duties.

Leo, their AI tiger companion, was draped in an expensive silk scarf from Laurent Dubois. A luxury watch Lucas no longer wanted adorned one of its legs.

The little tiger pranced around Sterling Manor with a smug grin. Hearing William Sterling's booming laughter outside, Evelyn froze for a second before stepping out to investigate.

Her second brother, Donovan Sterling, had returned.

And he wasn't alone.

Emily Whitaker stood beside him, their fingers intertwined. The way they looked at each other left no doubt about their relationship. Evelyn clicked her tongue. "I always thought Donovan would die single. Yet here he is, the first one to bring home a girlfriend?"

Lucas wiped his hands and joined them outside.

The sight hit him like a punch to the gut.

William ordered everyone to gather at the entrance. Evelyn and Lucas exchanged glances before obediently taking their positions. Even Alexander Sterling, who had been working in the study, was summoned.

Leo sat at Evelyn's feet, tail wagging, as it stared up at Emily. "Mean Emily!"

Emily flushed but quickly composed herself, offering a bright smile. "Hello, Uncle William. Hello, Alexander. Hello, Lucas. Hello, Evelyn!"

'Is this really happening? Donovan moves faster than I expected.'

Donovan adjusted his glasses, his usual composed demeanor softened. "Let me introduce my girlfriend, Dr. Emily Whitaker. We plan to marry next year. Your objections won't change that."

Emily bit her lip, clearly embarrassed by his bluntness.

William, Alexander, Lucas, and Evelyn stood speechless.

William recovered first, ushering them inside with a warm smile. As a seasoned businessman, he already knew Emily's background. After Evelyn's disastrous marriage, he had grown wary of anyone getting close to his children.

But Emily was different.

She was a renowned physicist, respected in academic circles. Her family might not match the Sterlings in wealth, but William didn't care. He wanted his children to marry for love, not connections.

"Emily, from today onward, you're family," William declared. "No need for formalities."

Emily blinked, surprised by how welcoming this powerful family was.

Lucas shot Evelyn a glare.

She had to rub salt in his wound. What kind of sister was she? His expression darkened. "I checked. Adrian Prescott is abroad for a fashion show. That means Natalie is alone."

Evelyn winced. She really had neglected her best friend.

With an apologetic smile, she pulled out her phone. "I'll call her. Don't worry, I'll bring her here."

The call connected.

"Natalie, come to Sterling Manor for New Year's Eve!"

"No, thanks. I'm going abroad."

Evelyn sighed. "Don't lie. The first day of the year is your mother's death anniversary. You won't leave. We're having relatives over—you won't be the only guest. I'll pick you up."

Silence.

Then, a quiet, "Fine. I'll come myself. No need to fetch me."

Evelyn hung up and exhaled sharply.

For years, Natalie had spent New Year's with her grandmother. After the old woman passed, she was left completely alone. William often urged Evelyn to invite her, but ever since Natalie and Lucas broke up, she had refused every offer.

That failed relationship still haunted her.
###Chapter 669

Evelyn's expression froze. This can't be happening...

To elevate Donovan, Father was willing to diminish everyone else's accomplishments?

William Sterling beamed with paternal pride. "Donovan is my greatest achievement."

He turned to Emily with twinkling eyes. "Out of all possible suitors, you chose my son. That speaks volumes about your exceptional judgment!"

The forced smiles around the table grew more strained. Even Donovan's usual composure cracked, his lips twitching slightly. "Father, I've already introduced everyone to Emily."

William clapped his hands together. "Splendid! Consider this your home, Emily. We mustn't disappoint such a brilliant young woman." His eyes crinkled with excitement. "Right after New Year's, we'll host the most extravagant wedding Montecito has ever seen!"

Emily's smile wavered. "That's... rather soon?"

Since when did marrying into high society require no vetting process? Why does this feel like a trap?

Donovan shot her a meaningful look. "Given our demanding careers, expediency is logical." His tone left no room for argument.

William nodded approvingly. He'd resigned himself to Donovan's perpetual bachelorhood—who'd have guessed an accomplished woman would willingly take on his eccentric son? Best secure this miracle before she came to her senses.

The arrival of relatives interrupted the awkward moment. Charles Sterling, still recovering from Genevieve Dawson's betrayal, entered with renewed vigor after his worldwide sabbatical funded by William's discreet stock investments.

William rose to greet them, then pinned Evelyn with a meaningful stare. "Make Emily feel welcome."

Of his children, only Evelyn possessed the necessary social grace. Alexander's intimidating presence would send any sane woman fleeing, while Lucas specialized in chaos.

Evelyn obediently slid beside Emily. "So... how exactly did you fall for my brother?"

Emily's lashes fluttered downward, stealing shy glances at Donovan. The adoration radiating from her gaze made Evelyn's skin prickle.

"Working with The Genius was life-changing. I still can't believe he noticed someone like me."

Evelyn's brows shot up. Donovan smirked. "You're partially responsible, little sister."

Initially, he'd found Emily's intellectual shortcomings unbearable—anyone scoring below his exacting standards was irredeemable. But after several corrections, she'd demonstrated unexpected aptitude.

William summoned Donovan outside just as Alexander's phone erupted again. He excused himself to take the call, leaving Lucas to corner Evelyn.

"You're letting Mavis get married first?" Lucas hissed, gripping her arm. "You stole my credit cards and now condemn me to eternal singledom?"

Evelyn freed herself with a practiced twist, waving toward the doorway. "Natalie's here!"

Lucas instantly transformed into his aloof celebrity persona. Seizing the distraction, Evelyn dragged Emily toward the gardens.

Lucas rolled his eyes. Definitely adopted.

Among the rose bushes, Emily finally relaxed. "I prepared for weeks—imagined your father handing me a blank check to disappear." She laughed nervously. "Affluent families usually have... expectations."

Evelyn studied the brilliant AI scientist who'd somehow fallen for her socially awkward brother. The pieces didn't quite fit.

Somewhere between the champagne and forced merriment, a dangerous realization took root—this fairytale romance might be the most elaborate algorithm Donovan had ever engineered.
###Chapter 670 

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh softly. "You're overthinking it! Everyone in our family adores you, especially Donovan!"

At the mention of Donovan, Emily sighed dreamily, clasping her hands together. "I never imagined I'd actually marry my idol. I keep pinching myself to make sure I'm not dreaming."

Her smile was radiant, matching the bright winter sun that cast a golden glow over them. Though the air was crisp, the light was dazzling.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Donovan's the most composed person in our family, but he's always buried in work. If you ever feel lonely, come find me. We can go shopping or travel together."

She subtly hinted that Emily shouldn't break things off just because Donovan was busy.

Emily nodded eagerly, rubbing her hands together. "Um... Is Donovan wealthy?"

Evelyn blinked. After a brief pause, she quickly nodded.

"Absolutely. He has dividends from Sterling Enterprises, bonuses, and multiple investments. The liquid assets under his name alone are substantial."

Even if it was just for financial security, they had to keep Emily at all costs.

Emily swung her legs idly on the garden bench and giggled. "That's a relief."

Evelyn laughed but fell silent, unsure how to respond.

Footsteps approached from behind, followed by Donovan's dry remark. "How practical."

Emily stiffened and scrambled to her feet like a child caught sneaking candy. "G-Great God!"

Donovan narrowed his eyes at her. "If I weren't rich, would you dump me?"

"Of course not!" Emily denied instantly. "If anything, I'd cling to you even harder if you were broke."

Donovan smirked, clearly amused rather than offended. He extended his hand, and Emily hurried to take it.

He glanced at Evelyn. "Lin, I'll introduce Emily to the others. Your friend's here—you should go greet her."

'Is Natalie here?' Evelyn nodded, lifting the hem of her dress as she hurried off.

Natalie carried herself with effortless confidence, draped in a limited-edition coat from a high-end designer. Her presence was magnetic, her smile warm as she exchanged pleasantries with William.

William treated her like a daughter, letting her roam freely. Evelyn dashed over and threw herself into Natalie's arms.

"Nat! What took you so long?"

Natalie chuckled. "I came as fast as I could."

Lucas, standing behind Evelyn, coughed pointedly and pried her off Natalie.

"Evie, do you have any idea how heavy you are?"

Evelyn shot him a glare—she was officially disowning her brother.

Turning back to Natalie, she asked pointedly, "When's your boyfriend coming back?" She couldn't resist needling Lucas.

His expression darkened.

Natalie glanced between the siblings and laughed. "Probably in two or three months. He's booked solid with runway shows—it's a huge career opportunity."

Evelyn frowned. Adrian had always been well-known in the industry, but never this internationally sought-after. Overnight, his value had skyrocketed, and he was now a fixture at major fashion weeks.

The media couldn't get enough of him.

And every single booking had come through Natalie's connections. She was clearly pulling out all the stops to elevate his career.

"Let's talk inside. I'll make you coffee," Evelyn offered.

Lucas gritted his teeth, glaring at his sister.

She was insufferable.

Evelyn and Natalie headed inside, settling on the second-floor balcony. From their vantage point, they watched William mingle with guests, his smile never faltering.

Lucas lingered nearby, grinding coffee beans but stealing frequent glances at the women.

Evelyn pursed her lips. "Is Adrian reliable?"
###Chapter 671

Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont were so close they shared everything. Natalie raised an eyebrow.

"Who knows?" Then why did you invest so much in him? Aren't you afraid of losing everything?"

Natalie's lips curled slightly. "If I promote him, he'll earn far more than what I put in."

She paused, her tone turning cool. "I can lift him up, and I can also let him fall."

Evelyn understood immediately. "You don’t actually care about him?"

Natalie laughed. "I do, but business comes first."

"Fair enough." Their shared glance said more than words ever could. Lucas still had potential, but Evelyn couldn’t help feeling a pang of sympathy for him.

If things kept going this way, even if Natalie and Lucas were together, he’d always be the one at her mercy.

Just as Evelyn was lost in thought, Lucas returned with coffee and sat between them. Both women blinked in surprise.

"I just learned how to make it," he said with a smile. "You won’t believe it until you see it."

Natalie chuckled. "Then we’re lucky. Thanks, Lucas."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. His attempt at being both humble and impressive was almost pathetic. But when Lucas shot her a warning look, she kept her amusement hidden.

Propping her chin on one hand, Evelyn watched Lucas work with Natalie, thinking, I’m such a good sister.

Lucas moved with practiced ease, adjusting the coffee to their preferences—more milk, less sugar for Evelyn, less milk and sugar for Natalie.

She had to admit, his hands were a work of art. Every movement was precise, elegant. No wonder he never used hand doubles—his fingers were flawless on camera.

God really favored him.

Evelyn watched as he finished Natalie’s cup. The aroma was rich, the beans imported from New Zealand—expensive beyond belief.

Natalie reached for it, but Lucas stopped her. "Wait."

With his left hand, he lifted the cup. With his right, he grabbed another, carefully drawing a robin in the milk froth. The wings looked almost real.

Evelyn gaped. Natalie froze for a second.

Lucas pushed the cup toward her. "Try it. The milk’s special—low fat, no sugar."

He’s really trying to impress her.

Natalie took it with a smile. "Lucas, this is professional-level latte art."

Her polite praise made his grin widen. "It’s nothing. Come by anytime you want coffee."

Evelyn coughed, finally reminding him she existed.

Lucas added her usual brand of creamer—the one she drank every day. Just as she expected him to craft something for her too, he simply slid the plain cup over.

No design. No effort.

Evelyn frowned. Is he even my brother?

Lucas nudged it closer. "Drink it before it gets cold. Don’t waste it."

She forced a smile. This is how he treats his sister?
###Chapter 672 

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't suppress her smirk. Seeing her sister's expression darken, Natalie Beaumont quickly intervened. "Lucas, Evelyn has been waiting forever for your latte art. How could you skip the best part?"

Lucas Sterling's brow furrowed as he glared at his troublesome sister. Since Natalie asked, he couldn't half-ass it now. "Fine, I'll make you one," he muttered through gritted teeth.

"I want a phoenix," Evelyn demanded with a challenging smirk.

Lucas's hands froze mid-pour. "I don't know how to draw a damn phoenix!" He'd practiced for weeks to perfect Natalie's hummingbird design. His face darkened as he fought the urge to flip the coffee table. "This little brat's determined to make me look bad. If my love life depends on her, I'll die alone."

The upstairs study became uncomfortably quiet, the cheerful laughter from downstairs creating stark contrast. Natalie sipped her espresso, sensing the tension crackling between the siblings. "Perhaps that's... ambitious for Lucas?"

Lucas shot his sister a meaningful look. "I could do a phoenix. But wouldn't a diamond ring design be more appropriate, Evelyn?" His tone carried a clear warning - she'd already gotten her precious jewelry from him, yet still dared to test his patience.

Evelyn's lips pursed. That diamond had been spectacularly expensive. For the sake of future gifts, she backed down. "Of course Lucas can do anything. A phoenix is child's play." Her sudden 180-degree attitude shift made Natalie choke on her coffee.

Their silent truce was interrupted by William Sterling's booming voice from downstairs. "Lucas! Evelyn! Get down here and greet our guests!"

"Lucas?" Evelyn barely contained her laughter at her brother's horrified expression. The nickname 'Lil L' clearly didn't sit well with the famous actor, but he couldn't refuse their father. Natalie dissolved into giggles.

The siblings exchanged a resigned look, suddenly united in their dread. The annual parade of distant relatives had arrived. Natalie waved them off. "Go ahead. I'll stay here enjoying this excellent coffee."

Lucas stood with forced calm, though irritation radiated from every pore. "I've told Father a hundred times not to call me that. Why doesn't he call Donovan 'Lil D'?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why doesn't Father make Alexander entertain them?" Because their eldest brother would freeze the guests with his glacial stare and sarcastic remarks, that's why. William had long stopped expecting social graces from Alexander.

With synchronized sighs, the siblings descended the staircase, plastering on identical polite smiles. William entered with a dozen relatives in tow, beaming with pride. "Evelyn, Lucas, say hello to everyone."

The siblings froze when they saw Charles Sterling at the front of the group. "Hello, Uncle Charles," they chorused automatically as the older man nodded and swept past to the living room.

Then came the awkward part. Evelyn and Lucas shared a panicked glance - they didn't recognize a single other person in the crowd.

William shot them a disappointed look before stepping forward with his host smile. "This is your great-aunt's second husband's cousin. This is your third cousin twice removed. This is the daughter of your maternal grandfather's business partner's niece..."
###Chapter 673 

Lucas Sterling and Evelyn Sinclair felt like human mannequins. Their cheeks ached from forced smiles, yet they kept greeting relatives with practiced politeness.

Evelyn never smiled this much during business negotiations.

Her facial muscles were on the verge of rebellion.

Lucas, the famously aloof A-list actor worshipped by millions, endured the same torment. After introducing countless distant relatives, William Sterling finally felt his throat dry up.

Fortunately, the butler appeared with tea. "Chairman Sterling, refreshments are served."

William practically shoved everyone inside. "Hurry, hurry! Make yourselves comfortable!" He downed his tea in one gulp before smoothly guiding Evelyn and Lucas into the grand hall.

Then came the proud father routine.

"This is my Evelyn. She runs Sterling Enterprises. Alexander just assists her." William puffed his chest. "My daughter made the Forbes global list last year. Quite the achievement, isn't it?"

Envious murmurs filled the room. William beamed.

"My second son Donovan dislikes social gatherings. He's a scientist—won several international awards, contributed to classified government projects." William waved dismissively. "Though he's hopeless at everything else."

Knowing Donovan would drop verbal bombs if forced to attend, William focused on his two more sociable children.

Their great-aunt pinched Evelyn's cheek.

"Evelyn dear, you're constantly trending online. Who are you really dating? That young actor Julian Moreau seems immature. Is Xavier Delmont just Nathan Blackwood's replacement?"

All eyes locked onto Evelyn—some teasing, some malicious, all hungry for drama.

The room fell silent.

William nearly choked on his tea. Just as he prepared to intervene, Evelyn casually removed the old woman's hand.

Her smile remained, but her voice turned arctic. "You seem more invested than the tabloids."

Lucas covertly gave her a thumbs-up. Damn, Evelyn just roasted an elder without hesitation. Legendary.

Had he tried that, William would've tanned his hide publicly.

The relatives visibly recoiled. Earlier, William had emphasized Evelyn's position as Sterling Enterprises' true CEO. No one dared challenge her now.

William attempted damage control. "Don't believe internet gossip! Evelyn's just having fun with those men. Nothing serious!"

Lucas' eyebrows shot up. That's your idea of smoothing things over? You just poured gasoline on the fire!

Evelyn's eye twitched. Further explanations were pointless.

The great-aunt sighed dramatically. "Divorce isn't ideal, but with our wealth, finding another divorced man shouldn't be hard." She patted Evelyn's shoulder. "Lower your standards if needed—single fathers are acceptable too."

Evelyn thought bitterly, Why not just suggest stoning me to death and be done with it?
###Chapter 674 

The tension in the room dropped to subzero. Evelyn had no patience left for further conversation. She turned on her heel and walked out.

Lucas followed close behind.

The siblings retreated to Natalie’s quarters. Noticing Natalie’s melancholy expression, Lucas offered, "Let me play you something."

There was a grand piano on the second floor, rarely used. William had placed it there purely for aesthetics—to fill the empty space.

Lucas approached the instrument with effortless grace, seating himself like a prince straight out of a fairy tale. His striking features and regal demeanor could silence any room.

Then, his fingers danced across the keys.

The melody flowed effortlessly—gentle, fluid, mesmerizing. His hands moved with precision, each note resonating with emotion.

On the balcony, Evelyn heard the music and sighed.

Poor Lucas.

Natalie frowned. "Is that Lucas playing?"

Evelyn nodded, raising a brow.

Natalie listened intently, her expression shifting to something more complex. "How can a serenade sound so full of resentment?"

Evelyn was surprised she could detect it.

Charming.

She stifled a laugh. Natalie really is Lucas’s kindred spirit.

Just then, Leo scrambled up from somewhere, his big, watery eyes fixed on Evelyn.

He looked utterly wronged.

"Mama! Mean Emily bullied me!"

Leo can whine now?

Evelyn scooped him up with one hand, stroking his soft fur. "I’m not getting rid of her for you."

"You have to be nice to Emily. She’s family now."

Leo blinked rapidly, his whiskers twitching in protest.

No! I refuse to be stuck with Mean Emily!

Natalie took Leo into her arms, petting him gently.

"He’s so warm—like a real tiger!"

"Aside from not eating, he’s practically the real deal," Evelyn mused fondly.

Leo, however, remained inconsolable. His head drooped as he chanted under his breath.

"Break up! Break up!"

Make them break up!

I don’t wanna be with Mean Emily!

Evelyn and Natalie burst into laughter.

"You asking for trouble, little traitor?" Emily’s voice cut through the air, sharp with irritation.

Evelyn smirked as Leo immediately cowered into Natalie’s arms.

Emily stalked closer, snatching him up with one hand. She glared at him.

"Keep this up, and I’ll turn you into a mouse."

"No, no, no! I don’t wanna be a mouse! Mama, save me!"

Leo flailed wildly, his tiny legs kicking in panic. He looked so pitiful that Evelyn’s heart softened.

She took him back. "Emily, don’t scare him."

Emily pursed her lips. "If you spoil him like this, he’ll develop a full-blown human ego."

No surprise there.

Still, no one had the heart to discipline the little troublemaker.

Evelyn shrugged. "He’s fine."

Emily sat across from Natalie. The two exchanged polite nods.

"Emily Whitaker."

"Natalie Beaumont."

Evelyn watched, amused.

Will they both end up as my sisters-in-law one day?

Fate works in funny ways.

A knowing smile played on her lips.

Emily hesitated, then turned to Evelyn.

"Nikki, the Great God has always been terrible with people. I didn’t even greet the relatives downstairs. They won’t hold it against me, will they?"
###Chapter 675

Evelyn paused for a beat. "Of course not! They're incredibly open-minded. Don't waste energy worrying about what others think. Just match Donovan's energy."

In the Sterling family, no one dared to challenge Donovan's authority. Emily exhaled in relief, her lips curving into a smile.

"That's a relief. This is my first time here, after all. My mother drilled it into me—be charming, be helpful, then seal the deal."

Emily sighed dramatically. "But there's literally no stage for me to shine!"

Evelyn and Natalie exchanged glances. Natalie barely suppressed a laugh. "Adrian's girlfriend is refreshingly honest, huh?"

Evelyn chuckled inwardly. Emily had been even bolder in the garden earlier, openly admitting her ambitions to marry into wealth. But this raw honesty? Surprisingly comfortable.

Far better than the sycophantic socialites who littered high society.

"Emily's adorable. My brother's never shown interest in anyone before. The fact that he's smitten with her? Her personality outshines every other woman on the planet."

Emily immediately straightened, a giggle escaping her. "Evie, tone down the flattery. You're making me blush!"

Leo, curled in Evelyn's arms, peeked out with narrowed eyes. Liar. Mean Emily's a liar.

Emily shot the robotic tiger a warning glare. Leo ducked back into Evelyn's arms, trembling. Terrifying.

The group's laughter filled the hallway, oblivious to the figure approaching from the stairs, drawn by the noise.

"Cousin, you're here."

Evelyn's brows lifted. Among the earlier relatives, there had been one polished young woman—barely memorable. New Year's Eve meant Floyd had invited extended family, so Evelyn kept her expression neutral.

"Cousin?"

The woman stepped forward, sweetness dripping from her voice. "I've been studying abroad, so I rarely visit for the holidays. But before I left Montecito, I came every year. I'm Alexandra. We practically grew up together—"

Evelyn wracked her brain. No recollection. Still, she smiled. "Right. Alexandra."

Alexandra beamed. "You remember! That makes this easier."

Her attention snapped to Leo. "Is that a tiger?"

Oh my God. People keep horses, birds, even monkeys—but the Sterlings have a tiger?

Rich people hobbies are on another level.

Evelyn laughed. "It's an AI robot. Not real." She tapped Leo's head. "Say hello."

Leo reluctantly poked its head out, blinking cutely. "Greetings, Madam."

Alexandra flinched. "Madam? Just 'Miss' is fine—"

She reached for Leo, but the tiger went rigid, playing dead in Evelyn's arms. Alexandra's hand hovered awkwardly mid-air.

"Can I... hold it?"

Evelyn hesitated.

Reluctantly, she passed Leo over. Alexandra cradled it eagerly, stroking its fur. A thought flickered—I should take this home.
###Chapter 676

Alexandra gasped. "It's so lifelike! The fur feels just like the real thing. And it's warm too. If it didn't talk, I'd swear this was an actual tiger!"

Evelyn Sinclair smirked, raising an eyebrow. She'd had the same reaction when she first met Leo.

"Where did you get this robotic tiger?" Alexandra pressed, her eyes gleaming with curiosity.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "It was a gift."

"From who?" Alexandra leaned in eagerly.

Silence stretched between them. Evelyn shot her cousin a cold look, her smile vanishing. Her silence was answer enough—she wasn't pleased with the prying.

But Alexandra, ever tactless, pushed further. "If it's just a gift, why not give it to me? It's adorable! If I post about it online, it'll go viral for sure!"

Evelyn's lips thinned. Her voice turned icy. "It was given to me. I don’t just hand over personal gifts."

Alexandra scoffed. "Come on, the Sterlings could buy a hundred of these. You could even get a real tiger if you wanted. Why be so stingy over a robot?"

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "What I want is what matters. Now, give Leo back." She held out her hand, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Alexandra hesitated, clutching Leo tighter and stepping back. She wasn’t giving up that easily. "Evelyn, your father’s always been generous with us. Let’s ask Uncle William—he’ll let me have it!"

She was banking on William Sterling’s kindness—after all, he’d paid for her overseas education without hesitation. Surely a robotic tiger was nothing in comparison.

Evelyn’s face hardened. No pleasantries left.

"Give. It. Back." Her outstretched hand didn’t waver. The air around her turned frigid.

Alexandra faltered, but the thought of going viral with this tiger was too tempting. She hugged Leo tighter, spun on her heel, and bolted for the stairs.

Emily Whitaker, who had been watching the scene with amusement, finally stood, slamming her hands on the table.

"Little traitor! You gonna let yourself get kidnapped without a fight? Where’s your pride?"

In a flash, Leo snapped to attention. With a fierce twist, he wrenched free from Alexandra’s grip and leaped straight into Evelyn’s arms.

"I’m a fierce tiger!" he declared, puffing out his mechanical chest.

Evelyn exhaled, stroking his head approvingly. Good. He had some fight in him after all.

Alexandra’s arms were empty. She stared at the scratch on her forearm, her face paling before flushing with outrage.

"You—you scratched me?!"

Leo had been forced into attack mode to escape her death grip. Now, he lifted his chin proudly.

"Attack level one. Combat power level one. Reaction speed—maximum. I’m a smart tiger, and I don’t go home with strangers!"

Emily smirked. "My designs aren’t just for show. If it can’t defend itself, how’s it supposed to be king of the jungle?"

Alexandra’s eyes widened. "You designed this?"

Then it hit her—William had introduced Emily as a world-class scientist earlier. Reality crashed down.

"Then… can you make me one? A gentler version?"

Emily arched a brow. "You paying for it?"

Alexandra hesitated. "Uh… money?"
###Chapter 677

Alexandra Montgomery blinked in shock when Emily Whitaker stated, "A robotic tiger like this costs at least nine figures. If you're not paying for it, did you honestly think I'd just hand it over?"

Alexandra's face drained of color. That astronomical number made her stomach drop.

She glanced down at the expensive mechanical beast and immediately recoiled, afraid to even brush against it. "We're family, though. Can't you give me a discount?" she mumbled under her breath.

The entire room froze.

How shameless can she be? Evelyn Sinclair thought, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. Why do I have relatives like this? Natalie Beaumont kept her head down, sipping her coffee in silence. Evelyn deliberately turned away, pretending not to know Alexandra.

Emily arched a brow. "Excuse me? This isn't a flea market. Bargaining isn't an option here."

Alexandra's shoulders slumped in defeat—just as William Sterling entered, holding little Oliver Sinclair's hand.

"Evelyn, Oliver was playing outside. Take him to wash up," William said casually.

Evelyn seized the moment. "Of course!"

Alexandra wasn't about to let this chance slip. Even if she couldn't afford it, Uncle William certainly could! She rushed forward, dramatically clutching her arm. "Uncle William!"

Only then did he notice her. "Alexandra, you're here too. Well, have fun with the girls—"

He turned to leave, completely missing her theatrics.

"Uncle William!" she stomped her foot, tears welling up. "This fake tiger scratched me!"

The three women at the table exchanged stunned glances. Oliver blinked in confusion.

William finally glanced at her raised arm, narrowing his eyes. "Where?"

Alexandra shoved her arm in his face, pointing to a faint red mark. "Right here!"

William squinted. "My eyesight isn't what it used to be. Can't see a thing. Just put some ointment on it—you'll be fine. It's a robot, not a real tiger. No need for rabies shots." He chuckled, waving at Evelyn. "Evelyn, have someone fetch her some cream."

Before Evelyn could respond, Alexandra blurted out, "Uncle William, can you buy me one of these tigers?"

The audacity was breathtaking.

William paused, then deadpanned, "Absolutely not. This thing has violent tendencies. It scratched your arm today—what if it mauls your face tomorrow?"

Alexandra gaped, speechless.

The others barely stifled their laughter.

Brilliant. Evelyn had to hand it to her father. When dealing with a scheming little brat, he knew exactly how to shut her down without lifting a finger.

Once William left, Evelyn offered Alexandra a polite smile. "The butler downstairs can get you that ointment."

Basic manners were still necessary—even for unwelcome guests. A scene would only ruin William's New Year.

The moment Alexandra stormed off, the room collectively exhaled, bursting into laughter.

Oliver giggled, hugging Leo tightly. "Big Tiger, come wash hands with me!"

The mechanical tiger preened under the praise, puffing up with pride at being called Big Tiger. "Okay!" Oliver set it down, and Leo strutted away, tail flicking arrogantly.

Everyone adored the ridiculous display—except Emily, who rolled her eyes.

This dumb tiger really...

The mechanical tiger's eyes flickered with an eerie blue glow.

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step, her breath catching in her throat.

Just moments ago, this artificial creature had been snarling at her with undisguised hostility. Now its posture had shifted completely - head bowed, tail still, in a posture of submission.

Nathan Blackwood's grip tightened on Evelyn's arm. "Don't move," he murmured.

The tiger's metallic plating rippled as it took a hesitant step forward.

Vanessa Holloway's shrill voice cut through the tension. "What's wrong with it? Attack her!" She jabbed a manicured finger toward Evelyn.

But the AI creature ignored its programmed commands. Instead, it nuzzled against Evelyn's leg with an unexpected gentleness.

Margaret Blackwood gasped. "That's impossible! It's never responded like this to anyone."

The tiger's sensors whirred as it studied Evelyn with unsettling intensity. Then it did something no one anticipated.

It spoke.

"Master recognized," the mechanical voice announced. "Primary protocol activated."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "I... I don't understand."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Who programmed this thing?"

The tiger's tail swished as it positioned itself protectively in front of Evelyn, turning to face Vanessa with a low, threatening growl.

Vanessa stumbled backward. "This wasn't part of the deal! That machine was supposed to-"

"Silence!" The tiger's voice modulator crackled with authority. "Threat to Master detected. Defense protocols engaged."

Evelyn reached out instinctively, her fingers brushing the cool metal plating. "Wait," she whispered.

The tiger immediately stilled, awaiting her command.

Nathan's jaw tightened as he surveyed the bizarre scene. "Someone explain this. Now."

But no one could.

Least of all Evelyn, who found herself staring into the glowing eyes of a machine that somehow recognized her as its rightful owner - despite never having seen it before in her life.

The tiger's next words sent chills down every spine in the room:

"Master Evelyn Sinclair. Security breach detected in sector seven. Your presence is required."

Then it did the unthinkable.

It bowed.
###Chapter 678 

Evelyn laughed. "Leo is our family treasure!"

Emily raised her eyebrows and sighed helplessly. "I saw that you guys bought him a scarf worth tens of thousands and that watch must be in the millions, right? Tsk, tsk… this little traitor only respects wealth!"

Female friendships formed unexpectedly. After that manipulative witch Alexandra made such a scene, Natalie and Emily naturally grew closer.

The sky darkened, but Sterling Manor remained brilliantly lit, buzzing with energy. Natalie checked the time and decided to video call someone. Evelyn glanced over and caught Adrian Prescott’s name on the screen, but no one answered. Natalie tried again—still nothing. Her expression shifted slightly.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Maybe he’s busy?"

Natalie hesitated before forcing a distracted smile. "He doesn’t have a show at this hour. He should be at the hotel."

From across the room, Lucas scoffed as he peeled an apple. "Being at the hotel isn’t the problem. The problem is who he’s with."

Evelyn and Natalie shot him identical glares.

Lucas merely shrugged. He was just stating facts.

They talked well into the night. The butler and maids bustled around, managing the buffet in the dining hall. Some relatives, however, demanded to be served, forcing the elderly butler to shuffle back and forth until exhaustion lined his face.

Lucas couldn’t stand it. He stepped in, delivering plates himself. The guests immediately stopped their demands—no one dared trouble the youngest Sterling heir.

Eventually, they served themselves.

Evelyn and Natalie were deep in conversation when Lucas suddenly shouted from the doorway. "Evie! Someone’s setting off fireworks!"

She turned. It was likely the butler’s doing.

Evelyn started toward Lucas at a leisurely pace, but he waved urgently. "They’ve got your name on them! Is this some grand romantic gesture?"

Her pulse jumped. She quickened her steps.

The night sky exploded with custom-made fireworks—elaborate, three-dimensional displays that stole everyone’s breath. Conversations died mid-sentence as guests rushed outside.

Massive hydrangea-shaped bursts illuminated half the city. Then, smaller fireworks at the center rearranged themselves, spelling out "Evelyn" in shimmering letters. The surrounding lights didn’t fade.

Instead—

The night sky exploded with dazzling lights that shimmered like celestial diamonds.

The fireworks morphed into glowing letters that spelled out "Nathan" in bold strokes. There was no mystery left—Nathan Blackwood had signed his grand gesture across the heavens himself.

Evelyn Sinclair's breath caught in her throat.

The display didn't fade. Instead, the sparks rearranged themselves into a perfect caricature of Evelyn's face—her delicate features, the subtle curve of her lips—all illuminated against the dark canvas of night.

This wasn't ordinary pyrotechnics.

Cutting-edge technology had crafted this spectacle, ensuring it would be remembered as the most breathtaking moment of the New Year celebrations.

Then snow began falling in thick flurries.

The combination of swirling white and vibrant colors created an ethereal scene—beautiful yet chilling.

Evelyn wasn't moved by the display's grandeur.

Her stomach twisted when she saw Nathan's name blazing above her.

Typical Nathan—always making grand gestures at the worst possible times, convinced he was being romantic.

Disgusting.
###Chapter 679

Gasps echoed through the room. "Oh my God! Evelyn, are you and Nathan back together?" "This is too perfect!"

"Mr. Blackwood is so romantic!" "That fireworks display must have cost a fortune. He's declaring his love for you all over again." "Mr. Blackwood never misses a detail." A group of younger women watched with envy burning in their eyes.

"I wonder if Mr. Blackwood is proposing. Evelyn, say yes! This is beyond romantic—" Lucas took one look at Evelyn's icy expression and immediately stepped in. "What’s with all the squealing? My sister has received grand gestures like this a hundred times before."

"You think a little fireworks show is enough to impress her? Please. Evelyn has seen it all." His dismissive tone was like a bucket of ice water dumped over their excitement. What moved them to tears was nothing but routine for Evelyn.

The gap between them was painfully obvious. Natalie laughed. "Exactly. Didn’t we prepare fireworks too? Archibald, hurry up and set them off before the snow ruins the effect."

It seemed the only way to shift attention was to outshine Nathan’s display. The butler nodded and rushed outside—only to freeze at the sight of someone at the door.

Even after Evelyn cursed Nathan under her breath, her pulse refused to steady. She clenched her fists, forcing her emotions down. Natalie scrolled through her phone, watching the fireworks trend explode online.

"Evelyn, Nathan did this on purpose, didn’t he?" Evelyn glanced at the screen, lips pressed tight, then snatched up her phone and dialed Dominic Kingsley. "Get PR ready. I don’t want tonight’s spectacle leaking anywhere."

There was no doubt—this wasn’t just a gesture for her. It was a power play, a claim. But Evelyn refused to let him win. She would smother this spectacle before it spread.

Her phone rang again. The caller ID made her blood boil. She stormed upstairs and answered. "Nathan Blackwood. Did you get hit in the head with a brick?" She kept her voice low, sharp.

Nathan hadn’t expected to be greeted with fury. His voice softened, warm and smooth like aged whiskey. "You saw it? Did you like it?"

"I didn’t see it. And no, I didn’t."

A beat of silence.

"Then I’ll have them do it again."

Her eyebrow twitched. "Don’t you dare."

"Wasn’t embarrassing enough for you?"

His deep chuckle grated on her nerves. "Fine. I’ll listen to you." The way he said it—like a vow, like surrender—made her chest tighten.

Her voice turned glacial. "Your little show just forced employees to work overtime during the holidays. Nathan, stop being an idiot."

Silence stretched for over ten seconds before he sighed. "I didn’t mean it like that. I just wanted to make you smile. Happy New Year, Evelyn."

She paused. "If that’s all, I’m hanging up."

"Looking back… we never spent a single New Year together, did we? I was always out of the country." His voice roughened with something like regret.

Evelyn scoffed. "Of course you were. Either on ‘business trips’ or vacations with friends—anything to avoid me."

Every holiday, he left her alone to face the Blackwoods’ disdain. Margaret would sneer that her son refused to come home because of Evelyn. The rest of the family treated her like an inconvenience.

She never wanted to relive those years of swallowing her pride. She had been miserable. And she refused to go back.
###Chapter 680 

Silence stretched on the other end of the call.

Every word Evelyn spoke cut deeper into Nathan's heart. Even after all this time, her careless condemnation still wounded him like fresh blades.

He sought out this pain deliberately, as if punishing himself during what should have been a joyous celebration.

When Evelyn grew impatient and threatened to hang up, Nathan finally spoke again, his voice rough.

"Evelyn. I need to see you."

She scoffed.

"I don't want to see you."

"I'm outside your gates. Let me in."

He didn't give her a chance to refuse. From his car, he watched the lively scene unfolding in the Sterling Manor courtyard—people laughing, fireworks bursting against the snowy sky.

None of that warmth belonged to him.

Evelyn paused mid-step. Why today of all days? Shouldn't the Blackwoods be busy with their own celebrations?

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

"I won't open the door. Leave."

Nathan chuckled darkly and restarted the engine.

Too late.

The gates were already swinging open.

Evelyn stiffened. The call had disconnected. She hurried down the path, certain the butler wouldn't dare let Nathan in without her permission.

In the courtyard, Lucas Sterling carried little Oliver on his shoulders while the others laughed nearby.

At the entrance, Archibald watched helplessly as the Range Rover rolled through the gates—opened by Alexandra Montgomery, who had dashed over without warning.

How do I explain this to Evelyn?

"You can't just open the gates without Chairman Sterling or Ms. Sinclair's orders," Archibald protested.

Alexandra waved him off. "That's Nathan Blackwood. Do you really think locked gates would stop him?"

"But Ms. Sinclair explicitly—"

"Enough," Alexandra snapped. "You're just staff. Don't overstep. Mr. Blackwood might be here on business. Are you prepared to handle the consequences if you turn him away?"

She turned, spotting the man stepping out of the car.

Dressed in black, he looked like a shadow given form—regal, imposing, effortlessly commanding the space around him.

Alexandra rushed forward with an umbrella, shielding him from the snow. Her cheeks flushed.

"Mr. Blackwood, please come in—"

Nathan adjusted his coat collar and gave her a polite nod. His gaze flickered with mild confusion.

"Who are you?"

The new maid?

Alexandra straightened. "I'm Alexandra Montgomery. Evelyn's cousin."

Nathan's expression softened.

"Hello."

Luckily, he hadn't voiced his earlier assumption.

Alexandra hadn't expected him to smile at her. This was the closest she'd ever been to Nathan Blackwood, and the proximity sent her pulse racing.

"The fireworks earlier were stunning," she gushed. "We all saw them. You're so thoughtful, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan walked past her, the ghost of a smirk on his lips. Though Evelyn's cousin grated on his nerves, he forced patience.

All for Evelyn's sake.

"Thanks."

William Sterling and the others turned at Nathan's approach. William's brows lifted in surprise.

"Mr. Blackwood? What brings you here?"

His gaze flicked to Archibald, who stood stiffly, shooting Alexandra a pointed look.

The butler stayed silent.

Nathan's smile remained cool, his demeanor every bit the untouchable aristocrat.

But when he met William's eyes, he dipped into a respectful bow.

"Happy New Year, Chairman Sterling. I came to pay my respects."
###Chapter 681

Nathan Blackwood's lips curved into an unexpected smile. The clock hadn't even struck midnight, yet here he was delivering New Year's greetings like some eager schoolboy.

William Sterling couldn't ignore the gesture. "How... thoughtful. Alexander, please escort Mr. Blackwood inside—"

Alexander Sterling extended his hand stiffly. "This way, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan nodded. "Happy New Year, brother."

Alexander's polite mask cracked. "Your enthusiasm is... overwhelming." He turned sharply, leading the way without another word.

Evelyn Sinclair descended the staircase and froze. Her expression darkened instantly when she spotted Nathan standing in the foyer. The entire Sterling family stared at their unexpected guest with varying degrees of shock. Several younger female relatives clutched their chests, visibly swooning.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn. For the first time all evening, his smile reached his eyes. "Happy New Year, Evelyn."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "How... punctual of you to deliver New Year's wishes at this hour, Mr. Blackwood. Forgive our lack of preparation."

Nathan chuckled. That they'd opened the gates at all was more than he'd hoped for. "I knew you were angry with me. I couldn't sleep thinking about it."

Truthfully, he hadn't planned to come. Theodore had accompanied him to watch the fireworks display downtown. But when the last spark faded from the sky, Nathan found himself dialing Evelyn's number. Hearing her voice had shattered his restraint. He'd left Theodore on the sidewalk and driven straight to Sterling Manor.

Only one thought consumed him: See her. Now.

The moment his eyes found Evelyn in the grand foyer, the restless energy that had plagued him all evening finally settled.

Evelyn's posture remained rigid. As if anyone would believe that flimsy excuse.

Alexander cleared his throat pointedly. "Mr. Blackwood, perhaps we should continue this in the drawing room? More privacy there."

"Of course. Thank you... brother."

Alexander's eye twitched at the repeated familial address. These two men knew each other too well—had clashed too often in boardrooms and business deals to pretend otherwise. Nathan's polished charm and impeccable manners grated on Alexander's nerves. He shot Evelyn a pleading look—get rid of him before I lose my temper.

Alexandra Montgomery saw her chance and moved to follow, but Lucas Sterling blocked her path with a deceptively pleasant smile. "You're not needed in there."

Alexandra fluttered her lashes. "But it's so rare for Mr. Blackwood to visit. Wouldn't it be rude not to greet him properly?"

Lucas's smile didn't reach his eyes. "He came to see the Sterlings. Are you a Sterling?"

The unspoken warning hung between them: Don't overstep.

Alexandra paled. Lucas laughed lightly and gestured toward the sitting room. "Why don't you keep Aunt Beatrice company? The car will take you home at dawn."

Nathan recognized his tenuous welcome. One glimpse of Evelyn would have to suffice. After finishing his tea with remarkable speed, he rose to leave.

The moment the front door closed behind Nathan, Alexander stormed off without a backward glance. Evelyn turned—and found Alexandra lingering by the entrance, staring wistfully at the gates.

The longing on Alexandra's face was unmistakable.

Evelyn walked past her without breaking stride.

Alexandra couldn't resist. "Evelyn! Why did Mr. Blackwood really come? To beg for reconciliation? Are you getting remarried?"

Evelyn stopped. Adjusted her shawl with deliberate slowness. Then fixed Alexandra with a gaze that could freeze fire.

"Who gave you permission to open those gates?"
###Chapter 682

Evelyn Sinclair's expression darkened. "I-I just... He was at the door. Was I supposed to turn him away? Besides, the butler approved it too."

She thought quickly - better to shift blame.

Nathan Blackwood's voice turned icy, devoid of any respect. "Really? The butler agreed? Shall we summon him here to confirm?"

A visible tremor ran through Alexandra Montgomery's lips as her face betrayed unease.

"What kind of man is Mr. Blackwood? How could we possibly refuse him?"

"I don't need your opinion on his character. In future, refrain from making decisions about matters that don't concern you."

Without another glance, Evelyn turned on her heel and left. She'd already shown remarkable restraint - it was only the holiday season that spared Alexandra from immediate dismissal.

Snowflakes swirled around Nathan's car as he drove home, an uncharacteristic smile playing on his lips.

Theodore Winslow, half-frozen, finally spotted the approaching headlights. He practically threw himself into the warm interior.

"M-Mr. Blackwood!" His teeth chattered violently. "You can't abandon me like this! I'd have turned into an icicle!"

Though the car's heating couldn't instantly thaw him, it beat standing in the blizzard. Nathan merely hummed in acknowledgment, his good mood evident.

"Double your year-end bonus."

Theodore's shivering ceased immediately. Suddenly, the cold didn't seem so unbearable.

At Aspen Lodge, Reginald Blackwood sat stiffly in the parlor after ending another tedious holiday call. What should have been a festive atmosphere felt more like a morgue.

Charles Blackwood had long since relocated overseas, permanently stationed at a company there. Having escaped his mother Margaret's controlling grasp, he wasn't about to return voluntarily to face his father's temper.

With Nathan now heir apparent, Charles saw no reason to interfere. His sole remaining purpose? Enjoying his freedom and spending the family fortune.

When Nathan arrived, he tossed the keys to Theodore. "Go home."

The butler visibly relaxed at Nathan's return. "Welcome back, Young Master—"

Nathan strode past him without acknowledgment, finding his grandfather waiting with thunderous expression.

"Where have you been?" The old man's anger had been simmering all day. Between the surveillance and Nathan's blatant disregard for family obligations, Reginald's patience had worn thin.

Nathan remained impassive. "Out for a drive."

Reginald slammed his iPad onto the table. "A drive? To Sterling Manor, perhaps? The entire city's talking about how you lit up the sky with fireworks for Evelyn Sinclair!"

A cold smirk twisted Nathan's lips. "Isn't this what you wanted?"

Get close to the Sterlings. Reconcile with Evelyn.

Precisely Reginald's agenda.

The old man's face purpled with rage. "I didn't tell you to debase yourself! The CEO of Blackwood Industries groveling after a woman - and one whose family treats you with contempt!"

How could the Blackwoods maintain their standing with such humiliation?

Nathan's laugh held no warmth. "Using underhanded tactics against a woman - now that's what I call debasing."

The barb struck its mark. Reginald shot to his feet, hand trembling as he pointed accusingly. "You—"
###Chapter 683

Nathan's words struck Reginald Blackwood like a slap across the face. The audacity!

The butler rushed forward to intervene. "Sir, please calm down. The Young Master meant no disrespect. He's acting in Blackwood Industries' best interest."

He turned to Nathan with pleading eyes. "Young Master, your grandfather's health is fragile. Any agitation could land him in intensive care."

Nathan hesitated, his defiant expression softening. "My apologies, Grandfather. You should rest now."

He couldn't bear the thought of actually harming the old man who'd raised him.

Reginald remained seated on the sofa, struggling to compose himself. "Nathan... I won't interfere with Evelyn anymore. But bring your sister home."

His aged hands trembled with emotion. "It's the holidays, and Sophia's out there alone. What if something happens to her? She's suffered enough punishment already. Must she remain exiled forever?"

Though Reginald loved his granddaughter, family interests had always taken precedence. Sophia's past behavior had warranted discipline, but now...

With Nathan becoming increasingly rebellious and both Margaret and Charles absent, Reginald found himself missing Sophia's presence.

Nathan frowned slightly. It had been months since Sophia's banishment. His surveillance team reported her behavior had improved - not perfect, but acceptable. "Fine. If you wish to see her, I'll arrange her return."

He pulled out his phone to summon the guards. Reginald finally relaxed, some color returning to his face.

Once the arrangements were made, Nathan retreated upstairs, unwilling to risk further confrontation. His phone buzzed incessantly with notifications.

Tristan Whitmore alone had sent ninety-nine messages. Nathan nearly ignored them all until his thumb accidentally tapped a voice memo.

"Blackwood, you're still making headlines during the holidays? First Evelyn bought every billboard in the city for you. Now this citywide fireworks display? Must you be so dramatic?"

Nathan's lips twitched. What did these fools understand about true devotion?

Another message appeared: "But take my advice - if you keep simping this hard, you'll end up with nothing!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. He exited the chat with a derisive snort. 'Tristan should worry about his own failed marriage. Serves him right!'

The remaining messages were all holiday greetings he couldn't care less about.

Logging into social media, he discovered the trending fireworks spectacle had vanished completely within two hours. No trace remained.

Typical Evelyn - her team handled crises with surgical precision. The media executives working tonight must be fuming.

Still, a few persistent comments lingered on Nathan's profile:

[That hashtag disappeared too fast! We demand more drama next time - use official channels so they can't censor it!]

[What a breathtaking display! Shame it got erased.]

[Rooting for you, Mr. Blackwood! But team Julian Moreau forever!]

[I pity you, but let's be honest - you're not worthy of President Sinclair.]
###Chapter 684 

Nathan Blackwood stared at his phone screen, his lips curling into a bitter smirk. His knuckles turned white from gripping the device too tightly. The flood of private messages and vicious comments showed no sign of stopping. With mainstream media outlets censoring the backlash, netizens had turned to social media to unleash their fury on him.

Exclusive content from NovelDreams Publishing.

Every single comment felt like a personal attack. "Who the hell is Julian Moreau? How dare they compare me to some pretty-boy actor?" Nathan's jaw clenched. "And they think Evelyn Sinclair and I aren't compatible? Are they blind?" Out of thousands of comments, only a handful defended him. Furious, he slammed his phone onto the marble countertop.

The silence lasted exactly thirty seconds before he snatched the phone back up like a man possessed. He scrolled through the hateful comments with masochistic determination.

Then his fingers flew across the screen in rapid response: [Money talks, darling. That idol can't compete with my net worth.] [Evelyn's mine - your opinions are irrelevant.] [Name one person more worthy than me. Just one!] [Save your pity for someone who needs it.]

The internet exploded. Just as the scandal was dying down, Nathan's clapbacks reignited the firestorm. #NathanBlackwoodFightsBack trended worldwide within minutes. The billionaire saw nothing wrong with his behavior - wealth was his ultimate trump card, an indisputable advantage.

While most people spent New Year's Eve watching fireworks, half the internet was glued to Nathan's real-time feud with random commenters. The elusive CEO of Blackwood Industries actually engaging with trolls? Unheard of! The public had always viewed him as an untouchable corporate titan.

Yet despite his abrasive tone, people found his unfiltered responses oddly endearing. Nathan kept arguing, determined to prove through sheer financial dominance that he was Evelyn's perfect match.

At Sterling Manor, Evelyn struggled to stay awake, nursing her third espresso of the night. The adjoining hall buzzed with activity as guests played cards and laughed boisterously.

Natalie Beaumont rushed over, shoving her phone in Evelyn's face. "Sleep? Now?"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "What now?"

"Look!" Natalie thrust the screen closer. The trending hashtag jolted Evelyn awake more effectively than any caffeine.

Her face drained of color. "Has he lost his damn mind?"

Natalie rolled her eyes. "What do you think? Public opinion was already against you two, but now he's playing the relatable billionaire card. People are actually shipping you now! Some are even giving him dating advice!"

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "They should worry about their own lives instead of some capitalist's love life."

"Should we intervene?" Natalie suggested.

Evelyn paused. "Who dares control Nathan Blackwood? Forget it."

"You're just going to let this continue?"

Evelyn pulled out her own phone. "I'm checking what new products we can launch. Might as well capitalize on this free publicity."

Natalie gaped. The woman truly had dollar signs for eyeballs! Once Evelyn finalized tomorrow's product launch strategy, she relaxed slightly.

No matter how viral tonight's drama became, tomorrow's business announcements would dominate the headlines. She stretched and glanced around.

"Where's Oliver?"
###Chapter 685 

Natalie frowned. "Oliver was just here."

Evelyn froze mid-step and immediately straightened. "Let's split up and find him." She headed toward the garden where the boy often played. Twinkling fairy lights transformed the space into an enchanted forest, designed specifically for Oliver's whimsical tastes.

As Evelyn approached, she caught snippets of conversation from shadowy figures seated on a stone bench.

Just as she turned to leave, Oliver's name reached her ears. "That child must be Evelyn's illegitimate son with some unknown man."

"Obviously. Look how the Sterlings dote on him. They indulge his every whim. Would they treat an outsider with such affection?"

"How could Evelyn stoop so low?" "No wonder the Blackwoods kicked her out!" "Yet Nathan still came tonight. Why would he want such a tainted woman?"

"Rich marriages are all about alliances. They'll each have their affairs anyway. Lucky for her she was born wealthy." "William must be ashamed. She's nothing like our Alexandra."

Evelyn stood rooted, icy fury creeping through her veins. For the first time, she understood the depths of her own restraint. These vipers smiled to her face while stabbing her in the back.

Snowflakes dusted Evelyn's shoulders as bitter laughter threatened to escape. This year kept delivering priceless moments.

"Pretty Lady!" Oliver's voice rang out from the darkness. The gossiping matrons shrieked, whirling to find Evelyn's glacial smile inches away. Their faces drained of color.

"E-Evelyn! W-when did you—"

Her voice cut sharper than winter wind. "Didn't your mothers teach you not to bite the hand that feeds you?"

The women trembled like autumn leaves. "M-misunderstanding! We heard rumors—"

"Rumors?" Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Oliver's existence isn't public knowledge. Where exactly did these 'rumors' originate?"

Their panicked glances darted toward the mansion's golden glow. "You heard nothing! We said nothing!"

One grabbed the other's arm. "Let's go inside!" If they denied everything, what could one woman prove?

Evelyn's eyes darkened as they scurried away. Inside, William beckoned guests toward lavish refreshments, the cheerful scene a stark contrast to the garden's revelations.
###Chapter 686 

Evelyn Sinclair glanced up. Little Oliver rubbed his sleepy eyes. "Beautiful Lady, I still haven't given you my gift yet. Just wait a moment."

She smiled softly and stepped inside at a leisurely pace. William Sterling shot her a disapproving look. "How many times must I remind you?"

His voice carried that familiar sternness. "It's freezing outside. You should know better than to go out without proper layers—"

Evelyn merely smiled, offering no defense.

William's gaze shifted to Lucas, who was busy fawning over Natalie Beaumont. His expression darkened instantly.

"What if your sister catches a cold? Don't you have the sense to look after her?"

Lucas blinked, bewildered. "Wh—What did I do now?"

Natalie stifled a laugh and nudged him. "Go fetch a shawl for Evelyn!"

Rubbing the back of his head, Lucas obediently grabbed the shawl and moved to drape it over Evelyn’s shoulders.

She blocked him, avoiding his touch. Only then did Lucas notice—her skin was ice-cold.

Her lips had even taken on a faint bluish tint. No wonder William was furious.

"Why would you run outside without proper clothing?" Lucas groaned. "Do you want our dear father to murder his favorite son on this national holiday?"

Evelyn forced a weak smile. "Wait."

She stepped further inside, her sharp gaze locking onto the two women who stood frozen in place.

They shrank back, not daring to meet her eyes, pressing closer to the older relatives.

Even Lucas, slow as he was, sensed something was wrong.

Evelyn wasn’t the type to punish herself like this. Unless—

William frowned. "What’s wrong, darling?"

Evelyn raised her hand, but Little Oliver suddenly bounded down the stairs, calling out excitedly, "Beautiful Lady! Happy New Year!"

Her hand dropped instantly.

Those filthy words had no place tainting a child’s ears.

Evelyn turned, her expression softening into a warm, natural smile.

"Happy New Year, Oliver!"

She’d deal with those two old hags after putting him to bed.

A quick glance at Lucas, and she added with a smirk, "Help me bring Oliver’s gift over."

Lucas rolled his eyes dramatically. "Always bossing your brother around!"

Despite his complaint, he obediently headed upstairs to retrieve the present.

But Oliver was faster. He eagerly thrust a small, ornate box into Evelyn’s hands. "This is for you, Beautiful Lady."

Evelyn studied the box. Something about it felt familiar.

Oliver had always been generous with his gifts—once even gifting her solid gold.

A flicker of unease stirred in her chest.

Under Oliver’s expectant gaze, she opened the box.

Gasps echoed around her.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The black pearls she’d seen at the auction earlier that day—each one perfectly round, impossibly rare—were now nestled in her palms.

Individually, they were priceless.

Together?

Her hands trembled slightly as she steadied herself.

An auction price of 880 million.

Even Nathan Blackwood had backed off, wary of the mysterious bidder behind them.

And now she knew why.

It had been Oliver all along.

Her emotions spiraled like a roller coaster.

It felt like she was holding a mountain of gold.

At this rate, she’d start believing money was the only thing she didn’t have.

"You—you bought these?"

Oliver grinned smugly. "Used an offshore account. Not that expensive. What matters is that you like them, Beautiful Lady!"

Evelyn’s jaw nearly dropped. "Does your father know about this?"

Oliver pouted. "He only found out this afternoon. But—" He straightened, serious. "This is from me! Daddy has nothing to do with it!"

He was adamant about drawing a clear line between Preston Sinclair and himself.

After all, he was the one who had painstakingly chosen this gift.
###Chapter 687 

Evelyn Sinclair was momentarily speechless. Oliver Sinclair's gifts were becoming increasingly extravagant.

The crowd instantly recognized the item—it was no ordinary piece.

"That must be worth a fortune."
"Absolutely stunning. I've never seen anything like it on the market."

Oliver grinned. "Not too expensive. Just 880 million. But I have plenty of money, and Pretty Lady deserves the best!"

Nathan Blackwood scoffed playfully. "You've got good taste, kid." He always swelled with pride when someone complimented his daughter.

The guests exchanged glances. They had assumed Oliver was just another child under the Sterling family's care. But no ordinary child could casually gift something worth nearly a billion.

Evelyn carefully tucked the pearls away. Fate had a funny way of circling back. Still, she couldn't accept such an extravagant present. She'd return the money to Preston Sinclair later.

"Do you like it, Pretty Lady?" Oliver asked eagerly.

Evelyn smiled. "I love it."

Just then, Lucas Sterling descended the stairs, cradling an enormous model. Oliver's eyes widened in awe.

Lucas set it down before him. "This is the Lego Universe Evelyn specially commissioned for you. One of a kind in the entire world!"

Oliver nearly leaped with joy, clutching the massive model. "This is amazing!"

Evelyn exhaled in relief. He genuinely adored it.

Though compared to his black pearls, her gift suddenly seemed childish.

William Sterling sighed dramatically and pointed at the model. "Oliver, we should bedazzle this with diamonds!"

Evelyn winced. Why didn’t I think of that?

She handed the pearls to the butler. "Lock this in my safe." The butler hurried off without hesitation.

The envious stares from the guests were impossible to miss.

Evelyn took Oliver’s hand, leading him upstairs. "You can play tomorrow. Time for bed."

Despite his excitement, exhaustion quickly claimed him. The moment his head hit the pillow, he was out.

When Evelyn returned downstairs, the party had resumed its lively atmosphere. She zeroed in on two elderly women, their nervous energy palpable.

William approached. "Evelyn, if you're tired, go rest. Lucas can handle things here."

Lucas, barely keeping his eyes open, shot him a look.

Evelyn shook her head. "There's something I need to settle first."

"What is it?" William frowned.

"Dad, don’t be upset if I ruin the mood. I know today’s special, but I can’t let this slide."

William looked baffled. "What are you talking about?"

Evelyn strode into the side hall where guests were playing cards. The two women beside her grand-aunt trembled, their expressions starkly different from the others.

She tilted her chin up. "These two—apologies, I’ve forgotten their names—what they said earlier was beyond unacceptable."

The room fell silent.

William’s frown deepened. "What did they say?"

"Why don’t you ask them?" Evelyn challenged.

The women shot to their feet, panic-stricken. "We didn’t say anything! Don’t drag us into this, Evelyn!"
###Chapter 688

"Of course, Evelyn. We understand you look down on us for being less fortunate." The woman's voice trembled with false humility. "But blood ties should count for something. Why this hostility?" All eyes darted between the nervous relatives and Evelyn's icy glare.

Charles Sterling cleared his throat. "Evelyn, enough dramatics. This is a family gathering." His reprimand carried through the tense silence.

Evelyn's lips curled into a humorless smile.

"Exactly, Uncle Charles. That's precisely why Father and my brothers sacrificed their sleep to host this New Year's celebration." Her manicured nails tapped against her champagne flute. "Why we spared no expense on hospitality and gifts."

Then her gaze hardened like tempered steel.

"But if family means stabbing each other in the back..." She let the sentence hang, watching the color drain from two particular faces. The room collectively held its breath.

"Then I'd rather be an orphan."

A shocked murmur rippled through the crowd. Only Evelyn and the two guilty parties knew what had transpired in the garden. "What happened?" "She was perfectly pleasant all evening!" The whispers grew louder.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying the women's panicked expressions. "Still playing innocent?" Her voice cut through the noise.

The older woman clutched her pearls. "W-we didn't—"

"Lucas." Evelyn didn't let them finish. "The garden surveillance footage. Now." Sterling Manor had no surveillance blind spots - a fact these fools had forgotten.

The women turned ghostly pale. "Evelyn, please—"

But she'd already turned away, the click of her heels echoing like a countdown to their ruin. Lucas stormed off with thunderous steps, the card game forgotten.

When the damning recording played, William Sterling's knuckles turned white around his cane. The video's audio filled the room with venomous whispers about Evelyn's divorce and supposed inadequacies.

A chair shattered against the marble floor as Alexander Sterling lost control. The temperature in the room plummeted to subzero.

The guilty women collapsed to their knees. "We were just speculating!" "Family shouldn't take offense at harmless gossip!"

Their pleas died when William's cane struck the floor with a crack that sounded like a gavel. The relatives exchanged terrified glances - their livelihoods depended on the Sterlings' goodwill. Everyone knew William was their only advocate; his children tolerated these gatherings at best.

Now two idiots had burned that fragile bridge.

The grand-aunt shuffled forward, grasping Evelyn's wrist with gnarled fingers. "Child, elders sometimes speak without thinking. Surely you can forgive—"

###Chapter 689 

Evelyn withdrew her hand with icy precision. Elders? What a joke. Did they really think moral obligations would work on her?

Not a chance. "Apologies, but I'm not feeling charitable today. Since we're family, I'll refrain from calling the authorities. However, I insist these so-called 'elders' vacate my property immediately. Otherwise, I'll have them charged with trespassing." The room held its breath, waiting for William to intervene.

But the patriarch was too furious to speak. Charles remained silent as well, wisely choosing not to involve himself. Just as the grand-aunt opened her mouth, Lucas cut in with biting sarcasm. "Are you all deaf? Should I call a cab to escort you out?"

"Lucas!" someone gasped. "Instead of advising your sister, you're encouraging her reckless behavior?"

They might not dare criticize Evelyn directly, but Lucas was fair game - especially after his all-night vigil. His responding laugh was razor-sharp. "Anyone else with complaints can leave too." He collapsed onto the sofa, done with their nonsense.

William massaged his temples, his expression stormy. "Evelyn, I'm retiring upstairs. Handle this... situation as you see fit." His exit spoke volumes.

With their patriarch gone, the interlopers lost their last ally. Evelyn and Lucas efficiently arranged their transportation. Dawn's first light found only Charles remaining, his frustration palpable.

"My estate is quite distant—" Lucas flashed a tired grin. "Uncle Charles, this isn't your circus. The guest suite is yours." Finally, blessed silence descended.

The only ones oblivious to the night's drama were Donovan and Emily, having retired early. Next morning, the entire household rose at dawn—except for Evelyn and Lucas.

Early visitors arrived while the siblings still slept. Lucas was notoriously indifferent to schedules, but Evelyn guarded her beauty sleep religiously—eight full hours, non-negotiable. Natalie, sharing Evelyn's bed, slept just as soundly.

Only when Leo's restlessness became unbearable did the AI tiger start bouncing on the bed. Evelyn groaned awake, dragging Natalie with her. The blonde pinched the synthetic feline's ear. "Can I teach this creature some manners?"

Leo twitched its whiskers. "Physical discipline is ineffective. I lack pain receptors."

Evelyn's sleepy chuckle filled the room. Both women applied face masks before venturing downstairs—unprepared for the scene awaiting them.

Evelyn froze mid-step. Nathan Blackwood sat in her living room like some specter from her past. Flanking him were Reginald Blackwood and Sophia Blackwood.

Time seemed to stutter. William nearly choked on his tea at their disheveled appearance. "Must you embarrass me in front of company?"

Evelyn and Natalie executed a perfect about-face. Nathan's lips quirked at the rare glimpse of a rumpled, vulnerable Evelyn—so different from her usual razor-sharp persona. Adorable, really.

Reginald waved off the impropriety. "Think nothing of it. Family needn't stand on ceremony."

William chose his words carefully. "I've indulged her too much. Your understanding is appreciated."

After sufficient primping, the women descended properly. Natalie exchanged pleasantries before Lucas commandeered her to admire his culinary efforts. Trapped by expectant stares, Evelyn defaulted to her trademark glacial composure.

New Year's visits between families were expected—but Sophia's presence was an unwelcome surprise. When Evelyn's gaze landed on her, the younger Blackwood woman actually stood.
###Chapter 690 

Sophia Blackwood's demeanor shifted dramatically from her usual haughty arrogance. She approached Evelyn with hesitant steps.

"I owe you an apology, Evelyn." Sophia's voice was uncharacteristically meek. "I was foolish before. I didn't understand... I did terrible things."

She kept stealing glances at Nathan Blackwood's impassive face. If not for his obsession with Evelyn and her own desperation to return to the Blackwood family, Sophia would never have humbled herself like this.

The thought of returning to her meager allowance and subservient position made her stomach churn. Evelyn sat perfectly still, her smile cool and detached.

"Don't trouble yourself, Ms. Blackwood. The past is forgotten." Evelyn's tone suggested she believed leopards never changed their spots.

Reginald Blackwood nodded approvingly. "Family quarrels always mend. Blood ties can't be broken so easily."

William Sterling chuckled without humor. "Indeed. Though I'll need to arrange several introductions for Evelyn before she returns to work. So many eligible gentlemen have expressed interest."

The Blackwoods' expressions darkened. William continued mercilessly, "She might need three or four meetings daily just to accommodate them all."

Nathan's head snapped up, his icy gaze locking onto Evelyn. Her composed expression confirmed she'd known about these plans.

"If that's the case, we shouldn't keep you." Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. He stood abruptly.

Evelyn merely arched an eyebrow at his sudden departure. William escorted them out with false politeness. Reginald shot Nathan a meaningful look before leaving.

Inside the car, Reginald's voice dripped with contempt. "The Sterlings clearly want nothing to do with us. Will you really let her slip away?"

Nathan's eyes gleamed dangerously. "That's not their decision to make. Let's see who dares pursue the woman I've claimed."

"You should have taken my advice from the start," Reginald muttered.

Nathan's expression turned thunderous. The atmosphere grew suffocating.

"What advice?" Sophia dared to ask.

Nathan's glacial stare silenced her instantly. She'd learned the hard way not to cross him.

After a tense pause, Sophia ventured another question. "Does this mean I can return to work soon?"

Reginald cleared his throat. "Since you've shown proper remorse, we'll consider the matter closed. Don't disappoint us again."

Sophia nearly wept with relief. Those humiliating days were finally behind her. She clung to Reginald's arm like a child, her joy barely contained.
###Chapter 691

Sterling Manor buzzed with life after Nathan's departure.

Donovan and Emily took charge of breakfast preparations in the kitchen.

Anyone could guess this wasn't Donovan's idea.

Emily clearly sought this opportunity to showcase her domestic skills.

Natalie and Lucas assisted while young Oliver attended his morning lessons in the study.

Alexander concluded his video conference with overseas executives before descending the grand staircase.

Evelyn lounged on the velvet sofa, casually biting into a crisp apple when she spotted Alexander.

"Big Brother, joining the kitchen brigade?" She gestured toward the bustling kitchen with her fruit.

Evelyn had never witnessed Alexander near cooking appliances - this would be historic.

Three seconds of hesitation passed before Alexander shook his head. "No."

Evelyn exhaled dramatically, her smile turning playful.

"At this rate, you'll be the last single Sterling. Shouldn't you speed things up?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "You and Lucas remain unattached too."

Only Donovan had escaped bachelorhood so far. Evelyn leaned closer with a knowing grin.

"Lucas has been auditioning potential brides for months. His engagement announcement could drop any day. As for me..." She twirled her apple stem. "Father claims he's lined up countless suitors. My matchmaking marathon begins tomorrow."

Alexander's lips twitched in disbelief.

William emerged wearing a striped apron, interrupting her fantasy.

"Stop daydreaming! That was just for show. No actual suitors exist, but you'll maintain the pretense, understood?"

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged exasperated glances.

Alexander noticed genuine disappointment flicker across Evelyn's face.

Breakfast commenced with Charles Sterling's arrival.

The family greeted him warmly - past tensions had dissolved. At the dining table, William and Charles occupied the head seats.

Brotherhood had smoothed over previous estrangements.

Donovan and Emily served their culinary creations.

Emily's breakfast spread featured creamy millet porridge, artisanal toast, and an array of delicate sides.

The presentation rivaled five-star hotel buffets.

"Please, try everything," Emily urged eagerly. Ravenous, Evelyn and Lucas both reached for the porridge simultaneously.

Their taste buds recoiled at the overwhelming salt assault.

They froze mid-bite, about to spit out the offensive mouthfuls when Donovan's warning glare stopped them.

In perfect synchronization, they forced swallows.

"Well?" Emily's hopeful eyes locked onto Evelyn.

Evelyn's smile never wavered. "Divine. The texture melts like silk, packed with nutrients. Emily, you're a culinary prodigy!"

Emily nearly bounced with joy. "Really? My first attempt following recipes! This is wonderful!"

Donovan smirked beside her. "Naturally. Our scientific precision translates perfectly to domestic arts."

Evelyn and Lucas stiffened imperceptibly. The table fell silent.

Each guest received a porridge portion. As Emily prepared to taste her creation, Donovan intercepted.

"Uncle Charles has legendary appetite - let's reserve seconds for him while we enjoy the toast."

Charles looked up sharply. Was that mockery?

William nodded approvingly. "How considerate our children have become. Charles, indulge without restraint!"

Only then did Charles relax.

His first porridge spoonful triggered immediate paralysis. Every swallow became an act of sheer willpower.
###Chapter 692

Donovan Sterling looked like he was swallowing poison rather than breakfast porridge.

For the first time, Evelyn felt genuine pity for her uncle. She prayed he didn't have a heart condition.

William Sterling wore the same pained expression.

After dabbing his mouth with a napkin, William forced a smile and delivered his rehearsed compliments. Evelyn and Lucas exchanged horrified glances.

Evelyn thought, "Just how terrified is Father that Emily might reject Donovan?"

Alexander Sterling took one microscopic bite and never touched his spoon again.

As always, Alexander proved to be the wisest member of the Sterling family.

Emily watched the family's reaction with satisfaction, especially William's exaggerated praise that stroked her ego.

Donovan observed his family's theatrics with detached amusement as he ate Lucas' perfectly toasted bread. The moment he'd seen Emily confuse salt for sugar, he'd vowed never to let her near a stove again.

This breakfast would be her first and last culinary attempt.

Post-meal, everyone gulped down multiple glasses of water. Emily prepared to visit her parents, with the butler loading her car with lavish gifts. Evelyn and Natalie helped with the packing.

William nervously asked, "Emily, are you... satisfied with our family?"

Emily nodded solemnly. "Absolutely!"

Marrying the legendary Donovan Sterling into this wealthy dynasty? Satisfaction didn't begin to cover it.

William beamed. "Then when Donovan visits your parents, please speak well of him. He's not eloquent, but you're perfectly matched. If they approve, we'll immediately set a wedding date!"

"S-so soon?" Emily's eyes widened in shock.

Who said marrying into wealth was difficult? This was suspiciously easy!

"Nonsense," William waved dismissively. "You're both busy people - leave the arrangements to us!"

After Emily's departure, Evelyn contacted Kingsley Tech to finalize the product copy before posting it.

Satisfied with the draft, she uploaded it to her social media.

Her account already overflowed with comments and DMs she never read.

With Nathan Blackwood still trending below New Year's greetings, Evelyn strategically timed her post.

She shared a photo of her right hand holding a coffee cup - slender fingers like porcelain, the index finger adorned with an exquisite diamond ring perfectly centered in the frame.

Caption: "New Beginnings." Engagement exploded instantly.

The timing screamed intentional messaging.

Netizens dissected the image like forensic investigators. The coffee revealed nothing, so they fixated on the ring's placement.

A right index finger ring signaled noble singledom - her elegant clapback to Nathan's ridiculous rumors.

Regardless of public opinion, Evelyn remained unshaken.

This post drew her line in the sand.

Through silence and symbolism, Evelyn debunked reconciliation rumors with Nathan.

The featured product? That breathtaking ring.

Its flawless craftsmanship, dazzling diamond, and elegant design complemented her hand like it was made for her.

Absolute perfection.

Evelyn Sinclair truly embodied the ideal wealthy bachelorette.
###Chapter 693

High society women and A-listers often flaunted massive diamonds to assert their elite status.

The bigger the rock, the higher their social standing seemed to be.

But Evelyn Sinclair's ring was different—a modest one-carat solitaire.

Understated yet exquisitely crafted, it sparkled with understated brilliance.

No one would ever mistake it for cheap costume jewelry.

Within hours, eagle-eyed netizens had identified it as Sterling Enterprises' upcoming launch: Solitaire.

This signature piece was handcrafted to the highest international standards.

Priced accessibly yet designed with impeccable taste, its subtle elegance made waves when spotted on Evelyn's finger.

The internet exploded with excitement.

[Wait—CEOs get to wear unreleased jewelry? So unfair!]

[Only Evelyn could pull off such a flawless clapback. Queen of the single elite!]

[When's the launch? Take my money already!]

[Every scandal just becomes another PR masterclass. Poor Mr. Blackwood never stood a chance.]

[Nathan should buy himself one too—oh wait, he's not single!]

[Pour one out for Nathan... LOL!]

Soon, #Solitaire dominated trending lists, eclipsing all gossip.

Evelyn had turned controversy into a marketing triumph.

Nathan Blackwood never imagined losing to a single carat diamond.

Highland Estates.

Too irritated to stay at Reginald Blackwood's, Nathan returned home immediately after the event.

His phone rang the moment he stepped inside—Tristan Whitmore's laughter crackled through.

"Hilarious, Nate. Evelyn finally showed her true capitalist colors!"

"Get to the point," Nathan snapped.

"You haven't seen? She leveraged your drama to launch Sterling's new jewelry line. The woman's a promotional genius—billions in pre-orders, stock prices soaring."

Tristan wheezed between laughs. "Last time at least she threw Ferguson—sorry, Blackwood Industries—a bone. This time? You're not even an afterthought!"

Nathan ended the call mid-chuckle.

Tristan was hardly one to talk, given his own disastrous track record.

Scowling, Nathan scrolled through newsfeeds flooded with Solitaire coverage.

'So this is her response?' He exhaled sharply.

Financially, Evelyn had played this perfectly. He couldn't fault her strategy.

But while he'd been emotionally vulnerable, she'd been... strategizing?

The realization stung more than he cared to admit.

He dialed Harrison immediately.

"Get me that ring Evelyn's wearing."

If it wasn't publicly available yet, he'd make it available.

Within ninety minutes, the piece sat gleaming on his study desk.

Nathan studied the familiar design, lips quirking involuntarily.

Lately, he'd had Evelyn thoroughly monitored.

William Sterling's claim about her daily blind dates had put Nathan on high alert.

Fortunately, while countless suitors visited Sterling Manor, none gained private audiences.

'She still cares,' Nathan thought, tracing the diamond's facets. 'This proves it.'
###Chapter 694

The new year arrived with Alexander Sterling being the first to return to work. He'd gone into the office two days early to prepare everything.

Evelyn Sinclair declined his invitation to commute together, claiming she needed to accompany Natalie Beaumont abroad to find Adrian Prescott.

After two days of sightseeing with Lucas, the Sterling siblings followed Natalie to Montecito.

Adrian had mysteriously vanished on New Year's Eve without answering calls. Strangely, Natalie hadn't reached out either - and neither had he.

Only then did Natalie begin suspecting Adrian was hiding something.

When Evelyn and Natalie decided to track him down, Lucas practically vibrated with excitement, insisting on joining them. No one could dissuade him.

Evelyn saw right through Lucas's motives, but fortunately, Natalie wasn't in the mood to argue. The trio boarded a plane to Montecito.

Upon landing, Natalie's expression darkened by the minute. She knew Adrian's hotel and could contact his friends anytime.

Yet she didn't want to alert him.

At the hotel entrance, Lucas bounced with unnatural energy. "Want me to ask for his room number?"

Evelyn studied Natalie. "Or we could call to ask his location?"

Natalie hesitated briefly.

"No need. I booked him a year-long suite here. He wouldn't stay anywhere else." With Adrian's spending habits, more luxurious accommodations were beyond his means.

After flashing her membership card, Natalie led the Sterlings to the elevator.

Evelyn and Lucas exchanged glances. Honestly, Evelyn felt a thrill of anticipation.

Something told her this wouldn't be simple.

The scene felt like they were about to catch someone cheating!

Reaching the suite, Natalie composed herself and rang the bell.

After a dozen consecutive rings, the occupant finally grew impatient.

A stunning foreign woman in a silk nightgown answered, sleepy-eyed and irritated.

"Who is it? I said no service—"

Red marks dotted her exposed neck.

Evelyn, Natalie, and Lucas stood frozen at the door.

Even mentally prepared, the sight shocked them.

The three were rather innocent, after all...

The woman frowned at Evelyn and Natalie, but her eyes sparkled seeing Lucas.

Lucas's face darkened instantly, disgusted.

Then came that familiar, groggy, awful voice from inside. "Who is it? Come back already. Do you want to perform or not?"

Adrian!

The woman turned her head. "Did you invite others to join us?"

In a daze, Lucas kicked the door open with a vicious expression.

"Get out!"

His shout startled those inside.

Someone scrambled to dress, sounding nervous.

"Who's there—?"

When Adrian appeared and saw the trio, he froze.

His face went pale.

Evelyn was stunned. In their few meetings, Adrian had seemed upright and transparent.

How could he do this while dating Natalie?

She'd been skeptical knocking, but seeing Adrian now forced belief.

Silence thickened the air.

Then a second woman emerged from the bedroom—
###Chapter 695

The woman was clearly just waking up, her state mirroring the other female at the door. She draped herself over Adrian Prescott's shoulders with suggestive familiarity. "Adrian, who's there?"

Adrian flinched violently, shoving her away like she'd burned him.

"What's wrong?" the woman slurred, blinking in confusion.

His face drained of color. "Get inside. Now."

He pressed his lips into a thin line, moving toward the doorway when Natalie Beaumont's icy voice cut through the tension.

"Get dressed. Meet us in the lobby."

Her tone was frighteningly neutral.

Evelyn Sinclair doubted any woman could remain composed after witnessing such a scene.

Natalie turned on her heel and left without another word.

Evelyn followed, glancing back to see Lucas Sterling still rooted in place, his glacial stare boring into Adrian.

Natalie commandeered the hotel's business center to print the documents.

Within ten minutes, they waited in the opulent lobby.

Adrian appeared, impeccably dressed as always, though his ashen complexion betrayed his exhaustion. The dark circles under his eyes spoke of a night spent in reckless indulgence. His gaze darted nervously. "Where's Natalie?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "She'll be here. Sit."

Public confrontations were beneath them, though Evelyn's fingers itched to slap the smirk off his face. The moment Adrian's knees touched the chair, Natalie returned with crisp paperwork.

He sprang up like an electrocuted puppet. Before he could launch into excuses, Natalie thrust the documents forward. "Sign."

Adrian's face contorted when he recognized the termination contract.

Natalie had built Adrian's career from nothing - transforming an unknown into an international runway sensation. He was her crown jewel. Yet she was discarding him without hesitation.

"Nat, this happens all the time in our industry—" Adrian began, but Lucas moved like lightning.

He slammed Adrian's face into the marble table with a sickening crack. Blood gushed from Adrian's nose as Lucas twisted his collar. "I believe she said sign it."

Adrian wiped at his ruined face futilely. The Stanton name alone made Lucas untouchable, let alone his own formidable reputation. Resistance was pointless.

With trembling hands, Adrian scrawled his signature. Natalie tucked the papers away with clinical efficiency. "Congratulations. You're free." Her smile could frost hell. "I've already replaced you for the VOGUE Runway show."

Adrian gaped. "That's impossible! They'd never accept a last-minute substitution!"

This was the fashion world's most prestigious event - models vetted through months of grueling selections.

Natalie's laugh was razor-sharp. "Watch me."
###Chapter 696

Natalie laughed coldly as she reminded Adrian. "When I signed you, you were just another struggling model."

"Without my recommendation, do you honestly believe you'd ever walk a VOGUE runway?" She laid bare the industry's harsh realities.

She could build him up just as easily as she could tear him down. "Talent matters, but for someone like you who's talented yet still floundering, I was your only ticket out."

"Adrian, you were the first new face I personally signed to Horizon Media." Natalie's smile turned icy. "I promised to give you everything, and I delivered."

"Starting today, you're on your own—"

She couldn't even bother saying "we're through." The dismissal was complete. Turning to Evelyn with renewed cheer, she said, "Let's go shopping. My treat for dragging you here!"

Evelyn rose with an admiring smile. Classic Natalie—ruthlessly efficient. No wonder she'd climbed so high in this cutthroat industry.

Adrian tried to follow, but Lucas blocked him, flashing his phone. "I've got some interesting photos. Approach her again, and the whole world sees your bedroom escapades." Adrian paled.

With a contemptuous sneer, Lucas turned away.

Too terrified to pursue them, Adrian could only watch as the trio disappeared into the luxury boutiques. Lucas happily carried their growing pile of designer bags while Evelyn studied Natalie's composed expression.

"Natalie, I don't get it," Evelyn finally asked. "Adrian owed everything to you. Why would he risk this? Was he always this disloyal?"

Natalie ran her fingers over an alligator skin handbag before telling the sales associate, "We'll take this."

Turning back to Evelyn, she explained, "I made some calls at the hotel. He's been sleeping with a KEY executive these past few days." Her lips curled. "Only dared betray me because he found a bigger backer."

Evelyn's eyes widened. She hadn't expected that twist.

"He wouldn't have been this reckless if he were clean," Natalie continued. "Remember when I offered him to you? He didn't refuse—you just weren't interested." Evelyn arched a brow, recalling that awkward auction introduction shortly after her divorce.

"But terminating his contract seems too lenient," Evelyn pointed out. With his KEY connection, his career might survive.

Natalie chuckled. "You don't understand, darling. Horizon and KEY have been partners for years—our interests are too entangled for one executive's whim to override." She adjusted her sunglasses. "That woman was just playing with him. She won't burn bridges with me over some disposable toy."

Evelyn nodded, impressed by the intricate power plays. Her own solution would've been simpler: hire thugs to beat Adrian senseless and leak compromising photos.

But Natalie's approach was more elegant—systematically dismantling his safety nets and ambitions. For a social climber like Adrian, this slow ruin would be far more devastating than any physical punishment.
###Chapter 697

Lucas approached with two ice cream cones, handing one to each of them. "Take a break," he suggested.

Evelyn accepted hers and settled onto the bench. Natalie gestured excitedly toward a new dress on display, her eyes sparkling with approval. "Stunning choice," Lucas remarked immediately. "That emerald green complements your complexion perfectly. You should try it on."

Natalie nodded eagerly. Evelyn studied her brother's expression. "Did you catch that?"

Lucas merely arched an eyebrow. Evelyn couldn't suppress her grin. "You're acting suspiciously indifferent. I'm starting to think you orchestrated this whole thing-" Before she could finish, Lucas clamped a hand over her mouth, shooting her a warning glare. "Ruin my surprise and I'm canceling your black card privileges."

Evelyn's smirk widened. Just as she suspected - her brother would never stay passive. He'd clearly used today's shopping trip as an opportunity to advance his agenda. "Fishing with live bait, are we?" she teased. "Of course, of course. So the mastermind behind the scenes is actually you. Going all out for Natalie, I see."

Lucas scoffed. "Should I rely on you instead? You've been spending my money without producing results, yet you dare criticize?" As if Lucas would remain idle while Natalie might slip away to someone else. That would be unacceptable.

When Natalie emerged wearing the dress, Lucas launched into effusive praise. "Absolute perfection. You're breathtaking. So beautiful I forgot my own name-"

The nearby sales associate struggled to maintain a professional expression.

They returned home laden with purchases, sharing their flight with an unrecognizable celebrity. Lucas maneuvered to sit beside Natalie, leaving the masked stranger next to Evelyn. The man's face bore thick layers of makeup, his oversized sunglasses and dangling earrings completing the absurd disguise.

Evelyn focused on her magazine until remembering her headphones were in Lucas's bag. She turned right. "Hey-"

Before Lucas could respond, the stranger suddenly removed his mask with dramatic flair. "Fine, you've caught me," he sighed. "I knew you recognized me. What'll it be - photo or autograph?"

Evelyn stared blankly. She had no idea who he was. "You want both? Well, since you went through all this trouble-" He pulled out his phone for a selfie. Evelyn abruptly turned away, calling past him. "Lucas, pass me my headphones."

The celebrity froze, hastily replacing his mask. An awkward silence descended.

Evelyn recognized neither his heavily altered features nor his inflated ego. He paled in comparison to Julian Moreau's natural charm. Yet his confidence suggested he expected universal recognition.

Was this some attempt to ride her coattails to fame? The realization struck her instantly.

At the airport, both Sterling siblings used the VIP通道. Their luggage had been sent ahead, leaving them unencumbered. Surprisingly, the celebrity followed, casting frequent backward glances as if wanting to speak. Evelyn ignored him completely.

Natalie nudged her. "Do you know him?"

Evelyn shook her head honestly.
###Chapter 698

Evelyn smirked. "Those fresh-faced idols from talent shows might have hordes of fans, but they're all middle school kids at best." She noticed the young celebrity stealing glances at her. "Not my type. I prefer men with more... experience."

Lucas caught up, draping an arm over her shoulder. "What's the gossip? Don't leave me out."

Both women ignored him completely. The male idol strutted ahead, suddenly stopping to don oversized sunglasses and a surgical mask. He barked into his phone, "Where's my security detail? I can't have random people touching me - I've got germophobia!" Evelyn and Natalie exchanged amused glances.

The whole display reeked of desperation. His fanbase probably hadn't even hit puberty yet - certainly not old enough to skip school for airport greetings. The idol took a dramatic breath before his grand exit, adjusting his baseball cap at a painfully calculated angle. The contradiction was almost artistic - simultaneously terrified of recognition yet dying for attention.

The punchline? His rented security formed an impenetrable human wall... for exactly zero waiting fans. Not a single banner or screaming teenager in sight. Evelyn bit back laughter. See? Responsible minors prioritizing education over fandom.

The idol's face fell until some paparazzi arrived. Their cameras flashed for exactly thirty seconds before packing up. "Where are my actual fans?" the idol demanded, ripping off his mask.

One photographer chuckled. "Market rate's seventy bucks per fan, five hundred for a group. Your agency's budget only covered these shots, kid." The idol's expression curdled like spoiled milk.

Then the photographer's phone rang. His eyes widened. "Evelyn Sinclair's here! Move, move, move!" The sudden spotlight shift left Evelyn momentarily frozen - no sunglasses, no mask, completely exposed.

Lucas moved with practiced ease, producing a mask... and slipping it onto Natalie instead. "I know you hate the spotlight," he whispered to his sister. "Play my assistant for five minutes." Evelyn's jaw dropped. Some brotherly love.

With a devilish grin, Lucas propelled her forward. "Don't hate me," he murmured. "A guy's gotta maintain his bachelor image." Had reporters not surrounded them, Evelyn would've kicked his shin.

"It's really her! Evelyn Sinclair! And Lucas Sterling too!" The cameras exploded. "Ms. Sinclair, were you traveling with your brother?" "You two seem so close!"

Evelyn's smile turned brittle. Close? She'd strangle him given half a chance. Maintaining perfect poise, she stood like royalty while Lucas shielded her eyes from the flashes with one hand, his other arm possessively around her shoulders.

"Give my sister some space, folks," he charmed the crowd. "Jet lag's hitting her hard." His grip tightened as he steered her through the chaos, the perfect protective sibling act. Evelyn mentally added this to his list of offenses.
###Chapter 699

The Sterling siblings were impossible to miss.

News traveled fast. Within minutes, the deserted airport transformed into a chaotic scene. Evelyn hadn't anticipated this level of attention.

Lucas glanced back, signaling Natalie to slip away unnoticed. His protective instinct left Evelyn exposed in the center of the storm.

Perfect.

Just what she needed.

"Ms. Sterling! What's your response to Nathan Blackwood's public confession? Will you reconsider?"

"Don't you feel guilty seeing how heartbroken Mr. Blackwood appears?"

"Is this all just clever marketing for Sterling Enterprises' new product line?"

"Will Lucas be endorsing your family's jewelry collection?"

The barrage of questions trapped Evelyn in place. Her temper flared. This was entirely Lucas's fault. She stepped back sharply, grinding her heel into his designer shoe.

Lucas didn't even flinch. With practiced charm, he deflected: "You'll have to ask Nathan about his marketing strategies. He started this game. As for Evelyn's feelings... let nature take its course. She's not part of our world. Why not ask about my love life instead?"

The crowd erupted in laughter. "You've been single forever, Lucas! When's the wedding?"

Lucas pretended to consider. "Soon."

"That's what you always say!" reporters chorused.

Evelyn's smile stiffened. Her thoughts drifted to that anonymous male celebrity nearby - how she envied his anonymity.

"Ms. Sterling, any business plans for the new year?"

This one Lucas couldn't answer for her.

Evelyn swept her hair aside, deliberately flashing the Solitaire ring. "Thank you for your interest. But if I share details, won't that just create more... unnecessary hype?"

The crowd chuckled while the reporter flushed. "Stay tuned," Evelyn concluded.

At the exit, she spotted the unrecognized celebrity - mask removed, surrounded by indifferent bodyguards. The absurdity almost made her laugh.

Once safely in the car, both siblings exhaled.

Lucas loosened his collar with a grin. "Took me two Oscar wins to get that kind of frenzy. Who knew my baby sister could trend harder than me?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"Aren't you going to check on Natalie?"

Lucas froze. He'd completely forgotten. Scrambling for his phone, he dialed frantically. Evelyn shook her head.

By afternoon, #SterlingSiblings dominated social media again. The Solitaire ring's public debut sparked intense speculation.

Sterling Enterprises' strategy was ruthless: no pre-orders, limited quantities, strict release windows. Textbook scarcity marketing.

Yet demand already outpaced supply. Every sales channel buzzed with anticipation.
###Chapter 700

Blackwood Industries.

Nathan stared at the trending photos of Evelyn at the airport, his lips curving into a faint smirk.

Breathtaking.

Every angle was flawless.

Not a single bad shot.

Theodore was in Nathan’s office, changing the water in the fish tank when an idea struck him.

"Mr. Blackwood, why don’t you just like the post?"

"Like it?" Nathan’s voice was low, dangerous. "Wouldn’t it be better if I reposted it with a caption?"

He wanted to throw money at it—keep it trending for days—but he knew Evelyn would murder him if he did.

Theodore suppressed a laugh. "Too obvious. It’ll look desperate."

"A simple like is subtle. It says you noticed, but you’re not making a big deal out of it. Mysterious. If she asks, say it was an accident. She won’t overreact."

Nathan scowled but nodded.

Not his usual style, but he’d take what worked.

After too many failed attempts, he was willing to let Theodore salvage this.

Out of all the photos, he only liked one—the one where Lucas had been conveniently cropped out.

That was the only one he approved of.

The moment he tapped like, the internet exploded.

[Hahaha, Mr. Blackwood can’t even stand his ex-brother-in-law?]

[Lucas Sterling doesn’t deserve to be in the same frame as Evelyn?]

[They’re siblings!]

[Since when does Lucas get edited out of photos? His ego must be shattered.]

[Lucas: Am I a joke to you?]

Theodore glanced at his phone, then at the half-dead fish in the tank.

He suddenly felt just like that fish—suffocating.

Even in a tank worth six figures, it couldn’t breathe.

He was sure Evelyn would want to stab Nathan when she saw this.

The airport moment had been accidental, but Evelyn had been dropping hints—especially with that ring.

The Solitaire.

Nathan had just redirected all the attention to himself.

Theodore groaned. Should I just stab myself first to save her the trouble?

Before he could spiral further, Harrison burst in.

"Media interview in ten. The one scheduled six months ago. Conference room. Now."

Theodore blinked. Right. I’m also a part-time assistant now.

He scrambled to set up.

Nathan was drowning in work—thousands of employees, relentless pressure—yet he still knew every department inside out.

No one in the business world matched his precision.

One misstep meant ruin.

Ordinary people couldn’t fathom it.

Theodore used to think Nathan’s billions were luck.

Now he knew—without Nathan, Blackwood Industries wouldn’t exist.

And yet, despite the chaos, Nathan was still trying to win Evelyn back.

Theodore’s chest ached.

He hauled files into the conference room, watching reporters scramble to set up.

Nathan only did a handful of interviews a year.

This was rare.

Nathan sat at the head of the table, scanning documents Harrison had handed him.

His sharp profile radiated cold intensity—not anger, just his natural aura.

Every second mattered.

"Start."
###Chapter 701

The moment the cameras began rolling, the room fell into absolute silence.

The boardroom's atmosphere was already tense. With Nathan Blackwood's intimidating presence, even the seasoned interviewer seemed to falter under pressure.

Theodore Winslow had been about to exit when he noticed Nathan raising his hands, placing them deliberately on the polished mahogany table.

Nathan sat perfectly still, his expression unreadable yet radiating exhaustion. A chilling aura surrounded him like an invisible forcefield.

But what caught everyone's attention were the rings—specifically the Solitaire band gleaming on his left ring finger.

The Solitaire!

Theodore froze mid-step. When Nathan's icy gaze locked onto him, he barely suppressed a shudder before hastily retreating. Only outside did he dare exhale. That ring finger placement meant one thing: marriage.

The Solitaire was Sterling Enterprises' signature piece for singles. Yet Nathan wore it as a wedding band?

This man was utterly obsessed with Evelyn Sinclair.

Not that it mattered now. Once this interview aired, the world would see that ring. No advertising budget could buy this level of publicity.

At Sterling Enterprises headquarters, Evelyn was drowning in paperwork upon returning from Montevista.

She marveled at how her brother Alexander Sterling worked like a machine without rest. The moment one meeting ended, she'd barely closed her eyes when Bennett marched in with another stack of files. Rest was clearly a luxury.

"President Sinclair, HR submitted the new hire profiles. Three overseas graduates—here are their dossiers." Evelyn arched a brow. She always enjoyed reviewing fresh talent, watching blank resumes transform into powerhouses. Like Benjamin Carter, now capable of leading entire divisions.

When the Kingsley Tech deal finalized, the finance director position would undoubtedly be his.

Evelyn flipped a page absently. "Recruitment season hasn't started, has it?"

"Correct. These are emergency hires after recent resignations. We needed reinforcements for upcoming projects."

Her fingers stilled on the final resume.

Alexandra Montgomery.

On paper, her credentials seemed decent. But compared to the other candidates? Pathetically inadequate.

"Since when did our standards plummet?"

Evelyn could've pulled random interns with stronger qualifications. Bennett hesitated. "Ms. Montgomery—"

"Spit it out."

"She... produced a family photo with you during interviews. Called you 'cousin.' Phoned Chairman Sterling live, addressing him as 'uncle'—"

Evelyn massaged her temples. A migraine threatened.

Alexandra had zero self-awareness.

Bennett studied her expression cautiously. "HR is uncertain how to proceed with Ms. Montgomery..."

Sterling Enterprises had no room for dead weight. Every employee earned their place through merit.

Alexandra? She was defective goods.

Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Standard probation. One year. Terminate immediately if incompetent. Assign her to project teams."

Bennett blinked. Project teams were the corporate trenches.

"With her skills, a smaller firm might—"

"This isn't a retirement home." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Allowing her through those doors was mercy enough. If she complains? Show her the exit."

Bennett nodded sharply. 'Exit' meant immediate termination.

"Understood. Arrangements will be made."
###Chapter 702

Bennett turned and left without another word.

Evelyn Sinclair continued reviewing the investment proposal. Their strategy couldn't remain one-dimensional.

Alexander Sterling had already suggested re-entering the real estate market.

Everyone knew the industry had been stagnant for years.

But stagnation meant opportunity—for those bold enough to seize it.

Alexander’s argument had convinced her.

The AI project was stable now, running smoothly without constant oversight. It was time to shift focus.

That afternoon, Evelyn and Alexander devised a plan for a surprise inspection of the project team.

Evelyn wore a crisp white blouse and a sleek fishtail skirt that accentuated her slender waist and long legs. Her heels clicked against the floor as she strode into the department.

She stood at the center of the room, radiant and commanding. Even Alexander fell into step behind her.

Everyone knew who Evelyn Sinclair was.

The woman once dismissed as a scandal had clawed her way to the top with ruthless precision. Now, no one dared underestimate her.

The office was in chaos—employees chatting idly at their desks, gossiping in the break room, some even watching shows on their screens.

"President Sinclair?"

They had to distinguish between her and Alexander, so she was President Sinclair, not President Sterling.

The room fell silent.

Shocked faces turned toward them, eyes wide.

Evelyn smiled. "Working hard, I see. Where’s Mr. Reeves?"

People glanced around, confused. Then someone pointed toward the inner office. "He’s in there—"

"Thank you." Evelyn strode forward. Bennett knocked and opened the door.

"Who—? Oh. President Sterling. President Sinclair."

Jonathan Reeves sounded like he’d seen a ghost.

"Evelyn? Alexander? What are you doing here?"

Another voice cut through the air. Alexandra Montgomery.

Jonathan’s office now held an extra desk and computer—where Alexandra sat. Evelyn’s lips curved faintly. "You’re here?"

"Mr. Reeves was kind enough to accommodate me. It’s too noisy out there, so he gave me this space. First day, and already treated so well..." Alexandra shot Jonathan a grateful look. He nodded, pleased.

Evelyn and Alexander’s expressions remained icy.

"I’ll make coffee—" Alexandra started to rise.

"Don’t trouble yourself, Ms. Montgomery. Someone else can handle that." Jonathan smiled.

Evelyn scoffed.

The air turned frigid.

Jonathan’s smile faltered as he faced them. "To what do I owe this visit?"

Alexander stood silently, his presence alone enough to intimidate.

Evelyn took charge. "Mr. Reeves, your department receives the highest bonuses. Yet the effort I see doesn’t justify it."

Jonathan paled. "I—"

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the small desk—and the computer screen.

Her eyes narrowed.

Alexandra had set their group photo as her wallpaper?

Was she that desperate to flaunt their connection?

For a moment, Evelyn was speechless.

She pointed. "If you can waste time on trivial matters, why not focus on actual work?"

"Trivial?" Jonathan’s face whitened further.
###Chapter 703

Evelyn Sinclair arched an eyebrow at Bennett. The photograph Alexandra Montgomery produced couldn't possibly compare to her words.

How utterly absurd!

"Ms. Montgomery is still an intern. Whether she stays or goes is her own concern. But if Mr. Reeves wishes to resign from his position, we certainly won't object."

Jonathan Reeves turned deathly pale.

Evelyn's statement made it crystal clear - she wouldn't be Alexandra's protector.

He'd backed the wrong horse. Time to focus on damage control.

Evelyn moved to the sofa, accepting the documents Bennett handed her.

"Let's be honest, Sterling Enterprises has thrived this year. Project after project keeps coming in." Her gaze sharpened. "Yet none seem connected to your department."

The AI initiative was Evelyn's brainchild. The major contracts resulted from Alexander Sterling's negotiations. The remaining collaborations involved Sterling's subsidiary brands.

So what purpose did the project department actually serve?

Jonathan shot a panicked look at Alexander, who remained stone-faced. Why would Alexander defend him?

"President Sinclair, I—"

Evelyn raised a hand, silencing him. A cold smile played on her lips. "Under normal circumstances, we'd be having this discussion in the executive suite. The only reason we're here today is to witness firsthand how our company cultivates... mediocrity."

Each word carried venom. Her calm delivery made the rebuke more terrifying than any shouted reprimand.

Jonathan shivered. Being fired at nearly forty would be catastrophic. "President Sinclair, I'll—I'll ensure everyone returns to proper work immediately!"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Don't be hasty, Mr. Reeves. Everyone at Sterling Enterprises was hired for their talent. Your team consists of the best among them." Her voice turned icy. "Yet you've reduced these elites to this pitiful state. How exactly do you plan to compensate for my company's losses?"

Jonathan's legs buckled. As a senior executive earning millions annually, his family depended entirely on him. Unemployment meant ruin.

Fear gripped him. Though Evelyn had only recently taken charge, her ruthless efficiency was legendary. She'd even taken on the board members before. Was he next?

"P-President Sinclair—" His voice shook.

Evelyn looked away, her tone shifting to something almost pleasant. "However, I'm aware you survived the last major restructuring. My father left you to my brother not because you remained neutral, but because your competence is undeniable." Her gaze hardened. "Comfort breeds complacency. But I won't tolerate incompetence. You have two choices—resign gracefully and we part amicably, or prove you can still lead this department to excellence."

Silence filled the room.

Jonathan stared in disbelief. She was offering him a chance to stay?

He straightened, sudden determination replacing his fear. "I'll excel at every project. Whatever it takes!"

Evelyn glanced at Alexander before addressing Jonathan again. "Review these materials first. We'll discuss next steps afterward." With that, she departed as decisively as she'd arrived.

Alexander stood, clapping Jonathan's shoulder. "Thank President Sinclair. She's the only reason you're still here." The unspoken message was clear—without Evelyn's intervention, he'd already be gone.
###Chapter 704

Jonathan Reeves' body turned ice cold.

Alexandra Montgomery entered with coffee in hand. "Mr. Reeves, have my cousins left?"

Jonathan gave her a complicated look, pressed his lips together, and pointed to her small desk.

"Clear your things out. From now on, you'll be treated like everyone else here. Do your job properly!"

Alexandra's face stiffened.

"Did you misunderstand something? As you saw earlier, Evelyn and Alexander are my cousins!"

"There's no misunderstanding. Sterling Enterprises treats everyone equally. And I suggest you change that group photo on your desktop wallpaper. We don’t tolerate nepotism here. Merit is what matters."

Jonathan took a deep breath. As a middle-aged man who had nearly lost his job, he couldn’t afford any missteps.

"W-Why?"

Alexandra didn’t understand. Why had Jonathan’s attitude toward her shifted so drastically after Evelyn and Alexander’s visit?

Had they said something about her?

"Because this is my department!" Jonathan snapped impatiently. "If you’re unhappy, go complain to President Alexander or President Evelyn. If that’s not enough, take it up with Chairman Sterling himself!"

It was clear Jonathan had no intention of catering to a privileged relative who had gotten in through connections.

Alexandra clenched her jaw. Furious, she stormed upstairs to confront Evelyn.

But Sterling Enterprises had strict rules—only senior leaders and those with prior appointments could enter Evelyn’s workspace. Alexandra had no such privilege.

They were cousins, yet she didn’t even have Evelyn’s phone number. She pestered the receptionist relentlessly until he finally lost patience and called Bennett.

Bennett considered refusing outright, but given Alexandra’s relation to Evelyn, he reluctantly informed her.

Evelyn smirked when she heard. "Let her in."

Bennett raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Less than a minute later, Alexandra barged into the office, seething. But the moment Evelyn lifted her gaze, the icy chill in her eyes froze Alexandra mid-step.

The words died in Alexandra’s throat.

What right did she have to complain?

Had she forgotten how she’d gotten into Sterling Enterprises in the first place?

The Sterling relatives had been sent away on New Year’s Eve, each one more anxious than the last, terrified the family would cut ties with them.

The two women who had spoken ill of Evelyn had been publicly named and shamed. Everyone wanted to drag them back to grovel at Evelyn’s feet.

One of those women was Alexandra’s mother.

That New Year’s Eve had been anything but auspicious.

Evelyn tapped her fingers impatiently against the desk. "I heard you wanted to see me?"

Every second was precious to Evelyn. She had no time to waste on Alexandra.

Alexandra hesitated, then quickly slipped back into her delicate, pitiful act.

"Evelyn, did you say something to Mr. Reeves? Right after you left, he told me to clear out of the office. Did I… do something to upset you?"

Evelyn’s lips thinned. Did Alexandra do something to upset her?

Bennett, standing to the side, couldn’t take it anymore. Someone like this wasn’t worth Evelyn’s time.

He cleared his throat. "Ms. Montgomery, I believe Mr. Reeves simply realized his oversight. The office space is reserved for specific personnel—rules that apply to everyone."

Alexandra bit her lip. "But… I’m your cousin. I just wanted to be closer to Mr. Reeves so I could learn faster—"

Bennett’s eye twitched. He was truly at a loss for words.
###Chapter 705

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze. Her striking features carried an icy elegance that seemed carved into her very bones. Seated across from Alexandra Montgomery, who stood rigidly, the contrast between them was stark—like fire and frost.

"Alexandra," Evelyn began, her voice smooth but edged with steel. "Let's not pretend you earned your place here. With your qualifications, Sterling Enterprises would never have hired you. I allowed you this internship out of courtesy—nothing more. But if you continue acting entitled, I'll ensure no company in this city touches you after I fire you."

A faint smile played on Evelyn's lips, as though discussing the weather. Alexandra, however, paled. The threat was unmistakable.

Yet, for once, Alexandra had no retort. She pressed her lips together, fingers tightening around her bag.

"Evelyn, I was hired through standard procedures. My credentials are legitimate—"

Evelyn cut her off with a scoff. She snatched Alexandra's resume from the desk and tossed it at her.

"Legitimate?" Evelyn arched a brow. "You claimed you interned at a Fortune 50 company, but when I called, they'd never heard of you. You listed yourself as a key contributor to a university research project, yet your professor said you quit after a week because you couldn’t keep up."

Each word struck like a whip. Alexandra's face drained of color.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn to fact-check her lies.

Evelyn leaned back, cold satisfaction in her gaze. "Falsifying your resume is grounds for immediate termination. But since you're here, I'll reevaluate your performance. One misstep, and you're gone."

A pause. Then Evelyn added, almost casually, "Oh, and let’s be clear—the only reason my father tolerates you is sentimentality. Play your games with him if you must, but if I hear you spreading rumors in this office, your file will reflect exactly why no one should hire you."

Alexandra trembled, her earlier arrogance shattered. Without another word, she turned and fled.

Bennett, standing nearby, nearly applauded.

Evelyn didn’t just excel in business—she dismantled schemers like Alexandra with terrifying precision.

Once the door shut, Evelyn turned to him. "Is the meeting with Leonard Whitmore confirmed?"

"Yes. At the Aspen Lodge. Zachary Montgomery will accompany him."

Evelyn nodded. "Ensure Jonathan Reeves attends."

This dinner was for him, after all.

Bennett relayed the message immediately.

"Also," he added, "Solitaire’s pre-launch buzz is exceeding projections. Sales is ready. Barring issues, we’ll launch tomorrow as planned."

Evelyn exhaled, tension easing. Solitaire was her passion project—a culmination of meticulous planning. The hype was undeniable.

If only Nathan Blackwood hadn’t been part of it.
###Chapter 706

Evelyn's fingers traced the intricate design of her ring. The platinum band felt cool against her skin, its delicate craftsmanship catching the light.

Bennett cleared his throat. "Speaking of which, Mr. Blackwood made an appearance on a talk show yesterday. He was wearing 'Solitaire' during the interview."

He hesitated before continuing. "It's caused quite a stir online. Trending on all platforms. Should we issue a statement?"

At the mention of Nathan's name, Evelyn felt a sharp pain behind her temples.

They hadn't crossed paths in months, yet his presence seemed to haunt her daily life. Like an unwanted shadow that refused to fade.

She took three measured breaths before responding. "No. Let him have his moment in the spotlight."

Bennett nodded in understanding and began coordinating their next steps.

The afternoon passed in a blur.

Evelyn collected Jonathan Reeves from the office, with Bennett accompanying them to the private Aspen Lodge. Discretion was paramount when dealing with clients of this caliber - hence the exclusive resort with its gated security and elite amenities.

Jonathan rubbed his temples, still processing the afternoon's documents. The speed at which this meeting had been arranged surprised even him.

Evelyn scrolled through emails on her phone, barely glancing up. When she finally put her device away, Bennett handed her a chia seed parfait with fresh berries - fuel before the evening's negotiations.

She noticed Jonathan's nervous fidgeting and smiled. "Relax, Mr. Reeves. This will be elementary for someone of your experience."

Jonathan mopped his brow. "Ms. Sinclair, I must confess confusion. That project has been dormant for years - considered toxic by every major firm. Is tonight's meeting connected to it?"

Evelyn's almond-shaped eyes sparkled with quiet confidence. "Precisely."

Jonathan's mouth fell open. "But we're in the midst of a real estate downturn. That particular parcel has bankrupted three developers already. Why would Sterling Enterprises take interest now?"

Evelyn turned toward the window. The setting sun painted her porcelain skin in golden hues, highlighting the determined set of her jaw.

Her voice held quiet conviction when she finally spoke. "True visionaries see opportunity where others see ruin."

She turned back to face him, her smile radiant. "Sandford is on the verge of significant development. Our sources indicate this project will soon receive municipal backing."

She left the statement hanging, watching as understanding dawned in Jonathan's eyes. With government support and Sterling's resources behind them, failure wasn't an option.

Jonathan suddenly sat taller, decades seeming to fall away from his posture. The prospect of revitalizing a failed venture ignited long-dormant passion.

As their car pulled into the resort, Bennett leaned close. "Mr. Whitmore just arrived. He's waiting at the entrance."

Evelyn stepped out gracefully, smoothing her dress. Her gaze swept across the valet area - then froze.

Nathan Blackwood stood beside a sleek black sedan, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.
###Chapter 707

The air carried an unseasonable chill that clung to the skin.

Evelyn Sinclair didn't understand why Nathan Blackwood had appeared, but there was no time to dwell on it. She forced a polished smile as she approached, extending her hand in greeting.

"Mr. Whitmore, my apologies for keeping you waiting—"

The slightly round-faced Leonard Whitmore chuckled warmly as he shook her hand. "I only just arrived myself. Ms. Sinclair, you're even more stunning than the actresses on magazine covers. No wonder social media begs for you to enter the entertainment industry!"

Evelyn laughed lightly. "You flatter me. I could never compare to professionals. I'm just a simple businesswoman with a spreadsheet addiction."

Leonard seemed pleasantly surprised by her humility. The mood remained relaxed.

He turned slightly, addressing the shadowed figure behind him. "Don't you agree, Mr. Blackwood? Ms. Sinclair outshines any celebrity. Her presence alone would eclipse every starlet in Hollywood."

Nathan's voice was rough velvet. "Undoubtedly."

Leonard chuckled, turning back. "Mr. Blackwood requested an earlier meeting, but my assistant botched the scheduling. Since you're already acquainted, I thought we might combine the discussions. You don't mind, do you, Ms. Sinclair?"

Nathan stepped forward from the dim lighting. Dressed in immaculate black, his broad shoulders cut a striking silhouette. His gaze burned with something unreadable.

Ignoring him was impossible.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Not at all."

Internally, she screamed, Yes, I mind! Get him out of here!

Nathan's lips curled as he extended his hand. "Ms. Sinclair. It's been too long."

Since their last encounter after New Year's, the absence had gnawed at him. The longing had settled deep, relentless.

Now, finally, she stood before him again.

Evelyn met his gaze with practiced indifference, offering a polite handshake while mentally cursing him. "Mr. Blackwood. A pleasure."

Is this some kind of game? She withdrew her hand instantly, turning back to Leonard with a bright smile. "Shall we?"

The group moved inside. Before dinner, Leonard suggested poker. Evelyn agreed, instructing Bennett to arrange it.

Leonard, Evelyn, Nathan, and Jonathan Reeves settled around the table for a four-player game.

To foster rapport between Jonathan and Leonard, Evelyn deliberately folded repeatedly, letting them win. Nathan observed from the sidelines, his expression unreadable. He played along, losing several rounds—so much so that Evelyn wondered if he even knew the rules.

By the end, Leonard was beaming from his victories. Jonathan looked equally pleased. Soon, they were addressing each other as "bro," their camaraderie loosened by the playful competition. Sensing the perfect moment, Evelyn suggested they move to dinner. Everyone agreed eagerly.

Leonard and Jonathan led the way. Unintentionally, Evelyn and Nathan fell behind.

Nathan carried a faint trace of tobacco—not overpowering, just enough to linger on his clothes—mingled with the warmth of bergamot tea. The combination was distractingly familiar.

Evelyn's focus wavered.

She missed a step.

Her stomach lurched as she realized she was about to meet the floor face-first. Resigned, she braced for impact.

Then—an arm hooked around her waist, yanking her backward into Nathan's chest.

The scent of him—warm, rich, intoxicating—flooded her senses. She froze.

His grip was unyielding. All evening, he had kept his distance. Now, with one touch, the invisible barrier between them shattered.

Something unspoken surged to the surface.

For a breathless moment, neither moved. Then Nathan's voice, low and rough, brushed her ear.

"Careful."

The concern in his tone sent a shiver down her spine.

His next words were a whisper. "Unless you wanted me to catch you."
###Chapter 708

Evelyn snapped back to reality and shoved Nathan away, breaking free from his embrace.

"Damn Nathan Blackwood and his constant need to show off!"

His single remark instantly evaporated all her gratitude.

She flipped her hair with practiced nonchalance. "Don't flatter yourself. Thanks."

Nathan's brows furrowed. 'Her mood swings faster than a pendulum.'

Closing the distance between them, he murmured, "That's it? Just 'thanks'? Ms. Sinclair, your gratitude is underwhelming."

'What more does he want?'

Evelyn suddenly wished she'd taken the fall. 'A bruised knee would hurt less than dealing with this infuriating man!'

Meeting his gaze with forced patience, she asked, "How exactly would you like me to thank you then?"

'The only reason I almost fell was because of you!' Not that she'd ever admit it aloud.

Their proximity made his scent unmistakable - the sharp cologne had faded, leaving only the subtle aroma of Earl Grey tea. The comforting warmth of it softened his usual icy demeanor. Before she could process this observation, Nathan's face suddenly filled her vision. His cool lips brushed her forehead with butterfly lightness before retreating.

Evelyn froze. When her senses returned, she aimed a kick at his shin, but he anticipated the move, trapping her leg between his with effortless grace. A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. "Try that again and you'll be responsible for this cripple for life." His fingers casually tucked a stray lock behind her ear.

"This is the only form of gratitude I accept."

His whisper barely reached her ears as he stepped back, putting deliberate distance between them as he rejoined Leonard Whitmore's side.

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose. 'The audacity! He takes liberties then acts like he's done me a favor? Where does Nathan Blackwood get his goddamn confidence?'

Bennett, observing from a discreet distance, hadn't expected Nathan's bold move. Clearly, his flirtation backfired spectacularly - Evelyn looked ready to commit murder.

The group settled in the private dining room. Evelyn maintained perfect composure, carefully avoiding eye contact with Nathan lest she actually follow through on her violent impulses. 'Patience. I'll settle this later.'

Pre-ordered dishes began arriving, though both Leonard and Nathan added selections to the menu. The atmosphere remained deceptively pleasant.

Evelyn initiated the first toast to Leonard, who responded with equal enthusiasm. She downed her wine in one impressive gulp, earning approving glances from the table.

Nathan's expression darkened imperceptibly.

After draining his glass, Leonard got straight to business. "The Sandford development has been designated a priority project, yet no company wants to touch it. Given past failures, we can't risk handing it to just anyone. President Sinclair, what makes you interested?"

When his address shifted from "Ms. Sinclair" to "President," Evelyn's smile widened.

Finally, the real conversation began.

"Precisely because others failed is why Sterling Enterprises wants it. The challenge excites us. Our reputation speaks for itself - we thrive on impossible projects." Her confident delivery made Leonard study her with new respect.

His gaze flicked to Nathan with knowing amusement. "You two sound rehearsed. No wonder people keep pushing you together. Excellence recognizes excellence, I suppose."

Evelyn's smile faltered as she turned to Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood, you're pursuing this project too?"
###Chapter 709

Evelyn Sinclair was taken aback. The project had been discussed in strict confidence—only she, Alexander Sterling, and Jonathan Reeves were privy to it.

Not a single word should have leaked.

Why is Nathan Blackwood suddenly interested in the same project? How is this even possible?

Nathan’s striking features remained impassive, though the faintest smirk tugged at his lips. His dark eyes were unreadable.

"Apparently, we have the same target. I only just found out myself."

An uncomfortable silence settled over the group.

Leonard Whitmore cleared his throat awkwardly. "So... you two didn’t coordinate this?"

How awkward indeed.

Evelyn laughed lightly, brushing it off. "It’s fine. Whoever secures the project, it’s still a win."

Nathan swirled the wine in his glass, his expression inscrutable.

Blackwood Industries and Sterling Enterprises were titans in their own right—equally matched in resources and influence. Either one could handle the project effortlessly. But what happened when both wanted it?

How had this overlooked venture suddenly become a coveted prize?

When their gazes locked, neither wavered.

Neither was willing to back down.

The rest of dinner passed with forced pleasantries, the topic carefully avoided. Afterward, Leonard was escorted out, visibly relieved. With two powerhouses vying for his project, he no longer had to worry about finding a buyer.

Outside, the biting wind cut through the night. Evelyn had left her coat inside, so Bennett had gone back to retrieve it. She stood at the entrance, tall and poised, her face a mask of cool indifference.

Nathan’s interference had ruined her plans. Securing the project should have been straightforward—the real challenge lay in execution.

But now, she was stumbling at the first hurdle.

Her thoughts were still churning when footsteps approached from behind. Probably Bennett.

Then, warmth draped over her shoulders. The scent of bergamot and cedar enveloped her, pulling her from her thoughts.

Evelyn stiffened. She didn’t need to turn to know who it was.

She glanced sideways and met Nathan’s piercing gaze.

The doorway light carved sharp shadows across his face, accentuating his flawless features. That face had fooled many—but not her. Without a word, she moved to shrug off his coat.

Nathan caught her wrist, his grip firm. His voice was low. "It’s cold. Keep it."

Evelyn withdrew her hand but didn’t protest further. Instead, she smirked.

"Mr. Blackwood, I didn’t take you for a gentleman."

The man who wouldn’t blink at others’ suffering.

Nathan exhaled sharply at her jab but changed the subject.

"Why real estate?" It wasn’t what he’d expected from her.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why not ask yourself the same?"

A flicker of amusement crossed his face.

"Fortune favors the bold."

Their eyes locked again, and in that moment, Nathan saw it—they were cut from the same cloth. Not content with playing it safe, they thrived on risk.

The realization sent a thrill through him. The woman he loved was his equal in every way.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Or it leaves you with nothing."
###Chapter 710

The night swallowed everything like spilled ink.

Nathan Blackwood studied Evelyn Sinclair's profile in silence.

His voice dropped an octave. "The investment risk is too high. If Sterling Enterprises wants to enter real estate, you should start with safer ventures—"

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "Mr. Blackwood, any competent negotiator knows 'you're inexperienced' is amateur tactics. Save your breath. This project will be mine."

Nathan's gaze darkened.

He'd miscalculated.

The woman who once bent to his will now stood toe-to-toe with Blackwood Industries.

After a weighted pause, his tone turned gravelly. "This concerns Blackwood's expansion. I won't concede."

'Unless she insists...' The traitorous thought unsettled him.

Evelyn arched one perfect brow. "Neither will I. May the best corporation win."

Bennett materialized with her sable coat.

"Ms. Sinclair— Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn shrugged off Nathan's jacket, letting it fall into his arms. Bennett draped her coat over her shoulders with practiced ease. Nathan's jaw clenched at their familiarity. His glare could've frozen lava.

Bennett shivered violently.

Nathan's attention snapped back to Evelyn, voice softening unnaturally. "Joint development remains an option."

Sterling and Blackwood had partnered successfully before. Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. The gala had drained her.

"Spare me. Sterling Enterprises doesn't need charity."

Even if they lost, the setback wouldn't cripple them. His condescension grated.

Their collaboration on the Kingsley Tech deal already drew scrutiny. Further entanglement risked dangerous dependence.

Bennett cleared his throat after checking his phone. "Ms. Sinclair, your father expects us."

Evelyn nodded. Her Maybach glided to the curb.

Bennett opened the rear door. He took the opposite seat just as Nathan wrenched Evelyn's door back open.

Icy wind invaded the cabin.

Evelyn exhaled through her nose. "What now?"

Nathan's Adam's apple bobbed. After three heartbeats, he murmured, "Sleep well, Evelyn."

"Get lost."

The door slammed. His death stare at Bennett could've vaporized steel.

Every man near Evelyn set his teeth on edge.

Yet he'd forfeited all rights.

Nathan watched her taillights vanish, grinding his molars. 'I'm hiring her a female assistant after our remarriage.'

Harrison arrived with the Bentley.

His flawless door-opening technique earned Nathan's approval. Competent subordinates knew their place.

En route, Harrison misread Nathan's mood. "Sir, did we secure the deal?"

"No."

Awkward silence.

Nathan suddenly declared, "Your salary's doubling."

Harrison choked on air.
###Chapter 711

The moment Evelyn stepped into the car, exhaustion hit her like a tidal wave.

Before she knew it, they had arrived at Sterling Manor.

Bennett sat beside her, quietly organizing the scattered documents. By the time Evelyn exited the vehicle, everything was neatly arranged.

She walked through the grand entrance still half-asleep, but the sight of Alexander waiting in the foyer instantly jolted her awake.

"You're still up?"

William emerged from his study. Seeing his daughter home, he descended the marble staircase to join them.

Alexander nodded. "I had a feeling your night wouldn't go smoothly."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "How did you know?"

Leaning back against the plush sofa, Alexander stretched his long legs. "Nathan kept his interest in the Sandford project under wraps. My contacts at Blackwood Industries only just uncovered it."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. Corporate espionage was standard practice - just as Nathan undoubtedly had moles within Sterling Enterprises.

They'd simply been exceptionally good at keeping secrets.

The butler appeared with a steaming cup of hot chocolate. Though Evelyn rarely indulged, the rich aroma proved irresistible.

William stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Blackwood Industries has decades of real estate experience. Their advantage is undeniable."

"When Nathan single-handedly drove San Francisco's property values through the roof, he nearly achieved monopoly status. Smaller firms made fortunes just picking up his crumbs. Then, when no one expected it, he abandoned real estate entirely and pivoted to industrialization. Before the market could react, property values crashed. The man's a business savant!"

Even William's grudging admiration told Evelyn she'd severely underestimated Nathan from the beginning.

Alexander's voice remained neutral. "He's always preferred swimming against the tide. Arrogance, mostly. This time won't be any different."

Evelyn said nothing, but privately agreed. Knowing Nathan, he'd relish stirring up trouble during a market downturn.

A slow smile curved her lips as she settled deeper into the sofa. "Nothing's decided yet. The game's far from over."

"Little E, you're really going through with this?" Alexander studied her.

She met his gaze squarely. "Why wouldn't I? Should we retreat just because Nathan Blackwood's involved? He has his methods, I have mine. Even if we lose, we'll do it with dignity."

William slapped his knee. "That's my girl! Healthy competition never hurt anyone. Besides, I'd bet on you over Nathan any day!"

Though concern lingered in Alexander's eyes, both Evelyn and William's determination left no room for argument.

"Fine. You have my support. But remember - while Mr. Whitmore has final approval, we need to acquire Zenith Corp first. Start there."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with renewed energy. She'd nearly forgotten that crucial detail. "Perfect! I'll prepare for both scenarios. Don't worry!"

Alexander stood and ruffled her hair affectionately. "You're handling this much better than Donovan would."

Evelyn blinked. "What's Donovan done now? Is he back?" William released a long-suffering sigh.

"Don't ask. Your brother's emotional intelligence remains nonexistent. When visiting the Whitakers, he insulted half the family. They complimented his intelligence, so he launched into a lecture on human evolutionary theory. They took it as an insult to their intellect. The meeting ended... poorly."

Evelyn's lips twitched. That sounded exactly like Donovan.
###Chapter 712

Evelyn sighed as she climbed the stairs, her heart heavy with pity for Donovan.

Bennett worked with remarkable efficiency. After receiving Evelyn's late-night instructions, he had all the documents regarding Zenith Corp's Sandford project on her desk by morning.

She raised an eyebrow when she saw the stack of files. "Did you pull an all-nighter?"

Bennett smirked. "This information isn't exactly classified. Anyone in Sandford could get their hands on it."

Evelyn nodded, lifting her coffee cup for a sip. But when she flipped open the first page, she nearly choked.

She'd assumed the project's losses stemmed from mismanagement. She never expected this level of corruption.

Zenith Corp hadn't turned a profit in years. Hundreds of employees were milking unemployment benefits while doing the company's dirty work.

This failing project had become Zenith's sole lifeline. Due to reckless practices, multiple accidents had occurred.

Located in Sandford's city center, this urban development was crucial for the city's expansion. Zenith had deliberately stalled progress to extort exorbitant compensation from unsuspecting investors.

The truth was chilling—Zenith's entire workforce were leeches bleeding the project dry.

Bennett cleared his throat. "President Sinclair, Zenith's reached the end of its rope. The company's leadership is corrupt. Funds disappear into their pockets, leaving scraps behind. The books show nothing—it's a black hole."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent for a moment. "We need to audit their accounts first."

"But—"

She inhaled sharply and reached for her phone.

"I'll contact Mr. Whitmore and have Jonathan Reeves investigate immediately."

With Leonard Whitmore's authorization, their audit would be legitimate.

As expected, Mr. Whitmore agreed instantly. Faced with such blatant corruption, he was eager to uncover the truth and reclaim control of the project.

That afternoon, Jonathan called from Sandford.

"Ms. Sinclair, Zenith's employees are closing ranks. They refuse to cooperate. The books appear clean—these people are cunning."

Evelyn hadn't anticipated such unity from a bankrupt company.

She paused. "Stay put. I'm coming."

Jonathan hesitated. "Ms. Sinclair, you should bring backup. The people here are... aggressive."

He'd chosen his words carefully. In reality, Zenith's employees were ruthless, undisciplined, and fearless. Jonathan had been intimidated by their arrogance within hours of arriving.

Evelyn hadn't expected this level of hostility but remained unfazed.

Just as she prepared to leave, Nathan Blackwood called.

Evelyn frowned. Now wasn't the time for distractions.

"Hello?"

"Are you going to Sandford?" Nathan's voice held unmistakable tension.

Her brows furrowed. How did he know?

"Yes."

So what if he did?

"Evelyn, do you realize how dangerous that is? You have people for this—why go yourself? What if something happens?" His tone turned icy.

She scoffed. "Mr. Blackwood, I appreciate your concern, but it's hardly a den of lions."

"Evelyn—"

Nathan's voice softened. "I know you're targeting that company, but those people are dangerous. They won't care who you are."
###Chapter 713

Three seconds of silence hung in the air.

Evelyn Sinclair finally composed herself. "I understand. I'll be ready. Thank you." Her gratitude was genuine before she ended the call.

Exclusive content from NovelDreams Publishing.

The arrow had to fly once the bowstring was drawn. From the moment Evelyn committed to this acquisition, she knew facing challenges head-on was inevitable.

Nathan Blackwood cursed under his breath, his anxiety mounting. He turned to Harrison. "We're going to Sandford."

Harrison immediately grasped the implication. "But we agreed with Mr. Whitmore that personal contact with the project team wasn't necessary?"

This was the privilege of someone like Nathan Blackwood - money solved problems without risking personal involvement.

Nathan's eyes darkened. "Evelyn went. Deploy extra security there immediately."

Harrison's expression turned grave. "Understood."

Upon arriving in Sandford, Evelyn marched straight into Zenith Corp's headquarters.

No one anticipated her bold move.

Jonathan Reeves had been waiting anxiously. Seeing Evelyn restored his courage. "Ms. Sinclair, this company claims cooperation but obstructs at every turn. We can only review partial ledgers with multiple management approvals. The process is excruciatingly slow—"

Evelyn moved with icy determination. "We're taking the books now."

Bennett followed closely, signaling their team as Evelyn strode forward unfazed.

It was Evelyn's first visit to Zenith Corp's offices. Employees scrambled to hide their cards - a familiar scene.

Her meaningful glance at the pale-faced Jonathan spoke volumes. The project team nearly lost their jobs over this.

Jonathan knew he had to prove his worth to Evelyn and the team.

Evelyn stormed into the finance department, throwing the door open.

Inside, Victor Langley lounged at his desk, joking lazily with colleagues. His expression soured instantly. "Evelyn Sinclair?"

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Surprised you recognize me."

Victor's eyes narrowed as he appraised her figure. "Hard to miss the most talked-about woman in business. You're practically my fantasy. What do you want?"

"You oversee Zenith Corp's finances? Victor Langley?" Evelyn confirmed.

"Your lapdog already told you?" Victor sneered. "If you want Zenith, name your price. Stop wasting time with audits."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Due diligence first. How else would we determine a fair offer?"

"Then don't bother. Blackwood Industries wants us too. Nathan Blackwood's easier to deal with than you." Victor's roaming gaze contrasted with Evelyn's impenetrable composure.

He wanted to touch her but hesitated - this was no ordinary woman.

Evelyn's smile chilled. "Nathan doesn't part with money easily. His funds aren't so accessible."

Victor slammed the table with a bully's grin. "Neither are my records. Company policy requires a dozen approvals. Our CEO's away for weeks. Care to wait?"

Clearly, Victor meant to obstruct her.

Others feared Evelyn's status as Sterling Enterprises' heiress, but what could a pampered princess really do?

Victor smirked, confident the ledgers wouldn't leave today.

Evelyn's lashes lowered briefly before meeting his gaze with an arctic smile. "Then we'll dispense with formalities. Bennett, have the team remove these."
###Chapter 714

Evelyn's command sent her team into immediate action. Two burly men pinned Victor Langley down as he struggled violently.

The rest moved with military precision, confiscating multiple ledger boxes from beneath Victor's desk.

Victor's eyes bulged in disbelief. Is this bitch robbing me in broad daylight?

The entire operation took under five minutes. Bennett approached with a silent nod. Evelyn flicked her wrist, signaling the bodyguard to release Victor's gagged mouth.

Gasping for air, Victor seethed. "You—"

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Our audit was authorized by the regulators. Take it up with them if you and Mr. Sinclair have complaints. Or call the police—I dare you."

She knew corrupt snakes like him wouldn't risk involving law enforcement.

A few strategic pushes, and they'd crack within days. The audit would be completed ahead of schedule.

Honestly, Nathan's concern was unnecessary. From the moment Evelyn took charge, she'd mapped every dirty secret in this operation.

Better to strike first than play defense.

Who was the real predator here?

Her polished smile vanished as she turned, stalking out in razor-sharp stilettos. Her team retreated like shadows.

Victor's face twisted. He scrambled for his phone, dialing Lawrence Sinclair, CEO of Zenith Corp, with trembling fingers.

His panicked report was met with three seconds of silence before Lawrence exploded. "You incompetent fool! Can't even handle one woman or protect basic paperwork? Enjoy prison!"

Victor paled. "S-Sir, what do we do?"

"Get those ledgers back! At any cost!"

They'd danced on the edge of legality for years, growing bolder with each unchecked crime. Once addicted to lawlessness, there was no going back.

Inside the armored car, Evelyn flipped through a ledger, her lips curling in disgust.

"No wonder Victor fought us. These violations would bury him for life."

Bennett tensed. "We should stay alert—"

The car lurched to a violent stop.

The driver stammered, "Ms. Sinclair—blockade ahead. They're surrounding us."

Evelyn's gaze snapped to the windows. Vehicles boxed them in from all sides—no advance, no retreat.

Her expression darkened. "Victor works fast."

Bennett's jaw clenched. "We're outnumbered."

They'd brought twelve elite bodyguards. The enemy had at least twenty. While her team could hold their own in a fight, this was Zenith Corp's turf. Reinforcements would swarm them.

Through the window, Evelyn assessed the disorganized mob.

Now she understood why this acquisition had been so contentious.

Victor swaggered forward, flanked by thugs, laughing like a hyena.

With this many hired muscle, how could he fear her small entourage?

"Scared yet, Ms. Sinclair?"

Bennett moved to call backup. Evelyn stopped him with a raised hand.

Too late.
###Chapter 715

Evelyn Sinclair didn't hesitate. "Backup won't make it in time. They're here for the ledgers."

Victor Langley's reactions weren't his own—further proof the accounts were compromised.

She pressed her lips together, mind racing for a solution.

If Victor walked away with those ledgers today, they'd never get them back.

He rapped on the car window, flashing a slimy grin. "Ms. Sterling, step out and let's talk. Since you're so eager for this project, hand over the books, and I'll let you and your people leave unharmed."

The scene was enough to terrify anyone.

Evelyn rolled down the window, revealing her striking features—calm, smiling, but her eyes were ice.

"Mr. Langley, what's mine stays mine unless I decide otherwise."

A shiver ran down his spine. For a second, fear gripped him—but then he scoffed. Why should I be scared of a woman? I've got numbers. I've got strength.

He smirked. "You're joking, right? This isn't your playground, sweetheart."

His gaze lingered—too long. He'd bedded plenty of pretty faces, but none like hers.

"Say something nice, though, and maybe I'll let you have your way—"

Before he could finish, the car door swung open—hard.

Evelyn stepped out in one fluid motion, slamming the door straight into him. Victor hit the pavement with a grunt.

He scrambled up, face twisted in fury. "You stupid bitch! You think you can hit me? Look around!"

She stood over him, heels clicking as she closed the distance. "Just reminding you who's in charge."

Then she pulled out the baseball bat from the car.

Victor paled.

She swung.

The crack of wood against bone echoed. He howled, clutching his shoulder. Twice in one damn day.

His men surged forward, clubs raised.

Evelyn's bodyguards moved faster—forming an unbreakable wall around her.

Victor's thugs charged. Chaos erupted.

She didn't flinch. Just watched Victor with cold amusement.

He couldn't believe it. No fear. No hesitation.

She was already acting like she'd won.

Gritting his teeth, he staggered up—just in time to see him approaching from behind Evelyn.

The look in his eyes was pure murder.
###Chapter 716

Evelyn's focus remained locked on the chaotic scene unfolding before her. The thugs showed surprising restraint - while they fought viciously against her security team, none dared approach her directly.

A sudden movement caught her peripheral vision. Victor Langley was attempting to slink away unnoticed.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Victor was the linchpin in controlling this mob. Letting him escape wasn't an option.

Just as she moved to intercept him, Bennett's panicked shout sliced through the noise. "Ms. Sinclair! Behind you!"

Her body tensed before her mind fully processed the warning. The hairs on her neck stood up as she sensed the approaching threat. Too late to dodge.

Then something unexpected happened.

Victor lunged toward her with shocking speed, his face contorted in terror. His body collided with hers just as the attacker swung. A sickening thud echoed through the warehouse.

"Goddamn it! What the hell was that for?" Victor howled, clutching his head.

"Y-you jumped in the way!" the would-be attacker stammered.

"Who the fuck kicked me?" Victor roared, trembling with rage.

Evelyn didn't turn. Her gaze fixed on the new arrival storming through the warehouse doors with an entourage of armed men.

Nathan Blackwood cut through the shadows like a blade through silk. His tailored black coat billowed behind him, eyes burning with barely restrained fury. The embodiment of controlled violence descending into chaos.

The winter wind howled through the broken windows, but Nathan moved as if untouched by the cold. When he reached Evelyn, his dark eyes held a tempest of emotions.

The unbridled rage in his gaze wasn't directed at her, but at the audacity of those who'd threatened what was his.

His inspection was thorough, lingering on the baseball bat clenched in her white-knuckled grip. A muscle twitched in his jaw.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn kept her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins.

His appearance had been unexpected, his timing impeccable. Without his intervention, Victor's man would have struck true. A rare miscalculation on her part.

Nathan ignored her question. "Does it hurt?" His deep voice carried an edge as he nodded toward her grip on the bat.

Evelyn's lips thinned.

Victor's reaction to Nathan's presence was immediate. All bluster drained from his face. "N-Nathan Blackwood?"

The reinforcements tipped the scales completely. Victor's street thugs stood no chance against the professional security teams.

"Mr. Blackwood," Victor wheedled, "you want this project too, right? Name your price. Don't throw away this opportunity over some woman—"

Nathan tuned out the desperate bargaining. His attention remained fixed on Evelyn. When she didn't respond, he reached out and pried the bat from her grasp.

His smile was all sharp edges and dangerous promises. "This isn't your style." From his waistband, he produced a sleek, custom pistol and offered it to her. "Try this instead."

Evelyn stared at the weapon, momentarily speechless.
###Chapter 717

Nathan's casual movement sent an icy chill through the room.

Victor Langley's knees buckled in terror. He didn't dare question whether the object in Nathan's hand might be aimed at his skull.

Evelyn Sinclair accepted it without flinching, her composure unshaken.

'What kind of monsters are these people?' Victor's face drained of color. Bone-deep fear turned his blood to ice as tremors wracked his body.

Evelyn spun the weapon expertly between her fingers. Nathan then guided her hand, directing the barrel toward Victor.

Tension crackled in the air.

Nathan's expression remained blank, his voice dangerously calm. "Was it him? Just pull the trigger."

Impatience laced his words. The crimson in his eyes betrayed barely restrained fury. Consequences meant nothing to him - causing trouble was second nature.

But frightening Evelyn? That changed everything.

Victor collapsed to his knees, hands raised in surrender. "I beg your mercy! I was wrong! Mr. Blackwood, please spare me!"

They wouldn't be fooled by obvious deception. The company maintained two sets of books - one public, one private.

Victor never anticipated Evelyn's directness. She'd seen through the facade and demanded the hidden records.

Exposing those books meant prison for both Victor and Lawrence Sinclair.

His hesitation earned him the ominous click of the gun's hammer. Evelyn's glacial smile left no room for misunderstanding.

Life or ledgers? The choice was simple.

Twenty minutes later, the scene cleared. Victor led them to his home where the real books were hidden - too terrified of Evelyn's weapon to attempt deception.

Mission accomplished, Evelyn's team departed with the evidence.

Left behind, Victor collapsed in relief, mopping his brow.

Inside the car, Evelyn examined the weapon with quiet amusement. Her shooting experience made the toy gun's weight immediately obvious.

Bennett found himself unwillingly ushered into Nathan's vehicle by Harrison, while Nathan himself took the seat beside Evelyn.
###Chapter 718

Nathan's lips curved when he noticed Evelyn's gaze lingering on the gun in her palm.

"Like what you see?"

She hesitated for a beat before handing it back.

"Fakes can still intimidate, huh?"

Amusement deepened in his eyes as he tucked it away. "The real one's with me. If you pull the trigger, I'll follow through. No consequences for you."

He'd shoulder all the responsibility.

Nathan wanted Evelyn to act without restraint.

Her breath hitched. A faint tremor ran through her as she studied his profile.

"Why are you here?"

His smile dimmed. "I warned you these waters are treacherous. Did you think I'd let you dive in alone?"

His low, rough voice filled the car's interior.

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Thanks. But aren't you worried I'll beat you to Leonard Whitmore for the Pacific Heights deal?"

Nathan's gaze sharpened. He turned fully toward her. "You don't trust me?"

"Trust requires foundation." She stated it plainly. "We have none."

Silence stretched between them.

An unnatural chill radiated from Nathan. Odd.

"So you're meeting Whitmore?"

His jaw tightened briefly. "Yes."

His schedule was packed—he'd intended to discuss the project anyway. But Evelyn exposing his motives rankled.

As if his actions weren't purely for her sake.

Evelyn nearly snorted. Hypocrite.

Though competing, their methods diverged completely. No direct conflict. The victor remained undecided.

Nathan glanced at her. "Take these ledgers back to San Francisco for analysis. Staying here's too risky."

She arched a brow, smiling without commitment.

"Still, I owe you for today." Nathan relaxed slightly. Then how will you repay me?

Evelyn cut off his unspoken thought.

"Dinner. My treat."

His eyebrows shot up. Her first invitation.

Far from the gratitude he'd envisioned, but sharing a peaceful meal alone held its own appeal.

"Home-cooked?" Nathan ventured.

Evelyn looked away. The audacity.

"No. Feel free to handle the cooking yourself." As if I'd step into a kitchen for him.

Years of marriage had destroyed any culinary patience she possessed.

Nathan's lashes lowered, masking disappointment. "Fine. I'll cook."

He wondered how it would feel—preparing a meal for someone he loved.

Evelyn rolled her eyes discreetly. What's his game now? Nathan Blackwood cooking? Please.

The mighty CEO was about to face his first culinary defeat.

The car halted at Sterling Enterprises' hotel. Evelyn exited.

Nathan followed, glancing up. "I'll have ingredients delivered. Expect me by seven. Rest until then."

She watched his car depart before Bennett approached. "Ma'am—"

Evelyn entered the elevator.

"Find a reliable third-party auditor. Work with our team to identify the ledger discrepancies. Submit everything to authorities within four hours."

Bennett blinked. That fast?

Her gaze sharpened. "Lawrence Sinclair returns tomorrow. We move before they can react." Speed was their weapon.
###Chapter 719

Bennett understood Evelyn's meaning immediately and gave a solemn nod.

"Understood. That situation earlier was too intense. Do you want to rest first? Or should we head back to the office? I can handle things here."

Evelyn shook her head without hesitation. "No, I'm staying. Get Jonathan Reeves to clean this up properly."

Bennett knew Evelyn's temperament well. She hadn't even flinched during the earlier danger—she wasn't about to retreat now.

With that in mind, he nodded and left, discreetly arranging additional security around her.

Jonathan had been given only four hours and didn’t dare waste a second. He gathered his team and the third-party auditors, heading straight to the relevant departments to comb through the accounts.

When the discrepancies surfaced, the numbers were staggering.

Without delay, Jonathan called Evelyn to report.

She was on the balcony, sipping lemonade between yoga poses. As she answered, her gaze flicked downstairs—Nathan was already here. Her brow furrowed.

"Ms. Sinclair," Jonathan said over the phone, "the total losses on this project exceed 8.7 billion. Most of it was funneled to Lawrence Sinclair and his associates. The construction company they hired is owned by Lawrence’s brother-in-law."

He paused. "There were several fatal accidents on-site, but they paid out less than a million in compensation. I think this was never about selling the project—just extortion."

Selling would’ve been a one-time payout. Keeping it meant continuous exploitation.

Evelyn had suspected as much. That was why she hadn’t just thrown money at Leonard Whitmore.

This project was a black hole. If they were willing to sacrifice lives for profit, no amount of money would stop them.

She wanted this resolved cleanly—which meant ripping out the corruption by the roots.

After a brief silence, she spoke. "Send the audit findings to Mr. Whitmore. Let him deal with it. And get me a copy."

That meant no digital transmission.

Jonathan caught on immediately. "Understood. I’ll have a courier deliver the flash drive within the hour."

Evelyn hung up, finishing her yoga routine before packing up her mat.

The doorbell rang.

Nathan had arrived.

She opened the door, unsurprised—but the sight of what he carried made her freeze.

Nathan stood there, arms laden with two massive grocery bags, clearly fresh from the supermarket.

He strode past her into the apartment with effortless ease. Evelyn crossed her arms, eyebrows arched.

"Mr. Blackwood, that’s enough food to feed an army. Do you even know how to cook any of it?"

Nathan’s smile was infuriatingly confident. He rolled up his sleeves as he headed for the kitchen. "I bought a cookbook."

Evelyn nearly groaned. Fine. He did save my life earlier. If it’s terrible, I’ll just pretend to eat.

The usual cold edge in Nathan’s demeanor had softened, making him almost… pleasant.

Almost.

Then she watched him unpack measuring cups, a digital scale, and a thick cookbook.

Her eyes widened as he pulled out a ruler to measure the thickness of carrot slices.

Oh god. He’s turning into Donovan.

She couldn’t take it. Snatching up her phone, she retreated to the bedroom.

Since when did Nathan and my brother share this… precision obsession? Is this a STEM thing? What even is my life right now?

She settled at her laptop, answering emails. Less than ten minutes later—

BANG.

Evelyn bolted upright. Smoke billowed from the kitchen.

Nathan emerged, face smudged with soot, expression thunderous.

She stared.

"Nathan Blackwood. Did you just blow up my kitchen?"
###Chapter 720

The instant Nathan stepped into the kitchen, Evelyn braced herself for disaster.

She'd expected burnt food at worst.

But reality proved far more explosive. Nathan didn't just fail at cooking—he detonated the entire kitchen.

Thick plumes of smoke billowed out, triggering the fire alarm.

Even covered in soot, Nathan retained his aristocratic composure. Only the tightness in his jaw betrayed his fury.

His pride had taken a direct hit.

Pressing his tongue against the roof of his mouth, he muttered through gritted teeth, "Faulty equipment."

Then he hauled Evelyn out before the sprinklers drenched them.

Though no flames erupted, the oven's malfunction had short-circuited the entire system. Water cascaded from the ceiling, flooding the floor.

Chaos erupted. The hotel manager scrambled to relocate guests and assess damages while Nathan—oblivious—scrolled through cooking tutorials on his phone.

Evelyn's lips twitched. Unbelievable.

"Ms. Sterling," the manager approached nervously, "would you inspect the damage?"

Her stomach dropped. This bastard just cost me a fortune.

The floor was unsalvageable. Walls, carpets, furniture—all needed replacement. The renovation would halt operations for weeks.

"Mr. Blackwood—" the manager hesitated, "—will he cover the losses?"

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Sterling Enterprises will handle it. Contact Bennett for details."

As the manager retreated, Evelyn froze.

Alexandra Montgomery stood beside Nathan, simpering as she handed him a flash drive.

Nathan accepted it indifferently, not even glancing at her.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She dialed Jonathan Reeves.

"Who delivered the drive?"

"Alexandra," Jonathan answered, confused. "The team was auditing accounts, so she—"

"You entrusted her with confidential data?" Evelyn's voice sharpened.

"She's your assistant! I thought—"

"Thought wrong." Her knuckles whitened around the phone. "She gave it to Nathan Blackwood. If this leaks, pack your desk with hers."

She hung up and stormed forward. Nathan frowned at the drive, turning it over like a foreign object.

He doesn't even know what he's holding.

But Alexandra did.

And that terrified Evelyn more than any kitchen explosion.
###Chapter 721

Nathan was reaching for his laptop to plug in the flash drive when Evelyn's fingers closed around it first. "Mr. Blackwood, that belongs to me."

His eyebrows shot up. "I was wondering why your assistant handed this to me."

Evelyn's lips curved without offering an explanation.

Of course Alexandra would try to give Nathan anything he wanted.

"She's clearly mistaken. This won't occur again."

Before Nathan could analyze the edge in Evelyn's voice, she already had her phone out.

She dialed Bennett directly.

"Terminate Alexandra Montgomery immediately. Effective now."

Bennett didn't hesitate or ask questions. He moved with military precision.

He'd always suspected Alexandra wouldn't last long at Sterling Enterprises.

Alexandra had just stepped out of the hotel lobby when the termination notice hit her phone. No return to office required. Her access revoked completely.

Panic set in immediately.

When she called HR for clarification, no one would take her calls.

Her habit of flaunting her connection to Evelyn had burned every bridge in the company.

While the office celebrated her departure, Alexandra desperately called Jonathan.

Jonathan had already received Evelyn's warning. Hearing about the firing, relief flooded through him.

At least he wasn't collateral damage.

"Mr. Reeves, there must be some mistake! Can you check with corporate? I didn't do anything—"

Jonathan cut her off without his usual diplomacy. "Who exactly did you hand that flash drive to?"

Alexandra froze. "I—"

"Nathan Blackwood is our direct competitor on this bid. You handed him confidential documents. That's corporate espionage, Alexandra."

Her face drained of color. "Mr. Reeves, I saw him there when Ms. Sinclair wasn't, so I asked him to pass it along—"

"Stop embarrassing yourself. I've been around long enough to recognize social climbing when I see it. The termination stands. If you disagree, take it to legal."

He hung up, cursing the day Alexandra joined his team.

Alexandra's hands shook. She suddenly understood—Evelyn must have witnessed the entire exchange.

No other explanation for the lightning-fast termination.

Guilt turned to dread. She wouldn't dare fight this. Against the Sterlings? She stood no chance.

Defeated, Alexandra headed back to clear her desk.

Evelyn finished handling the situation and turned to Nathan. "Let's go."

He stood. "Where?"

"I made reservations." Nathan exhaled sharply.

Evelyn walked ahead. Nathan caught up, his voice low. "That was an accident. Harrison will cover all damages."

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Already handled."

"Next time, I'll cook you something edible."

Today's disaster had taught Nathan one thing—cooking was harder than running a Fortune 500 company.

But he never backed down from a challenge. He'd master this too.

Evelyn's polite smile looked painful.

"Mr. Blackwood, your intentions are... appreciated."

'Please stay out of kitchens forever.'

Bennett had booked their usual private dining room at Le Ciel. Entire staff cleared out per standard protocol.

Evelyn refused to be photographed dining with Nathan.

She ordered her usual salad, then slid the menu toward him.

Nathan didn't glance at it. "Same."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. She'd only ordered a fruit plate...
###Chapter 722

Nathan Blackwood lounged casually in his seat, his posture relaxed yet commanding. "What's your next move? When are you heading back?"

Evelyn Sinclair gave him a knowing smile. "Soon. If everything goes according to plan, I can leave tomorrow morning."

If all went well, Victor Langley and Lawrence Sinclair would be in custody by then. She could return to her office and have Jonathan Reeves handle the acquisition details.

Nathan thought he'd managed to talk some sense into her. His expression softened.

"Don't be too hard on yourself. For a first attempt, you've done remarkably well."

Now it was his turn to deal with Leonard Whitmore.

Nathan had no intention of negotiating directly with Lawrence Sinclair.

To test Lawrence's limits, they needed pressure - and that pressure had to come from Leonard Whitmore.

The only way to outmaneuver a snake was to become an even bigger serpent.

Nathan wasn't about to pay Lawrence a lump sum. He'd already set everything in motion to completely flip the situation.

Just then, Nathan's phone rang.

Leonard Whitmore was calling.

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, who appeared indifferent.

So he answered the call right in front of her.

As Leonard spoke, Nathan's eyes widened momentarily before his gaze darkened, locking onto Evelyn with new intensity.

After a few polite exchanges, Nathan ended the call with a carefully neutral expression.

Evelyn could read Nathan's reaction perfectly.

She'd won this round.

Three seconds of silence stretched between them.

Then Nathan suddenly chuckled, his eyes narrowing. "Evelyn, you never cease to amaze me."

That she could outmaneuver him when he wasn't paying full attention was impressive enough.

Evelyn smiled serenely. "Are you sure 'amaze' is the right word? Not 'shock'?"

Nathan's reaction was unexpected - neither furious nor falsely magnanimous. Just... thoughtful.

"Do you know what Leonard just told me?" he asked after a moment.

"I can guess," Evelyn replied frankly.

She'd played her hand perfectly. The project would have to go to Sterling Enterprises now.

Any other outcome would imply backroom dealings between Nathan and Leonard.

Against a lesser opponent, Leonard might have risked helping Nathan.

But Sterling Enterprises' influence matched Blackwood Industries'. Any hint of unfair play would jeopardize Leonard's career.

He had no choice but to remain impartial.

Nathan rubbed his temple, then laughed outright, his admiration undisguised.

"Victor Langley's been arrested. They're on their way to pick up Lawrence Sinclair now. Zenith Corp is about to undergo a complete power shift." His voice held reluctant awe. "In less than a day, you've turned Sandford upside down."

He'd underestimated Evelyn. Badly.

While Nathan spent four hours preparing dinner, Evelyn had orchestrated this entire operation.

He'd expected her to rest after the earlier events - to be shaken, exhausted.

Instead, she'd moved with unbelievable speed and precision. Her calm execution was unmatched.

This was the woman he loved - brilliant, bold, fearless.

He'd lost. And he couldn't even resent it.

Evelyn lowered her eyes with a faint smile. "I know. Thanks for conceding."

Nathan's grin turned wry.

"Evelyn, if you ever want to join Blackwood Industries, I'll give you the best package imaginable."

What an incredible opponent.

She raised an eyebrow. "Same goes if you want to switch to Sterling Enterprises."

A pang of regret shot through Nathan. She'd been his once - his hidden treasure he'd foolishly discarded like worthless scrap.

Now, with Sterling Enterprises behind her, she'd never need to rely on him again.

"Excuse me, your meal is served. Please enjoy."

The waiter wheeled over a cart, placing two fruit salads on the table before discreetly withdrawing.

These two had paid a fortune to reserve the entire venue... only to order fruit salads.

Rich people really did operate on whims.

Nathan stared at his salad, momentarily speechless.

He hadn't heard Evelyn's order earlier, simply requesting whatever she was having.

This was not what he'd expected.
###Chapter 723

Evelyn Sinclair finished her meal with satisfaction. Seeing Nathan Blackwood's loss of appetite only brightened her mood further.

She had squeezed several million in compensation from him. This victory meal tasted particularly sweet.

Pure exhilaration coursed through Evelyn's veins.

Back at The Grandeur, Evelyn began packing her designer suitcases.

She briefed Jonathan Reeves on remaining matters before boarding her private jet home the next morning.

Everything proceeded smoothly with Jonathan's assistance - no doubt thanks to Leonard Whitmore's discreet intervention. With Lawrence Sinclair arrested, Zenith Corp's affairs officially transferred to the investigation team. The moment the accounts were unfrozen, acquisition talks began.

Lawrence Sinclair cracked within days of interrogation. The mountain of evidence left him no choice but full confession.

Evelyn deliberately took two days off, leaving Sterling Enterprises entirely in Alexander Sterling's capable hands.

She scheduled a spa day with Isabella Montgomery. After shopping along Fifth Avenue, they settled at an exclusive lounge.

Isabella gasped at Evelyn's Sandford adventures.

When hearing how Evelyn outmaneuvered Nathan, Isabella's admiration skyrocketed.

"If this gets out, Nathan will become corporate America's laughingstock!"

Evelyn shot her a warning look. "Don't even think about spreading this. The delicate balance between Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Industries must remain. Any cracks will invite vultures."

She refused to waste energy maintaining their precarious business relationship.

This current distance - not too close, not too far - was perfect.

"Did he take the loss gracefully?" Isabella probed.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Graceful or not, facts remain. With Nathan's reputation and ambition, one lost project won't rattle him."

At most, he'd skip a few meals.

Isabella snorted. "He's probably sulking. Never thought I'd see the day Nathan Blackwood loses. Against anyone else, the outcome might differ."

The comment struck Evelyn.

Her mere presence distracted Nathan. Concern for her safety had divided his attention from the project.

Against another opponent, the results could have reversed.

What a pity.

Isabella concluded, "Probably too busy drowning in your beauty to focus."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Carelessness carries consequences. Consider this his wake-up call for future defeats."

Isabella gave an impressed thumbs-up. Only Evelyn could deliver such infuriating truths with elegance.

Suddenly, Isabella frowned. "Why do I keep running into your brother Lucas when visiting Natalie? Did he quit acting?"

Evelyn arched a brow. Apparently, Isabella was denser than she'd realized about Lucas and Natalie's situation.

"How's filming more important than dating?" When realization struck, Isabella nearly toppled her champagne. "Oh. My. God!"

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips. "Must you broadcast it to Manhattan?"

"Can you blame me?" Isabella whispered dramatically. "Lucas Sterling and Natalie Beaumont? That Greek god actually dates mere mortals?"

Evelyn sighed. "More like persistent pursuit. Doubt he's succeeded yet."

Isabella shook her head. "Now his death glares make sense! When I invited them to the opera, Lucas only bought two tickets. That was my cue to disappear, wasn't it?"

Evelyn chuckled. Poor Lucas must have been seething at Isabella's oblivious third-wheeling.

Before she could respond, Evelyn's phone buzzed. William Sterling's name flashed.

He wanted her home immediately - Preston Sinclair had arrived to collect Oliver.
###Chapter 724

Evelyn's brows knitted together as she reluctantly agreed to return home.

After bidding farewell to Isabella, she headed straight for Sterling Manor.

Preston was in the parlor with Lucas and William. William had always admired Preston's composed demeanor - that rare combination of humility and quiet confidence that made him seem utterly dependable.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, little Oliver came dragging his miniature suitcase down the stairs, his eyes rimmed red with unshed tears.

"Pretty Lady..." Oliver rushed forward and threw his arms around Evelyn's waist, his small frame trembling with emotion.

Evelyn hugged him back tightly, an unexpected pang of sorrow gripping her heart.

Oliver had lived at Sterling Manor long enough to become family. Yet everyone understood Preston's bond with the boy ran far deeper.

Preston rose gracefully, offering Evelyn a warm smile.

"The academic calendar abroad couldn't be postponed further. Oliver's missed too many classes already with our extended stay. The new term starts soon."

William sighed heavily nearby, his reluctance palpable.

"Plenty of excellent schools here. Must he study overseas?"

Preston explained patiently, "His curriculum was specially designed by top educators abroad. That level of customization isn't available here, and Oliver's already adapted to their accelerated pace. Switching systems now would set him back tremendously."

Every aspect of Oliver's education had been meticulously planned by world-renowned specialists. Preston had secured tutors no ordinary school could hope to match.

William gazed at Oliver mournfully. The boy obediently went to him, wrapping small arms around his neck.

"Uncle William, I'll visit often! I'll finish all my lessons quickly, inherit Daddy's entire fortune, then return in grand style to stay with you forever! No one will separate us again!"

Preston inhaled sharply. Such ambitious words might as well have been wishing for his early demise!

Amused, William comforted the boy before escorting them to the entrance.

Preston lingered by the car, his gaze lingering on Evelyn as if wanting to say more, but the presence of others held him back.

Finally, he simply lowered his lashes and smiled. "Goodbye, Evelyn."

She nodded, then suddenly remembered. "Wait!"

Rushing upstairs, she returned with a bank card, discreetly pressing it into Preston's hand when Oliver wasn't looking.

"What's this?"

Evelyn grinned. "Oliver's back-to-school gift. Don't refuse - it's tradition here to give an allowance for new terms!"

Preston looked baffled. "He's supposed to take a bank card to school?"

He suspected Evelyn's idea of an allowance differed greatly from most.

Tilting her head playfully, Evelyn said, "We Montecitans are generous people. Let Oliver's international friends witness our hospitality."

William nodded approvingly. "Just take it. It's nothing significant anyway."

Reluctantly, Preston accepted on Oliver's behalf.

He couldn't help feeling Oliver had gained far more than mere affection during his stay with the Sterlings.

After farewells, Preston had his assistant check the account balance from the car.

$900 million!

Instantly, he recalled that $880 million black pearl necklace.

Evelyn had even included an extra $20 million as thanks.

Preston didn't know whether to laugh or sigh. His eyes darkened with unreadable emotion.

Evelyn truly refused to owe anyone anything.

But there would be other opportunities. The game was far from over.

Oliver remained despondent, mourning the impending separation from his beloved Pretty Lady.

"Daddy, what did Pretty Lady give you?"

Preston arched a brow, pocketing the card. "She bought you study materials and asked me to deliver them."

"Oh...but I don't want them..."

At that moment, Oliver's melancholy threatened to consume him entirely.
###Chapter 725

Evelyn turned just in time to see Lucas humming as he strolled toward the kitchen.

That was odd.

Normally, Lucas wouldn't set foot in there unless William forced him.

What had gotten into him today?

William sat brooding in the living room, absorbed in his latest historical drama binge.

Evelyn was about to join him when footsteps descended the stairs.

Donovan came down sighing heavily.

"Donovan's home already?"

"Where's Emily? Didn't she come back with you?"

Donovan's expression darkened at the sore subject.

William barely glanced up, clearly not in the mood to engage.

The scientist rubbed his neck, aristocratic features flushing slightly. "I'm returning to the lab tomorrow. Emily's staying with her family a while longer."

Evelyn nodded as Donovan disappeared into the kitchen.

Lucas bounded over cheerfully. "Evie! I made matcha latte! Try some—"

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

'He's offering me liquid calories at this hour? Does he want me to gain ten pounds?'

Before she could respond, Donovan's clinical voice floated out.

"This beverage contains trans fats that elevate LDL cholesterol and increase cardiovascular risks. Long-term consumption may even contribute to carcinogenic—"

'Appetite officially ruined.'

Evelyn pivoted silently away.

Lucas gaped for three full seconds before groaning. "Donovan, you're a walking contraceptive ad!"

The scientist emerged looking even more morose.

Meanwhile, Lucas cheerfully presented his creation to William. "Dad! Made this just for you!"

William sipped without looking up. "Not sweet enough."

Lucas grinned. "Natalie prefers less sugar, so you'll have to suffer."

William's eye twitched. 'This brat's begging for another spanking.'

Within the week, Jonathan delivered excellent news. Lawrence Sinclair, Victor Langley, and other Zenith Corp executives were convicted of embezzlement and accounting fraud—sentenced to three years.

Next came Sterling Enterprises' restructuring of Zenith Corp.

Since Zenith's employees had united against Sterling initially, Evelyn felt little sympathy.

They'd received generous severance yet still tried following Lawrence's corrupt example.

Only ten remained under contract—all junior staff who'd receive substantial payouts if they left.

Which they did.

With the matter settled, Evelyn finally exhaled.

She'd oversee the project launch personally—the rest was straightforward.

Sterling Tower.

Evelyn reviewed Jonathan's report while sipping espresso.

Her phone buzzed—Isabella.

"Check Nathan's latest post! Priceless!"

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

That bastard Nathan Blackwood was undoubtedly stirring trouble again.

She tapped her social media feed—there it was.

"Blessed to create sweet moments for you."

The photo showed an elaborate dessert spread—peach galettes, strawberry mille-feuille, chocolate soufflés, blueberry clafoutis—arranged in a perfect heart.

This time, he'd omitted her name.

But the heart-shaped display spoke volumes.
###Chapter 726

Nathan was determined to make sure everyone knew those desserts were meant for Evelyn.

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. This man has completely lost his mind! Can't he just focus on running his damn company? Why is he so obsessed with playing chef?

And why does he keep dragging me into his ridiculous antics? Unbelievable!

The comments under Nathan's post were overflowing with praise.

[Mr. Blackwood, those pastries look absolutely divine!]

[What an incredible talent! How lucky one must be to taste your creations!]

[True love shows through effort!]

Evelyn scoffed. Oh please. I'd like to see their faces if they actually had to eat his "creations."

After several minutes, Tristan finally voiced the question everyone was thinking.

[Seriously though...did you actually bake these yourself?]

At least someone still had standards.

Nathan's reply came swiftly.

[No. But I did taste them personally.]

The blunt response silenced the crowd instantly.

That evening as Evelyn left the office, the receptionist called out to her.

"Ms. Sinclair, you have a delivery."

Evelyn frowned. She hadn't ordered anything. Bennett usually handled all her packages.

The elegant pastry box made her blood run cold.

That insufferable Nathan Blackwood just won't quit!

She forced a smile and pushed the box toward the receptionist. "You must be hungry. Enjoy these."

The receptionist nearly fainted from excitement. The CEO is giving me Mr. Blackwood's personal gift? She's so generous!

"Thank you, Ms. Sinclair!"

After Evelyn left, the receptionist discovered the handwritten note inside.

[I've restrained countless words, but couldn't restrain missing you. - Nathan Blackwood]

Her hands trembled. Holy shit! Mr. Ice-Cold Billionaire actually wrote this? Since when does he do romance?

Evelyn's phone rang as her car pulled into traffic.

She answered without checking. "Yes?"

"Evelyn, how were the desserts?" Damn him and that velvet voice.

Her grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Nathan, don't you have better hobbies?"

For God's sake, leave the cooking to professionals. And leave me alone!

His low chuckle vibrated through the phone. "I'm learning. Theodore's an excellent teacher."

The man's obsession with culinary arts was bordering on pathological. A CEO moonlighting as a pastry chef? Ridiculous.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Well...best of luck with that."

A pause. Then Nathan's voice turned serious. "I've been doing all the things you used to do for me. To understand what you went through. Evelyn...I'm truly sorry."

The line went dead.

Some wounds were still too fresh.

Nathan stared at the darkened screen, feeling every ounce of her pain. Her avoidance spoke volumes.

Each memory was another knife twisting in his gut.

Karma was brutal.

Theodore emerged from the kitchen, exhausted from salvaging what remained of the professional-grade appliances.

In just one week, Nathan had destroyed:

Three sets of handcrafted porcelain
Two commercial mixers
One industrial oven
The man was a walking kitchen hazard. A menace to culinary arts everywhere.
###Chapter 727

Theodore coughed lightly. "Mr. Blackwood, everything has been taken care of. Should we—"

Nathan gave a dismissive nod. "Get someone to remove that broken microwave. Never purchase from that brand again. Absolute trash quality!"

Theodore's lips twitched as he thought, 'You're the one who keeps overheating everything like a caveman!'

"Right away, sir."

Though he disagreed internally, Theodore immediately complied. The boss's word was law in Blackwood Industries.

"Harrison mentioned something before leaving," Theodore continued carefully. "There's a woman who claims to know you wanting a position at the company, but you were occupied all day—"

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "What woman? I don't recall anyone."

Message received. Theodore would relay Nathan's exact response to Harrison.

Two days later.

Phantom Lounge.

Early spring chill still lingered in the air, sending most partygoers bundled in coats.

Not Evelyn Sinclair. Beauty over comfort was her motto.

The elite social event had drawn both Evelyn and Nathan among its distinguished guests.

Evelyn stepped out of her car in a daring crimson mermaid gown with dramatic puff sleeves. The silhouette hugged every curve while the bold design screamed confidence. A perfect blend of sophistication and edge.

Spotting Natalie Beaumont arriving simultaneously, Evelyn strode forward.

Natalie immediately linked arms with her. "God, it's been ages! I nearly stormed your penthouse yesterday!"

Evelyn smirked. "Missed me or my brother?"

Natalie pinched her arm in mock warning. "Don't start!"

Evelyn's grin widened. The lack of genuine protest meant Lucas still had a shot.

"I'm serious! Can't wait to officially call you sister."

Natalie's laughter abruptly died. A shadow crossed her features.

Evelyn studied her friend. "Heard Adrian's been harassing you?"

Between them, no topic was off-limits.

The elevator doors closed as Natalie scoffed. "Pathetic, really. Had he played his cards right, he could've maintained a decent career in smaller circles. But no—the idiot got high at Milan Fashion Week. Got blacklisted internationally. Now he's crawling back, begging for forgiveness."

Evelyn shook her head. One stupid mistake had sealed Adrian's fate.

"Don't you dare reconsider," Evelyn warned. "That trainwreck will drag you down."

Natalie rolled her eyes. "Please. His rivals are already tearing him apart. Why would I waste resources on damaged goods?"

The cold calculation in Natalie's voice reassured Evelyn.

No wonder Lucas had been "coincidentally" showing up at Natalie's office lately. The overprotective idiot probably feared a reconciliation.

Evelyn nudged her friend. "Speaking of brothers... what do you really think of Lucas?"
###Chapter 728

Natalie paused mid-sentence and cut Evelyn off.

"Eve, I won't lie to you. I still have feelings for Lucas, but..." She hesitated, her voice dropping to a whisper. "It's like standing on the edge of a storm, waiting for lightning to strike. The uncertainty terrifies me. I can't survive another heartbreak, so I'd rather not risk it."

This wasn't like her past with Adrian.

With Adrian, Natalie had always been guarded, knowing their relationship was temporary. But with Lucas? Her heart had actually dared to hope.

Evelyn stayed silent for a long moment before finally nodding with a small, understanding smile.

She got it. For Natalie, a life partner wasn't just a lover—it was family. The only family she'd ever truly have.

But who could guarantee that a man like Lucas, charming and reckless, would stay devoted forever?

People who had been abandoned before didn't trust easily. Natalie refused to set herself up for another fall.

Evelyn exhaled sharply just as the elevator doors slid open.

They stepped out.

"Whatever you decide, I'm with you, Nat. Just follow your gut."

No one else's opinions mattered.

Natalie nodded, and the two women exchanged a knowing smile.

Then, Natalie's expression froze. "Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan stood there, tall and impossible to miss, his presence icy and commanding.

Evelyn turned.

Nathan was already looking at her, lips curved in a smile as he approached. "What a pleasant surprise."

Surprise? Please.

Their social circles overlapped. Running into each other was inevitable. Avoiding him would only make things more awkward.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Quite the coincidence."

Nathan's gaze darkened with something unreadable. "I prefer to call it fate."

Her smile stiffened.

Natalie choked back a laugh. This man is delusional.

Evelyn grabbed Natalie's arm and steered her around Nathan. "Let's go greet the others."

Nathan's eyes flickered with disappointment before hardening into their usual cold indifference as others approached to exchange pleasantries.

The shift was instant.

Tristan noticed the crowd and sauntered over.

"Blackwood, don't look so defeated. I've got your back."

He winked. Only after losing Vivian did he truly understand regret.

His ex-wife had built a name for herself, becoming the poster child for independent, divorced women.

Vivian was thriving. Meanwhile, he was... well.

Tristan turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair, long time no see."

The crowd parted for him instinctively.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Mr. Whitmore. Need something?"

"We're friends—acquaintances, at least. Can't I just say hello?"

His shameless, overly familiar attitude hadn't changed a bit.

Evelyn smirked.

"Of course. I still have those photos of you on my phone. They're quite entertaining to revisit."

Tristan's face drained of color. The smugness in his eyes evaporated instantly. Shit. I'm screwed.

"Ms. Sinclair, you're joking..."

He hunched his shoulders, hesitated, then swallowed his pride.

"Look, could you put in a good word for me with Vivian? I swear, I've changed."

Evelyn sipped her wine, elegant and unreadable. "Do you really think that's possible?"

Tristan's shoulders slumped. He already knew the answer.

Evelyn chuckled. At least he's self-aware.
###Chapter 729

Tristan Whitmore walked away with slumped shoulders.

Nathan Blackwood shook his head as he watched. Tristan had approached Evelyn Sinclair with such confidence, only to return completely deflated. Evelyn truly was remarkable.

She could even handle someone as shameless as Tristan Whitmore.

Nearby guests noticed Nathan's changed demeanor and approached with polite greetings.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

Nathan raised his glass in acknowledgment. Before he could lower it, someone crashed into him.

Red wine splashed across his tailored suit.

Disgust flashed in Nathan's eyes as the woman who bumped into him tried to throw herself into his arms.

Instantly, his expression darkened. He stepped back sharply, letting her fall.

He wouldn't allow this woman to touch him.

Maintaining his integrity in front of Evelyn was non-negotiable.

"Ah—"

A loud thud followed the woman's dramatic scream.

Alexandra Montgomery had calculated the perfect angle to land gracefully in Nathan's arms without embarrassing herself before the crowd.

But she hadn't anticipated how quickly he'd move away.

Now sprawled on the floor, Alexandra winced in genuine pain as people gathered around.

"Isn't she one of the waitstaff? Look at her uniform."

"How clumsy! She nearly knocked over Mr. Blackwood!"

"Where's the manager? This is unacceptable!"

Alexandra had waited all day at Blackwood Industries, only to be told Nathan didn't know her and refused to meet.

After leaving Sterling Enterprises, she'd had nowhere to go. An accomplished graduate like her couldn't settle for some mediocre company.

So she'd set her sights on Nathan.

They'd met before—how could he claim not to know her?

Learning Nathan would attend this gala, she'd sneaked in as staff, determined to get his attention.

She never expected him to let her fall so unceremoniously.

Not even offering a hand.

Other waiters rushed to help Alexandra up while the manager apologized profusely.

"My sincerest apologies, Mr. Blackwood! This new hire is terribly clumsy. We'll handle this immediately."

Nathan's icy gaze burned with displeasure at his ruined attire—his greatest pet peeve.

Playing the victim, Alexandra looked up at Nathan with teary eyes. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Blackwood. It was truly an accident."

Her expression silently accused him of deliberately avoiding her.

Nathan's glare could freeze lava. He set his glass down without glancing at her and turned to leave.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Alexandra called desperately. "Don't you remember me?"

Nathan paused mid-step. He turned slowly.

That face meant nothing to him.

Had they met?

Alexandra's heart sank at his blank stare, but she pressed on. "I opened the door for you at Sterling Manor on New Year's Eve. Two days ago, I delivered a flash drive to you—"

Nathan's lips thinned. 'That was the same person?'

"You're... Evelyn's cousin?"

"Yes! You do remember!" Alexandra beamed triumphantly.
###Chapter 730

The supervisor's heart skipped a beat when he heard it.

His expression darkened instantly.

Evelyn Sinclair was attending this event. How could he have asked her cousin to work as a waitress?

Was this some kind of rich girl slumming it for fun?

Nathan Blackwood stood nearby, his face unreadable as he studied the supervisor beside Alexandra.

Nathan removed his ruined jacket, his voice sharp and final. "Make her pay for it."

No arguments. No negotiations.

Originally, he hadn’t planned to escalate things, but since Alexandra was Evelyn’s cousin, he knew Evelyn would get involved.

And that meant he’d get a chance to speak with her alone.

A smirk tugged at his lips. Perfect.

The supervisor gaped at him but didn’t dare question the order. He swallowed hard before nodding.

The Italian designer jacket Nathan wore was a limited-edition piece worth a fortune.

If Alexandra wasn’t from money, she’d never be able to cover the cost.

Alexandra froze, her face draining of color. She hadn’t even gotten the job yet, and now she was drowning in debt.

How was she supposed to pay for this?

"Mr. Blackwood—please—"

Her pleading fell on deaf ears. Nathan’s expression remained cold, unmoved.

Her little stunt earlier had been obvious. Anyone with half a brain could see she’d done it on purpose.

She’d hoped for a romantic moment. Instead, she got a bill.

Panic clawed at her throat.

The crowd watched in stunned silence. Nathan was known for his generosity—why was he suddenly so fixated on this?

Then it clicked.

This woman was Evelyn’s cousin.

Of course.

Nathan just wanted an excuse to see his ex-wife.

Clever.

"Alexandra," someone said, "since Mr. Blackwood insists, you can afford it, right?"

Being Evelyn’s relative, a designer jacket shouldn’t be a problem.

Alexandra’s hands trembled, her palms slick with sweat.

Her gaze darted around frantically, her eyes red-rimmed.

Evelyn and Natalie watched from the balcony, thoroughly amused.

Alexandra couldn’t afford this. Yet she’d had the audacity to spill wine on Nathan.

When Alexandra spotted Evelyn, her face lit up with desperate hope. "Cousin!"

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

Just as Nathan had planned.

Evelyn checked her phone and glanced at Natalie. "This place is exhausting. Let’s go somewhere else?"

Natalie smirked. "Absolutely."

The two women strode out, the crowd parting for them. As they passed Alexandra and the supervisor, Alexandra stood there, trembling.

"COUSIN!"

"Ms. Sinclair, please—"

Evelyn paused, letting out an icy laugh. "I don’t know this woman. Do I need to explain my relationship with every stranger who claims to be family?"

Then she walked away without another word.

Screw distant relatives. What a nuisance.

The supervisor’s face paled. Evelyn was clearly displeased. Losing two VIP guests was a disaster.

He signaled security. "Get her out of here. And make sure she pays."

This club didn’t let anyone leave without settling their debts.

Alexandra had no money—but she was also terrified of the cold-eyed men surrounding her.

She had no choice but to call every relative and friend she knew, begging for loans.

Nathan waited downstairs, freshly changed into clean clothes, his mood significantly improved.

He expected Evelyn to come plead for Alexandra’s sake.

If she did, he’d be lenient.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn and Natalie emerged, laughing.

She wasn’t here for him.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Shadows darkened his sharp features as he stepped out of his car.

"Evelyn," he called. "I’m here."
###Chapter 731

Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont stood frozen in shock.

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she turned to the man blocking their path. "Mr. Blackwood, I thought you'd left already?"

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

"I was waiting for you."

Her confusion deepened. The biting winter air made her eager to leave, not stand around exchanging pointless words. "Why?"

His gaze was sharp, his voice clipped. "Your cousin ruined my jacket—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn let out a sharp, humorless laugh.

"She's not my cousin. If you want to track her down, do it yourself. Don't drag me into it. I'm not footing the bill for anyone else's mess." Her tone was ice-cold. "And if anyone tries to scam you using my name again, call the police. Thanks."

She didn’t bother hiding her disgust.

Alexandra Montgomery was a stain she wanted nothing to do with.

Nathan hadn’t expected this reaction. If he hadn’t seen Alexandra at Sterling Manor himself, he wouldn’t have believed they were even related.

Evelyn didn’t wait for a response. She brushed past him and slid into the car.

Natalie shot Nathan a knowing look before following.

Once inside, she smirked. "Mr. Blackwood looked devastated."

Evelyn scoffed. "He’s just upset no one’s paying for that ridiculously overpriced jacket."

She’d rather burn money than waste it on Alexandra’s nonsense.

Their destination was Velvet Lounge, their usual haunt.

The moment they stepped inside, the owner greeted them warmly. "Ladies! You’re here to meet Mr. Hart, right? He’s in your usual spot."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Natalie.

Sebastian Hart was already here?

That private room was theirs—reserved no matter how packed the place got.

But as they approached, the sound of muffled sobs stopped them in their tracks.

Evelyn frowned. "What’s wrong with him now?"

Two days ago, he’d been raving about his trip to see the Northern Lights.

Natalie shrugged, just as clueless.

Hesitant, Evelyn knocked. No answer.

She pushed the door open—

A bottle came flying straight at her head.

"Who said you could come in?! Get out!"

She barely dodged in time. Glass shattered against the doorframe, raining shards onto the floor.

Natalie’s voice cut through the tension. "Open your damn eyes before you kill someone!"

The crying stopped abruptly.

Sebastian blinked up at them, his usually striking eyes red and puffy.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Even Oscar winners can’t cry like that. What’s your tragic backstory this time?"

He wiped his face hastily. "I wasn’t crying—"

Natalie held up her phone. "I have video proof."

Sebastian glared. "You’re evil."

Evelyn sighed. "So? Did your charity project collapse? Or did your organic kale stop selling?"

She still remembered his grand philanthropic announcement last month.

His lips pressed into a thin line. "It’s nothing."

Evelyn straightened. "Fine. Keep your secrets. We’ll leave you to your dramatic breakdown."

She turned to go.

Sebastian’s jaw dropped. She’s really walking away?!

As she and Natalie reached for the door, his voice cracked.

"Wait! My family’s forcing me into an arranged marriage—"
###Chapter 732

Evelyn and Natalie froze mid-step, exchanging incredulous glances at Sebastian.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before speaking. "I thought your family was always progressive about these matters?"

The Hart family was notorious for spoiling their heirs rotten.

She knew this firsthand. After Julian's tragic accident, their indulgence toward Sebastian had reached new heights. The man could snap his fingers and get whatever he wanted. Even when he crossed lines, the worst he'd get was a mild scolding.

Sebastian's eyes welled up dramatically. "That was before! Everything changed when Grandfather's health declined. Pacific Crest Enterprises became a battlefield overnight. One particular shareholder is blackmailing me to marry his daughter—threatening to oust my entire family from the board."

Evelyn's breath hitched. While unfamiliar with Pacific Crest's internal politics, she couldn't fathom how the Harts had let a shareholder gain such control.

"How did things escalate so quickly?"

Sebastian's voice cracked. "I never paid attention to corporate affairs. These shareholders were Grandfather's most trusted advisors—until they stabbed us in the back. I haven't even told him... The shock might—" His sentence trailed off ominously.

Evelyn and Natalie shared a loaded look before turning sympathetic eyes toward their distressed friend.

Sebastian Hart—the carefree playboy—had finally encountered a problem money couldn't solve.

The trio sat in tense silence, brainstorming solutions. At some point, Sebastian began sniffling again.

Natalie shot him a disgusted look.

Evelyn bit her lip. "Is she... at least attractive?"

'If she's passable, maybe Sebastian could fake compliance and scheme later...' Evelyn reasoned.

Sebastian's sobs intensified. "She's eleven years my senior. Twice divorced."

Dead silence.

Poor bastard.

This clearly wasn't happening without a fight.

Natalie suddenly snapped her fingers. "Actually, there might be a way to flip the board—literally."

Two pairs of eyes locked onto her.

A sly smile curved Natalie's lips. "Find a stronger alliance. Gather kompromat on those vultures. Crush them methodically while preparing countermeasures."

More silence.

Where would Sebastian find such a powerful marriage prospect?

Natalie nudged Evelyn, who pointed at herself. "Me?"

'Sacrificial lamb time?' Evelyn thought wryly. Natalie nodded emphatically.

"Not an actual marriage. Just enough to make them hesitate. Sterling Enterprises' clout would give them pause."

Evelyn tapped her chin. "Honestly, if corporate management isn't your forte, why not hire professional executives? Maintain control while delegating the headaches. But first—" She sighed. "If you need my help with this charade, I'm in."

It was just theater anyway. Evelyn wouldn't lose sleep over pretending if it saved Sebastian from ruin. She couldn't abandon him now.

Sebastian suddenly lunged forward, attempting to engulf them in a teary group hug.

"You're angels! I love you both!"

Twin eye rolls met his dramatics as they shoved him off.

"Save the melodrama for your shareholders."

They finalized their strategy before parting ways.

Next Morning

Snow blanketed the city, frosting every surface in crystalline white.

Evelyn selected a knockout dress—crimson silk that clung to every curve—and styled her hair into artful waves.

Descending the staircase, she found Lucas wolf-whistling. "Hot date?"

William barely glanced up from his newspaper. "Nonsense. Your sister simply exists on another plane of beauty."

Lucas muttered something about unfair genetic blessings.
###Chapter 733

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "There might be some rumors circulating about me in the next few days. As long as it doesn't affect Sterling Enterprises' stock, just let it be, alright?"

William Sterling frowned, his brows knitting together. "What exactly are you implying?"

Evelyn hesitated for only a moment before explaining the situation with the Hart family.

William fell silent, his expression softening with sympathy. "After Old Master Hart lost his favorite grandson, he lost all interest in the company. It's truly heartbreaking. If there's anything you can do to help them, don't hesitate."

Evelyn and Lucas nodded obediently.

Sterling Tower

The moment Evelyn stepped out of her car, her gaze landed on Sebastian Hart, who was being held up at the reception desk.

Tall, broad-shouldered, and impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, he looked nothing like the disheveled man from yesterday. His striking features and magnetic presence made it clear why he was considered one of the most eligible bachelors in high society.

In his arms was an extravagant bouquet of roses, so grand it nearly obscured him from view.

The receptionist, flustered by such an obvious romantic gesture, hesitated to let him through. But the moment Evelyn entered the lobby, Sebastian's face lit up with relief. He spread his arms wide.

"Darling, it's been days! I've missed you terribly!"

The receptionist's hand hovered over her phone, ready to call security—until she saw Evelyn's reaction.

Her jaw nearly dropped.

Was this the same poised, elegant, and reserved President Sinclair?

Evelyn beamed and practically ran into Sebastian's arms.

The entire lobby froze.

Passersby stopped mid-step, eyes widening at the sight of the usually untouchable Evelyn Sinclair embracing a man like a lovesick schoolgirl.

They didn't dare stare for too long.

Within moments, the couple disappeared into the private elevator, hand in hand.

Inside, the playful energy faded.

"Did you contact the reporter?" Evelyn asked.

Sebastian checked his phone. "Relax. They have everything they need."

Fifteen minutes later, he left—reluctantly.

Less than half an hour after that, the internet exploded.

"Evelyn Sinclair and Sebastian Hart: Childhood Sweethearts Rekindle Romance?"

Evelyn scrolled through the comments, a satisfied smirk playing on her lips.

[They look perfect together! Power couple goals!]

[I swear, Evelyn Sinclair collects handsome men like designer handbags.]

[Poor Nathan Blackwood…]

Perfect. The reaction was even better than she’d hoped.

Blackwood Industries

Nathan emerged from his meeting, accepting his phone from Harrison. His assistant opened his mouth, then closed it.

"Sir—"

"Speak."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Sir, don’t overreact. It’s probably just tabloid nonsense—"

Nathan glanced at the screen.

His entire body went rigid.

The photo of Evelyn in Sebastian’s arms burned into his vision like a brand.

The phone shattered in his grip.

Harrison barely managed to sidestep the shards as Nathan stormed into his office, radiating fury.

The emotions Nathan had suppressed for months surged to the surface, raw and violent.

Sebastian.

The man who had pursued Evelyn relentlessly in the past.

She’d rather give him a chance than me?

"Take. It. Down."

His voice was ice.

Harrison immediately called the platform’s management.

But minutes later, the news wasn’t just still up—it was trending higher.

Harrison braced himself before re-entering the office.

"Sir… Horizon Media’s CEO, Dominic Kingsley, is insisting on keeping it up."

Meaning: Evelyn wanted it there.

Deliberately.
###Chapter 734

Nathan's gaze was icy, his expression dark and terrifying. The patience he'd shown Evelyn had evaporated. Now, all he wanted was to lock her away where no one else could touch her. His fists clenched, the veins at his temples throbbing. His voice was rough, edged with barely restrained fury.

"Take it down. Or destroy the platform."

Harrison's face tightened. He nodded immediately. "Understood, sir."

Nathan wasn't in the mood for distractions. If Harrison lingered, he'd only be inviting disaster. Within twenty minutes, the trending news vanished as quickly as it had appeared. A scandal about a celebrity couple's infidelity quickly took its place. Evelyn and Sebastian's photos were scrubbed clean from the internet.

But Evelyn didn’t care.

Those few hours of exposure had been enough to plant the seed in people’s minds. The news hadn’t affected Sterling Enterprises’ stock, but Hart Corporation’s shares had soared.

Nathan exhaled, his mind sharpening. Something about this felt off. If Evelyn had wanted to be with Sebastian, why now?

He summoned Harrison again. "Dig deeper. I want to know everything about this."

Hart Corporation.

Sebastian lounged in his office, triumphant.

For once, no one was nagging him about the arranged marriage. But when he refreshed his phone, the headlines were gone. Furious, he called the platform—only to learn Nathan Blackwood had intervened.

His blood boiled. He dialed Nathan immediately.

"Blackwood, you bastard!" Sebastian snarled. "I backed you against Preston Sinclair! I even talked you up to Evelyn! And this is how you repay me? Ruining my one shot at freedom? You think you still have a chance with her? You forced them to take down my trending topic? Do you know how long it took to set this up?"

Nathan had almost hung up on the unknown number, but Sebastian’s furious rant stopped him cold. His grip on the phone tightened. "What the hell are you talking about?"

"If Evelyn and I want to be together, no one can stop us. You think deleting the news changes anything? I’m done with you. From now on, I’m team Preston!" Sebastian hung up, his chest heaving with rage.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

His instincts screamed that this wasn’t just about romance. He turned to Harrison. "Investigate Sebastian Hart and Hart Corporation. Now."

A chill settled over him, his silver watch glinting ominously.

Soon, a confidential report landed on Nathan’s desk. He skimmed the first few pages and smirked.

It was all a ruse.

His mood lightened slightly—but the sight of those photos still burned. He hadn’t even held Evelyn like that. What right did Sebastian have?

Nathan scoffed.

Harrison watched warily. Nathan’s moods were unpredictable, even to those who knew him best.

"Since Sebastian doesn’t want to marry that woman," Nathan mused, "we should help him."

After all, Sebastian had chosen the right side—for now.

Sterling Enterprises.

Evelyn left work early.

As planned, she and Sebastian needed to be seen together. She drove herself to Hart Corporation, her mind sharp, her resolve unshaken.
###Chapter 735

Evelyn drove Lucas's Maserati through the city streets with effortless grace.

The sleek car turned heads as she pulled up to the entrance of Sterling Enterprises.

She strode through the lobby without hesitation, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

No one dared to stop the Sinclair heiress as she made her way to Sebastian's office.

The door swung open to reveal an unexpected scene.

Sebastian stood near his desk, flanked by an older couple and a woman who looked ready to spit fire.

Eleanor Hart, Sebastian's mother, sat stiffly in a chair nearby.

Sebastian's face lit up when he saw Evelyn. "There you are! I was starting to think you'd stood me up for dinner."

He crossed the room in three long strides and took her arm.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. Dinner? They'd only planned a quick public appearance for the paparazzi.

Sebastian gave her a subtle wink.

The other woman's face flushed crimson. "So it's true then? You're dating Evelyn Sinclair?"

Her voice dripped with venom. "You rejected me for some rich bitch with connections?"

Adrienne Sinclair had been obsessed with Sebastian Hart since before her divorce.

At every high society event, she'd watched him from across the room - so different from the overweight trust fund babies she usually encountered.

Her plan had been perfect: divorce her husband, convince her father to pressure the Harts, and finally land the man of her dreams.

Until Evelyn Sinclair ruined everything.

Evelyn immediately recognized the woman. Adrienne Sinclair.

Standing beside her was Terence Sinclair, a major shareholder in Sterling Enterprises.

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. Rich and powerful? Guilty as charged.

Terence looked distinctly uncomfortable. He tugged at his daughter's sleeve. "Mind your manners."

The older man stood and offered his hand. "Ms. Sinclair, what an honor."

His voice held a note of forced politeness.

Everyone knew what Evelyn had done to Sterling Enterprises.

Terence might have betrayed his old friend Reginald Hart, but he wasn't stupid enough to cross the Sinclair heiress.

Evelyn ignored the outstretched hand. "The honor is mine, Mr. Sinclair. I've heard so much about you."

Her tone could have frozen hell.

Terence withdrew his hand with an awkward chuckle. "Sebastian, we'll leave you to your guest. Adrienne, let's go."

Adrienne dug in her heels. "Answer me, Evelyn. Are you going to marry him? If not, stop leading him on!"

Terence paled. "Adrienne!"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "And what business is that of yours?"

The simple dismissal cut deeper than any insult.

Adrienne's lips trembled. "If it weren't for you, Sebastian and I would be engaged by now!"

Sebastian scoffed. "In your dreams. Why would I marry a twice-divorced social climber?"

Adrienne pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn. "She's divorced too!"

The temperature in the room dropped twenty degrees.

Evelyn's expression turned glacial.

Terence looked ready to faint. "Ms. Sinclair, please forgive my daughter. She's been spoiled rotten."

Eleanor Hart finally spoke, her voice dripping with disdain.

"Spare us the act, Adrienne. You're not fit to lick Evelyn's boots.

After what your family did to mine, you should be grateful we're not pressing charges.

Find some other poor bastard to trap - preferably one closer to your own age."
###Chapter 736

Sebastian's mother appeared frailer than usual. The stress of recent events had clearly taken its toll—her appetite vanished, sleep eluded her.

The moment the topic arose, she couldn't contain her fury any longer. Her words lashed out, sharp and unrelenting. Adrienne Sinclair's face flushed crimson, humiliation twisting her features. The disdain in Mrs. Hart's tone was unmistakable—she might as well have branded her dislike for Adrienne across her forehead.

Nathan Blackwood's patience snapped. His glare burned into Sebastian and his mother before he forced a rigid smile, dragging Adrienne out of the office. He could pressure Sebastian into compliance, but playing games in front of Evelyn Sinclair? Impossible.

Mrs. Hart spat out her contempt, eyes glistening with unshed tears. Then she turned to Evelyn, crossing the room with quiet gratitude.

"Thank you, Evelyn. Truly. I don't know what we would have done without you today."

The irony wasn't lost on Evelyn. Years ago, Mrs. Hart had warned her to stay away from Sebastian. Now, regret shadowed her every word.

In status, beauty, and character, Evelyn outshone every socialite in the city. Why had she been so stubborn?

Divorce wasn't the end.

Evelyn's smile was cool, detached. She never forgot a slight.

"Mrs. Hart, don't mention it. My father and Old Master Hart have been friends for years. Sebastian and I grew up together. Helping was only natural."

She made sure to emphasize—this wasn't about lingering feelings.

Mrs. Hart caught the unspoken boundary. Her smile faltered, disappointment heavy in her sigh. Regret was pointless now.

The Hart family was drowning. No time to dwell on past mistakes.

Sebastian, oblivious to the exchange, pulled Evelyn aside. "Thank God you showed up. Terence Sinclair actually accused me of fabricating scandals to pressure him. As if I care if he sees through it."

Evelyn chuckled. "Don't let your guard down. You need answers—fast."

Mrs. Hart excused herself, sensing her presence was unnecessary.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Relax, I've already got people digging. Terence has never been subtle. The moment he slips up, I'll have him removed from the board."

Evelyn exhaled, relieved he had a plan. Then, a thought struck her, and she smirked.

"Adrienne Sinclair doesn't look a day over forty. And she seems... quite taken with you."

Sebastian recoiled as if bitten. "She gets work done in Seoul every other year. That face isn't hers. Know why she's divorced? Caught in bed with male escorts. Her husband walked in on them at a club. Made a scene, divorced her immediately."

Evelyn blinked. She hadn't seen that coming.

Before she could respond, Lucas Sterling called. Nathan had arrived at Sterling Manor—again.

Her pulse spiked.

He was visiting far too often.

Evelyn bid Sebastian farewell and drove home. The living room was empty. Lucas jerked his thumb toward the garden. "Out there fishing with Dad."

Her frown deepened. "What does he want?"

Lucas shrugged. "You, obviously. Saw the news about you and Sebastian. Probably panicking."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She changed into loungewear, draping a cashmere throw over her shoulders before descending the stairs—just as William Sterling and Nathan stepped inside.
###Chapter 737

The butler took the fishing gear from Donovan and Nathan as they entered. Nathan stood tall, his crisp white shirt casually unbuttoned at the collar, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone. His Adam's apple moved slightly as he swallowed, his jawline rigid and perfect. The picture of effortless elegance.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn descending the stairs. A slow, knowing smile curved his lips. "Evelyn. What a pleasant surprise."

'Fate keeps bringing us together,' Nathan thought.

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "This is my home. Obviously I'd be here."

William Sterling emerged from washing up. "Mr. Blackwood, you must stay for dinner. We've caught enough fish to feed an army—would be a shame to let it go to waste."

Nathan inclined his head gracefully. "Then I'll trouble you." Inside, he was already celebrating this unexpected opportunity.

Evelyn turned away abruptly, moving to pour herself water. Nathan followed silently. The faint scent of jasmine clung to him—from William's garden blooms. Natural. Understated. Elegant. Just like him.

"I'm thirsty too." His voice was a low, rough murmur that sent shivers down her spine.

Before she could react, his hand—long fingers, neatly trimmed nails—closed over hers, taking the glass. He drained it in one smooth motion as if this intimacy between them was the most natural thing in the world.

Lucas chose that moment to appear.

"Are you two incapable of using your own glasses? That's mine!" His glare could have frozen lava.

Nathan nearly choked.

Evelyn blinked. "Lucas, I poured this specially for you. Aren't you touched?"

Lucas' icy stare raked over them both. "Hmph!" He snatched his glass and stormed off.

That glass had been part of a set he shared with Natalie.

Nathan watched him leave, lips pressed thin. "I went to your office. They said you'd already left. Where did you go?" His dark eyes burned with unspoken intensity.

If not for Nathan's recent help, Evelyn would have thrown him out then and there. She paused half a beat before smiling sweetly. "I went to see Sebastian." 'Let him get jealous. Let him rage. Let him leave.'

Nathan's expression darkened momentarily—then, surprisingly, smoothed. "I assume he hasn't found a solution yet."

Evelyn stiffened. 'Solution to what?'

Nathan produced a silver flash drive with a smirk. "This contains what he's been searching for."

Evelyn's breath caught. "What do you mean?"

Suddenly he was right there, his handsome face inches from hers. "Why don't we take a look?"

Heart pounding, Evelyn led the way to the study without realizing Nathan followed. 'How does he know about this? We didn't even tell Isabella...'

The drive's contents made her blood run cold.

Document after document proving Terence Sinclair's crimes—forged signatures on critical contracts, all in Old Master Hart's name. Exactly what Sebastian needed.

Nathan leaned against the desk, studying a framed family photo of the Sterlings. Such warmth. Such love.

Something he'd never known.

His eyes shadowed momentarily before he schooled his features. "You could have come to me," he said softly. "I would have moved heaven and earth for you. But staging a scandal? That just invites misunderstanding."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the drive. "How did you get these?"

Nathan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Some secrets are best kept, darling. Just know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you."

The air between them crackled with unspoken truths and dangerous possibilities.
###Chapter 738

Now it all made sense why Nathan hadn't acted sooner. He'd been conducting a thorough investigation.

Evelyn remained composed. "I'm merely assisting a friend."

She shut the laptop and removed the flash drive. "I'll have Sebastian express his gratitude properly." This wasn't her battle anyway.

Nathan's chiseled features softened with a faint smile, though his voice remained icy. "Unnecessary. Sebastian's elder brother was my comrade-in-arms. I won't stand idle while their family crumbles. Though I do hope that incompetent Sebastian develops some brains. What good is he if he can't even protect their remaining assets?"

Evelyn had no rebuttal. She'd nearly forgotten Nathan's connection to the Hart family. "So you came here—"

'Just to deliver a flash drive? That seems unnecessarily roundabout,' she thought.

Nathan's gaze locked onto her reflection in the window. "I simply needed an excuse to see you." So blunt! Typical Nathan Blackwood.

His dark eyes burned with intensity, forcing Evelyn to look away within seconds. Ignoring his declaration, she said, "Let's go down for dinner—"

Goosebumps prickled her skin. 'Couldn't he show some restraint?!'

The butler directed maids to set the table. Lucas was video-calling someone downstairs. Evelyn recognized Natalie's voice immediately.

When the camera angle shifted, Natalie spotted Evelyn—and Nathan standing unnervingly close behind her. Her eyes widened in shock.

Lucas, unfazed, proudly showed Natalie the dinner spread. "Nat, I'll bring you next time! Dad's fish are incredibly fresh! I'll make him catch extra so you can take some home!" William kicked Lucas from behind.

"Using your father as bait to impress girls now?"

Lucas ended the call and grinned, pulling out a chair for his father. "Dad, don't be dramatic. It's nothing serious—"

Evelyn and Nathan flanked William at the table while Lucas took the seat opposite. Throughout dinner, Nathan behaved impeccably, engaging William in conversation and preventing any awkward silences.

Lucas focused on eating, occasionally placing peeled shrimp on Evelyn's plate. She kept her head down, actually consuming the food—unlike the others. When her plate emptied, Nathan wordlessly slid a plate of perfectly peeled shrimp toward her.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. Nathan met her gaze calmly, smiled, and resumed discussing business with William as if nothing had happened.

Lucas paid Nathan no mind. Seeing the mountain of shrimp before Evelyn, he shamelessly stole the entire plate. "Did you forget what I told you? Excess shrimp raises cholesterol levels—" Evelyn rolled her eyes. 'Whatever. Now he's playing nutritionist?'

As Lucas ate, he felt an icy stare—but when he looked up, everyone seemed occupied. Must've imagined it.

After dinner, Nathan finally departed. Lucas accompanied William for their nightly drama while Evelyn retreated to the study to contact Sebastian.

Dawn arrived swiftly.

Evelyn had Bennett deliver the flash drive to Sebastian.

By noon, news exploded across financial circles: Carter Corporation shareholder Terence Sinclair had embezzled company funds and forged Chairman Hart's signatures. Sebastian ensured maximum publicity, guaranteeing Terence's permanent disgrace.

The court sentenced both Terence and his daughter Adrienne to prison—though Terence took full blame, securing Adrienne's early release.

Furious, Adrienne stormed Carter Corporation seeking vengeance, but Sebastian's guards barred her entrance. Humiliated, she drowned her rage at her usual club, drunkenly hooking up with an Ian lookalike gigolo.

When Terence received this news in prison, he collapsed on the spot.
###Chapter 739

The crisis at Hart Enterprises was finally over. Sebastian planned to rebuild the company, but given his current situation, it was wiser to let professional administrators take charge first and oversee its complete liquidation.

As time passed, the media frenzy surrounding Evelyn and Sebastian faded into obscurity, as if it had never happened.

Not long after, Evelyn received an urgent call from Jonathan Reeves. Trouble had erupted in Sandford. Without hesitation, Evelyn rushed over, heading straight to Zenith Corp's headquarters.

A crowd had gathered at the entrance, sitting in silent protest. The sight made Evelyn's expression darken.

This was far worse than Jonathan had described. He had hired security to block the protesters from entering the building. Nearby, police cars and ambulances stood by, ready to intervene if tensions escalated.

Evelyn took a deep breath and stayed in the car for a moment, assessing the situation. Bennett called Jonathan out to meet them.

Ten minutes later, Jonathan emerged, dressed casually and wearing a mask to avoid recognition. "Ms. Sinclair..."

He felt ashamed that he had to rely on a young woman to handle his problems. Evelyn gave him a reassuring nod, her voice steady.

"Mr. Reeves, we know you've done your best. What's the current situation?"

Jonathan hesitated before answering. "We had this under control, but Lawrence Sinclair refused to back down. He stirred up a few of his allies to cause trouble. They're demanding the same compensation as the regular employees, which is completely unreasonable..."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "Did you try negotiating with them?"

Jonathan scoffed. "The moment they heard they could get more money, they pounced like vultures. There's no reasoning with them. We've already given them fair treatment, but they're insatiable!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "The unveiling ceremony for this project is in a few days. We’ll have reporters and media there. If this isn’t resolved today, we’ll lose all credibility."

Their previous advantage would vanish overnight. Reputation was everything—they couldn’t afford to slip up now.

After a brief silence, Evelyn’s voice cut through the tension. "Bennett, prepare one million in cash."

Bennett stared at her in shock. Even Jonathan was stunned. Was she really going to give in to their demands?

"Ms. Sinclair, they’ll never be satisfied. If we give them money now, they’ll just keep coming back for more."

Evelyn smirked, her gaze fixed on the crowd. "I have a plan."

Bennett didn’t question her. He made a call to the bank, arranging for the cash to be delivered immediately.

Then, Evelyn stepped out of the car.

Jonathan and Bennett hurried after her.

The moment Evelyn appeared, the protesters grew restless.

"That’s the Sterling heiress! She’s loaded! Her company took over Zenith Corp and left us jobless! Make her pay!"

"Yeah! Why should she have all that money while we get nothing?"

The crowd surged forward, eyes gleaming with greed, like wolves circling prey. Bennett, familiar with Sandford’s darker side, stayed close to Evelyn, ready to shield her if needed.

Evelyn remained composed, her poise unshaken. Even in the face of hostility, she exuded an air of effortless superiority.

She picked up a megaphone from the ground, then tore open the bag of cash in her hands—letting the bills scatter across the pavement.
###Chapter 740

The crowd fell silent instantly.

Evelyn Sinclair's piercing gaze swept over them. "I'm not Lawrence Sinclair or Victor Langley. I never made you any promises." Her voice cut through the air like ice. "You took unemployment benefits from the state and wasted your days here. I've paid every cent Zenith Corp legally owed you. I have more integrity than they ever did."

The sheer force of her presence left everyone stunned. The silence was deafening.

A restless murmur spread through the group. Someone shouted, "That's our right! You bought the company—you should pay us! We demand the same compensation as those ten people earlier. Why the difference?"

"Yeah! Why not?"

"You barely gave us anything!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial as she locked onto the speaker. "No contract, no obligation. I'm not a charity or an endless vault of cash. If you're unhappy, sue me." The moment the words left her lips, the crowd erupted in outrage.

Then, her tone softened.

"But... I understand life isn't easy for any of you." She gestured to a briefcase nearby. "There's a million dollars here. Split between a hundred of you, that's ten thousand each. If you want it, go register your name and ID. Take the money and leave."

Excitement rippled through the crowd. Ten thousand for sitting around for two days? It was more than they'd expected.

Evelyn continued, her voice firm. "But let me be clear—if you take this money today, don’t come back later crying foul. Those who refuse the cash and want a job will get hiring priority."

The offer hung in the air.

Take ten grand and walk away, or stay for a chance at employment. Both were tempting. The crowd hesitated, weighing their options.

Then, a voice cut through the tension. "Don't trust her! That's nothing! We deserve more!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. She flicked a glance at Bennett, who signaled the bodyguards. Within seconds, the troublemaker was restrained.

Her voice remained eerily calm. "Lawrence Sinclair is already behind bars. He doesn’t care about you. He’s using you to cause trouble. If I call the police, every one of you will have a criminal record. Think about your kids—their schools, their futures. You have thirty minutes to decide. After that, I dial the police."

Fear flashed across their faces.

They hadn’t realized the consequences. Some already regretted coming. Their own lives might be ruined, but their children? That was unforgivable.

Evelyn knew their weakness.

The million was her mercy. The police threat, her leverage.

She tossed the megaphone to Jonathan Reeves and strode toward the office, Bennett at her heels.

Inside, her tone was clipped.

"Register every person who takes the money. If they accept compensation, they’re admitting they’re not unemployed. We’ll need proof for the authorities."

###Chapter 741

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't one to stir up trouble, but she wasn't naive enough to leave without evidence. Those greedy vultures would come circling again, and she needed to be prepared.

Nathan Blackwood watched her with quiet admiration, nodding in approval.

What should have been a messy, complicated situation had been handled with precision—part charm, part steel.

That was why she was CEO material.

She retreated to her office for a brief respite, exhaling slowly. Thirty minutes later, Jonathan Reeves burst in, slightly out of breath.

"Ms. Sinclair, the crowd's dispersed—"

Evelyn arched a brow. "And?"

Jonathan nearly applauded her brilliance. "Half took the money and left. Five or six wanted jobs, so I took their details. The rest scattered."

A faint smirk curved her lips as she traced the rim of her coffee cup.

The ones who refused the money? Probably afraid of repercussions. Smart. Family-oriented.

"That ringleader?"

Jonathan nodded. "Police took him. Turns out he's Lawrence Sinclair's brother-in-law. Safe to say Lawrence had a hand in this mess."

Evelyn's lips thinned.

"Stay sharp. Nothing can derail the project unveiling."

Jonathan knew the stakes. He straightened. "Understood."

Then, hesitating, he added, "Victor Langley confessed to falsifying records under Lawrence's orders. With the evidence, Lawrence had to admit fault, but..."

Evelyn waited.

"Lawrence set traps throughout this project. He won't take responsibility for the deaths. His father-in-law and brother-in-law handled construction. Even after accidents, they never changed contractors. When someone died, they just paid hush money and moved on. When we tried to hire a new contractor, they blocked every bid in Sandford."

Evelyn paused. "Then how did we get one?"

Jonathan stiffened. "Mr. Blackwood's referral."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened.

Jonathan rushed to clarify. "Leonard Whitmore passed along the contact, but he made it clear—Nathan Blackwood arranged it. He knew we'd struggle to find someone."

He added quickly, "I vetted them. Clean record. Solid reputation. No skeletons."

Meaning this contractor was practically heaven-sent.

Evelyn's mouth twitched. Since when does Nathan Blackwood care about my problems?

"If the contractor's clean, use them. Nathan might have lost the bid, but he's not petty enough to sabotage construction."

That would be beneath him.

Jonathan exhaled in relief, nodding eagerly. "I think he did it for you—didn’t want you stressed over minor details—"

Bennett, standing nearby, shot him a look. Wrong move.

Evelyn's expression remained cool. She stood, glancing at Bennett. "Let's head back to the hotel."

The Sterling Enterprises-owned hotel was still under renovation, so Bennett had booked a luxury service apartment instead.

Back in her suite, Evelyn powered through urgent emails before changing into something comfortable. A nap was overdue.

Bennett left to collect documents from Zenith Corp.

When Evelyn woke, dusk had settled over the city.
###Chapter 742

The night was pitch black, with streams of headlights cutting through the darkness below.

This winter bit harder than most, the wind slicing through layers like a knife.

Evelyn Sinclair's stomach growled.

Across the street, she spotted someone devouring a hot dog in the 24-hour convenience store. The sight made her mouth water.

It had been years since she'd tasted one.

Suddenly, the five-star hotel cuisine lost all appeal. She needed that hot dog.

Grabbing her coat and phone, Evelyn dashed downstairs in casual sweats.

The moment she entered the store, all thoughts of her strict diet vanished. The aroma of grilled meat and toasted buns overwhelmed her senses. She perched by the floor-to-ceiling window, demolishing the hot dog in record time.

Outside, the traffic gradually thinned as midnight approached.

Streetlights cast an eerie glow through the frosty air. Evelyn stood, tossing her wrapper away.

The pedestrian signal turned red just as she reached the crosswalk.

She paused. The world seemed unnaturally quiet.

Her phone vibrated violently. Jonathan Reeves' name flashed on screen. She answered with a frown. "Mr. Reeves—"

"Ms. Sinclair, the police just reviewed all surveillance footage from the construction site. They found something—a temporary worker handling crane transportation. This man appears days before each incident, then vanishes—"

Evelyn's breath hitched. This confirmed her suspicions—no accidents, only sabotage.

The walk signal turned green.

"Any ID on him?" She stepped onto the crosswalk. "If he's local—"

A sudden engine roar split the night.

Evelyn whirled toward the sound. Blinding headlights temporarily blinded her.

"—facial scar makes him easily identifiable," Jonathan continued. "Police believe he's one of Lawrence Sinclair's hired—"

The world tilted.

A massive truck barreled toward her at impossible speed.

Yet in that split second, she saw him clearly—the driver's jagged scar.

The horn blared. Wind rushed past. Time seemed to stop.

Impact came.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. Every muscle locked, but her reflexes—honed by years of danger—kicked in a millisecond faster than most.

She twisted backward.

The truck's vortex of wind and exhaust fumes enveloped her. Her face drained of color.

Then—salvation.

A strong hand yanked her arm backward with bruising force. The grip—warm, steady, unshakable—wrenched her from death's path. Cold sweat drenched her clothes.

The truck roared past. Evelyn collapsed, hearing something snap. White-hot pain lanced through her body.

No Nathan Blackwood to save her this time.

Agony exploded—first numbness, then fire in her veins.

Her vision darkened. The world muted.

She couldn't speak, only stare at the starless sky.

The man lifted her gently. His voice tickled her memory.

Preston Sinclair. "Evelyn! Stay awake! Hospital—now!" The usually composed Wall Street tycoon sounded frantic. His polished mask had shattered, revealing raw terror as he cradled her broken form.
###Chapter 743

Jonathan Reeves's voice trembled with panic. "What now? If Chairman Sterling discovers something happened to Ms. Sinclair while she was under my watch, I'm finished—"

Bennett remained composed. "Mr. Reeves, just focus on your tasks. I've already informed Chairman Sterling and Ms. Sinclair's brothers about the accident. They'll be here soon. Our priority is cooperating with the police and providing evidence."

His tone was steady, but beneath it, he fought to suppress the fear clawing at him.

The consequences if Evelyn died? Unthinkable.

It would be his greatest failure.

Evelyn gazed out the window, watching the golden sunlight filter through swaying branches.

Her mind replayed the blinding headlights, the screech of tires, the truck barreling toward her.

A shudder ran through her.

Bennett noticed the moment her eyes fluttered open. He rushed into the ward, voice thick with emotion. "Ms. Sinclair—"

She blinked, confirming she wasn’t dreaming. "Did you catch him?"

Her voice came out hoarse.

Bennett quickly handed her a glass of water with a straw.

She took a sip, clarity returning. "Yes. The covert security team stopped him. His truck crashed into a tree, and he knocked himself out. He’s in custody now—the same man from the construction site."

Bennett relayed the details methodically.

With Evelyn awake, everything he’d done had meaning.

She nodded, then hesitated. "The one who saved me... Was it Preston Sinclair?"

Bennett’s expression darkened. "Mr. Sinclair had just arrived in Sandford for business. He contacted me for your address, saying he wanted to bring you dinner. I—"

He’d sent Evelyn a text about Preston’s arrival, but after the accident, he realized it had never been read.

Evelyn glanced around. "Where is he?"

Bennett’s eyes reddened.

"Ms. Sinclair, your blood type is rare. The local blood bank didn’t have reserves. There wasn’t enough time to get supplies from New York, so... Mr. Sinclair donated his blood to you."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The revelation sent a tremor through her. A sharp, unexpected pang of emotion twisted in her chest.

"He gave over twice the standard amount. He’s still unconscious in another ward."

Preston shared her blood type.

The realization left her stunned.

Memories surged—Nathan Blackwood, the years she’d wasted giving her blood to Vanessa Holloway, draining herself for a man who never cared.

She knew the value of her blood type. Her father, William Sterling, had even funded a private blood bank in New York for emergencies.

Yet she’d once thrown it away, desperate for Nathan’s love.

Humiliation burned through her.

What was the difference between her past self and Preston Sinclair now?
###Chapter 744

Evelyn couldn't stop thinking about Preston Sinclair's gentleness.

The way he'd confessed his feelings—hesitant, vulnerable—as if terrified she might reject him, yet equally afraid she wouldn't understand.

Her chest ached, a suffocating pressure squeezing her heart.

Something inside her softened.

She pressed her lips together. Preston had saved her life. That debt couldn't be ignored.

"President, the doctors confirmed you're stable, but your right leg fracture requires bed rest. I've arranged for a transfer to New York. The medical facilities there are superior, and your family can oversee your care."

Evelyn hesitated. "We'll return once Mr. Sinclair wakes."

No wonder her right leg throbbed. The pain was dulled by anesthesia, but the fracture was undeniable.

At least it wasn't worse.

She'd nearly died.

Lincoln Sinclair's reach was longer than she'd anticipated. Even imprisoned, he'd orchestrated this attack.

He'd dared to target her.

Her expression darkened. This viper needed to be eliminated.

Nathan Blackwood had eyes everywhere in Sandford. The moment he learned of Evelyn's accident, he canceled his evening meeting and drove through the night to the hospital.

Standing outside her door, his pulse hammered.

Fear and fury twisted inside him.

A cold, murderous rage threatened to consume him.

He wanted blood.

Then he overheard Bennett's words.

His body locked.

Preston Sinclair shares Evelyn's blood type?

The realization struck like a blade.

Nathan remembered why Evelyn had divorced him—because he'd forced her to donate blood to Vanessa Holloway, treating her like a commodity.

Now, Preston had saved her. Preston had given his blood.

What had Nathan done?

The shame burned.

He couldn't face her. Not now. Not when this would only dredge up the past.

He'd been banking on Evelyn's lingering feelings for him.

If he barged in now, even that fragile hope would shatter.

After a long moment, Nathan turned and left as silently as he'd arrived.

Evelyn was alive. That was enough.

They had time.

Bennett excused himself when he noticed Evelyn's exhaustion.

Soon after, William Sterling arrived with his sons, Alexander and Lucas. William's eyes were red-rimmed, Lucas supporting him. Bennett greeted them respectfully.

William and Lucas entered the ward.

Alexander remained outside, his expression icy as he demanded details.

The Sterlings were furious.

Lincoln Sinclair had underestimated them.

A few unchecked murders had inflated his ego, made him reckless.

He'd never met Evelyn, yet he blamed her for his downfall.

Even from prison, he'd made sure she regretted coming to Sandford.
###Chapter 745

Bennett and the others knew without a doubt that this was Lawrence Sinclair's doing, but there was no proof.

"The police have done everything they can," Bennett said. "But the driver still refuses to talk."

Alexander Sterling listened to the full report, his expression dark and unreadable.

"This is taking too long," he said coldly. "Find out who the driver is. Track down his family. Whoever they are, they need to understand the pain Evelyn went through. If he has no family, then plant our own people inside. Make sure both the driver and Lawrence Sinclair regret ever being born."

Alexander didn’t hesitate to use the most ruthless methods. Sterling Enterprises was meant for Evelyn to enjoy, not to risk her life for.

Anyone who dared threaten her would live to regret it.

Bennett had worked for Alexander for years, back when he still operated in the shadows before shifting to legitimate business. He knew Alexander was just like Nathan Blackwood—hardened by the cruelty of the world, indifferent to everyone except those they loved.

Compared to Alexander’s power, Lawrence Sinclair was nothing.

Bennett nodded. "Understood. I’ll handle it immediately."

Working for Evelyn had softened him, made him forget the ruthless man he used to be.

Evelyn stirred, blinking groggily as she took in the unfamiliar hospital room. Someone sat with their back to her.

When the figure turned, Lucas Sterling’s handsome face came into view.

"Lil E!" he grinned, brightening when he saw her awake. "Look! I signed your cast! It’s worth a fortune now!"

Her right foot was wrapped in plaster, covered in colorful doodles and Lucas’ flamboyant signature.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why don’t you just give me a check? I’ll sell it back to you."

Lucas scoffed, about to retort when William Sterling suddenly stood, his eyes brimming with tears.

"Lil E, does it still hurt? Daddy’s heart is breaking!"

Evelyn’s throat tightened. She had almost never seen her family again. The warmth in her chest swelled, tears pricking at her eyes.

Lucas sighed dramatically and walked away.

It’s just a fracture. Why are they acting like it’s life or death?

Back when he’d been injured on set—three nails embedded in his back, bedridden for six months—William hadn’t shed a single tear. He’d just told Lucas to consider a career change.

Am I not his son too?

The door opened, and Alexander stepped in. His stern expression softened the moment he saw Evelyn awake.

"Are you okay? I’ll call the doctor."

Evelyn shook her head. "I’m fine."

William sighed, turning to Alexander. "Let’s get her home. This place feels unsafe."

Alexander nodded, but Evelyn protested. "Preston Sinclair saved me. He’s not awake yet—we should wait for him."

Soon, the Sterling men—including Donovan, who joined via video call—gathered around Evelyn’s bed to discuss arrangements.

With her injured, William refused to let her return to work. She would recuperate at home.

Alexander agreed.

Lucas seconded the motion.

Donovan was too absorbed in his experiments to contribute.

An hour later, a doctor knocked and entered.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Sinclair is awake. He insists on seeing you."

Before the doctor could finish, the door opened again.

Preston Sinclair stood there, pale and weak from blood loss.

He blinked at the crowd inside, then offered a polite nod.

"Chairman Sterling. Looks like I’ve interrupted a family meeting."
###Chapter 746

William Sterling's attitude toward Preston Sinclair was noticeably warmer. After all, Preston was the one who had saved Evelyn. That set him apart from her usual admirers.

"Preston, you should rest. Are you feeling better now?"

Preston nodded. His gaze shifted to Evelyn. Seeing her right leg in a cast, his pupils contracted sharply.

Evelyn smiled. "Just a fracture. It'll heal soon. Mr. Sinclair, thank you."

Her gratitude was genuine.

In that moment, her reflexes hadn't been fast enough to avoid the car. Without Preston, her injuries would have been far worse than a fractured leg.

Preston's eyes were still slightly red. His face was pale as he managed a weak smile.

"I'm just glad you're alright."

Lucas chuckled from the side. "I think we should leave and let Evelyn talk to Mr. Sinclair alone!"

Preston shot him a grateful look.

William smacked the back of Lucas's head. "Nonsense! At a time like this, family should stick together. Preston's family isn't here, so we're his family now. How could we leave? They're both patients—what if they faint?"

Lucas rubbed his head, looking dumbfounded, then nodded obediently.

"Right. Dad's always the most thoughtful—"

"Hmph!"

William rolled his eyes and hurried to support Preston.

"Come on, Preston. The car's ready. We're just waiting for you. We've arranged everything with the hospital in New York—you'll get the best care. I'm your Uncle William now, and I'll make sure you recover completely!"

William's enthusiasm for Preston had doubled, especially after learning they shared the same blood type.

Preston, flustered, moved to sit down.

Alexander Sterling raised an eyebrow subtly. William had always kept his distance from Evelyn's suitors. Even Nathan Blackwood only ever addressed him as "Chairman Sterling."

But now, William was calling himself "Uncle William"? The change was... unusual.

Evelyn smiled at Preston's nervousness and reassured him.

"My father is truly grateful to you. He's always been warm and affectionate, so don't feel restrained, Mr. Sinclair."

Lucas nearly choked. Warm and affectionate? Yeah, right.

Preston smiled and nodded. Despite his sickly pallor, his expression remained gentle. "Then I’ll trouble you, Uncle William."

"Not at all!"

To ensure the patients' comfort, William had arranged two Rolls-Royces—renowned for their unmatched stability and luxury.

Preston and Alexander rode in one car, while William, Lucas, and Evelyn took the other.

Lucas kept poking Evelyn's cast. "Does it hurt?"

At first, the pain had been mild, but once the anesthesia wore off, a deep, throbbing ache spread through her bones.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Why won’t the universe just take him already?

It hurt—badly. But she didn’t want William to worry and delay their return, so she forced a smile.

"Nope. Barely feel it. Just a dull ache, totally manageable."

William glanced at his resilient daughter with pride, then shot Lucas a disapproving look.

"You think she's like you? You demand painkillers for a stomachache and make a scene over every scratch. Your sister’s tougher than you’ll ever be."

Lucas lowered his head. Is it a crime to have a low pain tolerance?

In the other car, the atmosphere was icy and silent.

The driver didn’t speak. Alexander didn’t know what to say. Preston didn’t know how to start a conversation.

Halfway through the ride, Alexander suddenly remembered something.

"Mr. Sinclair, what brought you to Sandford so suddenly?"

Sandford was far less developed than New York or San Francisco, with limited growth potential.

Why would Preston Sinclair—a Wall Street tycoon and high-profile investor—go there?

"To see Evelyn." Preston answered frankly. He smiled, his voice warm and refined.
###Chapter 747

Preston Sinclair raised an eyebrow, hesitating for a brief moment before speaking.

"I don't understand, Mr. Sterling. Are you interested in Evelyn?"

A faint smirk appeared on his pale face.

"Yes. I've been pursuing her all along."

Facing Alexander Sterling—a man who could read people's intentions with a single glance, and who might even become his future brother-in-law—Preston saw no point in hiding anything.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. It was the answer he had expected. "Mr. Sinclair, do you think I stand a chance?"

Preston couldn't help but ask. The uncertainty made him uneasy, and he sought some reassurance from Alexander.

After all, Alexander was Evelyn's brother.

Alexander lowered his gaze, his tone carrying a hint of amused sympathy. "Mr. Sinclair, in our family, opinions don’t matter much. Evelyn always has the final say."

No one could sway Evelyn’s decisions. When she had been determined to cut ties with the Sterling family to marry Nathan Blackwood, their protests had been useless—only fueling her defiance.

Now, they knew better than to interfere.

As long as Evelyn was happy, who cared who she chose?

With the Sterling family behind her, no one would dare mistreat her.

Preston froze for a second, sensing the unspoken history in Alexander’s words.

He nodded, offering a quiet, understanding smile.

His upbringing had taught him not to pry into secrets others weren’t willing to share.

The car soon arrived in New York City.

William Sterling had close ties with the director of the elite private hospital. The patients here were anything but ordinary, and the medical equipment was the finest in the world.

Naturally, it was also the most expensive.

Evelyn’s rare blood type wouldn’t get priority in a regular hospital, but here, she did.

They ran another thorough examination.

Evelyn’s leg was badly fractured, leaving her unable to walk. A nurse with impeccable bedside manners helped wheel her around.

The series of tests took over an hour.

When they were finally done, the nurse cheerfully pushed Evelyn back to her private ward.

Preston was waiting outside.

He sat with his forehead resting against loosely clenched fists.

Evelyn paused, signaling for the nurse to leave. She pressed the button on her motorized wheelchair and moved toward him.

Her emotions tangled at the sight of him.

Her heart ached—for him, and for the version of herself she had been during those three miserable years married to Nathan.

She didn’t want Preston to suffer like she had. That kind of pain was unbearable.

It shattered pride. It destroyed confidence.

Preston looked up as she approached. His eyes were still slightly red, but his gaze remained warm.

He smiled, though his face was still pale from blood loss. His concern immediately shifted to her leg.

"How was the checkup? Does it still hurt?"

He had noticed her pain the moment they stepped out of the car—how hard she had bitten her lip to keep from crying out.

A warmth spread through her chest. She chuckled. "It stopped hurting a while ago."

Preston’s expression softened, his well-defined brows relaxing slightly. "Good."

Evelyn hesitated. "I didn’t expect we’d have the same blood type. If something happens to either of us, we’re both in trouble."

Preston’s smile faded. His gaze intensified.

"Evelyn, your blood type might be rare, but you’re not alone. No one is beyond saving—especially not you."

Evelyn froze.

Except for those three years when she had been nothing but a blood bank for Vanessa Holloway, she had always valued her life above all else.
###Chapter 748

Now and forever.

"By the way, have you finished your business in Sandford?" Evelyn asked.

Preston replied, "I came looking for you."

His gaze burned too intensely, his words too warm and tender. It flustered Evelyn. She couldn't bring herself to meet his eyes.

She bit her lip, blinking rapidly to maintain composure.

"Was there something specific you needed?"

Preston studied her intently. Her eyes shimmered faintly like stars. Up close, they sparkled brilliantly.

After a long moment, he suddenly chuckled. The corners of his lips curled into a dangerously charming smile.

"I'm particularly interested in you. Of course I'd find excuses to see you."

Evelyn froze. She hadn't expected such bluntness.

For a heartbeat, she couldn't formulate a response.

Watching her struggle, Preston's eyes darkened with amusement. "Speechless? If you're that moved—"

"Samuel, I'm entrusting my daughter to your care. When she's discharged, I expect her livelier than ever!"

William Sterling's booming voice approached Evelyn's hospital room.

"Don't worry. Ms. Sterling's recovery is remarkable, thanks to her boyfriend. How did you find one with matching blood type? With him around, she's practically invincible!"

A cheerful elderly voice responded. The door swung open.

Four pairs of eyes met.

Evelyn recovered first, smiling at the man beside her father.

"Dr. Whitmore, how are you?"

The director was an old family friend who'd treated Evelyn since childhood.

Neither Dr. Whitmore nor William showed any embarrassment at being overheard.

"Ms. Sterling, your father's threatening me with bribes. Your health better cooperate!"

Evelyn laughed. "The doctor said it's minor. I'll walk again in months."

Dr. Whitmore nodded. William stepped forward to push Evelyn's wheelchair.

"Enough distractions. Everyone out—my daughter needs rest!"

After brief farewells, Dr. Whitmore left. Preston entered properly.

"Mr. Sterling, I have pressing matters. My team's collecting me this afternoon. Thank you for your hospitality."

William looked startled, then clapped Preston's shoulder.

"Nonsense! You saved Evelyn—you're family now. Business comes first, but from today, our chef will deliver meals until you've recovered—"

Preston blinked. "That's unnecessary—"

"Nonsense! Visit anytime—consider our home yours."

Preston accepted graciously.

Evelyn massaged her temples. Her father's attitude shift was whiplash-inducing.

She cringed recalling the earlier conversation. Their interest in Preston seemed... clinical.

The Sterlings were the ones with ulterior motives.

'Couldn't they be subtler?' she groaned internally.

Thankfully Preston showed no offense. Otherwise, she'd have dug through the floor.

That afternoon.

Exhausted, William finally went home.

Evelyn nibbled fruit Lucas prepared when Alexander burst in, documents clutched tightly.

His expression was stormy.

Lucas wiped Evelyn's hands, smirking.

"Looks like big brother caught our culprit."
###Chapter 749

Alexander's piercing gaze lowered as he passed the file to Evelyn.

"That scarred man is indeed Lawrence Sinclair's enforcer. His specialty is fabricating accidents at construction sites to delay projects."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her eyes darkened.

Was it any surprise that Lawrence Sinclair treated human lives like pawns in a game?

Lucas slammed his palm against his thigh. "Damn it! He actually dared to target Evie. We can't let him walk away unscathed. Before handing him over to the authorities, we need to make sure he regrets ever crossing us!"

Alexander studied Lucas. His jaw clenched, his expression shadowed with something unreadable.

"I've looked into his background. He's a construction worker. The reason he sold his soul to Lawrence Sinclair? His daughter has cancer. The surgeries she needed were funded by Sinclair's blood money."

Silence swallowed the room.

The Sterlings weren't cruel by nature. They had compassion. But Evelyn, who had nearly lost her life, felt nothing but cold detachment.

Lucas was the first to recover—likely because he'd seen enough dramatic scripts to recognize tragedy when it stared him in the face.

He scoffed, voice dripping with disdain. "So to save his own child, he murders others? What a hypocrite. All those innocent lives—doesn’t he fear karma will come for his daughter next?"

A reason didn’t equate to absolution.

Evelyn pitied the man’s daughter, but that didn’t excuse his crimes.

Especially not when she had just clawed her way back from death’s door.

Compared to a man drenched in blood, wasn’t the survivor the real victim here?

The flicker of sympathy in her chest vanished.

She lifted her chin, meeting Alexander’s eyes. Her voice was ice.

"If he made a deal with the devil, he should burn with him. We don’t have the right to forgive him for the dead. Let the law handle it."

Alexander had never intended to show mercy. No matter the excuse, touching Evelyn meant ruin.

But he’d worried she might hesitate—so he came to her first.

Turns out, she was far more ruthless than he’d anticipated.

Good.

"Understood. I’ll arrange everything. Don’t worry—we won’t interfere, but we won’t lift a finger to help him either."

That was their line.

No Sterling would pay for his daughter’s treatment.

Nor would they sink low enough to target an innocent child.

Evelyn nodded. Alexander ruffled her hair before turning to Lucas. "I’m heading back to the office. Call if you need anything."

Lucas fumed. He’d already plotted a dozen ways to make the bastard suffer—only to be thwarted by reason.

That criminal was getting off too easy.

Silence settled again.

Noticing Evelyn’s mood, Lucas brightened. "Hey, I could set up a projector in here! We could binge movies. Or—better yet—install a karaoke machine!"

Evelyn stared at him, incredulous. Is he planning to move in permanently?

She pulled the blanket over her head with a sigh. "Lucas, I need rest. Go… entertain yourself somewhere else."

Ungrateful! Lucas huffed.

He stormed out, muttering. Plenty of people would kill for my company. Evie has no idea how lucky she is.
###Chapter 750

The hospital's interior was a masterpiece crafted by renowned international designers.

Every space was immaculate, expansive, and designed for ultimate comfort.

This wasn’t just a hospital—it resembled an exclusive retreat, with controlled access through a single entrance.

The serene ambiance, infused with modern aesthetics, had a calming effect on anyone who stepped inside.

Lucas Sterling moved through the halls, drawing stunned and admiring glances from the medical staff.

As he turned the corner at the end of the corridor, his gaze landed on a lone figure seated on a bamboo chair.

His eyes narrowed. Nathan Blackwood?

Lucas approached slowly. Nathan sat there, his posture radiating desolation.

The sight was jarring.

Nathan had always been the epitome of control, but now, he looked utterly defeated.

It wasn’t hard to guess why.

Evelyn Sinclair—once his wife—now had Preston Sinclair by her side.

And if William Sterling’s approval of Preston was any indication, their reunion seemed inevitable.

Nathan lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes meeting Lucas’s.

“What a coincidence, Mr. Blackwood,” Lucas said, though his smirk faltered slightly.

Nathan’s state was alarming.

Dark circles shadowed his eyes, his face gaunt, as if he hadn’t slept in days.

Lucas had never seen him like this.

The urge to mock him faded.

Nathan’s voice was rough when he finally spoke. “How is she?”

Of course. He was here for Evelyn.

Lucas exhaled and took a seat beside him.

“Better. She can’t walk yet, but everything else is manageable. Don’t worry too much.”

Nathan’s fingers twitched. He stared blankly ahead, silent.

Lucas arched a brow. “Aren’t you going in to see her?”

This hesitation was unlike Nathan.

Nathan stiffened.

Of course he wanted to see her. He’d rushed here the moment he could.

But when he reached her door, he froze.

An unfamiliar dread coiled in his chest.

Especially after learning Preston shared Evelyn’s blood type—something that twisted like a knife in his gut.

He couldn’t face her.

After a long pause, Nathan finally spoke, his voice hollow.

“Not today.”

He stood abruptly, ready to leave.

Lucas scoffed.

“You’re running away, aren’t you?” His tone sharpened. “For three years, you used my sister’s blood to save your mistress. Now, when Evelyn nearly bled to death, it was Preston who saved her—the man who’s always loved her.”

Nathan’s entire body went rigid.

His expression darkened, a storm brewing in his gaze as he turned back.

“Lucas—”

But Lucas wasn’t finished.

Every word was a blade.

“Do you know how precious her blood is? Do you know why every sharp edge in our home is padded? Why she’s never held a fruit knife in her life?”

His lips curled into a bitter smile.

“She risked everything for you. And all you did was take.”

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

“That’s not true.”

His voice was raw, like gravel scraping against stone.

But the weight of his guilt was suffocating.
###Chapter 751

Lucas's words cut deep, sharp as a blade.

He was striking Nathan where it hurt most. The more Nathan tried to bury the past, the more Lucas dragged it back into the light.

If Nathan wanted a fresh start with Evelyn, he had to face what he'd done. There would be no easy absolution.

Lucas studied Nathan with cold detachment. He wanted to crush him, but the man looked pitiful—like a stray dog in the rain.

Pathetic.

"You've helped Evelyn enough times that she can't bring herself to cut you off completely," Lucas said. "But mark my words—if she chooses Preston, stay away. Mr. Blackwood, you owe her that much respect."

Nathan's jaw clenched. His expression darkened, eyes heavy with something unreadable.

"That day will never come."

Lucas scoffed. So confident?

Nathan straightened, resolve hardening in his gaze. "I'm going to see her. Even if she slaps me, I'll take it."

Lucas's words hadn't broken him—they'd ignited him.

If Preston Sinclair thinks he can have Evelyn, he's delusional. Since when do I retreat? Since when is Preston worthy of touching what's mine?

Nathan turned, his back rigid with determination.

Lucas rolled his eyes. Did he just call me 'Third Brother'? Unbelievable.

Nathan strode toward Evelyn's room, his steps purposeful.

Then he saw him.

Preston Sinclair, stepping out of Evelyn's ward.

Nathan froze. The air around him thickened with menace.

Preston smiled, sickly pale but composed. "Mr. Blackwood. You're later than I expected."

Nathan's voice was ice. "I warned you to stay away from her."

Preston's tone remained gentle, but his eyes sharpened. "If I stayed away, would she still be alive? I saved her. I gave her my blood. How could I leave?"

Nathan moved before he could think. He seized Preston by the collar and slammed him against the wall.

"You think you're worthy?" Nathan snarled. "How are those overseas investments? House in order yet? Do you really think I won't kill you?"

The tension between them crackled, two predators circling.

Nathan was fury incarnate—untouchable, unstoppable.

Preston, usually so mild in Evelyn's presence, let his mask slip. His smile turned lethal.

"Mr. Blackwood, I know you excel at playing dirty. But I won't let her go. You had her once. Did you ever deserve her?"
###Chapter 752

Nathan's pupils contracted violently as Preston chuckled.

"Mr. Blackwood, she's resting inside. You'd better not disturb her."

It was a direct hit to the most vulnerable spot. Nathan had one glaring weakness—Evelyn.

Preston knew full well Nathan had never let go of Evelyn. So he deliberately dredged up their painful past, hammering home the fact that Nathan didn't deserve her.

Preston prided himself on being a gentleman, but in the cutthroat world of business, chivalry was nothing more than a luxury afforded by those at the very top.

He had clawed his way up from the depths of Wall Street. There was nothing he hadn't seen, nothing he couldn't handle.

Nathan's earlier ambush had caught him off guard. But if Nathan wanted another round, Preston was more than ready to retaliate—properly this time.

The taunt ignited something dark in Nathan. Without hesitation, his fist connected with Preston's face. "Who the hell do you think you are?"

Preston crumpled to the floor.

Blood loss had left him weak. The brutal punch sent his vision swimming, his body teetering on the edge of consciousness. He was already at his limit.

A passing nurse shrieked at the sight.

Preston lay gasping, his breaths shallow and uneven.

The door across the hall swung open. Evelyn appeared in her wheelchair, her expression shifting from shock to fury in an instant. "Nathan Blackwood!"

Nathan's fist froze mid-air. The air thickened with tension.

Doctors and nurses swarmed around Preston. His face was ghostly pale, blood smeared across his lips, his usual composed demeanor shattered. He looked fragile—like a gust of wind could snuff him out.

No one dared intervene. Not after hearing the name Evelyn had just screamed.

Nathan Blackwood.

Nathan straightened slowly, his dark eyes locking onto Evelyn. The crimson in his irises hadn't faded, the storm within them still raging.

He saw it all—the shock, the anger, the disgust. All of it directed at him.

It felt like a jagged hook had ripped through his chest, leaving behind a gaping, bloody wound.

Evelyn wheeled herself forward, bypassing Nathan entirely. Her gaze was fixed on Preston, now being stabilized by the medical team.

"How is he?"

The doctor didn’t dare move Preston too much. His tone was grave.

"Severe blood loss prior to this incident. The punch likely caused a concussion. We’ll need further tests to assess potential brain complications from oxygen deprivation."

He turned to a nurse, voice low. "Prep the stretcher and imaging suite. Minimal movement."

Within seconds, the stretcher arrived.

Preston lay motionless, his lips colorless, his handsome features alarmingly fragile. One wrong move, and he might slip away entirely.

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

A single punch shouldn’t have done this. But he’d given too much—for her.

She knew that weakness intimately. The dizziness, the exhaustion, the way the world tilted beneath your feet.

And now, Preston was paying the price.

The medical team whisked him away, leaving Evelyn and Nathan alone.

When their eyes met, the unspoken tension between them thickened.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her voice icy. "Why are you here?"

Nathan opened his mouth—

But she cut him off with a bitter laugh. "Oh, right. To assault people."
###Chapter 753

Between Nathan and Preston, Evelyn had unknowingly aligned herself with the weaker side.

The blood donation had dredged up painful memories she'd rather forget.

Nathan was the last person Evelyn wanted to see right now. Yet here he was.

Not only had he shown up uninvited, but he'd also attacked Preston—the man who had just saved her life.

Evelyn marveled at her own restraint. If not for her broken leg, she would have kicked Nathan straight into the afterlife.

The frustration burned inside her, with no outlet for release.

Nathan lowered his gaze, studying her for a long moment before finally looking away. His eyes darkened as they landed on her cast.

His voice was rough, strained. "I came to see you. And I don’t need a reason to hit him."

The sheer arrogance in his tone made Evelyn’s blood boil.

This man’s audacity knew no bounds.

Then, without warning, Nathan dropped to one knee in front of her. His large hand hovered over her injured leg, barely touching the cast.

"Does it hurt?"

The pain in his voice was raw, his eyes shadowed with something unreadable.

Evelyn stayed silent. What kind of question was that?

Nathan didn’t seem to care. "It must. When my leg was broken, the pain kept me awake for days. You must be suffering the same."

His words were like needles piercing her heart, reopening old wounds.

Because Nathan had once sacrificed himself for her too. He had nearly died saving her.

The anger inside her flickered, then dimmed.

Fine. Even if he hurt me the most, he also saved me. Maybe that balances the scales.

What’s the point of holding onto the past?

Still, she scoffed. "Mr. Blackwood, are you trying to remind me I owe you gratitude?"

Nathan blinked, then smirked. "If that’s how you want to take it."

Preston had been trying to erase Nathan from Evelyn’s life. But that was never going to happen.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "Then why did you hit him?"

Nathan’s eyes burned with something dangerous. "Because I wanted to. He deserved it."

He wouldn’t elaborate. The mere thought of Preston having feelings for Evelyn made him sick.

Then, abruptly, Nathan’s expression shifted. His gaze turned almost feverish.

"Your blood type is rare. I’ll have Vanessa Holloway monitored. She’ll donate regularly—so you’ll never run out."

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "It was always yours to begin with."

Evelyn’s fingers dug into the wheelchair, her knuckles turning white.

Nathan knew everything. He knew why Preston was here. He knew how she’d survived.

Of course he did.

And now he was cutting Preston out of the equation entirely.

Blood? Vanessa’s blood was wasted on her anyway. Might as well give it all back to Evelyn.

Once, Nathan had pitied Vanessa for Hendrick’s misplaced devotion. But after everything she’d done, that sympathy had vanished.

To him, Vanessa was nothing more than a vessel carrying Evelyn’s stolen blood.

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

"No," she said sharply. "The thought of my blood inside her disgusts me."
###Chapter 754

Evelyn's words cut through Nathan like a blade.

She wasn't just disgusted by Vanessa Holloway—she was repulsed by their entire three-year marriage.

For a moment, Nathan's expression darkened. His lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze heavy as it bore into her.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, inhaling sharply. She clenched her trembling fingers and spoke, her voice icy.

"Nathan Blackwood, don't bring up the past. And I never want to hear Vanessa Holloway's name again."

"Changing from a blood donor to someone who forces others to donate isn't something to be proud of. My blood type is rare, but not rare enough to justify blackmail. I still have my dignity."

Her lips curled into a mocking smile. Then, she pressed the button on her wheelchair and backed away.

"I'm going to rest. Mr. Blackwood, I'd heal faster if I didn’t have to see you again."

She turned and wheeled into her room without a backward glance, not caring how stormy Nathan’s expression had become.

All she wanted was for him to stay far away. The farther, the better.

Maybe then she’d recover sooner.

Evelyn didn’t know why Nathan had punched Preston, but hitting a patient was inexcusable. At some point, he left.

Not long after, the doctor arrived with an update.

"Mr. Sinclair lost a significant amount of blood, leading to temporary oxygen deprivation in the brain. Fortunately, there’s no permanent damage, but he’s still unconscious."

Evelyn closed the magazine in her lap and nodded. "Let me know when he wakes up."

She couldn’t pretend this hadn’t happened.

The doctor noted her vitals before leaving.

Evelyn rubbed her temples, about to lie down, when footsteps echoed outside her door.

She was the only patient on this floor.

She didn’t need to guess who was coming.

Frowning, she made a mental note to request a Do Not Disturb sign.

Before she could dwell on it, the door swung open.

"Evie, look who’s here!"

Lucas’s excited shout shattered her drowsiness.

Evelyn blinked, sitting up to see Natalie, Isabella, and Sebastian standing in the doorway.

Isabella rushed over, pulling her into a tight hug, her eyes scanning Evelyn with concern.

"Nikki, you scared us half to death!"

Natalie gave her a once-over, relieved to see only the cast on her leg.

"Thank God you’re okay! We nearly had a heart attack when we heard about the accident."

Sebastian stepped forward, his eyes suspiciously red, though his voice was steady.

"Evie, how many times have you ended up in a hospital bed? You and hospitals have some twisted relationship."

Evelyn laughed, pushing away the lingering anger from earlier.

"It’s nothing. I’m fine now!"

Lucas sidled up beside her, knocking on her cast with a grin, trying to reassure Natalie.

"See? Doesn’t even hurt!"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. She stared at him, speechless. Is he really my brother? I’m starting to doubt it.

She wouldn’t be surprised if Natalie asked Lucas to change his last name and he did it without hesitation.

Isabella shoved him away. "Lucas! She’s injured—stop poking her!"

Natalie shot him a sidelong glare but said nothing.

Sebastian looked like he wanted to scold him too but held back.

Seeing everyone turn against Lucas, Evelyn finally felt a little better.
###Chapter 755

Everyone demanded to know the full story of what had happened.

Evelyn Sinclair sighed. She knew they wouldn't leave until their curiosity was satisfied.

Reluctantly, she recounted everything.

As they listened, their faces paled with fear. At least Evelyn was safe now.

Isabella Montgomery clasped her hands together. "Thank goodness for Preston! We have to thank him properly!"

Natalie Beaumont nodded. "Absolutely. No matter what his feelings are toward you, he saved your life. That deserves gratitude—but keep your guard up about everything else."

Isabella blinked. "What do you mean?"

Natalie rolled her eyes. "The romantic implications, obviously!"

Anyone with eyes could see Preston Sinclair’s attentiveness toward Evelyn went beyond mere friendship.

But if he tried to use this situation as leverage, it would reveal his true character—manipulative and controlling.

Sebastian Hart sighed dramatically. "We were so close back then. And we still are now—"

Evelyn groaned and covered her ears.

"You're all overthinking this. He didn’t even bring it up. Mr. Sinclair isn’t the type to exploit someone in distress."

Isabella and Natalie exchanged skeptical glances.

Lucas Sterling smirked and signaled for someone to bring in a table.

Evelyn, who had been dozing off, jolted awake.

She squinted. "What’s this?"

Lucas grinned at Natalie. "Just talking is boring. Let’s play some games while we chat!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "I can barely move right now."

Lucas waved her off. "We’re not including you. The four of us can manage just fine without you."

Evelyn stared, baffled.

The room was spacious enough for them to set up comfortably.

Since it wasn’t often they were all together, no one wanted to leave just yet.

Without hesitation, they gathered around the table and started dealing cards.

Evelyn shook her head in disbelief. So much for letting me rest. Who plays poker in a hospital room?

As the four of them laughed over their game, Evelyn turned on a variety show to pass the time.

Coincidentally, it was the one she and Vivian Lockwood had produced.

Adrian Blackwood was the guest star for that episode.

Since launching his acting career, Adrian had skyrocketed to fame—his easygoing charm and the backing of the Blackwood family made him a fan favorite.

His presence alone had boosted the show’s ratings significantly.

Before she knew it, the day slipped away.

Outside, the sky darkened, the evening sun painting the horizon in deep oranges. The remnants of snow on the branches looked almost melancholic.

Just as Evelyn lost herself in the show, a knock sounded at the door.

The doctor entered—and froze at the sight of the crowded room and the poker table.

Evelyn chuckled. "Doctor, is Mr. Sinclair awake?"

It took the doctor a moment to recover.

"Yes, Ms. Sterling. He’s conscious, but he needs complete rest—"

Preston had only woken near dusk, which meant Nathan Blackwood’s punch had been devastating.

Evelyn cursed Nathan under her breath before smiling politely. "Understood. I’ll go see him."

She glanced at Lucas. The siblings had always shared an unspoken understanding.

Lucas lifted her into the wheelchair and pushed her out, the others trailing behind.

Isabella piped up. "We won’t make a sound. We just want to thank him for saving Evelyn!"

Natalie and Sebastian nodded in agreement.

The doctor hesitated before reluctantly conceding.

"Fine."
###Chapter 756

The group descended the stairs with barely contained excitement. Their footsteps automatically softened as they approached Preston Sinclair's private ward.

Evelyn's wheelchair moved soundlessly. Only the rhythmic beeping of medical monitors broke the silence.

Preston appeared peaceful in sleep, his complexion significantly improved from earlier. A healthy flush had replaced his previous pallor.

Five figures and one doctor formed a tight circle around the hospital bed, studying the sleeping tycoon with intense focus.

Their unblinking stares seemed to search for something invisible.

Isabella, Natalie, and Sebastian exchanged silent glances, mentally debating Preston's attractiveness compared to Nathan Blackwood.

While lacking Nathan's striking features, Preston's gentle demeanor gave him an undeniable charm that balanced the scales.

They communicated through subtle facial expressions, careful not to disturb the patient.

Preston's eyelids fluttered suddenly.

The room collectively held its breath.

A flicker of alarm crossed Preston's features as he awoke. His body tensed visibly.

The unexpected reaction froze everyone in place. Isabella, Natalie, and Sebastian bowed deeply in unison.

Evelyn and the doctor exchanged startled looks.

"Thank you, Mr. Sinclair, for saving Evelyn!" the trio chorused.

Confusion clouded Preston's sleep-fogged eyes. His face drained of color as his lips pressed into a thin line.

The shock was unmistakable.

Evelyn cleared her throat sharply. "Lower your voices!" she hissed. "You're frightening him!"

At her words, Preston's tension visibly eased. Recognition dawned in his eyes.

"Evelyn?" His voice emerged rough but warm.

She met his gaze with a genuine smile. "Mr. Sinclair, these are my friends - Isabella, Natalie, and Sebastian."

Preston managed a weak smile. "Hello..."

Natalie spoke quickly. "We came to thank you properly, Mr. Sinclair. We'll leave you to rest now. Dinner's on us when you recover!"

Isabella nodded agreement.

With synchronized movements, the trio retreated toward the exit, moving with exaggerated care.

Preston blinked in bewilderment.

The doctor exhaled in relief as the door closed behind them.

Evelyn started to follow when Preston's fingers twitched. His gaze locked onto her.

"Were you worried about me?" His voice carried a melodic tenderness.

Her breath caught. The unspoken answer hung between them - obvious yet dangerous.

The doctor took the hint and discreetly exited.

Alone now, Evelyn couldn't avoid the question. Preston had nearly died for her.

She met his eyes with deliberate calm. "Everyone was concerned when you collapsed."

Disappointment shadowed Preston's face. "You're still keeping me at arm's length."

The observation struck true. Evelyn stiffened momentarily before offering a sincere smile.

"Alright. Yes, I was very worried about you, Mr. Sinclair."
###Chapter 757

Evelyn's concern was genuine.

Her worry for Preston came from a place of sincerity.

This realization made her reflect on her previous prejudice against him.

She had always treated all her suitors with cold indifference.

It was a defense mechanism against the unknown.

But with Preston, it felt pointless.

That car accident had subtly shifted their relationship.

Yet she couldn't quite define what had changed.

Preston was determined to break down the walls between them. It wasn't easy, but he refused to give up.

He wanted more with her. He wanted to take the lead.

So he noticed every slight change in Evelyn's attitude toward him.

Hearing her concern, Preston felt a pang of bittersweet emotion, but he managed a smile. "Then getting hurt was worth it."

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly. Preston continued, "Did Mr. Blackwood tell you why he punched me?"

He was curious what Nathan would say to her. Evelyn shook her head. "No."

'Who knows?' She couldn't tell Preston that Nathan had said "he deserved it," so she stayed silent.

Preston smirked, a hint of smugness in his expression. "Because he's jealous of me!"

For the first time, Preston was glad he got punched. Nathan's irritation made him feel hopeful.

Evelyn froze as Preston's smile deepened. His gaze was intense as he looked at her.

"For the first time, I feel useful to you. And this time, I'm closer to you than Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn looked up and was instantly drawn into Preston's dark, endless eyes—like staring into the cosmos.

His voice was warm. He wanted to share more of himself with her.

"Since I was a child, I avoided any risk because of my blood type. I learned to be selfish and detached—because one wrong move could mean I wouldn't survive."

"This time, I'm grateful for this blood type. Evelyn, don't rush to thank me. I won't stoop to emotional blackmail to make you commit to me. I just want you to be fair—don't push me away with a simple 'thank you.'"

For a moment, Evelyn's heart trembled. A part of her began to soften.

The icy walls she had built had been hurting Preston.

She had thanked him countless times, afraid he would use his feelings to trap her. But now, he outright said he wouldn't.

Instead of relief, Evelyn felt heavier.

"Mr. Sinclair, you must know what happened between me and Mr. Blackwood—it's all over the internet. I poured everything into loving him, and now I'm exhausted. Even if I like someone in the future, I won't love like that again. It wouldn't be fair."

Her words were blunt.

Evelyn wouldn't be a moth to a flame again.

She still believed in love's beauty—but she wouldn't burn herself alive to feel it. That kind of sacrifice only destroyed her.

Preston was different. He raised a child that wasn't his. Outwardly, he seemed calculating, but deep down, he was kind and generous.

Evelyn couldn't bear to hurt him.

Preston studied the faint smile on her lips, then lowered his gaze briefly before meeting her eyes again.

"Don't decide so soon. How will you know if you don't try?"

Evelyn frowned. Preston pressed on, "And how do you know the other person won't accept the imbalance? What if he’s willing?"
###Chapter 758

Preston's message was crystal clear.

He was willing to endure this injustice. If Evelyn held even the slightest affection for him, his unrequited love wouldn't be in vain.

But Evelyn wasn't like other women.

Even if Preston poured a hundred times more effort into her, she wouldn't necessarily soften. She was urging him to move on, yet he couldn't.

The hospital room was so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Evelyn's chest tightened as if a boulder pressed against her heart. Breathing became an unexpected struggle.

Watching her torn expression as she searched for the right words, Preston suddenly laughed.

He hated putting her in this position.

"How about this?" he offered. "Repay me with one condition."

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet his.

Preston's lips curved slightly. "Promise me you won't push me out of your life. Don't reject my affection. If you ever feel uncomfortable, tell me. But if you feel even a flicker of something more—you have to tell me that too."

They could try this, whatever the outcome.

Preston would accept it, no matter what.

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before nodding. "Okay."

This time, she wasn't just humoring him.

For the first time, she considered that maybe dating wasn't off the table.

Preston had given her space, no pressure—just an open door.

Evelyn wasn't planning to stay single forever. Was she really supposed to never love anyone but Nathan?

No. She just hadn't met the right person yet.

A slow smile spread across Preston's face, the shadows in his eyes lifting like morning mist. He was elegance and warmth, charm and nobility wrapped into one.

The fact that she hadn't refused was progress enough.

Evelyn couldn't handle the intensity of his gaze any longer and fled.

Back in her own room, she found it empty except for Lucas lounging on the bed, flipping through a quarterly report from Dominic Kingsley.

He arched a brow as she entered. "What took so long?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why didn’t you escort your goddess home, huh?"

It wasn’t like Lucas to pass up a chance to fawn over Natalie.

He sighed dramatically and tossed the report aside.

"I had to stay and keep my dear sister company, of course—"

"Right."

Evelyn scoffed.

More likely, Natalie had refused his chivalrous offer.

The next day, Preston was discharged. He bid Evelyn farewell and returned to his hotel to handle business.

After all, he was a Wall Street prodigy who made millions by the minute. Even without physical assets, his influence in venture capital was undeniable.

Evelyn spent the next few days in peaceful recovery. Aside from her healing leg, she was nearly back to full health.

Only recently had Bennett started bringing documents that required her immediate attention.

Seated in her wheelchair, she watched snowflakes drift past the window as Bennett updated her on the latest project developments.

Everything was progressing smoothly.

"Any updates from Sandford?"

After all this time, there should be movement.

Bennett hesitated, lips pressed tight. "Chairman Sterling said not to disturb your rest with trivial matters—"

Evelyn shot him an unamused look. "Bennett. Are you going to tell me or not?"

He sighed. "There’s concrete evidence against the hit-and-run suspect. He killed three construction workers. At first, he refused to talk, but he confessed later. Rumor has it someone anonymously submitted evidence to the court."

Evelyn smirked. "Who’s feeling so generous?"

"Mr. Blackwood."

Her smile froze, then faded. "Go on."
###Chapter 759

Bennett studied Evelyn's expression carefully before continuing.

"The killer's wife and their terminally ill daughter have been causing scenes at Zenith Corp's headquarters."

His jaw tightened.

"They refuse to leave. The wife claims we ruined their lives by imprisoning her husband, leaving them destitute."

Her voice dripped with ice. "They have the audacity to demand compensation from us?"

Disgust twisted her features.

"The murderer plays victim while his family extorts money at our doorstep?"

Bennett exhaled sharply. "Employees can barely enter the building without attracting crowds. Security's hands are tied."

He rubbed his temple.

"Jonathan Reeves gave them twenty grand to leave, but it backfired. Now they return daily, smelling blood."

A muscle ticked in Evelyn's jaw.

"This circus jeopardizes the entire Pacific Heights Project. If rumors spread, we risk losing everything."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She'd nearly died that night—how dare they demand reparations?

Money meant nothing to her, but she'd burn it all before rewarding extortion.

"Police involvement?"

Bennett nodded grimly. "Multiple reports filed. But with the trial pending and a cancer-stricken child involved..."

His mouth flattened.

"Authorities issued warnings, nothing more. Leonard Whitmore warned public backlash could sink Sandford's development plans."

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "Convenient how responsibility always lands in our lap."

Legal boundaries shackled their options. One misstep would cost them the project.

These parasites knew it.

She inhaled sharply. "Alexander's solution?"

"Postponing groundbreaking until..." Bennett hesitated. "The daughter's prognosis gives her three months max. Once sentencing occurs, public sentiment shifts in our favor."

Currently, any confrontation risked painting Sterling Enterprises as heartless tycoons crushing desperate widows.

Alexander's patience was strategic.

Evelyn's gaze turned calculating. "Project launch date?"

"Seven days."

Her mind raced through scenarios, discarding options until—

A cold smile curved her lips.

"Schedule a media conference for opening day. Sandford's been waiting years for this development."

Her eyes gleamed with lethal clarity.

"Let's give those vultures the spotlight they crave."
###Chapter 760

Evelyn's words sent Bennett's pulse racing.

It was a bold gamble—risky yet thrilling. Playing the public sympathy card could easily backfire.

History was littered with such disasters.

Bennett frowned. "Public opinion might turn against us."

Evelyn toyed with the button on her wheelchair, her lips curving into a knowing smile.

"Of course, it's not that simple. If that killer was willing to murder for his daughter, why wouldn't he do one last good deed for her?"

Bennett's expression darkened. "Ms. Sinclair, I don’t follow. His execution is practically guaranteed. He failed to kill you—that’s the only reason he’s behind bars now. He despises us. How could we possibly sway him?"

The man was the type to burn the world down with him.

Evelyn’s smirk sharpened.

"Show him photos of his wife and daughter outside Zenith Corp. The more heartbreaking, the better. I want his wife to publicly confess his crimes on the project’s launch day. In exchange, I’ll cover his daughter’s medical expenses—for life."

Bennett stiffened. Her words hit like a shot of adrenaline, electrifying his nerves.

Unbelievable.

At the brink of disaster, Evelyn had pivoted the entire situation.

Money was nothing to her, but she refused to let it be wasted on silent extortion.

Every cent had to serve a purpose—multiplying its value a hundredfold.

"Can you handle this?"

Evelyn tilted her head, her gaze steady.

"If not, I’ll find someone else."

Bennett straightened, resolve hardening his voice. "I can."

A fierce energy surged through him. He’d clawed his way to this position, surviving corporate warfare under Alexander’s ruthless tutelage.

Backstabbing, deception—he’d navigated it all, always on edge.

But with Evelyn, battles were fought head-on. No matter the odds, she never flinched.

He thrived beside her—not because she was a woman, but because of the relentless drive she embodied.

Evelyn nodded. She trusted his capability. Negotiating with a desperate man was child’s play compared to boardroom warfare.

Alexander’s protégé wouldn’t fail at this.

"Then I’ll expect good news."

Bennett left, the fire in his chest blazing.

Once alone, Evelyn called Alexander.

She outlined her plan. He was, after all, leading the operation.

A dry chuckle crackled through the line.

"You’ve already decided. Why bother consulting me?"

Evelyn paused, then huffed. "Big Brother, delaying the project means massive losses!"

"I told you to rest. Did Bennett talk too much?"

He shouldn’t have disturbed her recovery.

"I pried it out of him. He refused to say a word—"

Alexander scoffed. Unlikely.

Since joining Evelyn, Bennett had adopted her stubbornness.

A sigh followed, laced with reluctant admiration.

"Clever plan. But funding that girl’s treatment? Wasteful."
###Chapter 761

The killer had targeted Evelyn for his daughter's sake. She'd only survived by sheer luck.

What if she hadn't escaped in time?

What if Preston hadn't arrived when he did?

Alexander refused to waste a single cent on the murderer's family. Evelyn stayed silent for a moment, touched by their protectiveness.

Under normal circumstances, Alexander would have thrown money at the problem.

The killer's wife had a weakness for cash. Charging her with extortion would have landed her behind bars too.

But Alexander hadn't done it out of spite. Evelyn pressed her lips together, her bright eyes dimming slightly.

"Alex, this money will improve our public image and secure the Sandford project. It's worth it."

She was still a businesswoman who could weigh pros and cons in seconds.

A few million meant nothing to them.

Alexander knew her mind was made up. "Fine. We'll do it your way. But one condition—you don't leave this hospital. Let others handle everything else."

Evelyn smiled.

"Of course. I don’t plan on being a cripple."

Alexander chuckled. They discussed family matters before ending the call.

Not long after, a knock sounded at the door.

Assuming it was the doctor, Evelyn didn’t look up. "Come in."

A round-faced man beamed at her.

"Ms. Sinclair! It's been ages! I've missed you so much!"

Evelyn stiffened. "Theodore?"

Nathan’s cousin.

Why was he here?

Theodore had gained weight, his eyes nearly disappearing when he smiled. But it didn’t slow him down.

He efficiently arranged the dishes he’d brought on the side table.

"I heard you were sick. I had to see you—for old times' sake!"

Evelyn forced a polite smile, hiding her confusion.

Since when were they close enough for "old times' sake"?

Theodore handed her a fork. "Homemade, low-fat, nutrient-packed. Perfect for recovery. Try it!"

Evelyn arched a brow. She trusted his cooking. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have stayed at Highland Estates so long when Nathan was injured.

Theodore had a knack for understanding women’s tastes. His meals were never greasy, always flavorful.

Despite her surprise, the spread made her stomach growl.

She took a bite of ravioli. The burst of flavor made her sigh in pleasure.

Her mood lifted instantly. She gestured to the chair opposite her.

"Sit."

Theodore didn’t hesitate. He slid on gloves and sliced into the crispy roasted beef.

He sighed dramatically.

"Mr. Blackwood hasn’t slept properly in days. Sometimes he just passes out at his desk. Breaks my heart."

Ah. So that was his real purpose—playing sympathy card for Nathan.

Evelyn frowned. "He’s making millions per minute. Why should you feel bad for him?"

A butler earning five figures worrying over a billionaire?

Theodore froze.

He choked on his next words.
###Chapter 762

Theodore's mouth opened, then closed without a sound.

Several seconds ticked by in silence.

When he finally regained composure, he remembered his mission. "Mr. Blackwood isn't doing this for money, Ms. Sinclair. It's all for you!"

Evelyn's crystal-clear eyes widened momentarily. The purpose of Theodore's visit became clear.

She chose not to call him out. Instead, she simply smiled and continued eating her meal.

Seeing her lack of response, Theodore pressed on. "When Mr. Blackwood discovered your identity, he didn't sleep for two straight days. He rushed to Sandford like a madman the moment he got the news." His voice dropped. "But when he returned... he was a completely different man."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. A barely perceptible tremor ran through her.

That day when she woke up, Nathan hadn't been there.

Could he really have gone to Sandford?

Theodore continued, "Then he came here once. After returning home, he collapsed from exhaustion. The moment he felt slightly better, he buried himself in work again." He hesitated. "Truth is... he wants to see you. But when I suggested it, he said..." A pause. "You wouldn't want to see him."

He stole a glance at Evelyn.

She chewed slowly, her expression serene. Even while eating, she exuded effortless elegance.

Theodore frowned. Why wasn't Ms. Sinclair showing any concern? He'd poured his heart out!

Setting his jaw, he pressed forward. "I've never seen Mr. Blackwood so... broken. Like he lost his soul." He sighed dramatically. "If a man like him ever looked at me that way, I could die happy!"

Evelyn couldn't suppress a chuckle. Amusement sparkled in her eyes as she regarded him.

"Theodore, I've always wondered something. Nathan's hiring standards are notoriously high. Harrison graduated top of his class from an Ivy League university - his competence is the only reason Nathan keeps him around." She tilted her head. "You're not a professional butler, yet you've remained by his side all these years. Is it really just because you're Harrison's cousin?"

Her words were diplomatic.

Theodore didn't meet any of Nathan's usual criteria.

Before their divorce, even cooks and housekeepers got fired for failing Nathan's exacting standards. After endless replacements, household chores ultimately fell to Evelyn.

So how did Theodore - unremarkable in both appearance and ability - survive so long?

Unless he possessed some hidden talent?

Theodore blinked, momentarily thrown.

'Obviously because I help Nathan scheme to win you back!'

But he couldn't say that. Betraying Nathan was unthinkable.

Scratching his head, he feigned confusion. "Maybe... I'm just exceptionally good at surviving?"

Evelyn stared, then nodded with a faint smile. "Yes. That must be it."

'Who does he think he's fooling?' she thought. But she had little interest in probing further about Nathan's staff.

Theodore brightened and launched into tales of his culinary prowess, completely unaware Evelyn had derailed his "poor Nathan" narrative.

After the meal, Theodore efficiently cleaned until not a crumb remained. His professionalism was undeniable.

As he prepared to leave, still rambling about perfecting his cooking skills in college cafeterias, Evelyn's tired expression forced him to gather the trash and go.

Only when he reached the lobby did realization strike. 'Wait - I spent the whole time talking about myself! What about Nathan's situation?'
###Chapter 763

Theodore's steps faltered as realization struck him like a physical blow. This entire hospital visit had been a colossal waste of time.

His head hung low as he approached the exit, only to freeze mid-step. A familiar figure was walking through the automatic doors.

The man carried himself with effortless grace - tall, impeccably dressed, exuding quiet confidence beneath his polished exterior. That carefully cultivated aura of approachability couldn't mask the aristocratic bearing beneath.

Theodore's breath caught. Preston Sinclair.

Wall Street's golden boy. The charming, six-foot-two, broad-shouldered hypocrite who smiled like a saint while playing chess with people's lives.

His pulse spiked. Every instinct screamed to turn back, to warn Evelyn. But professionalism won out.

As Nathan Blackwood's representative, Theodore couldn't afford to make Evelyn despise his employer further.

He bolted straight for Blackwood Industries.

Nathan had been a walking storm cloud lately. His temper turned boardrooms into minefields.

Employees tiptoed around, baffled by the CEO's abrupt personality shift. Even Harrison, Nathan's most trusted lieutenant, avoided unnecessary contact.

Theodore burst in, gasping for air. Harrison arched an eyebrow. "You look like hell."

"Is Mr. Blackwood in?" Theodore jabbed a finger toward the corner office.

Harrison's curt nod was all the confirmation he needed.

The knock echoed sharply.

That familiar baritone growled "Enter," and Theodore pushed through.

"Sir, I've returned."

Nathan's obsidian eyes lifted from his paperwork. "How is she?"

Had Evelyn not barred him from visiting, Nathan would have camped outside her hospital room. But forcing his presence would only hinder her recovery and deepen the rift between them.

Each day without seeing her felt like slow torture. The pent-up frustration had nowhere to go but down the corporate food chain.

Fortunately, incompetent executives made convenient punching bags.

Theodore cleared his throat. "Ms. Sinclair's recovering well. The doctors have strict visitor protocols due to her condition." A diplomatic lie - Nathan wasn't the only one being turned away.

Nathan's pen hit the desk with a sharp crack. "Incompetents get turned away. You saw her."

Theodore swallowed. No fooling this man.

Then inspiration struck. His grin stretched ear to ear. "Sir, I know how to expose Preston Sinclair's true nature."

Nathan's gaze turned predatory. Just hearing that name made his jaw clench.

'Should've broken his neck when I had the chance.'

Theodore leaned in. "A man like Sinclair? Venture capital's most eligible bachelor? There must be skeletons in his closet. The mother of his child. Ex-lovers. Family-approved fiancées." His voice dropped. "If we flood Evelyn's feeds with his scandals..."

Nathan stilled. His fingers tightened around the pen.

The idea had merit.

Previously, Nathan had relied on brute financial force to crush Preston. Minimal effect.

But a man with an illegitimate child couldn't have a spotless past. And Evelyn would never compete for a man already claimed.

Theodore's plan was elegant in its simplicity. A surgical strike where it would hurt most.

Nathan's slow smile told Theodore everything he needed to know. Checkmate.
###Chapter 764

Theodore Winslow had many tricks up his sleeve, but even he had his limits.

Digging up dirt on Preston Sinclair? That was far beyond Theodore's reach.

But for Nathan Blackwood, it wouldn’t be a problem.

Nathan exhaled, the tension leaving his shoulders. He glanced at Theodore. "What does she like to eat? Get the ingredients. I’ll learn to cook it tonight."

As a man determined to change, Nathan held himself to high standards.

A perfect husband should excel in all things—business and home. He wanted to be flawless for Evelyn.

Every improvement was for her.

Theodore stiffened. Mr. Blackwood wants to cook again? Must he destroy another kitchen?

But he couldn’t stop him. Nathan was obsessed with this "perfect husband" persona, refusing to acknowledge his culinary disasters.

Theodore sighed.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood. I’ll prepare everything."

Time to order new kitchenware. Again.

After Theodore left, Nathan called his private investigator in Pacifica and gave quick, precise instructions.

A knock interrupted him. He hung up, lips curving slightly.

The project manager entered, bracing himself for the worst.

"Sir, the delay is confirmed. The audit wasn’t rigorous enough. The timeline’s been pushed back a month."

A month. That disrupted Nathan’s entire schedule.

The last manager had been fired for a week’s delay.

This was four times worse.

Nathan’s gaze turned icy. The manager shuddered.

Silence stretched. The man braced for fury.

Nathan’s voice was low, chilling. "Fine. One month. Don’t let it happen again."

The manager blinked. Am I hallucinating? They said Mr. Blackwood was in a terrible mood today. Did he just… let it go?

"Thank you, sir! I’ll oversee it personally. You won’t be disappointed."

Nathan waved him off. The manager practically floated out of the office.

Harrison, Nathan’s assistant, stared as the man left—smiling. That never happened.

"Harrison, back to work!" The manager adjusted his tie, grinning, and walked off. Harrison was speechless.

Hospital

Evelyn was relieved Theodore had left.

Helpful as he was, his constant chatter gave her a headache.

She reached for her phone to tell Lucas not to bring lunch—when a knock came.

Calm. Precise.

She already knew who it was. "Come in."

Preston Sinclair stepped inside, tall and immaculate, radiating quiet elegance.

There was an innate dignity about him, impossible to ignore.

"Did I wake you?"

Evelyn smiled. "No."

He held a pink food box. "Hungry? My chef is excellent. Care to try?"

She winced apologetically. "I just ate."

Preston paused, then closed the lid.

"Then I won’t torture you."
###Chapter 765

Without warning, Preston Sinclair produced a perfectly round orange from his coat pocket. Its vibrant hue glowed under the sunlight, impossibly tempting.

His gaze softened as he held it out. "For you."

Evelyn Sinclair froze.

She'd received countless extravagant gifts—diamond necklaces, rare antiques, designer handbags worth more than most cars. Yet this simple fruit, its surface gleaming with dewy freshness, struck something deep inside her.

Her pulse quickened.

Something warm unfurled in her chest.

She could already imagine its sweetness before even tasting it.

Evelyn accepted it with practiced grace, ignoring the sudden tightness in her throat. "Where did you get this?"

His lips curved. "An elderly vendor bumped his cart into my car door while I was parking. He looked terrified, so I asked for this as compensation."

That rich, melodic voice of his could melt glaciers.

Evelyn burst out laughing. His understated luxury sedan would cost five figures to repair. And he'd settled for a single orange?

Classic Preston—generous to a fault.

She arched a brow. "This must be the world's most expensive citrus."

"Which is why you should experience its uniqueness firsthand," he countered, that intense stare making her cheeks burn.

Evelyn turned toward the window, feigning interest in the cloudless sky. "I'll eat it later. Just finished lunch."

Preston suddenly remembered something, pulling out his phone. "Oliver's been begging to video call you since Tuesday. Want to see him now?"

Always so considerate. Evelyn nodded eagerly. "Absolutely."

She missed that clever little troublemaker.

The screen soon filled with Oliver Sinclair's cherubic face, his pout dramatic. "Daddy! I miss you! Can I visit?"

Preston remained unmoved. "No."

As if the boy actually missed him.

This was clearly about Evelyn.

Preston knew his son's tricks—if left unchecked, Oliver would monopolize Evelyn's attention while subtly sabotaging his father's chances. Not happening.

Evelyn reached for the phone. "Let me talk to him."

The moment her face appeared, Oliver gasped. "Aunt Evelyn!"

"Been behaving?" she teased.

"Obviously! I just won the International Youth Genius Championship!" Normally humble, Oliver preened under her attention. "Youngest winner ever."

Evelyn showered him with praise until the boy glowed with pride.

Preston scoffed silently. Pathetic. Bragging about some kiddie contest.

Oliver caught the sound and scowled. "Private conversation! Intruders scram!"

Intruder? Preston's eye twitched. I changed your diapers, you ungrateful—

Deep breath.

Next time I'm in San Francisco, that child is getting the sternest talking-to of his life.
###Chapter 766

Preston Sinclair sighed in frustration. He rose from his seat and adjusted his tailored suit.

"Fine, I'll take a walk outside."

Evelyn Sinclair waved at Preston, then turned her attention to little Oliver. She couldn't resist the urge to ruffle his messy curls.

"Oliver, your daddy loves you very much. He'll be sad if you keep pushing him away."

Oliver pouted, thinking, He won't!

"But I wanted to talk to you alone, Pretty Lady!"

Evelyn's heart melted instantly.

How could she scold such an adorable child?

"Alright, let's talk about your daddy then. What do you think are his best qualities?"

Oliver scrunched his nose, struggling with the difficult question.

Does Daddy even have any good qualities? Every time he calls me a good boy, he just piles on more lessons with my tutor. That trick doesn’t work on me anymore! But if I don’t say anything, Pretty Lady will think I’m not a good son. For my reputation, I’ll have to say something nice!

Evelyn smiled, eager to witness this father-son bonding moment.

Oliver pursed his lips, deep in thought.

"Daddy has too many good qualities! He’s handsome, so all the girls like him—but everyone likes me more!"

Evelyn burst into laughter. Even while praising his father, Oliver couldn’t help but compliment himself.

What a little charmer!

"What else?"

Oliver grinned. "He’s super rich and can’t even spend all his money—but I’ll be even richer when I grow up!"

Evelyn nodded approvingly. Such ambition!

"What else?"

Oliver hesitated, then mumbled, "He really likes you."

Evelyn froze, caught off guard.

Oliver’s eyes immediately welled up with tears.

"But I like you more! I’m the one who likes you the most!"

A strange flutter passed through Evelyn’s chest, but seeing Oliver’s watery eyes, it vanished instantly.

She quickly reassured him, "Of course, I like you too! But remember, strong boys don’t cry, okay?"

Oliver’s sniffles stopped abruptly, as if he’d been acting the whole time.

He nodded seriously. "I know. Sophia tells me that too. She’s my nanny. When I grow up, Daddy will be old. No girl likes old men. Everyone loves young, handsome guys like me!"

So, I still have the advantage! Daddy can’t compete with me!

Evelyn giggled. Such innocent confidence!

She didn’t have the heart to tell Oliver that even at eighty, Preston Sinclair would still have women throwing themselves at him.

"Yes, yes, you’re absolutely right!"

Better to let the boy believe in his future glory.

Oliver beamed, thrilled that Evelyn agreed with him.

"Pretty Lady, don’t fall for Daddy’s sweet words. Men can’t be trusted!"

Evelyn laughed helplessly.

Oliver hesitated, then added, "But… Daddy is still better than Mean Mister. Ugh, I’m just too young!"

"Mean Mister" was Nathan Blackwood—Oliver’s nickname for him.

Evelyn paused, then gently said, "When you’re studying abroad, take care of yourself. Learning is important, but enjoying life matters just as much."

She knew Oliver’s intelligence surpassed kids his age. The pressure of competitions weighed on him.

She only wanted him to relax and not push himself too hard.

Oliver nodded solemnly. Pretty Lady still treats me the best!
###Chapter 767

The door swung open as Preston Sinclair stepped into the hospital room, his lips curling into that signature warm smile. "There's an emergency board meeting," he said casually, slipping his phone into his pocket. "I need to head out."

Evelyn Sinclair nodded, waving at little Oliver Sinclair through the video call before handing the device back to Preston. As the screen went dark, she caught a glimpse of his wallpaper—a breathtaking shot of cloudless azure skies.

Typical Preston. No scantily clad models, no pretentious art. Just pure, unfiltered simplicity.

He pocketed his phone, eyes softening as they lingered on her. "Text me your cravings for tomorrow's visit," he offered, already mentally cataloging her favorite pastries.

Evelyn chuckled. "Don't tempt me. I'll empty Manhattan's bakeries."

His fingers twitched—an aborted motion to tuck a stray lock behind her ear. Instead, he spun on his heel and strode out before she could notice the longing in his gaze.

Morning light streamed through the blinds as Evelyn scrolled through urgent emails. The aroma of coffee announced Lucas Sterling's arrival before he even spoke.

"Breakfast is served, Your Highness," he teased, setting down a tray. Then he noticed her furrowed brow. "Since when do you care about tabloid trash?"

Evelyn tilted her iPad toward him. "This 'infamous investor' scandal—do we know him?"

Lucas's smirk was downright feline. "Read between the lines, sis."

She reopened the viral article, skimming past the clickbait headline: Wall Street Wolf Preys on Single Mothers!

The accuser—a self-proclaimed victim—claimed the unnamed tycoon impregnated her before vanishing with their child. Seven years later, she was demanding justice via social media.

The comment section was a bloodbath:

[Name and shame this monster!]

[Typical rich bastard using women as toys!]

[That poor baby! He probably bought off the courts!]

Attached photos showed a blurred-out man towering over the voluptuous plaintiff. Even pixelated, his broad shoulders and tailored suit screamed old money.

Evelyn's nails tapped the screen. "Where's his side of the story?"

Lucas snorted. "Since when do witch hunts need facts?" He flipped open a yogurt lid. "But keep scrolling. The punchline's priceless."

Her breath hitched at the last image—a diamond-encrusted watch glinting on the investor's wrist.

She'd recognize that Patek Philippe anywhere.

It was the same one Nathan Blackwood wore at their divorce hearing.
###Chapter 768

Scandals exposing scumbags online weren't new.

But previous cases usually involved cheating husbands with concrete evidence—bank transfers, photos, chat logs. Netizens would rally behind the wronged wife and tear the man apart.

This one was different.

No proof. No screenshots. Just blurry photos and a woman's wild accusations.

Somehow, it still trended.

Evelyn frowned at the screen. Something felt off. The man's silhouette seemed familiar, but she couldn't place it.

Lucas chuckled, watching her struggle. "Figured it out yet?"

She tossed the tablet aside and reached for her soup. "It's too pixelated."

His smirk deepened.

"Preston Sinclair."

Clang. The spoon hit the floor.

Lucas sighed, bending to retrieve it. "That was my only clean spoon."

Evelyn's breath caught. No wonder he looked familiar.

Her mind rejected the connection at first, but the build matched perfectly. The broad shoulders. The posture.

Impossible.

Her stomach dropped like an anchor.

Lucas returned with a new spoon. "I checked. Normally, platforms verify identities before letting scandals trend. I know the execs—they confirmed it's Preston."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the tablet. "Why target him?"

"Money or revenge. What else?"

She scrolled through the accusations. The alleged ex-girlfriend kept posting, determined to drag him down.

Evelyn's jaw set.

She didn't know Preston well, but she believed in the man who'd saved her life.

The screen blurred as new updates flooded in.

The woman wasn't stopping.

And neither was the storm.
###Chapter 769

Evelyn Sinclair's brows knitted together. "Lucas, could you—"

Before she could finish, Lucas Sterling already knew what she meant. His smile faded slightly.

"You want to control the comments and remove the trending topic?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "No matter the cost, take it down. The internet isn't a flawless place. They can't just claim something is true based on baseless accusations."

"You don't believe this woman's story? But I think at least half of it is plausible—Oliver is around the age she mentioned. Preston Sinclair has been pursuing you relentlessly—"

Wasn't that exactly the kind of obsessive, deep affection the woman had described?

Perhaps Preston Sinclair was truly a hypocrite.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. Her expression settled back into its usual composure.

The corner of her lips curled into a cold smile.

"It's not about whether it's true or whether we believe it. Lucas, he saved my life. And when Kingsley Tech's project went south, with public opinion siding with Pacifica Tech, he helped stabilize the situation. That's why everything resolved so smoothly. Are we just going to stand by and do nothing?"

There was no reason for her to turn a blind eye. In Montecito, Evelyn was probably Preston's only friend.

Preston had little influence in the country—did he really have to clear his name alone?

Even if the accusations were true, they were still friends.

Lucas sighed, understanding her meaning. "Fine. I'll contact the platform to suppress the backlash and release another celebrity scandal. That should divert attention."

Evelyn chuckled. "See? I knew you were capable, Third Brother."

Lucas scoffed. "Don't flatter me now."

He grabbed his phone and stepped out to call the media platform.

Evelyn sat in silence for a moment, lost in thought.

After a while, she picked up her phone, turned it on, then off again.

Her heart was eerily calm.

She didn’t know what she was waiting for—but she also knew, deep down, there would be nothing.

An hour later.

The internet erupted into chaos again. An actress had been caught in bed with a director by his furious wife. The uncensored video spread like wildfire, racking up tens of thousands of reposts in minutes.

The trending topic "Hammer the Scumbag to Death" quietly vanished.

After all, the public was far more invested in celebrity drama than some anonymous "Wall Street tycoon."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Blackwood Industries.

Nathan Blackwood wasn’t surprised by Preston’s scandal. But the Sterlings stepping in to suppress it left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Was Evelyn really that protective of him?

Still, the effect had been achieved. Nathan hadn’t orchestrated this for public opinion, nor to ruin Preston’s reputation.

He just wanted Evelyn to see Preston’s hypocrisy—to plant that seed of doubt.

With that rift between them, Evelyn and Preston would never stand a chance.

Nathan stood by his office window, phone pressed to his ear. "Wrap this up. Move to Phase Two—bring the witness to Preston."

Let him choke on his lies.

NovelDreams Publishing content.

Harrison was taking meeting notes when Sophia Blackwood appeared at Nathan’s office door.

He hurried over. "Ms. Blackwood, here to see Mr. Blackwood?"

Sophia startled. "Yes. Grandfather sent me to tell Nathan about dinner tonight."

"Understood. One moment."

Sophia hesitated. "Harrison, could you tell him? I’ve been... avoiding him lately. I’ll just go—"

Harrison nodded. After what Nathan had done, even a spoiled socialite like Sophia had reason to fear him.

Sophia turned to leave, a flicker of vengeful intent in her eyes.
###Chapter 770

The chaos wasn't over.

That same evening.

The entertainment scandal dominated every conversation. The director and actress issued public apologies, but the internet mob showed no mercy.

Exclusive content from NovelDreams Publishing.

Then, shockingly, the whistleblower investor resurfaced. The name "Preston Sinclair" and his identity flooded the web. Someone had bought another trending topic.

This one sat firmly at the top of the list—impossible to ignore.

Preston Sinclair was quickly recognized as the man previously linked to Evelyn in earlier scandals. Which meant the wealthy woman he was pursuing? Evelyn Sinclair.

Once Evelyn's name got dragged in, containing the wildfire became nearly impossible.

William and Alexander rushed to the hospital, whisking Evelyn back to Sterling Manor before reporters could swarm. If the media surrounded the hospital, the situation would spiral.

Lucas had already warned the platforms—Evelyn's name was not to appear in trending topics. But private speculation ran wild. Her name dominated the comment sections.

Sterling Manor.

William sat in the living room, his face flushed with anger.

He couldn’t care less about Preston’s gossip.

The sudden reappearance of this woman was suspicious.

But with his daughter involved? He couldn’t stay silent. His opinion of Preston plummeted.

"Who’s behind this? Why hasn’t Preston responded? Is he hiding somewhere?"

Lucas glanced at Evelyn, lips pressed tight.

"No updates. Chasing him down over gossip isn’t a good look. I’ve done what I can. Pulling the topic twice in one day would draw too much attention."

"Lucas, your industry is a circus! Your sister is innocent, and you’re just sitting there spouting nonsense?"

William’s voice was icy. He glared at Lucas’s indifference.

Evelyn sighed.

"It’s all baseless. We did nothing wrong. Why should we panic?"

William’s expression darkened as he scrolled through comments.

"This is getting out of hand. People are calling you a mistress! Ridiculous!"

Once public opinion ran wild, controlling it was impossible.

The internet loved twisting things into the most scandalous version possible. The more outrageous the claims, the more they spread.

It was like they’d uncovered some explosive secret.

[Evelyn rejected Nathan Blackwood because of Preston Sinclair, who already has a kid? Evelyn needs to wake up and see this scumbag for what he is!]

[Evelyn’s taste in men never improves, does it?]

[Why would Evelyn settle for a man with baggage? Did they know each other before Preston dumped that woman?]

[Is Evelyn really a mistress?]

In the living room.

Evelyn thought for a moment, then called Alexander, who was working late.

"Alex, monitor Sterling Enterprises’ stock closely. Don’t let public opinion cause fluctuations—"

That was the priority.

William stared at his daughter. Even now, she was focused on business?

Alexander said something that made Evelyn’s brows lift slightly. She hung up.

"Stocks dipped slightly, but no major losses. It’ll stabilize once the gossip dies down."

"Dies down? Someone’s pushing this hard. Dominic and I pressured the platforms, but they won’t take it down—"

Lucas’s tone was sharp.

In his gut, he suspected only one person had the power to challenge the Sterlings.

But targeting Evelyn like this? That wasn’t his style.

Which was why Lucas hadn’t mentioned it to her.

Just then, the butler hurried in.

"Miss, Mr. Sinclair is here—"
###Chapter 771

The moment Preston Sinclair arrived, the atmosphere in the Sterling Manor shifted dramatically.

William Sterling let out a derisive snort. His anger toward Preston for involving his daughter in this scandal still simmered beneath the surface.

Yet recalling how Preston had saved Evelyn's life recently, William restrained himself from throwing the man out. Besides, Preston might be just another pawn in this twisted game.

Lucas gestured impatiently. "I'm certain Preston came to explain everything. Let him in already."

"Dad, he did save Evelyn's life. Even if you're furious, you need to tolerate this..."

William rolled his eyes before settling into his chair with forced composure. "I know!"

Lucas chuckled while Evelyn remained impassive.

Having confirmed Sterling Enterprises' stocks remained stable, Evelyn couldn't care less about the online uproar. Public condemnation wasn't new to her. What strangers thought of her image mattered little.

When Preston entered, he noted all Sterlings present except Alexander and Donovan. William and Lucas wore thunderous expressions. Only Evelyn offered him a faint smile.

"It's pouring outside. Mr. Sinclair is drenched. Archibald, fetch him a towel."

The butler hurried off and returned with a plush towel, which Preston accepted without using. His stormy gaze remained locked on Evelyn, heavy with guilt.

For several agonizing seconds, Preston struggled to begin. Terrified Evelyn might believe the vicious rumors, yet more terrified she wouldn't even bother asking for the truth - which would mean she didn't care.

Lucas's daughter shattered the tense silence. "Mr. Sinclair, you've had quite the eventful day, haven't you?"

Preston snapped back to reality, his smile strained yet polite. When his eyes met William's, they turned solemn with remorse.

"My deepest apologies for dragging Evelyn and the Sterlings into my mess. I've already arranged for this matter to disappear by morning. It will never resurface." His tone left no room for doubt.

William's expression softened slightly. "Mr. Sinclair, we consider you family and don't believe those vile rumors. Thank heavens Evelyn's thick-skinned enough to ignore this nonsense. Otherwise, how could she endure such internet vitriol?"

Preston's intense gaze swept over Evelyn. His usually composed features tightened. "Evelyn's the true innocent here. I'll issue a public statement clearing her name immediately. This... has been a painful lesson."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her smile never reaching her eyes. "The gossip means nothing. But these coordinated attacks target you specifically. Any idea who's behind them?"

Clearly someone wanted Preston destroyed. Who had he crossed in Montecito?

Preston's expression darkened. After a weighted pause, he murmured, "Blackwood Industries orchestrated this."

His words detonated like a grenade in the room. Nathan Blackwood?

"I learned Lucas helped suppress the trending topic this morning. Initially, I dismissed it as tabloid nonsense. But this afternoon, my PR team discovered someone paid the woman who accused me. They instructed her to create this scandal specifically to force me out of Montecito."

Watching William and Lucas's fury mount brought Preston no comfort. He'd never imagined Nathan could sink so low as to use Evelyn as a human shield.

Yet the investigation results lay indisputable before him. 'Has Nathan always been this despicable? I've gravely overestimated his character.'
###Chapter 772

Before Lucas could erupt into a string of curses, William frowned and turned to Preston Sinclair.

"As soon as Oliver was involved, we mobilized our resources to investigate. Your influence in Montecito isn't that extensive yet. How can you guarantee this will disappear by tomorrow?"

As a seasoned businessman, William Sterling never trusted anything without absolute certainty.

Could Nathan Blackwood really do this based on his attitude toward Evelyn? William seriously doubted Preston's claims.

Preston's gaze remained steady, warm and sincere, without a trace of deception or anger.

"My domestic connections may be limited, but I have substantial influence overseas. One of the major shareholders of this media platform resides abroad and maintains close ties with me. He was the source of this information. Blackwood Industries pressured them to suppress it, but it's not confidential among their executives."

William's expression darkened. "Nathan Blackwood, that bastard!"

Preston lowered his eyes slightly. "I've already negotiated with their senior management. This isn't just about me, but also the Sterling family's reputation. After 10 PM tonight, they'll restrict traffic and it'll vanish by tomorrow."

He should have acted sooner. Then Blackwood Industries wouldn't have gotten a second chance to exploit the situation.

The resurgence of the trending topic hurt more than just Preston.

The damage was irreparable.

William's face flushed with anger. When Lucas recovered from his shock, he remained silent, his expression grim.

They had both overestimated Nathan's integrity.

On reflection, it made sense. If Nathan could hurt Evelyn so deeply before, what kind of character did he truly possess?

Among them, Evelyn remained the calmest, which unsettled Preston.

He pressed his lips together. "Evelyn, I sincerely apologize for today's incident."

Evelyn smiled. "This isn't your fault. You're a victim too, so no apology is necessary."

"The online rumors are false. I know that woman, and everything she said is fabricated. Only what I told you before is true."

Preston paused, perhaps feeling his words sounded too arrogant, then added, "If you don't believe me, you can investigate. The truth won't be distorted."

Oliver wasn't his biological son, and Preston had only shared this with Evelyn.

He only needed her to believe in his innocence.

Preston had long wanted to clarify that no matter how vicious the internet rumors about him were, he could ignore them. His only concern was whether Evelyn would believe him.

After confirming with the overseas shareholders that the issue would be resolved, Preston rushed through the pouring rain to see her.

He wanted to apologize personally and explain himself.

Preston's humble demeanor took William and Lucas by surprise.

The Sterling father and son exchanged glances, pressed their lips together, and stayed silent.

Clearly, Preston's explanation was the real purpose of his visit.

Evelyn's eyes and lips curved into a faint smile.

Though slightly uncomfortable, she maintained her composure in front of others.

"Mr. Sinclair, there's no need for such extensive explanations. We certainly believe in your innocence. You don't need to prove anything."

Preston studied her clear, beautiful eyes. He felt relief but also a sinking sensation in his chest.

Did she believe him, or did she simply not care?

However, he wasn't in a position to press further. He quickly resumed his usual composed and modest demeanor.

A careless chill laced his voice.

"Right, but I won't let the perpetrator off so easily. It's utterly absurd to condemn someone based on mere words..."
###Chapter 773

After the meeting, Preston Sinclair studied Floyd's expression carefully.

"Uncle William, it's getting late. I apologize for disturbing you tonight. I'll make it up to you another time."

Preston prepared to leave.

William Sterling gave a slow nod, his earlier hostility noticeably softened. His anger had now been redirected entirely toward that despicable Nathan Blackwood.

"Of course. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We're family."

William shot Lucas a pointed look. Understanding immediately, Lucas stood and gestured toward the door.

"Mr. Sinclair, allow me."

Preston cast one last lingering glance at Evelyn before nodding and turning to leave.

When Lucas returned, he couldn't hold back any longer. His voice dripped with venom.

"What the hell is that bastard thinking? Does he have a death wish? Acting all noble on the surface while stabbing us in the back—what a goddamn hypocrite!"

The butler tried to intervene, but Lucas was too fired up.

Evelyn, meanwhile, remained eerily calm, stroking Leo's fur absently as if completely unbothered.

Leo stretched lazily and blinked up at her. "Mama, can we watch the stars tonight?"

Her dressing room's balcony was sealed, but the ceiling was made of smart glass.

With advanced 3D projection, it could simulate any season or weather, transforming the space into whatever she desired.

Lying on the floor, she could gaze up at a breathtakingly realistic night sky—stars glittering, the moon luminous.

It was the perfect way to clear her mind.

"I think that's a great idea," she murmured. Then, turning to her father, she added, "It's late. I should head up. Don't waste your energy being angry, Dad. We'll have our chance to strike back."

Her smile was icy.

She wasn't unaffected—she just knew rage wouldn't solve anything.

William waved her off. "Be careful. Lucas will stay in the room next to yours. Call him if you need anything."

Lucas smirked. "Yeah, scream if you have to." Just please don't pull another all-nighter plotting revenge.

Evelyn chuckled. "Goodnight, Dad."

Lucas wheeled her to the elevator, then released her chair once they reached her floor.

Her room was fully automated, and with Leo's help, she only needed to voice her commands.

Leo bounded ahead eagerly, triggering the door to slide open.

Lucas hesitated before leaving. "So… what’s the plan for dealing with Nathan? Just—don’t do anything reckless, okay?"

His sister had many talents, but impulse control wasn’t one of them.

Evelyn met his gaze. The cold intensity in her eyes sent a shiver down his spine. Her voice was soft but razor-sharp.

"I’ll bide my time. And when the moment comes… I’ll destroy him."

Lucas exhaled sharply.

His lips twitched. Seeing her reaction, he almost pitied Nathan. Almost.

A slow grin spread across his face as he patted her shoulder.

"Lil E, I have no doubt you’ll crush that bastard under your heel on your way to becoming the richest woman alive."

Evelyn ignored his dramatic declaration. Lucas had always had a flair for the theatrical.

Just then, her phone buzzed. Nathan’s name flashed on the screen.

Well, well… He’s calling me first.

Lucas took the hint and stepped back, exhaling deeply.

"If you need me, I’m right next door. Sleep in tomorrow—I’ll make you breakfast."

Hands in his pockets, he sauntered off.

Evelyn stared at the caller ID, her expression darkening.

Nathan Blackwood… I should’ve known.

If even Sterling Enterprises couldn’t suppress the trending scandal, the culprit had to be someone with equal power.

Who else but Blackwood Industries? She’d been too slow to connect the dots.

Nathan’s sweet words had dulled her instincts.

The ringing continued, echoing through the silent room.
###Chapter 774

Evelyn glanced at her buzzing phone and deliberately ignored it.

The small balcony was her sanctuary, its floor covered in plush white carpets so soft they felt like floating on air.

Yet Evelyn remained confined to her wheelchair.

Leo wasted no time claiming Evelyn's favorite spot. The AI tiger sprawled on its back, paws in the air, belly exposed to the starlight.

Its mechanical face somehow conveyed pure bliss as it gazed at the cosmos.

Everyone agreed Leo had remarkably refined tastes for an artificial intelligence - this stargazing hobby being proof.

Evelyn powered off her phone and looked up. The specially designed glass dome magnified the Milky Way into breathtaking clarity.

The distant stars appeared close enough to touch. Outside, the rain created a mesmerizing spectacle as enlarged droplets slid down the curved surface.

Sophia sat quietly in the living room, listening to the heated argument between Reginald Blackwood and Nathan echoing from the upstairs study.

Since returning to the Blackwood family, Sophia had transformed completely. Those months of working menial jobs had humbled her.

She now realized how foolish she'd been - believing her status as a Blackwood heiress entitled her to respect and privilege.

Her reckless confrontations with Evelyn had only brought repeated humiliation.

Being cast out by her brother Nathan had been the final blow.

At first, Sophia had begged and pleaded desperately.

But no one listened. Cut off financially, she found every door to the Blackwood estate barred against her.

That terrifying period taught her the true meaning of desperation.

Now that she'd clawed her way back into the family, Sophia would never return to that life of scraping by on commission checks.

Upstairs, Nathan's voice turned icy. "Was this your doing?" He stood rigid, radiating dangerous energy.

Under the study's warm lighting, Reginald's expression darkened at his grandson's accusatory tone.

"Since when do you address your elders this way?" Nathan's voice was rough with barely contained fury.

"I checked with Horizon Media. Tonight's press release went out under my name, but I never authorized it. Care to explain, Grandfather?"

Reginald's lips curled into a mocking smile, his aged eyes glinting sharply.

"Explain? You run the entire company. Shouldn't you be questioning Harrison about security breaches among your staff?"

Nathan's glare turned murderous at his grandfather's evasion.

With a sudden kick, he shattered an antique vase worth millions against the study wall.

"That vase was part of a matched set!" Reginald's grip on his chair turned white-knuckled, veins bulging beneath paper-thin skin.

"Harrison wouldn't dare cross me after all these years." Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous growl.

Reginald abandoned all pretense. "You've already investigated everything. Why bother asking?"

The old man's good mood had evaporated completely.

Nathan was systematically dismantling Reginald's control over Blackwood Industries.

The family's power structure had shifted irrevocably in the grandson's favor.

But Reginald wasn't ready to surrender just yet. 'Let the boy think he's won. I'll remind him who truly pulls the strings in this family.'
###Chapter 775

The study was bathed in a cold, dim glow, devoid of any warmth.

Papers and shattered glass littered the floor, the air thick with tension.

Nathan stood with his back to the light, his tall frame swallowed by shadows.

Only half of his sharp, chiseled features were visible—his dark eyes glinted like steel, barely containing the storm beneath.

He regretted it now—his mercy. He should have stripped Reginald Blackwood of all power from the start.

"Do you even realize what you've done?"

His voice was rough, low, edged with barely restrained fury as he glared at the old man.

Reginald merely smirked, amused by Nathan's hesitation.

Foolish boy. Still too soft.

"Did you really think your petty schemes would work against Preston Sinclair? I merely fanned the flames—let the fire consume him completely."

If Nathan hadn't made the first move, Reginald wouldn't have had the opening to strike.

He gave Nathan a knowing look.

"You hate him, don't you? For saving Evelyn. For worming his way into the Sterlings' good graces. You had the right idea—public opinion is a weapon. Let it destroy him. Once he's ruined, the Sterlings will turn their backs on him. And then... she'll have no choice but to return to you."

Nathan's chest tightened.

His gaze turned glacial, his voice razor-sharp.

"I stopped because I didn’t want Evelyn caught in the crossfire. But you—you dragged her into this mess. Now the entire world is talking about her. Is that what you wanted?"

Reginald merely smiled, unbothered.

"Sentimentality has no place in ambition. The public already despises the idea of her with Preston—a scandalous man with a bastard child. Versus you—her devoted ex-husband. The Sterlings aren’t fools. They’ll choose reputation over ruin."

He scoffed, disgusted by Nathan's weakness.

All this trouble for a woman. Pathetic.

"Women—they don’t appreciate kindness. Sometimes, you have to take what you want. Force her hand. Once she’s yours, you can make her love you. I’m giving you the opportunity!"

If Evelyn weren’t the Sterling heiress, Reginald wouldn’t have tolerated this obsession.

A woman was only worth her connections.

Everything else was just distraction.

Nathan’s fury burned hotter. His expression darkened, the air around him turning lethal.

"Do you honestly think the Sterlings won’t uncover the truth? That they’ll still let their daughter marry me after this? You’ve miscalculated. Push Evelyn too far, and she’ll drag us all down with her."

Reginald faltered. He hadn’t considered that.

Nathan’s voice dropped, deadly quiet.

"To ensure this never happens again, I’ve prepared your resignation from the board. Sign it. Or I’ll make it public myself."

The message was clear—power had shifted.

The Blackwood name now answered to him.

Reginald’s face twisted in outrage.

His hands shook with fury.

"You ungrateful bastard!"
###Chapter 776

Reginald Blackwood's legacy at Blackwood Industries was unparalleled.

His ruthless business tactics had single-handedly built the empire from the ground up.

Faced with cutthroat shareholders and vicious competitors, he'd made the hard choice decades ago.

He'd abandoned his weak-willed son Charles and chosen his ten-year-old grandson Nathan as heir instead.

Reginald personally molded Nathan into the perfect successor.

Military training forged his discipline. International education broadened his perspective.

Nathan's brilliance became Reginald's proudest achievement.

The moment Nathan returned from abroad, Reginald handed over the reins without hesitation.

He made it clear to everyone - Nathan was Blackwood Industries' future.

Reginald kept the Chairman title as his final trophy. A symbolic crown for his lifetime of work.

Now the grandson he'd shaped wanted to strip even that from him?

To publicly humiliate him before the entire business world?

Reginald's entire body shook with rage. His gnarled finger trembled as he pointed at Nathan.

"You'd destroy our family's reputation over some woman?"

Nathan's expression remained glacial. Dark eyes burned with controlled fury.

"You crossed the line. These are the consequences."

A cold pause. Then the final blow:

"If you disagree, feel free to remove me as CEO."

The unspoken challenge hung in the air.

Blackwood Industries wasn't the same company anymore. Nathan had systematically purged the old guard.

Reginald's threats were empty. His time had passed.

Nathan's gaze held no warmth, no familial affection. Just icy finality.

He turned on his heel and walked out as the old man's screams followed him.

"Ungrateful bastard! I made you! I chose you over your worthless father! This is how you repay me?"

Upstairs, antique vases shattered against walls.

"There are other Blackwoods! You're not irreplaceable, Nathan!"

The desperate threats of a man who'd lost his power.

Downstairs in the grand parlor, Sophia Blackwood exchanged nervous glances with the butler.

She sprang up when Nathan descended the staircase. "Brother—"

Panic clawed at her throat. Had their grandfather betrayed her involvement?

This entire scheme had been her doing. She'd eavesdropped at Blackwood Industries, then planted the idea in Reginald's ear.

Sophia hated Evelyn Sinclair. Even if the Blackwoods eventually accepted her, Sophia wanted her to suffer first.

Nathan's piercing gaze pinned her in place. His expression could have frozen hell over.

He studied her in terrifying silence.

Sophia's voice trembled. "Grandfather didn't mean it! We'll explain everything to Evelyn. She'll understand, right?"

She ducked her head, unable to bear his scrutiny another second.
###Chapter 777

Nathan's prolonged silence sent chills down Sophia's spine.

A cold, mocking laugh finally broke the silence. "Forgive who? You?" Sophia's head snapped up, her eyes wide with panic as she frantically shook her head.

"No, brother! It wasn't me! I wouldn’t dare—it was Grandfather!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his voice icy.

"I have people watching Grandfather. He had no idea what I was doing. But you—what exactly did you do when you visited my office yesterday?"

The accusation froze Sophia in place. Her face drained of color.

She had begged Harrison not to tell Nathan about her visit, forgetting that Harrison was Nathan’s most loyal man. Why would he obey her instead?

She stood there, stunned, her eyes welling up with tears.

"Sophia, it seems your time in the real world has taught you nothing. You’ve even learned to lie. Maybe you should go back to your sales job."

Horror flashed across her face. She rushed forward, tears streaming.

"Brother, I just couldn’t stand Preston Sinclair stealing Evelyn from you! That’s why I told Grandfather! Evelyn belongs to you—I only want you two to be happy! I never meant to hurt Evelyn. When the internet turned against her, I even hired people to defend her!"

She pulled out her phone, showing transaction records and chat logs—proof she had paid people to praise Evelyn.

Nathan narrowed his eyes, silent as Sophia sobbed.

"Mom left the country, Dad’s gone. You and Grandfather are all I have left. Please don’t send me away…"

She took a shaky step back. "I’ll apologize to Evelyn. I’ll kneel in the memorial hall right now!"

Without waiting for his response, she turned and ran, terrified he’d cast her out.

The butler hesitated. "Mr. Blackwood…?"

Nathan’s gaze was frigid.

"From now on, Reginald Blackwood and Sophia are not to leave the villa. I’ll have someone bring the contract daily until he signs it."

This was the real Nathan Blackwood—ruthless and unyielding.

As Nathan strode out, the butler sighed. The number of guards stationed at the villa tripled instantly.

Inside the memorial hall, Sophia waited until she heard Nathan’s car leave before collapsing onto a bench in relief.

She pulled out her phone, scrolling through the messages.

Thank God she’d been smart enough to hire those keyboard warriors during the argument upstairs. It had given her just enough leverage to stay.

But further up the chat logs were damning records—proof she had paid people to slander Evelyn.

Nathan’s car sped down the empty road, the streetlights casting long, lonely shadows.

He rolled down the window, letting the cold air bite at his skin.

He had already pulled the trending topics. Seeing Evelyn dragged into the second wave of backlash had been unbearable.

But the investigation led back to him—and ultimately, to Reginald.

Nathan had to strip his grandfather of power before he hurt Evelyn irreparably.

And today?

Evelyn hadn’t answered a single call.

She must already know everything.

In her eyes, he was nothing but a petty, scheming villain—someone who’d tried to ruin her relationship with Preston and drag her down in the process.

The weight of that realization was suffocating.

Panic set in.

His car screeched to a halt outside the hospital where Evelyn had been staying. Reporters swarmed the entrance, cameras flashing.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. He dialed Harrison.

"Clear out the reporters at the hospital—"

Harrison hesitated. "Mr. Blackwood, I just received word… Ms. Sinclair has already been discharged."
###Chapter 778

Nathan slammed the phone down.

The engine roared to life as he peeled out of the parking spot, tires screeching against the pavement. His knuckles turned white gripping the steering wheel, the speedometer needle climbing dangerously high.

Adrenaline pumped through his veins. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this alive.

When his car skidded to a halt outside Sterling Manor, reality came crashing down. The night air felt like ice against his skin.

He grabbed his phone again.

Evelyn's number went straight to voicemail.

Nathan smashed his fist against the horn. The blaring sound shattered the quiet night.

Inside the manor, the butler jolted awake. Security monitors showed the familiar black Range Rover at the gates.

Nathan Blackwood.

The butler hesitated only a moment before knocking on Evelyn's door.

She was still awake when the knock came. Leo, her AI tiger companion, padded to the door, tail swishing.

"Miss Sinclair," the butler said quietly. "Mr. Blackwood is at the gates."

Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "Let him rot out there."

She'd seen his true colors now.

The respectable CEO facade? A lie. The man was petty, vindictive.

Yesterday's stunt with Preston Sinclair proved that.

It wasn't about defending Preston. It was about Nathan's underhanded tactics.

The butler bowed. "As you wish, Miss. Rest well."

The manor remained silent, ignoring the man at their gates.

Nathan watched the darkened windows. Part of him hoped the horn had woken them. Another part knew better.

He was so close to her. Yet an ocean might as well separate them.

In the cold stillness, realization hit him like a bullet.

It was over.

The ache in his chest was unbearable.

Dawn came. Nathan hadn't slept. His stubble darkened his jaw, his eyes bloodshot.

The manor gates swung open. A car glided past without slowing, as if his presence meant nothing.

The Sterlings' message was clear.

Nathan almost laughed at the irony. CEO of Blackwood Industries. One of the most powerful men in the city.

Yet here he was, begging scraps of attention from his ex-wife.

What would the business world say if they saw him now?

But he couldn't leave. The fear of losing her completely rooted him to the spot.

If Evelyn would just look at him—just once—he'd give her anything. Everything.

Morning slipped away unnoticed.

At 9 AM, his phone buzzed. Harrison, his assistant.

"Sir, the board meeting starts in twenty. Your driver went to Highland Estates but—"

"Cancel it." Nathan's voice was raw. "Don't call unless the building's on fire."

He hung up before Harrison could protest.

His assistant's unspoken words hung in the air: Every meeting is important.

Nathan didn't care.

His gaze never left the manor.

Inside, Evelyn stretched lazily. She applied a jade roller to her face, reclining her wheelchair slightly.

The scent of Lucas' famous pancakes drifted from the kitchen.

William Sterling had planned to go fishing. Hearing about Nathan's vigil killed his mood.

He settled for the koi pond in the gardens instead.

At breakfast, only Evelyn and Lucas sat at the table. She ate with surprising appetite.

Lucas nearly choked on his coffee when the butler updated them.

"That bastard actually stayed all night?"
###Chapter 779

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Her brother Lucas had zero tact, always bringing up the wrong people at the worst possible moments.

"Did they take down the trending topic?" She was a master at changing subjects.

Lucas nodded eagerly, updating her on the situation.

"Gone two hours before Preston predicted. Vanished without a trace. That woman's account got suspended too. She posted a retraction, admitting she was paid to spread lies."

He leaned forward, eyes gleaming.

"Turns out she barely knew Preston. Just interned at his investment bank once. That 'couple photo'? Cropped from a group shot during her internship."

Evelyn's lips curled in disgust. "She's got a death wish."

Lucas smirked. "The internet turned on her fast. Everyone's calling her out for manipulating public sympathy. But Preston?" He whistled. "That man plays dirty."

"How so?"

"Normally, victims send lawyer letters. Get an apology and move on. Not Preston." Lucas chuckled. "He took her apology letter straight to the police as evidence. Got her arrested red-handed. Brutal efficiency."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Waste not, want not."

"Would've been perfect if she hadn't tried fleeing the country at dawn." Lucas sighed dramatically. "Police nabbed her at the airport. Wish I'd seen that."

She couldn't care less about the spectacle. Only the outcome mattered.

"Any stock market fallout?"

"Opposite. With the rumor-monger arrested, all accusations against you collapsed. Public sympathy sent our stocks soaring."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. The tension in her shoulders eased.

"Good. As long as my money's safe."

Pushing her plate away, she stood. "I'm calling Alexander."

Lucas frowned, gulping down her abandoned orange juice. "He said to focus on recovering. No work."

Evelyn turned, icy laughter hanging in the air.

"This isn't work. It's annihilation." She didn't just mean Nathan Blackwood. She meant them all.

Lucas pressed his lips together. Wise men didn't interfere when women waged war.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn emerged from the study, phone in hand, victory already dancing in her eyes.

Bypassing Lucas and Donovan, she contacted a media platform. Got a number. Dialed.

A groggy, raspy voice answered. "Who's this?"

Evelyn's tone dripped honeyed venom. "Hello, 'Shai.' Evelyn Sinclair, CEO of Sterling Enterprises."

Dead silence. Then sharp, panicked breathing. The infamous anti-fan never expected her personal call.

"Y-You—"

Shai had taken fortunes to smear Evelyn—fabricating affairs, scandals, every vicious lie imaginable. Half his peers were in jail thanks to her lawsuits.

Evelyn's laugh was velvet-wrapped steel. "Relax. If I wanted you arrested, I wouldn't be calling."

She paused, letting fear sink in.

"I need a favor. Do it well, and I'll pay ten times your usual rate. Plus a job at Horizon Media." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Interested?"
###Chapter 780

Evelyn Sinclair had planned everything meticulously. Even if that online troll could never work in his original field again after betraying his employer for money, she'd made sure he had alternatives.

Wave Media stood as the most prestigious content creation platform in the industry - the very same platform where he'd built his following as a wildlife vlogger. An opportunity like this was beyond his wildest dreams.

The man hesitated, resisting the temptation of this unexpected windfall. "H-how do I know you're not lying to me?"

Evelyn's light laughter carried through the phone. "You're at home, correct? In five minutes, a Wave Media employment contract will arrive at your doorstep. Still doubtful? I'll have my lawyers draft a formal agreement. I'm paying you for future services, not punishing past mistakes. Honestly, with this sum involved, would I bother deceiving you?"

To ordinary people, this represented life-changing money.

For someone like Evelyn Sinclair? Barely pocket change.

Why would she personally call just to lie? His hesitation lasted mere seconds. "Alright, I accept!"

Evelyn's voice remained warm. "Thank you. Add me on WhatsApp and send me that file. I'd like to keep it." She ended the call with gracious farewells.

Dr. Know-It-All sat stunned.

Never in his life had he felt such exhilaration. The woman he'd slandered spoke with gentle grace, her tone flowing like spring water. No trace of anger, only patience that inspired immediate trust.

Shame washed over him.

Within minutes, he'd added Evelyn and sent the requested materials, accompanying them with a remorseful message:

[Dear Ms. Sinclair,
Thank you for this second chance. I'll dedicate myself to making amends. Please don't hesitate to call upon me.
-Sincerely, Shai.]

Evelyn's reply came simply: "Thank you."

The butler informed her Nathan Blackwood still hadn't left the premises.

'Is he waiting for me to personally throw him out? I've no desire to see him,' Evelyn thought irritably.

Lucas Sterling insisted on dragging his sister outside for fresh air, practically pushing her wheelchair into the garden. "You've been cooped up too long," he declared, perching happily on a wrought-iron swing.

Evelyn shot him an exasperated look. Clearly, her actor brother just wanted company!

'So annoying,' she mused.

Yet the crisp air carried the delicate fragrance of blooming plum trees, their petals dusting the cobblestone path. The winter sunlight filtered through bare branches, casting intricate shadows.

"Evie, want to join me?" Lucas grinned, patting the swing beside him. "I'll lift you up!"

"Childish," Evelyn rolled her eyes. "I'd rather explore the front gardens." She pressed the wheelchair's control button, executing a smooth pivot toward the gravel path.

What normally seemed charmingly rustic became inconvenient terrain for wheels. Last night's rain left the stones slick with lingering moisture, the winter chill preserving dangerous patches of ice.

Evelyn navigated carefully until—

A sudden jolt. One wheel lodged stubbornly between stones. She pressed the acceleration button. Nothing.

The staff remained occupied near the mansion's entrance, unaware of her predicament.

Without warning, the wheelchair lurched sideways.

Evelyn gasped as gravity took hold. The world tilted violently as she and the chair tumbled toward the frozen ground.
###Chapter 781

Evelyn Sinclair was just about to call out for her third brother when her wheelchair suddenly jerked to a stop—thirty centimeters from the ground.

Someone had caught it from behind.

Strong arms wrapped around her, lifting both her and the wheelchair effortlessly. She didn’t need to look up. The scent of smoke and the cold, tense aura told her everything.

This wasn’t someone from Sterling Manor. No one here would dare ambush her like this.

A second later, she was set down gently on the pavement, the wheelchair settled smoothly beside her.

Then she saw him.

Nathan Blackwood.

His face was inches from hers, his expression unreadable.

Had he really been so impatient waiting outside that he’d resorted to breaking in?

The butler and guards at the gate had already noticed his intrusion and were rushing over.

"Miss Sinclair—"

Evelyn raised a hand, silencing them. The butler understood immediately and signaled the others to retreat.

Nathan’s eyes were bloodshot, his complexion haggard. The faint scent of smoke clung to him, making him look even more worn.

He dropped to one knee in front of her, his gaze intense.

"Evelyn. We need to talk."

He’d waited outside long enough to know she wouldn’t see him willingly.

But he refused to leave without making things clear. If he didn’t explain now, it would truly be over between them.

So he’d slipped past the guards, scaled an unguarded section of the wall, and jumped down.

Nathan was ex-military, trained in combat. Otherwise, the fall alone would have killed him—or at least gotten him caught.

But he’d made it just in time to catch Evelyn before she hit the ground.

Seeing her momentarily vulnerable, trapped in that wheelchair, made his chest tighten.

Evelyn’s eyes were icy, but her smile remained polite, detached.

"Mr. Blackwood. Since when do you enter through the walls instead of the front door?"

What kind of rogue behavior was this?

Nathan’s jaw clenched. His gaze was heavy, conflicted.

"I just needed to speak to you. Face to face."

"Go ahead."

Evelyn smirked, waiting. She wanted to hear what excuse he’d come up with this time.

The words burned on his tongue, but he didn’t know where to start.

"I’m sorry about yesterday."

Her brows lifted. "Sorry for what?"

She was playing dumb. Nathan frowned. "You don’t know?"

"Know what? Oh—my phone broke. Did you try calling?"

She blinked, all innocence.

For a moment, the tension in his shoulders eased slightly. "I thought… you were angry."

Evelyn’s crystal-clear eyes darkened.

"Angry? The public is tearing Preston Sinclair apart. Why should I be angry?"

She wanted him to feel the full weight of his actions—wanted him to squirm in shame when he least expected it.

Nathan stiffened. His expression turned grim.

A flicker of disappointment crossed his face. "You already knew. Of course you did."

She’d been pretending ignorance just to mess with him.

Evelyn scoffed. "Mr. Blackwood. Are you disappointed your little scheme didn’t work? I have to admit—I didn’t expect you to resort to something so underhanded."

The damage had been minimal, but the sheer audacity disgusted her.

Nathan’s face was stone. His dark brows furrowed with frustration.

"I never meant to drag you into this. Yes, I orchestrated the morning incident—but the one at night wasn’t me."

His voice was rough, uncertain. Would she believe him?

"I wouldn’t involve you like that. I just wanted to send Preston a warning."
###Chapter 782

Evelyn let out a soft chuckle as she stepped closer to Nathan.

"What's done is done. Do you really think throwing baseless accusations at an innocent man will get you what you want?"

"Baseless?" Nathan's jaw tightened. "Everyone knows Preston Sinclair's scandalous affair with his brother's wife. That's no secret overseas."

Nathan couldn't stand Evelyn's dismissive attitude, her blind faith in Preston. He needed her to see the truth.

But Evelyn remained perfectly composed.

She'd known about this long before Nathan mentioned it - knew more than he could imagine.

'His brother's wife? That would be Oliver's biological mother.'

The way Nathan phrased it sounded so crude. Yet Preston had sacrificed his reputation to give Oliver legitimacy. That deserved respect.

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, meeting Nathan's gaze with amusement.

"Mr. Blackwood, perhaps don't judge what you don't understand."

Then she delivered her counterstrike.

"Weren't you involved with your brother's woman too?"

Vanessa Holloway had been Theodore Hart's girlfriend, yet Nathan had moved heaven and earth for her.

What right did he have to cast stones?

Nathan froze as if struck. Humiliation and frustration twisted his features.

His mood darkened instantly.

Leaning into her personal space, his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

"You trust Preston more than me, don't you?"

Evelyn met his stormy gaze without flinching. "I trust the truth."

Nathan's handsome face darkened with barely restrained fury.

She didn't trust the truth - she simply didn't trust him.

His breathing grew ragged, eyes burning with unshed rage.

He wanted to scream. To break something. To make her understand.

But looking at her, he forced himself to calm down.

"You can't do this to me, Evelyn," he rasped. "After everything - saving your life, nearly dying for you. You can't just move on so quickly—"

'And doubt me. Hurt me. Push me away,' he thought bitterly.

Evelyn watched his composure crack and felt a flicker of satisfaction.

If not for his past heroics, she wouldn't be having this conversation at all.

Her expression cooled. "We're discussing business, Mr. Blackwood, yet you bring up personal matters? I know you didn't orchestrate the online attacks, but you're still connected. Not that it matters - it's all in the past."

A cold smile played on her lips. She had plans brewing.

Nathan studied her carefully, the bitterness spreading through him like poison.

She truly believed him guilty.

"The late-night exposé was my grandfather's doing," he admitted. "I've handled it. You needn't worry."

His probing gaze found no purchase in her impassive face.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with realization. 'So Reginald Blackwood was behind this. Like grandfather, like grandson.'

She nearly laughed. 'Don't worry? Does he expect me to pretend nothing happened?'

"Give Chairman Blackwood my regards," she said sweetly.

Nathan frowned. There was something beneath her words he couldn't decipher.

Something dangerous.

"Then... are you still—"

'Angry?' he wanted to ask, but the words died in his throat.
###Chapter 783

Nathan Blackwood didn't get to finish his sentence before Lucas Sterling's voice cut through the air, sharp and unyielding.

"Who let you in here, Nathan Blackwood?"

Lucas made no effort to hide his disdain.

He used to pity the man, but now? Disgust was the only thing left.

"You think you can just hover over my sister like that?"

Nathan had leaned in too close—like he had any right.

No. Absolutely not.

Nathan straightened, his jaw tight. At the same moment, Evelyn Sinclair pressed the button on her wheelchair, rolling back smoothly.

Lucas stepped forward, positioning himself between them, his glare a warning.

"Mr. Blackwood, you're the last person welcome in this house. Get out."

No one spoke to Nathan like that. No one.

But this was Lucas—Evelyn's brother.

Nathan clenched his fists, forced to swallow the insult.

His gaze flicked to Evelyn.

She gave him a cool smile. "Goodbye, Nathan."

He hesitated, then nodded stiffly. "I'll come back."

A final glance at Lucas, and he turned on his heel.

His retreating figure was anything but graceful.

Evelyn tapped Lucas's arm. "Let's go."

Lucas pushed her wheelchair forward without another word.

When they reached the pebble path, he lifted her effortlessly.

Evelyn frowned. "This path is ridiculous. Get rid of it."

Lucas smirked. "Dad handpicked every stone. Say the word, and I'll have it cleared by morning."

Evelyn paused. "Never mind. I thought it was your terrible taste."

Lucas scoffed. No gratitude at all.

"Nathan really screwed up this time. Must’ve lost his mind."

Evelyn settled back into her wheelchair, pressing the button to move forward. Her voice was flat. "It was Reginald Blackwood. Nathan isn’t that stupid."

Lucas rolled his eyes. "Love makes people stupid. Either way, I’m on your side."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You sure you picked the right team?"

Lucas narrowed his eyes. "You still into him?"

Evelyn smirked. "I’d rather stay single. So don’t switch sides."

Lucas huffed and stalked off.

Less than a day later.

The internet had barely finished apologizing for believing the rumors when the scandal reignited.

A popular influencer, Shai, exposed everything.

Sophia Blackwood had paid him to spread lies about Evelyn—vicious, fabricated stories.

Shai released screenshots of their messages and bank transfers.

The topic exploded.

Sophia had transferred 82 million. A fortune.

She wanted Evelyn painted as a homewrecker. Shai hesitated.

[Sophia Blackwood: Make it worse. Say she’s a serial mistress. Better yet—say Preston Sinclair’s son is hers.]

[Shai: That’s harsh.]

[Sophia Blackwood: Do you want the money or not? I want her ruined.]

Every word dripped with entitlement.
###Chapter 784

If Sophia could stoop so low with money, what lines wouldn't she cross when desperate?

Shai's damning chat logs and bank transactions were all attached. He'd even invited investigators to verify everything, swearing on his reputation that he hadn't lied or concealed anything.

The influencer repeatedly expressed remorse toward Evelyn, apologizing profusely while thanking her for not pressing charges.

Yet conscience compelled him to expose the truth publicly.

Shai admitted his shame for profiting from unethical smear campaigns that betrayed his principles.

In a final act of contrition, he announced the permanent deletion of his Twitter account.

His closing words cut deepest: "Ms. Blackwood should do more good deeds - karma's watching."

There could only be one Ms. Blackwood from that family.

Sophia had already gained notoriety for gambling away the "Daydream" necklace. High society knew her as spoiled rotten.

Now her dirty laundry aired again.

During Evelyn's marriage to Nathan, Sophia constantly belittled her sister-in-law while making her life miserable. Textbook rich bitch behavior.

Utterly insufferable.

What enraged netizens more was Sophia wielding family influence to slander innocents without consequence.

Her cruelty toward both Preston and Evelyn left zero defenders in the comments.

[Think money makes you untouchable, Sophia? Evelyn's richer than you'll ever be!]

[Any man marrying this gold-digger deserves the bankruptcy coming his way!]

[Thank God Evelyn's wealthy enough to fight back! Regular folks would be destroyed!]

[Turns out Sophia sabotaged Nathan's reconciliation! The Blackwoods are vipers!]

The internet exploded.

Though not a celebrity, Sophia's status as Blackwood heiress drew vicious envy.

And she'd proven utterly unworthy of it.

Lucas found Evelyn arranging flowers in the sunroom, phone in hand. "This your handiwork?"

Evelyn didn't need to look up to know social media was ablaze. Her lips curved. "Effective?"

"Pulling the rug from under Sophia Blackwood?" Lucas grinned. "Masterstroke."

Evelyn met his gaze, eyes glittering. "Do tell."

Sophia was merely the pawn. The real target stood behind her - the Blackwood empire enabling her malice.

Without their backing, would Sophia dare act so brazenly?

While peers worked honest jobs, she'd weaponized wealth to destroy lives without remorse.

Seeing Evelyn's anticipation, Lucas obliged. After all, he'd cheered this revenge.

Only Evelyn could turn Sophia's own tactics against her. Poetic justice at its finest.

"Media's already mobilized. Grant got their VP and senior exec blackout drunk. Even if Nathan moves fast, he can't reach them. That hashtag isn't coming down." Lucas smirked. "Blackwood Industries stock? Plummeting. Nine billion per minute. How the mighty have fallen."

Corporate reputation meant everything.

Evelyn finally exhaled, satisfaction warming her smile. "Bullies only understand one language. Since they came for me, I'll bankrupt them."

Nathan Blackwood. Reginald Blackwood. Even that waste of oxygen Sophia.

None would escape unscathed.
###Chapter 785

Sophia Blackwood never imagined that Shai, the so-called influencer who'd taken her money, would have the audacity to betray her.

Did this mean all the carefully crafted images she'd built in Nathan's eyes were now destroyed?

Her fingers trembled as she scrolled through the viral posts online.

With shaking hands, she immediately tried calling Shai.

Two rings. Then silence.

The line went dead.

Furious, she switched to direct messaging. [Name your price. Delete everything now!]

The reply came faster than expected. [I don't want your blood money.

My conscience won't allow it.]

Sophia nearly shattered her phone against the wall. "Conscience? Since when do mercenaries have morals?"

Clearly someone had paid him more.

A knock at her bedroom door made her jump.

She forced composure into her voice. "Come in."

The butler entered with troubled eyes. "Miss Sophia, Mr. Blackwood called. You're not to leave the estate. He's on his way."

Her knees buckled.

Cold sweat broke across her forehead as she gripped the dresser for support.

This was it. Nathan would skin her alive.

Cursing, she bolted to the study where Reginald Blackwood sat brooding. "Grandfather!"

Though the smear campaign had been her idea, the old patriarch had approved every step.

She'd personally hired the influencers, paid the troll farms, planted the rumors.

Reginald had used his media connections to push it to trending status.

Now a guillotine hovered above her neck.

Tears streamed down her face as she spun a sob story about her retail job hardships - the snubs, the backbreaking work, the humiliation.

For a moment, Reginald's expression softened.

But reality crashed back when he remembered Nathan's ultimatum - two daily deliveries demanding his resignation from the board.

How could he plead for Sophia when his own position hung by a thread?

An idea struck him.

He reached for the phone. "Let's see if the Sterlings will intervene."

If Evelyn Sinclair spoke for Sophia, perhaps Nathan would show mercy.

The line rang four times before William Sterling answered. "Reginald?"

"William! The internet nonsense has gotten out of hand. Surely there's been some misunderstanding. Join us for dinner tonight so we can-"

A humorless laugh cut him off. "My daughter's recovering from a car accident. She can't walk. The answer's no."

"Nonsense! I'll send a car with special suspension-"

William's voice turned arctic. "Say what you want now. Evelyn isn't coming. After your family's smear campaign, we're avoiding public appearances."

Reginald chuckled nervously. "Come now, children will be children. We adults should mediate-"

"Your 'child' is twenty-five. Unless she's a giant toddler?" William's sarcasm dripped like poison.
###Chapter 786

Giant baby?

Nathan Blackwood had been blunt, but he'd shown remarkable restraint.

If not for Reginald Blackwood's status as his grandfather, Nathan would have cursed the old man into an early grave.

Reginald shifted uncomfortably before forcing a polite smile.

"Sophia lacks proper upbringing. I'll discipline her properly, but there's one small favor I must ask of you, grandson."

"I'm not granting any favors."

Reginald plowed ahead, ignoring Nathan's refusal. "Have Evelyn Sinclair publicly clarify this was all a misunderstanding. We're practically family - surely she can forgive Sophia after some explanation. This entire mess stems from Preston Sinclair's meddling. Without him, our families wouldn't be in this position. We should be united against our common enemy—"

Nathan cut him off sharply.

"Chairman Blackwood, Evelyn didn't forgive your granddaughter for those unethical actions. She won't be coerced into accepting any apology. If Sophia was truly manipulated, let her provide evidence online. Otherwise..." Nathan's voice turned icy. "Hiring internet trolls to spread lies and slander sounds like a felony to me."

Reginald's face turned ashen. He opened his mouth to respond, but Nathan had already ended the call.

The old man gasped for air, panic setting in.

"The Sterlings won't let this go. We're lucky they haven't involved the police yet." Never in his life had Reginald been so thoroughly dismissed. Everyone knew Nathan ran Blackwood Industries now, leaving the elder Blackwood as little more than a figurehead. Who still truly respected the old patriarch these days? The realization darkened his expression further.

Twenty years ago, would Nathan have dared speak to him like this?

Sophia collapsed into hysterical sobs, her face ghostly pale. "What do we do? I can't go to jail! Our family's reputation will be ruined!"

A sharp knock interrupted them. The butler announced, "Master Nathan has arrived—"

Sophia trembled violently. "Grandfather—"

The study door burst open. Nathan stormed in, his expression thunderous. His piercing glare carried enough intensity to suffocate the room. He'd known Reginald was behind this scheme, which was why he'd stripped the old man of power - consequences be damned. But discovering Sophia's involvement? That was new information.

Nathan's investigation had uncovered Dr. Know-It-All's employer. The Blackwoods had orchestrated this shamelessly.

After so many twists, Nathan's simmering rage erupted. How foolish he'd been, thinking removing Reginald's authority would suffice as explanation to Evelyn. Instead, she'd chosen her own ruthless retaliation. Just how despicable were the Blackwoods?

Nathan's eyes glinted like shards of ice. This brainless sister of his needed to be taught a permanent lesson. His imposing frame advanced, radiating menace. Sophia froze momentarily before primal terror took hold.

"Brother, I—I know I was wrong!"

She'd assumed Reginald's involvement would protect her. Who knew the influencer she'd bribed would betray her? Damn that Dr. Know-It-All!

Sophia's legs gave out. She crumpled to the floor, scrambling onto her knees in desperate supplication.

"Brother, I only wanted to help you reconcile with Evelyn! I thought if she believed Preston dragged her into this mess, she'd cut ties with him. Then you'd have another chance!"
###Chapter 787

Sophia Blackwood was desperately trying to prove her innocence, but Nathan Blackwood refused to believe a single word. He couldn't comprehend how his own sister had turned into such a deceitful person.

Reginald Blackwood, the family patriarch, finally spoke up with icy disapproval. "What exactly are you trying to achieve? She's your flesh and blood! Her intentions were good. The public backlash was just unfortunate timing."

His voice grew sharper. "Are you really willing to destroy our entire family over that woman?"

The tension in the study became palpable.

The old man's cane struck the floor with a sharp crack. "Why don't you just legally change your surname to Sterling? Let's see if they'll even acknowledge you after you abandon the Blackwood name!" Having reached his limit, Reginald saw no reason to keep protecting the grandson he'd personally groomed for leadership.

Nathan's dark, shadowed eyes locked onto his grandfather. His voice came out low and measured. "Actually, grandfather, if you wouldn't object to changing the Blackwood name to Sterling, I'd have no objections either."

Reginald's face twisted in fury. "You'd truly hand our family legacy to outsiders? I must have been blind to ever name you as my successor!" The elderly man rose unsteadily, grabbing his cane and swinging it at Nathan with all his strength.

Nathan didn't flinch. His expression remained blank as the cane connected with his forehead before clattering to the floor. Blood immediately began trickling down his face in a crimson trail.

Sophia gasped, frozen in terror. Nathan stood enveloped in a dangerous aura so intense it silenced the room. Even breathing seemed to stop.

Reginald's posture stiffened. His aged eyes narrowed as his face contorted with displeasure. For the first time, he truly understood - Nathan was beyond his control. The boy had always been obsessive about what he couldn't have.

Nathan's lips twisted into a cruel smile. "Feel better now that you've hit me, grandfather?"

Before Reginald could respond, Nathan continued coldly, "If you've vented sufficiently, perhaps you'll finally sign the documents. No point wasting everyone's time." The papers would strip Reginald of his executive powers while maintaining his honorary status and wealth.

This only fueled Reginald's rage further. He wanted nothing more than to beat some sense into his ungrateful grandson.

Nathan ignored him, turning his attention to the trembling Sophia. His voice turned glacial. "You couldn't stay out of trouble even after returning. Clearly a few months away didn't teach you any lessons. After causing billions in losses and sending our stock prices plummeting, you still dare make excuses?"

Sophia's lips quivered as tears streamed down her face. "I've learned my lesson! Please, brother, forgive me this once. I don't want to be disowned! I'll apologize to Evelyn - I swear I'll never cross her again!"

Nathan's laugh held no warmth. "An apology? You think this is just about Evelyn? In thirty minutes, Blackwood Industries lost tens of billions in market value. Our shares are hitting record lows. Do you honestly believe an apology fixes that?"
###Chapter 788

Nathan Blackwood's words sent shockwaves through Reginald Blackwood. Age had dulled the old man's senses - his hearing wasn't what it used to be, his vision blurred. He'd assumed this scandal would merely tarnish Blackwood Industries' reputation at worst. A few days of reprimands for Sophia, then business as usual. Never had he imagined billions would vanish from their market value overnight.

For a brief moment, Reginald considered pleading for his granddaughter. The words died in his throat. During his tenure, Blackwood Industries had been a strong competitor, but nothing like the empire Nathan had built. The man was a business prodigy, consolidating power and elevating their standing to legendary status in mere years. These losses weren't just stock fluctuations - they threatened the entire corporation.

Sophia's face drained of color. This wasn't just trouble - it was catastrophe.

Would she really be cast out again so soon after returning?

Nathan's expression turned glacial as he summoned security. No one entered the Blackwood estate's second floor without permission. "Sophia Blackwood," his voice cut like ice, "You're hereby banished from this family. Don't ever return. You'll receive enough to survive one month outside Montecito - after that, you're on your own."

His cold gaze swept over her indifferently before he turned on his heel. That pittance wouldn't last long. Initially, Nathan had intended for Sophia to learn humility through entry-level work - proper training for future leadership.

As a Blackwood heiress, she was meant to join corporate leadership. Instead, she'd mastered deception. Nathan decided Blackwood Industries had no place for spoiled socialites. Nobody dared challenge his decree.

Security dragged the sobbing Sophia away.

"Brother! I've learned my lesson! Please—" Her pleas fell on deaf ears. Reginald wouldn't oppose Nathan now.

Power had shifted completely in recent years. The old patriarch was but a figurehead, stripped of real authority. He seethed silently: 'Since when does Nathan alone decide who stays in this family? Am I not still the head?'

This couldn't continue. Sophia's wails grew so pitiful even the butler shuddered. Within hours, she was bundled into a car and shipped to the airport. Sophia knew it was over - Nathan had abandoned her. Without the Blackwood name, what was she?

Overnight, the infamous socialite became a pariah - ridiculed online, disowned by her family. A stray dog with no shelter. Nathan stood in the shadows of Aspen Lodge's entrance, features unreadable.

The butler trembled nearby. Nathan's reputation for ruthless efficiency preceded him - rules were absolute. "Sir...should we inform the rest of the family about Ms. Blackwood?"

Objections would surely follow. Under Reginald's influence, resistance would grow. Nathan's sidelong glance answered the question before words could. He turned away silently.

That single look froze the butler's blood.

His probing had been transparent - and Nathan saw right through him.
###Chapter 789

Nathan Blackwood left Highland Estates and headed straight to Blackwood Industries. The corporation was drowning in scandal, with public opinion turning vicious.

Netizens had dug up every wrong the Blackwoods had ever done to Evelyn Sinclair. They painted Sophia Blackwood's actions as representative of the entire company's ruthless pursuit of profit.

When Nathan had loved Evelyn, he had been so devoted that people believed it was genuine. Now, his indifference only fueled the outrage. Blackwood Industries' stock plummeted, marking the year's most dramatic corporate crisis.

Yet Nathan remained eerily calm.

The company only responded when shares neared rock bottom. Instead of diverting attention, Blackwood Industries' PR team took an unexpected approach.

They issued a formal apology—on behalf of Sophia Blackwood—to Evelyn and the public. Though the corporation claimed ignorance of Sophia's schemes, they acknowledged their failure to control her.

The PR department laid out the entire timeline, leaving no detail unaddressed. They admitted the Blackwood family's negligence and pledged full compensation for Sterling Enterprises' losses.

The announcement exploded online.

Most conglomerates would deny wrongdoing or wait for the storm to pass. Blackwood Industries' brutal honesty stunned everyone. This was how a corporate giant should own its mistakes.

The backlash softened when the company's social media manager—known for his playful online persona—broke down the statement in simple, engaging terms. His sincerity disarmed critics.

Blackwood Industries finally tracked down the "missing" media executives and suppressed the negative coverage. They steered the narrative toward reconciliation.

By midnight, public fury had cooled. Then, in a masterstroke, Blackwood Industries began promoting Sterling Enterprises' upcoming product line.

The social media manager's humble plea for forgiveness was perfection. The rivalry-turned-respect between the two corporations captivated the internet.

Blackwood Industries' stock stabilized, then climbed.

By morning, the company dominated trending topics.

[Blackwood Industries promoting Sterling Enterprises? Is Nathan Blackwood secretly begging Evelyn for forgiveness? These two are killing me!]

[Sophia Blackwood is the real villain here. Jealous, spoiled, and completely useless. She nearly destroyed her own family!]

[Full marks for PR execution, but let’s be real—is Nathan really this clueless in love? Rich people drama is exhausting.]

[Using their official platform to hype Sterling’s new products? That’s next-level goodwill. No corporation is this generous!]

[Blackwood stock is rebounding! I don’t have to jump off a building today!]
###Chapter 790

The sun rose over Blackwood Industries, painting the corporate towers in golden light. The company's tarnished reputation was slowly being restored. Public perception had shifted favorably once again.

A sharp-eyed netizen noticed Nathan Blackwood had liked a "stunning portrait" of himself. The image, shared by a fan shipping Nathan and Evelyn Sinclair, showed him during a press conference.

Nathan sat in the boardroom, dressed in a charcoal gray suit that accentuated his aristocratic bearing. His hands were clasped together, the Solitaire ring glinting prominently on his left ring finger. The internet exploded.

He'd worn that ring - Evelyn's favorite symbol of independence - on his wedding finger for months. The ring finger closest to the heart. Back then, no one had batted an eye. Nathan hadn't been pretending.

NovelDreams Publishing content.

Nathan seized every opportunity to show the world how deeply he cherished Evelyn. Moments later, everyone watched as his personal account reposted Sterling Enterprises' official promotional content.

With the Blackwood heir personally endorsing it, the ad campaign's impact was seismic. Click rates shattered records within minutes. First improving public opinion, then driving web traffic - Blackwood Industries' strategy appeared self-sacrificing but achieved mutual benefit. Their own product launches went unmentioned.

The corporate image wasn't just salvaged - the public's vitriol faded. Sophia Blackwood became completely dissociated from the company. By afternoon the next day, Blackwood stocks rebounded, rising in tandem with Sterling Enterprises'.

The crisis resolution stunned industry PR experts. How had Blackwood Industries emerged unscathed? It defied belief!

Inside Blackwood Tower, Nathan stood silhouetted against floor-to-ceiling windows, his expression unreadable. The staff had dispersed, leaving only Harrison and Theodore Winslow.

"Public sentiment is controlled, sir," Harrison reported. "The conversation has shifted to Sterling's new products and our company's accountability. Still no response from Sterling Enterprises."

A response from Evelyn would be the perfect conclusion.

Nathan's voice cut like ice. "Expecting forgiveness after causing harm? That's true shamelessness." Given Evelyn's temperament, she'd shown remarkable restraint by not slapping him. Theodore trembled nearby. "Absolutely, Mr. Blackwood!"

Theodore was sweating bullets - this disastrous PR strategy had been his brainchild. The billions in losses? He couldn't repay that in ten lifetimes. Nathan's glacial gaze swept over him. "Get out."

Theodore practically tripped over himself escaping. "Right away, sir!"

Evelyn, the true victim, had relinquished control of the narrative once public outrage turned against Sophia and Blackwood Industries. She left their PR team to clean up the mess.

She knew better than anyone - Blackwood Industries wouldn't collapse so easily. A financial blow would suffice, enough to make them remember this lesson.

If Evelyn wanted to topple the Blackwood empire, vague public opinion wouldn't cut it.
###Chapter 791

Continuing like this was pointless.

Better to let things be. That way, Blackwood Industries wouldn’t find an excuse to retaliate and crush Sterling Enterprises.

Their PR team had been shockingly effective. They were even promoting Sterling’s ads now?

The humble act won over the public.

Amusing.

Lucas was baffled, but Evelyn remained indifferent to Blackwood Industries’ overwhelming response.

She simply instructed her team to stock up on inventory.

"This is it? Just like that? Those Blackwood people are so shady! How can you just let it go?"

Evelyn chuckled, glancing at him. "Of course I can."

Lucas scoffed.

"Women are so fickle. You were furious before, and now you’re smiling?"

He had hoped to see Nathan humiliated.

Begging on his knees would’ve been perfect.

Lucas would’ve filmed it and posted it everywhere. Let the world see Nathan Blackwood get what he deserved.

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly as she lowered her gaze.

Her tone was light. "I did a rough calculation. Blackwood Industries lost at least 870 billion. Our stocks rose. Including profits, we gained around 200 billion."

She tilted her head. "If they can stomach that loss, my little grudge is nothing, don’t you think?"

Besides, Preston Sinclair had been the real target.

Yet Sterling Enterprises reaped the benefits.

Preston was low-key, his assets concentrated in Pacifica. He gained nothing from this—just a tarnished reputation.

Lucas’s lips twitched.

So my sister sold her pride for 200 billion?

Pity he didn’t get to see the show he’d imagined.

Evelyn knew better.

Nathan’s dramatic online act wasn’t his idea.

Theodore Winslow’s doing, no doubt.

No corporate PR team would resort to such theatrics.

As they spoke, the butler entered.

"Miss, Mr. Sinclair is here to see you."

Evelyn smiled. "Let him in."

Lucas mused, "He visits so often. Think he’s just here for free meals?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Ask him yourself."

Lucas recoiled. "No way! You want Dad to kill me?"

She snorted. Coward.

Preston entered as rain began to fall.

Dark clouds loomed, but he walked in with effortless grace.

A distinguished gentleman, bathed in the dim light breaking through the storm.

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned.

"Sorry to intrude," Preston said. "Feeling better today?"

Though she hadn’t stayed hospitalized, doctors checked on her daily. Her meals were meticulously planned.

Health wasn’t a concern.

"I’m fine. Father returns from his fishing trip later. You should stay for dinner."

Preston’s sharp profile softened as he chuckled. "No, thank you. I came to see you before leaving. Some matters require my attention in Pacifica."

Evelyn frowned.

Lucas raised a brow. "Trivial matters need you personally?"

Preston hesitated, then laughed. "Oliver got into a fight at school. His teacher demanded a parent. He hired three different men to play his father—got caught immediately."
###Chapter 792

Evelyn and Lucas exchanged startled glances.

That sounded exactly like something little Oliver would do.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Then you'd better hurry. Oliver must be worried sick. Is your flight tonight?"

Preston nodded, checking his watch.

"Yes, I'm leaving right now. Call me immediately if anything happens." Evelyn gave a quick nod. Preston said a few more words before rushing off.

Sophia's little stunt hadn't affected Preston in the slightest. He couldn't care less about Blackwood Industries' reaction. As long as Evelyn was happy, nothing else mattered.

Nathan kept calling Evelyn, but she refused to answer. His messages vanished into the void. Her cold indifference said it all.

After days of silence, Nathan finally snapped. He stormed over to Sterling Manor, only for the butler to inform him bluntly, "Ms. Sterling has gone to Sandford."

She went back to the city that nearly killed her? Nathan's chest tightened violently. His mood darkened instantly.

In the car, Theodore eyed him warily. "Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should reconsider. Ms. Sterling might not be in the mood to see you right now."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "She never is."

Theodore sighed. "Distance makes the heart grow fonder. Once her anger fades, she might—"

Nathan shot him a glare.

If not for Theodore's disastrous suggestion—and the fact that Theodore had somehow managed to clean up the PR mess—Nathan would have tossed this irritating man into the River Aurora to feed the fish.

"Any updates on Reginald?"

Theodore straightened, remembering he was now handling Mitchell's duties. "Yes. Harrison mentioned that Reginald has been in frequent contact with other Blackwood family members. Since you didn't restrict his visitors, the guards didn't intervene."

Theodore hesitated. The cutthroat politics of wealthy families were more brutal than he'd imagined. Even blood relatives couldn't be trusted. He pitied Nathan.

Nathan pulled out his phone, glanced at it, then ordered the driver, "Take us to Sandford."

Theodore tensed. Nathan was going after Evelyn. Again.

"But Mr. Blackwood, what about Reginald—?"

Reginald was busy plotting against Nathan, yet Nathan acted oblivious. Was that wise?

Nathan's voice was ice. "Let him scheme. I want to see how far he can go."

Blackwood Industries wasn't the same empire it had been thirty years ago. Did Reginald really think he still held power? Fine. Nathan would let the traitors reveal themselves—and crush them all at once.

The driver didn't hesitate. The car turned toward Sandford.

Evelyn hadn't planned to go personally, but the Sandford project was on the brink of collapse. Reporters swarmed the construction site. One misstep, and the entire venture would implode.

Though Jonathan Reeves was competent, he was older, slower to react. Under pressure, he'd landed himself in the hospital.

When Evelyn heard, she nearly laughed in frustration. Sterling Enterprises had invested too much to let this fail. She had no choice but to step in.

Jonathan looked pale and pathetic. When he learned Evelyn was coming, he insisted on joining her.

The exterior setup was nearly complete. Evelyn sat in the car, studying Jonathan. Her voice was frosty.

"I could strangle you right now."
###Chapter 793

Jonathan Reeves hung his head in shame. "I want to strangle myself too, Ms. Sinclair. I'm so sorry for messing up..."

Evelyn Sinclair turned away with a quiet sigh. 'Next time, I'll choose a project director who doesn't look like he's one stress attack away from collapsing.'

The press conference had been set up at the abandoned construction site - a half-finished skeleton of a building that had changed hands multiple times. With minimal decorations, the raw concrete walls created an unintentional industrial chic aesthetic.

Blending into the crowd of staff members, Evelyn remained unnoticed as Jonathan took the stage. He began detailing the project's development history and future prospects.

This controversial Sandford development project had finally landed in Sterling Enterprises' lap after numerous setbacks. Given its impact on the entire city's growth, media scrutiny was intense.

"Mr. Reeves," a reporter called out, "we've heard Zenith Corp's former employees caused disturbances at your offices. Is this related to the project? How does their current treatment compare to Zenith's era?"

Jonathan's posture relaxed slightly. "Of course it's different. Zenith owed their staff nearly a year's wages. We paid those debts from our own funds after acquisition. If we treated them the same, they'd be starving!"

The room chuckled. Then another journalist pressed: "Zenith's executives were arrested for corporate crimes. Did Sterling provide the evidence? Have they been convicted?"

"Sterling Enterprises has operated here for two months," Jonathan countered smoothly. "During acquisition, we report any irregularities to Zenith and relevant authorities. For legal specifics, please consult the courts."

Evelyn exhaled quietly from her position in the crowd. Jonathan was redeeming himself admirably after his earlier blunder.

Then came the key witness - the murderer's wife.

Unrecognized at first, the room erupted when her identity was revealed. Journalists' eyes gleamed like predators spotting prey. As agreed, the woman confessed to all crimes committed for her husband and offered a family apology. In exchange, Sterling would cover her daughter's cancer treatments.

Bennett leaned toward Evelyn, whispering, "President Sinclair, it'll get chaotic during the Q&A. Should we leave?"

"Wait," Evelyn murmured, her delicate brows furrowing. An inexplicable unease prickled at her - this calm felt unnatural.

As the weeping woman finished her statement, thanking Sterling for their compassion, a sudden shout cut through the room:

"She's been bribed! Her husband faces execution, yet she defends Sterling? What did they promise you?"

The atmosphere shifted instantly. Murmurs spread like wildfire. The accusation shattered the carefully constructed narrative, replacing it with suspicion about backroom deals.

"President Sinclair nearly died!" Jonathan's face flushed crimson with anger.

"But she's fine now, isn't she?" the heckler retorted. "With the husband getting executed, who's to say this wasn't all staged? Easy to buy a confession after the fact..."
###Chapter 794

The voice came from a wiry man in a baseball cap who blended in with the locals.

Though he appeared ordinary at first glance, his demeanor stood out sharply from the well-mannered journalists.

Evelyn Sinclair's gaze flickered as she whispered to Bennett, "Find that man and detain him. Then hand him over to the authorities." That wasn't a reporter. More likely a troublemaker sent by Lawrence Sinclair. Bennett hesitated.

"But if I leave you here—" She'd be unprotected. Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'll be fine. No one will notice me. Just make it quick." They'd prepared for many scenarios, but hadn't anticipated someone infiltrating the press pool. Bennett nodded and moved swiftly.

In this charged atmosphere, calling for backup would only draw attention. "Tell us! How much did they pay you to betray your husband?" The baseball cap man kept shouting, riling up the crowd. The widow on stage clearly hadn't expected this.

She'd only agreed to speak after countless people convinced her it was the right move—for her daughter's sake, sacrificing her own reputation. Faced with such public accusation, she froze. The situation escalated within seconds.

The agitator must have had accomplices. Other voices in the crowd began echoing his taunts. Evelyn's brow furrowed as she scanned the reporters. Then—without warning—the man hurled a water bottle at the widow. "Were you in on it? Answer us!"

Chaos erupted instantly. Evelyn's expression darkened. Before she could react, someone shouted, "Evelyn Sinclair's right there! Let's get answers from her!"

Trapped in her wheelchair, Evelyn couldn't dodge the bottle flying toward her face. 'Damn it! Shouldn't have sent Bennett away!' she thought, bracing for impact. 'Sandford must be cursed!'

At the last possible moment, a dark figure blocked her view. The bottle struck his back before clattering to the ground.

All eyes turned to the man shielding Evelyn. The room fell silent. She looked up into Nathan Blackwood's face, shock evident in her features. 'What's Nathan doing here?' He wore an onyx dress shirt, its hem casually tucked into black trousers.

The diamonds on his cuffs glinted coldly. Towering and imposing, his dark eyes held glacial intensity beneath thick lashes—like staring into an abyss. The very image of aristocratic severity.

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, but Nathan turned away first. His voice cut through the room like winter wind. "Bring them in."

Three figures entered—two middle-aged women and a young girl, their eyes red-rimmed. They glared at the widow with barely contained fury before pointing accusingly at the baseball cap man.

"That's Lawrence Sinclair's brother-in-law! He's the one who bribed the murderer to sabotage the construction site! He paid us hush money—820,000 to stay quiet! We recognize him!" The accusation landed like a detonation, sending shockwaves through the crowd.
###Chapter 795

The man in the baseball cap panicked. "That's a lie!"

A young girl who looked barely thirteen stepped forward. Though she tried to keep her composure, her voice shook as she pointed at him in front of the reporters.

"That's him! He's a murderer. To keep his project going, he sacrifices one life every year and covers it up as an accident. My father was a foreigner with no family here—so he killed him!"

The reporters erupted into murmurs. The man's face paled. His accomplices exchanged nervous glances and tried to slip away.

But before they could, Bennett and a team of security blocked their exit.

The press conference had taken an explosive turn. While the reporters were still absorbing the victims' families' accusations, Nathan Blackwood quietly scooped Evelyn Sinclair into his arms and slipped out through a side door. By the time anyone noticed, they were already gone.

Pressed against Nathan's chest, Evelyn inhaled his familiar scent—warm, masculine, and infuriatingly comforting. She wanted to scream, but the chaos inside kept her silent.

The moment they were outside, she struggled. "Put me down, Nathan!"

His arms tightened. His expression was dark, unreadable. "Stop moving."

He'd been losing his mind these past few days. Ignored calls. Unanswered messages. He knew she was still furious with him—that's why he'd come.

And when he saw that water bottle flying toward her, something inside him snapped.

A black Range Rover idled at the curb. Nathan opened the door and lowered her inside with surprising gentleness.

Evelyn's temper flared the second he leaned in. "Get out! I don't need your help!"

Nathan stilled. A slow, dangerous smirk curved his lips. "How exactly are you leaving?"

Her right leg was fractured. Walking even a few steps would be agony.

Evelyn seethed. He was doing this on purpose—taking advantage of her weakness. Even though he'd just saved her, she felt no gratitude.

Not when he didn't deserve it.

Nathan used her silence to his advantage, sliding in beside her and shutting the door. As he turned, Evelyn caught sight of his soaked shirt clinging to his back. The water bottle must have burst open when it hit him.

A flicker of guilt twisted in her chest—but before she could speak, a hesitant voice came from the front seat.

"Ms. Sinclair... long time no see."

Theodore Winslow—Nathan's ever-loyal assistant—looked like he wanted to disappear. If Evelyn knew he'd helped orchestrate this little "rescue," she'd skin him alive.

Her eyes narrowed. "Theodore. What a surprise."

"If you'd prefer, I can—"

"No need." Her tone was icy.

Nathan leaned back, his gaze cutting to the front. His voice was a low command.

"Drive."
###Chapter 796

The driver froze for a split second before hastily starting the engine. Evelyn's brows furrowed deeply.

"Where are we going? My team is still inside. I need to get back!"

Nathan's chiseled features twisted into a mocking smirk.

"Your team? When you were in danger, they were nowhere to be found. They're useless compared to me—"

A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn's eyes. She pressed her lips together. "Did you bring the victims' families here?"

Before Nathan could respond, Theodore chimed in enthusiastically.

"Absolutely, Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood is incredibly devoted to you. He dropped everything at the company when he heard you'd returned to this godforsaken place. The entire ride over, he kept muttering your name under his breath. Honestly, it was touching to witness. Where else would you find a man like that?"

What started as a reasonable explanation quickly spiraled into exaggerated praise. Theodore remained oblivious to Nathan's icy glare and Evelyn's increasingly strained smile. Nathan cleared his throat loudly, cutting off Theodore's rambling. "Do you ever stop talking?"

Theodore paled. 'I've said too much!' He forced an awkward grin. "Well, everyone's got a mouth..."

Evelyn's lips curled slightly, though discomfort lingered in her gaze.

"Regardless, thank you."

Nathan tilted his head, studying her with his usual detached elegance. His sharp jawline and cool demeanor radiated an air of arrogance that grated on Evelyn's nerves.

"Just a 'thank you'?"

'Ugh, he’s insufferable.'

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "You owe me, so this 'thank you' is already more than you deserve."

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly.

The power dynamic had shifted.

Damn Sophia for putting him in this position.

He adjusted his posture, voice carefully measured. "Then... let’s call it even, alright?" His tone was uncharacteristically meek. Theodore nearly winced in sympathy. Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Her phone was still with Bennett, leaving her unable to call. He must be frantic by now. The thought made her frown. She extended her hand, fingers delicate and poised. "Let me borrow your phone."

Nathan didn’t budge. "No."

'Since when did he grow a backbone?'

Evelyn kept her hand outstretched, glaring at him. The silence stretched between them. After a tense moment, Nathan exhaled. Just when she thought he’d finally cave, he placed his large hand over hers instead.

Theodore glimpsed the scene in the rearview mirror and nearly choked. 'Bold move, sir.'

The air in the car thickened. Evelyn tried to pull away, but Nathan tightened his grip. 'Unbelievable.'

His fingers were long and warm, calloused from years of work. The cold glint of the Solitaire ring on his finger contrasted sharply with the heat of his touch. He held on just a second too long before reluctantly releasing her.

Something long buried surged to the surface. His dark eyes locked onto hers, voice rough with emotion.

"I'm sorry."

Two words, heavy with regret.

There was so much more he wanted to say, but none of it could undo what had happened. He never meant to hurt her—he’d wanted to protect her. Yet he’d been used as a weapon against her.

The guilt gnawed at him worse than any physical pain. That’s why he hadn’t let PR intervene immediately. She needed to unleash her anger first.
###Chapter 797

Evelyn found herself trapped in Nathan's intense gaze, the raw emotion in his dark eyes momentarily stunning her.

She quickly regained her composure, her expression turning icy. With deliberate movements, she pulled her hand free and reached for a tissue from the box beside her, wiping her fingers slowly. Nathan's jaw tightened, his eyes shadowed with unspoken frustration.

His lashes lowered, casting faint shadows over the regret in his eyes. "Nathan Blackwood," Evelyn said, her voice sharp as a blade, "not everything can be fixed with an apology. Think about it—how many times have you apologized to me since we met?"

Her words struck deep, making his entire body stiffen. His face darkened, tension coiling in his muscles. He had no defense. In her eyes, he was already condemned. What right did he have to negotiate with her now?

The air in the car grew thick with silence.

Up front, Theodore couldn't stay quiet any longer. For Nathan's sake, he swallowed his pride. "Ms. Sinclair," he began, hesitating before forcing the words out, "the online smear campaign against Mr. Sinclair... that was my doing."

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial, her warmth vanishing completely.

"It was my idea," Theodore continued, choosing his words carefully. "I was misled about Mr. Sinclair's character. Someone fed me lies, and I believed them. Mr. Blackwood only agreed because he wanted to protect you. The situation spiraled beyond our control—Ms. Blackwood and Old Master Blackwood manipulated things behind the scenes..."

He embellished the excuse, careful not to mention the private investigators. That would only make things worse.

Evelyn's tone was cutting. "Did Preston provoke you?"

Theodore shook his head. "No—"

Evelyn leaned back, her posture rigid, her eyes clear and cold. "Mr. Blackwood, you have far more skeletons in your closet than Preston Sinclair ever did. Yet he never resorted to dirty tactics like this. That alone makes him ten times the man you are."

Theodore's face flushed with embarrassment. He was Nathan's man—of course he'd defend his boss. But Evelyn's words were undeniably true, no matter how harsh they sounded.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, his dark eyes calm as if the earlier storm of emotions had never happened. Then, without warning, he turned toward her, his gaze sharp and unyielding.

Suddenly, he closed the distance between them. His long legs took up most of the space, forcing her to instinctively retreat. But he caught her wrist before she could pull away, his grip firm and unrelenting. His voice was low, edged with quiet menace.

"Take it out on me. Punish me however you want. But don't you dare mention Preston Sinclair again." His tone darkened. "He got off easy. I could have ruined him."

The words dripped with cold arrogance.

The mere mention of Preston's name made Nathan's blood boil. Expecting him to bow to Preston? Impossible. The only person Nathan would ever kneel for was Evelyn.

With that, he leaned back in his seat, crossing his long legs, his eyes shutting as if dismissing the conversation. But his fingers remained locked around hers, refusing to let go.

Evelyn yanked her hand free, fury burning in her chest. The audacity of this man—how dare he act so shamelessly after everything?

The car accelerated, merging onto the highway. Evelyn's pulse spiked with unease. Where the hell were they taking her?
###Chapter 798

Evelyn Sinclair had absolutely no desire to speak to Nathan Blackwood ever again.

Her gaze lifted, meeting Theodore Winslow's furtive glance. Before he could look away, Evelyn's voice cut through the tension.

"Theodore, hand me your phone, and I'll let this slide." After all, his vendetta was against Preston Sinclair, not her. She'd already settled the score for herself.

Though Preston had saved her life, she wouldn't betray Sterling Enterprises for him. The Sinclair name stood behind her now.

Theodore hesitated, fingers tightening around his device.

Nathan's warning came from behind, cold and sharp. "Go ahead. Try giving it—"

Evelyn's temper flared. "Nathan Blackwood, do you really think my people won't notice I'm missing? They'll find me soon enough."

Nathan's eyes flickered open.

Dark, unreadable, dull with exhaustion. "Is being with me truly that unbearable?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "If our positions were reversed, would you be so eager to stay?"

He considered it for a moment. "Yes."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Forget it. Arguing with this man is pointless. She leaned back, frustration simmering beneath her skin. One of these days, he's going to be the death of me. I swear, I won't let him off easy.

Having said his piece, Nathan closed his eyes again, retreating into silence. The car fell still, the smooth hum of the engine lulling Evelyn toward drowsiness.

She knew it was reckless, but exhaustion won. Her breathing steadied, her body relaxing into sleep.

The moment her breaths deepened, Nathan's eyes snapped open. He studied her, then carefully loosened his grip on her wrist. She didn't stir.

His expression softened, a rare tenderness surfacing. If only she weren’t so stubborn. If only she’d spare me half the patience she gives Preston...

He reached for the blanket beside him, draping it over her with deliberate care. His gaze dropped to her injured leg, and his jaw clenched. The sight of it still made his chest tighten.

A sharp glance at Theodore conveyed his next order.

Theodore understood immediately. He pulled up Bennett’s number and typed out a message.

"Mr. Blackwood will return Ms. Sinclair shortly."

Not a word more.

Nathan hadn’t wanted to say anything at all. He’d never liked Bennett—always hovering around Evelyn like a shadow. What if the man had ulterior motives?

But Theodore had insisted. If this incident spread to the Sinclair family, Nathan’s reputation would suffer. The Sinclairs already barely tolerated him. Reluctantly, Nathan had agreed.

The drive should have taken two hours. They arrived in ninety minutes.

Nathan’s displeasure was immediate. A frigid glare at the driver sent the man stiffening in his seat, too afraid to even glance back.

Evelyn was still asleep.

At Theodore’s signal, their car circled the city aimlessly.

Less than twenty minutes later, they were intercepted.

Luxury vehicles blocked their path at an intersection, the scene unfolding like something out of a high-stakes thriller.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Theodore swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood, this—"

His voice disturbed Evelyn’s rest. Nathan’s glare silenced him instantly.

The car’s blackout curtains kept the interior pitch-dark. Evelyn stirred, blinking in confusion.

Nathan’s hand brushed hers, his voice deceptively gentle, as if their earlier argument had never happened.

"Awake?"

The tone was soothing, familiar.

"Preston?" The name slipped out before she could stop it.

The temperature in the car plummeted.

Ice filled the air.
###Chapter 799

Theodore coughed violently at the mention of Preston Sinclair's name.

His finger pressed the automatic window control. Sunlight flooded the car, bright and relentless. Evelyn Sinclair instinctively shut her eyes against the glare.

Memories rushed back—the last thing she remembered before falling asleep. Oh... This is Nathan's car...

When she opened her eyes again, Nathan Blackwood's dark, stormy expression filled her vision. His jaw was clenched, eyes burning with suppressed fury. Without a word, he shoved the car door open and stepped out.

The Sterling family's entourage emerged from their vehicles. Nathan straightened his suit jacket and gave a curt nod. "Alexander."

Alexander Sterling's mouth twisted. His mood had been foul since discovering Evelyn sneaked off to Sandford without telling anyone. By the time he'd tracked her down, it was too late.

Then came the news—Nathan had taken her. Cut off all contact with the Sterlings.

They'd burned through favors to access highway surveillance before pinpointing her location.

Nathan had been driving circles around downtown. The man was unhinged. "Mr. Blackwood, you're clearly preoccupied. That little online scandal must not concern you."

Alexander's tone was ice. Nathan ignored the hostility, offering a polite smile instead.

Of all the Sterling brothers, Alexander's temperament most mirrored Nathan's. That earned him Nathan's respect.

And as Evelyn's eldest brother? Even more so. "What's done is done. We can only treat it as a warning—no rewrites. Though I've caused you unnecessary trouble, Alexander."

Nathan's repeated use of his first name made Alexander's eye twitch.

"If you truly wish to avoid causing trouble, stay away from my sister. Your family's harassment has already put her in danger." Had Evelyn not orchestrated her own revenge—had she not been satisfied with the outcome—Alexander wouldn't have let this end with Sophia Blackwood's exile.

Nathan remained calm. "I'll visit Sterling Manor to apologize."

"Don't bother. My family would prefer your absence." The disrespect was deliberate. Nathan's expression darkened.

Tension thickened the air.

Then—a soft, sleepy voice. "Brother... carry me."

Nathan turned. Evelyn stretched her arms toward Alexander, who instantly softened. He bent, lifting her from the car.

Seeing her unharmed—cheeks flushed, eyes bright—eased Alexander's anger.

Nathan watched the stark contrast between how Evelyn treated him versus her brother. He swallowed the bitter jealousy. Alexander is family. This is normal.

As Alexander walked past, Nathan didn't stop him. He could've taken Evelyn back. Could've locked her away in his world.

But that wasn't what he wanted.

He wanted her standing beside him—willingly. As equals. Loved. Cherished. Their bond unbreakable. He'd had her once. He'd have her again.

"Evelyn." Her name tore from him. He couldn't let her leave so easily.

Alexander paused but didn't turn.

Evelyn glanced back. Her gaze was sharp, clear. Nathan's chest ached.

Even if the words made him cringe, they needed saying. His voice was low, rough with emotion. "There's no room in my heart for anyone else... not with you in it."
###Chapter 800

Evelyn's face twisted in fury. Her glare pierced through Nathan like a thousand needles.

She wanted to scream at him.

She wanted to vomit.

Alexander remained composed, letting out a quiet scoff.

He ignored Nathan completely and stepped forward. Then, with deliberate mischief, he twisted Nathan's words into something entirely different.

"He's saying you've gotten too heavy. That you take up too much space now."

Evelyn snapped.

"Nathan Blackwood, go to hell!"

She wanted to bite him.

Calling her fat was like insulting a fashion icon's taste or questioning a woman's self-discipline.

Sure, she'd been indulging lately—skipping the gym, enjoying lavish meals—but everyone around her swore she'd lost weight.

'Nathan Freaking Blackwood. Not just infuriating, but blind too.'

Nathan, oblivious to Alexander's jab, stared at Evelyn in confusion.

His chest tightened.

He'd mustered every ounce of courage to say those shamelessly romantic words—something utterly foreign for a man like him.

The line of cars ahead vanished down the road.

Nathan stood frozen, looking wounded.

His tall, imposing figure cut a striking silhouette against the cityscape.

Theodore cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood, shall we head back?"

Nathan climbed into the car, his expression stormy. The tension in the vehicle eased slightly.

"Why is she mad this time?"

The question was clearly directed at Theodore.

Theodore stiffened. "Ms. Sinclair... probably held it in the entire ride."

'She's been wanting to curse you out since the beginning.'

Nathan shot him a sharp look.

Theodore backtracked instantly. "Or—maybe she was overwhelmed by your heartfelt confession?"

Nathan stared at him like he'd lost his mind.

"Do I look stupid to you?" His voice was ice.

Theodore shriveled under the pressure.

"You don't say sweet things often, so Ms. Sinclair isn't used to it yet. You'll have to shower her with affection more—flatter her, charm her. We can't let that snake Preston Sinclair outshine you!"

Preston had the upper hand when it came to smooth talk. Nathan was at a clear disadvantage.

Silence filled the car.

Nathan closed his eyes, deep in thought. Theodore exhaled in relief—it seemed his excuse had worked.

Back at Blackwood Industries, Nathan headed straight to his office. Harrison intercepted Theodore.

"Theodore, there’s been chatter about our PR strategies lately. Last time, half the credit was yours. You wouldn’t betray Mr. Blackwood, would you?"

Such betrayals were common in their world.

Public perception was everything—it could resurrect the dead or bury the living.

If word got out about Theodore’s skills, competitors would swarm to poach him.

As Nathan’s right-hand man, Harrison had to monitor loyalty.

Theodore sighed dramatically. "Mr. Blackwood and I are inseparable. Nothing could break our bond. His trust in me goes beyond employer and employee—why would I leave?"

His matchmaking business wasn’t even launched yet.

Being his own boss was far better than working under someone else.

After a pause, Theodore added solemnly, "Not even for money."

Who could possibly offer more than Nathan Blackwood?

Staying by Nathan’s side meant power. Those trying to recruit Theodore were just kissing up to Nathan.

Right now, Theodore answered to only one man—and stood above everyone else.

He was addicted to this position.

The rush of superiority was intoxicating.
###Chapter 801

Nathan gave Theodore a deadpan stare. 'Forget it... Seems I was worrying for nothing.'

Theodore would never betray him.

Reginald Blackwood was hell-bent on removing Nathan from Blackwood Industries' leadership. He tapped into his old network, bringing in retired executives while hunting down those Nathan had sidelined. Within days, the corporation became a battlefield of whispered alliances.

High-ranking executives gambled their careers with each choice. Lower-level employees? Their loyalty meant little in this power play.

Yet Nathan remained unfazed by his grandfather's maneuvers. Multiple warnings reached him daily. He dismissed them all with icy calm.

Without any visible counterstrategy, his allies grew restless. But Nathan's position was unshakable. He'd transformed Blackwood Industries from a shadow player into a global powerhouse - an achievement Reginald's generation could never claim. The young talent Nathan nurtured? They thrived on meritocracy, not nepotism.

Reginald's outdated "who you know" mentality? It promoted unqualified relatives to executive roles. No self-respecting professional would tolerate that. While others panicked, Nathan scrolled through his phone.

Evelyn had posted a photo of her healing leg on social media. The caption read: "Grateful for your concern. Recovery's going well." Overwhelmed by messages, she'd made this public update. The image showed her walking with crutches.

Nathan's thumb hovered over her profile. Only this post remained visible - her account was set to three-day visibility. His jaw tightened. Damn privacy settings. He hit 'like' on the sole available post.

Then he commented: [That leg could fall off and you'd still be the most stunning woman alive.] Theodore's advice? 'Flattery works.'

These words came from Nathan's heart. Surely Evelyn would be touched. He didn't see her furious blush when she read it.

The bastard made it sound like she was dying!

Her reply appeared instantly: [Go to hell!] 'That man exists to infuriate me!'

Satisfied, Nathan set his phone down. His gaze shifted to Harrison and Theodore in his office. "Report."

Harrison's eye twitched after his lengthy earlier briefing.

Theodore shot him a sympathetic look. Harrison adjusted his glasses with practiced calm. "Mr. Blackwood, your grandfather held private meetings with all department heads. As instructed, we've secured full recordings."

Nathan's smirk was glacial. "What's the old man offering?"

He wanted to measure Reginald's desperation. Harrison remained expressionless. "Twenty percent salary hikes. Annual stock bonuses. He's demanding they organize employee strikes during his birthday gala."

A derisive snort. "Delusional."
###Chapter 802

Reginald Blackwood's petty maneuvers within Blackwood Industries barely registered on Nathan's radar.

Nathan knew his grandfather wouldn't dare escalate matters. A media scandal would tarnish Blackwood Industries' reputation beyond repair. Yet the old man's scheme worked precisely because exposure would force Nathan to remain as CEO indefinitely - a headache he didn't need. Theodore Winslow fretted openly. What if Nathan got ousted?

"Mr. Blackwood, we should've prepared countermeasures earlier. How could your own grandfather conspire with outsiders against you? Has he lost his mind—?" Theodore's blunt words hung in the air as Nathan's expression darkened. Harrison cleared his throat pointedly, cutting off the tactless remark.

"Chairman Blackwood remains chairman until he formally resigns," Harrison emphasized. The seasoned assistant never let his guard down - not before resolution, not after. His meticulousness had served Nathan flawlessly for years, earning his reputation as Blackwood Industries' most valuable executive.

Theodore scratched his head, muttering about the complexities of wealthy families. Maintaining power wasn't easy - neither the fortune nor the CEO title came without constant challenges. Nathan drummed his fingers on the mahogany desk. "Still sending documents daily?" Harrison nodded. "Chairman Blackwood initially raged and shredded them. Now he just tears them quietly. His temper seems... stabilized."

"Stabilized?" Nathan's lips curled skeptically. The cunning old fox was anything but stable.

Harrison's phone buzzed mid-report. His gaze remained impassive. "Sir, Adrian Blackwood has arrived. He's at the—"

Before he could finish, the door burst open. No security dared stop the wildcard heir. "Uncle Nathan! Surprise visit!" Adrian announced cheerfully.

Theodore gaped at the reality TV star whose shows he binge-watched during meals. Though nephew and uncle shared striking good looks, their appeal differed drastically. Adrian radiated boyish charm that made audiences adore him instantly. Nathan's beauty was more dangerous - an arresting presence that commanded rooms and intimidated rivals.

Nathan's glacial stare should've frozen Adrian in place. Instead, the younger man plopped onto the desk. "Still holding court here? Shouldn't you be doting on Evelyn while she's unwell? Unless... she won't see you?" Adrian's teasing smirk deepened Nathan's scowl.

"Interesting priorities," Nathan countered smoothly. "Especially when tabloids have you entering hotels with that actress from your crew. The photos are... compromising." Adrian's grin faltered. "Uncle Nathan—"

The office collectively held its breath.

Adrian shrugged with forced nonchalance. "Vivian and I are both consenting adults. What's the big deal?" Theodore's jaw dropped further. 'Holy scoop!'

"No issue at all," Nathan agreed mildly. "Except when your father finds out. Then it becomes... problematic." Adrian's cocky demeanor crumbled. He rubbed his neck sheepishly.

Straightening abruptly, he adopted a contrite expression. "Uncle Nathan... I come in peace!"
###Chapter 803

Nathan Blackwood slowly opened his eyes, his expression unreadable.

The silence stretched between them, making Adrian Blackwood fidget nervously. The power disparity between uncle and nephew was painfully obvious.

After an unbearable pause, Adrian finally cracked. "Grandfather Reginald approached me. He wants me to take your position, Uncle Nathan. You're in serious danger!"

Harrison remained motionless, merely raising an eyebrow.

Theodore Winslow barely managed to keep his composure. 'So blunt?' Nathan calmly lowered his gaze, showing no surprise. "And?"

Adrian's face twitched. "Well—"

Nathan's dark eyes locked onto his nephew.

"Your father's health is failing. He can't handle pressure. You're the only viable puppet Grandfather can use." Nathan's lips curled slightly. "Why should I be concerned?"

Adrian felt the insult like a physical blow. 'I came here in good faith! Is this how he treats family?' "Uncle Nathan! You're being—you're being completely unreasonable!"

A cold smile touched Nathan's lips. "Do you actually want my position? It's not impossible. If you side with Grandfather, you might have a shot—"

Nathan's words were deceptively mild.

The truth was stark—Reginald Blackwood's chances of success were practically nonexistent. Aligning with him would be political suicide. Worse, it would make Adrian Nathan's enemy.

Adrian couldn't fathom why his grandfather would start this power struggle in his twilight years. Just saying it aloud felt absurd.

And now Reginald wanted to drag Adrian into this mess? Was this some twisted punishment for living comfortably? Even if Adrian had the capability to replace Nathan—which he didn't—Blackwood Industries would collapse within weeks under his leadership.

Adrian had no death wish.

He looked at Nathan with desperation. "My father sent me to seek your advice. You know our branch of the family has no ambitions beyond enjoying life. We don't agree with Grandfather's schemes." His voice turned pleading. "You practically raised me, Uncle! You can't possibly cut me off from the Blackwood name!"

His thriving entertainment career depended entirely on the Blackwood connection. Without that backing, he'd be just another pretty face fighting for scraps.

Nathan remained impassive. At least Adrian and his father were smarter than he'd anticipated.

Seeing no reaction, Adrian panicked.

After a long silence, Nathan finally spoke. "What's in it for me?"

The question hit like a thunderclap. "Benefits?" Adrian gaped. "I'm the one coming to you with information! I'm surrendering! Have you got our roles reversed?"

Nathan sat perfectly still in his crisp white shirt and tailored black pants. His handsome face showed no emotion save for that chilling smile. "I didn't summon you. You came voluntarily."

The rules were simple—whoever begged first lost. And Nathan always made the rules.

Adrian felt his worldview shatter.

Harrison showed no reaction—this was standard behavior for Nathan Blackwood. Bargaining with him was pointless; no offer could tempt him.

Adrian swallowed hard, staring at his uncle.

Nathan truly lived up to his reputation as a ruthless businessman. Thank God Adrian had chosen surrender—any other path would have left him obliterated beyond recognition.
###Chapter 804

The office was thick with tension. Adrian Blackwood hesitated before speaking.

"I could be your informant. I've picked up some things about what the Old Master is planning."

Behind him, Harrison stifled a cough.

"Mr. Adrian, the Chairman is already well aware of Reginald Blackwood's activities."

Adrian's pulse spiked. So Nathan had complete control.

No wonder he hadn't cared about Adrian's surrender.

Adrian swallowed hard. "He's targeting Evelyn."

This was something he'd overheard by chance. A secret no one else knew.

The room plunged into silence so deep even breaths seemed to vanish.

Nathan shot to his feet, his gaze sharp as ice. "Explain."

Adrian lifted his chin, defiance flickering. "Is that valuable enough? I was going to tell Evelyn directly. You're getting a freebie."

He exhaled. "I caught the Old Master whispering with his butler. They mentioned her name, but I couldn't hear details. They were too careful."

Nathan's expression darkened.

His fists clenched, jaw rigid.

Reginald was cunning—and clearly hadn't abandoned his schemes.

After a weighted pause, Nathan's voice cut through the quiet. "Leave."

Adrian didn't move. "Uncle Nathan, the scandal with Vivian and me is spreading. You have connections at Horizon Media. Can you help—?"

Nathan's face remained stone.

"Vivian Lockwood isn't worth your time. She played Tristan for a fool. Stay away."

Just the mention of her made Nathan's disdain flare. She'd once urged Evelyn to leave him, to "find herself."

As if.

Vivian had built her entire career on the wreckage of her marriage.

Manipulative.

Adrian scowled. "Tristan messed up first. Regret won't fix that. Why shouldn't I be with Vivian? We love each other."

Knowing Nathan wouldn't budge, he turned sharply and strode out.

Harrison escorted him politely. Adrian muttered under his breath, "No wonder Evelyn keeps her distance. What woman could stand that attitude?"

Harrison paused. "The Chairman treats Ms. Sinclair differently."

Adrian scoffed, shooting him a look.

"If Uncle Nathan knows everything about the Old Master, why isn't he acting?"

Harrison offered a practiced smile.

"The Chairman still respects Reginald Blackwood. Until he makes a move, the Chairman won't intervene."

Adrian rolled his eyes. Harrison was clearly dodging the question.

"Fine. Thanks for nothing, Harrison."

"Safe travels, Mr. Adrian."

Harrison watched Adrian's car disappear before his smile dropped. He headed back upstairs.

Inside the office, Theodore Winslow was still processing the bombshell. Nathan was already shrugging into his coat.

"Mr. Blackwood, where are we going? Should I come?"

Nathan's tone was clipped. "Sterling Manor."

He needed to warn Evelyn. Who knew what Reginald was capable of?

Harrison stepped in just then. "Ms. Sinclair isn't home. She's at the Phantom Lounge for a meeting with a Gremlin executive."

Nathan's brow furrowed. "A social event?"
###Chapter 805

The Sterling family would never allow Evelyn Sinclair to attend a social gathering while she was still recovering.

Besides, she didn’t need to.

Harrison nodded. "I heard the other party is a woman who specifically requested Ms. Sterling. I’ve already done a background check on Pacific Crest Enterprises."

Nathan Blackwood’s expression darkened. "Did your people see her?"

Harrison hesitated. "N-No..."

Nathan gave him a cold look before grabbing his jacket and striding out.

Harrison shot Theodore a nervous glance. Understanding immediately, Theodore followed.

"Mr. Blackwood, wait for me!"

Phantom Lounge

Though the meeting was supposed to be one-on-one, Evelyn brought Bennett as a precaution.

When they arrived at the private room, Bennett opened the door for her.

Evelyn stepped inside—and froze.

Reginald Blackwood sat there, waiting.

She arched a brow, composed herself, and walked in with measured steps. "Chairman Blackwood, are you the new CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises?"

She had been expecting the CEO of Pacific Crest, not Nathan’s grandfather.

Reginald smiled. "I borrowed her name to invite you. Otherwise, would you have come?"

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly, but she didn’t react beyond that.

She took the seat across from him.

Now free of her wheelchair, she walked with only a cane, her movements graceful. Her recovery had been swift—far quicker than Nathan’s lingering frailty.

"Take a look. What would you like to order?"

Reginald studied her with narrowed eyes. Evelyn ignored the menu.

"No need. I doubt you went through all this trouble just to share a meal."

His expression stiffened briefly before smoothing back into practiced calm.

His gaze flicked to Bennett behind her. "There’s something I’d like to discuss... privately."

Bennett didn’t move, waiting for Evelyn’s cue.

She smiled. "Isn’t this private enough? Bennett is my person. If you’re uncomfortable, then don’t say it. Honestly, I’m not particularly interested in whatever you have to say."

Anyone with half a brain knew about the power struggle within Blackwood Industries. What else could Reginald want from her now?

He had already called William Sterling, but William hadn’t even bothered to humor him, bluntly refusing to get involved.

Evelyn held the real power in Sterling Enterprises.

Whether personally or professionally, she was the perfect counter to Nathan.

Reginald wanted to strike where it would hurt Nathan the most. His grandson was still too green.

Though irritated by Evelyn’s attitude, Reginald knew it stemmed from the way she’d been treated during her marriage to Nathan.

He had no choice but to endure it—for now.

"Very well..."

Reginald exhaled, steadying himself before continuing.

"I’ve always regretted what happened between you and Nathan. I’ve said many times that I hoped you two could reconcile. Such a shame..."

He sighed dramatically.

Evelyn remained silent, watching him with a polite, unreadable smile.

What a performance. Get to the point.

Reginald met her gaze. When she didn’t bite, he abandoned the pretense.

"Of course, your personal affairs are your own. I’ve accepted reality. Those three years in the Blackwood family... perhaps you two simply weren’t meant to be."
###Chapter 806

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

So Reginald Blackwood was finally showing his fear—the fear that she and Nathan might reconcile.

"From what I know, Nathan isn't the type to give up easily. He's obsessed with what he can't have, but the moment he gets it, he loses interest. If you truly want him to let go, you'll need a different approach."

The old man's gaze was sharp, honed by decades of ruthless business dealings.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "A different approach? What exactly are you suggesting?"

"Make him watch you move on with someone else. It'll destroy him. Or strip him of his power—then he won't have the means to interfere in your life anymore."

Her smile faded as she studied Reginald.

Seeing her interest, he leaned back, satisfied. "You're close to Adrian, aren't you? If the two of you pretended to be together, Nathan would lose his mind."

Evelyn paused, her eyes narrowing. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood—is Nathan really your grandson?"

The old man was willing to strike at Nathan's weakest point without hesitation. Ruthless.

Fascinating.

Reginald stiffened, forcing an uncomfortable smile. "Of course. I'm only thinking of both of you. If you don't make him give up, how will either of you move forward?"

Evelyn chuckled. "How considerate of you."

He took a slow sip of tea. "So, do you think my plan will work?"

"Not interested," she said bluntly.

His grip tightened on the cup. His voice darkened. "Meaning what? Don't tell me you still have feelings for him."

Evelyn smirked. "Why don't you test your theory on him yourself? Since taking over Sterling Enterprises, I've been too busy to even breathe, let alone play these childish games with you."

'Cooperate with him? Not a chance. Why would I waste my time on something so pointless?'

"This benefits you too," Reginald snapped.

"How?"

"Do you want Nathan harassing you indefinitely? You despise him, don't you?"

The implication was clear—if she helped destroy Nathan, she'd be free of him for good.

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the rim of her cup, feigning contemplation.

"Honestly, Nathan isn't the only nuisance in my life. Why should I go to such extremes? Besides, damaging relations between our families wouldn't be good for business. Don't you agree?"

Reginald hadn't expected her to be so indifferent. She was proving far more difficult than anticipated.

He exhaled sharply. "If you won't act, then at least help me remove him from power. I'll have Adrian take his place. The result will be the same—mutually beneficial."

'Interesting.' Evelyn's brows lifted. 'So Adrian is Reginald's chosen successor? He's decent, but nowhere near as capable as Nathan. Is the old man determined to ruin Blackwood Industries?'
###Chapter 807

Evelyn Sinclair arched an eyebrow.

It was clear Reginald Blackwood feared she might reconcile with Nathan.

"From what I know," the old man continued, "Nathan isn't the type to give up easily. He'll chase what he can't have, then lose interest once it's his. If you truly want him gone, you'll need a different approach."

His sharp gaze held decades of calculated wisdom.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "A different approach?"

"Make him watch you move on. Or strip him of his power. Either would destroy him."

Her smile faded as she studied Reginald.

Pleased by her attention, he leaned forward. "You're close with Adrian, aren't you? A staged romance would infuriate Nathan."

Evelyn paused. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood—is Nathan actually your grandson?"

The cruelty of targeting his own bloodline's weakest point was staggering.

Reginald stiffened. "Of course. I'm only thinking of your futures. How else will either of you move forward?"

"How considerate," Evelyn mused.

He sipped his tea. "So? Will you cooperate?"

"I don't think so."

The cup clattered against its saucer. His voice darkened. "Do you still have feelings for him?"

Evelyn laughed. "Test your theory on him yourself. Since taking over Sterling Enterprises, I haven't had time to breathe, let alone play games."

Cooperate with him? Absurd. The effort outweighs any benefit.

Reginald's tone turned sharp. "You'd gain from this."

"Oh?"

"Imagine never enduring Nathan's harassment again. Isn't that what you want?"

She traced the rim of her cup, feigning contemplation.

"Honestly, Nathan isn't my only nuisance. And damaging Blackwood Industries helps no one. Surely you agree?"

His jaw tightened. She was proving more stubborn than anticipated.

"Fine. If you won't act, then help me remove him. Adrian will assume control. The result remains the same."

Interesting. Evelyn's brows lifted. So Adrian's the chosen heir? A weaker successor dooming Blackwood Industries. How poetic.
###Chapter 808

Evelyn should have realized it earlier. How could Reginald Blackwood make such outrageous demands without preparation?

She was trained in combat. If her leg hadn't been injured, she could take down ten more men without breaking a sweat.

Reginald knew she was impaired—that she couldn’t move swiftly.

That’s why he only brought two guards.

If Evelyn had agreed to let Bennett leave from the start, Reginald probably wouldn’t have allowed him to walk away.

The realization struck her like lightning.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. She turned her gaze toward Reginald, stepping closer with deliberate grace. Her voice softened, laced with false deference.

"Reginald, why make this so unpleasant? If I’ve offended you, just say it outright. I’ll correct my behavior."

His lips curled in a sneer. He saw her shift in demeanor and mistook it for fear.

His guard lowered.

"Good. You finally understand. Nathan is fond of you, so he tolerates your temper. But don’t mistake his indulgence for weakness. There will always be those greater than you—those who won’t coddle you. If you weren’t William Sterling’s daughter, I would’ve—"

Evelyn moved.

Fast.

Reginald barely had time to react before she was in his space, her cane raised. His face paled, his body stiffening in the chair.

The cane didn’t strike his face.

Instead, it hovered, a silent threat.

Then, in one fluid motion, she was behind him, the cane pressing hard against his chest, pinning him in place.

Bennett seized the moment, swiftly binding Reginald’s hands. The old man’s furious glare burned into him.

Evelyn’s voice was ice. "What exactly would you have done to me, Reginald? Do you think I care about the Blackwood name? If I hadn’t been foolish enough to love Nathan once, would your family even deserve to stand beside the Sterlings?"

She was holding back.

If not for his age, she would’ve beaten him senseless. But she wasn’t in the mood for murder charges today.

Reginald’s breath hitched. "I thought your leg was useless."

Evelyn laughed. "Even crippled, I’m still more than you can handle."

That was all the explanation he deserved.

Reginald’s face darkened with rage. His chest heaved as he glanced at the two men by the door.

They stood frozen, stunned by the sudden turn of events.

Reginald gasped dramatically, as if struggling to breathe.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Stop the act. You’re healthier than most. Pity—good men die young, but men like you live forever."

His breathing steadied. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "What do you want? Fine. You’ve won. Today’s negotiations are over. Leave."

Evelyn smirked.

"Leave? Now that I have you right where I want you?"

His jaw clenched. "What are you planning?"

He sounded so sure of himself. So certain she wouldn’t dare cross the line.

The Sterlings had principles, after all.

Evelyn leaned in, her voice a lethal whisper.

"I think Nathan deserves to know what you’ve done."

Reginald’s face went slack.

Panic flickered in his eyes.

He wasn’t afraid of Nathan discovering his backdoor dealings.

But if Nathan found out he’d gone after Evelyn?

That would destroy everything.
###Chapter 809

The two men at the doorway remained frozen, debating whether to intervene and rescue Reginald Blackwood.

"Seize them!" Reginald's voice cracked like a whip. "Don't let them leave this room!"

Evelyn Sinclair's response was ice wrapped in velvet. "I'd love to see who dares try."

She released her cane and moved with surprising agility despite her injury. The polished wood clicked against marble as she circled the fallen patriarch.

Reginald sneered up at her. "You wouldn't dare lay hands on me."

Evelyn's gaze dropped, colder than winter frost. "Watch me."

Her cane struck the chair's leg with surgical precision. The antique furniture teetered before crashing sideways, sending Reginald sprawling across the floor. His entire body trembled with barely contained fury.

Humiliation burned hotter than pain.

The bodyguards lunged forward just as the door exploded inward. Nathan Blackwood filled the doorway, his expression carved from arctic stone. Theodore Winslow gaped at the scene behind him.

The mighty Reginald Blackwood - feared titan of Wall Street - lay tangled in furniture like common trash. Meanwhile, Evelyn stood poised like a queen, her smile sharp enough to draw blood. Even her crutch gleamed like a scepter in the chandelier light.

The guards recoiled as if Nathan were Medusa herself. They scrambled backward, suddenly fascinated by the wallpaper.

Nathan exhaled through his nose. 'Overestimated the old man. Evelyn's handling him just fine.'

His mouth curved into something too dangerous to call a smile. "Recovery looks promising."

Evelyn arched one perfect brow. "When your family keeps sending get-well gifts, how could I not improve?"

Reginald's face purpled. "Nathan! Are you blind?"

Nathan finally glanced down, hands pocketed, every inch the untouchable prince. Moonlight eyes glinted with something predatory. "Grandfather, you're clearly unwell. Your caretaker's been negligent. I'll have him replaced."

"How dare—"

Nathan didn't wait for the rant. He hauled Reginald upright with the same care one might show a sack of potatoes. Theodore swiftly intervened, steering the spluttering patriarch toward the exit.

Theodore paused beside the petrified guards. "You're dismissed."

They practically tripped over themselves fleeing. Club employees borrowed as intimidation props? Not their circus, not their monkeys. The Blackwoods and Sterlings played in leagues where collateral damage meant bankruptcy or body bags.

Three remained in the gilded cage.

Evelyn's smirk could freeze hell. Bennett stood sentinel behind her, a human shield with a glare that promised violence.

Nathan's jaw tightened at the sight. Annoyance flickered behind his glacial mask. "Grandfather's health is failing. Pay his theatrics no mind."
###Chapter 810

Evelyn arched a brow. "Reginald Blackwood wanted me to team up with Adrian to remove you from your position—"

Nathan's dark eyes flickered, but only at the first part of her sentence.

A reckless smirk curled his lips moments later.

"Too bad for him. Adrian's currently head over heels for another woman."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily thrown. She hadn't even noticed how smoothly he'd redirected the conversation.

Her curiosity got the better of her. "Who?"

Nathan didn't bother hiding it. "Tristan's ex-wife. That infuriating woman."

Evelyn's expression froze. This is... complicated.

A strange mix of emotions churned in her chest.

Still, they were both single. Who was she to judge?

But a wounded soul like Vivian with a playboy like Adrian? That love story would only end in more scars.

"Are you coming or not?"

Nathan had to repeat himself before Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts. "Obviously. And if Reginald pulls this stunt again, I won't hold back. Age doesn't earn him immunity. We're all equals here—what gives him the right?"

Nathan nodded solemnly.

"Don't hold back. I've got your back." Is he trying to provoke me?

Evelyn barely had time to react before Nathan suddenly scooped her up. She gasped. "Nathan Blackwood, you absolute—!"

Nathan chuckled, his voice dropping low. "Keep cursing. I love the way it sounds."

Unbelievable.

No one was more shameless than Nathan Blackwood.

Nathan carried her to the elevator, where the Sterling family car waited outside. Bennett trailed behind anxiously.

Just an assistant—powerless against Nathan Blackwood.

Nathan deposited Evelyn into the car, then reached out to brush a strand of hair from her face. His gaze softened. "Your gift."

From his pocket, he produced an elegant box. Inside lay a pink diamond necklace—exquisite, breathtaking. Evelyn couldn't look away.

She barely registered his movements before the cool metal settled against her skin. The necklace complemented her slender neck, fair complexion, and effortless elegance perfectly.

Nathan's satisfaction was palpable. Warmth flickered in his obsidian eyes before he stepped back.

"Goodbye."

He left before she could refuse.

What an infuriating man.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Luxury gifts meant nothing to her. The eight-figure price tag didn't faze her.

But this piece... it was different.

The design was unmistakable—a rare, private collection piece from her favorite niche luxury brand. One of a kind.

Her fingers traced the box's embossed logo. Exactly as she'd guessed.

Wow.

Instant love.

She refused to owe him. A quick transfer to Harrison settled the debt.

Harrison nearly choked on his coffee when the notification popped up. The amount left him speechless.

Discovering the sender was Evelyn only deepened his bewilderment.

Before he could ask, Nathan summoned him for an emergency meeting.

Harrison scrambled to prepare.

When Nathan returned, Harrison approached. "President—"

Nathan strode ahead, Theodore at his heels.

He adjusted his cufflinks, voice cool. "Do you have the list of Reginald's people?"

Harrison nodded. "Yes, but none are department heads. The major departments remain loyal. Only a few restless shareholders are stirring trouble with some new investors. None pose a real threat."
###Chapter 811

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened as he tilted his head to look at Harrison.

"Has Adrian been cooperative?"

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood. Young Master Adrian has been extremely cooperative. He only has one request—that you help conceal his involvement."

Harrison hadn't expected Adrian to be so determined to enter the entertainment industry that he'd abandon his usual adventurous pursuits.

Adrian was clearly infatuated with that woman, unwilling to expose her identity to the public. If the media dug into their past, their relationship would likely crumble.

Nathan scoffed.

"Fine. But if he dares betray me, I'll make sure that woman remarries Tristan."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Understood, sir." This was absolute torture.

Adrian would lose his mind if he heard that.

Nathan rubbed his temples. Theodore approached from the side. "Mr. Blackwood, did Ms. Sinclair like the gift?"

"Find more gifts for her. Eventually, one will catch her interest."

Theodore was stunned by the bold statement but couldn't help feeling impressed. There was no reason Nathan Blackwood couldn't win over a woman.

Then, something clicked in Harrison's mind. He spoke up hesitantly.

"Sir... Ms. Sinclair just transferred a large sum of money."

Silence fell over the office.

Harrison's scalp prickled. His words had doused the enthusiasm like a bucket of ice water. But he had no choice—he couldn’t possibly hide a transaction of 550 million.

Theodore shot him a sharp look before turning back to Nathan with a forced smile. "Perhaps Ms. Sinclair liked it so much she wanted to secure it properly?"

What a ridiculous excuse.

If Evelyn Sinclair wanted to keep something, she wouldn’t need an excuse. She obviously just despised him.

Nathan’s dark eyes turned icy, his expression unreadable.

"Call a meeting."

Sterling Manor

After returning home, Evelyn had Bennett escorted back to his residence.

She slowly walked through the garden, leaning on her cane.

The butler beside her looked concerned.

"Miss, why push yourself like this?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "The doctor said I should exercise more."

"The ground is slippery. Let’s walk inside—it’s warmer there."

She nodded and followed him inside.

Before she reached the door, laughter echoed from the kitchen. It sounded like Natalie was visiting.

"Natalie?"

Natalie poked her head out. "Evelyn! Uncle William is cooking personally!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

William had handed most kitchen duties to Lucas these days, rarely cooking himself. She hadn’t expected him to be in such high spirits today.

William stepped out, grinning. "How did the meeting go? What did Pacific Crest Enterprises say?"

Evelyn chuckled. "The person who came under the guise of Pacific Crest was actually Old Master Blackwood!"

William’s face darkened instantly. "What?"

Evelyn summarized the encounter briefly—omitting the part about the pink diamond.

Alexander, descending the stairs, looked furious, but his refined upbringing kept him from losing his temper at home.

William, however, had no such restraint. He stormed toward the door, still wearing his apron.

"That old bastard! I’ll tear him apart!"

Evelyn rushed to stop him. "Dad, it’s already settled. There’s no need!"

"He still dares to target you? Does he think this is thirty years ago when he held all the power?"

William’s face flushed with rage. He ranted for a full hour before finally calming down.

Fortunately, Lucas had taken over in the kitchen, so dinner was still served on time.

Natalie remained sullen throughout the meal.

"Seriously, is it true that Blackwood Industries is changing leadership?"
###Chapter 812

Lucas frowned. "I don't think it'll come to that. Do you really believe Nathan Blackwood would crumble so easily if Blackwood Industries' leadership could be toppled without a fight?"

William Sterling narrowed his eyes, irritation flashing across his face. "What if we exploit their current vulnerability and make them sweat a little?"

It was clear William was nursing a deep grudge.

Evelyn Sinclair laughed softly, shaking her head. "It's not that simple. Nathan probably knows Reginald Blackwood's every move like the back of his hand. He won't be caught off guard."

Alexander Sterling, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke up. "Not necessarily. If we strike now, we might actually have the upper hand."

William shot his eldest son an approving glance.

At least one of his sons had inherited his strategic mind—unlike Lucas, who seemed determined to undermine his confidence at every turn.

Evelyn hesitated. "Before today, I would've agreed. But now? I want Nathan to win."

If Nathan secured his position, Reginald Blackwood would be furious. And that was exactly the revenge she craved.

Alexander and William exchanged dissatisfied looks, clearly wanting to argue against her emotional reasoning.

But Evelyn cut them off. "Reginald wants to tear Nathan down. We can't let that old schemer get his way. Nathan needs to stay right where he is."

William and Alexander nodded slowly, though something still felt off about the logic.

Lucas chewed thoughtfully on his steak before grimacing. "Is this overcooked?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Natalie made that."

Natalie Beaumont flushed. "Sorry, I—"

Lucas immediately backtracked, shoving another bite into his mouth. "No, no, I love it! The texture is amazing. Perfectly charred."

William and Alexander just stared at him, unimpressed. Even Evelyn shot him a dry look.

After dinner, Evelyn and Natalie strolled through the living room, chatting idly. Lucas trailed behind them like a lovesick puppy, periodically offering fruit and snacks with exaggerated enthusiasm.

Evelyn knew exactly who he was trying to impress. Natalie, flustered, kept her gaze averted, her cheeks tinged pink.

Night had fallen.

When Evelyn announced she was heading upstairs to rest, Lucas sprang to his feet. "The guest room's ready! It's right next to mine!"

He had deliberately converted his study into a guest room—because it was the closest to his own.

Evelyn smirked. "Natalie's sleeping with me. We haven't had a proper girls' night in ages."

Natalie nodded eagerly. "Absolutely."

Lucas's face fell. He gritted his teeth, glaring at his sister. "Evie, you—"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "What?"

Lucas forced a stiff smile. "You two have been talking nonstop all evening. How is that 'not enough'?"

Natalie laughed. "It doesn't count unless it's right before bed."

Evelyn nodded solemnly.

Lucas was being ridiculous. There was no rush.

The two women linked arms and headed upstairs, leaving Lucas to mutter under his breath. "Do you need a third wheel? I could just—"

"Get lost."

They replied in unison.

Lucas sighed dramatically. One was his meddlesome sister, the other the woman he adored.

He was utterly outmatched.

Upstairs, Evelyn and Natalie indulged in their elaborate skincare routines before settling on the balcony with Leo, the AI tiger, purring softly beside them. Soothing music played in the background, creating a serene atmosphere.

Then Natalie's phone buzzed—again.

She scowled, snatching it up. The moment she saw the caller ID, she cursed and silenced it.

Evelyn frowned. "What's wrong?"

"Adrian Prescott," Natalie spat. "He won't stop harassing me for money. Now he's camped outside my apartment."
###Chapter 813

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in surprise. "Borrow money?"

Natalie Beaumont sighed, fingers tracing the edges of her slightly creased face mask.

"Adrian Prescott owes a massive penalty fee. He came crawling to me, begging for help. I pitied him at first, so I gave him the money." Her voice turned sharp. "But instead of paying the fine, he blew it all on cocaine. The man is beyond redemption."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "What happened next?"

Natalie scoffed. "When I found out, I called the police. He spent a few nights in jail, then had the audacity to ask me for more cash the second he got out."

Evelyn tsked. "So that's why you're hiding out here?"

Natalie muttered, "Lucas insisted I stay with him for a while. At least this way, Adrian won’t lose his mind and do something reckless."

Evelyn nodded approvingly. "Good. Stay as long as you need. I'm not moving out anytime soon—we can keep each other company."

Natalie didn’t respond, just exhaled heavily.

"How did I even pick such trash from the gutter in the first place? I must’ve been blind."

Adrian had seemed decent on the surface, but underneath? Pure filth.

Evelyn shrugged. "At least you got out early. If you’d stayed, he would’ve dragged you down with him sooner or later."

Natalie sighed again, struck by how quickly people could change—how fragile trust really was.

After knowing Adrian for years, she’d never suspected he was capable of this. Then, abruptly, Natalie turned to Evelyn. "Between Nathan Blackwood and Preston Sinclair, who do you think is better?"

The question hit Evelyn like a slap. She forced calm into her voice. "What does it matter to me if they're decent or not?"

"You have to pick one eventually. You can’t stay single forever." Natalie raised a brow. "Weren’t you the one who always dreamed of growing old with someone?"

If Natalie had been looking, she would’ve seen Evelyn’s eyes roll so far back they nearly got stuck. "Actually, I’ve decided growing old with a crowd sounds much better."

Silence.

Natalie was momentarily speechless. A year ago, Evelyn would’ve never said something like that.

"I can tell Preston is interested in you. Do you know him well?"

Evelyn hesitated, then shook her head.

"Preston gives off warm, reliable vibes, but I can’t quite read him." A smirk tugged at her lips. "I like his son better, though."

She wondered if that sharp-witted Oliver Sinclair was currently being scolded for something.

After removing their masks, neither woman had the energy to stay up longer. They retreated to their rooms.

Within days, Evelyn could walk without her cane again. The Sandford project still had complications, but construction had begun. Jonathan Reeves kept a close eye on progress.

Evelyn planned to head to the office early, but then a message from Vivian Lockwood popped up.

[The first season of our show wrapped successfully. Ms. Sterling, would you like to join our celebration?]

Vivian had been nothing but kind, so Evelyn couldn’t refuse.

Besides, she’d invested in Vivian’s firm. Skipping the event would only invite unnecessary speculation.

[Sure.]

After weeks of monotony, a party was exactly what Evelyn needed.

Vivian immediately sent the details—a hotel near the set. Not far.

Evelyn redirected her driver.

The moment she stepped out of the car, she spotted a familiar figure shaking hands with someone, exchanging pleasantries after what looked like a business meeting.

Of course.

It was Preston Sinclair.
###Chapter 814

Evelyn instinctively climbed into the car. Being alone with Preston made her uneasy.

Her phone still held countless messages from him—dozens sent daily, most left unanswered. She only replied when time allowed.

Preston's affection was painfully obvious.

Rejecting him repeatedly would only damage their relationship. And after all, he had saved her life.

She owed him. But she refused to repay that debt with her heart.

At least she had enough sense not to rush into dating him. Solitude suited her just fine.

The new driver frowned as Evelyn abruptly exited and re-entered the car. Then it hit him—the butler's strict instructions. A driver must always open the door for the Young Lady. Never let her do it herself.

Failure meant negligence.

Was this a test? Panicked, he bolted out without a word.

One hand behind his back, the other yanking the door open. "Miss, please—"

Before Evelyn could react, the door swung wide. Preston's gaze locked onto hers.

She could only sigh.

Preston's eyes brightened instantly. He stepped forward. Trapped, Evelyn forced a smile and exited. The driver dutifully shielded her forehead.

She shot him a wry look. Unbelievable.

"Evelyn! You're here?" Preston's voice warmed like sunlight. "How's your leg?"

Dignified. Refined. His attention solely on her made her pulse skip.

"Much better," she said lightly. "Walking's no issue now. The show I backed is celebrating tonight. Boredom drove me out."

Preston retrieved her bag from the seat, then instinctively reached to steady her. She sidestepped just in time.

He handed over the bag, hesitating. "Let me escort you up."

A faint smile. "Really, I'm fine. My father wouldn't have let me leave otherwise."

His gentle grin didn't waver. "Then introduce me to your friends?"

Silence.

Preston showed no disappointment. As if he'd expected this. Prepared for rejection.

"Montecito's entertainment sector has potential," he said smoothly. "Breaking social barriers through media is strategic. I've recently invested in it myself. Mind if I... leverage your connections?"

The explanation was polished. Professional.

Doubtful, but it eased the tension.

A mutually beneficial offer? Perfect.

"Of course." Her tone brightened. "Though tonight's just a small gathering. Next time there's something worthwhile, I'll call you."

If money could settle her debt, she'd seize the chance.

Preston's smile deepened, genuine. Then—

A gust of wind lifted a loose strand of her hair. His fingers brushed it behind her ear. Casual. Tender.
###Chapter 815

Evelyn didn't even glance at the bag as she took it, leading Preston inside with purposeful strides.

She filled the walk with an overview of the entertainment industry's current climate. "While I'm no expert, I've heard regulators are cracking down on inflated film salaries."

Preston nodded attentively as she continued. "Stars can't demand outrageous fees anymore. They either improve their craft or find...creative payment methods. Risky business either way."

"Indeed," Preston agreed. "Several A-listers have already crashed spectacularly. Their scandals tanked entire productions. That's why I've been observing the market carefully before investing."

Evelyn suddenly remembered Preston was an actual investor. If he'd been serious about showbiz, he would've done his research ages ago. That earlier excuse had clearly been just that - an excuse.

A pang of disappointment shot through her.

Preston noticed her mood shift and frowned. Had he said something wrong? He tried redirecting. "Any particular stars you admire?"

Evelyn blinked, then straightened. "I don't idolize celebrities. I'm not some starstruck girl - I'm Sterling Enterprises' CEO focused on building my empire!"

The elevator fell silent for a beat before Preston chuckled. "Yes, that much is obvious."

Evelyn's cheeks burned at his amused tone. 'He's totally humoring me! Fine - actions speak louder than words.' She clamped her mouth shut.

Upon arrival, they spotted a familiar figure pacing outside the designated hall. Evelyn squinted. 'Isn't that Tristan Whitmore?'

Tristan turned, his expression freezing when he saw Evelyn and Preston. His gaze flickered between them before settling on Evelyn with forced cheer. "Fancy meeting you here!"

Evelyn peeked inside where a lively crowd mingled, guarded by a bouncer. Understanding dawned. Tristan had been barred entry. She smirked. "Not a coincidence. I was invited. You...?"

Tristan's smile twitched as if he'd been gut-punched. Evelyn always knew exactly where to twist the knife. Only Nathan could tolerate her brutal honesty.

"I was just—" Tristan began.

The bouncer smoothly intervened. "Ms. Sinclair, please come in." He added pointedly, "Mr. Whitmore caused a scene earlier - assaulted staff. The producers had him removed."

Evelyn burst out laughing while Tristan's face darkened like he'd stepped in something foul. "Must you air dirty laundry?" he snapped at the bouncer, who retreated nervously.

"Who exactly are you intimidating, Mr. Whitmore?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Shall we?" She glanced at Preston.

Traditionally, gentlemen escorted ladies by offering their arm. Preston stepped forward without hesitation, extending his elbow. Since it was proper etiquette, Evelyn accepted without fuss.

As they moved to enter, Tristan scrambled after them. "Evelyn, darling, take me with you!"

He'd rather gouge his eyes out than watch those two cozy up inside without him.
###Chapter 816

Evelyn's smile held a knowing edge. "Do you really think that's possible?" She had always been on Vivian's side.

Tristan pressed his lips together, stepping closer. His voice dropped to a whisper meant only for her ears.

"Or I could call Nathan over to handle this."

A dark promise laced his words.

"He won't just throw punches. People die when he loses his temper."

His gaze flicked meaningfully toward Preston, who stood protectively beside her.

Damn Tristan Whitmore. Someone needs to knock him down a peg.

Evelyn's breath hitched. He's threatening me?

But she believed him. Nathan's rage was legendary—unpredictable, destructive.

They hadn't clashed yet, but if they did, the fallout would be catastrophic.

Her smile tightened. After a beat, she turned to the doorman.

"Let Mr. Whitmore in. I'll take responsibility."

With that, she walked away like she was shaking off something vile.

Preston didn't ask questions. Inside, the temperature was perfect—warm enough to shed her coat. He took it from her shoulders, handing it to a nearby waiter with effortless grace. Evelyn murmured her thanks. When she reached for a glass of red wine, Preston stopped her.

"Your leg just healed, and you're still on medication." His tone was firm but gentle. "No alcohol."

She nodded, amused by his protectiveness. It was... refreshing.

He handed her a soda instead. She took it with a smile, but before she could step further into the room, a familiar voice cut through the chatter.

"Evelyn! Where have you been hiding? I've missed you desperately!"

Adrian Blackwood strode toward them, dressed in an impeccably tailored black suit. Tall, effortlessly charming—he looked like a prince straight out of a fairy tale.

No wonder he'd skyrocketed to fame the moment he entered the industry.

His grin was rakish, his eyes full of mischief. He opened his arms wide, ready to pull her into an embrace. Then Evelyn remembered the rumors—Adrian and Vivian were together.

Her lips curved into a sly smirk.

Before Adrian could reach her, Preston extended a hand. "Mr. Blackwood."

Adrian froze, finally noticing the man beside her. His brows knitted together in exaggerated offense.

"Evelyn, I was first in line. How could you let someone cut in?"

She rolled her eyes. Dramatic as always.

Adrian recovered quickly, sizing Preston up. "You know me? Well, I know you too, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston's expression remained polite, his nod courteous.

Their handshake was brief, impersonal.

Adrian leaned in, whispering theatrically, "Look, I still think we're the best match, but honestly? Anyone but my uncle. We can't let him win."

Evelyn arched a brow. Oh, I'm definitely telling Nathan about this.

"Don't worry," she said sweetly. "I'll pass along your thoughts."

Adrian paled. "Uh—no, no need for that—"

If Nathan heard that, Adrian's life would be over.

Just then, the director and Dominic Kingsley approached, glasses of wine in hand.

The show's lineup was still impressive, even after the initial uproar over Evelyn, Nathan, and Xavier's departures.

Once the outrage settled, the audience realized—the new cast was just as compelling.

Each had their own story, their own reasons for starting over.

Because at the end of the day, women like Evelyn and Vivian didn't walk away from their marriages lightly.

They did it because they had no other choice.
###Chapter 817

Vivian Lockwood emerged as the unexpected star of the show, effortlessly solving numerous household dilemmas that left most women stumped. These everyday challenges, suddenly thrust upon the participants, created the perfect dramatic tension.

The ratings skyrocketed beyond expectations, making it the year's most talked-about program.

Dominic Kingsley and the director couldn't stop grinning - their gamble had paid off spectacularly. This success owed much to Evelyn Sinclair's brilliant suggestion of casting Vivian and conceptualizing the show's unique format.

Though Vivian appeared reserved and soft-spoken, her razor-sharp wit and unconventional solutions became the show's biggest draw, earning her legions of devoted fans.

"Ms. Sinclair," Dominic approached with a charming smile, "It's been ages! I wanted to visit, but Lucas warned me you weren't receiving guests."

Evelyn clinked her champagne flute against his with an amused smirk. "Clearly, that was Lucas not wanting to see you."

Dominic feigned offense. "Am I really that unbearable?"

The director burst out laughing. "Don't listen to him, Ms. Sinclair. He's been so buried in production he hasn't had time to breathe, let alone make social calls these past weeks!"

With an elegant gesture, Evelyn introduced Preston Sinclair standing beside her.

The director immediately straightened, recognizing the Wall Street magnate. His demeanor shifted to one of utmost respect. Preston exuded an approachable yet commanding presence - gracious yet powerful, a stark contrast to Nathan Blackwood's icy demeanor.

Seizing the opportunity, the director ventured, "For next season, might we have the honor of featuring both you and Ms. Sinclair?" The potential viewership numbers made his mouth water.

Evelyn smiled knowingly. Preston, fresh from scandal, wouldn't risk appearing opportunistic. She opened her mouth to politely decline.

To her surprise, Preston chuckled. "I'd be delighted to join Ms. Sinclair. Though I believe Mr. Blackwood holds the production rights? If he approves, I have no objections."

The director's enthusiasm evaporated like morning mist. He'd forgotten Nathan's involvement. Suggesting Preston's participation would be professional suicide.

Quickly changing tactics, he turned to Adrian Blackwood. "Young Master Adrian, you'll continue with us next season, yes?"

Adrian played along. "Only if you increase my fee."

"Absolutely!" The director agreed hastily as laughter rippled through the group.

Across the room, Vivian caught Evelyn's eye and waved.

Excusing herself, Evelyn made her way over. Vivian stood with three other actresses - Seraphina Devereux, Arabella Winslow, and Isadora Vanderbilt.

Arabella and Isadora had become audience favorites, though Evelyn knew little about them.

Seraphina, however, was another story.

Evelyn remembered all too well how Seraphina had manipulated Xavier Delmont off the show to secure her permanent spot. The woman knew exactly how to play the game.

To her credit, Seraphina had crafted a compelling persona that resonated with viewers, her popularity surpassing even the producers' expectations.
###Chapter 818

Vivian noticed Evelyn approaching. Her gaze immediately dropped to Evelyn's injured leg, relieved to see no wine glass in her hand.

"Evelyn, how's your injury healing?" Vivian asked with genuine concern.

Evelyn offered a warm smile. "Much better, thank you."

She hesitated before adding, "Alexander mentioned you visited me at the hospital. I'm sorry my brother kept turning you away. Donovan can be... intense."

Vivian waved off the apology. "Don't worry about it. Your recovery is what matters."

The three actresses nearby offered polite greetings, which Evelyn returned with equal courtesy. An awkward silence settled over the group.

The celebrities seemed unsure how to engage with Evelyn, while she equally struggled to bridge the gap. These were women accustomed to constant admiration, yet now they appeared almost nervous around her.

Spotting an opportunity, Evelyn turned to Arabella. "Ms. Winslow, I've admired your work for years. Having you on our show is truly an honor."

Arabella, usually known for her bold personality, suddenly became flustered. She waved her hands dismissively, nearly spilling her wine. "Oh no, Ms. Sinclair, the honor is mine! Truly!"

Her crimson lips parted as she hastily raised her glass. "Let me toast to your excellent taste!" She downed the entire drink in one go while Evelyn watched in stunned silence.

Isadora fidgeted nervously beside them, while Seraphina smoothly interjected with a laugh. "Arabella, you'll scare our host! Remember she's still recovering."

"Right! No drinking!" Arabella agreed too quickly, her eyes wide.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. They'd never met before - why such deference? "Ms. Winslow, your enthusiasm is refreshing. Once I'm fully healed, we'll share a proper toast."

Noticing Evelyn's discomfort, Vivian guided her to a nearby sofa. Evelyn exhaled deeply. "Do I really seem that intimidating?" She touched her face self-consciously. She'd deliberately chosen a simple dress and understated makeup to avoid overshadowing the stars.

Vivian chuckled. "She's just nervous. After years of being blacklisted, this is Arabella's big comeback. Lucas probably warned her not to upset you."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Is my brother telling people I'm some sort of tyrant?" She shook her head in exasperation.

Changing the subject, Evelyn studied Vivian's radiant expression. "I hear your firm is booming? Booked solid?"

Vivian nodded, her eyes sparkling. "Appointments through next spring, but I'm limiting clients. Quality over quantity - the show's success just accelerated what was already happening."

Evelyn smiled approvingly. She'd never doubted Vivian's integrity or talent.

Their conversation was interrupted by approaching footsteps.
###Chapter 819

Evelyn Sinclair froze when she recognized the man standing before them.

Tristan Whitmore.

Vivian Lockwood's expression darkened instantly, all traces of her previous smile vanishing.

"How did you get in here?" she demanded coldly.

Tristan's lips thinned. Just as he was about to speak, Evelyn shot him a warning glare.

He turned away. "I slipped past security."

"You're not welcome here," Vivian snapped.

Tristan scoffed. "You mean you're the one who doesn't want me here."

"At least you understand that much."

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably in her seat. Maybe she should excuse herself.

After a quick assessment of the situation, she decided a strategic retreat was best.

Before she could stand, Tristan ground out through clenched teeth, "What does that pretty boy even offer you? He'll never inherit a cent from the Blackwood fortune. He's just amusing himself with you—"

Crack!

Vivian's palm connected sharply with Tristan's cheek. Her gaze turned glacial.

"Get out! My personal life is none of your concern!"

Tristan's face flushed crimson as he struggled to control his temper.

Just as he opened his mouth to respond, Adrian Blackwood's mocking voice cut through the tension. He'd been watching Vivian from across the room and rushed over the moment he spotted Tristan. That snake was back again.

"Mr. Whitmore, I must say your persistence is... remarkable. Don't you know when to quit?"

Tristan's face darkened at Adrian's arrival. "This is between me and my ex-wife. Stay out of it."

Adrian smirked, his striking eyes glinting with mischief. "Funny, I recall she's my girlfriend now. So I suggest you back off."

The two men squared off, their auras clashing violently.

Tristan, a seasoned businessman who'd navigated corporate warfare.

Adrian, an adventurer who'd survived the harshest wilderness.

In terms of status, Tristan held the advantage.

But Adrian had Vivian's favor—the ultimate trump card between rivals.

"You arrogant little—" Tristan nearly lost control. "Adrian Blackwood! Don't overestimate yourself. What standing do you even have in the Blackwood family? If not for Nathan's protection, I would've crushed you long ago!"

His words were brutal but accurate.

With Nathan Blackwood as the family heir, the rest were mere satellites.

Tristan and his circle respected—and feared—only Nathan, not the Blackwood name itself.

Adrian merely arched a brow, studying Tristan with amused detachment.

He casually draped an arm around Vivian's shoulders, his voice dropping to a husky murmur. "I know I can't compare to you, Mr. Whitmore. But my feelings for Vivian are genuine. Take your anger out on me if you must—just don't hurt her because of me."

The air grew thick with tension. Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief.

Holy hell.

If she hadn't witnessed it herself, she'd think this was some bad soap opera.

Adrian sounded like the heroine in some cheesy romance novel.

The fakeness was palpable.

Tristan looked physically ill from Adrian's performance.

His sharp gaze turned murderous, the killing intent rolling off him in waves.

Even from her seat several feet away, Evelyn could feel the icy rage radiating from Tristan's entire being.
###Chapter 820

Evelyn Sinclair sat quietly, her gaze drifting upward just in time to witness Adrian Blackwood and Vivian Lockwood exchanging a look so intense it could melt steel.

She pressed her lips together and lowered her head, lost in thought.

If Adrian was serious about Vivian, then maybe they deserved a shot.

Relationships didn’t always have to end in marriage. Sometimes, they were just about figuring things out.

Vivian had endured Tristan Whitmore to the breaking point before their divorce. All that remained was bitterness.

Who said a divorced woman couldn’t love freely?

And Adrian? Sure, he seemed reckless, but he wasn’t a bad guy.

Evelyn weighed the two men in her mind and decided she liked the idea of Vivian and Adrian together.

But Tristan was shaking with rage.

Before he could raise a hand against Vivian, Adrian stepped in front of her, shielding her with his body.

"Vivian, you’re incredible. Even if Mr. Whitmore doesn’t appreciate you, I do. I won’t let you feel a single moment of sadness. No matter what comes our way, as long as we’re together, I’ll protect you."

For a second, Evelyn felt like she was watching a scene straight out of a drama.

She’d seen her fair share of manipulative women who played the victim, but compared to Adrian, they were amateurs. Vivian’s eyes welled up with tears.

The raw emotion between them was enough to make onlookers envious.

Tristan’s face flushed crimson, his expression twisting like he’d swallowed something vile. Adrian’s attitude was clearly getting under his skin.

Evelyn almost pitied him—he was the tragic male lead in this twisted soap opera. She took a sip of her soda to steady herself.

Tristan’s fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. He was barely holding back.

Then, without warning, he pointed at Evelyn and sneered at Vivian.

"You know this pretty boy used to have a thing for Evelyn, right? He backed off because he didn’t want to cross Nathan Blackwood. He’s got a thing for divorced women—that’s why he’s targeting you now. You really think he’s into you?"

His words exploded like a bomb, sending shockwaves through the room.

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. Her head snapped up, her glare icy enough to freeze Tristan where he stood. Any shred of sympathy she had for him vanished. He deserved to be alone forever.

"Bullshit!"

Evelyn and Adrian spoke in perfect unison, their denial synchronized.

Adrian shot her a playful wink.

Evelyn lifted her chin, radiating elegance and cold indifference.

That brief flirtation between them had been entirely one-sided on Adrian’s part. Evelyn had never entertained it.

It was just a fleeting attraction—Adrian had been drawn to her beauty, nothing more.

Now, he’d found his way back to the right path.

What he felt for Vivian was different—warm, genuine, the kind of love that made him want to spend a lifetime with her.

Evelyn opened her mouth to clarify their relationship when a smooth, deceptively sharp voice cut in from behind.

"Mr. Whitmore, as an honorary editor of a fashion magazine, your mindset is disappointingly archaic. Ms. Lockwood has male friends, and suddenly she’s being judged for it?"

Preston Sinclair stepped forward, his posture impeccable, his tone dripping with quiet disdain.

"If you can’t have what you want, you’d rather destroy three friendships in one go?"

From the moment he’d arrived, Preston had been the picture of charm, effortlessly winning over the crowd with his warmth and approachability.

But his words now made everyone reconsider.
###Chapter 821

Preston Sinclair wasn't a man without a temper. He simply knew how to conceal it.

But seeing Evelyn Sinclair being disrespected? That was a line he couldn't ignore.

Evelyn's breath hitched. The sheer audacity of his protectiveness sent warmth flooding through her chest.

She flashed him a grateful smile.

The crowd around them watched, stunned. Tristan Whitmore, humiliated by Preston's public reprimand, burned with fury.

Who the hell does he think he is? Tristan seethed.

Standing firmly in Nathan Blackwood's camp, he already despised Preston. He opened his mouth to retaliate—

Then he caught the icy glint in Evelyn's eyes.

A shudder ran down his spine.

He had just insulted Evelyn Sinclair.

The realization hit him like a bucket of ice water.

She had his secrets. His ruin. And she wasn't just anyone—she was Evelyn Sinclair.

Swallowing his rage, Tristan forced a stiff smile and bowed slightly before the gathered elite.

"My words were careless. My apologies, Evelyn. I spoke out of turn. Please, forgive me."

The room collectively held its breath.

Tristan Whitmore, CEO of Ludwig Corp, groveling?

Even if Ludwig Corp wasn't what it used to be, Tristan had influence. He was Nathan Blackwood's closest ally.

Yet here he was, bending the knee over a few thoughtless words.

Evelyn merely arched a brow, entirely unsurprised.

She gave him a slow, assessing look. Finally, some sense.

Had he pushed further, she would’ve destroyed him.

After a beat of silence, she smiled sweetly. "Forgiven, Mr. Whitmore. But watch your tongue next time."

Her tone was light, almost playful. Only Tristan heard the razor-sharp warning beneath.

His scalp prickled.

Dominic Kingsley, sensing the tension, smoothly intervened. "Ah, the champagne! Let’s toast, shall we?"

The guests' attention shifted, leaving Tristan seething.

He shot Nathaniel a venomous glare, but before he could speak, Nathaniel smirked.

"Nikki," he drawled, "after everything we've been through—"

Evelyn set her glass down with a sharp clink.

"Get out."

Tristan's jaw clenched. He had come to humiliate Nathaniel, only to humiliate himself.

He could afford to anger anyone here—except Evelyn Sinclair.

Forcing another smile, he nodded stiffly.

"Of course."

As he turned to leave, he leaned in, hissing at Nathaniel, "Manipulative bastard. This isn’t over."

The moment Tristan was gone, Evelyn nearly laughed.

But she schooled her expression—Vivian Lockwood was still watching.

Nathaniel rolled his eyes and tugged Vivian to her seat.

"He's not wrong, you know," he muttered. "If you wanted to ruin him, you could’ve just said so."
###Chapter 822

A towering figure like Preston sounded like a husband reprimanding his mistress. The entire situation felt unbearably awkward!

Evelyn inhaled sharply. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she denied it. "I wasn't laughing—"

Yet her grin stretched so wide it nearly split her face.

Preston moved to a nearby seat. "Mind if I join you?"

He wanted to stay close to Evelyn, yet feared intruding on private conversations. Such consideration made him effortlessly pleasant company.

Vivian flushed slightly, waving her hands. "Of course not, Mr. Sinclair. And thank you for earlier..."

Thanks to that shocking auction bid, everyone now recognized Preston Sinclair.

Adrian glanced between Preston and Evelyn before sighing and turning to Vivian. "No need to thank him. He did it for Evelyn's sake."

Preston hadn't intervened for their benefit. So the shameless Adrian refused to feel grateful.

Evelyn rolled her eyes at Adrian before smiling at Vivian. "Who knew this season's show would be so eventful?"

Given their minimal on-screen interaction, no one would've guessed Vivian and Adrian were dating off-camera. Vivian smiled awkwardly while Adrian remained unfiltered.

"Definitely eventful! Though shame you missed most of it. Heard you left because Xavier pissed you off?" Of all topics, Adrian had to dredge up unpleasant memories.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, shooting him a frosty glare.

Had they not survived that deserted island together, Evelyn wouldn't tolerate Adrian's tactlessness. He always knew which buttons to push.

"Hmph! As if I have time for petty drama. My company has major deals awaiting my attention!" Adrian smirked knowingly.

Vivian interjected, "Actually, we planned to tell friends later since we haven't been dating long. If anything changes—"

Her cautious, sensible nature resonated with Evelyn.

Adrian cut in. "I wanted to announce it day one! Stop worrying—we're forever material!" The solemnity in his gaze convinced Evelyn of his sincerity.

Watching them, Evelyn felt both touched and inexplicably wistful. Beside her, Preston handed her a honeyed lemonade.

Evelyn eyed him suspiciously. Preston's lips quirked. "It's sweetened."

Not sour then.

She accepted the glass but didn't drink, turning back to the couple. "So when did this start?"

Adrian glanced at Vivian. "Can I tell?"

After receiving her reluctant nod, he grinned. "I started pursuing her the first day on set—"

Evelyn's jaw nearly hit the floor.

This outing kept delivering surprises.

"Of course, Vivian ignored me. Even reported me for harassment—"

Preston coughed into his fist, clearly amused.

Exchanging glances with Preston, Evelyn realized their journey couldn't have been smooth.

Vivian huffed before explaining, "He's... remarkable. Makes me breakfast daily. When Tristan harassed me, Adrian was first to intervene. Always considers my feelings. Before filming ended, I knew—I couldn't stop thinking about him. So we got together!"

It sounded recklessly impulsive. Most would reconsider post-filming. Not Vivian.

She knew he'd never break her heart.
###Chapter 823

Vivian Lockwood knew exactly what she felt.

She adored Adrian Blackwood, though he was a year younger. Yet he possessed a maturity beyond his years—thoughtful, dependable, the kind of man who made her heart race.

So she listened to that heartbeat. No games, no pretense. Just raw, unfiltered emotion.

And she didn’t regret a single second of it.

This fire between them? She knew it would burn for a lifetime.

Best decision she’d ever made.

One glance exchanged between Vivian and Adrian, and Evelyn Sinclair knew—Tristan Whitmore never stood a chance.

No amount of effort could compete with the electricity crackling between those two. The way their eyes locked, the unspoken devotion radiating between them.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, a soft smile playing on her lips as she lifted her hands in applause.

"Stunning. May your happiness last forever."

Some might call it reckless, rushing into love like this.

But Evelyn believed in them. When the initial spark settled, when gossip and petty challenges arose—she had no doubt their bond would only deepen.

The couple’s intertwined fingers were a stark contrast to Evelyn’s empty hands. The ache of loneliness pressed in.

She needed air.

With a practiced smile, she excused herself, slipping out with Preston Sinclair.

Just as she reached the car, a voice called out.

Vivian.

Skirt clutched in one hand, she jogged over, cheeks flushed. "There’s something I’d like to discuss. Privately."

Evelyn’s stomach tightened. Did Tristan’s nonsense actually get to her? Do I need to explain there’s nothing between Adrian and me? But wouldn’t that just make it worse?

Preston intervened smoothly. "Why not talk in the car? More discreet."

Perfect solution.

The driver tactfully stepped away, leaving the two women in the quiet luxury of the backseat.

Evelyn hesitated. "Just so we’re clear—Adrian and I—"

Vivian laughed. "Oh, I know. He told me ages ago."

Evelyn blinked. Could’ve led with that.

"He admitted he used to have feelings for you," Vivian added casually.

Evelyn’s smile froze. Is he insane?

Noticing her discomfort, Vivian patted her hand. "Relax. It was one-sided. You’re gorgeous, brilliant, kind—who wouldn’t fall for you? If I were a man, I’d be smitten too."

Evelyn exhaled. "Then what did you want to discuss?"

"Business." Vivian’s eyes lit up. "I’m expanding the firm. Right now, it’s just me, and the workload’s overwhelming. With a proper team, we could triple our output."

Evelyn relaxed. Thank God.

"Approved. You have full autonomy."

Vivian shook her head. "You’re the investor. Your insight is invaluable. I won’t move forward without your blessing."

Evelyn grinned. "Consider it given. Emphatically."

To her, this was pocket change.

To Vivian? A lifelong dream unfolding.

They brainstormed, debated, and by the time Vivian left, they’d aligned perfectly.

As the driver returned, Evelyn started to give directions—

The door swung open. Preston slid in, smirking. "Mind if I hitch a ride?"

"Not at all." She turned to the driver. "Take Mr. Sinclair to The Regal Grand first."

Preston shook his head. "Actually, make it The Grand Manor."

Evelyn’s brows lifted. The Grand Manor—where every square foot cost more than most people made in a year.

Rivaled only by Highland Estates, where Nathan Blackwood resided.
###Chapter 824

Preston chuckled lightly, his tone playful.

"I won't be returning to Pacifica anytime soon. My friends warned me that living in a hotel long-term makes dating impossible, so I bought a place here."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. Was Preston serious about pursuing her? Buying a house in Montecito suggested he planned to stay.

Silence settled between them during the drive to Highland Estates.

The driver turned on a classic tune to fill the quiet. The car was too still.

"We've arrived, Mr. Sinclair. Visitor vehicles aren't permitted beyond the gate," the driver informed him.

Preston smiled, his expression warm yet reserved as he turned to Evelyn.

"Are you avoiding conversation with me?"

Evelyn blinked, then shook her head. "No..."

Preston asked, "Would you like to come inside?"

Anticipating refusal, he quickly added, "Oliver asked me to bring you something from overseas. I haven't had the chance to give it to you yet. You could take it now."

Evelyn hesitated. "What is it?" If it was jewelry, she'd decline.

Preston's smile deepened. He cleared his throat. "He made it himself. Not valuable, but one-of-a-kind."

Children loved crafting gifts.

Preston hadn't planned to give it to her—he didn't know how—but it was the only excuse to invite her in. Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

She thought, It must be something heartfelt! I'll cherish it.

Preston greeted the security guard, and the car glided through the gates. Evelyn remembered something. "Did Oliver get into trouble at school?"

Preston arched a brow.

"He competed in a youth intelligence contest, mouthed off to a boy five years older, and got punched."

Evelyn's heart clenched. "They were jealous of his brilliance!"

Preston's lips twitched. "That's exactly what Michael said. Which is why he got hit."

Evelyn winced. "Was he hurt?"

Preston's expression cooled. "He's fine. I disciplined him."

"He was telling the truth! The teacher overreacted by calling parents..." Evelyn muttered.

Preston gave her an exasperated look. He hadn't expected her to be so protective.

She really adored Oliver.

"The school called me because they wanted the other boy to apologize in front of his parents. Instead, Oliver hired his bodyguard to pose as his father. The teacher caught on. Then he paid a street vendor near the school to play the role—exposed again. Finally, he recruited a man from a fast-food joint, who turned out to be the teacher's father. The teacher lost it, dug up my secretary's number from the registry, and that's how I found out."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. Oliver's usually so clever! Why did his brain short-circuit when it mattered?

He should've hired someone from across town! Still too green.

The car stopped.

Preston opened her door like a gentleman. Evelyn stepped out, surveying the grounds.

Fresh air, manicured lawns, a vibrant yet peaceful semi-open layout. Clearly an elite neighborhood.

Preston walked beside her, chatting casually.

"I know you prefer living in your penthouse duplex. I asked the developer, but the units above and below were already sold. No price would convince the owners. So I settled for this place. It's close to your office."
###Chapter 825

Preston's words hinted that he'd purchased this place solely to be near Evelyn.

Evelyn blinked in surprise before quickly regaining her composure.

"That condo sold out years ago. It was quite the hot commodity back then."

She tilted her head, recalling. "My brother Lucas bought it for me with his first big acting paycheck. Lucky for me, the location's prime—right in the heart of Montecito's most exclusive district. The Highland Estates is the only property that never dipped in value, even during the market crash."

After all, these homes catered to the elite. What did billionaires care about minor price fluctuations?

Someone like Preston Sinclair didn't even blink before signing the check.

The thought reinforced her confidence in the Sandford development project. She intended to revolutionize the real estate market there.

Preston chuckled, rubbing his temple. Did she completely miss the point?

Still, he gave her an approving look.

"Ms. Sinclair, you never disappoint. Your market insight is razor-sharp."

Evelyn smirked, lifting her chin. "I’ve always had a knack for lucrative industries."

Preston exhaled, amused.

He stepped forward, scanning his fingerprint to unlock the door, then gestured for her to enter. "After you."

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, the house came alive.

State-of-the-art AI systems controlled everything—lights, temperature, even the curtains. Preston had always been fascinated by technology. No surprise he’d invested heavily in artificial intelligence.

Evelyn knew the most advanced smart home systems originated from Denmark. Importing and installing one here must have been a logistical nightmare.

The system recognized its owner instantly. Two pairs of slippers—one masculine, one feminine—slid out from the shoe cabinet. "Welcome home, Master."

Evelyn hesitated.

Her tailored coat and fitted dress made bending down awkward. She wasn’t keen on changing shoes, half-tempted to leave.

Then Preston dropped to one knee before her.

Before she could protest, he’d already slipped off her heels and replaced them with the plush house slippers.

Evelyn flushed, murmuring thanks. It felt rude to walk out now.

Growing up, this kind of attention was normal. Her father, William, had done it when she was little. Later, her brothers took over. If it had been Alexander or Lucas, she wouldn’t have batted an eye.

But Preston? That was different.

He stood smoothly, as if nothing unusual had happened. "Come on. Oliver’s gift is in the next room."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. She trusted Preston’s integrity. Besides, her driver was waiting outside. Nothing inappropriate would happen.

The penthouse exuded modern European elegance—minimalist yet warm, every detail meticulously curated. Clearly, an internationally renowned designer had been involved.

The decor was refined, soothing. Just like Preston himself.

He opened the nearest door, nodding for her to look inside.

Evelyn smiled, curious.

Handmade gifts usually meant paintings or sculptures. But the second she stepped forward, her blood ran cold.

She stumbled back—straight into Preston’s solid chest. His hand steadied her waist, warm and firm.

The moment she regained her balance, he withdrew, as if he’d only meant to catch her.

Evelyn stared, horrified.

The room featured an indoor pool.

And in that pool?

A crocodile.

A massive, living crocodile.

It took her a full minute to find her voice. She whirled toward Preston, pointing disbelievingly at the creature.

"This—this has to be a joke."

No way was this the gift.
###Chapter 826

Preston smiled apologetically and moved to shut the door, blocking Evelyn's view.

"I didn't want to give this on Oliver's behalf—I was afraid it might scare you," he admitted. "But Oliver insisted on surprising you."

Evelyn's face paled. "That wasn't a surprise."

She silently thanked her strong constitution for not giving her a heart attack.

Preston looked genuinely remorseful. He stepped forward, wrapping his arms around her in a gentle embrace before releasing her and guiding her by the wrist into the living room.

"Argus, a glass of warm water, please." Evelyn still seemed shaken.

Had he known her reaction would be this severe, he never would have brought her here.

A sleek, cylindrical white robot—standing about five feet tall—glided over, offering her the water.

"Dearest, please drink."

Evelyn blinked. Dearest?

The robot tilted its head slightly, as if processing her hesitation. "Yes, you are Evelyn Dearest. Please drink."

It recognizes me?

Preston intercepted the glass, shooting the robot a pointed look. "Go charge elsewhere."

The machine obediently turned and retreated.

Evelyn frowned. That form of address... it didn't sit right with her.

"This robot—" Evelyn Dearest?

Preston cleared his throat, his cheeks tinged pink. "Apologies. I shouldn't have invited you before finishing the system setup. The robot registers close contacts for faster response times. Sometimes, the phrasing it uses can be... overly familiar."

He conveniently left out the part where he had programmed her in as "the woman I love."

The robot, unfortunately, had no filter.

Evelyn drained the glass, then stood with a tight smile. "It's getting late. I should head back. As for that gift—I really can't accept it. Will Oliver be upset if I return it?"

She was doing her best to ignore the robot's unsettling behavior, focusing instead on the more immediate problem—the crocodile.

Preston shook his head firmly. "Don't worry. I warned him not everyone shares his tastes. If you don't want it, I'll arrange for a professional handler to take it."

He had zero intention of keeping a carnivorous reptile in his penthouse.

Evelyn nodded vigorously. Good. I'd rather receive a bouquet of funeral flowers.

Preston escorted her out, apologizing again. His regret was palpable.

Once inside her car, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

She wasn't petty. She'd forgive him—and pretend this never happened.

Some memories were better left buried.

Meanwhile, the hotel celebration had ended.

Guests posted group photos, sparking nostalgia among fans of the variety show.

But what truly set elite circles buzzing wasn't the reunion—it was a short, explosive clip.

Tristan Whitmore, once furious, now stood humbled before Evelyn, bowing slightly as he apologized.

"It was a slip of the tongue. I'm sorry, Evelyn. I was too impulsive. Please forgive me."

Her response was ice-calm. "I'll forgive you this once, Mr. Whitmore. Choose your words more carefully next time."

Two sentences.

That was all it took to send speculation spiraling.

What had forced Tristan's sudden humility?

And just how dangerous was Evelyn Sinclair's quiet threat?
###Chapter 827

The power dynamic became crystal clear in that brief interaction.

Evelyn Sinclair sat with effortless grace, her poised demeanor utterly captivating.

She didn't utter a single threatening word, yet her presence alone commanded respect.

Even someone of Tristan Whitmore's status had to bow his head and apologize when he misspoke.

The onlookers could only marvel at how untouchable Evelyn truly was.

When Tristan discovered the leaked video, his fury knew no bounds. He blocked every account that dared to share it.

His reputation was in tatters by nightfall.

The sky darkened to a deep indigo as city lights flickered to life, dotting the horizon like scattered stars.

Blackwood Industries.

Nathan Blackwood had one singular focus—monitoring any updates about Evelyn.

Gregory Thornton posted a clip of Tristan's humiliating moment with Evelyn, captioned: "Tristan Whitmore's most pathetic display!"

Nathan clicked immediately, only to find it deleted moments later.

He demanded the video directly from Gregory, who reluctantly sent it with a warning.

"Tristan's hunting this down like a madman. Don't tell him I gave it to you."

The ten-second clip showed Tristan apologizing profusely while Evelyn accepted it with icy detachment.

Tristan's humility wasn't feigned—Evelyn simply had that effect on people.

But Nathan was missing context. "What did Tristan do to her?"

Gregory shrugged. "No idea. I just reposted it before the original got taken down."

Nathan dialed Tristan without hesitation.

"You pissed off Evelyn?"

Tristan wanted to vanish on the spot.

He cursed the person who filmed it. If he ever found them, he'd make sure they regretted it.

"You already know?" Tristan groaned.

"Explain."

Tristan had no choice. If Nathan wanted answers, someone would talk. Better it came from him.

"It was their celebration. I saw Vivian with Adrian and lost my temper. Blurted out that Adrian used to have feelings for Evelyn..."

Silence stretched on the line.

Tristan's stomach twisted. Evelyn had forgiven him—was Nathan here to collect a debt?

"Blackwood, come on—" His voice cracked. "I've been the laughingstock of our circle all day because of this!"

Nathan scoffed.

"Serves you right."

The memory of Adrian's past obsession with Evelyn still made Nathan's blood boil.

Tristan bringing it up was like ripping open an old wound.

"If I were her, I'd have ended you on the spot," Nathan hissed.

The venom in his voice made Tristan shudder.

Compared to Nathan, Evelyn had been downright merciful.

Suddenly, Tristan didn't resent her anymore. He gripped the phone tighter.

"Look, I apologized properly. Evelyn accepted it. We're square. My wife's been stolen by your nephew, my reputation's ruined—I'm already suffering enough!"

His voice broke into exaggerated sobs.

He wanted to rant about how Adrian had manipulated Vivian, but the words stuck in his throat.

Nathan hung up before the fake crying could escalate.

Some things weren't worth listening to.
###Chapter 828

Tristan Whitmore sobbed uncontrollably until he realized the line had gone dead long ago.

He was stunned into silence.

Nathan Blackwood set down his phone and observed Theodore Winslow meticulously feeding the koi fish across the room.

"Find out what happened at that gala Evelyn attended today."

Theodore immediately abandoned his task without hesitation.

"Right away, Mr. Blackwood!"

Nathan scrolled through his contacts until he found Evelyn's profile. The page was blank.

'Why hasn't she posted anything?' He typed out a private message.

[Every bite I take reminds me of you - my love shaped into edible form.]

Such saccharine words.

Nathan was determined to prove he wasn't the same emotionally-stunted man Evelyn had divorced.

Ten seconds... Thirty seconds... No response.

'Did her phone die?' One minute...

Five minutes...

Still nothing.

'She must be asleep.' He typed another message.

[Goodnight.]

A red exclamation mark appeared instantly. The system notification read: [You are no longer connected to this contact.]

Nathan was speechless.

The air suddenly felt too thick to breathe.

Harrison knocked excitedly on the office door. "Sir, can we all go home now?" Nathan lifted his icy gaze without responding.

Harrison forced a smile. "Message received. The answer is no." He retreated quickly, shutting the door behind him.

The assistant was thoroughly confused. Just hours ago, Nathan had offered to treat the entire staff to dinner and drinks. Now his mood had darkened again. Harrison exhaled heavily.

Being Nathan Blackwood's assistant was exhausting.

Theodore returned shortly with a full report, delivering it with dramatic flair. He concluded with, "Young Master Adrian has quite the way with women."

Had Adrian tried those tactics on Evelyn, Nathan would have murdered him. Tristan was too principled to make a move.

Nathan's brows furrowed dangerously. For the first time, he felt genuine sympathy for Tristan.

That nephew of his was truly insufferable. "Mr. Blackwood, should we assist Mr. Whitmore?"

Theodore instantly regretted the question.

While Tristan was Nathan's closest friend, Adrian was family. Nathan's expression darkened.

"No. Tristan's ex-wife was unbearable. He's better off without her."

Loyalty won out in the end.

Theodore nodded, then had a sudden realization.

"Sir, you could actually learn from Young Master Adrian's techniques—"

Theodore had originally thought Preston Sinclair was the pretentious one. But if Nathan acted first, Preston wouldn't have stood a chance.

Seizing the initiative would be advantageous.

Nathan's face twisted in disgust. "You want me to emulate that idiot?"

His voice turned glacial.

Theodore quickly reframed Adrian's approach.

"It's called coquetry. Imagine if Ms. Sinclair flirted and acted cute with you—wouldn't that captivate you?"

"So if you behaved similarly, she'd certainly respond favorably—"

Nathan's expression became unreadable, but he didn't immediately reject the idea.

Theodore snapped his fingers. "Wait here! I'll find reference materials!"

His frantic search history included:

[Mastering the art of flirtation]

[How men can appear adorable]

[The sophisticated man's guide to affectation]
###Chapter 829

Nathan Blackwood instinctively resisted the idea. He knew Evelyn Sinclair would never fall for such cheap tricks.

Yet Theodore Winslow confidently patted his chest, assuring his employer.

Nathan glanced down at his phone again. The red exclamation mark still glared back at him, mocking his failed message delivery.

He had no choice but to consider alternative approaches.

With a grim expression, Nathan picked up the iPad. His eyes burned after just one glance.

He threw it back onto the table. "Absolutely not. I refuse to even look at this garbage."

Nathan stood abruptly. As CEO of Blackwood Industries, he could give Evelyn the world on a silver platter. He'd lay down his life for her without hesitation.

Why should he degrade himself with these ridiculous pickup lines? It was torture.

[I've never been so obsessed with someone before. You're unlike any woman I've ever met.]

[There are a million things I want to tell you, but when I see you, all I can say is 'I miss you.' Hope your boyfriend won't mind...]

[I know you're upset with me, but surely he won't object to us talking? It's not like anything's happening between us.]

Theodore grew anxious. "Mr. Blackwood, you should know Preston Sinclair just purchased the penthouse at Grandeur Towers - the one closest to Ms. Sinclair's apartment! He's preparing for a long siege!"

Nathan's eyes darkened, his voice dripping with smug superiority. "I own the entire floor above and below her apartment. I'm closer."

"But Ms. Sinclair isn't staying at her apartment," Theodore countered. "She's living at Sterling Manor now."

Nathan froze for three heartbeats. "Can we buy Sterling Manor?"

Impossible.

The Sterlings would never agree.

Theodore studied his employer, thinking: 'Who cares about pride at this point? Whether it's a black cat or white cat, as long as it catches the mouse...'

"Mr. Blackwood, we're already losing to Preston. Between you two, Ms. Sinclair clearly favors him! If we don't act soon..." Theodore swallowed hard. "They might start a family before you know it."

He wanted to smack some sense into Nathan. 'Wake up! Your ex-wife is slipping through your fingers!'

Nathan's expression turned glacial. His sharp gaze made Theodore shrink back, realizing he'd crossed a line.

The assistant had touched every one of Nathan's raw nerves.

The room fell silent as Theodore bowed his head, trembling under Nathan's withering stare.

After a long pause, Nathan spoke through clenched teeth. "He's delusional."

"Completely delusional!" Theodore quickly agreed.

Nathan snatched up the iPad again, forcing himself to read through the cringe-worthy content with visible discomfort. 'Why would any woman prefer this nonsense over genuine affection? Diamonds speak louder than empty words.'

Theodore smiled inwardly. This change in attitude gave him hope for reconciliation.

"Mr. Blackwood, we have two approaches - the soft method like Adrian Blackwood's charm, or the hard method like those dominant CEO romance novels."

Nathan didn't hesitate. "Hard method."

Night had fallen over the city, lights twinkling like distant stars against the dark sky.

Back at Highland Estates...

After spending two hours handling overseas business in his study, Nathan turned his attention to the kitchen.

Theodore had found a particularly dramatic CEO romance novel for Nathan. Knowing his employer's schedule, he'd converted it to audiobook format.

So there stood Nathan - tall, imposing, and utterly expressionless - stirring a pot while listening to romantic drivel.

His brows knitted together in visible distress. The iPad nearly ended up in the stew.

"Mr. Blackwood, please endure it," Theodore pleaded. "Women love this stuff!"

Nathan looked ready to explode as the ridiculous narration continued: "The 6'3" domineering CEO, upon hearing his woman dared disobey him, clutched his newly transplanted heart, pulled out a two-million-dollar check, and slapped it across her face."

"Bullshit!" Nathan roared.
###Chapter 830

Nathan Blackwood glared at Theodore Winslow. Does this fool take me for an idiot?

He abandoned the stew and stormed out of the kitchen, his aura icy.

Theodore had no idea why he'd chosen such a regressive novel. When he first read it, he'd thought it was decent.

But listening to the audiobook now, the so-called "domineering CEO" sounded utterly ridiculous.

Theodore hurried after Nathan, scrambling to explain. "Mr. Blackwood, please don’t be angry! The author of this novel isn’t a visionary leader like you. They couldn’t possibly capture your brilliance and strategic mind!"

Nathan’s expression remained cold. His eyes darkened dangerously as he snapped, "Get out."

"Right away! I’ll find something better—"

Theodore was desperate to salvage the situation.

If he weren’t still useful, Nathan would have had him thrown out of the penthouse by now.

Nathan retreated to his study, forcing himself to calm down.

He pulled out his phone and opened Evelyn Sinclair’s chat.

The message he sent still bore a red exclamation mark.

A wave of loneliness crashed over him. The gnawing fear of losing her again tightened its grip.

Fine. I’ll endure this nonsense.

With a grimace, he reopened the materials and novels Theodore had sent him.

Sterling Manor

Evelyn and Natalie Beaumont lounged in bed, recounting their day.

Lucas Sterling had become Natalie’s shadow, following her to work under the guise of "protection"—though his real motive was keeping Adrian Prescott at bay. Thankfully, Lucas knew his boundaries and never overstepped.

The power dynamic remained firmly in Natalie’s hands.

Natalie sighed. "Thank God you’re here. I don’t know how I’d face Lucas otherwise. He’s done so much for me, and I have no idea how to repay him."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. That’s exactly what he wants.

"Don’t overthink it. Even if Lucas weren’t interested in you, I wouldn’t stand by and watch you suffer. Besides, he has his own agenda—I’m just a convenient excuse."

Natalie huffed. Must she be so blunt?

Then she remembered something.

Tristan Whitmore had spent the day warning everyone who’d circulated that video among the elite circles. Natalie smirked. "What exactly did Tristan do?"

Evelyn thought of Adrian Blackwood and couldn’t help but laugh.

She recounted the party incident, clicking her tongue at Adrian’s dramatic transformation. "Adrian admitted he did it purely to provoke Tristan. In a direct fight, he’d lose, but he could certainly make Tristan sick to his stomach."

Natalie was fascinated, regretting she hadn’t witnessed it firsthand. Since when are men pettier than women?

She giggled. "Adrian’s younger than Tristan, so when he acts spoiled, it’s almost charming. But if an old fox like Tristan tried those lines—"

Both women shuddered in unison. Disgusting.

Sterling Enterprises – Next Morning

Evelyn had an early meeting and arrived at the office before dawn.

When Nathan strode in, he ignored the receptionist entirely.

The woman recognized him instantly and nearly dropped her coffee.

"Mr. Blackwood! Do—do you have an appointment with Ms. Sterling?"

Nathan paused, irritation flashing across his face.

"I brought breakfast for Ms. Sterling. Is she here?"

"Yes, but—"

Before she could finish, Nathan marched past her.

No one dared stop him. With his status, even without an appointment, blocking him was unthinkable.

The receptionist frantically alerted the secretary’s office.

By mid-morning, the entire company was buzzing.

Nathan Blackwood had personally delivered breakfast to Evelyn Sinclair. What kind of royal treatment was this?

All those online rumors about Blackwood Industries targeting Sterling Enterprises?

Gone without a trace.
###Chapter 831

Nathan Blackwood's arrival at Sterling Enterprises sent ripples through the executive floor.

Bennett had barely finished informing Evelyn Sinclair when Nathan made his dramatic entrance.

The man had no sense of boundaries. Instead of waiting in the conference room, he planted himself right outside the CEO's office like some brooding sentinel.

Through the glass partition, Nathan could see Evelyn conducting a meeting. Her sharp brows arched over piercing eyes, lips curved in that dangerous smile that made junior executives tremble.

The sight struck him like a physical blow.

This wasn't the subdued woman he'd married. This was Evelyn Sinclair in her full, terrifying glory - razor-sharp intellect wrapped in designer silk.

His chest tightened painfully.

Those three years of marriage had been her cage. He'd dulled her brilliance without realizing it. The realization hit him like a sucker punch.

Bennett cleared his throat awkwardly. Nathan's presence had effectively paralyzed the entire floor.

Twenty minutes later, the meeting adjourned.

Executives streamed out looking either shell-shocked or smugly victorious. "Damn, CEO Sinclair makes Alexander look like a teddy bear." "Well, she basically runs Sterling Enterprises now anyway."

Evelyn stretched her shoulders before gliding toward the door. Bennett hadn't gotten the chance to warn her.

The moment she saw Nathan, her step faltered.

He sat ramrod straight, stormy eyes locked on her. "Good morning, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn's gaze snapped to Bennett.

Before her assistant could explain, Nathan rose with predatory grace. "Business."

He tossed the word like a gauntlet and strode into her office like he owned the place.

Evelyn handed her files to Bennett. "Two coffees."

Nathan dominated the sofa, all sharp angles and simmering intensity. "Sit."

For a disorienting second, Evelyn wondered if she'd walked into the wrong office.

She ignored him, powering up her computer instead. The screen light played across her cheekbones as she spoke. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Would've texted. You blocked me."

The words came out strangled.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Did I?"

Her tone dripped with faux innocence. If he wanted to play games, she'd raise the stakes.

She picked up her phone with deliberate slowness. "Must've mistaken you for spam."

The dig landed perfectly.

Nathan moved like lightning, caging her against the desk. His scent - bergamot and something darker - wrapped around her. "You're doing this on purpose."

A charged silence fell.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. Then she met his gaze head-on. "Obviously."

No more pretense.

Nathan exhaled sharply. Evelyn pushed back, putting distance between them.

Before she could deliver her next barb, Nathan turned on his heel. His retreating form radiated barely contained fury.
###Chapter 832

Evelyn froze for a split second.

Nathan was walking toward her, carrying a thermos in his hands.

His long, elegant fingers moved with practiced ease as he poured a bowl of soup and slid it across the table.

"Try it."

Evelyn frowned. Something about Nathan today felt... off.

She couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

Her gaze dropped to the soup. "Theodore made soup this early?"

Nathan lowered his thick lashes, his dark eyes shadowed. His voice was deep.

"Mhm."

Evelyn wasn't in the mood for soup. She didn’t touch it.

"Aside from blocking me, do you have anything else to say?"

Her tone made it clear—it was time for him to leave.

Nathan's lips pressed into a firm line. A ripple of something unreadable passed through his eyes.

"I'm accelerating the Kingsley Tech project. I poached a high-tech research team from Denmark."

"They'll arrive next month. We'll restructure the entire workflow."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned.

A Danish high-tech team wasn’t just about money—it was nearly impossible to pull off. Core technical staff were harder to poach than security teams. How had Nathan managed it?

Nathan watched her quietly, his presence overwhelming. His next words were deliberate.

"So, Preston Sinclair can hurry back to where he came from."

He had spent a fortune just to speed up the timeline—all so Preston would leave sooner.

The farther Preston stayed from Evelyn, the better.

The air between them turned icy.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Mr. Sinclair’s schedule isn’t mine to dictate."

Nathan smirked, his expression a mix of frost and something warmer.

"Evelyn, you know what I mean. If you reject him, I’ll give you anything you want."

Her eyes flashed.

Wow.

The sheer confidence in his gaze was impossible to miss.

Only Nathan could say something like that without sounding ridiculous. He was nothing like those over-the-top "tyrant CEOs" from the novels Theodore had shown him.

If Nathan threw two million dollars at her, she’d feel insulted.

She’d probably bury him under twenty million in cash just to make a point.

To avoid such barbaric displays, Nathan had chosen a more refined approach—investing where it mattered.

Evelyn studied him—his perfect features, those dark, fathomless eyes.

Why do I want to punch him so badly?

"Mr. Blackwood, let me remind you—"

She paused, exhaling sharply. "You’re a beneficiary in Preston’s project too. You’ll profit from your own investment. So why threaten me?"

She was making money fair and square. She wasn’t about to fall for Nathan’s ridiculous demands.

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly.

As the smallest stakeholder, he hadn’t even considered that detail.

Damn it. Oversight.

His lashes lowered, casting shadows over his sharp features. He accepted her criticism with surprising calm.

Finally, he nudged the soup toward her again, his voice steady.

"I was just proving my capabilities. No threats intended."

He paused. "Here. Hydrate."

Hah.

Evelyn nearly laughed in exasperation. It was like punching a cloud.

This man was infuriatingly good at getting under her skin.

She took a deep breath. Don’t get angry. Dying of rage only benefits your enemies.

Her gaze dropped to the soup. She did miss Theodore’s cooking.

Without thinking, she lifted the bowl and took a sip.

Nathan’s eyes flickered.

The next second, Evelyn fought not to spit it out.

Her manners won. She swallowed—like she was forcing down poison.

Nathan watched her, face impassive.

"Good?"

Is poison good? she thought.
###Chapter 833

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze to meet Nathan Blackwood's eyes in silence.

She suspected he'd tampered with the stew.

Just then, Bennett entered with their coffees. "President Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood, your coffee—"

Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed a cup and downed it in one go.

The bitter, scalding liquid burned her throat, but she kept her expression neutral as she set the cup down with deliberate grace.

Nathan's face darkened slightly, while Bennett frowned in concern.

A faint smile curved Evelyn's lips as she glanced between them. "The coffee's excellent. I'll take another."

Bennett's sharp eyes flicked to the untouched stew on the table, lingering for a moment before understanding dawned.

"Right away, President Sinclair."

Once he left, Nathan narrowed his eyes, took a sip of his own coffee, and scoffed. Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin, her tone polite but distant. "The stew wasn't bad. Thanks."

Nathan exhaled, satisfaction flickering in his gaze.

"To make up for my mistake, I'll send you a fresh batch every day from now on."

Evelyn's smile froze.

"That won't be necessary."

He rubbed his temple, undeterred. "It's no trouble. I'll keep at it until you unblock me."

Evelyn paused, then pulled out her phone, scrolling briefly before meeting his eyes. "I should reflect on my behavior. We are business partners, after all. Blocking you was impulsive. Rest assured, Mr. Blackwood, it won't happen again."

Her crisp, professional tone caught him off guard. A guarantee? Nathan almost couldn't believe it. His brows furrowed—part frustration, part disappointment. No more daily deliveries? What a shame.

Evelyn's thoughts were far less diplomatic. Just leave me alone.

Nathan's phone buzzed urgently—Harrison calling. His expression tightened before he stood. Evelyn rose as well, ready to see him out. Without another word, Nathan strode away, his long legs carrying him swiftly from the room.

Finally, peace.

Bennett returned with a fresh coffee. Evelyn tilted her chin toward the stew. "Toss it." He nodded.

She usually loved stews, but this one had been impossible to stomach. "Did Mr. Blackwood make this himself?" Bennett muttered.

Evelyn blinked, her face carefully blank. Right. Definitely not Theodore's standard.

If it had been anyone else, she might have been touched.

But this was Nathan.

She half-wondered if it was poisoned.

The afternoon passed quietly until Isabella Montgomery called. She had a high-stakes client meeting and wanted Evelyn there for moral support.

Evelyn agreed without hesitation.

She hadn’t expected the venue to be that newly opened bar—the one crawling with troublemakers.

Just thinking about it gave her a headache.

But the reservation was set. She had no choice.

When Evelyn arrived, the bar was at least functioning normally—loud music pulsing, the energy chaotic but not lawless.

The moment she stepped inside, whistles cut through the noise.

Evelyn ignored them.

Her fitted blouse tucked into a sleek pencil skirt accentuated her narrow waist and endless legs. The injury had healed, but her family had vetoed heels—so she’d opted for low pumps instead. It didn’t diminish her presence one bit.

She moved to the bar, texted Isabella, and waited.

The bartender slid a cocktail toward her, gaze lingering.

Evelyn didn’t glance up. "I didn’t order this."

"My treat," he said.

"No, thanks."

He pushed a QR code across the counter. "Already paid for. If you won’t accept it, just transfer the cost back."

His tone was smooth. Too smooth.
###Chapter 834

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze, studying the bartender with deliberate scrutiny. Is this guy seriously hitting on me?

She had to admit, he was undeniably attractive—sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, and that cocky smirk. The kind of face that probably had half the women in this place swooning.

Too bad she'd seen enough pretty boys to last a lifetime.

A faint smirk curled her lips. "This cocktail is terrible."

The bartender chuckled, unfazed. "Picky, aren't we?"

He wasn't worried. Plenty of women spent fortunes here just for his attention. The owner practically worshipped him for it.

Evelyn tilted her head, unimpressed. "You really think a cheap drink is enough to impress someone?"

His grin faltered.

The dim, pulsing lights cast shifting shadows across the bar.

He narrowed his eyes, suddenly uneasy. There was something familiar about her—like he'd seen her before but couldn't place it.

Before he could figure it out, a woman in an elegant dress descended the spiral staircase and grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Isabella, what are you doing down here? Come upstairs!"

Evelyn didn't spare the bartender another glance, letting Isabella drag her away.

The bartender stiffened. Isabella Montgomery? The woman who dropped six figures here without blinking. The owner had warned him—she was untouchable.

And she'd just called that woman Evelyn.

A heavy hand landed on his shoulder.

He flinched. "Boss?"

The owner watched the two women disappear upstairs, then sighed. "That one? You don’t want to mess with her. When we first opened, the cops and fire marshals raided us every other week because she had a run-in with some idiots outside our door. Nearly shut us down."

The bartender paled. "That’s Evelyn Sinclair?"

The boss nodded grimly. "That’s her."

Upstairs, Evelyn scanned the private room. She didn’t recognize anyone.

Isabella’s family moved in different circles from Sterling Enterprises, so it made sense. Still, Evelyn offered polite nods to the group.

Three men sat with their assistants. Isabella’s own assistant hovered nearby, refilling glasses.

One of them—Donovan Pierce—stood out. Dark hair, sharp features, and a gaze that lingered on Isabella a little too long. His smirk was calculated, his movements deliberate.

Evelyn saw right through him.

Isabella could handle herself, though. The conversation flowed smoothly, laughter masking the tension.

Glasses clinked. Toasts were made. Isabella downed hers without hesitation.

Evelyn intercepted a few drinks meant for her, but Isabella shot her a warning look. Not with your injuries.

So Evelyn sat back, watching as they launched into a drinking game.

An old-fashioned one. Isabella usually dominated these.

But Donovan was good.

The room erupted in cheers as he won another round.

Isabella, flushed from the alcohol, flashed a dazzling smile. "Fine. One last round. If I win, you sign the contract."

Donovan leaned forward. "And if I win?"

She hesitated.

His grin turned predatory. "Then you kiss me."
###Chapter 835

Donovan Pierce's words instantly sparked a wave of encouragement from the crowd.

As their key figure, his opinion held undeniable sway.

"Isabella Montgomery, are you backing out? Three contracts and one French kiss. By any calculation, you're getting the better deal!"

"Exactly, Ms. Montgomery! Even if you lose, charming Mr. Pierce might still turn things around..."

"If you're too scared, your friend can always take your place."

Several pairs of eyes flicked toward Evelyn.

Evelyn's expression darkened. Before she could speak, Isabella's temper flared.

"What's there to be afraid of? It's just a stupid game!"

Evelyn barely had time to stop her before the words tumbled out.

She tugged Isabella closer, whispering urgently. "Donovan Pierce isn't some pushover. Let it go. The contracts aren't worth this."

Their presence at this gathering already signaled willingness to work with the Montgomerys.

Evelyn studied Donovan's face—the smirk, the arrogant confidence.

Isabella was drunk, reckless, convinced she couldn't lose.

"Relax, I've got this!"

Isabella stood abruptly. "Poker dice. One round, highest hand wins."

Donovan nodded. "Agreed."

The room fell silent.

Isabella snatched up the cup, gave it a practiced shake, and slammed it down. Her movements were fluid, brimming with cocky assurance. She lifted it.

Three of a kind.

Evelyn exhaled.

A beat of silence.

The odds were in Isabella's favor. She'd spent years mastering this game before quitting.

Donovan smirked, picked up another cup, gave it three lazy shakes, and dropped it.

His posture screamed indifference.

"Ms. Montgomery, you won't accuse me of bullying you if I win?"

Isabella scowled. "Win fair and square, and I'll honor it. But when you lose, those contracts get signed tonight."

Donovan's grin widened. His voice dropped low. "Deal." He flipped the cup.

The crowd reacted instantly. Everyone except Evelyn's group burst into laughter.

Four of a kind.

Isabella lost.

Evelyn's gaze snapped to Donovan. His victorious laugh grated on her nerves. Isabella had chosen the terms—no takebacks. This wasn't child's play.

Isabella stared at the dice for five full seconds before scoffing.

Evelyn gripped her arm, bracing for an outburst.

"Need backup?"

They could still salvage this.

Despite the alcohol, Isabella was lucid enough to know her limits. She'd picked her strongest game—only to discover Donovan was a shark at everything.

This bastard set me up!

With anyone else, she'd have their parents on speed dial. But not him.

Isabella forced a smile. "I'm fine." Her stomach churned.

Donovan stood, adjusted his jacket with one hand in his pocket, and strolled forward.

"Don't be a sore loser, Ms. Montgomery..." The crowd jeered.

Isabella's jaw tightened. So I lost. It's just a damn kiss.

She rose, voice dripping with disdain. "Tell me, Mr. Pierce, how do you stack up against my exes?"
###Chapter 836

Isabella followed Donovan Pierce outside, but before the door could shut completely, he pulled her into an embrace. "Ms. Montgomery," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear, "since no one's watching now, why don't you take the lead?"

His cologne was unfamiliar—sharp, minty, with an underlying edge that made her pulse jump.

Not that she had any real interest in him. He wasn’t her type in any way. Still, up close, he wasn’t bad-looking. Better than some of the pretty-boy actors she’d seen around.

Fine. Eyes closed. Get it over with.

A slow, slightly tipsy smile curved her lips. "Mr. Pierce, don’t worry. Even if you’re terrible at this, I won’t laugh."

She had to salvage some dignity, even in defeat. If nothing else, she could annoy him.

His expression flickered.

Before she could overthink it, Isabella leaned in.

But Donovan didn’t give her time to hesitate.

His kiss was relentless—a storm of heat and demand that left her breathless. His tongue claimed her mouth with a skill that made her knees weak.

Damn. He’s good at this.

Inside the private room, Evelyn Sinclair couldn’t sit still. Worry gnawed at her. What if something happened to Isabella?

Ignoring the protests of the others, she pushed the door open and stepped out—

And froze.

Past the couple locked in their heated embrace, her gaze landed on the man standing just beyond them.

"Alexander?"

The name shattered the moment.

Isabella recoiled like she’d been burned. She shoved Donovan away, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, her face draining of color.

Donovan’s eyes darkened, but he turned, his attention shifting to the newcomer.

Alexander Sterling stood there, an unshakable presence wrapped in quiet, icy elegance. The air around him was cool, detached—not hostile, but not welcoming either. It was just him, that natural, untouchable reserve that made people hesitate before approaching.

His gaze settled on Evelyn, and his voice softened. "Your leg just healed, and you’re already out drinking without telling me?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but Isabella cut in, stepping forward. "Alexander, I’m sorry. I was the one who invited Evelyn. I—"

He looked at her then, his expression polite but distant. "Evelyn needs to take her medication. You can reschedule another time."

The words held no anger, but Isabella felt the weight of his disapproval anyway.

Shame burned through her. She felt like a child caught sneaking out past curfew.

Evelyn quickly intervened. "I just came out to relax, and you still caught me. What are you doing here, Alexander?"

She didn’t remember him mentioning any plans tonight.

His answer was clipped. "I was looking for someone."

He wasn’t going to elaborate, not in front of outsiders. He checked his watch. "Ten minutes. I’ll wait for you outside."

With that, he turned and strode toward the private room he’d originally been heading to.

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Then she glanced at Isabella. Her best friend looked like she’d seen a ghost—pale, shaken, her usual confidence shattered.

Of all people to run into tonight, it had to be him.

"Isabella, are you okay? Did you drink too much?"

Evelyn reached out, pressing a hand to Isabella’s forehead, but there was no fever.

Isabella forced a smile. "Just tired. I’ll wrap things up here. You should go with Alexander."

Evelyn sighed. Even if she wanted to stay, she couldn’t refuse now.

Her gaze flicked to Donovan, who was still staring in the direction Alexander had gone.

The hostility in his eyes was unmistakable.

Evelyn tensed. Without knowing who this man really was, she couldn’t risk provoking him.

She smiled at Isabella. "Come with me. Alexander can drop you off first."

Isabella never turned down a chance like this.

But Donovan spoke up. "Ms. Montgomery, I can give you a ride."
###Chapter 837

Evelyn could see the wariness in Isabella's eyes. If Donovan Pierce offered to drive her home, it would be like walking straight into a trap.

Isabella wanted nothing to do with him. The contract wasn’t signed—why bother playing nice anymore?

Not a chance.

"No, thanks," Isabella said smoothly, linking her arm with Evelyn’s. "We’ve all had a bit too much tonight. Let’s just head back separately."

She flashed a polite smile before turning to the guests inside, offering quick apologies. Then, with a sharp nod to her assistant, she grabbed her coat and strode out.

The moment they stepped outside, Evelyn noticed the forced smile on Isabella’s face. Something was off.

Before she could ask, Alexander Sterling emerged behind them.

Isabella’s expression shifted instantly.

Then Evelyn saw her—the woman standing just behind Alexander.

Soft features, elegant poise, radiating warmth.

"Amelia?"

Alexander’s usual icy demeanor melted as he turned, offering his hand to help her down the steps.

The way they looked at each other—like the rest of the world didn’t exist.

Isabella’s face drained of color.

Evelyn frowned, trying to place the woman. She looked familiar, but—

"Don’t you remember?" Isabella forced a laugh, though her voice was tight. "Amelia Sinclair. The most popular girl in school, two years above us."

Ah. Right.

Evelyn barely recalled her.

Alexander shot her an amused look. "Your memory’s not as sharp as Isabella’s."

Amelia was effortlessly graceful, her smile warm and genuine.

"I lost the 'most popular' title the second Evelyn transferred in," she teased lightly. "We were all busy with graduation—no surprise if you don’t remember me."

Evelyn smiled back, but her attention flickered to Isabella. The way her shoulders slumped, the quiet devastation in her eyes.

She had always loved Alexander. Never said it. Never acted on it.

And now, this.

Evelyn cleared her throat. "So, you came for Amelia? I thought you were here to pick me up."

Alexander rolled his eyes. "Get in the car."

He opened the passenger door for Amelia, his touch lingering just a second too long.

Isabella stood frozen.

Evelyn’s chest ached for her.

"Alexander, my driver’s waiting. I’ll take Isabella home—I need to grab something from her place anyway. You two go ahead."

A flicker of irritation crossed his face.

Amelia leaned out the window, grinning. "Evelyn, your brother’s about to lose his temper."

Alexander sighed, tapping her forehead affectionately. "I don’t have the patience for kids."

Then, without another word, he got in the car and drove off.

Evelyn turned.

Isabella’s eyes were red.

She didn’t know what to say.
###Chapter 838

No words were spoken aloud, but Evelyn understood Isabella's heart perfectly. Since Isabella remained silent, Evelyn chose to play ignorant.

Alexander Sterling's treatment of Isabella had always been purely based on her status as Evelyn's closest friend. His behavior toward her was no different than how he treated Natalie Beaumont.

Alexander remained indifferent to any woman who showed interest in him. Evelyn often thought it would be nearly impossible for him to ever settle down with anyone.

Yet what Evelyn witnessed today proved there might be exceptions - like Amelia Sinclair.

Isabella couldn't take it anymore. She suddenly doubled over, crouching down to hug her knees. Her shoulders trembled with silent, desperate sobs.

Evelyn sighed deeply.

Naturally, her loyalty lay with her best friend. But she couldn't force Alexander to return Isabella's feelings.

Evelyn crouched beside Isabella without speaking.

The sound of Isabella's crying stirred painful memories in Evelyn. A sharp, numbing ache pierced her heart.

Her eyes burned instantly.

Whoever fell in love first was destined to become the more vulnerable one.

When Evelyn first loved Nathan Blackwood, she'd been brave once - then spent three years humbling herself. Escaping that marriage had been excruciatingly difficult.

She'd offered her whole heart, expecting Nathan to see it and respond. He never did. Perhaps because he chose not to see it.

Suddenly, a shadow blocked the light before her. Evelyn looked up with reddened eyes, startled to find herself staring at the man looming over them. His dark, intimidating gaze pinned her in place. His long lashes framed eyes filled with stormy intensity as his voice turned dangerously low. "Who hurt you?"

Of all people to encounter at this moment - Nathan Blackwood. Evelyn couldn't hide the vulnerability in her eyes fast enough. This was the last person she wanted witnessing her weakness.

The man's concern was unmistakable. 'She's crying here because someone hurt her! Who dares?' Nathan's mind already conjured a hundred painful retributions.

Evelyn composed herself. Beside her, Isabella's sobs quieted.

Determined to prevent Nathan from noticing anything, Evelyn spoke his name softly. "Nathan—"

He leaned closer, his body radiating cold intensity, his breathing heavy.

Evelyn clenched her teeth. "Could you—"

Nathan tensed at her hesitation. "Hmm?"

Exhaling sharply, Evelyn said, "Could you get lost?" Nathan froze. Evelyn stood, shaking out her numb legs. Her expression turned calm, edged with irritation.

"Why do I keep seeing you everywhere?"

Nathan's dark eyes darkened further. The coldness faded momentarily, revealing a flash of pain. "Fate keeps bringing us together—"

"Stop the nonsense," Evelyn cut him off. "I know the club owner. He told me everything."

Nathan admitted the truth - there was no point hiding it. Evelyn laughed bitterly. 'Typical Nathan.'

He repeated his question. "Who hurt you?"

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Stop imagining things. We crouched too long and got lightheaded from poor circulation. We're fine now."

Nathan frowned, clearly unfamiliar with this explanation.

Yet her reasoning sounded plausible, and lacking medical expertise, he couldn't argue.

Internally, Nathan marveled. 'Evelyn's incredible.' His relief showed as his expression softened.

Before he could respond, Evelyn touched Isabella's shoulder.

"We're leaving now. Do as you please, Mr. Blackwood!"

Nathan insisted, "I'll escort you home."

No gentleman would let two women return alone at night.
###Chapter 839

Evelyn gestured toward the sleek black car idling nearby. "No need. My driver will take us."

"Goodbye."

With practiced ease, she used the cover of darkness to shield Isabella, swiftly guiding her into the vehicle.

Nathan was too focused on Evelyn to notice the woman beside her.

He didn’t suspect a thing.

Just as Evelyn reached to shut the door, a strong hand stopped her.

His fingers were elegant yet powerful.

Half of Nathan’s face was shadowed, his sharp jawline accentuated by the dim light. He looked like he had something to say—something heavy.

Evelyn met his gaze.

Nathan hesitated, his voice rough with restraint. "Evelyn… do you hate me for showing up like this? I just wanted to see you. I swear I’m not trying to make trouble."

The words were uncharacteristically vulnerable.

Evelyn blinked, studying him for a long moment.

Since when did Nathan Blackwood speak like this?

The silence stretched. Even the driver shifted uncomfortably. Isabella glanced back, sensing the tension. Nathan’s patience was fraying. Was this the wrong move?

He’d already failed with force. Maybe sincerity would work.

His expression darkened with frustration. Just as he was about to snap, Evelyn finally spoke. "Mr. Blackwood, did you forget to take your medication today?"

Nathan froze.

Before he could react, Evelyn pushed his hand away. "Drive."

The car sped off, leaving Nathan standing in the cold, his face stormy.

Medication? She thinks I’ve lost my mind?

His usual arrogance returned, his gaze sharpening like a blade. But as he watched her car disappear, something flickered in his eyes—something dangerously close to defeat.

Why isn’t she falling for this?

His jaw tightened. No. I don’t accept failure.

His phone buzzed. Harrison.

Nathan answered curtly. "Speak."

"Reginald Blackwood just secretly brought someone in from overseas. He’s making his move."

After their last confrontation, Nathan’s grandfather had been biding his time. Nathan hadn’t bothered digging into the old man’s schemes—until now.

A slow smirk curved his lips.

Finally, something interesting.

"Understood."

He hung up. Harrison frowned. This wasn’t just another power play.

Reginald Blackwood wasn’t just any opponent. He was the man who’d built Blackwood Industries from nothing. The man who’d handed Nathan his empire.

And the man who could still tear it all down.

Rumors were spreading—whispers of a war between grandfather and grandson, one that could destroy the company.

But Nathan never fought without certainty.

He always knew the outcome before the first shot was fired.

Evelyn dropped Isabella off at her apartment. The ride had been silent.

Now, Isabella hesitated at the door.

"Evelyn, I—"

Evelyn smiled. "Whatever you decide, I’ve got your back."

Isabella’s eyes burned. She bit her lip hard.

Her face was as flushed as her eyes.

"I spent every moment with Alexander trying to be perfect. And now? He saw me—like that—with another man. It’s over."
###Chapter 840

Isabella's lips curled into a bitter smile, laced with despair.

She turned abruptly and strode toward the wine cabinet. Her fingers wrapped around several expensive bottles of Bordeaux before slamming them onto the marble counter.

Evelyn sighed. "You can't force these things."

A heavy silence settled between them. Then—crack—Isabella's palm struck her own cheek with brutal force.

Evelyn flinched, rushing forward to grab her wrist. "Isabella!"

Her heart ached at the sight. Isabella had always been the wild one, untouchable, unshaken. But now? The floodgates had burst open, and there was no stopping the torrent.

Alexander Sterling's expression had twisted in disgust earlier when he witnessed Isabella locking lips with Donovan Pierce. And she'd noticed.

That was the moment her composure shattered.

She knew. There was no winning this.

In Alexander's world, she had never even been a contender.

If not for Evelyn, he wouldn't have spared her a second glance.

Isabella poured a full glass of wine and downed it in one burning gulp.

"Evelyn, swear you won't tell anyone. I don't need an audience for this humiliation."

As if Evelyn would. She studied her best friend, worry gnawing at her. "Why didn't you ever tell him?"

Would it have changed anything?

Isabella let out a hollow laugh, lifting her gaze.

"You know the difference between me and Amelia Sinclair? I spent years trying to be her, but I could never measure up. Her family lost everything in college, so she left your brother, moved abroad, and built herself from nothing. And yet—her eyes? Still that same clear, untouched light. Seeing her today was like stepping back in time."

If Amelia had been tainted by the world—if she'd grown greedy or jaded—Isabella might have stood a chance. But no. Amelia's resilience was pure, untarnished.

Unlike Isabella, who'd danced through the shadows of the business world without a care. She played men like instruments—except the one she actually wanted. Because with him? She was terrified.

Amelia's luck was infuriating. After nearly a decade, she and Alexander found their way back to each other. No bitterness, no resentment. Just love that never faded.

When Amelia returned to Montecito, all it took was one step toward him. And Alexander? He ran.

So Isabella was destined to lose.

Evelyn watched helplessly, unsure how to comfort her.

This wasn't like Lucas and Natalie. Lucas had feelings for Natalie, and Natalie wavered—but there was no third person between them. Alexander, though? He belonged to Amelia. That left no room for Isabella.

Soon, the alcohol took over.

Evelyn guided her to bed, waiting until her breathing evened out. But leaving her alone felt wrong, so she curled up on the couch instead.

Dawn arrived with sharp sunlight slicing through the curtains.

Isabella emerged from the bedroom just as Evelyn rubbed her eyes.

Their gazes met—last night's confession hanging between them.

Isabella smirked, no trace of shame. "Pathetic, right?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "If you want to fight for him, I'll help."

She could make Alexander see. Isabella's feelings mattered too.

Isabella tossed her a yogurt from the fridge.

"No. I've thought about it. This is a dead end. Why force it and make things messy? It was just a stupid crush. I won't be the woman who ruins something real. That’s not who I am."
###Chapter 841

Evelyn's brow furrowed before she let out a soft chuckle. Isabella's words perfectly captured her fiery personality - brutally honest yet razor-sharp.

"Besides, maybe I was only so upset last night because I was drunk and lost that deal. Thank goodness you were there to stop me from making a complete fool of myself. Can you imagine the humiliation?"

Whether Isabella meant every word or not, Evelyn could tell her friend was genuinely trying to move on from her feelings for Alexander.

Evelyn pulled Isabella into a tight embrace. "Don't worry, I'll introduce you to someone far better! The world's full of amazing men. And let's be real - making money should be our top priority right now. Why waste time on heartbreak?"

Isabella opened her mouth but couldn't argue with Evelyn's logic.

Knowing her friend needed space to process everything, Evelyn left early for the office.

After changing into fresh clothes from her emergency wardrobe and applying minimal makeup, Evelyn looked radiant and ready to conquer the day.

Bennett knocked before entering, delivering his usual morning briefing.

"There's movement at Blackwood Industries. Several shareholders seem restless."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Exactly as expected.

Old Master Blackwood wasn't the type to surrender without a fight - not while he still had breath in his body.

"Where's my brother?"

The question slipped out before Evelyn realized it, her thoughts still lingering on Isabella.

Bennett smirked. "President Sterling took a two-week vacation and delegated all company matters to you."

"Two weeks?" Evelyn's eyes widened. "Just like that? Without warning?"

"He was afraid you'd refuse," Bennett admitted.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Typical Alexander - dumping everything in her lap without consultation. Bennett, usually so professional, suddenly turned gossipy. "Rumor has it he's flying overseas to help his girlfriend with something, but really it's just a romantic getaway."

If even Bennett knew about Alexander's relationship, it meant her brother was serious about Amelia Sinclair. Evelyn's indifferent expression made Bennett assume she already knew - after all, they were siblings.

Evelyn sighed internally. 'Fine. Alexander deserves happiness too. I won't screw this up.'

"Alright then. Bring me everything that needs immediate attention."

Bennett nodded and exited.

Blackwood Industries

Employees sensed the unusual tension the moment they stepped into the building that morning. The usual office chatter was conspicuously absent, replaced by an eerie silence.

Nathan emerged from his car, adjusting his suit jacket with a sharp tug. He strode through the lobby with long, purposeful steps, flanked by Harrison and several executives. Their grim expressions sent chills down spines.

Nathan bypassed his office entirely, heading straight for the conference room. Harrison moved ahead to open the doors, revealing Old Master Blackwood seated at the head of the table, face thunderous.

The room was packed with shareholders and Blackwood family representatives - all loyal to the old man.

In just days, Old Master Blackwood had rallied considerable support through whatever means necessary. His confidence was palpable.

Nathan's lips curled into a cold smile as he took the seat directly opposite his grandfather.

At first glance, Nathan's side appeared outnumbered. Department heads filed in behind him, creating a clear divide - two opposing forces preparing for battle.

Nathan's piercing gaze swept across the room, making several attendees shrink in their seats.

'Quite the production,' Nathan thought dryly.

Finally, he spoke, voice dripping with icy amusement. "Good morning, Old Master Blackwood."

Though the shareholders present were his elders, Nathan's position meant he owed no individual greetings. His natural dominance prevented anyone from accusing him of disrespect.

Old Master Blackwood snorted. Seeing Nathan's arrogance only fueled his rage.

He'd raised this ungrateful wretch who now dared defy him at every turn. It was time for a lesson.

'Let him understand,' the old man thought viciously, 'that he only holds this position because of my mercy.'
###Chapter 842

The boardroom was thick with tension.

Not a single voice broke the silence.

Nathan Blackwood lounged in his seat, utterly unbothered. His expression gave nothing away—no panic, no urgency. Only patience.

Whoever spoke first would lose the upper hand.

In the end, Reginald Blackwood cracked.

The old man’s sharp, calculating gaze narrowed. Age hadn’t dulled the shrewdness in his eyes.

"You may have grown, Nathan, but you’re still too green," Reginald said, voice dripping with condescension. "After consulting the shareholders, we’ve concluded you’re unfit for this position. A vote will be held to appoint a new CEO."

No sugarcoating. No pretense. Just a direct declaration of war.

One of the Ferguson family’s lackeys coughed, attempting to soften the blow.

"Reginald merely suggests you take a sabbatical abroad. When you return, you’ll still have a place at Blackwood Industries—"

A place? More like a demotion to glorified intern.

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smirk. His wealth far surpassed Blackwood Industries. He owned countless companies, each more lucrative than the last. He didn’t need this empire.

But no one forced him out.

Ever.

His gaze locked onto Reginald. "Care to clarify, Grandfather? In front of everyone?"

Nathan held 61% of the shares. Majority stakeholder.

Removing him wouldn’t be so simple.

Reginald’s voice turned icy. "Ten percent of those shares were entrusted to you. That trust can be revoked."

A pause. Then, the old man struck harder.

"Blackwood Industries doesn’t tolerate ingrates. Look at the damage you’ve caused—crisis after crisis. Thirty billion lost overnight. How do you answer to the shareholders for that?"

Nathan almost laughed.

Reginald was pinning his own failures—his and Sophia’s—on him. Sacrificing his own reputation just to win.

Pathetic.

Nathan’s disdain was palpable. Once, Reginald had been formidable. Now? Reduced to cheap tricks against his own grandson.

His eyes flicked around the room. Adrian and Charles were absent. Smart. They knew better than to get involved.

"Answer?" Nathan’s voice was lethally calm. "To whom? Without two-thirds shareholder approval, your little coup won’t hold."

Reginald’s jaw tightened. "You risked this company for a woman. You’ve lost the right to lead. The board agrees—I’m taking over."

Smug. Arrogant.

Nathan scanned the room. Silence.

They feared him. When he became CEO, he’d stripped their privileges, cut their excesses. Now they hoped to profit from the family feud.

But they wouldn’t gamble unless they were sure Reginald would win.

Nathan’s smile was razor-thin. "Is that so?"

No one spoke.

Reginald clapped his hands.

The conference room doors swung open.
###Chapter 843

Margaret Blackwood and Sophia Blackwood, absent from Montecito for months, suddenly appeared before the assembled crowd.

A ripple of shock spread through the room.

Tears streamed down Margaret's face as she rushed to Reginald Blackwood's side. "Father, you must help me! Nathan exiled me. He's abandoned this family completely. That rebellious boy never cared about any of us! Even as his mother, I can't tolerate this anymore!"

As Nathan's biological mother, Margaret's public opposition made his position seem untenable.

Nathan remained stone-faced, his icy gaze fixed on Margaret without emotion.

Sophia stood meekly nearby, too intimidated by Nathan's authority to act out.

Margaret gathered her courage to confront her son. Sobbing dramatically, she alternated between glaring at Nathan and appealing to the others. "My husband still holds shares. I officially endorse the Chairman's decision on his behalf."

The boardroom erupted in murmurs. "This settles it then!"
"Nathan has no way out now. Blackwood Industries' leadership is about to change."
"What can he do? Will Mr. Blackwood really be ousted?"

Margaret's appearance became the decisive factor.

Not a single Blackwood family member spoke in Nathan's defense. Strangely calm, Nathan only frowned slightly before suddenly laughing - a chilling sound that made everyone's skin crawl.

Instantly, the atmosphere grew oppressive as the temperature seemed to drop. Nathan raised his hand, and Harrison immediately handed him a document.

Without glancing at it, Nathan slammed the papers onto the table with force. Loosening his tie, his voice cut through the room like ice. "Read this. My father's signed share transfer agreement. No one speaks for him now."

Margaret paled, her eyes locked on the contract where Charles Blackwood's signature stood out in bold ink.

When Margaret had begged Charles for help abroad, he'd ignored her. Now she realized why - while she returned to Montecito to oppose Nathan, her husband had secretly transferred his shares to their son.

Her own husband and son had united against her? Margaret's expression twisted in panic. 'Then why did I return? To become a laughingstock?'

She whirled toward Reginald, who looked equally stunned. The old patriarch never expected Charles to transfer shares without consultation.

Clearly, Charles had chosen sides in the power struggle between Reginald and Nathan. His absence meant avoiding direct confrontation with his father.

Reginald thought bitterly, 'My spineless son would go this far for his own child?'

Nathan gave no quarter, producing a second document. "I intended to keep this civil as family, but since you've forced my hand, let's settle everything now."

His piercing gaze swept the room, revealing ruthless determination beneath the cold exterior.

"When I first took over Blackwood Industries, I discovered accounting discrepancies and questionable contracts signed by certain shareholders."

A deadly pause.

"Perfect timing - I'll have investigators thoroughly examine these matters. Financial irregularities are serious offenses. I'm certain under Reginald Blackwood's leadership, all transactions were aboveboard."

With his final words, Nathan stood abruptly, his chair screeching across the floor. After one last withering look at the assembly, he strode out without hesitation.

###Chapter 844

The color drained from every shareholder's face in an instant.

Back when they worked for Reginald Blackwood, the old man had been sentimental. He'd turned a blind eye to their corruption.

They'd grown bold, not even bothering to cover their tracks.

As long as the company stayed silent, their illicit activities continued uninterrupted.

Then Nathan Blackwood took control. He cut off their illegal income streams immediately. Though he didn't prosecute past crimes, he consolidated Blackwood Industries' power completely.

For years, they'd suppressed their resentment.

They thought those dark days were behind them. But Nathan had been collecting evidence all along.

Now the damning proof lay before them - enough to send them all to prison for life.

Cold sweat drenched their clothes. What right did they have to choose sides between Reginald and Nathan?

Few among these shareholders had clean hands. They finally understood Nathan's calm demeanor from the beginning.

He'd been holding their death sentence this entire time.

As Nathan left, panic spread through the room like wildfire.

One by one, they jumped to their feet, faces twisted in terror.

"What do we do now? Nathan's played his trump card!"

"Chairman, if this blows up, you'll go down with us. Maybe we should drop this..."

"Exactly! Who wouldn't want to retire peacefully?"

"I have urgent matters. I'm leaving."

Even those with clean records fled in fear. The situation had reversed completely.

Defeating Nathan? A pipe dream. How foolish they'd been!

Shareholders scattered like roaches. Some tried apologizing at Nathan's office, but he refused to see them.

In the conference room...

Reginald Blackwood sat rigid, face purple with rage. This was his oversight. He should have cleaned house before retiring.

They'd handed Nathan their weaknesses on a silver platter.

Nathan had waited ten years to use this. Now it served its purpose perfectly. The meeting ended in under twenty minutes - record time.

Nathan's victory was absolute. Flawless.

He'd prepared for every contingency.

Reginald sighed deeply. He had to admit - Nathan surpassed him.

Margaret Blackwood paled as she turned to her father. "Dad, what now?"

Sophia Blackwood regretted coming with Margaret. Nathan would never forgive her now.

A long silence stretched before Reginald finally moved to leave. Then Harrison stepped forward.

Nathan's assistant placed a prepared document before the old man.

A pre-written resignation letter. One signature would make it official.

Reginald's eyes turned glacial. His face contorted with fury.

Harrison maintained a polite smile.

"Chairman, every farce needs an ending. Mr. Blackwood gave you your chance at retaliation. You failed spectacularly. Continuing this charade while remaining in your position damages the company's reputation."

"Why not retire with dignity? Don't sacrifice Blackwood Industries just to spite the President."

Spite him? Reginald thought bitterly.

His sharp gaze pierced Harrison. "Is he that impatient?"

"Chairman, when you conspired with Ms. Blackwood, you jeopardized your standing at Blackwood Industries."

"The President didn't do this for the company. Ten Blackwood Industries couldn't equal his personal worth. He acts for the family's good. You should be grateful."
###Chapter 845

Harrison knew exactly how far to push when he spoke. The words carried an edge, but it was infinitely better than groveling.

Reginald Blackwood fell silent for several heartbeats, his piercing gaze locked onto Harrison. "And if I refuse to sign?"

A cold smile curved Harrison's lips. "Then that evidence goes straight to the courts. The entire Blackwood legacy crumbles by your own hand."

This wasn't cruelty from Nathan. Their bribery schemes had been brazen, leaving no room for mercy.

The old patriarch's expression darkened, his eyes becoming fathomless pools as he weighed his options.

After an eternity, Reginald's gnarled fingers finally closed around the pen.

Refusal meant facing the wrath of those very shareholders who'd stood by him moments ago. They'd tear him apart for dragging them down.

Nathan's trap had sprung perfectly.

In his office, Nathan stood like a storm cloud, staring through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The sunlight breaking through the dispersing clouds painted his pale skin in harsh contrasts.

Harrison knocked and placed the signed documents on the obsidian desk. "It's done, sir. Though he demanded the shareholders' evidence in return."

Nathan's already frigid expression turned glacial. "Fine. Are the other arrangements in place?"

He couldn't care less about the evidence. Reginald would burn it immediately—but that wasn't the real objective anyway. Harrison nodded. "Foreign investors have already made contact—"

"Move carefully." Nathan cut him off without turning. "No slip-ups."

Harrison hesitated. "Mrs. Blackwood and Miss Blackwood are still waiting. They insist on seeing you—"

"Denied." The words cracked like ice.

The boardroom betrayal had extinguished the last embers of familial affection. His own mother publicly branding him a criminal? What use was such poisonous kinship?

Even his subordinates showed more loyalty.

Harrison couldn't suppress a pang of sympathy.

The office hummed with tense silence.

Nathan finally sat, long fingers flipping through the documents with surgical precision before shoving them back. "Have HR issue the announcement immediately. Post it across all platforms. The Blackwood era ends today."

"Yes, sir."

This ruthlessness wasn't personal. But after Reginald's schemes against Sterling Enterprises—against Evelyn—Nathan would raze empires to keep her safe. The memory of those early plots still made his blood run cold.

The announcement detonated like a financial bomb.

Everyone knew Reginald Blackwood clung to power like a drowning man to driftwood. For him to surrender the chairmanship voluntarily? Unthinkable.

Overnight, the corporate landscape shifted seismically.

Those who'd backed Nathan stood firm. The rest? Scrambling like rats from a sinking ship.

After the disastrous meeting, they came crawling—only to find every door locked. Nathan offered no quarter, no negotiation. Their panic became palpable.

To the outside world, the message was clear: Nathan Blackwood wasn't just Ferguson Corporation's leader—he was its undisputed sovereign.

The balance of power had crystallized in a single night.

By dawn, the battle lines were drawn.

And Nathan stood victorious.
###Chapter 846

The evening was thick with silence, the sky a canvas of deepening indigo. Sterling Manor stood quiet under the gathering dusk.

Lucas was carefully slicing an apple for Evelyn, who lounged on the sofa with Natalie, flipping through the latest celebrity gossip.

William was in the kitchen, preparing the fresh catch of the day.

When Evelyn saw Blackwood Industries' official announcement, her fingers stilled over the magazine page.

Natalie noticed it too. "Rumors were swirling about Blackwood Industries changing hands," she murmured. "But I never expected it to be Chairman Blackwood stepping down."

This wasn’t just a corporate shuffle—it was a seismic shift. The implications were staggering.

Evelyn’s chest tightened for Nathan.

She remembered his words after Sophia’s spectacle—how Reginald Blackwood had orchestrated it all and promised an explanation.

At the time, Evelyn had scoffed. What explanation could justify such cruelty?

But this—this was his answer.

Her pulse stuttered. The cost was unthinkable.

Lucas smirked, unbothered. "Blackwood Industries has been Nathan’s for years. I doubt the old man was ever a match for his grandson."

Natalie nodded. "True. Nathan’s influence extends far beyond Blackwood Industries. The fact that no one dares cross him speaks volumes."

Evelyn stayed silent, her thoughts a tempest.

William joined them, sinking into an armchair. Evelyn handed him a cup of tea, which he accepted with a grateful sigh. "Honestly, I’ve never liked Reginald Blackwood. What Nathan did—it’s poetic justice."

Like Evelyn, William had immediately grasped the deeper meaning.

Their eyes met, understanding passing between them. William’s brow furrowed. "I heard the board, even his own mother and sister, pressured him to step down. For Reginald to go that far—it’s ruthless."

Lucas paused mid-slice. "Exactly. Now the entire company sees Nathan as the villain. They praise him to his face but stab him in the back with whispers."

Evelyn couldn’t listen anymore. Barefoot, she crossed the room to the window, pressing her palms against the cool glass. The sunset bled crimson over the horizon.

The Blackwoods were vipers, every last one of them.

Yet whenever someone wronged Evelyn, Nathan had never hesitated to hold his own family accountable.

She had every right to despise them—but why did he?

He’d alienated his entire family. Now, when it mattered, no one stood with him.

Nathan was no coward. He refused to straddle the line between loyalty and betrayal.

Evelyn wondered—would she have had the strength to do the same?

William studied Evelyn, then shot Lucas a warning look. "Enough. However you feel about Nathan, he’s saved your sister more than once. Don’t make things worse."

Lucas opened his mouth but snapped it shut, chastened.

Natalie nodded in agreement, watching Evelyn with concern.

Evelyn leaned into the glass, letting the chill steady her.

Then she turned abruptly and snatched up her phone.

William, Lucas, and Natalie exchanged glances—surely she was calling Nathan. They braced to intervene.

Evelyn dialed, her expression unreadable.

"Alexander," she said, voice firm. "I saw there are only two Hermès Himalaya bags left in the world. You wouldn’t dare buy one for Amelia and not me, would you?"

William, Lucas, and Natalie froze.

They’d overestimated the situation entirely.
###Chapter 847

Lucas had always been obsessed with gossip. "Alexander's dream girl, his first love and current girlfriend, the woman he loves most besides Evelyn!"

Natalie suddenly remembered. "The most popular girl in school before Evelyn? When she broke up with Alexander, she seemed to have left the country."

Lucas nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly! Her family went bankrupt. Amelia had no choice but to leave. The impressive part? She never begged Alexander for help or played the victim card."

He leaned forward, eyes sparkling with drama. "She rebuilt everything from scratch overseas. Started her own investment firm. And get this - despite countless suitors, she's stayed single all these years, just like Alexander!"

Lucas practically vibrated with excitement. This material was gold - he could already see it as a bestselling romance plot.

William Sterling raised an eyebrow suspiciously. "You investigated her?"

"Of course I did!" Lucas huffed. "This concerns my brother's happiness! I won't let some random woman take advantage of him. The moment I heard Amelia returned to Montecito, I had her thoroughly vetted."

His overprotective act was both irritating and amusing. William looked ready to strangle him. "Your brother's a grown man! Checking every potential girlfriend's background? Who'd dare date him with you around?"

Lucas scooted away defensively. "I was just being responsible!" He muttered under his breath, "Shouldn't Dad be doing this anyway? Why's he mad when I handle it?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Do you really think Alexander would fall for just anyone? You're overthinking this."

Natalie nodded in agreement. "Exactly!"

Lucas's face flushed with embarrassment. Even Natalie wasn't taking his side. Evelyn grabbed her phone and headed upstairs, with Natalie cheerfully following. "Evelyn, your family is so entertaining!"

Natalie had been staying at Sterling Manor for days. William treated her like a daughter, making her feel completely at home. The warmth of family was intoxicating.

Evelyn smiled. "Lucas lives to stir up drama. He's constantly creating chaos, and Dad always puts him in his place. He never learns."

Natalie laughed. "I've got a business trip starting tomorrow. Adrian's been MIA lately too, so I won't be coming back after this..."

"No rush," Evelyn said. "Stay as long as you want."

Natalie shook her head. "It's been too long already. I don't want to give Lucas any false hope." Her voice softened. "You know how persistent he gets."

Evelyn studied her friend. "Maybe reconsider things with Lucas? I know my brother - he's serious about you this time."

After a long pause, Natalie nodded with a small smile. "I'll think about it."

"Good." Evelyn grinned. "Then I'll help you move tomorrow." They shared a knowing look.

Evelyn's phone buzzed. Nathan's name flashed on the screen. She frowned as she opened the message.

[Evelyn, my feelings are my choice. Don't feel pressured. It would break my heart if you did.]

Her grip tightened on the phone. Fantastic. Any lingering sympathy she had for Nathan evaporated instantly.

So much for sleeping tonight. She typed a sharp reply.

[Nathan Blackwood, must you always sound like a bad romance novel?]

His response came instantly. [I'm being restrained.]

She rolled her eyes. [A grown man saying these things? Disgusting.]

Minutes passed with no reply. Evelyn tossed her phone aside in frustration, washed up, and went to bed - though sleep would clearly be impossible now.
###Chapter 848

Nathan Blackwood froze at Evelyn Sinclair's brutal honesty.

His ego took a direct hit. It took several minutes for his breathing to steady.

'Evelyn just called me old?' Nathan's fingers hovered over his phone screen, typing and deleting responses repeatedly.

His chest tightened uncomfortably.

Another sleepless night of emotional damage.

At midnight, Nathan summoned Theodore Winslow back from vacation.

The city slept in darkness outside his office windows.

Nathan was still working at this ungodly hour. The man never rested.

When Theodore entered, he found his boss in a cloud of cigarette smoke.

Nathan's sharp features looked almost ghostly in the dim lighting. Theodore rushed to open a window before the smoke detector went off.

Tomorrow's tabloids would've screamed: "Blackwood Industries CEO Found Dead From Smoke Inhalation?"

"Mr. Blackwood, what happened?" Theodore's voice dripped with concern.

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Am I old?" His voice rasped from smoking.

Confused, Theodore cautiously took the offered phone. Only he had clearance to touch Nathan's personal device.

The text thread with Evelyn made everything clear.

'The lady doesn't pull punches,' Theodore thought. 'Ms. Sinclair just destroyed his self-esteem! He's more upset than when dealing with Reginald Blackwood!'

Theodore forced a smile. "Sir, you're in your prime! Ms. Sinclair didn't mean it. She's probably regretting—"

Nathan's icy stare cut him off. 'Do I look stupid?'

Undeterred, Theodore continued, "Ms. Sinclair values substance over looks. She fell for you before—that proves you're her type! She's just pushing you away. We must double down!"

Nathan's expression shifted slightly. The logic soothed his bruised ego.

'Exactly. Younger men lack my accomplishments. Older men lack my physique. I'm perfect.'

Nathan stubbed out his cigarette and grabbed his jacket.

"Sir?" Theodore blinked as his boss strode toward the door.

"Going home."

In the car, Nathan finally replied to Evelyn:

[Age is just a number for a man of my caliber. No apology needed—my heart remains yours. XOXO]

Evelyn jolted awake to her phone's chime.

With Alexander Sterling traveling, she kept her phone on for emergencies.

The midnight notification made her pulse spike—until she saw the sender.

Her blood ran cold.

XOXO?!

Nathan Blackwood had officially lost his mind.

Evelyn threw her phone aside and squeezed her eyes shut.

But sleep brought only nightmares—all starring a certain delusional billionaire.
###Chapter 849

The following morning.

Evelyn arrived at Sterling Enterprises. The afternoon client meeting originally scheduled for Alexander had been reassigned to her.

They agreed to meet at the country club.

Just as Evelyn was about to leave, her phone rang. Preston Sinclair’s name flashed on the screen.

Preston was always polished and considerate, knowing exactly when to push forward and when to step back.

After that terrifying incident, he had deliberately kept his distance, giving her space to recover.

"Evelyn, would you like to go shopping this afternoon?"

She frowned. "Mr. Sinclair, is this a new hobby of yours?"

Preston chuckled, his voice smooth and warm.

"Oliver heard about what happened and insisted I make it up to you. He said I should buy out the entire mall if that’s what it takes to make you happy again."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh. A child’s logic was so simple.

Little Oliver had no idea how much money that would actually cost.

"I forgave him a long time ago," she said. "If anything, I should apologize for not understanding his innocent intentions."

Preston laughed softly. "But I still have to keep my promise. Will you give me the chance? If not shopping, then dinner? Or a movie? Anything you want. I’m at your disposal."

Evelyn brushed it off lightly. "We’ll talk later."

After hanging up, she changed into casual attire and headed to the country club with Bennett. Though the air was still crisp, the sunlight was pleasant, lifting her spirits.

This partnership had only been established in recent years.

Vincent Caldwell was in his forties but could easily pass for early thirties. He had an unremarkable appearance but carried himself with quiet confidence. Having previously dealt with Alexander, he was visibly surprised when Evelyn walked in.

For a brief moment, he stared a little too intently before quickly extending his hand.

"Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn smiled. "Mr. Caldwell, a pleasure to finally meet you."

Bennett stepped in smoothly. "Ms. Sinclair is our CEO. She’s addressed as President Evelyn."

Vincent quickly corrected himself and released her hand, his demeanor shifting to something more respectful.

"Had I known President Evelyn would be joining, I would’ve suggested a different venue. Golf isn’t exactly a lady’s game."

Evelyn’s smile remained easy. "It’s fine. I may not be an expert, but I won’t embarrass myself either."

They played a few holes. Vincent was clearly skilled—even while holding back, he won effortlessly.

Evelyn sighed in defeat. Golf had never been her strength.

Taking a break, she finally relaxed.

Vincent seemed pleased. As they walked back, his gaze flickered toward someone in the distance, his expression tightening briefly before smoothing over.

"President Evelyn, you’ll need more practice. President Alexander is nearly unbeatable."

She arched a brow. "He does enjoy this game."

Vincent finally steered the conversation toward business.

"To be honest, I’d prefer to focus solely on Sterling Enterprises for this contract renewal. But costs have risen, and we’ll need to adjust pricing accordingly."

He studied her reaction carefully before adding, "Though I’m not sure if your signature holds the same weight. Perhaps you should consult President Alexander first?"

Evelyn picked up her water, taking a slow sip. Was he testing her?

No matter how unassuming a businessman appeared, profit always came first.

"If costs increase, we can maintain profit margins by adjusting retail prices. But higher prices mean lower sales. We chose your factory for quality and affordability. If sales drop, the loss won’t be worth it."

Her tone was calm, deliberate.
###Chapter 850

Vincent Caldwell knew Evelyn Sinclair wouldn't agree immediately. He chuckled, "Yes, it's certainly an issue. But sticking to the original price would bankrupt us."

His eyes gleamed with calculation. "President Sinclair, I have a proposal. Your factory currently handles medical device assembly. Why not outsource the entire process to us? We'll manufacture and assemble everything before delivering the finished products. Think of the efficiency gains."

The man's true intentions became clear.

He wanted their core technology.

Sterling Enterprises' high-precision factories handled assembly under strict confidentiality agreements. Outsourcing meant surrendering their competitive advantage.

Evelyn lowered her lashes momentarily. When she looked up, a polite yet guarded smile played on her lips. "Mr. Caldwell, counteroffer - we'll extend the contract to five years. Prioritize Sterling products during this period, and I'll increase prices by twenty percent."

A win-win solution.

She acknowledged rising material costs. Maintaining original prices would eventually ruin Vincent. Alexander Sterling had advised offering incentives to ensure reliable supply. Twenty percent was generous.

Vincent's disappointment showed. The assembly rights interested him more. This wasn't the spoiled heiress rumors described - she was sharper than her brother.

"Twenty percent works," he conceded. "You're quite generous, President Sinclair. Shall we proceed with signing?"

Evelyn nodded to Bennett, who moved to prepare documents. As they waited, a familiar figure caught her eye. Probably another business contact. She dismissed it.

With negotiations concluded, they retreated from the chilly terrace to the clubhouse lobby. Vincent excused himself for an urgent call. Evelyn scrolled through her phone until a shadow fell across her screen.

"Seraphina Devereux?"

Evelyn remembered the reality show contestant well. After Seraphina orchestrated Xavier Delmont's elimination, she'd emerged as the show's biggest winner. Now, the woman stood before her with red-rimmed eyes, her makeup-free face sallow with distress.

Seraphina kept glancing around nervously. "Ms. Sinclair, you know Vincent Caldwell? Please... help me save my daughter."

Evelyn stiffened. Daughter?

Since when was Seraphina a mother? Weren't her affections still fixed on Nathan Blackwood?

"What happened to your daughter?" Evelyn asked carefully.

Seraphina's gaze darted toward where Vincent had disappeared. "He took her. That man's dangerous. She's in his clubhouse suite right now. Please help me get her out."

Her entire body trembled, her voice barely above a whisper.

Evelyn's instincts flared. Could this be a trap?

She arched a brow. "If you know where she is, why involve me? I'm not law enforcement."

Seraphina bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "I swear I'm not lying! Nathan Blackwood would kill me if I deceived you."

At Nathan's name, Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Seraphina did share a unique connection with him - not romantic, but something resembling employer and employee.
###Chapter 851

"Why should I trust you?" Evelyn's voice was ice cold.

She sat perfectly composed, her posture radiating effortless elegance and unshakable confidence.

If there was real danger, Seraphina should've gone to the authorities. Why come to a businesswoman like Evelyn instead?

Seraphina's hands trembled violently as she fumbled with her phone.

She pulled up a photo - a younger version of herself holding an infant. The timestamp showed it was taken nearly six years ago.

"That's my daughter. She's only six. Vincent Caldwell has... tendencies. If he takes her, she won't survive the night!"

Even someone slow on the uptake would recognize the gravity in those words.

"The child is yours and Vincent's?"

Seraphina hesitated before nodding sharply. "When I was starting out in Hollywood, he bankrolled my career. After he discarded me, I hid the pregnancy. He has a history with orphanages - not for charity, but for... other purposes."

She showed Evelyn several disturbing photos - Vincent grinning while holding bruised children.

Evelyn's stomach turned violently.

"I have no leverage against him," Seraphina whispered desperately. "If I go to the police, he'll kill us both. You're my only hope—"

Bennett arrived with contracts in hand, freezing when he saw Seraphina. "Ms. Sinclair, the Pacific Crest documents—"

Evelyn made a snap decision. "Bennett, keep Vincent occupied." Before he could respond, she was already striding toward the elevators with Seraphina. "You know the room number?"

"Suite 2407."

The elevator ride was tense. When they reached the door, Seraphina began hyperventilating. Evelyn silenced her with a look and knocked sharply.

A hulking bodyguard cracked the door open. "State your business."

Behind him, muffled whimpers.

Evelyn flashed a dazzling smile. "Sterling Enterprises. Mr. Caldwell requested my presence."

As the guard reached for his phone, Evelyn exploded into motion. Her sneaker-clad foot smashed the door open.

The guard lunged. She twisted away, seizing his wrist and wrenching it backward with a sickening pop.

Seraphina darted past them.

"Bitch!" A female voice shrieked from inside. "Give her back!"

Glass shattered.

Seraphina came sprinting out clutching a small, sobbing figure.

Evelyn jerked her chin toward the exit. Once they were clear, she turned to leave—

"Rot in hell!"

The cold press of metal against her spine told Evelyn everything.
###Chapter 852

A sudden force jerked Evelyn's arm, pulling her sideways with violent urgency.

The sound of shattering porcelain exploded through the air. Shards sprayed across the exact spot where Evelyn had stood moments before.

She collided with a solid chest that smelled faintly of sandalwood and power. "Mr. Sinclair?"

Evelyn's breath caught. What was Preston doing here?

In one fluid motion, Preston shoved her behind him. His glacial glare pinned the woman chasing Evelyn in place.

The pursuer froze mid-step, recognition draining the color from her face.

Andrew Caldwell arrived at the commotion, his expression shifting from concern to shock. "What's happening here?"

"That bitch stole the child!" the woman spat.

Andrew's jaw tightened. "Two grown adults couldn't watch one child?" He caught himself, glancing at Evelyn and Preston. "Ms. Sinclair, care to explain your presence?"

"Ms. Devereux begged for my help," Evelyn said, stepping forward. "I couldn't ignore a mother's plea."

Andrew's face darkened. "That's my child too! She's mentally unstable - keeps the boy locked away while she parades him between lovers' homes!"

Evelyn recoiled. Both sides claimed abuse. Who was lying?

Preston's fingers interlaced with hers. "Then we'll call the authorities," he declared, voice like tempered steel. "If Evelyn inadvertently aided wrongdoing, we'll make appropriate restitution."

The suggestion electrified Evelyn. Of course - let professionals untangle this mess.

"No police!" the woman shrieked, clutching Andrew's sleeve. "Family matters stay private!"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. This "other woman" called Seraphina vulgar names yet fought to keep her child? Illogical unless...

Andrew wiped his brow. "Ms. Sinclair, let's proceed with our contract signing." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "This... misunderstanding needn't affect business."

The pieces clicked. Evelyn tightened her grip on Preston's hand. These people reeked of deception.
###Chapter 853

Evelyn remained silent, considering the situation carefully.

"The lawyer from my company hasn't arrived yet—he's stuck in traffic. Let's reschedule the signing for another time."

At this point, signing the contract wasn't urgent anymore.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away.

Preston gave a slight nod and followed her, deliberately avoiding the gaze of the couple behind them.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn's expression darkened.

"Mr. Sinclair, who do you think is lying?"

Preston didn't know what Seraphina had said, but he had seen her fleeing earlier with the child in her arms. He recognized her from the celebration party.

Preston narrowed his eyes, hesitating for a brief moment before answering with certainty, "Both of them."

Evelyn looked at him in surprise. Preston offered a faint smile, dispelling the tension that had weighed on her.

It was like a gentle spring rain, soothing her nerves.

Evelyn smiled back.

The elevator reached the lobby, where only Bennett remained waiting. "Where's Seraphina?"

Bennett shook his head. "She ran off. I couldn't stop her."

Seraphina hadn't even bothered to thank them, but Evelyn didn't care.

Bennett glanced at Preston and nodded. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair."

Evelyn frowned in suspicion. Preston smiled warmly and explained, "I was here discussing business and happened to pass by. Bennett asked for my help."

That made sense. Preston had already saved her twice—it would be rude not to treat him to a meal.

"Let's have dinner together?" Evelyn suggested.

Preston agreed without hesitation. "Of course."

On the way, Evelyn called Alexander and filled him in on Vincent's situation.

Alexander didn't know much about Vincent personally—their relationship had been strictly professional.

After hearing the story, Alexander fell silent for a moment. "You did the right thing. Don't sign anything until everything is clear."

Too many business leaders had destroyed their companies due to moral corruption. And this involved Seraphina, a public figure, along with allegations of abuse—a despicable act that would enrage anyone.

While business required some level of social maneuvering, certain lines couldn't be crossed without risking the company's reputation.

Preston chose a quiet, elegant restaurant.

Bennett joined them. The meal was pleasant, free of awkwardness. Afterward, Preston suggested they visit Kingsley Tech to review the project's closing work.

Evelyn had been meaning to check on the progress, so she agreed immediately.

Dominic Kingsley was occupied, so Emily Whitaker accompanied them instead.

Emily, being more familiar with the research progress, delivered a concise and efficient presentation.

Evelyn was sipping her coffee when Emily suddenly lunged toward her. Evelyn barely managed to dodge.

"Emily, calm down!"

Emily froze, then grinned sheepishly. "I haven't seen anyone outside the company in ages!"

Evelyn frowned. "No breaks?"

Emily glanced at Preston, then greeted him before tugging Evelyn's arm.

"Don't even ask. Mr. Blackwood recruited a few genius-level researchers from Denmark. Everyone's still adjusting. They work like machines—we can't afford to fall behind. National pride is at stake!"

Emily even raised a determined fist. Evelyn couldn't help but laugh, though she still felt a pang of sympathy.

"It's been a while since you've seen Donovan, hasn't it?"

Emily flushed, looking away. "Yeah. The Great God Donovan is buried in a classified national research project. He's way busier than I am."

Evelyn had heard Donovan mention he'd be in isolation for at least two months.

Still, she felt bad for Emily.

She grabbed Emily's hand, lips pursed in a pleading pout.

"Emily, you can't break up with him just because you don't see him often!"
###Chapter 854

Emily froze instantly and shook her head. "No way!"

Evelyn finally let out a breath of relief.

She smiled and took a sip of her latte. The group changed into lab coats and headed to the core research facility.

Preston and Bennett were fully engaged in the tour. While they could've just reviewed the data reports, seeing the technology in person made a far greater impact.

Emily led the demonstration at the front.

"Our focus is on intelligent living systems—not just smart home devices, but integrated environmental controls. Temperature, humidity, waterproofing, fire suppression—all automated. The real challenge? Human emotional variability. We've now perfected emotion detection, allowing spaces to adapt based on happiness, anger, sadness—even subtle mood shifts. We've incorporated cutting-edge medical research into this."

She gestured to the display. "The AI chip performs daily health scans without leaving home. It also provides emergency response capabilities anywhere, anytime."

Preston's eyes lit up. The progress exceeded his expectations.

Two massive pods stood before them. Emily extended a hand. "You can step inside for a firsthand experience."

Preston entered without hesitation. Bennett paused briefly before following.

Evelyn remained outside. Emily glanced at her. "Not joining them, Evie?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm sure it's impressive, but I'll wait for the consumer version. Install one in my penthouse when it's ready."

Emily nearly choked on her coffee.

Through the glass, she watched Preston's sharp profile—the noble tilt of his jaw, the effortless elegance in his posture. She sighed dramatically. "Mr. Sinclair gets more devastating by the day. That jawline? Those shoulders? And don't get me started on those legs—"

Evelyn shot her a look. "Emily, my brother Donovan is objectively attractive—"

"Can't see him right now," Emily interrupted, fanning herself. "So I'll admire other masterpieces respectfully."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Some things never changed.

Emily nudged her shoulder playfully. "Seriously though—working alongside someone that gorgeous all day? Doesn't it make your pulse race?"

Evelyn considered this. "We're not together constantly. And no, my heart rate stays normal."

"Impossible!" Emily refused to believe hormones could resist that level of attractiveness.

Evelyn clarified. "Only stock market fluctuations affect my pulse." Translation: money moved her more than men.

Emily blinked. Suddenly Donovan's infamous birthday gifts made sense—why he'd once shrugged and said, "I just give her a blank check." What couldn't Evelyn buy with unlimited funds?

Now Emily understood. Evelyn's tastes aligned perfectly with Wall Street brokers.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with sudden enthusiasm. She grabbed Emily's wrist. "Want to learn investing? I can teach you about equities, liquid versus illiquid assets—"

Emily gulped. Evelyn's sincerity was terrifying. She absolutely would drag Emily into wealth-building schemes.

"I'll pass," Emily laughed weakly. "Some of us are happy being comfortably middle-class."
###Chapter 855

At Kingsley Tech, Emily Whitaker earned millions annually in salary.

Bonuses and allowances piled up, making money the least of her concerns.

Emily lowered her gaze, then suddenly threw her arms wide. "I want fame!"

Evelyn Sinclair blinked, suppressing a laugh. "That... might be challenging."

Far less practical than accumulating wealth.

After her brief fantasy, Emily dragged Evelyn to her lab, showcasing her latest inventions.

Scientists truly had different brains.

Most women relaxed by shopping or dining.

Emily's idea of relaxation? Research.

Worried about her friend's health, Evelyn insisted they hit the gym.

They informed Preston Sinclair and slipped out.

Emily was a pro at skipping work—clearly a habit.

Scrolling her phone, she announced, "There's a new gym nearby. Let's try it."

Evelyn agreed. Closer proximity meant Emily might actually go regularly.

The gym's sleek interior impressed them immediately.

A staff member approached.

Evelyn's gaze caught the absurd sign: "Annual Membership: $850,000. No Negotiations. Beautiful Women: FREE!"

Her lips twitched. Sketchy much?

Emily, intrigued, pulled out her card. "I'll take the annual pass."

The drowsy receptionist startled. Business at this hour?

The stunning woman before him looked familiar.

Before he could place her, a voice exclaimed, "Evelyn Sinclair?"

She turned. Zachary Whitmore—Nathan Blackwood's friend.

She vaguely remembered him. When photos of Evelyn and Xavier Delmont trended, Zachary had publicly clarified it wasn't Nathan.

After that, he'd vanished from elite circles.

Small world.

Zachary rushed over, elated. "Evelyn! It's really you!" His enthusiasm puzzled her.

"Mr. Whitmore?"

He rubbed his hands nervously. Regret gnawed at him.

His attempt to help Nathan had backfired spectacularly.

Nathan had severed all Blackwood Industries' ties with the Whitmores.

Months later, their business crumbled. Even the contract termination payout couldn't revive their fortunes.

Zachary became a social pariah.

This gym was his desperate bid to re-enter that world—catering exclusively to the wealthy.

He beamed. "Ms. Sinclair, no membership needed. Our facilities are yours anytime."

Evelyn offered a polite, distant smile.

"Not necessary. I'm accompanying my friend."

Emily, indifferent to the owner, studied the price list.

Zachary's eyes gleamed. He instructed the receptionist, "40% discount for Ms. Sinclair's guest."

The receptionist nodded.

Evelyn thanked him but didn't argue over the trivial sum. Zachary wasn't poor—just desperate to please.

"What activities interest you? Running? Yoga? Our instructors are top-tier professionals."

Emily pointed. "Meditation. No movement required."

Silence fell.
###Chapter 856

Evelyn was speechless. Spending tens of thousands just to meditate in a gym?

Zachary finally snapped out of his daze and launched into an enthusiastic explanation.

"This guru is an enlightened monk from the Himalayas. His meditation skills are unmatched in this world."

"There’s no truth he can’t uncover! You’ll be his first student!"

Emily was thrilled. She’d finally found a workout that didn’t involve sweating!

Moments later, Zachary had someone escort Emily to the "meditation chamber."

"What would you like to try, Ms. Whitaker?"

Zachary assumed she’d pick something gentle—yoga, perhaps—something that wouldn’t strain her but still make her happy.

Evelyn hesitated. Since she was already here, and the instructors were world-class champions, she might as well give it a shot.

"Taekwondo."

Zachary paused, eyeing her. "Sure. You can change inside. I’ll spar with you later."

He gritted his teeth. The taekwondo instructor was an Olympic gold medalist.

If the coach accidentally injured Evelyn, Zachary wouldn’t be able to handle the fallout.

So, he had no choice but to spar with her himself. At worst, he’d let her win.

Evelyn gave him a skeptical look but said nothing, heading inside to change. The gym’s luxury service ensured everything was provided—no corners cut. After all, their clientele were high-profile elites who couldn’t be fooled with subpar gear.

Evelyn chose a sleek black training suit. With her toned figure and striking features, she drew immediate attention. Yet, her delicate appearance made her seem fragile—like a single punch could knock her out.

She warmed up with a quick jog. Zachary emerged in his gear, muscles flexing. Compared to her, he looked like he could wipe the floor with her.

The taekwondo coach raised a brow. "You’re going up against her?"

Zachary nodded, jaw tight. He couldn’t go too hard on her—if she got hurt, he’d have no excuse.

A porcelain doll like her needed to be handled with care.

The coach sighed. "At least warm up first."

Zachary shook his head. "No need. If I warm up, I might hit too hard. Just record the match for me." He handed his phone over.

The coach frowned but complied. Zachary needed proof—what if Evelyn tripped and blamed him?

As Evelyn finished warming up, the coach noted her precise, professional movements. Despite her slender frame, her technique was flawless. She clearly wasn’t a beginner.

Just as the coach opened his mouth to warn Zachary, Evelyn strapped on her gear and stepped onto the mat.

Zachary took a sip of water and strolled over casually. Evelyn glanced at him, then at the coach. "You sure about this?"

Zachary smirked. "Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing. I’m just as good as the coach."

Evelyn arched a brow. Well, he asked for it.

She didn’t hold back. Her first move was a lightning-fast roundhouse kick.

Zachary barely dodged, startled by the force behind it.

Evelyn’s strikes were sharp, efficient—no wasted motion.

Within minutes, Zachary was struggling to keep up.

Then—crack!

Evelyn twisted his arm, swept his legs, and pinned him down.

A clean, brutal victory.

She stood, dusting herself off. "Next time, send the coach."

Zachary groaned, clutching his dislocated arm.

Pathetic.

If she hadn’t gone easy on him, he’d have been down in seconds.

His pained whimpers echoed through the gym.

What a miserable sight.
###Chapter 857

The coach suppressed a laugh as he helped Zachary Whitmore down, guiding him to the side to rest. "The doctor will be here soon."

Then, he handed the phone back to Zachary.

That video was explosive. Evelyn Sinclair had given Zachary every opportunity to land a hit, yet he still lost!

The coach, far more skilled, had sparred with her professionally, leaving room for her to improve.

This was what a real opponent looked like. A true professional.

Zachary watched them spar, teeth clenched, eyes burning with frustration. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to be this good.

He pulled out his phone and recorded another clip—Evelyn, swift and fierce, her movements sharp and effortless. She looked breathtaking.

He uploaded it to his private social media, where only his old circle could see.

Within minutes, the video reached Nathan Blackwood.

Nathan studied it for a long moment before dialing Zachary without hesitation.

When Zachary saw the caller ID, his pain vanished, replaced by sheer exhilaration. He nearly kissed his phone.

He steadied his voice before answering. "Mr. Blackwood—"

He used to call Nathan by his nickname, like Tristan Whitmore did. But not anymore. Not unless Nathan allowed it.

"Did you film this?" Nathan’s voice was icy.

"Yes."

"Is she still there?"

Zachary glanced at Evelyn, who remained oblivious. "Yes."

"Send me the address. And delete that video."

Nathan hung up.

He didn’t want Evelyn exposed like this. That version of her—powerful, radiant—was for his eyes only.

Zachary quickly sent the location and exhaled. Maybe it wasn’t too late to fix things.

Less than thirty minutes later, Nathan arrived.

Evelyn descended from the ring, drenched in sweat, exhilarated. The spar had been intense, and she loved it.

The coach, impressed, had never met someone so naturally gifted—and so stunning. Even when he pushed her, she never complained.

Evelyn grabbed her water bottle, about to head for the showers, when she spotted Nathan.

Zachary, cradling his dislocated arm, was speaking to him.

Nathan’s cold gaze locked onto her, making her frown. He was like a shadow she couldn’t shake.

Ignoring Zachary, Nathan strode toward her, his expression softening slightly as he glanced at the coach beside her.

His voice was low. "What brought you here?"

He handed her a towel.

Evelyn considered ignoring him, but the tension was too thick.

"It was on the way from Kingsley Tech."

Nathan wasn’t surprised. This gym was close to Kingsley Tech. Knowing Evelyn, she wouldn’t wander into a random gym without reason.

Zachary had mentioned she came with a female friend who’d gone to meditate.

Evelyn shot Zachary a look. So that’s why Nathan was here.

Zachary avoided her gaze, lingering awkwardly in the corner.

Evelyn shrugged. "I’m going to shower. Make yourselves at home."

She left without another word.

She showered quickly, changed, and emerged with her damp hair loose.

Nathan was still there, seated nearby, speaking to Zachary with an air of detached authority.

Zachary looked like he was addressing royalty.

Just as Nathan stood to approach her, a voice called from the entrance.

"Ready to go?"

It was Preston Sinclair.
###Chapter 858

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, a chilling aura radiating from him.

He turned sharply, his piercing gaze locking onto Preston.

NovelDreams Publishing holds this content.

Nathan studied Preston like a predator sizing up its rival—alert, dangerous, brimming with lethal intent.

Preston met his stare. His smile remained warm, though his eyes flickered with something unreadable.

"What a coincidence. You're here too, Mr. Blackwood?"

They hadn't crossed paths since Nathan had discreetly sabotaged Preston's business dealings online.

Evelyn glanced between them, sensing the tension. Why had Preston shown up now?

Emily emerged from the corridor, waving casually. "Has Mr. Sinclair come to pick you up? He just called—"

Ah. So it was Emily.

Zachary Whitmore hadn't anticipated this confrontation in his gym. Did I just make things worse?

Nathan's eyes darkened, the air around him turning frigid.

Preston Sinclair was the man he despised most. Evelyn pressed her lips together and stepped forward.

"You're still here, Mr. Sinclair?"

"I was hoping to take you to dinner."

Preston smiled, effortlessly taking the bag from her hand—a casual, intimate gesture, as if he had every right to carry it for her.

The sight stabbed straight through Nathan's chest. His breath hitched. Had they gotten this close?

Evelyn hadn't agreed, but refusing now would be a public humiliation. She forced a smile and moved to leave—only for Nathan to seize her wrist. His grip was iron-tight.

She looked up into his stormy eyes, his jaw clenched, his expression unreadable.

"What is he to you?"

The question was raw, demanding. He already knew the answer would destroy him.

His blood burned with fury as he glared at Preston. The air thickened with hostility.

Preston's calm demeanor never wavered. His quiet confidence made him Nathan's equal in this silent war.

"I doubt you'd like the answer, Mr. Blackwood."

The words were a blade sliding between ribs.

Preston wasn't lying—but he wasn't telling the truth either. He was twisting the knife, watching Nathan unravel.

Delicious.

Evelyn's eyes widened. She opened her mouth to clarify—then stopped.

The silence stretched, suffocating.

She expected Nathan to snap. Instead, he released her.

His face was ice. His voice, rough and low.

"Dry your hair before you go. It's cold outside."

Evelyn froze.

Then, with one last scorching look at Preston, he turned and left. Zachary scrambled after him, not daring to linger.

Evelyn stared at his retreating figure. Something sharp twisted in her chest.

A dull, persistent ache.

What was that supposed to mean?

Preston's expression darkened briefly before smoothing over.

Emily, quick to react, grabbed a towel and began drying Evelyn's hair.

"It is chilly out."

Evelyn's face paled before she regained her composure.
###Chapter 859

Evelyn's hand hovered midair, about to take the towel herself. Preston Sinclair moved closer with his usual composed grace. "Allow me." His voice carried its typical warmth.

Yet Evelyn felt no comfort from his presence.

She instinctively stepped back. Emily Whitaker tightened her grip on the towel. "I'll handle this. I've got more experience drying hair." Preston's lips pressed into a thin line.

Ten minutes later.

With Evelyn's hair now dry, Zachary Whitmore entered. "Ms. Sterling, you're always welcome here—"

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "My friend holds an annual membership. Please ensure she receives excellent service."

"Absolutely, without question."

Beads of sweat dotted Zachary's forehead like pearls, yet he maintained his professional smile through obvious discomfort. Such dedication.

"You should see a doctor," Evelyn advised. "A dislocated shoulder typically heals within two days of proper rest."

Zachary's smile faltered momentarily, guilt flashing across his features.

He'd intended to go easy on her during their sparring session. Yet this delicate-looking woman had dislocated his shoulder with effortless precision.

The humiliation burned.

As the trio exited the facility, Preston noticed Evelyn's distant expression. His eyes darkened as he opened the car door. Evelyn paused. "I need to drop Emily at the office first. You should return to work, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston froze. He wasn't oblivious—her sudden withdrawal was palpable.

Emily happily slid into Evelyn's passenger seat, perfectly in sync with her rhythm.

Preston's expression shifted. "Are you angry?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. Angry? Why would she be upset about Preston deliberately provoking Nathan? Logically, she and Preston shared aligned interests.

Yet discomfort coiled in her chest.

She smiled. "Why would I be?"

"Because I intentionally let Mr. Blackwood misunderstand our relationship." Preston's blunt admission hung between them.

Didn't this imply Evelyn still harbored feelings for Nathan?

Wasn't her irritation proof that Preston's manipulation had struck a nerve?

If she didn't care, why react at all?

Evelyn's smile turned frosty.

"Mr. Sinclair, Nathan and I are history. There's no need for third-party validation. What bothers me is you using me as leverage against him."

She wasn't naive. She recognized the game.

If this were merely about their respective relationships, Preston wouldn't have disregarded her feelings. This was revenge.

Even the most perfect individuals harbored flaws—selfishness, emotions. Preston still resented Nathan for manipulating public opinion against him years prior. He'd simply been waiting for an opportunity.

And Nathan's only vulnerability? Evelyn.

Preston had assumed she wouldn't notice. That she'd play along.

But her perception cut sharper than he'd anticipated, slicing through his carefully constructed facade to expose the pettiness beneath.

Preston's expression contorted with uncharacteristic conflict.

Then Evelyn's face softened into genuine warmth, dissolving the tension. "It's fine. After all our history, it's natural we'd use each other occasionally. I haven't forgotten all your support."

Preston's head snapped up. Her smile shone brilliantly, revealing no trace of anger.

Her tone remained gentle, eyes sincere. "Don't dwell on it. Nathan doesn't define my boundaries. Goodbye, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston visibly stiffened. His dark gaze burned into her retreating figure.

Nathan wasn't her limit—but Preston had attempted to cross it.

She was too damn perceptive.

Instant regret flooded him. The fragile trust he'd painstakingly built, eroded in one careless moment.

His knuckles whitened around the car door, jaw tightening as shadows gathered in his expression.
###Chapter 860

Evelyn slid into the driver's seat.

Emily ended her call abruptly. "Mr. Kingsley just returned and requested dinner. Should I decline?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "No. I have questions for him."

Emily nodded and spoke into the phone. "She accepts. Says she has matters to discuss."

The bluntness startled Evelyn. Dominic was CEO, right? Could Emily really speak to him like that?

Wouldn't he retaliate?

She bit her lip. "Are you... comfortable here? Want to join Sterling Enterprises?"

Emily shook her head. "I'm loyal to Kingsley Tech. Dominic was part of our research team originally, but his skills were limited. We promoted him to management instead. Surprisingly capable there."

Ah. So Emily co-founded the company. That explained her casual attitude toward money.

At Kingsley Tech headquarters...

Evelyn had Emily summon Dominic downstairs while she started the car. No time to waste.

Within minutes, Dominic jogged out, looking exhausted.

Evelyn frowned. "Mr. Kingsley, are you sure you want dinner in this state?"

He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, the elegant frames contrasting with his tired eyes. "Even the weary must eat."

Before she could respond, the passenger door opened.

Nathan Blackwood slid in, his icy presence dropping the temperature instantly. Evelyn's breath caught. Hadn't he left earlier? She'd assumed he'd gone to Blackwood Industries to vent his anger.

Dominic cleared his throat. "We bumped into each other downstairs. You don't mind, right?"

He clearly knew about their situation.

Dominic smiled wearily. He'd just returned from a business trip when Nathan demanded this meeting. He was barely keeping his eyes open.

Nathan's dark gaze burned into Evelyn. "You don't mind, do you? It's business. Your boyfriend shouldn't object."

Damn. He'd taken her earlier comment seriously. Evelyn turned away without answering and started the car.

Nathan's expression darkened further.

In the backseat, Dominic and Emily exchanged glances. The tension was palpable. Emily understood their history but couldn't intervene.

Three CEOs sharing one car for dinner.

Evelyn had Bennett reserve a private dining room in advance before sending him home.

At the restaurant, they went straight to their reserved space.

Dominic excused himself to freshen up, returning looking more alert. His fair skin and gold-rimmed glasses gave him an aristocratic air - the epitome of refined elegance.

Evelyn couldn't help glancing at him.

Nathan noticed, his gaze turning glacial when it landed on Dominic.

Baffled by Nathan's sudden hostility, Dominic chose to ignore it. "Ms. Sterling, our overseas AI doctor system received excellent reviews. But domestic medical practices differ. We need localized adaptations. Interested in another round of funding?"

Evelyn had expected this. "Send the proposal. Approval will be swift."

Dominic smiled, fatigue forgotten. "Then let's toast."
###Chapter 861

Evelyn took a small sip, barely touching her drink, while Dominic downed his with enthusiasm.

Nathan sat silently to the side, his gaze flickering toward Evelyn every so often.

His eyes burned into her, impossible to ignore.

She finally turned her head, unable to take it any longer. What was his problem?

"Why are you staring at me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan lounged in his seat, his posture effortlessly elegant. His collar was slightly undone, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone. His shirt was neatly tucked into his slacks, his long legs stretched out so far they nearly invaded her space.

Their eyes locked.

Nathan's expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his gaze.

"You were looking at me first," he countered, his voice low and edged with frost.

If you hadn’t been watching me, how would you even know I was watching you?

It was an endless, pointless loop.

Nathan Blackwood was infuriating.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, reminding herself not to engage. Otherwise, she’d lose her sanity before the night was over.

She turned away, forcing a smile for Dominic. "How’s the autonomous driving project coming along?"

Dominic’s face lit up instantly. "We may not have been the first to research this, but our current advancements put us at the global forefront. Some of our core tech is beyond what foreign competitors have achieved!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Testing phase?"

Dominic nodded eagerly, practically vibrating with excitement. "We integrated cutting-edge AI sensory systems into the chip, syncing it with braking and acceleration."

"I toured multiple automotive research centers abroad—major brands, even race car teams. Their sensors only adjust speed based on obstacles ahead, which can get messy in complex scenarios."

"But if we apply racing-grade braking to standard vehicles, a car going 180mph can still stop in three seconds—without sacrificing stability."

Evelyn and Emily exchanged impressed glances.

Somehow, Dominic made even the most technical details sound thrilling.

He had the energy of a cult leader.

Amused, Evelyn poured him another glass herself. "Impressive work, Mr. Kingsley."

Dominic waved a hand, equal parts proud and modest. "Just doing my job."

(Translation: Paid well enough to make it worth it.)

Nathan swirled his drink, his tone bored. "Applying race car braking to consumer vehicles was proposed thirty years ago."

"So what exactly makes your AI system superior?"

The room went dead silent.

Like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over them.

Dominic shot Nathan a really? look.

He knew Nathan was the hardest person to impress—especially since cars were his passion. Nathan loved them but refused to race, valuing his life too much.

Dominic cleared his throat. "Safety."

He pressed his lips together. "That’s our biggest advantage. We’ve run hundreds of crash tests, installing airbags in every conceivable contact point—both automatic and manual triggers."

"Most importantly, people don’t trust AI to make emotional judgments. So, if the driver touches any controls, full manual override activates instantly, bypassing the AI entirely."

That was their ultimate safeguard.

No matter how advanced the AI, the final decision always rested with the human.

That was the only practical solution.

Emily nodded, jumping in. "Exactly. We also incorporated aviation principles into the chip. In extreme scenarios—like a head-on collision or a cliff fall—the driver’s seat ejects upward for five seconds upon impact. Three meters is our current tested height."
###Chapter 862

Evelyn and Nathan both froze in shock.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, but his eyes betrayed his astonishment as Emily finished speaking.

Unbelievable.

They hadn't expected this.

This was likely the first case of its kind in the world.

They had truly shattered the boundaries of human technology. A groundbreaking innovation.

Dominic smirked.

"I hadn't planned to announce this so soon," he admitted, "but since Emily brought it up, I won't keep it a secret any longer. Though our experiment was successful, flying cars are still bound by ethics and regulations. They'll be scrapped if they aren't fully refined."

Evelyn nodded. "Your achievements are already world-renowned. Everything else is secondary."

Breaking barriers was the essence of their research.

Dominic raised his glass. "Then let's toast—"

Evelyn lifted hers, and to her surprise, Nathan humored Dominic and raised his as well, his fingers long and elegant.

The clink of crystal echoed in the room, resonating with something deeper—inspiration.

Then Dominic downed his drink without hesitation.

Emily, grinning, snapped a photo and sent it to Donovan, who had gone radio silent.

Evelyn had unknowingly emptied several glasses. A dull ache throbbed in her lower abdomen, and her head spun. She stumbled to her feet, needing the restroom.

There was one in the private room, but Evelyn disliked it—too cramped. She opted for the one down the hall instead.

She staggered in, dizzy, and emerged sober.

Damn it.

Her period had arrived—days early.

No wonder the pain had been gnawing at her. She'd blamed the alcohol.

Now what?

Her white dress already bore a faint stain. She couldn't leave the stall. Her phone was back in the room, leaving her stranded. If she walked out like this, people would either think she'd lost her mind or laugh at her.

She never imagined she'd face such humiliation.

How unlucky.

She studied herself in the mirror. Fresh from her post-workout shower, she wore no makeup, but her skin still glowed—flawless.

Perfect, except for this wretched timing.

Indecision gripped her.

To leave or not to leave? The eternal dilemma.

Strangely, the entire floor was deserted—no staff in sight. No one to ask for help.

She stood there, numb, waiting for someone to notice her absence and come looking.

Minutes dragged. No one came.

Then—a sigh.

Had she imagined it?

Was someone out there?

Her pulse jumped. She cleared her throat.

The door swung open.

Her brief hope shattered as Nathan stepped inside.

His presence filled the space, cold and commanding. His eyes burned—dark, intense, whether from alcohol or pent-up frustration, she couldn’t tell.

Evelyn’s scalp prickled.

He was drunk. No trace of rationality in his gaze.

Tall and unyielding, he closed the distance, caging her against the counter. His breath, laced with whiskey, fanned over her face as he stared down with raw hunger and restraint.

She didn’t dare struggle. Any sudden movement would worsen the mess.

Her compliance seemed to soothe his anger.

He pressed his forehead to hers, voice rough.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "you're mine. Why don't you want me anymore? Want me again. Please."

His words were a spell, impossible to resist.

Before she could protest, his mouth crashed onto hers.

He didn’t give her a choice.

How could he do this?
###Chapter 863

Evelyn's hands pressed against Nathan's shoulders, but her feeble resistance barely registered against his strength.

She wanted to scream at him, but he seized the moment, closing the distance between them. The intoxicating scent of red wine on his lips was enough to make anyone dizzy.

Furious, she shoved, slapped, and punched him.

None of it mattered.

If anything, her struggles only fueled him. His kiss grew more possessive, more demanding. Nathan wanted her—needed her—to be his alone.

He had planned to be patient. To wait for her to come back to him willingly.

But then he saw her with Preston Sinclair.

That was the breaking point.

How dare she smile at another man?

The raw possessiveness inside him roared to life. He couldn’t wait any longer.

For the first time, he considered his grandfather’s ruthless methods.

If it meant keeping her, was there really any line he wouldn’t cross?

So he sent Dominic to invite her to dinner. This was his last chance to do this the right way.

If she refused, he’d have no choice but to take more drastic measures.

But she came.

Thank God, she came.

At least he could keep his hands relatively clean.

Evelyn was gasping for air. She bit down hard on his tongue, tasting blood before finally releasing him.

Did he finally get the message?

Nathan barely flinched. Instead, he dove back in, stealing her breath all over again.

Still unsatisfied, he lifted her effortlessly, setting her on the cold marble sink so their eyes were level.

His ragged breaths surrounded her. When he leaned in again, Evelyn grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked.

Pain flickered in his dark gaze. He pulled back slightly, letting her control the distance.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "Nathan Blackwood, snap out of it!"

His brows furrowed. His voice was rough, strained.

"I’m perfectly aware of what I’m doing."

Like hell he was.

A sharp cramp twisted through her abdomen. She could feel the warmth between her thighs.

Her face paled. Her breathing turned shallow.

The first day of her cycle was always brutal—painful enough to require medication.

Nathan traced her swollen lips, his gaze darkening.

His voice was hoarse.

"You liked it too, Evelyn. I can give you everything. Let’s start over."

She wasn’t listening. Between the wine and the pain, her vision blurred. She bit her lip, shivering. "Nathan—"

Cold sweat beaded on her skin.

Finally, he noticed her pallor.

Worry flashed in his eyes as he cupped her face. "What’s wrong?"

She couldn’t say it. Couldn’t bring herself to voice it. Instead, her gaze flickered to his suit jacket.

If she wore that, at least no one would see.

Understanding dawned. He lifted her off the sink, his hand brushing against her backside—confirming his suspicion.

He froze.

Evelyn wanted to scream.

What kind of man didn’t immediately run out to get her what she needed?

No, this bastard had to be different.

"Nathan Blackwood, you absolute—" She sucked in a sharp breath. "You disgusting—"

She barely had the strength left to curse him.

But she’d be damned if she didn’t.

Later, when she recovered, she’d teach him how a real man was supposed to act.
###Chapter 864

Nathan froze for a split second before snapping into action. He scooped Evelyn up in his arms without hesitation.

Evelyn's anger flared hotter.

Being carried bridal style was bad enough, but this position made her feel completely exposed!

She curled into his chest, fuming. "Just give me your jacket. I can walk on my own!"

Nathan tightened his grip. "No. I'm cold too."

He wasn't letting go.

This was his chance—to hold her, to keep her close.

Evelyn wanted to scream.

At this point, passing out from pain or sheer frustration would be a mercy.

She clenched her jaw, lips pressed into a thin line. Her face had gone ghostly pale.

Once she got through this, Nathan Blackwood was a dead man.

No one noticed the faint smirk tugging at Nathan's lips.

They didn't return to the party.

Nathan carried her straight to his car, refusing to set her down even for a second.

Evelyn's stomach twisted violently. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead as her vision blurred.

Normally, she took her medication in advance. This time, she hadn't been prepared.

Her consciousness flickered in and out.

Through half-lidded eyes, she studied Nathan's sharp profile. His expression was tense, almost... concerned.

Hah. What an actor.

Sterling Manor was at least twenty minutes away. Yet, within ten, the car screeched to a halt.

She was lifted again, carried into an elevator.

Even in her dazed state, she knew this wasn't Highland Estates. The place looked familiar, but she couldn't place it. Probably one of Nathan's many properties.

When he set her on the sofa, she was barely breathing. He pressed a hand to her forehead.

Evelyn forced her eyes open. "Not a fever. Give me my phone. I'll call someone to pick me up."

Nathan's jaw tightened. He didn't move.

After a tense silence, he turned and walked out.

Evelyn bit her lip, fighting to stay conscious. The penthouse was spacious, all sleek grays and cold metals—classic Nathan. Spotless, too. Clearly maintained by a cleaning service.

She dragged in a shaky breath and forced herself upright. Hand pressed to her stomach, she staggered toward the door.

She wasn't dying here. That bastard Nathan could've just taken her to a hospital.

After mentally cursing him for the hundredth time, she finally reached the exit.

She pushed the door open—

And froze.

The hallway looked... familiar.

Especially the two potted chrysanthemums across the way. They looked exactly like the ones Oliver had given her—the ones she'd refused to keep inside.

Heart pounding, she stumbled toward the door opposite.

With trembling fingers, she punched in the code.

The lock clicked open.

Her stomach dropped.

This was her apartment.

Nathan Blackwood had been living right across from her this whole time?

No time to process that. She rushed inside, grabbed her painkillers, and dry-swallowed two.

Collapsing onto the couch, she waited for the agony to fade.

Once the pain dulled, she dragged herself to the bathroom to clean up, then collapsed into bed.

She couldn't stay awake another second.

As always, she could only rely on herself when it mattered.

She drifted off, only to jerk awake hours later to a cold draft.

But the chill vanished as quickly as it came.

Morning light streamed through the curtains, warm and golden.

Evelyn blinked awake—

And found herself staring straight into Nathan's icy, breathtaking face.
###Chapter 865

Nathan had been awake for hours, unable to find peace in sleep. The only comfort came from the warmth of Evelyn nestled in his arms.

When she finally stirred, his dark eyes softened with amusement, lips curving into a lazy smile.

"Morning, darling."

Evelyn blinked, disoriented. Was this some kind of twisted dream?

"Darling, my *ss."

No way would her subconscious conjure up something this absurd.

She jerked upright, putting as much distance between them as possible.

Had they really spent the entire night in the same bed? Nathan's arm fell away as she scrambled back.

Evelyn's mind raced. Sure, she'd had too much to drink last night, but not enough to black out.

She remembered coming home in agony, swallowing painkillers, washing up, and collapsing into bed alone.

Nathan hadn't been there. So why was he here now?

"What the hell are you doing here?" Her voice was ice, expression sharp with suspicion.

Nathan exhaled, voice rough from sleep.

"I brought you medicine, but you vanished. I searched everywhere. Lucky for you, you didn’t go far—" He reached for her, but she recoiled.

"This is my house. How did you even get in?"

Her guard was up, though she noted with relief that her clothes were untouched. To her, he was nothing more than a mistake she’d already moved past. This cozy domestic scene had no place between them.

Peaceful coexistence was the best they could hope for.

Nathan didn’t push, withdrawing his hand. The faint scent of mint clung to him—he must’ve showered before slipping into bed. He rubbed his temples, explaining with forced patience.

"You left the door open."

Evelyn froze.

Damn it.

She’d been too distracted to notice.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Any thought of using this against him evaporated.

"A normal man would’ve closed the door and left. Do you understand, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. His gaze darkened, voice dropping to a husky murmur.

"A normal man wouldn’t have walked away. I was worried something might’ve happened to you."

It sounded reasonable—if you ignored how flimsy the excuse was.

She scoffed, unimpressed by his deflection, and stalked downstairs. The living room was a disaster—scattered bags, spilled contents, all of it medicine.

No prizes for guessing who was responsible.

Evelyn hesitated, something unfamiliar flickering in her chest.

At least he hadn’t crossed any lines.

"Since you brought me home, I’ll let last night’s behavior slide. But watch yourself, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan straightened, one hand in his pocket, the picture of effortless arrogance.

"Trying to get rid of me so fast? We did spend the night together. Maybe we should give this another shot—"

Evelyn whirled, eyes flashing.

"Planning to leak this to the press? Did you already tip them off to stake out my place?"

Nathan stayed silent, watching her.

The idea had crossed his mind—briefly. But even he had limits.

Evelyn’s smile was razor-sharp.

"Go ahead. To the world, we were married for three years. One night changes nothing. We’re adults—we can handle a little scandal."
###Chapter 866

Every mention of their three-year marriage sent a crushing weight onto Nathan Blackwood's chest, stealing his breath away.

No matter what he did, it never seemed enough.

Nathan knew those years had been filled with Evelyn Sinclair's unwavering devotion. He had been her entire world—her sun, her air.

Yet he'd failed to give her the love she deserved. So she vanished.

Sometimes, he wondered—if he had been gentler, if he hadn't forced her to donate blood for Vanessa Holloway, if he hadn't ignored her suffering—would their story have ended differently?

A shadow of pain crossed his sharp, cold features, twisting his smile into something bitter.

"Evelyn, you always know exactly where to strike."

He stepped closer, his dark eyes burning with intensity. His voice was rough, strained.

"I would never do anything you truly hate."

She avoided his gaze, recoiling from the icy aura surrounding him.

What did he want from her now?

"There's nothing you do that I like." She hugged herself tighter.

Nathan's expression hardened, his jaw clenching.

A cough escaped her, and her eyes flicked toward the drawer.

She walked over, pulled out a thick stack of cash, hesitated, then plucked two bills free. "Payment. Since you spent the night here." She shoved the money into his shirt pocket and tossed the rest onto the table before turning away.

Nathan's face darkened instantly.

No one dared treat him like this. It was a blatant insult.

His chest heaved. His fists clenched. The angrier he grew, the more helpless he felt.

He watched her stride to the living room for water, forcing himself to swallow the fury.

"You're too generous." His smile was gritted between teeth. "No need for so much."

Evelyn blinked, then smirked. "Consider the extra a tip."

Nathan exhaled sharply. Maybe he should stop humiliating himself.

Breathe. Control it.

The phone rang. Evelyn picked it up.

"Hello?"

"It's me."

She paused. "Preston?"

Surprise flickered through her. How had Preston Sinclair gotten this number?

Behind her, Nathan's entire demeanor turned glacial at the name. He suppressed the storm inside, standing motionless as the seconds dragged.

"I called your cell, but no answer. Lucas gave me this number. Didn’t expect you to pick up." Preston's voice was warm, relieved.

"Left my phone at the club last night."

Preston wanted to apologize for yesterday—face to face.

But Evelyn wasn’t in the mood. She declined politely.

When she hung up, she remembered Nathan’s presence.

She turned—and met his frigid, unreadable gaze.

Before she could speak, his lips curved into a chilling smile.

"Are you two really together?"

Evelyn didn’t owe him an explanation. "Not your business."

Nathan's smile turned lethal.
###Chapter 867

Nathan Blackwood's expression quickly returned to normal. Too normal. Unnaturally so.

"Can't I ask as a friend?" His voice was smooth, calculated. "Or are you worried your boyfriend would mind? Nothing happened between us anyway. Should I explain it to him personally?"

Evelyn Sinclair frowned. This wasn't the Nathan she knew.

The man she remembered would've stormed out in a rage or sneered some cutting remark.

Something was off.

She massaged her temples. Since when did the world turn upside down?

"No need." Her reply was ice.

Nathan's jaw tightened, but his words didn't match his usual arrogance. "I respect your choices. If he makes you happy, I'll wish you well. You deserve the best. If I were your man, I'd never let you hurt. Whatever you decide, I've got your back."

The speech came out in one breath, leaving Evelyn stunned.

Why did this sound so familiar?

She opened her mouth to tell him to stop acting bizarre—

"Given our unique history, we'll still be working closely together." Nathan's tone was casual, but he emphasized the word again. "Your boyfriend won't have a problem with that, right?"

"Boyfriend." The word grated on her nerves.

She didn't correct him.

Doing so would imply she cared about his misconception regarding Preston Sinclair.

Then it hit her.

Adrian Blackwood.

Nathan's nephew had behaved similarly at the gala. A laugh escaped before she could stop it. "You and Adrian really are cut from the same cloth."

Nathan's face darkened. Had she figured him out that easily?

Impossible. His performance was flawless.

Even if she had, he'd play it cool.

"Don't compare me to that spoiled brat." His scoff dripped with disdain. He checked his watch. "I'm heading to the office. Need a ride?"

"No."

Nathan left, his posture rigid. The room finally fell silent.

Evelyn called for her driver, arranged for her bag to be retrieved from the club, and returned Bennett's multiple calls. There was one missed message from Lucas. She handled her schedule, canceled the morning meeting, and texted Lucas back.

After freshening up, she grabbed the painkillers from the floor before leaving.

——

Nathan changed and went straight to Blackwood Industries.

The battle wasn't over. No time to rest.

Publicly, he'd already won. Once Reginald Blackwood stepped down, who could challenge him?

Privately, enemies lurked everywhere.

And Nathan tolerated no threats.

Alone in his office, the memory of Evelyn's call with Preston stabbed through him like a blade.

Watching her care for another man—it was a new kind of agony.

Harrison knocked, barely containing his excitement.

"President Blackwood, the negotiations are complete. Majority shareholders have signed the transfer agreements."

Nathan's fingers stilled. "And my grandfather?"

The others were small fry. Their combined shares were nothing compared to Reginald's.

The old man was the real prize.
###Chapter 868

Nathan's gaze flickered toward Harrison, his expression unreadable.

"Grandfather Reginald hasn't signed the papers yet, but he's given his verbal agreement."

The news settled heavily between them.

For Nathan, this wasn't a victory.

He could finally secure absolute control over Blackwood Industries—no more boardroom coups, no more threats to his authority.

Yet, in doing so, he had severed the last fragile thread tying him to the Blackwood name.

Reginald Blackwood had once loved him.

Now, the old man refused to even acknowledge him as kin.

Betrayal always stung worse when it came from those you trusted most.

Especially from the man whose empire Nathan had spent years protecting.

Harrison knew Nathan better than most. Outwardly, Nathan and Reginald were always at odds, their clashes legendary.

But deep down, Nathan had never truly wanted to destroy his grandfather.

All he'd ever wanted was to stop Reginald from targeting Evelyn.

The shares, the power, the legacy—none of it mattered to Nathan.

Yet Reginald would rather sell Blackwood Industries to a stranger than let Nathan inherit what was rightfully his.

The sheer pettiness of it was almost laughable.

Nathan was the heir Reginald had raised, molded, and now feared too much to challenge directly.

"Sir..."

Harrison hesitated.

Nathan's icy stare cut through him. "Speak."

"Maybe... consider stepping back?"

The air thickened instantly.

Harrison pressed on before he lost his nerve.

"Sir, at the end of the day, Reginald Blackwood is still family. He cares—he's just too proud to admit it. If this feud escalates, the rest of the Blackwoods might not say it to your face, but they'll judge you behind closed doors."

How could Nathan turn his back on the man who raised him?

What would that make him in their eyes?

If Nathan ever stumbled, they'd be the first to twist the knife.

Nathan's ruthlessness had always been his strength.

But using it against his own blood? That was a line even his allies might not forgive.

Harrison had weighed every word before daring to voice them.

A long silence stretched between them.

Finally, Nathan's voice came low and final. "This isn't your concern."

He wasn't here to play the devoted grandson.

If they stayed out of his way, he'd leave them in peace.

If they didn't? He wouldn't hold back.

Sentiment had no place in this game.

Harrison exhaled. He should've known better.

"Wesley Thornton is already moving on behalf of Pacific Crest International. The contract signing is scheduled for tomorrow morning. Reginald will make his move by afternoon."

This was the tipping point.

Once the deal was done, there'd be no going back.

Nathan's expression darkened, his eyes unreadable.

"Give Thornton whatever he needs."

"Understood."

Harrison straightened. Time to ensure this played out flawlessly.

Officially, he answered to Blackwood Industries.

In reality, his loyalty belonged solely to Nathan.

The moment he stepped out, his phone buzzed.

"Reginald Blackwood," he muttered, answering. "Sir... Nathan's made his decision."
###Chapter 869

At Sterling Enterprises.

Evelyn Sinclair stared at the embossed invitation in disbelief.

Blackwood Industries had been unusually quiet lately. What prompted this sudden grand celebration?

The gilded cardstock felt heavy in her hands—more extravagant than their annual gala invitations.

Something wasn't right.

Her instincts screamed warnings, but she couldn't pinpoint the source.

The phone rang, interrupting her thoughts.

"Your brother's home early with his girlfriend!" William Sterling's voice boomed through the receiver. "Come for lunch immediately!"

Evelyn blinked. Alexander Sterling wasn't due back from his two-week vacation for five more days.

Relief flooded her. Managing the company alone had left her exhausted, dark circles forming under her eyes.

"I'll be right there," she agreed, already reaching for her car keys.

Freedom was finally within reach.

But if Alexander brought Amelia Sinclair home... that meant things were serious between them.

Poor Isabella Montgomery.

Yet every relationship had its own destiny. She should be happy for her brother.

The Sterling Manor gates swung open as Evelyn's car approached. The butler practically skipped to her door.

"Master Alexander brought his lady love home!" he chirped. "The Chairman hasn't stopped smiling all morning!"

Evelyn chuckled. "You look positively giddy yourself."

"I've watched you children grow up," he confided. "Always prayed some of Lucas's charm would rub off on your eldest brother..."

The entire household buzzed with excitement. Evelyn found the trio in the sunroom—Alexander and Amelia laughing with William Sterling.

Love had transformed her serious brother. His eyes sparkled in a way she'd never seen before.

"Look what your future sister-in-law picked for you," Alexander announced, waving her over.

Amelia flushed but stood gracefully. "Actually, your brother chose this to thank you for holding down the fort."

Evelyn accepted the gift. "Between the two of you, does it matter?" she teased.

Alexander pulled Amelia close. "Told you she'd love anything from you."

Lucas Sterling chose that moment to enter, dessert plates in hand. He groaned dramatically. "Must you torture us singles? There are three lonely souls in this room!"

William kicked his youngest son's shin. "At your age, I already had two children!"

Lucas clutched his chest in mock pain.

Alexander pointed at him. "Our resident critic. Feel free to ignore him."

"Now I'm doubly wounded," Lucas lamented, sinking onto the couch.

Amelia giggled. "I think we broke Lucas."

Evelyn bit back laughter as the butler announced lunch would be served shortly.

Though poised, Amelia's nervous glances at Alexander betrayed her anxiety. He squeezed her hand reassuringly—a silent conversation passing between them.

The sweetness made Evelyn's teeth ache.
###Chapter 870

William Sterling cleared his throat, setting aside pleasantries.

"Amelia, you've known Alexander for years. Our family trusts your character, so we have no objections to your relationship."

Evelyn Sinclair nodded while Lucas Sterling quietly enjoyed his dessert.

Amelia Sinclair straightened her posture, maintaining her poised smile as she met William's gaze.

"Thank you, Uncle William."

William pressed his lips together. "However, you've built an impressive career abroad these past years. What are your plans if you marry?"

This was the crucial question.

The past remained unmentioned. Whatever happened when Amelia left Alexander, whatever pain she caused - that could be overlooked.

But the future needed clarity.

After all, Alexander was his firstborn. His priority.

Parenting Alexander had been a delicate balance - too lenient and risk spoiling him, too strict and risk breaking his spirit.

Amelia glanced at Alexander with a soft smile.

This wasn't difficult for her. She understood the Sterling family's stature. While not overly traditional, they wouldn't accept just anyone.

"Uncle William, Alexander already accompanied me to Montecito to transfer my company headquarters last week. I'll be managing operations locally now. While I'm not giving up my career, we're ready to start our family."

William hesitated, then nodded approvingly.

"Good. Our family doesn't lack resources, but a woman pursuing her ambitions brings fulfillment. You have our support."

His words signaled full acceptance.

Amelia smiled. "Alexander often says Evelyn, though younger, possesses business acumen surpassing most industry leaders."

William chuckled proudly.

"Don't flatter her too much. She's still learning."

Evelyn shot Alexander a surprised look.

Alexander maintained his composed smile. Whether those were truly his words or Amelia's diplomatic skills at work didn't matter - her charm explained his devotion.

The lunch concluded harmoniously.

Afterwards, William invited Amelia to see his prized koi pond. She accepted enthusiastically.

Evelyn needed to discuss Blackwood Industries' gala with Alexander, so he instructed Lucas to accompany their father - lest William keep Amelia fishing all afternoon.

Evelyn sipped her tea. "Should I attend?"

Alexander considered. "Before Reginald Blackwood and Nathan's fallout, there was the board resignation matter."

"This could be related."

"But Nathan controls Blackwood Industries now. What can Reginald possibly do?"

Alexander's expression darkened.

"Don't underestimate him. He still holds shares."

Minor holdings, but enough to cause complications.

Evelyn frowned. Could Reginald actually remove Nathan?

Unlikely.

Nathan's influence extended far beyond Blackwood Industries now. His connections ran deep.

"Nathan probably isn't hosting this event himself, but expect many influential guests."
###Chapter 871

Evelyn Sinclair tilted her head slightly. "When I received invitations before, it was always Harrison who contacted me. This time, it was just some random coordinator."

That detail had been bothering her. As she spoke, her phone buzzed.

A message from Preston Sinclair.

"I need a plus-one for Blackwood Industries' gala tomorrow at noon. Care to join me?"

Evelyn's brows lifted. Blackwood Industries had invited Preston too?

That confirmed her suspicions.

With Preston's status, he could attend any high-society event he pleased.

But Nathan Blackwood had always despised him. Why would Nathan extend an invitation now?

Her fingers tapped out a reply. "Sure."

If there were questions, she'd find the answers there.

A sly smile curved her lips.

Alexander Sterling watched her expression and sighed. "So you're going. Want me to tag along?"

Evelyn paused. "No need. I've got my escort. Since you're playing hooky from work, go be disgustingly sweet with Amelia."

Alexander rolled his eyes.

"By the way," she added, "I'm selling the penthouse near the office." She refused to risk running into Nathan every time she stepped outside.

Alexander smirked. "Short on cash?"

"Hardly. I just don't want it anymore."

"If you don't like it, leave it empty. You own half the city anyway, and I've got plenty of spare properties. Take your pick."

To Alexander and William Sterling, wealthy people didn't sell real estate—they hoarded it. The concept of letting go was foreign.

Evelyn exhaled. Pointless. He was just a money-making machine wrapped up in his love life.

She changed the subject. "When's the wedding?"

"Who's your date?" Alexander countered.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Alexander fell silent too.

Touche.

Siblings. What was the point?

That evening, Alexander was still fishing with Amelia and William.

As dusk fell, the pond grew lively.

Evelyn and Lucas seized the moment to slip away.

Lucas headed to Natalie Beaumont's place, while Evelyn retreated to one of her many luxury apartments near the company.

Thank God for excessive real estate investments.

The next evening, Blackwood Industries' gala unfolded at The Regal Grand, dripping with opulence.

The event balanced exclusivity with spectacle—typical of Reginald Blackwood's taste for showing off while pretending to be modest.

Evelyn wore a fitted black gown tonight. A belt of pearls and diamonds accentuated her waist, radiating elegance and sharp intellect.

Her striking features glowed under the chandeliers, but her gaze remained cool, detached—a frosty contrast to the warmth around her.

The moment she stepped out of the car, eyes locked onto her—admiring, envious, resentful.

Tristan Whitmore hadn't exited the vehicle yet. He studied the radiant woman through the window, then glanced at Nathan beside him.

"Divorced less than a year, and Evelyn's transformed completely," he mused.

If someone had told him this was the same woman who once trailed after Nathan like a lovesick puppy, he'd have laughed in their face.

The difference was staggering.

Beside him, Nathan tensed, his gaze snapping toward Evelyn. His jaw tightened.

"She's here."

Tristan blinked. "You didn't know she was invited? It's your family's event. How do you miss these details when you're trying to win her back?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Do you ever shut up?"

Tristan threw his hands up. What did he say wrong?
###Chapter 872

"Go now, before it's too late," Tristan urged impatiently. "Be her escort inside!"

Dozens of male guests were already eyeing Evelyn Sinclair hungrily, yet Nathan Blackwood remained seated like a statue.

Nathan's expression darkened as his fingers hovered over the door handle.

Tristan suddenly grabbed his arm with an odd chuckle.

"Actually, I'll join you. Consider me your wingman tonight."

Nathan shook him off with visible disgust. His gaze sharpened when he spotted the couple outside.

Preston Sinclair stood beside Evelyn, their radiant smiles creating a picture-perfect moment. The striking pair looked like they'd stepped out of a high-fashion magazine spread.

The temperature in the luxury car plummeted instantly.

Nathan's jaw clenched, his obsidian eyes burning with barely contained fury.

So Reginald Blackwood had invited Preston too? The old man really wanted to twist the knife deeper.

Nathan had anticipated his grandfather summoning Evelyn.

The patriarch clearly wanted Nathan's former wife to witness his humiliation - to crush his masculine pride completely.

But that wasn't enough.

By inviting Evelyn, Reginald aimed to mock Nathan. By including Preston, he ensured someone would kick Nathan while he was down. The old fox knew exactly how to pour salt in his grandson's wounds.

Nathan's fists trembled violently, veins bulging at his temples. Tristan had no idea about the Ferguson family's arrangements. Was this entire spectacle designed to provoke Nathan to madness?

He wanted to curse them all, but any insult would inevitably include Nathan. Better to stay silent.

After what felt like an eternity, they watched Evelyn and Preston enter the hotel arm-in-arm. Tristan forced a smile. "Showtime. We can't be late."

Something felt dangerously off about this gathering.

But as Nathan's closest friend, Tristan would stand by him no matter what.

Harrison appeared suddenly, rapping on Nathan's window.

Nathan emerged, composing himself with visible effort. Tristan scrambled after him.

At the hotel entrance, the Blackwood family butler greeted guests. He stiffened upon seeing Nathan, bowing deeply. "Mr. Blackwood..."

Nathan strode past him without acknowledgment.

Dozens of guests approached with polite greetings, which Nathan acknowledged with curt nods. The ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers.

This wasn't the Blackwoods' usual standard - likely because Reginald wanted maximum exposure for his grandson's downfall.

Evelyn and Preston's entrance caused an immediate stir.

Though Preston had only recently arrived in Montecito, his investments spanned multiple industries, making him a sought-after connection.

Many guests recognized him instantly.

Their speculative whispers about Evelyn and Preston's relationship filled the air.

Evelyn charmed a group discussing the latest Broadway hits - social grace came naturally to her.

Preston conversed with businessmen nearby, though his gaze kept drifting toward Evelyn. His eyes held a warmth reserved only for her.

An older executive noticed Preston's distraction and chuckled knowingly.

"Rare gems like Ms. Sinclair don't stay single long, Mr. Sinclair. If you're interested, you'd better act fast - the competition's fierce."

Preston's lips curved into a confident smile, his voice carrying just enough to reach approaching ears.

"They can stand down. That ship has already sailed."

The words made Tristan and Nathan freeze mid-step.
###Chapter 873

Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening with barely concealed fury.

He took a step forward, but Tristan grabbed his arm. "Reginald Blackwood is coming this way."

Given Nathan's strained relationship with his grandfather, a confrontation was the last thing anyone wanted.

Reginald Blackwood approached with an air of smug confidence, his sharp eyes glinting with calculation beneath the wrinkles of age.

"Evelyn, my dear," he greeted, his voice dripping with false warmth.

Evelyn hadn't expected him to acknowledge her at all.

The last time they'd spoken, he'd tried to manipulate her into turning against Nathan under the guise of Pacific Crest Enterprises.

Now, he acted as if nothing had happened?

If she weren't here to witness the spectacle, she would've avoided him entirely.

The man was a viper in silk.

She forced a polite smile. "Chairman—ah, forgive me. Mr. Blackwood. Thank you for the invitation." She raised her glass in a perfunctory toast.

Reginald's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before he recovered. Beside her, Preston Sinclair smoothly intervened.

"Mr. Blackwood has retired from Blackwood Industries to enjoy his golden years, Evelyn. We should respect that."

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "My mistake. Old habits die hard."

To the untrained eye, it was a simple slip of the tongue.

But Reginald knew better. She was mocking his failed power grab.

He swallowed the insult with practiced grace.

His aged face twitched before he chuckled, eyes gleaming. "Youthful exuberance. I don’t hold it against you. Though seeing you two together, I finally understand why you’ve been rejecting Nathan—Mr. Sinclair is quite the accomplished man. A titan in Pacifica’s investment circles. How fortunate you’ve found each other!"

His words were laced with poison, designed to stir gossip.

Evelyn stiffened. The murmurs around them were already starting.

She didn’t know how to untangle this web without making it worse.

Her expression turned icy, but Preston placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

"Your praise is appreciated, Mr. Blackwood," he said smoothly, "but I’m still in the courting phase. While I hope Ms. Sinclair will accept me one day, I’d hate for any misunderstandings to trouble her."

Evelyn glanced at him, surprised.

Instead of exploiting the situation, he was diffusing it.

That was… unexpectedly considerate.

The speculative whispers died down.

Preston’s words clarified nothing—yet made everything clear.

Not far away, Nathan overheard and exhaled sharply, the tension in his shoulders easing.

So they weren’t together.

His fingers unclenched.

Evelyn had no interest in prolonging this charade. "Mr. Blackwood," she cut in coolly, "what exactly is the purpose of tonight’s event?"
###Chapter 874

Evelyn's words made everyone turn their attention to Reginald Blackwood.

As the patriarch of the Blackwood family, his influence remained undeniable. Even though he had stepped down from Blackwood Industries, his authority still commanded respect.

Tonight, he was the eldest and most distinguished figure present—naturally, the center of attention.

Nathan stood silently in the shadows, unusually subdued. No one seemed to notice his uncharacteristic quietness.

Reginald glanced around, satisfied with the turnout.

He straightened his posture, his sharp eyes gleaming with triumph as he strode forward.

All eyes followed him as he took his place.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, voice ringing with authority, "it is an honor to have you here tonight. I'm sure you're all wondering about the purpose of this gathering."

His gaze swept across the crowd before settling on Nathan, who stood near a wine cabinet, lazily swirling a glass of red wine.

Nathan's expression was unreadable—cool, detached, indifferent.

He didn't react.

Reginald's smile deepened, edged with something ruthless.

He raised his voice.

"I have decided to transfer twenty percent of my shares, along with the proxy holdings of Blackwood Industries' subsidiaries, to Pacific Crest International!"

Gasps erupted.

Evelyn and Preston exchanged stunned looks. Her eyes flicked to Nathan, but he remained motionless, his face betraying nothing.

With Reginald's shares and the proxies combined, Pacific Crest would control nearly thirty percent of Blackwood Industries.

This was both a blessing and a curse.

Reginald had just handed Nathan a formidable adversary. From now on, every major decision would require Pacific Crest's approval.

A masterstroke of cruelty.

Reginald savored the shock in the room before continuing.

"Pacific Crest International is a globally renowned corporation, one whose vision aligns perfectly with Blackwood Industries. Though I have stepped back, I want our company to evolve—stronger, more competitive. With Pacific Crest as our partner, we will stride boldly into the future!"

The rest of his speech was filled with lofty rhetoric.

When he finished, silence hung heavy in the air.

Then, someone started clapping—Harrison, likely.

The applause spread, though it felt hollow.

Preston leaned in, voice low. "Pacific Crest? Reginald would rather hand the company to outsiders than let his own grandson take control. Vicious."

Evelyn wasn't entirely surprised. This was exactly the kind of ruthless move Reginald would make.

Still, it left a bitter taste.

"Reginald has always been a tyrant," she murmured. "He'd never tolerate being reined in by Nathan. Pacific Crest has deep pockets and an even deeper reach. Once they sink their teeth into Blackwood Industries, they won't let go easily."

She knew firsthand how aggressive Pacific Crest could be. During her time abroad, she'd seen them swallow entire companies whole.

A pang of sympathy struck her.

What must it feel like to be betrayed by your own blood?
###Chapter 875

The entire room could sense this was Reginald Blackwood's calculated revenge against Nathan.

Nathan might have forced Reginald out of the company, but he couldn't strip the old man of his shares.

This move made everyone question—had Nathan Blackwood's iron grip on the business world finally slipped?

"Next, we welcome Pacific Crest International's Vice President, Mr. Julian Whitmore, to finalize a mutually beneficial agreement on behalf of his company!"

Reginald extended his hand, and from the side emerged a strikingly handsome but unfamiliar face.

Julian Whitmore.

Evelyn Sinclair narrowed her eyes. If she remembered correctly, she had once interned under Julian when she was abroad.

Back then, he was just a department manager. She hadn't expected his rise to vice president to happen so swiftly.

Then again, his talent was undeniable. His success was inevitable.

Without hesitation, Julian stepped onto the stage, unfazed by the countless eyes locked onto him. He shook Reginald's hand with practiced ease.

Silence blanketed the room.

All eyes darted between Julian and Nathan, waiting for the clash.

Something felt off to Evelyn.

Nathan wasn't the type to let things spiral this far out of control.

Reginald had flaunted the equity transfer agreement publicly, cornering Nathan so thoroughly that retaliation was impossible. He wanted the world to know—his shares now belonged to Pacific Crest International.

Nathan was confident, wasn't he?

This was Reginald's lesson to the arrogant, ungrateful Nathan Blackwood. He had built Nathan's empire, and now that Nathan had grown wings, he dared to defy him? This was the price of betrayal. A smug smirk curled Reginald's lips.

"Nathan, you're still young. You could learn a great deal from Mr. Whitmore and Pacific Crest International. Since you'll be working closely from now on, why don't you step up and say a few words?"

He wanted the entire room to witness Nathan's downfall.

His words painted Nathan as inferior to Julian.

Nathan lifted his gaze, his expression icy, his eyes dark and unreadable. The aura around him remained untouchable—cold, regal, commanding.

Under the weight of everyone's stares, he finally set down his glass and strode forward, his presence dominating the space.

Unexpectedly, Julian smiled when Nathan approached and subtly shifted aside, relinquishing the center position. He extended his hand respectfully.

"Long time no see, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's grip was firm, his voice low enough for only the three of them to hear. "Mr. Whitmore, I sent Harrison to receive you. How did you end up with the old man?"

Reginald's smirk widened.

Julian merely shrugged. "I was coming either way. What difference does it make who escorted me?"

Nathan withdrew his hand, his towering figure radiating authority.

On that stage, he was undeniably the most magnetic presence.

Even in what appeared to be a losing battle, his stature and power eclipsed everyone else.

"True. It changes nothing."

Nathan's lips curved into a chilling, wicked smile as he locked eyes with Reginald.

The old man's heart lurched at that look. His confidence wavered.

Nathan turned to the crowd, his voice cutting through the silence like a blade.

"I have no doubt Pacific Crest International will prove to be a valuable partner for Blackwood Industries."

His words confirmed Pacific Crest's new role in the company.

Julian stepped forward, his tone shifting into something more deliberate.

"Of course. Allow me to introduce to you all—the President of Pacific Crest International..."
###Chapter 876

The room fell into stunned silence.

Reginald Blackwood's brows furrowed deeply. "The President of Pacific Crest International is here?"

He had only expected Julian Whitmore, the Vice President, to attend the meeting in Montecito.

The President of Pacific Crest International was an enigma—rarely seen, rarely heard. All company affairs, big or small, were handled by a select group of elite agents.

These agents operated under the president's direct command.

Those who failed to meet expectations were swiftly replaced.

Julian Whitmore was the exception. He had held the position of Vice President longer than anyone else.

His name alone carried weight in the industry.

Julian represented Pacific Crest International in every way. Yet, the identity of the true mastermind behind the company remained a mystery.

So when Julian suddenly announced the president's presence, the air in the room thickened with tension.

No one had anticipated this.

The whispers began.

"Mr. Whitmore, is the president truly here?"

"Does this mean Pacific Crest International is expanding into Montecito's market?"

"I heard their president is a ghost—some employees go years without ever seeing him. He only communicates directly with the vice president..."

Julian remained composed, a faint smile playing on his lips. He nodded slightly in response to Reginald Blackwood's question.

"Yes, our president is here. When he learned of your willingness to transfer your shares to Pacific Crest International, he was... pleased. From this moment forward, our companies are family."

Reginald's expression darkened. His voice was sharp, cutting through the murmurs.

"Then where is he? Bring him out."

Julian stepped aside, gesturing toward Nathan Blackwood.

"He's right here, isn't he, President Blackwood?"

Silence.

Absolute, suffocating silence.

Not even the sound of breathing could be heard.

On the stage, Reginald's face twisted in disbelief.

The crowd below erupted in hushed disbelief.

"Pacific Crest International belongs to Mr. Blackwood?"

"Mr. Whitmore, you must be mistaken. How could Mr. Blackwood be the president?"

"This makes no sense. If the shares were going to him anyway, why the charade?"

Evelyn Sinclair stood motionless, her initial shock giving way to quiet understanding.

Nathan Blackwood—the president of Pacific Crest International.

No one had seen this coming.

Yet, now that the truth was out, it made perfect sense.

Nathan's influence had never been limited to Blackwood Industries. His reach extended far beyond what anyone had imagined.

But one thing was certain—Reginald had been completely blindsided.

What he thought was a trap for Nathan had been Nathan's game all along.

The whispers grew louder, more frantic.

Reginald's patience snapped.

"Enough!"

The room fell silent again.

Reginald turned to Julian, his aged eyes burning with something dangerous.

"Explain yourself, Mr. Whitmore. What does Pacific Crest International have to do with Nathan?"
###Chapter 877

Nathan Blackwood's lips curved into a composed smile as he spoke with measured precision.

"Perhaps my previous introduction was insufficient. Allow me to formally present the President of Pacific Crest International—Mr. Nathan Blackwood!"

The moment the words left his lips, Harrison, standing at the forefront, was the first to break into applause.

One by one, the sound of clapping filled the grand hall.

The guests were unmistakably acknowledging the President of Pacific Crest International—and the multiple formidable identities Nathan held within Blackwood Industries.

Was it shocking?

NovelDreams Publishing holds this content.

The attendees had already been in awe of Nathan's influence, but now, to discover he was also the head of Pacific Crest International? His status had just become untouchable.

Nathan's expression remained cool, his dark gaze sweeping over the crowd. When his eyes landed on Evelyn Sinclair, they lingered for a fraction of a second, and the corner of his mouth lifted in a faint, knowing smile. Then, his deep, commanding voice cut through the murmurs.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the collaboration between Pacific Crest International and Blackwood Industries marks a new beginning. This decision was finalized by Reginald Blackwood after extensive discussions with the board of shareholders. On behalf of Pacific Crest International, I can confidently say—I have high expectations for this partnership."

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.

"This isn't merely a transfer of shares. It's the expansion of an entirely new frontier for Blackwood Industries—one that holds immense significance for both corporations."

A beat of silence followed. Then, applause erupted, louder and more fervent than before.

With just a few sentences, Nathan had made it clear—he had known about this arrangement all along. Reginald Blackwood hadn't sold his shares in secret. This was a strategic move, a calculated step forward for Blackwood Industries. The abruptness of the event suddenly made sense. The skepticism in the guests' expressions faded.

Only Reginald Blackwood's face darkened, his complexion turning ashen. Nathan had effortlessly dismantled any doubts with a handful of words. Julian Whitmore descended the stage, engaging enthusiastically with the crowd.

Everyone was eager to align themselves with Pacific Crest International, clamoring for a chance to speak with Nathan. Yet, as Nathan stood there, an unspoken tension crackled between him and Reginald.

Harrison stepped closer, glancing briefly at the old man before murmuring to Nathan, "The contract is flawless, sir."

In other words—Reginald's grand scheme had backfired spectacularly. He had orchestrated this entire charade only to hand his shares directly to Nathan.

What a bitter irony.

Reginald's shock had morphed into fury. His hands trembled as he pointed an accusatory finger at Nathan. "Pacific Crest International is yours? All this time—it was yours?"

He had always believed Nathan owed his success to him—that without Blackwood Industries, Nathan would be nothing.

But now?

The vast, enigmatic empire of Pacific Crest International belonged to Nathan?

A corporation with deeper pockets and more intricate power structures than Blackwood Industries itself?

No wonder Nathan had remained indifferent to Reginald's schemes.

He had been playing the long game.

Nathan's expression was unreadable, his voice icy. "Yes. It's mine."

"You hid this—just to humiliate me today?" Reginald's voice was hoarse with rage.

Nathan's gaze didn't waver. "No. I never intended for Pacific Crest to intersect with Blackwood Industries. You forced this outcome."

Pacific Crest International existed to prove one thing—Nathan didn't need Blackwood Industries to stand at the top.

His loyalty to the family was the only reason he had stayed.

Reginald's eyes burned with fury. When he noticed Harrison standing loyally at Nathan's side, his lips twisted.

"Don't pretend innocence. Harrison was never truly on my side, was he? He was following your orders all along."
###Chapter 878

Reginald Blackwood's hand trembled with rage as he pointed at Harrison standing beside Nathan.

"You brought Julian Whitmore from Pacific Crest International to me just so I could sell my shares and retaliate against you!" His voice cracked with fury. "Since you control everything in Montecito, of course I'd choose a foreign company over a domestic one—You—You planned all of this!"

Harrison remained composed at Nathan's side, his tone measured.

"Reginald, no one forced you to sell. Had you kept your shares, you'd still hold a stake in Blackwood Industries. President Blackwood never cared about the scattered shares."

He paused, his gaze steady.

"Everyone could have had their piece. But you allied with Blackwood’s branch executives to undermine the president. Did you ever consider what would happen to the company if it fell into the wrong hands?"

"Silence! You have no right to speak here!"

Reginald lashed out at Harrison, his anger misplaced.

This man, who had seemingly betrayed Nathan, was in fact more loyal than anyone.

Harrison pressed his lips together, expressionless, and said no more.

Nathan’s face betrayed no arrogance, but his eyes gleamed with icy resolve.

"Reginald, you put me in this position. Did you ever stop to think about the mess you left behind when you retired?"

His voice was devoid of warmth.

"Your old friends drained the company dry, leaving it drowning in debt. Did you really believe I climbed to where I am by standing on your shoulders?"

Reginald’s gaze flickered, his narrowed eyes locked onto Nathan.

"Are you biting the hand that fed you?"

Nathan’s expression darkened.

"I cleaned up your mess. I never exposed your failures—out of respect. But did you really think you could hold an empty shell of Blackwood Industries over my head for life?"

A cold smile touched his lips.

"If that’s the case, I have no problem unearthing the evidence from the beginning. Let the world see just how pathetic this company was when I took over."

Outsiders saw only the polished exterior. But when Nathan stepped in, the foundation was crumbling.

He could have walked away.

But Reginald’s expectations weighed on him.

So he rebuilt it—piece by piece—until Blackwood Industries stood unshakable at the top.

He had been more than generous.

This empire was his creation now. Not the hollow ruin Reginald had left behind.

Reginald’s body shook violently. His gaze darkened as he faced this ruthless man.

He had lost control.

From this moment on, he had nothing left to threaten Nathan with.

Nathan was untouchable.

A slow, defeated exhale escaped him.

"Nathan Blackwood… I underestimated you. You’d turn the entire Blackwood family into your enemy—for a woman?"

His aged eyes flicked toward Evelyn Sinclair, a mocking smile twisting his lips.

"But does she even care? She doesn’t look at you the way you want. Nathan… you’re just as pitiful as the rest of us."

Nathan’s expression tightened imperceptibly.

"The assets under your name are enough to last your lifetime. If we can’t coexist peacefully, then we’ll sever ties completely."

With that, he turned and walked away.

Every step of this charade had been a test—one last chance for Reginald to step back.

The foolish sentiment he once held for the Blackwood name was gone now.

When they sent him away for training, there had been no affection.

When Reginald took him in, he no longer needed it.

Nathan had always been alone.

Few noticed when he left the party.

But Evelyn did.
###Chapter 879

He was Reginald Blackwood, a man from a different era.

Time hadn't changed him at all.

Though age had caught up with him, his presence still commanded respect.

Nathan Blackwood might have surpassed him in power, but challenging someone stronger was a fool's game.

The glass in Preston Sinclair's hand brushed against Evelyn's fingers, his touch light and deliberate.

"What's on your mind? I didn’t expect Mr. Blackwood to turn the tables like that. A flawless victory."

Evelyn looked away.

The glittering ballroom couldn’t erase the solitary figure lingering in her thoughts.

She forced indifference into her voice.

She knew Nathan didn’t love her. But she hadn’t anticipated him winning so decisively.

"Evelyn, do you pity him?"

She froze, turning to face Preston.

His lips pressed together, expression unreadable.

"Mr. Blackwood walked away unharmed, but it’s clear his family abandoned him. Do you feel sorry for him?"

The question hung between them, weighted with curiosity.

Evelyn blinked, her tone cool.

"I’m satisfied with Reginald Blackwood’s fate. But that doesn’t mean I stand on Nathan’s side."

Sympathy was reserved for the weak.

Was Nathan weak?

Preston glanced away, as if lost in thought.

Evelyn exhaled.

That last sentence had unsettled her more than she cared to admit.

Thankfully, he didn’t press further.

The night’s excitement had run its course.

Just as Evelyn considered leaving early, Julian Whitmore approached.

He held a wineglass, a familiar smirk playing on his lips.

"I thought my eyes deceived me, but it really is you, Evie."

Evie—a nickname Julian had coined from her middle name, Eve, back when she worked at Pacific Crest International.

She’d always hated it.

But Julian had been her boss. His word was law.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Long time no see, Mr. Whitmore."

His grin widened. "If you missed me, you could’ve reached out. But you never did."

"Guess I didn’t miss you enough," she countered.

Julian huffed a laugh.

Preston raised a brow. "You two know each other?"

Evelyn nodded, unwilling to dredge up her past overseas.

Julian, however, had no such reservations. "Old friends. Mr. Sinclair, I’ve heard much about you. My contacts in Pacifica speak highly of you. Never thought we’d meet like this."

They shook hands, polite but distant.

"Likewise, Mr. Whitmore. A pleasant surprise."

In their world, connections were currency.

No one turned down opportunities.

After exchanging pleasantries, Julian turned back to Evelyn, his gaze softening.

"Evie, it’s been too long. Let’s find somewhere quiet to catch up."

Her jaw tightened. "We don’t have much to discuss."

Her expression might as well have screamed, Not interested.

Truthfully, Julian had taught her plenty. But their values had never aligned.

He hesitated, then tried another angle. "Which company are you with now? Maybe we could collaborate—Pacific Crest and yours?"

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll.

Julian sighed, downing his wine in one go.
###Chapter 880

Asher—no, Julian Whitmore—saw the icy demeanor in Evelyn Sinclair's eyes and knew he needed to change tactics.

Emotional appeals had failed. Now, it was time to dangle the bait.

After all, countless companies in Montecito would kill for a partnership with Pacific Crest International.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

"Sorry, but I don’t see us working together."

Beside her, Preston Sinclair immediately understood—this wasn’t a friendly reunion.

Noticing Evelyn’s frosty expression, Preston stepped forward, his hand resting lightly on her shoulder.

"You mentioned wanting to catch a movie earlier. We should head out."

Evelyn met his gaze and nodded. "Let’s go."

They walked away, leaving Julian standing there, stunned.

He cursed under his breath and downed his drink in one gulp.

Harrison, Nathan Blackwood’s right-hand man, had witnessed the entire exchange.

He approached Julian with a knowing look. "Mr. Whitmore, you know Ms. Sinclair?"

Julian scoffed. "Know her? We’re very familiar." His eyes narrowed. "But why is she here? Working for Blackwood Industries now?"

Harrison smirked. "She’s the CEO of Sterling Enterprises. And, well… she’s also President Blackwood’s ex-wife."

Julian’s glass nearly slipped from his fingers. "Holy shit."

He had known "Annie" for years—yet somehow, this bombshell had escaped him.

Without another word, Julian rushed off to find Nathan.

Outside, the biting wind clawed at Evelyn’s skin, seeping into her bones.

Then, warmth enveloped her as Preston draped his coat over her shoulders.

"Consider this my chance to impress you," he said smoothly. "No refusing."

Evelyn swallowed her thanks and smirked. "Smooth move."

Preston chuckled. "Goodbye, then."

She blinked. "Wait—weren’t we going to the movies?"

He froze, cheeks flushing. "I thought that was just an excuse to escape."

Evelyn laughed. "Come on. It’s early. My treat—for helping me out."

His eyes softened. "I’d be honored."

Inside the car, warmth finally returned to her limbs.

Preston hesitated before speaking again.

"There’s something I’ve been meaning to say."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Oh?"

"I owe you an apology."

"For what?"

"That day at the gym." His voice was low. "I never meant to make you uncomfortable. My feelings for you are real. This isn’t some game to get back at anyone."

Silence settled between them.

Evelyn hadn’t given the incident much thought—she hadn’t realized Preston had carried this guilt for so long.

Had she been too harsh?

She studied his profile, illuminated by passing streetlights. His expression was earnest, eyes filled with regret.

"Preston, using people as shields is just survival. I don’t hold it against you."

"But I’m not pursuing you as a shield." He turned to her, intensity burning in his gaze. "I’m doing it because I want you, Evelyn."

The raw sincerity in his voice sent a shiver down her spine.

She’d heard countless confessions before—empty words from men who saw her as a prize.

But this?

This felt different.

Like the faintest brush of fingers against her pulse, setting her skin alight.
###Chapter 881

Evelyn fell silent, and Preston pressed his lips together.

"I'm sorry," he murmured. "I'm not trying to push you. But you did promise me a chance."

His voice softened. "You won't take that back, will you?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip, suddenly aware of the heat rising in her cheeks.

Maybe it was the lack of air circulation in the car.

She answered quickly, eager to shift the topic. "Mr. Sinclair, aren’t you curious how Julian and I met?"

Preston paused, then smiled. "How did you?"

Relieved to steer the conversation somewhere lighter, Evelyn recounted the past.

"Years ago, Julian was just a low-level manager at Pacific Crest International. I interned under him while studying abroad."

Preston’s brows lifted in surprise.

There was a lot to unpack in that statement.

With her background as a Sterling heiress, why would she even need an internship?

And how had Julian climbed to Vice President in just a few years?

Yet, he clearly didn’t know her true identity.

"But from how you two interacted tonight, you don’t seem like old friends."

Evelyn scoffed.

"He’s competent, sure. But the kind who claws his way up by any means necessary."

She crossed her arms. "Once, at a company event, his associate tried to pressure me into drinking. Julian encouraged it."

Her lip curled. "A man like that has no principles. Why would I befriend him?"

No wonder her demeanor toward him had been icy rather than warm.

Preston’s voice dropped, concern threading through. "What happened? You didn’t drink, did you?"

Evelyn smirked. "I suspected the wine was spiked. Not only did I refuse, but I threw the glass in his face, quit on the spot, and walked out."

Preston turned to look at her, admiration glinting in his eyes. "Classic Ms. Sterling. Never one to suffer fools."

The memory was satisfying.

She hadn’t been there to grovel—she’d gone to learn. If the lesson was corporate backstabbing, she had no patience for it.

A Sterling didn’t endure humiliation.

Evelyn tilted her head. "How did someone like him become Vice President?"

Pacific Crest International’s VP wasn’t just a regional title—it was second only to the CEO. Julian’s rise had been meteoric.

Preston shrugged. "If he delivers results, no one cares about his methods. And in the business world, Julian’s reputation is polished. Sharp, yes, but generous where it counts."

Seeing Evelyn’s frown, he quickly amended, "Or maybe everyone else only sees the facade. You saw the real him."

Evelyn’s expression cleared, pleased with the correction.

"Exactly," she agreed. That had to be it.

When they reached the theater, Preston offered her his coat.

Evelyn hesitated, then took it—better than freezing.

She tugged the collar up, hiding half her face. No one would recognize her now.

Preston watched her drown in his jacket, amused, before heading to buy tickets.

He returned in under a minute.

Evelyn had been eyeing the movie posters, all of which looked intriguing.

Preston tugged her sleeve. "Only one film’s still playing."

So much for choice.
###Chapter 882

Evelyn didn't mind. It was merely a way to pass the time.

Preston guided her into the theater. The entrance was dimly lit, making it difficult for Evelyn to see clearly. She followed closely behind him. "Are our seats in the front or back?" she asked.

Preston remained silent.

When they reached the screening area where the light was better, he pulled out a thick stack of tickets from his pocket.

Evelyn gasped in surprise.

"Take your pick," Preston said casually. He had bought out the entire theater.

Seeing Evelyn's shocked expression, Preston's gaze softened. "I was concerned about potential misunderstandings if people saw us watching a movie together. So I thought it best to ensure complete privacy. I'll wait until you're comfortable being seen in public with me."

No matter how indifferent or unreasonable Evelyn acted, Preston always accommodated her concerns.

He had anticipated every unspoken worry she might have.

Evelyn lowered her eyes, feeling particularly guilty for suspecting Preston had ulterior motives earlier. 'Preston is genuinely kind. How could I think he would use me? I'm the one with the twisted thoughts!'

Her nose tingled unexpectedly as she looked up at him.

"Has such a considerate Mr. Sinclair really never had a girlfriend before?" Preston froze momentarily before chuckling. "Don't believe me? My thoughtfulness comes from having an extra mischievous child most people don't have to deal with."

Evelyn smiled. "Oliver makes a convenient excuse, doesn't he?"

"I should protest," Preston said, "but I'm secretly pleased you care about my past relationships." His smile radiated warmth, his refined features calm and gentle.

Evelyn found herself momentarily stunned by Preston's gaze. She quickly turned away and headed for the back row - the best viewing spot. Preston followed closely.

The movie began.

The title "Curse of the Mourning" appeared in blood-red letters dripping across the screen.

Evelyn frowned, turning to Preston. "A horror film?"

'Why do men always choose horror movies? Is it to showcase their bravery in dark spaces?' Evelyn hadn't expected Preston to be so predictable.

Preston looked genuinely surprised. "Isn't this a Japanese cultural film? The ticket agent said it promoted traditional mythology..."

'Elegant international cultural exchange would suit our image perfectly. What the hell is this horror nonsense? This isn't what I wanted!' Preston thought.

Realizing Preston had been duped, Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

"Well, technically he wasn't wrong. It is a Japanese horror film..." She found Preston's reaction more entertaining than the movie itself.

Speechless, Preston stood up. "I'll exchange it for something else."

Evelyn caught his sleeve. "Don't bother. Let's just watch this."

Preston sat back down reluctantly, muttering, "This is ridiculous. Women get frightened by films like this. No wonder this showing was empty. That clerk..."

Evelyn noticed Preston's unusually flustered behavior and found it amusing. Her eyes crinkled with suppressed laughter.

What an unexpectedly sensitive soul...

As the eerie soundtrack played, Evelyn focused on the screen.

An innocent-looking girl entered a bathroom.

Suddenly, the lights flickered violently before exploding.

Tense music accompanied the girl's growing panic.

Evelyn watched anxiously.

The screen went black. Three seconds later, bloodcurdling screams erupted as the girl desperately tried to open the locked door.

At that moment, a dark shadow passed behind the remaining light source. The terrifying silhouette made viewers' skin crawl.

How ridiculously fake!
###Chapter 883

Evelyn was just about to comment on the predictable horror movie plot to Preston when she noticed his pale face.

He had both hands covering his eyes, refusing to look at the screen.

This surprised her. "A Wall Street tycoon afraid of horror films?"

"Mr. Sinclair, are you okay?"

Hearing her voice, Preston immediately lowered his hands and forced a composed expression.

"I'm perfectly fine."

But his strained smile betrayed him.

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle. The mighty Preston Sinclair terrified by a movie?

"See, she's pushing the door when she should be pulling it. That's why it won't open."

Preston turned just as a long-haired ghost appeared with a shriek. He visibly jumped.

His knuckles turned white gripping the armrests, dark eyes wide with shock.

"Right...of course..." His voice came out hoarse.

Evelyn suppressed a smile. "We can leave if it's too much-"

"No! I'm just...appreciating the cultural aspects." His excuse sounded weak even to himself. Then he frowned. "Why aren't you scared at all?"

Evelyn blinked. "Lucas takes me on set all the time. I know how they film these scenes."

"Ah." Preston nodded in understanding.

After composing himself, he asked curiously, "Does Lucas make horror films?"

She shook her head. "Bad for his image and box office numbers."

Their casual conversation helped pass the time.

Evelyn noticed Preston's tense posture - his eyes never actually focused on the screen.

For two hours, he sat rigidly through the ordeal.

Afterwards, while Evelyn bought drinks, she spotted Preston leaning against the wall taking deep breaths.

She shook her head in amusement. "Such a delicate yet perfect man."

Handing him water, she watched as he gulped half the bottle immediately.

A Wall Street legend reduced to this by a horror film?

"It's getting late. Shall we head back?" she suggested.

Preston nodded, his lips curving into a weak smile.

At the car, Evelyn stopped him. "Let me drive."

His current state didn't inspire confidence behind the wheel. After a pause, Preston agreed.

Back at Sterling Manor, Evelyn offered to have a driver take him home.

"No need. I'm fine now," he insisted.

She didn't press further.

Inside, she found Lucas gaming in the living room with Leo assisting via iPad. The AI tiger's superior processing made them unstoppable.

"Isn't this cheating?" Evelyn teased.

Lucas paused. "Leo's my little brother!"

As if on cue, Leo dropped the tablet and circled Evelyn's feet excitedly.

"Mama, hold me!"

Laughing, she scooped up the AI tiger, shooting Lucas a triumphant look. "Not my fault you're getting outplayed."
###Chapter 884

Evelyn scooped up Leo and headed upstairs.

Alexander descended the steps, his expression as icy as ever. "Didn't the party end hours ago?"

"I had business to attend to." She paused. "Have you heard about the Blackwood family situation?"

Alexander was always well-connected. News of Pacific Crest International falling under Nathan's control had spread before the gala even concluded.

While surprising, it wasn’t exactly shocking.

He gave a curt nod. "Weren’t you interning at Pacific Crest for a while? They don’t know, do they?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Nathan probably doesn’t. But Julian Whitmore might. Not that it matters—they wouldn’t dare make it public."

Alexander considered this, his face unreadable.

"Blackwood Industries will be chaos after this restructuring," he said coolly. "The branch families will lose privileges and throw tantrums. Best to stay out of it."

Evelyn blinked, then nodded.

To the branches, this would look like Reginald Blackwood conspiring with Nathan to swindle them.

Infighting was inevitable.

Alexander rubbed his temples. "By the way, Vincent Caldwell has been hounding me to sign that contract. I refused. His personal scandals are one thing, but now his product quality is slipping—"

Evelyn stiffened.

Vincent’s company had been industry-leading, which was why Sterling Enterprises kept working with them. If standards dropped, there was no reason to continue. Survival of the fittest ruled this world.

"Let’s investigate further," she said. "Better safe than sorry."

Good thing she’d planned to raise his costs earlier. If quality was subpar, her move would’ve been pointless.

Alexander yawned and turned toward the door.

Evelyn frowned. "Where are you going this late?"

"Picking Amelia up from work," he muttered.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Just then, Lucas appeared, freshly changed, checking his watch.

"You’re leaving too?" she asked.

Lucas smirked. "Natalie barely ate tonight. I’m bringing her food."

Evelyn brightened. "I’ll come! I haven’t seen her in ages!"

Lucas shot her a warning look.

"Third wheels aren’t welcome. Stay home."

Evelyn huffed and stormed upstairs.

Her brothers were insufferable.

Blackwood Industries

In Nathan’s office, Julian Whitmore stared at the takeout in disbelief. "I flew across the country for this?"

Even if it was from a Michelin-starred chef, the setting was all wrong.

No candles. No flowers. Nothing.

Nathan lounged in his chair, indifferent.

"Don’t eat it if you don’t want to."

Julian sighed.

He’d drunk too much at the gala to have an appetite anyway.

"Have you finalized the Asia region president?"

Regional heads were appointed under Pacific Crest’s name, but Julian handled the interviews.

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Nathaniel Graves and Cassandra Blake. Your recommendations?"

Julian chuckled. "Top performers. Nathaniel’s steady. Cassandra’s driven. Pity she’s a woman—"
###Chapter 885

The corporate world preached gender equality, yet when evaluating leadership potential, unconscious bias still favored men.

Nathan Blackwood remained silent.

Julian Whitmore leaned forward. "But I have higher hopes for Cassandra Blake. She's exceptionally competent for her age - barely thirty and already at this level. We could market her as the beautiful, ambitious CEO breaking glass ceilings. She'd be perfect as our Pacific Crest International face for Asia!"

Nathan's voice turned icy. "Don't pretend you don't know how she climbed so fast. Her political maneuvering can't compare to Nathaniel Graves' actual qualifications."

Julian stiffened.

A heavy silence fell between them.

Then Julian's lips curled into an amused smirk. "Since when did you care about corporate networking? You're sounding just like Evelyn—oh wait, your ex-wife!"

Nathan froze, his piercing gaze locking onto Julian. "Who did you just mention?"

"Evelyn Sinclair. President of Sterling Enterprises now. Did you know she interned at Pacific Crest International for two months during her European years? Who would've guessed a trust fund princess would bother with internships?" Julian shook his head in disbelief.

"Evelyn Sinclair worked at Pacific Crest?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low. "You didn't know?" Julian chuckled. "Out of all the interns, I picked her because she was brilliant, beautiful, and relentless. I planned to groom her as my protégé—took her to every important meeting."

His expression turned rueful. "Then at one client dinner, a drunk executive demanded she drink. The contract was nearly signed—I just wanted her to take one sip. I poured the wine myself to ensure it was safe."

Julian's fingers tapped the armrest. "She threw the glass in my face and quit on the spot. Haven't spoken since." His laugh held no real humor. "Now I understand—she was Sterling Enterprises' heiress all along. No wonder she dared humiliate her boss."

Nathan's expression darkened, thoughts churning. 'Our paths crossed long before we knew. If only we'd met differently...'

Oblivious, Julian continued, "Her file's long gone—just an intern back when record-keeping was lax. She left a phone number, but judging by her glare earlier, she still despises me." He sighed dramatically. "Such wasted potential."

The office fell silent again.

Nathan massaged his temples. "Let's table the Asia president decision. We'll monitor the situation."

Julian smirked. "Don't say I didn't warn you. Those two won't sit idle—they're probably already in Montecito making moves."

Nathan remained impassive.

To him, ambition without action showed weakness—but ruthless scheming revealed dangerous selfishness. Even Julian couldn't decipher what Nathan truly wanted.

Days later.

The expected power struggle at Blackwood Industries never materialized—Nathan's iron control smoothed all turbulence.

In a penthouse suite at The Regal Grand, Julian lay tangled with a naked woman.

Post-coital, she pouted. "Mr. Whitmore, any updates from Mr. Blackwood about the Asia position?"

Julian abruptly stood and dressed. "No idea." His tone left no room for further questions.
###Chapter 886

Sterling Enterprises.

Evelyn Sinclair felt significantly more at ease since Alexander Sterling's return.

She lounged in her office, sipping coffee while reviewing documents.

Just as she glanced at the clock, considering lunch, Bennett entered.

"President, Seraphina Devereux is here."

Evelyn frowned, recalling her previous encounter with Seraphina and Vincent Caldwell at the golf club.

"Send her away."

Bennett nodded and turned to leave—until Seraphina pushed past him. She wore oversized sunglasses and a scarf wrapped tightly around her face, as if deliberately drawing attention to her celebrity status.

Evelyn's expression turned icy. "Call security." She had no patience for theatrics.

The last time she'd helped Seraphina, the woman hadn't even bothered with a thank-you before vanishing. Now, Evelyn couldn't care less about the truth behind Seraphina and Vincent's messy dispute. It wasn't her problem.

Seraphina rushed forward, hastily removing her sunglasses. Her eyes were wide with desperation. "Ms. Sterling, please—just five minutes. I came to thank you properly for last time."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Unnecessary. You're a busy woman, Ms. Devereux. I wouldn't expect you to remember such a trivial favor."

Seraphina's lips pressed into a thin line. "I was afraid Vincent's people would catch me. I had to run. When I returned to set, my agent confiscated my phone. I swear, I wanted to reach out sooner."

Evelyn wasn't interested in excuses. She smiled coolly. "If that's all, you may leave."

Seraphina hesitated, fingers twisting nervously.

"I know Sterling Enterprises is negotiating with Vincent. I came to warn you—this isn't about me. It's about your company."

Evelyn paused, then gestured for Bennett to exit.

Once they were alone, she took a slow sip of coffee. "And why should I care about your warning?"

Seraphina sat across from her, posture rigid. Unlike their last meeting, she looked polished—her makeup flawless, her demeanor sharper.

"Ms. Sterling, Vincent's production line is on the verge of collapse. If you sign that contract, he plans to outsource manufacturing and dump defective products on you. He's abandoning that line entirely—because he's using your deal as a cash grab to fund his real plan: stealing your core technology."

Evelyn studied her, unreadable. "Proof?"

Seraphina exhaled. "One of your R&D managers has been meeting with Vincent. He invested in Vincent's new company last week."

She pulled out her phone, swiping to a wedding photo. In the background, Vincent stood smugly beside the groom—a face Evelyn recognized instantly.

He'd been in her R&D meeting.

Her grip on the coffee cup tightened.

Seraphina's claim just became dangerously credible.

They'd already considered ending negotiations—but theft?

The cardiac pacemaker was Sterling Enterprises' breakthrough medical device, currently in limited distribution to major hospitals for testing. Each unit was serialized, equipped with real-time feedback.

Preliminary results were stellar, but formal expert reviews hadn't begun. Only senior leadership knew the full details.

And now, someone inside was leaking them.
###Chapter 887

Only the director of R&D could access the final prototype.

Evelyn Sinclair's expression turned icy, her gaze sharpening with displeasure. "This was happening right under my nose. How dare Vincent Caldwell..."

"Ms. Sterling, if you doubt my words, check your inventory. One device is missing. According to my sources, it's already been delivered to Vincent's brother-in-law's residence."

Evelyn lifted her chin, her face an unreadable mask.

She smirked. "Seraphina, did you intentionally wait until after the theft to bring me this information?"

Seraphina Devereux stiffened, lowering her eyes. Evelyn had seen right through her.

"Yes. Otherwise, you wouldn't have believed me."

Evelyn chuckled darkly and summoned Bennett. "Contact the authorities. We're reporting corporate theft. Suspend the R&D manager immediately and freeze all his access."

Bennett glanced at Seraphina before nodding. "Right away."

Evelyn returned the phone to Seraphina. "Assuming this checks out, what do you want in return?"

Seraphina exhaled in relief. "No payment necessary. You helped me before, Ms. Sterling. This is me returning the favor."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Is that so? Then I won't insist."

People were too exhausted for pretenses. If Seraphina refused to state her terms, Evelyn wouldn't press. Seraphina's expression faltered. "Well... if you could arrange for my daughter to study abroad..."

Evelyn studied her intently, frowning.

Seraphina bowed her head. "I'd be eternally grateful."

"I don't follow, Ms. Devereux."

Seraphina inhaled sharply. "Vincent has a legitimate child. Yet he obsessively monitors my illegitimate daughter and me. Do you know why?" This indeed piqued Evelyn's curiosity.

"His wife's child has leukemia. They need a bone marrow transplant. They secretly tested my daughter—she's a perfect match!"

Seraphina's eyes reddened, her features twisting with fury.

She ground her teeth. "They treat my child like spare parts! She's not even ten—this would traumatize her, not to mention the developmental risks. I won't let them exploit her!"

It was the first time Evelyn had heard a mistress call the legal wife's family "shameless."

"If it's just sending your daughter abroad, surely you can manage that yourself?"

Evelyn eyed her skeptically. Actresses earned substantial incomes, especially rising stars like Seraphina. Why involve Evelyn?

Seraphina averted her gaze. "Vincent's people watch my every move. If I step foot overseas, they'll snatch her back instantly. I can't risk it. Ms. Sterling, please smuggle her out discreetly. Reveal her location to no one. Once things stabilize, I'll retrieve her myself..."

It sounded reasonable.

"But isn't it impractical for a child to live abroad alone?"

Evelyn implied that relocating Seraphina too would simplify childcare. When Evelyn had studied abroad, the Sterlings had panicked—180 daily calls, Alexander threatening to fly over just to cook for her...

Seraphina smiled bitterly. "She's accustomed to solitude. I can't leave—my career's peaking now. An actress's prime lasts barely two years. If I vanish from public view for three days, audiences forget me..."
###Chapter 888

Seraphina couldn't bring herself to abandon the success that was finally within her grasp.

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. "Fine. I'll do it."

It wasn't a complicated request.

Seraphina exhaled in relief, gratitude softening her expression. "Thank you, Ms. Sinclair. I truly appreciate this."

Evelyn recalled Preston's words and suddenly looked up. "You swear you've never harmed the child?"

Seraphina blinked, startled. "Of course not. I'm barely home a few weeks a year—when would I even have the chance?"

Evelyn gave a slow nod. "I'll contact you once arrangements are made."

If she dug deeper, the blame would likely fall on Vincent or the nanny. Not Seraphina.

The actress stood, smoothing her dress with a satisfied smile. "Perfect. I'll prepare on my end." She paused, then added with saccharine sweetness, "And Ms. Sinclair, I do hope you find love soon. Every woman deserves a beautiful child of her own."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her pen. That alone nearly made her rescind the offer.

Seraphina left, smug. She hadn’t just chosen Evelyn for her connections—she knew Sterling Enterprises' involvement would make Vincent think twice before interfering.

He wants his son to live while my daughter had to die? Over my dead body.

Minutes later, Bennett returned.

"President, the stolen prototype was recovered from Damian Reeves' residence. Legal has filed charges, and HR is processing his termination."

Evelyn tapped her desk. "Check something else—does Vincent Caldwell really have a son with leukemia?"

Bennett paused. "Confirmed. Mr. Sinclair's investigation verified it."

So Seraphina hadn’t lied.

"Understood."

Bennett cleared his throat. "Mr. Sinclair has been waiting outside. He asked if you're free for lunch."

Evelyn almost laughed. Seraphina barged in unannounced, while Preston waited politely. The contrast was striking.

When Preston entered, his steps were measured, his smile warm. He acknowledged Bennett before turning to her.

"I was nearby and thought I'd drop in. Lunch?"

Evelyn hesitated.

Preston, ever perceptive, added softly, "Or I could ask again tonight if now isn’t a good time."

Her lips twitched. "You're never a bother."

Dinner felt too much like a date. Lunch was safer.

She grabbed her phone and the six-figure Birkin she rarely used.

The restaurant was an upscale spot favored by executives—exorbitant prices kept the crowds thin, leaving the space serene.

The decor was modern elegance, the air scented with bespoke fragrances that cost more than most cars.

Patrons preferred the main dining area over private rooms; the ambiance was worth the lack of privacy.

While Preston parked, Evelyn settled at their table, scanning the menu.

A cloying wave of perfume hit her before the woman did.

Evelyn looked up.

A red-clad figure in stilettos loomed over her, bold makeup accentuating calculated charm. Years in business had honed Evelyn’s instincts—this woman was trouble.

"Evelyn Sinclair? I knew it was you!" The stranger beamed, leaning in aggressively.

Evelyn recoiled. "Do I know you?"

The woman laughed, too loud. "Ava York! We were classmates at Stanford—not that you’d remember. You were always busy." She flicked her hair. "And I’ve had work done since then."
###Chapter 889

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in confusion. The name meant nothing to her.

Cassandra Blake had already taken the seat across from her. The woman's sultry eyes curved like crescent moons, capable of stealing souls with a single glance.

"Such a coincidence." Cassandra's smile was polished, radiating calculated charm. "I never expected to run into you here. It's been ages since I last saw an old classmate."

Evelyn offered a polite smile but remained silent.

The waiter placed a lemonade before her. Evelyn studied Cassandra. "Here for lunch too?" Her tone implied the other woman should leave. Strangers ruined her appetite.

Cassandra nodded. "Just transferred to Montecito for work. Still getting my bearings." She waved at the waiter. "Since we're both here, let's dine together. My treat."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as Cassandra requested another menu.

Only professional social climbers acted this familiar with strangers.

Cassandra ordered several signature dishes before sliding the menu to Evelyn. "Order whatever you like. Don't hold back."

Evelyn hesitated. Something felt off about this encounter. She met the waiter's gaze. "One of everything, please."

Cassandra's smile faltered. "That's... quite an appetite."

"My colleague's joining us." Evelyn sipped her drink. "If that's a problem, I'll cover the bill."

Cassandra's eye twitched. Trust fund babies really were different - Evelyn hadn't even glanced at the prices. "Of course not! It's my pleasure."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes as she assessed Cassandra's designer ensemble. Five-figure outfit. Impeccable makeup. Clearly premeditated.

A woman's handbag told her story. Cassandra clutched this season's XN tote - six figures. Pathetic compared to Evelyn's eight-figure Hermès.

Years in high society had taught Evelyn to read people through their accessories. Cassandra's practiced generosity couldn't mask her calculating nature.

Had Evelyn not been raised by William and Alexander Sterling to observe carefully, she might have fallen for Cassandra's act.

Evelyn texted Bennett: "Bring the secretaries for lunch." His instant reply: "On our way!"

Cassandra opened her mouth to speak when Preston Sinclair arrived. "You've made a friend already?" He rested a hand on Evelyn's shoulder as she scooted inward to make space.

Cassandra stood abruptly, extending her hand. "You must be Evelyn's boyfriend?"

Preston barely grazed her fingertips before withdrawing. "Just an old friend," he said smoothly.

Cassandra's grin didn't waver. "So handsome! What do you do?"

Preston glanced at Evelyn, who answered for him. "Ms. Blake just returned to Montecito. She's... unfamiliar with local circles."

Preston offered a modest smile. "Small business owner. Nothing noteworthy."

Cassandra sighed dramatically. "Must be nice being your own boss. Not like us wage slaves, constantly scheming just to pay rent." Her gaze flicked to Evelyn's diamond watch. "Some people wake up wondering how to spend their trust funds, while the rest of us scrape by."
###Chapter 890

Evelyn Sinclair took a sip of her iced tea, her gaze lingering on Cassandra Blake with a faint smile.

"Can't help it. Life's treating me well."

If it had been anyone else, Evelyn would have retaliated without hesitation.

But when she woke up each morning, she carried the weight of thousands of livelihoods on her shoulders. A single dip in the stock market could ruin her appetite for days.

Being a CEO isn’t easy, you know?

She thought dryly.

Cassandra choked, as if cotton had been shoved down her throat.

With a forced smile, she pulled out her phone. "Let's exchange contacts. We should stay in touch..."

Evelyn hesitated for only a second before nodding.

"Sure."

She was curious—what was Cassandra really after?

Once their numbers were saved, Cassandra slid her phone toward Preston Sinclair, batting her lashes with practiced charm.

"Your turn."

Preston declined smoothly. "I don’t use social media much."

Cassandra propped her chin on her hand, her gaze flickering between him and Evelyn. "That’s just an excuse, isn’t it? Who doesn’t use social media these days?"

She smirked.

"Unless Evelyn forbids you from talking to other women? Surely she’s not that petty?"

Evelyn arched a brow, amused. She glanced at Preston. "Go ahead. Might be useful."

Preston’s reluctance was obvious, but he complied.

Cassandra immediately sent him a heart emoji—cute, playful.

Then she checked his profile.

Blank.

Evelyn’s expression darkened briefly before smoothing out.

Preston didn’t react to the message. Instead, his attention remained on Evelyn. "Did you order yet?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Since Ms. Blake is treating, I invited my team. No point holding back."

Cassandra laughed. "Exactly! We’re old friends—next time, it’s your treat!"

Next time.

The unspoken challenge hung in the air.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver, but Preston caught the shift in her demeanor.

If Cassandra were truly a friend, Evelyn wouldn’t have taken advantage like this.

He reached over, adjusting the scarf Evelyn had tossed aside.

The waiter arrived with their food, quickly filling the table.

"Ms. Sinclair, there’s more—"

Evelyn waved a hand. "My colleagues will be here soon. Just leave the rest on the empty seats."

The waiter bowed. "Of course."

Moments later, wine was brought out. Cassandra snatched the bottle eagerly. "Let me!"

She poured a glass for Evelyn, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

"I envy you. A rich, devoted boyfriend? Must be nice. People like you—born with everything. Men fall at your feet with just a glance. Meanwhile, I’m still fighting my way up, single and struggling..."

Her gaze slid to Preston, lingering.

Then—

Her hand jerked.

Wine splashed across Preston’s shirt.

"Oh! Clumsy me!"

She rushed around the table, fingers reaching for his stained collar. "Let me help—"
###Chapter 891

Preston Sinclair suddenly stood up.

His expression darkened as he struggled to contain his anger. Years of impeccable upbringing kept him from lashing out over something so trivial.

"It's fine. I'll go to the restroom." Preston's gaze lingered on Evelyn as he spoke.

She gave a slight nod, and he strode away with long, purposeful steps.

Cassandra Blake remained frozen, guilt twisting her features. "I was so careless. How could I be this stupid? Evelyn, your boyfriend won't hold this against me, will he?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her wine. "He won't." He'll just despise you.

Cassandra sank back into her seat, anxiety gnawing at her.

"No, I should go check if he needs help. Evelyn, wait here—"

Evelyn arched a brow, her smile deepening. "Of course."

She was beginning to understand exactly why Cassandra had shown up tonight.

Moments later, a waiter approached, his cheeks flushed with discomfort.

"Ms. Sinclair, I think your friend is being harassed by that woman. Shouldn't you intervene?"

Evelyn paused, then stood, wine ss still in hand.

"Thank you. I'll handle it."

Even the staff couldn't tolerate Cassandra's shamelessness.

Evelyn walked down the corridor, lined with exquisite antique vases and oil paintings—clear evidence of the restaurant's refined taste. Before she could admire the artwork, Preston's low, furious voice cut through the air.

"You're Evelyn's classmate. Act like it."

"I just want to help you clean your shirt. You wouldn't misunderstand my intentions, would you?" Cassandra's voice dripped with false sweetness. "Besides, Evelyn cycles through men like seasons. She'll forget about you soon enough. Open your eyes—everyone knows her reputation is trash. She puts on this pristine act, but who knows what she's really like in private—"

Preston's voice turned glacial. "Ms. Blake, slandering others is beneath contempt. I have no interest in listening to your filth."

He moved to leave, but Cassandra blocked him, her red lips parting seductively.

"Why don't you want to hear the truth? Don't you want to know who she really is?"

"Because everything you say is garbage." Preston shoved past her—only to freeze when he saw Evelyn leaning against the wall, swirling her wine with deceptive calm.

His expression darkened further, his usual warmth replaced by icy fury. So Preston Sinclair could lose his temper after all.

Evelyn smirked, tilting her head. Just as she was about to speak, Cassandra stumbled out.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, her expression wounded—a stark contrast to her usual predatory gaze. It looked painfully staged.

"What did I do wrong? Do you hate me? Evelyn and I go way back. Why would I ever make a move on her boyfriend?"

She wiped fake tears, then noticed Preston hadn't left.

Her gaze lifted—and locked onto Evelyn.

Evelyn stood with effortless elegance, her posture relaxed but her eyes sharp with frost.

Cassandra stiffened, then forced a smile. "I offered to pay for a new shirt, but your boyfriend refused. How sweet."

Preston's jaw clenched. He said nothing.

Evelyn stepped forward, her chin lifting slightly.

"No need. Consider us even."
###Chapter 892

Evelyn Sinclair's eyes widened in surprise.

The next instant, she tipped her glass of red wine over Cassandra Blake's perfectly styled hair. The crimson liquid cascaded down in slow motion, staining the expensive fabric of Cassandra's designer dress.

Cassandra gasped as the cold liquid seeped into her skin, leaving her feeling sticky and humiliated.

Her face drained of color as she stumbled back, her lips parting in shock before twisting into fury. "Evelyn! How dare you—"

Evelyn's smile was ice-cold.

"Since you clearly know he's taken," she said, voice sharp as a blade, "what exactly are you playing at? Does it give you some sick thrill to test my patience?"

Cassandra's expression darkened, her earlier charm vanishing. Only a flicker of something unreadable remained in her gaze.

"You've got it all wrong," she protested, forcing a shaky laugh. "I would never—Preston and I were just talking. We're old classmates, that's all."

Evelyn's stare was merciless.

"Try again," she cut in. "I was the only woman in my graduating class. So tell me, where exactly did you crawl out from?"

Silence.

Cassandra had assumed that in a university as large as Stanford, no one would remember every face. Claiming to be an old classmate had seemed like the perfect cover.

"I... I must have been mistaken," she stammered. "Maybe it was another program—"

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp.

"With those crow's feet? You're pushing thirty-five. You'd have to have been held back a decade to be in my year, Ms. Blake."

Cassandra's mouth snapped shut.

She had severely underestimated Evelyn. No wonder Nathan Blackwood had failed to break her.

Wiping the wine from her lashes, Cassandra forced composure.

"Even if we weren't classmates, does that mean we can't be civil? Must you be so cruel?"

Evelyn's smirk deepened.

"Civil? With you?" She tilted her head. "You're mediocre in every way—looks, brains, ambition. What exactly makes you think you belong in my circle?"

Cassandra's jaw clenched.

Nearby, Preston Sinclair barely suppressed a laugh.

Evelyn stepped closer, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper.

"Who sent you?"

Cassandra's breath hitched.

She had come with a purpose, of course—but not one she could admit.

"I don't know what you're talking about," she said, backing away. "If you're going to treat me like this, then I have nothing left to say."

She turned to leave.

Evelyn's hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

With one sharp tug, she slammed Cassandra against the wall.

A dull thud echoed as Cassandra's skull connected with the marble. Pain flared.

"W-What are you doing?!" she choked out.

Evelyn leaned in, her grip tightening.

"I don't hit women," she murmured. "But I do make exceptions."

Her free hand smashed the wine glass against the wall.

The shatter made Cassandra flinch.

Evelyn pressed the jagged edge to her cheek.

Cassandra's pulse skyrocketed.

"Wait—Evelyn, stop! I'll tell you!"

Her career was on the line. A scarred face would ruin everything.

Evelyn's gaze was unrelenting.

"Talk."

The glass didn't move.
###Chapter 893

This was no laughing matter. If someone of Evelyn Sinclair's stature did this, countless people would willingly take the fall for her.

But Cassandra Blake's entire life would be utterly destroyed.

Cassandra's desperate gaze sought Preston Sinclair, standing nearby, silently pleading for intervention.

Preston's expression remained impassive. He showed no inclination to intervene—if anything, his demeanor bordered on indulgent amusement.

As a gentleman, Preston couldn't lay hands on a woman. Otherwise, she'd already be sporting bruises.

Watching Evelyn threaten Cassandra so openly filled him with grim satisfaction.

Cassandra clenched her teeth. She had to save herself. "Pacific Crest International—"

Her voice trembled with barely suppressed terror.

Evelyn paused, her eyes narrowing dangerously. "Nathan Blackwood?"

"N-No! I'm just an employee under Mr. Blackwood, but he didn't send me! I'm from Pacific Crest International—"

Cassandra tried to explain further, but Evelyn had already lost patience.

Grabbing Cassandra by the collar, Evelyn dragged her back without a shred of concern for her dignity.

Cassandra didn't dare resist—not with Preston watching.

As they passed through the dining area, Bennett and several colleagues were already eating.

The moment they spotted Evelyn hauling a disheveled woman past them, silence fell for several heartbeats.

Evelyn smiled sweetly, casually waving the broken wine glass still in her hand. "Don't stop on my account. Order more if you're still hungry. Bennett, play host."

Bennett nodded. "Yes, Ms. Sinclair."

Everyone blinked, then immediately pretended they'd seen nothing. Glasses clinked as forced chatter resumed.

"This restaurant is fantastic—"

"Ms. Sinclair is so generous, booking the whole place for us—"

"You have to try this dish—"

Cassandra's pleading eyes found no sympathy. Not a single person met her gaze. Now she understood what true willful ignorance looked like. Even the waitstaff averted their eyes.

The once-polished woman who'd introduced herself as Evelyn's classmate now looked utterly pitiful.

The transformation was staggering.

Evelyn hauled Cassandra into a side room and shoved her inside, then pulled out sanitizing wipes to meticulously clean her hands, wiping each slender finger with visible disgust.

Preston entered, closing the door behind him.

"Evelyn, vent your anger, but don't permanently damage her." His words inexplicably chilled the air.

Evelyn paused, studying Cassandra's trembling form. A slow smile curved her lips. "We're civilized people. I won't resort to violence."

She pulled out her phone and dialed Nathan.

Understanding dawned on Preston. He chuckled dryly—he'd misjudged her intentions.

The call connected in two rings.

Nathan sounded both confused and surprised. "Evelyn? You're calling me?"

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Cassandra's startled face as she relayed their location. "Come collect your employee."

Then she hung up.

Cassandra opened her mouth to explain, but Evelyn had already turned away, uninterested. Preston followed, shutting the door firmly behind them.

Evelyn's mood noticeably improved as she rejoined the others for lunch.

The group wisely avoided mentioning what they'd witnessed.

One by one, they finished eating and returned to work.

The moment they left, Nathan arrived.

Anticipating Evelyn's summons, Nathan had selected a crisp new shirt. His tailored suit accentuated his lean frame, his posture impeccable. With his striking features and commanding presence, he cut an imposing figure.

His eyes immediately found Evelyn. He approached—only to freeze at the sight of the man seated opposite her.

Preston Sinclair.

The man he despised most.
###Chapter 894

Nathan's icy gaze sharpened. The smirk that had been playing on his lips vanished.

"Why are you here?"

Preston smiled, his expression unreadable, his usual composed demeanor intact.

"Mr. Blackwood, after all the effort you've put in, how could I possibly miss witnessing your subordinate's performance?"

Nathan's eyes darkened, a storm brewing beneath the surface. He turned away abruptly, unwilling to let Preston see the flicker of irritation in his expression.

Preston's presence was an unwelcome complication, but Nathan refused to lose face. He fixed Evelyn with a cold stare.

"Why did you call me here?"

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before gesturing toward the room behind her.

"Take your subordinate away. Nathan Blackwood, wouldn't it be better to act with integrity? Must you resort to such underhanded tactics? It's disgusting."

Nathan's expression turned thunderous. His jaw clenched, his voice dangerously low.

"What are you talking about?"

He had been swamped lately—finalizing the merger between Pacific Crest International and Blackwood Industries left him no time to even call Evelyn.

"Pacific Crest International is yours, and Cassandra Blake is from Pacific Crest, isn't she?"

Nathan frowned, silent for a beat.

Then it clicked—Julian had mentioned Cassandra was one of the candidates for President of Pacific Crest’s Asia division.

"Yes."

Evelyn smiled, cold and mocking.

"Then there’s no mistake. You told her to provoke me and seduce Preston. I never thought you’d sink this low."

Nathan’s face darkened with fury.

He strode forward and kicked the door open. His expression twisted further when he saw Cassandra’s disheveled state inside.

"Mr. Blackwood—!" Cassandra’s voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes. "I only wanted to help you—!"

'I’ll eliminate your competition so you can have Evelyn all to yourself!'

Before she could finish, Nathan cut her off, his voice dripping with venom.

"You’re out of your damn mind."

He turned back to Evelyn, his eyes burning with barely restrained rage.

"Do whatever you want with her. She deserves it."

'Is this why Evelyn called me here? Does she really think so little of me now—that I’d stoop to this level?'

Cassandra let out a desperate cry.

"Mr. Blackwood, you have to save me! I’ve been with Pacific Crest for over a decade! Even if I haven’t achieved much, I’ve worked hard—!"

Her carefully crafted elegance shattered as she broke down, pleading.

Evelyn Sinclair. Preston Sinclair. Nathan Blackwood.

Any one of them could crush her like an insect without breaking a sweat.

Without Nathan’s protection, she was finished.

A ruthless glint flashed in Nathan’s eyes.

"You were paid for your work. Consider your employment terminated. Pacific Crest doesn’t need trash like you."

Cassandra’s face went slack with shock.

'Fired?! Right before my promotion?! At my level, no other company will match Pacific Crest’s position or salary! My career is over!'

"Mr. Blackwood—!"

Nathan ignored her, his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

He stepped closer, the intensity in his eyes overwhelming.

"Evelyn… is this really what you think of me?"
###Chapter 895

Nathan's question hung in the air like a blade. The moment it left his lips, a dull ache pierced through his chest, mixing with the simmering rage.

"One mistake from the past, and now every wrong deed gets pinned on me? Why should I bear this burden?" The thought burned through his mind.

Evelyn met his gaze with icy composure. "Your subordinate did this. Who would believe you had no part in it?"

Unless Cassandra was acting alone, desperate to please Nathan.

Unconditional trust didn't exist between them anymore.

Evelyn had trusted Nathan once - it cost her three years of pain. She wouldn't make that mistake again.

Nathan's eyes blazed with barely contained fury. Veins stood out on his forehead. Yet when facing her, he fought to keep his voice steady.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Let me make this clear. It wasn't me. I had nothing to do with this!"

The pleading in his voice cut deeper than any knife. He couldn't bear her accusatory stare.

When Evelyn noticed the redness creeping into the corners of his eyes, something unfamiliar twisted in her chest. She crushed the feeling instantly.

"Whether you're involved or not doesn't matter. She's your employee - take responsibility."

Just saying he wasn't involved changed nothing. If he weren't Nathan Blackwood, would Cassandra have dared approach her?

Nathan stared for a long moment before speaking. "Evelyn, do you enjoy hurting me this much?"

Across from them, Preston couldn't stay silent any longer. Nathan's reaction surprised him. He stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood, let's focus on the facts."

Nathan shoved Preston violently aside. His pent-up emotions exploded. "Get the hell out! Who do you think you are? You think I won't touch you?"

Evelyn rose, her eyes glinting dangerously. "He's my boyfriend. Show some respect, Nathan Blackwood."

The air froze.

Nathan's shocked gaze locked onto Evelyn. After a heavy silence, his chest heaved violently. His eyes reddened as a cold laugh tore from his throat.

"Boyfriend? So you chose him after all. No matter what I do, you'll never look back, will you?" His voice rasped with desperation.

Evelyn's lips curved into a serene smile. "Never. I told you before - whoever I choose will always be better than you."

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously.

Evelyn maintained her graceful composure. "We were married once. Since I'm seeing someone now, you should wish me well. Let's keep our interactions strictly business from now on. And keep your people away from me - next time, I won't be so lenient."

Her gentle tone made the words cut deeper.

Behind them, Cassandra realized with dawning horror that she'd accelerated the end of Nathan and Evelyn's relationship instead of removing obstacles. 'He must despise me now.'

Evelyn turned to Preston with soft eyes. "Let's go."

They left together, the picture of a perfect couple.

No one noticed Nathan's bloodshot eyes.

Cassandra approached cautiously. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm so sorry—"

"Get out!" Nathan whirled, his rage terrifying. He kicked a nearby chair with enough force to send it skidding across the floor. No one dared move closer.
###Chapter 896

The crisp winter air hit Evelyn's face as she stepped outside. The chill instantly cleared her turbulent thoughts.

She exhaled slowly, relieved. It was finally over.

If Nathan valued his reputation at all, he would back off now. No more games, no more empty promises.

A hand appeared beside her, holding out a charcoal-gray handkerchief. The faint scent of sandalwood clung to it—warm, masculine.

Evelyn looked up into Preston's silent gaze. His eyes held quiet sorrow.

Her words had been brutal. Necessary. But Preston understood the courage it took for Evelyn to sever those final ties to Nathan.

She wasn't just cutting Nathan loose—she was carving pieces of her own heart out in the process.

The realization struck Preston like a blade: she still loved him.

Gently, he brushed away tears she hadn't realized were falling.

Preston sighed. "Evelyn, if letting go hurts this much, take your time. Seeing you like this..." His voice cracked. "It breaks me."

Evelyn's eyes were still red-rimmed, but her smile returned—bright, dazzling. "I loved him for years. A year to grieve was enough. Today just... made it final. Some wounds need ripping off fast."

The slower the bandage came off, the worse it burned. She knew that agony intimately.

Preston understood her history. Evelyn's love for Nathan wasn't some fleeting crush—it had been bone-deep, all-consuming.

She'd reshaped herself for him. Compromised her pride for the Blackwood family. That knowledge twisted Preston's heart.

Post-divorce Evelyn was radiant. Confident. Alive. This was her true self, finally free.

Preston smiled, opening the car door. "Office or a detour?"

Evelyn slid in, checking her phone. No urgent messages from Alexander. "Take me to Isabella's studio?"

Preston's grin could power cities. "My pleasure."

The drive passed in comfortable silence, soft jazz filling the space between them.

Evelyn caught Preston's secret smile in the rearview mirror. "What's that look for?"

Preston held her gaze. "Want the truth?"

She rolled her eyes. "Obviously."

His voice dropped to that velvet rumble she loved. "Because I finally see my worth to you."

Evelyn blinked.

"That woman assumed I was yours—you didn't correct her. First time." He counted on his fingers. "She flirted with me, and you shut it down like a jealous girlfriend. Second time. Then you told Nathan Blackwood himself I'm your man. Three strikes."

Evelyn gaped. "I did not—"

Preston's smirk was pure sin. "Three public declarations, darling. Memory lapse?"

Heat flooded her cheeks. Damn him for remembering every detail.

In the moment, those words had been weapons—nothing more.

Preston leaned closer. "Seems you've given me permission to chase you properly."

Evelyn turned to the window, watching snow melt into glittering puddles. A smile tugged her lips. "Don't read too much into it. That was... situational."

The unspoken hung between them: But maybe not entirely.
###Chapter 897

The weight on Evelyn's shoulders lightened slightly, though the situation wasn't fully resolved yet.

Preston's lips curved into a warm smile, his gaze softening as he looked at her. "I'll be patient," he murmured.

With no other competitors in sight, he had all the time in the world to win her over.

Soft music played in the background.

Evelyn found herself relaxing more than she had in weeks during the car ride.

When they reached Isabella's office building, Preston leaped out before Evelyn could touch the door handle, opening it with a gentlemanly bow.

Evelyn laughed as she stepped out, matching his playful energy.

His eyes sparkled with mischief. "Should I pick you up later?" He was already settling comfortably into his new role as her boyfriend.

Surprisingly, it felt natural.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink. "No need. This meeting will take a while."

Preston raised an eyebrow but nodded. After a lingering glance, he forced himself to look away. "I'd love to meet your friends properly, but I suppose now isn't the time. See you soon."

"Bye," Evelyn waved, still processing how one simple lunch had shifted their dynamic.

Somehow, without realizing it, the distance between them had narrowed.

Yet the thought of officially dating still made Evelyn's pulse race.

Her phone buzzed in her bag.

Isabella's name flashed on the screen.

"I'm downstairs," Evelyn answered.

Isabella's teasing laughter came through. "I can see that from my window. Are you two done being lovebirds yet?"

The comment dissolved Evelyn's lingering tension, replacing it with embarrassment.

Evelyn glared up at the building before hanging up and marching inside.

Isabella must have witnessed Preston's chivalrous display.

Thanks to prior arrangements, the receptionist waved Evelyn through without question.

She stormed into Isabella's office, tossing her bag onto the sofa with a dramatic sigh.

"You should feel honored that I chose to visit you—"

Evelyn's words died as a man emerged from the private lounge.

Her jaw dropped.

It took a second to recognize Donovan Pierce.

Donovan barely glanced at Evelyn as he shrugged on his jacket, planted a kiss on Isabella's lips, and headed for the door.

He nodded politely as he passed Evelyn.

She stared after him, then turned to Isabella with wide eyes.

Isabella didn't look the least bit embarrassed. "Oops, forgot he was napping in there."

"You two—?" Evelyn hesitated.

"Number one-twenty in my little black book," Isabella announced proudly. "Handsome, generous, and not clingy. I might just keep this one."

Evelyn was speechless.

She'd expected Isabella to be heartbroken after Alexander chose Amelia.

Evelyn had avoided calling, fearing to reopen fresh wounds.

But judging by their familiarity, this affair had been going on for months.

Had Evelyn been mourning Isabella's heartbreak alone?

Isabella looked radiant, her usual vivacious self fully restored.

Reading Evelyn's thoughts, Isabella squeezed her hand. "Stop overthinking. Heartbreak is like getting hit by a pebble—hurts at first, then you move on. Why mourn one tree when there's a whole forest waiting?"

"You're impossible," Evelyn groaned.

Isabella winked. "Want to borrow him for a weekend?"

Evelyn recoiled. "Absolutely not!"

Something about Donovan set off warning bells—too calculating, too controlled to be led around by anyone.

Was he really smitten?

Isabella leaned closer. "So you prefer Preston Sinclair's type? Are you two official now?"

Evelyn froze.

The blunt question caught her off guard. "It's complicated."

"I saw how you couldn't tear yourselves apart downstairs. Don't lie to me."

Isabella always saw through her.

After a long pause, Evelyn confessed everything.

Even love-expert Isabella looked stumped afterward. "These aren't ordinary men playing by normal rules."

Both Preston and Nathan operated on another level entirely.
###Chapter 898

Evelyn pressed her lips together. I've already made up my mind. Nathan doesn't deserve another chance. When it comes to matters of the heart, there's no room for hesitation.

Isabella pulled her into a tight embrace. "Oh, my poor darling... If two men like that were chasing after me, I'd string them along and bleed them dry."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Could she be any less serious about this? She didn't have the skill—or the desire—to play games. Those men weren't just wealthy heirs. They were ruthless, brilliant, and ruled the corporate world. No woman could manipulate them.

She pushed Isabella away with a sigh. "I'm not as cunning as you."

The office was bathed in golden light, the sun streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows and scattering prismatic reflections across the crystal paperweight on the desk. Even the air shimmered with an ethereal glow.

The two women decided to drown their frustrations at Velvet Lounge, summoning Natalie and Olivia to join them.

Blackwood Industries

Nathan's expression was ice-cold, his sharp features carved from stone. The suffocating tension in the room made it hard to breathe.

Harrison stood silently, not daring to utter a word. But Julian Whitmore—ever the reckless one—kept talking.

"Ava didn’t mean for things to spiral like this. Who could’ve predicted Annie would be so heartless?"

With every word Julian spoke, Nathan’s jaw tightened further.

Harrison wanted to leave, but he feared a full-blown confrontation.

"It wasn’t easy for Ava to climb this high, and she’s a woman in a cutthroat industry. If you fire her, where will she go? Pacific Crest International won’t take her back. Maybe just a warning would suffice..."

Nathan’s knuckles whitened around the edge of his desk. The air turned glacial.
###Chapter 899

Nathan's piercing gaze was ice-cold, his dark eyes burning with barely contained fury.

"Let it go? After everything I've done to earn Evelyn's forgiveness, that woman had to ruin it all in one night! You expect me to just forget this?" Nathan's voice dripped with venom, his usual composure shattered.

His lips curled in disdain as he studied Julian. "This is the brilliant candidate you recommended for Pacific Crest International's Asia division? Pathetic."

The temperature in the room plummeted. "What did she promise you to make you defend her so fiercely? That incompetent fool has no business leading our Asian operations!" Nathan's knuckles turned white against his desk. "I didn't appoint you Vice President to install your mistress in key positions!"

Julian's face drained of color.

Their affair had been carefully hidden - no public interactions, with Julian maintaining closer ties to the other candidate, Nathaniel Graves.

How had Nathan discovered the truth?

The realization hit Julian like a physical blow. He'd grown complacent, believing himself indispensable. But Pacific Crest International had cycled through countless vice presidents before him.

As Julian opened his mouth to deny the allegations, Nathan cut him off with a glacial stare. "Do your job. Get out."

The unspoken message was clear - Pacific Crest belonged to Nathan Blackwood, and no one else. Julian's authority extended only as far as Nathan permitted.

Outside, Cassandra Blake remained slumped against the wall, her designer dress still stained with wine, hair matted against her tear-streaked face. "Mr. Whitmore? What did he say? Did you—"

"Save yourself while you can." Julian brushed past without a backward glance, his polished Oxfords clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Self-preservation had always been his strongest instinct. No woman was worth sacrificing his career.

Cassandra's sobs echoed through the corridor until Harrison emerged moments later.

"Mr. Blackwood is allowing you to resign voluntarily," Harrison stated coolly. "Consider it a professional courtesy after your years of service."

"This is ridiculous! It was just a misunderstanding—I'll apologize to Evelyn myself!" Cassandra scrambled to her feet.

Harrison's expression remained impassive. "Ms. Blake, you arrived in Montecito and immediately provoked Ms. Sinclair without understanding the dynamics. Did you truly believe this would end well for you?"

The color drained from Cassandra's face.

"You miscalculated," Harrison continued. "You assumed your value to Pacific Crest outweighed Ms. Sinclair's importance to Mr. Blackwood."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms.

That exact arrogance had blinded her. She'd never imagined Nathan would choose a woman over business interests.

Harrison adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. "Many have made the same mistake. But to Mr. Blackwood, not even Pacific Crest and Blackwood Industries combined hold a candle to Evelyn Sinclair. Resign now, while you still can. Unless you'd prefer to learn firsthand how ruthless he can be when truly angered."

The threat hung in the air between them, heavier than the expensive perfume still clinging to Cassandra's ruined dress.
###Chapter 900

Evelyn's face paled instantly.

Harrison had witnessed countless situations while working for Nathan. His words carried undeniable truth.

Did I just sabotage my own future? Dazed, Evelyn turned and walked away in a trance.

Harrison immediately contacted the security team downstairs.

"Keep an eye on that woman. Ensure nothing happens near Blackwood Industries. Once she leaves our premises, she's no longer our concern."

As a meticulous assistant, Harrison always prepared for every possible scenario.

Loose ends had to be tied neatly.

He thought bitterly, Mr. Blackwood sacrificed everything for Evelyn—even defying his own family—only to lose her in the end.

Evelyn, now indifferent to Nathan, proved far stronger than anyone anticipated.

As soon as Evelyn stepped outside, she spotted her rival, Nathaniel Graves, approaching with a triumphant grin.

He even waved enthusiastically at her.

"Evelyn! Always one step ahead, aren't you? Didn't expect you to leave the company first. Best of luck in your future endeavors—"

Evelyn's expression froze.

Nathaniel smirked and strode past her into the building. If not for Evelyn's self-destruction, this position would have been hers.

Harrison returned to Nathan's office, where the dim lighting accentuated the sharp angles of his cold, handsome face.

"Sir, Nathaniel Graves has arrived."

Nathan's voice was icy. "Hand him the documents and send him straight to his new post."

Meaning: I don’t want to see him.

Harrison nodded, retrieving the Pacific Crest International contract before heading to the door.

Once Nathaniel was gone, Nathan canceled all his afternoon engagements. He wanted no visitors.

Only when Tristan Whitmore boldly invited him for drinks did Harrison finally exhale in relief.

Meanwhile, Donovan and Natalie arrived just as Evelyn and Isabella emerged from Velvet Lounge.

The four decided on a spontaneous road trip.

A meteor shower was predicted for that night.

It had been ages since they’d acted on impulse.

Donovan volunteered to gather camping gear. His off-road vehicle, long neglected, finally had a purpose.

Isabella suggested a mountain outside New York City—perfect for stargazing.

Evelyn agreed without hesitation. Donovan wasted no time hitting the road.

Natalie fidgeted nervously. "Is this safe? Feels like rain’s coming."

Isabella scoffed. "Relax. There are four of us—what could go wrong? Besides, the forecast said clear skies."

Evelyn reached for her phone to update her family—then frowned.

No signal.

She turned to Natalie. "Can I borrow yours?"

Natalie handed it over silently. Evelyn checked—same issue.

"Nothing. Can’t even make a call." She returned the phone.

Donovan grinned, offering the car’s satellite phone. "Don’t worry. I came prepared."

Evelyn almost smiled—until she pressed the power button.

"Dead battery, Donovan. When was the last time you charged this?"

Three pairs of furious eyes locked onto him.

Just as Isabella opened her mouth to scold him, Evelyn gasped.

"It’s raining!"

They all turned. Fat raindrops pelted the windows.

Isabella snapped, "What are you waiting for? Turn around! No meteor shower in this weather—"

The engine sputtered.

Then died.
###Chapter 901

The silence inside the car made the pounding rain outside sound even louder.

Evelyn Sinclair stared hopelessly at the water cascading down the windows. "Why did I agree to come with them? Could this situation get any worse?"

Natalie Beaumont glared at her with narrowed eyes, her crimson nails tapping impatiently against the dashboard. "If I wasn't such a refined lady, I'd have murdered you and left your body in a ditch by now!"

Isabella Montgomery nodded vigorously in agreement. "Absolutely!"

Sebastian Hart's lips twitched as he glanced at Evelyn. "At least you're still treating me decently."

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "I'll make sure to bring your favorite flowers to your funeral."

As minutes ticked by, the temperature inside the vehicle continued dropping.

No one's phone worked - no service, no signal. Their only options were waiting for help or venturing out into the storm.

The downpour lasted hours, finally stopping as darkness fully enveloped them.

Tension hung thick in the air. Isabella had exhausted herself berating Sebastian earlier, while Natalie now slumped listlessly against her window.

Sebastian stepped outside briefly to search for signal, returning empty-handed. The eerie silence outside felt oppressive.

An unnatural cold seeped into their bones, making them feel like the last people on earth. Isabella shivered violently, clutching her shoulders. "We're not seriously going to freeze to death out here, are we?"

Natalie kept redialing frantically, her face twisting with growing panic as each attempt failed.

The remaining warmth in the car dissipated rapidly, ratcheting up everyone's anxiety.

"We should walk for help," Evelyn suggested through chattering teeth.

Isabella shook her head violently. "We'd die of hypothermia before finding anyone!"

Sebastian returned moments later, shoulders slumped. "No signal. This mountain's practically deserted. Our only hope is someone passing by..."

Evelyn gave him a skeptical look. "Who exactly do you expect to come driving through here at night? And even if someone does, would they actually help us?"

Kind strangers existed, but Evelyn doubted their luck would hold tonight.

Sebastian swallowed hard, knowing his poor planning had led them to this terrifying predicament. He took a deep breath before announcing dramatically, "To make it up to you all, I'm willing to sacrifice myself!"

Evelyn and Isabella stared blankly while Natalie remained stone-faced in the front seat. Sebastian continued, "I'll sit in back and keep you ladies warm with my body heat!"

"Get lost!"

All three women rejected his offer simultaneously.

Sebastian's door clicked shut as his hopeful expression crumpled into disappointment. He'd meant well!

Their conversation dwindled to sporadic, half-hearted remarks as time crawled by.

9:00 PM.

The consuming darkness outside seemed capable of swallowing them whole.

Damp, frigid air continued invading the car until rain began falling again, pattering ominously against the roof.

Though terrified, everyone maintained façades of calm, refusing to voice their darkest thoughts.

Isabella trembled against Evelyn's shoulder, her face ghostly pale from the cold. Nobody fared better. No lights shone in the impenetrable blackness outside.

Then Natalie voiced everyone's unspoken fear: "There was a massive mudslide here years ago. With this much rain..."

The others instantly stiffened, hearts pounding.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line, her frozen fingertips nearly numb. If this continued, hypothermia would claim them before morning.

A deafening roar suddenly shattered the night - not thunder, but something far more terrifying. The sound seemed to originate from the mountain's core, vibrating through their bones.

"You cursed us! It's happening!" Isabella shrieked.

Sebastian shouted over the chaos, "Out of the car! Run!"
###Chapter 902

Fear paralyzed everyone's ability to distinguish reality from illusion. This was no laughing matter.

Car doors flew open as they scrambled out.

Thankfully, Evelyn and Natalie had worn practical shoes.

Isabella Montgomery, ever the fashionista, had stubbornly refused to sacrifice style for practicality. Even in a mudslide, she'd face disaster in stilettos.

Her impractical footwear now hindered their escape.

Natalie's face turned ghostly pale.

"Sebastian, take Natalie! I've got Isabella!" Evelyn shouted. "No time to argue - just run!"

"Evelyn, keep up!" Natalie's voice trembled.

Gritting her teeth, Natalie sprinted ahead with Sebastian.

Their disaster preparedness training dictated running perpendicular to the mudslide's path. But complete darkness swallowed everything.

Phone flashlights provided pitiful illumination against the consuming blackness.

Blind and desperate, they could only flee in the opposite direction.

Freezing rain lashed their faces like shards of glass.

Isabella clutched Evelyn's hand, sobbing as they ran. Her mind had gone blank with terror.

The ominous rumble of approaching debris grew louder.

It promised to obliterate all warmth, all hope.

Evelyn saw nothing. Heard nothing beyond the storm.

Isabella's tears mixed with rain as Evelyn dragged her forward, but the designer heels kept slowing them down.

Drenched. Frozen. Terrified.

With a frustrated cry, Isabella kicked off her shoes. "I'm sorry, Evie," she gasped, gripping Evelyn's hand tighter.

"Don't apologize," Evelyn panted. "Sebastian and Natalie are just ahead. We'll catch them!"

But the deafening roar behind them intensified. Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat.

Natalie's warning sliced through the storm: "Faster! It's gaining!"

The icy rain stung like needles. Evelyn tightened her grip on Isabella's hand.

Their slowing pace made the approaching destruction sound even more horrifying.

Evelyn had excellent stamina, but Isabella's exhaustion dragged them both down. Still, Evelyn refused to let go.

Losing her best friend wasn't an option.

Not after already losing the man she loved.

Isabella's breathing grew ragged. "Leave me, Evie. Save yourself!"

"Never." Evelyn's grip turned vice-like.

Amidst the howling wind, Isabella's choked sobs stood out starkly.

Evelyn focused solely on moving forward when - CRACK! Her foot caught on a rock.

White-hot pain shot through her ankle. She heard rather than felt the bone snap.

Then - impact. Her skull connected with frozen earth.

Darkness swallowed her consciousness.

Isabella's scream echoed strangely - both distant and immediate.

What cruel irony. Was this her punishment for seeking revenge against Nathan?

Warmth trickled down Evelyn's forehead. Blood? Hers? Someone else's?

The world faded to black.
###Chapter 903

The first rays of dawn sliced through the darkness, painting the sky in hues of gold.

Evelyn Sinclair's eyes stung from the sudden brightness, but her mind still lingered in that terrifying night. The storm had been relentless—behind them, a mudslide threatened to swallow them whole, while the road ahead seemed endless.

She had run until her muscles screamed. Every nerve in her body was taut with fear.

Then, in an instant, the ground beneath her vanished.

Her foot met empty air.

Weightlessness seized her.

And she jolted awake.

Cold sweat trickled down her temple.

It took several slow blinks before Evelyn fully registered her surroundings.

None of it was familiar.

A dull ache pulsed in her skull. When she reached up, her fingers brushed against thick bandages.

Nearby, the flicker of a lighter caught her attention.

A tall, broad-shouldered figure stood silhouetted against the dim light.

For a second, she thought it was Preston.

But that was impossible.

Wasn’t it?

Her vision sharpened. Preston Sinclair stood there, a lighter in one hand, a candle in the other.

Evelyn frowned.

Her voice came out hoarse. "What are you doing?"

A terrible thought struck her.

Was he lighting a candle for me? Am I dead?

The idea sent a chill down her spine, draining what little color remained in her face.

She blinked rapidly, trying to discern reality from illusion.

Preston stiffened.

Then he turned.

His dark eyes locked onto hers—overflowing with tenderness, relief, and something deeper.

He moved toward her, his gaze tracing every inch of her face as if she might shatter at the slightest touch.

Like she was something precious.

Evelyn stared back, confused.

Preston’s jaw tightened. His voice was rough when he finally spoke. "Do you remember who I am?"

She tilted her head. "Do we know each other?"

His face went pale.

Evelyn had only meant to tease him. She hadn’t expected such a visceral reaction.

Before she could explain, the door burst open.

Sebastian Hart strode in, followed by Natalie Beaumont and Isabella Montgomery. The moment Isabella saw Evelyn awake, she lunged forward.

"Eve! You're finally awake! You scared me half to death—"

Her hands barely grazed Evelyn’s shoulders before Preston yanked her back.

His voice was clipped. "She has a concussion. Don’t jostle her."

Isabella’s eyes instantly welled up. "This is all my fault! If I’d been faster—"

Natalie squeezed her shoulder. "She’s awake now. That’s all that matters." Then, with a dramatic sniff, she turned to Evelyn. "Please tell me you haven’t forgotten me, darling. I couldn’t bear it."

Evelyn smirked. "Sebastian, you still owe me two grand."

Sebastian groaned.

His attempt at emotional manipulation had failed spectacularly.

None of them noticed the way Preston flinched.

He hadn’t told them yet—that Evelyn had forgotten him.

But she remembered her friends.

His chest tightened.

Then Evelyn turned to him, her lips curving into a soft smile. Warmth flickered in her eyes.

"Mr. Sinclair, I’m sorry for teasing you earlier."

Preston’s expression shifted—relief warring with something darker.

Without a word, he turned and walked out.

Angry.

Evelyn blinked after him, startled by his reaction. But Isabella quickly distracted her.

"What did you do to scare him like that?"

"I pretended I didn’t remember him."

Natalie rolled her eyes. "Cliché."

Sebastian huffed. "And yet you still remember the money I owe you."

Evelyn laughed—then winced as a sharp pain lanced through her skull. A sudden realization struck her.

"Wait… the mudslide. How did we get out?"
###Chapter 904

Isabella Montgomery spoke first. "There was a mudslide, but we were fortunate. It didn't head toward our escape route."

Evelyn Sinclair thought, 'Thank God! What incredible luck!'

"It was too close for comfort," Natalie Beaumont added. "If Preston Sinclair hadn't arrived when he did, we wouldn't have made it once the mudslide spread."

Isabella nodded vigorously. "I always assumed Preston was cold and calculating beneath that polished exterior. How wrong I was. When you collapsed, Evelyn, I nearly lost my mind with fear. Then he appeared like some dark knight. He knew the storm was coming yet still raced after you, terrified you'd get caught in the mudslide. Honestly, it's been years since a man moved me this deeply."

Natalie flicked Isabella's forehead with her finger.

"Really? Now's the time for romantic fantasies?"

Rubbing her forehead, Isabella plopped down beside Evelyn's hospital bed. "Regardless, that man risked his life for you. I'd say he's completely irreplaceable!"

Evelyn's chest constricted.

As her friends spoke, Evelyn recalled the moment she'd opened her eyes to Preston's silhouette. How had he found them? What drove him to speed through that storm alone? The image of him navigating those treacherous roads in pounding rain sent shivers down her spine.

'What if he'd missed us?' Evelyn wondered. 'What if the mudslide had taken him too?' Each scenario meant Preston had gambled his life for hers. No wonder he'd reacted so intensely when she'd pretended to lose her memory. 'How devastated would he be if I truly forgot him?'

Natalie cut through the tension. "Enough speculation. We're still trapped in this village. The roads are blocked - no rescuers can reach us, and we can't leave either." Evelyn pressed her lips together, scanning the rundown hospital room. "That explains these conditions..."

This rural clinic was a far cry from Manhattan's private hospitals. Yet compared to last night's ordeal, it felt like paradise.

Isabella chimed in, "Preston didn't even consider the return trip when he came for you. Doesn't that make you want to pledge your eternal devotion?" The words pricked Evelyn's heart, though her pale face betrayed nothing.

She met Isabella's gaze evenly. "Does it move you?"

Isabella looked ready to shake sense into Evelyn. "I'm merely appreciating the gesture! He came for you, you impossible woman!"

Natalie remained the voice of reason. "Let's not get carried away. She's freshly divorced - hardly ready to dive back into romance. Caution is wise."

Isabella considered this. The wounds from Evelyn's failed marriage still looked raw enough to make bystanders wince.

Sebastian Hart, who'd been quietly observing, finally spoke up. "Remember how you all championed Nathan Blackwood before?"

"Shut up!" The three women snapped in unison. Even Evelyn shot him a glare that made her dizzy.

Regaining composure, Evelyn asked, "Did anyone contact our families? My father and brothers don't know I left the city..."

Natalie nodded. "Alexander called nonstop. I updated him. He tracked your watch's location but hit the roadblocks. He was relieved to hear you're safe and promised to come as soon as possible."

Evelyn exhaled. Good.

Sebastian added grimly, "That mudslide wiped out an entire village. Over a hundred people are still missing. We got incredibly lucky."
###Chapter 905

The air grew still.

Yes, they had nearly perished.

After what felt like an eternity, another knock sounded at the door.

Preston Sinclair regained his composed demeanor. "May I come in?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Isabella Montgomery gracefully surrendered her seat, flashing Evelyn a knowing look that Preston didn't miss.

His eyes sparkled with barely contained delight. Evelyn averted her gaze, pressing fingers to her temple.

She desperately wished to disown this meddlesome friend.

Natalie Beaumont rolled her eyes in exasperation. What kind of friend was this?

Sebastian Hart cleared his throat. "It's getting late. I should inform the others we're safe."

Natalie followed suit.

Isabella hesitated, torn between staying and intruding, before finally trailing after them.

Preston stood motionless, two eggs cradled in his elegant hands. His slender fingers hesitated momentarily before gently tapping them against the bedside table.

Every movement flowed with effortless grace.

Those aristocratic hands holding steaming eggs created an oddly comforting scene.

"The facilities here are limited, but I procured these from the neighboring physician. At least they're nutritious..."

Evelyn blinked, recalling Isabella's earlier words. Her pulse quickened slightly.

'I shouldn't have deceived you... shouldn't have frightened you...'

Preston's lips curved upward. His refined presence seemed incongruous in the humble setting.

His voice softened to a velvety murmur. "Consider yourself forgiven - given your condition." He began peeling the eggs with meticulous care, masking his unfamiliarity with the task. How could he possibly chastise her?

Her survival alone was miraculous. Finding her had been nothing short of divine intervention.

The silence stretched uncomfortably.

Evelyn broke it first. "Is this the village clinic?"

Preston's lips twitched. His eyes shimmered with amusement as he chuckled.

"No, this is the animal hospital."

Evelyn's smile froze. Her gaze darted involuntarily to the IV drip.

Preston's rich laughter filled the room, his expression tender.

As if reading her thoughts, he reassured, "The medication is perfectly human-grade." His radiant smile left Evelyn momentarily breathless.

Time seemed suspended as their eyes locked. Preston's smile gradually faded, his gaze darkening. His warm breath carried his distinctive cologne as he leaned closer.

Evelyn held her breath unconsciously.

But he stopped mere inches away, instead reaching to tuck a stray lock behind her ear.

The gesture was feather-light. "Thank heaven you're safe, Evelyn."

The alternative didn't bear contemplation.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "Why did you come?"

She'd expected no rescuers - certainly not Preston.

Their connection had begun as purely transactional - corporate allies at best.

Even her past heroics saving Oliver Sinclair on European streets had been, in her mind, merely business reciprocity.

She'd felt no guilt securing projects through Preston.

Opportunity met capability - simple economics.

His subsequent emotional investment had caught her off guard.

Until now, she'd never truly believed in Preston's sincerity.
###Chapter 906

Evelyn Sinclair hesitated this time.

If Preston Sinclair saving her during the car accident in Sandford was just a coincidence, then what about now?

He could have stayed away. Why did he come?

His arrival was like a beacon cutting through the storm, pulling her back from the edge. The silence between them stretched for seconds.

Preston finally spoke, his voice smooth and steady.

"Yesterday was my birthday. I wanted to have dinner with you. Maybe even a late-night snack if we got lucky."

His gaze was unbearably tender. A slow smile curved his lips when he saw Evelyn’s stunned expression.

"I couldn’t find you, but I refused to give up. Isabella Montgomery’s staff said you went to a bar. The bartender told me you left with Sebastian Hart. His housekeeper said you both came up here to watch the meteor shower..."

His brow furrowed slightly, frustration flickering across his face before he chuckled.

"At first, I almost gave up. Then I checked the weather forecast—no meteor shower, just heavy rain and mudslide warnings. I called you. No answer. So I came myself."

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it. A simple thank you felt hollow. Insufficient.

Preston had retraced every step she took. Knowing the danger, he still came without hesitation.

A sharp ache pressed behind her ribs. Her throat tightened.

Preston was pouring everything into this one-sided pursuit, while she kept him at arm’s length.

His devotion was so raw it reminded her of her own past self.

Something thin and sharp twisted in her chest, squeezing until it hurt to breathe.

She met his eyes, lips pressed tight. "Preston... why are you so good to me?"

From the start, she had never given him hope.

So why did he still love her?

Preston paused. Then his mouth curved into that warm, knowing smile.

"Does love need a reason?"

"At first, I thought it was because of Oliver," Evelyn admitted.

Preston’s lashes lowered briefly before he looked up, amused. "Did I really give off that impression? If you need a reason... it was that first day at the hotel. That unshakable pride of yours, the way you refused to compromise. And when I learned about your past, it broke my heart."

When had he started loving her? Even Preston couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment.

But the deeper he fell, the more certain he became—he was in too deep to walk away.

That was why, even against Nathan Blackwood, he wouldn’t back down.

Unless Evelyn herself rejected him, he wouldn’t stop.

Her lashes fluttered. A faint gloss shimmered over her eyes, though her expression remained composed.

Inside, though, everything was shaking.

After a long silence, she finally spoke. "Preston... loving someone is hard. Especially when their heart belonged to someone else first."

It was a cruel feeling. A man like Preston didn’t deserve that pain.

His hand settled over hers—the first time he’d ever touched her without permission.

Evelyn tensed slightly but didn’t pull away. She just watched him, waiting.
###Chapter 907

Preston's grip was firm yet gentle, enveloping Evelyn's slender fingers that still carried the chill of winter. His dark eyes burned with quiet resolve.

"I want to try, Evelyn. I want to erase every shadow of your past and replace it with light. I want to see you unshaken, untouchable—just like the woman I first met."

His voice softened. "Even if it's difficult, every moment with you is worth it."

At the very least, he could be the warmth that thawed the ice around her heart.

Winter still clung to the air, but the sun had begun its slow victory, casting golden streaks across the room.

Evelyn felt it—the quiet, persistent heat of Preston's devotion.

Maybe she should have let go of the past long ago.

Maybe happiness had been standing right in front of her all this time, waiting for her to stop looking back.

The weight in her chest lifted, just a fraction.

"Why keep suffering for Nathan? Why let him dictate my life?"

Preston saw the hesitation flicker in her eyes and mistook it for regret. His fingers tensed, ready to pull away—

But Evelyn caught his hand before he could.

He froze, stunned.

A faint smile touched her lips, still edged with uncertainty.

"Disappoint me, and I'll drop you without a second thought."

She was still Evelyn Sinclair, after all. Even in surrender, she refused to be anything less than formidable.

Her earlier promise—giving him a chance—had been nothing but an excuse.

But this? This was real.

Starting over wasn't as terrifying as she'd imagined.

Preston went rigid. For a heartbeat, he didn't react.

Then—joy exploded across his face. His usual composure shattered into pure, unfiltered elation.

His grip tightened, fingers lacing with hers as if afraid she'd vanish. His voice was rough with disbelief. "Wait—does this mean... you're saying yes?"

Evelyn almost laughed at the sheer disbelief in his eyes.

But the raw hope there stopped her.

That cautious, fragile hope—it hurt more than she expected.

She held his gaze and nodded.

Preston's breath hitched.

Then, abruptly, he stood.

Evelyn blinked.

He ran a hand through his hair, grinning like a man who'd just won the world. "I—I need a minute."

And then he was gone.

Evelyn stared at the empty space where he'd been.

"...That's not how this usually goes on TV."

Shouldn't he have swept her into some grand, dramatic embrace?

Not that she would have protested.

Men were incomprehensible.

The door burst open moments later, revealing Isabella and Natalie, their expressions alight with mischief.

Isabella smirked. "Preston just walked past us grinning like an idiot. Care to explain?"

Natalie folded her arms. "Did you finally put him out of his misery?"

Evelyn sighed.

These two were worse than tabloid reporters.

"Why ask when you already know the answer?"

Isabella's grin widened. "Because watching you squirm is half the fun."

Natalie winked. "The other half is teasing Preston mercilessly."

Evelyn rolled her eyes—but she couldn't quite suppress her own smile.
###Chapter 908

Isabella rushed over and plopped down like an eager student. "Stop teasing us and spill it already!"

Evelyn took a deliberate pause before answering.

"There's not much I can offer him in return, so I'm giving him my heart instead."

The words hit like a pebble tossed into still water—ripples of shock spread instantly.

Isabella looked more thrilled than Evelyn herself. "We had a bet earlier! I swore you'd hand over Sterling Enterprises before you'd ever give yourself to him. What were you thinking?!"

Evelyn glanced at Natalie, who simply smiled back, serene and knowing. Then she turned to Isabella. "What exactly did you bet?"

Isabella groaned. "That you'd never surrender to him, but Natalie guessed you would. I told her she'd lose!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Sorry, but you lost."

Isabella rolled her eyes, torn between irritation and delight. Everyone shot down my idea when I suggested it earlier! Why does it come true the second I doubt it?

Natalie settled beside them, her expression warm with genuine happiness. "It's a fresh start, Ev. He's a good man. You've got excellent taste."

Evelyn nodded, her gaze drifting to the window where Preston was enthusiastically sharing the news with Sebastian.

Sebastian, still reeling, had covered his ears in protest—but reality couldn't be ignored. The sight made Evelyn chuckle.

Soon, Isabella and Natalie couldn't take it anymore and went to rescue Sebastian, while Preston strode back inside, his smile radiant. His composure had returned, but his eyes burned with tenderness. "I've adjusted to this new role. As your boyfriend, you can ask me for anything."

Evelyn arched a brow. That was fast. I expected at least a few days of awkwardness. "I want to go home as soon as possible. Can you make that happen, boyfriend?"

Preston hesitated. "It's not impossible, but it'll take time."

He moved closer, fingers twitching as if to brush her hair—then changed course, capturing her hand instead.

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his gaze head-on. Preston didn't flinch. His eyes held hers, unashamed. "You're my girlfriend now. That means I can hold your hand openly. And also—" His voice dipped lower, rougher. "Kiss you."

The storm had passed, leaving the sky clear and the sun blazing. The air itself felt warmer, charged.

Evelyn studied his striking features, listening to that deep, gravelly voice, and suddenly her cheeks burned. I was the one who agreed to this. So why does he suddenly have the upper hand?

Then, without warning, his palm cradled the back of her head, his face closing in.

The scent of him—warm, intoxicating—flooded her senses.

Evelyn froze, but then caught herself. Isn’t this normal for couples?

Yet his lips never touched hers. Instead, she found herself staring at his face, close enough to feel the tension in his breath.

Preston was holding back. Afraid one wrong move would ruin everything.

He loved her too much to risk seeing even a flicker of discomfort in her eyes.

But there was none.

His thumb traced the curve of her bottom lip, his voice a rough whisper. "May I?"

All he wanted was to kiss her—an obsession finally within reach, yet he was paralyzed by it.

Evelyn almost scoffed. If you want to kiss me, just do it. Why the hesitation?

It had been too long since she’d paid attention to men. Now, she had no clue what went on in their minds.
###Chapter 909

Preston's gaze burned into Evelyn with such intensity that her cheeks flushed crimson. Her pulse quickened beneath his scrutiny.

Evelyn bit her lower lip, struggling to maintain composure. Without warning, she shoved him away with both hands.

"You can't," she protested.

Did he honestly expect her to cheerfully consent to such a proposition? Preston's infuriating chivalry was both exasperating and endearing.

The moment the words left her mouth, Preston's expression darkened visibly. His Adam's apple bobbed as if swallowing bitter disappointment. The smoldering heat in his eyes extinguished instantly.

Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs.

Preston lowered his lashes and began retreating.

Then, in a sudden reversal, Evelyn seized his collar and yanked him forward.

Preston froze in surprise. Before he could react, Evelyn closed the distance between them.

Her lips barely grazed his before she pushed him away again.

"But I can," she declared.

Preston's entire demeanor transformed. His eyes sparkled with renewed intensity as he murmured, "Of course you can. You're entitled to do anything you please with your boyfriend."

Evelyn hadn't rejected him. She wasn't retreating.

When their eyes met again, understanding dawned on Preston. He reached out to tuck a stray lock behind her ear, smiling gently.

"It's alright. We'll take this at your pace, Evelyn. I'll give you all the time you need."

Evelyn returned his smile, but before she could respond, her phone chimed.

Preston handed it to her. The caller ID displayed Alexander Sterling. Without asking Preston to leave, she answered. "Big brother?"

After a brief exchange, Evelyn ended the call and blinked in surprise. "Alexander's coming to collect us."

Knowing William Sterling's temperament, no obstacle would deter him when his precious daughter was involved.

Mudslides? Blocked roads? Mere inconveniences.

Upon hearing about Evelyn's sprained ankle, William had immediately dispatched Alexander to retrieve her.

Preston looked genuinely perplexed as he stated the obvious.

"The roads are completely impassable. The only descent route is blocked. Rescue vehicles can't reach us - they'd have to hike up. I've already funded extensive repairs, but clearing the debris will take at least two more days. Is Alexander...?"

"Is Alexander planning to climb the mountain?" Preston wondered aloud.

Evelyn chuckled, about to explain, when the door burst open. Isabella bounded inside.

"Evelyn! We're leaving! Donovan just called - he's arranged a special rescue vehicle that can navigate the terrain. We'll need to transfer to a crane midway, but we're finally escaping this nightmare!"

Evelyn waved her phone. "What timing! My brother just informed me he's sending transportation."

Isabella's eyebrows shot up. "How's he managing that?"

Evelyn answered calmly, "By helicopter. Estimated arrival in twenty minutes. We should prepare."

Isabella's jaw dropped. She'd momentarily forgotten how the typically understated Sterling family abandoned all pretense of restraint when Evelyn was involved.

Donovan's half-day logistical solution had just been rendered obsolete by a single helicopter.

Beside them, Preston registered momentary surprise before accepting this development with quiet resignation. His generous road repair donations would now serve as mere charitable contributions.

Isabella nodded, thoroughly seduced by the helicopter proposition. "I'll tell Donovan to stand down. The perks of wealth..."

It wasn't that her family lacked resources, but they considered such extravagance unnecessary for minor inconveniences.

Donovan likely shared this pragmatic outlook.

The Sterling family operated under different principles.

Had Evelyn requested a helicopter simply for sightseeing, they would have praised her refined tastes - provided she didn't find their enthusiasm bothersome.
###Chapter 910

The terrain was unforgiving here, with no modern conveniences in sight.

Not even a wheelchair could be found.

Evelyn had twisted her ankle and needed support, but crutches were nowhere to be found.

Sebastian, ever the resourceful one, proudly presented her with a hand-carved wooden stick.

He even strutted around her with it, grinning.

"Perfect fit. I’m practically a master craftsman. You should really reconsider your choice in men."

Preston’s eyebrow twitched. "He dares flirt with Evelyn right in front of me?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Don’t insult actual craftsmen. I’ll use this to beat you senseless."

The stick was flimsy—if she swung it, she’d probably break her other foot.

Sebastian smirked. "You can barely walk, and you think you can hit me?"

Natalie, watching from the sidelines, wisely kept silent as Sebastian dug his own grave.

Preston’s voice was calm but edged with warning. "Her boyfriend can do it for her."

Sebastian froze, then let out a sharp laugh. "So what if he’s her boyfriend? Preston cut in line to get here!"

Evelyn turned to Preston, amused. "Do you have some kind of vendetta against him?"

Preston adjusted his collar, his expression serious. "He was flirting with you."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh, and Natalie joined in.

"Mr. Sinclair, your jealousy is showing. What Sebastian’s doing isn’t flirting—it’s called courting disaster!"

Evelyn nodded. Sebastian wasn’t even a blip on her romantic radar.

He was like Natalie and Isabella—friends for life.

Preston exhaled, visibly relieved. His lips curved into a smirk as he leaned closer.

"I know. But if he gets too close, what’s left for me?" His tone dripped with smug satisfaction.

Evelyn stared at the warmth in his eyes, momentarily dazed.

Since when had Preston’s smile been this dangerously hypnotic?

Natalie clicked her tongue, shattering the moment.

Preston stepped back, while Evelyn’s cheeks burned.

Less than twenty minutes later, the distant roar of a helicopter grew louder.

Natalie handed Evelyn over to Preston.

Evelyn tried to hobble forward on her own, but Preston didn’t budge.

She shot him a look. "Preston, give me a hand—"

Otherwise, she’d have to wait for Alexander to carry her.

But she wasn’t that patient.

Preston hesitated, then sat beside her, his expression unreadable.

"That’s not the right way to ask."

"Huh?"

In one smooth motion, he scooped her up, arms secure beneath her knees and back.

He gazed down at her.

"You should’ve asked me to carry you."

Evelyn was speechless.

Preston carried her effortlessly, as if she were something precious.

The winter sun was warm, but a chill lingered in the air.

The moment they stepped outside, Evelyn shivered.

Preston tightened his hold.

The helicopter’s deafening roar grew louder as they approached.

Sebastian had already boarded impatiently, but Isabella was nowhere in sight.

Just as Evelyn was about to ask, Isabella’s voice rang out behind them.

Evelyn turned to see her best friend waving frantically, mouth moving.

But the helicopter’s noise drowned her out.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What’s she saying? Why isn’t she coming?"
###Chapter 911

Preston arched an eyebrow. "Isabella mentioned Donovan is coming to get her. She wants to give him this chance."

His voice held amusement as he continued, "So she told us not to wait and to go ahead."

Evelyn's lips parted in surprise. "That's not like her at all!"

Isabella played the field but never let any man into her heart.

She kept them all at arm's length. The only one who'd ever touched her soul, Gregory, had met an untimely end. Why this sudden interest in Donovan?

Was she actually serious about him?

Preston chuckled. "Love changes people."

The deep rumble of his voice made Evelyn's pulse quicken.

"Are you implying you've changed too?" she countered.

Preston's eyes darkened as he glanced down at her while walking effortlessly.

"Clever girl. You always catch the subtle things."

Evelyn hesitated. "Now I'm curious. What were you like before, Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston stiffened momentarily, his voice turning rough. "You'll find out soon enough."

He longed to lay his entire world at her feet.

But he feared it might overwhelm her. Scare her away.

So he'd take it slow.

Alexander remained motionless as Preston carried Evelyn toward the helicopter, though his expression grew complicated.

Sebastian had already shared the latest developments, so Alexander knew Evelyn and Preston's relationship had shifted dramatically overnight.

No wonder Sebastian, who'd been determined to win Evelyn's affection, hadn't even gotten a chance to make his move.

Preston reached the helicopter and gave Alexander a slight nod.

Alexander returned the gesture, approaching with a stormy expression.

"Watching meteor showers in the mountains during a storm?" His voice dripped with disapproval.

Evelyn bit her lip sheepishly. Alexander was far stricter than William.

"Blame Sebastian for not checking the weather forecast!"

Alexander's smile turned icy. "So you decided to turn off your brain too?"

Evelyn gave him pleading eyes. "I'm an injured patient now!"

Alexander's gaze dropped to her bandaged feet. Concern and anger warred across his features.

Preston interjected smoothly, "Your concern is understandable, Mr. Sterling. But every cloud has a silver lining. Ms. Sterling has had all night to reflect. We should get her medical attention immediately. The tendon appears damaged—"

"Tendon injury?" Alexander paled. That was serious.

Evelyn glanced at Preston, who gave her a knowing smile.

Alexander was her eldest brother—his lecturing came with the territory. No one could stop that.

Preston simply redirected his focus.

It worked perfectly.

At the mention of tendon damage, Alexander immediately reached for Evelyn, then hesitated, afraid of hurting her.

With a frustrated sigh, he told Preston, "Please carry her aboard, Mr. Sinclair. There's a doctor inside."

Preston nodded and carefully ascended the steps.

Wind whipped around them as the helicopter's blades began spinning.

Alexander followed moments later.

"Dr. Whitmore, I'm counting on you."

The elderly hospital director had been enjoying tea with William when Alexander dragged him here.

He specialized in internal medicine, not orthopedics.

Why haul an old man out for this?

Dr. Whitmore examined the injury briefly. "We need to get to a hospital immediately."

He wasn't Superman—he couldn't see through skin and bone.
###Chapter 912

Preston probably thought the same as he carefully guided Evelyn to the side seat.

She sat down, and he reached over to fasten her seatbelt.

Their eyes met, exchanging a silent understanding.

Evelyn glanced up and saw Lucas sitting across from her.

He flashed her an enigmatic smile and winked. "Little E, touched that I came to pick you up?"

Her lips twitched. Did he really come for me? Or for Natalie?

He was already peeling an orange for Natalie. The audacity of that lie.

Evelyn smirked. "Natalie, are you touched?"

Natalie blushed and rolled her eyes. "Little E, your brother was talking to you."

Evelyn tilted her head. "No, he clearly meant you."

Alexander cleared his throat sharply. "Save the banter. We’ll settle this once we’re home."

Sebastian shuddered as the helicopter lifted off.

The aircraft soon vanished into the sky.

On the ground below, Tristan narrowed his eyes, spotting the "Sterling" insignia on the departing helicopter. He rushed to Nathan’s side. "Blackwood, look! The Sterlings are here too?"

Blackwood Industries had arrived to fund Project Hope, delivering supplies immediately after the mudslide. The journey had been treacherous—roads washed out, terrain unstable. A crane had barely managed to transport them across.

Nathan Blackwood wasn’t the type to personally oversee charity work. He could’ve just written a check.

Yet here he was. Not for publicity, but because he couldn’t ignore the devastation.

At Tristan’s words, Nathan looked up.

The Sterling emblem glared back at him. His pupils constricted. "The Sterlings are here?"

Tristan frowned. "Didn’t hear they had interests in this region."

A local official approached, smiling. "Mr. Blackwood, you know them? Ms. Sterling and her friends came to watch the meteor shower last night. Got caught in the mudslide. Lucky for them, Mr. Sinclair arrived in time. The Sterlings sent a chopper at dawn—brought supplies, then took them back—"

Silence followed.

Nathan’s chest tightened at the mention of Evelyn’s sprained ankle. Breathing suddenly felt like swallowing glass.

His expression darkened. Preston Sinclair. Again. Always him.

Still, at least Preston had been there.

Tristan cleared his throat. "Were they hurt? Everyone alright?"

The official hesitated. "Minor injuries, but Ms. Sterling’s ankle needed proper care. Our clinic here isn’t equipped, so they left quickly—"

Tristan sighed dramatically. "Almost crossed paths. What a shame, eh, Blackwood?"

Nathan’s jaw clenched. He turned away without a word.

He didn’t want to imagine Evelyn’s fear last night. And the one who reached her wasn’t him.

The official faltered, sensing tension.

Tristan waved it off. "Don’t mind him. Old wounds."

Nathan’s pursuit of his ex-wife was a losing battle when his rival matched him at every turn.

Unlike Tristan and his ex, Vivian. He wondered if she’d dumped that pretty boy yet.
###Chapter 913

Alexander still insisted on taking Evelyn to Dr. Samuel Whitmore's hospital.

Her injury was clearly just a sprained ankle, yet they performed a full-body examination.

By then, Sebastian and Alexander had already left.

Lucas waited outside with Natalie, eyeing Preston Sinclair who stood nearby.

Preston wore a faint smile, clearly in high spirits.

Lucas couldn't help but scoff. "Mr. Sinclair, are you really that happy my sister got hurt?"

Preston stiffened slightly, his smile fading as he met Lucas's gaze.

"I'm not happy she's injured, Lucas. Don't misunderstand."

Since Lucas was Evelyn's brother, Preston made sure to exercise 120% of his patience with him.

Lucas smirked. "Even though Dad and my older brother told me to be polite to you, I'll be honest—I don’t approve of Evelyn being with you."

Natalie shot Lucas a sidelong glance, lips parting as if to speak, but she held back. A trace of exasperation flickered in her eyes.

Preston's expression darkened slightly. "May I ask why?"

Lucas grinned, his handsome face effortlessly charming. "You have money, but that’s the one thing our family doesn’t lack. To us, you don’t bring anything special to the table. And—" He paused meaningfully. "You already have a child. The rumors online might’ve been unfair, but some of them held truth, didn’t they?"

Preston’s gaze turned icy, but he remained silent.

Lucas continued, undeterred. "Sure, Evelyn’s been married before, but that doesn’t mean she’ll lower her standards. It’s sad enough she hasn’t even had a proper relationship at her age, but we won’t just hand her over to the first decent man who comes knocking."

He leaned in slightly, his tone mocking. "If it were up to me, I’d tell her to date around. Once she’s seen enough, she’ll know exactly who she wants. Don’t you agree, Mr. Sinclair?"

The words were a blatant challenge.

Lucas might as well have spelled out "back off" in the air. Preston could date Evelyn, but marriage? Not a chance—he wouldn’t even be her first serious boyfriend.

Natalie rubbed her temples, exasperated.

Without Evelyn around to rein him in, Lucas had a talent for pushing people to their limits.

If he was so bold, why hadn’t he said any of this online?

Clearly, he thought Preston was soft-spoken—easy to bully.

Natalie studied Preston’s expression, unsure if he was truly unbothered or just masking his anger. Anyone would be furious after hearing those words.

If this had been Nathan Blackwood… Well, Lucas’s status as Evelyn’s brother wouldn’t have saved him.

Yet Preston stood tall, his composed demeanor unchanged, as if he hadn’t caught the insult.

Lucas watched him, smirking, waiting for a reaction.

Preston lowered his gaze, lips curving into a faint, indifferent smile.

"Dating too much has its drawbacks. Missing the right person would be a regret, wouldn’t it?" His eyes flicked meaningfully toward Natalie. "I’m sure you understand that better than most."

The air turned frigid.

Lucas stiffened, eyes widening as he whipped his head toward Natalie.

She was already on her feet, phone in hand, her expression unreadable.

She didn’t even glance at him.

"I’m at the hospital. I’ll be back at the office soon. Proceed with the meeting as scheduled."

The call ended. She walked away, her retreating figure tense.
###Chapter 914

Lucas knew Preston's words had instantly shattered the fragile truce between Natalie and him.

It had taken weeks to rebuild their friendship, yet Preston demolished it with a single sentence.

Lucas clenched his jaw, his striking features twisting in frustration as he glared at Preston.

"Mark my words!"

He'd mistaken Preston for a pushover, but the man turned out to be a silent viper.

'Damn, I completely misread him.'

Preston watched with an impassive smile as Lucas rushed after Natalie, calling out apologies.

The only person who mattered to Preston was Evelyn. When she finally emerged, he stood waiting alone.

Dr. Whitmore personally wheeled her out, transferring care to Preston.

"All test results are clear. Just a mild ankle sprain."

He adjusted his glasses. "Rest for three days, ice regularly. I'll update your father before he floods my phone with calls. Hospital or home?"

Evelyn opened her mouth, but Preston answered first.

"Hospital."

Dr. Whitmore raised an eyebrow. Hospitalization for a sprained ankle?

Sterling Manor's medical suite surpassed any hospital facility. Preston's lips curved slightly. "She'll follow doctor's orders here. At home, she'll sneak off to work despite protests."

The doctor chuckled. "Understood. I'll process admission - same VIP suite. Remember the way?" Evelyn nodded obediently. "Thank you, Dr. Whitmore."

As the doctor left, Evelyn tilted her head up at Preston, who wore a guilty expression beneath his warm smile.

"New boyfriend privileges include worrying you'll forget me already."

Evelyn smirked. "That could happen."

Preston smoothly pushed her wheelchair forward. "Exactly why you're staying put."

"I can't live here forever," she countered.

He gently tousled her hair. "No rush. I'm not leaving your side."

The unexpected declaration made her pulse skip. Evelyn looked away, cheeks warming.

In the elevator, realization struck. "Where are my brothers?"

'They abandoned me? Impossible!'

Preston hesitated. "I may have provoked Lucas..."

Better to confess than let Lucas poison the Sterlings against him. With Evelyn's support, the gamble was worth it.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock, her delicate features registering disbelief.

The elevator dinged.

Preston guided her out. "Lucas disapproves. He thinks Oliver makes me unworthy of you."

Evelyn's mouth opened, then closed. She knew Oliver's true parentage.

But revealing the boy's origins to clear Preston's name would be selfish. Besides, she never considered Oliver a liability.

"I'm sorry. Lucas doesn't know the truth about Oliver. I'll talk to him."

At the suite door, Preston pushed it open with quiet grace, his expression calm.

Once inside, he knelt before her wheelchair—
###Chapter 915

Preston Sinclair gazed deeply into Evelyn's eyes as he held her hands firmly in his. His grip was steady, reassuring.

"You don't need to apologize, Evelyn. I'll explain everything when the time comes. Nothing matters more than you."

The warmth in his eyes was overwhelming. Evelyn's pulse quickened. She wanted to look away, but that would've been too obvious.

She shook her head. "I still think we should keep it hidden. Unless Oliver himself senses something's wrong, this secret can't come out."

Sometimes, the truth shattered worlds.

How could she do that to the boy?

Preston smiled but stayed silent. He understood the situation perfectly.

The secret wouldn't stay buried forever. But Evelyn's concern still touched him.

He wheeled her closer to the window, letting her enjoy the view while he refreshed the vase of foxtail lilies nearby. He'd bought them earlier from a florist down the street. Their delicate fragrance filled the room.

Evelyn didn't seem to mind.

Their relationship wasn't fiery passion, but it wasn't stagnant either. Both were making efforts—Preston inching closer, Evelyn not pulling away. His careful, considerate approach never made her uncomfortable.

The door swung open.

William Sterling marched in, Alexander trailing behind. Alexander already knew what this meant—all company matters would be dumped on him now.

Resigned, he stayed quiet. Did Evelyn "Lil E" Sterling feel no shame working in spurts like this?

The two men froze in the doorway.

Evelyn sat in her wheelchair, sipping coffee with an afternoon snack. An iPad played an old drama series on the table.

Beside her, Preston peeled fruit with his sculpted fingers. He speared a piece with a toothpick and brought it to her lips.

"Ah—"

Evelyn bit into it without glancing away from the screen. Preston tenderly wiped the corner of her mouth.

William and Alexander witnessed the entire scene. Their expressions twisted in identical dismay.

William cleared his throat sharply, shattering the couple's bubble.

Evelyn turned, spotting them. Then she looked back at Preston.

This was moving too fast—him meeting her family as her boyfriend.

"Dad, Alex, what brings you here?"

Preston rose smoothly, greeting them before offering his seat to William. William took it without hesitation. That earlier scene had nearly given him heartburn.

"Why aren't you recuperating at home? That little brat Lucas—I told him to fetch you, and he bolted!"

Evelyn knew exactly why. Preston had explained everything.

"He's busy. I'm fine here."

William suppressed a growl. "Lucas has no sense of priority!"

His gaze softened as he studied his daughter. "Two injuries now. Does it hurt this time?"

Before Evelyn could introduce Preston properly, William ignored him entirely.

Preston didn't mind. He simply stood aside.

William scanned the room critically. "If you won't come home, I'll send the housekeeper and butler. They'll bring your clothes. This place is tiny—Dr. Whitmore was stingy designing this VIP suite!"

Alexander's lips twitched.

Evelyn blinked. "Dad, this is a hospital. The staff would just be in the way. Besides, I don't need them."

She glanced up at Preston, who immediately spoke. "I'll take care of her, Mr. Sterling."

William finally looked at him. "Mr. Sinclair, why are you here? When did you arrive? I didn't see you earlier."
###Chapter 916

Preston Sinclair deliberately looked at William Sterling with confused eyes. As if he hadn't noticed William standing there at all.

Evelyn and William exchanged glances, speechless.

He was right there, alive and well. Was Preston seriously pretending not to see him?

William immediately understood—this was a power play from his girlfriend’s family.

Saving Evelyn’s life had earned Preston gratitude, but if it were just that, William wouldn’t be getting the cold shoulder.

But Preston was planning to take his daughter away. Naturally, the rules of engagement had changed.

Preston smiled, his expression gentle and humble, not a trace of irritation in sight.

"I didn’t want to interrupt, so I stayed quiet. I hope you won’t hold my silence against me."

Alexander Sterling raised a brow. Not many people could handle William’s deliberate indifference with such grace.

William paused, then nodded with a faint smile.

Evelyn quickly interjected, "Dad, if it weren’t for Preston’s quick thinking, none of us would’ve made it out safely."

William arched a brow, studying Preston with renewed interest.

"Mr. Sinclair, you’ve saved Evelyn yet again. I truly don’t know how to thank you."

Preston met his gaze steadily. "It was my honor. Just seeing Evelyn safe and happy is more than enough."

His eyes softened as they lingered on Evelyn.

Alexander’s gaze sharpened. The unspoken tension between them was impossible to miss.

William gave him an inscrutable look before turning back to Evelyn, his tone suddenly stern. "You’re still running around at your age? You got lucky this time with Mr. Sinclair’s help. What if you hadn’t?"

Evelyn flinched, a flicker of fear crossing her face.

William instantly regretted his harsh words. He couldn’t stand seeing her distressed.

With a gruff sigh, he softened his approach.

"You can watch meteor showers anywhere. When we get home, I’ll have Alexander move the entire observatory setup to the estate. Invite your friends, enjoy snacks and music—doesn’t that sound better?"

Alexander barely suppressed an eye roll.

Preston’s lips twitched. He was witnessing firsthand just how spoiled Evelyn was.

A full set of high-end astronomical equipment? That cost nearly nine figures. Even professional observatories didn’t always have that level of tech.

Evelyn’s face brightened instantly. She beamed at Alexander. "Thank you, big brother!"

Alexander rubbed his temples but nodded.

"I’ll have it installed in your study—"

They were already deciding the location.

A phone call pulled Alexander away, and William made it clear he intended to stay and personally oversee Evelyn’s care.

She swiftly shut that down.

After considerable effort, she finally convinced her father to leave. The moment the door closed, both Evelyn and Preston exhaled in relief.

Evelyn offered an apologetic smile. "Since Dad retired, his entire world revolves around us and fishing. He wasn’t always like this."

Preston nodded in understanding. "It’s rare to see a family like yours—no infighting, no selfishness. Your father raised you all well."

Evelyn’s smile deepened.

"Building the company wasn’t easy, but he never neglected us. What’s there to fight over? We’re family."

Preston’s expression shifted, warmth flickering in his eyes.

He’d seen the ugly side of high society—greed, betrayal, endless power struggles.

But the Sterling family was different.

He smirked. "Your father seems wary of me. He’s probably guessed about us."

Evelyn hesitated. "He won’t interfere unless I say something first."

That was William’s way. No matter how he felt, he’d wait for Evelyn to speak up herself.

Preston’s gaze darkened as he studied her. "Then… when will you tell him?"
###Chapter 917

Evelyn Sinclair froze at the question. Going public?

She hadn't prepared herself for this.

A few seconds passed before she met his gaze.

"Not yet," she said carefully. "We should wait a little longer."

Their relationship wasn't stable enough. The moment it became public, chaos would erupt—not just in their social circles, but in the stock market too. The fallout would be massive, and she wasn't ready to handle it.

Besides, rushing into this wasn't worth the risk.

Preston Sinclair studied her troubled expression before chuckling softly. His voice was warm, laced with amusement.

"Fine. I can be patient," he conceded. "But on one condition."

Evelyn lifted a brow. His gaze darkened slightly as he paused.

"Once you're discharged, don't go back to Sterling Manor. Move out."

She stared at him, silent.

Preston sighed, his lips curving into a helpless smile. "Give your boyfriend a chance to take care of you. If I send you home late, William might come after me with a knife."

Evelyn hesitated. He had a point. She'd misjudged him—this wasn't the cold, calculating Preston she'd once known.

"Fine," she agreed. "I'll tell my family. But we're not living together."

The air between them turned thick. Preston's fingers brushed through her hair, his smile deepening.

"Whatever you want."

For now, getting her out of Sterling Manor was enough.

Upstairs, the penthouse had a small kitchen. Preston insisted on cooking, and Evelyn couldn't talk him out of it.

She frowned. Why do men always want to cook? Is takeout not good enough?

Still, it was better than sitting in awkward silence.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Bennett. He was downstairs.

Minutes later, he arrived, carrying a stack of files.

Evelyn eyed them warily.

Bennett set them down with a grin, wiping his palms on his pants. "Alexander Sterling thought you'd get bored during your recovery, so he sent these over to keep you busy. How's your foot?"

Her lips twitched.

"Better. Is my brother that busy?"

In the past, Grant—no, Alexander—would have let her slack off without a second thought.

Bennett nodded solemnly.

"Extremely busy. He's dating."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

She understood exactly what that meant.

The pile of documents made her head throb. She tapped her chin, considering.

"Is my place ready?"

Bennett nodded. "All your apartments are in prime locations. We've pre-screened high-quality tenants—want to review their profiles?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No need. They won't be staying long anyway. Just move my things to Highland Estates and leave the rest."

Bennett agreed, though he didn't get it. Evelyn had more money than she could spend—why bother renting out properties?

For people like her, extra homes were just status symbols.

No matter how he looked at it, the logic escaped him.
###Chapter 918

Evelyn Sinclair had the final say—she was the boss, after all.

Bennett Sterling gave a brief update on Sterling Enterprises' recent developments before excusing himself.

As he stepped out, he nearly collided with the impeccably dressed Preston Sinclair, who nodded politely.

Bennett returned the gesture. "Mr. Sinclair, please take good care of Ms. Sterling."

"Of course."

Preston's voice was smooth, devoid of any pretension. Bennett left after the exchange.

The moment he turned away, his expression shifted.

What did "of course" mean?

Preston wasn't part of the Sterling family, yet here he was. The implications were obvious.

Having worked closely with Evelyn for years, Bennett knew a PR storm was brewing.

He could already picture Nathan Blackwood's reaction—pure, unbridled fury.

Downstairs, Bennett was about to get into his car when a portly figure came barreling toward the building.

Squinting, Bennett recognized the man—Nathan's butler, Theodore Winslow.

He immediately texted Evelyn. Only after receiving her curt "okay" did he start the engine and drive off.

Evelyn set her phone down, her mood visibly cooling.

Preston noticed the shift. She'd been in high spirits after Bennett left—what changed?

Then, a knock at the door.

Preston moved to answer, but Evelyn spoke first, voice icy. "It's Nathan's butler."

Nathan must have heard about her injury. Sending Theodore was his way of checking in—without showing up himself.

Good. She wasn't ready to explain Preston's presence to Nathan yet.

It wasn't necessary.

Preston's smile faltered as he studied her. "You don't want to see him?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "I assumed you wouldn't."

Three seconds of silence passed before Preston's lips curved into a slow, knowing grin.

His girl was already picking sides—and protecting him more fiercely than he'd expected.

"While I'd rather not deal with him, he's not here for me. And it's not like I need to hide." He shrugged. "See him if you want to."

Preston didn't fear Nathan Blackwood—much less his errand boy. Why would he care?

Evelyn arched a brow. She'd been considerate of his feelings, and he couldn't be bothered? "Fine. Open the door."

The knocking had persisted for a full minute now. Impressive dedication.

Preston obliged.

Theodore beamed, lifting a thermos. "Ms. Sterling! I came to—"

His grin froze when he spotted Preston. For a long moment, Theodore just blinked, processing.

Preston stepped aside politely. "After you."

Theodore didn't move.

Evelyn frowned. "Theodore. Are you coming in or not?"

The butler shuffled forward mechanically, eyes still locked on Preston.

Preston smirked. "Don't recognize me? Should I introduce myself?"

As if Theodore wouldn't know Preston Sinclair—the thorn in Nathan Blackwood's side.

Evelyn's patience thinned. "Stop staring. State your business."

Theodore forced a smile. "I didn't realize you had company. I would've come another time—"

Nathan had sent him to check on Evelyn.

If Nathan knew Preston was here, he'd have helicoptered straight from his mountain retreat.

Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Get to the point."

Preston glanced between them, making no move to leave. Instead, he wandered to the balcony—close enough to eavesdrop, pretending to admire the view.
###Chapter 919

Theodore Winslow pressed his lips together. He knew better than to ask Evelyn Sinclair's companion to leave.

He set the thermos down in front of her.

"Your favorite soup—low-calorie, low-fat. Perfect for nourishing beauty and health."

With practiced ease, he ladled a portion into a bowl.

Evelyn had grown accustomed to Theodore's culinary offerings. Unlike Nathan Blackwood, he never felt like an intrusion.

She accepted the bowl, stirring absently. The rich aroma confirmed its quality.

But she wasn't fooled. Theodore's sudden appearance undoubtedly tied back to Nathan.

Placing the spoon down, she fixed him with a look.

"How did you know I was hospitalized here?"

Theodore's smile was rehearsed. He'd prepared for this exact question.

"Mr. Blackwood informed me, Ms. Sinclair. He monitors your wellbeing closely." He leaned in conspiratorially. "There was a mudslide near the mountains you visited. Mr. Blackwood is currently there personally, delivering relief supplies and overseeing reconstruction efforts."

A deliberate pause.

"People mistake his stern demeanor for coldness, but beneath that exterior lies remarkable compassion. He rushed into danger without hesitation. Pity you missed each other..."

Evelyn's brows knitted. "He went himself?"

That didn't align with the ruthless businessman she knew.

Theodore nodded emphatically. "Absolutely. While Blackwood Industries profits immensely, Mr. Blackwood allocates substantial resources to philanthropy annually. His actions simply speak louder than his expressions."

His gaze flickered toward the balcony, where a silhouette stood motionless. A barely concealed sneer twisted his features.

"Unlike certain charming frauds who prey on trusting women."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her teacup. The unsubtle jab at Preston Sinclair was unnecessary.

On the balcony, Preston's posture remained rigid, though he made no move to interrupt.

Evelyn took a measured sip before responding.

"Blackwood Industries has development projects in that region, correct? Failing to act during a crisis would invite governmental scrutiny. Mr. Blackwood's timing is, as always, impeccable—capitalizing on PR opportunities while strengthening political connections."

Theodore blinked, momentarily thrown. Her clinical analysis wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated.

After a prolonged silence, Evelyn added, "Please convey my gratitude for his concern."

Theodore nodded mechanically.

"Was there anything else?" Evelyn prompted.

He scrambled to recover. "I could deliver meals daily—nutritionally balanced, of course!"

Evelyn's lips curved. "That won't be necessary."

"No trouble at all! It would be my pleasure!"

Theodore's mind raced. Daily visits would allow him to monitor Preston's interactions.

Evelyn shook her head, amusement glinting in her eyes as she gestured toward the balcony. Preston's figure, framed by shifting light, exuded effortless magnetism.

"My boyfriend happens to be an excellent cook. But do thank Mr. Blackwood for his thoughtfulness."

Theodore's smile shattered.

Boyfriend?

His mouth opened soundlessly, features contorting in disbelief.

"Ms. Sinclair... you and he are... together?"

The words emerged strangled, as if physically pained.
###Chapter 920

A chill ran down Theodore Winslow's spine.

Seeing Evelyn Sinclair's calm smile and nod, panic surged through him.

'If Nathan finds out... Dear God, I can't even imagine!' Theodore thought, his hands trembling.

He stumbled backward, words tumbling out incoherently. "I can't... I wouldn't dare..."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Wouldn't dare what?"

"Deliver your message to Mr. Blackwood. Ms. Sinclair, I—I have work to attend to. Goodbye!"

Theodore fled like a man escaping a burning building.

Evelyn shook her head in amusement. Was such dramatics really necessary?

When Preston Sinclair noticed Theodore's hasty exit, he casually closed the door and glanced at the untouched soup on Evelyn's bedside table.

"I thought you wanted to keep things private?"

Evelyn set down her teacup with deliberate slowness.

"This isn't going public. Just giving certain people fair warning."

Preston's lips curved into a knowing smile.

That particular person probably wanted this matter buried even more than they did. Preston couldn't wait to see Nathan's reaction—the anticipation sent a thrill through him.

Evelyn reached for the soup, but Preston snatched it away first. She blinked up at him in surprise.

His voice dropped to that deep, honeyed tone she knew too well. "I just discovered you enjoy soup. Let me taste it so I can recreate the recipe for you." He drank without waiting for permission.

Preston made a show of considering the flavor before shaking his head. "Not good enough."

Then he poured out the remaining contents and drank every last drop. Evelyn watched mournfully as her meal disappeared. "Well? Figured it out?"

Stealing food from an injured woman—what an infuriating man.

His dark eyes locked onto hers. "No."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"But I can cook better." Preston's certainty left no room for argument. His fingers brushed her earlobe. "So stop accepting food from other men."

The realization hit her—he'd downed the entire thermos out of sheer jealousy. Heat crept up Evelyn's neck. Preston lingered all day, ignoring countless calls until Evelyn finally shooed him away.

The peace lasted exactly twenty minutes before Isabella Montgomery burst in, radiating enough energy to power Manhattan.

Evelyn took one look at her best friend's glowing face and knew—love had claimed another victim.

Isabella devoured Evelyn's entire snack stash before announcing, "I'm officially in a relationship!"

Evelyn smirked. "Donovan Pierce? Weren't you two already..."

"We upgraded from friends with benefits to exclusive." Isabella waved a hand. "I chose him over that helicopter guy."

Evelyn shuddered remembering Donovan's icy demeanor. "He doesn't strike me as the romantic type."

Isabella's grin turned predatory. "Once I sink my claws in, he's not going anywhere. Sure, no helicopter—but when I was in trouble, he moved heaven and earth to reach me." Her eyes softened. "The way he looked at me when he found me... that man's obsessed."

Evelyn burst out laughing at her friend's delusion.

Who was really the obsessed one here?

But seeing Isabella happy—genuinely happy—eased the sting of watching Alexander with Amelia.

Isabella stayed until well past midnight, when Donovan finally came to collect his wayward girlfriend.
###Chapter 921

For days, Preston Sinclair had been itching to move his entire office setup to the hospital.

He wanted to stay with Evelyn Sinclair around the clock.

Evelyn's foot injury had nearly healed, but she'd gotten a full dose of Preston's clinginess. It was giving her a migraine.

Thankfully, Alexander Sterling was swamped with work at Sterling Enterprises. He issued an ultimatum, so Evelyn practically skipped out of the hospital in relief.

Instead of returning to Sterling Manor, she moved into Crystal Heights. The luxury penthouse had always been under her name.

Bennett finished most of the packing and escorted Evelyn over to inspect what else needed furnishing.

William Sterling had initially resisted the idea, but for Evelyn's happiness, he reluctantly agreed.

On moving day, the entire Sterling family—except Donovan, who was buried in research—showed up at Crystal Heights.

Evelyn's favorite interior designer had customized the space to her taste. The sleek, open-concept layout incorporated cutting-edge AI technology.

Evelyn surveyed the apartment, thoroughly pleased.

William, however, nitpicked every detail until Lucas looked ready to tear his hair out.

Bennett excused himself to return to the office. He opened the door—and froze.

"Mr. Sinclair—"

The name instantly drew everyone's attention.

Evelyn's eyelid twitched as she glanced toward the entrance.

There stood Preston, wearing that infuriatingly charming smile. His gaze lingered on Evelyn before nodding at William, who was already striding over.

"Uncle William, what a coincidence."

Coincidence? Evelyn nearly choked.

William narrowed his eyes. "Why are you here?"

Preston shrugged. "I live upstairs. Just moved in. Didn't expect to run into you all. What an honor."

William's mouth twitched. "Yes. What a... coincidence."

The kind of coincidence that reeked of calculation.

Preston was dressed casually, exuding effortless elegance. Evelyn refused to admit it, but he'd clearly been lying in wait by that door.

Lucas shot her a knowing look. Evelyn quickly averted her gaze and walked over.

"Mr. Sinclair, what a surprise. Why don't you join us for dinner?"

Preston's smile deepened. "Perfect. I'll cook. You can all sample my culinary skills."

William's suspicious gaze bounced between them. This felt rehearsed.

Evelyn was being framed. She genuinely hadn't known Preston lived here, let alone expected him to accept the invitation! But backing out now was impossible.

Preston added, "I happen to have ingredients upstairs. I'll go grab them."

With that, he vanished like smoke.

William clicked his tongue and jerked his chin at Lucas. "Go help him."

Lucas smirked at Evelyn. "Sure. Wouldn't want my future brother-in-law to strain himself."

Alexander's icy glare could freeze lava. William kicked Lucas. "Watch your mouth!"

Evelyn threw up her hands. "I swear, I had no idea about any of this."

William scoffed. "And your sudden move had nothing to do with him?"

Silence.

William finally snapped. "Are you two actually together?"

Evelyn glanced at Alexander, then at William, and gave a small nod.

The room plunged into silence.

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn cleared her throat.

"Dad, Preston and I are serious. No interference."
###Chapter 922

Preston Sinclair closed his eyes and exhaled slowly.

Though he'd saved Evelyn twice and the Sterling family owed him gratitude, this arrangement felt excessive.

They admired Preston's character, but his status as a single father remained an uncomfortable truth.

Alexander Sterling studied William's expression before speaking in measured tones. "It's just dating. No guarantees where it leads."

"As long as Evelyn's happy, who cares about his background?" Alexander's words made William reconsider.

This wasn't marriage. What harm could dating do?

William's features relaxed visibly. "Fine, we won't interfere. Just know what you're doing."

Evelyn nodded with a small smile.

William stood, but couldn't resist adding, "Romance spices up life, but it's optional. Money comes first—understand?"

"Money first, love second," Evelyn agreed dutifully, earning William's satisfied nod.

The kitchen door swung open as Lucas and Preston entered simultaneously, arms laden with grocery bags enough for a week's worth of meals. Evelyn arched a brow—had Preston planned this?

Preston produced a chef's apron from his jacket pocket and tied it with practiced ease. "Mr. Sterling, dinner will be ready shortly."

William shot Lucas a pointed look. Grudgingly, Lucas rolled up his sleeves. "Let me help, Mr. Sinclair."

Lucas had long suspected Preston's gentlemanly facade hid vulpine cunning. His hospital remarks still kept Natalie Beaumont from speaking to him.

Now he had to assist the man who ruined his love life. 'Most miserable A-lister ever,' he thought bitterly.

Preston graciously made space at the counter. Lucas deliberately slowed his vegetable washing, dragging out the task.

Preston's lips curved. "Lucas, is Ms. Beaumont still upset?"

Lucas stiffened. Preston had aimed straight for his weak spot.

"You think your little performance didn't cause this?" Lucas snapped.

Preston's smile deepened. "Your ex called her that night. She left right after. My words had nothing to do with it."

"Which ex?" Lucas's hands stilled. "Jacqueline Moreau?"

Preston's silence confirmed it.

"I planned to explain to Ms. Beaumont personally," Preston continued, "but imagine my surprise seeing her with Jacqueline that evening. Such a talented actress—crying on command to a complete stranger. Quite the spectacle."

Lucas's grip turned the lettuce to pulp. That scheming Jacqueline!

Hollywood knew Lucas changed girlfriends like seasonal wardrobes, but Jacqueline had always been different.

They'd debuted together, starred in multiple films as lovers, even won Best Actor and Actress simultaneously.

The industry dubbed them the Golden Couple.

At their peak popularity years ago, rumors swirled about their off-screen relationship.

For publicity—and Jacqueline's career—their agency neither confirmed nor denied.
###Chapter 923

Some people took silence as admission.

That's how Lucas found himself "forced" into a relationship with Jacqueline.

Eventually, he couldn't take it anymore and ended things. Jacqueline left for Europe to film an Oscar-bait movie, and their agency seized the moment to announce the "breakup."

Just like that, Jacqueline became Lucas Sterling's ex.

Everything had been fine until now. Why was she suddenly back and looking for Natalie?

Lucas didn't need to think twice—Jacqueline was definitely up to no good.

His relationship with Natalie was already hanging by a thread. Jacqueline's reappearance would only make things worse.

Furious, Lucas slammed down what he was holding, ready to confront her.

Preston's slender fingers rinsed vegetables under the tap, methodical and precise.

A calm, deep voice cut through the tension. "Lucas, I have dirt on her. Want it?"

Lucas froze mid-step, then turned to see Preston smiling innocently.

"Friends don't owe friends explanations."

Lucas couldn't help but laugh. Preston was no harmless lamb. For Evelyn's sake, he'd dug up everyone's secrets.

What kind of man had his sister fallen for?

From the living room, William called out, "Need any help?" He still had another son, after all.

Lucas glanced around, then grinned, snatching the vegetables from Preston's hands. "Nope. My future brother-in-law and I have this kitchen under control!"

Evelyn slipped in quietly, watching them joke while washing vegetables. She blinked in disbelief. Hadn't Lucas disliked Preston? Since when did they get so chummy? Men's friendships were truly baffling.

Less than thirty minutes later, everyone gathered around the unfamiliar dining table.

Five dishes and a soup steamed between them, vibrant and aromatic.

It looked like restaurant-quality food. William's gaze softened when it landed on Preston. Alexander tasted each dish with his usual stoic expression before nodding approval.

"Damn, my future brother-in-law's skills are insane!" Lucas grinned. "Preston, you could give Michelin chefs a run for their—" His face twitched as Evelyn elbowed him sharply. Brother-in-law?

Preston, however, looked thoroughly pleased by the title.

Evelyn wanted to melt into the floor.

William chewed thoughtfully. "Impressive. Did you learn this for Oliver?"

Preston's eyes flickered, but he didn't evade. "Yes. Oliver was a picky child. After a few... incidents when we traveled, I started cooking myself."

William nodded. A man only learned to cook midlife for two reasons: his wife or his kids.

"Oliver's mother—" William pressed on. "Did she pass or did you divorce?"

The table went dead silent.

Evelyn shot her father a desperate look.

William ignored her. "May I ask?"

Preston set down his spoon. "She passed away."

William accepted this with a nod and changed the subject.

The collective relief was palpable.

Preston caught Evelyn's worried glance and winked—I'm fine.

After dinner, Evelyn shooed her family out. William left reluctantly with Alexander and Lucas in tow.

Preston helped clean up, took out the trash, and returned with a bag of fresh fruit.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Mr. Sinclair, last I checked, your penthouse wasn't in this building."

He smiled. "That place left a bad impression. Sold it."

"So that's why you made me move. Planned this all along?"
###Chapter 924

Preston Sinclair let out a quiet sigh. His stormy gray eyes studied Evelyn Sinclair with silent intensity.

"I only wanted to look after you personally. To be near you, I tried purchasing every property adjacent to yours."

Evelyn hesitated briefly, pressing her lips together. "Will you return to Pacifica once the Kingsley Tech project concludes?"

His chiseled features tensed before softening into a smile.

"Don't worry about distance. Montecito holds tremendous potential. Why would I leave?"

She arched an eyebrow but didn't press further. Continuing would make it seem like she wanted him to stay.

Just as Preston opened his mouth to speak, his phone buzzed.

Seeing the caller ID, his brow furrowed before answering.

He made no effort to step away. The sharp angles of his profile turned icy as his voice dropped to a dangerous register.

After hanging up, he turned back to her. "An urgent matter requires my attention. Call if you miss me."

Evelyn blinked. "Understood. I won't walk you out."

Preston chuckled despite himself. He reached out to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear before striding away. The lingering warmth of his presence made her cheeks flush. She inhaled deeply.

Days later, an invitation arrived for a high-society gala. Evelyn hesitated about attending since she'd already made plans with Preston. As she debated, his text came through - a photo of the same invitation.

"Shall we relocate our date?"

Evelyn smiled. Always so thoughtful. "Absolutely!"

Their relationship was growing more comfortable by the day.

Blackwood Industries Headquarters

Nathan Blackwood had been constantly on the move. After returning from the mountains, he'd embarked on back-to-back international trips without pause. Yet every night without fail, he sent Evelyn a "good night" message. Each one disappeared into the void.

Still, the fact she hadn't blocked him thrilled the ruthless CEO. His standards had sunk remarkably low.

Now seated in his office, Nathan finished reviewing department reports with cold efficiency before fixing his assistant with a stare.

Harrison looked exhausted but delivered his report professionally.

"Sir, Blackwood Industries' relief supplies received unanimous praise from officials. Viral posts have generated tremendous goodwill. Previously stagnant inventory sold out overnight."

"Our tech and PR teams collaborated seamlessly. The reputation boost has already doubled first-half profits."

All thanks to one powerful image: Nathan standing knee-deep in mud, his expensive shoes ruined, cradling a rescued child. The stark contrast between his usual polished appearance and this moment of vulnerability sparked massive public empathy.

The PR team's prepared statements became unnecessary. Blackwood Industries dominated the news cycle effortlessly, rendering other companies' donations mere footnotes.

Nathan tapped his desk impatiently. "And Evelyn?"

Harrison hesitated.

"The Sterling family donated generously, but our additional funding kept Blackwood Industries in the spotlight. The Sterlings have remained deliberately low-profile - likely because Ms. Sterling's dramatic rescue already drew significant attention. Further publicity might backfire."
###Chapter 925

Harrison's hands trembled slightly as he delivered the news about the Sterling family sending a private jet for Evelyn Sinclair.

The cost of chartering such luxury transport far exceeded the Sterling family's charitable donations.

Nathan Blackwood's fingers tightened around his silver cufflinks, the metal biting into his skin. His voice cut through the office like winter wind. "I asked about Evelyn, not her family."

Harrison swallowed hard.

"Theodore visited her yesterday. Ms. Sinclair's ankle has healed completely. She's been discharged from the hospital."

Nathan's glacial stare pinned Harrison in place. The temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees.

Harrison knew better than to lie. Not to Nathan Blackwood. Not when those piercing eyes saw through every deception.

"There's more," Harrison admitted. "According to our sources, Ms. Sinclair is now in a relationship with Preston Sinclair."

The words hit Nathan like a physical blow. His knuckles turned white against the mahogany desk.

"You kept this from me?" The quiet fury in his voice was more terrifying than any shout.

Harrison lowered his gaze. "The situation was already... irreversible. We didn't know how to—"

Nathan's arm swept across the desk in one violent motion. Crystal paperweights and leather-bound planners shattered against the marble floor.

"You had no right!" Nathan's voice cracked with barely contained rage. His usually impeccable appearance showed rare disarray - tie askew, hair falling across his forehead.

Harrison remained silent. No excuse would suffice.

"Get out." Nathan's command left no room for negotiation. "Clear your desk by noon."

Harrison bowed slightly, the motion stiff with resignation. He'd served Nathan for seven years. He knew when arguments were futile.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathan grabbed his coat and stormed out.

He drove straight to Evelyn's penthouse - the one he'd purchased the units above and below just to ensure he could always reach her. His mind raced with unanswered questions. How could she move on so quickly? Was their entire marriage meaningless to her?

The elevator ride felt interminable. Nathan straightened his tie, attempting to compose himself before knocking.

The door swung open before his fist connected with wood.

But it wasn't Evelyn.

A woman with heavy makeup and calculating eyes blinked up at him. "Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice dripped with false sweetness. "Jacqueline Moreau. We met during the Horizon Media spokesperson auditions?"

Nathan's expression turned arctic. "Why are you here?"

Jacqueline preened, touching her hair. "I live here now. What a coincidence running into you like this!" She leaned closer, perfume overwhelming. "The previous owner sold it at a steal. Half the market value!"

The realization struck Nathan like a physical blow. Evelyn hadn't just left him. She'd erased every trace of their life together.
###Chapter 926

Nathan's expression darkened. His obsidian eyes turned glacial. He took a deliberate step back, pivoted sharply, and strode toward the exit.

Jacqueline blocked his path. "Mr. Blackwood, won't you come inside?"

Her fingers nearly grazed his sleeve, but he jerked away as if burned.

Like she was something vile.

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Back off. Killing you would be effortless—understand?"

A warning. Not just against touching him, but against the filthy ambitions swirling in her mind.

Jacqueline paled.

In seconds, Nathan vanished, leaving only icy silence in his wake.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, resentment flashing in her gaze. "I still have Lucas. You can't shake me off that easily."

Nathan had intended to confront the Sterlings for answers, but he aborted the mission mid-journey.

Fear paralyzed him. Fear of the questions. Fear of Evelyn's piercing gaze. Fear of the truth.

At Highland Estates.

Nathan returned to the hollow mansion. Evelyn's absence was a gaping wound. He discarded his coat and sank onto the sofa, wrestling with his emotions.

Heavy footsteps descended the stairs.

Then came Theodore's grating voice. "Mr. Blackwood, you're back?"

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "Why are you still here?"

Theodore scratched his head. "You never dismissed me..." As Nathan's butler, leaving wasn't an option.

Nathan's glare could freeze hell. "You helped conceal Evelyn's affair from me, didn't you?"

He'd ordered Theodore to monitor Evelyn, yet the man had fed him nothing.

Traitor.

Theodore stiffened, paling as he inched closer. "Mr. Blackwood, don't blame Harrison. His loyalty is unwavering! He never meant to deceive you!"

Nathan remained silent, the air around him thickening with frost.

Theodore swallowed hard.

"It was my idea to withhold the truth. Knowing earlier wouldn't have helped. You needed time—for emotions to settle, for the situation to resolve itself—"

Nathan scoffed. "Resolve? Wait for their wedding? Their children? Is that your brilliant strategy? I should've tossed you into the Aurora River."

He yanked out his phone. Theodore lunged forward, knees knocking.

"Mr. Blackwood, they're in the rebellious phase now. Any interference will backfire. But tell me—will the Sterlings ever accept a man with a bastard child?"

Nathan's fingers stilled.

Theodore pressed on. "The Sterlings would never condone this. They're waiting for you to act—to drive the wedge deeper. That way, Evelyn resents you, Preston gets disqualified, and third parties swoop in." His rapid analysis bordered on genius.

Nathan's lip curled. "The Sterlings aren't snobs."

"But Preston's tainted. An illegitimate heir? William Sterling would never humiliate his daughter like that. The scandal alone would ruin them."

Evelyn's status placed her beyond reach for most elites. Only fools dared dream of her post-divorce.

Had she remained married, they wouldn't even get that luxury.

Theodore leaned in.

"Preston's baiting you. If you interfere, Evelyn will despise you more. Isn't that exactly what he wants?"
###Chapter 927

Nathan Blackwood wanted to strangle Theodore Winslow at that moment.

Yet he couldn't deny the logic in the man's words.

Something still felt off.

Nathan's piercing gaze burned into Theodore, his voice icy. "What do you suggest we do now?"

Theodore didn't flinch. "Recall Harrison immediately."

A dangerous silence stretched between them.

No one dared make demands of Nathan Blackwood. Especially not over an assistant.

Theodore pressed on. "From what I've observed, Ms. Sinclair treats Harrison with far more courtesy than she does you."

That stung.

Nathan's jaw clenched, his expression darkening.

Theodore added, "Keeping him as an intermediary would be... strategic."

After a long pause, Nathan scoffed. "Fine. Dock his annual bonus and drag him back."

"You're the most merciful tycoon I've ever met."

Theodore exhaled shakily, his legs barely holding him up. Nathan's glare had been terrifying.

One more second, and he would've cracked.

Harrison, my dear cousin. You owe me your career now.

Nathan rose, his towering frame casting a shadow as he strode toward the stairs. "You'd better be worth the trouble," he muttered.

Harrison's competence and loyalty were undeniable.

Years of service had proven that. But Blackwood Industries didn't tolerate mistakes—no matter how capable the employee.

Still, Nathan preferred consistency. Replacing Harrison would be... inconvenient.

Theodore's hands trembled as he dialed. Harrison listened, thanked him, and hung up.

With relief, Harrison unpacked his belongings from the storage box. Then, he swiftly forwarded his latest findings to Nathan, adding:

"Thank you for the second chance, Mr. Blackwood. I won't fail you."

Nathan ignored the message and clicked the file.

His expression turned thunderous.

The report listed multiple properties Evelyn Sinclair frequented—all recently put up for rent. Tenant details were meticulously verified.

Nathan's grip tightened on his phone.

Was she cutting ties this decisively?

That bastard Preston Sinclair was to blame. And Nathan wasn't about to stand by.

His phone buzzed again—an invitation from Harrison.

The night was thick with opulence.

Golden chandeliers illuminated the grand entrance of the banquet hall.

Pacific Crest Enterprises was celebrating their heiress's birthday—an event that had drawn the city's elite.

Business flowed beneath the guise of celebration.

Evelyn arrived alone, draped in a custom lilac gown that accentuated her ethereal grace. Tall, poised, and radiant under the lights, she commanded attention effortlessly.

She had planned to meet Preston, but urgent business delayed him.

So she entered solo, her cool smile and regal aura making her seem untouchable—a celestial being among mortals.

Every eye followed her.
###Chapter 928

The former CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises approached Evelyn Sinclair with a respectful nod.

"What an honor to have you grace us with your presence, Ms. Sterling!"

Evelyn offered a polite smile and handed the gift to his assistant. "You flatter me. Thank you for the invitation."

The man glanced at the elegantly wrapped box and immediately recognized the prestigious watch inside. His eyes widened slightly—such generosity was rare, even among the elite.

"With so many distinguished guests tonight, I fear I may not be able to attend to you properly..."

Several high-profile figures were arriving behind them, and the man gave an apologetic smile.

Evelyn was about to respond when a smooth, familiar voice cut in.

"Allow me to take care of Ms. Sterling."

She turned to see Cassandra Blake gliding toward her in a daring red gown.

The dress clung to her curves, the high slit revealing long, toned legs with every step. The plunging neckline left little to the imagination.

Evelyn's lips thinned.

The CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises quickly introduced her. "Ms. Sterling, this is our newly appointed executive manager, Cassandra Blake. Her credentials are impeccable—former regional president overseas. I personally recruited her. She'll ensure you're well taken care of."

With that, he excused himself to greet the next guest.

Evelyn studied Cassandra with an amused tilt of her head.

"Quite the career leap. Impressive."

Cassandra's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before she recovered. "I owe my departure from Pacific Crest International to you, Ms. Sterling."

She lifted a champagne flute in a mocking toast.

No longer bound by corporate politics, she had no reason to fear Evelyn now. Tonight, they stood on equal ground.

Evelyn didn’t bother lifting her glass. The disdain in her gaze was sharp enough to cut.

Cassandra’s fingers tightened around her drink.

Who did Evelyn think she was?

Evelyn had no intention of wasting time on her. If Cassandra had lost her position, she had no one to blame but herself.

She turned to leave.

Cassandra’s teeth clenched. Then, a sly smirk curled her lips.

"Ms. Sterling, with your endless line of admirers, why come alone tonight? Need me to introduce you to someone... suitable?"

Evelyn paused, glancing back with icy calm.

Before she could reply, Cassandra let out a low laugh.

"What? Not going to threaten me? All the industry’s elite are watching. You wouldn’t dare make a scene, would you?"

She gestured to Evelyn’s elegant gown. "Such a refined image to uphold."

Her taunts were deliberate—a ploy to shatter Evelyn’s composed facade in front of everyone.

Cassandra wanted the world to see the truth: the untouchable goddess was nothing but a cold, calculating viper.

Evelyn’s expression darkened.

She had no intention of dirtying her hands. A faint, chilling smile touched her lips.

"Lay a finger on you? That would be beneath me."

Cassandra’s confidence wavered.

Evelyn turned away again—only for Cassandra to block her path.

"Don’t you want to know who my date is?"
###Chapter 929

Evelyn didn't even glance in her direction. She wouldn’t have wasted her time if she’d known this trash would keep harassing her.

Disgusting.

"I'm not interested."

Cassandra smoothed her hair, her smirk oozing arrogance.

"Mr. Preston Sinclair is coming today. Did you know that?"

At the mention of Preston’s name, Evelyn’s steps faltered.

Her gaze turned icy as she studied Cassandra. "You mean your date is Preston Sinclair?"

Cassandra tightened her grip on her wine glass under Evelyn’s frosty stare.

"Yes. Sorry to disappoint you. He’ll be here soon. Didn’t expect that, did you?"

Even if she was outmatched, Cassandra would take any chance to needle Evelyn.

So she lied effortlessly, as naturally as breathing.

Evelyn watched her with an amused half-smile. "No, I really didn’t expect that."

Ten minutes ago, Preston had been apologizing profusely for running late and missing their entrance together.

Now Evelyn wanted to see how Cassandra would squirm when forced to choke on her own lies.

Cassandra’s sultry gaze deliberately implied something illicit between her and Preston, just to twist the knife. "Ms. Sinclair, with all your admirers, surely you won’t mind losing this one?"

She launched into a fabricated tale of emotional support and soul-deep connection.

Preston had supposedly pulled her from despair after leaving Pacific Crest International.

Messages of encouragement. Late-night confessions. A bond so profound it had given her the strength to rebuild her life.

She expected fury. Jealousy.

Instead, Evelyn just smiled.

Confused, Cassandra opened her mouth—

Evelyn waved at someone behind her.

Cassandra turned.

Preston strode toward them, tall and effortlessly elegant, his warm demeanor belying his ruthless reputation.

Cassandra’s shock melted into a seductive smile. She sauntered forward, chest thrust out—

Preston ignored her completely.

He went straight to Evelyn, murmuring an apology. "I’m so sorry for the wait. I came as fast as I could."

Evelyn arched a brow, watching Cassandra’s face darken.

Cassandra gritted her teeth and sidled up to Preston. "Mr. Sinclair, missing you for a day feels like three years apart—"

She emphasized her cleavage, a tactic that never failed.

Preston barely glanced at her. "Have we met?"

Cassandra froze.

Evelyn laughed. "You don’t remember? Ms. Blake was a capable employee at Pacific Crest. She even treated us to lunch once."

Preston nodded. "Ah. The fake classmate."

Evelyn smirked. Brutal.

No mercy.

Cassandra stared between them, bewildered.

This wasn’t how their dynamic was supposed to be.

"Ms. Blake claims you two chat often," Evelyn said pointedly.

Preston handed her his phone without hesitation. "You know the passcode. When would I have time for anyone else?"

Cassandra’s stomach dropped.

"Mr. Sinclair—"
###Chapter 930

Evelyn was about to give a vague response. Knowing Preston's character, he wouldn't humiliate a woman like this.

But then she snatched his phone, entered the passcode, and opened his messages.

She searched for Cassandra's name—nothing.

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance. Preston smiled, unbothered. "Adding her was just politeness. The least I could do was delete her afterward."

Cassandra's face paled. She hadn't expected Preston to be so brutally honest.

She already knew he'd deleted her contact. Her multiple friend requests had gone ignored. But she hadn't anticipated a public confrontation.

Now, she'd truly backed herself into a corner.

Evelyn handed the phone back to Preston and gave Cassandra a frosty once-over.

Her lips curled in disdain. "Ms. Blake, I can recommend an excellent psychiatric facility specializing in delusional disorders."

Cassandra inhaled sharply, ready to retaliate—but Evelyn had already turned away.

She wasn't wasting another second on trash.

Face twisted in fury, Cassandra rushed after Preston as he moved to leave. She blinked up at him, lips trembling in a practiced pout. A blatant attempt at seduction.

"Mr. Sinclair, I don't understand what I did wrong. Why is Ms. Sinclair so upset? I only wanted to apologize and explain—"

Preston cut her off, voice icy.

"Drop the act. Desperate women will do anything for attention." Each word was a slap. Preston had pieced together how this woman had provoked Evelyn. Given the occasion, Evelyn had shown restraint—granting Cassandra a shred of dignity.

But Preston refused to let his woman swallow such disrespect. So he ripped off the mask and let Cassandra choke on the truth. His manners were reserved for equals—not wasted on insignificant pawns.

Without another glance, he walked away to find Evelyn.

Cassandra stood rooted, cheeks burning. No matter how thick-skinned she was, a man's outright rejection stung. She seethed inwardly. Two-faced bastard—just like Evelyn!

Nearby men, drawn by her revealing dress, approached with smirks. Swallowing her pride, Cassandra forced a smile and engaged.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood surrounded by guests—all influential figures who greeted her with genuine respect. Their admiration was for her presence, not her body.

Cassandra's grip tightened around her glass. Life wasn't fair.

A waiter approached. "Ms. Blake, the dresses for Miss Crest have arrived. Would you like to inspect them?"

Cassandra's gaze darkened. "I'll choose for her."

By the time Evelyn finished mingling, Cassandra had vanished. She shrugged it off.

Preston studied her. "Still upset about earlier?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Annoyed, yes. But the more miserable she is, the better I feel."

Amusement flickered in his eyes. "Want me to have a word with Pacific Crest's CEO? Get her fired?"

Evelyn shot him a look. "Abusing power for petty revenge? Didn't take you for the type."

She'd assumed a man of his principles was above such games.
###Chapter 931

Preston chuckled softly, his fingers brushing a stray lock behind Evelyn's ear.

"Anything to see you smile."

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks. Why was he whispering sweet nothings in the middle of a crowded gala?

Mortifying.

But she refused to let him see her flustered. Tilting her chin up, she arched a brow, lips curving.

"Even if it's arson? Murder?"

His grin widened. "Name the crime. I'll be your willing accomplice."

Always so ready to follow her lead.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, though the weight in her chest lightened. Setting down her champagne flute, she nudged him. "Restroom break."

Preston's fingers twitched toward hers. "Need an escort?"

"Seriously?" She shot him a look. "I'm not a toddler."

His lower lip jutted out. "I am."

The man was clingier than a koala.

Thankfully, their public dynamic hadn't shifted enough to raise eyebrows. But Evelyn wasn't about to indulge his PDA cravings with half the elite watching. Not when their relationship remained unannounced.

A warning glare silenced him before she strode toward the ladies' lounge.

The moment she stepped out, a blur of lilac silk crashed into her. The collision sent a teenage girl sprawling onto the marble, her short, ruffled dress hiking up indecently.

"Ugh! Watch where you're—" The girl's screech died as her gaze locked on Evelyn's identical shade of gown.

Evelyn extended a hand. "You okay?"

No apology. The girl had been the one barreling around the corner.

The stranger's eyes raked over Evelyn's floor-length silhouette—how the fabric draped elegantly over her slender frame compared to her own unflattering, thigh-grazing cut. A flush of envy darkened her cheeks.

With a huff, she slapped Evelyn's hand away and scrambled up.

Evelyn merely smiled and turned to leave.

"You're Evelyn Sinclair. Sterling Enterprises' COO."

Pausing, Evelyn glanced back. "That's me."

The girl's mouth twisted, but she stormed off without another word.

Odd.

Wasn't this the bathroom she'd been sprinting toward?

Evelyn watched her disappear into a nearby suite. Then—

"YOU scheming witch! You did this on purpose!" The girl's shriek rattled the crystal chandeliers. "Nicole's wearing the exact same color! Were you trying to humiliate me at my own birthday gala?"

A crash. Glass shattering.

Recognition clicked. This tantrum-throwing teen was Emily Crest—Pacific Crest Enterprises' heiress and tonight's honoree.

Fate's sense of humor was cruel.

"I saw her? How could I possibly know what she'd wear?" A familiar voice oozed faux innocence. "I just thought this style suited your—"

Evelyn's blood chilled.

Cassandra Blake.

"Liar! The stylist said you handpicked this disaster!" Emily's voice turned venomous. "Suddenly playing nice? Please. You're using me to get back at Evelyn, aren't you? Save the innocent act for Daddy—it doesn't work on me!"

Another crash. "GET OUT!"

The walls trembled from the volume.

But the real earthquake was the revelation tumbling from Emily's rage:

Cassandra was sleeping with Richard Crest.

And Evelyn had just stumbled upon their dirty secret.
###Chapter 932

The entire setup was Cassandra Blake's pathetic little trap.

Fate had other plans when the young heiress crossed paths with Evelyn Sinclair, whose sharp instincts saw through the scheme instantly.

The plot crumbled before it even began.

What an absolute fool Cassandra was. Utterly brainless.

Published by NovelDreams Publishing.

Evelyn couldn't help but wonder - how did someone so incompetent rise to such heights at Pacific Crest International?

Her thoughts were interrupted when the door suddenly swung open.

Cassandra was putting on a dramatic crying performance.

"I'll let your father explain everything! My intentions were pure—"

Her fake tears froze when she spotted Evelyn standing there, lips curved in that icy smile.

The mocking glint in Evelyn's eyes was unmistakable.

She'd heard everything.

Before Cassandra could react, a vase came flying at her back. The impact sent her stumbling forward in genuine pain.

The young woman pounced, yanking Cassandra's hair with practiced brutality.

Clearly, this wasn't her first time bullying someone.

"You dare tattle on me?" She sneered. "I've always hated your fake act. If you even think about seducing my father with that pig face of yours, I'll beat you to death first! Take this, bitch!"

A vicious kick landed in Cassandra's stomach. Grabbed by the hair, she couldn't fight back. The girl moved with the ruthless efficiency of someone accustomed to violence.

Cassandra's fake sobs turned real alarmingly fast.

When the beating finally stopped, the girl dusted her hands off with a cold scoff. She marched past the whimpering Cassandra without a shred of remorse.

Her arrogant stride suggested victorious revenge rather than guilt. Evelyn merely arched a brow.

Approaching the groaning woman, Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "I didn't plan to witness this spectacle, but I have one question."

Cassandra looked up. "What?"

"Are you addicted to being the other woman?"

The CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises was married. Evelyn distinctly remembered Cassandra's Canadian scandal involving another married man.

Cassandra gritted her teeth under Evelyn's mocking gaze. "Forget it," Evelyn sighed. "I'll call you an ambulance."

After making the call, Evelyn turned back. "Need me to notify anyone? Perhaps that girl's father?"

Cassandra panicked. "No!" With her swollen face, she wouldn't garner sympathy - only disgust.

She couldn't report this. Not when she'd schemed so hard for this position after leaving Pacific Crest.

Evelyn pocketed her phone with an icy smile. "Then enjoy your wait."

She stepped over Cassandra without a second glance.

Downstairs, Preston Sinclair approached, relief softening his features. "Why don't you just keep me in your pocket?" he joked.

Evelyn smirked. "You wouldn't fit."

As they walked, Evelyn kept glancing at the entrance.

Ten minutes later.

Two white-coated professionals rushed in, drawing curious stares.

Soon they emerged with a stretcher bearing a battered woman. "Isn't that Ms. Blake?" someone whispered.

"Looks like she got beaten up."

"By who?"

"Wait—those are psych ward uniforms!"
###Chapter 933

The white coats bore the unmistakable "San Francisco Psychiatric Hospital Welcomes You" logo on their backs.

Evelyn Sinclair sipped her wine with a serene smile, satisfaction curling through her veins.

Kindness? Forgiveness? Not her style.

The ambulance she'd arranged was perfect for Cassandra Blake.

That clever little vixen who'd thrown punches had won Evelyn's admiration.

Fake innocence deserved swift, decisive action—no explanations necessary.

Preston Sinclair leaned in, voice low. "Your doing?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "If it were me, you wouldn't see a scratch. Internal damage only."

Invisible pain was her specialty.

Preston chuckled, relieved. "She had it coming. Half the room probably wants to hit her. Consider it payback."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "I don't hold grudges. You make me sound petty."

"Then I'll be petty for both of us," he teased.

Their banter didn't escape the notice of a certain observer.

Nathan Blackwood's murderous aura could've frozen the room. "Are they together?"

His icy glare locked onto the pair as the CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises swallowed hard. "No, Ms. Sinclair arrived first. Mr. Sinclair came later. Just coincidence."

Nathan's expression darkened further.

Mitchell's intel was never wrong. Their casual intimacy felt like a public taunt. His chest constricted, breath turning ragged.

Tristan Whitmore offered a weak smile. "Small world. People cross paths."

Nathan drained his glass in one go and stalked forward without a word.

Tristan's stomach dropped. "Shit." He hurried after him.

Nathan's smile was glacial as he approached, the air thickening with tension.

Evelyn's forced politeness when she noticed him cut deeper than any blade.

His voice was deceptively light. "I heard about your injury. From the mountains."

Preston had warned her. She kept her tone pleasant. "Just a scratch. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Blackwood."

The storm in his eyes betrayed nothing.

Watching her stand beside another man was agony—a visceral, carving pain. But he schooled his features, burying the jealousy festering in his chest.

So this was what it felt like.

He stepped closer. "Of course I worried. Lost sleep when you didn't reply." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Almost died from it."
###Chapter 934

Nathan's voice dropped to a husky whisper, deliberately coaxing as he inched closer to Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyelid twitched. Something was definitely off about Nathan tonight.

Her gaze instinctively darted to Preston beside her. The usually warm and composed Wall Street tycoon now wore an icy expression.

Noticing Evelyn's reaction, Nathan's face darkened further.

Just as he suspected...

Evelyn forced a polite smile, her tone carefully detached. "My doctor restricted phone use during recovery. It slipped my mind after discharge. My apologies."

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly. He recognized the excuse for what it was, yet had no choice but to accept it.

"That's alright. Seeing you standing here unharmed is relief enough."

The orchestra began playing a waltz.

Nathan's eyes gleamed as he abruptly extended his hand. "May I have this dance?"

Evelyn remained motionless, silently observing his outstretched palm with an amused smile.

Their first dance had been at a post-divorce gala, back when her true identity remained concealed.

How swiftly things changed. Now another man stood by her side. As she hesitated, a second elegant hand appeared before her. Preston smiled gently. "I'd also like to request this dance with Ms. Sinclair."

Preston wouldn't let Nathan steal this moment. Nathan's expression turned thunderous as he glared at his rival.

"Mr. Sinclair, haven't you heard of first come, first served?" Preston arched a brow calmly. "I only know opportunity shouldn't be wasted." Both men awaited Evelyn's decision, the concept of priority irrelevant now. Without hesitation, Evelyn chose Preston.

Just as her fingers brushed Preston's, Nathan suddenly seized her wrist. His grip was punishing, eyes burning with intensity.

Evelyn winced, unable to break free as pain shot through her arm.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

Preston's expression darkened instantly as he grabbed Nathan's forearm. "Show some respect!" Nathan shrugged him off violently, pent-up rage erupting. "Back off!"

Then he dragged Evelyn toward the exit. "We need to talk!"

His restraint had reached its limit watching them together. Every second in Preston's presence tempted him to violence.

But Evelyn wrenched free with a sharp movement. "Mr. Blackwood, we have nothing to discuss." When it came to emotions, Evelyn never wavered. She'd made her stance clear since their divorce.

What more could she do when he refused to accept it?

Fortunately, the music drowned their confrontation, sparing them from becoming the evening's spectacle.

Evelyn had no interest in starring in some melodramatic scene.

Nathan froze momentarily. His gaze darkened, breath turning ragged. "Evelyn, why him?"

Why choose Preston?

Her voice remained steady. "Because he's my boyfriend. Mr. Blackwood, I expect you to treat him with courtesy moving forward."

Preston's eyes flickered with surprise at her direct acknowledgment before Nathan. He'd prepared for evasiveness, yet she claimed him openly.

Boyfriend?

The word made Preston feel their relationship had accelerated unexpectedly.

Nathan's face turned to stone, his glare at Preston murderous. "Boyfriend?"
###Chapter 935

The atmosphere grew thick with tension. A creeping chill seemed to seep into Nathan Blackwood's bones.

His words came out through clenched teeth. Each syllable felt like a dagger twisting in his chest.

Preston Sinclair stepped forward with a polished smile.

"I'm honored to be her boyfriend. Mr. Blackwood, I suggest you keep your distance from my girlfriend from now on."

The warning tasted sweet on his tongue - especially with the weight of Evelyn Sinclair's boyfriend title behind it.

Nathan's eyes burned crimson.

Rage threatened to consume him, but he wrestled his emotions under control.

Even as his heart bled, he refused to humiliate Evelyn publicly.

The thought of her seeing him lose control terrified him.

He inhaled sharply, pinning her with an intense stare. "Come outside. You know what happens if you refuse."

With that, Nathan turned on his heel and left.

The garden lay silent and frigid, the night air biting against exposed skin.

He stood shrouded in shadows, his expression unreadable in the darkness.

Evelyn hesitated, a knot forming in her stomach.

If she didn't clarify things now, Nathan would burn everything to the ground.

The situation would spiral beyond control. She knew his capabilities - consequences never restrained Nathan Blackwood.

But she and Preston would inevitably get caught in the crossfire. Preston studied her face. "Don't go. I'll handle this."

Evelyn gave a wry smile. "It's better if I talk to him. He won't back down otherwise."

Preston frowned but eventually nodded.

His gaze softened. "I'll wait by the door. We'll leave as soon as you're finished."

Evelyn agreed. There was no reason to linger here any longer. She deliberately wrapped her coat tighter before stepping outside.

The contrast was stark - from the lively warmth inside to the desolate cold.

Her voice cut through the silence. "Nathan Blackwood, this is your last warning. If you threaten me again, you'll learn what real consequences feel like."

She complied not out of fear, but to avoid unnecessary complications.

Hopefully the stubborn man would finally get the message.

Nathan's posture stiffened. He turned slowly, his gaze heavy with restrained emotion - longing and resentment tangled together.

"When have I ever dared threaten you? A single frown from you makes me question my every action."

A bitter laugh escaped him, his eyes glistening.

He'd fought so hard to win her back. Why couldn't she spare him even a glance?

The agony felt like having his soul ripped from his body.

Evelyn remained silent for a beat before meeting his gaze squarely.

"Let's not waste time. I'll make this clear. Nathan Blackwood, our marriage ended. I choose who I want now. Your acceptance means nothing to me. Don't embarrass yourself with petty interference."

Her warning was explicit - sabotage her relationship, and she'd retaliate in kind.

Nathan's smile froze then vanished, his expression turning unreadable.

Was she really this desperate to protect that damned Preston Sinclair?

"Why? Because he rescued you? Because he showers you with pretty lies? Do you actually believe those internet rumors are baseless? That illegitimate child of his isn't just gossip, is it?"

His eyes remained sharp, though his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.
###Chapter 936

Evelyn had only been saved twice by Preston out of sheer coincidence. Nathan couldn't fathom what else she saw in him.

Gratitude wasn't love.

He wanted Evelyn to realize that. To not mistake indebtedness for affection.

Evelyn was silent for a beat before her voice dropped low.

"I'm with him because I know who he is. I don't owe anyone an explanation."

Oliver Sinclair's existence could be considered a stain on Preston's past.

But Evelyn had never cared. It only made her heart ache for him.

Nathan's fist clenched, then unclenched.

His voice was rough. "I'd risk my life for you too, Evelyn." The words were almost desperate.

Evelyn's gaze flickered as she regarded him coolly.

"Mr. Blackwood, we've already proven we're not compatible. Stop wasting your time. Let's just keep this professional."

Before she could finish, Preston finally stepped forward. His hand settled on her shoulder, his touch cool.

"The car's here. Shall we go?"

Evelyn nodded, acutely aware of Nathan's icy stare. "Goodbye, Mr. Blackwood."

"You'll regret this, Evelyn."

Nathan's jaw was tight, his usually composed demeanor edged with something darker.

Evelyn frowned, but Preston wasn't leaving without the last word.

He turned, his smile sharp. "No, she won't. Not ever."

Because Preston would spend his life making sure of it. He'd love her fiercely, relentlessly. He wouldn't give her a single reason to look back.

Before Evelyn could react, Preston guided her away.

The driver pulled up, and Preston opened the door for her, his movements precise. He slid in beside her, his expression unreadable.

"Drive."

Evelyn studied him. Something was off.

She glanced at him. "Did you tell Mr. Crest we were leaving?"

Preston nodded. "I did."

Evelyn bit her lip. A strand of hair slipped loose, and as she reached to tuck it back, her fingers brushed Preston's.

He gently fixed it for her, exhaled softly, then laced their fingers together.

His grip was tight. Nervous.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn asked.

Preston's hold tightened further.

His voice was low. "Watching you with him... I regretted letting you come tonight."

He knew how deeply she'd once loved Nathan. Knew how fragile this all still was.

Seeing them together had sparked a fear—what if she changed her mind?

It had clawed at him until he'd acted on impulse, pulling her away.

That fear still lingered.

Evelyn understood instantly.

He was afraid of losing her because she hadn't given him enough security in their relationship.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

She smiled. "Then don't let me go out next time. But Mr. Sinclair, have a little faith in yourself."

If she'd wanted Nathan back, she wouldn't have waited this long.

That chapter was closed. There was no going back.

Preston's grip eased slightly. "No matter what Nathan does, promise me we won't break up."

Evelyn met his gaze, her smile softening.

"Don't worry about him. He doesn't matter."
###Chapter 937

Preston Sinclair's lips curved into a warm smile when he heard her words.

Relief washed over him completely.

Evelyn Sinclair had never once said "I love you" to him before. Yet here she was, already willing to open her heart.

That was enough.

Nathan Blackwood didn't matter anymore. No matter what he did, he would never win Evelyn back.

Preston held her hand firmly, refusing to let go.

Though Evelyn wasn’t accustomed to it, she didn’t pull away.

He walked her to her door but didn’t step inside.

His gaze softened as he looked at her. "Goodnight, Evelyn." His own apartment was just upstairs—so close.

She smiled and waved. "Goodnight."

They stood there, neither making the first move to leave. "You go first?" Evelyn suggested.

Preston shook his head. "You go in first."

A brief, playful standoff ensued, and Evelyn’s cheeks flushed pink. Then, the sudden ringing of her phone inside broke the tension.

"Okay, I’ll go in first!" She practically fled inside, relieved for the distraction.

As the door clicked shut behind her, Evelyn hesitated. Had she forgotten to close it?

Preston gently pushed it shut for her. He lingered for a moment before finally walking away.

The call was from Isabella Montgomery.

Evelyn answered with a smile. "Hello?"

Instead of a greeting, choked sobs came through the line. "Evelyn," Isabella gasped between cries, "I’ve been made a mistress! Donovan was already married!"

Evelyn froze. Before she could demand an explanation, Donovan’s furious voice cut in.

"Who the hell are you calling? I told you I’d handle this!"

Isabella screamed back, her voice raw with betrayal. "Handle it? You lying bastard! We’re done! Evelyn, come get me—I’m at—"

The line went dead with a crash.

Evelyn immediately redialed, only to hear the automated message: The number you have called is currently unavailable.

Her expression darkened. She grabbed her keys and rushed out.

Donovan had clearly taken Isabella’s phone—and possibly her freedom.

Evelyn dialed Natalie Beaumont. "Isabella’s being held by Donovan. Do you know where he is right now?"

She cursed herself for not vetting Donovan Pierce properly. If she had, Isabella wouldn’t be in this mess.

Natalie hesitated, startled. Evelyn quickly summarized the call.

"Wait—I remember," Natalie said. "Isabella once asked me to deliver a gift to Donovan’s place. I still have the address. I’ll text it to you. Meet me at the entrance."

Evelyn agreed and hung up. No time for more words.

She took the elevator down to the parking garage, got into her car, and sped toward the address Natalie sent.

On the way, she contacted her security team.

Alexander Sterling called almost instantly. "What’s going on? Why are you mobilizing the guards?"

Evelyn wasn’t surprised he knew. "Isabella’s in trouble. Donovan’s restraining her. I’m heading there now—I need backup."

"Be careful," Alexander said tersely before ending the call.

Evelyn exhaled, her chest tight with frustration.

The address wasn’t far. But the high-end neighborhood had tight security. She worried she’d be stopped at the gate.

When she arrived, something about the place felt familiar.

The guards took one look at her car and immediately lifted the barrier.

"Welcome home, Ms. Sinclair—"

Oh. Right. She owned a property here too.
###Chapter 938

Evelyn Sinclair gave a composed nod, her gaze steady on them.

"My security team will arrive shortly. Let them through when they come."

Without hesitation, she drove straight through the gates.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of her car, Natalie Beaumont came rushing toward her.

Their eyes met in silent understanding. Before either could speak, blinding headlights suddenly illuminated them from behind.

Evelyn whirled around to face three black SUVs blocking her path.

A dozen stone-faced men in matching tactical gear emerged. Their military precision betrayed their professional training.

Sterling family security.

Then Alexander Sterling exited the lead vehicle, his expression unreadable as he approached.

"Move out."

Natalie seemed momentarily stunned by the show of force but quickly recovered. Having just Evelyn and herself would've been risky. Evelyn hadn't expected Alexander's personal involvement, but rescuing Isabella took priority.

They reached the front door.

Natalie knocked sharply. A middle-aged housekeeper cracked it open slightly. "Who are you looking for?"

"Is Isabella Montgomery here?" Evelyn demanded.

The servant's face paled. Clearly briefed, she stammered, "N-no, she's not—I don't know anyone by that name."

Natalie scoffed.

Patience spent, she shoved the door wider. "Isabella! Are you here?"

The words barely left her lips when Natalie froze. Two hulking bodyguards materialized before them.

Their menacing glares confirmed Sean Donovan's preparations.

But Alexander moved faster. With one powerful kick, he shattered the doorframe, his team flooding in behind him. The house guards blanched at their numbers.

Evelyn strode past the trembling maid. "Where's Sean?" The servant clutched her phone, too terrified to answer.

The air turned glacial.

"Find Isabella," Evelyn ordered Natalie. "She has to be here."

Natalie advanced—only for a guard to block her path. Seeing their disadvantage, he lunged to grab her.

Evelyn struck first.

Her lightning kick sent him crashing into a console table. Crystal shattered.

The second guard charged, but Alexander intercepted him. Three precise strikes had the man stumbling backward, toppling a lamp.

Sterling security swarmed them, overwhelming the outnumbered guards within seconds.

As others fanned out to search, the maid frantically dialed her phone.

Evelyn ignored her. Then Natalie's cry pierced the chaos.

"Evelyn! She's here!"

They rushed to a locked bedroom. The door wouldn't budge.

"I heard Isabella!" Natalie pressed her ear to the wood. "She's inside!"

Their combined efforts proved useless against the reinforced frame.

Evelyn turned toward the cowering maid—just as Sean's voice crackled through the phone still clutched in her shaking hands.

"Helen? Has Ms. Montgomery eaten yet?"
###Chapter 939

Beatrice Winslow's face drained of color. Her lips quivered under Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont's icy glares.

"Sir, there are people here—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn snatched the phone. Arctic fury burned in her eyes as she spoke with lethal clarity.

"Donovan Pierce, get your ass over here and die."

How dare he lay hands on her best friend on her turf? The man had a death wish.

Evelyn didn't have many friends, but those she did have were ride-or-die. They'd weathered storms together, and she'd burn the world to protect them.

The phone shattered against the marble floor.

From behind the locked door, Isabella Montgomery's weak sobs cut through the air like broken glass. Each whimper stabbed Evelyn's heart.

She threw her shoulder against the reinforced door three times. No give.

Alexander Sterling signaled his bodyguard. The brute kicked at the hinges—useless. This wasn't any ordinary door. It required a key or remained impenetrable.

Evelyn's gaze snapped to Beatrice. "Key. Now."

The old woman clutched her pocket. A dead giveaway.

"I—I don't have it!" Beatrice stammered, backing away.

Natalie snarled, "Stop lying or we'll take it from your cold, wrinkled hands!"

"You wouldn't dare assault an elderly woman!"

Evelyn's laugh was colder than a winter grave. She advanced, every step measured. "Illegal confinement carries a five-year sentence. Fancy dining on prison slop at your age?"

Beatrice's face cycled through shades of gray.

Alexander nodded to his bodyguard. The man moved like lightning—twisting Beatrice's arm behind her back until bone popped. Her scream echoed off the walls.

Two other guards already lay subdued, faces mashed into the carpet.

The remaining bodyguard fished the key from Beatrice's pocket and presented it to Evelyn with a bow.

She took it, staring down at the weeping woman. "I prefer handling problems personally. Age doesn't grant you immunity from consequences. Learn some damn manners before you meet your maker."

Beatrice cradled her dislocated arm, wailing. The terror in her eyes said she'd finally understood—this elegant young socialite was far more dangerous than her designer clothes suggested.

Evelyn strode to the door, turned the key.

The sight inside shattered her.

Isabella—socialite darling, her radiant best friend—sat crumpled in a chair. Pale. Hollow-eyed. A ghost of herself.

When their eyes met, Isabella's face crumpled. Then she spotted Alexander behind Evelyn and froze.

The air turned to ice.

Alexander frowned. "Can you walk? We're leaving."

Isabella bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. Then she lunged at Evelyn, collapsing into her arms with a sob.

Of all people, Alexander had come for her. After everything. How was she supposed to stay indifferent?

Evelyn's vision blurred. Isabella hung limp in her arms, legs buckling.

She shot Alexander a glare over her shoulder.

"She can't walk. She's completely drained."
###Chapter 940

Alexander's brow furrowed as he approached. His expression was tightly controlled, but his gaze froze when he spotted the tiny puncture mark on Isabella's arm. The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

"Did Donovan inject you?" His voice was arctic.

The answer was obvious. Their circle had particularly vile methods for dealing with rebellious women.

A drug that drained all strength while keeping the victim fully conscious. Unable to resist. Isabella had clearly been given such an injection.

Silent tears rolled down Isabella's cheeks as she nodded.

She'd chosen him. She deserved this.

The collective intake of breath was audible.

Evelyn trembled with barely contained rage. The air around Alexander turned glacial.

He stepped forward, extending his arms. "I'll carry her. You go first."

Evelyn took a steadying breath before touching Isabella's shoulder. "Don't be afraid, Isabella. We're leaving now."

Donovan would return soon. If he brought reinforcements, they'd be in trouble.

After all, he'd already imprisoned Isabella. What other depraved acts was he capable of?

Just thinking about that brooding, volatile face made Evelyn's blood run cold.

Only someone as naive as Isabella would trust him. Only she could develop feelings as fleeting as fireworks for a man like that. Her red, swollen eyes were heartbreaking.

"Let's go," Isabella whispered weakly.

Alexander lifted her bridal-style. They'd just reached the living room when heavy, urgent footsteps echoed at the entrance. Donovan had arrived.

Faster than expected.

"Sir!" Beatrice cried out dramatically. "They're taking Ms. Montgomery! They attacked me!"

Donovan surveyed the wreckage - the overturned furniture, his unconscious bodyguards. His dark eyes burned with cold fury before locking onto Isabella in Alexander's arms.

"She's not leaving." His sharp tone cut through the room as he blocked their path.

His expression was thunderous, emotions churning behind those obsidian eyes.

"Put my woman down, Mr. Sterling."

Alexander's bodyguards closed ranks around Donovan. Alexander's glare could have frozen hell. "Your woman? Donovan, are you even a man? Isabella Montgomery isn't some plaything you can discard. Remember that."

If Isabella had been nobody, she'd have no recourse after Donovan's mistreatment.

But she wasn't nobody. The Montgomerys were San Francisco royalty. Her mother ruled the business world with an iron fist. Who would dare disrespect her?

Was Donovan truly this reckless?

Donovan's cold stare met Alexander's. "This doesn't concern you."

A clear warning to stay out of their affairs.

Evelyn had no patience left. "Enough. We'll discuss this later. The hospital first."

The bodyguards moved to clear the path. But Donovan struck first - a vicious kick sent the nearest guard flying.

His movements were lethal, precise. The remaining guards charged. Bloodlust gleamed in his eyes as he dispatched three, four men with brutal efficiency. Mere bodyguards were no match for his skills.

After neutralizing the last guard, Donovan lunged at Alexander with cold intent.

Alexander stood firm, face like carved ice. Evelyn braced herself on the sidelines.

Just steps away, Isabella suddenly gritted her teeth. With tremendous effort, she rasped:

"Donovan Pierce, if you lay one finger on me, I swear I'll destroy your entire family. Starting with your deranged mother!"
###Chapter 941

Donovan's eyes widened in shock. His body froze mid-movement as Alexander's bodyguards rushed forward.

Five men pinned him down effortlessly.

His bloodshot gaze locked onto Isabella.

"I told you I'd file for divorce. Couldn't you wait one more day?"

Her voice cracked from crying. A raw, gut-wrenching scream tore from her throat.

"Screw your divorce! I was an idiot to believe you. Go back to your wife. You don't deserve me!"

How had she not seen it before? The man was rotten to the core.

She wanted to claw his deceitful face apart.

The air turned icy.

Donovan flinched violently. Alexander gave him one cold glance before sweeping Isabella into his arms and striding out.

The door slammed shut behind them. A hollow silence filled the space.

Donovan's expression darkened. His eyes turned stormy, his mood plummeting.

Beatrice stood trembling, ignoring the pain in her dislocated arm. Tears and snot streaked her face.

"Sir—"

"Who told you to do this?" His voice was flat. "I ordered you not to open that door."

The calmer he sounded, the more terrifying he became—like staring into an abyss.

His dead-eyed stare suffocated her. Beatrice looked up at his shadowed face. "Lie to me, and I'll take your other arm too."

She stiffened. She'd seen how the wealthy operated—no mercy, no second chances. Why was she suffering like this in her old age?

After a tense pause, she choked out the truth.

"Your wife made me do it. She said you'd dump Ms. Montgomery eventually, and I'd lose my job. If I helped her, she'd hire me permanently. Double my salary. Even get my son a position. All I had to do was let her people in..."

"Her people?"

"She said she'd send someone to take Ms. Montgomery away..." Her voice faded to a whisper.

Donovan's face twisted. He turned sharply and stormed out.

When Isabella left, it felt like his heart had been ripped out.

Should he be grateful Alexander got there first?

At the hospital, Isabella underwent tests while Evelyn and Natalie waited outside.

Alexander had already left with his security team.

Evelyn was about to call Bennett to dig into Donovan's past when her phone buzzed.

Preston.

She hesitated before answering, forcing calm into her voice.

"Hello?"

Preston's warm tone carried concern. "I brought you a midnight snack, but you weren't home. Where are you?"

Evelyn exhaled. "The hospital."

"What happened?" Alarm spiked in his voice.

She gave a brief explanation, intending to reassure him and hang up. He had work tomorrow.

But Preston cut in firmly. "I'm coming. Send me the address."

The line went dead before she could protest.

Evelyn sighed.

She'd never noticed before—Preston could be downright domineering.

Resigned, she texted him the location.

Natalie stood and handed Evelyn her phone.

"I had someone investigate Donovan Pierce. A business contact knows him. Said he's ruthless, emotionless, and manipulative. He's Vincent Delacroix's illegitimate son—the chairman of Celestial Media..."
###Chapter 942

Evelyn studied the document, her expression darkening.

The memory surfaced vividly. Cassandra Delacroix, the heiress of Celestial Media, had foolishly provoked her.

Back then, Evelyn had leveraged her family's influence to crush Celestial Media, leaving them barely clinging to survival.

"Did Donovan conceal his identity to avenge his father?"

Natalie shook her head. "I doubt it's revenge. He barely interacts with Vincent, and this identity doesn't benefit him. His mother's family backs him. The Pierces were struggling, especially in the early years—clear signs of decline. But their fortunes reversed recently, likely due to Donovan's efforts."

She hadn't expected Vincent Delacroix of Celestial Media to have such a formidable illegitimate son.

He outshone Cassandra by miles.

Natalie paused, lowering her voice with a sigh.

"He married some nouveau riche's daughter, but rumors say their marriage is strained. Probably because he's obsessed with wealth. He barely visits his wife—maybe once a year. Poor Isabella suffered such injustice!"

Evelyn nodded.

Isabella might enjoy playing around, but she never crossed moral boundaries.

Donovan was despicable for dragging her into this mess.

Moments later, Preston rushed in.

A cold aura clung to him, as if the night had seeped into his bones. In his hand, he carried a large Hermès bag—clearly repurposed for groceries. He handed it to Evelyn.

"I thought you might be cold, so I brought you some clothes."

Evelyn opened it. Though the bag was feminine, the clothes inside were unmistakably Preston's.

He hesitated. "I was in a hurry. Couldn’t get to your place, so I brought mine. Bear with it for now."

Evelyn smiled. She’d left abruptly, still in her evening gown. The thin coat she wore was useless against the chill. These clothes were a godsend.

Preston helped her into them, their eyes meeting with quiet understanding.

Natalie scoffed. "Watching you two makes my teeth ache."

Evelyn blinked. "Why?"

"Too sweet."

No filter. Evelyn shot her a look, but Natalie was already scrutinizing Preston.

Preston finished buttoning Evelyn’s coat and turned to Natalie with a smile. "You haven’t eaten, right? I’ll grab food so Ms. Montgomery can eat when she wakes."

Under normal circumstances, they’d have refused.

What shops were open at this hour?

Sending him out would just inconvenience him.

But he’d mentioned Isabella—how she’d refused meals at Donovan’s place. She was probably starving.

Evelyn nodded. "Don’t go far. Just get whatever’s available. If nothing’s open, come back. I’ll have the butler send something."

Preston smiled and left. Natalie shook her head.

"Mr. Sinclair is so attentive with you. But be careful. Don’t let temporary sweetness blind you like Isabella did."

Evelyn chuckled. "I know. He’s not that type."

Natalie frowned, holding back words.

Evelyn wasn’t Isabella.

And Preston wasn’t Donovan.

The doctor wheeled Isabella back into the ward. Her face was swollen, red as a boiled lobster—pitiful.

"Doctor, how is she?"
###Chapter 943

The doctor's lips curved into a reassuring smile. "Ms. Montgomery's vitals are stable, though traces of the injected substances remain in her system. Full recovery should take approximately eight to nine hours. She's running a slight fever, but the medication we administered will reduce it shortly."

Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont exchanged relieved glances.

Their timely intervention had clearly made the difference.

Once the medical staff departed, the two women settled into chairs beside Isabella's hospital bed, observing their friend's restless state.

Even unconscious, Isabella was muttering curses directed at Donovan Pierce. Words like "filthy bastard" and "rot in hell" slipped through her feverish lips.

Evelyn and Natalie shared an amused look. Most people would be devastated after such an ordeal. But not Isabella Montgomery - her mind immediately turned to vengeance!

Less than thirty minutes later, Preston Sinclair returned bearing food.

Evelyn noted the distinctive packaging from Le Ciel Privé - an exclusive eatery where reservations typically required months of advance notice. Yet Preston had somehow convinced them to prepare a midnight meal?

Before she could voice her surprise, Natalie's sharp eyes caught the logo. "Isn't this place booked solid for the next six months? How did you manage this?"

Preston's expression remained composed, though warmth flickered in his gaze. "Everyone's been through an ordeal tonight, especially our patient here. I thought you all deserved proper sustenance." He set the containers on the side table. "The owner happens to be an old friend. Made two portions - one for when Ms. Montgomery wakes, and another for you ladies now."

Evelyn couldn't help the swell of pride at her boyfriend's thoughtfulness.

Natalie appeared visibly moved, clearly reconsidering her previous warnings to Evelyn about being cautious with Preston. The Wall Street tycoon even went so far as to arrange the cutlery, stopping just short of hand-feeding Evelyn.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. This level of attention would have been embarrassing enough in private, but with Natalie witnessing everything? Did the man possess no sense of restraint?

"Let's eat before it gets cold," Evelyn said quickly, avoiding Preston's gaze.

Natalie took her seat with deliberate calm, arching an eyebrow at Evelyn's flushed face. "You're looking rather feverish yourself. Should we call the doctor back?"

Preston paused mid-motion, studying Evelyn with sudden concern. She shot Natalie a glare. "It's just warm in here. Eat your food."

As Natalie complied with exaggerated innocence, Preston's lips curved into a knowing smile. Had they been alone, he would have teased her mercilessly about that blush.

After the meal, Preston efficiently cleared the containers. Though Evelyn suggested he return home, he refused, equally unwilling to leave her side. He knew better than to ask Evelyn to abandon Isabella, so he settled for catching some rest in the adjacent room.

At dawn, Preston returned with fresh clothes for Evelyn, finding her dozing in a recliner. He hesitated to wake her, content to simply watch - as though memorizing every detail of her peaceful expression.

Isabella's fever had broken overnight, leaving her restless but alert. The first thing she saw upon waking was Preston's lovestruck gaze fixed on Evelyn.

Her groan shattered the tranquil moment. "Must you two be so disgustingly adorable?"

The sound startled both women awake, ending the peaceful interlude.
###Chapter 944

The first rays of dawn painted the hospital room in soft gold when Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Beside her, Natalie Beaumont blinked sleep from her eyes. Preston Sinclair's gaze darkened momentarily before clearing.

No irritation touched his features. Even if Isabella Montgomery had disturbed Evelyn's rest, it hadn't been intentional.

Evelyn rose and approached the bed where Isabella lay, her complexion now healthy with color.

Those determined eyes shone bright, though her voice remained frail - likely from hunger. "You're awake? How are you feeling?"

Recognition flickered across Isabella's face as memories resurfaced, dimming her sparkle momentarily.

"I'm starving," she murmured weakly.

Relief washed over Evelyn and Natalie as Preston arranged a meal tray.

While they set up the bedside table, Isabella mumbled, "Alexander isn't here?"

Evelyn froze mid-motion. Isabella bit her lip, eyes glistening.

"I remember him saving me. I wanted to thank him personally."

She'd buried the agony of unrequited love deep. Yet this memory - Alexander protecting her, holding her close for the first time - made her dormant heart flutter awake.

What if...just what if he felt something too? For that slim chance, she'd risk everything.

Evelyn hesitated under Isabella's hopeful gaze.

"Alexander had business, but he'll visit later." She understood Isabella's longing too well to judge. Natalie sighed beside them.

"Darling, you really must sharpen your instincts. Donovan Pierce never seemed trustworthy. I warned you, but you accused me of snap judgments."

Isabella's expression crumpled momentarily. "I was blind. Every kindness I believed came from him was just manipulation."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "When we were stranded, he had helicopters but refused to use them - afraid his wife would find out. He let me crawl through mud instead. How could I have been so foolish?"

Natalie squeezed her shoulder. "Cut ties completely this time. Consider it a painful lesson learned."

Fury flashed in Isabella's eyes. Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "If you want revenge rather than moving on, we'll help you make him pay."

A Montgomery heiress shouldn't swallow her pride.

Isabella lifted her chin. "I'll tell you if I need help." No false pleasantries between them.

Evelyn smiled as Isabella inhaled deeply. "Alright, I'm eating now. Were you two here all night?"

She blinked at Preston behind Evelyn. "Mr. Sinclair, you stayed too?"

Preston chuckled. "I napped in the adjacent lounge. These two bore the night watch."

Evelyn glanced at him. "You should head to the office. We'll leave soon."

When Preston hesitated, Evelyn clicked her tongue and ushered him out.

"Girl talk incoming. You'll just cramp our style."

Amusement crinkled his eyes. Apparently, he'd been the third wheel.

At the threshold, he turned back suddenly. "Call if you need anything?"

Evelyn nodded impatiently.

Preston's tender smile lingered, reluctance evident in his stance.

Behind Evelyn, Natalie and Isabella's amused stares burned her cheeks.

Recognizing her discomfort, Preston finally relented - but not before catching her hand for one lingering caress.

Heat flooded Evelyn's face. Was Preston Sinclair making a habit of stealing these intimate moments?
###Chapter 945

Before Evelyn could react, Preston Sinclair had already released her hand as if nothing had happened.

He gave a polite nod to the others in the room before turning to leave, a faint smile lingering in his eyes.

His retreating figure was composed, betraying no hint of the subtle gesture he had just made.

Evelyn clicked her tongue in silent amusement before facing the room again.

The moment she turned, she found Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont grinning at her with knowing looks.

Natalie arched a brow. "Mr. Sinclair moves fast. You two are already this close? Should we expect wedding bells soon?"

Evelyn shot her a warning glance.

"Focus on Isabella's situation, will you? You're missing the point!"

Isabella couldn't help but laugh. "Nice deflection, Evelyn. Are you prioritizing love over your career now?"

Evelyn straightened, her tone firm.

"They're not mutually exclusive. My career comes first—love is just a bonus."

"Hopeless romantic," they chorused. Evelyn rolled her eyes.

After Isabella finished her meal, Natalie received an urgent call from her company. Something had come up.

"Isabella, I have to head to the office. I can't stay with you. You should be discharged soon—want me to arrange a ride home?"

Isabella shook her head. "I can't leave yet. My mother needs to see how miserable I look, or she'll kill me later."

Natalie sighed in exasperation before turning to Evelyn. "Keep an eye on her, then? I have to go."

Evelyn nodded in agreement.

The moment Natalie left, Alexander Sterling arrived.

Evelyn had texted him earlier, informing him of Isabella's condition and suggesting he visit when he had time. She knew Isabella was stubbornly waiting for him—as if demanding some kind of resolution.

Alexander knocked before entering.

Isabella's eyes brightened momentarily, only to dim when she saw who followed him inside.

Evelyn stood, greeting them smoothly. "Alexander, Amelia, you're here."

She hadn't expected Alexander to bring Amelia, but she kept her expression neutral.

Alexander gave a curt nod, his usual detached demeanor intact.

He turned to Isabella. "How are you feeling, Ms. Montgomery?"

Isabella tensed, torn between relief and disappointment. She forced a weak smile. "Much better, thank you."

Evelyn could see the sadness she was trying to hide.

Behind Alexander, Amelia stepped forward, her gentle beauty radiating warmth.

"Wishing you a speedy recovery, Ms. Montgomery."

Isabella managed a faint smile. "Thank you, Amelia. I didn't expect you to visit."

Amelia glanced at Alexander playfully. "My car broke down, so he had to pick me up. I offered to wait outside, but he probably didn’t trust me not to steal his car again."

Alexander shot her an exasperated but fond look.

"After the first two times? I wasn’t taking any chances."

His tone carried unmistakable affection.

Amelia laughed sheepishly.

Though they weren’t physically close, the way they looked at each other softened Alexander’s usual coldness.

Isabella’s smile turned brittle, but she masked it quickly.

She lowered her gaze, shielding the emotions in her eyes.

Evelyn sighed inwardly before speaking lightly.

"Isabella’s fever just broke. She ate a little, but she’s still weak. She needs rest."
###Chapter 946

Alexander Sterling gave a curt nod, his features unreadable.

"Get some rest. If you need assistance with Donovan, ask Evelyn."

Isabella Montgomery's face paled slightly. She pressed her lips together before lifting her gaze to meet his.

"Thank you for your help, Alexander."

His brow furrowed, but he nodded again.

"Don't mention it. You're Evelyn's friend, and our families have business ties. It's only natural."

The light in Isabella's eyes dimmed instantly.

At that moment, she realized how pointless it all was.

Among the countless reasons Alexander had helped her, not one was because she was Isabella.

Of course. What right did she have?

Evelyn Sinclair pursed her lips. "Big Brother, if you and Amelia have work, go ahead. I'll take Isabella home later."

Alexander had no desire to linger. With a final nod, he took Amelia's hand and left.

Before the door closed, Amelia cast a fleeting glance back at Isabella.

But there was no scrutiny in that look—only polite gentleness.

Evelyn shut the door behind them and exhaled.

When she turned back, Isabella's tears had already begun to fall. Evelyn watched as her shoulders trembled silently. Today marked the end of an unrequited love.

"Cry if you need to. I'll take you home after."

Isabella lifted her tear-filled eyes.

"Evelyn… am I really that unworthy? Is that why he won’t even look at me?"

"Of course not."

Isabella drew a shaky breath.

"I never had the courage to say what I wanted. I wasted time with people I didn’t even like. No wonder everyone thinks I’m shallow." She swallowed hard. "I know you meant well. I was the one who hoped for too much. No matter how many years pass, Amelia is still the only one who can move him."

Her voice cracked.

"I give up."

She surrendered.

Her self-indulgent affection had only ever hurt herself. Alexander helped her because of Evelyn. Why keep lying?

She wasn’t the type to fight for someone who didn’t want her. If she were, she wouldn’t have lost her mind over Donovan’s marriage in the first place.

At the thought of Donovan, Isabella wiped her tears, her expression hardening.

"I want to be discharged. Evelyn, I need your help."

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "Name it."

After eating, Isabella regained enough strength to leave the hospital swiftly.

She took Evelyn to an exclusive club.

Just as Evelyn was about to ask why they were there, Isabella spoke first.

"Donovan is signing a contract with Blackwood Industries today. Once it’s finalized, his business will be officially established in San Francisco."

Her grip tightened.

"With Blackwood Industries backing him, he’ll gain power fast. I won’t let that happen."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

The moment she heard "Blackwood Industries," she regretted coming.

But it was too late to back out now—Isabella would kill her.

Suppressing her dread, Evelyn followed, mentally cursing her luck.

Please don’t let it be Nathan Blackwood…

Isabella shoved the door open without hesitation.

Inside, over a dozen people sat around a table—lawyers, executives—the atmosphere formal.

All eyes snapped to the interruption.

Isabella scanned the room and found Donovan, frozen in shock.

Her lips curled into a cold smile.

She slammed her bag onto the table with deliberate force.

"Nathan Blackwood, did you even vet this man?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "His liquid assets are falsified. The prices he quoted you are inflated by 20% compared to market rates."

She leaned forward, eyes blazing.

"He’s playing you for a fool."
###Chapter 947

The room fell into stunned silence.

Corporate pricing strategies were highly confidential, known only to those directly involved.

"How could you possibly know this, Ms. Montgomery?"

"Is this information accurate?"

"What's their connection?"

Donovan Pierce quickly regained his composure, fixing Isabella with a murderous glare.

Beside him, a plump woman with sharp features recognized Isabella immediately. She sprang to her feet.

"Ms. Montgomery, wasn't the settlement payment enough for you?"

"Or are you still unsatisfied? What's your game here, causing trouble now?"

Isabella gave the woman an icy smile.

"Victoria Pierce. What a coincidence."

"You've got nerve for a homewrecker. The audacity to show your face after being dumped - now you're slinging mud at us?"

Victoria looked ready to claw Isabella's eyes out.

Isabella flinched at the word 'homewrecker,' her expression darkening. At that moment, Evelyn Sinclair emerged from the shadows, positioning herself protectively beside her friend.

Her frosty gaze locked onto Victoria.

"Get your facts straight, Mrs. Pierce. Isabella was manipulated into that position. With Donovan's wealth and influence, if he hadn't pursued her relentlessly, she'd never have glanced twice at someone like him. You should leash your dog properly - don't let it bite people then blame them for walking down the street!" Evelyn's words cut like a knife.

Victoria's face twisted with rage.

The assembled guests pretended not to watch, though everyone understood the dynamics at play. With Evelyn present, no one dared openly gawk. Evelyn could feel a familiar intense gaze burning into her from across the room.

She deliberately avoided looking in that direction.

Isabella smirked at the couple, her tone dripping with contempt. "Exactly. I've had my pick of men. Why would I dig through trash? Donovan's the most despicable man I've ever wasted time on. Though I shouldn't be surprised - garbage attracts garbage collectors." The insult couldn't have been clearer.

Evelyn decided to cut the verbal sparring short. She addressed the Blackwood Industries representatives. "Verify Ms. Montgomery's claims. She wouldn't fabricate pricing details just to sabotage your deal."

"I'm certain Blackwood Industries won't ignore fraudulent business practices." Evelyn's strategic shift immediately refocused attention on the real issue.

Victoria visibly panicked.

"Don't listen to their lies! Isabella Montgomery is nothing but trouble—"

"That's enough."

Donovan stood abruptly, his expression unreadable.

Just as Isabella turned to leave, Donovan suddenly grabbed her wrist. "We need to talk. Now."

"Donovan!"

Victoria stood frozen, humiliation and fury warring on her face.

That little witch Isabella had destroyed their business deal, and Donovan didn't even care?

Dragging Isabella away in front of everyone - what message did that send?

It screamed that Victoria's position as Mrs. Pierce meant nothing.

She couldn't let this public humiliation stand.
###Chapter 948

Nathan Blackwood didn't spare Victoria Pierce a single glance. His gaze remained locked on Isabella Montgomery as he dragged her out despite her violent protests.

Evelyn Sinclair's brows knitted together. Fear gripped her at the thought of Donovan Pierce taking Isabella away. She moved to intervene when Nathan's icy voice cut through the tension.

"Harrison." His command sliced through the air. "Inform Mr. Pierce that our contract signing is postponed indefinitely."

Harrison had been observing from the shadows. He straightened immediately at his name. "Understood, Mr. Blackwood."

Was this to prevent Evelyn from chasing after them? Her hesitation lasted only a moment before Nathan spoke again. "Evelyn—"

She turned. Nathan stood now, his piercing gaze as intense and domineering as ever.

His voice came low and rough. "We owe you thanks. Without your warning, we'd have lost millions after signing with Pierce."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "If you want to thank anyone, thank Isabella. The information came from her."

Victoria Pierce paled at Nathan's words. Their deal was clearly dead. "Mr. Blackwood, you'd believe that lunatic over us?"

Nathan paused. His glacial stare made Victoria shrink back. "Consider it due diligence. Your company's credibility was already questionable."

He stepped closer to Evelyn. "As thanks, let me treat you to dinner." When she frowned, he added, "Ms. Montgomery included."

Something felt off. Nathan's calm demeanor didn't match the storm she'd witnessed last night. His eyes revealed nothing—dark pools impossible to read.

She forced a polite smile. "We have prior engagements. Another time."

With that, Evelyn turned on her heel and left.

Nathan's expression darkened. A barely perceptible tension gripped his frame before he followed her out. The remaining occupants exhaled in relief—even failed negotiations were preferable to suffocating under Nathan's oppressive presence.

Outside, Evelyn spotted Donovan and Isabella arguing nearby. Isabella's furious gestures suggested she was unleashing every curse in the dictionary. Seeing her friend holding her own, Evelyn hung back.

Harrison waited at a discreet distance.

Before she could settle, Nathan's familiar presence materialized beside her. His voice came low and rough. "Donovan's dangerous. Warn your friend."

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. Nathan met her gaze, one brow quirking upward. "What? Don't trust me? Now that you're with someone else, have I become irredeemable?" His lips twisted. "What else did Preston say about me?"

Evelyn's face remained impassive. "You don't come up in our conversations."

The words struck like a physical blow. Nathan's entire body stiffened. The carefully controlled storm in his eyes threatened to break free.

Nothing cut deeper than indifference. Nathan felt it viscerally—an invisible hand tearing through his chest, shredding what remained of his composure. Yet he could only endure the pain in silence.
###Chapter 949

Nathan Blackwood studied Evelyn Sinclair's profile—quiet, beautiful, and no longer his.

Dark thoughts festered in his mind. If she wasn't his, should he just destroy her instead?

Evelyn noticed Isabella Montgomery had finished berating Donovan Pierce and waved her over.

Donovan's expression was grim.

They were about to leave when his voice cut through the air, rough as if dragged over gravel.

"Isabella, apart from this, I've never lied to you. I told her we'd finalize the divorce this afternoon. Please... just wait for me."

Before he could finish, Isabella let out a cold laugh.

"You two deserve each other. Don't divorce on my account—I was just unlucky enough to step in something foul. If I ever see you in San Francisco again, I'll make sure you regret it every single time."

After years of playing the field, she'd finally let her guard down for a man she thought was worth keeping. And what did she get?

A married liar.

No matter how wild her reputation was, Isabella had standards.

This wasn't worth it.

With one last scathing remark, she dragged Evelyn away. Harrison hesitated by the door, watching Nathan, but the man showed no intention of intervening. His decision was final.

On the drive back, Evelyn studied Isabella's furious expression and sighed. "Still angry?"

"How could I not be?"

"Nathan suspended the partnership indefinitely. If what you said is true, it's over. Knowing him, he won't give Donovan another chance."

Isabella's expression softened slightly, then froze. She turned to Evelyn.

"I didn’t expect Nathan to be there. Since when does he personally oversee such minor deals?"

Evelyn smiled. Isabella was only now realizing how awkward this was for her. "It’s fine. Business circles are small—we’ll cross paths eventually. But maybe Nathan saw potential in Donovan. Otherwise, as you said, he wouldn’t have bothered."

Isabella scoffed. "Birds of a feather."

One sentence condemned both men, and Evelyn couldn’t argue.

"Should I drop you home?"

"Take me to the office. The Quimbey Group is cutting ties with Donovan. Even if my mother skins me alive, I refuse to work with a man like that."

Evelyn arched a brow but nodded.

At least their involvement wasn’t deep. Ending it would be simple.

Unlike her situation with Nathan—that wouldn’t be resolved with words.

Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at Isabella’s office building.

She inhaled sharply, her face pale. Explaining this to her mother wouldn’t be easy.

Her grip on Evelyn’s hand tightened. "I—I’m nervous. Come up with me?"

Evelyn sighed.

Isabella gave her a pleading look. "My mother adores you. She always says you’re the daughter she wishes she had. Please?"

Evelyn relented. "Fine. But if she hits you, I’m not stepping in."

Isabella nodded. If her mother decided to punish her, no one could save her.

The receptionist, familiar with Isabella, smiled warmly.

"Ms. Montgomery, President Quimbey has been waiting for you upstairs."

Isabella’s face lost all color.
###Chapter 950

Evelyn watched Isabella walk ahead, her steps unsteady as she entered the elevator. Her legs trembled slightly, betraying her nerves.

A pang of sympathy struck Evelyn.

Given Mrs. Montgomery’s temper, she might actually beat Isabella senseless.

Isabella paused at the door, inhaling deeply before pushing it open.

"Mom—"

Mrs. Montgomery ruled the Montgomery family with an iron grip. A formidable woman, she had raised Isabella alone, earning both respect and fear for her unyielding nature.

Her temper was legendary.

Before Evelyn could step inside, a handful of photos were flung at Isabella’s feet.

"Look at what you’ve done!"

Isabella picked them up, her face draining of color. She hadn’t told her mother yet—but someone had beaten her to it. The photos showed Donovan Pierce and her together, along with the incident where Victoria Pierce had publicly humiliated her.

Evelyn caught a glimpse as she entered.

"Hello, Aunt Montgomery."

The fury in Mrs. Montgomery’s eyes softened slightly at the sight of Evelyn.

"Evelyn, it’s been too long."

Isabella steadied herself. One mistake had spiraled into disaster, but she was ready to face the consequences.

"Mom, I came to explain, but it seems someone already did. It’s over between us. I didn’t know he was married—I would never stoop that low. There are plenty of decent men around me. I wouldn’t throw away my principles for Donovan."

Her defiance surprised Mrs. Montgomery.

But knowing Isabella’s pride, it made sense.

"Are you truly done with him?"

Her goal was clear—to force Isabella to cut ties.

"Yes."

Mrs. Montgomery glanced at Evelyn. "Is she telling the truth?"

Evelyn nodded. "Isabella came to the office to terminate all business between the Montgomerys and Donovan. You know she wouldn’t tolerate a man without morals."

A heavy silence followed before Mrs. Montgomery sighed.

"I’ve already ended the partnership. Make sure it stays that way. No more contact. This mess happened because you were reckless!"

Isabella lowered her head, but relief flickered in her eyes.

Her explanation had worked.

"However, we can’t ignore this scandal. If word spreads, it’ll ruin you. Lawrence Wellington from Wellington Group has invited you for tea in a few days. You will meet him. Unless he makes an unforgivable mistake, you are not breaking this off!"

The warning was sharp.

Isabella’s head snapped up. "Mom—!"

"Don’t 'Mom' me. You waste your days frivolously. You refuse to take over the company—fine. Then marry someone who can. Announcing this engagement is the only way to salvage your reputation!"

Evelyn listened quietly. Lawrence Wellington was the CEO of Wellington Group. Though older than Isabella, he was still unmarried.

When Evelyn had dealt with Ashford Group, Lawrence had played a key role—profiting greatly from the takeover.

Ambitious. Ruthless.

Mrs. Montgomery wasn’t giving Isabella a choice.

Evelyn left soon after, heading straight to Sterling Enterprises.

Last time, she’d helped Isabella escape Gregory Thornton.

But Lawrence Wellington?

That was a battle Isabella would have to fight alone.

Back in her office, a knock interrupted her thoughts.

"President Sinclair," Bennett said, stepping in. "Ms. Amelia Sinclair is here to see you."
###Chapter 951

Evelyn Sinclair froze when she heard Amelia Sinclair wanted to see her.

As Alexander Sterling's fiancée, Evelyn couldn't afford to be dismissive.

"Come in."

She smiled as Amelia entered. The woman carried herself with effortless grace, her gentle features radiating warmth like sunlight through spring leaves.

"Amelia, here to see my brother?"

Amelia's lips curved. "We have lunch plans, but I wanted to speak with you first."

Evelyn arched a brow at Bennett, who nodded and excused himself.

The two had never been alone before.

Though Evelyn regretted that Isabella Montgomery and Alexander hadn't worked out, she refused to interfere.

Her brother's choices were his own.

"How is Ms. Montgomery recovering?"

Evelyn hesitated. A flicker of tension crossed her face. "She's much better. Just discharged."

"I remember how close you two were in high school." Amelia's smile turned knowing. "She often delivered things to Alexander on your behalf—chocolates, drinks, little gifts. Made quite an impression."

The words carried an edge.

Evelyn's fingers stilled around her coffee cup. I never asked Isabella to give him anything.

The realization struck instantly. Amelia had noticed Isabella's feelings.

No wonder she'd lost her composure earlier.

This wasn't a casual visit—it was reconnaissance.

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Alexander hates sweets. Always has."

Amelia exhaled sharply. "We fought over it. That's why I left the country—why I cut contact."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "That was the reason?"

"Partly." Amelia leaned forward. "Just answer me this—does she still love him?"

Her voice wavered, just once.

Evelyn set her cup down. "Isabella is my friend. But I don't play matchmaker. Ask her yourself."

Amelia laughed bitterly. "Too cruel."

She wouldn't humiliate Isabella by forcing a confession.

Evelyn studied her. "Amelia, my brother adores you. So does our family. No one could take him from you."

For a heartbeat, Amelia's mask slipped. Then, genuine relief softened her features.

"I overthought it. No wonder Alexander treasures you." She squeezed Evelyn's hand. "I will too."

The door swung open before Evelyn could respond.

Alexander strode in, exasperated.

"Amelia, stop distracting my sister. Come bother me instead."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee.

Since when is Alexander cheesier than Lucas?
###Chapter 952

Amelia Sinclair rose gracefully from her seat, her lips curving into a knowing smile. "Evelyn's already pushing herself too hard. Don't you think it's time you shared some of her burdens?"

Evelyn Sinclair nodded solemnly, her fingers tightening around the pen in her hand.

Alexander Sterling shot her an impassive glance. "Experience builds character."

Evelyn's lips twitched in silent protest.

The office door clicked shut behind Amelia and Alexander, leaving Evelyn alone with her towering stack of documents.

She exhaled sharply and returned to her paperwork.

Moments later, Bennett's familiar knock sounded at the door.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Sinclair is here—"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. 'Three hours. That's all the time we've been apart. Isn't this getting excessive?'

"Send him in."

Though Preston Sinclair was now her boyfriend, their relationship remained undisclosed. Even Bennett remained unaware, assuming their meetings were strictly professional.

Preston entered with a warm smile, carrying an unmistakable food container from that exclusive private kitchen.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with recognition. 'The one with the truffle risotto?' "Finished your meetings already?"

He set the container on her desk with practiced ease.

"Nothing takes priority over your meals," he chuckled. "I knew you'd skip dinner if left to your own devices. Try this—"

Evelyn had planned to grab a protein bar, but Preston's thoughtfulness changed her mind. 'If I'm working this hard, I deserve proper meals.' "Did you eat already?" She accepted the fork he offered.

Preston nodded. "Business lunch at the restaurant. Ordered this for you on our way out."

Evelyn didn't mind the convenience. The container held her favorites—honey glazed salmon and truffle mashed potatoes. Perfection.

Despite her delight, years of etiquette training kept her movements measured. She chewed slowly, maintaining perfect posture.

Preston watched her with quiet amusement before speaking. "Did you meet with Mr. Blackwood today?"

Evelyn paused mid-bite. "Isabella tried sabotaging Donovan Pierce's deal with Blackwood Industries. Didn't expect Nathan to show up."

Preston's expression darkened. "He didn't cause trouble, did he? After last night..."

Evelyn shook her head. "Nathan's too calculated for that. He won't risk damaging both families' reputations."

The fragile truce between the Sterlings and Blackwoods couldn't withstand another scandal. Nathan's self-interest guaranteed his restraint.

Preston's shoulders relaxed slightly. "Good."

But his raised eyebrow betrayed his thoughts. 'Calculated, yes. Decent? Hardly.'

As Evelyn finished eating, Preston checked his watch. "If you're free, come to the airport with me?"

Evelyn blinked. "Airport?"

"Oliver's flying in for vacation. Wants us to meet him in Montecito."

"What time's his flight?" Evelyn's fork clattered against the plate. 'How could Preston keep this from me?'

"Should've landed twenty minutes ago."

Evelyn shot to her feet. "You're just telling me now? He'll be waiting forever!"

Preston calmly packed the empty container. "He's got Susan and security. He'll survive."

Regret twisted through Evelyn. 'Should've eaten faster—'

"Leave that for Bennett! We need to go!" She practically vibrated with impatience.

It had been months since she'd seen little Oliver. The ache of missing him surprised her.

Preston chuckled at her urgency. "He'll be thrilled to see you. Far more than me, I'm sure."
###Chapter 953

Evelyn Sinclair had already slipped into her coat and wrapped her scarf around her neck, standing by the door with her bag in hand.

She moved too quickly.

Preston Sinclair didn’t waste a second, grabbing his belongings to follow her downstairs.

Outside, the air was biting, a fine drizzle misting the streets.

Preston took the wheel. The drive to the airport was a frustrating crawl, every red light stretching the minutes longer.

Yet, he made no move to call Oliver to warn him of their delay. By the time they arrived, over half an hour had slipped away.

Evelyn stepped out of the car, watching as Preston casually pulled out his phone to call Oliver’s bodyguard.

He glanced back at her. "They’re on their way."

Evelyn nodded. Less than two minutes later, she spotted the bodyguard and nanny Sophia approaching, with little Oliver Sinclair toddling between them.

Oliver was dressed in tiny denim overalls and a leather cap, looking every bit the mischievous little troublemaker. His cherubic face was unfairly adorable.

It had been a while since Evelyn had seen him. He’d grown taller, his sapphire eyes bright and clear.

Oliver hadn’t expected to see her there. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief before breaking into a run, arms outstretched.

"Pretty Lady!"

Evelyn smiled and waved at him. Just as Oliver was about to leap into her arms, Preston smoothly intercepted him, lifting the boy into the air with a deceptively gentle smile.

"Miss me, son?"

'He thinks he can just hug my girlfriend without permission? Not happening.' Preston thought.

Oliver pouted, legs kicking mid-air. "Oh, Daddy, you’re here too..."

Preston’s expression flattened.

Evelyn laughed, stepping forward to nudge Preston’s arm, silently urging him to put the boy down.

With a reluctant sigh, Preston released the little rascal.

The moment his feet touched the ground, Oliver was off like a shot, throwing himself at Evelyn and wrapping his arms around her legs. "Pretty Lady, I missed you so much!" His voice was pure sugar, melting her heart instantly.

Evelyn grinned down at him. "Welcome to Montecito, Oliver!"

He nodded enthusiastically before waving at the nanny and bodyguard behind him.

The two were hauling four massive suitcases between them, looking utterly exhausted.

Preston frowned. "Why so much luggage?"

Oliver beamed. "These are all gifts for Pretty Lady!"

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Oh no.

Already, Oliver was unzipping one of the suitcases. "When I was in Korea for the competition, someone gave me a real antique collectible! I brought it back—it’s your favorite color, red!"

Evelyn blinked. Since when did I like red?

The moment the suitcase popped open, her blood ran cold.

Inside lay a pair of ancient, blood-red embroidered shoes. A sinister aura seemed to seep from them.

Preston’s face darkened instantly. He snapped the suitcase shut, his voice sharp.

"Explain."

He turned to the nanny and bodyguard.

The nanny, raised overseas and unfamiliar with Montecito’s customs, shook her head in confusion. "Young Master bought them at an auction in Korea for a fortune. I heard they were stripped from a woman who’s been dead for a thousand years..."

The bodyguard’s mouth twitched. "I did advise the Young Master. If Ms. Sinclair doesn’t like them, he could always... gift them to you, Mr. Sinclair."
###Chapter 954

Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair exchanged glances. Preston's eyelid twitched.

Even the usually good-natured Preston had moments when he wanted to punch someone.

"You told me I couldn't give money or jewelry. These shoes are exquisite—the most expensive item at that auction! Every girl would love them!"

Oliver Sinclair beamed as he added, "Pretty Lady, do you like them?"

Evelyn's expression froze. It took her a long moment to steady her racing heart.

After all this time, Oliver has upgraded from funeral wreaths to a dead woman's shoes? I can't bring myself to appreciate this.

"Oliver, promise me you'll stick to normal gifts from now on, okay?"

She was genuinely traumatized.

Oliver frowned, confused by her reaction. He turned to Preston. "Then I'll give them to Daddy for his birthday! Long life and happiness!"

Preston's eyebrow twitched. A sharp pain stabbed his chest. "Thank you."

I need to enroll my son in a Montecito cultural crash course.

Rubbing his temples, Preston glanced at Evelyn. "Do you know any museum curators? Let's donate them. I never want to see those again."

Evelyn nodded. "I'll have someone contact you."

A dead woman's shoes would be less unsettling in a museum collection.

Preston sighed and walked away, briefly considering giving Oliver away too. Evelyn pressed her lips together, staring at the boy.

What a surprise.

"What's wrong with Daddy? These cost twelve million dollars!"

Evelyn took Oliver's hand. "Daddy thinks someone else would appreciate them more."

Oliver nodded sadly, clinging to her warm fingers. "Pretty Lady, I missed you so much! Can I stay at your house?"

Evelyn hesitated. "You'll have to ask Daddy."

Preston was already waiting in the car. The moment they got in, he started the engine, shooting a cold glance at the bodyguard and nanny outside.

"Stay here. Handle the box before returning."

The two exchanged uneasy looks.

Twelve million for a dead woman's shoes?

Preston regretted ever giving Oliver that black card.

"Daddy, can I stay with Pretty Lady?"

Oliver blinked up at him with his cherubic face.

Preston, still irritated, wasn't swayed.

"No. Your tutor is moving in. I just hired a Montecito history teacher for you."

Oliver gasped. "But I'm Pacifican!"

Preston gave him a look. "I can change that."

Oliver's jaw dropped. Daddy can just switch my nationality like that?!

Evelyn almost pitied him—but cultural lessons wouldn't hurt.

Oliver turned pleading eyes on her. She sighed.

"You don't have to change nationalities. Just take fewer lessons. How long is your break?"

"I finished early. My classmates still have three months left."

Evelyn raised a brow. Smart kid.

Oliver suddenly remembered something. "Daddy, Isaiah Sinclair is coming for you!"
###Chapter 955

Preston Sinclair frowned slightly. He noticed Evelyn's confused expression and explained, "Isaiah Sinclair is my second uncle and the heir to the Sinclair family."

Evelyn nodded. Preston had never mentioned the Sinclair family to her before. Now that they were in Montecito, she figured he would eventually tell her more about them.

Oliver Sinclair clenched his little fist. "He's also a total jerk!"

Evelyn arched a brow. 'Seems like the Sinclair family isn't exactly harmonious...'

She chuckled but kept her thoughts to herself. If she had known earlier, she would’ve had Bennett dig deeper into their affairs.

They sent Oliver home to rest. Evelyn didn’t linger long before receiving a call from William.

William sounded unusually tense. "Evelyn, we have guests. Come home now."

Then he added pointedly, "Alone."

His tone made it clear—she wasn’t to bring anyone with her.

Evelyn murmured an acknowledgment and bid Preston and Oliver goodbye.

Sterling Manor

The butler, Archibald, opened the door for Evelyn as she stepped out of the car. "Who’s here?" she asked quietly.

Archibald shook his head—he didn’t know either.

Inside, Evelyn found William sitting stiffly, his expression grim. Across from him was a man in his thirties with a polished but insincere smile. On the opposite side of the table, Lucas lounged casually, his sharp eyes flicking toward Evelyn as she entered. "Evelyn, you're back!"

She smiled and approached. "Dad, Lucas, who is—"

The man in his thirties exuded the air of a shrewd businessman, his cold gaze calculating. Before William could speak, the man stood.

"Ms. Sterling, this is our first meeting. I’m Isaiah Sinclair, President of Sinclair Corporation."

Isaiah extended his hand. Evelyn gave a polite smile and shook it, though her eyes flickered with recognition—she’d just heard his name moments ago.

Lucas added dryly, "Evelyn, he’s also Preston’s second uncle."

Evelyn smiled. "Yes, Preston mentioned that."

Isaiah raised a brow. "How surprising. I didn’t expect him to bring me up in conversation with you."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Mr. Sinclair, what brings you here?"

Isaiah’s sharp eyes gleamed with something unsettling—like a predator circling its prey.

"I’m here to propose a partnership with Sterling Enterprises."

Evelyn kept her tone light. "What kind of partnership did you have in mind?"

She already suspected it wasn’t that simple. If Isaiah were here with a genuine business opportunity, William wouldn’t look so displeased.

Besides, discussing business at their home was unusual.

This was about leverage.

Isaiah exhaled slowly. "Preston Sinclair’s AI collaboration with Sterling Enterprises was… discreet. The Sinclair family wasn’t pleased to learn of it. You should know that Sinclair Corporation’s core business is artificial intelligence. Whether it’s sales, research, or overseas connections, we’re a hundred times more capable than Preston alone."

He leaned forward slightly. "If Sterling Enterprises is willing to terminate its agreement with Preston, Sinclair Corporation will dedicate all our resources to expanding the project’s research and production. We’ll also triple the initial investment."

Silence settled over the room. No one spoke.

Lucas barely suppressed a scoff—he had no interest in this discussion and disliked Isaiah’s slimy demeanor.

William was visibly repelled by the offer.

Preston had a good relationship with the Sterlings, and William respected him. But this man? A scheming fox, through and through.

All Isaiah talked about was severing Preston’s ties with his own family. 'What kind of vipers is Evelyn getting involved with?' William thought grimly.

He was thinking long-term.
###Chapter 956

Evelyn Sinclair studied Isaiah Sinclair with a faint smile. The man truly lived up to being a Sinclair—generous with his offers, yet dripping with condescension.

There was something repulsive about the way he carried himself, so unlike the humble and courteous Preston.

While Evelyn analyzed him, Isaiah did the same to her.

Lucas Sterling couldn’t hold back any longer.

"Abandon Preston just to partner with Sinclair Enterprises? That’s a chaotic move. You’re his uncle, aren’t you? Isn’t this just digging your nephew’s grave?"

His bluntness made the air tense. Isaiah chuckled. "More or less."

"Mr. Sinclair, I don’t quite follow."

Why did Isaiah speak of Preston and the Sinclairs as if they weren’t connected?

Evelyn’s gaze remained indifferent. She suddenly recalled Oliver Sinclair’s earlier words.

"He’s a scumbag too!"

"Ms. Sterling, it seems Preston hasn’t told you much about the Sinclairs. I heard he’s been pursuing you. Now, I see his feelings aren’t very sincere either."

Isaiah shook his head. "That’s just how he is. Always hiding behind a mask so no one sees his true thoughts."

William Sterling stood abruptly, his patience wearing thin. "Evelyn, you handle this. I’m going upstairs to rest."

Evelyn nodded. "Of course, Dad. Get some rest."

Only three remained in the grand living room.

Lucas had no intention of leaving. This concerned his sister’s happiness—he needed answers.

"Mr. Sinclair, you arrived unannounced. You haven’t met Preston yet, have you?"

"I’ll see him soon enough. This trip to Montecito is for business and to bring Preston home."

Isaiah smiled, then added, "Actually, I’ll need your cooperation for that, Ms. Sterling."

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly. Archibald brought her coffee.

She took a slow sip before setting it down. Isaiah’s expression tightened—her calm indifference wasn’t what he expected.

After a beat, he continued.

"Perhaps you’re unaware, Ms. Sterling. Preston once insisted on marrying his brother’s woman and raising his brother’s child as his own. In our family, that’s treason. Because of it, he left the Sinclairs, cutting all ties."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, smiling serenely. "I know."

Isaiah stiffened. She knows? Preston actually told her everything?

Lucas gaped. "Wait—what?! Preston married his brother’s woman? That kid isn’t even his?"

Evelyn shot him a disdainful look. Pathetic.

Isaiah smirked. "Correct. Not his child."

Lucas frowned. "Then why didn’t he say so? Before, he even—"

"Shame, probably." Isaiah cut in. "Marrying your brother’s wife isn’t exactly honorable. Admitting the child isn’t his would only tarnish his reputation further."

His gaze slid to Evelyn. "I’m surprised Preston confessed all this to you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Preston was protecting the child. He didn’t want them hurt when the truth came out."

Lucas blinked—the two explanations couldn’t be more different.

Isaiah’s eyes darkened. "But he must’ve omitted how he abandoned his mother. After leaving, he never visited. Now his father—my brother—is critically ill. I’m here to bring Preston home."

He leaned forward. "Most of Preston’s investments are tied to Sterling Enterprises. If you sever ties, he’ll have no choice but to return."

Lucas scoffed. "And go bankrupt in the process, right?"
###Chapter 957

Isaiah Sinclair laughed. "The Sinclair family has more than enough resources to support Preston. If his business fails, he can always rebuild."

His voice turned icy. "But if his father dies, Preston will never get another chance to see him again."

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent, her fingers tightening around her teacup. Isaiah had laid all his cards on the table.

Yet, she couldn’t tell which of his words were truth and which were lies.

He was shockingly transparent about his manipulative schemes.

"I know this might seem inappropriate," Isaiah continued smoothly, "but we have no other way to bring Preston back to the Sinclair family. He belongs with us. Why should he struggle outside when he could lead within his own empire?"

He made it sound like a favor—like this was all for Preston’s benefit.

Evelyn hesitated, then forced a polite smile.

"This is a significant decision. I can’t make it alone. Mr. Sinclair, I’ll need time to consider."

Isaiah exhaled, visibly pleased. He adjusted his cufflinks with a confident smirk.

"Of course. Remember, this isn’t about forcing him into submission. Preston would return as a leader, not an employee. Think carefully."

He stood, straightening his jacket. "Once you’ve made your choice, I’ll send someone to finalize the arrangements."

Evelyn rose as well. "I won’t see you out."

Isaiah nodded and followed the butler toward the exit.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn’s smile vanished. A cold glint sharpened her gaze. "You heard everything?"

Lucas Sterling gave a slow nod. "I underestimated Preston. Never thought he’d be so attached to a child that isn’t even his—"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. He was still stuck on the same irrelevant detail.

"Oliver’s identity stays secret. He’s too young to handle the fallout."

Lucas shrugged. "Fine. But Isaiah clearly doesn’t care if this gets out. He dropped that bombshell like it was nothing."

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

To Isaiah, Preston raising another man’s son was trivial compared to the real scandal—marrying his brother’s widow.

She grabbed her phone and stood abruptly. "I’m leaving."

Lucas raised a brow. "Going to tell Preston?"

"Obviously. This isn’t my choice to make."

Preston was a grown man. He could decide for himself whether to return to the vipers’ den.

Evelyn refused to be Isaiah’s pawn.

She drove straight to Preston’s penthouse.

Upstairs, the door swung open before she could knock.

Preston blinked in surprise. "Ms. Sinclair. This is… unexpected."

Evelyn smirked.

A tiny blur of energy barreled into her legs before Preston could finish.

"Pretty Lady! I missed you!" Oliver Sinclair beamed up at her, arms outstretched.

Preston’s expression darkened. This kid never misses an opportunity.

Evelyn ruffled Oliver’s hair. "Hey, sweetheart. Guess what? Lucas got me that new AI robot—the one that controls Leo remotely. Want to go play with it?"

Oliver’s eyes sparkled. "Really? Right now?"

She leaned down. "My place is just downstairs. The passcode is 0915. Go ahead—we’ll catch up."

Oliver didn’t need telling twice. He dashed off before Preston could protest.

Evelyn straightened, meeting Preston’s wary gaze.

"We need to talk."
###Chapter 958

Oliver ran out with pure joy. Preston chuckled softly and stepped aside for Evelyn. Her gaze swept across Preston's living room - warm, inviting, the kind of space that instantly put you at ease.

"Did you come to see me for something specific?"

Evelyn nodded. "Isaiah Sinclair paid me a visit—"

Preston's expression shifted. The smile froze on his lips.

She relayed Isaiah's words verbatim.

"I thought you should know. Better to be prepared."

For a heartbeat, Preston went completely still. His eyes turned icy, devoid of any warmth.

Then, just as quickly, his usual gentle smile returned. He met Evelyn's gaze.

"Thank you for telling me this. Seems I've officially become your person now."

Evelyn blinked. "You and Lucas share the same terrible sense of priorities!"

Preston's laughter held a playful glint. "Your stance is my only priority. The rest is background noise."

His fingers brushed against hers, sending an electric jolt up her arm.

"I might be in trouble this time, darling."

Evelyn stilled. This was the first glimpse of vulnerability she'd ever seen from him. "Do you need help?"

Preston's lips quirked. "Desperately."

"Name it."

"Stay by my side. That's all the motivation I'll ever need."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

He smoothed a strand of her hair behind her ear. "Don't worry. Isaiah's out of his depth." She studied him. "Is there nothing else you want to tell me?"

Isaiah's claim about Preston angering his mother was too personal to broach directly, yet too glaring to ignore.

Preston's smile faltered. Shadows darkened his gaze.

"Isaiah lies as easily as he breathes. His greed for the Sinclair inheritance forced me out. Simple as that."

Evelyn frowned. "So you walked away willingly?"

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Oliver's faced too many 'accidents' since birth. My staying would've painted a bigger target on his back. My uncle lost his humanity over money." His voice turned hollow. "Back then... my parents and I weren't on speaking terms. Walking away was the cleanest solution."

"How noble. Yet your sacrifice earned you nothing but a predator still hunting you. Now he's after your overseas assets. You're really just going to let him?"

Preston's smile turned razor-sharp. "He can try. What's mine stays mine."

Wall Street hadn't bowed to him because of his last name. If Isaiah dared reach for Preston's empire, he'd lose more than just his pride.

Evelyn exhaled quietly. Maybe I imagined the tension. But he's still dodging the parental landmine.

She stood abruptly. "I've got work tonight. Why don't you go entertain Oliver?"

"Let me drive you." He reached for his coat.

"Bennett's picking me up."

Preston nodded. Leaving Oliver alone wasn't an option, or he'd have insisted.

"Does Bennett have a girlfriend?"

The question slipped out, laced with something dark. Jealousy, perhaps, that another man got to orbit Evelyn's world so effortlessly.
###Chapter 959

The question caught Evelyn off guard. "Bennett's already married."

She distinctly remembered Bennett taking wedding leave not long ago.

Preston chuckled.

"What a shame. I was going to set him up with someone."

Evelyn frowned. "Why haven't you mentioned this before?"

"Must've slipped my mind. Too much going on lately..."

She moved toward the door. "I'm heading out now. You should come downstairs too."

"Wait."

Preston plucked a single flower from the vase in the living room and approached her. Evelyn's pulse quickened.

The delicate Swiss lily was held up before her eyes.

"Consider this my peace offering for that mess at the airport earlier."

Those shoes were probably already on display at the museum by now. The curator had called earlier, gushing with gratitude over their "generous donation."

Evelyn accepted the flower with a small smile. "Thank you."

Out of all his extravagant gifts, this was the most normal one.

Preston knelt to help her with her shoes.

She couldn't resist his persistence. But he made it seem effortless, as if it were nothing out of the ordinary.

Once he finished, he rose, his warm gaze alight with something deeper. "Evelyn, I have a question."

She met his eyes.

"When do I get to kiss you?"

Her reflection shimmered in his eyes. Every time Preston looked at her, he had to fight the urge to close the distance between them. He held back—always—because he feared startling her, feared she wasn't ready.

Just now, kneeling before her, he had imagined them as husband and wife in some domestic scene. The thought only intensified the ache in his chest. So he asked.

Evelyn blinked, cheeks flushing. Silence stretched between them.

Preston wasn’t letting her off that easily. He stepped closer, his presence enveloping her. The warmth of his scent wrapped around her, dizzying. She snapped out of it quickly, pressing a hand lightly against his chest.

"Then you'll have to wait for me to ask—" she said hastily.

Preston arched a brow. "Ask who?"

"My father."

His expression froze. Before he could respond, Evelyn turned and bolted. She was messing with him.

If she actually asked William Sterling, the man would probably grab his fishing rod and chase Preston halfway across Montecito.

Preston chuckled, shaking his head—until his phone buzzed. The moment he saw the caller ID, his smile vanished.

He answered. "Uncle Isaiah?"

Isaiah Sinclair's voice dripped with amusement. "I'm in Montecito. Care to meet, nephew?"

Preston's eyes darkened, frost creeping into his tone. "Of course."

"By the way, I've met that Ms. Sterling you're so fond of. Good taste. Beautiful, wealthy—not an easy catch, is she?"

Preston hung up without another word.

He had no patience for Isaiah's games. There was no affection between them to begin with.

Sterling Enterprises

Alexander had called an emergency meeting after a major incident on one of their projects.

By the time Evelyn arrived, he had already spent half an hour grilling two supervisors.

Both men looked pale, their hands trembling. Whatever had been said in that room had shaken them to the core.

Alexander's voice was ice. "This is the company's final decision. You're both terminated. Settle your affairs with HR and leave with what dignity you have left."
###Chapter 960

The two supervisors hesitated, their mouths opening and closing like fish out of water.

Alexander Sterling's icy glare silenced them before they could utter another word.

They knew better than to test his patience. One mistake was all it took to be permanently blacklisted from Sterling Enterprises.

Once the door clicked shut behind them, Evelyn Sinclair settled into the chair across from her brother, confusion knitting her brows.

"I thought there was an issue with the project?"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Those two were bribed to sabotage it. Their own team caught them red-handed."

"Who paid them off?"

"Pacific Crest Enterprises. A woman named Cassandra Blake."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the armrest. "Her again?"

"You've crossed paths before?"

"Unfortunately. Any damage done yet?"

"Not yet, but they came dangerously close." Alexander's knuckles whitened around his pen. "Guess who they hired as our spokesperson?"

Evelyn shook her head.

High-end real estate rarely needed celebrity endorsements unless it was a landmark development.

"Harrison Blake."

Evelyn's espresso nearly splattered across the mahogany desk. "The domestic violence scandal guy?!"

Harrison had debuted alongside Julian Moreau, but their careers had taken wildly different trajectories. While Julian soared to A-list status, Harrison's reputation imploded after marrying during his peak—only to be exposed as an abuser.

Now blacklisted across Montecito, anyone associated with Harrison became instant pariahs.

And Sterling Enterprises had just signed him.

Alexander massaged his temples. "Those supervisors had signing authority. They deliberately chose Harrison so our development would crash alongside his career."

"We can terminate the contract, right?"

"At ten times the endorsement fee. Cancel now, and the Pacific Heights Project dies before groundbreaking."

The office plunged into tense silence.

Evelyn tapped her nails against the desk. "Lucas deals with celebrity scandals daily. Surely he—"

"Lucas said 'Don't sign him' and hung up. Helpful, isn't he?" Alexander scoffed.

Evelyn smirked. "Relax. Your baby sister practically runs Horizon Media now. I'll handle this."

"You?" Alexander's doubtful eyebrow arched.

"Please. I've got half of Montecito's PR teams on speed dial."

A reluctant chuckle escaped Alexander. Some tension left his shoulders.

"Fine. But if it fails, we cut Harrison loose and take the financial hit. Corporate image is non-negotiable."

Evelyn nodded. One tarnished spokesperson could trigger stock crashes, bankruptcies—the whole domino effect.

She stood, smoothing her blazer. "Go enjoy your date with Amelia. This mess is beneath you."

"Evelyn—wait."

Alexander pulled a slim dossier from his drawer. His knuckles rapped against the manila envelope.

"I know Preston Sinclair visited today. K already briefed me." His voice turned gravelly. "I'm not interfering, but after what happened with Nathan... Trust is earned. No matter how perfect Preston seems, he's still a man. And men lie."

Evelyn froze.

She didn't need to open the folder to know its contents.

A full background check on Preston Sinclair.
###Chapter 961

Evelyn hesitated, torn between asking what was inside the document. Alexander made the decision for her.

Learn from past mistakes.

The past had been a brutal teacher.

When Evelyn fell in love, her entire family became hypervigilant over every little detail.

How did I end up with such an overprotective but loving family? she mused.

With a small smile, she reached for the folder. "You're right. I shouldn't take everything at face value. I need to know his true intentions before getting in too deep."

Alexander nodded, pleased with his sister's rationality. Good, she's being smart about this.

Evelyn smirked at him. "Big Brother, since you're also a man, maybe I should warn Amelia about your advice."

His expression darkened. "Whose side are you on?"

She stuck out her tongue playfully, grabbed the documents, and walked out.

Alexander exhaled sharply. She better not ruin my reputation with Amelia.

Evelyn’s mood lifted instantly.

Back in her office, Bennett followed her inside.

"President, I was the one who investigated Preston Sinclair’s background. There’s additional information not in the file. You can ask me directly."

Evelyn raised a brow. "When did you—"

"The night you returned from Sterling Manor. I hired a private investigator in Pacifica. The Sinclairs guard their secrets well. Asking outright would’ve drawn unwanted attention."

She paused. "They didn’t notice?"

"No."

When Alexander had suddenly tasked Bennett with the investigation, he’d realized too late how close Evelyn and Preston had become. Bennett had been slow to react—unacceptable for an assistant.

Evelyn sat on the sofa and opened the folder.

After Preston came of age, his records were separated from the Sinclair family.

The Sinclairs were a vast, secretive dynasty with deep influence in Montecito’s elite circles. Their reach extended into business, politics, and beyond. They held significant sway in Pacifica’s political scene.

Preston, however, appeared completely detached from them—as if the shared last name was mere coincidence.

He’d built his own empire on Wall Street, becoming a securities genius. No one questioned his origins.

In the spouse column, it simply read: widowed.

Straightforward enough.

The file outlined Preston’s life up to the present. Evelyn glanced at Bennett. "Anything else?"

This was just surface-level information—nothing she cared about.

Bennett hesitated. His breath hitched briefly before he steadied himself.

"President, Preston Sinclair is far more complicated than we thought."

Evelyn arched a brow. Bennett had uncovered something rare.

"I’m certain his records were scrubbed. What we found is only what he allowed us to find. But there’s a rumor in Sinclair circles—Preston was originally the family’s chosen heir."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

Now she understood Isaiah Sinclair’s hostility toward his nephew.

Preston’s existence was a threat.

Selecting an heir for such a powerful family wasn’t just about words—it was about power, strategy, survival.

Yet Preston’s calm demeanor contrasted sharply with Isaiah’s ruthless cunning.

After a moment, Evelyn exhaled and handed the folder back.

"Destroy it."
###Chapter 962

Bennett watched Evelyn Sinclair's expression shift with surprise.

Her voice remained light, almost indifferent. "Since this information was deliberately erased, it means only the Sinclairs know the truth beneath it all. Preston will tell me when he's ready."

Evelyn wasn't foolish enough to assume her importance guaranteed Preston's full transparency.

Some secrets weren't hers to dig into.

And frankly, she didn’t care enough to pry.

Bennett sensed the shift in her mood and took the file back with a nod.

"Understood, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn stood and poured herself a fresh cup of coffee. Bennett checked her schedule.

"There’s a gala tonight. Mr. Sterling was invited, but he requested you attend in his place."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why wasn’t I invited directly?"

Bennett frowned, equally puzzled.

Since Evelyn had reclaimed her position at Sterling Enterprises post-divorce, most business events extended invitations to her as a matter of course.

So why the sudden deviation?

"I heard Cassandra Blake will be there," Bennett added. "The event is in her honor."

Evelyn smirked.

Of course. The woman probably still held a grudge after Evelyn had her committed to a psychiatric facility last time. Serves her right.

A wicked thought crossed her mind.

Cassandra gave the invitation to Alexander because she didn’t want me there? Because she can’t stand the sight of me?

Perfect. Then I’ll make sure she suffers through every second of it.

"I’ll go," Evelyn decided. "And bring Harrison Blake with me."

Harrison was Sterling Enterprises' newest brand ambassador. If they were paying him, he might as well earn his keep.

Bennett nodded and immediately contacted Harrison’s manager.

The manager didn’t hesitate—despite Harrison’s packed schedule—when he heard Evelyn wanted him as her plus-one.

Given Harrison’s recent scandals, the manager had been terrified Sterling would terminate his contract. Without endorsements, Harrison’s career was hanging by a thread.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn found Harrison waiting downstairs, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

Tall, lean, and effortlessly elegant, Harrison had the kind of striking features that cameras loved.

Though he’d debuted around the same time as Julian Moreau, Harrison was older—his sharp, brooding gaze a stark contrast to Julian’s perpetually sunny charm.

Years of bad luck and industry blacklisting had left Harrison jaded, his expectations nonexistent.

When he spotted Evelyn, his expression barely flickered. A curt nod was his only acknowledgment.

His manager nudged him sharply, forcing an ingratiating smile.

"Thank you for the invitation, Ms. Sinclair! Harrison’s just a bit reserved, but he’ll make a stunning companion. We’ll prioritize this event above all else."

Evelyn’s patience thinned. Bennett stepped in smoothly.

"We’re on a schedule. Harrison, the car’s ready."

The manager scrambled aside as Harrison ducked into the vehicle without a word.

The interior was silent, save for the faint hum of the engine and the subtle scent of Evelyn’s preferred perfume.

As they pulled up to the venue, Evelyn’s phone buzzed sharply.

Distracted, she reached for it—only for the device to slip from her grasp and clatter to the floor.

She frowned, bending to retrieve it—

But someone else’s hand got there first.
###Chapter 963

Harrison Blake handed Evelyn's phone back to her, his face unreadable.

"Thank you," Evelyn said.

"You're welcome."

It was a call from Preston Sinclair, so she answered immediately.

"Beautiful, are you still working? Should I come pick you up?"

No one could resist little Oliver Sinclair's sweet, childish voice when he turned on the charm.

Evelyn's eyes softened with amusement. "I have an event to attend tonight, so I won't be home yet. Have you eaten, Oliver?"

"Oh no! What am I supposed to do? I can't eat properly without seeing you, Beautiful!" Oliver whined dramatically.

Her heart ached at his sad tone, but before she could coax him, Preston's deep, amused voice cut in.

"Don't listen to him. He skipped dinner but demolished every snack Bennett brought over earlier."

Oliver huffed. "I'm growing! Snacks are important!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Oliver, listen to your father. Too many snacks aren't good. And don’t forget—Bennett also brought your homework. Make sure you finish it."

Preston's rich laughter filled the line before she realized he was still listening.

"Don’t worry. Not a single problem will go untouched."

Thankfully, Preston couldn’t see her face right now. The way she spoke to Oliver sometimes made her want to hide in embarrassment.

Preston smoothly changed the subject. "Heading to Celestial Club tonight?"

Of course, someone like Preston would know about high-profile events.

"Yes. Are you coming?"

He sighed. "Oliver's nanny and security team are at the hotel packing. I can’t leave him alone."

"It's just a minor event. Don’t worry about it."

"Are you going alone?"

That was the real question he wanted to ask.

Evelyn smirked. "Since when have I ever needed a male escort?"

Preston exhaled. "Wait—no, I still think you’re more important. I’ll change and head over."

"Daddy, you're hurting my feelings!" Oliver protested loudly.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "I’m just bringing the new brand ambassador. You can’t steal the spotlight."

A brief silence.

"Fine. You’re the boss."

They exchanged a few more words before ending the call.

The car fell into silence.

The driver was used to it, but this was Harrison’s first time hearing such private conversations. The close quarters made it impossible not to overhear.

Evelyn suddenly remembered his presence and tensed. Would this alleged abuser spread rumors?

She shot him a sideways glance.

Harrison pressed his lips together. "I didn’t hear anything."

Evelyn scoffed. Which means he heard everything.

"What’s your relationship with Cassandra Blake?"

She should have asked sooner. If they weren’t connected, why would Cassandra sabotage Sterling Enterprises to benefit Harrison?

Harrison’s fingers tightened around his knee. "Who’s Cassandra Blake?"

The tell was too obvious.

This man can’t even lie convincingly.

Evelyn’s smile faded, her gaze turning icy.

No one spoke, but Harrison’s tension thickened the air.

The car stopped at the club’s entrance.

A valet opened the door.

Evelyn stepped out, her expression cool and untouchable. Stunning, yet distant—an allure that drew people in but kept them at arm’s length.

Inside, she spotted Cassandra mingling effortlessly and strode toward her with effortless grace.
###Chapter 964

Evelyn Sinclair's expression froze momentarily when she spotted Cassandra Blake.

Cassandra was visibly shocked by Evelyn's unexpected appearance. The invitation wasn't for her—so why is she here?

Evelyn's gaze shifted to the elderly gentleman standing beside Cassandra. This event was his doing—a man who had once wielded considerable influence but had faded into the background over the years.

Still, his wealth and connections far surpassed those of ordinary people.

The business world hadn't forgotten him entirely. Many familiar faces from the old guard had gathered tonight.

Evelyn smiled. The old man had known her since childhood.

He stepped forward. "Ms. Sinclair, welcome! Or should I call you President Evelyn now?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Uncle, are you really welcoming me? I thought I'd somehow offended you."

The old man frowned. "Why would you say that?"

Evelyn's eyes flicked toward Cassandra, whose posture stiffened instantly.

"You only sent an invitation to my brother and conveniently forgot about me—even though I was your favorite as a child."

The old man chuckled, shaking his head. "How could I forget you?" Then he paused, realization dawning as he glanced at Cassandra. His expression darkened slightly.

Cassandra forced a smile. "My apologies. My assistant must have overlooked your name on the guest list. A careless mistake."

The old man's voice turned stern. "Fire that assistant."

Evelyn waved a hand dismissively. "No need. I wouldn't want anyone thinking I came here to stir trouble. My brother just asked me to socialize."

The old man pointed at her, amused. "Still sharp as ever, just like your father. A little fox, through and through."

Laughing, Evelyn turned to introduce her companion. "This is Harrison Blake—the famous actor."

The old man barely reacted. In high society, actors were little more than entertainers. "Enjoy the party. Sebastian is inside."

Evelyn nodded, though her real interest lay in Cassandra's sudden closeness to the old man. Answers will come soon enough.

She guided Harrison further into the ballroom, where she immediately spotted Richard Crest, CEO of Pacific Crest Enterprises. His daughter, Hailey, stood beside him, looking bored.

Hailey's eyes lit up when she saw Evelyn. She strode over without hesitation.

"Ms. Sinclair, long time no see."

The teenager mimicked adult formalities perfectly, holding a glass of champagne with practiced ease. Her designer gown gave her the air of a polished socialite—though she clearly had no interest in the other guests.

Richard hurried after her, alarmed. "Ms. Sinclair, this is my daughter, Hailey. She's at that rebellious age—forgive her manners."

Evelyn only smiled. "No forgiveness needed. I attended her birthday party last month. Hailey, did you like my gift?"

The girl grinned. "Loved it. Especially the engraving inside—such a personal touch."

Evelyn had specifically requested that detail from the designer.
###Chapter 965

Evelyn Sinclair didn't expect the daughter of Pacific Crest Enterprises' CEO to notice such a minor detail.

She even appeared genuinely pleased by it.

Richard Crest, the CEO, visibly relaxed when he realized Evelyn had no intention of mingling with his daughter.

The banquet officially commenced.

An elderly man, trembling with emotion, stepped onto the stage, his face alight with joy.

"It's an honor to have you all here tonight," he announced. "I have wonderful news to share."

This gathering had been arranged abruptly. Evelyn had assumed it was just another high-society event.

She never imagined it would be something so significant.

Cassandra Blake stood elegantly to the side.

Her posture was refined, her demeanor graceful. Tonight, she had deliberately foregone her usual bold fashion choices, opting instead for a conservative, sophisticated gown.

The old man gestured toward Cassandra, his voice thick with emotion. Tears welled in his eyes as he spoke.

"Thirty years ago, I lost my youngest daughter. Tonight, I've found her—Cassandra Blake."

The crowd erupted in shock.

Gasps filled the room. Evelyn was no exception—her lips parted slightly as she took in the old man's emotional display and Cassandra's carefully crafted expression of moved gratitude.

Years ago, Evelyn had heard the story—how the man had left his daughter at a client's doorstep while he conducted business inside. When he returned, she was gone. Decades of searching had left him hopeless.

Back then, the old man had been close with William Sterling. He used to dote on young Evelyn, always eager to hold her. Eventually, William grew wary of his friend's deteriorating mental state and distanced himself, forbidding Evelyn from interacting with him.

Evelyn knew the man still had two other children, but his grief for his missing daughter had never faded.

She never imagined that daughter would turn out to be Cassandra Blake.

Suddenly, a voice—young, indignant—spoke up behind her.

"That woman dreamed of climbing to the top. Now she's done it. But she's not the only heir in that family. Her siblings have already divided the fortune behind her back."

Evelyn turned to see Hailey Crest, the pampered young socialite. Her usually bright eyes were dark with disdain.

"You knew about this?" Evelyn asked, her tone flat.

Hailey lifted her chin, arrogance dripping from her every word. "Of course I knew. And I also know she's about to become my stepmother."

Evelyn's eyes flickered with surprise.

If Cassandra had once been desperate enough to become Richard Crest's lover, why would she still want him now that she had a powerful family backing her?

Romantic feelings were out of the question—it was hard to imagine anyone falling for a balding CEO.

"This old man is a hypocrite," Hailey muttered, keeping her voice low. "Using his long-lost daughter as a bargaining chip in a business marriage? How much affection could there really be? And yet he stands there crying like it's some heartfelt reunion."

Evelyn felt a strange mix of amusement and exasperation.

A teenager bad-mouthing someone in front of her was both ridiculous and oddly endearing.

She could read the girl's intentions instantly.

Hailey hated Cassandra. Did she think they were allies now?

Still, it was better than dealing with another woman like Cassandra.

Evelyn, who had no intention of engaging, sighed and explained patiently, "He's not crying out of love. After thirty years apart, what bond could they possibly have? He's crying out of guilt. But now that he sees Ms. Blake living well, that guilt will fade soon enough."

In an ordinary family, losing a child would have shattered everything.

But in a wealthy dynasty like this, children were plentiful—especially the silver-tongued, scheming kind.

The old man had two other heirs. He wasn't lacking in family.

He was just drowning in self-pity over the one he'd lost.
###Chapter 966

Hailey gave a quick nod.

As she turned, Evelyn Sinclair was already settling onto a plush sofa, casually pouring herself a glass of sparkling juice.

The shifting dynamics didn't faze Evelyn in the slightest.

Whether Cassandra Blake was truly Camron Dudley's daughter meant nothing to her. There were countless ways to handle that woman.

Harrison Blake sat nearby, his dark eyes occasionally flickering toward Evelyn with unreadable intensity.

Hailey wasted no time claiming the seat beside Evelyn.

"That time you had her committed to the psychiatric facility? She came crawling back to my father sobbing hysterically." Hailey rolled her eyes. "Dad got all sentimental and gifted her a $30 million penthouse. Suddenly her tantrum vanished."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. Richard Crest wouldn't dare cross her over some mistress - maintaining appearances mattered too much in their circles.

"After that old man acknowledged her, rumors started swirling about her marrying my father to 'strengthen corporate ties.'" Hailey's voice dripped with disgust. "The woman's deranged. My mother's been gone for years, and Dad's never lacked female company, but marriage? Seriously?"

She snatched up a wine glass and drained it in one angry gulp.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. A marriage alliance certainly trumped being a kept woman.

Rather than exposing Cassandra's ulterior motives with Pacific Crest Enterprises, the schemer had crafted herself a tragic love story. Marrying Richard Crest would cement her status, benefit the old man's business interests, and secure his favor - a trifecta of manipulation.

No wonder Cassandra had risen so quickly at Pacific Crest International. The woman's cunning was impressive.

As Evelyn pondered this, Hailey nudged her conspiratorially. "Your boytoy just bolted!"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Excuse me?"

Hailey grinned, eyes sparkling with mischief. "That washed-up actor with the domestic abuse rumors. Since when did you develop such questionable taste?"

"You're a minor," Evelyn ground out through clenched teeth. "Shouldn't you be focused on algebra?"

The warning sailed right over Hailey's head.

"All my classmates idolize you! You're basically the patron saint of independent women. Any man near you automatically becomes boytoy material."

Evelyn's smile froze. 'Is this really how teenagers see me now?'

She attempted damage control. "Those are just my—"

Hailey cut her off with an exaggerated eye roll. "Your boytoy just left with that witch! They're definitely plotting something. Want to catch them red-handed?"

Evelyn could only stare, speechless.

Hailey was already tugging her up, vibrating with excitement.

"Come on! I'll get photographic evidence!"

Resigned, Evelyn followed, keeping her movements discreet.

Harrison had indeed vanished. Caught up in conversation, Evelyn hadn't noticed his departure.

Hailey guided them through the maze of hallways until they reached a secluded corridor, their footsteps softening.

A breeze stirred the curtains ahead, revealing two shadowy figures - Harrison and Cassandra.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. 'So much for not knowing her,' she thought acidly. In the car, Harrison had sworn he'd never met Cassandra. Now here they were, whispering like conspirators.

She mentally drafted the contract termination paperwork. The penalty clause would bankrupt him.

Hailey already had her phone raised, camera app open.

Evelyn slipped behind a wine cabinet, close enough to eavesdrop.

"Since Evelyn brought you here, she still trusts you," Cassandra was saying, her voice honeyed. "Mr. Blake, you'll need to accelerate your timeline."
###Chapter 967

Harrison Blake stood silent. His lips remained sealed.

Cassandra Blake smirked. "During your contract period, I need you to deliberately leak scandals to reporters and gossip bloggers. Get caught in a compromising photo or even trash Sterling Enterprises' products in a private chat. That should be enough to ruin them."

Evelyn Sinclair felt ice crawl through her veins.

The urge to push Cassandra off the rooftop surged through her. She’s practically begging for it.

Finally, Harrison spoke, his voice sharp. "Sterling Enterprises won’t be ruined. If anything, I’ll be the first one to go down. Do you think I’m stupid?"

The domestic violence allegations had already destroyed his reputation. Another scandal would bury him for good.

Cassandra laughed. "Of course, I won’t leave you empty-handed. I’m the one who secured this contract for you. Once it’s done, I’ll make sure you’re paid handsomely. Even if you leave the industry, you’ll live comfortably. Face it—you’re already finished here."

Her words were brutal. Harrison fell silent again.

Cassandra thought she had him.

Then his cold voice cut through the air.

"Find someone else to commit career suicide for you. Surviving in this industry is the least of my concerns. But if I end up dead, will you clean up that mess?"

Cassandra’s expression darkened. "Don’t forget who got you this deal. Do you think Sterling’s endorsements grow on trees? There are A-listers ten times better than you waiting in line."

Harrison scoffed. "I signed with Sterling, not you. You’ve got a grudge against them, but you’re using their leverage to threaten me? I’ve got nothing left to lose. Cancel my contract if you dare."

With a mocking laugh, he turned and walked away.

Cassandra seethed. This washed-up actor, barely clinging to relevance, dares to talk to me like that?

As Harrison left, he had to pass the alcove where Evelyn and Hailey Crest were hiding.

Behind Evelyn, Hailey tugged at her sleeve, signaling a retreat.

Too late.

They were too close. Any movement would give them away.

Harrison’s grim face appeared. His gaze flickered toward them—then he strode past without a word, as if they were invisible.

Hailey exhaled in relief.

Evelyn shot her an amused look. "If you were this scared, why did you follow me?"

Hailey stared at her like she was an idiot.

Evelyn hadn’t bothered to lower her voice.

Cassandra heard.

Her voice turned sharp. "Who’s there?"

Hailey pulled at Evelyn, but Evelyn patted her wrist reassuringly before stepping out.

She leaned casually against the wine cabinet, a cold smile playing on her lips.

"E-Evelyn? How long have you been here?"

A rare flicker of panic crossed Cassandra’s face.

"Long enough," Evelyn said smoothly. "Didn’t want to interrupt your little chat. Congratulations on finding your family, by the way."

Cassandra’s expression twisted.

She gritted her teeth. "Evelyn, we never had a problem until you had me sent to a psychiatric hospital. You understand why I want revenge, don’t you?"
###Chapter 968

Evelyn arched a brow. Cassandra still expects me to sympathize with her revenge plot? How absurd.

A cold smirk curled her lips. "I understand perfectly."

Cassandra nodded, relief flashing in her eyes. "Good. Since Harrison refused, let's drop this matter. We'll move in the same circles—better to keep things civil."

Silence stretched between them. Beyond the doors, orchestral music swelled, but the alcove remained frozen in tension.

Evelyn studied Cassandra's carefully composed expression—then burst into laughter.

"Ms. Blake, I comprehend your underhanded tactics perfectly. But in our world, only the strong thrive." She stepped closer, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "You stole my lover first. Peace? Don't delude yourself. Cherish what little happiness you have left—because in my domain, your suffering has only just begun."

The threat landed like a blade. Cassandra's composure cracked.

Her domain? Panic clawed up her throat. I thought becoming the long-lost heiress leveled the playing field. That social decorum would force her to tolerate me. But this city breathes for Evelyn Sinclair.

With a final mocking smile, Evelyn turned. Her stilettos struck the marble like gunshots—each step reverberating through Cassandra's ribs.

Hailey bounded after Evelyn, eyes shining with hero worship. "That was epic! You obliterated her without lifting a finger!"

Evelyn suppressed an eye-roll at the girl's vulgarity. "Just words. You could've said them."

Hailey shook her head vigorously. "And get my allowance cut for a month? No thanks. That viper runs straight to Daddy with crocodile tears."

Ah. A veteran of parental manipulation. Evelyn's lips twitched. Golden light from the ballroom haloed them as she murmured, "Then tread carefully."

Grumbling, Hailey pulled out her phone. "The video I took isn't viral-worthy, but it's decent blackmail. Want it?"

Evelyn considered, then retrieved her own device. "Send it."

As the file transferred, Hailey bit her lip. "You won't block me afterward, right?"

"Why would I?"

"YES!" Hailey fist-pumped. "Do you know how many socialites would kill for your contact?"

Evelyn barely resisted facepalming. Is this what fame feels like? With a noncommittal wave, she escaped toward the exit.

Fatigue weighed on her by event's end. Yet Harrison waited patiently—ever the dutiful subordinate, posture impeccable despite the hours.

"Let's go," she said brusquely. The confrontation had reshaped her plans.

One thing was certain: Cassandra Blake's reckoning would be spectacular.
###Chapter 969

Evelyn Sinclair knew better than to rush terminating Harrison Blake's contract.

His reaction had caught her off guard. The man wasn't the fool she'd assumed him to be.

Then again, how could someone with his level of awareness be an abuser?

Curiosity flickered in her mind, but she kept the question to herself.

Harrison followed her down the steps, hesitating before finally speaking.

"Ms. Sinclair, I owe you an apology."

She turned to face him. "For what?"

"I lied earlier. I do know Cassandra Blake."

'Ah, so that's what this is about,' Evelyn thought.

Her expression remained unreadable. "Then why lie?"

His voice was low, edged with frost. "I knew she had ulterior motives for securing me this endorsement deal. I didn't want to be associated with her."

That explained the deception.

But when Harrison had spotted Evelyn behind the wine cabinet, his blood had run cold.

The night air bit into them.

Evelyn pulled her jacket tighter. "Fine."

She believed him. The man had no reason to lie now.

Her car pulled up to the curb.

"Ms. Sinclair, if you're terminating the contract... please be merciful. I refused her request." Harrison knew exactly how ruthless corporate legal teams could be.

They had no conscience.

Even when the company breached first, the spokesperson always ended up footing the bill.

Evelyn studied him, head tilted. "Terminating the contract?"

"Yes. I never expected to keep this endorsement anyway, but..." A bitter smile twisted his lips. "Right now, it's all I have. No other work."

The cold detachment he'd maintained all night finally cracked.

It took Evelyn a second to process. 'He's relying on the termination fee to survive? That's... tragic.'

Her stare must have been too blatant because Harrison looked away, pride stung.

A man could only humble himself for so long.

This was his limit.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her tone softening. "Given your honesty, I'll give you a chance. Come to my office tomorrow morning. We'll discuss the contract."

Harrison's eyes widened. A chance?

He hadn't dared hope for one from Sterling Enterprises.

Truthfully, when Cassandra had demanded he sabotage the company, part of him had been tempted. But her scheming was too obvious—she just wanted a fall guy.

Harrison was barely clinging to his career as it was.

If he'd obeyed her, it would have been professional suicide.

Before he could respond, Evelyn was already turning away.

The driver opened her car door, revealing another figure inside.

Harrison froze, making no move to follow.

Evelyn bent down and found Preston Sinclair waiting in the shadows.

Even in the dim interior, his features were striking—sharp yet warm, his gaze clear and piercing.

Surprise flickered through her. "What are you doing here?"

Preston had been waiting so long the car's scent clung to him. He smiled, reaching for her wrist to pull her inside.

But Evelyn's fitted skirt restricted her movement. As she stepped in, she stumbled straight into his arms.

Her nose bumped against his shoulder, his woodsy cologne enveloping her senses.

For a moment, she was disoriented.

Preston cupped her face, concern darkening his eyes. "Where did you get hurt?"

She laughed softly. "My nose."

It still throbbed faintly.
###Chapter 970

Preston Sinclair gently brushed his fingertips along Evelyn Sinclair's nose. His gaze softened with tenderness.

His heart ached seeing her hurt.

But Evelyn's pain faded quickly. Within moments, the discomfort vanished completely.

The driver cleared his throat. "Miss Sinclair, where should we head now?"

Preston and Evelyn suddenly pulled apart. Only then did they realize how close they'd been standing.

Evelyn, usually so guarded, hadn't even noticed her personal space being invaded.

A warm flush crept up her cheeks. She bit her lower lip to steady herself.

"The penthouse, please."

Preston's lips curved into a faint smile at her response.

He didn't dwell on her injury, instead answering her earlier question.

"Oliver fell asleep, so I came to pick you up."
"You just happened to be passing by?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. It was clearly out of his way.
"Of course. Right on my route."

'If he says so...' Evelyn thought skeptically.

The driver unexpectedly chimed in. "Mr. Sinclair waited in the car for two hours!"

The driver had gone for a late-night snack, smoked two cigarettes, and returned to find Preston still sitting motionless like a statue. In all his years, he'd never seen a man so patient.

Preston Sinclair, with his impeccable pedigree and matching social status, stood in stark contrast to Evelyn's ex-husband, Nathan Blackwood. Evelyn turned to study Preston's profile.

"You waited two hours?!"

Preston shot the driver an amused glance. 'Thanks for the assist.' Then he met Evelyn's gaze naturally. "Picking you up is never an inconvenience." Evelyn held her breath. The dim interior lights thankfully concealed her flushed ears.

'Flattery really does work wonders,' she mused.
"Don't you need to escort your colleague home?" Preston asked with exaggerated politeness.

Evelyn glanced out the window. Harrison Blake stood phone in hand, his expression unreadable.

She shook her head. "No, he's off duty now." Harrison had worked hard all evening. Preston raised an eyebrow. He'd only asked out of courtesy. Had Evelyn insisted on seeing Harrison home, it would have ruined his mood.

They arrived at the penthouse. Preston followed Evelyn inside, where they found Oliver asleep on the sofa.

Evelyn gave Preston a pointed look. 'This is how you treat your son?!' Preston rubbed his neck sheepishly. "How did he end up out here?"

The weak excuse made Evelyn roll her eyes. Preston whispered reassuringly.
"He's a tough boy. Can handle himself."

Evelyn moved toward the sofa, reaching for Oliver.
No child should sleep in the living room.

Preston intercepted her. He wouldn't let Evelyn strain herself carrying his son.

Oliver remained blissfully unaware as Preston lifted him gently.

Preston winked at Evelyn, mouthing "Sleep well" before carrying Oliver upstairs.

Their relationship hadn't progressed to cohabitation yet.

Preston felt content taking gradual steps into Evelyn's life. There was no rush - they had all the time in the world.

Evelyn stretched leisurely before changing into loungewear. A bubble bath and face mask would help her unwind.

As she soaked in the fragrant water, her AI assistant intercepted an incoming call.

"Madam, Isabella Montgomery is calling. Shall I connect?"

Evelyn opened her eyes. After a brief pause, she murmured, "Put her through."
###Chapter 971

Evelyn Sinclair answered Isabella Montgomery's call immediately.

Isabella's voice crackled through the line. "Evelyn, you know Dominic Kingsley, right? I need a favor."

Evelyn frowned. Whenever Dominic was involved, it usually meant dealing with online gossip.

"What kind of favor?"

Isabella didn’t hold back.

"That bastard Donovan Pierce posted his divorce certificate all over social media like he’s proud of it. Our mutual friends sent me screenshots, telling me to 'reconsider.' Reconsider my *ss! After seeing his true colors, I wish I could gouge my own eyes out for ever falling for him!"

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. "So what do you want to do about it?"

"I’m getting engaged to Lawrence Wellington. To make sure Donovan gets the message, I’m announcing it to the whole damn world!"

Evelyn could practically see Isabella’s furious expression through the phone. "Engaged? That’s sudden. You shouldn’t rush into this."

She warned Isabella—what if she regretted it later?

A brief silence stretched between them.

"Look, I’ll have to get engaged eventually anyway. Might as well use it to cut ties with Donovan for good. My mom’s right—I’m hopeless at business. If the company falls into my hands, it’ll collapse in five years. I need someone who can actually lead."

Evelyn paused. Something felt off. "Isabella, what’s going on?"

Her instincts prickled. This isn’t like Isabella. She doesn’t just surrender.

A shaky breath came through the line. "I’ve been watching my mom at the office these past few days. She’s exhausted. The board members are all vultures, and the company’s bleeding money. She told me straight—the only way the Wellingtons will invest is through marriage. She didn’t force me, but… I need to step up."

Her voice wavered, thick with bitterness.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "If it’s money you need, I can—"

"No. I won’t leech off you forever." Isabella forced a laugh. "Lawrence is decent. Older than I’d like, but miles better than Donovan. And it’s just an engagement. If I hate him later, I’ll call it off. But I need Dominic to make sure this news spreads. I want everyone to know Isabella Montgomery is off the market."

Evelyn considered it. An engagement wasn’t irreversible. "Fine. Tomorrow’s headlines will be all about you."

Isabella chuckled. "I’ll send photos later. Proof makes it real."

After a few more minutes, Evelyn hung up and dialed Dominic.

"Consider it done," he said smoothly. "By tomorrow, all of New York will be talking about Ms. Montgomery’s engagement."

Marriages among the elite were rarely this public. But when two powerful families joined forces, people paid attention.

Evelyn finished her nightly routine and slipped into bed, mind already racing with tomorrow’s fallout.
###Chapter 972

The golden morning light spilled through the curtains.

Evelyn Sinclair jolted awake to her ringing phone.

Only one person would dare call at this ungodly hour - Isabella Montgomery.

Despite the rude awakening, Evelyn couldn't bring herself to be angry.

She swiped to answer. "Do you know what time it is, Bella?"

Isabella's excited squeal pierced through the speaker. "Evie! Dominic Kingsley went all out! My face is plastered across every news outlet in the country!"

Evelyn rubbed her sleep-crusted eyes, voice still thick with drowsiness. "Don't celebrate yet. This much attention is dangerous. You'll have millions judging your every move."

The internet mob would either worship Isabella or wait for her slightest stumble to pounce.

One misstep, and those same well-wishers would become executioners.

"I don't give a damn what strangers think," Isabella scoffed. "I just want that bastard Donovan Pierce to see this and choke on his morning coffee!"

Evelyn stretched while keeping the phone on speaker, beginning her morning routine.

"Wasn't this too extreme? You sabotaged his deal with Kensington Group. That must've stung."

Isabella's laugh turned icy. "He deserved worse. Everything I revealed was true. If he's humiliated, that's his own damn fault."

A woman scorned could be terrifying indeed.

After exchanging a few more words, Evelyn hung up and finished getting ready. As she opened her apartment door, she froze.

Preston Sinclair and little Oliver stood waiting, matching grins plastered across their faces.

"Morning!" they chorused.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "What are you two doing here?"

Oliver barreled forward on stubby legs, wrapping himself around Evelyn's waist like a koala. "I wanna go to work with you today! Please? I'll be super good!"

Evelyn ruffled his wild curls, taking in his cherubic face - all dimples and innocence.

"Not today, sweetheart. I've got back-to-back meetings." She crouched to his level. "Why don't you spend the day with Daddy?"

Oliver's lower lip trembled. This was the first time his beloved Evie had refused him.

His tiny fists clenched with determination. 'I'll grow up fast and make so much money that Evie never has to work again!'

"Fine!" he declared. "I'm going to the library instead! Gotta study hard!"

Evelyn and Preston exchanged bewildered glances. 'What's going through that little head?' Preston wondered.

Preston's lips twitched. "Library after we drop Evie off, champ."

Of course, Preston had no intention of babysitting at the library. Once they reached the lobby, he discreetly texted Oliver's security detail to meet them there.

At Sterling Enterprises' gleaming tower, Evelyn stepped out of the car with a wave.

Oliver pressed his face against the window, watching her retreating form with heartbreaking adoration.

"Someday I'm gonna marry her," he sighed dreamily.

Preston's eye twitched. He fixed his son with a stern look. "Focus on your ABCs first."

Oliver crossed his arms. "She doesn't have a boyfriend, right? Daddy, you have to keep other boys away until I'm grown up!"

Preston barely suppressed a laugh as he scrolled through emails.

"Mmm," he hummed noncommittally, thinking, 'Oh I'll keep her safe alright - by making her mine first.'
###Chapter 973

Evelyn Sinclair strode into her office, where Bennett was already waiting with her usual coffee and a stack of documents neatly arranged on the desk.

"President Sinclair, everyone's assembled for the morning meeting. We can begin whenever you're ready."

She checked her watch. Perfect timing. With a nod, she rose from her chair.

"Harrison Blake arrived early this morning. He's been waiting for nearly an hour. Should we notify him first?"

Bennett couldn't hide his surprise. After last night's scandal, he'd assumed that would be the last time they'd see Harrison at Sterling Enterprises.

A celebrity with that kind of reputation was a liability—one that could tarnish the company's long-standing prestige.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "No. Let him wait."

If she made this easy for him, it would only encourage others to think they could exploit Sterling's resources.

Bennett nodded, and they left the office, heading straight for the conference room.

What was supposed to be a twenty-minute meeting stretched into an hour and a half.

The tension in the room was thick, but Evelyn remained unshaken, her composure unbreakable. By the time it ended, everyone except her was sweating.

Back in her office, Bennett prepared another cup of coffee.

Evelyn paused. "Is he still here?"

"Yes." Bennett knew she meant Harrison.

"Schedule a meeting with Dominic Kingsley. I'll go see him later." Unlike last night's verbal confrontation with Isabella, Harrison's situation was far messier.

Bennett nodded and left. Moments later, he confirmed the appointment.

Dominic Kingsley wouldn't dare put on airs with Evelyn—after all, Lucas Sterling was the real power behind Horizon Media, and Dominic was just an employee.

Evelyn took Harrison with her to Horizon Media.

Harrison remained eerily calm, following her without question. He didn't speak a word during the entire ride.

When they entered Dominic's office, they found more than just him waiting.

Lucas was there too, lounging in a chair like he owned the place.

Evelyn frowned. "What are you doing here?"

Lucas grinned. "Working."

What a joke.

She rolled her eyes at him before turning to Dominic with a polite smile. "Mr. Kingsley, it's been a while."

Dominic returned the smile. "You could've just called if you needed something. No need to come all this way."

Lucas chuckled from the side.

"Of course she had to come in person. You know how stubborn Little E can be."

If this weren't someone else's office, Evelyn would've thrown her stiletto at him.

She suppressed her irritation and gestured for Harrison to step forward.

"I don't need to introduce him, do I?"

Dominic, ever the seasoned industry player, delivered his practiced response flawlessly.

"Mr. Blake, you've kept a low profile lately. Your talent is undeniable—it's a shame outside matters have overshadowed it. But gold always shines. With your skills, you'll reclaim your place in no time."

Evelyn nearly laughed.

Harrison kept his head slightly bowed, his expression unreadable. His posture was indifferent, almost detached.

Lucas glanced between him and Evelyn, then smirked.

"You broke up with Preston and now you're into him? Your taste changes fast."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Dominic didn't even dare breathe.

Lucas could tease Evelyn—no one else would dare.

She shot him a frosty glare. "Do you have a death wish?"

Lucas immediately wiped the smirk off his face. "Don't tattle to Dad. If you need help, just ask me."

As if.

Evelyn ignored him.
###Chapter 974

Evelyn Sinclair perched elegantly on the opposite sofa, motioning for Harrison Blake to take a seat beside her.

"Harrison is the new face of Sterling Enterprises' latest product line."

The room froze. Lucas Sterling shot up from his chair, his expression darkening. "Excuse me?" His reaction bordered on theatrical.

Harrison remained unfazed by Lucas's outburst.

At this point, scandal was nothing new to him.

Dominic Kingsley, however, stayed composed. After the initial shock wore off, he studied Harrison with a calculating gaze, as if weighing unseen possibilities.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"It was an unexpected choice, but I'm exploring alternatives to terminating his contract."

Both Lucas and Dominic stared at her like she'd lost her mind.

"Damage control, perhaps?" Evelyn suggested. Lucas scoffed, rolling his eyes dramatically.

Dominic pinched the bridge of his nose. No wonder Evelyn came in person. This is a PR nightmare.

"Regardless, he's here now. Figure out how to rehabilitate his image before we announce the campaign." Evelyn shrugged.

Lucas leaned in, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Just pick someone else. The industry's crawling with fresh talent—exactly your type."

Evelyn shot him a withering glare. "If it were that simple, would I be here? Fix this. You're an A-lister—surely you have connections."

Lucas groaned. The last thing he wanted was to get tangled in this mess.

After a tense silence, Dominic cleared his throat.

"Let's hear Mr. Blake's side first. Tabloids twist everything. We need facts before strategizing."

Evelyn nodded approvingly. Dominic's a professional. Lucas is just decorative.

All eyes turned to Harrison.

His gaze dropped slightly, the sharp angles of his face accentuating his aloof demeanor. When he finally spoke, his voice was steady.

"Ever since that photo of me hitting someone surfaced, the rumors spiraled." A pause. "The person I struck was my ex-wife."

Lucas reclined, suddenly invested.

Dominic observed Harrison like a human lie detector.

"There was a reason, but I didn't defend myself. Explaining now would seem like desperate justification."

"Try us," Dominic pressed.

"I was on set when my mother called. She'd walked in on my ex-wife and a director... in our home."

Harrison's jaw tightened.

"By the time I got there, they'd pushed my mother down the stairs. I lost control. Went after the director in our lobby. My ex-wife intervened—that's when I hit her."

The air in the office turned glacial.

No wonder he'd rather tank his career than air that humiliation.

Harrison's interlaced fingers whitened. A vein pulsed near his temple, his expression rigid with suppressed emotion.

The man wasn't indifferent—he was barely holding it together.
###Chapter 975

Dominic Kingsley shook his head, his gaze filled with pity as he studied Harrison Blake.

"Your career was skyrocketing back then. Every paparazzi in the city wanted your picture."

"And then you got caught hitting your ex-wife."

The aftermath was brutal. Domestic violence allegations stuck to his name like glue. The media didn’t care about the truth—only the scandal.

Harrison let out a bitter laugh.

"Thank God my manager didn’t drop me. Otherwise, I’d be starving right now."

His manager was sharp, well-connected, and relentless. He fought tooth and nail to keep Harrison afloat, convinced he still had a shot in the industry.

Lucas Sterling stayed silent, lips pressed tight. Evelyn Sinclair, however, couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy.

The truth behind the "abuser" label was tragic.

"How’s your mother now?" she asked.

Harrison’s lips curved slightly. "She’s fine. I sent her back to our hometown. She doesn’t even know how bad things are for me."

Evelyn exhaled, turning to Dominic. "So, do you have a plan?"

Dominic hesitated.

This wasn’t easy.

Rebuilding the reputation of a scandal-ridden actor labeled as an abuser? Expensive. Difficult. But Evelyn had asked, so refusal wasn’t an option.

"There’s a way. But it’ll take time."

"How long?"

"At least six months."

Evelyn frowned.

The endorsement deal was supposed to launch in three. Six months was too long.

Lucas chuckled. "Six months is generous. We have to reshape public perception slowly. Make it organic—otherwise, it’ll look staged. People won’t believe it."

His words were blunt. Harrison’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue. Lucas wasn’t wrong. The internet wasn’t easily fooled.

Evelyn bit her lip. "Where do we start?"

Dominic thought for a moment.

"We’ll have PR draft multiple strategies, then pick the strongest. The goal is simple—control the narrative. Once we do that, rehabilitating Harrison’s image is just a matter of time."

Lucas nodded.

"I remember you started in film. A few directors still respect your work. Let’s see if they have any roles for you. Prove your talent first—win the audience back with your skills."

He glanced at Dominic. "You’ll handle it?"

Dominic smirked. "Obviously."

Harrison’s head snapped up, shock flashing across his face.

Lucas was offering him a lifeline. A chance to act again.

I can start over.

He stood abruptly, emotion choking his voice.

"Thank you—"

Thank you, Sterling Enterprises, for not discarding me like trash. For giving me a second chance.

Lucas waved him off. "Don’t thank me. Sterling Enterprises is family."

And family doesn’t suffer.

Dominic rolled his eyes. Dramatic as always.

Evelyn smiled, relieved.

"Then I’ll leave him to you two. I’ll adjust my schedule as much as possible. He’ll contact you directly from now on."

She grabbed her bag. "Let’s go. Lunch is on me." She nodded at Harrison.

Dominic and Lucas exchanged looks.

What about us? Do we not eat?
###Chapter 976

Dominic Kingsley and Lucas Sterling watched as Evelyn Sinclair led Harrison Blake out. Harrison's forced smile was painfully obvious.

Dominic clicked his tongue, glancing at Lucas. "Is she really your sister?"

Lucas sighed, his expression helpless. "Unfortunately, yes."

He wished he could deny it, but the truth was undeniable.

Evelyn was starving after working all morning. She found a quiet restaurant nearby, one with few patrons.

She chose a seat by the window, the sunlight casting a soft glow over the table.

Harrison sat across from her, the shadows in his eyes lighter than before.

He smiled awkwardly. "Ms. Sinclair, lunch is on me."

Evelyn met his gaze. "Sure."

It was just a meal—who paid didn’t matter.

This was Harrison’s way of thanking her, so she accepted. After ordering, she excused herself to the restroom.

When she returned, someone else occupied her seat.

The man’s broad shoulders and cold aura were unmistakable, even from meters away.

Nathan Blackwood.

Harrison sat stiffly across from him, clearly uncomfortable.

Nathan said something that made Harrison’s expression darken.

Evelyn considered turning around and leaving. But for Harrison’s sake, she approached. Her voice was flat. "Mr. Blackwood, you’re in the wrong seat."

It had been days since they’d last seen each other.

Nathan’s presence was as commanding as ever, his chilling aura more intense than before. He turned, his gaze locking onto her. A slow, calculated smile curved his lips. "I saw an acquaintance and came to say hello. I didn’t expect you to be here."

Harrison opened his mouth, but a sharp look from Nathan silenced him. Instead, he shook his head subtly at Evelyn, silently contradicting Nathan’s words.

Evelyn knew Nathan was lying. If Harrison had known him, he wouldn’t have been in such a state earlier.

Her expression remained indifferent. "Mr. Blackwood, we haven’t eaten yet."

Her implication was clear—leave.

Nathan’s cold eyes softened slightly, though the tension in his jaw betrayed his calm facade. "What a coincidence. I haven’t eaten either. We’ll dine together."

He forced a composed demeanor, but the suppressed fury in his gaze was unmistakable. He had just finished a business lunch when he spotted Evelyn laughing with Harrison.

The sight had been like a knife to his chest.

Because Evelyn wasn’t just gentle with Preston Sinclair. She was kind to others too.

Everyone but him.

Evelyn stood motionless, her reluctance obvious.

Nathan’s patience snapped. His voice dropped, low and rough. "What? Can’t friends share a meal? Will Preston Sinclair throw a fit?" His tone turned mocking. "Or does he not realize Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Industries are bound together forever?"

Evelyn’s brows furrowed. Before she could respond, Nathan leaned forward, his voice a dangerous whisper.

"How is it you can sit with him but not with me?" His hands clenched on the table, veins straining. "Have your tastes changed, Evelyn?"

The air between them turned frigid.

Harrison glanced at Evelyn, torn. Should I explain? But she hadn’t asked him to.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "When something isn’t to my taste, I change it."

Nathan’s smirk froze.
###Chapter 977

Evelyn had completely lost her appetite after everything that had happened.

She turned her head toward Harrison. "Let's go. I'm not hungry anymore."

Harrison immediately stood up to settle the bill.

Evelyn and Nathan locked eyes in a silent battle of wills, neither willing to back down first. It felt like an intense staring contest.

Eventually, Nathan lowered his gaze first. When he met Evelyn's gentle yet icy stare, an indescribable ache twisted in his chest.

The pain was sharp and bitter.

If Nathan were truly ruthless, he had countless underhanded methods to take her away and keep her hidden - ensuring Evelyn would only ever see him for the rest of her life.

Yet he couldn't bring himself to do it.

Nathan had suppressed these dark thoughts through countless sleepless nights.

He kept wondering why Evelyn chose Preston over him.

Perhaps deep down, Nathan already knew the answer - because Preston would never resort to such dark, despicable tactics.

Preston loved her openly, unafraid of the shadows.

Nathan's usually cold, hard expression crumbled. His eyes reddened slightly as his face tightened with emotion.

He felt both resentful and wronged.

His Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

In the end, Nathan was the first to break the silence with an apology. He shouldn't have said those things to her.

'How could I stoop so low just to get attention from someone as wonderful as Evelyn? It's childish and ridiculous,' Nathan thought.

Evelyn was thoroughly confused by Nathan's erratic behavior.

One moment he provoked her, the next he apologized. 'Is he bipolar or something?' she wondered.

Nathan pressed his lips together before speaking in a deep voice. "Jealousy overwhelmed me. Seeing you with another man... I lost control. That was my fault."

Evelyn frowned. 'Definitely bipolar,' she concluded.

Nathan watched her carefully, a rare bitterness touching his lips. "But you promised we could be friends, yet you won't even share a meal with me. You broke your word first."

Evelyn found herself speechless. The man before her, usually as fierce as a panther, now resembled nothing more than a wounded puppy. "Mr. Blackwood, you were clearly intimidating my guest. Don't think I didn't notice."

'Does he think I'm blind?' she thought.

Nathan's voice dropped lower. "I wasn't. I simply asked him to introduce himself." Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes.

'Introduce himself? Typical CEO behavior. I'm a CEO too, but clearly not as dramatic as Nathan.'

"If he's upset, I'll go apologize?" Nathan offered, his tone suddenly patient and coaxing.

"No need. You'd probably scare him to death," Evelyn replied coldly.

Nathan chuckled softly. He lowered his gaze slightly, watching her quietly. "I know I upset you. I'm trying to control my emotions. Don't worry - I would never hurt you, nor would I intentionally target him."

Nathan wouldn't stoop to intentionally harming Preston. That would be beneath him.

Seeing Nathan's changed attitude, Evelyn thought he'd finally come to his senses. Reflecting on her earlier behavior, she realized she'd been unreasonable too.

She shared some blame in this situation.

"Good. Remember what you said."

Evelyn pursed her lips and turned to leave. Suddenly, Nathan caught her wrist - his grip warm yet tense.

"Evelyn... we're still friends, right?"

This was the only concession he could make.

Nathan couldn't bear losing his place by Evelyn's side.

The difference between "friend" and "boyfriend" was just one syllable.

Nathan was nothing if not patient - and extremely confident.

Evelyn sensed something inexplicably off about Nathan's mood.

This wasn't his usual reaction.

But Evelyn didn't have time to analyze it deeply. "Right. Friends," she answered perfunctorily.
###Chapter 978

Nathan released Evelyn's hand the moment he heard her answer, a smug satisfaction flashing in his eyes.

Evelyn snatched her hand back immediately. She didn't even bother with formalities - all she wanted was to put as much distance between them as possible.

"That man's mood swings are absolutely insufferable," she fumed under her breath.

At the restaurant entrance, Harrison waited with several takeout containers in hand. The sight made Evelyn pause.

He pressed his lips together before extending the food toward her. "Thought you might get hungry at the office. They'd already served these dishes, so I had them packed."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. The difference in his demeanor before and after resolving his issue was staggering.

She accepted the bag. "Shall we head back together?"

Harrison shook his head after a brief hesitation. "My manager scheduled an appearance. Though I'm not the main attraction, it's still important."

Evelyn nodded in understanding. His management contract wasn't with Horizon Media, after all. Refusing their arrangements wasn't an option.

"Then I'll be going. Contact Dominic if you need anything." With that, she turned toward her car.

Harrison remained until her vehicle disappeared from view. Days later, Lucas casually mentioned Harrison landing a lead role in an upcoming film.

Evelyn frowned during their phone call. "With all his scandals, isn't a leading role too high-profile? Shouldn't he take supporting roles to rebuild his image?"

Lucas chuckled. "Clever thought. But this script is special - low budget, high quality. The protagonist's role could skyrocket his popularity if he delivers. Let's see how it plays out."

"You're amazing, as always," Evelyn praised.

"Cut the flattery. If you're truly grateful, take Natalie and me to dinner. I haven't seen her lately."

"She's clearly avoiding you," Evelyn retorted before hanging up, leaving Lucas speechless.

Back at Sterling Enterprises...

Evelyn had just settled into her office when Bennett arrived with an unexpected delivery - a bouquet of delicate Swiss lilies in an elegant box, their fragrance light and refreshing.

"Who sent these?" she asked, assuming they were from Preston, who'd gifted similar flowers recently.

"Harrison," Bennett answered.

Evelyn's smile froze.

"Since he's Mr. Blackwood's assistant, he didn't just leave them at reception. Insisted they notify me directly." Bennett explained how refusal became impossible.

Nathan had orchestrated this very public gesture - sending flowers through his assistant to broadcast that he hadn't given up on Evelyn. A clear warning to potential suitors.

Evelyn scoffed. "That man's schemes know no bounds."

Bennett hesitantly relayed Harrison's message: "Mr. Blackwood said if you dislike Harrison delivering them, he'll come personally from now on."

An ultimatum. Nathan was forcing her acceptance.

Evelyn initially planned to return the flowers, but the threat of daily Nathan visits changed her mind. "Keep them, but give them away. Don't bring them to me again."

Bennett nodded and exited.

Days later, an unwelcome visitor arrived.

As Evelyn concluded a meeting, Bennett approached. "Isaiah Sinclair has been waiting for some time."

Evelyn's expression darkened. Since Isaiah's initial proposal at Sterling Manor, she'd deliberately avoided responding.

Apparently, his patience had run out.
###Chapter 979

Few were aware of the true nature between Evelyn Sinclair and Preston Sinclair's relationship, which meant Isaiah Sinclair remained in the dark as well.

Perhaps Isaiah still believed Preston was desperately chasing after Evelyn.

Using Evelyn to destroy Preston was a meticulously crafted scheme.

Evelyn's lips curled slightly. "Let him in." Bennett nodded and stepped out.

Moments later, Isaiah Sinclair strode in, dressed impeccably.

His smile carried the arrogance typical of Pacifica's elite, laced with an unmistakable air of self-importance.

What a perfectly polished villain.

"Ms. Sterling, it's been too long—"

Evelyn smiled and rose to shake his hand. They settled onto the sofa, and Bennett served coffee.

"Mr. Sinclair, indeed, it has. Are you adjusting well to Montecito?"

Isaiah gave a helpless chuckle. "Isn't this kind of business trip routine for people like us? Even if I'm not comfortable, I have to adapt."

Evelyn arched a brow, inwardly scoffing, though her expression remained neutral. "It's rare for you to visit Montecito. I should have invited you to dinner, but I didn’t want to disrupt your schedule. I’ve also been swamped lately—barely able to step away from work. My apologies for the lack of hospitality."

A flicker of irritation crossed Isaiah’s eyes.

Her words were clear—she wouldn’t even spare him a meal.

And she was making it obvious he wasn’t a priority.

Isaiah forced a laugh. "Of course, I came unannounced. This visit is actually about our companies’ potential collaboration. Sloan Corporation plans to expand into Montecito soon. There will be plenty of opportunities to work together." He dangled the bait, watching for her reaction.

Evelyn merely sipped her coffee, unfazed. "That would be something to look forward to."

After all, partnering with Sloan Corporation was a dream for countless businesses.

How is this woman so unshakable? Isaiah thought.

His patience thinning, he cut to the chase. "Ms. Sterling, have you reconsidered my proposal? The Sinclair family is eager for Preston’s return. My brother is gravely ill—on his deathbed. If Preston doesn’t come back to see his father, he’ll live with regret."

Evelyn paused, then slowly set down her cup.

"If that’s the case, you should speak to Preston directly. I’m sure he’ll make the right choice."

"He refuses to set foot in the Sinclair mansion. He needs a push. Ms. Sterling, in Montecito, your partnership is crucial to his career. If you terminate your contract with him and persuade him to return to the family, he’ll respect your decision."

Isaiah’s gaze was relentless. Evelyn lowered her lashes, smiling faintly.

"Preston is a vital partner to Sterling Enterprises. Breaking our contract mid-project would incur astronomical compensation. It’s not feasible from any angle."

"If Sterling Enterprises severs ties with Preston, you won’t need to worry about compensation. Once I bring him back to Pacifica, you won’t pay a cent."

Isaiah’s lips curved into a dazzling smile.

Evelyn scoffed internally. "It’s not that I distrust you, but in business, promises mean nothing without guarantees. Empty words don’t inspire confidence."

Isaiah’s expression stiffened. "Ms. Sterling, are you saying—"

"Mr. Sinclair, if you’re serious, we can have our lawyers draft a contract. If Preston Sinclair demands compensation, will Sloan Corporation cover it—or will you personally pay on Sterling Enterprises’ behalf?"

Isaiah’s smile vanished.
###Chapter 980

Isaiah Sinclair knew this contract was a trap.

Signing it would mean admitting to commercial fraud.

In Montecito, he didn't have the same unchecked power as he did in Pacifica.

Worse, if Preston Sinclair got his hands on this document, Isaiah would be at his mercy.

Rumors painted Evelyn as a spoiled heiress, but she was sharper than anyone gave her credit for.

Seeing his hesitation, Evelyn smirked. Her gaze turned icy.

"Integrity is non-negotiable for Sterling Enterprises. Betraying a partner for short-term gain? That’s how reputations are destroyed."

She leaned back, fingers tapping the desk. "And let’s be clear—business and personal matters stay separate. I don’t control Preston’s decisions."

Isaiah’s expression darkened. The air in the room thickened with tension.

His eyes bore into her, a flicker of frustration crossing his face.

Stunning but stubborn. I’ve never met a woman who refuses to bend.

He’d dealt with plenty of society women like Evelyn. They played hard to get, but secretly craved control—twisting men’s lives for their own satisfaction before walking away.

Yet Evelyn radiated cold indifference. Unreachable. Unshakable.

Who does she think she is?

When he stayed silent, Evelyn checked her watch.

"Mr. Sinclair, I have another meeting."

A clear dismissal.

Isaiah’s jaw clenched. His breath came heavier.

"You’re really refusing me?"

His tone was rough, edged with a threat.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "Yes."

A single word. A slap in the face.

Isaiah stood abruptly, jerking his suit jacket into place. "Then I won’t waste your time."

He stormed out without another glance.

Evelyn didn’t bother rising. She stayed seated, posture relaxed.

"Bennett, escort our guest."

Her assistant opened the door. "This way, Mr. Sinclair."

Isaiah shot her one last glare before leaving.

Twenty minutes later, Bennett returned.

"Mr. Sinclair went straight to Mr. Sterling’s office. Demanded a meeting."

Evelyn arched a brow. Still trying?

"And?"

"President Sterling was in a conference. Mr. Sinclair waited, but when it ended, President Sterling left with a client instead."

Evelyn smirked. Did Isaiah really think going over her head would work?

Sterling Enterprises stood united.

Alone again, she walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the clear sky.

Today had been satisfying.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

Assuming it was Bennett, she didn’t turn.

"Come in."
###Chapter 981

The silence stretched on endlessly after the footsteps ceased.

Evelyn had just begun to sense something was amiss when a familiar baritone voice shattered the quiet.

"What has captured your attention so completely?"

She froze, turning to find Preston Sinclair's towering frame filling the doorway.

"Why are you here?"

Preston's lips curved into that gentle smile she'd grown accustomed to. His lowered brows and warm gaze softened his usually sharp features.

"Must I have a reason to visit my beloved?"

He stood with arms open, that unspoken invitation clear in his eyes. Evelyn stiffened. The man was shamelessly obvious.

By now, she'd grown accustomed to Preston's boundary-pushing tendencies.

His touch no longer startled her. Worse still, she'd developed an addiction to his sandalwood scent that clung to his clothes.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn stepped forward and allowed herself to be enveloped in his embrace.

The deep chuckle that vibrated through his chest sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

She burned.

Instinct screamed to flee, but Preston's arms tightened around her waist - that perfect balance of gentle yet unyielding.

His hands settled at the small of her back as he followed her earlier line of sight.

"Quite the view..." His whisper tickled her ear like a feather's caress.

Electricity shot down her spine. The double meaning in his words was unmistakable, yet Evelyn refused to assume he meant her. She squirmed slightly, and Preston - ever the strategist - released her. He knew better than to push too far. Today's victory was sufficient.

Evelyn turned with practiced nonchalance, settling into the chair before the panoramic window.

"Why didn't you bring Oliver?"

Preston's expression instantly morphed into something wounded.

"I arranged for his tutor and security detail to occupy him at the library until evening." His sigh was theatrical. "Though clearly, I'm no match for my son's charm."

Evelyn gestured to the opposing chair without comment.

Preston crossed the room, sunlight sculpting dramatic shadows around his frame as he sat. His long legs folded with effortless grace, that aristocratic profile softened by the golden light.

For once, his usual predatory edge was absent. Only quiet intensity remained as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

She averted her eyes first.

"You're terrible - manipulating children like that."

Preston's laughter rang out. "Boys require discipline. Indulge them once, and they'll monopolize your attention." The way Oliver gravitated toward Evelyn drove him mad.

The mention of children reminded her. "Isaiah came by earlier."

Preston showed no surprise. As if he'd anticipated this move.

"I know."

"You knew?"

He nodded, ice flashing in his eyes before vanishing. "Did you truly think he'd surrender so easily? The man's desperate for your compliance - his final move to humiliate me completely."

Evelyn hesitated, conflict playing across her features.

She wanted to ask but feared overstepping.

Preston read her perfectly. "What else did he say?"

"Just... about your father's condition." She studied him carefully. "Are you certain you won't visit?"

If the rumors proved true, this might haunt Preston forever.

His lashes lowered, veiling the storm in his eyes. "That chapter closed when I left the Sinclair name behind. His fate no longer concerns me."

The forced calm in his voice betrayed the tempest beneath.

Evelyn observed him silently before offering a small smile. Some wounds ran too deep to probe.
###Chapter 982

Silence stretched between them.

Preston Sinclair suddenly looked up, his usual warm smile playing on his lips.

"I heard Nathan sent you flowers."

Evelyn's grip on her cup tightened slightly. He knew about that?

She wondered if he had someone watching her every move.

Blinking, she replied, "He had Harrison deliver them. I gave them to Bennett."

It was the easiest way to avoid unnecessary drama.

Preston chuckled, understanding her perfectly. "Won't Bennett have a headache?"

Evelyn shrugged helplessly.

She wasn't about to let Nathan's petty gestures ruin her peace.

Things were finally settling down between them all. Preston paused, his gaze softening as he studied her.

"Don't worry. I'll talk to him myself. There's no reason for you to shield me."

Ever since they'd gotten together, Evelyn had been the one handling Nathan.

To her, it was just something she did—no big deal.

But Preston saw it differently.

This was exactly what Nathan wanted.

If Preston kept hiding behind Evelyn, Nathan would only grow more dismissive. Preston knew Nathan was waiting for a direct confrontation.

Evelyn, however, didn’t agree.

"What’s there to say to him? Who I choose to be with is none of his business."

She’d made that clear a hundred times.

Preston smirked. "I need to go rub it in his face. Maybe it’ll finally make him explode."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

She never took Preston for the petty type.

They laughed and talked for a while longer, with Bennett even ordering dinner for them. It was his first time witnessing a couple who practically dated in the office. Unbelievable.

Little Oliver, having fallen asleep in the library, woke up cranky and called Preston to pick him up.

Preston had no choice but to oblige.

Grabbing his jacket, he turned back to Evelyn with effortless elegance. "Coming with me?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Dad’s cooking tonight. I’m heading back to Sterling Manor."

Disappointment flickered across Preston’s face. "I won’t see you for hours. Just thinking about it hurts."

"Then why don’t you come along?" she teased.

Preston considered it seriously. "Can I?"

Evelyn’s smile faltered. She’d been joking, but he wasn’t.

Bringing Preston home would imply marriage—something she wasn’t ready to discuss.

Seeing her hesitation, Preston laughed.

"Not today. Showing up empty-handed would get me kicked out."

She exhaled in relief. "Next time, then. Bye!"

Without waiting for his response, she waved him off.

Evelyn never hid her emotions.

With her blunt personality, how much effort had the Sterlings put into molding her for this role?

Preston smiled to himself and left.

But instead of heading to the library, his car took the opposite direction.

Blackwood Industries.

Though it was nearly quitting time, someone like Nathan never left on schedule.

Time was money.

When Harrison spotted Preston, his shock was palpable.

"Harrison, right? Could you check if Mr. Blackwood is available?"

Harrison knew Nathan was in a video conference—one he hated being interrupted during.

But Preston wasn’t just anyone.

Forget his wealth—even if Nathan tried, securing a partnership with Preston was nearly impossible.

And now, Preston was Evelyn’s boyfriend.
###Chapter 983

Harrison knocked gently before entering Nathan Blackwood's office.

The air was thick with tension. Nathan's piercing gaze remained fixed on his computer screen, his jaw clenched as he listened to the report.

Being interrupted clearly displeased him. His cold eyes flicked toward Harrison, sharp enough to cut glass.

Harrison swallowed hard, then mouthed two words. "Preston Sinclair."

Nathan's entire body stilled.

Without hesitation, he ended the video call in French and shut his laptop with a snap.

"Speak."

Harrison exhaled. "Mr. Sinclair is here. He asked if you were available."

Normally, Harrison would have made anyone wait until Nathan finished his meeting.

But Preston Sinclair wasn't just anyone.

If they kept him waiting even a minute, he'd walk out without hesitation.

Nathan's expression darkened. He reached for the cigarette case on his desk, lighting one with deliberate slowness. The smoke curled around him as he exhaled, his voice icy.

"Let him in."

Harrison nodded and stepped out. 'Mr. Blackwood's smoking has gotten worse lately...'

Preston Sinclair was the epitome of composure—always polite, always controlled, no matter the situation.

So when he walked in and found Nathan staring at him like a predator eyeing its prey, he didn’t flinch.

Instead, he smiled. "Mr. Blackwood. It’s been a while."

Nathan’s shirt was slightly undone at the collar, his posture radiating danger. He crushed his cigarette into the ashtray, his voice dripping with venom.

"I didn’t think you’d have the guts to show your face here."

He had wanted Preston dead from the moment the man dared to get close to Evelyn.

That he hadn’t succeeded yet didn’t mean he’d given up.

Preston remained unshaken, his smile never wavering. He unbuttoned his suit jacket with effortless grace before taking a seat across from Nathan.

"I’m here on behalf of my girlfriend," he said smoothly. "She’d appreciate it if you stopped sending flowers and gifts. It’s causing unnecessary misunderstandings."

Nathan’s entire body tensed.

"On whose behalf?" His voice was dangerously soft.

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Preston met his gaze head-on, his own expression cool and unreadable.

"My girlfriend."

Each word was deliberate.

He wasn’t afraid.

If he were, he wouldn’t have come.

A faint smirk touched his lips. "Surely you’ve accepted reality by now. Evelyn has nothing to do with you anymore. She’s mine."

Nathan’s control snapped.

His fist slammed onto the desk with a force that made the wood groan. Veins stood out along his forearm as his voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"Do you really think I won’t make you disappear?"

He knew Preston had connections—knew the Sinclair name carried weight in Pacifica.

But here?

In his city?

Making a man vanish wasn’t difficult.
###Chapter 984

The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on.

Preston's smirk vanished.

"You dare lay a hand on me? Do you think Evelyn would stand for that?"

Last time, she'd nearly cut ties with Nathan over that internet scandal.

Nathan's dark eyes narrowed into slits, icy and dangerous.

Preston leaned back. "I know Isaiah came to you. Bet he spilled all my secrets, didn't he?"

Nathan scoffed. "So that's why you're here."

It clicked.

Isaiah had indeed been loose-lipped.

The Sinclair empire was a prize too tempting to ignore. Nathan had initially hesitated, wary of their influence—but Isaiah? The man was a walking liability. Nothing like his sharp, calculating nephew.

When Isaiah had willingly handed himself over, Nathan hadn't hesitated to exploit it. A few carefully placed words, and the fool spilled everything. How someone so incompetent held power was beyond him.

Nathan's gaze turned glacial. "Afraid I'll tell Evelyn you murdered your own mother? That you've been lusting after your sister-in-law? Or that you pushed your father down the stairs, leaving him paralyzed?" His lips curled. "No wonder the Sinclairs disowned you."

When Nathan first uncovered the truth, his first instinct had been to storm into Evelyn's life and rip the mask off Preston's lies. But Theodore had warned him—timing was everything.

His investigators had hit walls. The Sinclairs kept their skeletons locked tight. Yet Isaiah? One conversation, and the man folded like cheap paper.

Preston's fingers twitched, knuckles whitening. But his voice stayed light. "If you've got so much dirt, why haven't you told her?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

Preston chuckled. "Ah. You're not sure if it's true." He tilted his head. "I'm touched you think so highly of me."

Most men would've rushed to expose him.

"I won't let Evelyn get hurt," Nathan bit out. "Stay away from her, or I'll make sure she knows exactly what you are."

Preston rubbed his temple, amused. "How noble."

So Nathan actually cared.

He met Nathan's gaze, his own sharp and unreadable.

"Whatever deal you made with Isaiah—keep my relationship with Evelyn out of it."

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Or what?"

"Isaiah's specialty is playing the victim." Preston smiled. "The Sinclairs are vipers. Drag Evelyn into this, and neither of us wins."

Nathan's laugh was bitter.

"She'll regret this eventually. But until then?" His voice dropped to a threat. "No one needs to know she's making a mistake."
###Chapter 985

Preston Sinclair raised his eyebrows. A cold smirk played on his lips.

Yet, he felt relief. His objective had been achieved—it was time to leave.

Slowly, Preston stood, his tone deliberately grating.

"I should take my leave now, Mr. Blackwood. Evelyn will worry if I linger any longer."

He ignored Nathan’s murderous glare, rising smoothly. A faint, knowing smile curved his lips.

Nathan’s control snapped. His eyes darkened, crimson fury flashing like a blade unsheathed.

This damned Preston Sinclair—always pushing him to the edge.

A second later, restraint shattered. Blood roared in Nathan’s veins, his rage erupting.

In one violent motion, he vaulted over the desk, seized Preston’s collar, and yanked him forward. His fist swung.

"Mark my words, Preston. You won’t walk away unscathed."

Blood trickled from the corner of Preston’s mouth. A bruise bloomed across half his face, staining his usually composed features with vivid color.

He wiped the blood away, unfazed. No anger. No retaliation. As if this were expected.

"Goodbye, Mr. Blackwood."

With one last glance, he turned, stepping out of the office thick with icy tension. Behind him, something shattered—violently.

Preston spared a thought for the expensive ornament now in pieces. A shame.

Harrison watched Preston exit, bruised but oddly pleased. Confusion flickered. Why is he smiling after getting punched?

Then it clicked.

Was this a play for sympathy?

Sterling Manor

Evelyn Sinclair froze the moment she stepped inside. Amelia was here.

Lucas, usually elusive, trailed the butler like a dutiful shadow.

William Sterling greeted her with a warm chuckle. "What kept you so long?"

The room buzzed with laughter. Evelyn blinked, baffled, but quickly composed herself.

"You should’ve warned me Amelia was visiting," she said, flustered. "I came back empty-handed."

Amelia smiled gently. "No need for formalities. I didn’t come for gifts."

William patted her shoulder, amused. "Relax. Let Lucas handle the gifting on your behalf."

Lucas emerged from the kitchen, apron-clad. "Where are your manners?"

They really exploited him without mercy.

Evelyn grinned. Perfect. Third Brother can’t refuse.

Lucas rolled his eyes and retreated.

One against four? Not a fight worth picking.

Evelyn settled beside William, noting the softness in his gaze as he watched Amelia. A warmth she hadn’t seen before.

He played the patriarch, but his smile betrayed sheer approval.

Clearly, he adored this future daughter-in-law.

William turned to Evelyn, eyes bright.

"Your brother and Amelia have decided to get engaged. We called everyone back to hear your thoughts."

Evelyn’s breath caught. "Really?"

Alexander nodded.

Amelia mirrored the gesture, a shy smile blooming. Radiant. Flawless.

"Congratulations!" Evelyn beamed. "What’s there to debate? Just marry already!"

She shot Alexander a teasing look.

What wonderful news.
###Chapter 986

The journey hadn't been easy for Alexander and Amelia to reach this point. Setting aside the complications with Isabella...

Alexander Sterling and Amelia Sinclair were the perfect match. They complemented each other in every possible way.

Evelyn was Alexander's sister, so her first concern was naturally her brother's happiness.

If Alexander was content, Evelyn would support their relationship wholeheartedly!

Alexander gave Amelia an exasperated look. Clearly, the engagement had been her idea.

William Sterling nodded in agreement with Evelyn's words. "Exactly. I think you should skip the engagement and go straight to marriage. It's been too long since we've had a wedding in this family. Make it as extravagant as you want - I'll cover all expenses!"

William thumped his chest proudly as he spoke.

Amelia lowered her head with a shy smile, her delicate eyebrows arching slightly.

"We're not in any rush for marriage. I have several major projects underway right now. Planning a wedding requires significant time and attention, which I simply can't spare at the moment. Perhaps we can revisit the marriage discussion once my workload lightens."

Amelia's gentle explanation carried both grace and practicality. Her demeanor was like a refreshing spring breeze.

No wonder Alexander gazed at her with such devotion - a look he'd never bestowed upon any other woman.

Perhaps this was simply fate.

William frowned, about to protest when Evelyn intervened, linking arms with her father. "Dad, don't listen to Amelia. The real issue is that Alexander is swamped with work right now. How am I supposed to manage Sterling Enterprises alone?"

She continued, "I'm overseeing multiple critical projects and relying heavily on Alexander's support. I don't want to delay his marriage, but I have no choice..." By positioning herself as the reason for postponing the wedding, Evelyn knew William would drop the subject.

Personally, Evelyn didn't find marriage particularly appealing, so she defended Amelia's position. Amelia shot her a grateful smile while Alexander cleared his throat and played along. "She's right. Little E needs to put in more overtime, though frankly her focus is lacking. Maybe we should just move her desk into the office..."

Evelyn gaped at her brother. 'Is this really my flesh and blood?!'

William clicked his tongue disapprovingly, his attitude shifting immediately.

He glared daggers at Alexander.

"Don't even joke about that! How could you say such a thing? Are you trying to work your sister to death? I never made you live at the office when you first took over! Forget rushing into marriage - an engagement is perfectly fine!" When it came to his precious daughter, William would abandon any position without hesitation. Alexander rubbed his nose sheepishly and gave Amelia a pitiful look.

Evelyn didn't miss that expression. 'Who would have thought the great Alexander Sterling would be whipped one day?' Amelia's parents had passed away, and her other relatives had turned their backs during difficult times, leading Amelia to sever ties completely.

In other words, the engagement between Amelia and Alexander rested entirely in the Sterling family's hands.

They settled on a date at the beginning of next month.

Lucas emerged from the kitchen with dessert just as the conversation concluded.

Hearing the news, he chimed in, "I'd prefer to get married right away..."

Alexander smoothly retorted, "You don't even have a girlfriend."

Amelia couldn't help but giggle.

Lucas shot his brother a glare before turning to Evelyn.

"If Little E would cooperate, I'd have children by now!"

William angrily hurled a nearby cushion at Lucas. "Watch your mouth!"

Evelyn laughed and raised an eyebrow. "I told you patience is key!"

"She's constantly surrounded by male models trying to seduce her. How can I possibly be patient?" Lucas countered.

Published by NovelDreams Publishing.

"I'm just helping you keep an eye on her..."

Evelyn murmured softly, her smile tinged with guilt.
###Chapter 987

Evelyn understood perfectly well that nothing romantic had developed between Natalie and Lucas. Natalie was still torn about whether to accept Julian's affections.

She advised Natalie to take time to reflect before making any decisions.

But she wouldn't dare mention this to Lucas.

Lucas smirked. "That's more like it. Amelia, if you have any favorite celebrities, I can invite them to our engagement party. Consider it my congratulatory gift."

As a powerful figure in the entertainment industry, Lucas held considerable influence. Amelia's eyes lit up with surprise as she blurted out without hesitation. "Really? Julian! I adore Julian Moreau!"

'That rising idol?' Evelyn glanced up instinctively, seeing Amelia's starstruck expression as she clasped her hands together.

"Young Julian is absolutely adorable. I'd love to meet him. Is that possible?"

Lucas flashed a roguish grin, appearing completely nonchalant. "Of course—"

The moment he looked up and caught Alexander's warning glare, he immediately backtracked.

"Of course—not!"

Amelia's sparkling eyes dimmed momentarily. "Is it difficult?"

With Lucas's status, inviting a popular young idol shouldn't be an issue, right?

Lucas gave an awkward chuckle.

"I heard Julian was taken under a famous director's wing for intensive training over the next two months. No time off allowed."

Amelia sighed, her gentle features clouded with disappointment. "What a shame. Could you pass along my support? Tell him to focus on his craft. I'll always cheer him on and wait for him to mature—"

Wait for him to mature?

Lucas and Evelyn exchanged glances. Why did that phrasing sound slightly... concerning? The room's temperature seemed to drop several degrees.

William clearly wanted no part of this conversation. He stood abruptly, rubbing his temples as if preparing to leave. "I've got a headache. I'll go rest upstairs for a while."

The topics these youngsters discussed were beyond him.

Alexander's smile turned dangerous.

"Wait for him to mature? Is he better than me?"

Amelia froze.

"It was just a figure of speech—"

Evelyn and Lucas simultaneously rose, preparing to escape the awkward atmosphere. Before they could retreat far, they heard Alexander begin meticulously slandering Julian with terrifying patience. "That boy climbed the ladder by sleeping with numerous powerful figures—men and women alike. His innocent persona is carefully crafted. Don't be fooled by appearances, understand?"

"Seriously...?"

Evelyn's steps faltered. She couldn't bring herself to look her eldest brother in the eye. His possessiveness had reached alarming levels.

The lies flowed effortlessly from his lips. Was it really appropriate to defame a young man like that?

Lucas muttered under his breath, "How did he know? I thought we kept that under wraps."

Evelyn stared at him in shock. "It's true?"

Lucas shrugged. "Weren't you involved in that scandal with him? You didn't know?"

He'd assumed she was aware.

In reality, Evelyn knew nothing.

She'd even instructed Dominic to allocate more resources to that seemingly kindhearted young man.

Seeing Evelyn's bewildered expression, Lucas smirked.

"That news circulated ages ago. Maybe it never reached you. Or perhaps... someone made sure it wouldn't."

After all, you're one of those 'powerful figures' he supposedly charmed."

Evelyn was speechless. Her worldview had just been shattered.

She needed an entire night to process this sudden revelation about the entertainment industry's dark underbelly.

From now on, she'd think twice before blindly trusting anyone's public image.

Early next morning.

Spring was fading, the weather gradually warming.

Evelyn headed straight to the office from Sterling Manor, buried in work all day.

During a rare moment of respite, she glanced at her silent phone, feeling strangely unsettled.

The realization struck her suddenly.

Preston hadn't contacted her all day.
###Chapter 988

Ever since they started dating, Preston had been texting Evelyn nonstop.

"Don't skip meals."
"Take breaks."
"Cut back on the coffee."

Sometimes, Evelyn replied when she saw the messages. Other times, when work consumed her, she left them unanswered.

Preston never got upset. His texts came like clockwork—every five minutes, without fail.

Eventually, she grew accustomed to them. But now, staring at her silent phone, Evelyn frowned.

She scrolled through their chat history. Every conversation began with him.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. Are you busy?

She deleted it. Better to call.

The line connected after a few rings.

"Pretty Lady! I missed you!" Oliver's sweet voice chirped through the speaker.

Evelyn smiled. "I missed you too, sweetheart. Where's your dad?"

Oliver hesitated, then mumbled, "Daddy got hurt. He has a fever now. He might die!"

Evelyn froze. "He was hurt?"

"Yeah," Oliver confirmed solemnly. "He got beaten up really bad. He almost stopped breathing!"

Her heart lurched. That’s why he hasn’t texted all day. Guilt twisted inside her. She should’ve checked on him sooner.

"Are you at home? I’m coming over right now."

"Okay, Pretty Lady! Hurry! If Daddy dies, can I live with you?" Oliver pondered this seriously. I’ll be sad if Daddy dies, but living with Pretty Lady sounds nice...

On the bed, Preston—supposedly weak—heard every word.

A vein pulsed at his temple. He forced himself to stay still.

Preston had always believed in modern parenting—treating Oliver like a friend.

Right now, he was reconsidering that philosophy. Maybe a good old-fashioned spanking wasn’t such a bad idea.

Evelyn’s breath hitched at the word die. Panic clawed at her chest.

She didn’t think—just grabbed her phone and bolted. Bennett saw her frantic state and stopped her. "You shouldn’t drive like this." He called her driver instead.

Her mind was blank the entire ride. At Preston’s penthouse, she keyed in the passcode and rushed inside.

In the bedroom, Oliver sat beside Preston, trying—and failing—to shove a pill into his mouth.

Evelyn hurried forward, her worry unconcealed.

Preston lay motionless, his face alarmingly pale. His lips were bloodless.

Worst of all—his right cheek was swollen, mottled with dark bruises. A punch mark. Dried blood lingered at the corner of his mouth.

The sight was jarring.

Preston was always composed, effortlessly elegant. Now, he looked fragile.

Her heart twisted. She gently stopped Oliver’s persistent pill-pushing. His lips were already abused enough.

Oliver blinked up at her in surprise.

Evelyn placed a finger to her lips. "Go wait outside, sweetheart. Let me take care of Daddy."

Oliver hesitated, then nodded and scampered off.
###Chapter 989

The room held only two souls now, yet Evelyn could scarcely detect Preston's breathing.

Her lips pressed together. An unexpected sting prickled behind her nose.

She reached out, fingertips brushing his forehead. The heat radiating from his skin confirmed the fever.

As she withdrew her hand, strong fingers suddenly encircled hers.

Evelyn startled.

His grip burned with the same intensity as his elevated temperature.

"Are you awake?" she whispered, leaning closer.

Her voice carried delicate caution, as if speaking too loudly might shatter him.

Preston's lips parted painfully. His voice emerged rough as gravel. "Why are you here?"

Evelyn's eyes grew moist, too embarrassed to admit she'd noticed his absence when he stopped contacting her.

"I called," she murmured. "Oliver answered. Said you were burning up."

A weak smile tugged at Preston's cracked lips as he attempted reassurance. "Don't worry. I'm sorry for troubling you... though I can't deny being glad you came."

"I'm calling the doctor." Evelyn moved to stand, but Preston didn't protest, merely watching her with exhausted eyes.

He turned slightly, eyelids fluttering shut as if the simple act required tremendous effort. Though she already suspected the answer, Evelyn demanded, "Who did this to you?"

Preston struggled to focus. His gaze softened with affection. "It's nothing. Just someone acting in anger—"

"Anger doesn't excuse violence!" Evelyn snapped. "You're not some punching bag! Tell me who!"

Conflict twisted Preston's features.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "How many enemies do you have here? Nathan or Isaiah? I'll confront them both—"

"Evelyn." Preston's hoarse plea stopped her. His illness-weakened grip tightened slightly around her wrist.

"Mr. Blackwood showed restraint. I'll recover."

Evelyn trembled with sudden fury. "What right did he have? The man's completely unhinged!" Had Nathan discarded all decency?

Preston's exhausted eyes sparkled faintly. "Your concern touches me, but I sought him out. He's never liked me—I expected consequences."

The lengthy speech triggered dry coughing. Evelyn immediately supported him, gently patting his back.

"Why would you go to him?"

"Because Isaiah would have," Preston rasped. "I couldn't risk him discovering us."

Evelyn frowned. "Why?"

Their relationship remained private by mutual agreement, but she saw no harm in others knowing.

Preston's pale face darkened momentarily. "Because his hatred for me would make you a tool. You don't know Isaiah—the depths he'll sink to. I couldn't take that chance."

Evelyn fell silent.

She trusted Preston's judgment, yet guilt coiled in her chest. Ultimately, he'd suffered because of her.

"Don't worry about me," she finally said. "No one dares cross me on my turf."

But Preston remained quiet, knowing Evelyn couldn't comprehend Isaiah's ruthlessness. Normal logic didn't apply to such twisted minds.

Evelyn checked her watch. "The doctor's almost here. Let me get ice for your face."

Preston nodded, watching her bustling concern with quiet satisfaction.

A deep, secret smile curved his lips.

Every bruise had been worth it.
###Chapter 990

Evelyn stepped onto the balcony, dialing Nathan's number while waiting for the ice pack.

Nathan sounded genuinely shocked when he answered. "Evelyn? I was just about to call you. Great minds think alike—"

"Nathan Blackwood, does punching people make you feel powerful? Why don't you try hitting yourself next time?" Evelyn hissed through clenched teeth. 'That bastard deserves worse than just a scolding.'

Silence stretched for several beats before Nathan responded icily. "He tattled on me?" His tone dripped with contempt.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "He didn't need to! The bruises speak for themselves!"

A derisive snort came through the line. It hadn't even been a proper fight. Preston couldn't take one punch?

"If you ever lay hands on anyone close to me again, I'll make you regret it," Evelyn threatened. 'Did he think he owned the monopoly on violence? The arrogant prick!' She slammed the phone down before Nathan could respond.

Harrison, standing beside Nathan, heard every word. Just as he'd suspected—Preston's entire visit had been a ploy to manipulate Evelyn's sympathy with his injuries. Nathan never stood a chance against such tactics.

The doorbell rang.

Evelyn checked the monitor—Sterling family doctors had arrived. She ushered them inside quickly. The familiar male and female physicians followed her to the bedroom while she retrieved the ice pack from the kitchen.

After wrapping the ice in a towel, the doctors emerged. "How is he?" Evelyn asked anxiously.

The male doctor adjusted his glasses. "We've administered fever reducers. They should take effect within the hour. As for the facial injuries..."

The female doctor hesitated before producing a tube. "This salve should help, but the bruising will need two to three days to fade completely."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Thank you." Accepting the medication, she saw them out before returning to the bedroom with the ice pack. Preston sat propped against the headboard, breathing slightly labored. When she offered the compress, he made no move to take it.

Instead, he fixed her with an intense stare, tilting his chin slightly—a silent demand for her to do it.

Too exhausted to argue with a patient, Evelyn complied. As she settled beside him, his subtle masculine scent—something woodsy with a citrus undertone—wrapped around her senses, momentarily disorienting her.

She pressed the cold compress gently against his swollen cheekbone, carefully massaging the inflamed area. Her brows knitted in concentration.

She didn't notice how his dark gaze remained fixed on her face until her wrist began aching, prompting her to switch hands.

Their eyes locked.

His fathomless dark irises swirled like a maelstrom, exerting an almost gravitational pull. Beneath that controlled surface lurked a tempest of restrained emotion—and at its eye, an unmistakable hunger for her.

Evelyn found herself paralyzed, trapped in that magnetic gaze.

Some invisible force dragged her deeper into those dangerous depths.

Every raw emotion in his eyes translated clearly across his features, spelling out one primal message: "I want to devour you."

As the charged silence stretched, he leaned closer—so near she could count his long lashes, feel his breath ghosting over her lips.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her muscles locked.

He gave her no time to process his intentions.

Cool, firm lips captured hers.

Electric shockwaves jolted down Evelyn's spine. The compress slipped from her suddenly numb fingers, forgotten.

Strong arms banded around her slender waist, eliminating any possibility of retreat. His embrace—so encompassing it nearly swallowed her whole—left no room for escape.

Nathan's breathing grew ragged, his body temperature spiking until Evelyn felt her own skin catch fire.
###Chapter 991

Preston's kisses started soft and tentative. Just as Evelyn caught her breath, her nerves finally settling—

He claimed her lips again, this time with a hunger that stole her thoughts.

The man was holding back so hard it physically pained him. The moment her sweetness touched his tongue, restraint shattered. He couldn't let go.

Evelyn didn’t push him away. Every fiber of his being burned to consume her, his skin alight with electric thrill.

Yet he didn’t take. Not like the beast clawing beneath his ribs demanded.

Instead, he traced the seam of her lips with agonizing precision, savoring each taste as if she were a rare delicacy. Only then did he deepen the kiss, swallowing her soft gasps like a man starved.

Evelyn’s knees buckled. If not for his iron grip around her waist, she’d have melted to the floor.

Just a kiss.

Her face burned hotter than Preston’s feverish skin.

Pathetic. She hadn’t been this affected in years. Clearly, her hormones had officially mutinied.

But how did this man—always so composed, so polite—kiss like a fallen angel who’d perfected temptation over centuries?

She couldn’t think. Only follow, drowning in him until her lungs screamed.

When he finally pulled back, his darkened gaze glittered with satisfaction.

"Breathe." His voice was rough velvet, scraping down her spine.

Evelyn jerked to awareness, gulping air. The way he watched her—flushed, disheveled—made her pulse stutter.

She scrambled up, but her legs betrayed her. Preston caught her effortlessly, a low chuckle vibrating against her.

"That eager to stay in my arms?"

Men. Always insufferable the second they gained an inch.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I’d have better balance if you weren’t distracting me."

His smirk faded. "Don’t move." The warning in his tone froze her.

Then she felt it.

Oh.

Oh no.

She’d accidentally brushed against—

Evelyn went rigid, cheeks flaming. If the floor opened up and swallowed her whole, it’d be a mercy.

Preston exhaled sharply, the red haze in his eyes clearing. When he released her, his smile was all polished charm again. "Can you stand?"

She bolted upright, putting three feet between them.

He adjusted his shirt sleeves, every inch the untouchable aristocrat. Then, with devastating sincerity:

"My apologies. The fever must have… compromised my judgment."

As if he hadn’t just unraveled her with his mouth.

Evelyn’s brain short-circuited. "It’s—it’s fine! Just a kiss. Like a mosquito bite!"

The words tumbled out before she could stop them.

Preston went very still.

Then he pressed two fingers to his temple, jaw tight. "Did mosquitos always make you moan, Evelyn?"

Her entire body combusted.

"You—!" She jabbed a finger at him, spluttering. "You degenerate!"

His laughter followed her as she fled.
###Chapter 992

Preston Sinclair suddenly smiled, his dark eyes twinkling with amusement. The warmth in his gaze deepened as he studied Evelyn's flustered expression.

This was so unlike the composed business magnate who regularly dominated headlines alongside A-list celebrities.

She was regal yet playful, sophisticated yet untainted by cynicism. The startled, wide-eyed look she gave him made his chest tighten—as if he'd stumbled upon something priceless.

His lips curved into a tender smile as he held her gaze.

"Evelyn, we're together now. This isn't being a rogue—it's called affection."

Lowering his voice, he murmured, "Did you enjoy it?"

The sudden shift to seriousness sent heat rushing to her cheeks. Preston Sinclair, you absolute—!

She refused to let him win. Squaring her shoulders, she forced her racing heart to steady.

But she couldn't bring herself to replay that kiss. Just the memory made her pulse stutter.

Pursing her lips, she feigned indifference. "It was... passable. Technique needs work, though I can tell you've practiced. Mr. Sinclair, exactly how many women have you kissed before me?"

The question slipped out before she could stop it. She believed him when he said he'd never been serious with anyone.

But that kiss? Far too skilled for an amateur.

Who did he think he was fooling?

Crossing her arms, she waited for his reaction. Preston merely smirked and raised a hand, utterly unbothered. "Only you. Self-taught. If you're unsatisfied, we can always... explore further. I aim to please."

Evelyn stiffened, words failing her. For the first time, she felt utterly outmatched.

Just then, Oliver Sinclair toddled in, shattering the charged silence.

He blinked up at Preston, then at Evelyn, then back at his father. With innocent sweetness, he chirped, "Daddy, congratulations! You're not dead yet!"

Preston's expression froze.

His jaw tightened as he stared at his son. "...Thanks."

Oliver, sensing the shift in mood, quickly hugged Preston's arm, swinging it playfully.

"Daddy, I tried so hard to take care of you! I gave you medicine, but you wouldn't take it!"

Evelyn nodded. The scene she'd walked in on earlier had been Oliver attempting to force-feed Preston an assortment of pills.

Preston's eyebrow twitched. "Those were laxatives, Oliver."

The boy, too young to read labels, had simply grabbed whatever bottles he could find. In his mind, one of them had to work for a fever.

Before he could succeed, Evelyn had arrived.

Her lips pressed together to suppress a laugh as she gently pulled Oliver away.

"You should rest," she told Preston. "Eat something when your fever breaks. We'll leave you be."

Preston exhaled, the drowsiness from his medication finally pulling at him. The energy he'd mustered to tease her was fading fast.

The moment his head hit the pillow, he was out.

Evelyn let out a quiet breath of relief as she stepped out with Oliver.

Thank goodness for the interruption. Another minute alone with Preston, and she might have combusted.

"Pretty Lady, why is your face so red?" Oliver peered up at her, curious.

"Did Daddy make you sick too?"

Evelyn touched her burning cheeks, inhaling deeply to steady herself.

"...Yes. Something like that."
###Chapter 993

Oliver Sinclair's small hands trembled when Evelyn mentioned she wasn't feeling well. His delicate face twisted with worry.

"I'll call the doctor right now—"

He scrambled for the phone, but Evelyn stopped him. She sighed, amused.

Preston had been seriously ill before, yet Oliver hadn't panicked like this. What kind of father was Preston, raising a son who worried more about her than his own dad?

She smiled. "No need. Some medicine will do. Are you hungry? How about some chicken soup?"

Something light would be best for a sick person. Oliver nodded, then shook his head.

"Cooking is too much work. I can go hungry. I won't let Pretty Lady suffer!"

Evelyn's heart melted. She grinned. "It's fine. It won't be hard. Just takes a little time."

She headed to the kitchen, letting the soup simmer as the sky darkened outside.

After dinner, Oliver dutifully retreated to his room to finish his homework.

Evelyn checked on Preston again, pressing a hand to his forehead. Good, the fever's gone. She exhaled in relief.

Her phone rang.

Bennett.

She answered. "What is it?"

"President, there's an urgent document from the European division. They need your signature immediately. If it's convenient—"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Send it to my email."

She hung up, left a note on the table, and went downstairs.

Luckily, they lived just floors apart. It wouldn't take long to return once she finished reviewing the files.

Her study computer was encrypted. She scanned the documents, flagged a few unclear clauses, and waited for Bennett's revisions. Time slipped by unnoticed.

By the time she finished, exhaustion weighed her eyelids down. She checked her phone—no messages, no calls.

Preston was probably still asleep. She wouldn't disturb him.

She washed up and collapsed into bed.

Morning light flooded the room when she woke. She'd forgotten to close the curtains or set them to sleep mode.

No point going back to sleep now.

She stretched, slipped on her slippers, and headed to the bathroom.

Saturday, but work waited. No rest for her.

The moment she stepped out, Preston stood there, holding Oliver's hand. He looked like himself again—warm, composed, fully recovered.

"Good morning," they chorused.

Evelyn smiled. "I slept too late last night. Didn't come back up—"

Preston nodded in understanding.

"I know. The soup was delicious. I finished it all. Here's breakfast—take it to the office."

He handed her a container.

He made breakfast? After being sick all night?

Warmth spread through her chest, followed by a flutter of embarrassment.

She glanced at Oliver's grinning face and felt guilty. "Come in and wait."

Oliver shook his head solemnly. "Daddy says we can't. It's not polite to barge into a lady's home. Might scare you."

Such good manners.

Evelyn ruffled his hair. "I won't get scared."

Preston smoothly changed the subject.

"I'd love to see you off, but my face isn't presentable yet. Drive safe."

One look at him, and last night's kiss flashed in her mind. She turned away quickly.

A hurried nod, and she left.
###Chapter 994

Oliver Sinclair and Preston Sinclair watched Evelyn's retreating figure, their expressions unreadable.

Preston's lips curved into a knowing smile.

Oliver tilted his head. "Why is Aunt Evelyn's face so red? Is she still sick?"

Preston ruffled his hair.

"The bodyguard is waiting downstairs to take you to the library. Go on."

If Oliver hadn't begged to see Evelyn before leaving, Preston wouldn't have indulged him this long.

Oliver sighed dramatically. If only Dad got sick every day, I could stay home and take care of him. I'm definitely the most devoted son in the world.

Days passed in a blur.

Isabella Montgomery's mood swung between highs and lows. She insisted on dragging Evelyn to a luxury spa day.

Natalie Beaumont was too busy, and Sebastian Hart only ever argued with Isabella whenever they met.

That left Evelyn as her only option.

They booked VIP treatments in advance, with a dedicated attendant guiding them through their appointments.

Two hours later, they lounged in massage chairs, letting the machines work out the tension in their muscles.

Between sighs of relief, Evelyn told Isabella about Alexander Sterling and Amelia Sinclair's engagement.

Isabella stayed silent for barely three seconds before letting out a dry laugh. "So fairy tales do come true. I guess love isn't dead after all."

Evelyn could tell the news didn’t sting as much anymore. Isabella had made her peace with it.

After his divorce, Donovan Pierce had hounded Isabella relentlessly. When news of her engagement broke, he stormed the Montgomery estate like a madman.

Unfortunately for him, Isabella’s mother happened to be home. The bodyguards threw him out on the spot.

Rumor had it he’d limped away with a broken leg.

Isabella shrugged it off. "Not my problem. He deserved it." After that, Donovan vanished from her life completely.

The world saw Isabella and Lawrence Wellington as the perfect couple—finally tying the knot after years of love.

In reality? They barely spoke outside of public appearances. Even their meetings were scheduled by assistants.

Silence settled between them again.

Then—laughter. Familiar voices drifted in from the entrance.

Evelyn’s name caught their attention.

"Pathetic. Evelyn acts all sweet and fragile, but she’s the most vindictive person I’ve ever met. She’s the reason I got pushed out of Pacific Crest International."

Cassandra Blake’s voice.

Isabella shot Evelyn a look.

Evelyn arched a brow. She’d heard it too.

With masks covering half their faces and identical spa robes, the trio across from them didn’t recognize their subject was right there.

They settled into massage chairs, oblivious.

The girl beside Cassandra looked vaguely familiar—someone from the fringes of high society, never important enough to remember.

The other woman? Madison Cole. A former sycophant of Sophia Blackwood.

Evelyn remembered her well.

Once Sophia fell from grace, Madison faded into obscurity. Too many burned bridges.

Seeing these three together now was… amusing.

Evelyn had no intention of leaving.

Why would she?

If they were spinning stories about her, she might as well stay for the show.
###Chapter 995

Ava turned to her new companions with animated enthusiasm.

"Trust me on this. Don't let Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood's divorce fool you. Her grip on men is suffocating. She's clearly involved with Preston Sinclair, yet she still clings to Nathan."

She sighed dramatically. "I'm living proof of her pettiness!"

Madison Cole's eyes widened. "Wait—you left Pacific Crest International because she was jealous of your proximity to Nathan?"

"Exactly. Before his true position at the company was revealed, I was on track to become the Asia-Pacific president. But the moment his identity came to light, my impeccable credentials suddenly became a target. She forced me out."

Ava shook her head, feigning regret.

The other woman scoffed. "I've heard how ruthless Evelyn Sinclair is. No one dares cross her—women in our circles are warned to steer clear. Ms. Blake, since you've only recently returned to your father's side, you might not know. If you ever see her, walk the other way."

Ava's lips curled in defiance.

"I'm not some helpless lamb anymore. My father's backing me now. Why should I bow to her whims?"

Madison quickly chimed in, eager to flatter.

"Exactly! You're just as much a heiress as Evelyn. And with your experience at Pacific Crest, you're more than capable. Once you take over your father's company, you'll outshine her easily!"

From the side, Isabella Montgomery stifled a laugh. Madison glanced over but saw only two masked women enjoying their spa treatments. Her attention snapped back to Ava.

"Besides, you and Nathan are far better suited. Men get blinded by Evelyn's looks, but when it comes to pedigree and capability? No one compares to you."

Ava preened under the praise. She had only meant to tarnish Evelyn's reputation, but these women were eating it up.

She sighed theatrically. "If only more people saw her for what she really is. But alas, most are still under her spell."

Isabella snorted again.

Evelyn Sinclair rolled her eyes. Isabella just had to draw attention.

Madison's suspicion flared. She had caught the sound one too many times. Her sharp instincts wouldn't let it slide.

She strode over, arms crossed, glaring down at Isabella.

"Excuse me, miss. Care to explain why you're eavesdropping and laughing at our conversation? Got a problem with what we're saying?"

Ava and her companion turned, curious.

Isabella lifted her head, her smirk evident even behind the mask.

"Who said I was laughing at you?"

Madison stiffened. That voice…

Before she could place it, Evelyn removed her mask, her smile icy.

"If you're going to gossip, pick a better venue. Public places have a way of backfiring."

Madison paled, her breath hitching.

Oh no.
###Chapter 996

Evelyn's lips curved into an amused smirk. "Do I really frighten you that much? Look how you're trembling."

Cassandra and Madison both froze in shock.

Madison scrambled to her feet immediately, bowing deeply to Evelyn. "Good afternoon, Ms. Sinclair!"

Yvette burst into laughter, thoroughly entertained.

With a contemptuous glance at Madison, she ripped off the woman's carefully constructed facade of innocence.

Madison swallowed hard, panic flashing across her face. "Ms. Sinclair, I-I didn't mean any of those things—"

Cassandra shot her a venomous glare. Madison had been so eager to curry favor moments ago.

Now she was the first to abandon ship.

Evelyn couldn't care less about either woman.

Her icy gaze settled on Cassandra. "Even if you want to spread rumors about me, these bottom-feeders are useless contacts." Her voice dripped with aristocratic disdain. "They can't even scrape the edges of high society. Just desperate social climbers waiting to be picked up by anyone with money. Why else would they bother with you?"

Both women flushed crimson, unable to meet Evelyn's piercing stare.

The truth stung.

Without fools like Sophia Blackwood willing to drag them to parties, they'd never set foot in elite circles.

Yet they lacked the beauty or talent to attract men like Nathan. Faced with actual aristocrats, their carefully rehearsed flattery fell flat.

The truly wealthy preferred disposable celebrities they could buy and discard.

Women like Madison came with messy family entanglements - too much trouble.

Evelyn's circle remained impenetrable, viewing these social parasites with well-deserved contempt. Stuck in limbo, they clung to easy targets like Cassandra.

Cassandra's face paled.

Her confidence wavered as Evelyn exposed her pathetic strategy.

But she wasn't the same frightened girl anymore. With her powerful family backing her now, she stood equal to Evelyn. Her father would give her anything to make up for lost time. Why should she fear Evelyn?

Unthinkable!

Chin lifting arrogantly, Cassandra met Evelyn's gaze head-on. "Don't flatter yourself, Evelyn. You're not invincible. Now that I've left Pacific Crest International, what hold do you have over me? My status equals yours now. Harm me, and my family will make you pay!"

This bold defiance sent a thrill through Cassandra.

Evelyn's lips curved in silent mockery.

Beside her, Isabella snorted derisively. "Your status? Equal to Evelyn's? What fantasy world are you living in?" She gestured contemptuously at the social climbers flanking Cassandra. "Someone should tell her the truth - her family's practically bankrupt. Even if your father lives another thirty years, he'll never amass half of Evelyn's wealth. You're not even in the same league!"

Isabella turned her scathing assessment to the two hangers-on.

"And you two - remind your new pet that adopted strays still have to know their place."

Cassandra's face twisted in outrage. "How dare you speak to me like that!"
###Chapter 997

Evelyn laughed.

"Offensive? I can be much more offensive than that. Do you really think your family would sacrifice everything for you? Wake up. Your family's assets were legally notarized by their lawyers before you even returned. You own nothing. If you were truly as brilliant as you claim, why hasn't a single member of your family offered you a position in the company?"

Cassandra's entire body trembled violently. Her once-alluring face twisted into something ugly—doubt creeping in.

Slowly, the realization settled in.

She had bragged about her impressive résumé countless times, only for her father to swiftly change the subject.

Her siblings never discussed business matters with her.

They all just kept telling her to "enjoy life" with saccharine smiles.

Cassandra had truly believed she was the family's treasured princess. But now...

Evelyn smirked, satisfied by the shift in Cassandra's expression.

Why pity a delusional woman who refused to see reality?

Isabella scoffed, impatient.

"What's the point of talking? Ms. Blake, since you clearly need a reality check, I’ll give you a gift—consider it punishment for spreading lies about me behind my back." Evelyn was direct.

She had no patience for repeated nonsense. If Cassandra had just stayed quiet, Evelyn might have let it slide. But since she insisted on stirring trouble, she deserved to suffer the consequences.

Evelyn’s lips curved into a cold smile as she turned away, her gaze sharp and unreadable.

Her social media was probably exploding right now. She wondered if Cassandra could handle the fallout.

Evelyn and Isabella headed to the dressing room to change.

Isabella couldn’t resist asking, "What exactly did you do?"

Evelyn smirked. "Check your phone."

Isabella pulled out her device.

A video posted by Evelyn was already trending. The footage was crystal clear—Cassandra’s voice rang out, venomous and smug.

"Evelyn brought you here, which means she still trusts you. Mr. Blake, you need to step up your game. During your contract, leak scandals to the press. Get caught in compromising photos—or better yet, trash Sterling Enterprises in private chats. Ruin their reputation. That’ll destroy them!"

A pause. Then Harrison’s voice, disgusted.

"Sterling Enterprises won’t be destroyed. If anything, I’ll be the one ruined. Do you think I’m an idiot?"

Cassandra scoffed. "Of course, I’ll compensate you. I’m the one who got you this contract anyway. Once it’s done, I’ll pay you enough to retire comfortably. Face it—your career in this industry is over."

Isabella’s expression darkened as she finished watching.

"What the hell is wrong with her?"

A verbal lashing was too light. She should’ve punched Cassandra while she had the chance.

Evelyn’s smile was icy. "Let’s see if her family still protects her after this."

Isabella snorted. "Please. That family only cares about profit. Did she really think her father loved her?"

Delusional.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then let her pray for a miracle."

This video was originally meant to clear Harrison’s name later.

But releasing it now worked just as well—especially when someone kept trying to sabotage her.

Within minutes, the video went viral.

Evelyn’s followers reposted it en masse.

Anyone with half a brain knew exactly what was happening—Evelyn was publicly exposing Cassandra Blake.
###Chapter 998

The news spread like wildfire—Harrison Blake had become the new spokesperson for Sterling Enterprises' latest product.

It was all Cassandra Blake's doing. Evelyn Sinclair was simply retaliating in broad daylight.

But Harrison didn't fit the image of a man with a domestic violence scandal.

Why did he seem… decent?

The fact that he hadn’t gone down with Cassandra proved he still had some sense left.

Unlike her.

Hopeless.

Who followed Evelyn on social media?

CEOs. Industry leaders. Elite women from high society.

Now everyone knew exactly what kind of fool Cassandra was—a woman who had just clawed her way back into her biological family’s good graces.

Who would dare associate with her now?

Evelyn and Isabella Montgomery stepped out of the salon—only to run straight into Cassandra, who looked seconds away from losing her mind.

"Evelyn Sinclair, have you lost it?!" Cassandra's voice shook. "That video—how dare you film me without permission? You’re ruining my family’s reputation—"

She was sputtering.

She hated Evelyn’s effortless superiority. Even though Evelyn wasn’t in the entertainment industry, her influence eclipsed any A-list actress.

Every time Evelyn clashed with someone online, the public always sided with her.

As if she had them under a spell.

Evelyn smirked. "Wrong. I don’t care about your family’s reputation. Our families haven’t worked together in years. Whatever relationship we had is long gone."

She tilted her head. "Besides, the 'victim' in that video is the Sterling family. I’m sure your father will understand."

Cassandra’s phone wouldn’t stop ringing.

Every call was from someone in her family, demanding to know why she’d provoked the Sterlings.

The warmth in their voices had vanished.

Panic clawed at her throat.

She stared at Evelyn—calm, composed—and felt ice crawl up her spine.

Evelyn smiled, satisfied, and strode past her in stiletto heels.

"Evelyn—!" Cassandra shouted.

She couldn’t lose everything she’d just gained.

"If I apologize," she forced out through gritted teeth, "will you delete the video?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Don’t worry about it. Your father will come to me personally."

Cassandra’s apology was worthless.

At Evelyn’s level, even her father needed an appointment to see her.

In other words—Cassandra was nothing.

Evelyn left without another glance.

Isabella went her own way.

Online, the backlash against Cassandra was brutal.

No mercy.

Evelyn headed straight to Sterling Manor.

She knew Cassandra’s father would be waiting.

William Sterling was still fishing, blissfully unaware of the chaos online.

But Lucas Sterling was furious.

The moment Evelyn walked in, he stormed over.

"I couldn’t figure out why the company was stupid enough to hire that disaster, Harrison Blake," he snapped. "We spent a fortune cleaning up his image!"

His jaw clenched. "Why didn’t you tell us Cassandra was setting you up?"

Evelyn met his glare with a calm smile.

"Timing. I wanted to see what else she had up her sleeve."

She shrugged. "She just got back into her family’s good graces. I thought I’d let her enjoy it for a day or two."

Lucas stared at her, exasperated.

Still too soft-hearted.
###Chapter 999

Lucas would have eliminated this woman long ago if it were up to him.

She wouldn’t still be circling their world like a vulture.

Cassandra Blake wouldn’t have lasted this long under Lucas’ watch. But now, it was too late.

"Harrison didn’t follow her lead, but he was still dragged into this mess by someone else."

Lucas scowled, disgusted by the entire situation.

Evelyn took a sip of the warm milk the butler handed her.

"The official spokesperson shouldn’t be replaced. Harrison’s aesthetic aligns perfectly with our product. There’s a depth to him—something refined. Our new men’s watch is a luxury piece. A young idol wouldn’t carry the same weight."

Just then, the butler cleared his throat.

"Ms. Sinclair, there’s a visitor for Chairman Sterling. An old friend from years ago. Should I inform him?"

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Lucas.

They both knew exactly who had arrived—Charles Dudley, Cassandra’s father.

Lucas scoffed. "He actually has the nerve to show up?"

Evelyn pulled up a video on her phone and handed it to the butler.

"Let my father watch this before deciding whether to see Mr. Dudley."

The butler nodded and disappeared into the backyard where William was fishing. Moments later, he returned, holding a shattered phone.

"Chairman Sterling was… quite upset."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "It’s fine."

Clearly, William’s temper hadn’t cooled.

Thankfully, she had a spare phone upstairs. The next second, William stormed in, cursing under his breath.

"Charles still dares to step foot here? I pitied him for losing his child, but turns out she’s just as rotten. Scheming against us?"

Evelyn couldn’t help but chuckle.

"Dad, Uncle Charles probably has no idea what Cassandra did. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be rushing over like this."

Lucas sneered. "He’s not here for her. He’s here for his son’s company—afraid we’ll retaliate."

Truth.

Evelyn arched a brow. "The Sterlings and Dudleys were never close, but we weren’t enemies either. Just… indifferent."

She knew better, though.

The Dudley heir had spent years desperately trying to tie their sinking company to the Sterlings. Mediocre at best, he’d barely kept the business afloat.

Without serious financial backing, they’d be wiped from the market soon. Sterling Enterprises had never bothered with them—outdated equipment, lax management, zero competitive edge.

Acquiring them would be more trouble than it was worth.

On paper, they were worth billions. In reality? Drowning in debt.

Bankruptcy was inevitable.

Only a fool like Cassandra would think she’d landed in the same golden nest as Evelyn.

Evelyn turned to the butler.

"Tell our guest that Ms. Blake’s actions don’t reflect her family. We don’t punish the innocent."

The butler glanced at William, who gave no objection, then left.

Lucas crossed his arms. "You’re being too lenient."

Evelyn sighed. "Uncle Charles and Dad were once close. They grew apart because of ideology—Dad favored progress, Uncle Charles clung to tradition. Neither was wrong. We won’t make things difficult for him just because our families drifted."
###Chapter 1000

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at William Sterling.

William's brow furrowed momentarily before relaxing with a resigned sigh.

"Oliver's right. I'm furious with him, but he didn't raise that woman. It must have taken tremendous humility for him to come here today." His jaw tightened. "But that doesn't change anything. That scheming woman dared to cross us. This isn't over!"

William fixed his daughter with a pointed look.

His friendship with Charles Dudley went way back, but no such bond existed with that manipulative woman.

Evelyn nodded sharply. She had no intention of letting Cassandra Blake off the hook either.

If Cassandra wanted a war, she'd get one. Moments later, the butler returned.

"The guest has departed. He seemed somewhat improved from when he arrived, though still rather shaken. He inquired about Ms. Sterling's preferences."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Charles Dudley's instincts were surprisingly sharp.

If Evelyn remained firm, the Sterling family would undoubtedly follow her lead.

William snorted derisively as he stood. "What's an old man like him doing worrying about such things now?" It had been a last-minute decision for Evelyn not to meet him face-to-face.

With William present, seeing his old friend in distress would have been uncomfortable.

But clearing the air now prevented future awkwardness. Evelyn headed upstairs to switch phones, transferring all data from her damaged device to the spare.

She spent the entire day at Sterling Manor. Leo, bored out of its mechanical mind, attempted a system upgrade that resulted in catastrophic failure. When Evelyn discovered the AI tiger, it hung lifeless from the indoor swing like a stuffed toy, still wearing Claire Laurent's custom-knit sweater.

A remote consultation with Emily Whitaker revived Leo. "How did it crash?" Evelyn asked.

Emily chuckled. "It overestimated its processing power and tried to rewrite its own code."

Leo rebooted with an indignant flick of its tail, nuzzling Evelyn's hand dramatically. "My beautiful creator!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Silly cat."

"I'm highly intelligent!" Leo wailed before scampering off to join William for some fishing. After dinner, Evelyn grabbed her keys. Preston Sinclair had been messaging nonstop.

His texts danced around the real question: "Have you eaten? I prepared a healthy meal if you'd like to join me." "Storm's coming tomorrow - will commuting from the manor be difficult?" "Saw your social media post - I've got some professional feedback if you're interested."

Another message arrived as she reached the door:

[Fever's gone. Promise I'll behave this time.]

Preston assumed Evelyn's absence stemmed from their morning kiss.

He was overcomplicating things.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, momentarily tempted to turn back. The man knew exactly which buttons to press.

Preston Sinclair remained utterly inexplicable.

En route, she spotted her favorite patisserie still open and impulsively stopped for a slice of passionfruit cake.
