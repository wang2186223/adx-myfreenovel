###Chapter 1 Here's The Divorce Agreement
Inside the CEO's office of the Todd Group, Jonny Todd slid a set of papers across the desk toward Eleanor Todd. "Here's the divorce agreement. Go through it, and if everything looks fine, sign your name."



Eleanor's eyes lingered on the papers, shadowed with emotions she kept hidden. "Do we truly have to end our marriage?"


At her words, Jonny arched his brows, amusement flickering in his tone. "What else were you hoping for? Our marriage only existed to make my grandmother happy."


While speaking, he reached for the hand of the woman at his side, his voice softening. "And now that Lainey has returned, I need to restore her place and give her the respect she deserves."  Eleanor slowly raised her head, her gaze falling on the woman who had always lived in her husband's heart-Lainey Gilbert. Lainey was Jonny's childhood friend and ex-girlfriend. Three years earlier, the Todd family and the Gilbert family had planned an engagement for Jonny and Lainey.
But before the engagement ceremony could happen,Jonny was in a car crash that left his legs broken,with doctors warning he might never walk again.
Once the news reached the Gilberts, they abruptly canceled the arrangement and sent Lainey overseas.Yet even with their callous rejection, Jonny never erased Lainey from his heart.

With her sudden return, he was impatient to dissolve his marriage with Eleanor and welcome Lainey as his wife.
Lainey stood in a light white dress, dimples flashing as she smiled, looking every bit like a fragile bloom in full beauty. She carried a beauty that was hard to deny.
It made perfect sense that Jonny had clung to her image all these years.
When Eleanor said nothing, Lainey faced her with apparent sincerity. "Mrs. Todd, Jonny and I share real love. I hope you'll give us your blessing."
Yet how could love be genuine when she had abandoned him the moment he was crippled, only to return once he recovered?
A dry laugh slipped from Eleanor as her eyes shifted toward Jonny. "A divorce is fine. But after what I've done for your family all those three years, I won't leave empty-handed.I expect fair compensation."
Because Sallie Todd had once helped her in the orphanage, Eleanor had agreed without hesitation when the old woman asked her to marry her grandson, Jonny.
Since then, she had poured herself into the role of a loyal wife.
She had even grown a faint affection for him while watching his efforts to stand on his own again.
But despite her devotion, three years had done nothing to soften his heart.
Letting go now was the only path left.
Still, her part in pushing the Todd Group to its successful listing was no small matter.
She would not allow her hard work to vanish without acknowledgment.
Jonny laughed under his breath as he lit a cigarette,his features sharpening in the haze of smoke. "Don't worry. Sign the papers, and you'll have $70 million along with a riverside villa."
Although Eleanor meant little to him, he couldn't ignore the fact that she had stayed by his side while his legs were useless. That was enough to settle the debt between them. "I'll give you two days to think. If you want anything more..." he began.
"There's no need." Eleanor lifted the pen with steady grace and signed her name. "By tomorrow morning,I'll move out and leave the place open for you and Miss Gilbert."
Jonny felt a spark of satisfaction at her decisiveness.Even he could not deny that Eleanor had been the model wife. She was beautiful, compliant, and skilled at keeping the household in order.
Yet to him, her nature was unbearably bland. She lived like a machine, going through tasks without spirit or surprise. Dull, unchanging, and without spark. She could never stir his desire.
What he longed for was a partner who understood him, someone who could stand at his side through every storm. In his mind, only Lainey fit that role.
Jonny gathered up the contract and had it delivered to the court, ready to offer Eleanor a few courteous  words, but Lainey leaned close and gave his sleeve a small tug.
"Jonny, I was thinking... I really like that villa too,"Lainey said.
###Chapter 2 Are You Out Of Your Mind
"Hmm?" Jonny lifted his brows with mild surprise,studying Lainey curiously.
Hardly ever did Lainey ask anything of him. She had always carried herself as though she were above the material concerns, distant and untouchable.
Catching his reaction, Lainey raised her eyes with a faint, shy look. "Didn't you once tell me that the villa had the perfect surroundings and could serve as our future home after marriage?"
Memories of their past sweetness softened him,and without much thought, Jonny nodded.that's what you want, then consider it yours."
Eleanor observed their sickening harmony,her lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Jonny, only moments ago you promised me that house. Now you hand it over to her. Doesn't that strike you as shameless?"  Her words caught him off guard.
During their three years together, she had always been quiet and yielding, never daring to speak to him in such a tone.
His forehead creased, his voice edged with irritation."It's only one villa. I own plenty of properties. Pick whichever you want, and I'll transfer it to you."
Lainey, sensing his displeasure, quickly added, "Mrs.Todd, if you'll let me take the villa, I'll add another $10 million to your compensation."
Eleanor's gaze swept over her with contempt. "Miss Gilbert, are you joking? That villa alone is worth at least $60 million on the market. Do you really think $10 million can buy it from me?"
The color drained from Lainey's face, and she turned toward Jonny with wounded eyes. "Jonny, that's not what I meant."
Unmoved by her performance, Eleanor interjected sharply, "If you want that villa so badly, I won't refuse outright. But the price is this-Jonny must exchange it for ten percent of the Todd Group's shares."
"What?!" Lainey's voice rose in disbelief. "Mrs. Todd,are you insane?"
The Todd Group was publicly listed, and ten percent of its stock was worth over one hundred million.
Eleanor's demand was outrageous, and everyone in the room knew it.
Jonny's face turned grim at once. "Eleanor, don't test my patience."
Unfazed,Eleanor met his glare. "Either give me the shares or the villa, Jonny. The decision is yours."
The air thickened with sudden tension.
Sensing the hostility mounting,Lainey tightened her hold on Jonny's arm and begged softly, "Jonny forget it. I don't need that villa anymore. Wherever we live, as long as I'm beside you, I'll be content."
Those words calmed Jonny, and the severity in his face eased somewhat.
He turned back to Eleanor with a cold look. "The villa is yours then."
Knowing she had secured her rightful claim, Eleanor lost interest in further argument and started to walk away.
But Lainey's voice rang out behind her. "Mrs. Todd!"When Eleanor turned, she found Lainey smiling sweetly. "Thank you for looking after Jonny during these years. From now on, I'll make sure to learn how to be his wife properly," Lainey said.
Though the tone sounded gentle, every syllable carried a challenge.
Eleanor regarded her quietly, then burst out with sudden laughter.
Striding back to the desk, she grabbed Jonny's untouched cup of coffee and flung it straight over both of them. "Ah!" Lainey screamed as the hot liquid splattered across her white dress, staining it badly and leaving her disheveled.
Jonny's tailored suit was soaked as well, and fury twisted his face. "Eleanor! Are you out of your mind?"
She set the empty cup back onto the table with deliberate calm, her smile sharp. "My mistake. I just caught sight of something repulsive and couldn't hold back."
Without sparing them another glance, she walked out with steady steps, leaving the two of them in their disgrace.
###Chapter 3 Isn't That Eleanor Over There!
The moment Eleanor walked out of the Todd Group headquarters, her phone buzzed with a message from her closest friend, Lillian Brooks.


"It's my birthday today. I know you probably can't come,but I just wanted to remind you. Honestly, I don't know what kind of spell that jerk Jonny has on you. You've cut yourself off from everyone for his sake."


With little thought, Eleanor sent back a reply. "Give me the address."


For a beat there was silence, and then her screen lit up with a text.


"What the hell? What's happening?"


Eleanor's fingers moved with calm precision. "I've signed the divorce agreement." "Oh my God, you finally broke free of that lovesick title. Stay put. I'm coming to you right away!" A sleek maroon convertible sped on the highway.
Behind the wheel, Lillian tipped her sunglasses down and gave Eleanor a playful whistle. "Eleanor, since you're finally out of that nightmare, we're celebrating at Velvet Club tonight. We're going to have fun."
Eleanor leaned lazily against the seat, her voice quiet."Alright."
Lillian's curiosity got the better of her. "So what pushed you to finally cut ties? Let me guess-Lainey's back, isn't she?"
A faint smile touched Eleanor's lips."Congratulations. You guessed it."
Lillian slid her sunglasses off and remarked with a smirk, "Back then, Lainey ran off the moment he ended up in a wheelchair, and now that she's returned, he's chasing after her like some lovesick fool. Do you think Jonny damaged more than his legs in that car crash?"


"Hard to say."


"And you, wasting three whole years tied to that useless man," Lillian continued. "Good thing there weren't any kids, or the divorce would've been a nightmare."


A quiet laugh escaped Eleanor. "There was never a chance of that. He and I never even shared a bed."


"What?!" Lillian almost lost hold of the steering wheel. "You're telling me you were married for three years and never slept together?!"


Eleanor's beauty was undeniable. If that was true,then was Jonny incapable?


"He was keeping himself pure for Lainey." Just mentioning the two of them made Eleanor's stomach twist."Enough about him. Can you drop me off so l can change first?"


"Of course!" <###Chapter 3 Isn't That Eleanor Over There!         +120 Points at most
By eight that evening, the Velvet Club was in full swing. It was Elepdon's largest entertainment venue,a gathering place for the city's wealthy and powerful,where extravagance ruled and a single bottle of wine could cost hundreds of thousands.
Lillian's eyes sparkled as she glanced at Eleanor."Now this is the Eleanor I remember!"
That night, Eleanor's figure was wrapped in a sleek red dress that traced every curve. With loose waves tumbling over her shoulders and crimson lips to match, she was a vision that drew every eye.
Once Eleanor was seated, Lillian gave her shoulder a quick squeeze. "Stay here. I'll track down some top-shelf wine."

"Alright."
Eleanor's allure was undeniable; even as she sat still beneath the lights, her presence drew the eyes of countless men in an instant.
Out of nowhere, a man with blond hair swaggered up, flashing her a greasy smile. "Hey, beautiful.Sitting alone must be boring. How about sharing a drink with me?"


Across the club, Jonny stepped inside accompanied by his younger sister, Emma Todd.


From a nearby booth, Lainey lifted her hand in greeting, her smile poised. "Jonny, Emma, over here."


Emma hurried over, her face glowing with excitement. "Lainey, I'm so happy you're back. I've missed you so much!"


"I've missed you too." The reply was warm, but Lainey's eyes never strayed from Jonny.


She was just about to draw him in with another gesture when Emma's voice rang out in surprise."Jonny, isn't that Eleanor over there?!"


Jonny's head turned toward the direction Emma pointed.


Under the shifting lights, a striking figure rested on a barstool, her long legs revealed beneath the hem of her skirt, elegant and mesmerizing.
###Chapter 4 Leave Me Alone
Had he not recognized that familiar face, Jonny never would have guessed the woman before him was the plain wife he had grown so tired of.
Eleanor seemed caught in the unwanted attention of a man,her cold expression giving her feelings away.
"Look at her, pretending to be a saint at home,and now she's acting wild the moment you split up. What a shameless slut!" Emma, who had always despised her,sneered.
In the past, she had said worse in front of Jonny without consequence. This time, though,heat surged through him like fire.
"Enough! Watch your mouth!" he snapped at his sister.
Emma's lips twisted in a pout at the unexpected rebuke. <###Chapter 4 Leave Me Alone                +120 Points af most Lainey laid a gentle hand on Emma's back, her eyes sly as she fanned the flames. "Jonny, don't you find it suspicious? She's changed already... mnaybe she's already warming up to someone new?"
Jonny's stare grew heavier, his silence darker than words.
"Why so cold, gorgeous? Maybe a kiss will warm you up," the blond man teased, circling Eleanor like a predator who smelled blood.
Eleanor's brow creased with disgust. "Leave me alone."
"Oh, I like my women with fight in them. The feistier,the better. Come on, let me show you a good time."His hand lunged brazenly toward her chest.
A cold laugh slipped from Eleanor's lips as she snatched up an expensive bottle of red wine and smashed it hard against his head.
The bottle shattered on impact, drenching the blond man's face in wine. "Are you fucking kidding me!" he yelled, smearing the liquid off his skin. "You crazy bitch! Do you have any idea who I am? I'm from the Murphy family.Tonight you'll be begging beneath me, I swear!"


The entire club froze, eyes snapping toward the chaos, eager to see how it would end.


Up on the third floor, behind a wide glass window,Ryland Brooks leaned back with narrowed eyes,amusement flickering across his face."Look at that-Brice Murphy really loves hearing himself talk,throwing around his family name like it means something."


Within Elepdon's upper circles, Brice was a nobody compared to the man seated across from Ryland-Nolan Stewart, heir to the Stewart family and head of Stewart Group.


"Nolan, you've been staring at that woman for a long time. Don't tell me she caught your interest?" Ryland continued.


Lazily swirling the wine in his glass, Nolan let his gaze linger on the woman draped in bright red."Yeah, she's really... interesting." Ryland's brow arched in surprise. "That's unexpected. No woman has ever managed to draw your attention before."
He recalled faintly that the woman might even be a friend of his sister's.
Meanwhile, Brice, the blond man downstairs, had lost all composure, his rage threatening to ignite the room.
Jonny's face darkened as he sat brooding, then he suddenly rose to his feet.
Lainey's eyes widened in shock. "Wait, Jonny, are you actually going to step in for Eleanor?"
"Have you lost your mind, Jonny? That woman brought this on herself by flirting with Brice.Why would you stick your neck out?" Emma said.
"She was my wife for three years. I won't stand here and pretend I don't know her," Jonny retorted, seizing a convenient justification for his actions.


"But-" Emma started, but she faltered as two imposing figures descended the staircase.


All eyes immediately shifted toward them, and the noise in the club died in an instant when people realized it was Nolan and Ryland.


Brice caught sight of them, and all arrogance drained from his face. He scrambled forward, practically bowing. "Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, I had no idea you'd be here tonight!"


His tone fawned as he continued, plastering on a fake smile, "Allow me to cover the bill this evening.Please, enjoy yourselves."


Nolan dismissed him without so much as a glance,his gaze cutting past the crowd to settle firmly on Eleanor.
###Chapter 5 It's Ex-wife,Actually





Ryland's smile carried softness, yet his gaze stayed as cold as ice. "Funny, Brice. You didn't look so meek when you were picking on my friend a moment ago,did you?"


"Your... your friend?" Brice turned his head toward Eleanor with disbelief before dropping to his knees,pleading, "Mr. Brooks, I was out of line! I swear I had no idea she was close to you. I'd never dare touch her if I had known. It was foolish of me. Please, give me another chance, I swear I'll never repeat it."


He kept lowering his head over and over, begging like a man desperate to save himself.


At last, Ryland waved him off with clear contempt."Fine. You're lucky I'm in a good mood today, so I'll let it go. Now get out of my sight."


"Thank you, Mr. Brooks." Brice stumbled toward the door, nearly falling as he bolted from the club.  Lillian came rushing in just as he disappeared, her face tight with worry. "Eleanor, are you hurt?"


Eleanor shook her head and replied, "No, I'm alright."


Relief swept over Lillian, and she turned toward her brother. "Ryland, thank heavens you showed up. We really owe you."


Ryland chuckled softly as he patted her hair. "What matters to you matters to me. You don't need to thank me."


Eleanor dipped her head politely. "Thank you, Mr.Brooks."



"You don't have to be formal with me. You spilled plenty of wine. Go wash it off before it dries."


"Okay." Eleanor got up and headed for the restroom,though midway she crossed paths with Jonny, who had Lainey by his side.


Lainey greeted her with a bright smile. "Miss Warren,what a lovely surprise." Eleanor acknowledged her with the faintest nod,making no effort to continue the exchange.
The silence left Lainey stiff and uneasy. She turned to Jonny with a wounded expression. "Jonny, did I upset Miss Warren somehow?"
A deep frown formed on Jonny's face. "She's trying to greet you, and you can't even respond properly?"
Eleanor tilted her head, unimpressed. "Since when were we so close?"

"Don't get upset with Miss Warren on my account,"Lainey said quickly, clutching Jonny's hand with feigned gentleness.

What nonsense.

Eleanor decided it wasn't worth another word and turned to go, but Jonny's irritated voice cut through the noise. "If you're trying to draw me in, you don't need to humiliate yourself. My heart belongs to Lainey. No matter how much you try, it's pointless."
That was all she needed to confirm he had  completely lost touch with reality.
Her eyes lifted to his, calm but sharp. "I didn't step foot in this place for your sake. I came to enjoy myself. And let me remind you-we're divorced.You don't get to lecture me anymore."
The chill in her tone left Jonny restless. He couldn't grasp how the gentle, compliant woman he once married had turned into someone so unyielding.
"Miss Warren, how can you speak like that? Jonny only means well," Lainey interjected quickly, trying to defend Jonny.
Eleanor's gaze swept over them, full of disdain."Please. You're just a cheating husband and a shameless homewrecker. Do either of you really have the right to stand before me as ifyou're proud of it?Step aside. I have no time for nonsense."
With heels striking the floor like sharp notes, Eleanor swept past them, her crimson dress flowing around her like a rose in full bloom. Jonny's fists clenched as he stared after her, his chest burning. How had he lived all this time without realizing she carried such fire on her tongue?


Lainey reached for his hand and said softly, "Don't let her get under your skin, Jonny. Come back inside with me. Emma is waiting."


His expression darkened, yet he gave no reply.


While she had been overseas, he missed her every day. Yet now, with her right beside him, her presence felt strangely empty. Perhaps Eleanor's defiance had clouded his mind.



Together they turned and walked away.


Inside the private room, Ryland observed it all through the wide glass window. "I never imagined she was Jonny's wife. That makes things rather amusing."


sex-wife,actually," Nolan corrected firmly.

###Chapter 6 Any Progress With The Soul Surgeon
Ryland raised his brows in shock. "Nolan, don't tell me you're actually serious about Eleanor?"
No one could deny Eleanor's beauty, but Nolan was never short of women to choose from. Why waste his time on someone already divorced?
Nolan avoided giving a straight answer and instead asked, "Do you remember the woman I mentioned-the one who gambled against me over the Usepsall project?"
"How could I forget? Wait... you mean it was her?"
"Exactly." Nolan set his glass down with a faint curl at the corner of his mouth. "She's clever and knows how to hide her true self."

Ryland let out a low whistle, intrigued by the revelation  In all his years, Nolan had suffered defeat only once,and that defeat had come from Eleanor.
Fate, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.
"What about Fannie? Any progress with the Soul Surgeon?"
The moment those words left his lips, Nolan's expression hardened. "Word is, the Soul Surgeon has an obsession with antiques. In two weeks, David Gill will host an exclusive exchange. If luck favors us, we might find her there."
Ryland exhaled heavily. "Then that's our only option."


Lillian didn't escort Eleanor back to her villa until it was past midnight.
Morning light had barely touched the curtains when Eleanor's phone rang with a call from the Todd family's estate.
Sallie, Jonny's grandmother, was shocked when she learned about the divorce. She wanted Eleanor to join the family for a meal.


Throughout the three years Eleanor had been married, Sallie had shown her genuine affection.


Even after the divorce, Eleanor couldn't bring herself to disappoint the old woman.


By five o'clock, she stepped into the Todd family's residence right on time.


Vickie Todd, Jonny's mother, looked her up and down with disdain. "So Emma was right after all. That whole image of you being a proper wife was nothing but an act. Underneath, you're just a seductress."


"That's enough, Vickie! I invited her here to share a meal, not to listen to your insults!" Sallie snapped,her tone sharp with disapproval. She waved Eleanor closer. "Come here,dear."


Eleanor settled beside Sallie, who greeted her with a smile full of warmth.


"My dear, you've gotten thinner again in just a few days. Still, you look wonderful today. That lively style suits you. Young people should shine."
"Thank you, Sallie." Eleanor studied her closely.
you still drinking the herbal concoction I prepared for you?"
"Yes, I have, and it's worked wonders. I finally sleep without trouble."
Vickie gave a derisive laugh. "As if a country girl could treat insomnia. She might have slipped sleeping pills in the concoction. Of course anyone would sleep after that."
Sallie snapped, her voice sharp, "Enough! Don't belittle her like that. Eleanor gave three years of her life to this family. When your son was broken and helpless, she nursed him with devotion no one else could match. Women like her are rare treasures!"
Vickie's face twisted, but she had no words left to throw back. Bitterness burned in her chest as she kept quiet. "Don't lether sharp words trouble you. To me, you will always be the true granddaughter-in-law of this family. None of those shameless women outside will ever take your place."



"Grandma, that's unfair!" Jonny's voice rang out as he entered with Lainey clinging to his arm. "The only woman I've ever loved is Lainey."



"And what of it?" Sallie's glare landed on Lainey like a blow. "When you were laid up in bed, she couldn't stomach the sight of you crippled and fled overseas without hesitation. What love is there in a woman who abandons so easily?"


Lainey's lips trembled, and tears rimmed her eyes."Sallie, you don't understand. My family forced me to leave back then."



"Don't waste your excuses on me. You might fool Jonny, but you'll never fool me. I can see who you really are, crysal clear." Sallie's frail body shook from the effort of her outburst, and soon she was coughing violently. Eleanor immediately reached over and patted her back. "Sallie, don't push yourself too hard. Please stay calm, for your own sake."


When her breathing finally steadied, Sallie clasped Eleanor's hand with affection. "My dear, rest assured. As long as I live, no one in this house will dare mistreat you."


Gratitude welled in Eleanor's chest, yet she had no wish to keep hiding behind Sallie's protection. "Sallie,I was the one who asked for the divorce. I was done with a marriage that existed in name only. My feelings for Jonny are gone, and dragging it on any further would only be torture for us both."

###Chapter 7 | Abandoned Your Trust

Jonny's expression clouded over the moment Eleanor's words sank in.
"Eleanor, are you absolutely sure about this?" Sallie asked, her voice carrying a last trace of hope.
"I am," Eleanor answered with quiet conviction.
"In that case, I won't try to stop you," Sallie said softly.
She knew what a bad marriage meant to a woman. "If this is your choice, dear, then you have my full support."
"I appreciate that, Sallie."
"You don't have to force yourself to stay for dinner tonight. With Jonny and Lainey here, the meal will taste bitter. I'll invite you back another day, just the two of us." Moved by Salie's kindness, Eleanor nodded. "Alright, I'll come another time."
Rising to her feet, she turned her back on Jonny without hesitation and left the Todd family's estate with her head held high.
Determined to cut every last tie with Jonny,Eleanor made up her mind to settle matters completely.
Later that day, she called Lillian and asked her to connect with a real estate agent.
It didn't take long before Lillian showed up.
After inspecting the property, she asked with surprise, "This place is in such a prime spot. Are you sure you really want to let it go?"
"Keeping it feels like keeping bad luck. I'd rather sell it and move on," Eleanor responded.
"You're right about that. I'll handle everything, so you don't have to worry." Eleanor placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of her. "I appreciate it, Lillian."


"Don't mention it. It's what we do for friends," Lillian said as she sank into the sofa. "By the way, Mr. Gill is hosting an antique exhibition in two weeks. Want to come?"



Eleanor hesitated, uncertain. "I'm not sure he'd even want to see me again."



"You're overthinking." Lillian looped her arm around Eleanor's shoulders. "You're his only apprentice. Of course he wants to see you."


David Gill wasn't only a respected name in the antique collection industry. He was also the chosen heir of Mystic Glen's medical skills.


Every successor of Mystic Glen took just one student in their lifetime. David had chosen Eleanor.


Eleanor never failed David's expectations, mastering the refined craft of special tool therapy with extraordinary precision. To keep her identity hidden, she treated every patient behind a mask.


Whispers spread among the public, and with no real name to use, they began to call her the Soul Surgeon.


Her talent could have earned her recognition across the medical world, yet she chose to bury it and live as Jonny's dutiful wife for three long years.


The memory of David's defeated look before her marriage still haunted her, and guilt weighed heavily on her heart.



Lillian reached out to steady her. "Stop blaming yourself. I'll be by your side when the time comes."


"Okay."


Two weeks slipped away.


The highly anticipated antique exhibition opened with grandeur.


Crowds filled the venue, including the wealthy elite who cared little for antiques but wanted to bask in the spectacle.
Outside the lounge reserved for honored guests,
Eleanor faltered briefly before lifting her hand to knock.

"Come in."

At the sound, the door creaked open.
Seated by the window in his wheelchair, David faced away. In three years, his hair had grown strikingly silver.
"It's far too noisy outside. I'll step out when the intermission starts." Believing it was an attendant, he spoke without looking back.
Drawing in a steadying breath, Eleanor whispered,"Mr.Gill."
The old man froze, then slowly turned. His eyes widened."Eleanor?!"

"Yes, it's me." Eleanor crossed the room toward him. "I owe you an apology. After all your years of teaching, I abandoned your trust."


David gave a slow shake of his head. "No need to apologize. This is your life, and you deserve to make your own choices."


"I'm here now. This time, I'll carry forward the medical legacy you entrusted to me-as the Soul Surgeon."


"And will your husband stand behind such a decision?"
###Chapter 8 Say Sorry To Emma Right Now





"I'm divorced, and I refuse to lose myself in another man's shadow," Eleanor said.


"That's better." David's dislike of Jonny had always been clear, and he had never thought that marriage would last.



Still, he knew people often needed hardship before they could truly groW.


Now he was convinced this ordeal would forge Eleanor into someone unshakable.



Once her conversaion with David had reached its end,Eleanor didn't linger in the lounge.


Making her way toward the exhibition hall, she suddenly crossed paths with Emma.


The instant Emma spotted her, her face twisted with scorn. "So Lillian Brooks has made you bold.Are you really so desperate to win Jonny back that you'd chase him all the way here?"
"Watch what you say."
"Don't act innocent. I remember how you bowed to Jonny's every whim. You'll never fool me."
Eleanor recognized Emma's stupidity and chose not to waste energy. "Step aside."
"Absolutely not. I'm warning you, stay away from Jonny. The only woman fit to be my sister-in-law is Lainey!" Emma's shrill tone carried through the hall,quickly drawing a crowd.
Desperate to humiliate her further, Emma raised her voice. "Three years of marriage, and you couldn't even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?"
Eleanor's lips curved faintly as she replied, "If you're so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a  doctor. The problem lies with him, not me." Those words struck like a whip, and Emma lost all composure. "How dare you insult Jonny! I'll teach you a lesson right here!"
Spoiled by the Todd family, Emma had never cared about when or where she threw her tantrums.
As Emma lunged forward, Eleanor shifted lightly to the side, letting Emma stumble past and collide straight into the exhibition stand.
A deafening crash followed as a priceless vase toppled with its glass case and shattered across the marble floor.
For a heartbeat, the room froze. Security guards,guests, and staff all stared in stunned silence.
Jonny appeared first, pushing through the crowd with urgency. "What's going on here?"
"She shoved me!" Emma wasted no time, pointing at Eleanor. "She kept insulting me, then pushed me straight into the display!" <###Chapter 8 Say Sorry To Emma Right Now       +120 Points at most Jonny's glare snapped to Eleanor, his voice rising with anger. "It's bad enough you cause trouble everywhere else, but how dare you create a scene here? Say sorry to Emma right now."
It dawned on Eleanor then just how foolish she had been to once admire him. "So you just believe every word she spits out? Use your head,Jonny."
"Eleanor!" Jonny's face burned with humiliation."What has happened to you? How could you become   _"
Suddenly, applause rippled through the hall,cutting
Jonny's rantshort.
From the VIP section, Nolan emerged with Ryland at
his side.The murmurs among the crowd died instantly,

replaced with tense silence.Nolan, the man who dominated Elepdon's business
world,had arrived.
No one in the room dared to cross someone of his  standing.

"Who would've thought an exhibition could turn into such a performance? Truly unexpected," Nolan remarked.

At the sight of him, Jonny straightened at once and bowed his head politely. "Mr. Stewart."
###Chapter 9 Maybe You'll Have Better Luck Behind Bars
Nolan brushed past without a word, his steps halting only when he reached the glinting shards that littered the floor.
Ryland strolled up beside him, smirking as he looked down. "That piece was a real treasure-a rare antique, famous for its craftsmanship. Mr.Gill jumped through hoops to bring it here from overseas. What a shame to see it end up like this."
His voice carried a hint of regret, but the amusement in his eyes betrayed him.
Emma, who had only glimpsed Nolan once before,had secretly built up a fantasy of becoming his bride.
Now, with Nolan standing before her again, she wasted no time feigning innocence. "Blame Eleanor for this mess. Anyway, she's been getting pretty close to the Brooks girl. With their help, replacing one broken vase is nothing-she could probably fill the whole hall with new ones."


Eleanor had always found Emma's shamelessness impressive, but today's performance was a new record.



Without so much as a change in expression, Nolan turned to Eleanor, who had yet to speak a word."Miss Warren, do you really have nothing to say for yourself?"


Situations like this called for evidence, not empty words.


Eleanor held Nolan's gaze, steady and calm. "The exhibition hall is under surveillance. Checking the security footage will clear everything up."


Emma's face drained of color, and she nearly stumbled in panic. Of all things, she had not counted on the security cameras.


Ryland leaned back with a lazy shrug, his tone almost gentle. "I wouldn't be so sure, Miss Warren. This spot's a blind spot. Odds are the cameras didn't catch a thing."



A rush of relief washed over Emma. With no video evidence, she could spin any story she wanted.


Determined to make Eleanor pay, she put on her most curious expression. "Does anyone here know antiques? I'd love to hear what that vase was really worth."



An ensemble of collectors stepped forward,their voices ringing with authority. "Word is, Mr. Gill shelled out $1.5 billion at an auction overseas.Honestly, that vase was supposed to worth even more."



One point five billion. The number hit like a thunderclap. Even for the Brooks family, that kind of cash wasn't just lying around.



With an air of triumph, Emma shot Eleanor a smug look. "Did you catch that? We're talking $1.5 billion.Hope you've got a miracle up your sleeve. If you can't pay, we'll let the police handle you-maybe you'll have better luck behind bars."
While others expected her to crumble, Eleanor stood tall, completely unfazed by the threats.
Nolan watched her, eyes narrowed, silently wondering how she would manage to get out of this.
Jonny, growing more agitated by the second, shifted his weight.
He hated the thought of his ex-wife facing charges,but that sum was outrageous-even for him.
Every eye in the room stayed fixed on Eleanor,waiting for her to break or plead. Instead, she calmly lifted her phone and hit play on a voice recording.
The room filled with Emma's own sneering words."Three years of marriage, and you couldn't even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?"
Panic flared in Emma's eyes. She lunged for Eleanor's phone, but Nolan stepped in front of her,cutting off her attempt.


With a cold smirk, Nolan turned to Jonny. "Is this how your family raises your sister,Jonny?"


Jonny's jaw tightened as he yanked Emma back and snapped, "Enough, Emma. You've gone too far."


Never in her life had Emma seen Jonny glare at her with so much anger. She shrank behind him,suddenly small and shaken.


Eleanor let the recording play on.


Her own voice rang out. "If you're so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a doctor. The problem lies with him, not me."


Emma's furious voice followed. "How dare you insult Jonny! I'll teach you a lesson right here!"
###Chapter 10 Jonny, Did You Seriously Just Hit Me
A heavy silence swept over the room as every eye dropped to Jonny's lower body.


Who could have guessed that the mighty Todd Group's CEO would get exposed for bedroom troubles in front of everyone?



A stifled laugh slipped from Ryland before he could help himseIf. "Sorry. That just caught me off guard."


Rage twisted Jonny's features as he clenched his teeth so hard it looked painful. If he had ever imagined Eleanor would humiliate him like this, he would have dealt with her differently from the start.


Once the recording ended, Eleanor slipped her phone back into her pocket. "I trust this clears up the whole antique fiasco. I had nothing to do with it."


Nolan's lips twitched with clear approval. "No question about it."


Ryland chimed in, summing it up with a cheerful tone. "So, Miss Todd was the one who broke the vase. I guess that means Mr. Todd will have to foot the bill for the whole 1.5 billion."


Jonny opened his mouth to protest, but the evidence -and the numbers-were ironclad. There was nothing left to say.


1.5 billion. A price tag like that was enough to make Todd Group's bottom line bleed.


Dread pounded in Jonny's head as he pictured the fallout.


With a polite sweep of his arm, Ryland turned to the crowd. "Well, the matter's settled. No need to hang around here. Go enjoy the rest of the exhibition."


That was all it took for everyone to scatter,grateful for the excuse to leave the tension behind.


Nolan headed toward Eleanor, his gaze sharpening as he noticed a thin smear of blood on her ankle. "Miss Warren, you're bleeding. Don't you think you should look after that?"
Eleanor glanced down and spotted the crimson streak.
She realized it must have been a stray shard from the shattered vase.
The wound wasn't serious, but the blood made it look worse than it was.

"Thanks for pointing it out, Mr. Stewart.I'll handle it soon," she responded.

"There's a first aid kit in the VIP lounge," Nolan offered. "Feel free to use whatever you need."

"Thank you. I appreciateit,"Eleanor said, her tone calm but sincere.

Summer heat always brought worries about infections, especially with an open cut.

Eleanor never liked making a scene. She gave a quick nod and turned to make her way to the VIP lounge. The moment she tried to walk, her knees wobbled,and she lurched forward unexpectedly.


Jonny started to reach out, but someone else was faster.


Nolan's hand shot out, steadying her before she could fall. Noticing the fresh blood staining her ankle,he didn't hesitate-he simply scooped her up in his arms.



His hold was close and unashamed, drawing a low whistle from Ryland.



Nolan pulled something like this right in front of Eleanor's ex-husband-typical of his bold style!


Surprised, Eleanor struggled in his grasp. "Mr.Stewart,please let me down."


"Miss Warren, with an injury like that, walking's out of the question. Besides, no one wants blood spoiling a day like this for Mr. Gill-he's superstitious enough as it is."



Collectors could be a quirky bunch; a drop of blood  on a lucky day might send them spiraling.


Giving in,Eleanor stopped protesting and allowed herself to be carried toward the lounge.


Ryland took the cue and wandered off to handle the cleanup, not wanting to intrude.


Meanwhile, Jonny glared daggers at Nolan's retreating back, jealousy boiling in his eyes.


Emma, not letting up, leaned in and hissed. "Since when did that shameless witch get so close to Mr.Stewart?"



Her bitterness flared. "Mom always said Eleanor was a gold-digger. Now that she's out of our family, she's already leeching onto someone new."


A sudden, sharp slap rang out.


Stunned, Emma reeled, holding her cheek with wide eyes.


"Jonny, did you seriously just hit me?" she gasped,disbelief etched across her face. "You really slapped me just to defend that shameless bitch?"
###Chapter 11| Can Take Care Of It Myself

Jonny stiffened when he heard Emma's words, his face losing its calm.


He turned his eyes away and muttered under his breath, "Cut the act, Emma. Don't stir up drama in front of Mr. Stewart, or you'll drag our family into a disaster we can't handle. Understand?"



This time, the mess Emma created had reached an outrageous one and a half billion. That figure was enough to crush half of the Todd Group overnight.


Emma's jaw tightened as she bit back her anger."Eleanor is a seductress. She flirts-"


Jonny's voice exploded before she could finish."said shut it!"



The sudden rage in his tone made Emma flinch. Her shoulders drew in as tears welled up, spilling over in  helpless sobs.


Jonny's fists curled at his sides, his eyes narrowing on the place where Eleanor and Nolan had vanished.



It made no sense.



Nolan was too influential to waste his attention on Eleanor, who was ordinary, bland, and nothng more than a divorced country woman.



The only reason he stepped in must have been to avoid ruining David's mnood.


That explanation settled in Jonny's mind, giving him a bitter sort of relief.


Jonny yanked Emma by the wrist and steered her into a dim corner. His voice dropped low and sharp as he warned, "Keep your mouth shut tonight, or don't expect a single cent from me next month."


Emma's sobbing stopped in an instant. She blinked at him, stunned by the threat.


In the end, she swallowed her words and stayed silent.



At the same time, Nolan, with Eleanor in his arms,entered the VIP lounge.


Ryland hurried after them with a medical kit tucked against his side.


A curious gleam lit his eyes. He wanted to see more,yet he tried hard not to make it obvious, which gave him a strangely funny air.


The kit was set neatly on the coffee table.


"I'll give you two some space." With that, he darted out of the room.


Eleanor stared at the closed door, uneasy with the way he had phrased it.


Something about his tone didn't sound right.


Before she could dwell on it, a sharp pain jolted through her ankle.


"Ah!" Eleanor let out a sharp breath and immediately glanced down at her ankle.
 <###Chapter 11| Can Take Care Of It Myself        +120 Points at most By the time she noticed, Nolan was already crouched before her, pressing a cotton swab soaked in alcohol gently against the scrape.

The sting faded into a cool rush, soothing the ache while leaving behind a strange tingling sensation.

Focused entirely on his task, Nolan bent his head with quiet concentration.
Light streamed across his face, carving shadows along the edges of his strong profile. Even his lashes flickered faintly with every movement.

He was so close, his features felt almost unreal-striking in a way that made Jonny seem forgettable,unfairly breathtaking, as though he had stepped out of a dream.
For a fleeting second, Eleanor lost herself, her heart skipping out of rhythm.

Without breaking the rhythm of his hands, Nolan lifted his  gaze ever so slightly, catching the way she stared. Enjoying the view?" His words rolled out low and smooth as he teased her in that calm voice of his.
Heat rushed to Eleanor's face, the sudden blush making her feel like she had just been caught misbehaving.
Snapping herself back to the moment, she glanced around nervously, her cheeks still tinged with pink.
She reached out quickly, snatching the cotton swab from his hand to change the subject. "Mr. Stewart,this is nothing serious. I can take care of it myself."
Nolan's eyes narrowed slightly, a faint curve forming at the edge of his mouth.
Instead of arguing, he released his grip and let her handle it.
His stare, however, didn't move away, holding a glimmer of intrigue.
The weight of his attention unsettled her. His presence alone carried a pressure that was hard to ignore Summoning her courage, she finally looked up and asked with uncertainty, "Mr. Stewart, do you really have the time to stand here and watch me?"


After all, the head of Stewart Group wasn't someone expected to linger over such a trivial matter.
###Chapter 12 It Really Was Luck





A quiet laugh slipped from Nolan, his eyes carrying a shadowed depth that gave nothing away.



"Not really. I just happened to see you and got curious about what kind of tricks you'd pull next."



Tricks? The word made Eleanor's hand freeze mid-motion.



When she lifted her gaze, she met his stare head-on,a look so sharp it felt like he could peel away every secret she carried.



Her thoughts veered unexpectedly to that day three years ago, when she had gone head-to-head with him for the Todd Group. By some stroke of luck, she had pulled through, securing the vital Usepsall project.



The memory stirred up a storm inside her. Back then, she had been so naive, burning herself out for Jonny, nearly letting her true identity slip in the process.


Now, the memory almost felt absurd.


After wrestling with the thought, she finally blurted out, "I shouldn't have done that back then. I owe you an apology."


No matter what, she had played her hand with tricks that ended up costing him dearly.


At her words, Nolan's brows lifted ever so slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing his features.


Leaning closer, he closed the gap until his breath brushed the shell of her ear, low and deliberate.


Eleanor's body tensed, and she instinctively tried to pull back, only to realize the sofa behind her left her nowhere to go.


Nolan spoke in a velvet tone, rich with suggestion."An apology's not enough. What I want to know is how you managed to shake the market so badly in one night."


People on the outside saw Eleanor as nothing more than a gentle beauty, someone decorative but harmless.



Yet here she was, a woman who had once crippled Stewart Group's stock with alarming precision.


That was no feat an ordinary socialite could pull off.


His words sent her pulse racing, pounding so hard it felt impossible to hide.



Dropping her gaze, she worked faster with the bandages, eager to finish.



"It really was luck," she muttered. "And if the Usepsall project still interests you, taking it back would be nothing for someone with your abilities.My ties to Jonny are gone, and whatever happens to the Todd Group isn't my concern anymore."



Amusement flickered in Nolan's eyes, and the corner of his mouth curved into a deeper, knowing smile. Nolan shifted casually, stretching out against the sofa as though he owned the space.


"Taking it back?" His tone carried a low amusement,eyes glinting with interest. "I have to admit, the idea is tempting."


There was no mistaking it-this woman was far from the meek figure most assumed her to be.


She hadn't been years ago, and now, after breaking free from her marriage, her edges had only grown sharper.


The challenge only made her more intriguing to him.


He would take back the Usepsall project, that much was certain, but doing so in a way that entertained him sounded far more appealing.


Eleanor had just begun to relax when a polite voice sounded beyond the lounge door.


"Mr. Stewart, the intermission has begun. Mr. Gill requests the presence of all esteemed guests in the exhibition hall." Relief slipped from her in a quiet breath.


There was no denying Nolan's perception-his gaze alone felt like it could strip her of every guarded secret.



If this conversation had gone on much longer, she feared she might have revealed far too much.


"After you, Mr. Stewart," Eleanor said quickly, rising to her feet and making for the door before he could respond.


Her haste betrayed her. Painripped through her ankle, throwing her off balance and sending her body lurching forward.


In the blink of an eye, she would have hit the floor-if not for the sudden grip that caugt her around the waist. Strong arms steadied her, drawing her firmly into a solid embrace.


The clean, woody scent of pine drifted over her,wrapping around her senses as much as his hold did.
###Chapter 13 What's He Like





Eleanor's cheeks flared crimson, the color spreading up to the tips of her ears.


Snapping herself out of it, she pulled back quickly from Nolan's hold, forcing space between them.


The faint trace of his warmth still clung stubbornly to her fingers.


"Thank you, Mr. Stewart. I'll be on my way now."Without waiting for his reply, she turned and rushed out the door.


But the second she crossed the threshold, she collided hard with someone.



"Ouch!" Lillian shouted, rubbing at her forehead before blinking in surprise.


Of all people, it was her best friend.


Eleanor stood there flushed bright red, her eyes darting away, her breath uneven.


Lillian's expression lit up instantly, her curiosity bubbling over.


She hooked an arm around Eleanor's, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Alright, out with it! Who's the guy you've been hiding from me? Don't tell me you've gone and found yourself a new man already. Since when?"



She pressed on, "Give me the details-what's he like? Is he some young heartthrob, or are you chasing after another older one this time? Either way, I get first say. I'm not letting you fall for another disaster like Jonny again."



From behind Eleanor, a tall shadow stretched forward as Nolan stepped into view.



His expression remained unreadable, his eyes gliding past Lillian before locking firmly on Eleanor.



Lillian's mischievous grin froze midair, then began to crumble piece by piece. She blinked hard, her mind racing	
Impossible!	
How on earth had Eleanor ended up tangled with Nolan of all people?
And judging by the tension in the air, it wasn't just casual-they looked like two people caught in the middle of something... something way too intimate.
When had Eleanor's taste taken such a dramatic turn?
Nolan was the kind of man whose face alone could send a room spinning into chaos.

Yet Ryland had sworn to her that Nolan was the coldest, most untouchable man in Elepdon-someone who wore bachelorhood like armor and had zero patience for romance.

Nolan was supposed to be like a star one admired from afar, dazzling and unreachable.

No, this couldn't be happening. Eleanor had just escaped one disaster of a marriage -the last thing she needed was to get caught up with another man who spelled nothing but trouble.



Meanwhile, Eleanor desperately searched for a way to shut down Lillian's runaway imagination before it could spill from her mouth.


Eleanor waved her hands frantically, desperate to explain that nothing had happened. Whatever Lillian thought she saw, her relationship with Nolan was perfectly innocent.


But the panic in Eleanor's eyes only deepened Lillian's suspicions.


Before Lillian could launch into another round of questioning, Eleanor grabbed her hand and tugged her away in haste. "Lillian, it's late already. We need to get to the exhibit hall before Mr. Gill starts wondering where we are."


Nearly stumbling, Lillian allowed herself to be dragged along. Behind them, Nolan stayed exactly where he was,lips curling into the faintest amused smile.



This sly woman-every time she shed another layer of that careful disguise, she revealed something far more intriguing.



The exhibit hall was already buzzing, the excitement lingering long after David's appearance.


When the crowd finally began to scatter, Lillian seized her chance and circled right back to the topic she refused to drop.


"Eleanor, quit dodging. Confess and I'll go easy on you. Deny it and I'll drag it out of you. You and Mr.Stewart, locked in a room, and you came out blushing red like a schoolgirl? Don't tell me the two of you were just talking," Lillian said.


Eleanor's head spun under the assault of questions,her thoughts scrambling for a way out.



How was she supposed to explain that Nolan had simply helped treat her wound? Or that when she stumbled, he caught her to keep her from falling?


She knew better. Any honest explanation would only fuel Lillian's wild imagination-and turn a harmless moment into a story far more scandalous.
###Chapter 14 And If You Lose

While Eleanor struggled to find the right words, a neatly dressed staff member approached.
"Ms. Brooks, Mr. Brooks is waiting for you just ahead.Please come with me," the staff member said as he bowed to Lillian.
Lillian clicked her tongue in irritation, muttering under her breath, "Out of all moments, Ryland chooses now to appear. He really knows how to ruin the fun."
Her complaints aside, she trailed after the staff member without further fuss.
Eleanor exhaled deeply, a wave of relief washing over her.
Finally,silence.
With her mind settling, she turned her full attention to the gallery, taking the time to study the pieces carefully.


Her steps slowed as her gaze fell upon a painting titled Roses in Bloom by Rafael Turner.


Rafael, the most celebrated court painter of the last century, was known for works so rare they were deemed priceless.


The painting's composition certainly held alure,yet something about the canvas didn't sit right.


Eleanor's brows knitted as she flagged down a nearby staff member. "This piece seems suspicious.You should notify Mr. Gill immediately and have it taken down."



She couldn't allow David's exhibition to be tarnished by even a hint of forgery.


The staff member's expression darkened at her words. "Madam, that kind of accusation is reckless.Every itemdisplayed here has been authenticated."


Though he recognized her connection to Nolan, that didn't mean he would tolerate anyone questioning David's collection-or worse, making trouble.


Eleanor parted her lips to explain, but a derisive voice cut her off.



"An orphan like you dares to question an ancient masterpiece? Please. You're only here to cause a scene!" The voice, dripping with venom, belonged to Emma.



She had slipped away the moment Jonny's attention faltered, and by chance, she stumbled straight into this confrontation.



With a sneer, she shifted her glare to the staff member. "And you call this security? How can you let someone like her even set foot inside? What kind of standards does this gallery have?"


Earlier, Eleanor had made a fool of her. Now, Emma saw her chance to return the humiliation.


The staff member, already leaning against Eleanor,found courage in Emma's words. His hand shot out,aiming to seize her arm. Eleanor's gaze turned icy as she slid back a step,cool and measured.



His grip caught nothing but air. Overreaching, the man stumbled forward, nearly losing his balance in front of everyone.



Emma's expression twisted in disgust.



Pathetic.



He couldn't even handle one woman.



Emma wasn't about to waste the chance handed to her.



She lifted her chin and raised her voice so the crowd could hear. "Look at you-living off my brother-and now you dare to disrupt Mr. Gill's exhibition? Do you even realize who Mr. Gill is? And yet you've got the nerve to call his painting a forgery!"



Her sharp tone drew immediate attention, heads turning from every direction.



"That lady can't be serious. She's far too young to make such bold accusations."


"This is a joint show hosted by David Gill and Dyer Curtis. Everything here has been verified-there's no way an error slipped through."


"Pretty face, sure... but probably just some bored socialite desperate for attention."




···


The voices reached Eleanor, her brow twitching with irritation.



Emma really was hopeless. To spar with someone that foolish would only drag her down.


Eleanor decided she wasn't worth the breath.



The crowd was already watching, so backing down wasn't an option. If this was a stage, then Eleanor would decide how the play unfolded.


Her eyes turned cold as she fixed them on Emma's smug expression. "Emma, since you're so certain of yourself, why don't we settle this with a bet?" The sudden challenge made Emma falter.


What game was this woman playing?


Where did she find such nerve?


Could she really know something?


No. Impossible.


An orphan with no pedigree couldn't possibly understand antiques, much less paintings of this caliber.


This had to be a bluff-some desperate trick to scare her.


And besides, this was David and Dyer's exhibition.No chance anything here was fake.


Convinced of her own reasoning, Emma lifted her chin proudly. "A bet it is! Do you think I'm scared? If you lose, you'll apologize publicly-three times-and leave this gallery for good!"


She wanted nothing more than to see Eleanor humiliated, driven out with her reputation in ruins. But Eleanor's composure didn't crack. Her voice was cool and steady as she retorted, "And if you lose?"
###Chapter 15 You've Just Sealed Your Fate,Eleanor
Emma blinked at Eleanor's comeback, caught off guard for just a moment.
Lose? The idea seemed absurd. But with so many eyes on her, retreat wasn't an option.
Grinding her teeth, she puffed herself up and announced loudly, "Fine! If I lose, I'll apologize to you in front of everyone. And more than that-I'll cover the cost of every guest's minor purchases tonight. All of them, on me!"
Gasps rippled through the onlookers, their eyes gleaming with sudden interest.
Each individual purchase might have been capped at a hundred thousand, but taken together, the total could easily skyrocket into a staggering sum. The Todd girl was indeed rolling in money. Eleanor arched a brow, amused by Emma's recklessness. With the faintest smirk tugging at her lips, she answered coolly, "Deal."


Wasting no time, she motioned toward the staff member who had argued with her earlier.


"Open the case," she instructed.


The man hesitated only briefly before producing a key and unlocking the display. If Emma was willing to shoulder the consequences, why should he be the one to worry?


From her bag, Eleanor took out a pair of immaculate silk gloves, slipping them on with practiced ease.


After sliding the gloves snugly onto her hands,Eleanor reached into the display case with deliberate care, lifting Roses in Bloom under the unblinking stares of the onlookers.


She took a closer look at the painting, and a faint crease formed between her brows.


Her suspicion deepened-it wasn't linen canvas. To confirm, she took off one of her gloves and touched the canvas.


A wave of gasps broke through the hall. Was she insane? Who dared touch a Rafael Turner piece so boldly?


Emma's jaw dropped at first, but her shock quickly twisted into smug delight. "You've just sealed your fate, Eleanor," she sneered. "That painting is worth $2 billion. You couldn't afford it. And don't even think about crawling to Jonny for help. Our family doesn't bankroll fools who overreach."


Eleanor didn't flinch. Her gaze cut to Emma for a brief moment before sweeping past her to address the watching crowd.


"You might want to reconsider your words," Eleanor said evenly. "Anyone familiar with Rafael Turner knows he swore by linen canvas. The line canvas is famous for its strength and ability to withstand wear and tear. Its smooth surface allows for detailed brushwork. But this piece? The surface is rough, the weave loose. It's definitely not linen canvas."  The audience instinctively leaned closer, eyes narrowing to study the canvas for themselves.


Sure enough, the surface looked coarse.


Everyone knew-even the most celebrated painters-reserved linen canvas for their creations.


The thought of Rafael, a man of such stature, using cheap canvas for a masterpiece was laughable.


Emma's smug expression faltered as she caught the murmurs, but she quickly forced herself into composure.


"Perhaps Rafael was struck with sudden inspiration,"she insisted, lifting her chin. "Maybe he grabbed whatever canvas was within reach. Genius doesn't wait for perfect tools."



Eleanor gave Emma a look so dismissive it was as if she were humoring a child. Then, with calm authority she addressed the crowd instead.



"Historical records show that Rafael's wife adored green roses, and he painted countless masterpieces  of them for her. Yet look closely: this work depicts a red rose. More importantly, see the date inscribed in the corner? According to every biography, Rafael's wife had already passed away by then. He was so consumed with grief that he never painted roses again. He laid down his brush forever."


At her words, the crowd surged closer, necks straining to catch a glimpse of the small inscription in the corner.



Those standing nearest squinted, then straightened in shock.



"She's right-it's there!"


"The date doesn't line up at all!"
 
###Chapter 16 Do You Have No Dignity At All
Emma's stomach dropped, panic flickering in her eyes.



How could this be happening?



The piece had been authenticated by multiple experts-it couldn't be a forgery!


Shoving aside anyone in her way, she stormed toward Eleanor, her voice rising. "You must have stolen the real one! Otherwise, how would you know the exact details and call them out so quickly?"



But before her accusation could land, a booming laugh rolled across the gallery. "That's quite the sharp eye you've got, Eleanor!"


Every head turned toward the sound. Standing a short distance away was David himself, a broad smile stretching across his face. With a hand stroking his beard, he regarded Eleanor with playful admiration. "Truth be told, I've grown tired of the usual, predictable exhibitions. So l planted this forgery as a little test-a bit of fun for tonight.I never imagined you'd spot it so quickly."


His revelation sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.


So this had been David's doing all along.


Given his reputation for being unpredictable and eccentric, perhaps it wasn't so surprising he would stage such a stunt.


The audience accepted David's words without hesitation, nodding along as if the matter was settled.



But Dyer wasn't about to let David enjoy the spotlight alone. He scoffed loudly, his tone laced with mockery. "Hah! Just admit it, old man-you got duped by a forgery and now you're scrambling for a cover story. Lucky for you, Eleanor's got a sharper eye than you. Imagine if a buyer had spotted it after the sale-your so-called reputation would've gone up in smoke!"



David's face flushed crimson, his beard practically bristling in outrage. "You decrepit relic! You've got one foot in the grave and still wag that venomous tongue!"


Then, in a sudden shift, he turned to Eleanor with an exaggerated pout, almost childlike. "Eleanor, you saw it-this wrinkled fraud is smearing my name. You'd better stand up for me!"


Dyer bristled in return, jabbing a finger in David's direction. "Don't let that old goat fool you, Eleanor!He's as stubborn as a mule and never admits when he's beaten!"



Eleanor couldn't help the small smile tugging at her lips as she watched the two of them bicker like quarrelsome schoolboys rather than the venerable masters they were.


Some things about her teachers, she realized, would never change. Meanwhile, the spectators were left reeling.


The sight was baffling-two of the most legendary figures in the antiques world, sparring so familiarly with each other, and all while treating Eleanor with such casual warmth.


From the way they addressed her, it was obvious this connection ran deep.


Emma stood frozen, her mind reeling.


How could someone like Eleanor-a woman with nothing but an orphanage to her name-possibly be on such familiar terms with Dyer and David, two titans whose word alone could shift the antiques world?



Even her family struggled to get an audience with them.Unless...


Her eyes suddenly widened as the thought struck her. She jabbed a finger at Eleanor, spitting venom.


"You shameless slut! My brother just tossed you aside, and now you're already crawling into Mr. Gill's bed? Do you have no dignity at all?" Emma said.
A heavy silence swallowed the room.
Gasps rippled through the crowd-Emma really dared to say such a thing?
Everyone here knew the truth: David and Dyer weren't just respected; they were living legends in the antiques circle, men revered like walking archives of history.
To throw mud at David so brazenly... was Emma fearless, or simply brainless?
Eleanor lifted her chin, her gaze slicing through Emma with quiet contempt. "Emma, you never fail to prove just how stupid you are."
The insult hit, and Emma snapped. "Who are you calling stupid?" she yelled, face flushed with outrage.
But Eleanor didn't give her the satisfaction of a pause.Her lips curled faintly as she added, "Perhaps you've forgotten-our little wager from earlier still stands, doesn't it?"
###Chapter 17 Finish What You Started
Emma dropped her gaze, her lips pressed tight.


The thought of bowing her head to Eleanor-an orphan raised in obscurity-burned hotter than fire.


She was from the influential Todd family. If she actually apologized in front of this crowd, her reputation in the socialite circle would be obliterated.


Death itself felt kinder.


Her thoughts spun wildly, scrambling for escape.Then, in a sudden act of desperation, her knees buckled and she let herself collapse backward.



But Eleanor had seen it coming. She shifted a single step aside, and let Emma fall without interference.


Her body smacked the cold marble floor.


Gasps broke through the silence. The crowd stared,stunned by the spectacle. Eleanor's lashes lowered, her eyes cool as she took in Emma's trembling lashes and the faint, deliberate flutter of breath. A smirk tugged at her lips-such a cheap little trick, so predictable it was almost boring.


Turning to the staff member frozen nearby, she spoke evenly, her tone edged with authority. "Emma was quite clear earlier-she promised to cover every minor expense for today's gala. Don't just stand there. Start drafting the invoices. Our guests shouldn't have to wait on the Todd family's generosity."


The staff member, rattled by the string of commotions, didn't dare delay another second.


"Right away, ma'am!" he replied, hurrying off to begin tallying invoices.


Several minor families, who had scraped their way into the event through favors and connections,could hardly contain their excitement. They darted eagerly toward the displays, searching for pieces priced under a hundred thousand, grinning as if they had just struck gold. Meanwhile, Emma lay sprawled on the icy marble,feigning her swoon. But Eleanor's pointed words cut so deep she nearly fainted for real.


Her fists clenched so hard that her nails pierced her own skin, sharp pain barely containing the rage boiling inside her.


This bitch!



How dared Eleanor humiliate her like this in front of everyone?


She would make sure Eleanor paid dearly-she would see to it that Eleanor's life turned into a waking nightmare.


From the crowd, Jonny's conflicted eyes lingered on Eleanor.



Bathed in the glow of the chandeliers, she stood poised and serene, her calm elegance radiating like light itself. Her presence drew every gaze,leaving onlookers momentarily breathless.


When had she become this striking? No-"striking" wasn't even the right word. It was something more,something intangible, an aura that couldn't be denied.



Jonny's chest tightened. Was this truly the same Eleanor who once cowered, docile and submissive under his shadow?



And how in the world had she learned to analyze ancient paintings with such precision?



Impossible.



She had grown up in obscurity, without access to teachers or resources.


Convincing himself, Jonny scoffed inwardly. This must have been nothing more than blind luck-an accidental flash of insight.


That had to be it. Clinging to that thought, he forced himself to relax.



Across the hall, Nolan's eyes followed Eleanor with quiet intensity. His lips curved faintly, the ghost o a smirk tugging at them.



This woman-such a sly little thing.


When she played at innocence, she looked soft,almost harmless. But the moment her real edge surfaced, she became something else entirely-clever, sharp, almost dangerous.


The contrast only made her more compelling.


As if she had sensed his gaze, Eleanor's eyes shifted toward Nolan and collided directly with his.


For an instant, the world seemed to still. Her pulse stumbled, beating wildly as though it might burst through her chest.


Heat crept into her cheeks, and she tore her gaze away, flustered, as if his stare had stripped her bare in front of everyone.



One look from him carried a weight that made breathing difficult. The fleeting moment passed, swallowed by the hum of the exhibition.


Soon after, the event wound to a smooth close without further incident.


Later, in the quiet of the VIP lounge, Nolan pressed his fingers to his temples, his eyes narrowing slightly as he shifted his focus to Ryland. "Have you found anything on the Soul Surgeon?"


Ryland's brow tightened, his expression shadowed by unease.


"I ran a covert sweep," he responded slowly. "On the surface, nothing stands out. But..."


His words faltered, caught between caution and duty.


Nolan tilted his head, his gaze steady, his tone calm yet carrying command. "Finish what you started."
###Chapter 18 Your Sister's Condition Has Deteriorated

Ryland leaned back with a teasing grin. "Aside from Miss Warren dazzling everyone today... Tell me,Nolan,are you actually interested in her?"
Nolan's eyes snapped to him, cold and cutting, a look sharp enough to silence the room.
The grin slid right off Ryland's face. He rubbed his nose awkwardly, realizing he had gone too far.
He hadn't asked out of malice.
Eleanor might be lovely, yes, but she was still a divorced woman. The Stewarts were a dynasty, and someone like her slipping into their world sounded impossible.
Nolan was his oldest friend, and he couldn't help but worry Nolan would get dragged into something messy. But under that piercing stare, his throat tightened,and his courage drained away. He raised both hands in surrender. "Alright, I'll shut up. Forget | said anything. I'll head out before you freeze me to death."


With that, he bolted for the door, retreating like a man who had just escaped an execution.


The room had barely settled into silence when the door opened again, and Erick Wright, Nolan's assistant, entered briskly. His face was grave, his tone clipped.


"Mr.Stewart, news just came from the hospital. Your sister's condition has deteriorated. None of the prescribed treatments are working anymore," Erick said.



Nolan's hand clenched around the coffee cup, the quiet crack of pressure filling the room. "I don't care what it costs-track down the Soul Surgeon and force an entry into the Underground Network."


He lowered the cup onto the table, lids closing for a fleeting moment. When his eyes opened again, they were cold steel. "And another thing-tell the hospital to pull every string, use the finest medication, the best equipment. Fannie must be watched every second. If they fail her...they might as well burn their doors shut."



The weight of his words made Erick's spine lock tight, a sheen of cold sweat breaking across his brow."Yes,Mr.Stewart. I'll see to it immediately."


At the Todd family's villa, Emma burst through the doors like a storm.



Her designer bag crashed onto the sofa, and she practically shook with rage.


That bitch Eleanor!


She had shamed her in public, cost her a fortune,and made her a laughingstock!


And worst of all, Jonny had defended that tramp! Did he actually fall for her? Impossible!


Emma's thoughts shifted furiously. Lainey. Yes, she  needed Lainey.


Together, they could crush Eleanor before she wormed her way any further into their world. She couldn't-she wouldn't-let Eleanor win.


Just as Emma was about to storm upstairs, the front door opened and a familiar silhouette stepped inside.


"Lainey!" Emma rushed forward, her voice shrill with grievance."You won't believe what happened today.That wretched Eleanor-she humiliated me in front of everyone! And Jonny-he actually hit me because of her! He's never laid a hand on me before!"


At Emma's words, Lainey's eyes glimmered, though her hands tightened into fists behind her back where no one could see.



Of course, she knew about David's antique exhibition. It was the grand event of the season, the kind of gathering where connections were forged and reputations polished.


Naturally, she had thought Jonny would escort her-  after all, she wNas supposed to be his girlfriend now.


But the phone never rang.


Instead, whispers drifted through the city, then a ruckus at the Todd family's villa drew her here.


And once again, the root of the chaos was Eleanor.


That bitch was like a ghost that refused to stay buried-an orphan from nowhere daring to stand tall in David's hall, even managing to shake both Jonny and Emma.


Beneath the surface, Lainey's resentment twisted sharper, but on her lips bloomed a gentle, practiced smile. "Emma, you've really been wronged tonight."


Lainey reached out, patting Emma's hand with practiced tenderness as she guided her back into the villa. "Jonny lived with Eleanor for three years, Emma.Old habits don't vanish overnight."



Emma's face twisted with frustration. "Lainey, you're too soft! What's so special about that cunt anyway?First she bewitched Grandma, and now even Jonny  looks like he's under her spell!"


Her voice cracked with fury as she stamped her foot against the floor, the sound echoing through the hall. ###Chapter 19 We Should End This





While Emma and Lainey spoke, footsteps echoed from the foyer.


Jonny walked in, shoulders heavy with fatigue, his tie loosened and expression drained.



The instant Emma caught sight of him, she gave a loud, indignant huff, spun on her heel, and stormed upstairs without so much as a glance back.



Lainey forced her envy down, smoothing her features into softness as she stepped toward him. "Jonny...you're back."


His eyes lifted, hazy and distracted, and for a fleeting moment, Eleanor's smile seemed to flash across Lainey's face.



Damn it. He clenched his jaw, shaking his head sharply. Was he losing his mind, imagining that woman in front of him? "Lainey." His voice was clipped, dismissive. "It's late.I'll have the driver take you home."


The words cut clean, leaving no room for argument.


Her practiced smile faltered, the corners trembling before she forced them back into place.


Her nails dug into her palms. Since when had Jonny ever turned her away like this?


Emma's accusation earlier rang in her ears-was Jonny really falling for Eleanor?



Impossible. That woman had nothing-no pedigree,no power,no status.


And yet...what if he was?


No. She couldn't sit idly by and risk losing everything.





Men's affections were fickle.



What lasted was control-wealth, power, security.


That was what she had to seize, now more than ever. Tears suddenly wwelled in Lainey's eyes as she slipped her hand from his. Her voice trembled,though her words were measured. "Jonny... it's alright. I don't need the driver. I only came tonight to say goodbye."



Turning on her heel, she let her shoulders quiver faintly, the image of a woman too choked with grief to explain herself any further.


The haze in Jonny's mind shattered instantly. Panic cut through his exhaustion, and he stepped forward,his chest tightening. "Lainey, what's going on? Tell me."



Slowly, she pivoted back, catching his gaze at the precise moment his worry peaked.



Her eyes clung to him with deliberate sorrow, heavy with reluctant affection. "Jonny... we should end this.My family can't afford to wait any longer. Our business has been struggling, and my father's alreadly speaking with a foreign partner. He wants me to marry into their family." Her voice broke at the edges, yet her delivery was flawless. "I'm sorry. I can't disobey my father... or turn my back on my family."


Jonny froze, then unraveled.



He seized her with both arms, clutching her as though sheer force could bind her to him forever."No, Lainey. Don't say that. We've fought too hard to be together. I won't lose you now."


To him, she was perfection itself-the woman he had longed for, the one he believed he couldn't live without. Letting her go felt impossible.


In that desperation, a reckless promise burst from him. "The Usepsall project is vast, Lainey. Tomorrow,I'll transfer forty percent of the distribution rights directly into your hands. Once you control that share,your father won't dare pressure you again. For the Todd Group's sake, he'll have no choice but to support us."



A flicker of triumph sparked in her eyes before she quickly dimmed it, replacing victory with feigned doubt. "Jonny...are you sure you can do that?"


He gripped her hand with fierce conviction. "I'd give you everything if it meant keeping you by my side.Nothing-no one-will come between us this time."


Her expression melted into relief, a delicate smile breaking through her tears. She buried herself against his chest, voice trembling with delight."Jonny...I knew you wouldn't fail me. I knew you were the only one who truly cared."


Eleanor had wasted three long years wearing the title of Jonny's wife, and what did she walk away with?Nothing but scraps and humiliation.


Lainey smirked to herself. She wouldn't be that foolish. A little sweetness here, a touch of vulnerability there, and Jonny was already placing the world at her feet.


The desired seat of Jonny's wife? That was hers for the taking. And when the time was right, the entire Todd Group would follow. 
###Chapter 20 Add This Site Too





It seemed Lainey's mention of splitting up had touched a raw nerve.


The following morning, Jonny arrived at the company with Laineyand immediately called the executives together.


"From this moment on, Lainey Gilbert is my secretary. She'll oversee every decision concerning the Usepsall project. Her words carry the same weight as mine. Clear?" Jonny declared.


The executives nodded in unison without hesitation."Understood, Mr. Todd."


After all, everyone knew Lainey was the one Jonny treasured most.


No one would dare slight her.


Once he saw everything settled, Jonny lightly touched the top of Lainey's head. "I've got a meeting to attend, so I'll head out. Someone will take you around the company in the meantime. There's a new restaurant nearby everyone's talking about. I'll bring you there for lunch."



Lainey lowered her gaze with a bashful smile and murmured,"Okay, Jonny."


Jonny had clearly fallen under her charm.


Even if her position came through personal ties,Jonny's influence guaranteed that every executive showed Lainey the highest respect.


Allard Moss, the head of Planning Department,promptly handed her a file. "Lainey, these are the proposed demolition sites for the Usepsall project.Take a look. If everything checks out, I'll pass them along to the shareholders."



Lainey accepted the folder and skimmed through the pages without much thought.


But as she was about to shut it, her eyes froze on two words: "Hope House."


Wasn't that the orphanage where Eleanor had grown up?


Before coming back to the country, Lainey had already done her research.


The idea crossed her mind, and she pointed carelessly. "Add this site too. It's close to Ravenswood River, and riverside housing could be developed there."


Allard traced her gesture and frowned in disapproval.


He knew the location carried almost no commercial worth, and tearing it down would be nothing but trouble.



"Lainey, about this site-"


Before he finished, Lainey cut him off. "Allard, are you forgetting what Jonny said?"


Her voice sounded calm, but there was an edge in it that warned him not to push further. Allard didn't dare argue. He nodded quickly and bent slightly. "Yes, I'll handle it right away."


As he rushed off, Lainey's smile grew wider.


She wondered if Eleanor would appreciate the little "gift" she had prepared. Compete with her? How foolish.



Once the document arrived at Stewart Group, Erick intercepted it without delay.


He hurried it straight to the president's office. "Mr.Stewart, the Todd Group has just released their Usepsall project plan."


Nolan leaned back in his leather chair,barely glancing up at the words. "Put it down."


His fingers drummed a steady rhythm against the desk. "Anything from the Underground Network?"


Erick set the file on the desk where it belonged,but he didn't move away.


"Nothing yet." He hesitated before adding,"Mr. Stewart, one of the proposed sites in Todd Group's plan is the Hope House. Should I-"


Nolan stopped tapping and slowly turned his head toward him.



He reached for the folder and studied it with sharp focus.


Three years earlier, Stewart Group had invested heavily in the Usepsall project, only for Eleanor to snatch it away at the final stage.


Nolan hadn't pulled his money back, choosing instead to use it as a way to measure Eleanor's ability.


But Eleanor was shrewd, rarely leaving any weak points.


Now that Hope House was listed for demolition, he was eager to see how she would handle it.


With that thought, he placed the document back on the desk, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "Get in touch with Eleanor. Remind her she still owes me a favor from the last exhibition."
###Chapter 21 Pull Out Every Bit Of Our Investment
Erick caught the faint curve of a smile tugging at Nolan's lips.



He kept hearing Ryland's whispers in the back of his mind, unable to shake them off.


Was it possible? Could it be that the unshakable Nolan was actually falling in love? Snapping back to reality,Erick quickly responded, "I'm on it, sir."


By chance, the place chosen for their meeting happened to be a newly opened restaurant Jonny had mentioned.



The refined sign above the entrance caught Eleanor's eye, leaving her puzzled.


Why would Nolan invite her without warning?


Still, she remembered how he had rescued her from  embarrassment at David's exhibition.



Since she owed him for that,paying the debt felt only fair.


Holding onto that reminder, she straightened herself and stepped inside.


Nolan was waiting by the window when she entered the restaurant.



He wore a plain white shirt with the sleeves loosely rolled, and there was a quiet elegance about him that stood apart from the lively chaos surrounding him.


She approached with quiet poise. "Mr. Stewart, with everything on your schedule, you still find time to have me here for this meal?"



Her voice drew Nolan's gaze upward, his eyes carrying a flicker of interest.


A subtle, unreadable smile formed as his dark eyes lingered on her.


Erick received a brief glance from him, one loaded with unspoken meaning.


Catching the signal, Erick pulled a file from his briefcase and presented it with formal respect.



Curious, Eleanor extended her hand and opened the file.



Her face immediately clouded over.



Hope House?



Why would Todd Group target such a place?



The land was isolated and held little commercial promise,while relocation costs would be staggering.



Jonny would never come up with something this shortsighted.



She understood Jonny better than anyone.


To Jonny, nothing mattered more than money and prestige.


Tearing down an orphanage offered no real gain, only the risk of branding him as cruel and merciless. That very morning, Todd Group's internal networks exploded with chatter: Lainey had appeared out of nowhere, installed as Jonny's personal secretary, and placed in charge of the entire Usepsall project.


There was no doubt that Lainey had been the one behind this!


Still, what puzzled her was Nolan's effort to make sure she knew.


With that thought pressing her, Eleanor asked him outright.


Nolan's fingers slid idly along the edge of his glass,his tone calm and smooth. "I simply value our connection, Miss Warren. And if you require assistance..."



Before he could continue, Eleanor snapped the folder shut, interrupting him. "I appreciate it, Mr. Stewart,but I'll have to refuse your offer."


After all, every businessman had his own motives.


It was impossible for her to accept that Nolan's  motives were purely generous.


Hearing her answer, Nolan made no attempt to argue.


Setting his glass aside, he drummed his fingers on the table and spoke in a measured tone. "You've been informed, Miss Warren. Handle it however you like. It's getting late-I'll head out now."


He got up from his seat and made his way out without another word.



Following after him, Erick could hardly hide his confusion.


All that trouble for a quick conversation with Eleanor -was that really the point?


After they exited the restaurant, Nolan handed down more orders. "Assign someone to watch her. Tell me the moment she makes a move. And for the Todd Group-pull out every bit of our investment."


Erick could foresee the fallout the Todd Group was about to face. "Understood,Mr.Stewart." Out of everyone they could have challenged,the Todd Group chose the very person who had caught Nolan's attention. It was clear their days of standing strong were numbered.
###Chapter 22 Why Don't You Ask Your Girlfriend,Jonny

When Nolan and Erick disappeared, Eleanor took her time standing up.
She wandered toward the restaurant entrance, only to find herself face to face with a figure she recognized all too well.
Jonny, of all people.
Could this day get any worse?
Ugh.Why did it have to be him here of all places?
He had already spotted Nolan's car outside, but seeingEleanor now sent a wave of old resentment crashing over him.
His jaw tightened, and his voice was harsh. "What's wrong, Eleanor? Still upset your payout wasn't big enough? Honestly, you waste no time moving on. Shameless,as always."


Eleanor roller her eyes, and fixed him with a flat stare. "Jonny, we're divorced."


The message came across loud and clear. It was none of his concern!


She stepped forward, deliberately closing the distance, her gaze cutting past him to settle on Lainey. Then she glanced back with a sly grin. "You know, Jonny, I never imagined you'd do something like that. Tearing down an orphanage? Looks like you've lost more than your sense of decency this time."



Confusion clouded his features. "What are you talking about?"


WVith a laugh that was anything but friendly, Eleanor shook her head and brushed by him.


Just as she passed, she let her words linger in the air."Why don't you ask your girlfriend, Jonny? Maybe she'll clear things up for you." Eleanor didn't wait for a response. She slid into her car, started the engine, and left him in the dust.


Frustration boiling over, Jonny turned and kicked the flower bed, muttering curses under his breath.


He wracked his brain. Since when was an orphanage part of the Usepsall project? Was Eleanor just making things up?


He shot Lainey a look, ready to demand answers,but his phone buzzed with an urgent call.


"Mr. Todd, there's a problem! Stewart Group has just pulled its investment!"


Jonny nearly dropped his phone. "Come again? What did you just say?"


A shaky voice spilled through the phone. "They called our whole leadership incompetent. They're saying we greenlit tearing down an orphanage.They think we're heartless and out of our depth."


Jonny clenched his phone so hard it nearly snapped in two. Stewart Group's money was the backbone of the entire Usepsall deal. If they backed out now,every cent spent would be gone for good.


"Who in their right mind slipped an orphanage into the demolition list?" Jonny snapped.


Allard could feel Jonny's anger even through the line,and fear gripped him completely.


"l-it was Lainey, Mr. Todd. You once told me that whatever she said came directly from you, so I didn't have the courage to oppose her!" Allard replied.


Jonny turned on Lainey in a flash, grabbing the front of her shirt.



With red-rimmed eyes, he glared at her. "I put my trust in you, Lainey, and this is what you do? I get that you have issues with Eleanor, but risking the company's future-was that worth it?"


Lainey never imagined that the Stewart Group would respond with such intensity.


She always thought the orphanage was just one  possible site, nothing anyone would lose sleep over.


That reasoning stayed locked away, though.


Tears pricked the corners of her eyes as she clung to Jonny's sleeve, her voice a soft whimper. "Jonny,I swear I had no idea the orphanage mattered to Miss Warren. It's right by the Ravenswood River, and building villas there seemed like smart business. I'm so sorry. If I've put you in a tough spot, I'll step down and take the blame."


Her words faded into a hush. She looked small and broken.



A wave of regret crashed over Jonny.


How could Lainey have known about Eleanor's ties to the place?


Lainey was sweet,never the scheming type.


Maybe his own stress made him lash out.


Remorse showed plainly on his face as he drew her into his arms, murmuring an apology. "I lost my head, Lainey. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I'm just under a lot of pressure."



Lainey let herself be held, peeking up at him with a gentle, forgiving smile. "It's okay, Jonny. I understand how hard things are for you."
###Chapter 23 You'll Pay Dearly For It





Neither Jonny nor Lainey had the stomach to sit down for a meal after what had happened.


Once Jonny dropped Lainey at her place, he drove straight back to the company on his own.


Allard had been pacing near the doors, nerves stretched tight. The moment Jonny appeared, he rushed forward. "Mr. Todd, it's bad. Word's out that the Stewart Group has pulled their investment. The shareholders are packed into the conference room,and they're demanding answers from you right now!"


Frustration flared across Jonny's face.



Those self-serving old men had enjoyed their steady dividends for years without complaint, and now, at the first sign of trouble, they wanted blood.



He swore that once new investments were secured,he would throw every last one of them out. He swallowed his temper and moved toward the elevator, forcing himself to stay composed.


Allard trailed him with a heavy sigh, unable to stop comparing the past to the present.


Back when Eleanor was in charge, the board never dared to act like this.


Since Lainey's arrival, however, chaos had followed at every turn.


When they reached the top floor, Jonny shoved the conference room doors open with a violent kick.


A hush swept through the shareholders. Unease flickered in their eyes.



Was Jonny about to take the fight directly to them?


Colby Rayne, leaning heavily on his cane, stepped to the front with a glare that cut across the room. "The Stewart Group has pulled out, and word is it happened because of Lainey. Don't you think we're owed an explanation,Jonny?" That single accusation broke the restraint of the others.


"That's right! Without Stewart Group, the Usepsall project is finished!"


"Why would you let someone so inexperienced take such a critical role? Lainey is nothing compared to Eleanor. Bring Eleanor back before everything collapses!"



Heat surged through Jonny's temples, and he clenched his jaw so tight it hurt.


Eleanor might have been reliable in the past, but she was stuck in the old ways.


Lainey, at least, had the courage to act, even if she had stumbled this time.


"Shut it! All of you!" Jonny's voice cracked like a whip. "You think you can talk big now, but when the site reports were sent out, not one of you bothered to lift a finger. And the moment things go wrong,you dump the blame on me? On Lainey?" He swept his gaze through the crowd. "Tell me-are you defending Eleanor out of loyalty, or because she was keeping you warm in your beds?"


The venom in Jonny's voice left the room reeling.



Dark expressions swept across the faces of the shareholders.



With a man like him steering the ship, collapse seemed inevitable.



None of them were related to Lainey-why should they shoulder the fallout of her mistakes?



And with nearly half the decision-making power in her hands, what chance did anyone have of stopping her?



Colby slammed the end of his cane against the polished floor, a bitter laugh escaping him. "Forget Lainey for a moment. But Eleanor? How dare you drag her name through the dirt? She graduated at the top of her class with two degrees-finance and clinical medicine-from Northbridge University. Without her work, the Todd Group wouldn't even exist today."


Locking eyes with Jonny, he continued, "Jonny,gratitude matters. If you keep throwing away gold for scraps, mark my words-you'll pay dearly for it."


Spinning on his heel, he stormed out of the room,his cane striking hard with every step.


The remaining shareholders filed out in silence,muttering under their breath, some shaking their heads, others sighing in disgust.


What had once been a room buzzing with voices and clashing opinions now echoed with nothing but emptiness.


Jonny dropped heavily into the chair, his thoughts spinning out of control.


Eleanor... from Northbridge University? With two degrees, no less? The claim sounded absurd.


Northbridge was one of the most elite schooIs in the country, and its graduates were often snatched up  with offers worth millions.


How could Eleanor, an orphan with nothing to her name,possibly measure up to that standard?


Questions clawed at him. When had she ever been involved in the company?


In his memory, she had been tied to the house-washing clothes, cooking meals, caring for his grandmother. She had hardly stepped foot into the office. So how had Colby twisted reality into believing she was the secret force behind Todd Group's rise?



The longer he mulled it over, the sharper the crease on his forehead grew.
###Chapter 24 Lainey Should Live Here With You
From the shadows of the room, Allard stepped forward with hesitation. "Mr. Todd, you've never paid much attention to Eleanor, so it makes sense you wouldn't know. The truth is, your grandmother arranged all of this behind the scenes. Over the years, Eleanor has given everything to this company,and we've all seen the effort she put in."


Upon hearing this, Jonny almost laughed.


To him,Eeanor wasn't some tireless worker.


She was an opportunist chasing money and recognition.


She built herself on lies. What real skill could she possibly offer?


The company would survive just fine without her. Driven by that thought, Jonny fixed his gaze on Allard. "Get me in front of the Stewart Group's investment manager. I'll handle the negotiations myself."


"Right away, Mr. Todd!" Allard hurried out, but not long after, he returned with his head low and shoulders heavy. "Sir, they refused to budge. No matter what I said, they wouldn't reconsider. I don't think there's any chance left."



Fury surged through Jonny as his fists tightened.


If the Stewart Group wanted to pull out, so be it. He would secure another investor.


The Usepsall project was a treasure waiting to be claimed, and he refused to believe there wasn't another company eager to profit from it.


Allard was waved off with little concern, and Jonny strode back into his office.


Every effort he made to salvage the situation ended the same way. He humbled himself, reached out to one firm after another, yet not a single company dared to back him.



Each response carried the same excuse-they couldn't afford to offend the Stewart Group.


Defeat pressed down on him as he collapsed onto the sofa, his temples throbbing with anger.


For years, the Todd Group had run smoothly, and it always seemed to trace back to the time he married Eleanor.



Could it really have been her doing all along?


The very idea made him scoff.


No way.


Eleanor was nothing more than a plain, uninspiring wife. What did she know about running a corporation?


It had to be pure luck, nothing more.


Agitated, Jonny yanked at his tie, then stormed out to head home. The moment he stepped through the door,Lainey appeared in his path. "Why are you here?" he asked,his tone sharp.


Even though he understood she had acted with good intentions, Jonny couldn't forget the humiliation he had suffered that day. The memory still stung, and his words came out sharper than he meant.


Clutching her dress tightly, Lainey wondered if his coldness was because of Eleanor.



Men,she thought bitterly, could never be trusted.


Luckily, she had already laid the groundwork. Vickie knew of her desire to move in and eventually marry Jonny.



Once she secured her place as his wife, the Todd fortune would naturally fall into her hands.


Then she wouldn't need to bend over backwards to keep him happy.


She put on a sorrowful expression for Vickie's benefit. "Vickie, it feels like Jonny doesn't want me here.I should go and visit you another day."


She made a move to walk away.


Jonny hadn't told her to leave, and confusion flickered across his face. Just as he opened his mouth,Vickie cut him off.


"Jonny, you're exhausted from carrying the company every day. You deserve someone gentle and considerate by your side," she said warmly. "Lainey should live here with you. You're still young, and it's only natural to build your feelings together."


Her smile broadened, pride in her tone."You wasted three years shackled to that thankless country woman Eleanor.Now that she's out of the picture, it's time to give Lainey the place she deserves. I'll speak to her father tomorrow and finalize your wedding date."



The Gilbert family couldn't compare to the Todds in power, but Lainey had grown up under Vickie's watchful eye. Her beauty and her gentle manner pleased Vickie, who had already decided she was the  right woman for Jonny.


Emma, brimming with excitement, clasped Lainey's hand. "This is wonderful! You're finally going to be my sister-in-law. I've been waiting for this forever!"


Emma had despised Eleanor from the beginning,and in her mind Lainey was the perfect fit for her brother.


Jonny's gaze shifted from his mother to his sister,then landed on Lainey. Something gnawed at him.


Was she deliberately pressing for marriage?


That didn't sound like her.


She was supposed to be gentle, sincere, incapable of scheming.


She must really care for him if she wanted to stay by his side.


As he was reassured by the thought, his voice lost its edge. "Lainey, forgive me. I've been on edge with work, and I didn't mean to sound harsh. I'm glad you're here. Moving in is fine, but the wedding will  have to wait. The company demands too much of me right now."


Patience had always been Lainey's strength.


Sliding her arm around his, she leaned against him with a soft smile. "Jonny, you don't need to apologize. I'm the one who's been selfish, bothering you when you're exhausted."


Her tenderness chipped away at his defenses.


He drew her into his arms and brushed a kiss against her hair. "You're amazing, Lainey."


From the corner of the room, Vickie and Emma exchanged knowing glances before quietly slipping away to their bedrooms.


The moment Lainey settled into the Todd household,Eleanor would be nothing but a memory. The thought filled them with quiet satisfaction.
###Chapter 25 | thought you'd left us behind
Word of the Stewart Group pulling their investment from the Todd Group didn't reach Eleanor until days later, when Lillian's text appeared on her screen.


Scanning the message, Eleanor arched a brow.


Without Stewart Group's money, the Todd Group would be strapped for cash, and that meant the orphanage would no longer be under threat.


Could Nolan have had a hand in this? Always meddling, always forcing her to feel indebted.


She hated the idea of owing him anything.


Control was something she preferred to keep in her own hands


Determined, she scrolled through her contacts until her finger hovered over a number she hadn't called in  years. This time, she hit dial. The line connected in seconds.
On the other end, a choked voice burst out with emotion. "Boss! You're finally reaching out! It's been three years-I thought you'd left us behind."
That voice belonged to someone she knew all too well.
A faint smile touched her lips, but her words were clipped and direct. "I need you to secure a piece of land in Elepdon. It doesn't matter if it's remote, as long as it's quiet and nowhere near the Usepsall project. Then set up a company in Vladena under the trademark Enigma. The paperwork will list you as the legal representative. My name must stay completely off the records."
One instruction after another spilled from her lips,and the person on the line was so overwhelmed with excitement that their voice shook. "Boss, are you back in the game? That's incredible! For three years I've been forced to sell your designs to other firms, and every time it felt like betrayal. Now we can finally rise again."
The moment she ended the call, Eleanor let out a quiet breath of relief.
Securing land meant she could shield the orphanage from future threats.
For now, Nolan's interference had bought her time,but she knew Lainey wouldn't stop scheming.
Once the land was in her hands, the orphanage could be moved whenever needed, safe from the shadow of the Usepsall project.
The funding for construction would flow directly from Enigma,giving the children a stable future.
Better stil, all traces of the plan would lead back to her apprentice, keeping her own name safely hidden.It was the perfect move.
Compared to that, Lainey's shallow games looked like the tantrums of a child. Only a fool like Jonny would put Lainey on a pedestal and call her priceless.


And as if her thoughts had conjured him,her phone lit up with his name.


Ugh.


Why couldn't Jonny just leave her alone?


With an annoyed swipe, Eleanor accepted the call."Spit it out. What are you bothering me for this time?"


Hearing her voice sent a thrill racing through Jonny.To him, it was proof that she still couldn't resist him.No matter how coldly she tried to cut him off,one call from him and she came running.


That smugness bled into his words. "Eleanor,Lainey's already living with me now, so stop dreaming about being my wife. But if you swallow your pride and come back, I'll still take you in."


Maybe it was because Lainey was too simple-minded, but ever since she moved in, the house felt like a circus.


Eleanor, raised in an orphanage, had been better at managing the homne.


Lainey was easygoing, though. She wouldn't make a fuss about sharing.


The idea of juggling two women at once thrilled Jonny, and his voice grew more animated. "I can tell you still want me. If you play nice, I might even think about giving you a child. Doesn't that sound good?"


Eleanor nearly gagged.


What on earth was wrong with him?


Had Lainey's nonsense rubbed off on him?


The words were so vile they made her skin crawl.


She opened her mouth to speak, but Jonny beat her to it. "Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Meet me there,and we'll straighten things out. If you show up, I'lI even pretend your little affair never happened."


The thought of Eleanor with another man made his blood boil.


She might have been his ex-wife, but in his mind,she still belonged to him.


Every word dripped with entitlement, and Eleanor caught the hidden meaning instantly. Her thumb hovered over the hang-up button, but instead of ending the call, she shifted course.


"Fine," she replied flatly, and without giving him the chance to reply, she disconnected.


If Jonny wanted to make her sick, she would gladly return the favor.


Amused by the idea, she fired off a quick message to her apprentice. "Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Give my ex-husband a surprise he won't forget."


In a twisted way, it was almost an act of kindness.At least, Jonny would have his physical needs  satisfied.
###Chapter 26 You Shouldn't Stay Up For Me Tonight
Jonny had no clue about the surprise Eleanor was preparing for him.


He reached for the suit jacket draped neatly on the chair, then rose to his feet to leave.


Noticing his movements, Lainey quickly pushed herself up from the sofa. "Jonny, where are you off to?"



A slight pause followed before Jonny spoke with a perfectly straight face. "Something urgent came up at the office. I have to go back and deal with it. You shouldn't stay up for me tonight."


The idea of an emergency that required him to stay out all night didn't make sense.


Suspicion flickered in Lainey's eyes, and she was ready to confront him, but he slipped out the door  before she could say anything.


Sinking down onto the sofa, she absentmindedly twisted the hem of her shirt between her fingers.A feeling of unease settled over her.


Jonny never behaved this way. Unless...


As soon as that possibility crept into her mind,Lainey's fingernails pressed hard into her palms.


She could not let that be true. If it was, she might just kill him herself. There was no way she was letting go of the Todd legacy.


Thirty minutes ticked by before Jonny arrived outside Room 888 at the Lumina Hotel.



A rush of excitement buzzed through him from head to toe.



That image of Eleanor from the club, lookingSO inviting, stayed vivid in his thoughts.


Three years had passed, and he had almost lost control more than once. Now, Jonny actually wished  he hadn't held back all this time.



Tonight, nothing would stop him from finally having what he wanted with her.



Thinking about it, Jonny could hardly keep his cool while pushing open the hotel room door.


A faint shape could be seen on the bed. Curves and bare skin were outlined by the thin, suggestive fabric she wore.



Jonny couldn't help feeling amazed that someone he thought was so boring could turn out to be this bold.


Missing out for three years really stung now that he saw what she had to offer.


He moved closer, only for an unusual, thick perfume to catch him off guard.



It took less than a minute before his head started spinning and the world around him became a blur.


Sounds turned fuzzy, and he barely recognized a voice speaking nearby.  Coherent thought quickly faded, leaving him overwhelmed by instinct and want.


Sunrise found Jonny waking with a sense of satisfaction.


The sheets next to him were cold, and Eleanor was nowhere to be found.


Puzzled, Jonny wondered what kind of stunt she was pulling now.


Flashes of last night flickered in his mind, and though everything felt cloudy, he remembered having a great time.


If this was her new tactic, he figured he might keep her around for a while, at least until he grew tired of her and could toss her aside without a second thought.


Right then, his phone buzzed unexpectedly with a new message.


As he tapped the screen, Jonny's hand shook so badly he almost dropped the phone. Confusion  swept over him. Since when had he ended up in bed with a lifelike doll?


Still reeling, he stared at the screen as another message appeared. "How do you like my surprise,dear ex-husband?"


He froze in disbelief. Could it be that Eleanor had never been there last night, and he had actually spent the night with a realistic doll?


The truth hit Jonny, and panic scattered his thoughts.


He lurched out of bed, grabbed the phone, and called the front desk. "Show me last night's hallway footage from outside Room 888.Right away."


"Of course, Mr. Todd."


Authority had its perks. Jonny might not control the whole city, but as CEO, his requests always got top priority at the Lumina Hotel.


Only a few minutes passed before the footage arrived in his inbox.  Jonny scrolled quickly, his nerves fraying as he scanned every second. There was no sign of Eleanor anywhere.


Instead, what he saw was a cleaner with a covered cart, entering before he ever showed up.


That had to be when the doll was delivered.


Embarrassment and fury boiled inside Jonny.


He cursed Eleanor for tricking him so easily, and the possibility of leaked photos made his skin crawl.


As the CEO of Todd Group, he could never live this down if the story got out.


Gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles turned white, Jonny could hardly contain his rage.


He hammered out a message. "Eleanor, erase every picture. Come here now, or you'll regret crossing me!"



He then sent it.


An angry red exclamation mark flashed on the screen  a moment later.


Fury almost made him snap his phone in half.


Had she really blocked him?


For three years, that woman had chased after him,and now she shut him out completely?


Admitting the truth to himself, Jonny knew he felt rattled.



Yet what he did not realize was that things could,and would,get even worse.


Nothing he had experienced so far compared to the humiliation waiting for him next.
###Chapter 27 You Should Keep Your Distance
No one in Elepdon's high society held as much influence as Nolan. His network of contacts stretched wider than anyone else's.



Only a few minutes after Jonny watched the security video,one of Nolan's sources brought him the news.


Impressed and amused, Nolan considered how bold the move had been.


Pulling off such a stunt took real nerve.


Jonny must be out of his mind if he still planned to chase after Eleanor.



Clearly,Jonny needed to be taught a lesson.


Nolan gave a quiet order. "Tell the shareholders to put the squeeze on Jonny. We need to keep him busy." By doing this, Nolan ensured Jonny would be too occupied to bother Eleanor anymore.


"Understood, Mr. Stewart," Erick repliedright away before stepping out.


Left by himself, Nolan quickly sent Eleanor a message, curiosity clear in his tone. "That was quite a spectacle. I enjoyed every minute."


Meanwhile, Eleanor sat at the bar, staring at the message with mixed feelings.


Nolan's reputation for gathering secrets was no exaggeration.


Still, he seemed to have far too much time on his hands.



Why was he so invested in her life?


Was this interest personal, or did he have another motive?


She was inclined to believe the latter.


She wasn't narcissistic. A handful of encounters with Nolan hardly counted as anything meaningful between them.


No matter how she thought about it, Eleanor saw nothing in herself that would catch Nolan's attention.


The whole thing was a puzzle.


Curiosity got the best of Lillian when she noticed Eleanor staring off into space.


Glancing at the screen, Lillian let out a dramatic gasp. "Since when did you and Mr. Stewart getSO close? Girl, you're playing with fire. That's not a man you want to get involved with!"


Without wanting to leave her friend confused,Eleanor went ahead and explained what Jonny had pulled off.


Every word made Lillian angrier, her cheeks flushed bright red as she slammed her foot down on the little table in front of them.



"What a dirtbag! How can people like him keep popping up? Why does he always have to mess up your peace?" Lillian seethed.


A long sigh followed her outburst, but then Lillian's eyes grew wide with a new realization. "Hold up. How did Nolan get the scoop so fast? Don't tell me he's been tracking your every move!"


Worry crept into her voice. "That's a scary thought,Eleanor! Never mind how handsome Nolan is or how everyone calls him the catch of the city. You should keep your distance. People say he can't... you know."


That reputation for keeping to himself? In Lillian's mind, it was just his way of hiding his so-called problem.


As the last word left her lips, Lillian gave it an extra flourish,and Eleanor nearly spit out her drink.


Eleanor could not believe that rumor.



If anything, Nolan never struck her as someone with that kind of secret.


Before Lillian could launch into another rant, Eleanor chimed in, "Calm down. There's nothing going on between me and him. We've hardly talked at all. He probably just stumbled on something and decided to send that message."


The words finally got Lillian to quiet down, but the more she mulled it over, the weirder the situation seemed.



No explanation made sense.


Why would someone as busy as Nolan, a man at the top of Elepdon's business world, waste time poking into Eleanor's affairs?


As questions piled up in her mind, Lillian glanced at Eleanor's steady face and bit her tongue.


Best to let it go.


If she kept asking, maybe Eleanor would start thinking about Nolan for real.


Absolutely not!


It would be wiser if nothing was said about it.


Men only caused headaches anyway! Still, Lillian was never one to keep her worries bottled up.


Later, once she got home, she let it all out to Ryland.


Since Ryland and Nolan were friends, maybe he could step in.


Ryland noticed the frustration written all over Lillian's face and gave her a gentle pat on the head. "That's enough. Stop fussing. Nolan's choices aren't for us to question. If he does have a crush on your friend,there's really nothing we can do."


He added, "With the difference in their social standing, even if they did like each other, being together would be nearly impossible."


Lillian's temper flared. "Hold on, what's that supposed to mean? You obviously don't know Eleanor.She's..."



She was Enigma!


Her mouth snapped shut just before she blurted out too much, determined not to reveal Eleanor's secret. She pressed her teeth against her lip in defiance."Regardless of what you think, Eleanor is wonderful,and you have no right to speak of her that way. Tell Nolan he had better forget about entertaining any thoughts of Eleanor."


If Nolan truly ended up with Eleanor, wouldn't that mean she would be trapped in a lifetime of loneliness beside a man who could never satisfy her? The thought alone felt unbearably cruel.


Ryland picked up on his sister's stubbornness right away and raised his hands in defeat. "Alright, alright,your friend is the best. Satisfied? I've got things to take care of, so I'm out of here."


With those words, he hurried off.


Arguing with women was always a losing game.


If he couldn't win the battle, he might as well make a quick retreat!
###Chapter 28 Make Her Stay!





Jonny didn't see his problem as serious, but the irritation it caused was undeniable.


He had waited for days, expecting Eleanor to eventually cave.


Given their past, he was even prepared to let everything slide if she simply returned to the Todd household and resumed her role there.


But no matter how much time passed, she stayed silent.


Another message was sent, and once again the only reply was that mocking little exclamation mark.


Fury burned hot enough that he nearly hurled his phone across the room, when suddenly the ringtone shattered the quiet.


Hope surged instantly. He convinced himself Eleanor had finally come around, that she was ready to apologize and plead with him.


Snatching up the phone, he answered without hesitation. "Eleanor? Finally realized your mistake?Well, it's too late for regrets now. I'm warning you-be ready for me tonight. Wash up and wait, or you can forget about me forgiving you."


A pause lingered on the line, heavy with hesitation.


At last, Allard's guarded voice broke through. "Mr.Todd, it's me. Mr. Rayne and the other shareholders... they're all talking about pulling out their investments. What should we do?"


Jonny shot up from the sofa, rage flaring like fire.


Damn it!



Those decrepit cowards!


They actually had the nerve to bring up withdrawing now?



He would love to see how they thought they would survive without the Todd Group backing them.


The company was already listed, the road ahead nothing but clear skies.


If they were foolish enough to walk away, they would only be throwing away effortless pofits.


Unless they had all gone mad, they would be crawling back before long.



Jonny snatched a jacket with a storm cloud hanging over his face and made straight for the door.


The moment he yanked it open, he nearly collided with Lainey, who stepped out from the kitchen.


"Jonny, I made this soup for you. I've been working on it all afternoon. Will you please taste it?" Her hands trembled slightly as she offered the bowl, her eyes searching his.



One glance at her only deepened his irritation.


If not for her, would the company be staring down this disaster? Since moving in, she had been more of a nuisance than anything-poking into his schedule, meddling where she didn't belong.


He was long past tired of it.


He started to push past her, but then he caught the shimmer of tears forming in her eyes.


For a second, he faltered.


She had been the woman he once swore he loved.


Maybe he could humor her,just this once.


With clear reluctance, Jonny reached out and accepted the bowl.


The heat seeped into his palms, and the fragrance rising from it was at least tolerable.


He blew across the surface, then forced down a cautious sip.


The taste hit him like a slap.


Greasy and flat-there wasn't a hint of seasoning, not even the faintest flavor to mask the mess.


It felt as though Lainey had dumped unwashed ingredients straight into boiling water and called it soup.


The memory of Eleanor's soups-rich, fragrant, and layered with care-only made this concoction seem even more pitiful.


Drained of patience, Jonny let his frustration spill out. "From now on, leave the cooking to the servants.You've already stirred up enough trouble. The shareholders are restless because of you, and I've got bigger things to handle."


Without another glance, he brushed past her and stepped out the door.


Never before had his words to her cut this deep.


Lainey's eyes blurred with tears as she turned toward Vickie in the living room. Her voice cracked as she sobbed, "Vickie, it's my fault... I shouldn't even be here.Maybe I should just leave." Her shoulders trembled, her whole figure carrying the weight of grievance.


Vickie, caught off guard by Jonny's sudden cruelty,sat frozen.



She couldn't reconcile this coldness with her son who had once doted on Lainey. Could it be...he had already set his sights on someone new?


Before Vickie could sort out her thoughts, Emma shot up from the sofa in alarm.



Emma said, "Lainey, you can't leave! If you walk away now, that shameless Eleanor will swoop right back in to steal Jonny!"



Turning to Vickie, she said, "Mom, say something-make her stay!"



The moment Eleanor's name was spoken, Vickie's hesitation vanished.



To her, Eleanor was a stain that clung no matter how hard she tried to wash it away. Compared to that nuisance, Lainey seemed far more acceptable.



Vickie hurried forward and clasped Lainey's hand.Her voice softened as she muttered,"DDon't let Jonny's temper scare you. He's just stressed from work, that's all. He doesn't mean to be cruel. You've got me on your side, so stay here and be at ease.Once the company calms down, you and Jonny can finaly marry."



A flicker of satisfaction flashed across Lainey's eyes,though she quickly masked it beneath a meek expression.



She lowered her head and leaned against Vickie with a practiced gentleness. "Vickie, you're too good to me. When I marry into this family, I'Il devote myself to treating you with respect and care."


She knew well enough how men were-always chasing the new while neglecting the old.


But with Vickie in her corner, she had nothing to fear.The title of Jonny's wife was already within her grasp.
###Chapter 29 The Plan Is Workable.


Jonny stepped into the Todd Group headquarters looking worn down, his jaw shadowed with unshaven stubble.

Several sleepless nights had left him drained, dark circles etched heavily beneath his eyes.

HHis suit jacket hung limply over one arm, his tie was nowhere to be seen, and the open collar of his shirt made his entire appearance seem ragged and burdened.

Employees trickling out after work caught sight of him and quickly lowered their heads, slipping past in silence as though afraid of provoking his temper.

Rather than head straight to the conference room, Jonny made his way into his private office.

He sank heavily into the leather chair, eyes shutting in helpless frustration.

"Allard, how's the assignment I gave you coming along?" he asked without opening them.

The rejection from the Stewart Group and several other major firms had forced Jonny to shift to a different approach.

This time, his strategy was to draw smaller companies into the fold.

Though these firms could contribute only limited amounts, mere tens of millions each, together their backing might be enough to breathe life into the Usepsall project.

By offering them attractive incentives, the Todd Group could still make the deal worthwhile.

Allard, waiting patiently at his side, responded quickly, "Mr. Todd, the plan is workable. More than ten small firms have already expressed interest. Still, the terms of cooperation will need your approval. I've arranged for you to meet with them tomorrow at three o'clock at the Lumina Hotel."

At last, Jonny reacted. His bloodshot eyes opened slowly, and he gave a weary nod of acknowledgment.

Finally, a sliver of good news had arrived. As long as money kept moving, the Todd Group still had a chance to survive.

Jonny was just beginning to ease his tension when he caught sight of Allard lingering with an uneasy look.

"What is it? Out with it," Jonny insisted.

At the sharp prompt, Allard's shoulders stiffened.

He cleared his throat, struggling to line up his words before speaking.

The issue could have been trivial, but his gut told him it was anything but.

Mustering his nerve, he delivered the message. "Enigma's assistant announced this morning that they're preparing to establish a firm named Enigma Group in Vladena and have already begun reaching out for bids."

The meaning was clear-those smaller investment firms might turn away from the Todd Group and throw their support behind Enigma Group instead.

A deep frown carved across Jonny's face.

Enigma? The name sparked a vague memory, tied to whispers of an elusive figure in the design world.

Within the industry, Enigma's reputation ranked at the very top, yet nobody knew whether this talent was man or woman,young or old.

The only detail anyone knew about this designer was the name-Enigma.

Once a year, without fail, Enigma released exactly ten designs. They were fixed drafts, never revised or altered.

Their distinct style and visionary concepts turned each piece into a masterpiece, drawing in fashion elites around the globe who were willing to pay staggering prices.

But hadn't Enigma only been selling design sketches these last three years? Why suddenly take the leap into forming a company?

Even so, Jonny felt little concern.

Exceptional talent in design did not mean the same in business.

A brand-new enterprise could hardly compare to the Todd Group, which was already listed.

Besides, he had given enough incentives in the Usepsall project.

Unless those company leaders had taken leave of their senses, they would know where their best choice lay.

With that thought, the darkness clouding his expression lifted. He gave Allard a brisk directive. "Clear out those old men in the conference room. Tell them funding is already secured. If they want to dump their shares or back out, let them. They can't use that to pressure me. And if they want to stay on as shareholders of the Todd Group, they'd better fall in line." Though unease twisted in his gut, Allard bowed quickly. "Understood, Mr. Todd."
###Chapter 30 Should We Consider Investing


The unrest shaking Jonny's shareholders hadn't happened naturally-it had been carefully seeded by Nolan working behind the curtain.

In the end, whether those shares were dumped or held tightly, the choice was Nolan's to make.

His long fingers drummed lightly on the table before he turned to Erick and spoke in a low command."Buy out half of the shareholders. Leave the rest where they are. I'll need them to keep making noise inside the Todd Group."

Chaos within the company was a weapon he intended to use again.

And there was the personal angle-Jonny had once been Eleanor's husband.

That tie alone guaranteed Nolan would never truly let Jonny walk free of his shadlow.

How far the storm went would depend entirely on Jonny's own moves. If he kept blundering, he would be digging his own grave.

Once Erick left to handle the task, Nolan did what he always did-he reached for his phone and sent Eleanor a message. "I may have a gift for you soon."

The power to flip control of the Todd Group like it was nothing more than a chess piece-that was a gift with real weight.

If Jonny ever dared to push Eleanor past her limit, Nolan would hand those very shares to her without a second thought.

Of course, he didn't put any of that in writing.

Mystery was part of his armor, and he wore it well.

On the other end, Eleanor stared at the message, puzzled by its meaning. Her pen stilled on the page, and she absently pressed the tip against her lip.

Nolan, she decided, had far too much time on his hands, and with that thought dismissed, she bent over her sketch again.

With the launch of Enigma Group so close, she needed designs that could turn heads and pull in investors.

Without those funds, making a bold move would be impossible.

So what mattered now? The work in front of her, not some man.

By the next day, Nolan still hadn't received a reply from Eleanor.

Yet irritation never crossed his face.

Patience, after all, was part of the game. In time, he would succeed in peeling back every layer of Eleanor until her true self was laid bare.

The very idea tugged a smile to his lips, one he struggled to suppress.

Ryland, standing nearby, shuddered. "Nolan, for God's sake, stop smiling like that. It's creepy!"

Seeing a man with a reputation for cold indifference suddenly wearing a tender smile was enough to send chills down anyone's spine.

Nolan shot Ryland a cold look. "Too much free time? I've got a project in some remote corner of the map you might want to handle..."

"Hold it, stop right there!" Ryland cut inimmediately, waving his hands. "I was only joking!"

Nolan's words made his scalp prickle.

Who in their right mind would want to work in some remote corner of the map?

Certainly not the CEO of Brooks Group.

Only Nolan kept insisting those far-flung sites were worth attention, trying to rope him into going.

No chance-he wasn't taking the bait. "Actually, I just remembered I've got urgent business," Ryland blurted, backing toward the door. "I'll leave you to your smiling. Enjoy."

As Ryland slipped out, Erick returned and stopped before Nolan. "Mr. Stewart, everything's been taken care of. But there's one matter that needs your decision. Enigma Group in Vladena has just sent us their proposal.Should we consider investing?"

The Stewart Group's investment team was known for its precision and skill.

Ordinarily, no project reached Nolan's desk until it had gone through their full evaluation.

But Enigma Group wasn't an ordinary case. Its reputation alone gave it weight.

The risk was clear-by the time the usual assessments were finished, Enigma Group might no longer need outside capital.

Letting such a profitable opportunity slip away would be a mistake Stewart Group couldn't afford.

On top of that, Enigma Group stood as a direct rival to the Todd Group.

If Stewart Group poured money into Enigma Group, the announcement itself could shake Todd Group's foundation before the real fight even began.

Erick leaned on that final point, making sure it landed.

Nolan's gaze sharpened, a faint gleam of amusement breaking through his cool exterior. "Invest. And don't stop there-secure the position of largest shareholder."

He wanted to see if Jonny would have the strength left to keep pestering Eleanor once the tide turned.

And with that, Eleanor would end up owing him another debt-whether she realized it or not.
###Chapter 31| Just Live Off Allowances
With Stewart Group backing them and their own prestige already established, it was almost inevitable that investors would pour into Enigma Group.
Barely two days later, the company made headlines with a bold announcement-its grand launch would include exclusive counters opening in three major cities.
When opening day arrived, Vladena practically overflowed with socialites and celebrities who had flown in from everywhere, joined by a handful of international stars.

This was, after all, Enigma's stage to shine.
For the elite in attendance, even catching the company's attention meant securing access to their coveted designs.
And to be seen in an Enigma gown was a guarantee of success-spotlights would follow them without effort.Naturally, any star who could clear their schedule was present.

But to everyone's surprise, the mysterious Enigma was absent from the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Across town, in a private room of an upscale club in Vladena, Lillian scrolled lazily through the coverage on her tablet. Her playful eyes flicked up and landed on Eleanor, who sat sipping coffee as if none of it concerned her.

Leaning closer with a grin, Lillian teased,"Imagine if they found out the real Enigma was sitting right here.Do you think they'd storm the club just to catch a glimpse of you?"
Typical Lillian-always joking,always stirring.
Eleanor didn't bother with a reply. Instead, she plucked a slice of watermelon from the plate and neatly popped it into Lillian's talkative mouth.
Lillian, her cheeks bulging with watermelon, let out a muffled laugh before dropping back onto the sofa. "Eleanor, I heard ever since the Stewart Group invested, investors have been pulling out of Todd Group and pouring their money into Enigma Group instead. Even some of Todd's oldest shareholders jumped ship. Can you imagine Jonny's face when he found out?"
Eleanor lifted her cup with calm fingers, blew gently across the surface, and answered without a flicker of emotion, "Probably. He's always been far too arrogant for his own good."
That kind of response was exactly what Lillian had expected.
Eleanor didn't care about Todd Group anymore.
The thought of it made Lillian snicker, her eyes shining with mischief. "It's hilarious, really. If Jonny ever realizes that you're Enigma, he'll lose his mind!"

Lose his mind was putting it lightly-he would tear himself apart with regret.
Todd Group was crumbling. Projects were stalled, cash flow was drying up, and their stock price was in free fall.

Bankruptcy was circling closer every day.
To Lillian, it was nothing less than poetic justice for the way he had tossed Eleanor aside.
Eleanor only tilted her lips into the faintest smile, offering no reply.
Their eyes met and they shared a quiet understanding. They raised their cups in a soft, unspoken toast.

After a few sips, Lillian suddenly set her glass down with a sharp clap, smacked her forehead, and bounced to her feet.
"Wait a second, Eleanor-that's not fair at all! Starting a company sounds like the most fun in the world, and you didn't even invite me?" She took a quick step closer, casped her hands together with exaggerated pleading, and blinked up at her.,tell me honestly-do I have any chance of becoming a shareholder in your company now?"
Eleanor arched a brow, clearly entertained by Lillian's dramatics.tiny company is suddenly worthy of your grand interest?" Lillian flopped back into her seat, but this time her voice lost its playful lilt, carrying a thread of sincerity. "Of course it is. My brother's the one running Brooks Group. I just live off allowances. I've always dreamed of having something of my own... but, well-"

Business had never been her strength.

She had tried more than once to start something, but every effort ended in collapse, leaving her with nothing but the reputation of a carefree socialite.

Unlike her, Eleanor's career only seemed to climb higher.

And with Lillian speaking so openly, Eleanor saw no reason to push her away. A small smile touched her lips."Fine, fine. Consider it done."
###Chapter 32 We Are Enemies!
Inside Todd Group's office, Jonny glared down at the empty investor list Allard had delivered.
Rage boiled over, and in one violent sweep Jonny sent everything on his desk crashing to the floor.
"That damn Enigma! From this day on, we are enemies!"
His fury only grew as his thoughts spiraled.
Those spineless investors-switching sides at the last second.
All because of Enigma.
How could they value some faceless designer above Todd Group's legacy?
The very idea was absurd!
Jonny's chest rose and fell in uneven bursts, his face darkening as his fists clenched so hard the sound of his bones straining filled the office.
Was the entire world plotting against him?
No-he would never accept that.
He would not lose. Not like this.

In a sudden motion, he turned to Allard, his eyes wild with resolve. "Send word immediately-we're willing to give up half of the agency rights for the Usepsall project. Anyone serious about negotiating can come to the table."
It was a desperate gamble, but he convinced himself it was enough. With bait like that, someone had to bite.The Usepsall project was hailed as one of Elepdon's brightest prospects in years. Even a fragment of it could raise a modest company to the level of a public listing. With bait that tempting, investors were bound to circle.

"But..." Allard hesitated, his words dragging before he forced them out. "You already promised forty percent of the agency rights to Lainey..."

Jonny's voice sliced through the air before he could finish. "Take it back."

Nothing outweighed the survival of Todd Group. Not even Lainey. He would smooth things over with her later, one way or another.

Allard, sensing the finality in his tone, gave a quick nod.

Jonny's personal matters weren't his concern.

All he wanted was for Todd Group to endure a little longer-long enough for him to reach retirement without disaster looming over his head.

The situation looked grim.

At the current pace, Todd Group might not survive another six months.

What value did the Usepsall project hold if the company collapsed before it bore fruit?

Without Eleanor, the fall of Todd Group felt inevitable.

Lainey brought nothing to the table, and Jonny himself was stumbling blindly. The sharpest directors had already cashed out their shares and walked away.

Allard could only sigh-better to take things one day at a time.

Even with a sliver of hope, Jonny's mood stayed dark.

He slumped into his chair, pressing his fingers to his temples as if he could knead away the pressure building in his skull.

In his haze, he caught the faint sight of steam rising from a bowl of soup placed neatly on the desk.

In front of it, Eleanor's face appeared, her usually steady eyes soft wvith quiet admiration. Jonny blinked hard, straining to see her more clearly.
But in the next instant, both the bowl and Eleanor's figure vanished like smoke, leaving only the empty desk.What was wrong with him? Why did Eleanor keep invading his thoughts when he least expected it?
With a harsh shake of his head, Jonny tried to drive her image away, as though erasing her could steady him again.
Still,Colby's words echoed like a curse he couldn't silence.
Was it possible Todd Group truly couldn't survive without Eleanor?
The thought sounded ridiculous.
And yet, he couldn't deny the truth. When she was by his side, no matter what storm hit the company, they had always managed to pull through at the last possible moment.
With Eleanor's steady hand, the company stayed afloat, and his personal life ran like clockwork. Everything was in order, leaving him free of worry.
A knot tightened in his chest, strange and unwelcome.
Enough,he told himself-there was no use dwelling on the past.
The only thing that mattered now was shoring up the company.
Once that was done, he could go to Eleanor.
She had adored him for years, lowering herself time and again.
She wouldn't simply turn cold overnight.
He only needed to reach out, tosoften his tone, to make amends.
Eleanor's anger now? He dismissed it as jealousy. Of course she would be upset-he was living with Lainey.
But wasn't that proof of how much she still cared? He convinced himself it would take little more than gentle coaxing to draw Eleanor back.
###Chapter 33 Hope House Will Always Be Your Home


Had Eleanor been able to hear Jonny's thoughts, her hand would have flown across his face without a second's hesitation.

Such bloated self-importance was enough to make anyone sick.

Right now, Eleanor's heart was set only on the orphanage, leaving no room for any news about Jonny.

Hope House stood in the heart of the old district, its walls chipped and faded, yet steeped in the kind of memories time could never erase.

Eleanor knew every creak of its doors, every worn step on the stone path. She pushed her way inside, her arms laden with bags filled with fruit and toys.

The moment her figure appeared, a wave of excited voices broke out. Small feet pounded against the floor as the children rushed toward her like a tide:

"Eleanor,you came back!"

"Eleanor, what surprises did you bring us today?"

"Are we playing puzzles again? You promised last time!"

She crouched down with a smile, her hand reaching out to ruffle their little heads one by one. "Of course l will."

Her words sent them squealing with delight. In an instant, they scattered, eager to dig out the puzzles and games they had prepared for her return.

From inside the building, the sound of laughter drew out the old director. Myah Sutton stepped into the doorway,her weathered face softening. "You've come home, my dear."

Her voice wrapped around Eleanor like a thread, tugging her straight back into the tender days of her own childhood. For as long as Eleanor could remember, Myah had been a steady presence in her life-the gentlest soul in a world that had often felt unkind.
Marriage had never been part of Myah's story, and though her hair had long since turned silver, she chose to remain at Hope House, devoting her days to the children who needed her most.
In Eleanor's heart, this selfless woman had long ago taken the place of a mother.
Hope House wasn't just a shelter-it was where her memories began, the only place she truly called home.
Swallowing the lump rising in her throat, Eleanor forced her lips intoa bright smile as she stepped closer."Yes, I've come back."
Myah opened her arms and pulled her into a gentle embrace, her voice tender and steady. "These past three years must have been hard on you. But listen to me-whenever the world feels heavy, you come back here.Hope House will always be your home."

From the moment Eleanor was little, her maturity had cut deep into Myah's heart, a child far too sensible for her age.
She knew bits and pieces about Eleanor's struggles with the Todd family and prayed silently that the girl wouldn't have to carry more pain.

Eleanor's nose stung, her eyes brimming despite her effort to hold steady.

With a trembling smile, she managed to say, "Myah, I'm alright. Truly. You don't have to worry about me. Tell me-how have you been? The same as always?"

Eleanor had already made up her mind-Myah had carried enough worry for her over the years. She refused to add more weight to those shoulders. Whatever had hurt her belonged to the past.

At Eleanor's words, Myah chuckled softly, giving her lower back a playful pat. "Just the usual aches of an old woman, nothing that will stop me. Now hurry along-the kitchen made your favorite dish today."

Lifting the fruit she carried, Eleanor winked mischievously. "You go ahead. I'll wash these in the backyard
first. Otherwise, those little troublemakers will pounce on me before I even step inside."  Their laughter mingled in the air before they parted ways. Eleanor carried the basket to the backyard, rolled up her sleeves with practiced ease, and set the fruit under the faucet, the water sparkling in the afternoon sun.
Out of the corner of her eye, movement caught her attention-a girl, no older than sixteen, crouched near the wall with a much younger child at her side. Both seemed preoccupied, heads bent low over something unseen.

The older one's face was unfamiliar. Eleanor was certain she hadn't seen her during her last visit.
So, she thought, this must be a new arrival.
Once the fruit was rinsed clean, Eleanor walked toward them, her tone gentle."Hey, it's too hot out here.Why don't you two go inside and play? Be careful, or you'll end up with heatstroke."
The older girl lifted her head at last.

Her face was startlingly pale, drained of color in a way that seemed unnatural.
A flicker of unease stirred in Eleanor's chest-something wasn't right about that complexion.
The girl wavered unsteadily, her legs trembling as she tried to push herself upright. She gestured weakly toward the scattered sticks and torn scraps of colored paper at her feet.
"Don't worry. I'm alright. The kite snapped, and I was just helping my little friend mend it. We'll have it flying again soon," she replied.

Her words carried reassurance, but her body betrayed her. Each attempt to steady herself only made the swaying more obvious.

Then, without warning, her knees buckled. She lost her balance.
###Chapter 34 Fannie And Nolan Are Really Kind!


Eleanor's eyes sharpened as she lunged forward, managing to catch the woman before her fragile body hit the ground. The weight in her arms was shockingly light.

How could anyone be this thin?

The younger child standing nearby let out a frightened gasp and hurried over. "Fannie! Fannie, talk to me!Are you hurt?"

There was no time to reassure her. Eleanor focused on Fannie Stewart, scanning her condition with practiced urgency.

Well... Something was clearly off with the girl's health.

But worrying about long-term issues could wait. For now, Eleanor needed to wake her and keep the oxygen flowing.

If she didn't act quickly, the damage could be permanent.

Acting without hesitation, she pulled a silver from her kit and pressed it against Fannie's thumb.

Within moments, Fannie's eyelids fluttered and life slowly returned to her face.

Eleanor slipped the tool away and released a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "Hey, you're awake.How do you feel? You shouldn't be out here in this condition. Come inside with me."

She bent down, ready to help Fannie to her feet, when a tall shadow closed the distance toward them.

"Fannie!"

It was Nolan!

Eleanor stiffened at once, her body tense as if she had been caught doing something wrong. Every part of her wanted to retreat. Foints demost Her instincts warned her to keep her distance.

Only then did it hit her-the frail woman in her arms was none other than his sister.

It made sense. No one else could stir that level of panic in Nolan, and no other woman around that age came to mind.

"I'fl let you take care of her, Mr. Stewart." Eleanor spoke calmly, guiding the younger child's hand as she prepared to leave.

Nolan's brows tightened, and his piercing stare locked onto her.

Even in that fleeting moment, he had noticed. That skillful maneuver hadn't come from an amateur.Eleanor possessed real medical training.
His thoughts flickered back to David's recent exhibition. Whispers had spread that the legendary Soul Surgeon would appear.

But when the event ended, the only unforgettable figure had been Eleanor, dazzling and mysterious-and the Soul Surgeon had remained unseen.
Doctors from all over the world had spent years trying to treat Fannie, yet none of them could find a cure.Now, with a single intervention, Eleanor had managed to save her life.
That alone made Nolan's instincts flare. Nothing about this seemed ordinary.
He cut across her path before she could slip away. "Hold on. Since when do you know medicine, Miss Warren?"

Eleanor froze in place.
Turning back slowly, she forced a light smile. "Come on, Mr. Stewart, surely you've heard.I graduated from Northbridge University with two majors. One of them was clinical medicine, and I do hold a medical license."She wasn't lying-every word of that was true.
The diploma bore Northbridge University's seal, and the license was official. Nolan's eyes narrowed, sharp and unrelenting, though he chose silence over argument.

Before he could press further, Fannie's soft voice broke in. "Miss Warren, thank you for helping me. My brother was just scared for me. He didn't mean to sound harsh."

Eleanor wanted to believe Fannie, but Nolan's penetrating stare told another story. His gaze searched her face as if peeling back layers she hadn't intended to reveal, and it was far more unsettling than she cared to admit.

She bit back her frustration. Picking a fight with him was out of the question, but keeping her distance should still be possible.

Even so, why on earth was Nolan showing up at Hope House with his sister?

The child in her arms tugged gently at her sleeve and spoke in a bright tone. "Eleanor, you've got it wrong.Fannie and Nolan are really kind! Nolan's been bringing us gifts for years, and Myah always says he's nice."

Eleanor nearly laughed at the absurdity of it.

Was this some kind of joke?

Nolan, the ruthless powerhouse who dominated the business world with no mercy, was the same man these children praised as generous and good-hearted?
###Chapter 35 You Actually Calling Me


By the look on Eleanor's face, Nolan already knew what was running through her mind.

He lowered himself in front of the child and said in a teasing tone, "Sweetheart, thank you for stepping in for me. Otherwise, someone might've thought the worst of me."

Eleanor pressed her lips tight and stayed silent.

That sharp tongue of his never failed.

Everyone, carrying their own thoughts, walked Fannie back to the house just as dinner was about to be served.

Myah had made sure to save them a table while the rest of the seats were already full.

Once the fruit had been handed out, Eleanor sat beside Nolan.

The day had clearly turned against her, since running into him felt like pure bad luck.

She swore she would ask Myah about his visits before showing up next time.

Still, life rarely went the way she planned.

While they ate, Fannie looked at Eleanor with eager eyes. "Eleanor, can I come with you to the orphanage next time?"

She absolutely adored Eleanor.

Because of her poor health since childhood, she had grown up with very few friends.

Even as a Stewart, she could always sense disdain behind people's smiles.

Eleanor, however, was unlike the rest. Just earlier,she had seen it for herself-those eyes held only kindness,  never judgment. Worried Eleanor might turn her down, Fannie quickly caught her hand and shook it eagerly. "Please,Eleanor.Say yes!"

As she met a gazé as puré as a child's, Eleanor found it hard to turn her away.

Eventually Eleanor gave in. "Alright."

Nolan arched his brows, cutting in smoothly."Fannie, you're not in the best shape. I'll come along next time too."

His eyes then shifted upward, fastening on Eleanor as if she had suddenly become far too obedient. "You don't object, do you,Miss Warren?"

It sounded less like a question and more like a decision already made.

For Fannie's sake, Eleanor swallowed her pride and chose to endure.

The very idea of seeing Nolan's cold expression week after week sent prickles across her scalp.

She forced a stiff smile and replied, "Of course. It would be my privilege to have you join us."

Her tone, though polite, carried a thin edge of mockery.

Nolan's lips lifted in the faintest smile.

His long fingers reached for the shared fork, carefully placing a slice of braised beef onto Eleanor's plate.

The gesture caught her completely off guard.

What exactly was that supposed to mean?

A peace offering?

Or some kind of test?

Still, with so many eyes watching, she had no choice but to lower her gaze and quietly eat what was in front of her.

The food lost its flavor completely. Even so, Eleanor stuck to her disciplined habits, finishing every bite-including the braised beef Nolan had served her.

When dinner ended, Fannie tugged eagerly at Eleanor's hand and pulled her outside to the yard, her laughter mingling with that of the other children.

The cheerful voices rang through the air.

From the porch, Nolan stood motionless, his eyes following Eleanor and Fannie in the distance.

A phone appeared in his hand, and he dialed a number.

"Well, well. Nolan, you actually calling me?" Ryland's voice drawled with teasing amusement on the other end.

Nolan ignored the banter, his tone cutting straight to the point. "Find out where Eleanor graduated from."

A moment of silence followed before Ryland spoke again, caught off guard. "That's all?"

He had been expecting something far more dramatic.

But if it came down to gathering information, Nolan couldn't have asked a better man.

"There's no need to dig around. I already know the answer," Ryland responded.
###Chapter 36 You'll Move In Tomorrow


Ryland spoke with obvious pride. "Eleanor used to share a dorm with Lillian in college. They both mnajored in finance at Northbridge University. But Lillian always said Eleanor was different-she even took clinical medicine as a minor. A total genius! Honestly, her kids are going to have some top-tier genes."

That final line carried more weight than casual praise.

Eleanor's family name might not be impressive, but if Nolan was serious about her, it wasn't outside the realm of possibility. After all, wealthy families had never been strangers to illegitimate heirs.

The call ended without warning, cut off cleanly.

Ryland blinked at his screen,baffled.

Did Nolan actually just hang up on him?

Unbelievable.

Infuriating,even.

Meanwhile, Nolan-the one being cursed in silence-let a sharp gleam flash in his eyes.

Two degrees, one in finance and one in clinical medicine, both from Northbridge University. With credentials like that, Eleanor's display of skill earlier suddenly made perfect sense.

Still, Nolan couldn't shake the sense that something about her didn't add up.

It didn't matter. Time had a way of revealing secrets, and sooner or later Eleanor's little secrets would show themselves.

While he entertained those thoughts, Eleanor busied herself with the children, helping clear the table before bidding Myah a warm goodbye.

Fannie quickly followed after her, worry written all over her face. "Eleanor, it's already so late. Why don't my brother and I drop you off?"

That offer sounded far too dangerous.

More time around NVolan meant risking exposure.

Yet hailing a taxi in this neighborhood at night was nearly impossible.

After weighing her options, Eleanor slipped into the car at last. "I appreciate it, Fannie-and you as well, Mr.Stewart."

Nolan didn't bother responding. He simply leaned back, eyes shut, as though none of it concerned him.

Thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop.

Eleanor stepped out gracefully and gave a polite wave. "Thanks for the ride. Take care on the road.Goodbye."

Without another word, Eleanor turned and disappeared into the residential complex.

Only then did Nolan open his eyes, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure.

Why did it feel like she was running from him?

Tsk.

The more he watched her, the more secrets seemed to pile up.

From the front seat, Erick suddenly blurted out, pointing toward the roadside, "Mr. Stewart, isn't that Mr.Todd's car? What's it doing here?"

Nolan followed the direction of his hand and spotted Jonny's vehicle.

It sat idly beneath a tree, angled just enough to block part of the emergency lane.

Leaning back against his seat, Nolan spoke with cool detachment. "Take a picture and report it to the polic "Understood, Mr. Stewart," Erick replied at once, pulling out his phone to snap a photo as evidence.

Nolan reached over and ruffled Fannie's hair with unusual gentleness. "Fannie, we always follow traffic rules,alright?"

Her wide eyes blinked up at him.

Today,he almost seemed playful.

She couldn't help but like this side of him-it made him feel more human.

Where Jonny's car was parked, Jonny himself was bound to be close by.

Just as Eleanor was about to head upstairs, he stepped in front of her, blocking her way.

Her eyes narrowed as she looked up at him, voice laced with mockery. "Step aside, Jonny."

Instead of snapping back, Jonny crushed his cigarette underfoot and leaned closer.

The sharp scent of smoke mixed with his familiar cold aura, wrapping around her.

"I bought a villa in the city," he said flatly. "You'll move in tomorrow. I admit I was wrong before-l ignored your feelings. From now on, I'll give you three days of my week." With that, he tossed his hair back from his forehead, as if the gesture might impress her.

Eleanor just stared, then lifted her hand and smacked him. "How's that for clarity? Awake now?"
###Chapter 37| Just Don't Love You Anymore


Jonny froze, staring at Eleanor in disbelief.

He had laid out such enticing terms, yet she still turned him down?

What more could she possibly want? The title of his wife?

Absurd.

That spot was reserved for Lainey, and Lainey alone.

He swiped the blood from the corner of his lips, fury flashing in his eyes. "Eleanor, don't push your luck!"

He lunged toward her,trying to claim her lips by force.

Revulsion surged through Eleanor. She shoved him back with all her strength."JOnny, where do you get the guts for this? Do you think you're some kind-of sultan with a harem?"

She regained her composure and continued, "Let me spell it out one last time. I'm not pretending to play hard to get. I just don't love you anymore. That's it. So drop the narcissistic act and go be with your darling Lainey."

Her gaze swept him from head to toe before she flashed him a cold smile. "Frankly, a manipulative man and a shameless woman make a perfect pair."

The words hit Jonny like knives.

Today, he had humbled himself, come down from his lofty perch, and even waited here, just to give her a chance.

If she had only admitted fault, he might have allowed her back into Todd Group.

Instead, she spat in his face with stubborn defiance.

Stubborn. Insolent. Who gave her that right? His jaw clenched, voice low with venom. "Don't forget, Eleanor! You only grew up with the support of Todd Group!"

She laughed coldly. "Wrong. That credit belongs to Sallie, who supported me and the orphanage.I owe her everything.And you?"

Her eyes hardened. "If you keep showing up in front of me, I won't hesitate to let those photos see daylight."

Without another glance, she slid her card and stepped into the elevator.

Jonny's legs twitched to follow, but he stopped short.

The photos wouldn't ruin him, but they would humiliate him.

The thought made his stomach churn.

Damn it. What was Eleanor really after?

Why was she being so impossible now?

Could it be true that she had stopped loving him?

No.

Impossible.

A woman who had loved him for three years didn't just walk away overnight.

No,she had to be angling for more-still dreaming of becoming his wife.

But let her dream.

That title belonged to Lainey, and no one else.

Jonnystormed toward his parking spot, his temper boiling over.

But when he got there, the space was empty. His sleek black sedan was nowhere in sight.

What the fuck? Where did it ggo?

How could a whole car just vanish?

His rage was about to spill over when a man in uniform stepped out from the shadows, with a small notebook in hand.

"Mr. Todd?" the officer asked, handing him a slipof paper. "Your vehicle was parked in a fire lane and has been towed."

Jonny froze, staring at the ticket. What kind of nonsense was this? Since when had he parked in a fire lane?

And even if he had, who would dare to report him?

He snatched the ticket and crushed it in his fist. "Who the hell reported me? Do they have a death wish?"

The veins in his neck stood out as his face twisted with fury.

The officer didn't so much as blink. "Sorry, that information is confidential."

Without another word, he took his leave.

Jonny was left seething. He might have been a president of a listed company, but in a city overflowing with power players, he wasn't anyone special.

Besides, the one who filed the report was Nolan's assistant.

That officer might have been low in rank, but he wasn't stupid.

He knew very well who it was safe to offend and who it wasn't.

And honestly, Jonny had broken the law. This time, he couldn't cry unfair.
###Chapter 38 Please Think Of The Company's Future!


Jonny's eyes stayed fixed on the officer's back until he disappeared, his jaw aching from how tightly he ground his teeth.

Forget it.

The company came first.

He couldn't risk creating another storm.

Slamming his fists against his thighs, he flagged down a cab and rode straight to the Todd family's estate.

Eleanor had always shown deference to Sallie-maybe his grandmother could convince her to return.

To his shock, the second he voiced his plan, Sallie's palm cracked hard across his face. "This entire mess is your doing. How dare you bring it up again?"

The blow landed with all the force of her conviction.

A woman who had built her life on principle could not stomach a grandson incapable of telling right from wrong.

To her, it was nothing short of disgrace.

Reeling from the slap, Jonny bit back any defense.

Instead,he dropped to his knees and clung desperately to her legs. "Grandma, please! Eleanor is already close to Mr. Stewart, and because of that, he's pulled his investment from us. I'm terrified that once I marry Lainey, Eleanor will lash out again and drag the Todd Group down even further. If she doesn't return to me,our company will collapse."

Jonny's voice dropped to a pleading softness. "Grandma, please think of the company's future!"

Deep down, he didn't truly believe Eleanor had caused the Stewart Group to pull out. But he knew Sallie wouldn't budge unless he painted her as the reason.

He doubted a man like Nolan would ever seriously want a divorced woman.

Sallie's chest tightened as fury rose. "Shut up! The Stewart Group left because of your mistakes. Eleanor had nothing to do with it!"

She had lived long enough to see through people.

Her grandson's intentions were as clear as day.

Jonny simply couldn't stand watching Eleanor live well, and he wanted to keep both women at his side.

That selfishness would ruin their family.

Exhaustion crept over her as she pressed her fingers to her temples. With a tired wave toward the servant,she murmured, "Take me back to my room."

Even after she retreated to her room, Sallie's thoughts refused to settle.

Rumors about the Todd Group's troubles had already reached her ears.

The investment from the Stewart Group had been vital to keeping the company afloat.

Without it, the Todd Group truly risked collapse.

In her heart, Sallie knew Eleanor wasn't the kind of woman to strike from the shadows-she was too straightforward, too decent for that.

Still, Jonny's words lingered. If Eleanor really had drawn close to Nolan, perhaps that connection wasn't without meaning.

Maybe, just maybe, there was still a thread of hope to grasp.

The idea of watching the Todd family's legacy crumble after decades was unbearable. Pride might have to be sacrificed for the sake of survival.

After a long pause, Sallie turned to the servant and gave her instructions. "Reach out to Eleanor. Tell herI'd like to see her for a meal-that I miss her."

When Eleanor received the call, she was caught off guard.

Sallie was no ordinary woman. With Eleanor's ties to Jonny strained beyond repair, it seemed unlikely the invitation was out of simple affection.

Was Sallie truly trying to speak for Jonny?

That didn't fit her at all.

Sallie wasn't the type to meddle in such a way.

Carrying her doubts with her, Eleanor still went to the meeting the following day.

At the head of the table sat Sallie, already waiting, her face softened by a welcoming smile.

The moment her eyes fell on Eleanor, her expression grew even warmer, and she gestured gently. "Eleanor,come closer. Let me really see you."

Obeying,Eleanor took the seat beside her and wrapped her hands around Sallie's slightly frail ones.

"Sallie, I..." She faltered, her voice laced with guilt.

The divorce from Jonny had surely hurt Sallie most of all.

Reading her look without difficulty, Sallie let out a quiet sigh and patted her hand. "All I care about is whether you've been treated fairly. Jonny was the one in the wrong, not you."

A wave of gratitude washed through Eleanor at those words. Even among family,such fairness was rare.

Her chest warmed as she gave Sallie's hand a gentle squeeze. "Thank you for thinking of me, Sallie."
###Chapter 39 | Hate To Burden You With This





After the polite greetings were exchanged, Sallie finally cut to the reason she had asked Eleanor out.


"Eleanor, I hate to burden you with this," she began gently, her tone almost hesitant. "But the Todd Group... it represents the work and sacrifice of our family for generations. I've heard you're on good terms with NJolan Stewart. Do you think... maybe you could persuade him to reinvest?"


The request left Eleanor momentarily stunned.


Her lashes lowered, masking the swirl of emotions in her eyes.


If it hadn't been for Sallie's help years ago, the Hope House would have crumbled.


Eleanor had carried that kindness like a stone in her heart, the weight of it leading her, at one point, to  marry Jonny without hesitation.


But that debt had long been repaid.


Besides, Nolan wasn't someone whose choices could be swayed so easily. He was unpredictable,unreadable-a man who kept even his closest rivals guessing.


There was no bond between them.



Why would he alter a business decision just because she asked?


Sallie, noticing Eleanor's silence and the faint crease in her brow, let out a tired sigh. "Eleanor, if it's too much to ask, then forget I said anything. This is our family's mess. It shouldn't trouble you anymore."


Her voice carried a weary acceptance, as though she had already resigned herself to the worst.


Eleanor's heart softened. "Sallie," she said quietly,"if the opportunity comes, I'll bring it up to Mr. Stewart."


It was, after all, only a matter of words. Whether fate  chose to spare the Todd Group, that was something no one could control.


When Eleanor left the restaurant, she pulled out her phone. Her eyes lingered on a name glowing on the screen.



How was she supposed to bring this up to Nolan?


Maybe it would be better to wait for another time.


With a small sigh, she slipped the phone back into her bag.


But Nolan was well-informed.



He didn't need her to speak for him to know what had happened.


By the time half a day had passed, his network had already fed him the details.


He tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, a smile slowly tugging at his lips.


Would Eleanor come to him for Sallie's sake? He thought she would.


She disliked Jonny, but her heart was soft. How could she watch Sallie, aging and worried, carry the weight of a crumbling company?


It would only take her a fewv words to ease Sallie's burden.



Yet,Nolan was wrong.


Days passed, and Eleanor never mentioned a thing.


Well,it seemed he had underestimated her.


In rare good humor, he turned to Erick. "Get the car ready. We're going to the Hope House to pick up Fannie."



"Yes,sir."


Luck seemed to be on Nolan's side that day.


When they arrived, Eleanor, broom in hand, was carefully sweeping leaves from the yard.


Nolan crossed the distance in long, confident strides. What,you weren't going to ask me for a hand?"


Eleanor froze for a moment before lifting her head,her eyes narrowing slightly.


Typical.


In Elepdon, little escaped Nolan's notice.


Still, she hadn't thought he would confront her about it so directly.


Meeting his gaze, she replied coolly, "Well, message delivered. Whether you reinvest in the Todd Group,that's up to you."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned away and began sweeping in another corner, not sparing a single word in defense of the Todd Group.


Nolan felt the corners of his lips twitch with a quiet amusement.



He was just about to speak again when Fannie came running over, her eyes bright. "Nolan, what are you and Eleanor talking about in hushed voices?" He shifted his attention to her, his tone casual."Nothing important. Eleanor just owes someone a debt."


Fannie tilted her head, her clear eyes blinking in thought. "Then why not help her? If it's too expensive, just dock it from my allowance next month."



A faint glimmer passed through Nolan's eyes.


He had already made up his mind to help.


Clearing Eleanor's obligations to the Todd family was an investment worth every bit.


What intrigued him more was how she would choose to repay him in the end.


For the first time, he found himself genuinely anticipating it.
###Chapter 40 Call An Ambulance!





By the following morning, word had already spread through Elepdon's upper circles that Stewart Group was injecting funds back into the Todd Group.


Jonny practically bounced off the couch, the dark cloud that had been weighing him down evaporating in an instant.



He could hardly believe it. What he had tossed out as an offhand comment to win Sallie's sympathy had,against all odds, turned into a lifeline for the Todd Group.


What a windfall!


So he had been right after all.


Eleanor might act cold, but her heart was still tied to him.



Why else would she have spoken up on behalf of the Todd Group the moment Sallie opened her mouth?No, it wasn't about business-it had to be about him.


She must still be hopelessly in love.


A rush of satisfaction swelled in Jonny's chest, so fierce it nearly made him laugh.


Snatching up his phone, he instructed Allard the moment the call connected. "Arrange a private office for Eleanor. I want her back at the company."


When the line went dead, he muttered smugly, "If she's this devoted, I'll throw her a rope. But the title of my wife? That belongs to Lainey,always."


Not far away, Sallie gave a sharp, derisive chuckle."Delusions. After everything you've done, you really think Eleanor would stiIl look twice at you? That girl's heart is pure, but you trampled on it when you had the chance. You can't rewind the past,Jonny."


Her words carried the weight of disappointment. If Jonny weren't the sole heir, the Todd Group would never have landed in his hands. With a heavy sigh, Sallie pushed herself up,retreating slowly to her room.


What she didn't realize was that Lainey, standing quietly by the entrance, had heard every word.


That decrepit woman...always defending Eleanor!


What did Eleanor have that she didn't?


Just a pitiful little orphan with no background, no family name. Strip away her looks, and there was nothing.


And yet Sallie insisted on holding her up like a jewel,even after the divorce, still clinging to her.


And now Jonny, too, wanted her back in Todd Group?


Clearly, he hadn't let go.


Lainey ground her teeth. Fortunately, Eleanor had grown arrogant lately. With luck, she wouldn't agree.


Otherwise, forcing her out again would be far messier. Jonny, ignorant of Lainey's plotting, left for the office not long after.


With the Stewart Group's capital back in play, the company needed immediate attention.


In his rush, he didn't even notice Lainey standing the garden as he left.


Lainey had planned to stage a coincidental run-in with him in the garden, but being brushed off without so much as a glance made her stomp the grass in frustration.



She was about to storm off when a frantic voice rang out from upstairs. "Mrs. Todd! Are you alright?"


Lainey froze, then smirked.


Another episode, was it?


Serves the old woman right.


But this... this could be useful.


If she played the role of the concerned daughter-in-law, she might just worm her way deeper into Sallie's good graces and into her shares.


Putting on her sweetest mask, she dashed inside."Sallie!"



The bedroom door stood wide open.


Sallie was sprawled on the floor, her skin ashen and lips pale.


As soon as Lainey stepped in, the maid blurted out in a rush, "Miss Gilbert, thank heavens you're here!Mrs. Todd's having another attack. I'll get her back to bed, and you grab the medicine from the drawer,quick!"



Lainey bristled at the command, loathing the idea of being bossed around by a servant. Still, she forced a smile and nodded. "Of course, I'll get it right away."


She strode to the bedside drawer, pulled it open, and her eyes immediately landed on a brown glass bottle with a neatly printed label. This had to be it.


She lifted it, then hesitated. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the maid supporting Sallie back onto the mattress, blocking the old woman's view.


A flicker of cruelty flashed across Lainey's eyes. In that brief moment, she slipped the bottle to the farthest corner, sliding a box on top to hide it completely.


Sallie had always treated her like dirt, poisoning Jonny's mind and keeping him from marrying her.


If she dropped dead tonight, that barrier would be gone.


If she survived, then fate was simply being kind.


Feigning panic, she rattled through the drawer noisily.




The maid, now sweating as Sallie's condition worsened, snapped, "Miss Gilbert, haven't you found it yet? It's always at the front-you couldn't possibly miss it!"


Lainey glanced over her shoulder, widening her eyes as if flustered. "I'm telling you, it's not here. Maybe Sallie tucked it away somewhere when she was organizing her things?"


The maid faltered, torn by doubt.


But Sallie had already slumped unconscious.


The maid's hands shook. Without the medicine,Sallie's life could be at risk.


Abandoning Lainey, she tore into the drawer herself,rummaging until she finally pulled out the bottle buried at the very back.


Her hands shook as she hurried to administer the dose, but the delay had already stolen precious minutes.Sallie remained unresponsive.


The maid's throat tightened. "This... this is terrible."


Regret burned through her chest. If she had searched instead of wasting time relying on Lainey,Sallie wouldn't be at death's door.


Her voice cracked as she called for help. "Butler! Call an ambulance
###Chapter 41 You're Making Baseless Accusations





Half an hour later, news of Sallie's collapse reached Eleanor. Without hesitation, she raced straight to the hospital, her pulse hammering with dread.


When she pushed open the door to Sallie's room, the scene made her pause. Not a single member of the Todd family was present, only the loyal maid and the weary butler kept watch by the bedside.


Eleanor didn't waste time questioning it. She hurried to the bedside and examined Sallie.


Her tense brow relaxed after a brief examination.


Sallie's condition was weak, but her pulse was stable.

For the moment, her life wasn't in danger.


Still, something gnawed at her.


"I left her medication with clear instructions. It was supposed to be given on schedule. How could things have deteriorated to the point of a coma?" Eleanor said.



The maid's face drained of color. She wrung her hands before stammering, "It... it was when Mrs.Todd suddenly worsened. At that moment, Miss Gilbert happened to come in,and..."


Before she could finish, a sharp voice sliced through the air. "Well, well. Miss Warren." Lainey swept into the room like she owned it, her lips curling into a poisonous smile. "You've divorced Jonny. Don't you think it's rather improper to meddle in his family matters now?"



The rvalry between the two women crackled in the air. The maid, knowing better than to get caught in the crossfire, quickly slipped away with the butler.


As she was left alone with Lainey, Eleanor's eyes hardened. If Lainey was responsible for Sallie's hospitalization, then she would make sure Lainey rotted in jail. She gave a cold, dismissive laugh. "If I'm not mistaken, Miss Gilbert, you're still not part of the Todd family,are you?"


The barb hit its mark. Lainey's expression twisted,venom flashing in her eyes.


"It won't be long before Jonny and I marry," she spat."Unlike a slut like you! Who's spread her legs for countless men. Jonny despises you!"


Her voice grew louder and harsher, each insult more vicious than the last. "You're nothing but Sallie's lapdog. Do us all a favor and leave Elepdon. Stop shamelessly trying to seduce Jonny!"


Lainey's fury wasn't without reason. She remembered clearly that Jonny had left home late one night, claiming urgent work at the office.


Suspicious, she had had someone look into it. He hadn't gone anywhere near the office. Instead, he had gone straight to Eleanor's neighborhood.


The thought burned Lainey alive. It must be this  bitch! She was dragging him back!


Eleanor, however, didn't flinch. A soft, mocking laugh escaped her lips as she slowly retrieved her phone from her bag, waving it lightly. "Miss Gilbert," she said smoothly, "your tongue is certainly sharp. I wonder how Jonny would react if he heard every word of it?"



The blood drained from Lainey's face. She recorded it?


Her composure snapped. With a snarl, she lunged toward Eleanor, clawing for the phone. "You bitch!"


She had always been soft-spoken and composed around Jonny. If he heard the recording,her carefully curated image would shatter. No! She couldn't let that happen.


But Eleanor moved with deadly precision. In an instant, she blocked Lainey's reach and pushed her back.


Eleanor's lips curved into a cutting smile. "Jonny doesn't interest me. If he's your prize, go ahead and take him. But watch your little games-if I find out you had anything to do with Sallie's coma..."


She let the threat hang in the air.


Lainey sank to the floor, completely undone.


Had Eleanor already discovered what she had done?


She couldn't have known! At the time, it had just been her and the maid, and she had been careful.Eleanor must be bluffing.


Trying to salvage her composure, Lainey stammered,her eyes flicking nervously, "You're... you're making baseless accusations. I don't know what you mean."


But Eleanor's gaze was unwavering.


She was certain Lainey was involved in Sallie's condition, but the exact details remained a mystery.


She would need to speak with the maid later to uncover the truth.


"You know exactly what I'm talking about," Eleanor  retorted, her words slow and deliberate. "And don't think that just because you're in the hospital room pretending to help, you can harm Sallie without consequences. There's surveillance everywhere. One wrong move, and your days of scheming are over."


With that, she turned on her heel and left,leaving Lainey seething in place.


"That bitch! Slandering me without proof! I'll make her pay once I'm Jonny's wife!" she muttered under her breath.


Then her mind snapped back to the recording.


Her stomach churned. She needed a plan, and fast,before Eleanor could use it against her.
###Chapter 42| Shouldn't Have Snapped At You





Eleanor had never been the kind of woman anyone could push around.


The moment she stepped out of the hospital, she wasted no time in forwarding the voice recording straight to Jonny.


She hadn't walked far before stopping again.


With a calm hand, she blocked his number once again, then slid behind the wheel and drove off without looking back.


At that moment, Jonny was pacing restlessly in his office.


Even though the Stewart Group had injected new funds, the amount was barely half of what it used to be. On top of that, several investors had already pulled out, leaving the Todd Group still on shaky ground.


As he brooded over the mess, his phone lit up with a notification.


It was a Facebook message from Eleanor.


A smug smile tugged at his lips.


He had overestimated her. She gave in the moment he showed her a bit of kindness.


Arrogantly, he tapped open the message and hit play.


But instead of Eleanor's supposed pleas, Lainey's sharp, venomous voice rang out.


Jonny froze.How could this be?


Lainey was always soft, always delicate. Since when did she spit words so harshly?


Something was off.


He immediately tried calling Eleanor.


"Sorry, the line is busy right now. Please try again later..." He refused to accept it and dialed again, only to hear the same thing.



Cursing under his breath, he switched back to Facebook and furiously typed, "Did you tamper with this recording on purpose? Eleanor, I must've been blind not to see your manipulative side earlier. Do you think cheap tricks like this will break me and Lainey apart?"


But as soon as he hit send, a bright red exclamation mark appeared.


Message rejected.


Jonny's temples throbbed.


Damn it.



She had blocked him again.


How dared she?


Just then, a soft knock sounded at the door.


"Come in!" he snapped. Startled by his harsh tone, Lainey shrank back. No one had ever raised their voice at her like that.


With tearful eyes, she carefully stepped inside, her voice fragile. "Jonny, did I come at a bad time? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I asked the kitchen to make chicken soup for Sallie and kept some aside for you too. I thought you might not have had time for lunch,so I brought it over."


A single tear slid down her cheek, softening her features into something heartbreakingly delicate.


In the past, Jonny would have felt his heart shatter at a scene like this.



But now, he just


looked at her face, studying her in silence. "Did you run into Eleanor at the hospital?"


Lainey's grip on the thermos stiffened for a moment.


So Eleanor really had sent him the recording. That cunt! Good thing she was ready for it.


Setting the thermos aside, she walked over and softly held Jonny's arm. "Jonny, this is on me. I shouldn't have talked to Miss Warren that way.I just... I love you so much, Jonny. I was scared she might take you away."


She then changed the topic. "Your stomach isn't feeling well, so have some soup first. I know you hate it when people speak harshly. Once you finish,1pack up and leave you in peace."


Her tears spilled freely as she ladled the soup for him, stealing hesitant glances in his direction before quietly turning to leave.



Jonny's chest clenched. She was the woman he couldn't bear to lose. In an instant, he caught her by the wrist and drew her into his arms. "I'm sorry,Lainey. I shouldn't have snapped at you."



Her words made sense. She had spoken harshly only because she cared about him. She was gentle by nature. Eleanor must have cornered her, twisting the moment to her advantage,and then recorded it to create trouble.


The more Jonny thought about it, the more certain he became.


Lainey snuggled into his arms, a small smirk playing on her lips.


Eleanor could plot all she wanted, but Jonny's heart was hers to soothe with a few well-placed tears.


Eleanor was nothing but an orphan with no real influence.



Even so, being outsmarted like this left Lainey feeling annoyed.


That bitch had always treasured Hope House above all else, hadn't she?


Then she would make it vanish.


She might not be able to meddle with the Usepsall project directly anymore, but there were other ways in.


Her brother's geological survey team would be perfect for the job.


As the thought took root, a wicked glint sparked in her eyes.
###Chapter 43 What A Coincidence





After spending some intimate time with Jonny, Lainey finally left, though reluctantly.


As Jonny watched her back fade into the distance,Eleanor's face suddenly came to mind, bright and vivid.



Was she deliberately trying to provoke Lainey? Was that why she sent the recording? To make Lainey doubt him? Could it be jealousy?


Otherwise, why would she bother doing something so petty?


This woman was infuriating.


When he had been willing to give her a graceful way to back down, she rejected it. And now that he had cut her off, she was pulling every cheap trick to stir up trouble between him and Lainey. Forget it.


For Grandma's sake, he would give Eleanor one last chance.



He grabbed his suit jacket from the chair and made his way downstairs, sliding into the black sedan waiting by the roadside.


As he pulled the door shut, his eyes flicked briefly to the driver.



The man was new, an unfamiliar face, but Jonny didn't give it much thought. "To the Podium Apartments," he ordered flatly.


"Yes, Mr. Todd."


When Eleanor got back to her apartment building she instantly saw Jonny hanging around, like an unwelcome shadow.



Her brows knitted slightly, and instead of heading toward the main entrance, she turned toward a side entrance to avoid him. She couldn't understand him at all.


When she was still married to him, Jonny couldn't keep his distance fast enough.


Yet now, he kept showing up on his own, uninvited.


What was he trying to play at?


Jonny saw her and quickly stepped forward, blocking her way. "What's the meaning of this? I'm right here.Didn't you notice me?"


Eleanor stopped and lifted her eyes to meet his with calm confidence."Oh, I saw. Just happened to notice a scumbag standing there. What a terrible day."


Jonny's teeth clicked together in anger.


This woman!


Did she really just call him a scumbag to get his attention?



He was about to speak again, ready to throw her another chance to patch things up, when a clear,low voice rang out. "Erick, find out who this scumbag is that keeps pestering Miss Warren, and get rid of him."


Not far away, Nolan stood tall, posture straight,his expression cool and unreadable. "Miss Warren, what a coincidence."


Erick nearly laughed aloud.


Nolan wasn't even bothering to hide his reason for being here anymore.


He had received word earlier that Jonny's car was headed for the Podium Apartments.


Nolan had told his staff he was inspecting a new property development nearby, but now here he was,exactly where Eleanor lived.


Obvious enough. He wasn't here for business. He was here for her.


Men.


Always saying one thing while meaning another.


With that thought, Erick's eyes flicked between Nolan and the unfamiliar driver in Jonny's car. The two exchanged a subtle, knowing look.


Meanwhile, Jonny was completely oblivious. Forcing a strained smile, he greeted stiffly, "Mr. Stewart,what brings you here today?"


Nolan didn't even glance at him. Instead,he walked straight up to Eleanor. "It's late. Since we've run into each other, how about joining me for a meal? I still owe you a proper thank-you for saving Fannie last time."



Eleanor was taken aback.


Her eyes instinctively darted to Jonny, whose expression was thunderous.


But she quickly made her choice. Better to spend her time with Nolan than waste it dealing with Jonny.


At least Nolan was easier to bear.


"Alright," she said calmly. "Then I'll accept."


Maintaining her poise, she walked beside Nolan and slid gracefully into the waiting black Bentley.


Jonny stood frozen, seething inside. His anger was ready to erupt, but he forced it down.


With the Stewart Group's reinvestment into the Todd Group, he couldn't afford to offend Nolan now. He would just have to endure.


Anyway, Nolan couldn't really have feelings for Eleanor.





Once the novelty wore off, he would have plenty of ways to deal with her.
###Chapter 44 Where Are You Taking Me For Dinner





Inside the back of the black Bentley, Eleanor shifted in her seat, unable to shake her restlessness.


Whenever she was around Nolan,she found him too mysterious to read-and keeping some space seemed like the safest bet.


With this thought in mind, she cleared her throat and spoke up. "Actually, can you let me out at the next corner? Something just came up, so let's catch up some other timne."


She eyed the upcoming side entrance to Podium Apartments, knowing slipping in there would help her dodge Jonny.


But Nolan gave no reaction at all. He kept his eyes shut, silent and unmoved by her request.


Erick sat up front, hesitant to act without a word from  Nolan. He knew better than to guess what his boss might be thinking.


As the car rolled past the intersection, Eleanor grew anxious and tried again. "Mr. Stewart?"


It was only then that Nolan gradually opened his eyes, his calm gaze fixing on her face, which still carried a trace of caution. "Miss Warren, didn't you just agree to this yourself a moment ago?"


She instantly regretted opening her mouth, wishing she could take her words back. How could she forget that the man sitting with her was never easily fooled?


Her smile was forced as she tried to sound polite."You know, Mr. Stewart, every socialite in Elepdon would do anything just to share a dinner with you. lf word gets out that I monopolized your time, I might not survive the fallout. Could you please let me off the hook this once?"


Even as she spoke, Eleanor cringed a little inside.


Nolan caught the hint of embarrassment and let his  lips curl into the faintest grin. "So, you're saying even someone as clever as you can get nervous?"


His laid-back voice made her heart skip a beat.


If only she had never crossed Nolan for the sake of Todd Group three years ago, maybe none of this mess would have happened.


While Eleanor was busy kicking herself for getting tangled up with Nolan, the Bentley suddenly jolted over a bump, and she lost her balance, tumbling sideways.


In a split second, Nolan reached out and caught her,steady and unflustered.


Eleanor stiffened, realizing just how close he was.


His face hovered inches away-so close she could make out the sharp line of his jaw and watch the slight movement in his throat as he swallowed.


That fresh, understated scent he always carried washed over her, making her senses spin.  Without thinking, she swallowed had, her pulse racing.


Nolan looked down at the woman pressed against him, his voice dropping to a teasing tone. "You know,Miss Warren, you're coming on pretty strong."


Eleanor's cheeks burned as she jerked herself away scooting further across the seat.


Could things get any more embarrassing?


She couldn't believe how clumsy she had just been.


Still, even with her pride bruised, she had to admit-Nolan really was almost unfairly handsome.


No wonder all those high-society women tripped over themselves trying to catch his eye.


Determined to keep things moving,Eleanor cleared her throat and tried to act like nothing happened."So, where are you taking me for dinner?"


Since there was no escaping now, she figured the only thing left was to finish the meal and hope he  would let her leave afterward.


Nolan leaned back, arms crossed, studying her for a long moment.


He remained silent for a long while before his lips finally parted. "You'll know soon enough."


From the front seat, Erick caught the whole exchange and nearly laughed out loud.


Who could have imagined that Nolan, one of the most influential figures in Elepdon's elite circle,would act so carefully around a girl he liked?


If his business partners ever found out, they would be stunned into silence.


Erick grinned. It looked like his boss was finally on the verge of getting a girlfriend!
###Chapter 45 This Woman Just Stole From Me
Two hours later, the meal was coming to an end in a private dining room at the Lumina Hotel.


Eleanor dabbed delicately at the corners of her mouth with a napkin, her eyes flicking over Nolan,who sat opposite her, calm and collected as always.


"Thank you for the meal, Mr. Stewart," she said lightly. "Now that we're done, I won't keep you any longer."


She picked up her bag and started to leave.


At that exact moment, Erick came in, and they almost bumped into each other.


He stumbled back, flustered. "Oh, sorry, Miss Warren."


Eleanor was just as surprised, but she composed  herself and gave him a polite smile. "It's okay."


Before he could say anything else, she was already gone.


Erick was left standing there, scratching his head.


She was...something else.


No wonder she caught Nolan's eye.


Shaking off his distraction, he finally turned to Nolan."Sir, there's something you should know. This afternoon, a geological survey team went to Hope House. From what I found, it looks like the Gilbert family is behind it."


Whether the Todds had pushed them to act, though,still wasn't clear.


Nolan set his cup down slowly, eyes narrowing. He considered it for a moment before speaking. "Let it be for now."



He wanted Eleanor to feel indebted to him, to make sure next time she couldn't slip away like that. Meanwhile, Eleanor had just reached the hotel entrance when she ran straight into Emma.


Emma was surrounded by a rowdy group of friends,clearly tipsy and laughing too loud.


The moment she saw Eleanor, she planted herself in her way, a smirk playing on her lips. "Well, well, if it isn't my brother's little admirer. How can someone from an orphanage even afford a place like this?"


Then, as if struck by a brilliant idea, she clutched her hand to her mouth in exaggerated shock. "Wait,could it be... you're here with your sugar daddy?"


Then she gestured to a few of the men standing nearby. "Eleanor, these guys are all from wealthy families.Hanging out with them would be far better than waiting on those old men. Make them happy,and who knows? The tips might even top what your sugar daddy gives you!"


The memory of the exhibition had been gnawing at Emma,fueling her anger. She had been itching for a chance to lash out, and now Eleanor had just walked right into her trap.


Today,she was determined to make her pay.


The men Emma had brought along weren't exactly gentlemen.


Seeing Eleanor, attractive, poised, and seemingly alone, they immediately reached out.


Even if nothing more came of it, a few gropes would satisfy them.


However, before their hands could even touch her,Eleanor's swift kicks sent them flying.


Her face hardened as she tossed each man over her shoulder.


Within seconds, all of them were lying on the floor,groaning and cursing.


"Damn it, Emma! Why didn't you tell us this woman could fight?" one of them spat in disbelief.


Emma froze at the sight, shocked to see Eleanor in action.


For a moment, she couldn't process it.


But then the surge of anger returned-no way could she let this humiliation slide.


She had to make Eleanor pay.


Glancing at the hotel security, she barked, "Aren't you going to stop her? This woman just stole from me. If you don't, your manager will fire all of you!"


The guards hadn't seen Eleanor enter with Nolan.


Offending the Todd family wasn't an option.


Still, after a tense moment, they cautiously closed in on Eleanor, surrounding her.
###Chapter 46 You Really Are Ungrateful




Eleanor rolled her eyes at the whole display."Seriously? That's all you've got?"


She was a good fighter. Dealing with those security guards was child's play.


She was just getting ready to take action when she suddenly caught sight of Nolan, who had just stepped out of the hotel lobby.


He stood leaning against the glass doors, watching her with an amused grin.


No telling how long he had been there,quietly taking it all in.


As soon as Nolan realized she had noticed him, he strolled over, slow-clapping as he came closer.


"Not bad at all, Miss Warren," Nolan called out.


People usually saw Eleanor as soft-spoken and polite, but there was a fierceness in her that no one could push around.


Trailing after Nolan, Erick stared in open-mouthed shock. He never would have guessed that delicate-looking Eleanor could outmatch men. Poor Nolan-he was going to have his hands full with her.


Meanwhile, Emma's tough exterior disappeared the instant she spotted Nolan. Her eyes widened, and she swapped anger for vulnerability as she rushed toward him."Mr.Stewart!"


Before she could get too close, Erick stepped in,holding out an arm. "Miss Todd, you know Mr.Stewart isn't big on unexpected company."


Emma nearly lost her balance, stumbling awkwardly.She glared, annoyed-of course a powerful man like Nolan would step. in when a woman was in distress.


Turning on the waterworks, she faced Nolan and begged, "Mr. Stewart, I have no idea what we did to upset this crazy woman. She just started swinging!You've got to help us out." Nolan's reputation for keeping to himself was well known. He usually stayed out of petty drama.


Even so, the way he watched Eleanor out of the corner of his eye made it clear-she had caught his attention.


The group of rich men exchanged uneasy looks before bolting upright.


One clutched his stomach and blurted out,"Something's wrong with me-l need to get to a hospital."


Another waved his phone as if in panic. "Shoot,I forgot my mom told me to come home early. I can't stay."


"My girlfriend's calling me. We'll catch up some other time!" a third chimed in, bolting away even faster than the ones before him.



With the power he held, Nolan could destroy them without breaking a sweat.


No one in their right mind would have dared to push  their luck.



Yet Emma, stubborn and thoughtless, continued to stir up trouble. Foolishness clung to her every move.



When Nolan said nothing, Emma leaned forward,panic rising in her voice. "Mr. Stewart, you can't let Eleanor deceive you. She's nothing more than a schemer who trapped my brother with her charms..."


Her words were cut short when Nolan spoke at last."Does the Todd Group no longer require financial support?"


Emma froze, blinking in confusion. "What are you talking about?"


Erick quickly interjected, "Miss Todd, what Mr.Stewart is saying is that if your family's company doesn't want the funds, then we will gladly pull out our investment."



The meaning hit Emma hard.


Was Nolan defending Eleanor again? Just like he had at the previous exhibition?


What made that bitch so deserving of Nolan's support?


Although resentment weighed heavily inside her,Emma kept her mouth shut, unwilling to risk a single word.


The funding Jonny fought so hard to secure could vanish with one careless move, and Emma knew if she ruined it, the blame would fall squarely on her.


Resentment burned her throat, but she forced a smile and bowed her head. "Please excuse my behavior. I didn't mean to cause any trouble."


Once Emma slipped out, Nolan approached Eleanor with calm confidence, lowering himself until his face hovered so close that she could feel the warmth of his breath.



The nearness made her tense, and she reacted on impulse, trying to shove him back bout to no avail.

 
Nolan didn't look offended. Instead, his eyes gleamed with amusement, and the corners of his lips curved in a sly grin.


His hand lifted without warning, brushing over her hair in a gesture that felt far too casual for the moment.


"You really are ungrateful," he murmured with a teasing lilt. "Another rescue, another tally-I'll keep track for you."


Shock rooted Eleanor where she stood, the intimacy of his touch catching her completely off guard.


But before her mind caught up, Nolan had already turned away, leaving her behind with her fury simmering.


As if she needed saving.


Those guards would have scattered the moment she dealt with them, yet he insisted on painting himself as the courageous hero.


Her jaw tightened as she swore under her breath that she wouldn't let herself get tangled up with him again.
###Chapter 47 Please Give Him A Hand





Eleanor had no idea that someone on the second floor was watching her every move with a pair of hostile eyes.


Jealousy ate away at Lainey, and her glare nearly burned with it.



How did Eleanor manage to capture Nolan's attention when every woman in town wanted him?


She was nothing but a divorced woman without any connections.



Emma was completely useless and failing to get even the slightest upper hand!


A man, dressed like a butler, rushed over,interrupting Lainey's thoughts. "Miss Gilbert, we've taken care of the situation with the orphanage."


Relief finally washed over Lainey. She gave a crooked smile, her eyes cold. "You did well."


Eleanor only cared about that shabby old orphanage.


Destroying it would hit her where it hurt.


The butler looked uneasy. "Miss Gilbert, what if Jonny finds out about this..."


Lainey's father had assigned him to support her,so he had some idea about Lainey and Jonny.


There had been heated arguments before, all because of that orphanage.


If the truth came out, her father would turn his anger on him.



Lainey shot him a hard look. "It was just a routine inspection team. Whatever they reported is exactly what they saw. It had nothing to do with us."


In her mind, even if Jonny learned the truth, it would not make a difference.



Everything was different now. Her father was already thinking about putting money into the Todd Group.


By now, Jonny wouldn't just avoid blaming her. He would even make an effort to make her happy.


A satisfied feeling crept in as Lainey straightened her shoulders and walked into the private room.


Not wanting to upset her, the butler trailed after her.


Across the table in the private room, Jonny faced Lainey's father, Kurt Gilbert.


Jonny/ lifted the cup but set it back down without taking a sip. "Kurt, if you decide to put money into the Todd Group now, I would be deeply thankful."


If the Todd Group wasn't teetering on the edge of collapse, he would never lower himself to seek help from a company that had yet to make its mark on the stock exchange.


The Gilbert family might have lived quietly in Elepdon, but everyone in town knew their fortune was impressive. Getting them to invest would be the lifeline the Todd Group desperately needed.


Kurt showed no sign of being moved. Leisurely,he took a sip from his glass before finally saying, "Jonny,you know the Stewart Group hasn't made its position clear. Rushing into an investment with you would put us at too much risk."


No clear answer came from him.


Right at that moment, Lainey entered the room and jumped in as if she had been waiting for her cue."Dad, Jonny, and I have known each other our whole lives. You can trust him. Please give him a hand."


She slipped into the chair beside Kurt and linked her arm with his, sharing a look with him.


With a smile that looked annoyed, Kurt made his voice gentle. "You two aren't even married, and you're already choosing his side."


"Dad, why would you say that?" Lainey lowered her gaze, putting on a bashful look, thouigh a flash of calculation hid in her eyes.


It was time to get serious.


Kurt took another slow sip, then focused on Jonny."Now that I think about it, three years ago, I made a mistake by separating you and Lainey. Now, all I want is for my daughter to be happy. If you agree to marry Lainey now, I'll give you $100 million. Let that count as my way of helping the Todd Group through this rough patch."


That kind of money and a marriage to Lainey would have been a dream come true once upon a time.


Oddly enough, Jonny couldn't get Eleanor's face out of his mind.



Noticing his hesitation, Lainey clenched her jaw so tightly it nearly made her teeth ache, but she managed to put on a gentle smile. "Dad, Jonny and I truly care for each other. Please, don't try to force his hand like this."



Jonny snapped out of his thoughts at her words. He realized there was nothing stopping him from being with Lainey now.


If Eleanor got upset, he could always charm her back with a few kind words.
###Chapter 48 Nolan Isn't Going To Bite





Lost in thought, Jonny gently held Lainey's hand and looked straight at Kurt. "Kurt, Lainey's right. Even if that hundred million wasn't inthe picture, I'd still treat her well."



The matter was settled almost before anyone realized it.


Lainey couldn't help but picture herself as the wife of the CEO of a public company.


The thought made her pulse quicken with pride and anticipation.


Finally, she would have everything she had dreamed of.



And as far as she was concerned, there was no longer any place for Eleanor in their lives.


While they excitedly finalized wedding plans, Eleanor's world was anything but calm.


Myah's call had thrown a wrench into her plans. An unexpected inspection team had appeared out of nowhere, claiming Hope House was unsafe. It was old, precariously built on a seismic belt, and therefore a hazard.


They had ten days to relocate or face a forced eviction.



Eleanor spent two sleepless nights sifting through every possible option.


Finally, with her apprentice's help, she found a suitable site. Relief should have washed over her,but it didn't. Lillian had come by to offer comfort, but her words only added to Eleanor's worries. "Eleanor, isn't this land owned by the Stewart Group?"


Eleanor froze and immediately pulled up the Qualen Estates files.


Oh yes.


How could she have forgotten? Qualen Estates was a Stewart Group subsidiary.


Lillian, noticing Eleanor's stress, approached with a teasing grin. "You and Nolan... you two seem pretty close. Why not just talk to him?"


Eleanor stiffened. Lillian had somehow let slip to Ryland about Nolan's supposed impotence.


Ryland, of course, had scolded her and then gone on about how men sometimes like to exaggerate their...abilities in private.


It all added up. Nolan was definitely good in bed, and if Eleanor ended up with him, she would undoubtedly be happy.


Lillian felt it was practically her duty to nudge them together.


Eleanor, meanwhile, shifted uncomfortably under Lillian's knowing gaze.


"Close?" Eleanor echoed, a little sharp. "I barely know him." But Lillian wasn't fooled. Her eyes sparkled mischievously. "Come on, Eleanor, be honest. Are you hiding something from me?"


Could it be that Eleanor had shared secret moments with Nolan?


Eleanor's cheeks burned as she shot Lillian a glare,exasperated. "No. Nothing."


Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.


Just as she was about to press further, Eleanor's phone buzzed.She checked it and froze.


"Qualen Estates refused to sell?" Her expression darkened instantly.


Lillian let out a small laugh. "See? Fate is practically shoving you toward Nolan."


She gave Eleanor's shoulder a playful pat. "Too shy to make a move? Shall I set up a meeting for you?"


Eleanor resisted visibly.

 
This wasn't about someone arranging things for her. She had promised herself she would stay away from Nolan, and she wasn't about to dash into his arms now.



Pride wouldn't let her.


But Lillian could see through the tough exterior.


Eleanor was all resolve on the surface, but her heart was soft. For the sake of the orphanage, she would bend if she had to.



With a playful nudge, Lillian pressed on. "Oh, please,what's there to be scared of? Nolan isn't going to bite. And don't forget, that jerk of an ex-husband has already gone public with his engagement to Lainey,and the Todds and Gilberts are working together.If you don't take advantage of Nolan's power, you'll have to rely on the Enigma Group, and even if you move Hope House, they'll still manage to interfere."


Lillian had already heard that once the two families locked in their alliance, the Gilberts poured money into the Todd Group. Not long after, Hope House started facing problems.


Officially, it all looked unrelated, but she refused to believe the families didn't have a hand in it.


Eleanor considered this quietly and realized Lillian had a point.


While she didn't take the Gilberts or the Todds seriously, their constant meddling was a headache.


More importantly, the frequent relocations weren't good for Myah or the kids.


Rather than risk exposing her identity using the Enigma Group's connections, it made more sense to leverage Nolan's influence.


Still, the situation served as a harsh reminder of her earlier bold claims.
###Chapter 49 | Truly Appreciate What You've Done





Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself sitting across from Nolan in a quiet, refined café just opposite the Stewart Group building. Nolan looked his usual self-composed, unreadable, and perfectly at ease.



Meanwhile, Eleanor's attention kept drifting to Lillian,who was perched right beside her like a cat itching to knock something off the table.


Honestly, why had she let Lillian tag along?


She already knew how much Lillian loved meddling,and now her presence only made it harder for Eleanor to speak.


With a quiet sigh, Eleanor shot her a sharp, warning look.


Lillian's lips curved into a little pout, a flicker of  disappointment crossing her face.


Still, she knew better than to overstay her welcome,so she rose to her feet.



Leaning close, she whispered in Eleanor's ear with a grin only the two could catch. "Relax. My brother swears those rumors about Nolan being impotent are lies. HHe's definitely good in bed. So go on and snatch him up! I'll cheer for you!"


Then, with a sly wink at Nolan, she swept out of the café looking far too pleased with herself.


Eleanor froze, her mind blanking. What on earth was that?



Lillian was getting bolder and more outrageous by the day.


Shaking it off, she forced herself to focLIS.


After a long breath,she pulled a folder from her bag and pushed it across the table. "Mr. Stewart," she began carefully, "about the Qualen Estates land, I know your company isn't planning to sell, but I need  it badly. I'm prepared to increase my offer by ten percent."


Of course, she wasn't just some ordinary buyer. She was the hidden force behind the Enigma Group.


If it weren't not for the risk of exposing herself, she wouldn't be here, lowering herself to ask a favor.


Nolan, however, didn't even blink. His fingers rested lazily against the table as he opened the document,skimmed a page, then shut it again and slid it back toward her. "Not for sale," he said flatly.


Eleanor's lips pressed into a thin line. If it wasn't up for sale, why had he agreed to meet in the first place? Was he playing her?


She clenched her jaw. "Then what will it take for you to agree, Mr.Stewart?"


At that, Nolan finally raised his eyes, their depth unreadable. "Miss Warren, I said it's not for sale. But that doesn't mean other arrangements can't be made."  Her stomach tightened. What was he implying?


For a moment, she realized she didn't understand this man at all; perhaps she never had.


Nolan caught the guarded look in her eyes. He noticed it, but it didn't bother him in the slightest.


He then reached into his briefcase, pulled out a folder, and slid a document across the table.


Eleanor glanced at it and froze.



A deed of gift for that land?


He was giving it away, just like that? Her eyes widened in disbelief.



She scanned the page again, and the truth finally sank in.



This didn't make sense. Why would he...


She looked up, blurting the question without hesitation. "Why are you doing this?"

 
Nolan leaned back with ease, his posture casual, his eyes revealing nothing.


"Our foundation has always backed Hope House.This is no different," he replied evenly, as though it was nothing out of the ordinary.


Eleanor studied him closely, trying to pierce through the calm mask he wore.


Yet no matter how hard she tried, his thoughts remained a mystery.


Still, the issue that had weighed on her heart was resolved,and that alone steadied her.


She pushed aside the swirl of emotions and spoke earnestly. "Thank you, Mr. Stewart, On behalf of the children, I truly appreciate what you've done."


A faint arch lifted his brow, and something playful lit up in his eyes.


Leaning forward, closing the space between them until his presence felt overwhelming,he murmured "And how exactly do you plan on thanking me, Miss Warren?" The effortless authority in his voice only made the air around him feel heavier.


Eleanor's pulse stumbled. Instinctively, she shifted back, trying to create some distance. "If there ever comes a time you need my help," she said softly, "I'lI do everything I can."
###Chapter 50 Nolan's Clearly Into You





An empty promise? How amusing.


Nolan's lips curved faintly before he straightened,slipping back into his usual polished composure.


Yet the glimmer of amusement in his eyes betrayed him. Eleanor frowned slightly. Had she said something wrong?



She was just about to ask when a sudden ringtone broke the moment,



It wasn't her phone-it was Nolan's. He answered briskly, but as he listened, his calm expression hardened into something far more severe. The shift was so sudden it startled Eleanor.


Snapping the call to an end, he rose from his chair in one smooth movement. "Sign the agreement.Something urgent came up." And just like that, he was gone, the door swinging shut behind him.



Eleanor stared after him, bewildered.


What could possibly shake someone like Nolan so much? Still, it wasn't her place to pry.


Exhaling slowly, she gathered herself, signed the contract, and left the café with the file in hand.


Lillian hadn't gone far. The moment she spotted Eleanor, she practically bolted over. "So? How did it go? Nolan didn't look very happy when he left. Don't tell me the deal collapsed!"


Eleanor, not in the mood for a barrage of questions,simply handed her the folder.


"What? He really agreed?" Lillian snatched it open,already buzzing with disbelief.


But when her eyes fell on the bold print inside, her jaw nearly dropped to the ground. "No way. Eleanor,am I hallucinating?" Her gaze darted around nervously as she clutched the contract as though afraid someone might snatch it from her hands.


Eleanor rolled her eyes at her dramatics. "Aren't you supposed to be from the Brooks family? Try not to look so desperate."


But Lillian was practically shaking. An entire plot of land worth billions... just given away like it was nothing?


Even on her eighteenth birthday, her father and brother hadn't spoiled her with anything close to that.


And Eleanor and Nolan weren't even... related.


Her excitement quickly shifted to suspicion.


She eyed Eleanor, dead serious now. "Hold on. You didn't... sell yourself to him, did you? No way. You're Enigma. You don't need to trade yourself for land.Love should be taken slowly, not..."


"Stop." Eleanor cut in before Lillian could run  off with her own ideas. "He didn't ask me for anything, and l didn't offer anything. He said it was support for Hope House. That's all."



She repeated his explanation about Stewart Group's long-term support for Hope House.


Lillian, however, wasn't convinced. She squinted at Eleanor, her expression makingit clear she wasn't fooled. "Girl, you've really gotten yourself into something. Nolan's clearly into you."


After all, what kid of corporate sponsorship involved giving away an entire plot of land?


Lillian couldn't come up with a single explanation,other than romance.


At this point, she didn't even need to push them together.



With the way Nolan was moving, Eleanor was bound to get caught up in his pace sooner or later.


Still, being with Nolan wasn't all sunshine. His name alone drew attention, and his admirers weren't exactly few.


The thought made Lillian uneasy, leaving her worried about whether Eleanor could handle the pressure that came with him.


Eleanor, on the other hand, wasn't indulging in such wild ideas.


She gave Lillian a light tap on the forehead and laughed. "Don't start weaving your own romance novel. Nolan said it was for charity, so take his word for it. Let's move on."


Maybe Nolan was simply using Hope House as a chance to polish Stewart Group's public image. It didn't have to mean more.



"Fine, fine." Lillian pouted, but her playful mood quickly returned. "Anyway, it's a win! We should celebrate. Come on, drinks are on me!"
###Chapter 51 They're Only Asking For $100 Million





Eleanor was about to nod when her phone vibrated.


A glance at the screen made her pause. "Sorry,Lillian, I'll have to take this. We'll catch up another time."


Knowing Eleanor's status and the weight of her responsibilities, Lillian didn't protest. She released her arm with an easy grin. "No problem, babe.Just promise to call me when you're free."


Lillian gave a cheeky wink before strutting off,lighthearted as always.


Watching her friend disappear into the distance,Eleanor allowed herself a faint smile before lifting the phone to her ear.


"Boss, the Stewart family just placed an order through the Underground Network. They're  demanding the Soul Surgeon, claiming they'll pay whatever it takes. Just now, they even raised the offer-money or otherwise, any terms can be negotiated. What's your decision?"


The woman's tone on the phone carried a clear hesitation.


Normally, such requests came often, accompanied by staggering bids, some even reaching a billion.Eleanor had turned every single one away. It was hard to imagine this time being any different.


But the image of Nolan's uncharacteristically tense expression flashed across her mind, stirring something within her.


Could this desperation be for Fannie?


Eleanor's fingers tightened around the phone. Then,after a soft exhale, she gave her verdict. "Accept it."


On the other end, silence stretched before the woman blurted in disbelief, "Boss...what?"


Eleanor's face remained composed, her voice level. $100 million. And the location must be cleared. No one stays."


Her double identity had to remain buried. If Nolan lingered nearby, his sharp eyes might see through her facade.


The woman on the line was stunned. One hundred million?


That was far less than what others had offered, yet this time Eleanor.relented.


Was the gossip circulating in Elepdon true?


Was Eleanor somehow involved with Nolan?


She dared not probe further. With respectful haste,she replied, "Understood, boss. I'll make the arrangements."


When Erick received the news, he could hardly contain his excitement. "Mr. Stewart, the Soul Surgeon has agreed! They're only asking for $100million. The only condition is that no one can be present during the treatment." The money wasn't a problem. It was the stipulation that gave him pause.


Fannie was the family's precious gem.


The thought of leaving her in the care of some mysterious doctor felt reckless. What if something went wrong?


But Erick reminded himself that people with real talent were often a little unusual, even eccentric. If this Soul Surgeon was as skilled as their reputation suggested, then perhaps trust was the only option.


Ultimately, the choice wasn't his to make. It rested with Nolan.


Nolan's eyes lingered on Fannie's pale, still figure.


After a long pause, his voice cut through the tension."Do it. Follow their terms."



Thirty minutes later, a woman dressed head to toe in black, her face hidden behind a silver mask, stepped into the hospital. Erick's eyes followed her as she entered the room.So this was the famous Soul Surgeon? He hadn't expected her to be this young, and a woman, no less.Appearances never told the whole story.


Eleanor, oblivious to his scrutiny, had already made her way to Fannie's bedside. She examined Fannie carefully, her brow knitting as the truth revealed itself.


So that was it. NNo wonder Fannie's body was so frail.


A rare genetic mutation had left her with a blood disorder so unusual it was scarcely recorded anywhere in the world.


For most doctors, it was untouchable, impossible to cure.


And yet, Fannie had survived this long, thanks to the Stewart family's tireless efforts.


However, untreatable did not mean hopeless.


From her compact kit, Eleanor produced needles.

With practiced precision, she inserted each one, channeling energy into the girl's weakened body.


When the procedure ended nearly half an hour later,the pallor on Fannie's cheeks had given way to a faint,healthy flush.


Eleanor allowed herself a quiet breath of relief. At least part of her debt to Nolan had been lessened.


She tucked the girl in gently, then packed away her things and left the room.


Outside, Erick, blindfolded as she had ordered,hurried to her side. "Soul Surgeon, how is MMiss Stewart?" His tone brimmed with restrained urgency.


Eleanor answered evenly, "Her state has stabilized.But this illness is congenital. Long-term treatment is required. This was only the first stage. She'll need two more sessions, once a week, before she can be fully healed."


For the first time, someone had spoken with certainty about curing Fannie.


The Soul Surgeon's reputation was no exaggeration.  Ecstatic, Erick nearly bent in a full bow. "Thank you!Thank you, Soul Surgeon! I'll see that your fee is delivered immediately."


Eleanor only gave a small nod before vanishing down the corridor.


Once the silence returned, Erick removed his blindfold and pulled out his phone, his hands trembling with excitement as he sent a message."Boss, Miss Stewart can be saved."
###Chapter 52 I'll Let It Slide This Time




Word of the Soul Surgeon's upcoming consultation sent waves of excitement throughout the Underground Network.


A rush of hope lit up in the eyes of many influential people struggling with severe illnesses.


The inbox belonging to Eleanor's top disciple nearly burst with messages.


Even so, she knew the full story. Eleanor only agreed to this particular case because she felt personally responsible, not for any kind of payment.


For that reason, she had to refuse countless requests.





No matter how many she rejected, the stream of inquiries never slowed.


All she could do was wish that Eleanor might set aside a little time to make a few rare remedies,just to relieve some of the stress.


Glancing over the disciple's string of complaints,Eleanor erased them with a single swipe.


There was no way she could be everyone's hero.


Her plate was full, between her work at Hope House and the brand-new Enigma Group, leaving her with hardly any extra minutes in the day.


Once another hectic week had passed, it was time for Fannie's next round of treatment.


Progress was clear. Fannie had not regained consciousness, but her health was much better.


A worry tugged at Eleanor. If Fannie suddenly woke up,she might not be ready, so she hurried out of the room as soon as the treatment ended.


She might have béen rushing too quickly, as she ended up bumping straight into a man.


The impact was enough to stop her in her tracks. Heat crept up Eleanor's cheeks behind her mask,and she stepped back quickly to say, "I'm sorry."


Catching a clear glimpse of the man's face brought her to a standstill.


Nolan stood right there.


Panic flashed through her mind.


Maybe he wouldn't notice who she really was.


She had to get away fast.


With that idea pushing her, she spun around and made her way quickly toward the elevator.


Nolan narrowed his gaze, sizing up her clothing.Could that actually be the Soul Surgeon?


He had come straight from the office to check on Fannie's progress, only to come face-to-face with the Soul Surgeon here.


Still, the Soul Surgeon reminded him of Eleanor.

Could they be the same person? He dismissed the idea immediately as it sounded ridiculous.


Yet, he couldn't help but call out, "Where are you off to,Soul Surgeon?"


Hearing his voice, Eleanor felt her chest tighten, so she lowered her tone. "I can't tell you."


Without saying anything more, she slipped inside the elevator.


Her quick exit caught Nolan's eye, and he stood there deep in thought.


Nearly running, Eleanor hurried out of the hospital.


That was too close.


Next time she visited Fannie, she would need to be extra careful.


After puulling off her mask and working the tension from her cheeks, Eleanor noticed a call from Lillian lighting up her phone.


"Eleanor, where are you right now? I'll come get you!" After sharing her location, Eleanor watched as Lillian's eye-catching purple-red convertible rolled up beside her.


As soon as Eleanor settled into the passenger seat,Lillian leaned over and gave her a curious look."Eleanor, what have you been up to? You look like something rattled you!"


Eleanor shifted awkwardly under her friend's stare and cleared her throat. "It's nothing. I just left the hospital."


Raising an eyebrow, Lillian looked doubtful but decided not to argue.


She started the engine and made a dramatic pout."Just so you know, I get you for the rest of the day.If you ditch me again, we're officially done!"


A wave of guilt hit Eleanor, and she sent Lillian an apologetic glance. "I'm sorry, Lillian. Things have been kind of overwhelming lately."


After studying Eleanor's tired expression, Lillian let out a sigh and softened her tone. "Okay, since you've been running yourself ragged, I'll let it slide this time."


Their conversation drifted to lighter topics, and soon Lillian brought up some gossip. "Oh, before | forget,did you know Lainey and Jonny finally set a wedding date? They picked the 18th of next month. Lainey's father has even tossed in $100 million as a wedding gift!"


Eleanor gave a distracted nod, her mind wandering elsewhere.


Noticing Eleanor's lack of reaction, Lillian finally relaxed.


If Eleanor could hear that news without flinching,then maybe she really had let go of that jerk. Feeling relieved, Lillian pressed her foot down. "Hang on tight, babe. We're about to have the time of our lives!"
###Chapter 53 | Wanted To Discuss Fannie's Aftercare





Following several days spent with Lillian, another appointment was already waiting.


This would mark the third and final round of treatment.



Fannie stirred awake more than once throughout the procedure.


Still, with Eleanor in disguise, Fannie never guessed her true identity.


As Eleanor prepared to insert the last needle, the room's door swung open, and Nolan entered, his eyes covered by a cloth.


Her hand faltered just a moment, frustration prickling at her nerves.


Of all days, why did he have the luxury to supervise  in person now?


At least he had the sense to keep his eyes shielded,or else she would have had to stop right there.


Once she regained her composure, Eleanor inserted the last needle.


A short wait would be necessary before she could remove the needles.


Nolan remained off to the side, saying nothing.


Eleanor expected the silence to linger, but he broke it with an unexpected compliment. "Your abilities as a healer are impressive, Soul Surgeon."


She offered no reply.


Nolan continued, undeterred by her lack of response,"The last doctor who treated my sister believed her case was almost hopeless. In only three weeks,you've managed to help her recover."


Nolan rarely spoke at such length.


Was he trying to uncover something? A frown settled on Eleanor's face, but she kept her silence.


Since his eyes stayed hidden, she figured there was nothing for him to pick up on as long as she stayed quiet.


Surprisingly, Nolan shifted just enough to face her directly, even with the cloth over his eyes. "Soul Surgeon, are you familiar with clinical medicine at Northbridge University?"


Eleanor's hand trembled for a moment. "I know a little about it."


Clearly, this bothersome man would not give up until she replied.



Everyone knew Northbridge University ranked as the nation's top school. Acting clueless would only invite suspicion.



Sure enough, after she answered, Nolan edged closer.




Although a black cloth still covered his eyes, the faint  lift of his lips showed he was in good spirits.


Standing so near, Eleanor could once again catch that familiar crisp scent of his.


"I happen to know someone who had a degree in the clinical medicine from Northbridge University. She'd be thrilled if she heard you were interested in it."


Could he be talking about her?


Was he growing suspicious?


No,she needed to cut this conversation short.


Luckily, the session wrapped up just then, giving her an excuse to steer away from the topic.


"The treatment is finished, and your sister has made a full recovery. There will be no need for us to meet again." Eleanor delivered the words quickly, gathered her tools without delay, and intended to leave the room,


Yet, Nolan blocked her way without a hint of panic."What's the hurry? I wanted to discuss Fannie's  aftercare."


Staring at his striking features, Eleanor fought back a wave of irritation.


"I'l send all the instructions to the number that reached out before." She tried to slip past him.


Nolan appeared to sense what she was about to do and stepped in just enough to block her way again."I'm sorry, I suppose I'm a bit restless. I want to hear about my sister's condition directly from you."


Even with the cloth over his eyes, it felt as though his gaze pinned her in place.


A sense of impatience crept up on Eleanor.


She nearly blurted out a demand to know what he really wanted.


Her better judgment stopped her just in time.


Exposing herself now would bring nothing but headaches.


With her jaw set and her voice steady, she said, "Mr. Stewart, I'd appreciate it if you respected my boundaries. I trust your staff has already explained my terms."


Her meaning was obvious. She wanted him to stop digging into who she really was.


A trace of amusement flickered across Nolan's face as he lifted his brows. He could see that Eleanor still stayed sharp.


After a moment, he finally moved aside, letting her through.


Relief swept over Eleanor.


She reached for the door, only for Nolan's low voice to echo behind her.


Soft as it was, the sound struck her like a jolt."Eleanor."





Her entire body went rigid.


Every muscle froze.


Was this a confession of what he knew?  Or was he just fishing for a reaction?


She couldn't let anything slip.


Without turning or giving any sign, Eleanor pulled the door open and slipped out, never once looking back.


Nolan removed the black cloth from his eyes, a pleased smile settling on his lips as he watched her leave.


There was no doubt in his mind now. It truly was Eleanor.
###Chapter 54 You Deserve Each Other




In the days that followed the incident, Eleanor kept herself out of sight. Not once did she dare step near Hope House.


The fear of Nolan lingered. If he turned up again and pressed her with more questions, sooner or later she would give herself away.


But while Eleanor hid, Lillian grew restless. One afternoon, she marched straight to the Podium Apartments and all but dragged Eleanor outside.


Reluctantly, Eleanor let herself be pulled along,agreeing to a shopping trip she hadn't wanted.


Their timing, however, couldn't have been worse. By sheer misfortune, they crossed paths with Lainey and Jonny.


Lillian muttered a curse at their rotten luck and was about to steer Eleanor away when a sharp voice rang out.


"Jonny, you don't even bother looking properly before saying I'm stunning!"


Something about that voice made Lillian pause mid-step. Her eyes flicked to Eleanor's, and in the same instant, they both stopped moving.


Inside the bridal boutique, Jonny stood before an irritated Lainey, rubbing his temple like the weight of her words had triggered an instant headache.


Yet what choice did he have? Placating her was the only way forward.


"For me, Lainey," he replied weakly, offering the most hollow reassurance he could muster, "you'll always be the most beautiful."


The words were flat, so empty they barely passed as sincerity.


Frustration twisted Lainey's face as her fingers clenched the hem of the gown. Since the day their wedding date was announced,Jonny had worn the look of a man being marched to execution.



And as if that weren't enough, Sallie had the audacity to survive her ordeal-and then starve herself in some pathetic attempt to derail their marriage.


Fortunately, Vickie had stepped in on her behalf,cutting Sallie off before she could succeed.



None of it mattered in the end.


Every setback only pushed Lainey closer to her goal.


Sooner or later, she would become Jonny's wife.


The thought brought a smile back to her lips. She slipped her arm through Jonny's and spoke in a coaxing tone. "Jonny, you really are too sweet. But these dresses don't please me. Let's try another boutique."


Jonny's reply was little more than a grunt, neither yes nor no. Pretending not to notice his indifference, Lainey turned briskly toward the fitting room to change.


From where they stood, Lillian let out a low whistle."Would you look at that? Lainey really does have the patience of a saint."


Eleanor smirked and lifted her thumb in mock praise."Oh, she's got plenty."


So much for true love.



Right after their wedding date was set, Jonny's mask started to slip.


Men always longed for what wasn't theirs.


When Lainey stepped out of the bridal shop with Jonny at her side, the first thing she caught were the mocking looks plastered across Lillian's and Eleanor's faces.


A prick of heat crawled up her neck.


Had they seen everything inside?


She swallowed the embarrassment down, refusing to let it surface. Straightening her spine, she plastered on a triumphant air, chin tilted high. "Miss Warren, if you're that desperate to cross paths with Jonny, you don't need to drag poor Ms. Brooks along as cover."


Lainey had always known how to weaponize her tongue.


With one cutting remark, she managed to jab at Eleanor while sowing seeds of discord toward Lillian.


But the trap fell flat-Lillian didn't flinch.


Instead, she circled the couple slowly, her lips curling into a smile that dripped with venom. "A tramp and a fool-you deserve each other. May you both choke on your happiness."


"You-" Lainey's anger nearly boiled over, but she choked back the words before they escaped.


This was Lillian, spoiled by the Brooks family. She wasn't someone she could afford to cross.


StilI, resentment festered. How could Eleanor-ordinary, with no power or pedigree-earn the  protection of both the Stewarts and the Brooks family? It was unbearable.


Lainey was ready to spit more poison, when Jonny suddenly tugged her hand.


"Lainey, drop it. We're leaving," he said.


Something about sitting across from Eleanor unsettled Jonny. The sight of his ex-wife-calm,unruffled, radiant in her own quiet way-left a strange flicker of shame gnawing at him.


He should have been boasting, showing her how far above her he now stood.



Yet the memory of that hundred-million wedding gift from Lainey's father weighed heavy on him, making his pride feel cheap.


One day, he promised himself, once his company survived this crisis, he would pay it back in full-then rub his success in her face.


With his word given, Lainey had no room left to press the matter. Still, in her heart, one truth remained unshakable:when the wedding came, she had to be the star.


The gown she wore needed to scream perfection.Nothing less would do.


Before leaving, Lainey cast Eleanor one last poisonous glare, then spun on her heel and stormed off.


Across the way, Eleanor lifted her thumb toward Lillian with a small, knowing grin. Nicely done.
###Chapter 55 The Design Is Siren Amour





Back from the mall, Eleanor slipped easily into the shadows again, keeping her presence quiet and unnoticed.


Avoidance was her protection-she had no intention of risking a run-in with Nolan, cunning as a fox and twice as persistent.


Her work required little face-to-face contact anyway,so hiding wasn't difficult.


But carefully laid plans had a way of unraveling.


An embossed card arrived soon after, Nolan's invitation to a party celebrating Fannie's recovery.


Her instinct was to'decline immediately. Yet after a long pause, she decided to accept it.


What could he really do if she chose to keep her guard up? Nothing she couldn't counter.


And besides, the Hope House still lingered over her like a debt unpaid. On paper, she owed him,and appearances demanded she show up.


The evening crept in faster than she lik<ed.


At the grand entrance of the Lumina Hotel, Eleanor stepped out of Lillian's sleek sports car, her composure wrapped tight around her nerves.


Inside, chandeliers spilled light over a bustling crowd,where gowns shimmered and conversations swirled.


Among them stood Lainey, dressed to impress, her pale pink off-shoulder gown making her look eager to be noticed as she floated from group to group,fishing for relevance.


As if pulled by instinct, Lainey's head turned toward the door.


The instant her gaze landed on Eleanor, her polished smile cracked, faltered, then hardened into something sharper.Jealousy flared in her eyes like a spark catching flame.


What the hell was that bitch doing here?


Lainey had originally intended to drag Jonny along,certain that parading him would cement her importance in front of everyone.


But at the last moment, Jonny brushed her off,muttering about company work and refusing to come.


Deep down, she knew the truth-it wasn't the workload, it was his discomfort. Without a formal invitation, he didn't dare show his face.


Still, Lainey told herself that appearances were everything. In society, status wasn't given; it was claimed. If one stood tall enough, no one would dare caIl it embarrassing.


With that thought, she smoothed her expression and turned back to the crowd, a polished smile curving across her lips. "Jonny Todd and I are marrying soon.I do hope you'll all join us for the celebration." She lingered on Jonny's surname deliberately, letting it roll off her tongue as if it carried the weight of an empire.


But the guests gathered by the Stewart family were anything but ordinary. To them, the Todd name was small change. Not a single expression shifted in admiration.


Awkward silence stretched-until Darleen Faulkner,who had brought Lainey in, looped her arm through Lainey's with easy affection. "Lainey's gown is a custom commission from Enigma," she remarked brightly. "The design is Siren Amour. Surely, we could persuade her to give us a preview?"


Color rose faintly to Lainey's cheeks, and she pretended to let out a careful laugh. "Darleen, I'm flattered, but I must apologize. I wasn't completely satisfied with some details, so Enigma is making final adjustments for mne."


The explanation rippled through the group like a spark. Enigma making revisions for her? That wasn't something just anyone could demand.


Even they struggled to secure such attention.


This was a privilege reserved for the VIP clients.


Eventually, the dismissive looks melted away, and the socialites swarmed Lainey as if she were the evening's centerpiece.


"Lainey, you're simply dazzling-Elepdon's true leading lady!"


"| heard Jonny's ex-wife didn't even get a proper wedding when she tied the knot with him!"


"Exactly, how could a bumpkin like that ever be compared to Lainey?"


"Honestly, Jonny must have lost his mind to marry someone like her in the first place!"



Lainey might not have been the most powerful among them, but her ties to Enigma gave her an edge, and in their eyes, that was enough to warrant flattery. Yet Eleanor sat unmoved. Words like that only dirtied the mouths that spoke them, never the one they targeted.


Lillian, however, had no patience for such nonsense.


Her voice sliced through the chatter, dripping with sarcasm. "Isn't it amusing? Someone crashes an event without so much as an invitation, only to strut around bragging about a gown that went out of fashion years ago."


If memory served, Siren Amour was one of Eleanor's older designs, a style recycled so many times it had long since lost its shine.


The hum of chatter inside the ballroom vanished in an instant, the silence heavy enough to press against the walls.



Lainey's practiced smile wavered, almost collapsing under the weight of being called out so brazenly.


From the moment she stepped into the event, she had been walking on eggshells, terrified someone might realize she hadn't been invited at all-just smuggled in by Darleen's side.


Now, Lillian had not only dragged that truth into the open but also mocked the Siren Amour she had fought tooth and nail to claim.


How was she supposed to win favor among these women now?



Damn that Lillian!



Why was she always standing in her way?


Still, Lainey knew better than to lash out. Offending Lillian would be suicide. So she steadied her breath,pasted on a meek expression, and spoke with deliberate humility. "Ms. Brooks, you misunderstand.I would never boast. I simply admire Enigma's work so deeply that even an older design feels like a treasure to me. And truthfully, Siren Amour is only a spare. Just last week, I placed an order for Enigma's newest release-though I can't be sure it will be finished in time for my wedding." Her lashes dipped, her gaze lowering as if embarrassment had softened her into modesty.


From across the room, Eleanor finally broke her silence, her lips curving into a quiet, amused smile."Is that so? How curious-I wasn't aware Enigma offered pre-orders on unreleased gowns."
###Chapter 56 Hope House Will Be Relocated Soon





Because her workload was unpredictable, Eleanor had never once opened reservations for Enigma gowns.


Lainey's knack for fabricating lies with a straight face seemed to sharpen by the day.


Most of the women in the room had never even laid eyes on an authentic Enigma piece, much less understood the designer's rules.


That ignorance quickly turned into open hostility toward Eleanor. Disdain flickered across painted faces, and whispers turned sharp.


"You're just an abandoned wife from some orphanage. What could you possibly know about high fashion?"


"Exactly-how dare you spout nonsense here and  accuse Lainey of lying?"


But not everyone swallowed Lainey's claim so easily.A few had enough knowledge to hesitate, and Darleen was one of them.


Her confident smile wavered, as though something tugged at the back of her mind. "Now that I think about it... Enigma doesn't allow pre-orders. When l was planning my birthday, my mother and | casually asked..."



Darleen's words faltered, the last note uncertain,before her eyes landed on Lainey with a flicker of doubt.



Could she really have been fooled?


After all, she had vouched for Lainey, snuck her into this very party, and gone out of her way to polish her reputation. If Lainey was bluffing, her credibility would shatter with hers.


The subtle crack in Darleen's tone was all it took. A ripple spread through the circle, voices dropping,  expressions shifting. One by one, people began to second-guess.


Could Lainey really be a liar?


Heat crawled up Lainey's neck, her nails biting into her palms until they nearly broke skin.


Damn that Eleanor.


A blind strike, yet it landed perfectly.


If she didn't turn this around, her footing in these circles would crumble.



Drawing a steadying breath, she lifted her chin,forcing her eyes to glisten as though she were on the verge of tears. "Miss Warren, I understand you resent me because of Jonny, but does that mean you can invent lies to smear me?"


Her voice wavered delicately, the hint of a sob timed to perfection. "The truth is, years ago,I had the good fortune to meet Besty Juarez. When she learned I was getting married, she personally made an exception for me. Tell me, is that so wrong?" Gasps stirred the crowd. Besty was one of Enigma's top executives, a woman so rarely seen in public she was practically a legend.


Could Lainey truly have ties to someone like her?


Darleen's doubt melted instantly, her eyes lighting up with sudden excitement. She rushed forward and clasped Lainey's hand, her earlier hesitation forgotten. "Lainey, why didn't you say so before? You actually know Besty Juarez? I'm preparing for my engagement soon-please,you must introduce me to her!"



The moment Darleen spoke, the others quickly swarmed closer, their voices rising in eager chorus.


"That's right, Lainey, we're all your friends-you can't leave us out!"



"Lainey, you're too lovely and generous to refuse us.You'll introduce us too, won't you?"


The chorus of flattery washed over her, and a faint gleam of triumph flickered in Lainey's eyes.  But beneath that thin layer of pride, panic churned.


She had no connection to Besty at all.


What excuse could possibly save her now?


If she slipped, the lie would come crashing down on her head.



Her expression twisted between smugness and fear,emotions flashing so quickly across her face they almost tripped over one another. From a distance,Lillian folded her arms, smirking. "Eleanor, look at her -Lainey's face is doing backflips."


Eleanor barely registered Lillian's words, her mind snagging on something else entirely. Her stomnach tightened-Nolan was watching her.


From the second-floor balcony, he leaned against a pillar, red wine in hand, his figure framed by the warm light above. He was devastatingly handsome,but that wasn't what made her pulse quicken.


It was his eyes. The steady, unflinching weight of his gaze was so deep it felt as though he could peel  back her every defense.


Eleanor's pulse stumbled, and without giving Lillian a chance to babble further, she seized her friend by the wrist and pulled her straight into the lounge.


The door slammed shut behind them, the lock snapping into place with a sharp click.


With Eleanor out of his sight, Nolan finally allowed his gaze to drift away.


A faint smile ghosted across his lips as he lowered himself with practiced ease onto a circular couch nearby, every movement steeped in unhurried confidence.



From the side, Erick stepped forward, document folder in hand. His tone was deferential. "Mr.Stewart,the team has already begun construction. Hope House will be relocated soon."


Nolan scanned through the papers with little comment, though a flicker of thought shadowed his expression. Was it coincidence, or had Lillian and Eleanor displayed an oddly precise knowledge of Enigma's internal rules?


Closing the file, he leaned back, long fingers drumming lightly against the armrest. "Look into Enigma."


Erick blinked, startled by the sudden order.


Why would Nolan concern himself with a women's fashion house?


Could it be... was he planning to surprise Eleanor with something extravagant?


The thought stirred, but he kept his face composed and answered steadily, "Understood, Mr. Stewart. I'll see to it at once,"
 ###Chapter 57 You've Got A Deal!





Once the banquet drew to an end, the city lights gradually shimmered to life outside.


Spotting a chance when nobody was paying attention, Eleanor approached Fannie and took a quick peek at her not far away.


Fannie's face looked bright and healthy, and her whole energy felt vibrant and spirited.


As long as Fannie took it easy, there likely wouldn't be any serious issues.


After that, Eleanor turned away and returned to the apartment with Lillian.


Lillian barely made it through the door before flopping onto the couch, grinning from ear to ear."Eleanor, did you see Lainey? She couldn't even wait for the banquet to end before storming out! She's definitely hiding something! I swear, I can't get over it!"


The memory of Lainey struggling to look calm while panicking inside made Lillian all the more pleased with herself.


Seeing Lillian so delighted, Eleanor couldn't help but smile, too. Before she could say a word, her phone started buzzing on the coffee table.


Betsy's name flashed on the screen. "Sorry to bother you, boss. Here's the situation. There's a lady in the shop saying she's getting married soon. She wants a custom wedding gown done right away and doesn't care what it costs. She insists we accept her request.I honestly don't know what to do, so I wanted to ask you first."


Lillian overheard Betsy's call thanks to her sharp ears.



Excitement danced in her eyes as she chimed in with a sly grin, "Eleanor, you can't pass this up! Just think about it, your design on that manipulator at her own wedding. That'll be a sight to see!" If there was drama to be found, Lillian wanted a front-row seat.


Even so, Eleanor found herself intrigued by Lainey's little scheme.



A smirk appeared on Eleanor's face as she responded with ease, "Go ahead and accept the order. Just make sure she knows the fee is $10million."



"$10 million?" Besty's voice shot up in surprise.


Normally,their custom gowns didn't go for more than five million.


That amount sounded outrageous, as if they were demanding a fortune fit for royalty.


Still, Eleanor had given her orders, and Besty wasn't about to argue. "Understood, boss."


Once she ended the call, Besty headed over to where Lainey was waiting and flashed her a cheerful grin."Miss Gilbert, the main office has approved your request,Because the deadline is so tight, all the designers and craftspeople will need to work extra hours. As for the price-"


A surge of excitement showed on Lainey's face as she interjected, "Whatever it costs, I'll pay it. Just tell me."



She figured, no matter how fancy a dress could be,the price tag couldn't possibly be outrageous.


Besty offered a calm smile and raised ten fingers."$10 million."



Lainey's happiness faded on the spot, her eyes going wide with disbelief. "W-what did you say?"


Unfazed, Besty kept her polite expression and repeated, "$10 million, Miss Gilbert."


That kind of money could easily snatch up a whole collection of top-tier gowns from other luxury brands!



Enigma's creations rarely broke the five million mark before, so when did their prices shoot up like this? Was Besty seriously trying to puIl one over on her?


Lainey felt the urge to walk out then and there.


But her pride held her back. She had already promised everyone her intentions-failing to get the dress now would only make her look ridiculous.


She feared the thought of becoming the punchline among the socialites.


There was no way she would let herself endure that kind of humiliation!


Besides, she wasn't the one paying the bill, anyway.


Determined not to lose face, she squared her shoulders and forced out a response. "Alright, you've got a deal! $10 million!"


Her hand shook as Lainey filled out the paperwork for the custom gown.


Still, in her mind, it was a fair price to pay for all eyes on her.


Eleanor would never outshine her.
###Chapter 58 Where Did All That Money Go




Thirty minutes later, Lainey breezed into the Todd family's home, the signed contract clutched in her hand, and her mood soaring.


She was eager to tell Jonny the news.


If she dazzled everyone at the wedding, it would make him look good,too.


Surely, he would be thrilled.


Yet the moment she entered the living room, a completely different scene awaited her.


A sharp crash echoed as a glass shattered right at her feet.


"Lainey! Where did all that money go?" Jonny's eyes burned with fury, and for a moment, he looked ready to explode. Lainey instinctively backed away, shock and hurt flickering across her face.


Was he really lashing out at her over ten million?


So be it.



When the time came to turn her back on the Todd Group, she wouldn't hesitate because of him.


But until then, she would play along.


Once she regained her composure, she lifted her head,tears rolling down her cheeks. "Jonny, all I did was order a wedding gown from Enigma. I just wanted us to have a perfect wedding. You know how long I've dreamed of marrying you."


Back then, Jonny would always give in whenever she decided to turn on the charm.


But ten million wasn't a small sum! That was a massive amount!



He jumped through hoops, begged contacts, and scraped together investments. Even with the help of  several smaller firms, he hadn't managed to raise that much.


Yet, she spent it in the blink of an eye.


How could she be so reckless?


With each passing second, Jonny's frustration grew.His words came out colder than ever. "Lainey, do you have any idea what kind of mess the Todd Group is in right now? You're well aware we're struggling to keep the company afloat, and yet you chose to blow a fortune on a wvedding gown?"


When Eleanor was still around, she never wasted money like this.


Her wardrobe was simple, her lifestyle modest, and she rarely splurged on expensive jewelry.


He used to mock her for not fitting in with high society.


Now, he was starting to see that Eleanor had always managed the household wisely and genuinely cared about the Todd family's well-being! Unlike Lainey, who only knew how to spend!


Watching Jonny fume, Lainey felt her nerves panic.


She never expected him to lose his temper so completely over ten million, especially after everything they had been through.


Still, if this plan didn't work, she would just have to try something else. Unlike Eleanor, who lacked elegance and education, she knew exactly how to get her way whenever she needed to.


Putting on an anxious act, she reached out and gripped Jonny's hand tightly. "Jonny, please forgive me. I didn't mean to mess up. Please don't be mad at me...



Tears streamed down her face again, as though she had been deeply wronged.


She paused for a moment, then pressed on, "But everything I did was for you and your family! You have no idea what happened at the banquet. The moment I mnentioned that I'd ordered a dress from Enigma, all those usually arrogant socialites suddenly warmed up to me."


She locked eyes with Jonny. "You know how much everyone in Elepdon's upper class adores Enigma.Every socialite and aristocrat in town craves elegance, and none of them would pass up the chance to be linked with Enigma. Once I walk down the aisle in that gown, they'll all want to connect with me! These relationships could end up being a huge advantage for the Todd Group down the line!"



Her words struck a chord with Jonny.


The Todd Group never had a shortage of promising projects-what they lacked were reliable investors.


Should Lainey's new contacts turn into financial backers, the Todd Group would finally be safe from the Stewart Group's looming threats.


That realization softened Jonny's features. He reached out and drew her into his arms, all traces of anger gone. "Lainey, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you like tat. Please forgive me." Of course, Lainey still felt wounded, but she kept it hidden.




She leaned into his chest, speaking softly and sweetly. "It's fine, Jonny. As long as you know how much I care about us, that's all I need."
###Chapter 59 Show These Troublemakers The Door!


From that point on, Lainey's confidence only grew more inflated.

Within days, word had spread among nearly all the socialites in Elepdon that she had managed to snag Enigma's latest design.

At a bar owned by the Brooks Group, Lillian caught wind of Lainey's obnoxious bragging before even spotting her in the crowd.

Unbelievable.

What rotten luck!

With Eleanor buried in her work and unable to hang out with her, Lillian had simply hoped for a quiet night out at her family's place. The last thing she expected was to cross paths with this pretentious woman.

Any urge to unwind vanished instantly, and she made up her mind to slip out early.

But Lainey, ever observant, had already noticed Lillian's presence.

Champagne in hand, she strolled over with a practiced elegance.

"Ms. Brooks," Lainey called smoothly, giving Lillian a quick scan before laying on the flattery. "Do you enjoy Enigma's designs as well? If you're interested, I'd be happy to connect you with Besty."

She even tipped her chin upward at the end, clearly savoring her supposed upper hand.

Lillian nearly laughed out loud. As if she needed a favor from someone like Lainey to get her hands on Eleanor's work.

Lillian looked Lainey up and down, her gaze openly dismissive. "Miss Gilbert, if my memory serves me correctly, our bar has always reserved entry only for Elepdon's old aristocracy."

There was no mistaking her message-Lainey was out of place here. While Velvet Club stood as Elepdon's largest hotspot, the Brooks bar set the standard for exclusivity,reserved only for the VIP among VIPs.

Someone like Lainey, or even Jonny, had no business making it past the front door.

As she was called out so directly, Lainey's fingers tightened around her glass, and a flash of annoyance crossed her face.

Clearly, Lillian wasn't swayed by sweet talk or intimidation!

She counted on Enigma's status to pave the way, aiming to secure a connection to the Brooks family by winning Lillian over. Such a connection would have worked wonders for both the Todd Group and her own ambitions.

Yet Lillian was proving impossible to win over!

Meanwhile,Darleen watched the exchange with growing irritation. "She's my guest. What, are you planning to kick out guests now?"

She positioned herself between Lainey and Lillian."Don't get cocky just because your family's close with the Stewarts, Lillian. You don't get to walk all over the rest of us. Let me be clear, Lainey's with me, she's under my protection, and I won't let you push her around!"

She was desperate to impress Lainey, secretly hoping it would bring her closer to Besty as well.

Darleen was fueled by that hope, and her voice took on a sharper edge."On top of that, Lainey isn't merely an acquaintance of Besty's-they're actually related, even if it's distant. So, what reason could you possibly have for saying she doesn't belong here?"

Lillian nearly choked on her drink.

Lainey had a real talent for spinning tall.tales, and Darleen was gullible enough to buy every word.

Darleen's eagerness to cozy up to anyone useful had always grated on Lillian's nerves.

Today felt like the perfect moment to teach Darleen a lesson about rules. With a playful grin, Lillian kicked up her foot onto a nearby chair and rolled up her sleeves. "This is my family's territory. We decide who stays or goes. You're really willing to cross us just for Lainey's sake?" She addressed Darleen.

The Brooks name carried real weight in Elepdon, ranked firmly among the top ten families. Even without the Stewarts,their influence was undeniable.

In contrast, the Faulkner family barely scraped into the top fifty.

For a second,uncertainty flickered across Darleen's face.

Still, the thought of getting in Besty's good graces tempted her with visions of becoming the heir of the Faulkner family!

Gathering her courage, Darleen replied, "Ms. Brooks, there's no need for conflict. We're just here for a good time. Surely you wouldn't want people saying you kick out paying customers for no reason?"

That last line carried a subtle warning.

But Lillian wasn't one to back down. Raised in privilege, she was used to getting her way, and idle threats meant nothing to her.

With her hands on her hips and a mischievous spark in her eyes, she called out to the staff,"Well,what are you standing around for? Show these troublemakers the ddoor!"

The staff wasted no time and quickly moved in to show Lainey and Darleen the exit.

"Lillian, you'll pay for this! I won't forget.it!" Darleen yelled.
###Chapter 60 Show Up And Steal The Spotlight!


The scene downstairs was in complete disarray, but Ryland, relaxing upstairs, barely spared it a thought.

His only sister had always been his weakness, and he would let her get away with just about anything since they were kids. Unless Lillian managed to drag the Brooks family through the mud or get someone seriously hurt,he considered everything else fair game.

He let out a warm, helpless chuckle before heading back to the private room.

A massive floor-to-ceiling window offered a front-row view of the chaos below.

Nolan lounged quietly on the sofa, taking in the chaos without a word.

Ryland dropped into the seat next to him, downed a generous gulp of wine, and asked casually,'Nolan,what brings you here tonight?"

Nolan's unexpected arrival usually meant something big was brewing.

Ryland couldn't tell if it would spell trouble or opportunity.

Then Nolan's next sentence nearly made Ryland choke on his drink. "I've heard rumors that your sister might be Enigma."

"No way!" Ryland replied, sounding completely sure of himself.

Ryland couldn't imagine Lillian pulling off something like that.

Her reputation for being hopelessly unskilled preceded her. There was no way she could actually be Enigma.

If Lillian wasn't behind the mysterious identity, then Eleanor had to be. It was the only explanation for how both of them seemed to have inside knowledge of the Enigma Group and even quietly conducted business with them.

Even though they kept things under wraps, Nolan's sources had managed to dig up a few clues. Nolan didn't see any point in dancing around the issue with Ryland, so he spelled out his suspicions right away.

Ryland's eyes went wide, shock flickering in his gaze.

He instinctively leaned in, eyeing Nolan up and down, as if checking to see if his friend had lost his mind,before letting his guard down a bit.

"You can't be serious, Nolan," Ryland blurted out. "You're telling me Eleanor is Enigma? That's absurd! She double-majored in clinical finance, not fashion. What would she know about haute couture? Plus, isn't Enigma rumored to be some foreign guy?"

By the end, Ryland concluded, "Nolan, you've let your feelings cloudyour judgment."

Nolan narrowed his eyes, keeping his thoughts to himself.

With everything he had uncovered, even if Eleanor wasn't Enigma, she definitely had close ties to them.

Well...

This woman was turning out to be more complicated than he had imagined.

Completely unaware of Nolan's suspicions, Eleanor focused intently on creating the perfect dress for Lainey,just as she had been commissioned.

Her sense of professionalism wouldn't allow her to slack off; She believed that once she accepted payment,she owed her client her very best work.

Eleanor had no doubt the gown would be stunning, but whether Lainey could actually pull it off-that wasn't her problem.

While she mused over the details, her phone buzzed with an anonymous message.

She opened it to find an invitation to Lainey and Jonny's wedding.

Really?

Those two had the nerve to invite her? Did they not worry she might stir up some drama?
Eleanor couldn't resist snapping a screenshot and sending it to Lillian just for fuun.
To her surprise, Lillian bombarded her with excited texts insisting she make an appearance.
"You have to go!"
"Don't let Jonny think he's won. Show up and steal the spotlight!"
"Promise me you'll show up looking absolutely gorgeous and make them regret it!"
Eleanor, on the other hand, had zero interest in attending.
If she had a choice, she would much rather spend the day with the kids at Hope House.
She was about to politely decline when another message from Lillian popped up. "If you're not going, then I'm not going either! And if I miss it, my parents will accuse me of being antisocial. Help me out, please!"
What choice did Eleanor have?
With a helpless sigh, she deleted her previous refusal and simply replied, "Fine, I'll go."
###Chapter 61 What's So Funny, Lillian


The eighteenth came sooner than expected.

No sooner had they stepped out of the sports car than Lillian dragged Eleanor straight into the banquet hall.

So Jonny and Lainey tied the knot, huh? As if anything was official without Eleanor in attendance.

Clad in an elegant ink-hued couture gown and sporting bold red lips, Eleanor was destined to outshine Lainey.

The hall itself was a spectacle, gilded, over-the-top, the kind of decor that practically shouted for attention.

Eleanor's gaze swept the room without interest. She was unimpressed by the flashy décor.

It was obvious that this kind of grand extravagance was Vickie's idea.

As she thought about Vickie's endless scheming, Eleanor's lips curled with a trace of amusement.

When two scheming women clashed, who would come out on top?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a chorus of whispered gossip nearby.

"Isn't that Jonny's ex-wife? What's she doing here?"

"Showing up on her ex-husband's wedding day, she's bold, that's for sure!"

"She's probably here to make a scene."

Lillian tensed, ready to snap back, but Eleanor gave her a gentle tug, stopping her.

They had made it this far; no amount of whispering would make Eleanor turn back now.

In the end, it was nothing more than a group of small-minded gossips hoping to stir up drama.

While greeting guests, Jonny immediately spotted Eleanor's arrival. Why was she here?

Hle was sure he hadn't sent her an invitation. Who had taken it upon themselves to let her in?

Maybe she still had feelings for him and tagged along with Lillian, invitation or not.

The more Jonny convinced himself he had figured it out, the more self-satisfied he became.

He made a show of strolling over, hand in hand with Lainey, putting on an air of the devoted fiancé.

Before Jonny could move closer, Lillian called out in an exaggerated tone, "Miss Gilbert, is that the Enigma gown you had made just foryou? Absolutely...remarkable."

Eleanor kept silent, a subtle smile curving her lips.

On a day like this, crossing paths with Lillian could only spell trouble for Lainey.

The rest of the socialites, taking Lillian's words at face value, quickly chimed in.

"Oh yes, it's gorgeous."

"Miss Gilbert, your dress really is stunning."

"I've heard Enigma's work is nearly impossible to get. Mr. Todd must truly treasure you."

Lainey glowed with pride, certain that her ten million investment had paid off.

Jonny,too, savored the compliments.

He was grateful Lainey had the sense to commission an Enigma gown-otherwise, how would he ever have impressed these ladies of high society?

While the happy couple soaked up the compliments, Lillian slipped closer, flashing a sly grin. "I'm curious, is there any special meaning behind the dress?"

A special meaning?

When Lainey picked out the gown, she was simply drawn to its beauty. She had never given much thought to what it might symbolize. Still, with the spotlight on her, she needed an answer.
After a moment's consideration, Lainey replied, "The dress features intricate web-like lace and winding serpent embroidery. It's meant to embody elegance, mystery, and an irresistible charm."
The guests seemed to ponder her words, but Jonny looked the most affected.

A memory flashed in his mind, a scene from their courtship, when Lainey would look at him with pure devotion in her eyes.

A wave of emotion swept through him, and his eyes softened as he looked at Lainey.
Meanwhile, beside them, Lillian was doing her best not to burst out laughing at Lainey's explanation.
She had been trying to find a way to bring up the meaning behind the lace and serpent details, but Lainey had walked right into it herself.
Lillian couldn't tell whether Lainey genuinely had no clue about the symbolism, or if she was just pretending.Leaning into Eleanor, Lilian chuckled for a moment, about to make a witty remark when a familiar voice interrupted. "What's so funny, Lillian?"

Ryland and Nolan strolled in, their confident, commanding presence immediately drawing every eye in the room.
###Chapter 62 Look At This Dress!


Eleanor's eyes flickered in Nolan's direction almost on instinct.

The moment her gaze collided with Nolan's, a jolt of surprise ran through her, and she instantly averted her eyes.

Nolan seemed to have made it his mission to haunt her lately.

She couldn't wrap her head around how the head of the Stewart Group managed to find so much spare time.

Lillian, entirely unaware of Eleanor's unease, grabbed Ryland's hand and said cheerfully,"Ryland, look at this dress! Isn't it gorgeous?"

Ryland glanced over, nearly laughing out loud.

With a perfectly straight face, he played along. "Hmm, there's definitely some unique symbolism there.Quite impressive."

His tone suggested a compliment, but there was an underlying note of irony.

Nolan let his gaze linger on Eleanor for a moment before turning his attention to Lainey.

He finally offered a verdict. "Hmm.. she wears it like a saintly figure draped in shadows."

If he hadn't given Eleanor those loaded glances beforehand, people might have believed he was genuiely praising Lainey.

But there was an unspoken weight to his glances.

Whispers of old scandals immediately sprang to mind for everyone nearby.

Lainey truly fit the image; after all, she had taken Eleanor's husband.

Who else could play the part of a saintly figure shrouded in darkness? That meek,sorrowful act of hers made it all the more convincing!

Jonny's face clouded with frustration.

They were openly sabotaging his big day!

But with the Stewart and the Brooks families wielding so much power, he was in no position to retaliate.

If he had known it would turn out like this, he never would have invited them to win them over.

Now, he was paying the price for his own ambition.

Lainey's flawless makeup did nothing to hide the flush of embarrassment burning across her cheeks.

Ten million had gone into that dress, only to become the butt of a joke!

Nolan was siding with Eleanor and twisting the knife on purpose!

Lillian caught sight of Lainey's mortified look and knew exactly what was running through her mind.

She leaned in, taking full advantage of the attention, and added in a sweet voice, "If we're being honest, the gown is gorgeous, but the one in it... not quite as impressive."

Rage bubbled up inside Lainey, and if Jonny hadn't been gripping her arm, she likely would have lashed out at Lillian right then and there.

Even though frustration simmered beneath the surface, Jonny managed to keep his composure.

If he couldn't challenge them directly, the best option was to retreat gracefully.

He mustered a strained smile. "Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, please enjoy the celebration. Lainey and I have some things to attend to, so we'll excuse ourselves."

With the couple moving away, the rest of the guests slowly began to scatter as well.

Nolan now had a clear line of sight to Eleanor, who looked especially stunning tonight.

Feeling his unwavering attention, Eleanor grew a bit uneasy. Eleanor was about to pull Lillian along whena voice rang out in front of them.

"Nolan..." Emma's tone was so sweet it was almost nauseating.

Great, so much for a quick escape.

There was clearly more drama ahead.

Eleanor and Lillian shared a knowing look, stopping in their tracks at the same moment.

Jealousy then flickered in Emma's eyes as she glanced their way, but she quickly masked it behind a dazzling smile.

Drawing closer, she pretended to stumble and let out a theatrical gasp, aiming to fall right into Nolan's arms.

Trying to fling herself at Nolan?

Really?

But Nolan had zero patience for that kind of performance.

A look of clear annoyance flashed in his eyes as he quickly moved aside.

"Ah!" Emma tumbled to the floor, and her glass of red wine splattered perfectly across her dress.

Disaster, served up for everyone to see.

Eleanor couldn't resist a quiet chuckle.

Nolan always had an army of admirers chasing after him, and this top fan was pulling out all the stops.

Eleanor casually folded her arms, eyeing Nolan with an amused, knowing look.

When their eyes met, Nolan's lips twisted into a sly grin, a playful glint lighting up his expression.

For a moment, his usual polished expression vanished, replaced by something far more irreverent.
###Chapter 63 Lainey's The One In The Spotlight Today!


Emma was overwhelmed by pain.

Pushing herself off the floor with a pained expression, she leaned toward Nolan and whispered in a sweet tone, "Nolan, I'm really hurting. Won't you rub it for me?"

Lillian broke into uncontrollable laughter.

Really? That tired trick?

Did Emma honestly think Nolan was some clueless schoolboy who would fall for it?

Nolan's reaction was immediate-his look of disgust deepened, leaving no doubt about what he thought.

Heat rushned to Emma's cheeks, the sting of humiliation twisting quickly into rage.

She slammed her heel against the floor and snapped through clenched teeth, "Eleanor, don't act so pleased with yourself! Lainey's the one in the spotlight today!"

That reminder seemed to revive her boldness.

"Humph! Besty Juarez from the Enigma Group is coming too. Lainey's gown was custom-made by her.I doubt a country bumpkin like you has even heard of Enigma!"

What did it matter if Eleanor had managed to stick close to Lillian and Nolan?

In the end, she was still Jonny's castoff, a woman thrown aside without hesitation.

She didn't belong here. She didn't deserve Nolan's attention.

To Emma,Eleanor would always be nothing more than a country bumpkin pretending to fit in.

Emma's nails dug into her palm as fury twisted inside her. She would rip off that mask and show everyone exactly what kind of bitch Eleanor really was. "I see." Eleanor's reply came smooth and deliberate, her lips curving into the faintest smirk. "And what exactly does that prove?"

Emma's chest tightened with fury, the casual dismissal nearly knocking the breath from her.

How dared this bitch act so unbothered?

Did she truly not take Besty seriously?

She really was nothing more than an ignorant country girl pretending to belong.

Before Emma could snapback, a voice rang out from the crowd, sharp with exctement. "Besty's here!"

The spectators shifted instantly, clearing a neat path through the gathering.

A poised woman in a tailored suit strode forward, her presence commanding attention. Several assistants trailed close behind, underscoring her authority.

It was Besty-head of Enigma's Elepdon branch.

Emma's eyes brightened as if salvation had arrived. Straightening her posture, she hurried forward and put on her most flattering smile. "Besty, thank God you're finally here! You won't believe the arrogance I've just witnessed. Someone thinks Ms. Brooks' support gives her the right to dismiss you-and Enigma itself!"

Emma threw her hand out, pointing squarely in Eleanor's direction.

"She even pushed Ms. Brooks to mock Enigma's entire design philosophy! She said Lainey's dress carries a terrible meaning. People like her don't belong here. You can't just ignore this. Honestly, I think Enigma should blacklist her completely-make sure she never buys another piece from you again!"

Her voice rose higher with every word, her outrage feeding on itself.

Besty's expression tightened as she listened, her eyes narrowing while she turned to follow where Emma was pointing.

The sight nearly made her knees give out.

That wasn't just some guest-it was Enigma. The founder. The hidden force behind Enigma Group itself. The others might stil be blind to Eleanor's true Identity, but Besty cotad never mistake hee.

Years ago, when she was nothing more than a salesghl iy ono of Enigma's bortiquies, that very woman hed pluckod her from obscurlty and set her on the path that fed to her cirtont post.

Forgest ignoring her. Even i Eleanor ohose to grind her under her heet, Besty wouldn'e dare so much ad breathe a complalrt.

A cold sweat broke aoross Besty's forehead.

She stepped forward, ready to greet Eleanor, when a floeting look from her stopped her cold. That subtle,knowing glance carried a clear message-Eleanor had no intention of revealing who she really was.

ft her perfectly; the woman had aways moved in shadows, never craving the spotllght.

If she wlshed to remain unseen, then she would play along.

Masking her shock, Beaty smoothed her expression and swiveled back toward Emma. "Miss Todd,you can't be serious. Perhaps you've had a little too much to drink, because what you're saying is nothing but foolishness."

Emma was certain she had just outmaneuvered Eleánor.

She had no idea that her own words were about to come back and destroy her in front of everyone.
###Chapter 64 I'm Terribly Sorry


Emma felt a jolt of shock.

Besty should have been on the Todd family's side, so why was she defending Eleanor?

As her mind scrambled to make sense of it, Lainey approached alone, moving confidently through the crowd.

Jonny was still mingling with the men, sipping his drink, completely oblivious.

It didn't matter.

Today, this was her stage.

Lainey offered a polite smile and greeted, "Besty, it's good to see you here."

Besty wasn't great at remembering faces, and she didn't immediately place Lainey.

But the dress? That she recognized instantly.

It was the same gown she had recently sought Eleanor's special permission to handle.

Eleanor had quoted ten million for it-a price she rarely entertained for any project.

So Lainey must be friends with Eleanor.

Otherwise,why would Eleanor have told her to attend the wedding?

Quickly, Besty composed herself, bowing her head slightly. "Miss Gilbert, congratulations. I apologize for coming so abruptly without a gift. I promise to visit soon and make it up to you and Mr. Todd with a token of my appreciation."

The guests around them were taken aback.

Besty from Enigma Group spoke with such courtesy to Lainey? All those whispers about their closeness must have been true!

Lainey let herself bask in the moment, savoring every second.

Spending that ten million had been worth it; she could practically feel Elepdon's elite social circles opening up to her.

Eleanor would no longer dare mock her.

Maintaining her composure, Lainey smiled graciously. "You're far too kind, Besty. It's such an honor that you could attend my wedding despite your busy schedule."

Besty gave a quick nod, but her gaze immediately flicked toward Eleanor.

She blinked subtly, as if silently asking, "Boss, did that work for you?"

Of course, Nolan noticed it all. His earlier suspicions seemed to be confirmed. How many more of Eleanor's tricks were still hidden?

Eleanor felt his gaze burn into her back and frowned.

Would he ever stop staring?

Nolan met her eyes directly, lifting his eyebrows, almost as if to say,"I've seen through you."

Eleanor's heart skipped a beat.

Did he have some kind of X-ray vision?

She and Besty had only exchanged a glance.

This had to be a trick;

he was just trying to get under her skin.

Deciding it was safer to ignore him, she turned away, refusing to meet his gaze.

But Emma, witnessing the charged moment, couldn't hold back her fury. On impulse, she snatched a glass of wine from a passing waiter and flung it at Eleanor.

Then,pretending to be shocked, she held her chest."Oh, Eleanor! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't manage to hold it right. You're so gracious; I know it's fine, isn't it?"

She had used this stunt countless times over the past three years, and Eleanor had never once reacted.

Even now, cozying up to the Stewart and the Brooks families, Eleanor was still that same foolish girl.

But suddenly, red wine spilled everywhere.

Emma froze, staring at the empty glass in Eleanor's hand.

This wasn't possible.

How dared she?

This was her brother's wedding!

"Eleanor, I'll kill you!" Emma screamed, charging forward without a second thought. ###Chapter 65 This Is All Your Fault, You Bitch!


Eleanor didn't budge, but Nolan subtly moved to stand in front of her, like a protective barrier.

Emma, suddenly realizing Nolan was there, froze mid-step. "Nolan! She's picking on me!"

Her voice was a mix of indignation and disbelief. She was still caught in her own dramatic fantasy.

Lillian, finally losing patience, folded her arms and gave Emma a sharp, evaluating look. "Miss Todd, maybe check yourself in a mirror before running to Nolan crying,"

she said, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

Then, with a cruel edge, she added, "Honestly, you look absolutely ridiculous right now."

Compelled almost against her will, Emma grabbed a mirror. One quick glance and her face went pale.

Her makeup had completely melted, and smears of color ran across her cheeks and forehead. It was a total disaster.

Ugh!

How was she supposed to face anyone like this?

"This is all your fault, you bitch!" she yelled, her hands over her face, her eyes shooting daggers at Eleanor.

The noise and chaos immediately drew Jonny's attention.

He gestured to the guests to stay back and made his way toward the scene.

Seeing Emma's ruined appearance, Jonny frowned. "What in the world happened here?"

Lainey, quick to seize the moment, pretended to be concerned. Still smiling, she handed Emma a tissue.

Her voice carried just enough emotion to sound genuine. "Jonny, I'm so sorry. I got so caught up talking to Besty that I didn't notice Emma." Lainey turned to look at Eleanor. "Miss Warren, I know you might still be upset with us, but today is our wedding-a happy day for all of us. Whatever grudges you have, you shouldn't take them out on Emma.She's still young. If she did something wrong, you could just talk to her instead of hurting her!"

Eleanor couldn't help but smirk, impressed by Lainey's talent for twisting the truth. "Lainey, I have to admit.You've gotten really good at turning things around to make yourself look innocent," she murmured.

As the two women squared off, ready to exchange sharp words again, Jonny felt his patience snap.

He shot Eleanor a hard look, his voice tight with frustration. "Eleanor, I get that my remarriage might bother you, but there's a line. You can't make things hard for Emma, and you definitely can't show up at our wedding like this.Apologize.Now."

Lillian, standing nearby, was barely containing her disbelief.

Could the whole Todd family really be this ridiculous?

The nerve of them! She shook her head, feeling her temper flare.

She shouted at Jonny, "You think Eleanor still have feelings for you? That's ridiculous. And what nonsense is this about crashing your wedding? You sent the invitations yourself. Have you already forgotten? Or maybe your new wife stirred up trouble with Eleanor behind your back, and you were clueless?"

She added, "And let's not forget-it was your sister who splashed wine on Eleanor first! And now you expect her to just stand there? You're all such clueless fools!"

If Lillian weren't a woman of high standing, she might have spat in his face on the spot.

Jonny, meanwhile, felt his face heat up with embarrassment and frustration. He wasn't sure if Lillian was speaking the truth or just trying to stir conflict between him and Lainey.

His mind reeled, leaving him frozen in indecision.

And yet, it was the Brooks family.

He couldn't risk offending them. Besty, who had been quietly observing the chaos, finally pieced it together.

So Lainey wasn't really Eleanor's friend-she had been a rival all along.

That meant everything she had thought before was completely wrong.

Before she could process it further, Emma clung to her arm, her voice full of urgency and desperation."Besty! You have to help me! Before, you were kind and didn't want to stoop to Eleanor's level, but now look at her! She's taken advantage of me and bullied me even more! You have to teach her a lesson for me!"

Besty froze for a moment.

No way was she going to drag herself into this mess just because of Emma.

Not happening.
###Chapter 66 Making A Scene Won't Change A Thing


Besty removed her hand from Emma's grip in terror.

"Miss Todd, I don't actually know you, so mind how you speak," Besty said.

Emma blinked in shock. "Besty! How can you say that? You're supposed to be close to my sister-in-law!"

Eleanor could hardly believe Emma's cluelessness.

At the same time, Lillian folded her arms, her eyes fixed on the scene, clearly waiting for the drama to happen.

Besty quickly explained, worried Eleanor might get the wrong idea, "You mean Miss Gilbert, right? I barely know her. She just claimed she spent $10 million at Enigma Group, called herself our top VIP, and insisted l come. Otherwise,I wouldn't be here."

It wasn't personal. Eleanor had told her to come.

Otherwise, even if Lainey had splashed out a hundred million, she wouldn't have bothered.

These folks were completely out of touch with the real world.

The crowd went quiet instantly.

Wait, Lainey wasn't friends with Besty at all?

Besty didn't even know her?

Some rich women's faces darkened instantly.

They had never needed to ask for favors before.

And here they were, bending over backward for Lainey just because of Besty, and now this? Ridiculous.

Lainey instinctively recoiled under all the angry, scrutinizing eyes. To make matters worse, Jonny looked genuinely furious.
His eyes blazed with anger as he glared at her.
He had been counting on Lainey to leverage Enigma Group for some valuable connections, but instead,not only was the ten million gone, but also their family's reputation had been completely ruined!
Lainey...he had to admit, she had a way of getting under his skin.
Watching the couple about to clash, Lillian felt a secret thrill.
She lifted her chin and addressed Lainey, speaking louder on purpose.
"Wait a minute... you and Besty weren't even friends? So all this time you were just using her name to show off?"
If Besty's comment had embarrassed Lainey, Lillian's statement practically nailed the lie in front of everyone.
The socialites, realizing they had been played, erupted with anger, demanding Lainey explain herself.
Jonny rubbed his temples in exasperation.
How on earth had a simple wedding turned into this disaster?
He spun toward Eleanor, his gaze dark and unwavering."Look, I get it. You're upset, but it's done. Making a scene won't change a thing."
He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. "Just calm down, don't stir trouble, and I'Il make it right later."
Eleanor blinked in disbelief. Was he seeing things?
What made him think she was making a scene, and that she still cared for him?
Had he completely ignored Lillian's words?
Meanwhile, Lainey was boiing with jealousy.
She had heard what Jonny said. He still had feelings for Eleanor!

So where did that leave her?

Before she could react, a cold, teasing voice cut in. "Really, with me here, do you think she'd still be interested in you?"

Nolan had approched Eleanor.

His eyes flicked toward Jonny, flat and dismissive, like he was watching a fool make a scene.

Jonny froze.

Nolan, of all people, openly claimed interest in Eleanor in front of everyone?

It was practically a challenge thrown in his face.

It made no sense. Eleanor wasn't the kind of woman people fought over.

She wasn't glamorous like Lainey, and even Emma outshone her by miles.

How could Nolan possibly single her out?

Neither Jonny nor Eleanor could figure out what Nolan was doing.

His words were only causing more confusion than anything else.

Wanting no part of it, Eleanor decided she had had enough.

She grabbed Lillian by the arm and theý made their way towards the exit, ignoring the chaos around.them.
###Chapter 67 She Won't Escape Me


The instant Eleanor and Lillian left the hotel, the noise of the hall fell away.

Lillian spun around, eyes wide with mischief, and all but exclaimed, "Eleanor, don't tell me Nolan just confessed to you!"

Eleanor clapped a hand over her friend's mouth, flustered. "Cut it out! He was only lending me a hand. Don't make it sound like something it's not."

Her hand dropped as her expression turned firm. "Honestly, romance is the last thing on my mind. What I want is to keep Hope House running-and maybe even open more so more kids can have a safe place."

That was her truest priority, the only goal that felt worth chasing.

Lillian knew Nolan's reputation well. He wasn't exactly famous for kindness, which made his behavior toward Eleanor even more puzzling.

But seeing how serious Eleanor was, she swallowed her teasing and slipped her arm through her friend's instead. With a grin, she said, "Fine, I won't push. If you're building more orphanages, then I'm all in-money,effort,whatever it takes."

She then continued, "But you, missy, also need a break. Come on, let's go. I'm dragging you out for some fun before you bury yourself in work again!"

Lillian's gleaming purple convertible tore down the street, the engine growling until it finally vanished from sight.

By the time Nolan and Ryland stepped outside, the air was still heavy with the stench of exhaust.

Ryland tipped his sharp jaw upward, clicking his tongue in amusement.

With a sly grin, he bumped his elbow against Nolan. "Well? You're not going after Eleanor? She sped: off because of you.Perfect chance to explain yourself-and who knows, maybe win her over while you're at it." It was true. Nolan had been a breath away from blurting out that he liked Eleanor-far bolder than usual.

His eyes lingered on the empty stretch of road, unreadable.

Only after a long silence did he finally shift his gaze back, the corners of his lips curving slightly. "No need.She won't escape me."

Ryland arched a brow, intrigued.

Confidence like that didn't come from nothing-and if Nolan was this certain, then Eleanor was already his in one way or another.

Ryland's worry turned out to be pointless.

What had unfolded today would spark delight for some yet leave others bitter.

If the rest of the Stewart family caught wind of it, their reactions would be far from simple.

Thanks to the scandal, Jonny and Lainey's wedding collapsed into a public farce, whispered about all over Elepdon.

Lainey shut herself indoors for days, too humiliated to show her face.

Even worse, Jonny never came home after the wedding night.

He vanished completely-ignoring her calls, leaving her messages unread, as though she didn't exist.

And every bit of it, in Lainey's mind, was because of Eleanor.

Her nails dug into her palms as she fumed. Why couldn't she measure up to that woman?

Why did everyone jump to Eleanor's defense?

That bitch walked around unbothered, even with Hope House on the brink of being forced out. Not a trace of worry showed on her face.

Lainey clenched her teeth. Could Eleanor already have found another location?

No-impossible. Elepdon's housing prices were outrageous. Even if she did find a land, there was no way she had the money to pay for it.

Lainey's doubts never found answers.

No one in their wildest dreams would have believed that Nolan had outright handed Eleanor an entire plot of land.

If the truth came out,people would look at her in a very different light.

But land wasn't the only thing he gave away. He gave his time.

Day after day, Nolan remained at the orphanage, personally supervising the new building as if it were his own project.

Ryland finally lost patience. "Nolan, chasing after a woman doesn't mean you have to tie balloons and run errands like a volunteer."

Nolan lifted his eyes with a calm that cut like ice. "And that right there explains why your parents keep fretting about your future."

Ryland nearly choked.

Was this really Nolan-the aloof, untouchable man he had known for years?

"Alright, alright, I get it," Ryland muttered, throwing up his hands. "Just don't blame me if your grandfather blows a fuse when he realizes you're skipping the company."

He stalked off, shaking his head.

Left behind, Nolan rose slowly, his gaze drifting toward the window. Inside, Eleanor was laughing with the children, her warmth filling the room in a way that tightened something deep in his chest.

Time spent with Eleanor carried a rare ease, a comfort Nolan hadn't felt in years.

It gave him a reason to remain by her side without forcing the closeness.

Over the past few days, she no longer held him at arm's length. Her guard had eased-not because she trusted him fully, but because he never pressed where she didn't want him to.

He let her keep her secrets. That alone was enough to let him stay within her circle.

And once someone crossed into the realm of "friend," Eleanor treated them with a quiet courtesy.

Until Hope House finished its relocation, that fragile understanding bound them together.

Fannie's heart fluttered with excitement. Could Eleanor really become her sister-in-law one day?

The idea lit up her imagination, a wish planted deep inside her chest.

But for now, it remained nothing more than a fragile dream.

Eleanor stood before the freshly completed orphanage, satisfaction softening her expression.Extending her hand, she said with quiet formality, "I appreciate your help, Nolan."

Nolan's gaze dropped to her offered hand, his brows arching with faint amusement.

After a pause, he clasped it lightly, his voice low. "No need for thanks. I've got my own reasons."

Eleanor pulled her hand back, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. Instinctively, she asked, "What reasons?"


A glint of satisfaction flickered in his eyes.

Leaning just a little closer, he said in a deliberate drawl, "Because I want to stay near you."

It was as close to a confession as he had ever given.

Caught off guard, Eleanor quickly deflected. "Don't joke like that. Anyway, remember the ribbon-cutting ceremony the day after tomorrow."

Before he could reply, she turned and hurried off, her retreat almost too quick.

Nolan watched her go, a slow, knowing smile curving his lips.

"Eleanor, once I decide to pursue you, running won't save you," he muttered under his breath.
 ###Chapter 68 We've Traced The Source


The morning of the ribbon-cutting ceremony dawned clear, sunlight pouring down like a blessing.

Everything unfolded without a hitch.

Myah beamed as she and the children stepped into their new home, their laughter filling the air with warmth.

Yet, while joy spread in one place, bitterness brewed elsewhere. Inside the Todd family's vila, Lainey's mood soured with every passing minute.

Her glare fixed on the television, teeth grinding as Eleanor's face filled the screen.

There she was-standing among children, her smile poised, her presence effortlessly radiant.

But why?

What gave Eleanor the right to stand there looking so polished, so untouchable?

Lainey's eyes narrowed at the dress draped elegantly over Eleanor's figure. Wasn't that an Enigma design?

Driven by suspicion, she pulled up Enigma's website on her tablet, scrolling through the latest collection.

She hadn't expected much-certainly not confirmation.

But there it was. The very same dress, listed as this season's release, carried a price tag of no less than five million.

Eleanor had been cast out of the Todd family. Where in the world had she found the means to afford something like that?

Lainey racked her brain, circling the question again and again, but no matter how long she stewed, no answer came.

One conclusion settled firmly in Lainey's mind-Eleanor's wealth couldn't be clean. Her gaze lingered on the television screen, and a twisted idea began to sprout, spreading like wildfire in her thoughts.

If Eleanor insisted on making life difficult for her, then she would return the favor tenfold. Eleanor would know no peace.

By that afternoon, her scheme was already in motion. An anonymous post exploded onto the trending charts, its headline crafted to ignite fury."Hope House ribbon-cutting? Orphans' donations funneled into private pockets?"

The post featured a glossy photo of Eleanor at the ceremony, her designer dress front and center as if it were Exhibit A.

Attached beneath were a string of grainy screenshots, allegedly showing Hope House's expense records,with a suspiciously large amount of money unaccounted for.

The reaction was immediate. The Internet boiled over with anger.

"Who is this woman? How shameless must she be to steal from an orphanage?"

"Absolutely disgusting-this is evil, plain and simnple!"

"People like her shouldn't just be exposed; they should be thrown straight into prison!"

Many netizens wasted no time digging into Eleanor's background, piecing together fragments until her past stood exposed for all to see.

"Wait-she grew up in the orphanage herself? She, of all people, should understand how vital those donations are. For her to take from the children is beyond cruel!"

"No wonder Jonny Todd got rid of her! If he'd stayed married, the entire Todd Group would've been dragged straight into scandal.".

···

The comments piled on endlessly, each more vicious than the last, drowning the feeds in venom. Lillian's blood boiled as she scrolled. Every word felt like a slap.

Did these people seriously believe Eleanor would stoop so low as to steal scraps from the very place she supported with her own money?

She couldn't contain herself any longer. Her fingers flew over the keyboard.

"Utter lies! Eleanor donates tothe orphanage-she doesn't take from it! Why would she bother embezzling when she gives her own money? Stop spreading garbage!"

But her defense barely made a ripple. Within minutes, her comment was buried under a wave of fresh attacks, the trolls multiplying like someone had deliberately thrown fuel on the fire.

Clearly, this wasn't just gossip spiraling-it was orchestrated. Someone was pulling strings.

Lillian didn't waste a second before firing off a message to Ryland's assistant. "Trace the IP of whoever posted this filth. I want to know exactly who's behind it."

Her jaw tightened. Whoever dared to smear Eleanor like this wouldn't get away with it.

While waiting for a response, she kept refreshing the thread, scrolling furiously through the comments.

Not a single person defended Eleanor. Not one.

What was wrong with these people?

Were they all blind-or just plain stupid?

She was seconds away from unleashing her own tirade when a new notification appeared. Someone had finally spoken up.

The name stopped her cold-Besty.

From Enigma's verified account, a bold statement appeared. "The gown worn by Miss Warren at the ribbon-cutting was an exclusive sponsorship from Enigma Group. Miss Warren has dedicated herself to Hope House for years, volunteering weekly and donating substantial funds. She is an example-to be admired,not slandered." Attached to the post were detailed records-receipts of Eleanor's donations, logs of her volunteer hours,proof stacked neatly for all to see.

Netizens might scoff at rumors, but no one dared question the authority of Enigma.

Their word carried weight, and their brand left no room for doubt.

Within minutes, the storm of insults flipped on its head. The comment section overflowed with praise, the hate drowned out by admiration.

Relief finally loosened Lillian's chest.

Watching Eleanor's name dragged through the mud had felt worse than being attacked herself.

Eleanor had been right to trust Besty-when the situation turned dire, Besty knew exactly how to strike back.


Just as Lillian allowed herself a brief breath, a new message pinged on her screen. "Miss Brooks, we've traced the source. The IP behind the original post-and several troll accounts stirring the comments-all lead back to the Todd family's villa. Also, you'll want to see this. Attachments included."

Lillian tapped the files open. Her lips curled into a sly grin as the images came into focus.

Perfect ammunition.

Without hesitation, she uploaded the screenshots and crafted her own post, each word aimed like a blade.

"Funny how some people love preaching about charity. Remember that wedding pledge-$5 million promised for poor children, but only $3, 000 delivered? Was that just sloppy bookkeeping... or a deliberate scam? Lainey Gilbert, would you like to clear this up?"

But Lillian wasn't done. Her fingers flew over the keyboard as she fired off another comment beneath the post.

"A little advice for whoever's been hiding behind screens and buying trolls-maybe clean up your own dirty laundry before smearing someone else. By the way, the legal notice is already on its way. Do check your mailbox." For good measure, she attached the traced IP address, leaving no room for denial.

There was no way Lainey could defend herself.
###Chapter 69 That's His Business With Eleanor


The Internet erupted like wildfire, comment threads exploding in every direction.

Unlike the noise of nameless netizens, Lillian's words carried weight-and the evidence she dropped hit harder than anything that came before.

Her screenshots were crisp, undeniable, nothing like the blurry fabrications from the earlier smear campaign.


Netizens might be quick to gossip, but they weren't idiots.

In seconds, the crowd realized they had been manipulated.

Lainey's Twitter page was instantly swarmed.

"So we've been tricked? Turns out Lainey Todd is the real villain!"

"Unbelievable-she even faked charity donations."

"Five million magically shrank to fifty thousand? That's not charity, that's daylight robbery."

"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the Todd Group had a hand in this too!"

...

Lillian scrolled through the chaos, satisfaction dancing on her lips-until her expression froze mid-smile.

It was as though time itself had stopped, a chill gripping her out of nowhere.

In the very next instant, Lillian's eyes flewwide, locked on her phone as if she couldn't believe what she was seeing.

Her face lit with shock, the kind that made her look as though the floor had shifted beneath her feet.

She shot up from the couch, jammed her feet into her shoes, and dashed into the kitchen, nearly skidding to a stop as she shoved her phone in front of Eleanor, who was calmly stirring a pot on the stove.

One name burned on the screen-Nolan.

He had actually reposted her call-out.

And worse, he hadn't left it at that.

"Eleanor Warren treats the world with kindness, yet shows no mercy to me."

The words were followed by a sorrowful emoji, dripping with wounded self-pity.

Eleanor's hand froze on the spoon, her mind momentarily blank.

At the same time, the comments beneath Nolan's post were exploding in real time.

"Hold on-did Nolan Stewart just post?!"

"Am I hallucinating, or is that really the head of Stewart Group?"

"You're not hallucinating! I've stalked his account forever, and he's finally alive online!"

"Wait, wait, is he hinting at Eleanor? Is this some kind of confession?"

"Wow, that came out of nowhere!"

"You mean the Todd family tossed her aside, and now the head of Stewart Group is the one declaring his love?"

How reckless could Nolan be?

A private confession would have been enough, yet he had to plaster it across social media.

Did it ever cross his mind what she might feel?

Eleanor forced herself to look away, feigning composure as the glow of the screen faded from her eyes.

Still, the warmth blooming in her cheeks betrayed her attempt at calm. With a sharp snap, Lillian shut her phone and squealed.

"Eleanor! Did you see that? Nolan Stewart actually confessed to you! He's the man every single woman in Elepdon is dying to marry! Oh my God, this is legendary, and I am living for it!"

In her excitement, Lillian's earlier worries evaporated.

For once, Nolan, the man who always avoided romance, had bared his feelings to Eleanor.

It suddenly felt like nothing could stand in the way of what they had.

Differences in status? Irrelevant.

The swarm of women vying for Nolan's attention? Meaningless.

Nolan and Eleanor seemed like they were made for each other. He carried himself with a cool, refined air,while she burned with independence and fire.

Lillian's squealing grated on Eleanor until she could barely take it anymore.

With a light tap on her friend's head, Eleanor said, "Dinner's ready. Quit making a fuss and sit down to eat."

Food, however, didn't hold a candle to the unfolding gossip.

Eyes sparkling with mischief, Lillian dialed Ryland. "Hey, is Nolan with you? I've got questions, and I'm dying to get a quote from him."

On the line, Ryland nearly choked on his coffee. "Are you out of your mind, Lillian? That's his business with Eleanor. You've got no reason to stick your nose in."

For the first time ever, he hung up on his sister without hesitation.

Some things were simply too personal to be dragged into her antics.

Almost immediately after Nolan's post went live, Norwood Stewart, his grandfather, was on the phone.

Nolan answered and entered the study. Out of curiosity, Ryland approached the study, and pressed his ear against the door,trying to eavesdrop their conversation. Though he couldn't catch a word of the exchange, Ryland guessed that it wouldn't be a pleasant conversation.
###Chapter 70 Wasn't The Disaster At The Wedding Enough
It didn't take long before Nolan stepped out of the study, with an unreadable expression on his face.
When his gaze met Ryland's, the air grew tense.
Ryland coughed lightly, trying to ease the mood. "So, did your grandpa lecture you?"
"Yes," Nolan replied.
Ryland nodded knowingly.
Of course, Norwood would never approve of a granddaughter-in-law like that.
After all, Nolan's family history was a scar etched deep. His father, Colson Stewart, had once been married to Reyna Freeman, a celebrated socialite from Elepdon and Nolan's mother.
Their marriage had started in harmony, full of promise, but everything fell apart when Ady Yates, daughter of a maid in the Freeman household, who had grown up alongside Reyna, got involved with Colson.
The affair tore the family apart. Reyna's heartbreak consumed her, and she ultimately ended her own life.
Nolan lost his mother, and worse, Colson's affection for him turned into neglect and cruelty once Ady gave birth to a son of her own.

It was Norwood who finally intervened, taking Nolan away and raising him under his direct care. Later, when Nolan proved his ability, Norwood even skipped over Colson entirely and handed the Stewart Group straight to his grandson.

To see Nolan, so usually reserved, almost indifferent, suddenly speaking of love was enough to rattle Norwood. He feared history repeating itself, feared Nolan losing himself the way Colson once had. That was why he had made the call.
As for Colson, his cruelty was beyond doubt. He had been living a carefree life in Zerovia with Ady and their son, completely abandoning Nolan.

But if there was one thing Nolan despised, it was pity.

Sensing the weight behind Nolan's silence, Ryland quickly lowered his gaze.

The man's aura had gone ice-cold in an instant, and Ryland nearly trembled under it. "Sorry, Nolan.I went too far. It won't happen again."

He cursed himself silently. What had he been thinking, eavesdropping like that?

While Ryland regretted his slip, across town at the Todd family's villa, Lainey was livid. She smashed her phone to the floor.

Damn it!

Of all times, why would Nolan choose now to confess to Eleanor?

How could someone as untouchable as Nolan possibly fall for a plain woman like Eleanor?

The thought was unbearable.

She couldn't allow it. No, she had to tear them apart.

If Eleanor truly ended up with Nolan, everything would be lost.

Lainey wore a groove in the floor with her pacing, trying to figure out her next move, when the villa door suddenly swung open with a loud bang..

It was Jonny.

And from the storm on his face, he was anything but calm.

Before Lainey could slip into her usual act of looking pitiful, Jonny was already towering over her, his shadow swallowing her up.

He grabbed her by the collar, his fury pouring out through gritted teeth."Look at the mess you've caused!Wasn't the disaster at the wedding enough? Why do you keep stirring things up? Now the whole Internet is dragging our family through the mud. Is that what you wanted?

He had done everything possible to avoid clashing with the Stewart and the Brooks families, yet Lainey couldn't keep herself from stirring the pot.

Did she think the Todd Group was untouchable? That no matter how badly she messed up, nothing would ever happen to it?

The anger blazing in his eyes made Lainey want to slap him, but she held herself back.

She hadn't secured control of the Todd Group yet, and crossing him now would only backfire.

So instead, she forced tears to her eyes and crumpled into her pitiful routine. "Jonny, I swear it wasn't me.l didn't post anything. It was Lillian and Eleanor who set me up!"

There was a time when her tears would have cut right through him.

But now, he felt only a cold distance.

The evidence pointed straight to her, and still she refused to admit it.

How had he ended up married to someone so manipulative, so reckless?

Disgusted, Jonny shoved her away and stormed off toward the study withou a second glance.

Lainey dropped onto the sofa, her face twisting with hatred.

One day, she told herself, Jonny would regret ever treating her this way.
###Chapter 71| Know You Got The Invitation Too


Rage boiled in Jonny like never before.

Days had passed without him setting foot at home, his excuse always circling back to endless work.

Lainey, however, wasn't fooled for a second. She knew he was simply growing weary of her.

There was no way she could just wait around while everything slipped through her fingers.

Until she had full control over the Todd Group, Jonny still mattered.

While those thoughts tangled in her mind, a headline suddenly jumped out at her. "Enigma Group is about to hold a fashion design competition. Word is, the top three might even earn the chance to become Enigma's personal students."

The idea of being chosen as a student of Enigma sent her heart racing.

Such recognition was priceless.

With their backing, she could rise to the top of the fashion world in an instant.

If she had that kind of power, would Jonny's loyalty even matter anymore?

Her time studying fashion design overseas gave her confidence. A competition like this wouldn't intimidate her-it was an open door she was readý to step through.

Fueled by resolve, she wasted no time signing up for the competition. Afterward, she hurried upstairs to the study, eager to capture her ideas before the spark faded.

While she was rummaging through her supplies, a sheet of paper slipped free from a heavy notebook.

It wasn't blank. It was a sketch.

The design screamed sophistication, its elegance rivaling the signaure style of Enigma Group. Her mind spun with questions. Who could have drawn this?
Eleanor?
No,that was absurd.
She was just an orphan; what could she possibly know about design?

Forget it.

Fate had practically handed her this masterpiece.

With a few adjustments, the judges would be floored.

The thought alone sent a thrill through her. Heart racing, she sat down at the desk, her pencif scratching furiously across the page as she reshaped the sketch into her own.

Days later, in the Podium Apartments, Lillian's nerves betrayed her. She kept sneaking glances at Eleanor,who lay sprawled on the sofa, lazily flipping through a magazine. Words hovered on her lips, but hesitation kept them locked away.
Several days had slipped by since Nolan's confession, yet Eleanor hadn't once stepped outside her apartment.

This was unbearable. How could her favorite love story stall like this?

Lillian scooted closer and whispered, "Eleanor, I heard the fashion design competition your firm is hosting already narrowed things down to eight finalists, and one of them is supposed to be a genius. Honestly,you're incredible! Only you could think of such a clever way to promote Enigma while finding the best talent at the same time."

Eleanor flipped another page, her eyes still glued to the magazine. "Cut the sweet talk. What do you actually want?"

Panic bubbled in Lillian's chest. She needed to push Eleanor into the world again. Without bumping into Nolan, how could their romance possibly move forward?

As the self-appointed matchmaker, she was running out of tricks.

Then, the perfect solution popped into her head.

"Eleanor, Sallie's seventieth birthday is coming up in a few days. I know you got the invitation too. Why don't we go together?"

The Todd family had its flaws, but Sallie had always been different-kindhearted and generous. On top of it,Eleanor was in her debt.

It was impossible for Eleanor not to feel a tug at her heart.

Her hand stilled mid-turn of the magazine, though she didn't voice an answer right away.

Noticing the hesitation, Lillian leaned in and whispered, "Don't tell me you're nervous about bumping into Nolan?"

Eleanor gave a sharp laugh. "Me? Nervous? Please."

She just didn't feel like giving him another opening.

Honestly, she was not sure how she was supposed to deal with him.

Years of friendship had made Eleanor an open book to Lillian, and she could read every thought behind those words.

Armed with that knowledge, Lillian putsher plan into motion. "You can relax. I already checked-he left the country a couple of days ago and hasn't come back yet."

The second she heard that, Eleanor snapped upright from her lazy sprawl. "Fine, I'll go!"

After all, it was Sallie's birthday celebration.

She had every reason to show up, pay her respects, and checked in on Sallie.
###Chapter 72 Did You Catch Emma's Words


No one had imagined that Sallie's birthday celebration would turn into Lainey's carefully orchestrated showcase.

The moment Eleanor and Lillian entered the hall, Emma's excited voice rang out.

"My sister-in-law is absolutely amazing! You won't believe this-she just placed first in the preliminary round of the Enigma Group's fashion design competition! I've already secured a stack of tickets for the finals. You should come and see Lainey crowned as Enigma's apprentice!"

What?

Enigma's apprentice?

The very idea carried weight and prestige beyond measure.

As soon as the wealthy young women confirmed the rumor was genuine, they crowded around eagerly, their past grievances with Lainey swept conveniently aside.

Jonny stood proudly at Lainey's side, basking in the light she cast.

The shadows of recent days melted away like mist under the sun.

Lainey might have caused scandals, but in this moment, she handed him honor that outshone them all.

If she truly secured Enigma's apprenticeship, the Todd Group would ascend into an entirely new league of influence.

Lillian leaned closer, her lips twisting in doubt as she whispered to Eleanor, "Hard to believe a schemer like Lainey could actually have talent in design."

Eleanor lifted her glass, letting the champagne swirl lazily. "Maybe so. She did study fashion design abroad,after all." Lillian pressed her lips together and chose silence.
The competition's reputation spoke for itself-judges were impartial, the process transparent.
Lainey advancing to the finals meant she had genuine skill, at least on paper.
Even so, Lillian doubted the outcome would change anything. Winning a trophy was one thing. Being selected as Eleanor's personal apprentice was another matter entirely.
With no desire to linger near the spectacle, Lillian and Eleanor turned their attention to Sallie.
To their surprise, Sallie's complexion looked healthier, her energy noticeably brighter-perhaps because Lainey, consumed with her own ambitions, hadn't troubled her lately.
Eleanor offered her a few words of caution and care, then linked arms with Lillian, ready to leave.
Before leaving the party, she stopped briefly at the restroom.
But when she stepped back into the halway, her path was suddenly blocked.
Her gaze lifted, only to meet Jonny's self-satisfied grin, and irritation pricked at her instantly. "Please step aside," she said.
Jonny had clearly been waiting for this chance, and now that she stood alone, he had no intention of letting her go so easily.
Jonny tossed his head back with exaggerated confidence, his voice dripping with self-importance. "Did you catch Emma's words? It won't be long before the Todd Group rises higher than ever, and I'll be the shining figure in the city's upper circles. Didn't Besty Juarez show interest in you? If you use that connection to open doors for me, I'll make sure you live in comfort beyond your imagination."
In his narrow view, Eleanor was nothing more than a woman chasing wealth through Nolan.
He believed his own hype-that he was destined to embody influence and that her affection for him meant she would never refuse.
The smug curl of his lips deepened. "But don't get ahead of yourself. The title of my wife belongs to Lainey and Lainey alone. She'll be Enigma's chosen apprentice, and I'll stand by her no matter what. You'll just have to accept that."

What the hell?

Had the man lost his senses in a matter of days?

Eleanor could only stare at him in stunned disbelief. She finally said in sharp tones, "Move aside."

Turning on her heel, she started to walk past him without another glance.

His pride stung, Jonny's expression twisted. A wave of possessiveness surged through him as he seized her wrist and yanked her closer.

"Don't put on this act, Eleanor! I can see right through you. You still care about me-you're just being distant to keep me chasing, aren't you?"

The moment his words left his mouth, Jonny lunged forward, trying to force a kiss.

Eleanor's restraint shattered, every ounce of her patience gone.

A sharp glint of ice flickered in her eyes as she braced herself, ready to drive her knee into him.

But before she could make her move, another figure intervened first.
###Chapter 73 Be My Girlfriend


Out of nowhere, Nolan appeared, his fist landing squarely on Jonny's jaw. Jonny stumbled and hit the floor hard,caught completely off guard.

Nolan turned immediately to Eleanor, his eyes softening."Are you okay?"

Still stunned, she nodded. "I... I'm fine."

But her thoughts were a mess. Lillian had told her Nolan was abroad, so why was he here now? Had Lillian lied?

Before she could sort through it, Jonny pushed himself back up, blood smearing at the corner of his mouth.His glare was venomous. "Mr. Stewart, I was only dealing with my ex-wife. Don't you think you're overstepping?"

Nolan gave a short, icy laugh.

He crouched down until he was eye-to-eye with Jonny, his voice low and deliberate. "You're her ex-husband. And I'm her current..."

He stopped there, leaving the final word unspoken, though his meaning was clear. Eleanor would be his.

Jonny's bravado collapsed under Nolan's suffocating presence. He bit back any retort, swallowing his anger, though hatred simmered in his eyes.

He swore silently that one day, he would make Nolan pay for this humiliation.

But Nolan wouldn't have cared, even if he knew.

Todd Group could never match Stewart Group's power.

Meanwhile, Eleanor, flustered by the tension, used the chance to quietly slip away.

She found Lillian just as the party wound down. Sallie never showed her face all evening.

What was supposed to be her birthday ended up feeling like Lainey's stage instead, giving the guess plenty to whisper about.

Guests murmured that Sallie clearly despised Lainey if she couldn't even fake civility for her birthday.

Eleanor had no interest in the chatter. She tugged Lillian toward the door.

The last thing she wanted was another run-in with Nolan.

The longer she stayed, the riskier it felt.

But fate had other plans. Nolan was already waiting by the door.

Lillian, quick to sense an opportunity, excused herself at once.

Erick also drifted aside.

Eleanor was left alone with Nolan, unsure of what to do.

She gave him a stiff smile. "Nolan, thanks for earlier. I have something to take care of, so I'll be going."

However,Nolan didn't budge.

Instead,he leaned in, eyes locked on hers, his tone low and persuasive.

"I have a permanent solution for your ex-husband problem.Do you want to hear it?"

Her instincts screamed to refuse, but before she could get a word out, he closed the gap further, his breath grazing her ear as he murmured, "Be my girlfriend."

Her heart lurched.What kind of outrageous proposal was that?

She blurted out immediately, "Thank you, but I'm not looking for a relationship."

Nolan, unfazed, gave a calm reply. "Then I'll just move to Plan B."

A chill prickled down her spine. Almost on cue, her phone buzzed. Heart sinking, she glanced at the screen, and there it was, on her WhatsApp, in bold letters: "Daily question: When will Eleanor agree to be my girlfriend?"

Her face flushed with horror.

Was he seriously putting her on the spot like this?

She kept staring at the screen, utterly mortified.
###Chapter 74 And Who Even Knows If He's Serious


Nolan lifted his brows, putting on that innocent look of his.

"Think of it as my way of marking my territory," he said with a playful grin."At least now your ex will think twice before bothering you again."

Oh,so should she thank him for that?

Eleanor bit back a groan, forced a polite smile, and slipped out without another word.

She hopped into the first taxi she could flag down and blurted, "Please, hurry. Drive!"

She acted as though something terrifying was right on her heels.

Not too far off, Erick was still frozen in disbelief, his jaw practically on the floor.

He edged toward Nolan, testing the waters with a cautious, "Boss, aren't you going after her?"

Nolan didn't move. If anything, his grin only grew more cunning. "No hurry," he drawled.

After all, some things couldn't be rushed.

Push too hard, and she would only run further.

By the time Eleanor made it back to herapartment, she was finally catching her breath.

That was when Lillian popped up, grinning like she had been waiting all day for this.

"Weli, well, I saw Nolan's post. So, when will you agree to be his girlfriend?"

Eleanor shoved her aside, grabbed a glass, and poured herself some water.

"He's decent, I won't deny that. But my hands are full right now. Between my career, the orphanage, and trying to help more kids, I don't have room for all that. " She sighed and muttered, "And who even knows if he's serious? Someone like Nolan wouldn't actually look twice at a divorced woman like me. He's probably just settling an old score from years ago."

But Lillian wasn't buying it.

She had known Nolan since childhood, and if there was one thing she was sure of, it was that the man didn't say things he didn't mean.

Twice he had confessed, and that wasn't something he would do for fun.

As she watched Eleanor sink into her doubts, Lillian's mind was already spinning with plans.

Over the next few days, she quietly sent a few messages Nolan's way.

And then, the following morning, Eleanor's phone buzzed with a message from Myah.

"A miracle happened last night. A generous company stepped in and donated several prime land plots along with a huge sum of money to Hope House. I was thinking, maybe this is the right time to open more branches? That way, we can welcome more kids. Drop by when you can and see for yourself, okay?"

Attached were pictures and official papers showing the transfer of ownership.

Eleanor scrolled through them, and her eyes widened.

Stewart Group?

And in such prime areas?

Was Nolan insane?

Moves like this would cost the company billions.

Surely his family wouldn't just sit quietly about it.

Her mind was in a blur of confusion, and before she knew it, she was opening Nolan's Facebook page as if something unseen had guided her there.

A fresh update stared back at her: "Still working on it."

Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

So he was serious? His confession was more than just a passing impulse?

Before she could process further, her phone rang, and Besty's name flashed on the screen. "Boss, the finals are next week, but we still don't have the final content locked in."

That instantly reminded Eleanor of Jonny's smug attitude yesterday.
She hadn't even seen Lainey's earlier drafts yet.

Whether Lainey had been cheating or not, everything would be clear in the final round.
Eleanor curved her lips into a faint smile and gave her instructions. "Tell every finalist that during the finals,they'll need to present a complete gown based on their earlier sketches. It has to be worn, either by themselves or on a model. That way we can judge their full ability."

"Got it."

After hanging up, Eleanor made her way/to Hope House.

What she found there surprised her even more.

The Stewart Group had already sent in a professional team.

They weren't just covering the construction, but they also had mapped out the project plan, secured workers, and even arranged long-term funding.

At this point, opening new branches barely needed her or Myah's involvement at all.
###Chapter 75 Are You Enigma


Moved, Eleanor wanted to thank Nolan.

Just as the Stewart Group staff were packing up to leave, the question slipped out before she could stop herself."Is Nolan around?"

Her voice had barely faded when a few of the suited employees froze, trading knowing looks with half-suppressed smirks.

Heat crept up Eleanor's neck.

Why had she blurted that out?

Now they would definitely be making assumptions.

Trying to brush it off, she quickly added in acasual tone, "I just thought, since he has done so much for the orphanage, I should thank him in person, maybe invite him to dinner."

The staff nodded as if they bought what she said, but their smiles told a different story.

By now, gossip had already taken root both inside the Stewart Group and all over Elepdon.

People were whispering that Nolan, the famously cold and untouchable man, was chasing after Eleanor,the divorcée.

Apparently, he was spending money left and right to get her attention, yet she seemed immune to all of it.

But with her slip just now, the rumor mill had been handed fresh fuel.

The team leader leaned in with a sly grin. "Miss Warren, if you want to see Mr. Stewart, you should probably reach out to him yourself. Someone like him isn't exactly within our reach."

The others chimed in with quick agreement, then bowed out politely, leaving Eleanor standing there,feeling rather awkward. Forget it.

She'd just thank Nolan the next time she bumped into him.

Reaching out first would only make him read too much into it.

Maybe he was really tied up with work, because after those little updates on Facebook, he hadn't shown up around her again.

Eleanor actually found some comfort in that.

Two days later, the big day arrived-the finals of the fashion design competition.

The event was held in the grand banquet hall on the first floor of Enigma's store.

At the main entrance, a red carpet stretched out, and the lively crowd filled the place with noise and energy.

Meanwhile, at the quiet back entrance, a sleek black van pulled in and came to a stop.

Besty, already waiting there, stepped forward as the door opened. She bowed slightly and said with crisp respect, "Boss, everything's ready."

Eleanor checked her watch and gave a simple nod."Let's move."

Together they avoided the main building, slipping into the private passage reserved for insiders.

Right when they rounded the corner near the entrance, Eleanor's steps faltered. Her eyes landed on Lainey,who had arrived for the competition.

She was dressed in a flowing pink pleated gown, the soft color making her stand out as she moved through the crowd like a butterfly with a trail of admirers behind her.

Eleanor froze. That dress... it rang a bell.

Before she could dwell on it, Besty spoke up again, gently pulling her back to the moment. "Boss, your lounge is upstairs on the second floor, If you need anything, I'll be right here."

"Okay," Eleanor replied, tearing her gaze away before heading upstairs. The lounge turned out to be exactly her taste-spacious, quiet, with a perfect view overlooking the lively hall below.

She leaned against the railing, her eyes scanning the sea of people, and then it clicked. That dress Lainey was wearing-it was one of Eleanor's own discarded designs.

She had once sketched it, decided it wasn't good enough, and shoved it between the pages of a notebook.

So that was where Lainey had fished it out.

A faint smile curled at Eleanor's lips. Things were about to get interesting.

Down below, Lainey stood in the middle of her admirers, soaking up the praise as if the spotlight belonged only to her.

With the way everyone's eyes followed her, she felt certain today's trophy had her name on it.

After so many unlucky breaks, luck was finally turning in her favor.

Then, a voice from the crowd cut through the chatter. "Miss Gilbert, your design looks so much like Enigma's style!"

The words spread like wildfire. Faces turned, and eyes narrowed in suspicion.

And now that people were really looking, it did carry Enigma's unmistakable touch.

Had Lainey copied Enigma's work?

Or was she actually Enigma?

The crowd seemed far more excited about the second possibility.

"That's right!" a woman added. "Miss Gilbert studied fashion overseas."

The woman turned to Lainey. "Miss Gilbert, why don't you just be honest with us? Are you Enigma?"
###Chapter 76 The Competition Is About To Start


Lainey was in a state of near panic, completely blindsided by the turn of events.

It was,in a way,perfect.

The plagiarism scandal had blown over, and to top it off, she had even been mistaken for Enigma.

Of course, she couldn't admit it outright.

Who knew when the real Enigma might appear?

She forced a weak laugh and protested, "How could that be? You girls really know how to joke around."

Her ambiguous response, however, said more than her words ever could.

The scene quickly turned chaotic, with compliments flying everywhere.

When Lillian arrived, she was utterly entertained by the absurdity unfolding.

Hell yes.

Let it get even messier.

The bigger the drama, the more amusing.

She was curious to see how Lainey would handle this in the long run.

With that, Lillian looked away and went upstairs.

When she met Eleanor, emotions naturally ran high.

After some polite conversation, Lillian got back to her matchmaking. "Nolan has done a lot for yòu lately.Don't you think it's time you gave him some thought? He has been a bachelor in his whole life, and he finally got a crush on someone." Eleanor nearly choked on her coffee, quickly clamping a hand over Lillan's mouth, °Quiet. The competiion is about to start."

Muffled and wide-eyed, Lilian could only blink and nod, signaling her compfiance.

Lainey secured first place.

Eleanor raised a brow and pressed the intercom."Listen up. I won't be taking on apprentices this year.And second and third place can join the company."

Besty froze in disbelief.

Not taking on apprentices at all was one thing, and that rumor had circulated before.

But skipping the first-place winner entirely to reward the second and third? That was unthinkable.

Still, she knew better than to question it.

Execution came first.

So she relayed Eleanor's message exactly as it was.

Lainey, who had been reveling in her victory, felt her face darken with rage.

What was the point of all her scheming and risks if this was the outcome?

Anger bubbled up inside her, and she was about to snap when laughter erupted from the crowd.

"Enigma! Your acting is so over the top!"

"Seriously, we all get it already!"

Acting?

What were they talking about?

Lainey paused, confused for a moment, until the word Enigma clicked in her mind.

Ah,they were still caught up in that earlier misunderstanding! A grin spread across her face as an idea struck her. She lifted her hands and formed a heart with her fingers toward the audience. "Love you all!"

She didn't verbally admit it, but thé gesture spoke volumes and was enough for the crowd to take it as a silent acknowledgment.

This was amazing!

Today,they had truly seen the real Enigmá in áction.

The moment Lainey stepped off the stage, she was swarmed by reporters.

"Miss Gilbert, did Besty's sudden announcement about not accepting apprentices come from your suggestion?" one shouted, with his camera flashing.

Before Lainey could answer, her passionate fans jumped in to explain.

"Of course! Miss Gilbert is Enigma herself. Who else would make that kind of decision?"

"Right! Think about it. Why would second and third place get rewards, but not the first? It makes perfect sense now."

"Enigma probably joined just for fun and didn't expect things to get so big, so she had to quickly change the rules."

Within moments; the crowd had pieced together a seamless argument.

Soon, everyone was convinced that Lainey was undoubtedly Enigma.

Yet, Lainey simply raised the microphone and said calmly, "No comment."

Sometimes silence says it all, and today, her words, or lack thereof, were a quiet confession.
###Chapter 77 Shouldn't We Expose Her


The situation was spinning completely out of control, and Besty could only watch in stunned silence.

She couldn't begin to understand how things had escalated so far.

But from the second floor, Eleanor had a clear view.

Since her boss wasn't moving a finger, Besty knew she couldn't either.

Resigned, she decided to walk away, leaving the mess behind.

Upstairs, Lillian was fuming. "Eleanor! Did you see that? She admitted it on purpose. Shouldn't we expose her?"

Eleanor shook her head, calm and collected. "Expose her and reveal my identity? That's pointless. She's not important enough to worry about."

Simply put, Lainey wasn't even worth Eleanor's attention.

Lillian's annoyance melted into adoration. On impulse, she leaned in and planted a kiss on Eleanor's cheek.

Startled, Eleanor darted away, escaping her playful affection.

By the time the competition wrapped up, two hashtags had already exploded across social media:#EnigmaldentityExposed and #EnigmaGroup'sDesignCompetition.

After years of mystery, the public finally believed they had caught a glimpse of the elusive Enigma.

Fans went wild, flooding Twitter until servers nearly buckled under the traffic.

Jonny,however, was even more thrilled than the fans.

He put down his phone, pulled Lainey close, and held her tightly, pressing a passionate kiss to her lips."Lainey, I'll be good to you from now on," he promised. Enigma!

His wife was Enigma, the legendary designer, unattainable to all, yet standing right here beside him.

He could hardly believe it.

Relief and pride swelled in him, knowing the company's troubles would be behind him and that humiliation was no longer looming.

Lainey secretly rolled her eyes, hiding her disdain behind a delicate act.

She acted shy, giving him a gentle push while speaking softly."JOnny, you're hurting me."

The plea melted him instantly.

His grip eased, and Lainey nestled closer, tracing lazy circles across his chest. "Seeing you so happy makes me happy too."

She continued, her eyes shimmering with fake tenderness, "But now that everyone knows who I really am,staying as your secretary might spark gossip. And I heard the CFO is retiring soon. so..."

She let the words hang, because the pause was louder than anything she could have said.

And Jonny, unwilling to let her down, nodded immediately. "I'll handle it with HR right away."

Satisfied, Lainey.no longer had the patience to fuss over him.

She rewarded him with a chaste kiss on the cheek and said, "No need to rush. I need a break too. The fans have kept me occupied all day."

With that,she swept upstairs.

The moment the door clicked shut, her gentle facade disappeared entirely.

If he had consistently treated her well, she might have spared herself the ruthlessness.

But knowing he still had feelings for Eleanor and had repeatedly belittled her for that stoked a fire within Lainey. She was determined he would pay for his ignorance.

However, before turning her attention toward the Todd Group, she knew she had to cement her public persona as Enigma.

A sly smirk crossed her face as she drafted a post. "Everything's aligning perfectly."

Alongside it, she shared a side-profile photo of herself taken backstage.

The dim lighting softened her smile, making it gentle.

To the fans, the tweet seemed like proof that she really was Enigma, and almost immediately the online community exploded with excitement.

"Wow, Enigma,you're stunning!"

"You're like a living fairy! Absolutely enchanting!"

"I knew it! Lainey is Enigma! That quiet strength in her eyes. It's unmistakable!"

Lainey leaned back, savoring the chaos she had sparked. These frantic admirers were so easy to sway.

Right then, her phone started buzzing with private messages.

They were all from Elepdon's high-society young women, who usually acted superior to everyone else.

"Enigma, please, I need a custom gown! Name your price!"

"Can I wear one of your pieces for my birthday next month? I'll pay anything!"

Lainey's eyes glittered with disdain as she scrolled through the groveling messages. They were nothing more than self-important sycophants now reduced to pleading.

Exactly the effect she.had intended.

With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.

Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet. With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.

Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet.

Her status as Enigma placed her far above these petty admirers.
###Chapter 78 Don't Underestimate Her


Lainey knew people, and how to bend their instincts, better than most.

Her carefully cultivated persona fit Enigma perfectly, and fans ate it up. They saw her every gesture, every expression, as proof of the legend they adored.

Some even went so far as to take aim at Lillian, eager to curry favor with Lainey.

"The donation mess? That's clearly Lillian stirring trouble!"

"Exactly! Enigma doesn't need to fake anything. One dress from her, and it's worth millions!"

A particularly zealous fan dug up photos of Lillian scolding Lainey at a party and shared them online,twisting the story for maximum effect.

Outrage erupted immediately, and before long, Lillian was drowning in criticism across social media.

The Brooks Group's official account didn't escape the backlash either. Comment after comment poured in.

"Lillian Brooks is abully. How could she treat Lainey like that?"

"Lainey's too kind. That's why she keeps getting walked over by people like Lillian!"

"Down with the Brooks Group!"

"Couldn't agree more!"

"I've never trusted Lillian. I once saw her with eight different men in one day. You know exactly what l mean!"


···

Meanwhile,Lillian was sitting at the Brooks bar, sipping her drink, completely oblivious to the chaos online.

It wasn't until she went to leave and found herself hemmed in by a crowd that she finally realized what was happening.

Bullying Lainey? That was absurd.

She had only ever spoken the truth!

A surge of anger shot through Lillian. She instantly rolled up her sleeves, ready to make her point, not caring that she was outnumbered.

However,before she could get a word out, people closed in around her.

The atmosphere was tense, and a clash seemed likely.

Seeing all that, the bar manager freaked out.

If anything happened to Lillian on his watch, it would be on him.

He barked orders, sumnmoning the security team. "Move! Get her out of here! Protect Ms. Brooks!"

The guards, all retired special forces, immediately sprang into action.

In no time, Lillian was escorted to a private lounge on the second floor, safe from the crowd.

Never had Lillian, a Brooks, felt so humiliated.

Her thoughts immediately turned to Lainey.

Seething,she cursed.Lainey and hoped her lies would be exposed so the online chaos would finally stop.

Grabbing her phone in frustration, she called her brother. "Ryland, I'm cornered at the bar by some wild Lainey fans. Send the bodyguards and get me out of here."

Ryland's worry was instant. "Stay put. Don't move. I'm on my way."

After hanging up, he muttered to Nolan, who was nearby, "Can you believe this? Lillian just said a few words supporting Eleanor, and now she's surrounded by Lainey's crazed fans! That woman can't possibly be Enigma. Honestly, at this point, I really wish Eleanor was..."

He suddenly stopped, not saying the last word, "Enigma," because even he thought it was silly. After all, Eleanor had grown up in an orphanage, far from high society. How could she design such luxurious dresses?

And if she truly were Enigma, why would she marry a loser like Jonny?

Nolan, reading Ryland's thoughts,remained calm.

He sipped his wine, placed the cup down, and offered a faint smile."D。on't underestimate her,"he said.

Eleanor was full of hidden depths, more than most realized.

Ryland chuckled wryly. "I wouldn't dream of it. I'm just... never mind. I'll go pick up Lillian."

With that, he grabbed his coat from the sofa and hurried out the door.
###Chapter 79 Lainey Plagiarized Enigma's Work
Word spread fast, and soon Eleanor heard that Lillian had been cornered.



At first, she had no plans to step in, let alone expose herself as Enigma. She would have rather sat back and watched Lainey embarrass herself. But what she didn't expect was for Lainey's fans to drag Lillian into the mess.



Lillian was the one person Eleanor refused to see harmed.



There was no way she would let anyone stain her reputation.



So,she pulled out her phone and hit send on a tweet."Lainey plagiarized Enigma's work."



Eleanor wasn't the type to throw out claims without evidence.



Along with the post, she attached the edited draft from earlier-the one signed, clear as day. Enigma. The reaction online was instant chaoS. Die-hard Enigma fans quickly chimed in.


"Oh wow, Eleanor might be telling the truth."



"That draft looks way better than Lainey's version."



"That's Enigma's signature, no doubt about it."


Still, the majority weren't hardcore fans. They were just casual followers who couldn't really judge art. In their eyes, Lainey was Enigma. She had the title, and that was enough.


So instead of support, Eleanor's comments section was flooded with attacks.



"Where would an orphan like you even get Enigma's drafts? You probably swiped them from Lainey."



"Exactly! Everyone knows you and Lainey don't get along.You're just bitter"



"You dare go against Lainey? Don't make me laugh."



"Waving around some random design and calling it proof? Wait till the lawyers come knocking!"







Meanwhile, Jonny had his eyes glued to the online storm. As he scrolled through the comments, a memory surfaced-Eleanor used to spend hours sketching in the study.



Back then, he assumed she was just idly passing the time.



But now, could it be that Lainey had stolen her designs all along?



Could Eleanor actually be Enigma?



No,that was ridiculous.



There was no way...or was there?



Jonny tried to brush the thought away, but a nagging uneasinessclung to him.



To clear his mind, he figured he would go straight to Lainey and ask her about it.



Without wasting time, he headed upstairs to look for her.



The moment Lainey saw him walk back into the room,her heart skipped.



Panic rushed through her. Why was he here now?


 
Wasn't he supposed to be buried in work in the study ? Did he... see Eleanor's post too? The idea made her pulse quicken.



Sure enough, Jonny paused for a moment, then asked,"Lainey, what's going on with that post Eleanor made?"



Lainey quickly steadied herself and met his eyes with a calm look. "Baby, strangers might doubt me, but you don't, right? That sketch was mine. I drew it years ago while I was abroad and sold it soon after. I never imagined Eleanor would buy it just to smear me."



She let out a quiet sigh, her expression softening into something more earnest. "Really think about it. If I wasn't the designer, how else could I have the original sketches and turn them into an actual dress?"



She wasn't sure how Eleanor had gotten her hands on the draft, but fear wasn't something she allowed herself.



From what she knew, the true Enigma was a foreigner who had disappeared from the spotlight three years ago.



Even now, the Enigma Group had stayed completely silent.



Clearly, Enigma had no intention of revealing their identity So why shouldn't she use this chance?



If she played her part right, she was Enigma. The thought gave her confidence.



Jonny,meanwhile, felt the knot in his chest loosen.



He was convinced now-Lainey had to be Enigma.



After all, if Eleanor were the real one, wouldn't she have said something years ago?



He even thought, if she had, maybe their marriage wouldn't have ended the way it did



Catching the relief in his eyes, Lainey wasted no time nudging him back toward the study


Once he was gone, she pulled out her phone and crafted another tweet, puttinng on just the right shade of wounded innocence. "The truth will stand on its own. I trust those who truly know me will continue to believe in me."
###Chapter 80 Welcome Back,Enigma
Lainey's post instantly set Enigma's fans on the attack,their urge to defend her erupting in full force.



The replies under Eleanor's tweet grew nastier by the minute, overflowing with cruel and biting remarks.



Lillian, barely able to contain her outrage, called Eleanor in a rush. "Eleanor, how long are you going to let her get away with this? When are you finally going to shut her down?"



She was fed up with Lainey's manipulations and couldn't tolerate another second



If Eleanor wouldn't step up, Lillian was determined to find someone who would.



The truth was. Eleanor had been thinking about making a move.



It would let her call out Lainey's behavior without revealing the fact that she was Enigma.



But now, she had another idea.



A sly, enigmatic smile appeared on her lips. "Right  now's the perfect moment."



Before Lillian could reply, Eleanor had already ended the call.



She jumped onto Twitter and switched to an account that hadn't posted in three years but still boasted tens of millions of followers.



Without much effort, Eleanor snapped a selfie, her expression calm but laced with quiet defiance.



With a tap, she shared the photo and let the tweet fly.



Ryland was the first to spot the new post.



His jaw practically hit the floor



"No way! Eleanor is actually Enigma?" he blurted out in disbelief.



For a moment, he questioned whether he was even awake.



Things only escalated when Besty, Enigma Group's brand director, immediately shared Enigma's tweet,adding,"Welcome back, Enigma."



That repost made it official that Eleanor really was Enigma.



The Internet exploded. "Are you kidding me? Was I actually trash-talking my favorite designer?"


"I can't believe how clueless I was.I want to crawl into a hole and disappear."



"How could I have insulted the real Enigma while defending a fake? I honestly deserve a slap."


"Enigma, I'm so sorry. We're not worthy of being your fans."



"I was wrong."



Fans flooded Eleanor's comments with tearful apologies, desperate to make amends.



Eleanor never cared what they thought, anyway.



Truthfully, if Lillian hadn't been attacked by online mobs,Eleanor would have never revealed herself



With a quick tap, she sent out another tweet. "Lillian is the one you owe an apology to. If not for her, Enigma would have stayed away."



Those two short tweets unleashed a fresh tidal wave online.



For a moment, the fans were caught off guard, but they soon understood exactly what Eleanor was getting at Eleanor was right, and if Lillian hadn't been targeted by trolls, Enigma would have stayed hidden, just as she had for the past three years.



It was their own actions that dragged Lillian into the mess and forced Enigma to reveal herself.



Fans found themselves deeply touched by the loyalty between Enigma and Lillian



To them, Enigma felt untouchable, as distant and flawless as the moon hanging in the night sky



They were almost afraid to bother her, worried their words would ruin the magic.



Instead, all their guilt and protective energy were redirected to Lillian, swearing to defend Enigma's best friend at all costs.



"To make up for it, I just placed ten orders from the Brooks Group website!"



Instantly, similar comments flooded in.



"Let's all shop together!"


"I'm officially switching my whole house to Brooks Group products!"



In no time, the Brooks Group's online store was completely wiped out by fans. Not a single item, down to the last toilet seat cover,was left in stock.



As a result, the Brooks Group's stock pice skyrocketed.
###Chapter 81 You Sound Green With Envy
Ryland never expected that the Brooks Group would be the biggest winner out of all this.



He couldn't resist bragging about it. Grabbing his phone, he dialed Nolan. "Nolan, jealous yet?" he teased.



There was a short silence before Nolan's cool,detached voice came through, "That's all it takes to excite you?"



Instead of being dampened, Ryland became even more animated."Oh, admit it.You sound green with envy. Eleanor just dropped a tweet, and our firm's value shot up by billions. Meanwhile, you've been pulling strings behind the scenes nonstop, but what's to show for it? Nothing."



The more he spoke, the more triumphant he sounded.so much so that he didn't even notice Nolan's silence stretching on.



When he realized his friend's silence, Ryland quickly softened his tone. "But credit where it's due, Nolan.You've got sharp instincts. The woman you like? She's extraordinary." That line finally eased Nolan's expression.


After ending the call, he opened his Facebook and posted one line. "I feel hurt."



Over at Eleanor's apartment, Lillian was sprawled on the sofa,scrolling through glowing fan comments with her.



The second she saw Nolan's post, she nearly leapt up.Shoving her phone in Eleanor's face, she squealed,"Look! Nolan says he's hurt because of you!"



Eleanor gave the post a glance, her lips twitching faintly.



Honestly, Nolan could be so childish.



"Don't give me that look!" Lillian laughed, nudging her with her elbow. "Seriously, why don't you just say yes to him already? Now that everyone knows you're Enigma, you two are basically the ultimate power couple!"



Eleanor calmly pushed her head aside. "I've got no time for romance. I'm busy planning a charity foundation to help orphans across the country."



Lillian pouted. "Keep denying it all you want. But if another woman snatches him up, don't come crying to me." While Eleanor wasn't crying, Myah was almost in tears.



Ever since Eleanor's identity came out, Hope House had been overrun by reporters.



"Ms. Sutton, how did you raise such a genius like Enigma?"



"Was she always special as a child?"



"Can you share her childhood story?"



Myah had no answers for them.



To her, Eleanor was just a bright, kindhearted kid and not some mysterious figure wrapped in fanfare.



Overwhelmed, she shut the doors and refused to see anyone.



When Eleanor heard what was happening, she immediately went online and posted, "Please don't disturb Myah. She's simply a kindhearted person."



Her fans listened, and within hours, the crowd outside Hope House cleared away.



But then, sharp-eyed followers noticed that Enigma had registered a national orphan foundation.



Instantly,her comments flooded with excitement. "I'll donate right away!"



"Our idol isn't just talented, she's kind too!"


"Open the donation channel, I'll be the first in line!"



The Internet atmosphere flipped from noisy chaos to celebration.



Fans cheered as though they had won a battle.



Meanwhile, Lainey watched from the shadows.Seeing her name mentioned less and less should have brought relief, but the truth hit her hard. Eleanor was Enigma.



And she had seen firsthand just how terrifyingly loyal and passionate Enigma's fans could be. If they ever turned on her, she knew it would be the end.
###Chapter 82 | Want You Out!
Yet,Lainey had forgotten that the Internet had a long memory.



After a few days of cheering and hype, Enigma's fans finally cooled off and started piecing the whole mess together.



That was when it hit them that Lainey had played a huge part in their blunder.



If it weren't for her vague, misleading words, they would never have mistaken her for Enigma in the first place.



Once that realization settled in, the fans didn't even need to sayit aloud. One by one, they slid into private group chats, ready to launch a counterattack.



This time, they wanted revenge.



"Anyone got dirt on Lainey Todd? Let's dig everything up."



"Didn't she brag about being a Gilbert? Please. The Gilberts aren't even relevant in Elepdon."


"Forget that. What about her number and address?Who can leak them?" Within thirty minutes, her phone number, home address, and even her usual hangouts, the cafés, malls,and everything in between,were plastered online for anyone to see.



Not long after, Nolan threw fuel on the fire by publicly cutting ties between the Todd and the Gilbert families,making it clear that his loyalty stood firmly with Enigma.


On the other side, Lainey was relaxing with a face mask on, casually watching a drama.



Suddenly, her phone lit up with a message from an unknown number. "Bitch, thief. Just die already."


Right after that, her phone went haywire, buzzing nonstop as the flood of messages turned into a full-blown onslaught.



"Ah!" Lainey shrieked, clutching her ears before hurling the phone against the wall.



How could people be so vile?



They had leaked her personal number as if she were the villain.



It wasn't her fault they jumped to conclusions!



She had never once confirmed she was Enigma. Why should she be punished for their stupidity?


Damn it all! They deserved every curse she could think of.



But the blow that shook her the hardest was Nolan's public declaration. By siding with Eleanor, he ended all cooperation with the Gilbert family and divested the Todd Group.



Lainey was freaking out. What was she supposed to do now?



Jonny would be livid.



And right on cue, the door opened, and there he was.



His stare was sharp enough to cut and heavy enough to crush her.



Lainey's legs turned to water. She wanted to run to him,to explain, but her body wouldn't move.


All she managed was a shaky whisper. "Jonny..."


Jonny walked up to her, step by step, and then slapped her hard across the face. "You worthless woman! Why don't you just die? Plagiarism was bad enough,but now the whole thing's out of control. Do you see what you've done? We and the Gilbert family are finished because of you. Divorce! I want you out!" Divorce?



The word stabbed her like a knife. She couldn't afford that, not now, not ever.



Tears streamed down as she clung to his wrist in desperation. "I only did it for you, for this family! Tell me,what did I do so wrong?"



But Jonny's patience was gone.



With another vicious slap, he knocked her to the floor and barked at the maids, "Lock her in her room. She doesn't step out unless I say so."



Lainey kicked and fought weakly, but the maids easily dragged her away.



Jonny tugged at his tie in frustration, regret washing over him.



How could he have been so blind? Eleanor. The woman he had dismissed as plain and docile had been Enigma all along-the genius designer the entire industry revered.



And him?



He had chosen Lainey instead, a woman who turned out to be nothing but a shallow pretender.



If Eleanor were still with him, if he hadn't signed those  divorce papers... he wouldn't just be her ex-husband -he would be the husband of Enigma.



The Todd Group would never have been pushed to the edge of bankruptcy.


They wouldn't be mocked and toyed with by Nolan,who invested one day and pulled out the next.



No,he couldn't let it end this way.



He had to get Eleanor back, no matter what it took.



She had loved him for three years; those feelings couldn't have been fake. If he humbled himself, if he begged,surely she would forgive him.



With trembling fingers, he pulled up Eleanor's number and hit dial.



But every time, the same cold recording answered,"The number you've dialed is no longer in service."



After trying again and again, he finally sank onto the sofa,hollow and stunned.



Of course.



With Nolan by her side now, why would she ever look back?



But no matter what it took, Eleanor had to be his again. If persuasion failed, he wasn't above taking a darker path.





But for now, he had no move to play.
###Chapter 83 Take Me Out To Eat
Eleanor had no idea about Jonny's determination.


At that moment, she was fully absorbed in her duties at the Hope House.



Myah had already seen the trending news online, but for a while, she kept it to herself, unsure whether to bring it up.



In the end, she gathered her courage and went over to Eleanor, speaking with quiet sincerity. "Eleanor, you should start thinking about your own future. You can't spend your whole life here It's time you found someone to share your days with."



The "someone" she hinted at was none other than Nolan.



Myah's words caught her off guard, though she knew they came from a place of genuine care.


Turning,she gave a soft smile. "Myah, if I leave, who will be here to help you?" she asked gently.


Before Myah could answer, a figure stepped into the doorway,his tall frame blocking the sunlight. Both women looked up, startled to see Nolan standing there. Neither of them had noticed when he arrived.



Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. Why was he here?


Myah, however, recovered quickly. She nudged Eleanor forward with a knowing smile. "Go keep Mr.Stewart company. Don't worry about the rest. He's been such a generous supporter of the orphanage."



Her words sounded casual, but it was clear she was deliberately giving them space



She had read enough online to know that Nolan had feelings for Eleanor



With Myah practically pushing her, Eleanor had no choice but to lead Nolan around as though he were an honored guest



They strolled along, talking off and on.



After a while, Nolan was the one to stop first



He turned to Eleanor, a teasing smile in his eyes."What's the matter, my dear girlfriend?"



Eleanor's cheeks burned.



Girlfriend?



When did that happen? She was about to snap back when he suddenly reached for her wrist,his touch warm and firm.


With a gentle tug, he drew her closer, and his voice dropped low. "If you're going to find a partner," he murmured,"it can only be me."


Then,just as quickly, he released her. He slid his hands into his pockets, his whole demeanor shifting-now relaxed, almost smug.



"Since I'll be the one in the end," he added with a faint smirk, "I might as well start the role early."


Eleanor could only stare at him, torn between exasperation and helplessness.



She couldn't argue with him



In the entire city of Elepdon, there really wasn't a man who could compare to him.


And though she hated to admit it, their recent interactions had changed her heart. Slowly, bit by bit,she had started to feel something for him.


Nolan wasn't just easy on the eyes. He was dependable, kind, and the kind of man who gave his all, and not only to her but also to the Hope House she poured her heart into. By all accounts, he really was the right choice.


Eleanor thought to herself that if she were ever to settle down with someone in this lifetime, Nolan wouldn't be a bad pick at all.



Her quietness made Nolan's heart race. He realized he had gambled, and for once, luck was on his side.



He had been terrified that pushing her might scare her away.


But she shone too brightly for him to stay still. He had been haunted by the thought that someone else could sweep her away if he didn't act.



Now,relief washed over him. The risk had been worth it.



Smiling, he reached for her hand and snapped a picture of their fingers interlaced. W/ithout hesitation.he posted it on Twitter and tagged her account. "My dear girlfriend, looking forward to our future."



To his delight, Eleanor didn't stop him.



If he was the one she would end up with anyway,she figured she might as well start getting used to it now.


She shared his post, tagged him, and wrote, "My dear boyfriend,looking forward to our future." After hitting repost, she slipped her fingers into Nolan's hand,feeling the warmth of his palm. "I'm starving. Take me out to eat."



Nolan's smile softened even more, his tone carrying nothing but affection. "Whatever you want."



The two of them happily flaunted their relationship online.



But while they enjoyed themselves, the Twitter staff were the ones paying the price



Their announcement hit the platform like a storm,crashing the server.


The operations team scrambled around trying to fix the mess, and when they finally got things under control, they left a helpless comment under the couple's posts. "Next time, maybe warn us before dropping a bomb like this?"



Of couse, their plea was completely ignored


At the same time, Ryland and Lillian were equally floored.



Since no one could get through to Nolan or Eleanor directly,all the calls landed on them instead.


At a bar, Lillian slammed her glass against the counter.  grinding her teeth.



Just a few days ago, Eleanor swore she was too busy to bother with love, and now here she was, publicly declaring her romance with Nolan?



Lillian refused to swallow it.


She was dead set on tracking Eleanor down and getting answers.
###Chapter 84 You're Not My Wife



Lillian made her way towards the bar's exit but stopped short when she saw Jonny sprawled drunkenly on the floor.



His suit was rumpled, his hair was sticking up like a bird's nest, and he was nothing like the polished president image he usually tried so hard to maintain.



In his arms, he held a crudely carved wooden rabbit,clutching it tightly as he muttered in a slur, "Eleanor.sweetheart..."



At the sound of her friend's name, Lillian's fury spiked.She almost smacked him right there



This scumbag!



Where was all this so-called affection back when it actually mattered?



Scowling in disgust,she turned sharply and made for the exit.



But right at the doorway, she nearly collided with Lainey. Lillian couldn't be bothered. Without a word, she sidestepped and swept past her, as if Lainey weren't even worth a glance.


Lainey, on the other hand, seethed inside at the blatant dismissal. Still, she bit her tongue and pressed forward, only to see Jonny slumped on the floor.



Her stomach sank.



So this was what he had been doing? Did he have no shame left at all?



After Eleanor's bombshell post, Jonny had stormed out without explanation. Now here he was, humiliating himself in public.



If the bartender hadn't called, she wouldn't even have bothered showing up



She jabbed him with the tip of her shoe "Jonny, get up. We're going home."



But the moment he realized it wasn't the woman he wanted, his drunken fury flared. "Who the hell are you?Get lost! You're not my wife. Eleanor is my wife! She's my only wife!"



The bar instantly buzzed with whispers and side glances. The crowd, who already recognized Jonny,were clearly enjoying the spectacle.



So this was how the so-called golden couple ended up?



Lainey's face burned. Jonny could afford to be a drunken fool, but her pride wouldn't allow it.


In a fit of rage, she snatched the rabbit from his arms and hurled it to the floor. "Jonny, look at me properly!I'm your wife. Not Eleanor! Me!"


Without waiting for his reply, she dragged him up with brute force and hauled him toward the door, ignoring the murmurs and mocking stares.


Neither of them noticed the tall man who stepped forward once they stumbled away. His bespoke suit was sharp,his presence commanding.



Slowly,he walked over to the wooden rabbit left behind, crouched down, and picked it up.


As he studied it, his sharp eyes widened in disbelief.Wasn't this the very same rabbit his boss's daughter had held in her arms when she disappeared twenty years ago?



He straightened, his voice dropping low and cold as he addressed the bodyguard at his side. "I want  everything there is to know about that woman."



Days later, at the Gilbert family's estate, Kurt and his wife sat nervously in the drawing room.



The man across from them radiated authority with nothing more than his posture.


Kurt rubbed his palms against his knees, finally mustering the courage to speak.. Perkins,regarding the Homecoming Support Foundation you mentioned, we're more than willing to provide full support."



Truthfully, he couldn't believe their luck.



Denny Perkins was a man of mystery and immense influence, yet here he was, offering a partnership that came with nothing but benefits.



But why him? What had he done to earn this stroke of fortune?



Denny lifted his teacup and spoke without looking up."No need for pleasantries, Mr. Gilbert, I didn't come here solely because of your family's influence."


He finally raised his eyes, sharp and deliberate. "It's also because I heard that your daughter was adopted."
###Chapter 85 When Did You Get Here
 Kurt and his wife looked at each other, their faces going pale.



They had buried this secret so deep that even Lainey herself had no clue. So how on earth did Denny manage to dig it up?



A wave of panic washed over Kurt.



But the more he thought about it, the less surprising it seemed.



With Denny's reach and influence, pulling a secret like this intothe light would have been child's play.



Forcing his lips into something that resembled a smile,Kurt tried to keep his composure. "Mr. Perkins, you certainly keep yourself well-informed."



However, Denny wasn't finished, and the very next words out of his mouth hit like a thunderclap. "From the way you're reacting, don't tell me you actually stole her back then?"



Kurt's heart nearly stopped. His hands trembled as he shook his head wildly. "No! Absolutely not! We  adopted her properly, from an orphanage,with all the official paperwork!"



Lauryn Gilbert, Kurt's wife, was terrified that the wrong idea might take root and jumped in at once."Yes,exactly! Westhaven Orphanage.Everything was done by the book, and all the documents are there!"


Denny casually jotted down the name, then let his tone ease into something almost friendly. "No need to be so stiff. We're just talking. Tell me, after you brought her home, how did she grow up? What kind of student was she? I want the whole picture,every detail. This could determine whether you end up holding this project."



Neither Kurt nor Lauryn dared hold anything back after that They poured out everything they could remember.



What they didn't realize was that someone else had heard it all. Lainey had been on her way inside when the words stopped her cold.



Adopted? The identity she had worn like a crown for years, the pride of being the Gilberts' daughter, was nothing but a lie?



Even if things with Jonny had fallen apart, she had thought she could still lean on the Gilbert family.



But now, she wasn't even theirs by blood. The truth was too much to bear.



She just couldn't accept it.



Just like that bitch Eleanor, she was nothing more than an orphan.


In that moment, it felt as if her entire world had crumbled.



Her knees went weak, and she staggered back several steps before finally steadying herself.



Inside, the conversation ended, and Denny stepped out. His aura of wealth and authority was impossible to ignore.



Lainey's heart lurched, and she instinctively shrank into the shadows near the doorway



Denny didn't notice her.



He paused in the courtyard, pulling out a wooden rabbit, his eyes burning with a hope he could barely contain.



He needed to arrange a meeting with Lainey and somehow get hold of a strand of her hair. A DNA test would confirm everything.



With that decision made, he tucked the rabbit back into his pocket and left the Gilbert family's estate. Only when the sound of his car faded did Lainey slip out from her hiding spot.


That rabbit... wasn't it the very one she had smashed to the ground?


So,he had picked it up afterward?



From the bits she overheard and Denny's demeanor,a wild, reckless thought began to take root.



Could it be that this man was from Eleanor's real family?



Could he have mistaken her for Eleanor?



Her nails dug into her palms. No.



That could never be allowed.



Eleanor must remain an orphan forever


If Eleanor not only carried the title of Enigma and was destined to marry into the Stewart family but also turned out to be from a powerful household...then her life would be utterly eclipsed. She would never stand a chance again.



The idea alone filled Lainey with fury.


Forcing herself to calm down, she pulled out her phone, uploaded the photo she had secretly snapped  of Denny, and quickly ran a search.



The results made her pulse race.



The man was Denny Perkins, chief assistant at the Benton Group, one of the most powerful dynasties in the world.



Their influence stood shoulder to shoulder with the Stewart Group's, stretching across continents.


Lainey's thoughts went wild.


If she played her cards right, she could slip seamlessly into that kind of fortune



The Gilberts would be nothing in comparison.



And Jonny? By then, he would be a discarded ###Chapter of her life.



She wouldn't even have to lift a finger.


The Benton family would surely arrange a marriage far more prestigious than anything Jonny could offer.With her beauty and the Bentons backing her, why stop at Elepdon? Even marrying a Breoquan prince wasn't impossible!


Lainey's excitement swelled so much that she barely noticed Kurt stepping out. "Lainey? When did you get here? Why didn't you go inside?" His brows furrowed with concern. "Did Jonny upset you again? If he did, just tell me, and I'll take care of it."



The affection in his tone was evident, but now it only rang hollow.


He was just an adoptive father. Compared to the possibilities she had just uncovered, what was Kurt Gilbert worth?



Her interest in humoring him evaporated. Brushing past him without a second glance, she said flatly, "I just got here. I'm tired. I'm going to my room."


Kurt blinked after her,bewildered.



Why was his daughter suddenly so distant?



Surely Jonny had wronged her again.


His fists clenched at his sides. One way or another, he would make that boy pay.



Lainey ddn't deserve to be treated this way.
###Chapter 86 I'm Not Kurt Gilbert's Daugh ter  	
Kurt and his wife adored their adopted daughter,Lainey, and her sudden return had them overjoyed.


Within just half a day,they had already showered her with jewelry,spending without a second thought as if glittering trinkets could buy her happiness.


Lainey, however, wasn't moved. She forced a polite smile,but her heart wasn't in it.


What she was really waiting for was Denny's call.


She figured Denny's plan would be to come up with some excuse to meet her, then secretly use her hair for a DNA test. That would be her perfect chance to secretly switch Eleanor's hair with hers.



Her prediction came true sooner than she thought.The very next morning, her phone buzzed.



Denny used the excuse that, since she played an important role in the Homecoming Support Foundation Project, he wanted to sit down with her at Usepsall Café the following day to go over the details.


Lainey played her part well. She acted hesitant at first,  then reluctantly agreed to meet him.


At that point, everything was in place, and she just needed the final step to complete her plan.


She quickly told her parents she would go home and drove straight back to the Todd family's villa.


Since the household staff had already cleared out Eleanor's things, the room looked almost empty,with only a few old pieces of furniture left behind.


Putting on gloves, Lainey crouched down and carefully searched every inch of the floor.


After almost an hour of searching, she finally spotted a few long strands of hair tucked deep under the bathroom sink.



Using tweezers, she carefully collected them and sealed them inside the bag she had prepared in advance.



With that done,she could practically picture herself becoming part of the Benton family. It felt so close she could almost touch it.



Just as she was happily getting ready to leave, she was startled when Jonny suddenly came back home.



His body reeked of alcohol, and his face looked stormy as he snapped, "Gone the whole night, and  this soon after our wedding? What's this,huh? Are you already thinking about divorce?"



He thought he was just blowing off steam, but to his shock,Lainey smiled and calmly answered,"Of course,I'd love that."



Jonny froze, completely caught off guard.


He had been expecting her to cry, throw a fit, or beg like she usually did. Never in his wildest dreams did he think she would agree so easily.



Squinting suspiciously, he studied her face."What kind of game are you playing now?"



Lainey crossed her arms, walked toward him with a proud look, and said with disdain, "Game? No. It's simple. You're just not good enough for me."



Jonny wasn't the naive lover he used to be. Seeing her dodge the point, he grabbed her wrist and demanded, "Tell me exactly what you mean!"


Lainey quickly pulled her hand free and lifted her chin proudly. "Do you want to know why I didn't come home last night? I went to watch a very entertaining show, and while I was there, I discovered something shocking. I'm not Kurt Gilbert's daughter. I'm actually the long-lost daughter of the Benton family in Breoqua." She didn't bother to keep it a secret anymore.Why should she? With Eleanor's hair in her possession,the DNA results would prove her claim soon enough. Then,once she was officially recognized as a Benton,her position would be unshakable.


Jonny,however,was stunned.



His mind reeled at her words. Could this really be true?


The Benton family was just as powerful and renowned as the Stewart family



If they backed the Todd Group, not only would the company survive, but it would also flourish.



But then again, could he really believe Lainey?


She had put on acts, lied, and schemed too mmany times for him to trust her easily.


Lainey noticed the doubt flickering in his eyes,but she didn't care in the slightest.


Instead,she let out a mocking laugh, her gaze dripping with scorn as she continued, "Get it through your head,Jonny. I'm the one divorcing you."


When had Lainey ever dared to look him in the eye and challenge him like this?



Something about her newfound confidence rattled him.  Could she actually be telling the truth thistime?


Even if she wasn't, he reasoned, if there was even the slightest chance of using this connection to the Benton family,it would be worth it.


With that thought, his attitude shifted in an instant. His harshness melted into sweetness, his voice softening as he coaxed, "Lainey, after all we've been through,can we really just end things like this? Listen, there's a grand charity auction coming up in a few days. I'll take you with me. Whatever catches your eye,I'll make sure we bid for it, alright?"


But as the supposed future member of the Benton family,why would she care for such little gestures?


Even so, until she drained every bit of benefit from him,letting him trail by her side wasn't sucha bad plan.


Lainey tilted her chin and looked down on him with a smug expression "That depends on how well you perform."



The next afternoon, Lainey met Denny as planned


Treating her with the utmost respect, Denny politely pulled out a chair for her. Once she sat down, he took a file from his briefcase and placed it in front of her.


"Mrs. Todd, our firm is launching a charity program called the Homecoming Support Foundation. Since  you've always been passionate about charity work,we'd like to hear your opinion."



Lainey picked up the document, though she hardly paid attention to its contents. Her mind was elsewhere.With practiced subtlety, she slipped a sealed bag from her purse under the table and quietly placed the strands of hair onto her lap.


She lingered a moment, then took a delicate sip of her drink before excusing herself smoothly. "I'm sorry,I need to step away for a moment."



As she stood up, the strand of hair slid off her lap and landed on the sofa cushion.



To anyone watching, it would look like it hadsimply fallen naturally.



Sure enough, the moment she stepped toward the restroom, she caught sight of Denny discreetly snatching up the hair and slipping it quickly into his pocket.



Lainey's heart raced with excitement.


Perfect. Everything was going exactly as planned.


Soon,she would be part of the Benton family


But she wasn't as invisible as she thought. From across the room, Darleen had been quietly watching. She frowned in confusion.



Why was Lainey behaving so oddly, dropping strands of hair like that?



And why did that man with her look so strangely familiar?



Darleen wracked her memory, trying to recall who he was,but nothing came to mind.



Eventually,she let it go.



Whatever the scheme was, she wanted no part of it.Lainey was nothing but trouble



She had learned that lesson before, and she wasn't about to fall for it again.
###Chapter 87 You've Met The Bentons Before
Lainey finally gotthe moment she had been waiting for.





Just two days later, headlines exploded across the internet


"Breaking News! Lainey Todd, wife of the Todd Group's CEO, was revealed to be the long-lost daughter of the prestigious Benton family from Breoqua!"


The announcement instantly stirred a frenzy online.


Almost immediately. Eleanor's phone buzzed. It was Lillian calling."Eleanor,did you see it? That sly woman actually managed to climb her way up. Just goes to show, bad weeds never die."



Eleanor leaned back on her sofa, calmly scrolling through a picture of Lainey on her tablet. In the photo,Lainey appeared shy and innocent, though her expression stayed unreadable.


Eleanor exchanged a few polite words with Lillian before ending the call. Not long after, another notification lit up her phone


It was a message from Nolan.o you want me to look into the Benton family for you?"


Eleanor's slender fingers tapped a short reply. need."



The Benton family had nothing to do with her



She had bigger things to worry about now.



In just three days, an antique that had been lost overseas for years was going up for sale at Crownwell Auctions.



It was a national treasure, and leaving it abroad was not an option. It had to be brought back home.



As Eleanor thought about this, her phone buzzed again.





Another message from Nolan popped up



"Baby, you've been ignoring me for too long.When are we finally having dinner?" It ended with a pitiful puppy emoji.



A rare smile tugged at Eleanor's lips as she looked at the cartoon face. For once, her usually composed expression softened. She typed a single word back. "Now."


Moments later, a sleek black Bentley rolled to a stop in front of her apartment building.



The door opened, and Nolan stepped out first.



His long strides, sharply tailored suit, and perfectly defined features under the sunlight immediately caught people's attention.


With broad shoulders and a lean waist, he looked effortlessly magnetic, drawing the eyes of everyone around.



When Eleanor slid into the back seat, her brows pinched slightly. "Next time, don't park right at the entrance."



Nolan tilted his head,his tone playful. "And why not?"


She fastened her seatbelt and met his gaze steadily."Because I don't like being gawked at like I'm on display."



His chuckle was low and indulgent. "Ah, so it seems being too exceptional really is a flaw."



After a smooth drive, the car pulled up in front of Cloudcrest Dining-a renowned luxury restaurant in Elepdon. Exclusive and notoriously difficult to book, it was a place reserved for only the city's most influential figures.


A waiter, already waiting at the entrance, bowed respectfully and ushered them inside.


To Eleanor's surprise, the entire restaurant was empty,save for the gentle hum of soothing background music.


She glanced around, her brows slightly raised "You booked out the whole place?"



Nolan pulled out a chair for her with elegant precision,waiting until she was seated before replying, "Of course. With who we are and the relationship we share,do you think we'd get to enjoy a peaceful dinner otherwise?"



Eleanor said nothing


He wasn't wrong, after all.


Yet, sitting in such a massive restaurant with no one else around felt a little excessive to her


However,right at that moment, commotion broke out at the entrance.


A familiar voice barked, full of irritation. "What do you mean we can't go in? Do you even know who I am?"It was Jonny.


Hot on his heels was Lainey's soft, coaxing tone."Jonny, leave it. We can eat somewhere else. It's only dinner."



On the surface, her voice was patient and generous Inside,though,she was sneering.



Once,she had thought Jonny was the perfect catch But now? He seemed painfully ordinary.



Throwing a fit over being denied entry hardly reflected the refinement of the elite.



Once the Bentons returned from abroad and officially claimed her, she would cast him aside without hesitation, otherwise,he would only drag down her status.



Jonny, completely oblivious to her inner thoughts,finally swallowed his anger when the manager refused to budge Turning to her with a guilty face, he murmured, "Lainey, I'm sorry Let's just go somewhere else."



Soon,their voices died down, and silence returned to the restaurant.


Nolan leisurely sliced into his steak and remarked,"1can't help but wonder how such respectable parents  like the Bentons ended up with a daughter like that."



Eleanor's eyes lifted in curiosity. "You've met the Bentons before?"


"At several international business conferences," he replied, his gaze steady on hers. "Lainey is nothing like them,especially Mrs. Benton. She carries herself with a kind of calm elegance that, oddly enough, makes me think of you."


Eleanor's knife paused briefly before continuing as if nothing had happened.



She didn't bite at his remark. Instead, she asked in a light, offhand tone, "And what sort of aura do you think I have?"



Nolan set down his utensils and leaned in across the table,closing the distance between them.


His eyes were intent, and his voice was low. "Bold.Alluring, Fearless."



A quick rush went through Eleanor, her heartbeat skipping unexpectedly.


She turned her head, pretending to focus on her plate,though the warmth creeping up her ears betrayed her."Just eat your dinner."



When he caught the flush at her ears, Nolan's smile deepened.


Leaning back into his seat, he picked up his usual calm composure. "The Crownwell Auctions are coming up in a few days. Shall we go together?"


Eleanor had planned to attend anyway, so she answered without hesitation, "Alright."
###Chapter 88 My Girlfriend's Busy
On the day of the auction, Eleanor was just about to hail a cab when a sleek, understated Bentley rolled up right in front of her



Without bothering with formalities, she opened the door and slid into the backseat.


After all, why not take advantage of having a personal driver at her disposal?


As she got comfortable, Nolan looked at her with sparkling eyes.


Eleanor felt her cheeks warm and quickly turned to the window,pretending to admire the passing scenery.


Erick,watching quietly from the front seat, couldn't help but let out a sly chuckle.



Ah, the unmistakable vibe of romance



Life had certainly gotten sweeter ever since Nolan had successfully won Eleanor's heart



The auction was being held at the Lumina Hotel. The moment Eleanor stepped out of the car, a group of eager socialites surrounded her.


"Eleanor, I'm getting married soon! Can you design my wedding gown?"



"Eleanor, I'm a fashion design student and have won countless awards. Can I be your apprentice?"


"Eleanor, I'll pay anything just to have you design my evening dress."



"Eleanor,you look absolutely stunningl"



The crowd quickly became overwhelming, but Nolan calmly extended his long arm and pulled Eleanor close.


"Sorry, my girlfriend's busy," he said, keeping her protected as he guided her toward the venue.



No one dared cross him.



The socialites had no choice but to step aside and disperse,swallowing their frustration.


Meanwhile, Jonny walked in with Lainey draped over his arm and froze at the sight of Nolan holding Eleanor.



Fuck!



How had Eleanor grown even more radiant? That dazzling woman should have been his wife



It all boiled down to Eleanor.



If she hadn't thrown a fit when Lainey returned, he could have had both incredible women by his side.


Still,things weren't entirely lost.



Lainey would soon secure recognition from the Benton family and claim their massive fortune.



Whatever Lainey acquired would ultimately come under his control.



With riches comparable to entire kingdoms, he refused to accept that Eleanor wouldn't come back to him eventually.



Lainey noticed his silence and immnediately understood what he was thinking.



She wasn't bothered.



The divorce was final, yet the auction was still a chance she couldn't miss.



After all,which woman would turn down more jewels?



What Lainey hadn't anticipated was Eleanor showing up at the auction and easily capturing everyone's attention. She couldn't stand it.



Puffing out her chest and lifting her head, she deliberately cleared her throat.


Even the socialites who were about to leave couldn't help but return, albeit reluctantly



"Oh, it's Lainey!"



"Lainey, don't forget us when you officially join the Benton family."



"Yes! The Bentons are so incredibly wealthy When they acknowledge you, don't forget us little people,"



They bent over backward, showering her with praise,because they had no choice



After all, both the Stewarts and the Bentons were untouchable.



Lainey, who was enjoying their praise, replied with pride, "Of course, I'll never forget you, my dear friends."



Then she purposely looked at Eleanor, only to see her completely ignoring her and walking off with Nolan.


Fury flared, and she clenched her fists tightly.


 
The audacity! Once she was officially acknowledged, Eleanor's family would effectively become hers.


And when she finally secured the Benton fortune, she would make sure Eleanor understood the full extent of it.


She would relish watching how Eleanor would respond to such a revelation.
###Chapter 89 Should I Lend You Some
Thirty minutes later, the auction finally got underway


The first lot was a dazzling ten-carat pink diamond ring called The One.


The moment it hit the spotlight, the crowd of socialites gasped in awe.


The auctioneer cleared his throat, announcing."Opening bid is $10 million."



Lainey,legs crossed and confidence radiating, shot Jonny a look



Jonny caught her meaning but hesitated, lowering his voice. "Lainey,how about picking something else?"


The Todd Group was in deep financial trouble, and he only had a million in liquid cash to his name


There was no way he could cough up ten million.



Lainey was unmoved.


If Jonny wasn't willing to shell out that kind of money for her, she saw no reason to entertain him further. She shot him a glare, her expression dripping with scorn. "You were the one who insisted I come,and now that I want this ring, you're hesitating? Don't worry, I won't force you. My real parents will be back soon,and when they are, I'll have more than enough jewelry like this."



She spoke as if her presence alone was a favor to him,completely unwilling to compromise.



Jonny could only clench his jaw in frustration at her attitude. "Fine, I'll bid on it!"



But before he could act, a calm, almost bored voice called out from the front row. "$50 million."



Nolan didn't bother with the paddle as he simply lounged back in his seat, naming a price that stunned the entire room into silence



Fifty million?



The ring's value didn't even reach thirty!


The auctioneer barely contained his excitement."$50million going once, going twice, sold!"


He hurried to close the bid, anxious that Nolan might suddenly retract his offer.


That extra twenty million would make his numbers  look fantastic. Of course, he was thrilled.



Nolan, meanwhile, seemed completely unfazed by the spectacle around him.


He accepted the ring from an attendant, then slipped it onto Eleanor's finger himself.


After studying how it looked on her hand, he gave a small, satisfied smile. "It's perfect for you."


Eleanor was left at a loss, unable to decipher his motives.


He was well aware that she had no real interest in extravagant jewelry.


To her, fifty million could have done so much more,like feeding and clothing the kids at Hope House instead.



Nolan noticed her quiet discomfort and immediately grasped what she was thinking.


Leaning in close, he whispered against her ear, "Save it for when I officially propose."


Eleanor found herself momentarily speechless.


That was...unexpectedly daring!



She genuinely didn't know how to respond. On the other hand, Lainey squirmed with envy watching the scene unfold.



What did Eleanor have that caught Nolan's attention?


She was going be acknowledged by the Bentons.Wasn't she supposed to be above someone like Eleanor?



Unable to hide her bitterness, she spoke up with a sneer. "Jonny, you really have my sympathy. Eleanor spent three years as your wife, relying on you for everything, and now that she's landed someone wealthier, she's tossed you aside without a second thought."


Her jab all but called Eleanor a gold digger.


Everyone else glanced around nervously, unwilling to say a word.



Neither camp was safe to offend, and a careless comment could mean real trouble later.


Right then, an uneasy hush fell over the room.


Eleanor didn't bother replying, simply glancing at Lainey for a moment before turning away.


Her focus was on business tonight; she had no intention of getting dragged into childish taunts. Auction item after item went up, antique paintings,sparkling jewelry, and Eleanor said nothing.


Meanwhile, Lainey, riding high on compliments from the crowd, snatched up several minor pieces, ignoring Jonny's livid face.


She shot a barbed remark at Eleanor. "So this is the legendary Enigma? Shows up at an auction and doesn't place a single bid. What's the matter? Money a little tight? Should I lend you some?"


Eleanor acted as though Lainey's words were nothing but background noise, refusing even to glance her way.


She sat quietly, looking bored, like nothing at the auction could hold her interest.


But as soon as the auctioneer brought up the Queen's diamond tiara, something flickered in her eyes.


"That one."



In one smooth, deliberate motion, she raised her hand,elegance and determination radiating from her.



With that simple gesture, she made it clear that no matter the price, she wouldn't back down.



No one else would dare challenge her. A heavy hush swept over the venue, as if everyone was holding their breath.
###Chapter 90 Everything I Have Is Yours
Nolan's gaze was soft, filled with unwavering warmth as if he was promising Eleanor,"The tiara will be yours."



A surge of envy twisted across Lainey's face,her eyes darkening with disbelief. "No way! How on earth did she come up with that much cash?"



Even knowing Eleanor was Enigma didn't make sense of it. She couldn't have managed that kind of money on her own.



Did Nolan secretly give it to her?


No,that couldn't be.


Nolan might be rich, but he wasn't reckless enough to throw a fortune at someone he had just started dating.


What Lainey didn't realize wasthat one day soon,Nolan would be willing to give up every cent he owned just to put a smile on Eleanor's face. That,however, was a Chapter yet to unfold.


For now, Eleanor sat unfazed by the doubters and let a small, confident smile play on her lips. She stood up, handed a card over to the auctioneer,and said in a clear, steady voice, "Feel free to check the balance."



Grinning widely, the auctioneer accepted the card and motioned for one of the staff members to handle it."Let's get this confirmed right away!"


WVhile they waited, Lainey's expression remained glued to Eleanor, her excitement barely contained as if she expected to watch Eleanor's bank account be exposed for everyone to see.



She folded her arms and scoffed, "Some people just can't help pretending to have what they don't! I can't wait for her to slip up, then we'll see what happens-"



A sudden, icy stare sent a shiver down her spine before she could get the rest of her sentence out.


Instinctively, she turned around and found herself staring into Nolan's unreadable eyes.


It rattled her.



Caught off guard, she clamped her mouth shut and stopped talking.


Just then, a staff member hurried back, waving the card. His voice shook with excitement as he handed it back to Eleanor and announced, "After checking,Miss Warren's balance exceeds ten billion. She's fully cleared to pay for the tiara."


Ten billion-an amount that left everyone stunned!


Besides Nolan, nobody else in the room seemed to hold that kind of financial firepower.


The question buzzed in everyone's mind: Who exactly was Eleanor?



Was there more to her than just being Enigma?


While the crowd whispered among themselves,Eleanor effortlessly won the Queen's diamond tiara,placing the opening bid of one hundred million.


She had braced herself for a bidding war, but to her surprise, no one else joined in to bid.


Lainey tried to stir up trouble, but Jonny grabbed her arm and kept her in check.


A wave of relief washed over Eleanor as she became the new owner of the Queen's diamond tiara.


In that moment, she knew she had honored her mentor's wish. Another priceless artifact had finally found its way home. Nolan watched the joy on her face and moved a little closer. "If there's ever anything you want, just say the word. I'll make sure you get it."


Eleanor carefully set the tiara to the side, then fixed her eyes on him. "Do you really mean that?"



A hint of worry tugged at her as she wondered if he even realized how much she was asking.



Taking on this mission meant pitting her own determination to stand firm against powerful financial interests.



Put simply, no amount of money was enough, no matter how much one had.



She could only push forward with everything she had.


If Nolan chose to support her, doors to treasures she could never reach alone might finally open.


But was he truly willing to take that step with her?


Something in the way Nolan held her gaze told her he understood exactly what she needed.



She wasn't looking for something ordinary, and he knew it. Still, he didn't hesitate.


His eyes traced her features, lingering on her lips. "Yes,I meant what I said." He then leaned in and pressed a soft, fleeting kiss to her lips, as if sealing a vow between them. "Everything I have is yours."


For a brief moment,Eleanor found herself completely swept up by him.


How did he always seem to know the right thing to say?


Although their time together had been brief, he had a way of making her feel as if she were the center of his entire world.



Eleanor found herself at a loss, unwilling to chase the thought any further.


To hide her flustered state, she sprang to her feet."I got what I wanted, so we should head out."


Nolan could immediately tell that she was being shy.


Choosing to let her off the hook, he held back any playful remarks.


He just offered a gentle nod and quietly walked out with her.
###Chapter 91 Is It True You Evaded Taxes
It wasn't until Eleanor and Nolan vanished completely from the venue that Lainey finally returned to reality.



She could hardly believe her eyes.



Nolan, acting as though Eleanor were the most precious person alive, was eager to hand over money?



What exactly did Eleanor possess that made her worthy of such devotion?



Her first instinct was to chase after them,but Jonny's hand held her back firmly.



The Benton family might wield incredible power in Breoqua,but here in Elepdon, the Stewart family ruled.Offending Nolan in his own territory would be a mistake even the Bentons couldn't rectify.



Being restrained by Jonny only made Lainey look down on him further.



He was utterly useless, always holding her back.


But seeing Nolan's generosity sparked an idea. Once she was acknowledged by the Bentons, she would push them to extend their influence domestically and arrange a strategic alliance with the Stewart family.



That way, Nolan would eventually be hers.



If she could have taken Jonny from Eleanor once,surely she could take Nolan too.



With her mind made up, Lainey stopped her protests and obediently followed Jonny back to the villa.



Her compliance, however, was only skin-deep.



Inside, her mind was a storm of anger and jealousy.



Thinking about Eleanor's bank balance churned her stomach with envy.



She assumed the money had come from Nolan and knew it would ultimately be hers.



A scheming smile crept onto her face as she formed a plan to investigate Eleanor further.



Hours passed, but she found nothing.



Still, she refused to give up.


Then, just as she was about to shut down her computer, she stumbled upon a critical detail. The Queen's diamond tiara, the same one Eleanor had auctioned tonight, was an exhibit from overseas.


According to the rules, the auction winner had to pay customs duties. But Eleanor hadn't done so.


Lainey's eyes lit up with mischief. "Eleanor, you've brought this upon yourself," she whispered under her breath.



Given her prestige in the design world, any post about Enigma would go viral instantly, and especially the one hinting at a legal misstep.


So within a day, Lainey's anonymous tweet exploded online.



The headline blared, "Shocking news! Famous designer Enigma caught evading taxes!"



She had even included a link to the official auction page.



A quick click revealed the words "tax unpaid" listed under the Queen's diamond tiara.



It was indisputable evidence.


Eleanor could almost guess who was behind this, but she had no way to defend herself. Technically, she hadn't paid the customs fee, but in reality, since the auction was for charity, no tax was required. Even if  she wanted to pay, the museum wouldn't accept it.


However, Eleanor couldn't reveal this reason,or her identity would be blown.


If that happened, she would end up spending far more than necessary on future auctions for national treasures.



Her fans, unaware of these details, saw only the headline that their idol had broken the law.



Disappointment swept through the fandom, and many abandoned her.



Even the operation of Enigma's store in Elepdon was affected.



After receiving a panicked call from Besty, Eleanor headed to the store immediately.


The moment she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by media.



"Miss Warren! Is it true you evaded taxes?"


"You spent $100 million on the Queen's diamond tiara;was that money legitimate?"


"Will Enigma brand suffer because of this?"


Besty quickly appeared with her bodyguards, skillfully  creating a human shield around Eleanor.


Once they reached the lounge, she handed Eleanor the report detailing the losses.


"Boss, I'm sorry. My poor management..." Besty's voice was full of guilt.


They had lost one hundred million in just one day, and she felt she had let Eleanor down.


Eleanor took the document, gave it a quick look, and set it on the table. "It's fine. It's not your fault."



She could handle this loss, and if needed, she could make more under the name of the Soul Surgeon through the Underground Network, a move that would also protect her from constant scrutiny there.


Still, Besty felt responsible. "There are fans willing to defend you, but they're afraid to speak out because of legal issues. Should we post something on Twitter?"


Eleanor shook her head. She would rather take the criticism than risk exposing her identity.


She gave a few instructions to Besty and headed out.


Outside, the persistent reporters hadn't gone anywhere.


Paying them no mind, Eleanor walked directly to a  taxi at the curb.



Her calm, indifferent demeanor, completely ignoring the commotion, was once again photographed by onlookers, and within moments, the footage spread across social media.



The public reacted strongly.



"Who does she think she is? She's so cocky!"


"Look at her! She's probably scared and staying quiet to dodge the problem!"


"Not responding is the same as admitting it.Investigate her thoroughly!"



Before long, Enigma's once-spotless reputation began to tumble, the whispers growing louder with each passing hour.
###Chapter 92 My Wife Will Only Be Her
Several days later, the atmosphere at Stewart family's residence was tense.



The butler's report barely finished when Norwood shot Nolan a look of pure fury, unable to hide his displeasure.



"So this is the incredible woman you want as your wife?"Norwood snapped.


Nolan squared his shoulders, refusing to back down as he locked eyes with Norwood. "Grandpa, I believe in her."



That calm response only fueled Norwood's outrage,causing him to break into a fit of coughing as his cheeks turned bright red.


"You believe in her? What good is your belief?"



Norwood's hand shook as he pointed accusingly at Nolan. "I won't accept a granddaughter-in-law with a stained reputation! You've always gone your own way,but this time, you must do as I say. End it with her!"


Nolan kept silent, his eyes flickering toward the butler  for help.


Recognizing the cue, the butler moved quickly, gently patting Norwood's back to help him catch his breath.


Once Norwood had calmed down, Nolan returned his focus to him and spoke steadily. "Grandpa, she's my girlfriend. I'll handle things the way I see fit. Your health comes first, so please take care of yourself.I'll visit again in a few days."



Without waiting for a reply, he walked out of the house with purposeful steps.


"Why must you be so stubborn?" Norwood's anger boiled over as he slammed his cane on the floor.



He couldn't shake the feeling that the Stewart family was doomed to have someone put love above family honor.



Colson had done it once, and now Nolan was repeating the same mistake.


Norwood couldn't shake the fear that Nolan's downfall would eventually come at the hands of a woman.


At least he had guessed one thing correctly-Nolan always wore his heart on his sleeve.


When he fell for someone, it meant unwavering faith  and loyalty, no matter the circumstances.



From the driver's seat, Erick glanced at Nolan in the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. "Mr. Stewart, was your grandfather upset with you?"



Nolan reclined against the plush seat, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Don't worry about it."



He had no interest in revisiting that sour conversation.



His mind was on Eleanor.



The Internet backlash was getting worse by the hour,and he wasn't sure she could manage the pressure on her own.



"Get a PR team to take down the trending topic right away," he instructed.


Erick paused, a troubled expression flashing briefly."Mr. Stewart, we can't make it disappear. The scandal is about taxes, and that's way out of our hands."



The news even included the official auction page as proof, making any attempts to hide it completely useless.



In fact, Erick had tried to block the story the moment it broke, but the effort had been in vain.



Standard PR tricks were completely useless in a  situation like this.


The news left Nolan quiet, his usually cool gaze clouded with thought.


He stayed silent for a few seconds before giving a quiet order. "Stop the car here."


Dozens of reporters were waiting just outside the Stewart family's residence, and the moment the car rolled to a halt, they surged forward in a frenzy.


"Mr. Stewart, do you have any comment about Enigma's tax investigation?"


"Will your family block your engagement to Eleanor because of the scandal?"



"Are you planning to end things with Eleanor over this?"


"Mr. Stewart, can you give us your official response?"


Erick began to get out, ready to clear a path through the crowd, but Nolan held up a hand to stop him.



Without hesitation, Nolan got out and walked right into the sea of cameras and microphones.



Though his expression remained stern, a gentle warmth crept into his eyes as he spoke. "I believe in her.No matter what happens, my wife will only be her." Right then, the entire group of reporters instantly fell silent.



Even if they had heard Nolan say something similar in the past, the conviction in his voice this time left them speechless.


He was, after all, Nolan Stewart-the city's most striking and impossibly wealthy bachelor.


Eleanor might have been a renowned designer,but with Nolan's power and fortune, he could have chosen anyone he wanted. Why was he so obsessed with her of all people?


The more they tried to make sense of it, the more impossible it seemed.



As if that wasn't enough, Nolan delivered one last message, his voice unwavering. "Let me be clear: if anyone goes against her, they go against me."


He slid back into the car, leaving the press frozen in disbelief.



The reporters could already picture the chaos this story would unleash; the city's high-society women were bound to be devastated.


After all, casual flings were common, but true,unwavering loyalty from a man like Nolan was a rare n..thing.
###Chapter 93 Will You Let Us Handle This
 Within just half a day, Nolan's comments shot to the top of trending	topics,	tagged	with	#Nolan'sDevotionToEnigma         and         #Nolan'sSupportForEnigma.


Seeing the news,Eleanor felt a deep sense of warmth,finally understanding what it meant to be trusted completely.


"Eleanor, you've seen this, haven't you?" Lillian gripped her hand tightly,her voice edged with worry."Nolan has publicly backed you. If anything concerns you,speak up now. Public opinion can be brutal."


Lillian thought about the Stewart family's position and understood that unless their view changed, Norwood would refuse to accept Eleanor.


Even if Eleanor married Nolan, a truly peaceful life wasn't guaranteed.


Still, Eleanor remained composed.


Nolan's support stirred something within her,causing a brief hesitation, but it passed quickly. "Think of it as a test for Nolan," she responded.



Eleanor knew that if Nolan couldn't weather this challenge, he wouldn't endure the unpredictable storms that lay ahead.



She wanted a partner who could walk beside her as an equal, not someone who needed endless shielding.


Sensing Eleanor's silence, Lainey grew bolder.


She anonymously sent out several more tweets, one directly targeting the Hope House.


The headline screamed, "Financial Chaos at the Hope House-Large Donations Allegedly Diverted to Enigma's Personal Account."


At the bottom of the post, she had even attached what looked like bank statements, carefully forged.


Under normal circumstances, netizens might have questioned whether the images were real.


But at this critical moment, nobody paid it any attention.


Everyone focused only on one thing: Enigma's reputation appeared completely destroyed.

 
The backlash online was unrelenting. Even Myah couldn't escape the storm.


Surrounded by a swarm of reporters, she repeated herself over and over. "No, Eleanor didn't take any money. Those funds were meant to help the children




Her words, however, were quickly lost in the chaos.


Hardly anyone believed her explanation.


Some even accused Myah of being complicit, claiming she deserved to be jailed.


When Eleanor heard the news, her usually steady eyes flickered with emotion.



Myah was the person who had granted her a second chance at life, a rare soul whose safety she would defend without hesitation.



Enigma's reputation could be sacrificed, but Myah could not be touched.


With that resolve, she pulled out her phone, preparing to address the press herself.


Just as she was about to act, a call came through. "Is this Miss Eleanor Warren? I'm Leon Ortiz, curator of the Elepdon Museum."


At that, Eleanor raised an eyebrow, momentarily taken aback. "Is there anything I can help you with?"



On the other line, Leon exhaled, his voice tinged with regret. "Miss Warren, we've seen the false reports spreading online. We deeply regret that our oversight has caused you so much trouble."



They refused to stand idly by while someone patriotic was dragged through the mud.


Eleanor's fingers tightened slightly around the phone."And?"



"The Queen's diamond tiara was a donation you made to our museum without expecting any compensation.All taxes were waived under our agreement, so there's no question of evasion!" Leon stated firmly. "We want to set the record straight. We cannot allow an honorable person to be defamed. Will you let us handle this?"



Eleanor paused, a faint smile tugging at her lips before she said, "Alright. I'lllet you."



Her decision was made for the sake of the Hope House and, above all, for Myah.
###Chapter 94 I'll Trust You



Eleanor couldn't guess what strategy Elepdon Museum would use to restore her reputation.


What mattered most was that once their official statement went public, Myah would no longer be in danger.



Before that could happen, Eleanor knew she had to visit the Hope House and reassure Myah, sparing her from unnecessary anxiety.



Determined,Eleanor set out right away.



When she stepped up to the entrance of the Hope House, she was taken aback to see a fence now enclosing the once-vacant lot across the road.



Inside the fenced area, construction workers were already hard at work, piecing together the frame of a new building.



What really took her by surprise was spotting Vickie and Emma overseeing the whole project.



Eleanor was about to quietly slip past, but Emma intercepted her.



The sharp click of Emma's heels echoed as she strode  up to Eleanor.



"Well, if it isn't the famous Enigma!" Emma taunted."After all the mess you've made for the Hope House,you still have the guts to show your face?"


Waving her hand toward the construction site, Emma looked smug. "Take a good look. The Todd Group is putting up a brand-new orphanage. Our family actually cares about these kids, unlike you. Once it's done, they'll have a real home and everything they need."



The Todd family was using charity as leverage, turning it into a weapon for personal gain.


Eleanor was taken aback by just how brazen the Todd family could be.


Greed and self-interest seemed to be woven into everything the Todds did; genuine charity had never been part of their story.


Still, Eleanor saw no point in getting dragged into a pointless argument with Emma.



She turned to walk away, but Emma caught her,by the arm.



"Stay right there!" Emma yelled, her voice ringing out."Everyone, look! It's Enigma herself! She evaded taxes and embezzled money from the Hope House!" Emma's outburst was enough to make all the workers stop and stare.


Eleanor paused, her gaze full of biting sarcasm as she faced them. "Maybe try fixing your own family's scandals before pointing fingers. The Todd family have been pocketing funds from charity projects for a long time, and both you and your mother are fully aware of it,Emma."


Her words cut with unmistakable force.


That was when Vickie hurried over, pulling Emma away before things could escalate.


Vickie chimed in, her tone sharp. "Emma, that's enough.Why bother getting into it with her right now?The Internet's already torn her apart-she's already being dragged through the mud. There's no point in arguing any further."



She then added, "Jonny believes that with Lainey backing us, our family is on the verge of making a name for itself. We should be polishing our reputation,not stirring up conflict. Do what your brother suggested and put your energy into building the orphanage instead."


Although Emma was itching to argue, she finally bit back her words. She shot Eleanor one last, venomous glare, then stalked off with her head held high.


Eleanor had no idea what plans the Todds wvere plotting, but she was certain their intentions weren't good.


Still, whatever it was didn't concern her.


She gathered herself and walked into the Hope House.


Once inside, she delivered her prepared message to Myah.



Hearing Eleanor's reassurance, Myah finally let out a long sigh.


She squeezed Eleanor's hand, her voice trembling with sadness. "Eleanor, I'm not worried about myself.What hurts is seeing everything you've done for these children twisted by strangers. It's not fair to you."


Eleanor offered a gentle comfort. "Don't worry,Myah.The museum will clear things up soon. I promise you,everything will work out."


But until the truth was out, Myah knew peace would be hard to find.



She didn't want to make things harder for Eleanor,knowing how much she had already endured. Determined to put on a brave front, Myah straightened her shoulders and replied, "Alright, I'll trust you."
###Chapter 95 They're Already Guessing You're Butterfly  
Eleanor had been tidying up inside Hope House when Nolan showed up.



He,however,chose to wait outside rather than go in.


His attention soon shifted to Erick, eyes sharp and unreadable. "If the media storm about Eleanor's taxes can't be stopped, then make sure you handle whatever rumors are circling Hope House."



Nolan understood just how much Myah meant to Eleanor, and he figured Eleanor must be on edge by now.



But Erick, nearly bouncing with enthusiasm,gave his report. "There's no need for that, Mr. Stewart."


He passed over the tablet, barely containing his excitement. "Everything's been flipped on its head!"


At that, Nolan, looking puzzled, took the tablet from him,his brow furrowed in curiosity.


What he saw next surprised him: right at the top of the trending list, the official Twitter account of the Elepdon Museum caught his eye. The museum's recent post, tagging Eleanor,announced, "Miss Eleanor Warren, we appreciate your commitment to preserving national treasures. During the auction, you generously gifted the Queen's diamond tiara to our museum. This artifact carries tremendous historical value and significance. Our museum will be hosting a special exhibition in two weeks, and we are inviting everyone to join us."



Nolan couldn't believe it. She really gave away the tiara?



He remembered how happy she had been that day,never once imagining she had bought it just to give it away.



What was she really hiding? His curiosity only grew.



As Nolan kept scrolling, the replies caught his attention even more.



A highlighted, pinned reply from the Elepdon Museum stood out at the very top of the comment section."Miss Warren has been supporting the preservation of artifacts for years, so her tax status has been clear for a long time."



One reply stood out. "Wait, are you saying she's actually been donating for years?"



Another chimed in, "Did things just do a complete  turnaround?"



Someone else explained, "The important thing is,she donated the piece the very same day she bought it.That means she always intended it for the museum.Why is anyone blaming her?"


"I honestly had no idea. I take back what I said.My apologies," another commenter admitted.


Yet another added, "If her goal was always to donate it, why should she owe any taxes in the first place?"


A different user chimed in, "I work with Photoshop,and let me tell you those bank statement screenshots people were sharing were definitely edited."


"Enigma, we're sorry. We really messed up." Another remorseful comment read.


The majority of the responses were supportive, but tucked away among them was one vague reply."Doesn't this strategy look familiar? If I'm not mistaken, the last person to pull something like this was Butterfly!"


In the world of collectors, Butterfly was practically legendary, famous for her commitment to safeguarding the nation's treasures.


Anyone with insider knowledge would have pieced together Eleanor's true identity after seeing this. The majority of online commenters, though, weren't experts. They were just regular people, blissfully unaware.



But Nolan picked up on it immediately.


Could it be? Was Eleanor actually Butterfly all along?


That possibility left him feeling undeserving of her.


Eleanor always seemed gentle and sweet to him, and she had never stopped to surprise him.


Meanwhile, he was simply another rich guy, nothing truly remarkable in comparison.


That thought pushed Nolan into action.



He knew he needed to make his move before anyone else uncovered the truth and tried to win her over.


That realization sent him rushing out of the car and straight into Hope House.



The instant he found Eleanor, Nolan pulled her aside to a corner, wrapping her in his embrace.


His breath brushed against her cheek as he spoke softly. "You accepted my ring that day, remember? So,what do you say? Will you marry me?"


Eleanor hadn't been expecting a proposal, so his  question left her speechless.


Nolan's tone shifted, sounding almost wounded as he admitted, "Even just being you, you've already got a crowd of admirers. If everyone knew about your another identity, how am I supposed to compete?"


Was he really just trying to stake his claim before anyone else could?



That realization made Eleanor chuckle. "Why would you even think that?"



Leaning in, Nolan rested his chin on her shoulder, his voice tinged with annoyance. "I saw what people were saying online. They're already guessing you're Butterfly."



So,her secret was starting to unravel after all?



That thought wiped the playful spark from Eleanor's eyes.



She eased out of his arms and pulled out her phone.



Her fingers moved quickly as she scrolled through the hot topics and comment threads, a quiet sigh of relief escaping her lips.


Thank goodness, only a handful of people seemed to have caught on to the truth so far.
###Chapter 96 He Really Does Care About You
 Eleanor felt a surge of satisfaction and leaned in to press a soft kiss against Nolan's lips "Feeling better now?" she asked.



Nolan froze for a heartbeat, pleasantly surprised, and instinctively leaned in to deepen it, but Eleanor gently pushed him back.



"That's enough," she said softly



If it weren't for Nolan's recent considerate behavior,she wouldn't have made the first move



He got the hint and stepped back with a sly smile,quickly returning to his usual calm and confident self


With his hands in his pockets, he looked at her with curiosity. "So, are there still things about you l don't know?"



Eleanor shot him a sharp glare and returned to her cleaning.


After a beat, she muttered, "No comment."


 
When Nolan left the orphanage, he couldn't suppress that bright smile.


Erick blinked, stunned.



It had been years since Nolan had smiled like that.



But before Erick could tease him, Nolan's piercing gaze pinned him to the spot.



"Mr.Stewart..." Erick straightened instantly.


"Drive," Nolan ordered, his eyes still sharp.



"Yes, sir," Erick replied, obedient as ever.



But the good mood didn't last.



His phone buzzed, and he saw that his grandfather was calling.



"I know what's going on." Norwood's voice was firm."But you and her? Forget it Don't even think<about it."



It was clear that Norwood would never accept Eleanor as his granddaughter-in-law.



To him, a woman who had captured Nolan's heart simply didn't fit the family's expectations



He wanted someone from a similar background and social standing,someone who could match Nolan in every way. Nolan knew exactly what his grandfather meant, but he refused to back down. "Grandpa, I understand your concerns. I'll prove it to you-"



"No. I don't agree." Norwood cut him off, hanging up before Nolan could finish.



On the other side, Nolan stared at the dimming screen,a determined glint in his cold eyes.



Then, pulling out his phone, he typed a message to Eleanor. "Together forever, no matter what."



At that exact moment, Eleanor took a sip of soup and nearly choked on it. "Seriously?" she muttered under her breath.



First a proposal, and now this mysterious message.


Was he upset, serious, or just being dramatic? She had no idea.



However, before she could ponder further, Myah's concerned voice came from beside her. "What's wrong? You seem distracted."


Myah's curious eyes fell on Eleanor's face, and seeing the faint blush, she immediately understood. "Alright,finish your meal, then go enjoy your romance. That young man... he really does care about you." Eleanor felt jealous.



"It's barely been a short while, and you're already on his side?" she muttered softly, jealousy creeping into her tone.



Myah rolled her eyes playfully. "Enough whining. Eat,then get back to your work. Don't worry about the Hope House. I've got it covered."


Eleanor let out a sullen "oh" and quickly finished her meal.



After cleaning up, she stared at Nolan's earlier message,lost in thought.



Together forever?



She shook her head slightly, bemused.



They had only just started seeing each other, and he was already dropping lines like that.


Could Lillian have been right? Maybe the Stewarts really did dive headfirst into love without a second thought.



The more Eleanor considered it, the more it seemed believable.



Despite being a shrewd business tycoon, Nolan might just be a hopeless romantic. Well, maybe she should treat hima little better from now on.



Everyone deserved a bit of indulgence for being a hopeless romantic.


Meanwhile, Nolan had no inkling that his impulsive,heartfelt message might make him look foolish.Had he known, he would have deleted it immediately.



At the same time, at the Todd famnily's residence,Lainey was far from laughing. She gripped her phone so tightly her knuckles went white, finally hurling it to the floor in frustration.


Those relentless netizens! Somehow, they had tracked her down again, and their insults were growing harsher by the hour. How could they find her, even after she changed her IP and stayed anonymous?


But soon, she reminded herself, soon she would officially be a Benton. Those lowly online critics didn't matter. Nothing could touch her once she had that kind of power.


Still, the real thorn in her side wasn't the Internet.It was Eleanor.



Every time she thought she had her rival cornered,Eleanor slipped through her fingers unscathed. The thought made Lainey's chest tighten with fury.


She refused to accept it. She wouldn't accept it.



Jonny, having seen the online commotion, looked equally stunned. Eleanor's latest charitable donation had made waves, and somehow, Lainey had been behind those rumors all along.



Yet despite the shock, Jonny's attention shifted.He couldn't afford to lose Lainey after already losing Eleanor.



Since Lainey was a Benton by blood, he had to keep her happy.



With that in mind, he quickly pulled her into his arms,trying to soothe her. "Hey, don't be upset. Tomorrow,we're heading to the beach. Just you and me,okay?Relax and forget about all this nonsense."



Lainey, with no other outlet for her anger, nodded obediently, though her mind was still simmering.
###Chapter 97 Eleanor, Don't Get Too Comfortable
Lillian had been scrolling through comments when one in particular caught her attention. Someone boldly suggested that Enigma might actually be Butterfly.


Of course she saw it. As Eleanor's number-one fan,she never missed a single post, reply, or rumor tied to her best friend.



Still, the thought left her fuming.


Eleanor,hiding something this big from her?


Snatching her purse off the sofa, she marched out the door and waited until Eleanor arrived back at her apartment.



The second Eleanor appeared,Lillian crossed her arms,with her best "serious interrogator" look, and demanded, "Alright, tell me the truth, are you Butterfly?"


Eleanor froze, then let out a small sigh."Whether I am or not, I'm still your best friend."



That was all Lillian needed. Knowing Eleanor as well as she did, the lack of denial was practically an admission.


Her jaw dropped.



Eleanor was actually Butterfly-the legendary collector everyone talked about!


The shock lasted about two seconds before her inner drama queen burst forth. She grabbed Eleanor's arm,fake-crying like she was in a soap opera. "How could you keep something this huge from me? Do you even love me as a friend?"



She squeezed out a few tears for effect, then immediately demanded, "You have to make it up to me! I want a seaside vacation in Asnoyle, and you're coming with me. No excuses!"


Faced with Lillian's theatrics, Eleanor could only give in with a helpless nod.


Asnoyle, on Elepdon's eastern coast, was a hotspot for tourists.


But Lillian's dreamy plan for a quiet, two-person getaway was shattered the moment they arrived.


Wherever Eleanor went, whispers and squeals followed. "Wait, isn't that Enigma?"


"She's even prettier in real life!"



"Quick, let's ask for her autograph!"


Within mninutes, they were swarmed. Lillian instantly regretted everything.



This wasn't a beach trip. This was a full-blown fan event.



And the universe wasn't done messing with them.


Of all people, they bumped straight into Jonny and Lainey.



Lainey's face soured the second she saw Eleanor soaking up the spotlight.


With a smug little sway in her steps, she sauntered over and lowered her voice so only Eleanor and Lillian could hear. "Eleanor, don't get too comfortable. Once my parents return, my status will soar. And when that happens, I'll have countless ways to deal with you."


Eleanor didn't even bother glancing at her.


Ignoring Lainey was, in her opinion, the sharpest response.



Lillian, on the other hand, wasn't built for patience. Planting her hands firmly on her hips, she glared at Lainey and snapped, "Are you blind? Move it. You're in our way!"



But Lainey,now carrying herself like she was a Benton,clearly didn't think much of the Brooks family.



Folding her arms with a smug tilt of her chin, she smirked. "Enjoy your pride while it lasts. When the time comes, we'll see how tough you really act in front of me."



She threw one last disdainful look at Lillian before strutting off, with Jonny following close behind like a loyal little sidekick.


Lillian's temper flared. She stomped her foot and shouted after her, "Who does she think she is? So what if she really is a Benton? Big deal! We've got Nolan!"



Eleanor couldn't help but laugh at her friend's fiery outburst. She reached over and soothed, "Don't let her get under your skin. She's not worth it."



Then,looking slightly sheepish,Eleanor added,"By the way,if you still want to hang out, we'd better make the most of today."



Lillian narrowed her eyes, suspicious. "What's that supposed to mean?" Avoiding her gaze, Eleanor touched her nose and admitted, "Dyer messaged me. They just found a cluster of ancient tombs in Otrad, and he wants me there the day after tomorrow."


Her tone softened with guilt. "So, for a while, I probably won't have much time for you."



Lillian's anger instantly froze on her face, but it quickly crumbled.



Her eyes welled up, and she burst into loud sobs."Why is my life so pitiful?" she cried miserably.


On one hand, she felt secretly proud that her best friend was such an important figure. But on the other hand, whenever Eleanor's work called, she was gone without a trace.



How unlucky was she to have a best friend like that?Lillian's chest ached with grievances, and she couldn't help but feel wronged.
###Chapter 98 My Most Prized Protégé
For the next two days, Eleanor and Lillian lived without restraint, chasing every thrill they could find.


They raced across the waves on jet skis, watched fireworks paint the night sky over the ocean, and ended their nights with smoky barbecues by the shore.It was the kind of carefree fun they had always dreamed about.



But their joyride was cut short. On their way back from the beach, their car hadn't even pulled up to Eleanor's apartment when a seek black Volkswagen suddenly swerved in front of them, blocking the road.



The door flew open, and out hopped a sprightly old man.Without hesitation, he yanked Eleanor's car door wide.



"Quick, Eleanor, come with me!" he blurted,practically dragging her out. "I've got an interview,and I can't go alone. I'm too nervous!"


Lillian sat frozen in the passenger seat, too shocked to even react as Eleanor was swept away.


Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself in a television station dressing room. Dyer planted her firmly into a chair and wagged his finger like a stern grandfather.



"Stay here. Don't even think about running. You know how easily I get rattled in front of cameras. Without you nearby, I'll lose my nerve," Dyer insisted with exaggerated seriousness.



Eleanor bit back a laugh.


This was the same man who once marched alone into a freshly unearthed tomb to examine relics no one dared touch, yet now he claimed to be scared of a few cameras.



Even a child wouldn't buy such a flimsy excuse.



But Eleanor had no choice.



Dyer was her mentor, and she knew when to yield.



With a sigh, she gave him a reluctant nod.


That was all it took. Dyer, pleased, straightened his jacket and headed out cheerfully towards the stage.


Soon, the live broadcast kicked off.



After greeting the viewers, the host leaned in with a bright smile. "Mr. Curtis, the discovery of the Blackwind Catacombs is groundbreaking. We hear you'll personally be guiding the excavation?" Dyer stroked his graying beard, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. "Of course. How could I miss such a momentous event?"



The host's curiosity sharpened as he pressed on. "And this time, which of your brilliant students will be accompanying you?"


At that, Dyer's smile grew even broader, pride filling his voice. "Isn't it obvious? My most prized protégé."


He turned slightly and gestured to the side.


The camera followed, and the nation's audience was caught off guard by the sudden reveal of a calm,striking figure stepping into frame.


Enigma.Or rather,Eleanor.


The Internet detonated on the spot.


Elepdon Museum's old comment section was dredged up within minutes, while the live-stream comments,after a stunned pause, exploded like fireworks.


"Am I seeing this right? That's Eleanor?"


"Enigma? No way. It's really her! My idol is actually on screen,live!"


"Hold up, why does her name sound familiar... oh my god, she's the same woman who casually donated the Queen's diamond tiara!"



"So you're telling me the legendary designer Enigma is the same Eleanor who threw a hundred million in artifacts at the museum like it was pocket change?"


"Too much information at once, my brain's crashing!"


"Forget that. Did you hear what Dyer just said? His most prized protégé!"


And then came the clincher.


The resurfaced Elepdon Museum comment, linedup perfectly with Dyer's words, sealed the theory in everyone's mind.


A brilliant archaeology disciple. A magnanimous artifact donor. Who else could Butterfly be, if not Eleanor?


Eleanor's expression was priceless.


She turned a glare on Dyer the second he returned.


"Didn't you say I wouldn't have to show my face?"Shoving her phone at him, she added, "Look at this madness. How am I supposed to quietly donate to Elepdon Museum now?"



The trending headlines blazed across her screen.

"Shocking! Enigma Revealed as Butterfly of the Collecting World!"



"Dyer Curtis Publicly Declares Eleanor Warren His Most Treasured Protégé!"



Dyer glanced at the words, then burst into a squinty-eyedgrin. "What's there to worry about? Let the world chatter. As long as you don't confirm it, everything stays in your hands."



To him, it was nothing but noise.


After all, he had had to watch David flaunt his star student day after day.


Eleanor might have studied under David first, before meeting Dyer, but because she had never formally bowed as Dyer's apprentice, he had carried the sting of being outdone for years.


And today,he finally got his payback.


Eleanor stared at his smug expression and instantly understood that this wasn't about her at all.


It was just another round in the endless duel between Dyer and David.



Two old men, with nearly two centuries of life between them, were still bickering like children.Honestly,it was exhausting.
###Chapter 99 You've Got A Deal!
Plenty of people celebrated the news, but there were just as many who met it with disbelief and outrage.


Lainey,upon catching sight of the headline, froze in shock.



It read,"Enigma is Butterfly."


She could read every character in that headline,yet somehow, the meaning just wouldn't click for her.



What other secrets was Eleanor hiding? And why did she get to live such a dazzling life?



Jealousy twisted inside Lainey, and she resolved to put an end to Eleanor's time in the spotlight.


Clenching her jaw, she dug out a phone with an old,unused number and made a call.


Soon after, a man answered, his tone teasing. "Baby,I thought you'd already settled down. What's made you call me out of the blue?"


Swallowing her disgust,Lainey put on a syrupy sweet voice. "Horace, I need you to take care of someone  for me. Whatever it costs, I'll pay."


Horace Boyd came with a reputation, and he sounded interested. "Really now? Who's foolish enough to get on your bad side?"


Hatred burned in Lainey's eyes as she bit down on her lip. "I'll message you the specifics soon. Just say if you're up for the job."


Horace let out a deep, amused laugh. "There's nothing I can't handle. As long as you can get me in with the Benton family, I'll take care of anyone you point me toward."



Horace operated in the criminal underworld, while the Benton family had always built their reputation on strictly lawful business.


Linking those two worlds wouldn't be simple, but it was definitely within reach.



As the self-proclaimed star of the Benton family,Lainey believed she was more than capable of making it happen.


Without another thought, she agreed right, away,"You've got a deal!"



Meanwhile,Eleanor was blissfully unaware of Lainey's schemes. All her attention was on calming down David.


"Eleanor! You went to appear on TV with Dyer? Do l even matter to you as a teacher anymore?" David's angry voice blasted through the phone.


With a weary sigh, Eleanor pressed her fingers to her temple and pushed the phone away from her ear.


Her voice softened as she tried to reassure him."David,'I know l made a mistake. It won't happen again,I swear. Please don't get worked up, or I'll start to worry."


She then continued, "Dyer's only acting this way because he's jealous of you. Honestly, he wishes he had a student like me, so he's just trying to stir things up. Don't let him get under your skin."


A little patience and reassurance was all it took for David's anger to melt away.



He muttered a few last complaints before offering some advice to Eleanor. "Otrad's got a harsh, dry climate, and sandstorms aren't uncommon. Look after yourself. Don't think you can just ignore these things because you're still young."


A gentle warmth blossomed in Eleanor's chest, and a small smile broke across her face. "I will, I promise." Once the call ended, she let out a long sigh and sank into the sofa.



At last, everyone was settled for now.



It struck her that she really needed to be more cautious going forward and keep her other lives a secret,or else she would have more trouble than she could handle.



After taking a few moments to recharge, Eleanor begansorting her things for the journey to Otrad.


Out of nowhere, her phone lit up with a text from Nolan. "When are you heading out?"


A faint smile played on Eleanor's lips as she tapped out her response. "I'm catching a flight tomorrow morning."



Nolan didn't make her wait long. "Let me know the moment you land. I'm going to miss you."


Those final words touched her more than she expected, prompting Eleanor to reply, "I will. The connection isn't great over there, but I'll text you the moment I get a better signal."


Thinking that would be the end of their exchange,Eleanor set her phone aside, until it buzzed once more. Nolan had sent another message. "Look outside.I'm downstairs."



That made Eleanor freeze for a second.


She hurried to the window, pulling the curtain aside just enoughto peek outside.


Bathed in the glow of the streetlamp, Nolan's Bentley was parked below. He was there, leaning casually against the car, his eyes fixed on her window.
###Chapter 100 And Don't Forget To Miss Me
Eleanor didn't even stop to think. She just snatched her jacket, flew down the stairs, and nearly collided with Nola.



Breathless,she stammered, "You...why are you-"



But she didn't get to finish. He pulled her straight into his arms and held her so tightly that she was able to feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.


His chin restedlightly on her hair, his breath brushing her face.



When he finally let her go,his voice was soft but sure."Safe travels. And don't forget to miss me."


Eleanor blinked. That was it? He had come all the way here just to say something like that?


She was torn between laughter and exasperation.



Nolan really was hopeless-an unapologetic romantic through and through.


After exchanging a few words, she returned upstairs,collapsed into bed, and slept straight through without  a single dream.


The following morning, she was on her way to the airport with Dyer.


The moment they stepped out of the car, chaos erupted.


"Eleanor,look this way!"


"Eleanor,are you really Butterfly?"



"I'm such a big fan,Eleanor!"


The endless shouting was starting to drill into Eleanor's skull, each cheer making her temples throb.


She turned toward Dyer, who was soaking in the attention.



Her glare could have set fire to him, but the old man only raised his brows in smug amusement.


With a booming laugh, he lifted a hand for silence,and to her disbelief, the chaotic noise melted into silence.



Clearing his throat with exaggerated gravity, he announced in a mock-serious tone, "The only thing you all need to know is that she is my most prized student. As for Butterfly, or whatever name you're tossing around, I've never even heard of such a person." His explanation was so half-hearted it practically dripped with insincerity.


The moment the words left his mouth, the crowd burst into laughter, booing and tossing playful jabs his way,clearly amused by the flimsy denial.


"Come on, Dyer, who'd believe that?"


"Exactly, that's basically admitting it!"


"Confirmed! Enigma is Butterfly!"


As the shouts grew louder and the path ahead clogged with eager fans, Dyer grabbed Eleanor's wrist and made a break for the terminal.


Just before disappearing inside, he turned and barked,"I never admitted anything! Remember, this is all your own wild speculation!"







Once the plane took off smoothly and things calmed down, Dyer leaned back in his seat, looking very pleased with himself. He shot Eleanor a sideways grin,smug as ever. "So? Pretty smooth, right? Didn't I handle that just fine?"


Eleanor gave him a flat look, his playful tone not surprising her in the least.Without a word, she unlocked her phone, pulled up the trending topics, and handed it over to him. "Want to see what people are saying online?"


Still wearing that self-satisfied smile, Dyer took the phone.



But the moment his eyes landed on the glaring headline, his grin stiffened. "Dyer confirms Butterfly is Enigma at the airport."


He skimmed the articles, saw the flood of giddy comments, and though his eyes lit with amusement,he still muttered with annoyance, "Ridiculous! These shameless reporters! They're just lying through their teeth, twisting every word! Just wait till I'm back from Otrad, I'm suing every last one of them!"


Eleanor calmly took her phone back, propped her chin in her hand, and chose silence over fueling his theatrics.
